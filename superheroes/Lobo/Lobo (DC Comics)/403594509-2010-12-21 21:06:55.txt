'''Lobo''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in the [[comic books]] published by [[DC Comics]]. The character first appears in ''[[Omega Men]]'' #3 (June 1983), and was created by [[Roger Slifer]] and [[Keith Giffen]]. An [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|alien]], Lobo works as an interstellar [[mercenary]] and [[bounty hunter]]. Although introduced as a hardened, rarely-used [[hardboiled|noir]] villain in the 1980s, he languished in limbo until his revival as an [[anti-hero]] biker in the early 1990s. The character enjoyed a short run as one of DC’s most popular characters throughout the 1990s. This version of Lobo was intended to be an over-the-top [[parody]] of [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]] [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] (in issue #41 of [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]], another Marvel series, Lobo himself was parodied in the likeness of [[Dirty Wolff]], a large blue skinned man who drove a demonic motorcycle).

"I have no idea why Lobo took off," Giffen once said in an interview. Referring to the 1990s incarnation of Lobo he created, he said, "I came up with him as an indictment of the [[Punisher]], [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], hero prototype and somehow he caught on as the high violence poster boy. Go figure."<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20060525000607/http://www.newsarama.com/images/interviews/2006/giffen/GiffenBio.htm  Comic Book Biography: Keith Giffen], [[Newsarama]], March 10, 2006 (cached)</ref>

==Publication history==
Lobo was originally a regular character in [[Keith Giffen]] and [[Roger Slifer]]’s [[Green Lantern]] [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] ''[[Omega Men]].'' At that time, he was a Velorpian whose entire race had been exterminated by Psions; his origin was later [[retroactive continuity|retconned]]. After a well-received appearance in [[Justice League International]], Lobo became a regular character in ''[[L.E.G.I.O.N.]]'' and its successor series ''[[R.E.B.E.L.S.]]'' In 1990, he appeared in his own [[miniseries]], ''Lobo: The Last Czarnian'', plotted by Giffen, written by [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]] and with art by [[Simon Bisley]], which changed his origin story: he became the last Czarnian after violently killing every other member of the species.

Grant's humor and Bisley's art helped to make this four-issue series a hit, leading to many subsequent miniseries and specials. These include ''Lobocop'' (a [[RoboCop]] parody); ''Blazing Chain of Love'' (in which he is sent on a job to a [[harem]]); ''Paramilitary Christmas Special'' (in which he is contracted by the [[Easter Bunny]] to assassinate [[Santa Claus]]); ''Infanticide'' (where he kills his daughter and all of his other bastard offspring that she has gathered to try to kill him); ''Convention Special'' (a send-up of [[fan convention|comic book conventions]]); and ''Unamerican Gladiators'' (in which Lobo takes part in a deadly televised [[game show]]). Lobo also starred in his own title for 64 issues, from 1993 to 1999. 

Over the years, Lobo has regularly made [[guest appearance]]s in other series, even in [[intercompany crossover|cross-company interactions]] with such non-DC characters as [[The Mask]], [[Judge Dredd]], and [[the Authority]]. During the [[DC vs. Marvel]] crossover series, he fought [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] and lost due to popular vote by real-life fans. He also appeared very briefly in the [[JLA/Avengers]] intercompany crossover and is shown fighting members of the [[Shi'ar]] [[Imperial Guard (comics)|Imperial Guard]], though the outcome is never shown.

In the Lobo series and [[miniseries]], everything is excessive, from the main character's perversions, mindless violence, and vocabulary to the grungy color palette and grotesque graphics. He commonly refers to "do-gooder" superheroes as "The Big Cheese." Everything in the series is laughable (in the sense of being ridiculous, if not always amusing), even his profanities ("[[Frag (video gaming)|frag]]," "Feetal's Gizz," and "bastich"; the latter a [[portmanteau]] of "bastard" and "son of a bitch"), which are used to replace vocabulary unwanted by a family-friendly DC and to satirize similar expressions in other comics.

Lobo has made a few appearances in the animated series of the 1990s/2000s-era [[DC animated universe]]. At one point, an animated series and [[video game]] starring the character were to be released, but both were canceled.

In [[2009]] [[Anthrax]] guitarist [[Scott Ian]] and [[Sam Kieth]] collaborated to create "Lobo: Highway to Hell", released in November of the same year.<ref>[http://www.wired.com/underwire/2009/07/anthrax-guitarist-scott-ian-shreds-dc-comics-hellraiser-lobo/ Anthrax Guitarist Scott Ian Shreds DC Comics Hellraiser Lobo by Scott Thill, [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]], July 22, 2009]</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Lobo is a [[Czarnia (planet)|Czarnia]]n (originally a Velorpian in the Omega Men series) with exceptional strength and fortitude. He enjoys nothing better than mindless violence and intoxication. Killing is an end in itself; his name is [[Khund]]ian for "he who devours your entrails and thoroughly enjoys it." He is also arrogant and self-centered, focusing almost solely on his own pleasures, although he proudly lives up to his word &ndash; but exactly his word: no more or no less than what he promised. Lobo is the last of his kind, having committed complete genocide by killing all the other Czarnians for fun (as originally written, Psions had exterminated his race, but after the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]], this was [[retroactive continuity|retcon]]ned). As detailed in Lobo #0, Lobo unleashed a violent plague (a hybrid of flying scorpions) upon his homeworld, killing most of its citizens. In ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', Lobo nonchalantly tells Superman the fate of his race: "I'm the last Czarnian. I fragged the rest of the planet for my high school science project. Gave myself an A."

[[Image:omegamen 03.jpg|left|thumb|185px|The first appearance of Lobo.]]

Lobo's friends include Dawg, a [[bulldog]] that he often claims is not his when it gets into trouble; [[Jonas Glim]], a fellow bounty hunter; and Ramona, a bail bondswoman/hairdresser. Dawg is stomped to death by Lobo in ''Lobo #58'' in which he claims to [[Superman]] that the dog is not his (for the final time). However, Dawg later appears alongside Lobo when Lobo goes to Earth to fight Green Lantern and Atrocitus. His enemies include the do-gooder superhero parody [[Goldstar (DC Comics)|Goldstar]], Loo, [[Vril Dox]], Bludhound, [[Etrigan the Demon]], and [[General Glory]]. Lobo generally tries to kill anyone he's hired to capture, including his fourth-grade teacher named Miss Tribb, his children, [[Santa Claus]], and Gawd. [[Simon Bisley]]'s dark humor fits well within the pages of his artwork by having countless mutilations of background characters occurring in each panel.

Physically, Lobo resembles a chalk-white human male with blood-red [[pupil]]less eyes surrounded by black eye shadow-like patches. Like many comic book characters, Lobo's body is highly muscular. Although he was originally portrayed as having neatly trimmed purple-grey hair, this was soon redesigned to be a long, straggly, grey-black mane, and more recently into [[dreadlocks]]. Similarly, the orange-and-purple leotard he wore in his first few appearances has long since been replaced by black leather [[motorcycle|biker]] gear, which more recently has been replaced with both the robes of his office &ndash; as putative Archbishop of the Church of the Triple-Fish God &ndash; and seemingly pirate-inspired gear. His arsenal includes numerous guns and a titanium chain with a hook on his right arm. Extra weapons may include "frag grenades" and giant carving blades.

In addition to his ever-present lust for violence, Lobo also has a strict personal code of honor &ndash; he will never violate the ''letter'' of an agreement (he said in Superman: TAS that "The Main Man's word is his bond."), although he may gleefully disregard its ''spirit.'' Also, he is surprisingly protective of space [[dolphin]]s, some of which he feeds from his home. A few have been killed in separate incidents, which he avenges with his usual violence.

Lobo frequents the business of Al, a rotund diner operator, where he frequently flirts with Al's only waitress, Darlene. Though Lobo protects these two from any harm, the danger of which is frequent, he doesn't seem to understand the distress caused by his tendency to destroy the diner. Al and Darlene later prosper due to Lobo's appetite for destruction; he destroys the city, except for the diner, leaving hordes of construction workers only one place to eat lunch. He also ends up destroying a diner Al gives to him as part of a birthday celebration. 

The last of the relation of Lobo and the diner appears to be in the pages of Lobo One Million, where his last adventure is depicted. By the time of the action, he's already morbidly obese and working as a carnival attraction, scaring tourists into leaving their money behind. Then, a sexy client appears to offer him a last job: to find a legendary evildoer named Malo Perverso. At the prospect of a last well-paid job and a chance to score with the client, Lobo quickly agrees, and again invades the diner to use their Tesseract teleporter to reach his gear. It is revealed then than the "client" is none other than Darlene, who wanted to see him back in his prime rather than see him sink even deeper into sloth. After reaching his gear, Lobo invades the HQ of the JLWB (Justice League of Wannabes) and crushes all opposition in order to hack their files on Malo Perverso. There, he is attacked by Perverso himself, who then reveals himself to be Clayman, the team's shapeshifter, who admits he impersonated Perverso to get rid of Lobo. Clayman also squeals where the real Perverso went: into a black hole. Lobo, still eager to find his bounty, goes into the black hole. Ironically, due to Lobo's interference in a planetary conflict in the same issue, Al later gets a package through Tesseract for Lobo-which promptly blows the diner up yet again.

At one point, Lobo has trouble with a clone of himself that had survived previous misadventures. A battle between the two makes it unclear which of them survived. Some fans conclude that the original Lobo was the victor, since later in the series, Lobo removes a miniature radio which he had surgically implanted in his head some time before the clone fight, and only organic matter can be cloned.

The character has participated in several money-making schemes, such as being a priest and being a pop-rock idol. Most of these schemes tend to end with the violent deaths of nearly everyone involved. He has many friends among the bounty hunter world, though many tend to die around Lobo, either by his hand or at the hands of enemies he faces. 

===Crossovers===

Lobo has clashed (and cooperated) with [[Superman]]. He has also encountered Batman several times, although one of these encounters was in [[Elseworlds]] continuity. He has both fought and teamed up with [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]] more than once, helping him to destroy various alien threats to Earth. Lobo often visits Warrior's, Guy's bar, where he enjoys free drinks. 

He fights [[Aquaman]] when a traveling space dolphin visiting Earth is killed by Japanese fishermen. He ceases fighting when he learns Aquaman is not only friend to dolphins but was raised by them. "Aw, frag," mutters Lobo. "Now I gotta be ''civil''." Although Lobo feels he cannot hurt a fellow dolphin lover, he has no such mercy for the fishermen.

Lobo also appeared several times in the pages of [[The Authority]]. In one such appearance, [[Jenny Quantum]] finds a comic book detailing Lobo's murder of [[Santa Claus]], she experiences a fit of rage and confusion. She breaks the barrier between her dimension and the dimension Lobo inhabits in the comic book, and Lobo finds himself in a fight with [[The Authority]].

In the two-part ''Lobo vs The Mask'' crossover, Lobo is hired for the sum of one billion credits by a council of survivors of several devastated planets to track down the individual responsible. His trail leads to Earth, where Lobo encounters the current wearer of an ancient [[The Mask|mask]]. The resulting battle destroys Manhattan and leaves Lobo as nothing but a severed head, waiting for his body to re-grow. Big Head, convincing Lobo he wants the previous mask wearer, agrees to a team-up to hunt the "Ultimate Bastich" down. Big Head leads Lobo on a chase to nowhere, killing even more and blowing up a solar system in the process. Fed up with Big Head, Lobo uses a special "guilt grenade" to force the wearer to remove the mask so that he can use it himself. Lobo promptly kills an entire intergalactic bar full of aliens, and is sucked into a wormhole on his ride through space. Landing in parts unknown, Lobo/Mask heads to a single planet where, crashing the 400th annual Feel Good Games, he insults a king, and proceeds to kill numerous people. A crayon drawing left on his bike with the words "YOU SMELL" incurs his wrath, and he destroys numerous planets hunting down the one who drew the insulting picture. Waking up one day, Lobo finds himself back on Earth, and realizes the mask used him. Tossing it away, he proceeds to leave only to pass himself arriving on Earth.  As it turns out, the wormhole sent him back in time roughly one month. He had been hired to hunt himself, and the alley where he dumped the mask was the same alley where the pickpocket would find it in part 1. However, Lobo breaks the time loop, literally turning himself in as he shaves the other Lobo's head and paints him green for the reward money.  Meanwhile, Big Head, realizing that Lobo has broken the loop, decides to have fun of its own on Earth.

Lobo has also had run-ins with Hitman, Judge Dredd, Valor, Starman, The Ray, Deadman, Green Lantern, and the JLA, among others.

"Coach Lobo" sends the [[Tiny Titans]] on a race around the world in issue #16 of that series.  In a tirade about the laziness of his students, Lobo reveals that, "Back on my planet, when I was a kid, I had to run to school uphill both ways!... Uphill in the rain and snow together!  Volcanoes were erupting all around us!  Dolphins were everywhere!  All we had for fun was exercise!" 

In the [[Amalgam Comics]] universe, Lobo is fused with [[Howard the Duck]] to become [[Lobo the Duck]].

===L.E.G.I.O.N./R.E.B.E.L.S.===
{{Main|L.E.G.I.O.N.}}
Lobo acts as an independent bounty hunter until tricked by [[Vril Dox]] into nominally joining his interstellar police force, ''[[L.E.G.I.O.N.]]'' However, he continues solo activity, which seems to often bring him to Earth and in conflict with its heroes. He remains loyal to Vril Dox after L.E.G.I.O.N. leadership is usurped by Dox's son, until an altercation between Lobo and Dox prompts Dox to release Lobo from his service. After this, Lobo becomes a full-time bounty hunter again.

===Li'L Lobo===
In the year 2000, a magical accident transforms Lobo into a [[adolescence|teenager]]. In this state, he joins [[Young Justice]] and eventually accompanies them to [[Apokolips]], where he is killed in combat. However, the aforementioned magical accident has restored his ability to grow clones from a single drop of blood, and millions of Lobos rush into battle against Apokoliptian soldiers, whom the Lobos quickly defeat. The Lobos then turn on each other, until only one is left; in the process, the surviving Lobo regrows to adulthood. His time as a member of Young Justice becomes a distant memory. An additional weaker teenage Lobo with yellow eyes remained, however, having hidden from the fight; he rejoins Young Justice and chooses to rename himself '''Slo-bo'''. Eventually, this clone begins to degrade, becoming blind, and degenerating to the brink of death. Before he can die, however, [[Darkseid]] teleports him to the headquarters of Young Justice [[DC One Million|One Million]] in the 853rd Century, turning him into a statue (but fully conscious and aware) in the process. When later Lobo meets  [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Robin]] and [[Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark)|Wonder Girl]] again as members of the [[Teen Titans]] he demonstrates no recollections of them or their history together, demonstrating that he has indeed forgotten his time as their teammate.

===52===
{{Main|52 (comics)}}
After an extended hiatus, Lobo reappeared during the year-long maxi-series known as ''52'' where he encounters a group of heroes (consisting of [[Adam Strange]], [[Animal Man]], and [[Starfire (comics)|Starfire]]), who find themselves stranded in space after the events of [[Infinite Crisis]]. To everyone's surprise he does not kill them. Lobo professes to have found religion, becoming the spiritual leader of the whole of sector 3500, left in shambles by a still unknown assailant. He is the current caretaker of the [[Emerald Empress|Emerald Eye]] of Ekron. After helping the lost heroes to defeat [[Lady Styx]], he brings the Emerald Eye to the triple-headed fish god, who agrees to release Lobo from his vow of non-violence in exchange. When told that the Emerald Eye is the only thing that can kill the fish god, Lobo blasts him with it.

===One Year Later===
Lobo appeared in "Deadly Serious" a two-part [[intercompany crossover|crossover]] miniseries with Batman in August 2007, written and drawn by Sam Kieth. In addition, Lobo has fought the [[Teen Titans]] and [[Blue Beetle (Jaime Reyes)|Blue Beetle]] in their respective titles in order to stop a rocket for the Reach, which he failed.

In the ''[[Hell (DC Comics)#Reign in Hell|Reign in Hell]]'' miniseries, it is revealed that at some point in time Lobo's soul was sent to [[Hell (DC Comics)|Hell]] (possibly after the death of his original body on Apokolips). Lobo's suffering was enough to power [[Neron]]'s whole castle. Lobo was freed from his prison in a battle between [[Etrigan]] and [[Blue Devil]], and went on a rampage through hell to seek revenge on Neron. In order to buy time to fully recover before battling Lobo, Etrigan stole Blue Devil's soul and informed him that he would have to fight Lobo to get it back. During Lobo's rampage he cut off [[Zatara]]'s head, forcing his daughter, [[Zatanna]] to send him to the Abyss (soul death).

===Brightest Day===
In ''[[Brightest Day]]'' crossover, Lobo appeared on Earth to capture a bounty on [[Atrocitus]]'s head.<ref>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #54</ref> After fighting [[Hal Jordan]], [[Carol Ferris]] and [[Sinestro]], he then fled, which Hal found unusual. However, it is revealed that the fight was all staged by Atrocitus himself. As a payment, Lobo was given a [[Red Lantern Corps|Red Lantern]].<ref>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #55</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Lobo possesses extraordinary strength of undefined limits. His strength, much like his other powers, varies greatly depending upon different artistic interpretations of various comic book writers. In some instances, he is depicted as being barely stronger than a human while, in others, he demonstrates physical strength on a similar level to [[Superman]]. Lobo also possesses superhuman durability, which varies greatly as well. Lobo is depicted, in some situations, as being injured by conventional bullets while, in other situations, he has the physical resiliency to stand toe to toe with Superman, survive unprotected in deep space, and withstand powerful explosive blasts without sustaining injury. He has displayed particular susceptibility to gaseous chemicals.

If Lobo sustains injury, his accelerated [[healing factor]] enables him to regenerate damaged or destroyed tissue with superhuman speed and efficiency, and little apparent pain. Lobo also is functionally immortal. He is immune to the effects of aging and disease and he has been banned from entering either Heaven or Hell. As such, even though he can sustain sufficient injury to be out of commission for quite some time, he will apparently heal from any injury, given sufficient time. For instance, Lobo can regenerate out of a pool of his own blood, apparently recycling the cells.<ref>''52'' vol.1 #20</ref> At one time, Lobo could grow a copy of himself, possessing all of his skills and powers, out of every drop of his blood that was spilled. This power was removed by [[Vril Dox]], during Lobo's time with [[L.E.G.I.O.N.]], but Lobo has apparently regained it, as seen during the series [[Young Justice]], in which Lobo who was de-aged by [[Klarion the Witch Boy]], is slaughtered while on a mission to Apokolips.  His blood reforms into thousands of Lobo clones who rage war on the planet and then proceed to murder each other until only one Lobo (the current one) is left.  One of his other clones Slo-Bo survived, but later began to fall apart until being dealt with by Darksied.  Where Lobo still retains this power now is unknown.

Lobo possesses an amazingly developed sense of smell, which allows him to track objects between solar systems, as well as a separate tracking ability enabling him to track an individual across galactic distances.

Lobo is a formidable combatant with expertise in multiple forms of armed and unarmed combat. His favorite weapon is a large titanium alloy chain he keeps wrapped around his right wrist with a large gutting hook connected at the end, which he typically uses in hand to hand combat. At times, he also uses high-grade explosives and advanced firearms.

Despite his violent and loutish nature, Lobo seems to have a genius-level intellect in matters of destruction and violence. He can create complex virulent agents and the necessary antidotes to them such as the one he let loose on Czarnia, resulting in the deaths of the entire population in the span of one week.  He was also able to scavenge parts from a destroyed time hopper and attach them to his own bike, producing a working time machine.

It is not fully known the extent to which his powers are common for his race or unique to him. In the miniseries ''The Last Czarnian'' and elsewhere, it is stated that the cloning and healing abilities are traits possessed by all Czarnians, as is the apparent ability to survive in the vacuum of space.

Lobo is in possession of a Red Lantern power ring given him by Atrocitus similar to that of a Green Lantern, save that it is powered by rage rather than willpower. The full extent of a red power ring's powers has not been revealed, but it is stated in Final Crisis: Rage of the Red Lanterns that the red ring acts as their heart and pumps their rage-tainted blood out of their body through their mouth. While initially unable to do so, Atrocitus learned to create red light constructs after observing the other lanterns during the Blackest Night. It is also shown that the ring's red energy corrupts the auras of other power rings and burns them away, possibly corrupting the ring beyond the ability for a Lantern to use. However, the Red Lantern's corruptive energy can be overcome and purified by the Blue Lantern's energies. With the exception of the Red Lantern leader Atrocitus, Red Lantern power rings reduce their wielders to mindless raging beasts, leaving them unable to create and maintain energy constructs as Green and Blue Lanterns do. It is as yet unclear if this will be the case for Lobo and if he will be able to create these energy constructs in the same manner as Atrocitus, or if he will even use the ring at all.

==In other media==
===Television===
[[Image:Lobo.png|right|thumb|185px|Lobo as he appears in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]''.]]
* Lobo first appeared on the small screen in the [[DC Animated Universe]] series ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' voiced by [[Brad Garrett]]. As in the comics, Lobo possesses exceptional strength and durability, as well as his usual over-the-top arsenal of weapons. However, he never displays any of the healing powers or advanced senses that he possesses in the comics, although he also never sustains injuries as severe as he does in the comics, likely due to differences in television standards and practices. Lobo's gutting hook is used only twice in his appearances in ''Superman: The Animated Series'' episode "The Main Man," and it is not used for combative purposes, due to SAP as well as difficulty animating the weapon. He mostly uses a crowbar for bludgeoning his opposition. In the episode "The Main Man", Lobo has been hired by an alien named the "Preserver" to capture Superman and add him to the Preserver's collection of rare and endangered species, but the Preserver decides to add Lobo to his collection as well, since Lobo was also the last of his own race. Superman and Lobo join forces to escape. In return, Lobo promises to leave Earth alone. Lobo briefly appears in "Warrior Queen" in which [[Maxima (comics)|Maxima]] falls in love with Superman. After Superman leaves, Lobo arrives in Maxima's throne room with a bounty on De'Cine and Maxima starts to get obsessed with Lobo.

* In 1999, ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' writer Boyd Kirkland developed a new ''Lobo'' series for [[Kids' WB]] with artist [http://stevenegordon.com/presentation_art/lobo.html Steven Gordon]. The series never went into production, as the network passed on it in a last-minute schedule announcement that year, to the surprise of the production team{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}. The series was instead adapted into an [[#Webseries|online cartoon]].

* Lobo eventually returns to Earth in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' episode "Hereafter" with Brad Garrett reprising his role. Believing that Superman has died, Lobo wants to join the Justice League, insisting that only he could take Superman's place. The League reluctantly allow Lobo to help them for a short time while they deal with a large number of supervillains running amok in Metropolis. In the end, Superman returns and fires Lobo on the basis that he is not Justice League material. 

* Lobo makes a cameo appearance in the non DCAU show ''[[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)|Legion of Super Heroes]]'' episode "Legacy".

===Film===
[[Image:LoboLive.jpg|thumb|right|185px|[[Andrew Bryniarski]] as "Lobo" in the AFI student film ''The Lobo Paramilitary Christmas Special''.]]
* In 2002, Scott Leberecht directed a film adaptation of ''The Lobo Paramilitary Christmas Special'' as part of the [[American Film Institute]]'s director's studies program. [[Andrew Bryniarski]] stars as Lobo, with [[Tom Gibis]] as the [[Easter Bunny]] and Michael V. Allen as [[Santa Claus]]. The film was made with a budget of $2,400, although many professionals donated time and effort. It premiered at the AFI in May 2002. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9ooZYjF0mI]

* In September 2009, [[Warner Bros.]] announced that [[Guy Ritchie]] would direct a live-action adaptation featuring the comic book character. ''Variety'' described the premise: "Lobo is a seven-foot tall, blue-skinned, indestructible and heavily muscled anti-hero who drives a pimped out motorcycle, and lands on Earth in search of four fugitives who are bent on wreaking havoc. Lobo teams with a small town teenage girl to stop the creatures."  Ritchie was scheduled to begin production of ''Lobo'' in early 2010 and bring an "irreverent, gruff tone" to the film as he did with previous films ''[[Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels]]'' and ''[[Snatch (film)|Snatch]]''.  The studio was aiming for a PG-13 rating from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]].<ref>{{cite journal | last=Fleming | first=Mike | url=http://weblogs.variety.com/bfdealmemo/2009/09/ritchie-locked-for-lobo.html?nid=2854 | title=Ritchie Locked for Lobo | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=September&nbsp;2, 2009 | accessdate=September&nbsp;2, 2009 }}</ref> In early 2010 it was reported that Ritchie had left the project in order to pursue working on a [[sequel]] to his hit film ''[[Sherlock Holmes (2009 film)|Sherlock Holmes]]'' instead. The future of the ''Lobo'' film is currently unknown. <ref>http://www.filmjunk.com/2010/01/27/guy-ritchie-leaves-lobo-to-focus-on-sherlock-holmes-2/</ref>

* In the [[Direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]] film ''[[Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths]]'', an [[Earth-Three]] version of Lobo appears, called Warwolf. He is first seen visually under a [[Computer font|computer display]], listing everyone employed under which corresponding [[Crime Syndicate of America]] member. He is employed under [[Johnny Quick]]'s line of command. Later he has a full cameo, as [[Martian Manhunter]] and [[Flash (comics)|the Flash]] attack the Earth-Three versions of [[Green Arrow]] and [[Black Canary]]. He is seen being defeated by Martian Manhunter, and is ultimately bested when the ship he is standing on is sunk, along with Warwolf, not to be seen again for the duration of the film. This version of Lobo is seen wearing his custom [[leather]] vest, but wears no shirt underneath the jacket. He also seems to have a lighter voice than he is commonly depicted with. <ref>http://www.cosmicbooknews.com/articles/jlcote/</ref>

===Video games===
* In 1996, [[Ocean Software]] was developing a Lobo game for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] and the [[Sega Mega Drive|Sega Genesis]]. It was a [[fighting game]], featuring many characters from Lobo's comic stories. A 6-page preview of the game was featured in the video game magazine [[Nintendo Power]], Volume 84 (May 1996). As previewed, the game still had some [[software bug|bugs]] and lacked sound. The game was canceled before release. A prototype of the finished Sega Genesis-version has been found and a ROM image of it was released on September 15, 2009 by a Spanish Sega community.

===Webseries===
* After the cancellation of the Lobo TV series, www.loboonline.com (now moved to http://loboflash.com/ ) was launched. It featured 14 interactive webisodes as well as several other features. The official website is now gone, but the episodes can be found elsewhere online. See [http://dcanimated.wikia.com/wiki/Lobo:_Webseries the DC Animated Universe Wiki] for more details.

* A wax statue of Lobo is seen in an episode of ''[[Gotham Girls]]''.

===Books===
Lobo is the main character of the novel ''DC Universe: Last Sons'', written by Alan Grant, published in 2006. The book also features the [[Martian Manhunter]] and [[Superman]] as protagonists; all three main characters are the "last sons" of their respective races.

===Merchandise===
Lobo has only had a few items of merchandise released, most by DC Direct. The first was a 12" Vinyl figure sold at the WB Stores.The second was a plush Lobo doll. The third was a 6" scale action figure which came with a hook and chain, Dawg, his bike and a spare set of hands to hold the handlebars. The fourth, part of the Reactivated line, is the 6" scale action figure with a new head sculpt and paint job, with a new chain, no Dawg, no bike, and no extra hands. DC Direct's Minimate line will have a Lobo figure as part of its seventh wave. Mattel has also made a Lobo action figure (complete with gun, chain and Dawg), for the DC Universe Classics line. He was available exclusively at the 2008 San Diego Comic Con, and then for a short period of time on Mattel's online collector store, Matty Collector.
