'''Lobo''' is a [[DC Comics]] [[antihero]]. Created by writer [[Roger Slifer]] and artist [[Keith Giffen]], he first appeared in ''[[Omega Men]]'' #3 (1983).

An alien from the planet [[Czarnia]] who works as an intergalactic [[mercenary]]. Although introduced as a hardened rarely used noir villain in the eighties, Lobo languished in limbo until the early 1990s when he was revived as a one-note gag. Lobo enjoyed a short run as one of DC’s most popular characters throughout the nineties.

The nineties version of Lobo was apparently intended to be an over-the-top [[parody]] of [[Marvel Comics]] antihero [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] (ironically in an issue of [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]], another Marvel series, Lobo himself was parodied in the likeness of Dirty Wolff, a large blue skinned man who drove a demonic motorcycle. Wolff's face was obscured by a muzzle over the course of the issue, at the end of which he was killed in an explosion.) The modern version of Lobo has the dress and attitude of a [[caricature|caricatured]] version of the [[Hells Angels]] and has an extreme love of bloodshed and destruction. He has been featured in a number of [[comic book]]s noteworthy for their ironic portrayals of over-the-top violence. 

"I have no idea why Lobo took off," Giffen said "I came up with him as an indictment of the [[Punisher]], [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], bad ass hero prototype and somehow he caught on as the high violence poster boy. Go figure."[http://www.newsarama.com/images/interviews/2006/giffen/GiffenBio.htm] (This quote refers to how Giffen wrote Lobo in the nineties. Roger Slifer as the writer of Omega Men #3 created Lobo's eighties incarnation.)

Lobo has made a few appearances in the animated series of the 1990s/2000s-era [[DC animated universe]]. At one point, an animated series and [[video game]] starring the character were to be released but were cancelled.

==Publication history==
Lobo was originally a regular character in [[Keith Giffen]] and [[Roger Slifer]]’s [[Green Lantern]] [[spin-off]] ''[[Omega Men]].'' When the series ''Omega Men'' (where he was originally called a Velorpian whose race had been exterminated by Psions, not a Czarnian) was disrupted in 1988, Lobo became a regular character in ''[[L.E.G.I.O.N.]]'' and its successor series ''[[R.E.B.E.L.S.]]'' until 1990, when he appeared in his own [[miniseries]], ''Lobo: The Last Czarnian'', by writer [[Alan Grant]] and artist [[Simon Bisley]].

Grant's humor and Bisley's art helped to make this four-issue series a hit, leading to many subsequent miniseries and specials. These include ''Lobocop'' (a [[RoboCop]] parody), ''Blazing Chain of Love'' (in which he is sent on a job to a [[harem]]), ''Paramilitary Christmas Special'' (in which he is contracted by the [[Easter Bunny]] to assassinate [[Santa Claus]]}, ''Infanticide'' (where he kills his daughter and all of his other bastard offspring that she has gathered to try to kill him), ''Convention Special'' (a send-up of [[comic book conventions]]) and ''Un[[American Gladiators]]'' (in which Lobo takes part in a deadly televised [[game show]]). Lobo also starred in his own title for 64 issues, from 1993 to 1999. 

Throughout, Lobo has guest-starred regularly in other series, even in cross-company interactions with such non-DC characters as [[The Mask]], [[Judge Dredd]], and [[the Authority]]. During the [[DC vs. Marvel]] crossover series, he fought [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] and lost due to popular vote by real-life fans.

In the Lobo series and [[miniseries]], everything is excessive, from the main character's perversions, mindless violence, and vocabulary to the <!--muted -- NOTE: "muted" means quiet or toned-down. Is that really the right word?--> colors and the grotesque graphics. He commonly refers to "do-gooder" superheroes as "The Big Cheese". Everything in the series is laughable (in the sense of being ridiculous, if not always amusing), even his profanities ("[[Frag (slang)|Frag]]", "[[Feetal's Giz]]" and "Bastich"), which are used to replace vocabulary unwanted by a family-friendly DC and to satirize similar expressions in other comics.

==Background==
Lobo is a [[Czarnia]]n (originally a Velorpian in the Omega Men series), possessing exceptional strength and fortitude. He enjoys nothing better than mindless violence and intoxication. Killing is an end in itself: His name is [[Khund]]ian for "he who devours your entrails and thoroughly enjoys it". He is also arrogant and self-centered, focusing almost solely on his own pleasures, although he proudly lives up to his word. Lobo is the last of his kind, having committed complete genocide by killing all the other Czarnians for fun (his previous origin was that Psions had exterminated his race). Lobo cannot stay dead, as both [[Heaven]] and [[Hell]] threw him out as referenced in his origin retelling in issue #17 of the weekly DC series 52. <!--Syntax seems off here. What does this sentence mean?: "At glimpses of his youth in the ''Lobo'' [[miniseries]], Lobo had encounters with science experiments such as developing a plague."-->

[[Image:omegamen_03.jpg|right|thumb|190px|The first appearance of Lobo.]]

Lobo's friends include a [[bulldog]] named Dawg, that he often claims isn't his when it gets into trouble, and Ramona a bail bondswoman/hairdresser. Dawg was stomped to death by Lobo in ''Lobo #58'' in which he claims to [[Superman]] it's not his for the final time.  His enemies include the do-gooder superhero parody [[Goldstar (DC Comics)|Goldstar]]; [[Loo (comics)|Loo]] as well as [[Vril Dox]]; [[Bludhound]]; [[Etrigan|Etrigan the Demon]]; and [[General Glory]]. Lobo generally tries to kill anyone he's hired to capture, including his fourth-grade teacher named Miss Tribb, his children, [[Santa Claus]], and [[God]]. [[Simon Bisley]]'s dark humor fits well within the pages of his artwork by having countless mutilations of background characters occurring in each panel.

Physically, Lobo resembles a chalk-white human male with blood-red [[pupil]]less eyes surrounded by black [[mascara]]-like patches.  Like many comic book characters Lobo's body is highly muscularly developed in all of his appearances. Although he was originally portrayed as having neatly trimmed purple-grey hair, this was soon redesigned to be a long, straggly, grey-black mane; and more recently into [[dreadlocks]].  Similarly, the orange-and-purple leotard he wore in his first few appearances has long since been replaced by black leather [[biker]] gear, which more recently has been replaced with both the robes of his office and pirate inspired gear. His arsenal include numerous guns, and a chain with a hook on his right arm. Extra arsenal may include "frag grenades", and giant carving blades.

In addition to his ever-present lust for violence, Lobo also has a strict personal code of honor — he will never violate the ''letter'' of an agreement, although he may gleefully disregard its ''spirit''. Also, he is extremely protective of space dolphins.

===History===
Lobo acted as an independent bounty hunter until he was tricked by Vril Dox into nominally joining his interstellar police force, L.E.G.I.O.N.,  although he continued solo activity (which seemed to often bring him to earth and in conflict with its heroes.)

{{spoilers}}

After an extended hiatus, Lobo has recently reappeared in mainstream DC continuity encountering the heroes stranded in space ([[Adam Strange]], [[Animal Man]], and [[Starfire]]) after the events of [[Infinite Crisis]].  To everyone's surprise he did not kill them, apparently contending he had found religion, becoming the spiritual leader of the whole sector 3500, left in shambles by a still unknown assailant. He's the current caretaker of the [[Emerald Eye]] of Ekron.

==Powers and abilities==
His superhuman (or super-Czarnian) abilities include enormous strength (which, however, seems to vary greatly), the ability to survive unaided in space, a [[healing factor]] that heals ludicrous amounts of damage, an equally ludicrous sense of smell which allows him to track objects between solar systems, and the ability to regrow an entire new Lobo from each drop of his own spilled blood. This last ability was removed by Vril Dox. However, Lobo was seen regenerating out of a pool of blood in ''52'' #20 and Lobo himself has supposedly died many times. He still retains his ban from both Heaven and Hell, thus immortal.

Despite his violent and loutish nature, Lobo has displayed a genius level intellect such as when he created a virulent plague of immense proportions (and its antidote) in about a week's time, and obliterated his species when he set it loose on Czarnia.

==Li'l Lobo==
[[Image:LilLobo01.jpg|right|thumb|190px|Li'l Lobo with the [[Young Justice]], in the cover for Young Justice #21. Art by Todd Nauck.]]

In 2000, Lobo was transformed into a [[teenager]] by a magical accident. In this state, he joined [[Young Justice]] and eventually accompanied them to [[Apokolips]], where he was killed in combat. However, the aforementioned magical accident had restored his ability to regrow from a single drop of blood, and millions of Lobos rushed into battle against Apokoliptian soldiers, whom the Lobos quickly defeated. The Lobos then turned on each other, until only one was left; in the process, the surviving Lobo regrew to adulthood.

An additional teenage Lobo remained however, having hidden from the fight; he rejoined Young Justice and chose to rename himself '''Slo-bo'''. Eventually, this clone began to degrade, becoming blind and so grew on the brink of death. Before he could die, however, [[Darkseid]] teleported him to the headquarters of Young Justice [[DC One Million|One Million]] in the 853rd Century, turning him into a (still aware) statue in the process.

==Ultimate Bastich==
In the two-part ''Lobo vs The Mask'' crossover, Lobo is hired by a surviving council of numerous devastated planets to hunt down a terrible killer, the same one who destroyed those worlds. His reward, a billion credits. His trail led to Earth, Lobo encounters the current wearer of the ancient mask, the resulting battle destroying Manhattan and leaving Lobo nothing but a severed head, waiting for his body to re-grow.

Big Head, convincing Lobo he wants the previous mask wearer, agrees to a team-up to hunt the "Ultimate Bastich" down. Big Head leads Lobo on a chase to nowhere, killing even more and blowing up a solar system in the process. Fed up with Big Head, Lobo uses a special "guilt grenade" to force the wearer to remove the mask so that he can use it himself.

Lobo promptly kills an entire intergalactic bar of aliens, and is sucked into a wormhole on his ride through space. Landing in parts unknown, Lobo/Mask heads to a single planet where, crashing the 400th annual Feel Good Games, he insults a king, and proceeds to kill numerous people. A crayon drawing left on his bike with the words "YOU SMELL" incurs his wrath, and he destroys numerous planets hunting down the one who drew the insulting picture.

Waking up one day, Lobo finds himself back on Earth, and realizes the mask used him. Tossing it away, he proceeds to leave only to pass himself arriving on Earth- as it turns out, the wormhole sent him back in time roughly one month. He had been hired to hunt himself, and the alley where he dumped the mask was the same alley where the pickpocket would find it in part 1. However, Lobo breaks the time loop, literally turning himself in as he shaved the other Lobo's head and painted him green for the reward money. Meanwhile, Big Head, realizing that Lobo has broken the loop, decides to have fun of its own on Earth.

==Lobo the Duck==
[[Lobo the Duck]] is an incarnation of Lobo and [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Howard the Duck]] in the [[Amalgam Comics]] company crossovers. The big arm is derived from Lobo's alternative self, Bimbo, of ''Lobo's Back'' #2. He fights characters of DC and Marvel combinations such as the Kidnoids, and Ambush the Lunatik. His friends include [[Impossible Dawg]] and [[Doctor Strangefate]].

==In other media==
===Animated Lobo===
[[Image:Lobo.gif|right|thumb|190px|Lobo as he appears on [[Superman: The Animated Series]].]]
{{spoiler}}
Lobo first appeared on the small screen in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]''. In the episode "Main Man", Lobo (voiced by [[Brad Garrett]]) was hired by an alien named the "Preserver" to capture Superman and add him to the Preserver's collection of rare and endangered species. Lobo headed straight for Earth and started firing in the middle of a police station until [[Superman]] eventually showed up to confront him. The two battled all over downtown [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], a battle which ended with Lobo leaving Earth supposedly to "take five".

Superman followed after Lobo into space, where Lobo lured Superman into a trap set by the Preserver. Superman was eventually captured and placed in a specialized cage, so that the Preserver might preserve Superman as the last remnant of the [[Krypton (planet)|Krypton]]ian race. However, the Preserver then decided to add Lobo to his collection as well, since Lobo was also technically the last of his own race. Superman and Lobo eventually joined forces to escape the Preserver, and in return, Lobo promised to leave Earth alone.

Lobo also briefly appeared in another ''Superman: The Animated Series'' episode in which [[Maxima (comics)|Maxima]] falls in love with Superman.

Lobo eventually returned to Earth, however, in the ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'' episode "[[Hereafter (Justice League episode)|Hereafter.]]" Believing that Superman had died, Lobo wanted to join the Justice League, insisting that only he could take Superman's place. Lobo seemed to be motivated more out of [[ego]] and a chance "to bust heads" than any actual desire to do good or help others. In spite of his obvious violent tendencies and his lack of any redeeming moral virtues, the League allowed Lobo to help them for a short time while they dealt with a large number of supervillains running amok in Metropolis in response to Superman's apparent death. Lobo battled and defeated the supervillain [[Kalibak]], primarily by piling more & more cars on top of him until he said "Uncle". In the end, Superman returned to the ranks of the League, and Lobo, his membership rejected, was forced to leave. Lobo has not reappeared since the League removed him. Brad Garrett reprised his voice role.

As in the comics, Lobo possessed exceptional strength and durability as well as an arsenal of weapons. However, he never displayed any of the healing powers or advanced senses that he possesses in the comics.  (The failure to display healing powers almost certainly stemmed at least partially from the potential censorship difficulties of giving Lobo the sort of graphic, gory injuries he regularly sustained in the comics.)  

In 1999, ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' writer Boyd Kirkland developed a new ''Lobo'' series for [[Kids' WB]] with artist [http://stevenegordon.com/presentation_art/lobo.html Steven Gordon]. The series never went into production, as the network passed on it in a last-minute schedule announcement that year, to the surprise of the production team.

===Merchandise===
Lobo has only had a few bits of merchandise released, all by DC Direct. The first was a plush Lobo doll. The second was a 6" scale action figure which came with a hook and chain, Dawg, his bike and a spare set of hands to hold the handlebars. The third, part of the Reactivated line, is simply the old action figure with a new head sculpt and paint job, with a new chain, no Dawg, no bike, and no extra hands. 

===Video games===
{{unreferenced|date=October 2006}}
Lobo was announced as a 2D fighting game for the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis. It is believed the game was cancelled. Part of the confusion may be due to the fact that ''Nintendo Power'' magazine ran an article on the game, complete with full move lists for the characters.  "Gamepro" magazine also ran a negative review. EGM also did a review of the game, giving it very negative scores. Ironically, due to the fact that EGM did review Lobo, it can be safe to assume that the game was already complete. If this is not true, then EGM reviewed an incomplete version of the game, blatantly ignoring their own rule of only reviewing finished games or games with completed code.

Kemco had announced a PlayStation 2 and Xbox game, initially set to be released in 2004. However, the game received numerous delays, then a final cancellation in 2005. Kemco admitted that they had done no work on the game. Despite this however, some game store chains still insist it has a release date.
