'''Lobo''' is a  [[alien]] [[mercenary]] [[comic book]] [[anti-hero]] (arguably a [[superhero]]) created by [[Keith Giffen]] (artist) and  [[Roger Slifer]] ([[writer]]). He first appeared in the [[DC Comics|DC]]'s [[Omega Men]] series in 1983; although intended to be an over-the-top [[parody]] of [[Marvel Comics]] [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], the character became hugely popular - more so than his creators had intended for a one-note gag character. When the [[Omega Men]] series was disrupted in 1988, Lobo became a regular character in [[L.E.G.I.O.N.]] and its successor series [[R.E.B.E.L.S.]] (both set in space like Omega Men), until 1990 when he appeared in his own self-titled series  ''Lobo: The Last Czarnian'', under the hands of [[Simon Bisley]] and [[Alan Grant]].

Alan Grant humor and Simon Bisley strength-defying, but caricaturistic spanned designs made of this first four-issues mini-series a hit, which was followed by many more mini-series and specials. He kept his own title for 64 issues, from 1993 to 1999.

During this period, and even since the cancellation of his regular series, Lobo guest-starred regularly in other series. He's even interacted with non-DC characters, such as [[The Mask]] and [[Judge Dredd]], and during the ''DC vs. Marvel'' series he even fought Wolverine - and lost.

== The character ==
Lobo is a Czarnian, possessing exceptional strength and fortitude. Lobo has always been a bad man, really mean who likes nothing better than mindless violence. Killing is an end in itself. He is also arrogant, self-centered, focusing solely on his own pleasures. Lobo is the last of his kind: he killed all the other Czarnians. And he cannot be killed; both Heaven and Hell threw him out.

In ''Lobo'', everything is excessive, from the main character's sexual perversion, his mindless violence, his vocabulary to the muted colors and the grotesque graphics.  Everything in the series is laughable (in the sense of being ridiculous, if not always amusing), even his profanities ("Frag" and "Bastich"), which are used to replace vocabulary unwanted by a family-friendly DC and to satirize similar expressions in other comics.
