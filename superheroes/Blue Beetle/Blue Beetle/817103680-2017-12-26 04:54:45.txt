'''Blue Beetle''' is the name of three [[fiction]]al [[superhero]]es who appear in a number of [[United States|American]] [[comic book]]s published by a variety of companies since 1939. The most recent of the companies to own rights to the Blue Beetle is [[DC Comics]] who bought the rights to the character in 1983, using the name for three distinct characters over the years.

The original Blue Beetle was created by [[Fox Comics]] and later owned by [[Charlton Comics]]. The first Beetle was '''[[#Dan Garret|Dan Garret]]''' (later spelled '''Dan Garrett'''), who initially gained super powers from a special vitamin, which was later changed to gaining powers from a "sacred scarab". The original Blue Beetle was featured not only in his own comic but also a weekly [[Golden Age of Radio|radio serial]].

The second Blue Beetle was created by Charlton and later taken over by [[DC Comics]], the successor to Dan Garrett known as '''[[Ted Kord]]'''. Kord "jumped" to the DC Comics universe during the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]] alongside a number of other Charlton Comics characters. The second Blue Beetle later starred in his own 24 issue comic. Kord never had any super powers but used science to create various devices to help him fight crime. He became a member of the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]] and was later killed during DC Comics' [[Infinite Crisis]] cross over.

The third Blue Beetle, created by DC Comics,  is '''[[Jaime Reyes]]''', a teenager who discovered that the original Blue Beetle scarab morphed into a battle suit allowing him to fight crime and travel in space. Over the years Reyes became a member of the [[Teen Titans]] and starred in two Blue Beetle comic series. In DC Comic's "New 52" reboot, Jaime Reyes was the primary Blue Beetle character, only occasionally referring to past versions. However, with the subsequent continuity revision "DC Rebirth", the previous versions were restored.

==Publication history==
The original Blue Beetle, '''Dan Garret''', [[First appearance|first appeared]] in [[Fox Comics]]' ''[[Mystery Men Comics]]'' #1 (cover-dated August 1939), with art by Charles Nicholas Wojtkoski (as [[Charles Nicholas#Charles Wojtkoski|Charles Nicholas]]); though the [[Grand Comics Database]] tentatively credits [[Will Eisner]] as the scripter.<ref>Wojtkoski's family has supplied the online comics encyclopedia "The Lambiek Comiclopedia" with documentation to support the overall Wojtkoski credit. Another artist, [[Charles Nicholas#Chuck Cuidera|Charles Nicholas Cuidera]], also drew Blue Beetle stories later, and has claimed to have been the creator, but comics historians credit Wojtkoski.

Blue Beetle starred in a comic book series, [[comic strip]] and [[radio]] serial, but like most [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] superheroes, he fell into obscurity in the 1950s. The comic book series saw a number of anomalies in publication: 19 issues, #12 through #30, were published through [[Holyoke Publishing]]; no issue #43 was published; publication frequency varied throughout the run; and there were gaps where issues were not published, with large ones occurring in early 1947 and between mid-1948 and early 1950.

In the mid-1950s, Fox Comics went out of business and sold the rights to the Blue Beetle to [[Charlton Comics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toonopedia.com/foxfeatr.htm|title=Fox Feature Syndicate|work=[[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]]|accessdate=September 13, 2010}}</ref> That company published a few sporadic adventures of the Golden Age character before revamping the hero in 1964.<ref>The two initial Charlton runs were:

Two of the attempts retained the numbering of a previous title. These also were eventually replaced with new titles that carried on the numbering.

==Dan Garret==

===Fox Feature Syndicate and Holyoke Publishing===
[[Image:Blue Beetle Mystery Men.jpg|thumb|left|The first appearance of the Blue Beetle, ''Mystery Men Comics'' #1 (1939). Art by Charles Nicholas.]]
The original [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] Blue Beetle was '''Dan Garret''',<ref name="ref4">In the earliest Golden Age appearances and during the mid-1960s run by writer-artist [[Steve Ditko]], the original Blue Beetle was referred to as Dan "Garret", spelled with one "t".</ref> son of a police officer killed by a criminal. This [[Fox Feature Syndicate]] version of the character debuted in ''Mystery Men Comics'' #1 (August 1939), and began appearing in his own 60-issue series shortly thereafter. Fox Feature Syndicate sponsored a "Blue Beetle Day" at the [[1939 New York World's Fair]] on August 7, 1940, beginning at 10:30&nbsp;a.m. and including 300 children in relay-race finals at the Field of Special Events, following preliminaries in New York City parks. The race was broadcast over radio station [[WMCA (AM)|WMCA]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Program Today at the World's Fair|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 7, 1940|accessdate=April 7, 2013|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0A10FF385A11728DDDAE0894D0405B8088F1D3}} Abstract; full article requires fee or subscription</ref>

Rookie patrolman Dan Garret originally fought crime as the Blue Beetle without the benefit of superhuman abilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toonopedia.com/beetle1.htm|title=The Blue Beetle (1939)|work=Don Markstein's Toonopedia|accessdate=September 13, 2010}}</ref> Garret later donned a bulletproof blue costume (described by Garret as being [[Mail (armour)|chain-mail]] made of a [[cellulose]] material which was "as thin and light as silk but stronger than steel") and temporarily gained [[superhuman]] strength and stamina by ingesting the mysterious "Vitamin 2X".<ref>{{cite comic|artist=Nicholas, Charles|title=Mystery Men Comics|issue=13|date=August 1940|publisher=[[Fox Feature Syndicate]]}}</ref> Like the [[Green Hornet]], the Blue Beetle would use his signature scarab symbol to bedevil criminals, leaving it to be easily found, hanging it down into a room on a string and even projecting its enlarged image onto a wall with a flashlight.

The supporting cast remained fairly stable throughout this original run and included Joan Mason, a beautiful blond [[reporter]] for the ''Daily Blade'' who would ultimately star in her own backup stories, and Mike Mannigan, Dan's stereotypically [[Ireland|Irish]] partner on the force who believed despite all evidence to the contrary that the Blue Beetle was a criminal and was always trying to arrest him with little success. Dr. Franz, a local [[pharmacist]] and inventor of the bulletproof suit and 2-X formula (as well as many other handy gadgets, including a [[mobile phone|portable wireless telephone]] a good half century before they came into common use), played a large role in the early issues but eventually faded from the cast. The Beetle also had a short-lived spunky kid sidekick in the form of Sparkington J. Northrup (Sparky), who originally wore an abbreviated version of the Beetle's costume but later went into action wearing his regular clothes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wonderworldcomics.com/bluebeetle/Origin.html|title=The Origin and Legend of the Golden Age Blue Beetle|work=WonderworldComics.com|accessdate=September 18, 2010}}</ref>

During [[World War II]], Dan Garret became a government agent who was often sent overseas on secret missions, but after peace was declared he returned to his old role of neighborhood cop.  The Blue Beetle's powers slowly increased over time with him eventually gaining the ability to fly and [[x-ray vision]] among other bizarre talents that changed from issue to issue at the whim of the writers.  However, when superheroes fell out of vogue in the late 1940s, Fox started to downplay his superheroic aspects and his superhuman abilities were removed, and his now considerably darker adventures became full of [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] violence and scantily-clad women until he was eventually relegated to hosting [[True crime (genre)|true crime]] stories before the character went on hiatus.

A popular character in his era, the Blue Beetle had his own short-lived [[comic strip]], drawn by a [[pseudonym]]ous [[Jack Kirby]] and others, and a [[Old-time radio|radio serial]] that ran for 48 thirteen-minute episodes.

===Charlton Comics===
[[Image:Blue Beetle v3 1.jpg|thumb|left|''Blue Beetle'' vol. 2,#1 (June 1964). Cover art by [[Frank McLaughlin (artist)|Frank McLaughlin]].]]
[[Charlton Comics]] obtained the rights to the Blue Beetle and reprinted some stories in its [[anthology]] titles and in a four-issue ''Blue Beetle'' reprint series numbered 18–21.

In 1964, during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] of comics, Charlton revised the character for a new Blue Beetle series. Charlton's new Blue Beetle retained the original's name (adding a second "t"), but none of his powers or origin, making him a different character. This Beetle was [[Archaeology|archaeologist]] Dan Garrett, who obtained a number of superhuman powers (including super strength and vision, flight, and the ability to generate energy blasts) from a mystical [[Scarab (artifact)|scarab]] he found during a dig in [[Egypt]], where it had been used to imprison an evil mummified Pharaoh.<ref name="dc-ency">{{cite book|last=Beatty|first=Scott|author-link=Scott Beatty|contribution=Blue Beetle|editor-last=Dougall|editor-first=Alastair|title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia|page=57|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|location=London|year=2008|isbn=0-7566-4119-5}}</ref> He would transform into the Blue Beetle by saying the words "Kaji Dha!" This version, by writer [[Joe Gill]] and artist [[Tony Tallarico]], was played at least initially for [[Camp (style)|camp]], with stories like "The Giant Mummy Who was Not Dead". The Charlton Dan Garrett version of the Blue Beetle ran only until 1966 before his replacement debuted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toonopedia.com/beetle2.htm|title=The Blue Beetle (1964)|work=Don Markstein's Toonopedia|accessdate=September 13, 2010|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63gvVx8h0?url=http://www.toonopedia.com/beetle2.htm|archivedate=December 5, 2011|deadurl=yes|df=}}</ref>

===AC Comics===
Both Blue Beetles (indeed, all ''three'' Blue Beetles) reappeared in the third issue of ''[[Americomics]]'', a title published by [[AC Comics]] in 1983/1984. In the first story in this issue, Ted Kord fought a bogus Dan Garrett, but the second story was more significant. It revealed that the original 1940s Dan was reincarnated as the Silver Age version (minus his memories of his earlier existence) by some unspecified "gods", presumably the ones responsible for his mystic scarab. The gods subsequently resurrected Dan again and sent him off to save Ted Kord's life (leaving him a note saying simply, "Try not to get killed this time") After this adventure, Kord turned the Blue Beetle name back over to Dan. ''Americomics'' was canceled after issue #6, and so far this story has never been referenced by any other publisher.

===DC Comics===
The Charlton version of Dan Garrett was spotlighted in the second issue of DC's 1980s ''[[Secret Origins]]'' series, in which his origin was retold along with that of Ted Kord. Subsequent appearances by Dan Garrett (in flashback stories) include guest spots or cameos in ''[[Infinity, Inc.]]'', ''[[Captain Atom]]'', ''[[Justice League|JLA: Year One]]'', and ''Legends of the DC Universe''.

The character briefly returned in [[DC Comics]]' first run of ''Blue Beetle'',<ref name="BBv6i18">{{cite comic|writer=[[Len Wein|Wein, Len]]|artist=[[Paris Cullins|Cullins, Paris]]|story=...And Death Shall Have No Dominion!|title=Blue Beetle|volume=6|issue=18|date=November 1987|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref> resurrected by his mystical scarab to battle against his successor. He can also be seen in various flashback stories. His 1940s incarnation is briefly glimpsed in DC's 1993 limited series ''The Golden Age''.

===Dynamite Entertainment===
In issue #0 of the ''[[Project Superpowers]]'' miniseries, the Fox Feature Syndicate version of the Blue Beetle appeared in flashbacks (as by now the character/spelling "Dan Garret" was in the public domain).<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Alex Ross|Ross, Alex]]|cowriters=[[Jim Krueger]]|artist=Ross, Alex|story=Last Gleaming|title=[[Project Superpowers]]|issue=0|date=January 2008|publisher=[[Dynamite Entertainment]]}}</ref> To avoid trademark conflicts with DC Comics, he is referred to in this series by the nickname "Big Blue".<ref>{{cite comic|writer=Ross, Alex|cowriters=Jim Krueger|artist=Paul, Carlos|story=...Undimmed by Human Tears|title=Project Superpowers|issue=4|date=June 2008|publisher=Dynamite Entertainment}}</ref>

===Legacy===
It was eventually established that the Charlton Comics incarnation of the Dan Garrett Blue Beetle made his debut on August 14, 1939.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|cowriters=[[Jeff Katz]]|penciller=[[Dan Jurgens|Jurgens, Dan]]|inker=[[Norm Rapmund|Rapmund, Norm]]|story=52 Pick-Up, Chapter 2: Leggo My Ego|title=[[Booster Gold]]|volume=2|issue=2|date=November 2007|publisher=DC Comics}}</ref> The Jaime Reyes Blue Beetle has met Daniel's granddaughter, Danielle,<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Keith Giffen|Giffen, Keith]]|cowriters=[[John Rogers (writer)|John Rogers]]|artist=[[Duncan Rouleau|Rouleau, Duncan]]|story=Inside Man|title=Blue Beetle|volume=7|issue=9|date=January 2007|publisher=DC Comics}}</ref> and has also met Dan himself.<ref name="BGv2i6">{{cite comic|writer=Johns, Geoff|cowriters=Jeff Katz|penciller=Jurgens, Dan|inker=Rapmund, Norm|story=52 Pick-Up, Chapter 6: Meet the Beetles|title=Booster Gold|volume=2|issue=6|date=March 2008|publisher=DC Comics}}</ref>

==Ted Kord==
{{Main article|Ted Kord}}
[[Image:Blue Beetle LAW.png|thumb|left|Ted Kord as the Blue Beetle. Art by [[Dick Giordano]].]]

The replacement Blue Beetle created by Charlton Comics, and later published by [[Americomics]] and DC Comics, is '''Ted Kord''', a former student of Dan Garrett, a genius-level inventor and a gifted athlete. Kord and Garrett were investigating Kord's Uncle Jarvis when they learned Jarvis was working to create an army of androids to take over Earth. Garrett changed into Blue Beetle, but was killed in battle. As he died, he passed on to Kord the responsibility of being Blue Beetle, but was unable to pass on the mystical scarab.<ref>''Blue Beetle'' vol. 5, #2 (Charlton Comics, Aug. 1967).</ref>

Ted had the scarab for some time, but never used it. He carried it during the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' when he was chosen by the [[Monitor (comics)|Monitor]] to protect the multiple Earths, but it only reacted when he was attacked; it did not give him superpowers.

During the "[[The Death of Superman|Death of Superman]]" saga, the Blue Beetle and the other JLA members tried to stop [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]]'s path of destruction. Doomsday displayed his near-invulnerability and, while brutally defeating the League, put the Blue Beetle into a coma.<ref>''Justice League America'' #69</ref> Upon recovery, he continued his tenure with the JLA as well as its offshoot, [[Extreme Justice]].

Blue Beetle discovered a renewed [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]] organization led by [[Maxwell Lord]], with a database containing information on every metahuman on Earth. He was captured and executed with a single gunshot to the head. Before dying, he had used the scarab in an attempt to contact [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Shazam]], but was forced to leave it with the wizard [[Shazam (character)|Shazam]] in the Rock of Eternity when the wizard sent him back to [[Earth]].<ref>''[[Countdown to Infinite Crisis]]'' one-shot (May 2005)</ref>

Some time later, [[Booster Gold]], along with Jaime, Dan, and the [[Black Beetle (DC Comics)|Black Beetle]] in the guise of a Blue Beetle from the future, travels back in time to rescue Kord moments before his death.<ref name="BGv2i6"/>

'''Jaime Reyes''' is a teenager who lives in [[El Paso, Texas]], with his father, mother, and little sister; his father owns a garage and his mother is a nurse. Jaime has offered to help his father out at the garage, but his father has turned him down. He feels Jaime should enjoy his childhood for as long as he can, and should attempt to further his education. He finds the scarab in a vacant lot and it fuses with him while he sleeps.<ref>''Blue Beetle'' #1 (2006)</ref> After Booster Gold revealed Jaime's new powers to him, Jaime was swept up in the climactic battle with [[OMAC (comics)#Brother Eye|Brother Eye]] during ''[[Infinite Crisis]]''.

In ''[[Teen Titans]]'' vol. 3, #83, he takes a break from the team to be with his mother.

Jaime has a girlfriend, the young sorceress [[Traci 13]], who gets along well with Jaime's family. His large and loving family is a major source of strength and guidance for Jaime. [[Peacemaker (comics)|Christopher Smith aka the Peacemaker]] also became a mentor for the young Blue Beetle.

Jaime co-starred along with the rest of the former Justice League International in ''[[Justice League: Generation Lost]]''.

Following DC's "[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]" storyline ''Blue Beetle'' was one of 52 monthly titles launched in September 2011, again starring Jaime Reyes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/2011/06/09/blue-beetle-1/|title=BLUE BEETLE #1|work=DC Comics}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dccomics.com/blog/2011/08/17/who%25e2%2580%2599s-who-at-dc-comics-the-new-52-tony-bedard|author=David Hyde|title=Who’s Who at DC Comics-The New 52: Tony Bedard|date=August 17, 2011|accessdate=June 6, 2017}}</ref> The series was cancelled after 17 issues in January 2013.

==The scarab==
The Blue Beetle scarab, previously shown as an artifact of magic, is later [[retcon]]ned as a tool of war of the [[Reach (comics)|Reach]], an ancient race of cosmic [[wikt:marauder|marauders]]. After being defeated by the [[Guardians of the Universe]] thousands of years ago and forced into a truce, the Reach poses as benevolent aliens lending their advanced technology to budding civilizations. The scarab is a gift for that world's champion, giving him amazing powers and the knowledge of the Reach to protect his or her peers. Secretly, the scarab is part of an advanced [[Group mind (science fiction)|hive mind]], with its own artificial intelligence covertly supplanting the wearer's own. The wearer is turned into the "ultimate [[Sleeper agent|infiltrator]]", a covert agent intended to take over its own world.<ref name="BBv6i18"/>  However, the Blue Beetle Scarab is damaged and so instead of it controlling the host, it forms a symbiotic relationship with them.

In The New 52, the Reach forgoes the secrecy, and each wearer immediately becomes possessed by the scarab. It then uses its host's knowledge to decimate the world and prepare it for a full invasion by Reach forces.<ref>''Blue Beetle'' vol 2 #0 (September 2012)</ref>

In DC Universe: Rebirth, Ted Kord and Jaime Reyes believe the scarab is an alien device that bonded to Jaime's spine. Kord is fascinated by this scarab and wants to investigate the potential of it while Jaime fears it. When Jaime leaves Kord's lab to get to school, Dr. Fate appears in the lab to warn Kord that the scarab is not an alien device, but it is instead magic. This further sparks Kord's interest in the potential of the scarab.

==Other versions==

===Kingdom Come===
Blue Beetle (Ted Kord) was seen in [[Alex Ross]] and [[Mark Waid]]'s limited series ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]''. He is shown with the rest of the Charlton "Action Heroes" not as a member of [[Magog (comics)|Magog]]'s [[Justice Battalion]], but as part of [[Batman]]'s group and later of the MLF (Mankind Liberation Front). He would be shown later in the title in a suit of armor powered by the then-mystic scarab, working with Batman's team. In the novelization of the series, Batman thinks of Blue Beetle, along with [[Green Arrow]] and [[Black Canary]], as his closest (at the time) friends. Blue Beetle is killed with most of the other heroes by a nuclear explosion.

===52 Multiverse===
[[Image:Blue Beetle Elseworld.jpg|thumb|The [[Gotham by Gaslight#Countdown|Earth-19]] Blue Beetle.]]

The final issue, #52, of DC Comics' 2006/2007 year-long weekly series ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' revealed that a "[[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]]" system of [[Worlds of the 52 multiverse|52 parallel universes]], with each Earth being a different take on established DC Comics characters as featured in the mainstream continuity (designated as "New Earth") had come into existence. The Multiverse acts as a storytelling device that allows writers to introduce alternate versions of fictional characters, hypothesize "What if?" scenarios, revisit popular Elseworlds stories and allow these characters to interact with the mainstream continuity. For example, the Ted Kord of the ''Kingdom Come'' limited series is said to reside on Earth-22.

Spin-offs from the series ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]'' would introduce more alternate Blue Beetles in 2007. Earth-19 (the ''[[Gotham by Gaslight]]'' universe), set in a Victorian-like era, has its own version of Dan Garrett who in his secret identity is the leading Egyptologist at the Gotham Museum of Natural History and wears a monocle, appearing in ''The Search for Ray Palmer: Gotham by Gaslight''. The limited series ''[[Countdown: Arena]]'' depicted three more: Earth-26 Blue Beetle, a swarm of sentient insects that form a man-shaped body (calling themselves "The Scarab"), Ted of Earth-33, an anthropomorphic beetle, the pet of Mr. and Mrs. Kord, and Earth-39 Blue Beetle, a younger version of Dan Garrett, who has bonded with his scarab in the same way as Jaime Reyes.<ref>''Countdown: Arena'' #1–4 (December 2007)</ref>

A new version of the Blue Beetle known as "Blue Scarab" was shown as a member of the Justice League in the apocalyptic future depicted in ''Justice League: Generation Lost''. He is stated as being the "descendant of the Blue Beetle", and has a very alien-looking appearance.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #14 (Late January 2011)</ref>

An evil version has appeared in the [[antimatter universe of Qward]], the [[universe]] of the [[Crime Syndicate of America]], known as the Scarab.

Several incarnations of the Blue Beetle appear on ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'':

The Jaime Reyes incarnation is a featured character, with Jaime Reyes voiced by [[Will Friedle]] and the Blue Beetle Scarab voiced by [[Ioan Gruffudd]]. He appeared in the episodes "The Rise of the Blue Beetle!",<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/2008/04/batman-the-brave-and-the-bold-officially-announced-images-included/ |author= Jim Harvey |title= 'Batman: The Brave and The Bold' Officially Announced, Images Included |publisher= worldsfinestonline.com |date=April 3, 2008 |accessdate= June 5, 2017}}</ref> "Invasion of the Secret Santas!", "Fall of the Blue Beetle!", "Game Over for Owlman!",<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/bravebold/ |title= The World's Finest - Batman: The Brave and the Bold |publisher= Worldsfinestonline.com |accessdate= April 25, 2011}}</ref> "Night of the Huntress!", "The Fate of Equinox!", "Revenge of the Reach!", "Aquaman's Outrageous Adventure!", "The Power of Shazam!", "The Siege of Starro! Part One", "The Siege of Starro! Part Two", "Cry Freedom Fighters!", "Darkseid Descending!", "Shadow of the Bat!", "Time Out for Vengeance!", and "Crisis: 22,300 Miles Above Earth!".

The Ted Kord version appears in the episodes "Fall of the Blue Beetle!" and "Menace of the Madniks!", voiced by actor [[Wil Wheaton]].<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.wired.com/geekdad/2009/01/wil-wheaton-tak/ |title= Wil Wheaton Takes the Blue Beetle Back to His Silver Age Roots on ''Batman: The Brave and the Bold'' |work= Wired |accessdate=September 13, 2010 |first=Ken |last= Denmead |date= January 17, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{citation |url= http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1728263/|title="Batman: The Brave and the Bold" Menace of the Madniks! |publisher= [[Internet Movie Database]] |accessdate= June 3, 2011}}</ref>

In "Rise of the Blue Beetle", an alien Blue Beetle was alluded to have previously fought [[Kanjar Ro]] but died in the battle. Dan Garrett makes a brief, non-voiced appearance in "Fall of the Blue Beetle!" as [[Batman]] narrates about the Blue Beetles to Jaime Reyes and "Menace of the Madniks!" displayed his Blue Beetle suit next to Ted Kord's suit.

====''Young Justice''====
The Jaime Reyes version of Blue Beetle appears in [[Young Justice (TV series)#'The Team' subsequent members|season 2]] of ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'', voiced by actor [[Eric Lopez (actor)|Eric Lopez]]. In a [[running gag]], Jaime can often be seen rejecting the Blue Beetle Scarab's (also voiced by Lopez) more violent and bloodthirsty suggestions ("No, it would ''not'' have been easier to just vaporize him back in the diner!"), which confuses those around him as it looks like he's talking to himself. Much of season 2's main story arc also revolves around Jaime's main antagonists, the Reach.

Dan Garrett, the original Blue Beetle, appears in a non-speaking cameo in the episode "Failsafe", in which several scenes depict the members of the [[Justice Society of America]], in 1939. Dan appears among several of the most prominent members of the team, such as [[Alan Scott|Green Lantern]], [[Doctor Fate]], and [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Flash]]. The episode "Intervention" later tells the full story of the scarab: ancient Bialyan mystics deactivated its Reach control centuries ago, and it lay dormant until it was discovered by Dan Garrett, who fused with it to become the first Blue Beetle. His successor and protege, the technological genius Ted Kord, was able to recognize the Scarab as a potentially dangerous piece of alien technology, and thus made use of his own inventions as a hero. Kord later lost his life in a battle with [[Deathstroke]] and [[Sportsmaster]] upon discovering [[Secret Society of Super Villains|The Light]] planned to steal and reactivate the Scarab. Jaime came across the Scarab just after Ted Kord's death, and became the third Blue Beetle believing it was Kord's own invention. He was recruited into the Justice League's teenage strike team, where conflicts with the Reach led him to discover the Scarab's true origin and purpose, but his attempts to remove it were unable to keep his body from being completely controlled by it. Some of the Team made a separate discovery of a ritual that could remove the Reach's control over the Scarab, and then kept the knowledge quiet while Doctor Fate taught Zatanna the ritual, so the Team could once again deactivate the Scarab to allow Jaime to resume control. The Scarab then cooperates with Jaime without much resistance, preferring their partnership over enslavement.

====The Electric Company====
On the [[PBS]] children's educational series ''[[The Electric Company (1971 TV series)|The Electric Company]]'', the Blue Beetle was a bumbling [[superhero]] (played by [[Jim Boyd (actor)|Jim Boyd]]) who would often make matters worse instead of better. He wore a mask, a hood with antennae, wings, tennis shoes, boxer shorts, and a T-shirt bearing the name "Blue Beetle". Outside the name, the character is unrelated to any of the comic book versions.

====''Justice League Action''====
Jaime Reyes appears in the animated series, ''[[Justice League Action]]'', voiced again by [[Jake T. Austin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/conroy-hamill-return-justice-league-action-cartoon-network|title=Conroy, Hamill Return for "Justice League Action" on Cartoon Network|author=Albert Ching|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=January 29, 2016|accessdate=June 6, 2017}}</ref>

* Blue Beetle was referenced in the 7th episode of ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'' when Kendra asks Ray about his favorite color, blue, and his favorite [[Beatle]], he does not have one.

====''Smallville''====
At the [[San Diego Comic-Con]] 2010, it was announced that Jaime Reyes would appear in the episode "Booster" in [[Smallville (season 10)|the final season]] of ''[[Smallville]]'', where the scarab bonds with Jaime who is saved by Booster Gold. It was confirmed that Ted Kord would make an appearance as well, searching for the lost, and apparently extremely dangerous Blue Beetle scarab.
