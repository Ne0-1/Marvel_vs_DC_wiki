'''Blue Beetle''' is the name of four [[fiction]]al [[superhero]]es that appear in [[United States|American]] [[comic book]]s published by a variety of companies since 1939.

==Publication history==
The original Blue Beetle, '''Dan Garret''', [[First appearance|first appeared]] in [[Fox Comics]]' ''Mystery Men Comics'' #1 (cover-dated August 1939), with art by Charles Nicholas Wojtkoski (as [[Charles Nicholas#Charles Wojtkoski|Charles Nicholas]]); though the [[Grand Comics Database]] tentatively credits [[Will Eisner]] as the scripter.<ref>Wojtkoski's family has supplied the online comics encyclopedia "The Lambiek Comiclopedia" with documentation to support the overall Wojtkoski credit. Another artist, [[Charles Nicholas#Chuck Cuidera|Charles Nicholas Cuidera]], also drew Blue Beetle stories later, and has claimed to have been the creator, but comics historians credit Wojtkoski.

He starred in a comic book series, [[comic strip]] and [[radio]] serial, but like most [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] superheroes, he fell into obscurity in the 1950s. The comic book series saw a number of anomalies in publication: 19 issues, #12 through #30, were published through [[Holyoke Publishing]]; no issue #43 was published; publication frequency varied throughout the run; and there were gaps where issues were not published, with large ones occurring in early 1947 and between mid-1948 and early 1950.

In the mid-1950s, Fox Comics went out of business and sold rights of the Blue Beetle to [[Charlton Comics]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.toonopedia.com/foxfeatr.htm | title=Fox Feature Syndicate | work=[[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]] | accessdate=2010-09-13}}</ref> That company published a few sporadic adventures of the Golden Age character before revamping the hero in 1964.<ref>The two initial Charlton runs were:

Two of the attempts retained the numbering of a previous title. These also were eventually replaced with new titles that carried on the numbering.

In 2006, DC introduced a new Blue Beetle, teenager '''[[Blue Beetle (Jaime Reyes)|Jaime Reyes]]''', whose powers are derived from the scarab, now revealed as a piece of advanced alien technology.

==Dan Garret==

===Fox Feature Syndicate and Holyoke Publishing===
[[Image:Blue Beetle Mystery Men.jpg|thumb|left|The first appearance of the Blue Beetle, ''Mystery Men Comics'' #1 (1939). Art by Charles Nicholas.]]
The original [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] Blue Beetle was '''Dan Garret''',<ref name="ref4">In the earliest Golden Age appearances and during the mid-1960s run by writer-artist [[Steve Ditko]], the original Blue Beetle was referred to as Dan "Garret", spelled with one "t".</ref> son of a [[police]] officer killed by a criminal. This [[Fox Feature Syndicate]] version of the character debuted in ''Mystery Men Comics'' #1 (August 1939), and began appearing in his own 60-issue series shortly thereafter.

Rookie patrolman Dan Garret originally fought crime as the Blue Beetle without the benefit of superhuman abilities.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.toonopedia.com/beetle1.htm | title=The Blue Beetle (1939) | work=Don Markstein's Toonopedia | accessdate=2010-09-13}}</ref> Garret later donned a bulletproof blue costume (described by Garret as being [[chain-mail]] made of a [[cellulose]] material which was "as thin and light as silk but stronger than steel") and temporarily gained [[superhuman]] strength and stamina from ingesting the mysterious [[vitamin]] 2-X.<ref>{{Cite comic | writer= | artist=Nicholas, Charles | title=Mystery Men Comics | issue=13 | date=August 1940 | publisher=[[Fox Feature Syndicate]]}}</ref>  Like the [[Green Hornet]], the Blue Beetle would use his signature scarab symbol to bedevil criminals, leaving it to be easily found, hanging it down into a room on a string and even projecting its enlarged image onto a wall with a [[flashlight]].

The supporting cast remained fairly stable throughout this original run and included Joan Mason, a beautiful blond [[reporter]] for the ''Daily Blade'' who would ultimately star in her own backup stories, and Mike Mannigan, Dan's stereotypically [[Ireland|Irish]] partner on the force who believed despite all evidence to the contrary that the Blue Beetle was a criminal and was always trying to arrest him with little success. Dr. Franz, a local [[pharmacist]] and inventor of the bulletproof suit and 2-X formula (as well as many other handy gadgets, including a [[mobile phone|portable wireless telephone]] a good half century before they came into common use), played a large role in the early issues but eventually faded from the cast. The Beetle also had a short-lived spunky kid sidekick in the form of Sparkington J. Northrup (Sparky), who originally wore an abbreviated version of the Beetle's costume but later went into action wearing his regular clothes.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.wonderworldcomics.com/bluebeetle/Origin.html | title=The Origin and Legend of the Golden Age Blue Beetle | work=WonderworldComics.com | accessdate=2010-09-18}}</ref>

During [[World War II]], Dan Garret became a government agent who was often sent overseas on secret missions, but after peace was declared he returned to his old role of neighborhood cop.  The Blue Beetle's powers slowly increased over time with him eventually gaining the ability to fly and [[x-ray vision]] among other bizarre talents that changed from issue to issue at the whim of the writers.  However, when superheroes fell out of vogue in the late 1940s, Fox started to downplay his superheroic aspects and his superhuman abilities were removed, and his now considerably darker adventures became full of [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] violence and scantily-clad women until he was eventually relegated to hosting [[True crime (genre)|true crime]] stories before the character went on hiatus.

A popular character in his era, the Blue Beetle had his own short-lived [[comic strip]], drawn by a [[pseudonym]]ous [[Jack Kirby]] and others, and a [[Old-time radio|radio serial]] that ran for 48 thirteen-minute episodes.

==Dan Garrett==

===Charlton Comics===
[[Image:Blue Beetle v3 1.jpg|thumb|left|''Blue Beetle'' vol. 2, #1 (June 1964). Cover art by [[Frank McLaughlin (comics)|Frank McLaughlin]].]]
[[Charlton Comics]] obtained the rights to the Blue Beetle and reprinted some stories in its [[anthology]] titles and in a four-issue ''Blue Beetle'' reprint series numbered 18-21.

In 1964, during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] of comics, Charlton would revise the character for a new Blue Beetle series. Charlton's new Blue Beetle retained the original's name (adding a second "t"), but none of his powers or origin. This Beetle was [[Archaeology|archaeologist]] Dan Garrett, who obtained a number of superhuman powers (including super strength and vision, flight, and the ability to generate energy blasts) from a mystical [[Scarab (artifact)|scarab]] he found during a dig in [[Egypt]], where it had been used to imprison an evil mummified Pharaoh.<ref name="dc-ency">{{Cite book | last=Beatty | first=Scott | author-link=Scott Beatty | contribution=Blue Beetle | editor-last=Dougall | editor-first=Alastair | title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page=57 | publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] | location=London | year=2008 | isbn=0-7566-4119-5}}</ref> He would transform into the Blue Beetle by saying the words "Kaji Dha!" This version, by writer [[Joe Gill]] and artist [[Tony Tallarico]], was played at least initially for [[Camp (style)|camp]], with stories like "The Giant Mummy Who was Not Dead". The Charlton Dan Garrett version of the Blue Beetle ran only until 1966 before his replacement debuted.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.toonopedia.com/beetle2.htm | title=The Blue Beetle (1964) | work=Don Markstein's Toonopedia | accessdate=2010-09-13}}</ref>

===AC Comics===
Both Blue Beetles (indeed, all ''three'' Blue Beetles) reappeared in the third issue of ''[[Americomics]]'', a title published by [[AC Comics]] in 1983/1984. In the first story in this issue, Ted Kord fights a bogus Dan Garrett, but the second story is more significant. It reveals that the original 1940s Dan had been reincarnated as the Silver Age version (minus his memories of his earlier existence) by some unspecified "gods", presumably the ones responsible for his mystic scarab. The gods subsequently resurrect Dan again and send him off to save Ted Kord's life (leaving him a note saying simply, "Try not to get killed this time"), after which Kord turns the Blue Beetle name back over to Dan. ''Americomics'' was canceled after issue #6, and so far this story has never been referenced by any other publisher.

===DC Comics===
The Charlton version of Dan Garrett was spotlighted in the second issue of DC's 1980s ''[[Secret Origins]]'' series, in which his origin was retold along with that of Ted Kord. Subsequent appearances by Dan Garrett (in flashback stories) include guest spots or cameos in ''[[Infinity, Inc.]]'', ''[[Captain Atom]]'', ''[[Justice League|JLA: Year One]]'', and ''Legends of the DC Universe''.

The character briefly returned in [[DC Comics]]' first run of ''Blue Beetle'',<ref name="BBv6i18">{{Cite comic | writer=[[Len Wein|Wein, Len]] | artist=[[Paris Cullins|Cullins, Paris]] | story=...And Death Shall Have No Dominion! | title=Blue Beetle | volume=6 | issue=18 | date=November 1987 | publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref> resurrected by his mystical scarab to battle against his successor. He can also be seen in various flashback stories. His 1940s incarnation is briefly glimpsed in DC's 1993 limited series ''The Golden Age''.

===Dynamite Entertainment===
In issue #0 of the ''[[Project Superpowers]]'' miniseries, the Fox Feature Syndicate version of the Blue Beetle appeared in flashbacks.<ref>{{Cite comic | writer=[[Alex Ross|Ross, Alex]] | cowriters=[[Jim Krueger]] | artist=Ross, Alex | story=Last Gleaming | title=[[Project Superpowers]] | issue=0 | date=January 2008 | publisher=[[Dynamite Entertainment]]}}</ref> To avoid trademark conflicts with DC Comics, he is referred to in this series by the nickname "Big Blue".<ref>{{Cite comic | writer=Ross, Alex | cowriters=Jim Krueger | artist=Paul, Carlos | story=...Undimmed by Human Tears | title=Project Superpowers | issue=4 | date=June 2008 | publisher=Dynamite Entertainment}}</ref> Sparky is scheduled to appear in volume two, as part of a team of kid heroes and sidekicks.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

It was eventually established that the Charlton Comics incarnation of the Dan Garrett Blue Beetle made his debut on August 14, 1939.<ref>{{Cite comic | writer=[[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]] | cowriters=[[Jeff Katz]] | penciller=[[Dan Jurgens|Jurgens, Dan]] | inker=[[Norm Rapmund|Rapmund, Norm]] | story=52 Pick-Up, Chapter 2: Leggo My Ego | title=[[Booster Gold]] | volume=2 | issue=2 | date=November 2007 | publisher=DC Comics}}</ref> The Jaime Reyes Blue Beetle has met Daniel's granddaughter, Danielle,<ref>{{Cite comic | writer=[[Keith Giffen|Giffen, Keith]] | cowriters=[[John Rogers (writer)|John Rogers]] | artist=[[Duncan Rouleau|Rouleau, Duncan]] | story=Inside Man | title=Blue Beetle | volume=7 | issue=9 | date=January 2007 | publisher=DC Comics}}</ref> and has also met Dan himself.<ref name="BGv2i6">{{Cite comic | writer=Johns, Geoff | cowriters=Jeff Katz | penciller=Jurgens, Dan

==Ted Kord==
{{Main|Blue Beetle (Ted Kord)}}
[[Image:Blue Beetle LAW.png|thumb|left|Ted Kord as the Blue Beetle. Art by [[Dick Giordano]].]]

The replacement Blue Beetle created by Charlton Comics, and later published by [[Americomics]] and DC Comics, is '''Ted Kord''', a former student of Dan Garrett, a genius-level inventor and a gifted athlete. Kord and Garrett were investigating Kord's Uncle Jarvis when they learned Jarvis was working to create an army of androids to take over Earth. Garrett changed into Blue Beetle, but was killed in battle. As he died, he passed on to Kord the responsibility of being Blue Beetle, but was unable to pass on the mystical scarab.<ref>''Blue Beetle'' vol. 5, #2 (Charlton Comics, Aug. 1967).</ref>

Ted had the scarab for some time, but never used it. He carried it during the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' when he was chosen by the [[Monitor (comics)|Monitor]] to protect the multiple Earths, but it only reacted when he was attacked; it did not give him superpowers.

As the Blue Beetle, Ted funded his adventures through his company, Kord Industries, and was chronically short on cash. He joined the Justice League and met his best friend, [[Booster Gold]]. Each was considered a second stringer and, for many years, the Blue Beetle was a member of one second-rate superhero group or another.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

During the "[[The Death of Superman|Death of Superman]]" saga, the Blue Beetle and the other JLA members tried to stop [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]]'s path of destruction.{{Issue|date=October 2009}} Doomsday displayed his near-invulnerability and, while brutally defeating the League, put the Blue Beetle into a coma. Upon recovery, he continued his tenure with the JLA as well as its offshoot, [[Extreme Justice]].

In ''[[Countdown to Infinite Crisis]]'', Blue Beetle discovered a renewed [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]] organization led by [[Maxwell Lord]], former bankroller of the JLA. Kord covertly entered Checkmate headquarters, where he found a database containing information on every metahuman on Earth. However, he was captured before he could return to the JLA with the information, and while in Lord's custody was executed with a single gunshot to the head. Before dying, he had used the scarab in an attempt to contact [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], but was forced to leave it with [[Shazam (character)|Shazam]] in the Rock of Eternity when the wizard sent him back to [[Earth]].{{Issue|date=October 2009}}

Some time later, Booster, along with Jaime, Dan, and the [[Black Beetle (comics)|Black Beetle]] in the guise of a Blue Beetle from the future, travels back in time to rescue Kord moments before his death.<ref name="BGv2i6"/> Ted later travels back to guarantee his own death.{{Issue|date=October 2009}}

==Jaime Reyes==
{{Main|Blue Beetle (Jaime Reyes)}}
[[Image:Blue Beetle Reyes.PNG|thumb|Jaime Reyes. Promotional art for ''Blue Beetle'' vol. 7, #2 (2006), by [[Cully Hamner]].]]

'''Jaime Reyes''' is a teenager who lives in [[El Paso, Texas]], with his father, mother, and little sister; his father owns a garage and his mother is a nurse. Jaime has offered to help his father out at the garage, but his father has turned him down. He feels Jaime should enjoy his childhood for as long as he can (and should attempt to further his education). Jaime has an acute sense of responsibility for his family and friends, though he complains about being the one to sort out any messes.{{Issue|date=October 2009}}

After the wizard [[Shazam (character)|Shazam]] was killed and the [[Rock of Eternity]] destroyed, the scarab landed in a vacant lot in El Paso where Jaime found it, thinking it to be nothing but a huge bug. When Booster Gold came to retrieve the scarab, it had fused to Jaime's spine while the boy had been asleep, making Jaime the new Blue Beetle.{{Issue|date=October 2009}} After Booster Gold revealed Jaime's new powers to him, Jaime was swept up in the climactic battle with [[OMAC (comics)#Brother Eye|Brother Eye]] during ''[[Infinite Crisis]]''. At its conclusion, the scarab separates him from the other superheroes and hurls him back to Earth where he discovers he has been missing for a year due to the scarab using a dimensional mode of transportation. He is now a member of the [[Teen Titans]].<ref>{{Cite comic | writer=Rogers, John | cowriters=[[J. Torres]], Keith Giffen | penciller=[[Rafael Albuquerque|Albuquerque, Rafael]] | copencillers=David Baldeon, [[Freddie Williams II]] | inker=Albuquerque, Rafael | coinkers=David Baldeon, Freddie Williams II, Steve Bird | title=Blue Beetle | volume=7 | issue=13–19 | date=May – November 2007 | publisher=DC Comics}}</ref> He is good friends with Rose Wilson ([[Ravager (comics)|Ravager]]), [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], [[Static (DC Comics)|Static]], and others. In ''[[Teen Titans]]'' vol. 3, #83, he takes a break from the team to be with his mother.

Jaime has a girlfriend, the young sorceress [[Traci 13]], who gets along well with Jaime's family. His large and loving family is a major source of strength and guidance for Jaime. Peacemaker has been a kind and wise mentor for the young Blue Beetle. So has [[Doctor Mid-nite]].

Jaime co-starred along with the rest of the former Justice League International in ''[[Justice League: Generation Lost]]''.

Following DC's ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' event, ''Blue Beetle'' was one of 52 monthly titles launched in September 2011, again starring Jaime Reyes.<ref>http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/2011/06/09/blue-beetle-1/</ref><ref>http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/2011/08/17/who%e2%80%99s-who-at-dc-comics-the-new-52-tony-bedard/</ref>

==The scarab==
The Blue Beetle scarab, previously shown as an artifact of magic, is later [[retcon]]ned as a tool of war of the Reach, an ancient race of cosmic [[wikt:marauder|marauders]]. After being defeated by the [[Guardians of the Universe]] thousands of years ago, and forced into a truce, the Reach posed as benevolent aliens lending their advanced technology to budding civilizations, with the scarab intended as a gift for that world's champion, giving him amazing powers and the knowledge of the Reach to protect his or her peers.{{Issue|date=October 2009}} In fact, the scarab is part of an advanced [[Group mind (science fiction)|hive mind]], with its own artificial intelligence covertly supplanting the wearer's own, turning it into the "ultimate [[Sleeper agent|infiltrator]]", a covert agent intended to take over its own world, as evidenced when a still-damaged scarab revives Garrett to fight Ted Kord, until Garrett is able to reassert his individuality.<ref name="BBv6i18"/>

Damaged when Dan Garrett forcibly extracted it from its charging cradle and located in a faux pyramid in Egypt, the scarab is first activated with chunks of its programming missing, giving several abilities to Dan Garrett, but none of the Reach knowledge base. The combined additional damage dealt by the multiversal/chronal energies fed into it during Booster Gold's mission to protect the Multiverse during the ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' event, and the magic forces of the Shadow Demons, put it into a dormant state for a year, after which it wakes, enacting its full programming to turn Jaime Reyes into the infiltrator.<ref name="BBv7i24">{{Cite comic | writer=Rogers, John | artist=Albuquerque, Rafael | story=End Game, Part Three: Outside-In | title=Blue Beetle | volume=7 | issue=24 | date=April 2008 | publisher=DC Comics}}</ref>

However, the strong will and the good nature of Jaime Reyes, combined with the still corrupted programming of the scarab, helped its A.I. to assert itself as an individual, a tool no more. Claiming "Khaji Da" (the combined utterance of "khaji", the codeword for "infiltrator", and "da", its own serial number) as its own name at the end of said process, the scarab developed a strong bond with Jaime over time, helping him as a true friend, and even trying to spread the concept of individuality among its fellow scarabs.<ref name="BBv7i24"/>

==Other versions==

===Kingdom Come===
Blue Beetle (Ted Kord) was seen in [[Alex Ross]] and [[Mark Waid]]'s limited series ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]''. He is shown with the rest of the Charlton "Action Heroes" not as a member of [[Magog (comics)|Magog]]'s [[Justice Battalion]], but as part of [[Batman]]'s group and later of the MLF (Mankind Liberation Front). He would be shown later in the title in a suit of armor powered by the then-mystic scarab, working with Batman's team. In the novelization of the series, Batman thinks of Blue Beetle, along with [[Green Arrow]] and [[Black Canary]], as his closest (at the time) friends. Blue Beetle is killed with most of the other heroes by a nuclear explosion.

The final issue, #52, of DC Comics' 2006/2007 year-long weekly series ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' revealed that a "[[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]]" system of [[Worlds of the 52 multiverse|52 parallel universes]], with each Earth being a different take on established DC Comics characters as featured in the mainstream continuity (designated as "New Earth") had come into existence. The Multiverse acts as a storytelling device that allows writers to introduce [[alternate versions of fictional characters]], hypothesize "What if?" scenarios, revisit popular Elseworlds stories and allow these characters to interact with the mainstream continuity. For example, the Ted Kord of the ''Kingdom Come'' limited series is said to reside on Earth-22.

Spin-offs from the series ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]'' would introduce more alternate Blue Beetles in 2007. Earth-19 (the ''[[Gotham by Gaslight]]'' universe), set in a Victorian-like era, has its own version of Dan Garrett who in his secret identity is the leading Egyptologist at the Gotham Museum of Natural History and wears a monocle, appearing in ''The Search for Ray Palmer: Gotham by Gaslight''. The limited series ''[[Countdown: Arena]]'' onwards depicted three more for the first time. Firstly, an Earth-26 Blue Beetle, a swarm of sentient insects that form a man-shaped body (calling themselves "The Scarab"); as well as Ted of Earth-33, an anthropomorphic beetle, the pet of Mr. and Mrs. Kord; and Earth-39 Blue Beetle, a younger version of Dan Garrett, who has bonded with his scarab in the same way as Jaime Reyes.{{Issue|date=October 2009}}

A new version of the Blue Beetle known as "Blue Scarab" was shown as a member of the Justice League in the apocalyptic future depicted in ''Justice League: Generation Lost''. He is stated as being the "descendant of the Blue Beetle", and has a very alien-looking appearance.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #14 (Late January 2011)</ref>

An evil version has appeared in the [[antimatter universe of Qward]], the [[universe]] of the [[Crime Syndicate of America]], known as the Scarab.

==In other media==

===Radio===
[[Image:Blue Beetle radio.jpg|right]]
The Blue Beetle had a short career on the radio, between May and September 1940. Motion picture and radio actor [[Frank Lovejoy]] was the Blue Beetle for the first 13 episodes, while for the rest of the shows, the voice was provided by a different, uncredited actor. The Blue Beetle was a young police officer who saw the need for extraordinary crime fighting. He took the task on himself by secretly donning a superhero costume to create fear in the criminals who were to learn to fear the Blue Beetle's wrath. The 13-minute segments were usually only two-parters, so the stories were often simpler than other popular programs, such as the ''[[Superman (radio)|Superman]]'' radio serial.

===Audio===
The ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'' story, in which the Blue Beetle took part, has been adapted as an audio drama by John Whitman, based on the story by [[Mark Waid]] and [[Alex Ross]] and the [[novelization]] by [[Elliot S. Maggin]] ([[Time Warner]] Audio Books, 1998).<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.sfsite.com/05a/king32.htm | title=''Kingdom Come'' (review) | accessdate=2007-07-02 | work=SF Site | last=Shainblum | first=Mark}}</ref>

===Television===

====''Batman: The Brave and the Bold''====

=====''Jaime Reyes''=====
The Jaime Reyes Blue Beetle has appeared in the animated series ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', voiced by actor [[Will Friedle]], who previously voiced the futuristic [[Batman]], [[Terry McGinnis]], in ''[[Batman Beyond]]''.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.mania.com/dark-knight-teams-up-for-batman-brave-bold_article_110687.html | title=The Dark Knight Teams up for ''Batman: The Brave and the Bold'' | work=Mania.com | accessdate=2010-09-18}}</ref> In the show's pilot episode, "The Rise of the Blue Beetle!", it is mentioned that a previous Blue Beetle existed before Jaime and was murdered by [[Kanjar Ro]]. Jaime makes another appearance in the episode "Invasion of the Secret Santas!", assisting Batman in fighting the [[Sportsmaster]] and his henchmen and inviting Batman to his family's [[Christmas Eve]] dinner. Jaime appeared again fighting [[Planet Master]] alongside Aquaman in "Aquaman's Outrageous Adventure!".

The Reyes Blue Beetle also appears in the episode "Deep Cover for Batman!" and its sequel, "Game Over for Owlman!" In the first part of the story, an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] version of Jaime Reyes named "Scarlet Scarab" is shown as a member of the [[Crime Syndicate of America#Similar groups in other media|Injustice Syndicate]], led by Batman's evil [[doppelganger]], [[Owlman (comics)|Owlman]]. The "Scarlet Scarab" mentions to his suit (which is sentient) that he has the heart of a true hero. This leads Batman (posing as Owlman) to believe that he can help the evil version of Reyes — before Scarlet Scarab finishes his statement with, "I keep it in a jar in the back of my closet."<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/bravebold/guides/s01.php | title=''Batman: The Brave and the Bold'' Episode Guide | work=World's Finest Online | accessdate=2010-09-13}}</ref>

In the episode "Night of the Huntress!", Blue Beetle, Batman, and the [[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]] have to stop the gangster Baby-Face and his wife, Mrs. Manface. The Blue Beetle develops a crush on the Huntress in the episode. Reyes appeared again in "The Fate of Equinox!" where he, along with [[Doctor Fate]], [[Aquaman]], [[Black Canary]], [[Black Lightning]], [[Fire (comics)|Fire]], the original [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Flash]], [[Green Arrow]], [[Green Lantern]], [[Plastic Man]], and [[Red Tornado]] temporarily gave their powers to Batman, turning him into Bat Monolith so he could battle the omnipotent Equinox.

In "Revenge of the Reach!", Jaime learns that his scarab is a part of the Reach. His suit temporarily takes control of him and has him shut down the defenses around [[Oa]], allowing the Reach to invade. Fortunately, Jaime regains control of his suit, reminding it that what they did was of their will, not the Reach's. Channeling the energy of the Green Lanterns through his suit, Blue Beetle is able to free all those under the Reach's control. The [[Guardians of the Universe]] then ask Jaime for his scarab so it can be destroyed along with the others, but [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]] convinces them that Jaime proved he was the suit's master.

Reyes' friend Paco also appears several times, in the episodes "The Rise of the Blue Beetle!", "Fall of the Blue Beetle!", "Night of the Huntress!", and "Revenge of the Reach!", played by voice actor [[Jason Marsden]].

Finally, worthy of mention is the fact that Jaime briefly appears in the opening sequence of the series, among other well-known heroes

=====''Ted Kord''=====

The Ted Kord version of the character appears in the episode "Fall of the Blue Beetle!", voiced by actor [[Wil Wheaton]].<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2009/01/wil-wheaton-tak/ | title=Wil Wheaton Takes the Blue Beetle Back to His Silver Age Roots on ''Batman: The Brave and the Bold'' | work=Wired.com | accessdate=2010-09-13 | first=Ken | last=Denmead | date=2009-01-17}}</ref> In this episode, it is revealed that Ted Kord (who was unable to use the scarab) died two years ago in an explosion. Dan Garrett is also seen in a flashback to Kord's origin, but does not speak. Garrett was seen lying dead.

Kord makes a second appearance in the episode "Menace of the Madniks!"  A melancholic [[Booster Gold]] travels back in time to see his old friend one more time and alters the Madniks and the time stream.  Batman and Kord (unwittingly on his part) help Booster restore order.  Wil Wheaton also voiced this appearance.<ref>{{citation | url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1728263/ | title="Batman: The Brave and the Bold" Menace of the Madniks! | publisher= [[Internet Movie Database]] | accessdate = 2011-06-03}}</ref>

=====''Dan Garrett''=====

Dan Garrett makes a brief, non-voiced appearance during the opening of "Fall of the Blue Beetle!", as Batman narrates about the Blue Beetles and how Ted inherited a dying Dan's mantle.  Dan's Blue Beetle suit is displayed in Ted Kord's headquarters in the episode "Menace of the Madniks!", next to Ted's suit.

====''Young Justice''====

Jaime Reyes appears as the Blue Beetle in [[Young_Justice_(TV_series)#.27The_Team.27_subsequent_members|season 2]], voiced by actor [[Eric Lopez]].  In a [[running gag]], Jaime can often be seen rejecting the Scarab's (also voiced by Lopez) more violent and bloodthirsty suggestions ("No, it would ''not'' have been easier to just vaporize him back in the diner!"), which confuses those around him as it looks like he's talking to himself.

====''The Electric Company''====
On the [[PBS]] children's educational series ''[[The Electric Company (1971 TV series)|The Electric Company]]'', the Blue Beetle was a bumbling [[superhero]] (played by [[Jim Boyd (actor)|Jim Boyd]]) who would often make matters worse instead of better. He wore a mask, a hood with antennae, wings, tennis shoes, boxer shorts, and a t-shirt bearing the name "Blue Beetle". Outside the name, the character is unrelated to any of the comic book versions.

===''Watchmen: Under the Hood''===
The Dan Garret Blue Beetle appears on the cover of a comic book in the ''[[Watchmen (film)|Watchmen]]'' film tie-in ''[[Watchmen (film)#Home media|Under the Hood]]''.

===Live action===
[[Geoff Johns]] announced on his [[Twitter]] account that there is a [[live action]] screen test of [[Blue Beetle (Jaime Reyes)|Jaime Reyes]] as the Blue Beetle. This screen test is being used to trial the concept of a Blue Beetle television series.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://twitter.com/GeoffJohns0 | title=Geoff Johns at Twitter | work=Twitter.com | accessdate=2010-09-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | last=Douglas | first=Edward | url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/articles/102444-blue-beetle-live-action-show-in-development | title=Blue Beetle Live Action Show in Development? | work=Superherohype.com | date=June 13, 2010 | accessdate=2010-09-13}}</ref>

At the San Diego Comic-Con 2010, it was announced that Jaime Reyes would appear in the episode "Booster" in the final season of ''[[Smallville]]''. It was confirmed that Ted Kord would make an appearance as well, searching for the lost, and apparently extremely dangerous Blue Beetle scarab. Dan Garrett is also mentioned, with Clark Kent stating he was a Kord Industries scientist who was killed after the Scarab bonded with him.
