The original Blue Beetle, '''Dan Garret''', [[first appeared]] in [[Fox Comics]]' ''Mystery Men Comics'' #1 (cover-dated August 1939), with art by Charles Nicholas Wojtkowski (as [[Charles Nicholas (comics)|Charles Nicholas]]) (though the [[Grand Comics Database]] tentatively credits [[Will Eisner]] as the scripter).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=490#11|title=Mystery Men Comics #1|accessdate=2007-06-22|author=Lou Mougin (indexer)|publisher=Grand Comics Database}} Wojtkowski's family has supplied the online comics encyclopedia [http://lambiek.net/artists/index.htm The Lambiek Comiclopedia] with documentation to support the overall Wojtkowski credit. Another artist, [[Charles Nicholas (comics)|Charles Nicholas Cuidera]], also drew Blue Beetle stories later, and has claimed to have been the creator, but comics historian credit Wojtkowski.</ref> A rookie [[police officer]], he used special equipment, a bulletproof costume and a superstrength-inducing "2-X [[vitamin]]", and the assistance of a neighborhood pharmacist to fight crime. He starred in a comic book series, [[comic strip]] and [[radio]] serial but, like most [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] superheroes, he fell into obscurity in the 1950s. The comic book series saw a number of anomalies in publication: 19 issues, #12 through #30, were published through [[Holyoke Publishing]]; no issue #43 was published; publication frequency varied through the run; and there were gaps where issues were not published, with large ones occurring in early 1947 and between mid-1948 and early 1950. 

In the mid-1950s, Fox Comics went out of business and sold rights to the Blue Beetle to [[Charlton Comics]].<ref>http://www.toonopedia.com/foxfeatr.htm</ref> That company published a few sporadic adventures of the Golden Age character before revamping the hero in 1964.<ref>http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=18410</ref> In '''Dan Garrett''''s revised origin, he was an [[archeologist]] who found a magical Egyptian [[artifact (fantasy)|artifact]], resembling a [[Scarabaeidae|scarab]], which he used to fight crime.{{Issue|date=October 2009}} Charlton tried three times to use the character to carry a self-titled series. Two of the attempts retained the numbering of a previous title. These also were eventually replaced with new titles that carried on the numbering.

The new series was short-lived, and in the pages of ''[[Captain Atom]]'' #83 (cover-dated November, 1966)<ref>http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=20474</ref>, Charlton introduced '''[[Blue Beetle (Ted Kord)|Ted Kord]]''', a student of Dan Garrett's who took on the role when Garrett died. Kord was an inventor hero, using a variety of gadgets. This Beetle received his own series in 1967, but the entire Charlton "Action Heroes" line of comic books ceased publication in 1968.<ref>http://www.toonopedia.com/beetle3.htm</ref><ref>http://darkmark6.tripod.com/charlton_index.html</ref><ref>http://www.toonopedia.com/charlton.htm</ref> With the rest of the Charlton line-up, he was sold to [[DC Comics]] in 1983 and appeared with several superhero groups, including the [[Justice League]].

In 2006, DC introduced a new Blue Beetle, teenager '''[[Blue Beetle (Jaime Reyes)|Jaime Reyes]]''', whose powers are derived from the scarab, now revealed as a piece of advanced alien technology. The series was initially written by [[Keith Giffen]] and [[John Rogers (writer)|John Rogers]],<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/forums/showthread.php?threadid=50609 Keith Giffen Talks the new Blue Beetle], [[Newsarama]],</ref> with artist [[Cully Hamner]].<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20051210025215/http://www.newsarama.com/dcnew/Beetle/hamner.htm Who's That Bug?

==Dan Garret==
===Fox Feature Syndicate and Holyoke Publishing===
[[Image:Blue Beetle 1st Appearance.jpg|thumb|left|The first appearance of the Blue Beetle, ''Mystery Men Comics'' #1, 1939. Art by Charles Nicholas.]]
The original [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] Blue Beetle was '''Dan Garret'''.<ref name="ref4"> In the earliest Golden Age appearances and during the mid-1960s run by writer-artist [[Steve Ditko]], the original Blue Beetle was referred to as Dan "Garret," spelled with one "t."</ref>, son of a [[police]] officer killed by a criminal. This [[Fox Feature Syndicate]] version of the character debuted in ''Mystery Men Comics'' #1 (Aug. 1939), and began appearing in his own 60-issue series shortly thereafter.

Rookie patrolman Dan Garret originally fought crime as the Blue Beetle without the benefit of superhuman abilities.<ref>http://www.toonopedia.com/beetle1.htm</ref> Garret later donned a bulletproof costume (described by Garret as being made of a chain-mail which was "as thin and light as silk"), and temporarily gained [[superhuman]] strength from ingesting the mysterious [[vitamin]] 2-X.<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = Mystery Men Comics|Issue = 13|Date = (August 1940)|Publisher = [[Fox Features Syndicate]]}}</ref>

The supporting cast remained fairly stable throughout this original run, and included Joan Mason, a crime [[reporter]] for the ''Daily Blade'' who would ultimately star in her own backup stories, and Mike Mannigan, Dan's stereotypically [[Ireland|Irish]] partner on the force. Dr. Franz, a local [[pharmacist]] and inventor of the bulletproof suit and 2-X formula, played a large role in the first few issues, but eventually faded from the cast. The Beetle also had a kid sidekick in the form of Sparkington J. Northrup, a.k.a. Sparky, who originally wore a simplified version of Blue's costume, but later went into action wearing his regular clothes.<ref>[http://www.wonderworldcomics.com/bluebeetle/Origin.html Origin of the Golden Age Blue Beetle], at WonderWorldComics.com</ref>

A popular character of the era, he had his own short-lived [[comic strip]], drawn by a [[pseudonymous]] [[Jack Kirby]] and others, and a [[Old-time radio|radio serial]] that ran for 48 thirteen-minute episodes. When superheroes fell out of vogue in the late 1940s, Fox downplayed the Beetle's superheroic aspects (his superhuman abilities were removed) and eventually relegated him to a host for [[True crime (genre)|true crime]] stories before the character went on hiatus.

===Charlton Comics===
[[Image:Bb1.jpg|thumb|left|160px|''Blue Beetle'' vol. 3, #1 (June 1964). Cover art by [[Frank McLaughlin]].]]

[[Charlton Comics]] obtained the rights to the Blue Beetle, and reprinted some stories in its [[anthology]] titles and in a four-issue ''Blue Beetle'' reprint series numbered 18-21. 

In 1964, during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age of Comics]], Charlton would revise the character for a new Blue Beetle series. Charlton's new Blue Beetle retained the original's name (but adding a second 't'), but none of his powers or origin. This Beetle was [[archaeology|archaeologist]] '''Dan Garrett''', who obtained a number of superhuman powers (including super strength and vision, flight and the ability to generate energy blasts) from a mystical [[scarab]] he found during a dig in [[Egypt]], where it had been used to imprison an evil mummified Pharaoh.<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation | last = Beatty | first = Scott | author-link = Scott Beatty | contribution = Blue Beetle | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages = 57 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = London | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5}}</ref> He would transform into the Blue Beetle by saying the words "'''Kaji Dha!'''" This version by writer [[Joe Gill]] and artist [[Tony Tallarico]] was played at least initially for [[camp (style)|camp]], with stories like "The Giant Mummy Who was Not Dead". The Charlton Dan Garrett version of the Blue Beetle ran only until 1966 before his replacement debuted.<ref>http://www.toonopedia.com/beetle2.htm</ref>

'''AC Comics'''

Both Blue Beetles (indeed, all ''three'' Blue Beetles) reappeared in the third issue of Americomics, a title published by AC Comics in 1983/4. In the first story in this issue, Ted Kord fights a bogus Dan Garrett, but the second story is more significant. It reveals that the original 1940s Dan had been reincarnated as the Silver age version (minus his memories of his earlier existence) by some unspecified 'gods', presumably the ones responsible for his mystic scarab. The gods subsequently resurrect Dan again and send him off to save Ted Kord's life (leaving him a note saying simply 'try not to get killed this time'), after which Kord turns the Blue Beetle name back over to Dan. Americomics was canceled after #6, and so far this story has never been referenced by any other publisher. 

Dan Garrett briefly returned in [[DC Comics]]' ''Blue Beetle'' #18 (vol. 6) in November 1987, resurrected by his mystical scarab to battle against his successor. He can also be seen in various flashback stories. His 1940s incarnation is briefly glimpsed in DC's 1993 limited series 'The Golden Age'.

===DC Comics===
The Charlton version of Dan Garrett was spotlighted in the second issue of DC's 1980s ''[[Secret Origins]]'' series, in which his origin was retold along with that of Ted Kord. Subsequent appearances by Dan Garrett (in flashback stories) include guest spots or cameos in ''[[Infinity Inc.]]'', ''[[Captain Atom]]'', ''[[JLA: Year One]]'' and ''[[Legends of the DC Universe]]''.

===Dynamite Entertainment===
In issue #0 of the ''[[Project Superpowers]]'' miniseries from [[Dynamite Entertainment]], the original (Fox Feature Syndicate) Blue Beetle appeared in flashbacks.<ref>{{comicbookdb|issue|118674|Project Superpowers #0}}</ref> To avoid trademark conflicts with DC Comics, he's referred to in this series by the nickname "Big Blue."<ref>{{comicbookdb|issue|134626|Project Superpowers #4}}</ref> Sparky is scheduled to appear in volume two, as part of a team of kid heroes and sidekicks.{{Fact|date=October 2009}}

===Legacy===
It was eventually established that the DC Comics incarnation of the Daniel Garrett Blue Beetle made his debut on August 14, 1939.<ref>''Booster Gold'' vol. 2, #2 (2007)</ref> The Jaime Reyes Blue Beetle has met Daniel's granddaughter, Danielle, as well<ref>''Blue Beetle'' vol. 7, #9 (2007)</ref> and also met Dan himself.<ref>''Booster Gold'' vol. 2, #6 (2007)</ref>

==Ted Kord==
{{main|Blue Beetle (Ted Kord)}}
[[Image:BlueBeetle03.png|thumb|155px|Ted Kord as the Blue Beetle. Art by [[Dick Giordano]].]]

The replacement Blue Beetle created by Charlton Comics, and later published by [[Americomics]] and DC Comics, is '''Ted Kord''', a former student of Dan Garrett, a genius-level inventor and a gifted athlete. Kord and Garrett were investigating Kord's Uncle Jarvis when they learned Jarvis was working to create an army of androids to take over Earth. Garrett changed into Blue Beetle, but was killed in battle. As he died, he passed on to Kord the responsibility of being Blue Beetle, but was unable to pass on the mystical scarab.{{Issue|date=October 2009}}

Ted had the scarab for some time, but never used it. He carried it during the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' when he was chosen by [[Monitor (comics)|the Monitor]] to protect the multiple Earths, but it only reacted when he was attacked; it did not give him superpowers.

As the Blue Beetle, Ted funded his adventures through his company, Kord Industries, and was chronically short on cash.{{Issue|date=October 2009}} He joined the Justice League and met his best friend, [[Booster Gold]]. Each was considered a second stringer, and for many years, the Blue Beetle was a member of one second-rate superhero group or another.{{Issue|date=October 2009}}

During the "[[Death of Superman]]" saga the Blue Beetle and the other JLA members tried to stop [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]]'s path of destruction.{{Issue|date=October 2009}} Doomsday displayed his near-invulnerability and, while brutally defeating the League, put the Blue Beetle into a coma.  Upon recovery, he continued his tenure with the JLA as well as its offshoot [[Extreme Justice]].

In ''[[Countdown to Infinite Crisis]]'', Blue Beetle discovered a renewed [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]] organization led by [[Maxwell Lord]], former bankroller of the JLA. Kord covertly entered Checkmate headquarters, where he found a database containing information on every metahuman on Earth. However, he was captured before he could return to the JLA with the information, and while in Lord's custody was executed with a single gunshot to the head. Before dying, he had used the scarab in an attempt to contact [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], but was forced to leave it with [[Shazam (comics)|Shazam]] in the Rock of Eternity when the wizard sent him back to [[Earth]].{{Issue|date=October 2009}}

Some time later, Booster, along with Jaime, Dan, and the [[Black Beetle (comics)|Black Beetle]] in the guise of a Blue Beetle from the future, travels back in time to rescue Kord moments before his death.<ref>''Booster Gold'' #6 (2008)</ref> Ted later travels back to guarantee his own death.{{Issue|date=October 2009}}

==Jaime Reyes==
{{main|Blue Beetle (Jaime Reyes)}}

[[Image:Bbnew.PNG|thumb|right|150px|Jaime Reyes. Promotional art for ''Blue Beetle'' vol. 7, #2 (2006), by [[Cully Hamner]].]]

'''Jaime Reyes''' is a teenager who lives in [[El Paso, Texas]] with his father, mother and little sister; his father owns a garage and his mother is a nurse. Jaime has offered to help his father out at the garage, but his father has turned him down.  He feels Jaime should enjoy his childhood for as long as he can (and should attempt to further his education). Jaime has an acute sense of responsibility for his family and friends, though he complains about being the one to sort out any messes.{{Issue|date=October 2009}} 

After the wizard [[Shazam (comics)|Shazam]] was killed and the [[Rock of Eternity]] destroyed, the scarab landed in a vacant lot in El Paso where Jaime found it, thinking it to be nothing but a huge bug. When Booster Gold came to retrieve the scarab, it had fused to Jaime's spine while the boy had been asleep, making Jaime the new Blue Beetle.{{Issue|date=October 2009}} After a few minor encounters locally, he was swept up in the climactic battle with [[Brother Eye]] during ''[[Infinite Crisis]]''. At its conclusion, he is hurled back to Earth where he discovers he has been missing for a year.

==The scarab==
The Blue Beetle scarab, previously believed a piece of magic, is in fact a tool of war of the Reach, an ancient race of cosmic [[marauder]]s. After being defeated by the [[Guardians of the Universe]] thousands of years ago, and forced into a truce, the Reach posed as benevolent aliens lending their advanced technology to budding civilizations, with the scarab intended as a gift for that world's champion, giving him amazing powers and the knowledge of the Reach to protect his or her peers.{{Issue|date=October 2009}} In fact, the scarab is part of an advanced [[hive mind]], with its own artificial intelligence covertly supplanting his wearer's own, turning it into the ''ultimate [[Sleeper agent|infiltrator]]'', a covert agent intended to take over his own world, as evidenced when a still-damaged scarab revives Garrett to fight Ted Kord, until Garrett is able to reassert his individuality.<ref>''Blue Beetle'' #18 vol. 6, (Nov. 1987)</ref>

Damaged when Dan Garrett forcibly extracted it from its charging cradle and located in a faux pyramid in Egypt, the scarab is first activated with chunks of its programming missing, giving several abilities to Dan Garrett but none of the Reach knowledge base. The combined additional damage dealt by the multiversal/chronal energies fed into it during [[52 (comics)|Booster Gold's mission to protect the Multiverse]], and the magic forces of the '''Shadow Demons''', put it into a dormant state for a year, after which it wakes, enacting its full programming to turn Jaime Reyes into the infiltrator.<ref name="Blue Beetle #24 May. 2008">''Blue Beetle'' vol. 7, #24 (May. 2008)</ref>

However, the strong will and the good nature of Jaime Reyes, combined with the still corrupted programming of the scarab, helped its A.I. to assert itself as an individual, a tool no more. Claiming '''Khaji Da''' (the combined utterance of ''khaji'', the codeword for ''infiltrator'', and ''da'', its own serial number) as its own name at the end of said process, the scarab developed a strong bond with Jaime over time, helping him as a true friend, and even trying to spread the concept of individuality among its fellow scarabs.<ref name="Blue Beetle #24 May. 2008"/>

==Other versions==
===Alternate stories===
* Blue Beetle (Ted Kord) was seen in [[Alex Ross]] and [[Mark Waid]]'s comic ''[[Kingdom Come (comic)|Kingdom Come]]''. He is shown with the rest of the Charlton "Action Heroes" not as a member of [[Magog (comics)|Magog]]'s [[Justice Battalion]], but as part of [[Batman]]'s group and later of the MLF (Mankind Liberation Front). He would be shown later in the title in a suit of armor powered by the then-mystic scarab, working with Batman's team. In the novelization of the series, Batman thinks of Blue Beetle, along with Green Arrow and Black Canary, as his closest (at the time) friends. Blue Beetle is killed with most of the other heroes by a nuclear explosion.
* The character is used as the basis for Nite Owl in [[Alan Moore]]'s ''[[Watchmen]]''.
* Though Blue Beetle did not appear in 2000s [[animated TV series]] ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', he has been featured in the comic book, ''[[Justice League Adventures]]''.

===52 Multiverse===
The final issue, #52, of DC Comics' 2006-2007 year-long weekly series ''[[52 (comic book)|52]]'' revealed that a "[[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]]" system of [[List of DC Multiverse worlds#The 52|52 parallel universes]], with each Earth being a different take on established DC Comics characters as featured in the mainstream continuity (designated as "New Earth") had come into existence. The Multiverse acts as a storytelling device that allows writers to introduce alternate versions of fictional characters, hypothesize "what if?" scenarios, revisit popular Elseworlds stories and allow these characters to interact with the mainstream continuity. For example, the Ted Kord of the ''Kingdom Come'' limited series is said to reside on Earth-22.
[[Image:Bluebeetlegaslight.jpg|thumb|The [[Gotham by Gaslight#Earth-19|Earth-19]] Blue Beetle.]]
Spin-offs from the series ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]'' would introduce more alternate Blue Beetles in 2007. Earth-19 (the ''[[Gotham by Gaslight]]'' universe), set in a Victorian-like era, has its own version of Dan Garrett who in his secret identity is the leading Egyptologist at the Gotham Museum of Natural History and wears a monocle, appearing in ''The Search For Ray Palmer: Gotham By Gaslight''. The limited series ''[[Countdown: Arena]]'' onwards depicted three more for the first time. Firstly, an Earth-26 Blue Beetle: a swarm of sentient insects that form a man-shaped body (calling themselves "The Scarab"), as well as Ted of Earth-33, an anthropomorphic beetle, the pet of Mr. and Mrs. Kord, and Earth-39 Blue Beetle, a younger version of Dan Garrett, who has bonded with his scarab in the same way as Jaime Reyes.{{Issue|date=October 2009}}

==In other media==
==== Radio ====
[[Image:Beetleradio.jpg|right]]
The Blue Beetle had a short career on the radio, between May and September 1940. Motion picture and radio actor [[Frank Lovejoy]] was the Blue Beetle for the first 13 episodes, while for the rest of the shows, the voice was provided by a different, uncredited actor. The Blue Beetle was a young police officer who saw the need for extraordinary crime fighting. He took the task on himself by secretly donning a superhero costume to create fear in the criminals who were to learn to fear the Blue Beetle's wrath. The 13-minute segments were usually only two-parters, so the stories were often simpler than other popular programs, such as the ''[[Superman (radio)|Superman]]'' radio serial.

===Audio===
* ''[[Kingdom Come (comic book)|Kingdom Come]]'' audio drama, adapted by [[John Whitman]] based on a story by [[Mark Waid]] and [[Alex Ross]] and the [[novelization]] by [[Elliot S. Maggin]] ([[Time Warner]] Audio Books, 1998)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfsite.com/05a/king32.htm|title=SFSite.com: ''Kingdom Come'' (review)
|accessdate=2007-07-02|publisher=SF Site|last=Shainblum|first=Mark}}</ref>

===Television===
====The Electric Company====
* On the [[PBS]] children's educational series ''[[The Electric Company (1971 TV series)|The Electric Company]]'', the Blue Beetle was a bumbling [[superhero]] (played by [[Jim Boyd (actor)|Jim Boyd]]) who would often make matters worse instead of better. He wore a mask, a hood with antennae, wings, tennis shoes, boxer shorts, and a t-shirt bearing the name "Blue Beetle".

====Batman: The Brave and the Bold====
* The "Jaime Reyes" Blue Beetle has appeared in the series ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' voiced by actor [[Will Friedle]], who previously voiced the futuristic [[Batman]], [[Terry McGinnis]] in ''[[Batman Beyond]]''<ref>The Dark Knight Teams up for BATMAN: BRAVE AND THE BOLD<http://www.mania.com/dark-knight-teams-up-for-batman-brave-bold_article_110687.html></ref>. In the show's pilot episode, "Rise of the Blue Beetle!", it is mentioned that a previous Blue Beetle existed before Jaime, and was murdered by [[Kanjar Ro]]. Jaime makes another appearance in the episode "Invasion of the Secret Santas!", assisting Batman in fighting the [[Sportsmaster]] and his henchmen and inviting Batman to his family's [[Christmas Eve]] dinner. In the episode "Fall of the Blue Beetle!", actor [[Wil Wheaton]] voices the Ted Kord version of the character<ref>Wil Wheaton Takes the Blue Beetle Back to His Silver Age Roots on Batman: The Brave and the Bold<http://blog.wired.com/geekdad/2009/01/wil-wheaton-tak.html></ref>. In this episode it is revealed that Ted Kord (who was unable to use the scarab) died two years ago in an explosion. Dan Garrett is also seen in a flashback to Kord's origin, but does not speak. Garrett was seen lying dead, possibly from his battle against Kanjar Ro; though, the Beetle statue in "Rise of the Blue Beetle" didn't resemble Garrett and may have been an earlier, alien Beetle. He has a red evil counterpart from an alternate reality that goes by the name of '''Scarlet Scarab'''. The Reyes Blue Beetle also appears in the episode "Game Over for Owlman!" 
* In the episode, "Deep Cover For Batman!", an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] version of Jaime Reyes named "Scarlet Scarab" is shown as a member of the [[Crime_Syndicate#Similar_groups_in_other_media|Injustice Syndicate]] led by Batman's evil [[doppelganger]] [[Owlman (comics)|Owlman]]. Note: the "Scarlet Scarab" mentions to his suit (which is sentient) that he has the heart of a true hero. This leads Batman (posing as Owlman) to believe that he can help the evil version of Reyes — before Scarlet Scarab finishes his statement with "I keep it in a jar in the back of my closet".<ref>http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/bravebold/guides/s01.php Batman : The Brave and the Bold Episode Guide</ref>
*In the episode "Night of the Huntress!", Blue Beetle, Batman, and [[Huntress (comics)|the Huntress]] have to stop the gangster Baby-Face and his wife, Mrs. Manface. The Blue Beetle develops a crush on the Huntress in the episode.
* Reyes' friend Paco appears in the "Rise of the Blue Beetle!", "Fall of the Blue Beetle!" and "Night of the Huntress!" episodes of ''Batman: The Brave and the Bold'' played by voice actor [[Jason Marsden]].

====Watchmen: Under the Hood====
The Dan Garret Blue Beetle appears on the cover of a comic book in the ''[[Watchmen (film)|Watchmen]]'' film tie-in [[Tales of the Black Freighter (film)|Under the Hood]].
