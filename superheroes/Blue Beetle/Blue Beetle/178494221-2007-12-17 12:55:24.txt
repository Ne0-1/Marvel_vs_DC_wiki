The original Blue Beetle, '''Dan Garrett''', [[first appeared]] in [[Fox Comics]]' ''Mystery Men Comics'' #1 (Aug. 1939), with art by Charles Nicholas Wojtkowski (as [[Charles Nicholas (comics)|Charles Nicholas]]), though the Grand Comics Database tentatively credits [[Will Eisner]] as the scripter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=490#11|title=Mystery Men Comics #1|accessdate=2007-06-22|author=Lou Mougin (indexer)|publisher=Grand Comics Database}}<br>Wojtkowski's family has supplied the online comics encyclopedia [http://lambiek.net/artists/index.htm The Lambiek Comiclopedia] with documentation to support the overall Wojtkowski credit. Another artist, [[Charles Nicholas (comics)|Charles Nicholas Cuidera]], also drew Blue Beetle stories later, and has claimed to have been the creator, but comics historian credit Wojtkowski.</ref> A rookie [[police officer]], he utilized special equipment, a bulletproof costume (sometimes)  and a superstrength-inducing "[[vitamin]]", and the assistance of a neighborhood pharmacist to fight crime. He starred in a comic book series, [[comic strip]] and [[radio]] serial but, like most [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] superheroes, he fell into obscurity in the 1950s. The comic book series saw a number of anomalies in publication: 19 issues, #12 through #30, were published through [[Holyoke Publishing]]; publication frequency varied through the run; and there were gaps where issues were not published, with large ones occurring in early 1947 and between mid-1948 and early 1950. 

In the mid-1950s, Fox Comics went defunct and sold rights to the Blue Beetle to [[Charlton Comics]]. That company published a few sporadic adventures of the Golden Age character before revamping the hero in 1966. In Dan Garrett's revised origin, he was an [[archeologist]] who found a magical Egyptian [[artifact (fantasy)|artifact]], resembling a [[Scarabaeidae|scarab]], to fight crime. Charlton tried three times to use the character to carry a self titled series. Two of the attempts retained the numbering of a previous title. These also were eventually replaced with new titles that carried on the numbering.

The new series was short-lived, and in 1967, Charlton introduced '''[[Blue Beetle (Ted Kord)|Ted Kord]]''', a student of Dan Garrett's who took on the role when Garrett died. Kord was an inventor hero, using a variety of gadgets. With the rest of the Charlton line-up, he was sold to [[DC Comics]] in 1983 and appeared with several superhero groups, including the [[Justice League]].

In 2006, DC introduced a new Blue Beetle, teenager '''[[Blue Beetle (Jaime Reyes)|Jaime Reyes]]''' whose powers are derived from the scarab, now revealed as a piece of advanced alien technology.

==Dan Garrett==
===Fox Feature Syndicate===
The original [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] Blue Beetle was '''Dan Garrett'''<ref name="ref4">In the earliest Golden Age appearances and during the 1967 Ditko run, the original Blue Beetle was referred to as Dan Garrett, spelled with one "t."</ref>, son of a [[police]] officer killed by a criminal. This [[Fox Feature Syndicate]] version of the character debuted in ''Mystery Men Comics'' #1 (Aug. 1939), and began appearing in his own 60-issue series shortly thereafter.

Rookie patrolman Dan Garrett donned bulletproof costume (described by Garrett as being made of a chain-mail which was "as thin and light as silk"), and temporarily gained [[superhuman]] strength from ingesting the mysterious [[vitamin]] 2X.<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = Mystery Men Comics|Issue = 13|Date = (August 1940)|Publisher = [[Fox Feature Syndicate]]}}</ref>

The supporting cast remained fairly stable throughout this original run, and included Joan Mason, a crime [[reporter]] for the ''Daily Blade'' who would ultimately star in her own backup stories, and Mike Mannigan, Dan's stereotypically [[Ireland|Irish]] partner on the force. Dr. Franz, a local [[pharmacist]] and inventor of the bulletproof suit and 2X formula, played a large role in the first few issues, but eventually faded from the cast.

A popular character of the era, he had his own short-lived [[comic strip]], drawn by a [[pseudonymous]] [[Jack Kirby]] and others, and a [[Old-time radio|radio serial]] that ran for 48 thirteen-minute episodes.  When superheroes fell out of vogue in the late 1940s, Fox downplayed the Beetle's superheroic aspects (his superhuman abilities were removed) and eventually relegated him to a host for [[True crime (genre)|true crime]] stories before the character went on hiatus.

===Charlton Comics===
[[Image:Bb1.jpg|thumb|left|160px|''Blue Beetle'' vol. 3, #1 (June 1964). Cover art by [[Frank McLaughlin]].]]

[[Charlton Comics]] obtained the rights to the Blue Beetle, and reprinted some stories in its [[anthology]] titles and in a four-issue ''Blue Beetle'' reprint series numbered 18-21. 

During the genesis of the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age of Comics]], Charlton would revise Garrett's character for a new Blue Beetle series. Charlton's new Blue Beetle retained the original's name, but none of his powers or origin.  This Beetle was [[archaeology|archaeologist]] Dan Garrett, who obtained a number of superhuman powers (including enhanced strength, flight and the ability to generate lightning) from a mystical [[scarab]] he found during a dig in [[Egypt]], where it had been used to imprison an evil mummified Pharaoh.  He would transform into the Blue Beetle by saying the words "Kaji Dha!" This version by writer [[Joe Gill]] and artist [[Tony Tallarico]] was played at least initially for [[camp (style)|camp]], with stories like "The Giant Mummy who was Not Dead". 

Dan Garrett briefly returned in ''Blue Beetle'' vol. 6, resurrected by his mystical scarab to battle against his successor. He can be seen in flashback stories.

===DC Comics===

The Charlton version of Dan Garrett was spotlighted in the second issue of DC's 1980s ''Secret Origins'' series, in which his origin was retold along with that of Ted Kord. Subsequent appearances by Dan Garrett (in flashback stories) include guest spots or cameos in ''Infinity Inc.'', ''Captain Atom'', ''JLA: Year One'' and ''Legends of the DC Universe''.

===2007===

In 2007's ''Booster Gold'' Vol. 2, No. 2, it is revealed that in current DC Universe continuity, this Blue Beetle made his first appearance on August 14, 1939.  In the  ''Blue Beetle'' series ''circa'' September, 2007, the new Blue Beetle makes the acquaintance of Garrett's granddaughter, Danielle.

==Ted Kord==
{{main|Blue Beetle (Ted Kord)}}
[[Image:BlueBeetle03.png|thumb|155px|Ted Kord as the Blue Beetle. Art by [[Dick Giordano]].]]

The replacement Blue Beetle created by Charlton Comics, and later published by [[DC Comics]], is Ted Kord, a former student of Dan Garrett, a genius-level inventor and a gifted athlete. Kord and Garrett were investigating Kord's Uncle Jarvis when they learned Jarvis was working to create an army of androids to take over Earth. Garrett changed into Blue Beetle, but was killed in battle. As he died, he passed on to Kord the responsibility of being Blue Beetle, but was unable to pass on the mystical scarab.

Ted had the scarab for some time, but never used it.  He carried it during the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' when he was chosen by The Monitor to protect the multiple earths, but it only reacted when he was attacked; It did not give him super powers.

As the Blue Beetle, Ted funded his adventures through his company, Kord Industries, and was chronically short on cash. He joined the Justice League and met his best friend, [[Booster Gold]]. Each was considered a second stringer, and for many years, the Blue Beetle was a member of one second-rate superhero group or another.

In ''[[Countdown to Infinite Crisis]]'', Blue Beetle discovered a renewed [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]] organization led by [[Maxwell Lord]], former bankroller of the JLA. Kord covertly entered Checkmate headquarters, where he found a database containing information on every metahuman on Earth.  However, he was captured before he could return to the JLA with the information, and while in Lord's custody was executed with a single gunshot to the head.  Before dying, he had used the scarab in an attempt to contact Captain Marvel, but was forced to leave it with [[Shazam]] in the Rock of Eternity when the wizard sent him back to Earth.

==Jaime Reyes==
{{main|Blue Beetle (Jaime Reyes)}}

[[Image:Bbnew.PNG|thumb|left|150px|Jaime Reyes. Promotional art for ''Blue Beetle'' vol. 7, #2 (2006), by [[Cully Hamner]].]]

'''Jaime Reyes''' is a teenager who lives in [[El Paso, Texas]], with his father, mother and little sister; his father owns a garage. Jaime has offered to help his father out at the garage, but his father has turned him down, feeling Jaime should enjoy his childhood for as long as he can (and should attempt to further his education). Jaime has an acute sense of responsibility for his family and friends, though he complains about being the one to sort out any messes. 

After the wizard [[Shazam (comics)|Shazam]] was killed and the [[Rock of Eternity]] destroyed, the scarab landed in a vacant lot in El Paso where Jaime found it, thinking it to be nothing but a huge bug. When Booster Gold came to retrieve the scarab, it had fused to Jaime's spine while the boy had been asleep, making Jaime the new Blue Beetle. After a few minor encounters locally, he was swept up in the climactic battle with [[Brother Eye]] during [[Infinite Crisis]]. At its conclusion, he is hurled back to Earth where he discovers he has been missing for a year.

==The scarab==
The powers of both the suit and the [[scarab]] are generally activated by the wearer, though the scarab has evinced its own persona, with hints that it is not as benevolent as it might seem. This is foreshadowed in ''Blue Beetle'' #18 (Nov. 1987) when the scarab's power resurrects Dan Garrett, driving him into battle with Ted Kord. Garrett fights off the scarab's influence, shattering it, but he dies again in the process. At first it seems that the scarab was lost in the battle, however recent continuity dictates that Ted Kord did find the Beetle and had kept it in his possession, perhaps allowing the story, because the Scarab would not activate during that time. The story leaves unclear who or what, if anything, is behind the scarab's power. In ''Infinite Crisis'' #6, Green Lantern [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]] found his [[power ring (weapon)|power ring]] giving off sparks while near the scarab, rather than the usual "buzz" when the ring senses magic, and in ''Blue Beetle'' #1 (May 2006), Green Lantern [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]] gets a severe headache while in the scarab's vicinity. [[Metron (comics)|Metron]] identified the suit as one worn by a ''Reach Infiltrator'', identifying the alien race as the '''Reach'''.<ref name="ic6">{{Comic book reference|Title = Infinite Crisis|Issue = 6|Date = (May 2006)|Publisher = [[DC Comics]]}}</ref><ref name="bb1">{{Comic book reference|Title = The Blue Beetle|Volume = 7|Issue = 1|Date = (May 2006)|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>  Thousands of years ago, the Reach fought a war with the Guardians of Oa that ended in a stalemate and truce; it is possible their respective weapons technologies are programmed to be instinctively hostile to each other.

==Alternate versions==
===Alternate stories===
* Blue Beetle (Ted Kord) was seen in [[Alex Ross]] and [[Mark Waid]]'s comic ''[[Kingdom Come (comic)|Kingdom Come]]''. He is shown with the rest of the Charlton 'Action Heroes' but not as a member of Magog's Justice Battalion, he was part of Batman's group and later of the MLF (Mankind Liberation Front). He would be shown later in the title in a suit of armor powered by the mystic scarab, working with [[Batman]]'s team, before being killed with most of the other heroes by a nuclear explosion.
* Alan Moore's and Dave Gibbon's ''[[Watchmen]]'' bases both [[Nite Owl]] characters on the first (Fox Features) and second (Ted Kord) Blue Beetles, respectively.
* Though Blue Beetle did not appear in 2000s [[animated TV series]] ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', he has been featured in the comic book, ''Justice League Adventures''.

===52 Multiverse===
In the final issue of ''[[52 (comic book)|52]]'', a new Multiverse is revealed, originally consisting of 52 identical realities. Among the parallel realities shown is one designated "Earth-4". As a result of [[Mister Mind]] "eating" aspects of this reality, it takes on visual aspects similar to the pre-Crisis Earth-Four, including the Blue Beetle and the other Charlton characters. The names of the characters are not mentioned in the panel in which they appear, but the Blue Beetle is visually similar to the Dan Garrett Blue Beetle.<ref>
{{Comic book reference|title=[[52 (comic book)|52]]|issue=52|date=(May 2, 2007)|publisher=DC Comics|page=13|panel=5}}</ref> Based on comments by [[Grant Morrison]], this alternate universe is not the pre-Crisis Earth-4.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=111900|title = The 52 Exit Interviews: Grant Morrison|accessdate = 2007-05-12|last = Brady|first = Matt|date=2007-05-08|publisher = Newsarama}}</ref> The Blue Beetles of many Elseworlds were also amalgamated into the new "52 Multiverse," for example, the Ted Kord of ''Kingdom Come'' is said to reside on Earth-22.

Spin-offs from the series ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]'' would introduce more alternate Blue Beetles in 2007. Earth-19 (the ''[[Gotham by Gaslight]]'' universe), set in a Victorian-like era, has its own version of Dan Garrett who in his secret identity is the leading Egyptologist at the Gotham Museum of Natural History and wears a monocle, appearing in ''The Search For Ray Palmer: Gotham By Gaslight''. The limited series ''[[Countdown: Arena]]'' onwards depicted three more for the first time. Firstly, an Earth-26 Blue Beetle: a swarm of sentient insects that form a man-shaped body (calling themselves "The Scarab"), as well as Ted of Earth-33, an antropomophised beetle, the pet of Mr. and Mrs. Kord, and Earth-39 Blue Beetle, a younger version of Dan Garret, who has bonded with his scarab in the same way as Jaime Reyes.

==Other media==
==== Radio ====
[[Image:Beetleradio.jpg|right]]
The Blue Beetle had a relatively short career on the radio, between May and September of 1940. Motion picture and radio actor [[Frank Lovejoy]] was the Blue Beetle for the first 13 episodes, while for the rest of the shows, the voice was provided by a different, uncredited actor. The Blue Beetle was a young police officer who saw the need for extra-ordinary crime fighting. He took the task on himself by secretly donning a superhero costume to create fear in the criminals who were to learn to fear the Blue Beetle's wrath. The 13-minute segments were usually only two-parters, so the stories were often more simple than other popular programs, such as the ''[[Superman (radio)|Superman]]'' radio serial.

===Audio===
*''[[Kingdom Come (comic book)|Kingdom Come]]'' audio drama, adapted by [[John Whitman]] based on a story by [[Mark Waid]] and [[Alex Ross]] and the [[novelization]] by [[Elliot S. Maggin]] ([[Time Warner]] Audio Books, 1998)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfsite.com/05a/king32.htm|title=SFSite.com: ''Kingdom Come'' (review)
|accessdate=2007-07-02|publisher=SF Site|last=Shainblum|first=Mark}}</ref>

===Television===
On the [[PBS]] children's educational series ''[[The Electric Company]]'', the Blue Beetle was a bumbling superhero (played by Jim Boyd) who would often make matters worse instead of better. He wore a mask, a hood with antennae, wings, tennis shoes, boxer shorts, and a t-shirt bearing the name "Blue Beetle."

==Trivia==
{{Trivia|date=October 2007}}
*The DC comic book series ''[[Watchmen]]'', by [[Alan Moore]] and [[Dave Gibbons]], was originally intended to be portrayed using Charlton Comics characters.  The two [[Nite-Owl]] characters are based on Dan Garrett and Ted Kord.
*In ''[[The Dresden Files]]'', an ongoing series of books by ''[[Jim Butcher]]'', Harry Dresden, the main protagonist, drives an ancient VW Bug he dubbed the ''Blue Beetle''.
*[[AC Comics]] had used [[Charlton Comics]] characters, particularly the Blue Beetle, in the comic title ''[[Sentinels of Justice]]''.  When the rights for these characters were sold to [[DC Comics]], AC Comics created a second Sentinels of Justice team (writing the first out of continuity), composed of some of its original characters as well as ones from the [[public domain]]. Many of these are [[homage]]s to the Charlton heroes, such as the [[Scarlet Scorpion]] (a stand-in for Blue Beetle}.
