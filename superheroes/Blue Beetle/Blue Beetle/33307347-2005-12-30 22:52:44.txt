Three [[fictional character|fictional]] [[superheroes]] have used the name '''Blue Beetle''' as of 2005.

The most promiment is the character published by [[DC Comics]], which in 1983 <!--year per Wiki Charlton article--> acquired the rights to to the name and character from [[Charlton Comics]]. That character, with the civilian name '''Ted Kord''', had evolved from an earlier Blue Beetle, civilian name '''Dan Garrett''', created in 1939 by the pseudonymous [[Charles Nicholas (comics)|Charles Nicholas]]{{fn|1}} for [[Fox Feature Syndicate]]. Charlton purchased the rights from Fox in the 1950s, and eventually revised the character, retaining only his civilian name. Charlton then introduced the completely new Blue Beetle that DC would acquire.

==Fox Feature Syndicate==
The original [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] Blue Beetle was '''Dan Garrett''', son of a [[police]] officer killed by a criminal.  This [[Fox Feature Syndicate|Fox]] version of the character debuted in ''Mystery Men Comics'' #1 (1939), and began appearing in his own 60-issue series shortly thereafter (first issue dated simply 1939, the next dated May-June 1940, the last Aug. 1950; a separate company, [[Holyoke]], published issues 12-30).  Dan Garrett had invented a bulletproof costume, and had gained [[superhuman]] strength from a mysterious [[vitamin]].  <!--RE: "This version of the Beetle, like many other low-powered [[vigilante]] superheroes, bore many similarities to [[Batman]]."  Did he have "superhuman strength" or was he "low-powered" and non-super like Batman?--> A popular character of the era, he had his own short-lived [[comic strip]], drawn by a pseudonymous [[Jack Kirby]] and others, and a [[Old-time radio|radio serial]].  When superheroes fell out of vogue in the late 1940s, Fox downplayed the Beetle's superheroic aspects (his superhuman abilities were removed) and eventually relegated him to a host for [[True crime (genre)|true crime]] stories before he was finally put to rest.

==Charlton Comics==
===Dan Garrett (1950s)===
Charlton Comics obtained the rights to the Blue Beetle, and reprinted some stories in its [[anthology]] titles and in a four-issue ''Blue Beetle'' reprint series numbered 18-21 (Feb.-Aug. 1955), continuing the numbering of the defunct Charlton title ''The [[Thing]]''.

===Dan Garrett (Silver Age)===
During the genesis of the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age of comics]], Charlton would revise the character for a new Blue Beetle series. It ran a total of ten issues, numbered 1-5 (June 1964 - April 1965) then 50-54 (July 1965 - March 1966, taking up the numbering from the discontinued ''Unusual Tales''). Charlton's new Blue Beetle retained the original's name, but none of his powers or origin.  This Beetle was an [[archaeology|archaeologist]] who obtained a number of superhuman powers (including enhanced strength, flight and the ability to generate lightning) from a mystical [[scarab]] he fought in [[Egypt]]. This version by writer [[Joe Gill]] and artist [[Tony Tallarico]] was played at least initially for [[camp (style)|camp]], with stories like "The Giant Mummy Who was Not Dead".

===Ted Kord===
[[Image:CaptainAtom83.jpg|thumb|200px|left|''Captain Atom'' #83 (Nov. 1966), debut of the Ted Kord Blue Beetle. Art by [[Steve Ditko]] (pencils), Ditko and [[Rocke Mastroserio]] (inks).]]
Charlton's next Blue Beetle, '''Ted Kord''', was created by [[Steve Ditko]], and first appeared as a back-up feature in ''[[Captain Atom]]'' #83 (Nov. 1966), with [[Gary Friedrich]] scripting from Ditko's conception and plot. This third Blue Beetle was a genius-level inventor and a gifted athlete, sharing much more in common with the Fox original than did Charlton's earlier reimagining of the character.  This Blue Beetle's signature equipment is his bug-shaped [[personal aircraft]], which he enters and exits typically with a cable suspended from the cockpit.  He also generally eschews personal weaponry except for a pistol that makes a blinding flash of light and, additionally, a strong airblast to gain the advantage when he closes in for hand-to-hand combat.

Ditko is best known as the co-creator (with [[Stan Lee]]) and original artist of [[Spider-Man]] at [[Marvel Comics]].  While Blue Beetle and Spider-Man have some similar characteristics, such as being wise-cracking, acrobatic, arthropod-themed urban heroes, they evolved into very different characters.  Both characters are accomplished inventors (Ted Kord is considered one of the premier minds of the [[DC Universe]]), great athletes and skilled acrobats.  Both characters also have strong (if sometimes ill-timed) senses of humor that they use to mask their insecurities — more in the case of the Beetle, who has no powers of his own (and in later years has to deal with occasional weight gain).  On the other hand, the Beetle has none of the angst associated with brooding vigilantes like Batman.  Unlike Spider-Man, Blue Beetle is a team player and a loyal friend; Beetle is the only hero who put up with the narcissistic pretty-boy superhero [[Booster Gold]] when the two were paired in the [[Justice League]].

The Ted Kord Blue Beetle ran as a backup feature in ''Captain Atom'' #83-86 (Nov. 1966 - June 1967) before getting his own title, which ran from #1-5 (June 1967 - Nov. 1968).  A sixth issue was produced, but published in the ''Charlton Portfolio''.  The [[Question (comics)|Question]] ran as a backup series, with the fifth issue featuring a quasi-team-up in which the Blue Beetle story continues in part in the Question tale.
[[Image:BlueBeetle3.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''Blue Beetle #3'' (Oct. 1967). Beware the proto-[[Creeper (comics)|Creepers]]. Art by [[Steve Ditko]].]]

An origin was given in #2, linking Ted Kord to the previous Blue Beetle. Ted was revealed as a former student of Dan Garrett, and when they were investigating Ted's Uncle Jarvis, they learned the uncle was working to create an army of androids to take over Earth.  Garrett changed into Blue Beetle, but was killed in the battle.  As he died, he passed on the responsibility of being Blue Beetle to Ted, but wasn't able to pass on the mystical scarab.  There was a hint that one android was still left in stasis, but this was never resolved.

In the early 1980s, the first issue of Charlton's in-house fanzine ''[[Charlton Bullseye]]'', featured had a team-up of the Blue Beetle and the Question.  Later, [[AC Comics]] would publish a story intended for ''Charlton Bullseye'' in ''Americomics'' #3, and a one-shot of a team-up of all the Charlton "Action Heroes", as the comapany called its lineup.

==DC Comics==
DC acquired the Charlton heroes in the mid-1980s, and used the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' [[fictional crossover|crossover]] event to integrate them all into the DC Universe.  During this period Blue Beetle had his own series, written by [[Len Wein]].  Also published during this time was ''[[Secret Origins]]'' #2 (cover illustrated by [[Gil Kane]]), which explained the origins and careers of the Ted Kord and Dan Garrett Blue Beetles in the post-''Crisis'' [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]].  They would also follow up on the hinted android in stasis from the Charlton series, having this android pretend to be Dan Garrett, but Ted Kord stopped him.

Ted Kord is sometimes shown as an industrialist, the owner of Kord Industries; more often he is short on money, leading to his entering "get-rich-quick" schemes with [[Booster Gold]]. 

A brief appearance in ''JLA: Year One'' showed the young Ted working in Kord Industries R&D, where he designed the JLA HQ security system. Upon meeting the heroes he thought, "Screw the family business. I want to be one of those guys", possibly explaining the company's fluctuating status since he took over. In recent comics, it has been implied that Kord Industries has become a subsidiary of Wayne Enterprises, headed by Bruce Wayne a.k.a. [[Batman]].
===The Justice League===
BB is probably best known as the wisecracking member of [[Keith Giffen]] and [[J.M. DeMatteis]]'s lighthearted, five-year run on various ''Justice League of America'' titles (notably ''Justice League International''), where he was memorably partnered with fellow third-string hero [[Booster Gold]], and the two quickly became best friends.  After Giffen and DeMatteis left, ''Justice League America'' continued to run until #113.  [[Dan Jurgens]] tied the "[[Death of Superman]]" storyline into ''JLA'', in which [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] left Blue Beetle in a coma during his murderous rampage. Beetle and Booster both subsequently joined the short-lived Justice League offshoot known as [[Extreme Justice]].

Blue Beetle then entered a period of relative obscurity. The [[miniseries]] ''The LAW (Living Assault Weapons)'' reunited Blue Beetle and the other heroes acquired from Charlton, but the series met with critical disfavor.  Following this, Beetle appeared for a time in ''[[Birds of Prey]]''.<!--The following needs citation: since he was a favorite of ''Birds of Prey'' writer [[Chuck Dixon]].-->
<!--This paragraph includes speculation about a future event. Please supply a direct quote from the writer or another first-person source, with citation:  Since Beetle has had health problems (including a career-long problem with weight fluctuation and, more recently, heart disease), Dixon's plan was for [[Tim Drake]], the current [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] and a fan of the Beetle, to hang up that mantle for a while and replace Ted Kord as the Blue Beetle — a plan that failed to materialize when Dixon left DC for [[CrossGen Comics]].-->

In July 2003, Giffen, DeMatteis, and original ''JLI'' artist [[Kevin Maguire]] reunited for the six-issue miniseries ''Formerly Known As The Justice League'', where many of the original JLI characters reteamed with a storefront office.  Beetle, who has grown in maturity, was an important member of this new team, the "[[Super Buddies]]" (see [[Super Friends]]). A sequel story arc, "[[I Can't Believe It's Not The Justice League]]", was initially slated as a second miniseries but abut instead ran, delayed, in ''JLA: Classified'' #4-9. This created the unfortunate circumstance of running after the devastating, companywide ''[[Identity Crisis (comics)|Identity Crisis]]'': A running joke involves the possibility of Sue's pregnancy, and seems morbid given the ''Identity Crisis'' events.

===Death===
In the 80-page special ''[[Infinite Crisis#Countdown to Infinite Crisis|Countdown to Infinite Crisis]]'', published on [[March 30]], 2005, Blue Beetle discovered a renewed [[Checkmate (DC Comics)|Checkmate]] organization led by [[Maxwell Lord]], former bankroller of the JLA. He attempted to escape after discovering Checkmate's database of superheroes, but was shot in the head and apparently killed by Lord.

That same story, had earlier reiterated the origin of the Ted Kord Blue Beetle first given in [[Charlton Comics]]' ''Blue Beetle'' #2 (August 1967), specifically the fact that Kord had come into possession of the mystic scarab that powered the Dan Garrett Blue Beetle. The wizard [[Shazam (comics character)|Shazam]] took the scarab upon encountering Kord, fueling speculation about the possibility of the character's return during DC's ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' series. This possibility was dashed when it was asked in the WizardWorld convention if Kord would ever return; DC's answer was no. "There was a breeze blowing through his brain, and he was incinerated," writer [[Greg Rucka]] stated. "How much clearer can it be?"

===The new Blue Beetle===
In ''[[Day of Vengeance]]'', after the wizard Shazam (see above) was killed by the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]], Kord's scarab landed in [[El Paso, Texas]] where it was picked up by a teenaged boy named Jaime in [[Infinite Crisis]] #3.

Writer Keith Giffen announced in a 2005 news article that he will be creating a new Blue Beetle, who is scheduled to star in his own series beginning March 2006 after the conclusion of ''Infinite Crisis''. [http://www.newsarama.com/forums/showthread.php?s=252ce54b9dfb099a1ff413e88d3f4292&threadid=50609] 
<!--CITATION for "The new Blue Beetle" quotes and any speculation about future plans that may or may not happen. Consider that "I Can't Believe It's Not The Justice League" did not come out in the time or manner originally set. The above second sentence ("DC has supplied...") is one way of providing information about future plans by just giving objective facts.
. [[The following quote has no bearing in an encyclopedic context. It's not informative; it's just a public-relation teaser.]] On the new Beetle, Giffen has stated, "I won't say his name, but I can tell you, he's a far cry from Ted Kord, and he has no idea what he's in for." He also mentioned that the new Beetle will appear in an upcoming issue of ''Infinte Crisis'', though whether he appears as the Beetle or merely in his secret identity is unknown. [[Following is an educated guess, meaning speculation, contrarty to Wiki standards] It is most likely the new Beetle will come from El Paso, where the scarab landed.-->

==Alternate versions==
Blue Beetle was seen in [[Alex Ross]] and [[Mark Waid]]'s comic [[Kingdom Come (comic)|Kingdom Come]].  He is shown with the rest of the Charlton 'Action Heroes' as a member of Magog's Justice Battalion, but apparently left before the death of [[Captain Atom]].  He would be shown later in the title in a blue beetle armor outfit, powered by the mystic scarab, working with [[Batman]]'s team, before being killed with most of the other heroes at the end.

==Trivia==
*In many stories and character entries, it is noted that "Ted" is an abbreviated form of "Theodore".   The character [[Barbara Gordon]] in writer [[Chuck Dixon]]'s ''Birds of Prey'' has clarified that "Ted" is actually short for Edward.  A similar truncation exists for Senator Edward Kennedy, known as [[Ted Kennedy]].

==Footnotes==
* {{fnb|1}} Three early comics creators used the pseudonym "Charles Nicholas". [[Jack Kirby]] used it only as the [[Fox Feature Syndicate]] in-house author's name for the 1940 comic strip ''The Blue Beetle''. The remaining two creators are Chuck Cuidera (c. 1915-2001) and Charles Wojtkowski (1921-1982). According to Cuidera, speaking on a panel at the 1999 [[San Diego ComicCon]] (transcription published Sept. 1, 2000) [http://povonline.com/cols/COL305.htm], he is the Charles Nicholas who created the Blue Beetle and was the first artist of [[Blackhawk (comics)|Blackhawk]]. [[Will Eisner]], at that same panel, said an artist named Charles Wojtkowski (1921-1982) later took up the Charles Nicholas pen name.

* {{fnb|2}} Both the original Dan Garrett Blue Beetle and the Ted Kord Blue Beetle were adapted in the [[Alan Moore]] comic book miniseries ''[[Watchmen]]'' as The Nite Owl. The original BB was the basis for the original Nite Owl, while the Ted Kord BB was the basis for the second Nite Owl.  The Watchmen were all version of Charlton characters.

* {{fnb|3}} The Blue Beetle has guest-starred in comics of an indepedent publisher called [[AC Comics|Americomics]].
