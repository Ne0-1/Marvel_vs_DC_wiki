'''Loki''' (Loki Laufeyson) is a [[fictional character|character]], a [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain]],  based upon the [[Loki]] of [[Norse mythology]]. Loki made his first Marvel Comics appearance in ''[[Venus (comics)|Venus]]'' #6 (August, 1949), where Loki was inaccurately featured as a member of the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian gods]] exiled to the [[Hades|Underworld]]. He made his first official Marvel appearance in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' Volume 1 #85 (October, 1962), where Loki was reintroduced by brothers and co-writers [[Stan Lee]] and [[Larry Lieber]] and he was redesigned by [[Jack Kirby]].

==Publication history==

Loki has appeared in various issues of ''Journey Into Mystery'', ''Thor'', and several other [[Marvel Universe]] titles. Marvel eventually found the character popular enough to let Robert Rodi proceed with writing a mini-series that features a different look at the character. The mini-series have beautifully painted covers and painted interior pages by artist Esad Ribic. The miniseries establishes a situation where Loki is successful in taking over Asgard. The only thing that could defeat him, is himself.

==Character biography==
===Origin===
Loki himself is not a member of the [[Asgardians (comics)|Asgardians]], but is actually the son of [[Laufey]], the deceased monarch of the [[Jotun|Frost Giants]], the ancient enemies of the Asgardians.  [[Odin (comics)|Odin]] himself led the Asgardians into battle against the Frost Giants and killed Laufey in personal combat.  

After slaying Laufey, Odin found a small god-sized child hidden within the primary stronghold of the Frost Giants.  The child was Loki, and Laufey kept him hidden from his people due to his shame over his son's small size.  Odin took the boy, out of a combination of pity and because he was the son of a worthy adversary slain in honorable combat, and raised him as his son alongside his biological son [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].

===Resentment===
Throughout their childhood and into adolescence, Loki was resentful of the differences in which he and Thor were treated by the citizens of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]].  The Asgardians valued great strength, tenacity, and bravery in battle above all things and Loki was clearly inferior to his stepbrother Thor in these areas.  However, Loki's gifts lied in other areas, most notably [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]].  Loki possessed a natural affinity to command great magical forces and hoped to somehow use these powers to become the most powerful god in all of Asgard and to destroy Thor.

As Loki grew to adulthood, his natural talent for causing mischief would manifest itself and earned himself a nickname as the '''God of Mischief'''.  However, instead of playing harmless pranks, his deeds grew steadily more malicious and his lust for both power and revenge was apparent to all those around him.  In time, his nickname grew from being a playful and mischievous [[Trickster|trickster]] god to the "God of [[Evil]]".  

Over the centuries, Loki would try to seize rulership of Asgard and to destroy Thor on many occasions.  Odin, who had long tolerated Loki's attempts, magically imprisoned Loki within a tree.  Loki would eventually free himself from his prison and his thirst for power and vengeance became even more consuming than it had ever been, if that were even possible.

Loki and Thor would clash more and more times, sometimes with Loki confronting Thor directly and sometimes using various pawns in order to achieve his ends.  Among Loki's more well known henchmen was the human criminal Carl "The Crusher" Creel, whom Loki would use his sorcery to transform into the superhuman criminal known as The [[Absorbing Man]], who himself would prove to be a formidable adversary to Thor over the years.   Loki would even go so far as to attempt to turn Odin against Thor and to steal Thor's enchanted hammer, [[Mjolnir (Marvel Comics)|Mjolnir]], all of which failed.

Loki's schemes would eventually come to include [[Earth]] itself and these schemes would often draw some of Earth's superhuman heroes to defend Earth and, often, [[Asgard (comics)|
Asgard]] itself.  Loki was able to manipulate the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] into wreaking havoc and, accidentally, would lead to the formation of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].  To make matters worse, Thor would be one of the founding members of the superhuman team and often found himself undone by them, many times, even when it seemed that his goals were within his grasp.  

However, despite Loki's loathing for Thor and Odin, Loki would help to defend Asgard from destruction from [[Surtur]] and his fire demons.  However, this was only because Surtur's goal was to destroy Asgard and Loki sought only to rule it.  

===Recently===
It has been prophesied that Loki will lead Asgard's enemies into the "Eternal Realm" and aid them in destroying it in a final conflict known as [[Ragnarok]], or sometimes referred to as "The Twilight of the Gods".

Loki fulfilled the prophecy of leading the enemies of Asgard against the Asgardians.  This battle consumed all who participated in it and it was revealed that the cycle of the birth, lives, and death of the Asgardians was a continuing cycle presided over by beings known only as "Those Who Sit Above". Thor, Loki's stepbrother and monarch of the Asgardians after Odin perished in battle against Surtur months earlier, was able to put an end to this continuing cycle and caused his own death.  All Asgardians perished in this last Ragnarok. But this time "Those Who Sit Above" followed them in death and were unable to revive them. Whether the Asgardians will receive a [[Reincarnation|reincarnation]] after this final battle is uncertain.

==Other versions==
===Guardians of the Galaxy===
In the reality of [[Guardians of the Galaxy|Earth-691]], Loki is alive and well in the [[31st century|31st Century]].
===MC2===
In the reality of [[MC2|Earth-982]], Loki took control of several heroes and sought to force them to murder others. This plot was eventually foiled by that reality's Captain America. In battle, Loki slew Cap. Because of his actions, Loki was banished to the limbo realm and was joined by the Hulk who intended to punish him.
===Earth X===
In the reality of [[Earth X|Earth-9997]], Loki duped Odin into transforming Thor into a woman and he casted a spell across Bifrost that would prevent Thor from returning to Earth if he ever returned to Asgard. Among several heroes, in this reality, he opposed the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]] due to finding out the falsehood of the Asgardians' origins. By doing so, Loki signing his death warrant. Due to his death in battle, he became an angelic being with a very ambiguous appearance. With his new state, he was instrumental in defeating the Absorbing Man and he later formed the new Avengers and became the new Thor.

===Ultimate Universe===
Loki appears in the second volume of [[Ultimates|The Ultimates]] as the evil half brother of Thor. Loki comes to Earth after escaping from the Room With No Doors and begins to cause havoc, especially for Thor and the United States of America after assembling a team of anti-American super villians. In this version, Loki has the ability to "shuffle time and space," essentially retconning history in the Ultimate Universe. Through this power he creates the persona of "Gunnar Golmen," the head scientist of the Norwegian extension of the "European Defense Initiative," the European counterpart to The Ultimates. Through his powers he re-writes history, turning Thor into "Thorlief," Gunnar's brother, a former mental patient who stole the technology that Gunnar created for the Initiative. Most recently (at the end of Ultimates 2 #9) it was officially confirmed that both Loki and Thor were infact the Norse Gods they claimed to be, resolving one of the long unsolved plot lines in the series.

==Powers and abilities==
Despite being a member of the Frost Giants, Loki possessed similar attributes to those possessed by the Asgardians.  

Loki possessed a degree of superhuman strength that seemed to be roughly equal to that of the average male Asgardian and could lift roughly 30 tons.  Loki aged at a rate vastly slower than human beings and was extremely long lived, though he didn't possess the completely retarded aging process of other god pantheons, such as the Olympians.  Loki's body was immune to all known Earthly diseases and infections and was possessed some degree of invulnerability to physical injury.  Loki, at times, imbued himself with magical abilities that enable him to withstand injuries that would prove fatal to another Asgardian, such as being beheaded. Loki's Frost Giant metabolism granted him superhuman levels of physical stamina in practically all activities.

Loki possessed the ability to generate and control a great quantity of mystical abilities for a variety of purposes.  He could project powerful beams of concussive force, the creation of highly durable magical force fields, the temporary increase of his own physical strength and stamina, granting superhuman abilities to living beings or inanimate objects, to fly at great speeds, interdimensional teleportation, etc. 

Apparently, Loki possessed some extrasensory abilities that resembled psionic powers.  For instance, Loki could project his thoughts across great distances, even across dimensional barriers.  However, Loki could not read the minds of other beings, nor could he control their actions.

Aside from all of these mystical abilities, Loki was always depicted with a brilliant intellect. However, his passionate hatred of Thor, lust for power, and his tendency to alienate himself through his ignoble actions greatly impeded his ability to bring his well laid plans to fruition.
