'''Loki''' '''(Loki Laufeyson)''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] appearing in the {{Marvel Universe}}. Based on the god of the [[Loki|same name]] from [[Nordic mythology]], and created by writer [[Stan Lee]], scripter [[Larry Lieber]] and penciller  [[Jack Kirby]]. 

Loki is a formidable foe in [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor's]] [[rogues gallery]], and arguably the thunder god's [[archenemy]]. He has clashed with Thor many times, sometimes using various pawns in order to achieve his ends. Loki himself is not actually a member of the [[Asgardians (Marvel Comics)|Asgardians]], but is actually the son of [[Laufey]], the deceased monarch of the [[Giants (Marvel Comics)|Frost Giants]], the ancient enemies of the Asgardians. [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]] himself led the Asgardians into battle against the Frost Giants and killed Laufey in personal combat. Perhaps Loki's most important contribution to the Marvel Universe is that the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] were formed to fight him. 

==Publication history==
Loki made his first Marvel Comics appearance in ''[[Venus (Marvel Comics)|Venus]]'' #6 (August 1949), where Loki was inaccurately featured as a member of the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian gods]] exiled to the [[Hades|Underworld]].  He made his first official Marvel appearance in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]''  #85 (October 1962), where Loki was reintroduced by brothers and co-writers [[Stan Lee]] and [[Larry Lieber]] and he was redesigned by [[Jack Kirby]]. Loki has appeared in various issues of ''Journey Into Mystery'', ''Thor'', ''the Avengers'' and several other [[Marvel Universe]] titles. 

Marvel eventually found the character popular enough to let Robert Rodi proceed with writing a mini-series, ''Loki'' #1-4 (July 2004 - October 2004), that features a different look at the character. The mini-series features painted covers and painted interior pages by artist Esad Ribic.

==Fictional character biography==
After slaying Laufey, Odin found a small Asgardian-sized child hidden within the primary stronghold of the Frost Giants.  The child was Loki, and Laufey kept him hidden from his people due to his shame over his son's small size. Odin took the boy, out of a combination of pity and because he was the son of a worthy adversary slain in honorable combat, and raised him as his son alongside his biological son Thor.  It should be noted that in Norse mythology, Thor and Loki are frequent travelling companions.  Loki finds himself in numerous situations where his mischievous deeds find him at odds with the Aesir.  He is responsible for many of the gods' magic items as payment for the wrongs he has committed.  Loki is also blood brothers with Odin, and bound away for his major role in the murder of Baldur.

Throughout their childhood and into adolescence, Loki was resentful of the differences in which he and Thor were treated by the citizens of [[Asgard (Marvel Comics)|Asgard]].  The Asgardians valued great strength, tenacity, and bravery in battle above all things and Loki was clearly inferior to his foster brother Thor in these areas. However, Loki's gifts lay in other areas, most notably [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]]. He possessed a natural affinity to command great magical forces and hoped to somehow use these powers to become the most powerful god in all of Asgard and to destroy Thor. As Loki grew to adulthood, his natural talent for causing mischief would manifest itself and earned him a nickname as the God of Lies and Mischief. However, instead of playing harmless pranks, he grew steadily more malicious in his deeds, and his lust for both power and revenge was apparent to all those around him. In time, his nickname grew from being a playful and mischievous [[trickster]] god to the "God of [[Evil]]". Over the centuries, Loki attempted on many occasions to seize rulership of Asgard and to destroy Thor. Odin, who had long tolerated Loki's attempts, magically imprisoned him within a tree. Loki eventually freed himself from his prison, and his thirst for power and vengeance became even more consuming than it had been.

Loki's schemes eventually came to include [[Earth]] itself and these schemes often drew some of Earth's superhuman heroes to defend Earth and, often, Asgard itself. Loki was able to manipulate the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] into wreaking havoc, which accidentally led to the formation of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. 

Thor was one of the founding members of this superhuman team, and Loki often found his goals frustrated by them, even when they appeared close to success. Among Loki's better known henchmen was the human criminal Carl "The Crusher" Creel, whom Loki transformed by sorcery into the superhuman criminal known as the [[Absorbing Man]].<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #114</ref>  Creel himself would proved to be a formidable adversary to Thor over the years. Loki even went so far as to attempt to turn Odin against Thor and to steal Thor's enchanted hammer, [[Mjolnir (Marvel Comics)|Mjolnir]], but all his efforts failed. However, despite Loki's loathing for half-brother and father, Loki helped to defend Asgard from destruction from [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]] and his fire demons. This was because Surtur's goal was to destroy Asgard, whereas Loki sought only to rule it. Loki would actually die at the hands of Thor's, although, manipulation of the time stream would bring him back. Loki formed the group of villains that engineered the Acts of Vengeance. He battled the combined forces of the West Coast Aengers and the Avengers.

On another occasion, Loki actually worked with [[Spider-Man]] to stop Morwen, a Lord of Chaos, from destroying the world, although Loki was partly motivated by the desire to save his daughter, who was currently being used by Morwen as a host. Morwen herself helped in the fight, utilizing the will and fortitude that came from being a descendant of Loki. During this incident it is discovered Loki has many children. Afterwards, Loki promises [[Spider-Man]] a favor. 

It has been prophesied that Loki will lead Asgard's enemies into the "Eternal Realm" and aid them in destroying it in a final conflict known as [[Ragnar√∂k]], or sometimes referred to as "The Twilight of the Gods". Loki fulfilled the prophecy of leading the enemies of Asgard against the Asgardians. This battle consumed all who participated in it and it was revealed that the cycle of the birth, lives, and death of the Asgardians was a continuing cycle presided over by beings known only as "'''Those Who Sit Above in Shadow'''". Thor, Loki's foster brother and monarch of the Asgardians after Odin perished in battle against Surtur months earlier, was able to put an end to this continuing cycle. All Asgardians perished in this last Ragnarok except for Thor who would disappear into a deep sleep. But this time "Those Who Sit Above" followed them in death and were unable to revive them. With Thor's recent return, it has been revealed that Asgardians now exist on Earth in mortal guises.  

After the Ragnarok, Loki returned, only that "he" is now a she and has been working with [[Doctor Doom]], plotting to manipulate events so that Thor unwittingly resurrects his greatest enemies.

==Powers and abilities==
Loki possessed similar attributes to those possessed by the Asgardians, despite being a member of the Frost Giants. He possesses a degree of superhuman strength that seemed to be roughly equal to that of the average male Asgardian. His Frost Giant metabolism granted him superhuman levels of physical stamina in practically all activities. At times he imbued himself with magical abilities that enable him to withstand injuries that would prove fatal to another Asgardian, such as being beheaded. He aged at a rate vastly slower than human beings and was extremely long lived, though he did not possess the same aging process as other god pantheons, such as the Olympians. His body was immune to all known Earthly diseases and infections and possessed some degree of resistance to physical injury. 

Loki possessed the ability to generate and control a great quantity of mystical abilities for a variety of purposes. He could project powerful beams of concussive force, create highly durable magical force fields, temporarily increase his own physical strength and stamina, grant superhuman abilities to living beings or inanimate objects, fly at great speeds, and teleport interdimensionally. Apparently, Loki possessed some extrasensory abilities that resembled psionic powers. For instance, he could project his thoughts across great distances, even across dimensional barriers. However, he could not read the minds of other beings, though he could control their actions.

Aside from all of these mystical abilities, Loki was always depicted with a brilliant intellect. However, his passionate hatred of Thor, lust for power, and tendency to alienate others by his ignoble actions greatly impeded his ability to bring his well laid plans to fruition. Loki revealed during an encounter with [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]] that he is fully aware he is a fictional character in a comic book.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Universe===
Loki appears in the second volume of ''[[Ultimates|The Ultimates]]'' as the evil half brother of [[Ultimate Thor|Thor]].
The Ultimate version of Loki has the ability to "shuffle time and space", and thus, in his first appearance caused a ripple during Thor's conversation with [[Volstagg]]. In the restaurant, Loki is apparently in the background which would mark his first "appearance" (he is mentioned and his powers apparently used, but he is only briefly seen). Loki comes to Earth after escaping from the Room Without Doors and begins to cause havoc, especially for Thor and the [[United States]] after assisting the [[Liberators (comics)|Liberators]]. Through his power he creates the persona for himself of "Gunnar Golmen," the head scientist of the Norwegian extension of the "European Defense Initiative," the European counterpart to The Ultimates, and turns Thor into "Thorlief," Gunnar's brother, a former mental patient who stole the technology that Gunnar created for the Initiative.  

Later in the story, he confronts the captive Thor and gloats, claiming that it is all just another one of their games, and informs him that there is a traitor in the ranks of the Ultimates. When Thor requests assistance from the guards, Loki is nowhere to be seen, though he appears as a snake around Thor's neck after they leave (most likely a nod to the real Loki in Norse mythology). Most recently (at the end of ''Ultimates 2'' #9), Loki has stated that the reason he joined the Liberators was that "They had a Norse god on their side.  It's only fair you should get one too", and that "Odin sent his son to bring the world peace. I couldn't resist the opportunity to mess that up." However, he is hesitant to use his abilities overtly, as he claims Odin will then be able to find him. Yet, once all The Liberators are defeated, he decides to do things himself. After revealing to The Ultimates who he was, he rises into the air and changing the color of the sky. At that moment though, the sky opens and Thor, his brother, appears for revenge.

Issue 13 shows further demonstrations of his power by attempting to trap Thor in an illusion and withstanding a direct blow from Thor's hammer uninjured, claiming it cannot hurt him.  During this battle Thor mentions that Loki's powers have for an unexplained reason weakened.  After summoning an army of monsters to battle the Ultimates and nearly killing Thor, the thunder god then proceeds to summon allies from Asgard while he hits Loki on the head with his hammer before either killing him or sending him back to Asgard where Odin awaits him. 

Loki's motivation for his actions is not completely revealed.  He mentions several motivations from a desire to cause World War III to Odin favoring Thor over him and attempting to gain Odin's favor. Throughout the whole ordeal Loki regards humans as mere playthings for his pranks.  In addition to making a Norwegian super-soldier programming and people thinking it was real even though Norway was not part of the European Union he claimed to have been the one who framed Captain America for treason, regarding the failure of humans to realize the problems with these assertions as humorous.

===MC2===
In the reality of [[MC2|Earth-982]], Loki decides to bring an end to the "Age of Heroes", still regretting the fact that his actions led to the creation of the Avengers. In the series ''[[Last Hero Standing]]'', he kidnaps several major superheroes, brainwashes them so that they are more violent, and returns them to Earth so that they will destroy their reputations, knowing that his spell will be permanent the moment they shed innocent blood. Eventually, this plot is foiled by the superheroes of earth, most especially that reality's Captain America, who shatters the gem Loki was using to create the spell before any innocents can be killed. In battle, Loki badly injuries Captain America, but, because of his actions, Loki is banished to the limbo realm and is joined by the Hulk, who intends to punish him for affecting the Hulk with his spell and driving him to attack the other heroes.

Within the ''[[A-Next|Avengers Next]]'' miniseries it is revealed that Loki's daughter {within the MC2 universe}, [[Sylene (comics)|Sylene]], is on a mission to restore Asgard, as a way to honor her father and to prove herself to the Asgardians.  Unfortunately, her plan is not only to transform Midgard/Earth into a version of Asgard, but also to eliminate the Avengers, since Loki was blaming himself for his part of indirectly creating the team.

===Marvel 2099===
In the [[Marvel 2099]] line of series, the original Asgardians were no more. However, belief in them had grown into a full-fledged religion with many followers. Seeking to take advantage of this, a corporation called '''Alchemax''' decided to create their own [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]]. One of the company's scientists, Jordan Boone, decided that he wanted to have powers and sneaked himself into the program. He ensured that he avoided the receiving of a computer chip implant which would give him falsified memories of his godhood. Jordan became the Loki of the program, but fled before the program and their floating fortress were destroyed. He later reappeared and remade himself as the villainous [[Halloween Jack (comics)|Halloween Jack]] who went about trying to warp the entire world with a '''Virtual Unreality Projector'''. His plan would have succeeded if not for [[Doom 2099|President Doom]] stepping in with the help of the [[X-Men 2099|X-Men]] [[Meanstreak (comics)|Meanstreak]] and [[Krystalin]]. Halloween Jack was supposedly killed in ''2099 World of Tomorrow'' #2, but made an unexpected [[cameo appearance|cameo]] in ''X-Force'' #92. He was somehow pulled from the timestream before his death and redeposited in the present where he pestered [[Domino (comics)|Domino]]. Since then his resident time period and/or location have been unknown.

===Earth X===
In the reality of [[Earth X|Earth-9997]], Loki duped Odin into transforming Thor into a woman and he cast a spell across Bifrost that would prevent Thor from returning to Earth if he ever returned to Asgard. Among several heroes, in this reality, he opposed the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]] due to finding out the falsehood of the Asgardians' origins. Realising that his form was actually solely dependent on his convictions (as that of all Asgardians), he became an angelic being with a very ambiguous appearance. With his new state, he was instrumental in defeating the Absorbing Man and he later formed the new Avengers and became the new Thor.

===Guardians of the Galaxy===
In the [[Guardians of the Galaxy]] timeline (Earth-691), Loki is alive and well in the [[31st century|31st Century]].
