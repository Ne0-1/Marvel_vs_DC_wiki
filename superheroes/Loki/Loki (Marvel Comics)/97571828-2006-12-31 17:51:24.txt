'''Loki''' (Loki Laufeyson) is a [[fictional]] [[comic book]] [[character]], a [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain]],  based upon the [[Loki]] of [[Norse mythology]]. Loki made his first Marvel Comics appearance in ''[[Venus (comics)|Venus]]'' #6 (August 1949), where Loki was inaccurately featured as a member of the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian gods]] exiled to the [[Hades|Underworld]]. He made his first official Marvel appearance in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' (1st series) #85 (October 1962), where Loki was reintroduced by brothers and co-writers [[Stan Lee]] and [[Larry Lieber]] and he was redesigned by [[Jack Kirby]]. Perhaps Loki's most important contribution to the Marvel Universe is that the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] were formed to fight him.

==Publication history==
Loki has appeared in various issues of ''Journey Into Mystery'', ''Thor'', ''the Avengers'' and several other [[Marvel Universe]] titles. Marvel eventually found the character popular enough to let Robert Rodi proceed with writing a mini-series that features a different look at the character. The mini-series features painted covers and painted interior pages by artist Esad Ribic. The miniseries establishes a situation where Loki is successful in taking over Asgard.

==Character biography==
===Origin===
Loki himself is not a member of the [[Asgardians (comics)|Asgardians]], but is actually the son of [[Laufey]], the deceased monarch of the [[Giants (Marvel Comics)|Frost Giants]], the ancient enemies of the Asgardians.  [[Odin (comics)|Odin]] himself led the Asgardians into battle against the Frost Giants and killed Laufey in personal combat.  

After slaying Laufey, Odin found a small Asgardian-sized child hidden within the primary stronghold of the Frost Giants.  The child was Loki, and Laufey kept him hidden from his people due to his shame over his son's small size.  Odin took the boy, out of a combination of pity and because he was the son of a worthy adversary slain in honorable combat, and raised him as his son alongside his biological son [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].

===Resentment===
Throughout their childhood and into adolescence, Loki was resentful of the differences in which he and Thor were treated by the citizens of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]].  The Asgardians valued great strength, tenacity, and bravery in battle above all things and Loki was clearly inferior to his foster brother Thor in these areas.  However, Loki's gifts lay in other areas, most notably [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]].  Loki possessed a natural affinity to command great magical forces and hoped to somehow use these powers to become the most powerful god in all of Asgard and to destroy Thor.

As Loki grew to adulthood, his natural talent for causing mischief would manifest itself and earned himself a nickname as the '''God of Mischief'''.  However, instead of playing harmless pranks, his deeds grew steadily more malicious and his lust for both power and revenge was apparent to all those around him.  In time, his nickname grew from being a playful and mischievous [[trickster]] god to the "God of [[Evil]]".  

Over the centuries, Loki would try to seize rulership of Asgard and to destroy Thor on many occasions.  Odin, who had long tolerated Loki's attempts, magically imprisoned Loki within a tree.  Loki would eventually free himself from his prison and his thirst for power and vengeance became even more consuming than it had ever been, if that were even possible.

Loki and Thor would clash more and more times, sometimes with Loki confronting Thor directly and sometimes using various pawns in order to achieve his ends.  Among Loki's more well known henchmen was the human criminal Carl "The Crusher" Creel, whom Loki would use his sorcery to transform into the superhuman criminal known as The [[Absorbing Man]], who himself would prove to be a formidable adversary to Thor over the years.   Loki would even go so far as to attempt to turn Odin against Thor and to steal Thor's enchanted hammer, [[Mjolnir (Marvel Comics)|Mjolnir]], all of which failed.

Loki's schemes would eventually come to include [[Earth]] itself and these schemes would often draw some of Earth's superhuman heroes to defend Earth and, often, [[Asgard (comics)|
Asgard]] itself.  Loki was able to manipulate the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] into wreaking havoc and, accidentally, would lead to the formation of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].  To make matters worse, Thor would be one of the founding members of the superhuman team and often found himself undone by them, many times, even when it seemed that his goals were within his grasp.  

However, despite Loki's loathing for Thor and Odin, Loki would help to defend Asgard from destruction from [[Surtur]] and his fire demons.  However, this was only because Surtur's goal was to destroy Asgard and Loki sought only to rule it.

===Recently===
It has been prophesied that Loki will lead Asgard's enemies into the "Eternal Realm" and aid them in destroying it in a final conflict known as [[Ragnarok]], or sometimes referred to as "The Twilight of the Gods".

Loki fulfilled the prophecy of leading the enemies of Asgard against the Asgardians.  This battle consumed all who participated in it and it was revealed that the cycle of the birth, lives, and death of the Asgardians was a continuing cycle presided over by beings known only as "Those Who Sit Above in Shadow". Thor, Loki's foster brother and monarch of the Asgardians after Odin perished in battle against Surtur months earlier, was able to put an end to this continuing cycle.  All Asgardians perished in this last Ragnarok except for Thor who would disappear into a deep sleep. But this time "Those Who Sit Above" followed them in death and were unable to revive them. Whether the Asgardians will receive a [[reincarnation]] after this final battle is uncertain.

==Powers and abilities==
Despite being a member of the Frost Giants, Loki possessed similar attributes to those possessed by the Asgardians.  

Loki possesses a degree of superhuman strength that seemed to be roughly equal to that of the average male Asgardian.  Loki aged at a rate vastly slower than human beings and was extremely long lived, though he didn't possess the same aging process like other god pantheons, such as the Olympians.  Loki's body was immune to all known Earthly diseases and infections and possessed some degree of invulnerability to physical injury.  Loki, at times, imbued himself with magical abilities that enable him to withstand injuries that would prove fatal to another Asgardian, such as being beheaded. Loki's Frost Giant metabolism granted him superhuman levels of physical stamina in practically all activities.

Loki possessed the ability to generate and control a great quantity of mystical abilities for a variety of purposes.  He could project powerful beams of concussive force, the creation of highly durable magical force fields, the temporary increase of his own physical strength and stamina, granting superhuman abilities to living beings or inanimate objects, to fly at great speeds, interdimensional teleportation, etc. 

Apparently, Loki possessed some extrasensory abilities that resembled psionic powers.  For instance, Loki could project his thoughts across great distances, even across dimensional barriers.  However, Loki could not read the minds of other beings, he could control their actions.

Aside from all of these mystical abilities, Loki was always depicted with a brilliant intellect. However, his passionate hatred of Thor, lust for power, and his tendency to alienate himself through his ignoble actions greatly impeded his ability to bring his well laid plans to fruition.

Loki revealed during an encounter with [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]] that he is fully aware he is a fictional character in a comic book.

==Other versions==
===Guardians of the Galaxy===
In the reality of [[Guardians of the Galaxy|Earth-691]], Loki is alive and well in the [[31st century|31st Century]].

===Heroes Reborn===
In the controversial ''[[Heroes Reborn]]'' storyline of the late 1990s, the [[Fantastic Four]] and Avengers were transported into a pocket universe populated by duplicates of many individuals from their home universe, who were different and similar to varying degrees. This pocket universe was subconciously sculpted by [[Franklin Richards]], and did not include an Asgard, but rather than accept this as the natural order of things, the Loki native to this universe sought to discern why this should be. Eventually coming to realise that he and the rest of the pocket universe were the creations of Franklin, he began using this to his advantage, deconstructing other villains created as part of the universe and absorbing them into himself so that he might grow in power and transcend his existence as a facsimile. Seeking more power, Loki then utilised a rip in the fabric of reality to generate new versions of various Avengers villains' from the heroes' home universe, who he then pitted against them, and absorbed when they were defeated. With the truth of his actions revealed, however, Loki was forced to absorb energy from the rift directly, growing to a gigantic size, but was eventually defeated by the assembled forces of his former allies, the Avengers, and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]. Later, during the Heroes Return storyline, Loki appeared alive, only to be crushed by [[Ashema]].

===MC2===
In the reality of [[MC2|Earth-982]], Loki decided to bring an end to the "Age of Heroes", still regretting the fact that his actions led to the creation of the Avengers.  In the series ''[[Last Hero Standing]]'',  Loki kidnaps several major superheroes, brainwashes them so that they are more violent, and returns them to Earth so that they will destroy their reputations.  Eventually, this plot was foiled by the superheroes of earth, most especially that reality's Captain America. In battle, Loki slew Captain America. Because of his actions, Loki was banished to the limbo realm and was joined by the Hulk who intended to punish him.

===Marvel 2099===
In the [[Marvel 2099]] line of series, the original Asgardians were no more. However, belief in them had grown into a full-fledged religion with many followers. Seeking to take advantage of this, a corporation called '''Alchemax''' decided to create their own [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]]. One of the company's scientists, Jordan Boone, decided that he wanted to have powers and snuck himself into the program while avoiding receiving a computer chip implant which would give him falsified memories of his godhood. Jordan became the Loki of the program, but fled before the program and their floating fortress were destroyed. He later reappeared and remade himself as the villainous [[Halloween Jack (comics)|Halloween Jack]] who went about trying to warp the entire world with a '''Virtual Unreality Projector'''. His plan would have succeeded if not for [[Doom 2099|President Doom]] stepping in with the help of the [[X-Men 2099|X-Men]] [[Meanstreak (comics)|Meanstreak]] and [[Krystalin]]. Halloween Jack was supposedly killed in ''2099 World of Tomorrow'' #2, but made an unexpected [[cameo]] in ''X-Force'' #92. He was somehow pulled from the timestream before his death and redeposited in the present where he pestered [[Domino (comics)|Domino]]. His whereabouts after [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]] remain to be seen.

===Earth X===
In the reality of [[Earth X|Earth-9997]], Loki duped Odin into transforming Thor into a woman and he cast a spell across Bifrost that would prevent Thor from returning to Earth if he ever returned to Asgard. Among several heroes, in this reality, he opposed the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]] due to finding out the falsehood of the Asgardians' origins. Realising that his form was actually solely dependent on his convictions (as that of all Asgardians), he became an angelic being with a very ambiguous appearance. With his new state, he was instrumental in defeating the Absorbing Man and he later formed the new Avengers and became the new Thor.

===Ultimate Universe===
Loki appears in the second volume of ''[[Ultimates|The Ultimates]]'' as the evil half brother of [[Ultimate Thor|Thor]].
Thor attempts to explain that he realized that Loki has the ability to "shuffle time and space", and thus, caused a ripple during Thor's conversation with [[Volstagg]]. In the restaurant, Loki is apparently in the background which would mark his first "appearance" (he is mentioned and his powers apparently used, but he is not seen). Loki comes to Earth after escaping from the Room Without Doors and begins to cause havoc, especially for Thor and the [[United States of America]] after assisting the [[The Liberators (Marvel Comics)|Liberators]]. In this version, Loki claims to have the ability to "shuffle time and space," essentially [[retcon|retconning]] history in the Ultimate Universe. Through this power he creates the persona for himself of "Gunnar Golmen," the head scientist of the Norwegian extension of the "European Defense Initiative," the European counterpart to The Ultimates, and turns Thor into "Thorlief," Gunnar's brother, a former mental patient who stole the technology that Gunnar created for the Initiative.  

Later in the story he confronts the captive Thor and gloats, claiming that it's all just another one of their games and informs him that there is a traitor in the ranks of the Ultimates.  When Thor requests assistance from the guards, Loki is nowhere to be seen, though he appears as a snake around Thor's neck after they leave (most likely a nod to the real Loki in Norse mythology). Most recently (at the end of ''Ultimates 2'' #9) Loki stated that the reason he joined the Liberators was since "They had a norse god on their side.  It's only fair you should get one too", and that "Odin sent his son to bring the world peace. I couldn't resist the opportunity to mess that up."  However, he is hesitant to use his abilities overtly, as he claims Odin will then be able to find him. Yet, once all The Liberators were defeated, he decided to do things himself. After revealing to The Ultimates who he was, he rose into the air. At that moment though, the sky opens and Thor, his brother, appears for revenge.

The Ultimate version of Loki appears to possess full blown [[Reality warping]] power, as opposed to the sorcery normally associated with his character.  The exact nature of his powers has not yet been elaborated on, but the statements made by Volstagg and several others that he "shuffles reality like playing cards" would seem to support the Reality Warping aspect of Loki's powers.  It should also be noted that in all instances where Loki's powers are described, Loki himself has been on scene using them to some degree, and so perhaps this is all just a ruse devised by him to make himself appear more powerful than he really is.

He also, as many fans have noted, bears a (probably deliberate) resemblance to comic book writer [[Neil Gaiman]], who recently joined Marvel Comics and has stated (in notes for his novel, [[American Gods]]), that his favourite God is Loki.
