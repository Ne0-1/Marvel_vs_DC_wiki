'''Loki''' is a fictional character, a [[supervillain]] that appears in publications by [[Marvel Universe|Marvel Comics]]. He is the adoptive brother and [[archnemesis|archenemy]] of the superhero [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. He is based on the being of the [[Loki|same name]] from [[Norse mythology]]. The character first appeared in ''[[Venus (Marvel Comics)|Venus]]'' #6 (August 1949) and was created by writer [[Stan Lee]], scripter [[Larry Lieber]], and penciller  [[Jack Kirby]].

In 2009, Loki was ranked as [[IGN]]'s 8th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.<ref>[http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/8.html Loki is number 8 ], [[IGN]].</ref>

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=July 2010}}
Loki made his first Marvel Comics appearance in [[Timely Comics]]' publication ''[[Venus (Marvel Comics)|Venus]]'' #6 (August 1949), where Loki was inaccurately featured as a member of the [[Olympians (Marvel Comics)|Olympian gods]] exiled to the [[Hades|Underworld]].  He made his first official Marvel appearance in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]''  #85 (October 1962), where Loki was reintroduced by brothers and co-writers [[Stan Lee]] and [[Larry Lieber]] and he was redesigned by [[Jack Kirby]]. Loki has appeared in various issues of ''Journey Into Mystery'', ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'', ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'', and several other [[Marvel Universe]] titles.

Marvel eventually found the character popular enough to let [[Robert Rodi]] proceed with writing a 4-issue miniseries, ''Loki'' (July–October 2004), that features a different look at the character. The miniseries features painted covers and interior pages by artist [[Esad Ribic]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Mayerson, Ginger and Poonsombat, Nirut |url=http://liheliso.com/buzz/archive/00000220.htm |title=Interview: Esad Ribic |publisher=The Journal of the Lincoln Heights Literary Society Miscellanea and Ephemeron |date=November 9, 2004 |accessdate=July 31, 2010 }}</ref>

Loki appears in the comic book series ''[[Thor: Son of Asgard]]'' #1-9 (2004), which follows [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'s early adventures in [[Asgard]] with [[Sif (Marvel Comics)|Sif]] and [[Balder (Marvel Comics)|Balder]].

Following the conclusion of "[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]" in "[[Siege (comics)|Siege]]", in which Loki played a key role, marvel launched another limited series, ''Loki'', written by [[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa]] with art by [[Sebastian Fiumara]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Dave |last=Richards |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=27138 |title=Aguirre-Sacasa Gets Mischievous With "Loki" |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=July 13, 2010 |accessdate=July 31, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Albert |last=Ching |url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/loki-aguirre-sacasa-100713.html |title=AGUIRRE-SACASA Details LOKI's Origin in October |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |date=July 13, 2010 |accessdate=September 27, 2010 }}</ref>

Loki appears in ''Thor: Ages of Thunder'' written by [[Matt Fraction]] and drawn by [[Patrick Zircher]]. It features some tales of Thor and Asgardians from past Ragnarök cycles.<ref>{{cite web|first=Dave |last=Richards |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=16236 |title=HAMMER TIMES PAST: Fraction & Zircher on "Thor: Ages of Thunder" |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=April 30, 2008 |accessdate=September 29, 2010 }}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
After slaying the King of the [[Giants (Marvel Comics)|Frost giants]] Laufey in battle, [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]] found a small Asgardian-sized child hidden within the primary stronghold of the Frost Giants. The child was Loki, and Laufey kept him hidden from his people due to his shame over his son's small size. Odin took the boy because he showed strength when Odin slew his father in combat and raised him as his son alongside his biological son [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].

===Growing up===
Throughout their childhood and into adolescence, Loki was resentful of the differences in which he and Thor were treated by the citizens of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]]. The Asgardians valued great strength, tenacity, and bravery in battle above all things and Loki was clearly inferior to his foster brother Thor in these areas. Loki's gifts lay in other areas, most notably [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]]. As Loki grew to adulthood, his natural talent for causing mischief would make itself manifest and earned him a nickname as the God of Lies and Mischief. He grew steadily more malicious in his deeds, and his lust for both power and revenge was apparent to all those around him. Several times he tried to use tricks to get rid of Thor, like telling him to guard a hole in the wall he had made. In time, his nickname grew from being a playful and mischievous [[trickster]] god to the "God of [[Evil]]". Over the centuries, Loki attempted on many occasions to seize rulership of Asgard and to destroy Thor. He even helped the Storm giant Ghan to escape Thor planning to get a debt from him later, and aided other enemies of Asgard, planning to take over. Odin, who had long tolerated Loki's attempts, magically imprisoned him within a tree until someone would shed a tear for him. Loki eventually freed himself by causing a leaf to strike [[Heimdall (Marvel Comics)|Heimdall]], the guardian of Bifrost, in the eye, which made him shed a tear. Loki compiled an extensive criminal record in Asgard, and was frequently exiled.<ref>[[Matt Fraction]] (w), [[Patrick Zircher]] (p), ''Thor: Ages of Thunder'' #1 (April 30, 2008), [[New York, NY]]: [[Marvel Comics]]</ref> After meeting the Sorceror Eldred, his mastery of black magic was increased. He repaid Eldrad by later giving him to the Fire demon Surtur.

===Battles with Earth's Heroes===
Loki's schemes eventually came to include [[Earth]] itself and these schemes often drew some of Earth's superhuman heroes to defend Earth and, often, Asgard itself. He first battled Thor on Earth in modern times after escaping from the tree<ref name="Journey into Mystery #85">''Journey into Mystery'' #85</ref> Loki then manipulated the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] into wreaking havoc using an illusion of dynamite on train tracks, while in astral form in an attempt to lure Thor to Asgard, which inadvertently led to the formation of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] as several other heroes came to meet the Hulk.<ref>''Avengers'' #1</ref>

Thor was one of the founding members of this superhuman team, and Loki often found his goals frustrated by them, even when they appeared close to success. Several times Loki, while not directly battling Thor himself, caused threats for Thor to battle, like increasing the mental powers of a carnival fortune teller Sandu making him powerful enough to lift buildings with his mind,<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #91</ref> and releasing a Lava man called Molto by accident when he caused a long-dead volcano to explode, who Thor mercifully returned to his people.<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #97</ref> He even released Mr Hyde and Cobra by paying their bail, then doubled their powers, but they were again defeated. Among Loki's better known henchmen was the human criminal Carl "The Crusher" Creel, whom Loki transformed into the superhuman criminal known as the [[Absorbing Man]].<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #114-115</ref>  Creel would prove to be a formidable adversary to Thor over the years. Loki went so far as to attempt to turn Odin against Thor and to steal Thor's enchanted hammer, [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]] in an attempt to free himself, but all his efforts failed. When he convinced Odin to go to Earth and leave him in charge of Asgard with part of the Odinforce, he released Skagg, the Storm Giant, and Surtur, the huge Fire Demon, to try and destroy Odin. However Thor and Balder helped defeat the monsters, and Loki was sent to serve the dwarfs. Loki was responsible for the Destroyer being awakened, by leading a Hunter to the Temple where the Destroyer armor resided using his mental abilities while Thor was nearby, causing the Hunter's soul to animate the armor, but Thor forced the Hunter to return to his body, then buried the armor under thousands of tons of rock.<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #118-#119</ref> When he tried to use the Absorbing Man to defeat Odin and take over Asgard, he and his ally were exiled into space due to a trick by Odin.<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #121-123 (1965)</ref> He sent his astral form back to Earth and took over the Destroyer, attempting to take over Asgard, but Odin used his powers to send Loki out of the Destroyer armor.<ref>''Thor Annual'' #2</ref>

===Taking over Asgard===
Loki's destiny to be the cause of Ragnarok was later recounted.<ref>''Thor'' #127</ref> Loki returned from his exile in space by Odin, and was stripped of his powers and exiled to Earth by Odin. Loki plotted to gain new powers from [[Karnilla]], although this accidentally resulted in violent criminal, the [[Wrecker (comics)|Wrecker]] gaining Asgardian powers when he was mistaken for Loki after knocking him out and putting on his helmet. He almost killed Thor by collapsing a building on him, as Thor had been stripped of all his powers except his strength by Odin. Loki then fomented a battle between Thor and the [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]] animated by [[Sif (Marvel Comics)|Sif]].<ref>''Thor'' #147-152</ref> Loki then took command of Asgard during the Odinsleep, and fled when Asgard was invaded by [[Mangog]].<ref>''Thor'' #154-157</ref>

Loki later usurped the throne of Asgard by taking the Odinring, but fled again when Asgard was invaded by [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]].<ref>''Thor'' #175-177</ref> Much later, Loki usurped the throne of Asgard again, and set the Destroyer against Thor once more.<ref>''Thor'' #264-266</ref> Shortly after that, Loki caused the temporary death of [[Balder (Marvel Comics)|Balder]] using mistletoe, as he had conspired with Hela to cause Ragnarok if his last plan failed. At this time, Loki's estranged wife [[Sigyn (Marvel Comics)|Sigyn]] returned to Asgard. When Loki was chained and a viper dripped poison onto his face as punishment for killing Balder, Sigyn tried helping him. Loki attempted to bring about Rangnarok, but was foiled by Odin.<ref>''Thor'' #273-278</ref> Alongside [[Tyr (Marvel Comics)|Tyr]] and his forces, Loki stole the golden apples of Idunna and invaded Asgard with help from the Midgard serpent, but then changed sides and aided Odin's forces in defeating Tyr.<ref>''Thor'' #327</ref>

Despite Loki's loathing for his half-brother and father, Loki helped to defend Asgard from destruction from Surtur and his fire demons. This was because Surtur's goal was to destroy Asgard, whereas Loki sought only to rule it. Alongside Odin and Thor, Loki battled Surtur, and witnessed the seeming demise of Odin.<ref>''Thor'' #353</ref> Not long after that, Loki transformed Thor into a frog for a time, using the Twilight Sword. Thor was turned back when Volstagg destroyed one of the machines Loki had used to transform Thor.<ref>''Thor'' #364-366</ref> He then involved the [[X-Men]] and [[Alpha Flight]] in a plot to gain favor with "'''Those Who Sit Above in Shadow'''".<ref>''X-Men & Alpha Flight'' #1-2</ref>

===Acts of Vengeance===
In disguise, Loki manipulated a group of master villains into engineering the "[[Acts of Vengeance]]". With these prime movers, he set in motion a plot against the Avengers and other heroes. He sent the Juggernaut against Thor, and cast a spell that caused temporary bouts of weakness in Thor. He battled the combined forces of the West Coast and East Coast Avengers. His identity was ultimately revealed, and he was defeated by the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' #310-313; ''Avengers Spotlight'' #26-28; ''Avengers West Coast'' #53-55</ref> Loki would actually die at the hands of Thor,<ref>''Thor'' #432</ref> although, manipulation of the time stream would later bring him back.{{Issue|date=June 2010}}

===Debt to Spider-Man===
Through a time traveling adventure with [[Doctor Strange]], Morwen, a foe of Strange's former master, is released. She is detected by both Loki and [[Spider-Man]], and she takes the body of Tessa Black, a child of Loki. When Spider-Man saves her, Loki proclaims he owes one debt to the wallcrawler.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #504</ref>

===Ragnarök===
It has been prophesied Loki would lead Asgard's enemies into the "Eternal Realm" and aid them in destroying it in a final conflict known as [[Ragnarök]], or sometimes referred to as "The Twilight of the Gods". Loki fulfilled the prophecy of leading the enemies of Asgard against the Asgardians, by forging Uru weapons for his army, after finding the forge used to create Thor's hammer Mjolnir. Not even Thor's hammer can break the shields, it is shattered in a nuclear-scale explosion. This battle consumed all who participated in it and it was revealed that the cycle of the birth, lives, and death of the Asgardians was a continuing cycle presided over by beings known only as "Those Who Sit Above in Shadow" for their amusement. Loki is decapitated by Thor and has his head preserved. Thor, Loki's foster brother and monarch of the Asgardians after Odin perished in battle against Surtur months earlier, is able to put an end to this continuing cycle. All Asgardians perished in this last Ragnarok except for Thor, who would disappear into a deep sleep. Yet this time, "Those Who Sit Above" followed them in death and were unable to revive them.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #80 - 85 (Aug. - Dec. 2004)</ref> With Thor's recent return, it was revealed Asgardians now exist on Earth in mortal guises.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 3, #1 (Sept. 2007)</ref>

===Return===
[[Image:FemaleLoki.PNG|Loki's female form. Art by Olivier Coipel.|thumb]]
After the Ragnarok, Loki returned in a new female form and was revealed to have been working with [[Doctor Doom]], plotting to manipulate events so Thor unwittingly resurrected his greatest Asgardian enemies.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 3, #5</ref>

After Loki's resurrection, she claimed to make a new vow: to never lie again.  However, she is now manipulating Balder to make him a new successor to the throne of Asgard, and potentially start a civil war against Thor.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 3, #9 (July 2008)</ref>

It was revealed that Loki retained his male form after Ragnarok but hid himself inside a female body (which originally belonged to Thor's reborn lover Sif) in order to sell to Thor the idea that he wished to change. Combining his magic with that of Hela, Loki traveled to the past and set into motion the events that led to his younger self being adopted by Odin, starting by turning Bor into snow. His reasons for doing this were later revealed as a means to eliminate Bor, Thor's grandfather.<ref>''Thor'' #12</ref>

===Secret Invasion===
Loki was with the Asgardians when she goaded them into believing the injured [[Beta Ray Bill]] was a [[Skrull]], resulting in a mob of Asgardians nearly attacking him, although Thor used his hammer to stop the rumor by showing Bill could lift it.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Thor'' #1</ref>

===Dark Reign===
Following the Skrulls defeat, she was introduced as a member of the [[Cabal (comics)|Cabal]], consisting of herself, [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]], [[Emma Frost]], Doctor Doom, [[Namor]], and the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]].<ref name="Secret Invasion #8">''Secret Invasion'' #8</ref>  Osborn gathered them to obtain their support for his plans for his "new world order." Osborn offers the Cabal solidarity and the resources to accomplish their own agendas. In return Osborn asks for their public support/registration, as well as cooperation fulfilling any request he may have of them. When asked what she wants, Loki responds she wants Asgard and wants it back in the heavens where it belongs.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Dark Reign'' #1</ref>

In ''Thor'' #600, it is revealed Loki traveled to the past to ensure Bor, father of Odin and first king of Asgard, perishes in battle against the Frost Giants. He turns the Asgardian king to snow after luring them to him with a Frost Giant. In the present day Loki revives Bor from some snow in New York City, but places a spell on him to mistake everything around him as an enemy, therefore attacking everything in sight. Further aggrieved by the belief that his son's failure to resurrect him can only mean he was killed in battle, when Thor arrives on the scene, Loki's enchantment causes Bor to see Thor as a monster. Sensing Odin's power inside what he sees as a demon, Bor attacks Thor, attempting to avenge his son. While Thor and Bor fight Loki makes Balder aware of Bor's identity and the two rush to New York to stop Thor from killing him (Thor never met Bor until now and is unaware of his identity). Thor is forced to kill Bor for fear of the entire planet being destroyed in the wake of their battle, due to Bor's vast power. In the aftermath of the battle, Loki reminds Balder that the resurrected Bor was technically the king of Asgard when Thor killed him, and the punishment for killing the king is banishment from Asgard. Balder is forced to agree. After Thor's banishment, Loki mentions to some disgruntled Asgardians she made arrangements to have all Asgardians, but not Asgard itself, moved to [[Latveria]] at the invitation of Doctor Doom.<ref>''Thor'' #600</ref>

Loki attends a dinner hosted by Doctor Doom along with Balder to secure a new home for the Asgardians in Latveria. She is caught off guard by Balder's insistence that since they are leaving Asgard, Thor should be allowed to rejoin them. Loki is able to calm Balder before he offends Doom too much. She later appears before Blake and Thor to tell them that she will be returning to her male form shortly and that he has come to the realization that his body was meant for Sif. Loki explains that, after Ragnarok, when the Asgardians were being placed into human hosts Sif's soul was placed into a dying human. When Thor sent out the call for the Asgardians to return, Sif's host was too weak to hear the call. When Thor mass-summoned the Asgardians, Sif's body was created but her soul could not be placed into it, so the body went looking for a soul with no body and found Loki. Loki goes on to say that the transfer from his female form to his male form will probably kill Sif's host and she urges Blake and Thor to find Sif and say goodbye.<ref>''Thor'' #601</ref> By the time Thor restores Sif, Loki is back in his male form.<ref>Thor #602</ref> Following the Hood's depowerment at the hands of [[Doctor Strange]], [[Brother Voodoo]], and the [[Daimon Hellstrom|Son of Satan]], Loki offers the Hood a second chance.<ref>''New Avengers'' #54</ref>

====Mighty Avengers====
The [[Scarlet Witch]] appears in her astral form recruiting a team of Avengers to face the [[Elder Gods (Marvel Comics)|Elder God]] [[Chthon (Marvel Comics)|Chthon]].<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #21</ref> It is soon revealed that Wanda is Loki in disguise. The Avengers, unaware of Loki's trick, follow the false "Wanda's" instructions.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #21-23</ref> Her goal is to throw [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] off balance, as shown during the second meeting of the Cabal, after Thor was banished due to her trickery, when Loki intended to put "cracks in Osborn's armor" and gradually "widen" these cracks through the Mighty Avengers. [[Quicksilver (comics)|Pietro Maximoff]], though desiring to see and converse with his sister, joins the Mighty Avengers after he races around the world searching for her, not knowing that his nephews [[Wiccan (comics)|Billy]] and [[Speed (comics)|Tommy]] have just done so and failed to find her either.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #24</ref>

However, Loki had planned on the deaths of Pietro and [[Cassandra Lang]], fearing they may be wedges in her plans. She cuts off communications from the former, and tries to convince Hank Pym to expel Cassie after placing a spell on her to prevent her from saying anything bad about her disguise. The latter, however, invites her fellow [[Young Avengers]] into the Infinite Avengers Mansion (an extension of the PymPocket), to prove that the Scarlet Witch is evil. When [[Wiccan (comics)|Wiccan]] casts a spell to bring Scarlet Witch to them, Loki appears as Scarlet Witch and states that Cassandra Lang sealed their fate. Just then, Ronin appears and ambushes "Scarlet Witch."<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #28</ref> He determines that she is not Wanda by kissing her and stating that the real Scarlet Witch would have used her power to revive Cassandra's father. Wiccan then chants a spell to reveal her true form. Afraid of exposure, Loki is forced to leave swearing all their deaths.<ref>''The Mighty Avengers'' #29</ref> The continued achievements of the Mighty Avengers strain Osborn to the breaking point. Loki decides to play the final card that will break Osborn by unleashing the Absorbing Man, who had absorbed the power of the [[Cosmic Cube]].<ref>''The Mighty Avengers'' #32</ref> In the [[Dark Avengers]], Loki is in Norman Osborn's office and manipulates him into becoming the Green Goblin again, as Siege begins.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #12</ref>

===''Siege''===
{{Main|Siege (comics)}}
Loki was present at the Cabal when Norman Osborn denied to bring Namor to Doctor Doom. When the Doombot posing as Doctor Doom unleashed insect-like robots, Loki advised to the Hood to take flight. Following Norman Osborn's chat with the President, Loki advises to recreate an incident similar to the Stamford Incident that will bring about the invasion upon Asgard.<ref>[[Brian Michael Bendis]] (w), [[Michael Lark]] (p), Stefano Gaudiano (i), ''Siege: The Cabal'' #1 (December 3, 2009), [[New York, NY]]: [[Marvel Comics]]</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Dave |last=Richards |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=23928 |title=STORMING HEAVEN: "Siege: The Cabal" |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] News |date=December 4, 2009 |accessdate=September 27, 2010 }}</ref>

He then reveals a plot to Osborn that will take advantage of [[Volstagg]]'s presence in Chicago, as Volstagg has gone for adventures like Thor, having the [[U-Foes]] attack him and destroy a packed [[Soldier Field]] during an American football game killing thousands while he and Osborn watch in astral form.

Balder later banishes Loki from Asgard.<ref>''Thor #609''</ref>

Some time after he magically disguised himself as Osborn's Green Goblin persona to cause him to lay siege to Asgard, Loki encounters the [[Disir]] (the Valkyries of Bor), revealing that he desired to gain their service as his slaves. The Disir unite and assault him as one, but Loki manages to defeat them using extraordinary swordsmanship skills, thus forcing them to submit to him and declare him the victor. Loki meets with Mephisto, agreeing to lend him the Disir for a hundred and one days in exchange for the demon lord granting a portion of his netherworld to his daughter Hela for one thousand and one years, as her new "Hel". In exchange for this, Hela erases Loki from the Books of Hel, thus he is no longer tied to Hel or Asgard, gaining absolute freedom.<ref>[[Kieron Gillen]] (w), [[Jamie McKelvie]] (p), ''Siege: Loki'' #1 (April 14, 2010), [[New York, NY]]: [[Marvel Comics]]</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Timothy |last=Callahan |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=user_review&id=2108 |title=Review: Siege: Loki #1 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=April 14, 2010 |accessdate=September 27, 2010 }}</ref>

When the combined forces of the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]], [[Young Avengers]] and the [[Secret Warriors]] defeat the [[Dark Avengers]], Thor demands to know where Loki is.

He begs his father Odin to return to him the Norn Stones, which are taken away from the Hood and given to the trickster. He uses its power to empower the three teams and give the powers of the Hood's gang to them, and fight back against the Void, causing it visible pain. However, it senses Loki's hand in this and attacks him, resistant to the Norn Stones direct attacks, and destroys the Norn Stones. As Loki is torn apart in front of a shocked Thor by the Void's tendrils, his last words were to apologize to his brother. Thor resolves to avenge his fallen brother and destroys the Void and the Sentry with a lightining strike when they transform back from the H.A.M.M.E.R Helicarrier crashing into them from Iron Man; he then takes the Sentry's remains into outer space, and releases them into the Sun.<ref>''Siege'' #4</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Dave |last=Richards |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=26287 |title=STORMING HEAVEN: "Siege" #4 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] News |date=May 18, 2010 |accessdate=September 26, 2010 }}</ref>

===Reincarnation===
[[File:LokiReincarnated.jpg|thumb|right|Loki reincarnated, in ''Thor'' 617.]]
Thor, missing his brother, resurrects him and Loki returns to life in the form of a young boy.<ref>''Thor'' #617 by Matt Fraction</ref> He brings back Odin as well.

==Powers and abilities==
Loki is a member of the race of Frost Giants of Jotunheim, although not a giant in stature. He possesses physical attributes equal to a fit average member of the race of superbeings known as Asgardians, such as superhuman strength; stamina (his Frost Giant metabolism grants him superhuman levels of physical stamina in practically all activities); durability; and immunity to all known diseases and toxins, as well as some resistance to magic.

Loki has extensive training in magic, and possesses the ability to manipulate magical forces for a variety of purposes: energy projection, creation of force fields, temporarily increasing his own physical strength, granting superhuman abilities to living beings or inanimate objects, flight, hypnotism, illusion casting, and inter-dimensional teleportation. 

Loki's magical abilities have been described as equal to those of [[Karnilla]], the most skilled sorceress of Asgard.<ref>''New Mutants Special Edition'', ''X-Men Annual'' #9</ref> His illusion casting can fool cities,<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #96</ref> and through extreme effort, he has been able to break free of technology in the possession of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]].<ref>''X-Factor'' v.1, #50</ref> 

Apparently, Loki possesses some extrasensory abilities and is capable of astral projection and casting his thoughts across great distances, even across dimensional barriers, like that between Asgard and Earth even if he is unable to move. He cannot read the minds of other beings, although he can influence their actions, and once briefly hypnotized Thor, as well as controlling a flock of birds. However he could not coerce Thor to give him Mjolnir.<ref name="Journey into Mystery #85"/> If someone has evil thoughts, Loki can influence their actions even if he is in Asgard and the subject is on Earth,<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #118</ref> and he can influence other events to a degree, such as driving a missile from its path.<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #94</ref>

Loki is an adept shapeshifter and can change into animals (examples include transmogrification to a salmon, horse, etc.) or impersonate other people, such as Thor or [[Captain America]]. However, he does not necessarily gain the abilities of whatever he turns into, although minor natural abilities such as flight in bird form tend to work. He has also turned clouds into dragons, and animated trees to attack Thor.<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #92</ref>

At times Loki imbues himself with magical abilities that enable him to withstand injuries that would prove fatal to another Asgardian, such as being beheaded by Balder. He has likewise successfully protected himself against the [[Controller (Marvel Comics)|Controller]]'s control disk,{{Issue|date=August 2009}} the mental influence of the Voice, and the power-sapping abilities of [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]].{{Issue|date=August 2009}}

Aside from his mystical abilities, Loki possesses a brilliant intellect. However, his passionate hatred of Thor, lust for power, and tendency to alienate others by his ignoble actions greatly impeded his ability to bring his well-laid plans to fruition. He is an expert manipulator and schemer, is sometimes armed with a sword or a whip, and has used magical items (such as the Norn Stones) to enhance his powers.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Universe===
Loki appears in the second volume of ''[[Ultimates|The Ultimates]]'' as the evil stepbrother of [[Ultimate Thor|Thor]].
The Ultimate version of Loki has the ability to "shuffle time and space", and in his first appearance, causes a ripple during Thor's conversation with [[Volstagg]]. In the restaurant, Loki is apparently in the background, which would mark his first "appearance" (he is mentioned and his powers apparently used, but he is only briefly seen). Loki comes to Earth after escaping from the Room Without Doors and begins to cause havoc, especially for Thor and the [[United States]] after assisting the [[Liberators (comics)|Liberators]]. Through his power he creates the persona for himself of "Gunnar Golmen," the head scientist of the Norwegian extension of the "European Defense Initiative," the European counterpart to The Ultimates, and turns Thor into "Thorlief," Gunnar's brother, a former mental patient who stole the technology that Gunnar created for the Initiative.

Later in the story, he confronts the captive Thor and gloats that it is all just another one of their games, and informs him that there is a traitor in the ranks of the Ultimates. When Thor requests assistance from the guards, Loki is nowhere to be seen, though he appears as a snake around Thor's neck after they leave (most likely a nod to the real Loki in Norse mythology). Most recently (at the end of ''Ultimates 2'' #9), Loki has stated that the reason he joined the Liberators was that "They had a Norse god on their side. It's only fair you should get one too", and that "Odin sent his son to bring the world peace. I couldn't resist the opportunity to mess that up." However, he is hesitant to use his abilities overtly as he claims Odin will then be able to find him. Yet once all The Liberators are defeated, he decides to do things himself. After revealing to the Ultimates who he is, he rises into the air and changes the color of the sky. At that moment, the sky opens and Thor, his brother, appears for revenge.

Issue 13 shows further demonstrations of his power by attempting to trap Thor in an illusion and withstanding a direct blow from Thor's hammer uninjured, claiming it cannot hurt him. During this battle, Thor mentions that Loki's powers have weakened for an unexplained reason. After Loki summons an army of monsters to battle the Ultimates and nearly kills Thor, the thunder god then proceeds to summon allies from Asgard while he strikes Loki with his hammer, sending him back to Asgard where Odin awaits him.

Loki's motivation for his actions is not completely revealed. He mentions several motivations from a desire to cause World War III to Odin favoring Thor over him and attempting to gain Odin's favor. Throughout the whole ordeal Loki regards humans as mere playthings for his pranks. In addition to creating a Norwegian super-soldier program that was supposedly part of an EU initiative and making people believe it was real, even though Norway is not part of the [[European Union]], he claimed to have been the one who framed [[Captain America]] for treason, regarding the failure of humans to realize the problems with these assertions as humorous.

According to Wizard Magazine, Loki will play a role in the relaunched Ultimate universe in 2010.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

===MC2===
In the reality of [[Marvel Comics 2|Earth-982]], Loki decides to bring an end to the "Age of Heroes", still regretting the fact that his actions led to the creation of the Avengers. In the series ''[[Last Hero Standing]]'', he kidnaps several major superheroes, brainwashes them so that they are more violent, and returns them to Earth so that they will destroy their reputations, knowing that his spell will be permanent the moment they shed innocent blood. Eventually this plot is foiled by the superheroes of Earth, especially [[Alternate versions of Captain America#MC2|Captain America]], who shatters the gem Loki was using to create the spell before any innocents can be killed. In battle, Loki badly injures Captain America, but, because of his actions, Loki is banished to the limbo realm and is joined by the [[Alternate versions of the Hulk#MC-2|Hulk]], who intends to punish him for affecting the Hulk with his spell and driving him to attack the other heroes.

Within the ''[[A-Next|Avengers Next]]'' miniseries, it is revealed that Loki's daughter (within the MC2 universe), Sylene, is on a mission to restore Asgard as a way to honor her father and to prove herself to the Asgardians. Unfortunately, her plan is not only to transform Midgard/Earth into a version of Asgard but also to eliminate the Avengers, since Loki was blaming himself for his part of indirectly creating the team.

===Marvel 2099===
In the [[Marvel 2099]] line of series, the original Asgardians were no more. However, belief in them had grown into a full-fledged religion with many followers. Seeking to take advantage of this, a corporation called '''Alchemax''' decided to create their own [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]]. One of the company's scientists, Jordan Boone, decided that he wanted to have powers and sneaked himself into the program. He ensured that he avoided the receiving of a computer chip implant which would give him falsified memories of his godhood. Jordan became the Loki of the program, but fled before the program and their floating fortress were destroyed. He later reappeared and remade himself as the villainous [[Halloween Jack]] who went about trying to warp the entire world with a '''Virtual Unreality Projector'''. His plan would have succeeded if not for [[Doom 2099|President Doom]] stepping in with the help of the [[X-Men 2099|X-Men]] [[Meanstreak (comics)|Meanstreak]] and [[Krystalin]]. Halloween Jack was supposedly killed in ''2099 World of Tomorrow'' #2, but made an unexpected [[cameo appearance|cameo]] in ''X-Force'' #92. He was somehow pulled from the time-stream before his death and redeposited in the present where he pestered [[Domino (comics)|Domino]]. Since then his resident time period and/or location have been unknown.

===Earth X===
In the reality of [[Earth X|Earth-9997]], Loki duped Odin into transforming Thor into a woman and he cast a spell across Bifrost that would prevent Thor from returning to Earth if he ever returned to Asgard. Among several heroes, in this reality, he opposed the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]] due to finding out the falsehood of the Asgardians' origins. Realizing that his form was actually solely dependent on his convictions (as that of all Asgardians), he became an angelic being with a very ambiguous appearance. With his new state, he was instrumental in defeating the Absorbing Man and he later formed the new Avengers and became the new Thor.

===Guardians of the Galaxy===
In the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] timeline (Earth-691), Loki is alive and well in the 31st Century.
