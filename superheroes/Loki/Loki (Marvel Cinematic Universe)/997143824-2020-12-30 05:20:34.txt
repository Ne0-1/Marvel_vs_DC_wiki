'''Loki Laufeyson''', also known as '''Loki Odinson''', is a [[character (arts)|character]] portrayed by [[Tom Hiddleston]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) [[film franchise]], based on the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Loki (comics)|character of the same name]]. In the films, Loki is known as the "God of Mischief" and is one of the most powerful of the [[Asgardians (comics)|Asgardians]], an alien civilization with long ties to Earth, who are therefore considered on Earth to be gods.

{{As of|2019}}, the character is an important recurring figure of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. He has appeared in six films of the series, ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'', ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'', ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'', ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'', ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'', and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', and will appear in ''[[Loki (TV series)|Loki]]'', a stand-alone [[Disney+]] television series focused on the character, and in ''[[What If...? (TV series)|What If...?]]'',<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hughes |first1=William |title=Marvel just released an extremely intriguing cast list for Disney+'s animated What Ifâ€¦? |url=https://news.avclub.com/marvel-just-released-an-extremely-intriguing-cast-list-1836569935 |website=A.V. Club |accessdate=21 July 2019}}</ref> an animated anthology TV series. Loki's character has borrowed a number of characteristics and storylines from across the more than fifty-year history of the character in Marvel Comics. As in the comics, Loki has generally been a villain in the MCU, variously attempting to conquer Asgard or Earth, and having allied himself with more powerful villains to achieve his aims. He has particular antagonism for his adoptive brother [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]], and is known to variously ally with and then betray Thor and others, and to regularly return from apparent death. Later on in his development in the films, he becomes less of a [[supervillain]] and more of an [[antihero]].

==Concept and creation==
The mythical figure, Loki, actually preceded Thor in making his first Marvel Comics appearance, depicted in the [[science fiction]]/[[fantasy]] [[anthology]] title [[Timely Comics]]' publication ''[[Venus (comic book)|Venus]]'' No. 6 (August 1949) as a member of the [[Olympians (Marvel Comics)|Olympian gods]] exiled to the [[Hades|Underworld]]. However, the current version of Loki made his first official Marvel appearance was in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' No. 85 (October 1962), where Loki was reintroduced as Thor's sworn enemy. The modern age Loki was introduced by brothers and co-writers [[Stan Lee]] and [[Larry Lieber]] and he was redesigned by [[Jack Kirby]]. As one of Thor's arch-nemeses, Loki frequently made appearances in Thor-related titles like ''Journey into Mystery'' and ''Thor'', as well as other [[Marvel Universe]] titles such as ''[[Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' and ''[[X-Men]]''.<ref>''X-Men and Alpha Flight'' No. 1 (December 1985)</ref> As well as brief appearances in the ''[[Spider-Man]]'' and ''[[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]'' comic series.

Live-action film adaptations of character in the ''Thor'' comic books were proposed at various times, but did not come to fruition. In the mid-2000s, [[Kevin Feige]] realized that Marvel still owned the rights to the core members of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], which included Thor. Feige, a self-professed "fanboy", envisioned creating a shared universe just as creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby had done with their comic books in the early 1960s.<ref name="BostonApril2012">{{cite web|date=April 25, 2012 |last=Russo |first=Tom |title=SUPER GROUP |url=https://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2012/04/29/the_avengers_collects_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbustersuper_groupthe_avengers_assembles_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbuster/ |publisher=[[Boston.com]] |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6LK5iBg53?url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2012/04/29/the_avengers_collects_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbustersuper_groupthe_avengers_assembles_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbuster/?page=1 |archive-date=November 22, 2013 |url-status=live  }}</ref> In 2006, the film was announced as a Marvel Studios production.<ref name="Carle">{{cite news|first=Chris |last=Carle |title=Comic-Con 2006: Marvel Announces Three |work=IGN |date=July 3, 2006 |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/720/720532p1.html |accessdate=August 10, 2008 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5zxByL7iA?url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/720/720532p1.html |archive-date=July 5, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> In December 2007, Protosevich described his plans for it "to be like a [[superhero]] [[origin story]], but not one about a human gaining super powers, but of a god realizing his true potential.

===Characterization===
Tom Hiddleston stated that "Loki's like a comic book version of [[Edmund (King Lear)|Edmund]] in ''[[King Lear]]'', but nastier".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/20-last-minute-casting-decisions-completely-changed-mcu/|title=20 Last-Minute Casting Decisions That Completely Changed The MCU|first=Ben|last=Sherlock|publisher=[[ScreenRant]]|date=January 29, 2019}}</ref> Hiddleston stated that he had to keep a strict diet before the start of filming because director Kenneth Branagh "wants Loki to have a lean and hungry look, like [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]] in ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''. Physically, he can't be posing as Thor".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://collider.com/actor-thom-hiddleston-and-writer-ashley-miller-talk-thor/|title=Actor Thom Hiddleston and Writer Ashley Miller Talk Thor|last=Goldberg|first=Matt|website=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]|date=May 30, 2009|accessdate=December 9, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131011053206/https://collider.com/actor-thom-hiddleston-and-writer-ashley-miller-talk-thor/|archive-date=October 11, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Hiddleston also looked at [[Peter O'Toole]] as inspiration for Loki, explaining, "Interestingly enough, [Kenneth Branagh] said to look at Peter O'Toole in two specific films, ''[[The Lion in Winter (1968 film)|The Lion in Winter]]'' and ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]''. What's interesting about ... his performance [as King Henry] is you see how damaged he is. There's a rawness [to his performance]; it's almost as if he's living with a layer of skin peeled away. He's grandiose and teary and, in a moment, by turns hilarious and then terrifying. What we wanted was that emotional volatility. It's a different acting style, it's not quite the same thing, but it's fascinating to go back and watch an actor as great as O'Toole head for those great high hills".<ref name="Storm">{{cite news |author=Storm, Marc |title=Tom Hiddleston: Thor's Mischief Maker |publisher=[[Marvel Comics|Marvel.com]] |date=February 7, 2011 |url=http://marvel.com/news/story/15145/tom_hiddleston_thors_mischief_maker |accessdate=February 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5zva68ecj?url=http://marvel.com/news/story/15145/tom_hiddleston_thors_mischief_maker |archive-date=July 4, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Ted Allpress portrays a young Loki.

About his character's evolution from ''Thor'' to ''The Avengers'', Hiddleston said, "I think the Loki we see in ''The Avengers'' is further advanced. You have to ask yourself the question: How pleasant an experience is it disappearing into a wormhole that has been created by some kind of super nuclear explosion of his own making? So I think by the time Loki shows up in ''The Avengers'', he's seen a few things."<ref name="HiddlestonInt1">{{cite news|url=http://www.iamrogue.com/news/movie-news/item/3534-exclusive-tom-hiddleston-discusses-lokis-role-in-the-avengers.html|title=Exclusive: Tom Hiddleston Discusses Loki's Role in 'The Avengers{{'-}}|last=Philbrick|first=Jami|date=May 1, 2011|publisher=IAmRogue.com|accessdate=May 1, 2011|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5zxBoOBUw?url=http://www.iamrogue.com/news/movie-news/item/3534-exclusive-tom-hiddleston-discusses-lokis-role-in-the-avengers.html|archive-date=July 5, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> About Loki's motivations, Hiddleston said, "At the beginning of ''The Avengers'', he comes to Earth to subjugate it and his idea is to rule the human race as their king. And like all the delusional autocrats of human history, he thinks this is a great idea because if everyone is busy worshipping him, there will be no wars so he will create some kind of world peace by ruling them as a tyrant. But he is also kind of deluded in the fact that he thinks unlimited power will give him self-respect, so I haven't let go of the fact that he is still motivated by this terrible jealousy and kind of spiritual desolation."<ref name="HollywoodReporter5">{{cite web|date=August 20, 2011|author=THR staff|title={{-'}}Avengers' Tom Hiddleston Talks the Return of Loki (Video)|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/avengers-tom-hiddleston-talks-return-225649|work=The Hollywood Reporter|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/618UtAbKg?url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/avengers-tom-hiddleston-talks-return-225649 |archive-date=August 22, 2011 |url-status=live |accessdate=August 22, 2011}}</ref> Hiddleston also filmed scenes for ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'', but his scenes were omitted from the theatrical cut because director Joss Whedon didn't want the movie to feel "overstuffed".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2148918/joss-whedon-loki-avengers-age-of-ultron/|title=Joss Whedon Explains Why There's No Loki In 'Avengers: Age Of Ultron'|work=MTV News|access-date=May 1, 2015|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6YD2O5qul?url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2148918/joss-whedon-loki-avengers-age-of-ultron/|archive-date=May 1, 2015|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

With respect to Loki's death at the beginning of ''Infinity War'', Hiddleston expressed the opinion that "it's very powerful he calls himself an Odinson, and that closes the whole journey of Loki and what he can do", also noting that Loki's death demonstrates how powerful Thanos is, setting the stage for the fight against him.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/marvel/2018/06/25/avengers-infinity-war-loki-fate-death-tom-hiddleston/|title=Tom Hiddleston Confirms Loki's Fate In 'Avengers: Infinity War', Was Told Two Years Ago|website=Marvel|date=June 25, 2018}}</ref>

===Appearance and special effects===
Hiddleston has noted that his transformation into Loki has required dying his naturally blond hair and making his naturally ruddy skin appear very pale, stating:

{{quote|In making him with this raven black hair and blanching my face of all color, it changes my features. Suddenly my blue eyes look a lot bluer, which lends a severity to my face.

Loki's costume in ''Thor'', designed by Marvel's head of visual development Charlie Wen, adapted elements from the comics while adding elements to give it a futuristic feel, reflecting the treatment of magic in the Thor films as merely highly advanced technology. Like other representations of Asgard, particularly including the costumes of Thor and Odin, it also referenced Norse symbols. Wen stated that he "designed Loki's armor to be more overtly ceremonial than practical", in keeping with the character being more focused on scheming for power than engaging in battle.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.themarysue.com/wacky-loki-design/|title=Loki's First Design in Thor Was Absolutely Wild|first=Kaila|last=Hale-Stern|publisher=[[The Mary Sue]]|date=August 10, 2018}}</ref>

Hiddleston described the horns worn as part of his Loki costume as weighing about 30 pounds, resulting in one instance during the filming of ''The Avengers'' where he asked co-star [[Chris Hemsworth]] to really punch him in the face, because the weight of the horns made it difficult to fake being hit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2480759/that-time-chris-hemworth-punched-tom-hiddleston-in-the-face-filming-the-avengers|title=That Time Chris Hemworth Punched Tom Hiddleston In The Face Filming The Avengers|date=September 23, 2019|website=CINEMABLEND}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
===Origins and first betrayal of Asgard===
{{see|Thor (film)}}
Loki was born a Frost Giant, and abandoned as an infant by his father [[Laufey (comics)|Laufey]], only to be found by [[Odin (character)|Odin]] during an invasion of the realm of the Frost Giants. Odin uses magic to make Loki appear Asgardian, and raises him as a son alongside Odin's biological son, Thor. During his upbringing, Odin's wife Frigga teaches Loki to use magic and illusion.

Hundreds of years later, Loki watches as Thor prepares to ascend to the throne of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]]. This is interrupted by frost giants attempting to retrieve an artifact captured by Odin in a war centuries before. Loki manipulates Thor into traveling to Jotunheim against Odin's order, to confront Frost Giant leader Laufey, accompanied by Loki and several of Thor's fellow warriors. A battle ensues until Odin intervenes to save the Asgardians, destroying the fragile truce between the two races. Loki discovers that he is Laufey's biological son, adopted by Odin after the war ended. After Odin exiles Thor to Earth, Loki confronts Odin about his parentage, and a weary Odin falls into the deep "Odinsleep" to recover his strength. Loki takes the throne in Odin's stead and offers Laufey the chance to kill Odin and retrieve the Casket. Sif and the Warriors Three, unhappy with Loki's rule, attempt to return Thor from exile, convincing [[Heimdall (comics)|Heimdall]], gatekeeper of the [[BifrÃ¶st]]â€”the means of traveling between worldsâ€”to allow them passage to Earth. Aware of their plan, Loki sends the [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]], a seemingly indestructible [[automaton]], to pursue them and kill Thor, but Thor regains his powers and defeats the Destroyer. Thor leaves with his fellow Asgardians to confront Loki.

In Asgard, Loki betrays and kills Laufey, revealing his true plan to use Laufey's attempt on Odin's life as an excuse to destroy Jotunheim with the BifrÃ¶st Bridge, thus proving himself worthy to his adoptive father. Thor arrives and fights Loki before destroying the [[BifrÃ¶st Bridge]] to stop Loki's plan, stranding himself in Asgard. Odin awakens and prevents the brothers from falling into the abyss created in the wake of the bridge's destruction, but Loki apparently commits suicide by allowing himself to fall when Odin rejects his pleas for approval.

In space, Loki encounters the Other, the leader of an extraterrestrial race known as the [[Chitauri]]. In exchange for retrieving the Tesseract,{{refn|name=Tesseract|group=N|Producer Kevin Feige stated that the Tesseract is based on the [[Cosmic Cube]] from Marvel comics.<ref name="movieline">{{cite web|url=http://movieline.com/2012/04/30/kevin-feige-on-avengers-marvel-universe-building-and-the-legacy-of-elektra/|title=Marvel's Kevin Feige on Avengers, Iron Man 3, Thor 2, Universe-Building, and Elektra|author=Yamato, Jen|publisher=[[MovieLine]]|date=April 30, 2012|accessdate=May 3, 2012|quote=But as we were working on them we started to keep track of some things that the writers and filmmakers of one movie were doing anyway and we started to track them and realized that we could utilize those later down the line.

Later, [[Erik Selvig]] is taken to a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility, where Nick Fury opens a briefcase and asks him to study a mysterious cube, which [[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]] says may hold untold power. Loki, invisible, prompts Selvig to agree, and he does.

===Attacking Earth===
{{see|The Avengers (2012 film)}}
Loki attacks a remote [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] research facility, using his scepter to enslave the mind of [[Clint Barton (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Clint Barton]] and steals the Tesseract. In [[Stuttgart]], Barton steals [[iridium]] needed to stabilize the Tesseract's power while Loki causes a distraction, leading to a brief confrontation with Steve Rogers, Tony Stark, and Natasha Romanoff that ends with Loki's surrender. While Loki is being escorted to S.H.I.E.L.D., [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] arrives and frees him, hoping to convince him to abandon his plan and return to Asgard. After a confrontation with Stark and Rogers, Thor agrees to take Loki to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s flying aircraft carrier, the [[Helicarrier]]. Upon arrival, Loki is imprisoned while Banner and Stark attempt to locate the Tesseract.

Agents possessed by Loki attack the Helicarrier, disabling one of its engines in flight and causing [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]] to transform into the Hulk. Thor attempts to stop the Hulk's rampage, and Loki kills Agent Coulson and ejects Thor from the airship as he escapes. Stark and Rogers realize that for Loki, simply defeating them will not be enough; he needs to overpower them publicly to validate himself as ruler of Earth. Loki uses the Tesseract, in conjunction with a device Selvig built, to open a wormhole above [[Stark Tower]] in [[New York City]] to the Chitauri fleet in space, launching his invasion. The Avengers arrive and rally in defense of the city. As the Chitauri are defeated, the Hulk attacks Loki and beats him into submission. Thor returns Loki and the Tesseract to Asgard, where Loki is confined to life imprisonment by Odin for his crimes on both Earth and Asgard.

===Battle with the Dark Elves===
{{see|Thor: The Dark World}}
[[Elves (Marvel Comics)#Dark Elves|Dark Elves]] led by [[Malekith the Accursed|Malekith]] attack Asgard, searching for Jane Foster, whose body has been invaded by an unearthly force known as the Aether. Malekith and his monstrous lieutenant [[Kurse]] kill Loki's adoptive mother [[Frigga (comics)|Frigga]], who had taught Loki magic. Thor reluctantly frees Loki, who agrees to take Thor to a secret portal to [[Svartalfheim]], home of the dark elves, in return for Thor's promise to take vengeance for their mother.

In Svartalfheim, Loki appears to betray Thor, in fact tricking Malekith into drawing the Aether out of Jane, but Thor's attempt to destroy the exposed substance fails. Malekith merges with the Aether and leaves in his ship as Loki appears to be fatally wounded saving Thor from Kurse, whom Loki was able to kill through trickery. Thor ultimately defeats Malekith in a battle in [[Greenwich]], and returns to Asgard to decline Odin's offer to take the throne, and tells Odin of Loki's sacrifice. After Thor leaves, it is shown that Loki has actually survived and taken Odin's place on the throne, disguised as Odin.

===Destruction of Asgard and battle with Thanos===
{{see|Thor: Ragnarok|Avengers: Infinity War|Avengers: Endgame}}
Loki continues to rule Asgard disguised as Odin for several years, having kept the real Odin under a spell in a nursing home in New York City. During this time, the disguised Loki sends [[Sif (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sif]] to Earth on a mission which leads her to encounter and work with agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

Thor returns to Asgard and discovers Loki's ruse. He takes Loki to New York, and with the help of [[Doctor Strange|Stephen Strange]], they find a dying Odin in Norway, who explains that his passing will allow his firstborn child, Hela, to escape from a prison she was sealed in long ago. She appears, destroying MjÃ¶lnir, and forces the escaping Thor and Loki from the BifrÃ¶st out into space.

Loki lands on the planet Sakaar, and quickly ingratiates himself to the ruler of that world, the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]]. Thor later crash-lands on the planet, and is captured by the slave trader [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]], a former member of the ancient order of [[Valkyrior|Valkyries]] defeated by Hela. After convincing Valkyrie and Loki to help, they steal a ship with which to escape through a wormhole to Asgard â€“ but not before Loki again attempts to betray his brother, causing Thor to leave Loki behind on Sakaar. In the midst of a battle with Hela's forces, Loki returns aboard a large vessel stolen from the Grandmaster, helping Asgard's citizens to escape the battle between Thor and Hela's forces, and proclaiming himself their savior. Loki helps defeat Hela by rushing to Odin's treasure room and placing the crown of Surtur in the eternal flame kept there, thus causing an enormous form of Surtur to appear and destroy Asgard, which is Hela's source of power. Thor, crowned king, decides to take his people to Earth despite Loki's concerns about how he will be received there, but they are intercepted by a large spacecraft carrying Thanos.

Thanos, wielding the Power Stone after an assault on Xandar, overpowers Thor and Hulk, and claims the Space Stone from the Tesseract, which Loki had stolen just before Asgard's destruction. In a last act of self-sacrifice, Loki pretends to swear allegiance to Thanos, only to attempt a futile attack, after which Thanos chokes Loki to death.

===Alternative timeline===
{{see|Loki (TV series)}}
Thanos eventually obtains all the Infinity Stones and snaps his fingers and destroys half the population of the universe. Five years later, the remaining Avengers figure out how to travel back in time to obtain the Infinity Stones before Thanos does to undo the snap, leading several of them to return to the Battle of New York. The plans of the time-travelling Avengers go awry, however, allowing the now-captured past version of Loki to get hold of the Space Stone and escape, forming a new timeline where Loki is again alive.
