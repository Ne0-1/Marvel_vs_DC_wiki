===Fictional Biography===
The first Starshine was a young woman named Landra who lived in the fictional planet Galador 200 years ago. When her world's government called for volunteers to become [[Spaceknights]] to battle the alien [[Dire Wraiths]], Landra was one of those who accepted the call. Her armor gave her the power to use the mystical “Living Light”.

Landra acted as the prosecutor on the trial for murder of her fellow Spaceknight, Terminator.

Afterwards, Landra, who had fallen in love with Rom, decided to follow him across space.

200 years later, a young woman named Brandy Clark lived in the fictional town of Clairton, in West Virginia. She had a romantic relationship with a local young man named Steve Jackson. Brandy was the first person to meet Rom when he landed on Earth, and helped him as he tracked down and banished the Dire Wraiths that had infiltrated the town. However, Brandy came to fall in love with Rom because of his nobility, which caused friction between them and Steve.

Eventually, Landra arrived on Earth as well, and became jealous of Rom’s relationship with Brandy. She was soon killed by a Dire Wraith disguised as Brandy. She was buried in Clairton.

Not long thereafter, Rom left Clairton to continue seeking out Wraiths elsewhere. Brandy felt strangely compelled to dig up Starshine’s body. A Wraith [[sorcerer]] called Doctor Dredd then magically transplanted the Starshine armor onto Brandy’s body as part of an evil plan. This was something she had secretly yearned for; and afterwards, she left Clairton and accompanied Rom as he traveled the Earth.

During their absence, all of Clairton’s citizens were killed by the female Dire Wraiths when they decided to take over from their males. Steve and Brandy’s family were also killed, which made her bitter and vengeful, even causing her to change the form of the Starshine armor into a more fierce-looking one. She continued to help Rom battle the Wraiths, until she was magically changed back into a human girl by [[Hybrid (Marvel Comics)|The Hybrid.]]

When all the Wraiths were finally defeated, Rom left for Galador, leaving Brandy on Earth. Her desire to be with him was noticed by the [[cosmic entities (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entity]], the [[Beyonder]], who was active on Earth at the time. He granted her wish and sent her to Galador, where she hoped to be reunited with Rom. However, she arrived before he did, and it turned out that a second generation of Spaceknights had turned against the normal humans of the planet and killed most of them off; Brandy joined the underground resistance, but ultimately all normal Galadorians were killed, and Brandy herself was only saved by the timely arrival of Rom. With help from the original Spaceknights, Rom defeated the evil ones. Reclaiming his “humanity” (human body parts) Rom stayed on Galador with Brandy, with the other Spaceknights (who had lost their human bodies permanently) watching over them from space.

Brandy was seen again at Rick Jones' wedding along with the now-human Rom; she appeared to be pregnant.

In a possible future, Brandy will have two sons with Rom, both of whom will become Spaceknights themselves.

===Powers and Abilities===
Both Starshines derived their powers from their [[bionic]] Spaceknight armor. In addition to giving them superhuman strength and the ability to fly in space across interstellar distances, the armor could channel the extra-dimensional energy known as the Living Light from its eyes, which they could use to reveal the true form of a disguised Dire Wraith, or as destructive energy beams.

After being separated from the Starshine armor, Brandy continued to display certain abilities. A "ghost" of Starshine saved Rom from Wraith darkness, and several times the outlines of her armor appeared around her, usually in times of stress. It was noted that when this occurred, she seemed stronger than human, although the plot point was eventually dropped.
