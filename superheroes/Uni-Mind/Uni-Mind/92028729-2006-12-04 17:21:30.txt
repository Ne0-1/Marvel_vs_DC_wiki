The '''Uni-Mind''' is a fictional composite being in the [[Marvel Universe]].  The Uni-Mind and the Eternals were the creation of [[Jack Kirby]].

==History==
Normally the Uni-Mind is a mental [[gestalt]] entity of at least seven [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]], but Uni-Minds have also been comprised of Eternals, Humans, [[Deviants (comics)|Deviants]] and Brethren.  The Uni-Mind possesses all the powers, knowledge and combined intellect of those who are part of it.

The Eternals often use it as a means to address problems or decisions that are deemed too difficult for them to solve as individuals. 

It is not known how long a Uni-Mind can be held together, but there is one which left earth following Zuras' death, and apparently still exists. It comprises most of the Eternals' population, though [[Ajak]], and possibly others, have left its joining. [[Zuras]] was the first Eternal to form a Uni-Mind, after they attained cosmic powers, and used it to determine if he or A'Lars should become [[Prime Eternal]]. Since then, the Prime Eternal alone has the power to summon the Ritual, and produce the Blue Flame through which the Eternals fly, their forms physically becoming the Uni-Mind. Varua of the [[Young Gods]] is also able to create a joining with her fellow Young Gods which is similar to the Uni-Mind
