'''Ezekiel Sims'''  is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], a short-lived supporting character in ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]''.

He was a rich businessman who, in his younger years, [[ritual]]istically gained powers similar to those of [[Spider-Man]]. He wanted to use his powers to be a hero, but initially used them to found a corporation,  believing that he couldn't do anything without a base of operations, and swiftly became too busy to use his powers on a daily basis.

Ezekiel, in his 50s, contacted Spider-Man and explained to him the nature of animal totems: people who gain supernatural abilities from a mystic link with certain animals. He suggested that the spider that bit Peter Parker was not mutated by the radiation, but actually trying to give Peter its powers before the radiation killed it. This meant that Spider-Man was now part of the supernatural food chain, and became a target for other totems and beings who feed on totem. He subsequently aided Spider-Man in fighting a being known as [[Morlun]], apparently at the cost of his life, but it was later revealed that he survived and departed for Africa, where he aided Spider-Man in dealing with another supernatural-based menace.
 
Later, Ezekiel attempted to direct the consequences of gaining his powers onto Spider-Man himself, taking Spider-Man to the temple where he had been given his powers and drawing blood to attract a massive spider. However, in his last moments, he realised that he had done nothing with his powers but help himself, while Peter had selflessly risked his life to save others again and again. With this in mind, he attacked the Spider that would have eaten Peter, giving his own life to save his friend, and thus gaining a chance for redemption that he would never have again. 

==Powers and Abilities==

Ezekiel has almost all of the powers of Spider-Man, including the ability to crawl on walls, incredible agility, and almost equal strength  (except for spider-sense). However, it appears that the only way he can sustain his powers is to be "sacrificed" to a large spider creature.
