'''Ezekiel Sims'''  is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]; a short-lived [[supporting character]] in ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]''.

Ezekiel was a rich businessman who, in his younger years, [[ritual]]istically gained powers similar to those of [[Spider-Man]]. He wanted to use his powers to be a hero, but initially used them to found a corporation, believing that he couldn't do anything without a base of operations, and swiftly became too busy to use his powers on a daily basis.

Ezekiel, in his 50s, contacted Spider-Man and explained to him the nature of animal totems: people who gain supernatural abilities from a mystic link with certain animals. He suggested that the spider that bit Peter Parker was not mutated by the radiation, but actually trying to give Peter its powers before the radiation killed it. This meant that Spider-Man was now part of the supernatural food chain, and became a target for other totems and beings who feed on totems. He subsequently aided Spider-Man in fighting a being known as [[Morlun]], apparently at the cost of his life, but it was later revealed that he survived and departed for Africa, where he aided Spider-Man in dealing with [[Shathra]], another supernatural-based menace.
 
It was revealed that a variety of supernatural menaces that Spider-Man had faced were really after Ezekiel, and Ezekiel attempted to direct the consequences of gaining his powers onto Spider-Man himself, taking Spider-Man to the temple where he had been given his powers and drawing blood to attract a massive spider. However, in his last moments, he realised that he had done nothing with his powers but help himself, while Peter had selflessly risked his life to save others again and again. With this in mind, he attacked the spider that would have eaten Peter, giving his own life to save his friend, and thus gaining a chance for redemption that he would never have again. 

==Powers and abilities==
Ezekiel possesses a number of superhuman attributes that are almost identical to those naturally possessed by Spider-Man. His strength, speed, stamina, agility, reaction time, and resistance to physical injury are all enhanced to superhuman levels. Although Ezekiel is of an advanced age, none of his physical attributes have declined over the decades.

Ezekiel also possesses the ability to stick to most surfaces and crawl along them in the same way as Spider-Man. He also possesses a type of [[Extrasensory perception|E.S.P.]] that serves as an early warning system in much the same way as Spider-Man's spider-sense, although his wasn't as developed as Spider-Man's. Because of their nearly identical powers, Ezekiel and Spider-Man are immune to each other's early warning system.

In addition to his powers, Ezekiel is extremely wealthy and is a highly skilled businessman and owner of a company with international connections.   As with Spider-Man, he is a formidable hand to hand combatant though he's had no formal training. He uses a type of unique freestyle of fighting that allows him to make full use of his powers. He also has some knowledge of the mystical nature of totems.
