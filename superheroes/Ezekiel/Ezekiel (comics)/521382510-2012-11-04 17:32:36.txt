'''Ezekiel Sims'''  was a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]; a former [[supporting character]] in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]''.

==Fictional character biography==
Ezekiel was a rich businessman who, in his younger years, [[ritual]]istically gained powers similar to those of [[Spider-Man]]. He wanted to use his powers to be a hero, but initially used them to found a corporation, believing that he could not do anything without a base of operations, and swiftly became too busy to use his powers on a daily basis. When Spider-Man emerged, Ezekiel hired half a dozen independent private detectives to investigate Spider-Man's life, allowing him to piece together who Spider-Man was from the various pieces of information they provided to him. [[Black Cat (comics)|Felicia Hardy]]  was one of his investigators, specifically hired to track Spider-Man's appearances in foreign countries.

Ezekiel, in his 50s, contacted Spider-Man<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #30</ref> and explained to him the nature of animal totems: people who gain supernatural abilities from a mystic link with certain animals. He suggested that the spider that bit Peter Parker was not mutated by the radiation, but actually trying to give Peter its powers before the radiation killed it. This meant that Spider-Man was now part of the supernatural food chain, and became a target for other totems and beings who feed on totems (Hence why so many of Spider-Man's foes were based on animals; on some level, they 'sensed' that Peter was a true totem while they were merely impostors and were thus driven to destroy him).<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #32</ref> He subsequently aided Spider-Man in fighting a being known as [[Morlun]], a vampire-like entity that 'fed' on totems, apparently at the cost of his life,<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #34</ref> but it was later revealed that he survived<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #35</ref> and departed for Africa, where he aided Spider-Man in dealing with [[Shathra]],<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #47</ref> another supernatural-based menace, by leading Peter to an area where he would have the advantage over Shathra.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #48</ref>

It was revealed that a variety of supernatural menaces that Spider-Man had faced were really after Ezekiel, and Ezekiel attempted to direct the consequences of gaining his powers onto Spider-Man himself, taking Spider-Man to the temple where he had been given his powers and drawing blood to attract a massive spider that would take the 'false' totem warrior as a sacrifice.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #507</ref> However, in his last moments, he realized that he had done nothing with his powers but help himself, while Peter had selflessly risked his life to save others again and again. With this in mind, he attacked the spider that would have eaten Peter, giving his own life to save his friend in recognition of the hero that Peter truly was, and thus gaining a chance for redemption that he would have never had again.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #508</ref>

Recently, in ''[[The Gauntlet and Grim Hunt#Grim Hunt|Grim Hunt]]'', it appeared as if a reanimated Ezekiel (covered in spiders) appeared before Spider-Man and [[Julia Carpenter|Arachne]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #634</ref> Unknown to Spider-Man, the Ezekiel that appeared before him was really the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] in disguise leading Peter into a trap with the Kravinoffs in order to carry out the resurrection of [[Kraven the Hunter|Sergei Kravinoff]], which required the blood of Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #635</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Ezekiel possesses a number of superhuman attributes that are almost identical to those naturally possessed by Spider-Man. His strength, speed, stamina, agility, reaction time, and resistance to physical injury are all enhanced to superhuman levels. Although Ezekiel is of an advanced age, none of his physical attributes have declined over the decades.

Ezekiel also possesses the ability to stick to most surfaces and crawl along them in the same way as Spider-Man. He also possesses a type of [[Extrasensory perception|E.S.P.]] that serves as an early warning system in much the same way as Spider-Man's spider-sense, although his wasn't as developed as Spider-Man's. Because of their nearly identical powers, Ezekiel and Spider-Man are immune to each other's early warning system.

In addition to his powers, Ezekiel is extremely wealthy and is a highly skilled businessman and owner of a company with international connections.   As with Spider-Man, he is a formidable hand to hand combatant though he's had no formal training. He uses a unique type of freestyle fighting that allows him to make full use of his powers. He doesn't seem to have any web-generating devices like Spider-Man's web-shooters, and is never seen to produce any webbing naturally.  In his conversations with Peter Parker, the subject never comes up. He is knowledgeable of the mystical nature of totems, and once told Peter the legend of the first "Spider-Man".
