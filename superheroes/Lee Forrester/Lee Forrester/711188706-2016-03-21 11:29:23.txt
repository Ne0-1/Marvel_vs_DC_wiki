Lee returns years later as the skipper for an expedition force which, after sailing through a dimensional warp within the [[Bermuda Triangle]], is stranded in an alternate Earth, the same one the adventurer [[Skull the Slayer|James Scully]] (who had been hired to join the expedition as a guide) once traveled to. After three years, the only three surviving members - Stanislaus, Forrester and Scully - send a message buoy through the dimensional rift which brought them to this world. It is found by the [[Future Foundation]], with whom the [[X-Men]] team up and travel to the alternate world to retrieve the stranded. However, it had only been days for the Earth-based heroes as time passes much differently in the dimension Lee and the others were in. <ref>''X-Men'' #16 (2011)</ref>

In the meantime, Lee came into contact and successfully negotiated with an unpredictable local tribe, the Taddak, for their alliance against the more hostile tribes under the leadership of the alien Emperor.<ref>''X-Men'' #17 (2011)</ref> In the struggle which follows, Lee and Skull secure two artifacts which maintain the delicate balance between the tribes of this Earth. In the time they spent here, the two fell in love with each other, so Lee refuses the X-Men and the Future Foundation's offer to return to her native Earth, instead staying with Skull and safeguarding the two artifacts.<ref>''X-Men'' #19 (2011)</ref>
