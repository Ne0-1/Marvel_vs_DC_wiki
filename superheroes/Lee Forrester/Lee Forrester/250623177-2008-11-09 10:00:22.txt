==Fictional character biography==
Forrester works as a ship captain of the fishing trawler, ''Arcadia'', and had a brief romantic relationship with [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] of the [[X-Men]], a.k.a. [[Scott Summers]], when he had taken a leave of absence after the death of [[Phoenix (comics)|Phoenix]]. Lee was targeted by the supernatural being [[D'Spayre]] after Lee's father, Jock, committed suicide over the loss of his wife, but he was defeated by Cyclops, who had accompanied her, and his principal enemy, the [[Man-Thing]].

Lee eventually learned that Scott was the mutant superhero Cyclops when Lee and Scott were shipwrecked on an island inhabited by [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] in the Bermuda Triangle. Later, after Scott broke off their relationship, she was involved with Magneto for a short time, after she rescues him from a shark attack. After this, she became interested in [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], but she did not pursue it, finding out that he was the son of her former boyfriend, Cyclops.
