'''Aleytys "Lee" Forrester''' is a comic book character created by [[Marvel comics]]. Her first appearance was in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #143. 

==Fictional character biography==
Forrester is a resident of [[Florida]] and the captain of the fishing trawler, ''Arcadia''. When [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] of the [[X-Men]], a.k.a. [[Scott Summers]], took a leave of absence following the death of [[Phoenix (comics)|Phoenix]], he hired himself aboard the ''Arcadia''. Lee was later targeted by the supernatural being [[D'Spayre]] after Lee's father, Jock, committed suicide over the loss of his wife.  D'Spayre was defeated by Cyclops and D'Spayre's principal enemy, the [[Man-Thing]].

Scott and Lee eventually engaged in a brief romantic relationship.  She eventually learned that Scott was the mutant superhero Cyclops when they were shipwrecked on an island inhabited by [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] in the Bermuda Triangle. Later, after Scott broke off their relationship (though they still remained close friends), she became involved with Magneto for a short time after she rescued him from a shark attack. After this, she became interested in [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], but she did not pursue it after she learned that he was the son of her former boyfriend, Cyclops, from the future.
