'''Agent Orange''' (real name '''Larfleeze''') is a [[fictional]] [[Character (arts)|character]] owned by [[DC Comics]]. He is the sole wielder of the Orange light of avarice. He debuted in ''DC Universe'' #0 (April 2008), and was created by [[Geoff Johns]] and [[Ethan Van Sciver]].

==Publication history==
Developed by Geoff Johns as a key participant in the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' plot line, he explains at [[Comic Con International]] 2009 that he came up with the name "Larfleeze" by combining the words "lard" and "sleaze." Johns also reveals that the [[Claim Jumper]] restaurant chain was his inspiration behind writing about [[greed]].<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/090725-sdcc09-blackest-night.html SDCC 09- DC's BLACKEST NIGHT Panel LIVE!], [[Newsarama]], 2:40, July 25 2009</ref> At one point commenting upon how Larfleeze is one of his favorite characters, Johns states that he enjoys writing about Larfleeze because of how "out of touch" the character is. He goes on to say that, other than greed, emotions have no value to the character (as they, literally, do not provide him with anything material).<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/070903-Geoff-BN.html The Eve of Blackest Night: Geoff Johns on...Everything], [[Newsarama]], July 3 2009</ref> After his brief first appearance in ''DC Universe'' #0 (April 2008), the character would go on to be shown in smaller teaser appearances within the ''Green Lantern'' series until his first extended appearance in ''Green Lantern'' #39 (April 2009). The issue leads into ''Agent Orange'' (named after the [[codename]] Larfleeze is given by the [[Guardians of the Universe]]), the storyline detailing the character's origin that also serves as a prelude to the ''Blackest Night'' event. Larfleeze's story is ongoing in ''Blackest Night'', including an appearance in ''Blackest Night: Tales of the Corps'' #2 (July 2009). In the story ''Tales of the Orange Lanterns: Blume, Godhead'', he is shown "recruiting" one of his most recognizable Orange Lanterns.<ref name="tales2">''Blackest Night: Tales of the Corps'' #2 (July 2009)</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
=== Origin ===
Larfleeze (also known as Agent Orange to those who wield power from the [[emotional spectrum]]) is the only individual to wield the power of the orange light. His origin is first described in a conversation between him and [[Hal Jordan]] in ''Green Lantern'' vol. 4, issue #41 (June 2009). As he explains to Jordan: billions of years ago, Larfleeze belonged to a small guild of thieves which stole a number of artifacts from the planet [[Maltus (comics)|Maltus]], including a mysterious box supposedly worth an entire star system to the right buyer. In retaliation, the Guardians of the Universe sent their [[Manhunters (comics)|Manhunter]] to pursue them. Those that escaped discovered a map belonging to the Guardian [[Krona (comics)|Krona]] that told of treasure. The guild followed the map into the Vega System to the planet Okaara. There they discovered a temple, inside of which was a Power Battery containing the orange light of avarice. Feeling its power "speak" to them, the criminals fought amongst themselves for it. Eventually the Guardians and their Manhunters found them and conflict ensued. Fearing the power of the orange light, the Guardians offered the two surviving guild members (Larfleeze and Blooch) a deal: in exchange for the mysterious box, the Guardians would trade the orange light with two additional conditions. Firstly, as long as the orange light remained within the Vega system, the Guardians would agree not to interfere with it. Then secondly, for the safety of others, only one of the two thieves would be allowed to keep the orange light for themselves. Larfleeze explained that the Guardians were desperate to get the box back because it contained the fear entity [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]]. Agreeing to these terms, the remaining guild members fought to the death for the right to own the orange light, and Larfleeze emerged victorious.<ref name="gl41">''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #41 (June 2009)</ref>

In ''Green Lantern'' vol. 4, issue #28 (April 2008), the [[Controllers (DC Comics)|Controllers]] are shown discussing their previous failures in forming a force matching the [[Green Lantern Corps]]. It is then that they become interested in pursuing a comparable power source to the green light that they've discovered: the orange light.<ref name="gl28">''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #28 (April 2008)</ref> The Controllers follow the orange light to a planet called Okaara. There, they descend into an underground palace and eventually come across the orange lantern power battery deep inside. As soon as they try to take it, the Controllers are overcome by Larfleeze's Orange Lanterns and are slaughtered.<ref name="gl39">''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #39 (April 2009)</ref>

=== Agent Orange ===

Larfleeze is enraged at this perceived violation of the agreement he had with the Guardians, as he is unable to see a distinction between them and the Controllers. At the time, Green Lantern [[Stel]] pursues a member of the [[Sinestro Corps]], but gave pause when he crossed into the Vega system for sanctuary. Not willing to be stopped (despite the fact that Green Lanterns were barred to enter the system), Stel continues after his target. Upon entering the system, the Sinestro Corps member is devoured by Agent Orange's construct: Blume. Blume captures and seriously damages Stel, branding him with the symbol of the Orange Lantern Corps. When the Green Lanterns recover Stel and return him to [[Oa]], a construct of Larfleeze bursts forth from the brand and confronts the Guardians about the attempt to steal the orange battery. Although the Guardians point out that it was the Controllers who had entered Vega, Larfleeze refuses to listen. He declares the treaty is null and void, and that the Guardians will submit to his demands or face his wrath. In response, the Guardian [[Scar (comics)|Scar]] destroys the projection and states that the Guardians do not negotiate with terrorists.<ref name="gl39" />

This conflict marks the beginning of ''Green Lantern'''s next phase in its prelude to the [[Blackest Night|''Blackest Night'']] [[Fictional crossover|crossover]], aptly titled: ''Agent Orange''. The story goes on to show the Guardians adding a fourth law to the Book of Oa: the Vega system is no longer outside of Green Lantern jurisdiction. This allows the Guardians and Green Lantern Corps to begin an assault on Vega. Hal Jordan, who recently received one of the blue power rings created by [[Ganthet]] and [[Sayd]], is included in the assault team. Upon arriving on Okaara, the Green Lanterns are met with opposition from Larfleeze's Orange Lantern constructs. They are alarmed to find that their green light powers have little effect on the Orange Lanterns and are absorbed into them. During the fight, Jordan is separated from the group and comes face to face with Agent Orange. Larfleeze, upon seeing Jordan's blue ring, immediately wants it for himself.<ref name="gl40">''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #40 (May 2009)</ref> Larfleeze touches the ring in his desire for it, and is forced back by the power of the blue light (the ring itself claiming that "hope is selfless"). This enrages Larfleeze, who bargains with Jordan over it. Though Jordan agrees to give the ring to Larfleeze, he finds he is unable to remove it. Not finding this to be an acceptable answer, Larfleeze creates an axe from orange light and removes Jordan's hand by force. No longer attached to Jordan, the blue power ring welcomes Larfleeze to the [[Blue Lantern Corps]].<ref name="gl41">''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #41 (May 2009)</ref> For a moment the constant hunger he feels as Agent Orange is pacified, but the relief is temporary as the reader is shown at the beginning of the following issue that Jordan's blue ring created an illusion to deceive him. Sensing Larfleeze's hope for relief, it made him believe he gained the blue ring he desired when in actuality he had never cut off Jordan's hand at all. Jordan returns to battle Larfleeze with the Green Lantern Corps. During the battle, Jordan is possessed by the overwhelming orange power of avarice after briefly seizing Larfleeze's power battery (assuming that by stealing it, Larfleeze would no longer be able to power his army of constructs). Unfortunately, it's explained that Larfleeze has been in contact with the orange battery for so long that it's as much a part of him as the main power battery in Oa is a part of the Guardians.<ref name="gl42">''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #42 (June 2009)</ref> 

Jordan is able to subdue Larfleeze by finally gaining control over his blue power ring. The Guardians realize that if they take the battery from Larfleeze, someone else would inevitably find it, becoming a new Agent Orange. Preferring to know where Agent Orange was, they decide to negotiate with Larfleeze once more. The details of the negotiation aren't fully revealed to the reader, however it is shown that Larfleeze asked the Guardians where he could find a blue power ring. The issue ends with Larfleeze launching an assault on the Blue Lantern Corps, sending a group of his Orange Lantern constructs to Odym.<ref name="gl42" /> Though Larfleeze remains on Okaara (observing the progress of the conflict through his central power battery), he sends a construct of himself to accompany his Orange Lanterns.<ref name="bn1">''Blackest Night'' #1 (July 2009)</ref><ref name="tales1">''Blackest Night: Tales of the Corps'' #1 (July 2009)</ref>

===Blackest Night===
{{Main|Blackest Night}}
At the onset of the ''Blackest Night'' [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] event, a new Corps powered by death (rather than a light of the emotional spectrum) is introduced to the [[DC Universe]]: the [[Black Lantern Corps]]. As the other seven Corps battle one another, [[Black Hand (comics)|Black Hand]] releases [[Power ring (DC Comics)#Black|black power rings]] that reanimated the deceased in order to recruit members to their ranks. In ''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #45, Larfleeze is shown delighting over his Orange Lanterns attempting to steal the Blue Central Power Battery from Odym. His celebration is premature, however, as black power rings invade his chamber and reanimated the bodies of those whose identities he's stolen in order to create his constructs. Larfleeze responds to this with a simple and timid "Yuh-oh!"<ref name="gl45">''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #45 (October 2009)</ref>

He is next seen running from the various Black Lanterns who are trying to kill him. His attempt to flee distracts him to such a degree that his energy constructs on Odym dissipate. Larfleeze is saved by the timely intervention of [[Atrocitus]], who demands that Larfleeze hand over his power battery.<ref name="gl47">''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #47 (October)</ref> Larfleeze is saved by the intervention of Saint Walker, Hal Jordan, [[Carol Ferris]], [[Indigo Tribe|Indigo-1]], and [[Sinestro]], who convince both of them to join to face the Black Lanterns.<ref name="gl48">''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #48 (November 2009)</ref> The greedy Larfleeze demands his own Guardian and Sayd promises that when the battle is done, she will become one for him.  Despite securing his coveted Guardian, Larfleeze continues to make more demands of the group in exchange for his cooperation, including a planet sized buffet, all for him, to placate his intense hunger. Atrocitus suggests killing him, an idea Sinestro agrees with, saying they can simply follow the orange ring to whomever it finds next. Indigo-1, however, steps in to defend Larfleeze, saying that he is not inherently evil and that his hunger is merely a side effect of the orange light. Saint Walker approaches Larfleeze, telling him that his attack on Odym is forgiven and that as long as Saint Walker is near, the blue ring will keep Larfleeze's hunger at bay. Larfleeze finally relinquishes and accompanies the group to Ryut and Earth in a failed attempt to destroy the black power battery. During the assault, he attempted to consume the Black Lantern Guardian [[Scar (comics)|Scar]] as his own, but she managed to gain the upper hand, which forced the other members of the group to destroy her.<ref name="bn5">''Blackest Night'' #5 (November 2009)</ref>

==Orange Lantern constructs==
Larfleeze is the only being in the universe to wear an Orange Lantern ring, hoarding all the others for himself. However, a unique property of the orange light is the ability to steal the identities of those he kills and create orange light replicas of them. This allows him to produce an entire army of Orange Lanterns to face his foes for him.<ref name="gl40" /> Notable Orange Lantern constructs include:<!--******PLEASE LIST ORANGE LANTERNS ALPHABETICALLY******-->

* '''Blume''' (of Sector 2751): A giant extraterrestrial head that proclaims himself a god of hunger so that he can intimidate the inhabitants of planets into feeding him their valuables. After failing to do the same to Larfleeze, he is made into an Orange Lantern construct and now patrols the Vega system.<ref name="tales2" /> He consumes the [[Sinestro Corps]] member of sector 2825 and brands Green Lantern [[Stel]] with the symbol of the Orange Lantern Corps.<ref name="gl39" /> During the ''Blackest Night'' event, his body is shown being reanimated as a Black Lantern.<ref name="gl45" />
* '''Clypta''' (of Sector 2829): An Orange Lantern from the Thieves' System that is reanimated as a member of the Black Lantern Corps during the ''Blackest Night'' event.<ref name="gl45" /> 
* '''The [[Controllers (DC Comics)|Controllers]]''': Arrive on Okaara searching for the orange light in order to create their own Corps.<ref name="gl28" /> Upon finding the orange power battery, they are confronted by Larfleeze and killed by his Orange Lanterns.<ref name="gl39" /> Later they are also shown to have been assimilated into his army of constructs.<ref name="gl40" />
* '''Glomulus''' (of Sector 2826): A former tavern cleaner on Okaara. While there, he is only allowed out of his cage to eat whatever food falls on the floor. After accidentally getting a taste for blood, Glomulus eats everyone in the tavern. Free, he makes his way into the woods and finds himself at Larfleeze's palace where he is consumed by Blume. His identity is stolen, turning him into an Orange Lantern.<ref name="gl40" /> During the ''Blackest Night'' event, his body is shown being reanimated as a Black Lantern.<ref name="gl45" />
* '''Gretti''' (former Green Lantern of Sector 2828): Literally torn limb from limb by Larfleeze's constructs during the Green Lantern attack on Okaara. After his defeat, his identity is stolen, turning him into an Orange Lantern.<ref name="gl40" /> During the ''Blackest Night'' event, his body is shown being reanimated as a Black Lantern.<ref name="gl45" />
* '''[[Guardians of the Universe|Guardian of the Universe]]''': While Larfleeze's thieves guild and the Guardians fought for the orange power battery, the power of the orange light is unleashed, killing one of the Guardians in the process. She is shown as being turned into an Orange Lantern construct.<ref name="gl41" /> In ''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #45, a male Guardian is shown being reanimated as a Black Lantern on Okaara. As Guardians are largely unnamed, it's unclear if this is an inconsistency in the artwork or a different character.<ref name="gl45" />
* '''Larfleeze''': After reclaiming his power battery from Hal Jordan, Larfleeze withdraws the Orange Lantern Corps into his battery and uses the combined power to create a gigantic avatar of himself in order to attack the [[Green Lantern Corps]].<ref name="gl42" /> Larfleeze later sends a life-sized avatar of himself to lead the attack against the Blue Lanterns on Odym.<ref name="tales1" />
* '''Nat-Nat''': An Orange Lantern from Limey Rock that is reanimated as a member of the Black Lantern Corps during the ''Blackest Night'' event.<ref name="gl45" /> 
* '''Sound Dancer''' (of Sector 911): An Orange Lantern from the Obsidian Deeps that is reanimated as a member of the Black Lantern Corps during the ''Blackest Night'' event.<ref name="gl45" /> The Obsidian Deeps make up the lightless sector that Green Lantern (or more accurately, F Sharp Bell) [[List of Green Lanterns#Rot Lop Fan|Rot Lop Fan]] is from.<ref name="tgrc13">''Tales of the Green Lantern Corps Annual'' #3 (1987)</ref>
* '''Tammal-Tayn''' (of Sector 2813): An Orange Lantern from the planet Fylip that is reanimated as a member of the Black Lantern Corps during the ''Blackest Night'' event.<ref name="gl45" /> 
* '''Turpa''': A member of the guild of thieves Larfleeze formerly belonged to. Together the guild steals the Guardians' map to the orange power battery, and upon finding it are so overcome with greed that they fight one another for it. Turpa is killed by the power of the orange light before Larfleeze and Blooch fight to the death for the orange power battery. He is shown as having been turned into an orange light construct.<ref name="gl41" />
* '''Warp Wrap''' (of Sector 2): An Orange Lantern from the planet Cairo that is reanimated as a member of the Black Lantern Corps during the ''Blackest Night'' event.<ref name="gl45" />

==Oath==
Johns confirmed, at San Diego Comic Con 2009, that the oath required to recharge Larfleeze's ring has not been heard despite rumors of it being the word "mine" (a demand regularly made by both Agent Orange and his Orange Lanterns).<ref name="sdcc1152">Johns, Geoff. [http://dccomics.com/media/podcasts/DCComics_2009-07-23_Spotlight_on_Geoff_Johns_at_SDCC_2009.mp3 DC Comics: Spotlight on Geoff Johns (11:52)]. San Diego Comic Con 2009. San Diego Convention Center, San Diego CA. 23 July 2009. Accessed 2 August 2009.</ref> Regardless, in an interview with [[Newsarama]], he also stated that the Orange Lantern oath was his favorite.<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/common/media/video/player.php?aid=25834 Geoff Johns: Blackest Night, Orange Oaths and Other Colors], [[Newsarama]], February 2009</ref> When the other Lantern leaders recite their oaths together in ''Blackest Night'' #5, Larfleeze seems surprised to hear them.

==Powers and abilities==
{{main|Power ring (weapon)|l1=Power ring}}
Agent Orange exclusively wields the power of the orange light (fueled by avarice) using his orange power ring and power battery. Some of his basic abilities are shared with other Corps: flight, aura projection, and the ability to create constructs made from orange light (for instance, an axe used to sever Hal Jordan's hand). Interestingly, a side effect of wielding the orange light is that Larfleeze suffers from an insatiable hunger that is never quelled regardless of how much food he eats.<ref name="gl41"/> The most notable and unique aspect of Larfleeze's abilities, however, is his power to steal the identities of those he kills. After these individuals have died, an orange light construct resembling them rises from their body, adding a new member to his Orange Lanterns. The Orange Lanterns are able to steal the identities of others, for Larfleeze, in the same way. The Orange Lantern avatars absorb constructs created by green power rings as well as mystical energies (such as the magicks created by Green Lantern [[List of Green Lanterns#Torquemada|Torquemada]]).<ref name="gl40" /> However, they are depicted as being unable to absorb constructs produced by [[Fatality (comics)|Fatality]]'s violet power ring, and Larfleeze himself was unable to absorb the power of Hal Jordan's blue power ring.<ref name="gl41" /> 

Larfleeze's power is amplified by being in constant contact with his power battery. Due to having been attached to his battery for so long, it is as much a part of him as the Oan main power battery is a part of the Guardians. As a result of this, he can maintain an entire Corps of constructs, even when separated from the battery. By reabsorbing all of his constructs back into his power battery, he is able to charge his power ring to 7,200 percent power. Larfleeze is shown doing this in order to create a giant construct of himself that begins demolishing the Green Lanterns.<ref name="gl42" /> Later, when he teams with the leaders of the other Lantern Corps, Larfleeze charges his ring to 100,000 percent power.
