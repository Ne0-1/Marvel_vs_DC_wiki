'''Nightwing''' is a name used by at least six [[fictional character|fictional]] characters in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|Universe]]. Although originating with the [[Superman]] mythos, [[Dick Grayson]] (the first [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]) is the character most associated with the name "Nightwing". The alias is also frequently paired with "[[Flamebird]]", another title taken by several DC Comics characters.

The name is originally used by the pre-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] Superman, when he and [[Jimmy Olsen]] act as vigilantes during trips to the bottle city of [[Kandor]]. Later, Superman's cousin [[Van-Zee]] uses the name. Post-Crisis, Superman attributes the name to a historic [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonian]] crimefighter. The Superman-related heroes serve as an inspiration for Dick Grayson when he sheds his Robin identity and assumes the name and a new costume in ''[[Teen Titans (comics)#A second series: New Teen Titans (vol. 2)|Tales of the Teen Titans]]'' #44 (1984).

In the ''Nightwing'' [[comic book]] series, Grayson trains a killer who goes by the name of [[Nite-Wing]], but later must capture him when he realizes Nite-Wing's violent nature. "[[One Year Later]]" storylines in ''Nightwing'' and ''Supergirl'' feature characters [[Jason Todd]], Cheyenne Freemont, and [[Power Girl]] using the name "Nightwing".

==Character history==
===Superman===
As first depicted in the story "Superman in Kandor" in ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' (Vol. 1) #158 (January 1963), Nightwing is an alias used by [[Superman]] in [[Edmond Hamilton]]-penned pre-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] adventures in the city of [[Kandor]], a [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonian]] city that was shrunken and preserved in a bottle. 

In Kandor, Superman has no [[superpowers]] and, in the story, is branded an outlaw there due to a misunderstanding. To disguise themselves, Superman and [[Jimmy Olsen]] create vigilante identities inspired by [[Batman]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]. Because neither bats nor robins lived on Krypton, Superman chooses the names of two birds owned by Superman's Kandorian friend [[Nor-Kan]]: "Nightwing" for himself and "Flamebird" for Olsen. The Dynamic Duo of Kandor create costumes evocative of the birds' plumage. Nightwing and Flamebird rename Nor-Kan's underground laboratory as the "Nightcave", and use it as their secret headquarters. They also convert Nor-Kan's automobile into their "Nightmobile", and use "jet-belts" to fly into battle.

Art by [[Curt Swan]].]]In ''Jimmy Olsen'' #69 (June 1963), "The Dynamic Duo of Kandor" introduces Nightwing's dog Nighthound. In "The Feud Between Batman and Superman" in ''[[World's Finest]]'' #143(August 1964), Batman and Robin themselves visit Kandor with Superman and Olsen and the two Dynamic Duos team up.

In ''[[Superman Family]]'' #183 (May-June 1977), Superman's [[look-alike]] second cousin [[Van-Zee]] and his niece's husband [[Ak-Var]] take up the Nightwing and Flamebird identities. The vigilantes take on crime in their city as had Superman and Olsen before them. 

In 2001's ''[[Superman: The Man of Steel]]'' #111, Superman and [[Lois Lane]] travel to Krypton. Labeled as criminals, Superman and Lois become fugitives, adopting the Nightwing and Flamebird identities to survive, just as had Superman and Olsen in ''Superman'' #158.

===Dick Grayson===
{{main|Dick Grayson}}
The teamup between both Nightwing and Flamebird teams along with their inspirations, Batman and Robin, for an adventure in Kandor proves important to the young [[Dick Grayson]]. When Dick later gives up his role as Robin in 1984, he recalls the Kandorian adventure and renames himself Nightwing, in homage to both Batman and Superman. After the events of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' re-boot the [[Timeline of the DC Universe|DC continuity]], Superman no longer has knowledge of Kandor; instead, he remembers Nightwing as an urban legend of Krypton, which he shares with a young Dick Grayson. Grayson, who considers Superman his favorite superhero, takes the identity in his honor.

In [[Blüdhaven]], a sociopath named Tad Ryerstad becomes a superhero, inspired by the retired hero [[Tarantula (DC Comics)|Tarantula]]. He takes his name, [[Nite-Wing]], from an all-night deli specializing in chicken wings. Unstable, Nite-Wing beats people for minor offenses. Nite-Wing is shot on his first night out and Dick Grayson, as Blüdhaven's protector Nightwing, defends him from [[Blockbuster (comics)#Roland Desmond|Blockbuster]]'s gang, who think it is Nightwing who has been injured. After Nite-Wing is released from the hospital, he kills the gang who put him there. Not realizing how violent Ryerstad is, Grayson agrees to train him. The two attack Blockbuster's organization but are captured and separated. After an undercover FBI agent frees Nite-Wing, Ryerstad beats him to death, and when he realizes what he has done, Ryerstad flees. Nightwing tracks him down and incarcerates Nite-Wing.

In the 2006 ''[[One Year Later]]'' storylines, multiple characters join Dick Grayson in using the name "Nightwing". [[Bruce Jones (comics)|Bruce Jones]]' ''Nightwing'' run features [[Jason Todd]] prowling the streets of New York City under the guise of Nightwing, copying Grayson's costume. Additionally, a [[metahuman]] fashion designer named [[Cheyenne Freemont]] dons a modified Nightwing costume to help Grayson. In [[Greg Rucka]]'s ''Supergirl'' (Vol. 3) #6, [[Power Girl]] and [[Supergirl]] assume the identities of Nightwing and Flamebird in a story set in Kandor, just as in the original stories featuring Superman.

Dick Grayson appears as Nightwing in ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', voiced by actor [[Loren Lester]], the actor who had voiced Grayson as [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''. The episode "Old Wounds" explains that Grayson, as Robin, fought with Batman over the latter's controlling nature and what the former saw as an unnecessarily harsh approach, causing Grayson to leave Gotham as a result. However, he returns years later as Nightwing. Although he works with Batman several times during the course of the series, he never fully reconciles with his former mentor. 

In the television series ''[[Batman Beyond]]'', which is set many years in the future, the Nightwing uniform (or at least one copy of it) still hangs in the Batcave.  [[Terry McGinnis]] (the new Batman) borrows the mask from that costume in the episode "Lost Soul," when the Batsuit is reprogrammed with the personality of a dead businessman.  In ''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]'', McGinnis asks Commissioner Barbara Gordon (the former [[Batgirl]]) if all of the original Batman's associates were bitter when they left. She replies "...look up Nightwing someday.  Has ''he'' got stories," implying that he is still alive and using the identity in the timeframe of the series.  

In the film ''[[Batman Forever]]'' Dick Grayson ([[Chris O'Donnell]]) suggests "Nightwing" as a name for himself. In the next film ''[[Batman & Robin]]'', the costume Robin wears is just like the costume in the comic books with Nightwing, except the main symbol across his chest and arms is red instead of blue in the comics.

Nightwing also has a cameo as a silhouette in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "Grudge Match". As [[Black Canary]] enters [[Blüdhaven]], Nightwing can be seen on a rooftop next to two gargoyles.

In the ''[[Teen Titans (animated series)|Teen Titans]]'' [[animated series]] episode [[List of Teen Titans episodes#How Long is Forever?|"How Long is Forever?"]], Nightwing appears as the future identity of [[Robin in other media|Robin]]. He also appears in the ''[[Teen Titans Go!]]'' comic series based on the series. [http://teentitans.toonzone.net/index.php?content=ttgo/guide/31]

''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' [[animated series]] episode [[Artifacts (The Batman)|"Artifacts"]], set in the year 3027 with flashbacks to the year 2027. The flashback sequences feature Nightwing, voiced by [[Jerry O'Connell]]. Although Dick has been active for ten years as Nightwing, Batman and [[Oracle (comics)|Oracle]] persist in calling him "Robin." Nightwing later appears in season 5 in the episode "The Metal Face of Comedy" in his original Nightwing costume. In this episode, he is Dick Grayson's video game character in an online role playing game.

The Teen Titans story arc ''The Judas Contract'' in which Robin becomes Nightwing, is currently being adapted as a [[direct-to-video]] [[Teen Titans: The Judas Contract|movie]]. It will be released in 2008.

In several [[Six Flags]] amusement parks, there is a ride called Nightwing located in the DC Superheroes area.

==Powers and Abilities==
Nightwing (like his mentor Batman) has many different gadgets that he uses to defeat his enemies. Most of the gadgets are in the form of small boomerangs; some of them explode, some spread [[liquid nitrogen]] to freeze objects, and some are just sharp, which he uses to disarm but not kill. Along with his boomerangs he has a grappling gun, and a retractable quarter staff which measures at six feet long at maximum length and one foot long at minimum length. Nightwing has trained in many different martial arts including Aikido, Jeet Kune Do, Escrima, Karate, Jiu-jitsu, Taekwondo, Tai Chi, Kendo, Hapkido, Wing Chun, Ninjitsu, Kempo, and Judo. Nightwing is also an experienced gymnast and spent several years of his youth in the circus. Along with skills with gadgetry and martial arts, Nightwing is exceedingly intelligent. He uses his detective skills and tactics to out think physically superior opponents.
