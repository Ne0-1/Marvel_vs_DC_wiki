'''Nightwing''' is a name used by at least six [[fictional character|fictional]] characters in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|Universe]]. Although originating with the [[Superman]] mythos, [[Dick Grayson]] (the first [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]) is the character most associated with the name "Nightwing". The alias is also frequently paired with "[[Flamebird]]", another title taken by several DC Comics characters.

The name is originally used by the pre-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] Superman, when he and [[Jimmy Olsen]] act as vigilantes during trips to the bottle city of [[Kandor]]. Later, Superman's cousin [[Van-Zee]] uses the name. Post-Crisis, Superman attributes the name to a historic [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonian]] crimefighter. The Superman-related heroes serve as an inspiration for Dick Grayson when he sheds his Robin identity.

In the ''Nightwing'' [[comic book]] series, Grayson trains a killer who goes by the name of [[Nite-Wing]], but later must capture him when he realizes Nite-Wing's violent nature. "[[One Year Later]]" storylines in ''Nightwing'' and ''Supergirl'' feature characters [[Jason Todd]], Cheyenne Freemont, and [[Power Girl]] using the name "Nightwing".

==Character history==

As first depicted in the story "Superman in Kandor" in ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' (Vol. 1) #158 (January 1963), Nightwing is an alias used by [[Superman]] in [[Edmond Hamilton]]-penned pre-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] adventures in the city of [[Kandor]], a [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonian]] city that was shrunken and preserved in a bottle. 

In Kandor, Superman has no [[superpowers]] and, in the story, is branded an outlaw there due to a misunderstanding. To disguise themselves, Superman and [[Jimmy Olsen]] create vigilante identities inspired by [[Batman]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]. Because neither bats nor robins lived on Krypton, Superman chooses the names of two birds owned by Superman's Kandorian friend [[Nor-Kan]]: "Nightwing" for himself and "Flamebird" for Olsen. The Dynamic Duo of Kandor create costumes evocative of the birds' plumage. Nightwing and Flamebird rename Nor-Kan's underground laboratory as the "Nightcave", and use it as their secret headquarters. They also convert Nor-Kan's automobile into their "Nightmobile", and use "jet-belts" to fly into battle. 

In ''Jimmy Olsen'' #69 (June 1963), "The Dynamic Duo of Kandor" introduces Nightwing's dog Nighthound. In "The Feud Between Batman and Superman" in ''[[World's Finest]]'' #143(August 1964), Batman and Robin themselves visit Kandor with Superman and Olsen and the two Dynamic Duos team up.

In ''[[Superman Family]]'' #183 (May-June 1977), Superman's [[look-alike]] second cousin [[Van-Zee]] and his nephew [[Ak-Var]] take up the Nightwing and Flamebird identities. The vigilantes take on crime in their city as had Superman and Olsen before them. In one story,{{issue}} the two Nightwing and Flamebird teams join forces and end all major crimes in Kandor.

Both Nightwing and Flamebird teams meet with their inspirations, Batman and Robin, for an adventure in Kandor{{issue}} that proves important to the young [[Dick Grayson]]. When Dick later gives up his role as Robin, he recalls the Kandorian adventure and renames himself Nightwing, in homage to both Batman and Superman. After the events of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' re-boot the [[Timeline of the DC Universe|DC continuity]], Superman no longer has knowledge of Kandor; instead, he remembers Nightwing as an urban legend of Krypton, which he shares with a young Dick Grayson. Grayson, who considers Superman his favorite superhero, takes the identity in his honor.

In [[Blüdhaven]], a sociopath named Tad Ryerstad becomes a superhero, inspired by the retired hero [[Tarantula (DC Comics)|Tarantula]]. He takes his name, [[Nite-Wing]], from an all-night deli specializing in chicken wings. Unstable, Nite-Wing beats people for minor offenses. On Nite-Wing's first night out, he is shot and Dick Grayson as Nightwing, Blüdhaven's protector, defends him from [[Blockbuster (comics)#Roland Desmond|Blockbuster]]'s gang, who think it is Nightwing who has been injured. After Nite-Wing is released from the hospital, he kills the gang who put him there. Not realizing how violent Ryerstad is, Grayson agrees to train him. The two attack Blockbuster's organization but are captured and separated. After an undercover FBI agent frees Nite-Wing, Ryerstad beats him to death, and when he realizes what he has done, Ryerstad flees. Nightwing tracks him down and incarcerates Nite-Wing.

In 2001's ''[[Superman: The Man of Steel]]'' #111, Superman and [[Lois Lane]] travel to Krypton. Labeled as criminals, Superman and Lois become fugitives, adopting the Nightwing and Flamebird identities to survive, just as had Superman and Olsen in ''Superman'' #158.

<!-- NOTE! We DO NOT know which Nightwing this is yet.  In one interview they said Dick, in another they were cagey.  We have to leave it vague until we can have this firmed up. -->In the series [[52 (comics)|52]], while Dick Grayson, [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Robin]] and [[Batman]] are away, Nightwing comes to Gotham and meets the new [[Batwoman]]. On Christmas Eve, he gives her an official batarang.

In the 2006 ''[[One Year Later]]'' storylines, multiple characters join Dick Grayson in using the name "Nightwing". [[Bruce Jones (comics)|Bruce Jones]]' ''Nightwing'' run features [[Jason Todd]] prowling the streets of New York City under the guise of Nightwing, copying Grayson's costume. Additionally, a [[metahuman]] fashion designer named [[Cheyenne Freemont]] dons a modified Nightwing costume to help Grayson. In [[Greg Rucka]]'s ''Supergirl'' (Vol. 3) #6, [[Power Girl]] and [[Supergirl]] assume the identities of Nightwing and Flamebird in a story set in Kandor, just as in the original stories featuring Superman.

==In other media==

[[Dick Grayson]] is the only character to use the codename of "Nightwing" in media other than [[comic book]]s.

Dick Grayson appears as Nightwing in ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', voiced by actor [[Loren Lester]], the actor who had voiced Grayson as [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''. The episode "Old Wounds" explains that Grayson, as Robin, fought with Batman over the latter's controlling nature and what the former saw as an unnecessarily harsh approach, causing Grayson to leave Gotham as a result. However, he returns years later as Nightwing. Although he works with Batman several times during the course of the series, he never fully reconciles with his former mentor. 

In the film ''[[Batman Forever]]'' Dick Grayson ([[Chris O'Donnell]]) suggests "Nightwing" as a name for himself.

Nightwing also has a cameo as a silhouette in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "Grudge Match". As [[Black Canary]] enters [[Blüdhaven]], Nightwing can be seen on a rooftop next to two gargoyles.  

In the ''[[Teen Titans (animated series)|Teen Titans]]'' [[animated series]] episode "How Long is Forever?", Nightwing once appears as the future identity of [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]. He also appears in the ''[[Teen Titans Go!]]'' comic series based on the series. [http://teentitans.toonzone.net/index.php?content=ttgo/guide/31]

Dick Grayson appears as Robin in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' and is set to appear as Nightwing in a fourth season episode. 

Similar to how Superman uses Batman for inspiration as a masked vigilante in the original Nightwing story, the ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' episode "Knight Time" features Superman dressing as Batman and teaming with Robin to keep Gotham safe after Batman mysteriously disappears. He is uncomfortable with the role, but Robin coaches him in Batman's threatening tactics.
