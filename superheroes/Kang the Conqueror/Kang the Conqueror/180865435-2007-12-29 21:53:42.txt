'''Kang the Conqueror''' (born '''Nathaniel Richards''' and also known as '''Iron Lad''', '''Pharaoh Rama-Tut''', '''Immortus''', and the '''Scarlet Centurion''') is a [[fictional character]] and a [[supervillain]] that appears in the [[Marvel Universe]]. The character was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] and first appears in [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] #8 (Sep. 1964).

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
Nathaniel Richards was a scholar and born the futuristic 40th century. Bored with the perfection of his society, Richards became fascinated with history and discovered the [[time travel]] technology created by one of his ancestors, [[Doctor Doom]]. <ref>Mentioned in ''Avengers'' #11 (Dec. 1964)</ref> Richards then travels back in time to ancient [[Egypt]] and becomes the '''[[Pharaoh Rama-Tut]]'''. Kang rules there until driven off after two encounters with the time-displaced heroes of the 20th century, being the [[Fantastic Four]] <ref>''Fantastic Four'' #19 (Sep. 1963)</ref> and later the [[West Coast Avengers]]. <ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #22 (Jul. 1987)</ref>

Embittered by this defeat, he travels forward to the 20th century of alternate timeline, being Earth-689, and meets his ancestor Dr. Doom. Richards then designs armour for himself based on Doom's, and calling himself the '''Scarlet Centurion''' manipulates the Avengers from this timeline - the original team - into apprehending all heroes and villains. The Centurion then transports the Avengers from the mainstream Marvel universe ([[Earth-616]]) into the timeline, hoping that they will defeat their Earth-689 equivalents, and can then be disposed of. While the mainstream versions do defeat their counterparts, they are also able to force the Centurion from the timeline. <ref>''Avengers'' Annual #2 (Sep. 1968)</ref> The Centurion then travels back to his home century, and reinvents himself as '''Kang the Conqueror''', and using the resources at his disposal establishes an empire. 

On Kang's first foray into the 20th century, he is thwarted by the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. <ref>''Avengers'' #8 (Sep. 1964)</ref> Kang is furious and swears vengeance, and battles the Avengers to a stalemate on two more occasions. <ref>''Avengers'' #11 (Dec. 1964); #23 - 24 (Dec. 1965 - Jan. 1966)</ref> After an encounter with the Thunder God [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], <ref>''Thor'' #140 (May 1967)</ref> Kang returns and enters into a wager with the cosmic entity [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]], and uses the Avengers as his pawns against the Grandmaster's newly created champions, the [[Squadron Sinister]]. <ref>''Avengers'' #69 - 71 (Oct. 1969 - Dec. 1969)</ref> This also ends in stalemate, and Kang later has a brief encounter with the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] <ref>''Hulk'' #135 (Jan. 1971)</ref> before trying to capture the Avengers once more - a scheme foiled by [[Spider-Man]], the [[Human Torch]] and the [[Inhumans]]. <ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #9 - 11 (May. 1972 - Jul. 1973)</ref>

Several months later Kang reappears, seeking the '''Celestial Madonna''' for a mate, whom he believes is on Earth. The discovery that it is the Avenger [[Mantis (comics)|Mantis]] leads to another confrontation with the Avengers. The Avengers are aided by a futuristic version of Rama-Tut, who has abandoned his identity as Kang and seeks to counsel and change his younger, conquering self. While Kang is stopped, Rama-tut is unable to prevent the accidental death of the Avenger the [[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]]. <ref>''Avengers'' #129 (Nov. 1974) + ''Avengers Giant-Size'' #2 (1974)</ref> As Kang escapes, the Avenger [[Hawkeye]] choses to pursue him (courtesy of Doom's time-travel machine), which results in a final battle in the Old West in 1871. Aided by the futuristic Rama-Tut once more - who has evolved after a study of time into [[Immortus]] - Hawkeye, Thor and ally [[Moondragon]] confront Kang. In trying to defeat Thor, Kang draws on an excessive amount of energy and destroys himself. <ref>''Avengers'' #141 - 143 (Nov. 1975 - Jan. 1976)</ref>
