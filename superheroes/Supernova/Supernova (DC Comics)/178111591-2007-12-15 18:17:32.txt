'''Supernova''' is an identity used by three characters in the {{DC Universe}}, all related to the Carter bloodline.

==Fictional character history==
===Michael Jon Carter===
{{mainarticle|Booster Gold}}
A superhero from the future known as "Booster Gold", Michael Jon Carter time traveled with [[Rip Hunter]]'s help to fake his death and become the new superhero '''Supernova''', as part of their plan to stop [[Skeets]], who was being controlled by [[Mister Mind]].

===Daniel Carter===
'''Daniel Carter''' is Michael's ancestor in the present. He becomes Supernova after Michael reassumes his Booster Gold identity.

Daniel Carter, before becoming Supernova, had a life very similar to Michael's. A former high school football superstar, he permanently injures his knee in a game he lost, thus effectively ending his career. [[Mister Mind]] finds him and manipulates him, eventually trapping him in the timestream before he is rescued by Booster Gold and Rip Hunter, who defeat Mister Mind. Afterwards, Booster Gold agrees to leave Supernova's identity to Daniel, hoping to shape him into a better person. Daniel fails to make good use of the new suit, however, and it is stolen by an unknown figure.

===Booster Gold's father===
The third Supernova appears in ''Booster Gold'' #1, having stolen the suit from Daniel Carter and capitalizing upon anomalies in time. Seen only in shadow, he appeared after Booster and Rip Hunter left for the timestream, knocked out Daniel, and took the suit. He is then seen traveling to [[Korugar]], eight years into the past, wanting to talk to the [[Green Lantern]] [[Sinestro]] about the future. He persuades Sinestro to go to Earth, years before he should, and talk to [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]], which would set in motion a chain of events, resulting in Guy's premature death, and the [[Sinestro Corps]] being formed many years before its time, causing the entire universe to be under Sinestro's command. His plan was foiled by Booster Gold, who managed to convince Sinestro that Supernova was a [[Qward]]ian in disguise, and that it was all a ploy to cause him to feel fear.

His second plot, to kill [[Jonathan Kent]]'s great-grandfather, resulting in the Kents never finding [[Superman]], was also foiled.  Recently, Supernova and Rex Hunter (a boy that Rip knew) tried to ensure that the lightning that gave [[Barry Allen]] his powers did not hit him, making them the two greatest heroes of all-time.  Booster was able to gain the upper hand in their battle, and was able to unmask Supernova as Booster Gold's father.  However, he was unable to capture his father, as the lightning rod was struck at the same time Supernova was touching it, causing the suit's chronal machinery to burn out, leaving him stranded in an unspecified time.

==Connections to Superman==
Supernova's costume is similar in design&mdash;albeit with a different color scheme&mdash;to the costume of '''Nova''', an "[[Elseworlds|imaginary story]]" version of [[Superman]] who lost his Kryptonian powers and became a [[Batman]]-like crimefighter in a two-part story<ref>''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' #178 (September [[1968]]) and #180 (November 1968)</ref> This version of the character also reappeared as one of several alternate versions of Superman.<ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #5</ref> Later, Luthor believes Supernova to be his enemy, Superman, while Wonder Girl believed him to be her deceased boyfriend, Superboy.<ref name="52:22">''52: Week Twenty-Two''</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Supernova uses the [[Phantom Zone#Post-Crisis|Phantom Zone Projector]] built into his suit to teleport matter from one place to another through the Phantom Zone itself.<ref>''52: Week Thirty-Seven''</ref> He has used this ability on several occasions, such as rescuing bystanders from various disasters,<ref>''52: Week Eight''</ref> removing a sea creature terrorizing Metropolis,<ref>''52: Week Fifteen''</ref> and removing a surveillance satellite trained on him from hundreds of miles away.<ref name="52:22"/> The suit contains a white dwarf star size-changing belt, as the one used by the [[Atom (comics)|Atom]], and an advanced laser system able to melt steel, and Rip Hunter claims to have built it as resistant to all time ravages. The suit is so advanced that
it is able "to freeze time for his wearer". As long as the wearer keeps the suit on, he/she feels no need for eating or drinking, able to exist indefinitely and ageless. <ref>''52 Pick-Up: Booster Gold #1''</ref> The suit is specifically keyed to the Carter DNA, requiring any wearer to be related to Booster in order for the suit's abilities to function.<ref>''52: Week Fifty-Two''</ref>

Supernova's other abilities are:
*Flight
*Teleportation
*Light projection
*Power suit
*Size manipulation
*Matter absorption
*Dimensional manipulation
*Time travel
