'''Supernova''' is an identity used by three characters in the {{DC Universe}}, all related to the Carter bloodline. The first appearance of this character was in the weekly DC Comics series [[52 (comic book)|52]] where the mystery of his true identity and purpose was one of the recurring themes of the series.

==Publication history==

The character of Supernova first appears during the eighth issue of the weekly comic series [[52 (comic book)|52]]. His costume and name are similar in design&mdash;albeit with a different color scheme&mdash;to the costume of '''Nova''', an "[[Elseworlds|imaginary story]]" version of [[Superman]] who lost his Kryptonian powers and became a [[Batman]]-like crimefighter in a two-part story<ref>''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' #178 (September [[1968]]) and #180 (November 1968)</ref> This version of the character also reappeared as one of several alternate versions of Superman.<ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #5</ref> In the ''[[Superman/Batman]] Annual'' #2, a temporarily powerless Superman wears a costume with a similar design to the Nova suit, but calls himself Supernova.

During Week 15, as Booster Gold gets bad promotion and publicity, Supernova seems to be getting the new good promotion and publicity that Booster Gold was once having.<ref>"52" Week Fifteen</ref>

This was an intentional design choice on the parts of the writers {{Fact|date=July 2008}} to feed into the mystery that was set-up in his first appearance - ''who is Supernova?'' As the series progressed, the narrative and characters within the narrative presented a number of choices for the real identity of Supernova.

During Week 19, Supernova met with Wonder Girl, who thought that he was Kon-El.<ref>"52" Week Nineteen"</ref>. Lex Luthor sees footage of this meeting, three weeks later...

During Week 22, and is furious when he discovers this three weeks later. He thinks that Supernova is Superman!<ref>"52" Week Twenty-Two</ref>

The character Ralph Dibny confronts and confirms the identity of Supernova but this information is not shared with the reader until issue #37 of the series where he is revealed to be [[Booster Gold]]. With the assistance of [[Rip Hunter]], he had faked his death and travelled back in time to become Supernova as part of a plan to stop [[Skeets]], who was being controlled by [[Mister Mind]].

The Supernova suit is then employed by '''Daniel Carter''', Booster Gold's ancestor in the present. Echoing the origins of that character, Carter is a former high school football superstar, who has permanently injured his knee ending his career. [[Mister Mind]] finds him and manipulates him, eventually trapping him in the timestream before he is rescued by Booster Gold and Rip Hunter, who defeat Mister Mind at the climax of the 52 series.

Following on from those events, the character is next seen in a relaunched Booster Gold series that uses many of the same themes as the 52 series. Rip Hunter and Booster Gold continue their alliance to try and avoid other dangerous changes to historical events. Booster Gold agrees to leave Supernova's identity to Daniel, hoping to shape him into a better person. Daniel fails to make good use of the new suit, however, and it is stolen by Booster Gold's father, '''Jonar Carter''' who becomes the third person to be use the Supernova costume <ref name="52 Pick-Up: Booster Gold #1">''52 Pick-Up: Booster Gold #1''</ref> <ref>''52 Pick-Up: Booster Gold #4''</ref>.

Jonar is shown working with other characters such as the [[Ultra-Humanite]], [[Per Degaton]], [[Despero]], and the [[Black Beetle (comics)|Black Beetle]] as a group known as "The Time Stealers". Using time as a weapon for conquest, they attempt to change history for their benefit. For example, by attempting to kill [[Jonathan Kent]]'s great-grandfather, resulting in the Kents never finding [[Superman]]. It is revealed that Jonar is under the control of Mister Mind and the trauma caused by his removal kills him.

Parallel to those events, Daniel is left at home, where he meets Rose Levin, his future wife, and a [[blogger]]/[[journalist]] hoping to make her fortune selling articles and photos of Booster Gold. <ref name="52 Pick-Up: Booster Gold #6">''52 Pick-Up: Booster Gold #6''</ref>. Rip Hunter comes to Daniel and Rose and convinces them to assist him in stopping a attempt to erase Booster Gold from history <ref>''52 Pick-Up: Booster Gold #10''</ref> <ref name="52 Pick-Up: Booster Gold #6"/> After witnessing the unsympathetic and harsh reprimands Rip gives Booster for his leave of absence, he and Rose agree with Booster to disband the ''Time Masters'', and try to return back to their former lives. <ref>''52 Pick-Up: Booster Gold One Million''</ref>

His resolution begins to vane, and he soon returns to his time-travelling career, albeit for a different kind of selfish reason: hoping to impress Rose, he timetravels during the [[Invasion! (DC Comics)|Dominators Invasion]] of Earth, searching for a family heirloom Rose lost escaping from [[Paris]]. During his searches, he meets a [[Starro]]-probe, and thinking it harmless, tries to contain it in a mayonnaise-jar, from which escapes, taking control of Rip Hunter and the timestream. Booster recruits him again to undo the damage <ref>''Booster Gold'' #13 (2008)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Supernova uses the [[Phantom Zone#Post-Crisis|Phantom Zone Projector]] built into his suit to teleport matter from one place to another through the Phantom Zone itself.<ref>''52: Week Thirty-Seven''</ref> He has used this ability on several occasions, such as rescuing bystanders from various disasters,<ref>''52: Week Eight''</ref> removing a sea creature terrorizing Metropolis,<ref>''52: Week Fifteen''</ref> and removing a surveillance satellite trained on him from hundreds of miles away.<ref name="52:22">''52: Week Twenty-Two''</ref> The suit contains a white dwarf star size-changing belt, as the one used by the [[Atom (comics)|Atom]], and an advanced laser system able to melt steel, and Rip Hunter claims to have built it as resistant to all time ravages. The suit is so advanced that
it is able "to freeze time for his wearer". As long as the wearer keeps the suit on, he/she feels no need for eating or drinking, able to exist indefinitely and ageless. <ref name="52 Pick-Up: Booster Gold #1"/> The suit is specifically keyed to the Carter DNA, requiring any wearer to be related to Booster in order for the suit's abilities to function.<ref>''52: Week Fifty-Two''</ref>

After the original suit is stolen by Jonar, and subsequently damaged, Rip Hunter presents Daniel with a new suit to help him saving Booster Gold from the ''Time Stealers''. Aside from being darker in color, with the white elements turned into black ones, is still unknown how and if it's more advanced than the former white model.
