'''Supernova''' is a fictional [[superhero]] in the [[DC Universe]] who first appeared in ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' issue #8 in June 2006.

==Character history==
Eight weeks into the series ''[[52 (comic book)|52]]'', sightings of a mysterious hero are reported by several eyewitnesses, with his exploits revealed in flashbacks. He saves an elderly woman and others from a falling [[monorail]] by seemingly teleporting them to safety, rescues a group of [[firemen]] in a burning building by vanishing the falling rafters, shears a gunman's rifle in half to save police officers, and saves a young girl from a [[rip current]].

The ''Daily Star'' newsapaper has the first [[exclusive]] of the new superhero, dubbing him "Supernova". That same day, Supernova saves [[Clark Kent]] as Kent pulls a "Lois Lane" and jumps out of a window at the [[Daily Planet]], in order to get an interview. Supernova cuts the interview short to take on Bahdnesian terrorists in a stolen [[US Army]] [[all-terrain vehicle]], and moves a chunk of pavement instantly, leading the criminals to drive the vehicle into the resultant hole and surrender. Supernova then secures the crime scene and protects a young boy from falling into the hole. All the while, Kent watches amongst a crowd of witnesses, taking pictures and getting brief statements from Supernova.

Several weeks later, a gigantic crustacean (a Ballostro) arrives in Metropolis to feed. Supernova begins to repulse the monster, ensure the safety of a nuclear powered submarine brought in the city by the monster itself and reassure the local population when [[Booster Gold]] arrives. Booster and Supernova immediately clash, with Supernova urging Booster to step back, and going so far as to call Booster a fraud. Booster knocks out Supernova, who wakes up too late to save Booster from his kamikaze attempt to save the city from the radiation leakage of the submarine. Supernova catches the dead body of Booster as it falls from the sky and is left mourning his death along with Clark Kent and [[Skeets]].

Over the course of the next few weeks, speculation about Supernova's identity and addressed and further fueled. One night, deposites Cassandra Sandsmark ([[Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark)|Wonder Girl]]) on a rooftop whereand she confronted Supernova about his apparent lack of recognition of her. He responds blandly and begins to leave. As he goes, Cassie calls him "[[Kon-El]]."

Days later, Supernova is shown exploring the currently unoccupied [[Batcave]]. The Batcave's location is known to only select individuals such as [[Superman]], Kon-El, [[Blue Beetle (Ted Kord)|Ted Kord]], [[Green Lantern (Hal Jordan)|Hal Jordan]] and [[Booster Gold]]. A week or so after this, [[Lex Luthor]] saw in Supernova the same [[modus operandi]] and attitude of Superman. Luthor believes Supernova to be Superman, taking a masked identity to toy with him.<ref>''52: Week 22''</ref> 

Eventually, several weeks later in ''52: Week 31'', Supernova and [[Ralph Dibny]] talk. Dibny reveals that he knows Supernova isn't Superboy. Ralph states that while the powers did confuse him, he realized that one device could give him his powers. He also states that Superman's disappearance was the key. Ralph does not reveal who Supernova actually is.

==Connections to Superman==
[[Image:WorlsFinest178Cover.jpg|thumb|right|110px|Cover of [[World's Finest Comics|World's Finest]] #178.]]
The character was first mentioned in ''[http://wizarduniverse.com Wizard]'' and [http://www.newsarama.com Newsarama], although the first mention in-story was in ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' #650. 

Supernova's costume is similar in design &mdash; albeit with a different color scheme &mdash; to the costume of '''Nova''', an "[[Elseworlds|imaginary story]]" version of [[Superman]] who lost his Kryptonian powers and became a [[Batman]]-like crimefighter in a two-part story in ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' #178 (September [[1968]]) and #180 (November 1968).  This version of the character also appeared in ''Infinite Crisis'' #5 as one of the many versions of Superman. Later, Luthor believes Supernova to be his enemy, Superman.<ref>''52: Week 22''</ref>.

==Powers and abilities==
The exact nature of Supernova's powers was unclear as of his debut, but he has been shown to fly and emit powerfully bright flashes of light when performing superheroic acts. He can remove matter with energy beams coming from his eyes. It was not apparent if the matter is disintegrated or removed by other means. At one point, when asked what happened to an object he removed, he remarked "I sent it away."  He also appears to teleport in bright flashes of light. He is able to sense and "remove" a surveillance satellite trained on him from hundreds of miles away.

In issue 31 of ''[[52 (comic book)|52]]'', [[Ralph Dibny]] states that "one device could tie [Supernova's superpowers] all together".

==Appearances in other media==
Supernova has recently been announced to appear in the [[52 (comic book)|52]] wave 1 series of action figures.<ref>[http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/toyfare/001649824.cfm Toy Fare]</ref>
