'''Supernova''' aka '''Nova Omega''' '''(Garthan Saal)''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Comics Universe]]. Garthaan Saal a member of the Xandarian Nova Corps was one of the few Xandarians who survived the destruction of [[Xandar]] at the hands of [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]] the space pirate (Xandar had previously been destroyed two times before, once by [[Zorr]] who Nebula would later allege is her father and then by the [[Skrulls]]. It has since been resurrected and destroyed for a fourth time by Annihilus).

Garthaan Saal contained the power of the entire Nova Corps within his body which increased him to the size of a giant and drove him mad. Supernova's desire for revenge against Nebula led him on a quest to track her down and exact his revenge. He had heard that Nebula had recently been a member of the Avengers (in actuality this was a temporal counterpart to Kang's long lost love [[Ravonna]] who assumed the guise of Nebula)

Supernova first attacked the Avenger [[Starfox (comics)|Starfox]] (another alleged relative of Nebula's) in space which led to a confrontation between Supernova and the combined forces of the Avengers, Fantastic Four and fellow surviving Xandarian [[Firelord]] (a former herald of Galactus). Supernova was only defeated by tricking him into the timestream to find the woman he believed was Nebula as she had been lost in the timestream during a previous encounter with the Avengers. 

Years later Garthan Saal returned from the time stream even more crazed. He had come to realize that there was a small sliver of the Xandarian Nova Corps power that was still housed within the earthling [[Richard Rider]] aka Nova, a former member of the Xandarian Nova Corps and at that time a member of the New Warriors. Supernova came to earth and drained Nova of all his powers effectively killing him (ruining his date with [[Laura Dunham]]). Richard was resurrected thanks to another surviving Xandarian (and former herald of [[Galactus]]) named [[Air-Walker]]. Air-Walker and Firelord joined Nova and the New Warriors into a battle in space with Supernova. During the battle Supernova tried to drain a powerless Richard Rider again but this led to Richard himself having full control of the Nova Force. Nova was convinced by his friends to relinquish the power and use it to reboot the Xandarian Worldmind (A network that serves as a repository of all Xandarian knowledge, culture and power). Having done this the Worldmind resurrected the Xandarian race and Nova Corps was reborn. Nova was given more power but eventually was depowered again at which point Garthaan Saal became the Nova assigned for Earth and took the name Nova Omega. His appointment caused great friction between him and the depowered Richard Rider. Garthan  began tracking Volx the queen (and mother) of the [[Dire Wraiths]]. In the final issue of the original New Warrior series Volx murders Garthan. As a parting gift Garthan Saal returns the Nova force to Richard Rider.

As of the 4th volume of the ''Nova'' series Richard Rider is again in possession of the entirety of the Nova Force after the Worldmind's recent attempts to recreate the Nova Corps. Malik Tarcel, one of the members of the recently rebooted (and later deactivated) Nova Corps is captured by Shi'ar forces and tortured. After the torture is over a man claiming to be Garthan Saal arrives to rescue him.
