'''Blue Devil''' is a [[superhero]] featured in material published by [[DC Comics]]. He first appeared in a preview story published in ''Fury of [[Firestorm]]'' #24, cover dated June [[1984]]. That story lead directly into ''Blue Devil'' #1, also cover dated June 1984.

==Fictional character biography==

[[Image:bluedevil.jpg|thumb|left|120px|''Blue Devil'' #1]]

'''Daniel Patrick Cassidy''' was a [[special effects]] wizard and [[stunt performer|stuntman]] hired to create and play the title character in the movie ''Blue Devil''. To that end Cassidy created a full-body costume with a hidden powered [[exoskeleton]] and built-in special-effects devices. When two of his co-stars accidentally freed a demon named [[Nebiros]], Cassidy used his costume to drive the demon back, but not before being blasted with mystical energy. After the fight, Cassidy found that the blast had permanently grafted the Blue Devil costume to his body. Ironically, Cassidy is a devout [[Catholic]].

Cassidy quickly found himself embroiled in repeated adventures and conflicts with [[supervillain]]s. Apparently, the blast that fused him with his costume had also turned him into a sort of "weirdness magnet". Although he continued to seek a way to regain a normal life, Cassidy became more comfortable as a superhero over time and eventually joined the [[Justice League of America]]. In his series, Cassidy was occasionally assisted by his personal [[fanboy]] and fellow powersuit user, [[Kid Devil]] (Eddie Bloomberg).

=== Blue demon and later alliances ===

When the demon [[Neron]] took control of [[Hell]] and began seeking souls on Earth, Blue Devil was one of those he approached. Neron offered him a chance to be a movie star, but neglected to mention that the bargain would also result in the death of one of Cassidy's closest friends. In the end, Cassidy cheated Neron of his prize but died in the process. Cassidy was soon reincarnated as an actual demon. Now, instead of a man in a costume, he was an actual Blue Devil.

Cassidy rejoined the Justice League and remained with them until his second death, this time at the hands of the villainous [[Mist (comics)|Mist]]. His bones were secretly recovered by the magician [[Sebastian Faust]], who eventually restored Blue Devil to have him destroy Nebiros. Cassidy then joined the [[Sentinels of Magic]] and eventually gave his life a third time fighting Hermes Trismegistus. He did not remain dead long, however, and roamed the Earth for a time banishing demons back to Hell.

=== One Year Later ===

{{spoiler}}

Cassidy currently works as a bouncer at the Oblivion Bar, and was present when [[Ragman]], [[Enchantress (DC Comics)|Enchantress]] and the [[Detective Chimp]] called for allies in the battle against the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] in ''[[Day of Vengeance]]''. He soon became the strong-man of the [[Shadowpact]], able to even wound [[Eclipso]], and has since decided to stay with the team. He is now helping his new teammates to contain the wild magic set free by the Spectre's actions.

In the ongoing ''Shadowpact'' series, Cassidy and his teammates were trapped inside a blood shield that grew over the town of Riverrock, Wyoming. In issue #2, while inside the town, Cassidy met a member of magic-based villain group called the Pentacle named Jack of Fire. Jack looks like a cross between Cassidy and [[Hellboy]], wears a bandana over his mouth, and wields pyrokinetic abilities. Jack claims that he is Cassidy's brother, and that he got this way because of Cassidy's deal with Neron had expanded to his whole family. His parents were pulled out of Heaven and apparently, Cassidy has a younger sister named Mary, and an elder sister named Frances (or "Frankie" as he referred to her in the original title series).  It is currently unknown if Jack of Fire's claims are true or if he is even Cassidy's brother.

One day Eddie, now a real child demon himself, came to Cassidy inquiring about his aunt Marla's death. Blue Devil admitted that he had not been honest with Eddie, and the teen responded hastily in shock. Before he could explain the truth to Eddie, Cassidy was told by his former sidekick to stay far away.

==Powers==

Even before he became Blue Devil, Dan Cassidy was a highly trained martial artist and acrobat. His costume included [[Kevlar]] body armor, visual and auditory amplifiers, radio gear, and servo-motors which increased his strength at least twenty-fold. After being grafted to Cassidy's body the costume became organic and gained the ability to self-repair at an extremely fast rate (effectively a [[healing factor]]). Cassidy's abilities seem to have been changed little by his transformation into an actual demon.

Originally, Blue Devil wielded a [[trident]] of his own design which included, among other things, [[rocket]] engines capable of carrying two people at high speeds. He now carries the '''Trident of Lucifer''', which allows him to find demons on Earth and banish them to Hell. During a recent battle with Eclipso and the Spectre the Trident was thrown into the ocean; it was recovered shortly after by [[Aquaman]] who returned it to Cassidy.

== Other Versions ==

In ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'', there is a background character named '''Blue Devil II'''.

In the comic book adaptation of [[Justice League Unlimited]], Blue Devil is the featured character of issue number 25.

Blue Devil has made background appearances in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' and has a speaking role in the episode "Destroyer".
