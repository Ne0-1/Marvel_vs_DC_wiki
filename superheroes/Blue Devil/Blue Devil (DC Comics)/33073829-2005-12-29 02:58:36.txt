'''Blue Devil''' is a [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]].  Originally a man in a high-tech costume, he has since been transformed into an actual [[demon]].  Blue Devil was created by Dan Mishkin, Gary Cohn, and Paris Cullins and first appeared in ''Fury of [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]]'' #24 ([[1984]]).

==Background / History==
Dan Cassidy was a [[special effects]] wizard and [[stuntman]] hired to create and play the title character in the movie ''Blue Devil''.  To that end Cassidy created a full-body costume with a hidden powered [[exoskeleton]] and built-in special-effects devices.  When two of his co-stars accidentally freed a demon named [[Nebiros]], Cassidy used his costume to drive the demon back, but not before being blasted with mystical energy.  After the fight, Cassidy found that the blast had permanently grafted the Blue Devil costume to his body.

Cassidy quickly found himself embroiled in repeated adventures and conflicts with [[supervillain|supervillains]].  Apparently, the blast that fused him with his costume had also turned him into a sort of "weirdness magnet".  Although he continued to seek a way to regain a normal life, Cassidy became more comfortable as a superhero over time and eventually joined the [[Justice League of America]].

When the demon [[Neron]] took control of [[Hell]] and began seeking souls on Earth, Blue Devil was one of those he approached.  Neron offered him a chance to be a movie star, but neglected to mention that the bargain would also result in the death of one of Cassidy's closest friends.  In the end, Cassidy cheated Neron of his prize but died in the process.  Cassidy was soon reincarnated as an actual demon.  Now, instead of a man in a costume, he was an actual Blue Devil.

Cassidy rejoined the Justice League and remained with them until his second death, this time at the hands of the villainous [[Mist (comics)|Mist]].  His bones were secretly recovered by the magician [[Faust (comics)|Faust]], who eventually restored Blue Devil to have him destroy Nebiros.  Cassidy then joined the [[Sentinels of Magic]] and eventually gave his life a third time fighting [[Hermes Trismegistus (comics)|Hermes Trismegistus]].  He did not remain dead long, however, and roamed the Earth for a time banishing demons back to Hell. 

{{spoiler}}
Cassidy currently works as a bouncer at the [[Oblivion Bar]], in which he met [[Ragman]], [[Enchantress (DC Comics)|Enchantress]] and [[Detective Chimp]], searching for allies in a battle against the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] in [[Day of Vengeance]]. He soon became the strong one of the [[Shadowpact]], able even to wound [[Eclipso]], group in which he seems to have decided to stay even after the battle. He's now helping his new teammates to contain the wild magic set free by the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]]'s actions.

==Powers==
Even before he became Blue Devil, Dan Cassidy was a highly trained martial artist and acrobat.  His costume included [[Kevlar]] body armor, visual and auditory amplifiers, radio gear, and servo-motors which increased his strength at least twenty-fold.  After being grafted to Cassidy's body the costume became organic and gained the ability to self-repair at an extremely fast rate (effectively a [[healing factor]]).  Cassidy's abilities seem to have been changed little by his transformation into an actual demon.

Originally, Blue Devil wielded a [[trident]] of his own design which included, among other things, [[rocket]] engines capable of carrying two people at speeds of up to 60 miles per hour.  He now carries the '''Trident of Lucifer''', which allows him to find demons on Earth and banish them to Hell.
Unfortunatly his trident was thrown into the ocean and presumably lost in the battle with the Spectre and Eclipso in the miniseries "Day of Vengance" issue six. It is not yet clear wether he will get his trident back or what it's true purpose is at this time.

== Other Media ==
Blue Devil made background appearances in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''
