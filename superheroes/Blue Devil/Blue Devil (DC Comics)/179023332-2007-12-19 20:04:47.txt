'''Daniel Patrick Cassidy''' was a [[special effect]]s wizard and [[stunt performer|stuntman]] hired to create and play the title character in the movie ''Blue Devil''. To that end Cassidy created a full-body costume with a hidden powered [[exoskeleton]] and built-in special-effects devices. When two of his co-stars accidentally freed a demon named [[Nebiros]], Cassidy used his costume to drive the demon back, but not before being blasted with mystical energy. After the fight, Cassidy found that the blast had permanently grafted the Blue Devil costume to his body. Ironically, Cassidy is a devout [[Catholic]].

Cassidy quickly found himself embroiled in repeated adventures and conflicts with [[supervillain]]s. Apparently, the blast that fused him with his costume had also turned him into a sort of "weirdness magnet". Although he continued to seek a way to regain a normal life, Cassidy became more comfortable as a superhero over time and eventually joined the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]]. In his series, Cassidy was occasionally assisted by his personal [[fanboy]] and fellow powersuit user, [[Kid Devil]] (Eddie Bloomberg).

=== Blue demon and later alliances ===

When the demon [[Neron]] takes control of [[Hell]] and began seeking souls on Earth, Blue Devil was one of those he approached. Neron offered him a chance to be a movie star, but neglected to mention that the bargain would also result in the death of one of Cassidy's closest friends. Cassidy accepted; his part of the bargain was to destroy an automatic electrical substation far in the desert, which he did. When his reporter friend Marlene investigated, an accident occurred, killing her and her pilot. In sympathy for Cassidy's loss, movie offers poured in.

In the end, Cassidy cheated Neron of his prize but died in the process. Cassidy was soon reincarnated as an actual demon. Now, instead of a man in a costume, he was an actual Blue Devil.

Cassidy rejoined the Justice League and remained with them until his second death, this time at the hands of the villainous [[Mist (comics)|Mist]]. Blue Devil had joined an incarnation of Justice League Europe but the Mist attacked, killing most of the team. Blue Devil was seemingly destroyed in a rain of holy water, leaving only his skeleton behind. His bones were secretly recovered by the magician [[Sebastian Faust]], who took them with him on a mission with other superheroes. Their goal was to travel to Hell to restart its fires, as Hell itself had completely frozen over and demons walked the Earth. The team confronts Nebiros, the last demon in hell, who was guarding the portal to the fires in the City of Dis. Nebiros sports his own demonic trident, which he claims was given to him by the King of Lies himself. Though with Nebiros being a demon, this itself might have been a lie. Faust manifests Blue Devil out of a bag of bones. He steals the trident and throws Nebiros high into the air. A blast from [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] turns the demon's blood into cement, seemingly killing him. The hellish invasion is defeated by other means.

Cassidy then joins the [[Sentinels of Magic]] and partners with Faust, though this friendship was not all Cassidy's will. He was soon let free via the restoration of his very last bone, because Faust did not want to see Cassidy get hurt. Cassidy did though, eventually giving his life a third time fighting Hermes Trismegistus. He did not remain dead long, however, and roams the Earth for a time banishing demons back to Hell.

=== One Year Later ===

Cassidy currently works as a bouncer at the Oblivion Bar, and was present when [[Ragman]], [[Enchantress (DC Comics)|Enchantress]] and the [[Detective Chimp]] called for allies in the battle against the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] in ''[[Day of Vengeance]]''. He soon became the strong-man of the [[Shadowpact]], able to even wound [[Eclipso]], and has since decided to stay with the team. He is now helping his new teammates to contain the wild magic set free by the Spectre's actions.

In the ongoing ''Shadowpact'' series, Cassidy and his teammates were trapped inside a blood shield that grew over the town of Riverrock, Wyoming. In issue #2, while inside the town, Cassidy met a member of magic-based villain group called the Pentacle named Jack of Fire. Jack looks like a cross between Cassidy and [[Hellboy]], wears a bandana over his mouth, and wields pyrokinetic abilities. Jack claims that he is Cassidy's brother, and that he got this way because Cassidy's deal with Neron was expanded to his whole family. His parents were pulled out of Heaven along with Cassidy's younger sister Mary and his older sister Frances. It is currently unknown if Jack of Fire's claims are true or if he is even Cassidy's brother.

One day Eddie, now a real child demon himself, came to Cassidy inquiring about his aunt Marla's death. Blue Devil admitted that he had not been honest with Eddie, and the teen responded hastily in shock. Before he could explain the truth to Eddie, Cassidy was told by his former sidekick to stay far away.

===Zauriel===

Cassidy, demoted to the rank of 'rhyming demon' is under threat by the former Justice League member [[Zauriel]]. Because of Blue Devil's popularity as a demon, he had unknowingly given hell and demons a better image, prompting others to form their own deals with demons. As a result, Zauriel was tasked with killing Blue Devil and doing away with his bad influence on the populace. However, when Zauriel realized that Blue Devil wanted nothing more than to combat hell, Zauriel agreed to give him some time to fix his mistakes. Blue Devil's lawyer is currently in hell bargaining for Blue's soul. Blue Devil himself seeks redemption and has been charged with 13 labors. The story is ongoing.

==Powers==

Even before he became Blue Devil, Dan Cassidy was a highly trained martial artist and acrobat. His costume included [[Kevlar]] body armor, visual and auditory amplifiers, radio gear, mini-gills allowing underwater breathing and servo-motors which increased his strength at least twentyfold. After being grafted to Cassidy's body the costume became organic and gained the ability to self-repair at an extremely fast rate (effectively a [[healing factor]]). Cassidy's abilities seem to have been changed little by his transformation into an actual demon.

In his current incarnation, Blue Devil still possesses some degree of superhuman strength, capable of going toe-to-toe with beings like [[Eclipso]], and knocking out a power-drunk [[Enchantress]] in one punch.  He is also remarkably resistant to physical damage, evidenced when [[Eclipso]] threw him a distance of approximately 500 feet upwards, he didn't even require time to recover before getting up and heading back into the fight.

Originally, Blue Devil wielded a [[trident]] of his own design which included, among other things, [[rocket]] engines capable of carrying two people at high speeds. He now carries the '''Trident of Lucifer''', which allows him to find demons on Earth and banish them to Hell. During a battle with Eclipso and the Spectre the Trident was thrown into the ocean; it was recovered shortly after by [[Aquaman]] who returned it to Cassidy. The trident was recently given to [[Zauriel]], who has taken Blue Devil's place in [[Shadowpact]].
