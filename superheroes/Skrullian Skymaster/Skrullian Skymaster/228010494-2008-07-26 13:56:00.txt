The '''Skrullian Skymaster''' is a [[fictional character]], owned by [[Marvel Comics]] who exists in the universe of the [[Squadron Supreme]].

==Publication history==
The Skrull first appeared in ''Squadron Supreme'' #1 (August 1985) in a flashback, and was created by [[Mark Gruenwald]].

The character subsequently appears in ''Squadron Supreme: New World Order'' #1 (September 1998), and ''Exiles'' #77-78 (April-May 2006).

The Skrull appeared as part of the "Squadron Supreme" entry in the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition]]'' #12.

==Fictional character biography==
The [[Skrull]] Empire has been at war with the [[Kree Empire]]. In an attempt to end the bloodshed the Skrull Empire created a means to imbue their soldiers with extraordinary powers to vanquish the Kree. In an alternate reality to that in which most Marvel Comics stories take place, Skymax was the first and the only soldier experimented on because the coming of the [[Galactus|World Devourer]] that destroyed the Skrull homeworld. Skymax was in the vicinity of Earth when his starship malfunctioned and was rescued by American astronaut Joe Ledger (see [[Doctor Spectrum]]). Grateful for his rescue, Skymax gave Ledger a Power Prism which Ledger used to become the costumed adventurer Doctor Spectrum, while Skymax became the costumed adventurer known as the Skrull. Skymax and Ledger both became founding members of the [[Squadron Supreme]] and Skymax remained with the team until member Tom Thumb repaired his ship allowing him to return to space. Skymax realized that the damage to his ship was beyond repair despite Tom Thumb's efforts and he chose to remain on Earth in secret, searching for any possibility of other Skrull survivors. Not finding any Skymax concluded that he was indeed the last of his race and he stayed on Earth.

After the Squadron returned from their adventures in Earth-616, the sorcerer Mysterium sent the surviving members to retrieve others to help in the rebellion against the Global Directorate. Doctor Spectrum was sent after "the Watcher" and discovered Skymax. Renaming himself the Skrullian Skymaster, and revealing his true origin to Doctor Spectrum, Skymax rejoined the Squadron Supreme and settled with them on Utopia Isle.

==Powers and abilities==
Skymax possesses superhuman abilities matching the [[Super Skrull]] from [[Earth-616]] and also possesses the Skrull's innate racial ability to shape-shift. In Earth-712 the Skrull empire was destroyed, so is not possible that Skymax powers were amplified as the same manner as the powers of the Super Skrull. He is also an excellent hand-to-hand fighter, an accomplished pilot and has knowledge of advanced Skrull technology. Skymax has also exhibited telepathy.

==Other information==
The Skrullian Skymaster was created to be an alternate version of J'onn J'onzz, the [[Martian Manhunter]].{{Fact|date=July 2008}}

The Skrulls of the Squadron's universe were said to be more benign than in other alternate universes (especially in Earth 616).
