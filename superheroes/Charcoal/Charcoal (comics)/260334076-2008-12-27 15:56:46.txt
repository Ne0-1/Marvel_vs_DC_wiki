'''Charcoal''' ('''Charlie Burlingame''') is a [[Marvel Comics]] character and member of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] who was created by a comic book fan for a "Create-A-Villain" contest sponsored by Marvel and [[Wizard Magazine]] and the alter-ego was created by [[Kurt Busiek]] and [[Fabian Nicieza]].

== Publication history ==
Charcoal was created to be a villain, by means of a ''Wizard'' magazine contest. However, ''Wizard Entertainment'' failed to establish certain legal specifics in the language of their contest rules, leaving the ownership of the character's copyright in question (Normally in such a situation, steps would be taken to ensure that, unless otherwise stated, such a character's copyright would legally belong to the comic's publisher). Furthermore, Wizard Entertainment reportedly failed to provide the contest winner with other prizes promised along with the winning character's appearance in a Marvel comic. Feeling undercompensated, Charcoal's creator attempted to legally claim the copyright for the character from Marvel, who reacted by asking then-''Thunderbolts'' writer [[Fabian Nicieza]] to kill Charcoal off and thereby remove the character from contention<ref>[http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2005/08/11/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-11 Comics Should Be Good!

== Fictional character biography ==
'''Charles "Charlie" Burlingame''''s father moved around a great deal and had trouble finding work, until he attended a rally of the [[Imperial Forces of America]]. The elder Burlingame joined that organization and took his son with him. [[Arnim Zola]], working for the Imperial Forces, discovered that Charlie possessed the genetic potential to develop superhuman powers and facilitated the youngster's transformation into Charcoal, the Burning Man. As part of a group called the [[Bruiser Brigade]], Charcoal fought the Thunderbolts as an enemy, but joined the team soon after.

He was subsequently killed in battle with [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]].

== Power and abilities ==
Charlie Burlingame can transform into a being seemingly composed of charcoal. He has the ability to manipulate heat and reshape himself into any carbon form, including flaming incendiary or rock-hard diamond.

== In other media ==
=== Toys ===
:Charcoal has his own figure in the Marvel [[HeroClix]] line.
