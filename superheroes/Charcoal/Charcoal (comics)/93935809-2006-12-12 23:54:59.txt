'''Charcoal''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character and member of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] who was created by a comic book fan for a "Create-A-Villain" contest sponsored by Marvel and [[Wizard Magazine]].

== Character History ==
'''Charlie Burlingame''''s father moved around a great deal and had trouble finding work, until he attended a rally of the [[Imperial Forces of America]]. The elder Burlingame joined that organization and took his son with him. [[Arnim Zola]], working for the Imperial Forces, discovered that Charlie possessed the genetic potential to develop superhuman powers and facilitated the youngster's transformation into Charcoal, the Burning Man. As part of a group called the [[Bruiser Brigade]], Charcoal fought the Thunderbolts as an enemy, but joined the team soon after.

He was subsequently killed in battle with [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]]; this was because Marvel had not properly secured the rights to the character [http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2005/08/11/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-11].

=== Superhuman powers === 
Charlie Burlingame can transform into a being seemingly composed of charcoal. He has the ability to manipulate heat and reshape himself into any carbon form, including flaming incendiary or rock-hard diamond.

== Trivia ==
*Charcoal was created to be a villain, by means of a ''Wizard'' magazine contest.  However, ''Wizard Entertainment'' failed to establish certain legal specifics in the language of their contest rules, leaving the ownership of the character's copyright in question. (Normally in such a situation, steps would be taken to ensure that, unless otherwise stated, such a character's copyright would legally belong to the comic's publisher.)  Furthermore, Wizard Entertainment reportedly failed to provide the contest winner with other prizes promised along with the winning character's appearance in a Marvel comic.  Feeling undercompensated, Charcoal's creator attempted to legally claim the copyright for the character from Marvel, which reacted by asking then (and current) ''Thunderbolts'' writer [[Fabian Nicieza]] to kill Charcoal off and remove the character from contention.

*It is notable that only the superhuman form, powers, and the name "Charcoal" were created by the contest winner--his "normal" form of an African-American teenager, the name "Charlie Burlingame", and all aspects of his personality and origins were created by ''Thunderbolts'' writers [[Kurt Busiek]] and Nicieza.  Nicieza has stated that he has an idea of how to bring back "Charlie Burlingame" without bringing back "Charcoal".
