'''Lyja''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. As a [[Skrull]], she possesses the ability to [[shapeshift]] into almost any humanoid or animal form. Modifications on her body gave her the power to generate energy blasts.

==Character biography==
Longtime enemies of the [[Fantastic Four]], the [[Skrull]] empire embarked on a plan to infiltrate the Fantastic Four via seduction.  The author of the plan, [[Power Skrull|Paibok the Power Skrull]], selected Lyja to be the spy, possibly because they had once had a failed affair.

Unbeknownst even to readers, during the [[Secret Wars]] Lyja replaced [[Alicia Masters]], blind love interest of [[Thing (comics)|the Thing]]. The Skrullian plan almost hit a snag when [[Thing (comics)|the Thing]] opted to stay behind at the end of the war, instead of returning home to Earth. Lyja instead seduced [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]] and eventually went on to marry him.

However, later, Lyja's real identity was revealed, as well as the fact that the real Alicia was a captive of the Skrulls.  In the ensuing battle to rescue Alicia, Lyja was believed to be slain, when she threw herself in the path of a blast which Paibok had meant for the Human Torch.

Instead Paibok recovered her and with the assistance of [[Devos the Devastator]], reanimated Lyja, also bestowing her with the power to fly and fire energy blasts from her hands (becoming "Lyja the Lazerfist").  These powers were later revealed to come from a special device implanted into her.  Joining them in search of vengeance, the three isolated and battled the Torch at [[Empire State University]]. Panicking, the Torch burst into his Nova Flame and destroyed the campus. However, Lyja still bore feelings for the Torch and once again betrayed her cohorts to side with the Four.  

After returning to the Fantasic Four and Johnny, Lyja claimed she was pregnant with Johnny's child.  Over time, Lyja and Johnny began to grow close again.  When Lyja delivered the "child" (an egg), the implant that gave her the "Lazerfist" powers was also removed, returning Lyja to an ordinary Skrull with no extra powers beyond her shapeshifting.  As a sidenote, the implant was subsequently absorbed by a normal human, who gained the "Lazerfist" powers, and attempted to contact the Fantastic Four for their assistance.  However, after the hectic events that followed the hatching of the "egg", he wandered off, realizing the Fantastic Four were not going to be of any help in their current state, and has not been referenced since.

Although Lyja and Johnny were growing close, Lyja was continuously torn about telling Johnny something.  She was to scared to risk shattering the bonds they had managed to form again, and kept putting it off.  Ultimately, it was too late.  The "egg" was revealed, not to be their child, but rather a Skrull bio-weapon, which Lyja subsequently destroyed after it hatched.  Johnny, enranged at being betrayed and deceived again by Lyja, broke things off with her again.

However, still in love with Johnny, Lyja stalked him while as a human, Laura Green. She did eventually reveal herself, however. She became an ally of the Fantastic Four, where she and Johnny seemed to be on track to reconciling their relationship. However, in the wake of the [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] crisis, the Fantastic Four were thought dead, and Lyja left to attempt a normal life, masquerading again as a human woman. 

Lyja recently made an appearance in [[Ronan the Accuser|Ronan]] #3 (part of the [[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]] event).

==Alternate versions==

She remains active among the Fantastic Five and is sporadically seen in the ''[[Spider-Girl]]'' series and related mini-series.
