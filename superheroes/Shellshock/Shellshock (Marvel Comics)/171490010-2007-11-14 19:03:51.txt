==Fictional character biography==
Shellshock was a flunky of [[Psycho-Man]].  When he left Psycho-Man’s employ, he kept the weapon designed for him and teamed up with another former flunky of Psycho-Man, [[Live Wire (Marvel Comics)|Live Wire]].  They attempted to steal [[Alicia Masters]]’s statues, but were defeated by the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]].

Shellshock was present at the “Bar With No Name,” and met his end there, thanks to the [[Scourge of the Underworld]].

==Equipment==
Shellshock used a special handgun that fired assorted projectiles, including shock blasts, microwave energy, gas grenades, explosive miniature missiles, heat-seeking and guided projectiles, and an expanding yeast-putty which entangled opponents.
