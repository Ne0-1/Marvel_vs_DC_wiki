'''Doctor Faustus''' ('''Johann Fennhoff''') is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is depicted usually as an adversary of [[Captain America]]. An [[Austrians|Austrian]] psychiatrist and criminal mastermind who employs [[psychological manipulation]] of his enemies, the character was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]], and first appeared in ''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' (vol 1) #107 (November 1968).

Johann Fennhoff appears in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] TV series ''[[Agent Carter (TV series)|Agent Carter]]'', portrayed by [[Ralph Brown]].

==Creative origins==
Faustus' name comes from the [[Faust|famous character]] of [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s Renaissance play ''[[The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus]]'' about a man who sold his soul to [[Lucifer]] in exchange for 24 years of service from a devil called [[Mephistophiles]] in order to gain all knowledge. This character predates the Christopher Marlowe play, in the legend built around the real-life [[Johann Georg Faust]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

==Fictional character biography==
Johann Fennhoff was born in [[Vienna]], Austria. He became a psychiatrist and criminal mastermind. He has proclaimed himself the "Master of Men's Minds," and is known for the use of psychological methods of combat. His plots typically involve manipulating his foes into positions where they will, essentially, kill themselves.

In his first appearance, Faustus induced nightmares and hallucinations in [[Captain America]] (Steve Rogers) in an attempt to drive him insane.  However, he was easily bested in a physical confrontation.<ref>''[[Captain America]]'' #107 (Nov 1968)</ref> It was later revealed that he had been treating the amnesiac [[Peggy Carter]], and captured Sharon Carter and Sharon's parents in an attempt to destroy Captain America.<ref>''Captain America'' #161-162 (Mayâ€“June 1973)</ref> Faustus then acquired stolen weapons from Stark International with which he planned to threaten New York City, and organized a private flight of American criminals; however this plan was thwarted by Captain America.<ref>''Captain America'' #192 (Dec 1975)</ref>

Faustus was briefly able to control [[Spider-Man]] and use him in an attempt to introduce a "psychogenic additive" to a flu vaccine (which would permit hypnotic control of the public), but he was defeated.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #170 (July 1977)</ref>

Faustus was the mastermind behind the neo-Nazi group [[National Force]], directing them behind the scenes.  He was responsible for the creation of the [[Grand Director]] to lead the National Force, as well as brainwashing [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Agent Sharon Carter and programming Sharon to commit suicide (though Carter survived). Faustus also temporarily brainwashed Captain America and battled Cap and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]. His legs were injured by falling gas canisters during this confrontation.<ref>''Captain America'' #232-236 (Apr-May 1979)</ref>

Faustus later mentally conditioned [[Everyman (Marvel Comics)|Everyman]] to be his operative, later known as Zeitgeist.  He used his absorbascan to draw in psychic power from other people in an attempt to mentally defeat [[Mister Fantastic]] and prove his worth to the [[Secret Empire]]. Everyman subsequently battled [[Spider-Man]] and Mister Fantastic, using a ray to temporarily deprive Reed Richards of his intellect, but the two heroes were nevertheless able to prevail and restore Richards to normal after convincing Everyman that the absorbascan was weakening the people he was drawing energy from rather than simply linking him to them in a benevolent bond. When Richards subsequently sought Everyman's backer, Faustus attempted to drive him to die of despair by making it appear that he had killed the rest of the Fantastic Four using elaborate androids. The plan was to culminate in Faustus shooting Richards, reasoning that, by this point, Richards would be so broken that even a conventional bullet would kill him as he would ''want'' to die. However, Richards realized the true natures of Faustus's androids through various flaws and defeated his plan, apparently causing the psychiatrist- who had already been talking with a hallucination of his deceased mother throughout this scheme- to have a breakdown.<ref>''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #132-133 (Aug-Sep 1983)</ref>

Having recovered from his breakdown, Faustus then allied with the [[Red Skull]], and occupied the villain's mansion. Faustus attempted to coerce Captain America into committing suicide through the use of ghostly holograms.<ref>''Captain America'' #326 (Feb 1987)</ref>

Faustus is also known for his involvement with the villain and future [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] member [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

He was presumed dead for a number of years, but reappeared again, now living undercover as a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] psychiatrist, and in the employ of the [[Red Skull]].  Faustus is tasked with manipulating [[Sharon Carter]], and claims responsibility for Sharon's increasing romantic attachment to Captain America.<ref>''Captain America'' (v5) #22 (Nov 2006)</ref> Faustus is responsible for manipulating Sharon Carter into assassinating Captain America while she escorts him from the courtroom.<ref>''Captain America'' #25 (Apr 2007)</ref>  It is further revealed that the [[Grand Director|Captain America]] from the 1950s remained alive in Faustus' possession, recuperating slowly, and he is reconditioned and sent against the new [[Bucky Barnes|Captain America]] (Bucky Barnes). The failure of this attack, and the ever-increasing vituperation of Red Skull and [[Armin Zola]] towards Faustus, causes him to withdraw from the project, but not before freeing Sharon and giving crucial information about Red Skull's plans to SHIELD.<ref>''Captain America (v.5) #40-41''</ref>

Some time later, [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] and [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]] apprehended Faustus, agreeing to testify in Bucky's current trial as the Winter Soldier as an expert in both mind control and Winter Soldier's history in exchange for a presidential pardon. Steve Rogers subtly threatens him into accepting the official release of his role in thwarting Red Skull's recent plans - thus encouraging judges to show him leniency in later cases - or Rogers would destroy that information and publicize the rest of his role in the assassination attempt.<ref>''Captain America'' #612</ref> Forced to accept this deal, Faustus provides testimony in the trial, even subtly manipulating the prosecuting lawyer into attacking the judge to prove how overwhelming mind-control can be.{{issue|date=June 2014}}

Faustus is later revealed to have established a [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] cell (disguised as a [[Gentrification|gentrifying]] corporation called Hope Yards Development Relocation Association) in New Jersey, which he attempts to take over using energy drinks and aerosol sprays that are laced with mind controlling nanomachines.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = G.
