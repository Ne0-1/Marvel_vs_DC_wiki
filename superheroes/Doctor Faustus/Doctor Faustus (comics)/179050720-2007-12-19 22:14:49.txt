'''Doctor Faustus''' ('''Johann Fennhoff''') is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain]]. 

==Fictional character biography==
He has proclaimed himself the "Master of Mens' Minds," and is known for the use of psychological methods of combat. An [[Austrians|Austrian]] by birth, he is most commonly associated with [[Captain America]], first appearing in issue #107 of his first series, where he attempted to drive Captain America insane. As a criminal psychologist, he was the mastermind behind the National Force.  His plots typically involve manipulating his foes into positions where they will, essentially, kill themselves.

Notable events in his history as a Captain America foe include his being responsible for the creation of the villain known as the [[Grand Director]] and the [[National Force]], his involvement with the villain and future [[Thunderbolt (comics)|Thunderbolt]] [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]], and the seeming death of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Agent [[Sharon Carter]] in the course of one of his schemes (Carter was later revealed to have survived).  As with many of Captain America's enemies, he has at times been allied with the [[Red Skull]].  

He was presumed dead for a number of years, but reappeared again, now living undercover as a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] psychologist, and in the employ of the [[Red Skull]].<ref>''[[Captain America]]'' (v5) #22</ref>  Faustus is tasked with manipulating [[Sharon Carter]], and claims responsibility for Carter's increasing romantic attachment to Captain America.

Faustus is revealed to be responsible for manipulating Sharon Carter into assassinating Captain America.<ref>''Captain America'' #25</ref>
