'''Doctor Faustus''' ('''Johann Fennhoff''') is a fictional character, a [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain]].

An [[Austrians|Austrian]] by birth, he is most commonly associated with [[Captain America]], first appearing in issue #107 of his first series.

==Creative origins==
*Faustus' name comes from the [[Faust|famous character]] of [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s Renaissance play ''[[The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus]]'' about a man who sold his soul to [[Lucifer]] in exchange for 24 years of service from a devil called [[Mephistophiles]] in order to gain all knowledge. This character predates the Christopher Marlowe play, in the legend built around the real-life [[Johann Georg Faust]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

==Fictional character biography==
Johann Fennhoff was born in [[Vienna]], Austria. He became a psychiatrist and criminal mastermind. He has proclaimed himself the "Master of Mens' Minds," and is known for the use of psychological methods of combat. His plots typically involve manipulating his foes into positions where they will, essentially, kill themselves.

In his first appearance, Faustus induced nightmares and hallucinations in [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]] in an attempt to drive him insane.  However, he was easily bested in a physical confrontation.<ref>''[[Captain America]]'' #107 (Nov 1968)</ref> It was later revealed that he had been treating the amnesiac [[Peggy Carter]], and captured [[Sharon Carter]] and her parents in an attempt to destroy Captain America.<ref>''Captain America'' #161-162 (May-June 1973)</ref> Faustus then acquired stolen weapons from Stark International with which he planned to threaten New York City, and organized a private flight of American criminals; however this plan was thwarted by Captain America.<ref>''Captain America'' #192 (Dec 1975)</ref>

Faustus was briefly able to control [[Spider-Man]] and use him in an attempt to introduce a "psychogenic additive" to a flu vaccine (which would permit hypnotic control of the public), but he was defeated.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #170 (July 1977)</ref>

Faustus was the mastermind behind the neo-Nazi group [[National Force]], directing them behind the scenes.  He was responsible for the creation of the villain known as the [[Grand Director]] to lead the National Force, as well as brainwashing [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Agent [[Sharon Carter]] and programming her to commit suicide (though Carter survived). Faustus also temporarily brainwashed Captain America and battled Cap and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]. His legs were injured by falling gas canisters during this confrontation.<ref>''Captain America'' #232-236 (Apr-May 1979)</ref>

Faustus later mentally conditioned [[Everyman (Marvel Comics)|Everyman]] to be his operative, later known as '''Zeitgeist'''.  He used his absorbascan to draw in psychic power from other people in an attempt to mentally defeat [[Mister Fantastic]] and prove his worth to the [[Secret Empire]]. Everyman subsequently battled [[Spider-Man]] and Mister Fantastic, using a ray to temporarily deprive Reed Richards of his intellect, but the two heroes were nevertheless able to prevail and restore Richards to normal. When Richards subsequently sought Everyman's backer, Faustus attempted to drive him to die of despair by making it appear that he had killed the rest of the Fantastic Four using elaborate androids, but Richards realized their true natures and defeated Faustus's plan, apparently causing the psychiatrist to have a breakdown.<ref>''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #132-133 (Aug-Sep 1983)</ref>

Faustus then allied with the [[Red Skull]], and occupied the Skull's mansion.  Faustus attempted to coerce Captain America into committing suicide through the use of ghostly holograms.<ref>''Captain America'' #326 (Feb 1987)</ref>

Faustus is also known for his involvement with the villain and future [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] member, [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

He was presumed dead for a number of years, but reappeared again, now living undercover as a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] psychiatrist, and in the employ of the [[Red Skull]].  Faustus is tasked with manipulating [[Sharon Carter]], and claims responsibility for Carter's increasing romantic attachment to Captain America.<ref>''Captain America'' (v5) #22 (Nov 2006)</ref> Faustus is responsible for manipulating Sharon Carter into assassinating Captain America.<ref>''Captain America'' #25 (Apr 2007)</ref>  It is further revealed that the [[Grand Director|Captain America]] from the 1950s remained alive in Faustus' possession, recuperating slowly, and he is reconditioned and sent against the new Captain America, James Barnes. The failure of this attack, and the ever-increasing vituperation of the Skull and Zola towards Faustus, causes him to withdraw from the project, but not before freeing Sharon Carter and giving crucial information about the Skull's plans to SHIELD.<ref>''Captain America (v.5) #40-41''</ref>

Some time later, Falcon and Black Widow apprehended Faustus.<ref>''Captain America'' #612</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Faustus has no superhuman powers but has a genius intellect, and is extremely charismatic and can modulate his voice in a highly persuasive manner. He has a doctorate in psychiatry.

Faustus regularly employs hologram projectors, hallucinogenic gas dispensers, androids, and elaborate props. He also hires henchmen to impersonate various people as a part of his scheme to affect his victims' minds.

Faustus has suffered extensive leg injuries, forcing him to use a cane or wheelchair for mobility. He can stand or walk without assistance for only a brief time.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}
