'''Nightshade''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]]ine who was owned and published by [[Charlton Comics]] and was later acquired by [[DC Comics]].  Once integrated into the [[DC Universe]] in ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', she became affiliated with the [[Suicide Squad]].  There, it was revealed that her powers came from an other-dimensional [[demon]], the sibling of which had empowered Nightshade's teammate, the insane [[Enchantress (DC Comics)|Enchantress]].  The twin demons were destroyed, causing the Enchantress to temporarily lose her powers; Nightshade was unaffected, although she did soon resign herself a new costume.

Nightshade's powers consist of manipulating darkness to her advantage.  She can also [[teleport]], possibly by accessing the dark dimension from which the demon had drawn its power.

The [[Silk Spectre]] in ''[[Watchmen]]'' was based on Nightshade.
