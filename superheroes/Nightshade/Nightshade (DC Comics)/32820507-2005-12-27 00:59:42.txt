'''Nightshade''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]]ine who was owned and published by [[Charlton Comics]] and was later acquired by [[DC Comics]].  

==Charlton Comics==
Nightshade was first introduced in [[Captain Atom]] #82, as a partner for Captain Atom.
Her real name is Eve Eden. Her father is a U.S [[senator]]. She is blonde (unusual for a heroine with darkness-based powers) and wears a black wig as Nightshade. She was romantically involved with [[Captain Atom]] for a brief time.  

She appeared several times in the main Captain Atom stories, before getting her own backup series in the last 3 published issues (#87-89).  She also appeared in the last unpublished Captain Atom story that appeared in the [[Charlton Bullseye]] fanzine. In this series (with art by [[Jim Aparo]]), we learn that Tiger ([[Judomaster]]'s now grown up sidekick), is her martial arts instructor.  We would also learn the source of her powers.  Her mother, Magda, was actually a visitor from another dimension, where they have the ability to transform into living 2-dimension shadows.  These powers she passed on to her son and daughter.  On a visit to this dimension, Magda and her children are attacked.  Mortally wounded, Magda is able to transport her and Eve back to Earth.  Eve promised to return and find her brother.  This never occurs during the Charlton years. 

In 1981, Nightshade would appear in issue #7 of the new [[Charlton Bullseye]] comic. Her last "Charlton" appearance would be in a story that teamed up all the Charlton "Action Heroes", and be published in a one-shot by [[AC Comics]].

==DC Comics==

Once integrated into the [[DC Universe]] in ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', she became affiliated with the [[Suicide Squad]].  There, it was revealed that her powers came from an other-dimensional [[demon]], the sibling of which had empowered Nightshade's teammate, the insane [[Enchantress (DC Comics)|Enchantress]].  The twin demons were destroyed, causing the Enchantress to temporarily lose her powers; Nightshade was unaffected, although she did soon design herself a new costume.

Nightshade's powers consist of manipulating darkness to her advantage.  She can also [[teleport]], possibly by accessing the dark dimension from which the demon had drawn its power.

Nightshade would also be part of the L.A.W. mini-series, which would reunite all the Charlton Action Heroes owned by DC.

She was briefly shown in flashbacks in [[Alex Ross]] and [[Mark Waid]]'s comic ''[[Kingdom Come (comic)|Kingdom Come]]'' as a member of Magog's Justice Battalion, along with the rest of the Charlton 'Action Heroes'.  She was apparently killed with the other members when [[Captain Atom]] was killed.

Nightshade has most recently re-emerged as a member of the [[Shadowpact]] in the ''[[Day of Vengeance]]'' miniseries.  She has been paired with [[the Detective Chimp]], resulting in some good-natured bickering.

The [[Silk Spectre]] in ''[[Watchmen]]'' is often said to be based on Nightshade, much as many other heroes in that work are based on her fellow [[Charlton Action Heroes]].  However, [[Alan Moore]] has stated that he found Nightshade "boring," and that Silk Spectre was modeled on sexier characters such as the [[Phantom Lady]] and [[Black Canary]].

==Other Nightshades==

An enemy of the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] [[Sandman (comics)|Sandman]] was named Nightshade. Upon his revival in the [[1980s]] series [[All-Star Squadron]], he was renamed "Ramulus" to avoid confusion with the Eve Eden character.
Two female characters in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel Universe|universe]] are named Nightshade.  One is an [[African American]] [[biochemistry]]-themed [[supervillain]] who has fought [[Luke Cage]], [[Captain America]], and the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]].  The other is a member of [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Imperial Guard (comics)|Imperial Guard]], who is their analogue of [[Shadow Lass]] of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]; her name was later changed to Nightside to avoid confusion with the other Marvel character.
