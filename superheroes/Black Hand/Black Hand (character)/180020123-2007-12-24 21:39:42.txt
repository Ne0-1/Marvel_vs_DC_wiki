'''Black Hand''' (real name '''William Hand''') is a [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]] and a recurring foe to [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]]. He first appeared in ''Green Lantern'' vol. 2 #29 (June 1964) and was created by [[John Broome (writer)|John Broome]] and [[Gil Kane]].

==Fictional character biography==
The man who would one day be known as Black Hand was born an inventive genius, with a penchant for speaking in hoary old clich√©s. His most noteworthy invention however turned out to be a device that can absorb the residue of a Green Lantern power ring's energy from any object that it has touched. As the costumed Black Hand he used this device for crime and the collected residual energy as well. This energy can then be used much the same way as a Green Lantern Ring. In addition to Green Lantern Hal Jordan, Black Hand has also battled [[Kilowog]] and the second [[Flash (comics)|Flash]], [[Barry Allen]].

For a while he retired from a life of crime and attempted to run a legitimate business, in the form of a massage parlor. This new lease on life came to an abrupt end when it was interrupted by the then-powerless [[Guy Gardner]]. This experience left him psychologically and emotionally scarred. One late night, while suffering from depression, he had a chance meeting with several superheroes,(G'Nort, [[Martian Manhunter]] and [[Kilowog]]). Witnessing the assembled heroes meeting at an exclusive skyscraper restaurant, this further caused his deteriorating psyche to break and he had a screaming panic attack.

Shortly before [[Green Lantern: Rebirth|Hal Jordan's resurrection]] his device tracked a spare [[Power Ring]], held by [[Green Arrow]] in case of emergency. He tried to claim the ring for himself, but was stopped by Green Arrow, who pinned his hand to the wall. Hal Jordan, now the Spectre, burnt his hand away, stating that now "he can live up to his name".

Black Hand, now missing his right hand and driven insane from the trauma, fled. Later, hearing of Hal Jordan's resurrection he decided to live in the rebuilt [[Coast City]] to stay close to his foe. While on board an airplane, he was targeted and abducted by a race of mysterious [[deutsch]]-speaking aliens, akin to the [[gremlin]]s of myth. They performed experiments that enhanced his power, and ultimately abandoned him in a public park.

The experiments granted Black Hand the ability to consume the life-force of the living to create a new hand for himself. The amount of life-force he consumes relates to the amount of time he can control the limb. As a side effect, he assumes a [[zombie]]-like, decaying appearance.

It has been implied recently that [[Grayson Frisby]], a millionaire ruined by the [[Green Lantern]], may take up the moniker and duty of the Black Hand.

In the Green Lantern #25 (2007), there is a preview of the upcoming "Blackest Night" story arc. A cloud of black power rings displaying the Black Hand's insignia descend on Earth, re-animating the dead.
