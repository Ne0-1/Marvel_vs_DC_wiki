==Fictional character biography==
Bird-Brain was one of a number of "Ani-Mates", creatures created by an insane geneticist named the [[Ani-Mator]], combining the characteristics of human beings and other animals.  The Ani-Mator subjected his creations to a number of cruel and deadly experiments, but Bird-Brain escaped the Ani-Mator's island and befriended the [[New Mutants]]. They tried to acclimate him to regular society, which failed miserably time and again, mainly because Bird-Brain would eat all the food he saw.<ref name="movie incident">''New Mutants'' vol.1 #57</ref> For the most part, Bird-Brain was unable to communicate with the New Mutants, despite the language powers of the New Mutant named [[Cypher (comics)|Cypher]] AKA Doug Ramsey. This was mostly because of how difficult Bird-Brain's language is.<ref name="movie incident"/>  In his first conversation with Cypher, Bird-Brain explained that he had been trained with food by starving him and using food as a reward.<ref name="movie incident"/>

Bird-Brain developed relatively close relationships with Cypher (who was fascinated by Bird-Brain's language) and [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]] for her changeling ability, through which he saw her as a kindred spirit, and her general kindness to him.<ref name="language learning">''New Mutants'' vol.1 #58</ref> Feeling he had abandoned the other mutated creatures on the island, Bird-Brain eventually returned with the New Mutants to free them.<ref name="language learning"/>  The Ani-Mator, attempting to shoot Wolfsbane, instead killed Cypher, and [[Magik (comics)|Magik]] exiled the Ani-Mator to the dimension of [[Otherplace|Limbo]] in retailiation.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol.1 #60</ref>  Once freed from the Ani-Mator's tyranny, Bird-Brain decided to remain on the island with the other Ani-Mates.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol.1 #61</ref>
