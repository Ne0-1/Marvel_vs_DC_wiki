==Fictional character biography==
Bird-Brain was one of a number of "Ani-Mates", creatures created by an insane geneticist named the [[Ani-Mator]], combining the characteristics of human beings and other animals.  The Ani-Mator subjected his creations to a number of cruel and deadly experiments, but Bird-Brain escaped the Ani-Mator's island and befriended the [[New Mutants]]. They tried to acclimate him to regular society, which failed miserably time and again. Mainly because Bird-Brain would eat all the food he saw. Some of the New Mutants theorized that he had been mistreated and that food was a reward for being good. For a while, Bird-Brain was unable to communicate, despite the language powers of the New Mutant named [[Cypher (comics)|Cypher]] AKA Doug Ramsey. This was mostly because of Doug being jealous of the attention [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]] was paying to Bird-Brain. Examples, such as Bird-Brain's sense of humour, failed to sway him at first.

When Doug finally agreed to translate Bird-Brain's language, they learned of his history and the other mutated creatures on the island.  The New Mutants returned to the island with Bird-Brain to stop the mad scientist's experiments.  The Ani-Mator, attempting to shoot Wolfsbane, instead killed Cypher.  [[Magik (comics)|Magik]] exiled the Ani-Mator to the dimension of [[Otherplace|Limbo]] in retailiation.  Once freed from the Ani-Mator's tyranny, Bird-Brain decided to remain on the island with the other Ani-Mates.
