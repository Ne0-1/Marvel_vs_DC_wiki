'''The Comedian''' ('''Edward Blake''') is a fictional character, a [[superhero]] featured in the acclaimed 1986 [[DC Comics]] series ''[[Watchmen]].'' 

The Comedian is a [[cigar]]-chomping, gun-toting [[vigilante]]-turned-[[paramilitary]] agent. He has touted some [[Right-wing politics|right wing]], ultra-patriotic views but, during some of the series' most intense moments, has shown himself to be a [[nihilist]] with little regard for [[morality]] or human life. He is also the father of Laurie Juspeczyk, the second Silk Spectre, which proves to be a crucial plot revelation. 

He was created by ''Watchmen'' writer [[Alan Moore]] and illustrator [[Dave Gibbons]], although, like all characters in the series, he was based on a [[Charlton Comics]] character, in this case [[Peacemaker (comics)|Peacemaker]], created by writer [[Joe Gill]] and artist [[Pat Boyette]]. Moore also based him on [[G. Gordon Liddy]]. [http://www.ew.com/ew/report/0,6115,1120854-6-6_1||233612|1_,00.html]

His alter-ego of Edward Blake is a play on the name of movie director [[Blake Edwards]], best known for [[the Pink Panther]] comedies. His character design is said to have been based on actor [[Burt Reynolds]].

==Involvement in ''Watchmen''==
{{spoiler}}
The story of ''Watchmen'' starts with the aftermath of a murder in [[1985]]: a man named Edward Blake was beaten mercilessly and thrown through the window of his apartment, falling several stories to his death. A "costumed adventurer" named [[Rorschach (comics)|Rorschach]] begins independently investigating the murder. While searching Blake's apartment, Rorschach discovers a hidden closet containing a costume and other items that indicate that the murdered man was The Comedian. The main plot of ''Watchmen'' initially involves Rorschach's suspicion of a plot to kill costumed heroes; his continuing investigation into Blake's murder leads to a much larger, more horrifying secret. The Comedian never appears alive in ''Watchmen'' (the first issue begins the morning after his death), but is seen several times in memories of other characters shown as [[flashback (literary technique)|flashback]]s.

==Fictional character history==
The Comedian was born in [[1924]] as Edward Morgan Blake. When he first became a costumed adventurer in [[1939]], he dressed in a [[clown]]like costume with a simple domino mask. An effective and brutal [[vigilante]], Blake managed to expunge most [[organized crime]] from the [[New York City|New York]] harbor. He became a member of The Minutemen, a prominent group of heroes, of which he was the youngest member. After a meeting, however, he [[sexual assault|sexually assaulted]] fellow Minuteman [[Silk Spectre]] (who was about three years older than him and whom he seemed prone to flirting with); she was spared only when another Minuteman, Hooded Justice interrupted the assault and beat Blake, breaking his nose. The Comedian was expelled from the group - but Silk Spectre's agent persuaded her not to press charges against him for fear of what it would do the group's image - and continued to work on his own, although his self-restraint continued to slip. He would later have another encounter with Silk Spectre, and the second time around, he impregnated her with her daughter and successor, Laurie, but it is not entirely clear if he knew she was his daughter or not. While never explicitly talked about, the second sexual encounter between the Comedian and the first Silk Spectre is said to be consensual, and at the end of Watchmen it is implied that, in spite of everything, the first Silk Spectre had feelings for the Comedian. 

In the [[1940s]], Blake updated his Comedian uniform, after being stabbed by a small-time hood. He adopted a leather outfit that served as light [[body armor]], adorned with short star-and-stripe-themed sleeves and a small [[smiley|happy face]] button. He retained the small domino mask and began carrying a pistol. He fought in [[World War II]], becoming a war hero in the [[Pacific theater]]. It is also implied, but not directly stated, that he murdered Hooded Justice in revenge for the beating he suffered. By the late [[1960s]], Blake had begun working as a covert government operative. Hollis Mason, the original [[Nite-Owl]], had published his autobiography ''Under the Hood'' by this point and he disclosed the Comedian's sexual assault on Sally Jupiter/Silk Spectre, but Blake never sued him for it, interestingly enough. In 1966, he was invited to join the Crimebuster by [[Captain Metropolis]], but he quickly ruined the older hero's hope of a new team by mocking him, claiming he was only doing it for vanity and glory, and even set his display on fire while saying that old fashioned crime fighting methods were not useful for saving the world when the threat of nuclear war lay overhead at all times. It was also here that the Comedian met his daughter, Laurie, now the new Silk Spectre, and asked her if her mother ever talked about him while lighting a cigarette for her, but their conversation was quickly broken up by an angry Sally Jupiter; the Comedian seemed genuinely perplexed that Sally was still holding a grudge against him, saying he thought they had settled their differences, and Laurie noted that the Comedian looked sad as he watched them drive away, and felt sorry for him until her mother told her of their past history (but still not telling Laurie that she was his daughter), after which she felt nothing but disgust and hatred towards him. Alongside [[Doctor Manhattan]], The Comedian played a major role in the United States' war with [[Vietnam]]. Shortly after Manhattan's godlike powers forced the north Vietnamese into full surrender, Blake was confronted by a woman he had made [[pregnant]]. He told her bluntly that he planned to leave the country immediately without her, and in a rage she slashed his face with a broken bottle. Blake shot and killed her. His injury led to a disfiguring scar that ran from his right eye down to the corner of his mouth; after this incident, he wore an enclosing leather [[gimp (sadomasochism)|gimp]]-style mask when dressed as The Comedian.

The costumed adventurers faced a massive backlash and rioting in the 1970s; in response, Congress passed the Keene Act, requiring all heroes to register with the government if they wished to remain active. The majority of them "retired" in anonymity; a few, like [[Ozymandias (comics)|Ozymandias]], publicly revealed their identities and capitalized on the sudden fame, while others, such as Rorschach, continued their activities in open defiance of the law. Doctor Manhattan and The Comedian were two of the few who registered with, and were employed by, the government.

==Government-sponsored activity==
It is strongly implied that Blake killed [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Carl Bernstein]] before they could reveal the details of the [[Watergate scandal]]. In the series' alternate reality, [[Richard Nixon]] enjoyed unprecedented popularity and was able to serve four terms as [[President of the United States|President]] after a constitutional amendment. Blake was in [[Dallas, Texas]], nominally as Nixon's bodyguard, on the day that [[John F. Kennedy]] was shot; it is also implied, although vaguely, that Blake either was the actual assassin or knew of the [[Lee Harvey Oswald|assassin's]] plot beforehand. The [[Iran hostage crisis]] in [[1980]] was resolved when Blake freed the captives after an assault.

==Death & Legacy==
While on a plane during a mission in [[1985]], Blake noticed suspicious activity on an uncharted island. He investigated and discovered that Adrian Veidt, also known as [[Ozymandias (comics)|Ozymandias]], owned the island; he also learned details of Veidt's plan to end the [[Cold War]] and unite humanity through a horrific hoax. Unable to bear the burden of knowledge alone, Blake broke into the apartment of Edgar Jacobi, who had fought Blake years earlier as [[Moloch (comics)|Moloch]], and rambled drunkenly about the island. Veidt had bugged Moloch's house earlier and after learning of Blake's newfound knowledge, subsequently killed both Blake and Jacobi to keep his plan secret.

While trying to convince Doctor Manhattan to save the Earth from nuclear war, Laurie came to the horrifying realization that the Comedian was her father. This revelation provoked an unexpected emotional response in the superhuman Manhattan, who was stunned that two people as different as the Comedian and Sally Jupiter could come together and produce a child, and that child being Laurie, he realized that such odds of improbability extended to all members of the human race. This encouraged Manhattan that human life was worth saving and, later, gave Laurie a chance to reconcile with her mother.

==Powers and abilities==
Edward Blake was a skilled hand-to-hand combatant in excellent physical condition. His simple, street-wise fighting style was very effective. In the "Under the Hood" excerpts it is revealed that the Comedian bested [[Ozymandias (comics)|Ozymandias]] in their first encounter - a slight that Veidt never got over. Never depicted as an "expert" marksman per se, Blake was proficient with a .45 pistol and pump-action shotgun. His participation in World War II and Vietnam suggest that was skilled in military tactics. His government-sanctioned activities suggest that he was very talented in or received training in covert operations and unconventional warfare. It is implied that he was a "Black-Ops/CIA" type agent during the 1960s and 1970s. Blake was fairly slight when he was introduced as a member of the Minutemen, but his physical stature increased over the years, which could be attributed to the fact that he was only a teenager at the time he served with the group. At the time of his death Blake was quite tall and had a very built physique. The fact that Blake could still swim long distances well into retirement suggests that he was still in good shape.  Although Veidt was able to overpower and kill Blake in an ambush where Blake was thrown out a window, Blake was apparently drunk at the time, while Veidt's physical abilities appear to have dramatically increased over the time since their last fight. Veidt's use of physical force, instead of a weapon, can be seen as revenge for Blake defeating Veidt many years before.

==Analysis==
The Comedian was essentially a [[nihilism|nihilist]]. He appears to lack any moral values or clear ethical code, as is evident in his actions in [[Vietnam war|Vietnam]], and often appears to be driven by personal whims.  Doctor Manhattan says of him: "I have never met anyone so deliberately amoral."  Ozymandias says of the Comedian: "The man was practically a Nazi." He constantly says life is simply a joke, and he's just playing along because he is the only person who realizes what the joke is.  

Rorschach, who seems to admire the Comedian for his ruthless tactics and refusal to back down from the horrors of the world, muses during the course of the story that The Comedian was actually satirising the numerous immoralities of society with his apparently sociopathic behavior. The Comedian's anti-social behavior is furthermore often used to bring to light the hypocrisy of other characters in the series; when he interrupts Captain Metropolis's meeting of the Crime Busters, he accuses the aging superhero of wanting to play "dress up", and sets fire to a map Captain Metropolis had displayed of America's "social ills", a close up of the burning map reveals such problems as "Student Protests" and "Colored Unrest". After the incident in Vietnam, as the Comedian stumbles away from the body of the woman he had just shot, Dr. Manhattan begins to condemn his action only to be interrupted as the Comedian points out that the seemingly all-powerful man could have easily prevented anybody from being harmed but "didn't lift a finger". He even accuses Manhattan of having no interest or concern for the human race, including his lovers Janey Slater and the second Silk Spectre

Despite his seeming amorality, the Comedian did react with stunned disbelief and horror when, shortly before his death, he stumbled across a plan for mass murder, which Ozymandias attributed to "professional jealousy". This suggests that even he has his limits, and there are some things even the Comedian doesn't find funny. Some might interpret it as meaning that beneath his sadistic exterior, he may have actually cared for others, and in his own mind his actions in World War II and Vietnam were justified because he was serving his country, thus serving a utilitarian effort. When he breaks down in front of Moloch, he admits that he did horrible things (among them attacking women and shooting at kids in Vietnam) and asks for forgiveness. What made the Comedian into the person he was is never revealed, therefore it can only be assumed that his antisocial behavior and deranged sense of humor was his way of coping with the brutal environment he lived in. Human beings are known to use humor as a coping mechanism, which the Comedian takes to a dangerous extent, and learning of Ozymandias's plan may have simply pushed him beyond his limit.

The nature of the Comedian's relationship with Sally Jupiter, the first Silk Spectre, is never clearly defined. He was obviously attracted to Sally for her beauty, and it can only be assumed that, in a strange way, Sally found the Comedian's brutal, action driven personality appealing, and she may have been drawn to him for the powerful physicality he developed years later. When it came to when he impregnated her with Laurie, Sally mentions it was an afternoon in summer when he came by, she tried to be angry with him, but somehow things didn't turn out how she expected. He remains fairly calm when the enraged Sally Jupiter is shouting at him after he was talking to Laurie, and Laurie's recount that he looked saddened by Sally's outburst could be interpretted that he may have actually harbored feelings for her, just as the ending of '''Watchmen''' implied that Sally had feelings for him. Laurie's flashback of overhearing Sally arguing with her first husband, Laurence Schexnayder, she hears bits and pieces of Sally revealing what happened when she had her second sexually charged encounter with the Comedian, she says that she ''"shouted at him, he looked surprised, couldn't imagine why I'd bear a grudge. See, it's different for him..."'' and when she recalled the consummation, she says ''"First off, he was there, right? Plus, he was gentle. You know what gentleness means in a guy like that? Even a glimmer of it? It means you reached something. It means you reached some of that magical romance and bullshit they promise you when you're a kid..."'' When Laurie confronts the Comedian a second time in 1973 at a dinner held in his honor, the drunken Laurie brings up his attempted rape in front of men who are congratulating him, demanding to know what kind of man he is, forcing a woman, any woman, to have sex against her will, the Comedian blankly replies "Only once."

==The "Smile"==
Throughout the work, the Comedian is typically seen wearing or in close proximity to the "smiley-face" button which is closely associated with him. However, the smile is constantly appearing when Blake is not present, possibly at important junctures in the story. Some examples of the button's appearance are as follows.

* The story begins with an extreme close-up of the stained button. The same button physically appears in Dreiberg's house, as well as atop a prominent restaurant and at the Comedian's funeral.
* While Dr. Manhattan is reminiscing of Blake's activities in Vietnam, the smile makes its first chronological appearance. When Blake is slashed by the broken bottle brandished by the mother of his unborn, illegitimate child, blood falls upon the button and simulates the pattern.
* When the murder of two children by their war-obsessed father is investigated by the recurring "detective" characters, the religious poster on the back of the door is spattered with blood. The colours and shapes reference the Comedian's button.
* After rescuing innocent victims from a tenement fire, the Owlship occupied by Nite Owl and the second Silk Spectre is shown flying against the yellow moon, with smoke rising up on one side. The ship's portholes are the eyes, while the smoke is the blood spatter.
* When Hollis Mason is killed, the blood smeared across his face in his Minutemen photo is similar to the stain on the button.
* When Dr. Manhattan's "flying clockwork" is destroyed on Mars, the pattern of debris on the large crater is reminiscent of the smile.
* While not an appearance per se, there is a clear patch on the side of Veidt's Vivarium, shown on the cover of one issue. This clear patch is a perfect replica of the shape of the button's blood spatter.
* After Veidt teleports his creature into New York, the stained socket on a half-destroyed spark hydrant in front of the Institute for Extraspatial Studies references the smile.
* While Adrian Veidt explains his role in the death of Blake, his face shortly before killing the man is shown splattered with blood on one side. Since his face appears yellow at the time, this is a clear reference.
* In the very last panel, the New Frontiersman employee known as Seymour, who habitually wears a green T-shirt with a yellow smiley face, drips ketchup on his stomach from a burger he is eating. This mimicks the smile almost perfectly, and brings the story to a circle.
