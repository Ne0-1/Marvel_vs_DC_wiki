'''The Comedian''' ('''Edward Blake''') is a fictional character, a [[superhero]] featured in the acclaimed 1986 [[DC Comics]] series ''[[Watchmen]].'' 

==Character Background==
The Comedian is a [[cigar]]-chomping, gun-toting [[vigilante]]-turned-[[paramilitary]] agent. During some of the series' most intense moments, he has shown himself to be a [[moral nihilism|nihilist]] with little regard for [[morality]] or human life. It may even be possible that, because no motivation is ever stated, he only fights crime as an excuse to please a sadistic desire to commit violent acts.

He was created by ''Watchmen'' writer [[Alan Moore]] and illustrator [[Dave Gibbons]], although, like all characters in the series, he was based on a [[Charlton Comics]] character, in this case [[Peacemaker (comics)|Peacemaker]], created by writer [[Joe Gill]] and artist [[Pat Boyette]].

Moore also loosely based him on [[G. Gordon Liddy]], although Liddy himself appears a few times in ''Watchmen'' as a separate character: at a banquet in Blake's honour he is mentioned in the text and laughs at Blake's reference to the [[John F. Kennedy assassination|Kennedy Assassination]] (Chapter 9, page 20); he also appears when still-President Nixon arrives at [[Cheyenne Mountain|NORAD]] (Chapter 10, page 3).

The Comedian's alter-ego of Edward Blake is a play on the name of movie director [[Blake Edwards]], {{Fact|date=March 2007}} best known for [[the Pink Panther]] comedies. His character design is said to have been based on actor [[Burt Reynolds]]. {{Fact|date=March 2007}}

==Involvement in ''Watchmen''==
The story of ''Watchmen'' starts with the aftermath of a murder in [[1985]]: a man named Edward Blake was beaten mercilessly and thrown through the window of his apartment, falling several stories to his death. A "costumed adventurer" named [[Rorschach (comics)|Rorschach]] begins independently investigating the murder. While searching Blake's apartment, Rorschach discovers a hidden closet containing a costume and other items that indicate that the murdered man was The Comedian. The main plot of ''Watchmen'' initially involves Rorschach's suspicion of a plot to kill costumed heroes ("masks"); his continuing investigation into Blake's murder leads to a much larger, more horrifying secret. The Comedian never appears alive in ''Watchmen'' (the first issue begins the morning after his murder), but is seen several times in memories of other characters shown as [[flashback (literary technique)|flashback]]s, as well as appearing in documents appended to the end of chapters (such as extracts from Hollis Mason's biography, "Under The Hood").

==Fictional character history==
The Comedian was born in 1924 as Edward Morgan Blake. When he first became a costumed adventurer in [[1939]], he dressed in a [[clown]]-like costume with a simple domino mask. An effective and brutal [[vigilante]], Blake managed to expunge most [[organized crime]] from the [[New York City|New York]] harbor. He became a member of The Minutemen, a prominent group of heroes, of which he was the youngest member. After a photography shoot, he [[sexual assault|sexually assaulted]] fellow Minuteman [[Silk Spectre]] (who was about three years older than him and whom he seemed prone to flirting with); she was spared only when another Minuteman, [[Hooded Justice]], interrupted the assault and beat Blake, breaking his nose. The Comedian was expelled from the group - but Silk Spectre's agent persuaded her not to press charges against him for fear of what it would do the group's image - and continued to work on his own, although his self-restraint continued to slip. He would later have another encounter with Silk Spectre, and the second time around, he impregnated her with her daughter and successor, Laurie. While never explicitly mentioned, the second sexual encounter between the Comedian and the first Silk Spectre is said to be consensual, and at the end of Watchmen it is implied that, in spite of everything, the first Silk Spectre had feelings for the Comedian. 

In the [[1940s]], Blake updated his Comedian uniform, after being stabbed by a small-time hood. He adopted a leather outfit that served as light [[body armor]], adorned with short star-and-stripe-themed sleeves and a small [[smiley|happy face]] button. He retained the small domino mask and began carrying a pistol. He fought in [[World War II]], becoming a war hero in the [[Pacific theater]]. It is also implied, but not directly stated, that he murdered Hooded Justice in revenge for the beating he suffered. By the late [[1960s]], Blake had begun working as a covert government operative. Hollis Mason, the original [[Nite-Owl]], had published his autobiography ''Under the Hood'' by this point and he disclosed the Comedian's sexual assault on Sally Jupiter/Silk Spectre, though Blake never sued the author. In 1966, he was invited to join the Crimebusters by [[Captain Metropolis]], but he quickly ruined the older hero's hope of a new team by mocking him, claiming he was only doing it for vanity and glory, and even set his display on fire while saying that old fashioned crime fighting methods were not useful for saving the world when the threat of nuclear war lay overhead at all times. It was also here that the Comedian met his daughter, Laurie, now the new Silk Spectre, and asked her if her mother ever talked about him while lighting a cigarette for her, but their conversation was quickly broken up by an angry Sally Jupiter. The Comedian seemed genuinely perplexed that Sally was still holding a grudge against him, saying he thought they had settled their differences, and Laurie noted that the Comedian looked sad as he watched them drive away, and felt sorry for him until her mother told her of their past history (but still not telling Laurie that she was his daughter), after which she felt nothing but disgust and hatred towards him. Alongside [[Doctor Manhattan]], The Comedian played a major role in the United States' war with [[Vietnam]]. Shortly after Manhattan's godlike powers forced the north Vietnamese into full surrender, Blake was confronted by a Vietnamese woman he had seemingly made [[pregnant]] (though this seems to be the most logical explanation and she seemed to care for him, it is never clearly stated that he was the father). He told her bluntly that he planned to leave the country immediately without her, and in a rage she slashed his face with a broken bottle. Blake shot and killed her. His injury led to a disfiguring scar that ran from his right eye down to the corner of his mouth; after this incident, he wore an enclosing leather [[gimp (sadomasochism)|gimp]]-style mask when dressed as The Comedian.

The costumed adventurers faced massive backlash and rioting in the 1970s; in response, Congress passed the Keene Act, requiring all heroes to register with the government if they wished to remain active. The majority of them "retired" in anonymity; a few, like [[Ozymandias (comics)|Ozymandias]], publicly revealed their identities and capitalized on the sudden fame, while others, such as Rorschach, continued their activities in open defiance of the law. Doctor Manhattan and The Comedian were two of the few who registered with, and were employed by, the government.

==Government-sponsored activity==
It is strongly implied that Blake killed [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Carl Bernstein]] before they could reveal the details of the [[Watergate scandal]]. In the series' alternate reality, [[Richard Nixon]] enjoyed unprecedented popularity and was able to serve five terms as [[President of the United States|President]] after a constitutional amendment. Blake was in [[Dallas, Texas]], nominally as Nixon's bodyguard, on the day that [[John F. Kennedy]] was shot; it is also implied, although vaguely, that Blake either was the actual assassin or knew of the [[Lee Harvey Oswald|assassin's]] plot beforehand. The [[Iran hostage crisis]] in 1980 was resolved when Blake freed the captives after an assault.

==Death & Legacy==
While on a plane during a mission in [[1985]], Blake noticed suspicious activity on an uncharted island. Unable to bear the burden of knowledge alone, Blake broke into the apartment of Edgar Jacobi, who had fought Blake years earlier as [[Moloch (comics)|Moloch]], and rambled drunkenly about the island.  Ozymandias, who was controlling the island's activity and had bugged Moloch's apartment for his own reasons, responded by personally murdering Blake, throwing him through Blake's apartment window so Blake would fall to his death.

While trying to convince Doctor Manhattan to save the Earth from nuclear war, Laurie came to the shocking realization that the Comedian was her father. This revelation provoked an unexpected emotional response in the superhuman Manhattan, who was stunned that two people as different as the Comedian and Sally Jupiter could come together and produce a child, and that child being Laurie, he realized that such odds of improbability extended to all members of the human race. This revelation encouraged Manhattan that human life was worth saving and, later, gave Laurie a chance to reconcile with her mother.

==Powers and abilities==
Edward Blake was a skilled hand-to-hand combatant in excellent physical condition, even at the time of his death at the age of 61. His simple, street-wise fighting style was very effective. In the "Under the Hood" excerpts it is revealed that the Comedian bested [[Ozymandias (comics)|Ozymandias]] in their first encounter - a slight that Veidt never got over. Never depicted as an "expert" marksman per se, Blake was proficient with a .45 pistol and pump-action shotgun. His participation in World War II and Vietnam suggest that he was skilled in military tactics. His government-sanctioned activities suggest that he was very talented in or received training in covert operations and unconventional warfare. It is implied that he was a "Black-Ops/CIA" type agent during the 1960s and 1970s. Blake was fairly slight when he was introduced as a member of the Minutemen, but his physical stature increased over the years, which could be attributed to the fact that he was only a teenager at the time he served with the group. At the time of his death, Blake was quite tall and had a very well-built physique.

==The "Smile"==
Throughout the work, the Comedian is typically seen wearing or in close proximity to the "smiley-face" button which is closely associated with him. However, the smile is constantly appearing when Blake is not present, possibly at important junctures in the story. Some examples of the button's appearance are as follows.

* The story begins with an extreme close-up of the stained button. The same button physically appears in Dreiberg's house, as well as atop a prominent restaurant and at the Comedian's funeral.
* While Dr. Manhattan is reminiscing of Blake's activities in Vietnam, the smile makes its first chronological appearance. When Blake is slashed by the broken bottle brandished by the mother of his unborn, illegitimate child, blood falls upon the button and simulates the pattern.
* When the murder of two children by their war-obsessed father is investigated by the recurring "detective" characters, the religious poster on the back of the door is spattered with blood. The colours and shapes reference the Comedian's button.
* After rescuing innocent victims from a tenement fire, the Owlship occupied by Nite Owl and the second Silk Spectre is shown flying against the yellow moon, with smoke rising up on one side. The ship's portholes are the eyes, while the smoke is the blood spatter.
* Halloween Night, Hollis Mason carves a Jack-O-Lantern which strongly resembles a smiley-face. A smattering of pumpkin pulp falls across the face of it, repeating the pattern.
* When Hollis Mason is killed, the blood smeared across his face in his Minutemen photo is similar to the stain on the button.
* When Dr. Manhattan's "flying clockwork" is destroyed on Mars, the pattern of debris on the Argyle Planitia's [[Galle (Martian crater)|Galle Crater]] (which itself resembles a smiley face) is reminiscent of the blood-spatter pattern.
* On the covert art of Chapter 10, the radar has two lines coming down to make the eyes, with the scanning beam making the trajectory of the blood stain.
* While not an appearance per se, there is a clear patch on the side of Veidt's Vivarium, shown on the cover of one issue. This clear patch is a perfect replica of the shape of the blood spatter.
* In addition, when the "alien" is teleported to New York, and the world turns to white, the comic book boy and the newspaper stand attendant incinerate together, and their silhouettes meld together to form the blood stain.
* In one of the panels depicting the aftermath of the New York disaster, the outlet of a "spark hydrant" on the ground has a splatter of blood mimicking the smile.
* Following Rorschach's disintegration by Dr. Manhattan, the vaporous blood rising from his remains intersects with icicles hanging from a circular entrance to Veidt's fortress, resembling the smiley face. 
* In the very last panel, the New Frontiersman employee known as Seymour, who habitually wears a green T-shirt with a yellow smiley face, drips ketchup on his stomach from a burger he is eating. This mimicks the smile almost perfectly, and brings the story to a circle.

==Film==
[[Jeffrey Dean Morgan]] will portray the character in the [[Watchmen (film)|upcoming film]] based upon the series. [http://www.superherohype.com/news/watchmennews.php?id=6056]
