Graydon Creed was the son of the [[Marvel Comics]] [[mutant]] [[supervillain]]s [[Mystique]] and [[Sabretooth]], and was a staunch foe of mutant civil rights throughout his life.  He first appeared in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #298.

{{spoiler}}

Posing as German spy Leni Zauber, Mystique seduced freelance assassin Victor Creed while he was in Germany on a mission. Mystique later gave birth to a normal human child - Graydon - whom she gave up for adoption, although she kept an eye on him.

When Graydon learned of his heritage, that he was the son of two evil mutants who had abandoned him as an inconvenience, he grew resentful of all mutants, and that resentment coloured his outlook for the rest of his life.

In his adult years, Graydon formed a group called the Friends of Humanity, dedicated to opposing mutant civil rights by committing acts of [[terrorism]] against peaceful mutants and mutant sympathizers, and using the acts of violence mutants such as [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] to rally support for their cause.  He was also a member of the [[Upstarts (comics)|Upstarts]], a group of well-connected murderous youths who were being manipulated by the [[telepath]]ic [[Gamesmaster]] for his own amusement.

At a rally for Graydon's hopeful presidential candidacy, an assassin shot and killed him (''[[X-Factor]]'' #130). Mystique had fired the shot, having sworn to kill Graydon for his part in the Friends of Humanity's brutal attack on Trevor Chase, the grandson of her lover [[Destiny (Marvel Comics)|Destiny]].
