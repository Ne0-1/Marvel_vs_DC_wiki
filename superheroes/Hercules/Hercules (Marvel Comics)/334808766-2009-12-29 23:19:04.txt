'''Hercules''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in publications published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appears in ''[[Journey into Mystery]] Annual'' #1 (1965) and was created by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist/co-plotter [[Jack Kirby]].

Debuting in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], the character is based on [[Heracles]] of [[Greek mythology]], although the name ''Hercules'' is associated with the version from [[Roman mythology]]. The character has starred in three self-titled [[limited series]] and been a perennial member of the [[superhero]] team the ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'', appearing in each of the three titles. In 2008, Hercules debuted in his own series titled ''The [[Incredible Hercules]]''. The character has also appeared in associated Marvel merchandise including [[animated]] [[television series]]; [[toy]]s; [[trading cards]] and [[video game]]s.

==Publication history==
Hercules debuted in ''[[Avengers (Marvel Comics)|Avengers]]'' #10 (Nov. 1964), although his appearance was revealed in the [[limited series]] ''[[Avengers Forever]]'' #1 - 12 (Dec. 1998 - Nov. 1999) as being an impostor. The character's first formal appearance in the Marvel Universe became ''[[Journey into Mystery]] Annual'' #1 (1965), which established Hercules as being a rival of the Thunder God ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]''. 

Hercules became a regular guest star in the title ''Thor'', appearing in issue #126 (March 1966), which was when the publication was rebadged after a successful run as ''Journey Into Mystery''. The character also guest-starred in ''[[Tales To Astonish]]'' #79 (May 1966), and a deadlocked battle with the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] establised Hercules as a powerhouse. Like Thor, the character eventually joined [[superhero]] team the ''[[Avengers (Marvel Comics)|Avengers]]'', as of issue #38 (March 1967). Hercules also guest starred in ''Marvel Team-Up'' #28 (Dec. 1974) and ''Marvel Premiere'' #26 (Nov. 1975) before starring along with four other heroes in the [[Champions (comics)|Champions]] #1 (Oct. 1975), a title showcasing Marvel latest superhero team. The title ran for seventeen issues, ending with issue #17 (Jan. 1978). The character also makes another guest appearance in team-up title ''[[Marvel Two-In-One]]'' #44 (Oct. 1978).

Hercules stars in two limited series by writer-artist [[Bob Layton]], with both set in an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]]. A 24th century version of Hercules stars in ''Hercules'' #1 - 4 (Sep. - Dec. 1982), with the series proving popular enough to spawn a sequel, ''Hercules'' vol. 2, #1 - 4 (March - June 1984). The storylines deal with Hercules' [[exile]] from the [[Olympus (Marvel Comics)|Olympus]], completion of a series of quests and opportunity to leave his past behind and create a new identity.

Hercules remained a constant guest star in both ''Thor'' and the ''Avengers'', playing a significant role in the "Avengers Under Siege" storyline in ''Avengers'' #270 - 277 (Aug. 1986 - March 1987), involving supervillain team the [[Masters of Evil]]. The story leads directly into the "Assault on Olympus" storyline in ''Avengers'' #281 - 285 (July 1987 - Nov. 1987), in which Hercules leaves the team. 

The character starred in the self-titled limited series ''Hercules'' vol. 3, #1 - 5 (June - Sep. 2005), and guest starred in limited series ''Thor: Blood Oath'' #1 - 6 (Nov. 2005 - Feb. 2006), a retrospective story that depicts the second meeting between the Greek god and Thor.

At the conclusion of the "[[World War Hulk]]" storyline, Hercules received a self-titled publication when Marvel changed the name of the third volume of the ''Incredible Hulk'' series to ''[[The Incredible Hercules]]'', effective as of issue #113 (Feb. 2008).
