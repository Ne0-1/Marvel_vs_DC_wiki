==Publication history==
===Modern era===
Hercules first appears when [[Immortus]] pulls him from the ancient past to battle Thor.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]] | Penciller = [[Don Heck|Heck, Don]] | Inker = [[Dick Ayers|Ayers, Dick]] | Story = The Avengers Break Up! | Title = [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] | Volume = 1 | Issue = 10 | date = November 1964 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> However this was subsequently ignored in his later appearances, such as in ''Journey into Mystery Annual'' #1 (1965), where he battled [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] in [[Olympus (Marvel Comics)|Olympus]].<ref name=JintoM>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]] | Penciller = [[Jack Kirby|Kirby, Jack]] | Inker = [[Vince Colletta|Colletta, Vince]] | Story = When Titans Clash! | Title = [[Journey into Mystery|Journey into Mystery Annual]] | Issue = 1 | date = December 1965 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> The mini-series ''[[Avengers Forever]]'' (1998-2000) explained this by having the Hercules from ''Avengers'' #10 be a [[Space Phantom]] in disguise.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Title = [[Avengers Forever]] | Issue =  | Date = 1998-2000 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>  

Hercules made several appearances in ''The Mighty Thor''<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]] | Penciler = [[Jack Kirby|Kirby, Jack]] | Inker = [[Vince Colletta|Colletta, Vince]] | Story = Thunder in the Netherworld! | Title = The Mighty Thor | Volume 1 | Issue = 130 | Date = July 1966 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>, even defeating Thor in battle on Earth.<ref>''Thor'' #126 (March 1966)</ref> He then unwittingly signed an "Olympian contract," making himself [[Pluto (Marvel Comics)|Pluto]]'s slave; Thor rescued Hercules from Pluto's underworld.<ref>''Thor'' #127-131 (April-August 1966)</ref>

Hercules then appeared in the ''Avengers'' during issue #38 as a thrall of the [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]],<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Roy Thomas|Thomas, Roy]] | Penciller = [[Don Heck|Heck, Don]] | Inker = Bell, George | Story = In Our Midst...

He returns to the Avengers for the final issues of the "Korvac saga" (#173-177).<ref>{{Comic book reference | Story = Korvac Saga | Title = Avengers | Volume = 1 | Issue = 173-177 | date = July 1978-November 1978 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> Hercules makes a guest appearance in issue #211,<ref>{{Comic book reference | Title = Avengers | Volume = 1 | Issue = 211 | date = September 1981 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]  }}</ref> and aided in the battle against [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]]'s legions in their invasion of New York City <ref>''Avengers'' #249; ''Thor'' #350-352</ref> before rejoining the team on an ongoing basis as of issue #250.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Story = The Fist Of Maelstrom! | Title = Avengers | Volume = 1 | Issue = 250 | date = December 1984 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>  

In the "Avengers Under Siege" storyline in ''Avengers'' #270-277,<ref>{{Comic book reference | Story = Avengers Under Siege | Title = Avengers | Volume = 1 | Issue = 270-277 | date = August 1986-March 1987 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> [[Baron Zemo#Baron Helmut Zemo|Baron Helmut Zemo]] assembled a super-sized version of the [[Masters of Evil]] and courtesy of a pawn drug Hercules at a bar. Returning to the Mansion during the siege, a drunken Hercules ignores the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] and holds off the attacking [[Masters of Evil]] until being surprised and viciously beaten by [[Erik Josten|Goliath]], [[Mister Hyde (comics)|Mister Hyde]], and the [[Wrecking Crew (comics)|Wrecking Crew]]. Hercules falls into a coma as a result of his beating, and is eventually retrieved by [[Hermes (Marvel Comics)|Hermes]] and taken back to Olympus, setting the stage for the "Assault on Olympus" storyline, which ran from #280-285. He was awakened from his coma by Prometheus, but was temporarily insane; he fought his fellow Avengers until he was restored to sanity by [[Doctor Druid]].<ref>{{Comic book reference | Story = Assault on Olympus | Title = Avengers | Volume = 1 | Issue = 280-285 | date = June 1987-November 1987 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> Blamed by [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]] for Hercules' condition, the Avengers battle the gods and finally [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]] himself.

Hercules was later defeated by the [[High Evolutionary]], and mutated "beyond godhood."<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #17</ref> In time, he returned to his previous godly form.<ref>''Thor'' #407</ref> He then assumed the secret identity "Harry Cleese."<ref>''Thor'' #408</ref> He also had an encounter with one of his worshippers, [[Magma (comics)|Magma]].<ref>''New Mutant'' #81</ref>

===Taylor Madison, and exile from Olympus===
Back on Earth, Hercules falls in love with a woman named Taylor Madison. As their relationship starts to get serious, [[Hera (Marvel Comics)|Hera]] shows up and attempts to kill her, for Hera and Ares had made a bet on who could hurt Hercules the most.<ref>''Avengers'' #349</ref> However, Ares betrays Hera and alerts Zeus in an attempt to get back in his favor. Zeus defeats Hera, but then reveals that Taylor Madison is not a real human being, but a construct created by Zeus himself to lure out Hera. Zeus then removes Taylor from existence, which causes Hercules to lash out to his father. Angered by what he calls "his son's lack of respect", Zeus strips Hercules of his immortality and a great deal of his power, then forbids him from ever returning to Olympus.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Title = Avengers| Volume = 1| Issue = 384 | Date = 1995 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>

The traumatized Hercules draws support from the Avengers, especially [[Deathcry]], whom he helps to return to her Shi'ar home-world. Upon returning from space, Hercules discovers that the Avengers have apparently sacrificed themselves to stop the being known as [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]]. Distraught over the loss of his comrades, he takes to drinking, becoming an alcoholic. 

Hercules travels in search of adventure, briefly serving with the [[Heroes For Hire]]. When the Avengers and other heroes return from their exile, Hercules joins the reformed team, opting to be an inactive member rather than serve as an active member. Hercules also seeks out [[Erik Josten]], now known as Atlas of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], in order to exact revenge for the coma he had put Hercules in while Josten was '''Goliath''' of the [[Masters of Evil]]. [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], then leader of the Thunderbolts, convinces Hercules to stand down at the cost of their long friendship.

===New Labors===
With the dissolution of the Avengers during the "Disassembled" storyline and the destruction of Asgard, Hercules falls to old habits, frequenting bars and putting forth the image of a drunkard.  With Hercules in a vulnerable position, Hera decides to strike with a new set of Labors.  To this end, she utilizes [[Eurystheus]], now the head of a modern company, to film a reality television show of Hercules completing new Labors, updated for the modern age.  During the course of his labors, Hercules finds forgiveness from Megara, and returns to defeat Eurystheus. In a concluding conversation with Hades, Hera confirms that the myths were correct in assuming that she caused her step-son to slaughter his family, but apparently not to Hercules knowledge.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Title = Hercules | Volume =  | Issue = 1-5 | Date = 2005 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]
 }}</ref>

Hercules goes on to fight and seriously injure the [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]], a supervillain who then sues Hercules, sending him into financial ruin. After helping Zeus and Ares unite the gods to defend Olympus against invaders, Hercules once again returns to Earth and rejoins [[Damage Control (comics)|Damage Control]], with whom he had previously performed community service as a result of his drunken stupors. This time, however, he is an employee, working in construction and demolition. Hercules recovers, however, when he participates in a poker game organized by the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] and wins much of his fortune back from the Constrictor.

===Civil War===
In the 2006 Marvel Comics crossover event [[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]], Hercules is shown as an early opponent of the Superhuman Registration Act, and calls the pro-registration heroes as "traitors". He takes the alias "Victor Tegler", an IT consultant, as cover to hide from pro-registration forces;<ref>''Civil War'' #2</ref> he is later dismissed as being not particularly intelligent by Tony Stark, who says that he "can't even spell 'registration'".<ref>"Iron Man/Captain America: Casualties Of War"</ref> In the final battle , he defeats the [[cyborg]] [[Cloning|clone]] of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], smashing the clone's head with his own [[Mjolnir (Marvel Comics)|Mjolnir]] hammer, screaming "Thou art no Thor!"<ref>''Civil War'' #7</ref>

===[[World War Hulk]]===
Issue 106 of [[Hulk (comics)|The Incredible Hulk]] ends with Hercules and [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]] meeting with [[Amadeus Cho]], one of the Hulk's allies. They agree to help the Hulk, but, upon encountering him, the Hulk savagely charges them, and Hercules is forced to defend himself, but is severely beaten after he stops fighting the Hulk to prove that he is not there to hurt him. Hercules' reason for aiding the Hulk is simple: both men, despite all of their strength, have lost their queen and family. In addition, Hercules wishes to make up for an altercation between the Hulk and the Champions years earlier. He and his team, the newly formed "Renegades", briefly appear in ''[[World War Hulk]]'' issue 2. The group is comprised of Hercules, Amadeus Cho, Angel, [[Namora]], and the [[Carmilla Black|female Scorpion]]. During the action, Herc and Namora shared a kiss. When the conflict ended, Hercules was the only renegade to stay with Amadeus.

===The Incredible Hercules===
Marvel has confirmed that the ''Incredible Hulk'' series has changed its name to ''Incredible Hercules'' from #113 onwards, and will feature Hercules and Amadeus as main characters.<ref>[http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.1870.Hercing_Out]</ref> <ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=12985 GREEK WEEK Part IV- Pak & Van Lente on Herc's Past & Future], [[Comic Book Resources]], March 20, 2008</ref> In the aftermath of the war, Hercules, against Amadeus' wishes, agrees to turn himself in. However, after learning that he will be working under his brother [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]], he escapes, taking Amadeus with him. After finding brief shelter in a refugee camp outside of New York, Hercules speaks with [[Athena (Marvel Comics)|Athena]], who is living in Vermont, to try and seek shelter.  However, after being shot by Ares' "Hydra blood bullets", he is driven into a psychotic rage, and begins seeing Amadeus Cho as [[Iolaus]], his nephew and ally from Ancient Greek times.  Cho decides to take advantage of the situation, by getting Hercules to attack a S.H.I.E.L.D. base. However both men were stopped by the Black Widow, who knocked out Cho, accidentally breaking the back of Cho's puppy, and cured Hercules of his rage. Out of respect for Hercules, Natasha lets Hercules go, with her claiming he knocked her out. He reunited with Cho, who captured a S.H.I.E.L.D. mobile base and was willing to destroy all of S.H.I.E.L.D. governmental facilities. Ares followed them, but with some heavy lifting and some tales of his greatest myths, Hercules was able to defeat Ares and convince Cho to halt S.H.I.E.L.D. destruction. Hercules and Cho teleported to where Athena was hiding out, and she warns them of the [[Secret Invasion]].

===Secret Invasion===
In the tie-in to the [[Secret Invasion]], Hercules gathers a team of gods to battle the pantheon of Skrull gods.<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #117</ref> This "[[God Squad (comics)|God Squad]]" consists of [[Snowbird (comics)|Snowbird]], [[Ajak]], [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (comics)|Amatsu-Mikaboshi]], and [[Atum (comics)|Demogorge]], and are set to oppose the Skrull gods led by Kly'bn and Sl'gur't.<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=12995 GREEK WEEK GREEK WEEK Part V: Enter the God Squad!], [[Comic Book Resources]], March 21, 2008</ref> After the group is forced to experience their worse fears by [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]], Snowbird and Hercules make love, after she confesses to him that she doesn't want to be alone anymore.<ref>''Incredible Hercules #118''</ref> Soon after a Skrull that had been with them since the end of World War Hulk reveals itself and is quickly dispatched. The issue ends with an impending battle between gods Hercules and Kly'bn, who states "He hears you" "and he loves you". However, Hercules and Snowbird together manage to slay the head god of the Skrulls, destroying the very inspiration for the ongoing Secret Invasion war. Meanwhile Mikaboshi has managed to overcome Sl´gur´t, and apparently assumes the position of leader of the Skrull pantheon, all according to Athena's plan.<ref>''Incredible Hercules #120''</ref>

===Love and War===
While Hercules decides to have a vacation with Namora after the Secret Invasion, a group of Amazons attack and capture Amadeus Cho, wanting him to find the [[Omphalos]], and use it to become the world's dominant force.  Hercules manages to save the captured Poseidon, and heads to intercept the Amazons at the new [[Axis Mundi]], [[Washington DC]].  Meanwhile, Hera and Pluto have taken over the Olympus Group, the modern day seat of power for the Olympians, via the inherited shares of Zeus' and by buying out Poseidon, and have decided the company has a new major goal:  the deaths of Athena and Hercules.<ref>''Incredible Hercules #121-123''</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Hercules possesses the typical powers of an [[Olympians (Marvel Comics)|Olympian]], including superhuman speed, durability, and reflexes. His primary power is his superhuman physical strength; Hercules is physically the strongest of all Olympians. His strength is sufficient to hurl a giant [[Sequoia]] tree, drag the island of [[Manhattan]] back into place,<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' vol.1, #28</ref> and preventing a gigantic fissure from ripping it apart.<ref>''World War Hulk: Aftersmash''</ref> While the limits of Hercules' strength have never been measured, he has been strong enough to stand toe to toe with [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]].<ref name=JintoM>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]] | Penciller = [[Jack Kirby|Kirby, Jack]] | Inker = [[Vince Colletta|Colletta, Vince]] | Story = When Titans Clash! | Title = Journey Into Mystery Annual | Issue = 1 | date = December 1965 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref><ref>{{Comic book reference | Title = Tales To Astonish | Volume = 1 | Issue = 79 | date = May 1966 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>

At times, Hercules has been punished by Zeus, a punishment marked by a "lightning bolt" tattoo on Hercules's shoulder. As a result, Hercules' powers, particularly his strength and immortality, were weakened considerably. However, in the recent ''[[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]]'' limited series, Hercules is shown fighting on behalf of Olympus with Zeus' blessing, and it has been officially stated that his full strength and godly attributes are restored to their usual levels.<ref name="civilwarbattledamage">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Ronald Byrd]] & [[Anthony Flamini]] | Penciller =  [[Scott Kolins]] | Inker = [[Scott Kolins]] | Story =  | Title = Civil War: Battle Damage Report | Issue = 1 | Date = March 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref>

At his full power, Hercules is functionally immortal, as are all Olympians, being immune to all known diseases, and his godly life force renders him capable of recovering from any conventional injury that does not severely dismember or disintegrate his body, but this was reduced at the time of Zeus's punishment.<ref>''Hulk: Hercules Unleashed</ref> Hercules is immensely resistant to physical injury and has withstood the impact of high caliber machine gun shells, falls from tremendous heights, exposure to temperature extremes and powerful energy blasts without sustaining injury. It took two point-blank blasts from the god [[Korvac|Michael Korvac]] to bring Hercules to the point of death.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Title = Avengers | Volume = 1 | Issue = 177 | date = November 1978 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | Page = | Panel = }}</ref>  Similarly, Hercules proved able to survive a vicious ambush from several superhumanly strong supervillains, including [[Erik Josten|Goliath]], the [[Wrecking Crew (comics)|Wrecking Crew]] and [[Mister Hyde (comics)|Mister Hyde]], despite being severely drunk at the time, although he fell into a [[coma]] from the damage.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Title = Avengers | Volume = 1 | Issue = 274 | date = | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | Page = | Panel = }}</ref>   

Hercules is an accomplished boxer and [[Greco-Roman wrestling|Greco-Roman wrestler]]. He is highly skilled with all forms of weaponry used in ancient Greece as well as the unarmed art of [[Pankration]], which he is reputed to have created. His weapon of choice is his enchanted Adamantine "Golden Mace," forged by Hephaestus, the blacksmith of the gods. The mace is known to be as durable as Thor's mystical Uru hammer, [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]],<ref name=JintoM>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]] | Penciller = [[Jack Kirby|Kirby, Jack]] | Inker = [[Vince Colletta|Colletta, Vince]] | Story = When Titans Clash! | Title = Journey Into Mystery Annual | Volume =  | Issue = 1 | date = December 1965 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> and to strike with equivalent force.<ref>''Avengers'' vol.3, #3</ref> He is an extraordinarily gifted archer, as well as an extraordinary hand-to-hand combatant. He was educated by tutors employed by his foster father, Amphitryon.

Before attaining godhood, Hercules employed arrows dipped in the lethal blood of the Lernaean Hydra, and wore the virtually indestructible hide of the Nemean Lion.  Hercules sometimes rides about on chariot built by Hephaestus, which is drawn by enchanted Olympian horses which can fly through space and into other dimensions.

==Relationships with other mythical characters==
===The Mighty Thor===
[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and Hercules are close rivals, but neither has hesitated to help the other if needed. The second meeting between the two gods was recently chronicled in the six-part series ''Thor: Blood Oath'' (2005).<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Michael Avon Oeming]] | Artist = [[Scott Kolins]] | Title = Thor: Blood Oath | Issue = 2-4 | date = December 2005- January 2006 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> The third meeting takes place in ''Journey Into Mystery'' #125 and ''Thor'' #126-130, when Thor battles the minions of Pluto to save Hercules from being trapped in the underworld forever.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Stan Lee]] | Penciller = [[Jack Kirby]] | Inker = [[Vince Colletta]] | Story =  | Title = Journey Into Mystery | Volume = 1 | Issue = 125 | date =  February 1966 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref><ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Stan Lee]] | Penciller = [[Jack Kirby]] | Inker = [[Vince Colletta]] | Title = Thor | Volume = 1 | Issue = 126-130 | date = March 1966-July 1966 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> Hercules has returned the favor and assisted Thor on several occasions, a notable example being the final battle against the Dark Gods in ''Thor'' (vol. 2) #10-12.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Dan Jurgens]] | Penciller = [[John Romita, Jr.]] | Inker = [[Klaus Janson]] | Story = The Dark Wars | Title = Thor | Volume = 2 | Issue = 10-12 | date =  April 1999-June 1999 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>  He also mentions that he is a friend of Thor and destroys the Thor clone in his name in ''Civil War'' #7. The two characters seem to regard each other as equals and have a deep amount of respect for each other.

===Other gods===
For all Zeus' gruffness, ''Hercules'' volume 2 #4 shows that he regards Hercules as his favorite,<ref>{{Comic book reference | Title = Hercules: Full Circle | Volume = 2 | Issue = 4 | Date = 1984 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> much to chagrin of the other Olympians — with the exception of Hercules' half-brother [[Apollo (Marvel Comics)|Apollo]]. Both Ares and Pluto are Hercules' mortal enemies.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Stan Lee]] | Penciller = [[Jack Kirby]] | Inker = [[Vince Colletta]] | Story = The Power of Pluto! | Title = Thor | Volume = 1 | Issue = 128 | date = May 1966 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>

===Wonder Woman===
During the Marvel/DC crossover ''[[JLA/Avengers]]'', [[Wonder Woman]] believed Hercules to be a villain, assuming he had raped his dimension's version of her mother, [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Hippolyta]]; however, Marvel Comics' Hercules had simply seduced Marvel Comics' [[Hippolyta (Marvel Comics)|Hippolyta]] with her consent. Ironically, the Marvel Universe version of Hercules is a hero while Hippolyta is a villainess, closely allied with her father Ares, whose counterpart is Wonder Woman's archenemy. However, this presented some continuity problems as Diana and her mother had already accepted their incarnation of Hercules' forgiveness, and Wonder Woman had not yet reverted to any previous incarnations.

In a more recent story this contrast appears deliberately spoofed, as Hercules is attacked by amazons led by Hippolyta's daughter, ''Artume'' (the Etruscan match for Rome's ''Diana''), a fanatic warmonger, in comparison with Wonder Woman's mission of peace. Additionally, Hippolyta states "I made you from..." (presumably "clay") before being cut off as Artume murders her for being 'lovestruck' and 'too soft'.<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #121</ref>

==Other versions==
===Hercules 2300===
Hercules also stars in two miniseries set in the 24th century.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Title = Hercules: Prince of Power | Volume = 1 | Issue = 1-4 | Date = 1982 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]  }}</ref><ref>{{Comic book reference | Title = Hercules: Full Circle | Volume = 2 | Issue = 1-4 | Date = 1984 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> In a bid to teach his son humility, an offended Zeus banishes Hercules. Loaned Apollo's chariot and steeds as a means of transportation, Hercules explores the cosmos. He encounters and befriends a Skrull named Skyppi and the [[Rigellians (Marvel Comics)|Rigellian]] [[Recorder (comics)|Recorder]] #417, woos various ladies (one of whom would give birth to a son who would become emperor of a planet and bitter towards his absentee father), fights assorted aliens, and, hopelessly outmatched against the World Devourer [[Galactus]], only succeeds in amusing him. This, however, proves to be enough, as Galactus forgets his hunger and spares the planet Hercules is defending. After numerous encounters with a variety of other beings, Hercules returns to Olympus to confront Zeus.

Once at Olympus he finds that Zeus has apparently slain all the other gods and now waits for Hercules in order to battle him as well.  Zeus orders Hercules to fight, only to have him refuse.  Zeus then strips Hercules of his immortality and forms it into a pearl, which he places in an altar fire.  He states that now Hercules has something worth fighting for, and attacks him with a war ax.  Greatly wounded, Hercules manages to use all his strength to defeat Zeus in single combat.  At the end, Hercules has the ax and yet refuses to slay his father.  At that point Zeus reveals that it had all been a sham designed to test Hercules strength of character, and that he had been exiled in order to learn humility.  Zeus had known that the time of the gods was nearing an end and that Hercules was destined to found a new race of gods for another world if he so chose, but Zeus had to assure himself that Hercules was actually worthy of the honor.  Zeus assures Hercules that the Olympian gods are not truly dead, but instead have gone on to another level of existence.  Hercules reclaims the pearl of his immortality and journeys to the heavens to find his dynasty.

===MC2===
In the world of the [[MC2]] Universe, Hercules is one of the last remaining Avengers alive and has bore a son named [[Argo the Almighty]], who has aided the next generation of Avengers.

===Marvel Zombies===

The zombie Hercules investigates the prone form of the zombie Hulk during the [[Silver Surfer]] feeding frenzy. He peers into the Hulk's mouth, noting the Surfer's head. The Hulk smashes Hercules' head between his hands. However, as seen with [[Colonel America]], massive brain trauma does not always stop the zombies.

Hercules is also seen in the Marvel Zombies crossover with the Ultimate Fantastic Four. When the Ultimate [[Reed Richards]] visits the Marvel Zombies dimension, She-Hulk and Hercules try to eat him. Reed escapes unharmed.
