'''Metallo''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|t|æ|l|oʊ}}) is a name used by multiple [[supervillain]]s appearing in [[comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]], commonly as an adversary of [[Superman]].

Metallo is usually depicted as a [[cyborg]] with a [[kryptonite]] power source in his heart, which he uses as a weapon against Superman. In 2009, Metallo was ranked as [[IGN]]'s 52nd-greatest comic book villain of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/lists/top-100-comic-book-villains/52|title=The Top 100 Comic Book Villains|date=2009|website=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2017-05-10}}</ref>

== Publication history ==
{{Incomplete section|date=August 2020}}
John Corben and Metallo first appeared in the [[Superman (comic strip)|''Superman'' comic strip]] storyline "The Menace of Metallo", which ran from 15 December 1958 to 4 April 1959.

The character debuted in comic books in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #252 (May 1959), in a story by [[Robert Bernstein (comics)|Robert Bernstein]] and [[Al Plastino]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=200}}</ref> 

There was an earlier "Metalo" who appeared in ''World's Finest'' #6 (Summer 1942). This was just a man who discovered the most powerful metal on earth and invented a strength serum.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Eury |first1=Michael |title=The Krypton Companion |date=2006 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=9781893905610 |page=83}}</ref>

== Fictional character biography ==
=== The Golden Age Metal<!-- The character's name has only one L -->o ===
The [[Superman (Earth-Two)|Golden Age Superman]] battled a criminal calling himself '''Metalo''', an inventor/scientist named George Grant who had built a powered suit of armor made from "the most powerful metal on Earth" as well as a "strength serum" that made him a near-match for Superman.  At the end of their battle, Metalo fell into a crevice to what Superman assumed would be his death.  Metalo was revealed to the reader to have "narrowly escaped destruction" and vowed to take revenge.<ref>''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' #6 (Summer 1942)</ref> Nearly 40 years would pass before the character reappeared in print to challenge Superman again.<ref>''[[Superman Family]]'' #217 (April 1982)</ref> Metalo had improved his armor and serum and also exposed Superman to a ray that reduced his power significantly, giving Metalo superior strength in their first battle. Superman engaged in a lengthy regimen of exercise and training to restore his powers and returned to easily defeat Metalo.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |page=245}}</ref>

=== First Silver Age Metallo ===

A different Metallo appeared as Jor-El's robot to battle [[Superboy (Kal-El)|Superboy]] in ''Superboy'' #49 (1956).

=== John Corben ===
John Corben was originally a [[journalist]] (and secretly a [[thief]] and [[murder]]er) who had just committed what he thought was the perfect murder. While fleeing from the scene of the crime, he suffered a near-fatal accident that mangled his body beyond repair.<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |pages=217-218}}</ref> An elderly scientist, Professor Vale, happened to come upon him and used his scientific skill to transfer Corben's brain into a robotic body covered by a flesh-like artificial skin.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fleisher |first1=Michael L. |title=The Original Encyclopedia of Comic Book Heroes, Volume Three: Superman |date=2007 |publisher=DC Comics |isbn=1-4012-1389-8 |pages=221-223}}</ref> Corben discovered that his power source, a capsule of [[uranium]], would only last a day, but was told by Vale that kryptonite would provide him an indefinite power supply.<ref>{{cite book |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia|year=2004|publisher=Dorling Kindersley Limited|isbn=978-0-7566-0592-6|page=201}}</ref>

After obtaining a job with the ''[[Daily Planet]]'', Corben briefly tried to romance [[Lois Lane]], while deciding that he would use his powers to eliminate Superman, the one person who might expose his criminal deeds. After setting a kryptonite death-trap for Superman, Corben stole what he thought was another sample of kryptonite from a museum as a new power supply, not knowing it was a fake prop; this mistake caused him to die, just as he was about to kill Lois Lane for discovering that he was not Superman (as he had pretended to be, being super-strong and invulnerable as a cyborg). Superman eventually escaped from the kryptonite trap and arrived just after Metallo (John Corben) had died.<ref>''Action Comics'' #252, (May 1959)</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=McAvennie |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |title=DC Comics Year By Year: A Visual Chronicle |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-8578-6 |page=88}}</ref>

=== The Bronze Age Metallo / Roger Corben ===
A second Metallo, John's brother '''Roger Corben''', debuted in ''Superman'' <!-- only denote volume number after first --> #310 (April 1977) by [[Curt Swan]] and [[Martin Pasko]]. This Metallo was created by a secret organization named "SKULL" that transferred Roger's brain into a new robotic body so that he could get revenge on Superman for his brother's death. Like the previous Metallo, this one was also powered by kryptonite, although this newer version wore orange and green armor, as well as a green helmet to conceal the "new" identity he had created using plastic surgery (which turned out to be WGBS Staffer Martin Korda).

This version of Metallo returned throughout the Bronze Age. His final appearance was featured in Alan Moore's "[[Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?]]" (1986).<ref>''Superman'' #423</ref>

=== The Modern Age Metallo ===
[[File:Metallo (John Corben -circa 1987).jpg|thumb|Metallo as drawn by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] in ''Superman'' (volume 2) #1 (January 1987)]]
After [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] rewrote Superman's origins in the 1986 miniseries ''[[The Man of Steel (comic book)|The Man of Steel]]'', Metallo was also given an altered backstory.

In this version, John Corben was a small-time con man who was fatally injured in a car crash, but thanks to luck, Professor Emmet Vale happened to pass by. Professor Vale was a pioneer in [[robotics]] and erroneously believed that Superman was the first in a wave of superpowered [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonian]] invaders after recovering Superman's ship and mistranslating Jor-El's message to his son. Vale transplanted Corben's [[brain]] into a [[robot]]ic alloy body, which was powered by a two-pound chunk of [[kryptonite]], and instructed him to kill Superman. Metallo, now Corben's new moniker, thanked Vale by snapping his neck and killing him.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |pages=242-244}}</ref>

Despite ignoring Vale's commands, Metallo came into conflict with Superman on various occasions, largely due to his continued activities as a petty thug. Metallo later lost his kryptonite heart to [[Lex Luthor]], though back-up life support systems allowed him to reactivate himself and escape. He remained a thorn in Superman's side and was powerful enough to cripple the [[Doom Patrol]]. Still, the Indian-born hero who called herself [[Celsius (comics)|Celsius]] did blow him apart with her thermal powers. Metallo later received a major upgrade via an unholy bargain with the demon [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]]. As a result, Metallo could morph his body into any mechanical shape he could imagine (turning his hands into guns or "growing" a jet-pack from his back) and project his consciousness into any [[technology|technological]] or metallic device. He could also grow to monstrous size. During one battle, his gigantic fists were separated and later turned into housing by other superheroes. In another incident, Metallo was rendered more insane by the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] and used his height to destroy an elevated train of commuters.

As Superman and others learned on various occasions, the most effective way to neutralize Metallo was to remove his (largely invulnerable) head and isolate it from other metallic items.

In ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' #2 (November 2003), Lex Luthor fabricated evidence implicating John Corben as the criminal who shot and killed Thomas and Martha Wayne, the parents of [[Batman|Bruce Wayne]].<ref>''[[Superman/Batman]]'' #2</ref>

==== ''Superman: Secret Origin'' ====
In the 2009–10 [[miniseries]] ''[[Superman: Secret Origin]]'', (which retells the origins of Superman and his supporting cast), Metallo is Sgt. John Corben. He serves under Lois Lane's father, General [[Sam Lane (comics)|Sam Lane]]. General Lane is trying to push his daughter, Lois into a relationship with Corben. Though they had one date, she does not return his feelings for her. Corben is next seen signing up for a military option to neutralize Superman (ostensibly with the help of a [[Powered exoskeleton|powersuit]] built by [[LexCorp]]). However, in his first encounter with Superman, a stray bullet hit the Kryptonite rock inside the suit, leading to a disastrous energy cascade within the battlesuit which almost killed Corben. Through the efforts of Lex Luthor and a crack team of scientists, Corben survived, part-man, part-machine, with the Kryptonite rock functioning as his new heart. Driven by a hatred for this alien invader, he became the villain known as Metallo. Metallo, now wearing a green, orange and red armor, subsequently attacked Superman again in a rampage which endangered not only the citizens of Metropolis, but his own fellow soldiers. He was defeated by Superman once more.

=== The New 52 ===
In September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, John Corben is under the command of General Sam Lane.<ref>''Action Comics'' Vol. 2 #1 (September 2011)</ref> General Lane tells him to talk to Lois Lane, when she keeps questioning where Superman is. It is implied that Corben and Lois once had a relationship. When Superman escapes from the military's custody, Corben is seen enlisting in what appears to be a military project co-opted by Lex Luthor, General Lane, and young scientist Doctor [[Steel (John Henry Irons)|John Henry Irons]]—"Project Steel Soldier"—to go against Superman.<ref>''Action Comics'' Vol. 2 #2 (October 2011)</ref> Corben is seen in the "Metal 0" suit with scientists, mostly Irons, trying to help him. He continues believing that he did it for the affection of Lois and when the robotic needles are in his head, Metallo takes control and his heart bursts. Metallo then screams "Where is Superman?"<ref>''Action Comics'' Vol. 2 #3 (November 2011)</ref> Although the attack on Superman succeeds, Metallo is revealed to have been subverted by [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] as part of his own plans, and his rampage is defeated when Doctor Irons uses an armoured suit of his own to fight Corben and upload a computer virus that he designed in the event of such a situation.<ref>''Action Comics'' Vol. 2 #4 (December 2011)</ref> After escaping, and still under Brainiac's control, Corben continued to fight Superman<ref>''Action Comics'' Vol. 2 #7 (March 2012)</ref> until he was able to reason with Metallo and to fight Brainiac's influence because of his feelings for Lois Lane. In doing so, Corben attacked Brainiac until Superman could defeat the villain, but he subsequently fell into a coma and was taken back by the army.

==== Forever Evil ====
It was revealed that the armor was keeping him alive thanks to alien technology, but without a heart he would soon die. General Lane told his scientists to find a way to save him since he helped to save Metropolis. He was later given a kryptonite heart to keep him alive since it was the only energy compatible with his cybernetics.<ref>''Action Comics'' Vol. 2 #8 (April 2012)</ref> After 31 months in a vegetative state, Corben was brought back with a shard of kryptonite to active duty in the U.S. Army. Since his actions caused the deaths of hundreds of civilians, General Lane tried to kill him by exploding the plane he was being carried in. He survived and sought vengeance against Lane at his base, only to be confronted by an upgraded soldier like himself "Metal-2.0". When Corben proves too much, Metal-2.0 activates his self-destruct mechanism, hoping to destroy Corben along with himself. However, he is saved by the Scarecrow and offered a place in the Secret Society of Super Villains, now calling himself Metallo. In "Forever Evil", [[Ultraman (comics)|Ultraman]] rips off his kryptonite heart, because of his addiction to the mineral.<ref>''Forever Evil'' #4</ref>

==== Doomed ====
Corben was eventually seen again incarcerated in John Henry's isolated super-prison, eventually drafted by the U.S. government again shortly afterwards, but is only brought back into their service by compunction from Lois once more (who was secretly under Brainiac's influence).<ref>''Action Comics'' Vol. 2 #31 (July 2014)</ref> Given the present danger he represents as Doomsday was taking him over, Lois convinced Metallo to run Superman down in a kryptonite bombing run and was summarily incinerated by the blast; all that was left of him being the Metal Zero exo-mantel fused to his now-charred remains.<ref>''Action Comics'' Vol. 2 #32 (Aug. 2014)</ref> Lois, now completely subsumed by the Brainiac consciousness inside of her, is able to recreate Corben's essential self by downloading her memory of the man he was into what was left of his old Metal-0 suit, said facsimile of the now-deceased military sergeant a loyal echo of whom he once was, obedient to her every whim.<ref>''Superman/Wonder Woman'' #10 (Sept. 2014)</ref> He would serve as her bodyguard as Dox's influence compelled her to cripple military defense systems around the world. He would immediately switch sides once Lois is freed from his control, however, and aid her in combating the alien threat to their world.<ref>''Action Comics Annual'' #3 (Sept. 2014)</ref> As Superman and Lois departed to stop Brainiac, Metallo was left on Earth to defend Metropolis in their stead.<ref>''Action Comics'' Vol. 2 #34 (Oct. 2014)</ref> After the crisis is resolved, Corben is later seen standing guard over Metropolis with [[Krypto]], seemingly contented with his current position.<ref>''Action Comics'' Vol. 2 #35 (Nov. 2014)</ref>

==== Truth/Savage Dawn ====
In the wake of Superman's identity being outed to the world as the hero began losing his powers, many an investigation was undertaken into his identity, contacts and motives by collective interests. Seeing as her life was in more danger than ever before, Metallo stuck close to his love as she went and did some investigating of her own in the meantime.<ref>''Batman/Superman'' #23 (Oct. 2015)</ref> While [[Vandal Savage]] made his play for ultimate power, Lois and Metallo were close by on the scene where Superman kept his warship from crushing a small town. While aiding Superman, as Lois refused to leave his side during the battle with Savage's empowered progeny, John's bionic shell was badly damaged. Looking to make good with all the bad in his life, he willingly offered his kryptonite heart to Superman (the depowered hero having discovered a treatment for his loss of powers that essentially involved giving himself chemotherapy with kryptonite), knowing full well that he could not survive without it.<ref>''Superman'' Vol. 3 #49 (April 2016)</ref>

=== DC Rebirth ===
{{expand section|date=June 2017}}
Metallo is briefly a member of a new version of the [[Superman Revenge Squad]], also consisting of [[General Zod]], [[Mongul]], [[Cyborg Superman]], [[Eradicator (character)|Eradicator]], and Blanque. After Superman is temporarily blinded, they are defeated when [[Lex Luthor]], [[Supergirl]], [[Superwoman]], Kong Kenan, and [[Steel (John Henry Irons)|Steel]] come to Superman's aid and Zod betrays the rest of the team for his own ends. <ref>''[[Action Comics]]'' (vol. 3) #979-984</ref>

== Powers and abilities ==
Metallo's metallic body offers him a high degree of protection from physical and energy attacks. He has enhanced abilities and no longer needs to eat, sleep, or breathe. His brain is hermetically sealed inside a shielded alloy skull that has its own power supply. When he was first created, he was powered by a kryptonite heart; losing that, he subsisted on plutonium instead. Additionally, because of his cyborg body, Metallo possesses superhuman strength and speed, enough to pose a challenge and even a threat to opponents such as Superman (in that case, he also takes advantage of the weakening power of kryptonite besides his own strength).

Over the course of his criminal career Metallo's body would be decimated constantly by various circumstances. As such he would receive numerous upgrades or whole new chassis' to replace his damaged parts, such as by the obscure supervillain organization Cerberus, which modified him with a vastly superior body, one with lead-lined skull-plating and an anatonic layer that even Superman could not demolish.<ref>''Adventures of Superman'' #491 (1987)</ref> This gave him greatly enhanced strength and durability, coupled with moderate mechanical regeneration to repair internal damage.<ref>''Action Comics'' #678 (1938)</ref> He was later outfitted with a larger LexCorp tech body, which gave him laser vision and further augmented his physical abilities.<ref>''Damage'' #1 (1994)</ref> Soon after it was destroyed, Corben had received a new body from fellow Kryptonite-powered supervillain [[Conduit (comics)|Conduit]]; which gave Metallo radioactive blasts from his hands and could utilize [[geomagnetism]] to make him physically immovable, even by the Man of Steel, so long as he stood on solid ground or flooring within a building complex.<ref>''Action Comics'' #710 (1938)</ref>

Metallo would eventually sell his soul (or what was left of it) to the archdemon [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]] in return for increased power,<ref>''Steel'' Vol. 2 #21 (November 1995) and ''Underworld Unleashed'' #1 (November 1995)</ref> gaining the abilities to mentally control and absorb any mechanical or metal object he focuses on and transforming any technology (himself included) into an extension of his exo-skeleton (an ability similar to the [[Cyborg Superman]]).

In experimenting with his newfound abilities, Metallo found he could alternate differing energy frequencies for harnessing and redistributing it from various power sources.<ref>''The Adventures of Superman'' #546</ref> [[Brainiac 13]] upgraded Metallo to tap into various light spectra to better utilize his kryptonite-charged abilities. His mechanical body was also upgraded to be able to grow towards monolithic proportions.<ref>''Superman: The Man of Steel'' #98</ref> He is also occasionally portrayed as having a [[liquid metal]]-based endoskeleton, possessing the ability to morph parts of his body, specifically his limbs, into different weapons or tools, such as chainsaws, shovels, hammers, etc. While not a genius like Lex Luthor or Brainiac, Corben's time spent with machines has given him a gifted understanding of how they work, enabling him to tinker with their mechanical functions even before gaining his technomorphing capabilities.<ref>''Doom Patrol'' #10 (1987)</ref>

During the publishing of ''Salvation Run'' it is revealed Metallo also boasts a high-calculus cyber-mind with which to run the numbers of possible and probable outcomes and success scenarios through. In the previous continuity, the Pre-''Flashpoint'' Lex Luthor modified Corben to holster and utilize different forms of kryptonite; boasting mutagenic red-k, inverted blue-k and lastly, artificial depowering gold-k on top of the green-k he already possessed.<ref>''Action Comics Annual'' #10</ref> He could even power a great many anti-Kryptonian armaments developed by Luthor through it.<ref>''Action Comics Annual'' #11</ref>

== Other versions ==
*Metallo appeared in ''[[Superman: Red Son]]'' as a project (among many others) invented by Dr. [[Lex Luthor]] for the U.S. government to combat Superman, who serves Communist Russia.<ref>''Superman: Red Son'' #3</ref>
*[[Marvel Comics]] cover-featured an unrelated character named Metallo in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #16 (April 1961).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/issue/16205/ |title=GCD :: Issue :: Tales of Suspense #16 |publisher=Comics.org |accessdate=2016-02-19}}</ref>
* The Silver Age Metallo appears in the series ''[[Justice (DC Comics)|Justice]]''.<ref>''Justice'' #4</ref>
* In Art Baltazar's ''Superman Family Adventures'', Jack Corben was an astronaut who became sick after flying through a kryptonite asteroid field. Lex Luthor manipulates him into believing that it was all Superman's fault and that he can help Jack if Jack defeats Superman. Jack gets the upper hand in the fight with his kryptonite, but the Superman family is aided by John Henry Irons into trapping Jack in a lead case. This version is not a cyborg, but instead has a large metallic armor that contains all his kryptonite poisoning.<ref>''Superman Family Adventures'' #6</ref>

==In other media==

===Television===

====Live-action====
* In the second-season ''[[Superboy (TV series)|Superboy]]'' episode "Metallo", Roger Corben (played by [[Michael Callan]]), a bungling bank robber, tries to rob an armored car even though he is having extreme chest pains. Superboy arrives and apprehends the bank robber, but the small-time crook has a heart attack and is taken to a hospital. After a lengthy recuperation, he escapes by murdering his doctor. After he leaves, he suffers another heart attack and his car crashes into a tree and explodes. The police assume he is dead, but journalist Clark Kent is not so sure. Meanwhile, Corben is alive. He falls into the hands of a mentally-unbalanced doctor who turns him into more of a machine than human being and replaces his failing human heart with the radioactive power source kryptonite. As Metallo, Corben made several more appearances in the ''Superboy'' series, specifically in the episodes "Super Menace", "People Vs. Metallo", "Threesome" (parts 1 and 2), and "Obituary for A Super-Hero".
* In the second-season ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman|Lois & Clark]]'' episode "Metallo", Johnny Corben (played by [[Scott Valentine (actor)|Scott Valentine]]) was [[Lucy Lane]]'s boyfriend and, unknown to her, a petty criminal. Not only does he have a criminal past, but he's hitting up Lucy for money. [[Lois Lane]] tries to convince her sister that Johnny's no good, but Lucy will hear none of it. Johnny was shot when a holdup went wrong and having fallen into the hands of Dr. Emmett Vale, a former [[LexCorp]] scientist with the help of his brother Rollie Vale, rebuilt Johnny into a Kryptonite-powered cyborg named Metallo and begins causing havoc in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]. And, since Metallo is powered by Kryptonite, even Superman can not stop him. When Metallo kidnaps Clark to use him as bait to lure Superman, it's up to Lois and [[Jimmy Olsen]] to save Clark, but nothing can save Metallo after a final run-in with Superman, who, now aware of his kryptonite power source, keeps his distance, using his super breath and heat vision to defeat him. Emmett is captured, but Rollie manages to escape with Metallo's kryptonite, leaving Metallo dead.

[[File:SmallvilleMetallo.jpg|frame|right|110px|[[Brian Austin Green]] as John Corben on ''[[Smallville]]'']]
* In ''[[Smallville]]'', John Corben/Metallo (played by [[Brian Austin Green]] in [[Smallville (season 9)|season nine]], uncredited actor in [[Smallville (season 10)|season ten]]) appears in the season premiere "Savior" as a former war reporter working at the Daily Planet alongside Lois Lane.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mitovich |first=Matt |url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Smallville-Brian-Austin-1007034.aspx |title=Smallville Casting Exclusive: Brian Austin Green Is Metallo! - Today's News: Our Take |publisher=TVGuide.com |date=2009-06-17 |accessdate=2016-02-19}}</ref> In "Metallo", he is revealed to despise the Blur ([[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent]]) because the latter rescued a prisoner that went on to murder Corben's sister. After being hit by a truck, he is experimented upon by [[General Zod|Major Zod]]'s Kandorian soldiers and wakes up with bionic appendages, including a kryptonite-powered artificial heart, and targets the Blur in revenge for his sister. Clark, though weakened by the kryptonite radiation, uses a lead plate to defeat Corben, who is recovered by LuthorCorp CEO Tess Mercer. In "Upgrade", Corben's prior insanity was explained as a flaw in his kryptonite heart and Tess' scientists repair him and turn him into a mindless weapon. Corben defeats Zod and a red kryptonite-infected Clark, regaining his free will after the control chip is removed from his head. Corben goes underground after receiving from Lois a red kryptonite heart. Despite regaining his sanity and parting on good terms with Lois and Clark, he is back to being a villain with a green kryptonite heart in "Prophecy", as a part of [[Toyman]]'s team of villains, "Marionette Ventures": he is assigned to target [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]]. He appears in the comic book continuation ''[[Smallville#Smallville Season Eleven|Smallville: Season Eleven]]'' which explains his character change as his biology rejecting the red kryptonite heart and he became a mercenary, tasked by a tyrannical dictatorship in rural country to subdue and eliminate a protector of the rebel forces; who was secretly the Kryptonite empowered Lana Lang. His new Green-K heart given to him by Toyman, had the ability to absorb meteor rock energy signatures serving to make him that much more powerful. When he absorbed the kryptonite powered nanites in Lana Lang's Prometheus augmented biology, they gave him the ability to reach out and assimilate any metallic or mechanical constructions within range, similar to his comic book appearance's technomorphing abilities. He was finally stopped and incarcerated by the U.S. government when Lana and Lois managed to incapacitate him by removing his power source.
====='''Arrowverse'''=====
There are six different versions of Metallo who appear in [[Arrowverse]]:
* John Corben appears in the episode "The Adventures of Supergirl," portrayed by Frederick Schmidt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/08/30/supergirl-metallo-season-2|title=Supergirl casts Superman villain Metallo — exclusive|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|last=Abrams|first=Natalie|date=August 30, 2016}}</ref> He was initially hired by the then-arrested [[Lex Luthor]] to assassinate his sister Lena Luthor to prevent her from rebranding [[LexCorp|Luthor Corp]]. His first two attempts to kill Lena fail due to the intervention of Supergirl and Superman and his third attempt is foiled by [[Alex Danvers]] and Lena who shoots Corben when he tries to take Alex hostage. While being sent to the hospital, he is intercepted by [[Project Cadmus]] who perform an experiment to convert him into Metallo. After meeting Project Cadmus' leader (who was later revealed to be Lex Luthor's mother Lillian), Metallo is unleashed on Supergirl and Superman. While Superman fought the other Metallo, Supergirl received help from Alex Danvers to remove his Kryptonite heart. Afterwards, Supergirl used Metallo's eyes to speak to Project Cadmus to let them know that she will find them. He later is busted out of jail via a smuggled synthetic Kryptonite "heart" brought in by [[Hank Henshaw]] (who also doctored the security footage to make it seem as though Lena Luthor had been the one who smuggled in the heart as part of an elaborate plot to both frame Lena and force her to aid her mother). However, because the synthetic Kryptonite was unstable, Corben was slowly undergoing a radiological meltdown, and ultimately perished via self-destruction despite Supergirl's best efforts to save him.
* Aside from Corben, Project Cadmus scientist '''Dr. Gilcrist''' (portrayed by Rich Ting), was also subjected unwillingly to be the second Metallo model by Lillian Luthor. During his fight with Superman, Martian Manhunter removed Dr. Gilcrist's Kryptonite heart shutting him down.
* An entirely robotic Metallo, voiced by Frederick Schmidt, features in the four-part [[Crossover (fiction)|crossover]] story "[[Crisis on Earth-X]]", linking the shows ''Supergirl'', ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'', ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' and ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]''. It appears as the servant of a Nazi regime led by Oliver Queen and Kara Zor-El, and takes the primary heroes of the aforementioned shows captive. It is eventually destroyed by the combined powers of the shows' characters, the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]], [[Black Canary]], [[Killer Frost]], [[Captain Cold|Citizen Cold]], the [[Ray (Ray Terrill)|Ray]], the [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]], [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]], [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]], [[Isis (DC Comics)|Zari]], [[Cisco Ramon (Arrowverse)|Vibe]], and [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]].

* Another version of Metallo appears in ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'', this version being '''[[Otis Graves]]''' (played by [[Robert Baker (actor)|Robert Baker]]). He first appeared in the season 4 premiere "American Alien" as human, and was so until his apparent death (along with his sister [[Mercy Graves|Mercy]]), in the episode "Ahimsa" at the hands of a [[Hellgrammite (comics)|Hellgrammite]]. He is then seen in the episode "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" as alive, but not stated how. It is then revealed in the episode "Crime and Punishment" that [[Lex Luthor]] and [[Eve Teschmacher]] resurrected him with Kryptonite, in an updated version of the Metallo suit. He is later killed by [[Ben Lockwood]]. <ref>{{cite web |title=Crime and Punishment |url=https://arrow.fandom.com/wiki/Crime_and_Punishment |website=Arrowverse Wiki |accessdate=30 April 2019}}</ref>

* John Corben/Metallo appears in several animated series set in the [[DC Animated Universe]]:
** He made his debut in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by veteran actor [[Malcolm McDowell]]. John Corben was originally an English [[mercenary|criminal-for-hire]], who was eventually caught and jailed by Superman. During his time in prison, Corben contracted a rare and fatal disease. His past employer (and the person responsible for Corben being infected by the disease), [[Lex Luthor]], then offered him a new lease on life by transferring his consciousness into a robotic body, and in exchange Corben would kill Superman for Luthor. The android body is made of an indestructible alloy called "Metallo", and is powered by a kryptonite power source to use against the Man of Steel. However, Corben soon learned that his new body had no sense of taste, smell or touch, and this sensory deprivation drove him insane. Realizing he was no longer the man he once was, Corben dubbed himself "Metallo", and took brutal pleasure in trying to kill or torture Superman, usually with his kryptonite core.
** Metallo returns in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' episode "Hereafter", voiced by [[Corey Burton]]. He appears as a member of the [[Superman Revenge Squad]].
** Malcolm McDowell reprised his role as Metallo in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', where he is a member of [[Gorilla Grodd]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]]. He, along with [[Silver Banshee]], are sent on a mission to [[Skartaris]] to obtain a large kryptonite rock, but are ultimately defeated by the Justice League. When he attempts to tell the League about the new Secret Society, his brain is fried by a protocol [[Grodd]] secretly programmed into him.
* Metallo appeared in season 5 of the animated series ''[[The Batman]]'', voiced by [[Lex Lang]]. His kryptonite heart is not in his center, but in the upper left quadrant of his chest. Also, Metallo has a back-up power source and can operate without the kryptonite heart. Metallo was paid by [[Lex Luthor]] to kill [[Superman]]. Because of the kryptonite, Superman fought a losing battle until [[Batman]] and [[Dick Grayson|Robin]] showed up. They managed to get the kryptonite out of Metallo long enough for Superman to recover. After he recovered, Superman defeated Metallo by trapping him in a hydraulic compactor, although it is said that a certain type of battery keeps him alive. His origin is not given.
* Metallo makes a cameo appearance as one of the villains Superman and Batman take down together in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]''. Superman is wrestling with Metallo on top of a building when Metallo exposes his kryptonite heart and weakens Superman. Batman comes and uses a grappling hook to pull the kryptonite heart from the center of Metallo's chest. Metallo is then easily beaten by Superman with one punch. His design is like the Bronze Age Metallo although much bulkier than Superman.
* Metallo appears in the ''[[Justice League Action]]'' animated short "True Colors", voiced by [[Chris Diamantopoulos]]. In an attempt to help Superman by turning Metallo's kryptonite heart into lead,  [[Ronnie Raymond (character)|Firestorm]] turns it into different versions of kryptonite instead, each having different effects on Superman. After Pink Kryptonite turns Superman into a woman, she defeats Metallo and Firestorm manages to turn his heart to lead.
* Metallo appears in ''[[Harley Quinn (TV series)|Harley Quinn]]''. He appears in "L.O.D.R.S.V.P." as a member of the Legion of Doom.

===Film===
* Metallo appears in the animated movie ''[[Superman/Batman: Public Enemies]]'', which is based on [[Jeph Loeb]]'s 2003 comic book story arc of the same name that appeared in the ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' comic book. In the movie, Metallo is voiced by [[John C. McGinley]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/news.php?action=fullnews&id=502 |title=The World's Finest |publisher=Worldsfinestonline.com |accessdate=2011-01-18}}</ref> He acts as Lex Luthor's bodyguard who then fights with both Superman and Batman. After they escape him, he is killed by [[Major Force]] and his death is used to [[frameup|frame]] Superman, although a cursory analysis of his body by Batman confirms that he was killed by a radiation blast rather than heat vision.
* Metallo makes a brief appearance in ''[[All-Star Superman (film)|All-Star Superman]]''. He is seen lifting weights when Lex Luthor, escorted by armed guards, and Clark Kent (who is interviewing Lex Luthor), walk past his glass cell. He looks up when they pass by. Clark Kent seemed to shy away from Metallo's cell since it was not made of lead. This led to [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]]'s escape from his cell near Metallo's since Parasite easily absorbed Clark Kent's power from a few meters away. The only reason Superman was not affected by the kryptonite heart was because his overcharged powers made him impervious to it.
* Metallo appears in the animated film ''[[Justice League: Doom]]'', voiced by [[Paul Blackthorne]].<ref>{{cite web|first=James|last=Harvey|url= http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/news.php/news.php?action=fullnews&id=1135|title=Warner Home Video Announces Voice Cast For "Justice League: Doom" Animated Film|publisher=Worldsfinestonline.com|date=2011-09-28|accessdate=2011-09-27}}</ref> He is part of [[Vandal Savage]]'s [[Legion of Doom (Super Friends)|Legion of Doom]], and is his counterpart to Superman. He is more lighthearted than his fellow Legion members, as shown by his attempts to shake [[Bane (comics)|Bane]]'s hand after saying he was a fan of Bane's work, and openly laughing when Vandal Savage presents his plan. He draws Superman's attention by posing as ''[[Daily Planet]]'' reporter Henry Ackerson and heading to the top of the building itself, claiming to commit suicide. [[Lois Lane]] tells Superman about Ackerson, and the Man of Steel flies onto the roof and convinces him not to jump. Metallo then pulls out a gun containing a kryptonite bullet and shoots Superman in the chest and exposing his Kryptonite heart before knocking Superman off the roof and into the streets below. Despite mocking Savage's plan initially, he takes part in it. When the Justice League storms the Hall of Doom, Metallo fights Superman, gaining the upper hand using his kryptonite heart to weaken the Man of Steel. Despite holding off Superman for most of the fight, once Savage launches his missile Superman slammed the plating containing Metallo's heart over the kryptonite, forcibly trapping it before Superman uses his heat vision to [[decapitate]] Metallo. Metallo's head was most likely reattached and he was put into custody.
* Metallo appears briefly in the 2018 film ''[[The Death of Superman (film)|The Death of Superman]]'' as a hologram in the Hall of Justice's training room, and is noted within a newspaper headline as having been defeated by Cyborg Superman in the 2019 animated feature ''[[Reign of the Supermen (film)|Reign of the Supermen]]''.
* Metallo was initially considered to be the [[antagonist]] in [[Zack Snyder]]'s ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'' sequel, but the project was eventually cancelled in favor of ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]''. It was then revealed that Metallo was going to be a villain in an earlier draft of ''Dawn of Justice'' using the body of Wallace Keefe.<ref>{{cite web |title=Wallace Keefe |url=https://dcextendeduniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Wallace_Keefe |website=DC Extended Universe Wiki |publisher=Fandom Wiki |accessdate=30 April 2019}}</ref> It was rumored he was going to be in the final fight between Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman instead of [[Doomsday (DC Comics)|Doomsday]] but this was never confirmed. His creator, Emmet Vale, appears in ''Dawn of Justice'', portrayed by Ralph Lister.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jay Jayson |url=http://comicbook.com/2015/07/03/metallo-was-originally-planned-as-villain-in-man-of-steel-sequel/ |title=Metallo Was Originally Planned As Villain In Man Of Steel Sequel |publisher=Comicbook.com |accessdate=2016-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Batman-V-Superman-Casting-Hints-Possibility-Metallo-Future-DC-Comics-Films-119047.html|title=Batman V Superman Casting Hints At Possibility Of Metallo For Future DC Comics Films|date=2016-03-17|website=CINEMABLEND|access-date=2019-04-14}}</ref>

===Radio===
* [[Dirk Maggs]]' 1990 [[BBC Radio]] adaptation of ''The Man of Steel'' included Metallo as a major character. In this version, Corben (played by [[Simon Treves]]) was wearing the suit of battle armor that Lex Luthor sent up against Superman. To cover his tracks, Luthor ensured that the suit's psionic interface was unstable, leaving Corben a complete vegetable. He was 'rescued' by Doctor Schwarz, a disgruntled former LexCorp employee, who had been tracking the capsule that brought the infant Superman to Earth and stole this from the Kents' farm. Having built Corben an android body powered by the capsule's kryptonite power source, they hatched a plan to kill Lex Luthor and Superman. Metallo double-crosses Schwarz and breaks his neck. Kidnapping Lois Lane, Metallo holes up at the power station at Two Mile Island waiting for Superman to face him. During the ensuring battle, Lex Luthor steps in and tears out Metallo's kryptonite heart.
