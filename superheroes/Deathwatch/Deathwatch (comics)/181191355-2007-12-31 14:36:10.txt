==Fictional character biography==
Deathwatch is a Translord from an unknown demonic dimension.  Posing as a [[crime boss]] in the real world as Stephen Lords, Deathwatch plotted to destroy [[New York]] through a poisonous [[toxin]].  After a gang stole the canisters containing the biotoxin, Deathwatch contested with the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] for the canisters, and set [[Blackout (comics)#Blackout (Lilin)|Blackout]] against the new [[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Ghost Rider]].<ref>''Ghost Rider'' Vol. 3 #1-2</ref> Deathwatch and Blackout attacked the 75th Precinct police station and stole the biotoxin canisters.

In the course of become a personal enemy to the hero, Deathwatch employed several assassins, including countless Deathspawn, all of whom were from the demon world that Deathwatch was a part of. After meeting his demise at the hands of Ghost Rider for the first time, he was reanimated by the Deathspawn, Hag, and Troll.  However, he was captured with Hag and Troll by Ghost Rider, [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|John Blaze]], and [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #96; ''Spirits of Vengeance'' #6</ref> With Hag and Troll, he was captured by [[Steel Wind]] and [[Steel Vengeance]],<ref>''Spirits of Vengeance'' #7</ref> and the three villains were turned over to [[Centurious]].<ref>''Spirits of Vengeance'' #9</ref>

The [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] has hired him as part of his criminal organization to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the Superhuman Registration Act.

==Powers and abilities==
Deathwatch is a native of an alien demonic dimension and so derived at least some of his superhuman powers from his non-human heritage. Deathwatch has the ability to absorb life from another creature that is experiencing pain or death and enhance his own health, strength, stamina, agility, and reflexes. He has the ability to physically penetrate a victim's body and disrupt internal organs without creating a surface wound.  He also has the ability to absorb and access a victim's short-term memories by penetrating the victim's brain physically with his fingers, and has the ability to derive surges of physical and emotional pleasure from the proximity of death.

Deathwatch is a skilled [[ninja]], and highly proficient in acrobatic hand-to-hand combat, and is an experienced strangler. He is a master planner and strategist, and a skilled acrobat.  He employs a wide range of warriors, including being the head of his own criminal combine and a group of ninja warriors.  He usually wears a costume of synthetic stretch fabric lined with Kevlar.
