'''Deathwatch''' is a [[demonic]] [[super villain]] in the [[Marvel Comics Universe]], most notably as an enemy of [[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]].

==Biography==
Posing as a [[crime boss]] in the real world as Stephen Lords, Deathwatch plotted to destroy [[New York]] through a poisonous [[toxin]].  After a gang stole the cannisters containing the toxin, Deathwatch encountered [[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]], and became a personal enemy to the hero.  Deathwatch employed several assassins, including [[Blackout (comics)|Blackout]], [[Hag and Troll]], and [[Snowblind (comics)|Snowblind]], plus countless Deathspawn, all of whom were from the demon world that Deathwatch was a part of.  Deathwatch later met his demise at the hands of [[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]].  He was later resurrected by Centurious to help in an attempt to steal Ghost Rider's chain.  During his battle with Ghost Rider, Deathwatch revealed that his original (retconned) intent during the events involving the poisonous canisters was to obtain Ghost Rider's medallion of power.  He was easily defeated by the combined power of Ghost Rider and Johnny Blaze.  He recently appeared, alive and well, as a prisoner of [[The Raft (comics)|The Raft]].

==Powers==
Aside from being a skilled [[ninja]], Deathwatch has the ability to absorb life from another creature and enhance his own health, strength, stamina, agility, and reflexes.  He also possesses some limited [[telepathy]], and employs a wide range of warriors.
