The '''Huntsman''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]] who is a tracker/hunter of the Olympian Gods for [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]]. Over the years he has appeared mainly as an enemy of [[Hercules_(Marvel_Comics)|Hercules]]. 

==Fictional character biography==
The Huntsman was originally not based on any mythological character, but he was subsequently revealed to be [[Cephalus]], having been raised from Hades to serve Zeus.<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #139</ref>  In his first appearance, he was dispatched by Zeus to retrieve Hercules.  Zeus had been deceived by [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]].  The Huntsman battled Hercules, [[Namor]], and some other members of [[Avengers (comics)|the Avengers]].  Eventually, Zeus recalled the Huntsman and ended the battle.<ref>''Ka-Zar Quarterly'' #1/2, ''Sub-Mariner'' v.1 #29</ref>  Some time later, again at the instigation of Ares (as well as [[Hippolyta (Marvel Comics)|Hippolyta]] and [[Pluto (Marvel Comics)|Pluto]]), he was sent to Earth to retrieve Hercules and Aphrodite in order to force them to marry Hippolyta and Ares.  He initially succeeded in capturing them and defeating their allies [[Champions of Los Angeles|the Champions]], but in the final battle on Olympus itself was knocked out by [[Angel (Marvel Comics)|Angel]].<ref>''The Champions'' #2-3</ref>

Huntsman reappeared some decades later serving [[Hera (Marvel Comics)|Hera]], who sent him to kill [[Aegis (comics)|Aegis]], a hero blessed by the goddess [[Athena (Marvel Comics)|Athena]].  Huntsman initially surprised him in his apartment and used his staff to turn the aegis breastplate against him.  Thinking Athena would protect him, Aegis jumped out of the window and fell 12 stories to his death.  Huntsman was then sent by Hera as part of her plan to lure Hercules and Athena into a trap using Aegis's body as bait. After luring in Athena, Hercules and [[Amadeus Cho]], the trio are attacked by the Huntsman alongside Hera, [[Typhon (comics)|Typhon]], [[Delphyne Gorgon]] and [[Pluto (Marvel Comics)|Pluto]]. The battle was interrupted by the [[Dark Avengers]], allowing Hercules and his friends to escape.<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #127-128</ref>  He was later seen with the aegis in his custody.<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #129</ref>

Hera and her allies ultimate plan is to remake the universe with a product called Contiuum. While Hercules and the Avengers are determining how to stop them, it is revealed that Huntsman stands sentry on the roof of the Olympus Group building. Their plan involves [[Hebe (Marvel_Comics)|Hebe]] acting as a decoy, and as she approaches the building she is first spotted by Huntsman who alerts Argus of her presence.  In the ensuing brawl, Huntsman fights [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], and impales him with his javelin.<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #138-139</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Huntsman draws his power from Zeus through contact with a magic staff, and, following Zeus' death, presumably from Hera.  The staff grants him a wide range of abilities, including interdimensional travel, energy blasts, and the ability to both inspire tremendous fear in gods and drain their powers on contact.  The staff also grants him superhuman strength.  When the staff is not in his hands, he loses his powers.  His enchanted javelin never misses its target.
