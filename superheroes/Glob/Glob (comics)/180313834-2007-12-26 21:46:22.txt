'''Glob''' ('''Joseph "Joe" Timms''') is a fictional monster character from the [[Marvel Universe]] who first appeared in ''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #121.  

==Fictional character biography==
'''Joe Timms''' was an escaped convict who drowned in a swamp bog following his escape.  Timms was transformed by radioactive waste into a strange slime-like shambling monster, named '''Glob''', with superhuman strength but with very little intelligence.   Shortly after his transformation, Glob was blown into fragments by an explosion, its brain reformed and psionically molded itself into an amnesiac blond haired man.  The man was later captured and mutated by Yagzan (leader of the crazed cult of Entropists) into a clay form version of Glob which was seemingly killed by Yagzan.  However, it was revealed that it was enslaved by the [[Collector (comics)|Collector]] and eventually rebelled against him with assistance of the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and [[Man-Thing]].  Glob was used as a weapon by the Entropists in an encounter with the Man-Thing.  However he ended up devolving back into the Glob.  He was then taken into [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody where Glob was recruited in that organization's [[Nick Fury's Howling Commandos|Paramormal Containment Unit]].

==Notes==
