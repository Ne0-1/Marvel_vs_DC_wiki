The '''Wrath''' is the name of two [[Fictional character|fictional]] [[comic book]] [[supervillain]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. The original Wrath debuted in ''[[Batman|Batman Special]]'' #1 (1984), and was created by [[Mike W. Barr]] and [[Michael Golden]]. The second Wrath debuted in ''Batman Confidential'' #13 (March 2008), and was created by [[Tony Bedard]] and [[Rags Morales]].

==Publication history==
The Wrath's debut story was titled "The Player on the Other Side", published in ''Batman Special'' #1 (1984). The title was based on an essay by [[Aldous Huxley]]; but it is also a reference to the [[Ellery Queen]] novel of the same name, as the story's author, [[Mike W. Barr]] is a renowned Queen enthusiast. Actually this is a mistake, the actually quote used in all cases originally comes from a [[Thomas Henry Huxley]]; essay - A Liberal Education and Where to Find It.

A Post [[Infinite Crisis]] legacy version of The Wrath debuted in the paged of ''[[Batman Confidential]]'' #13 in a story arc written by [[Tony Bedard]], with Elliott Caldwell, the 'student' of the original Wrath, taking on his mentor's mantle.

==Fictional character biography==
===Wrath===
The first Wrath was a member of [[Batman]]'s rogues gallery, where he served as a sort of anti-Batman. The Wrath's appearance and motivation are reminiscent of Batman's, but with notable differences. The Wrath (like Batman) is distinguished by [[perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionism]] and obsession in what he does. His costume is also very similar to Batman's (though colored in crimson and purple with a W-insignia on the chest and cowl; the W on his cowl, when seen in the right light and at the right angle, looks like the ears of the Batman's own cowl).

The Wrath's parents were a couple of [[burglar]]s like [[Joe Chill]], the man who shot and killed Batman's own parents. They were shot by a young policeman who mistook them for committing a robbery (in actuality, they were crawling out of a window to "skip out" on paying their rent). Due to this, the Wrath dedicated his life to a campaign of revenge against law and law-enforcers. As he had grown up, the burglars' son became a professional [[assassination|assassin]]. For years, he traveled the world to work as a gun for hire, later falling in love with Gayle Hudson, the daughter of an ex-mafia boss who hired Wrath to kill the people who killed her father after his retirement.

When the Wrath finally returns to Gotham City, he comes to kill the man who had shot his parents. The Wrath's target turns out to be [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]] of the Gotham City Police, and thus a clash with Batman becomes inevitable. In the course of their impersonal battle of wits, the Wrath learns of Batman's secret identity as Bruce Wayne and proceeds to attack several of his friends; [[Alfred Pennyworth]] is hospitalized, and [[Leslie Thompkins]] is taken hostage by the Wrath.

In the end, the Wrath dies during his showdown with Batman, having fallen from the roof of a building in Park Row. This happened after he was caught in a fire set earlier by the Wrath himself; one of his explosive capsules went off during a fight, with Batman's susbequent attempt to throw the Wrath off after being trapped in a hold resulting in him accidentally throwing the Wrath into the fire, the Wrath subsequently falling to his death before Batman could grab him.

In ''Wrath Child'' (''Batman Confidential'' #13-16), several details of his origin were retconned.  According to the story, his father was a corrupt cop who was robbing a warehouse with his wife and his son acting as a lookout when Gordon confronts them and, in a gunfight, kills the parents in self-defense (Although Wrath, whether delusional or simply lying to make himself seem like the victim, claimed that Gordon fired first and that his mother was unarmed when in reality his parents were both armed and his father fired first, his mother subsequently trying to shoot the injured Gordon with her husband's gun after his death and Gordon's shots only being fatal because his aim was knocked off by the pain). In order to cover up the criminal activities of the officer and to protect himself and other corrupt cops, then-Captain [[Gillian Loeb]] has Gordon transferred to Chicago between that night and the events of ''[[Batman: Year One]]'' and threatens the boy to force Gordon to comply.

Subsequently, the orphaned boy was sent to an orphanage, never to be adopted because the police feared what he might say. Growing to hate cops, he becomes a hitman in hopes of "avenging his parents again and again". While preparing to assassinate Gordon he studied Batman, initially planning just to dress like him to needle Gordon but coming to conclude that they were kindred spirits inspired by a similar disaster in their lives, duplicating Batman's costume and equipment to the extent that he began training his own "Robin", which went on to become the new Wrath.<ref name="Tony Bedard 2008"># ^  Tony Bedard (w),  Rags Morales (p),  Mark Farmer (i). "Wrath Child Part II" Batman Confidential vol. 1,  #15 (May 2008)  DC Comics[3]</ref>

It also retconned that the original story took place shortly after Dick Grayson became Robin (the original story was published the same year that Grayson became Nightwing), with Grayson missing the events because he was away at the time on an "educational holiday" (One of the various training missions Batman sent him on).

A new Wrath appears in 2008s ''Batman Confidential'', sporting an all-purple costume. This Wrath, which Batman is convinced is a copycat from his first appearance, begins murdering police officers visiting Gotham for a convention and breaks in to Grayle Hudson's apartment.<ref name=con13>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Tony Bedard]] | Penciller= [[Rags Morales]] |Inker=[[Mark Farmer]]| Story = Wrath Child Part I | Title = Batman Confidential | Volume = 1 | Issue = 13 | Date = March 2008 | Publisher = [[DC Comics]] }}</ref> After a fight with Batman, during which he confirms he's not the original Wrath, he tells the Dark Knight to investigate [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]]'s actions on June 26 twenty five years agoâ€” the same night Bruce Wayne's parents died.<ref name="Con14">{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Tony Bedard]] | Penciller =[[Rags Morales]]  | Inker = [[Mark Farmer]] | Story = Wrath Child Part II | Title = Batman Confidential | Volume = 1 | Issue = 14 | Date = April 2008 | Publisher = [[DC Comics]] }}</ref>  Upon another meeting with Batman, the second Wrath tells a distorted versions of the events that happened, saying Gordon killed the original Wrath's parents in cold blood, though Batman saw through this and realized that Gordon shot them in self-defense.<ref name="Tony Bedard 2008"/>  Batman and Nightwing, upon confronting the second Wrath for a final time, learned the new Wrath's real name was revealed to be '''Elliot Caldwell''', an orphaned boy whom the Wrath trained to be his answer to Batman's Robin.  Elliot was one of five orphans who the original Wrath kidnapped and trained, but Elliot was the only one who survived the training. Despite Caldwell's refusal to believe their claims and his subsequent efforts to continue fighting, he was stopped by Batman and Nightwing, whose team work and care for each other forced Caldwell to recognise that he had never had the same relationship with his master, and was sent to [[Blackgate Penitentiary]], although he reflected that he would be ready to face them again in future now that his 'emtional weakness' had been purged.

==In other media==
===Television===
The Wrath made his first appearance outside of comics in season five of ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' voiced by [[Christopher Gorham]]. He also has a [[Robin (comics)|Robin-like]] partner named Scorn (voiced by [[Daryl Sabara]], the brother of [[Evan Sabara]], who voiced Robin). In the series, they are given identities of '''Will Mallory''' and '''Andy Mallory''', respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/news.php?action=fullnews&id=48 |title=The World's Finest |publisher=Worldsfinestonline.com |date=2008-02-04 |accessdate=2010-12-30}}</ref> William and Andrew Mallory are children of jewel thieves. It's implied that their parents made themselves wealthy this way. However, they are eventually  caught and [[convicted]] the same night when Bruce Wayne's parents were shot. At the time, both Mallory brothers were still only young children. Andy barely remembers them, due to him being no older than a [[toddler]]. It is this event that motivates them to become the Wrath and Scorn, Wrath defending their actions by claiming that criminals like the Joker have the right to make a living their way just as much as innocent people do, demonstrating no interest in his comic counterpart's vendetta against the law that took his parents. Their activities consist of aiding Batman villains [[Joker (comics)|Joker]], [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]], [[Killer Croc]], and the [[Ventriloquist (comics)|Ventriloquist & Scarface]]. At the same time, they also fought Batman (as well as Robin) directly. When out of costume, the Mallory brothers pretend to be friends of Bruce Wayne and [[Dick Grayson]] (Andy and Dick, however, do little to hide their disdain for each other). Ultimately, it is this "friendship" that leads Bruce and Will to realize each other is Batman and Wrath. Although the costumed brothers are eventually captured, they plan to reveal the Dynamic Duo's secret identities. Bruce is willing to accept that outcome, but the Joker is not. Having grown tired of Wrath and Scorn's interference, Joker decides to silence them by posing as  a policeman when they plea to him to get them out. Thus, he gases them with Joker venom. The Joker implies that this will "break [their] minds," and it clearly prevents them from speaking. However, it's unclear whether the effects can be reversed. 

This version of Wrath wears a crimson and gold colored outfit instead of the original, crimson and purple outfit, or the Caldwell all-purple outfit. This coloring makes him resemble [[Catman (comics)|Catman]], another Batman doppelganger and foe. His motivation to help criminals from law enforcement and Batman is inspired by another doppleganger, [[Killer Moth]]. Scorn wears a black and white costume with a pointed "S" on the chest.
