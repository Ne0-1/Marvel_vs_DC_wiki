'''Quakemaster''' is a fictional [[supervillain]] in [[DC Comics]].

== Character history ==

'''Robert Coleman''' was an architect of some note in [[Gotham City]].  His reputation was irreparably damaged when an apartment complex he designed and built did not withstand a [[hurricane]].  Feeling that he had been wrongly branded, Coleman created the alias of the Quakemaster and used his super-charged [[jackhammer]] to create earthquakes in [[Gotham City]].  His scheme backfired and only his buildings were damaged in the quakes.  Quakemaster was defeated and captured by [[Batman]].  Quakemaster was later released and recruited to the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] to be part of the team working with the [[Silver Ghost]] to kill the [[Freedom Fighters]].  Quakemaster was part of a team of supervillains recruited by [[Lex Luthor]] and [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]] during the so called ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''.

Quakemaster later fell to hanging out with other villains who had apparently fallen on hard times.  The other villains included [[Black Mass (comics)|Black Mass]], [[Sonar (comics)|Sonar]], the original [[Blackrock (comics)|Blackrock]] and the [[Cavalier (comics)|Cavalier]].  The villains gathered at a New York bar to play games of [[poker]].  In one such game, the villains lost most of their weapons and devices to Wally Tortelloni, an everyday civilian.  When the villains ganged up to track Tortelloni down and retake their devices, they were apprehended by members of the [[Justice League International]].

Much later, Quakemaster was among numerous villains hired by [[Manchester Black]] to attack friends and family members of Clark Kent, secretly [[Superman]].  He was once again defeated.
