'''Bedlam''' ('''Jesse Aaronson''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[Mutant (fictional)|mutant]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He possesses the mutant ability to create and project a bio-electric field. This has the effect of temporarily disabling any electric machinery in the vicinity. He can also utilize his power to scan the environment for other pre-existing energy fields. After the [[High Evolutionary]] reset the mutant genome in every mutant on the planet, Jesse gained the ability to affect the human brain's neural chemistry, thus allowing him to project the illusion of pain and confusion into other people.

==Fictional character biography==
'''Jesse Aaronson''' was created based on a character that had appeared in the [[Age of Apocalypse]] crossover, but did not have a [[Earth-616]] counterpart at the time. He was orphaned at the age of 5 after his parent were killed in a tragic car accident. After that, he and his brother Christopher were put up for adoption. Jesse ended up in the hands of the [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier's]] Mutant Underground Support Engine (M.U.S.E.), a group based out of [[Montana]] with the goal of rescuing mutants and training them as field agents. During that time he was exploited by Dr. Derek Parsons, who tried to convince Jesse that his brother was simply a figment of his imagination. When he reached the age of 19, Jesse decided to leave M.U.S.E. in order to track down his brother once and for all. He enlisted the help of the mutant spy and former [[X-Force]] member, [[Domino (comics)|Domino]]. He offered her information regarding the whereabouts of the [[Prime Sentinel]] unit named Ekaterina Gryaznova in exchange for Domino's help. Gryaznova, now calling herself Gryphon, had implanted a device in Domino's body several months ago, which severely diminished her mutant powers. Upon entering the base Domino was captured but Bedlam managed to escape. Using his resources from M.U.S.E., he managed to track down X-Force in [[San Francisco]] and break into their headquarters, in order to ask them for help. The team managed to free Domino and apparently kill Gryphon. In the process, Bedlam used his power to short circuit Domino's implant. 

Keeping up her end of the bargain, Domino managed to find information regarding his family. His parents were actually information analysts at the National Security Department. They paid a visit to his parents' former supervisor, Dabney Saunders, who was residing in a retirement home, babbling incoherent sentences. Domino, however, discovered the orderly in charge of Saunders informing an unidentified man about their visit.  Both Bedlam and Domino broke into the mysterious man's home using Jesse's power and were subsequently attacked by [[Magma (comics)|Magma]] and [[Paradigm (comics)|Paradigm]]. Bedlam used his powers to disrupt Paradigm's electronics, knocking out Magma in the process. However, they were subdued by none other than Jesse's brother, Christopher. Christopher, calling himself [[King Bedlam]], has the power to disrupt the higher functions of the brain. Chris was tagged as a mutant at the age of six by the N.S.D. and was taken into a research center after their parents' death. At age 13 he fled, destroying Saunders mind in the process. He had now founded a new team of [[Hellions]] and offered an invitation of membership to Jesse, who gladly accepted. The group's true intentions, however, were to reanimate the Armageddon Man in order to blackmail the U.S. government into paying one billion dollars. X-Force managed to subdue the Armageddon Man, but the New Hellions managed to escape. Jesse was invited back to join X-Force, as he had discovered that it was his brother responsible for their parents' death.

After several missions with the team, Jesse learned martial arts through a Delphi box given to him by [[Peter Wisdom]]. The team also learned of Bedlam's unique condition, which forced him to take medication in order to keep his own power from scrambling his brain. After the High Evolutionary removed every mutants' power and subsequently restored it, the team took on a new direction. Peter Wisdom was now X-Force's leader, while Domino and [[Danielle Moonstar|Moonstar]] had quit. Wisdom taught them how to use their new abilities. In Jesse's case, he could generate an [[electromagnetic pulse]] from a distance, without having to be in physical contact with the target machinery, and could also disrupt neural responses just like his brother. He remained with the team until their apparent deaths in ''X-Force'' #115, where he used his power to destroy an underground alien colony. 

After a new group of "pop star" mutants began calling themselves X-Force, the original team crashed their press conference. The only missing member was Jesse. Months later when a group called the Church of Humanity crucified some mutants on the lawn on the mansion, Jesse was found among them. [[Archangel (comics)|Archangel]] used his healing blood to revive Magma and [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]], but, apparently, Jesse, among several others didn't have the same luck.  His death is unconfirmed as of now though.

==Powers and Abilities==
Jesse has the memories of a karate black belt, and thus can perform with those skills.  His mutant ability allows him to generate a bio-electric field that wreaks havoc with electrical systems.

==Alternate versions==
A different version of Bedlam was shown to exist in the Age of Apocalypse. This appearance actually precedes the one in the Earth-616 universe. In this reality, he worked for [[Mister Sinister|Sinister]] in his pens, along with his brother, who is called Terrence. He eventually turned on [[Havok]], in order to help [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey]] to escape the pens.
