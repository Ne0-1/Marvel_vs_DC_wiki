==Fictional character biography==

Gorgilla was originally a 20ft half-man/half-ape native to the island of [[Borneo]], who is discovered by an expedition seeking the "missing link" between man and apes. After Gorgilla saves the expedition from a dinosaur, a [[Tyrannosaurus Rex]], they in gratitude decide to leave the island and never mention Gorgilla. <ref>''Tales To Astonish'' vol. 1, #12. </ref> Gorgilla, however, becomes curious about mankind and stows away on a ship bound for New York. Gorgilla stops an assassination attempt while in New York, but dies from a fall from the Statue of Liberty. <ref>''Tales of Suspense'' vol. 1, #18</ref> This is later corrected and it is revealed that the adventurer [[Doctor Druid]] talks Gorgilla down from the Statue of Liberty and ensures that he is returned to Borneo. <ref>''Marvel Universe'' #4 (1998)</ref>

In ''Defenders Vol 2'' #1 (2001), Gorgilla is influenced by a powerful mystic named [[Yandroth]] into attacking the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. He is seen on teleivision subduing the group by dropping a building onto them. Yandroth is soon defeated by the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].

Gorgilla is later deposited on Monster Isle by the [[Fantastic Four]] and eventually undergoes  a rehabilitation program, which involves him being shrunken down to human size and hypnotically stripped of his powers so as to allow him to enter human society. Gorgilla takes up a job as a window cleaner at the Baxter Building, and later joins fellow monsters [[Fin Fang Foom]],  
[[Elektro (comics)|Elektro]] and [[Googam]] as part of the "Fin Fang Four" to defeat the microscopic alien conqueror [[Tim Boo Baa]]. <ref>''Fin Fan Four'' #1 (2005)</ref>
