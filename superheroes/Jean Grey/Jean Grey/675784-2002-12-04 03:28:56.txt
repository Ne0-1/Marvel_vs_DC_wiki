'''Jean Grey''' is a character in [[Marvel Comics]] who first appeared in [[X-Men]] #1 ([[1963]]) by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

A [[mutant]] born with the abilities of [[telepathy]] and [[telekinesis]] that manifested themselves during childhood.  Jean joined the team of adolescent superheroes known as the X-Men under the sobriquet Marvel Girl.  The team battled less benign mutants under the tutelage of Professor [[Charles Xavier]].  Jean was one of the original members of the team and one of the few who remained with the team when a new roster of mutants joined.  

During a mission Jean attempted to pilot a shuttle from space back to Earth. The shuttle was unshielded and Jean would have died were it not for the intervention of the cosmic entity known as the [[Phoenix_(Marvel_Comics)|Phoenix]]. Though at the time it was believed (and the storyline was meant to be) that the Phoenix imbued Jean with vast cosmic powers in reality ([[retcon]]ned in [[1986]] in order to launch the spin-off title [[X Factor|X-Factor]]) it took on the identity of Jean Grey while the original Grey was placed in a coccon to recuperate at the bottom of [[Jamaica Bay]]. The Phoenix believed itself to be Jean Grey and continued to live Grey's life. Eventually the powerful entity became corrupt and chose to sacrifice itself rather than endanger the universe and her friends.  

Jean was believed dead by the world, both within the [[Marvel Universe]] and the reading public.  The powerful and touching story by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne]] was instrumental in the meteoric rise of the popularity of the X-Men in particular and mutant angst in general.  The popularity led to a demand for more mutant titles from Marvel.  In 1986 it was decided that Jean Grey would be resurrected in order to launch a book featuring the original five X-Men as a team once more.  The fact that Jean was not the Phoenix was created and appropriately retconned.  Jean Grey was discovered at the bottom of Jamaica Bay and reunited with some of her friends.  She dealt with fluctuating powers, some labrynthian storylines and various company mandated crossovers.  She eventually married longtime beau Scott Summers (aka [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and the couple are currently featured in the pages of the New X-Men comic.
