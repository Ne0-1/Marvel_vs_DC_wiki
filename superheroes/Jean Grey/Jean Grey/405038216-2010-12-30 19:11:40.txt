'''Jean Grey-Summers''' is a [[fiction]]al [[comic book]] [[Superhero#Female_superheroes|superheroine]] appearing in books published by [[Marvel Comics]]. She has been known under the aliases '''Marvel Girl'''  and later, '''[[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]]''' and '''Dark Phoenix''', and is best known as one of five original members of the [[X-Men]], for her relationship with [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], and for her central role and transformation in the classic X-Men storyline, "[[The Dark Phoenix Saga]]".

Jean Grey-Summers is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] born with [[Telepathy|telepathic]] and [[Psychokinesis|telekinetic]] powers. Her powers first manifested when she saw her childhood friend being hit by a car. She is a caring, nurturing figure, but she also must deal with being an [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)#Omega-level mutants|Omega-level mutant]] and the physical manifestation of the cosmic [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]]. She faces death several times in the history of the series, first in the classic "Dark Phoenix Saga" but due to her connection with the Phoenix Force, she, as her namesake implies, [[comic book death|rises from death]].

Jean is an important figure in the lives of other Marvel universe characters, mostly the X-Men, including her husband Cyclops; her mentor and father-figure [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]]; her close friend and sometimes romantic interest [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]; [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], who is her best friend and a sister-like figure; and genetic children [[Rachel Summers]], [[Nate Grey|X-Man]], and [[Cable (comics)|Cable]].

The character is present for much of the X-Men's history, and she is featured in all three ''X-Men'' [[animation|animated series]] and several video games. [[Famke Janssen]] portrayed Jean in the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' films]]. She is a playable character in ''[[X-Men Legends]]'' (2004), ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]'' (2005), and ''[[Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2]]'' (2009), and appears as an enemy in the first ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]''.
In 2006, [[IGN]] rated Jean Grey #6 on their list of Top 25 X-Men from the past forty years.<ref name=IGNTop25>{{cite web

==Publication history==
===Debut (1960s)===
Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist/co-writer [[Jack Kirby]], Jean first appeared as '''Marvel Girl''' in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' #1 (September 1963).  As the original team's sole female member, Marvel Girl was a regular part of the team through the series' publication.  Initially possessing the ability of telekinesis, the character was later granted the power of telepathy,<ref>{{Cite comic

In an attempt to save her fellow X-Men that renders her near death, Jean bonds with a cosmic entity called the "[[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]]" and gains immense powers, adopting the new codename "'''Phoenix'''".  This new identity and her immense abilities became the focus of another extended storyline, "[[The Dark Phoenix Saga]]", in which Jean becomes overwhelmed and corrupted by her god-like powers and transforms into a force of total destruction, now called "'''Dark Phoenix'''", consuming a star, inadvertently killing the inhabitants of the star's solar system, and jeopardizing the entire universe.  The storyline ends in Jean Grey's suicide, in a moment of regained control, to ensure the universe's safety.<ref name="DPS">{{cite book |title=X-Men: The Dark Phoenix Saga |first=Chris  |last=Claremont |publisher= Marvel Publishing |location=New York| isbn=0785122133 |year=1984}}</ref>  "[[The Dark Phoenix Saga]]" (including the earlier "Phoenix Saga") would become one of the most well-known and heavily referenced stories in mainstream American superhero comics, widely considered a classic.<ref name="Deeley">Deeley, Michael.

When the first [[trade paperback]] of "The Dark Phoenix Saga" was published in 1984, Marvel also published a 48-page special issue titled "Dark Phoenix: The Untold Story."  A reprinting of ''Uncanny X-Men'' #137 was published, with new artwork and dialogue with the originally intended ending by Claremont and Byrne.  Along with the alternate ending were transcripts of the roundtable discussion between Shooter, Claremont, Byrne, editors [[Jim Salicrup]] and [[Louise Simonson|Louise Jones]], and inker [[Terry Austin (comics)|Terry Austin]] about the creation of the new Phoenix persona, the development of the story and what lead to its eventual change, and also Claremont and Byrne's plans for Jean Grey had she survived.<ref name="Deeley"/>
[[Image:Phoenixconsumesstar.png|right|150px|thumb|Phoenix consumes a star, inadvertently killing billions of people.]]
Claremont revealed that his and Byrne's motivation for Jean Grey's transformation into Phoenix was to create "the first cosmic superheroine" akin to [[Thor (comics)|Thor]].<ref name="DPT"/>  The two hoped that like Thor had been integrated into ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' lineup, Phoenix would also become an effective and immensely powerful member of the X-Men.<ref name="DPT"/>  However, both Salicrup and Byrne had strong feelings against how powerful Phoenix had become, feeling that she drew too much focus in the book.<ref name="DPT"/>  Byrne worked with Claremont to effectively remove Phoenix from the storyline, initially by removing her powers. However, Byrne's decision to have Dark Phoenix destroy an inhabited solar system in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #135, coupled with the planned ending to the story arc, worried then-Editor-in-Chief [[Jim Shooter]], who felt that allowing Jean to live at the conclusion of the story was both morally unacceptable (given that she was now a "mass murderer")<ref name="Deeley"/> and also an unsatisfying ending from a storytelling point of view.<ref name="Deeley"/> Shooter publicly laid out his reasoning in the 1984 roundtable:
<blockquote>
I personally think, and I've said this many times, that having a character destroy an inhabited world with billions of people wipe out a starship and then—well, you know, having the powers removed and being let go on Earth. It seems to me that that's the same as capturing [[Hitler]] alive and letting him go live on Long Island. Now, I don't think the story would ''end'' there. I think a lot of people would come to his door with machine guns... .<ref name="DPT">{{Cite comic

</blockquote>
In ''The Dark Phoenix Tapes'', Claremont suggested that one of the creative team's questions that affected the story's conclusion was whether the Phoenix's personality and later descent into madness and evil were inherent to Jean Grey or if the Phoenix was itself an entity merely possessing her.<ref name="DPT"/>  The unclear relationship between Jean Grey and the Phoenix Force would continue to be a topic subject to different interpretations and explanations by various future writers and editors at Marvel Comics.  At the time of the Phoenix's creation, Byrne viewed it as an entity that entirely possessed Jean Grey, therefore absolving her of its crimes once it was driven out.<ref name="DPT"/>  Conversely, Shooter viewed Phoenix as an inherent and inseparable aspect of Jean Grey, meaning that the character was fully responsible for her actions as Phoenix.<ref name="DPT"/>  As a result, Shooter requested that Claremont and Byrne rewrite the last chapter of issue #137, to explicitly place in the story both a consequence and an ending commensurate with the enormity of Phoenix's actions.<ref name="DPT"/>

The original ending was published in the one-shot ''Phoenix: The Untold Story'' in April, 1984. In the original ending, Jean is overpowered, captured, and subjected to a "psychic lobotomy," permanently leaving Jean without any of her telepathic or telekinetic powers. The concept that Byrne and Claremont had in mind was that her powers ended up being permanently suppressed, but with the threat always in the shadows of Phoenix returning. In the end, Jean is allowed to return to Earth with the rest of the X-Men, "cured" of the power and madness of Dark Phoenix.<ref name="DPT"/> Later plans stated by Claremont and Byrne also involved Magneto offering Jean the chance to restore her abilities, but with Jean proving herself in a heroic moment by choosing to remain depowered and eliminate the threat of Dark Phoenix returning to power.<ref name="DPT"/>  The one-shot also reveals the original splash page drawn for ''Uncanny X-Men'' #138, which shows Jean and Scott in a happier time, contrasted with the splash page actually published in issue #138 that shows Jean's funeral.<ref name="DPT"/>

Writer [[Kurt Busiek]] is credited as coming up with the plot to revive Jean Grey.<ref name="Busiek"/>  At the time, Jim Shooter ruled that the character could not be revived unless she was absolved of her genocidal actions.<ref name="Busiek"/>  Busiek, a fan of the original five X-Men, was displeased with the character's death and formulated various storylines that would have met Shooter's rule and allowed the character to return to the X-Men franchise.<ref name="Busiek"/>  He eventually shared his storyline idea with fellow writer [[Roger Stern]] who mentioned it to Byrne, who was in charge of illustrating the ''Fantastic Four'' at the time.<ref name="Busiek"/>  Both series writer [[Bob Layton]] and artist [[Jackson Guice]], who were developing the series ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]''—a team of former X-Men—had yet to settle on their fifth team member, initially considering [[Dazzler]].<ref name="5thmember">{{cite web |first=Brian |last=Cronin |url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2008/06/26/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-161/ |title=Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #161 |work=Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=June 26, 2008 |accessdate=July 9, 2010}}</ref>  Layton opted to fill the open spot with Jean instead, and both he and Byrne submitted the idea to Shooter, who approved it.<ref name="Busiek"/>  Jean Grey's revival became a crossover plotline between the ''Avengers'' under Stern, ''Fantastic Four'' under Byrne, and ''X-Factor'' under Layton.<ref name="Busiek"/>  Busiek later found out that his idea had been used thanks to Layton, and was credited in ''Fantastic Four'' #286 and was paid for his contributions.<ref name="Busiek"/>  The decision to revive Jean Grey was controversial among fans, with some appreciating the return of the character and others feeling it weakened the impact of the "Dark Phoenix Saga"'s ending.<ref name="Busiek"/>  Busiek maintains that the idea that lead to Jean Grey's official return to Marvel Comics was merely a case of sharing his ideas with friends as a fan, and that he cannot be blamed by those who disliked her return because he neither formally pitched the idea to anyone nor gave it the final go ahead.<ref name="Busiek"/>

In the comics, having been fully established as separate from the "Jean Grey" copy created and taken over by the Phoenix Force, Jean is "absolved" of involvement in the atrocities of "The Dark Phoenix" storyline, and she returns in the first issue of ''X-Factor'' (1st Series) only to find that the other members of the original X-Men have retired.<ref name="XFT1">{{Cite comic

Claremont later commented on how Jean's revival affected his original plans for Madelyne Pryor, stating that the relationship between the two women was intended to be entirely coincidental.<ref name="SerieJournalen">Kristiansen, Ulrik & Rensenf, Tue S. [http://www.seriejournalen.dk/tegneserie_indhold.asp?art=&ID=32 "Interview with Chris Claremont" Serie Journalen (May 1, 1996).] Accessed Jul. 9, 2010.</ref>  He intended Madelyne only to look like Jean by complete coincidence and exist as a means for Cyclops to move on with his life and be written out of the ''X-Men'' franchise, part of what he believed to be a natural progression for any member of the team.<ref name="SerieJournalen"/>  Claremont expressed dismay that Jean's resurrection ultimately resulted in Cyclops abandoning his wife and child, tarnishing his written persona as a hero and "decent human being", and the "untenable situation" with Madelyne being dealt with by transforming her into a [[prolicide|prolicidal]] demonic villain and killing her off.<ref name="SerieJournalen"/>

Soon after the beginning publication of ''X-Factor'', Marvel also reprinted and released the original ''X-Men'' series under the title "''Classic X-Men''".  These reissues paired the original stories with new vignettes, elaborating on plot points.  One such issue, ''Classic X-Men'' #8 (April 1987), paired the original ''X-Men'' #100 (August 1976) story of Jean Grey's disastrous return flight from space immediately preceding her transformation into Phoenix ("Love Hath No X-Man...") with the new story "Phoenix".  The story further supported the retcon establishing Jean Grey and the Phoenix Force as two separate entities.  The vignette elaborated on the events between ''X-Men'' #100 and ''X-Men'' #101: facing certain death from radiation poisoning, Jean Grey cries out for help to save the lives of her fellow X-Men.  Hearing her cry and sensing her intense passion for life and love for Scott and her friends, the Phoenix Force—the "sum and substance of life"—responds, offering to save her by bonding to her, coupling her humanity with its incredible power.  Jean accepts and immediately finds her consciousness in a duplicated body.  She places her former dying body, still containing a spark of her soul, in a healing cocoon.  The duplicate, now calling itself Phoenix, proceeds to the events depicted in the original ''X-Men'' #101 (October 1976) story "Like A Phoenix, From The Ashes!" with the cocoon sinking to the bottom of the Jamaica Bay to be discovered in '"Avengers'' #263.<ref name="CLSX8"/>

===Return to the X-Men (1990s)===
Following the conclusion of ''Inferno'', Jean continues to be a mainstay character throughout the rest of ''X-Factor'', rejecting a marriage proposal from Scott and meeting her alternate future daughter [[Rachel Summers]], whom she also rejects out of the feeling that they both suggest her life is predetermined.<ref name="XFT53">{{Cite comic

''X-Factor'' (1st Series) ended its run featuring the original X-Men with ''X-Factor'' #70 (September, 1991), with the characters transitioning over to ''Uncanny X-Men'', explained in continuity as the two teams deciding to merge together.  The fourteen X-Men divide into two teams—"Blue" and "Gold"—led by Cyclops and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], respectively.

In ''Uncanny X-Men'' #308 (January 1994), Jean accepts a second marriage proposal from Scott and the two marry in ''X-Men'' #30 (March, 1994).  Jean and Scott were immediately featured in the four-part miniseries ''The Adventures of Cyclops & Phoenix'', where the two were psychically transported 2000 years into the future to raise Scott's son Nathan, who had been transported to the future as an infant in hopes of curing him of a deadly virus.  The series depicted the couple assuming the names Redd (Jean) and Slym (Cyclops) and raising Nathan Christopher for twelve years before being sent back into their bodies on their wedding honeymoon.  Before their return, Jean learns that Rachel had transported them to the future to protect Nathan, and per her request adopts the codename "Phoenix" once again to establish it as a symbol of good after all the bad it had caused.<ref name="TAoC&P">{{cite book |title=The Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix |first=Scott  |last=Lobdell |publisher= Marvel Publishing |location=New York| isbn=0-7851-0171-3 |year=1994}}</ref>

During the ''Revolution'' event, all ''X-Men'' titles began six months after the events of ''Apocalypse: the Twelve'', allowing writers to create fresh situations and stories and gradually fill in the missing events of the previous six months of continuity.  Due to editing decisions following the success of the 2000 ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'', an explanation for Jean's altered powers was never explicitly made, though writer Chris Claremont revealed in interviews that it was intended to be an accidental power switch between fellow X-Man [[Psylocke]], explaining Psylocke's new telekinetic powers as well.

Jean was next featured in the six-issue miniseries ''[[X-Men Forever]]'' written by [[Fabian Nicieza]], which was designed to tie up remaining plot lines.  During the series, Jean revisited many of the events involving the Phoenix Force and the series introduced the concept of "Omega level mutants", a category for mutants with unlimited potential, which includes Jean herself.<ref name="XMFRV">{{Cite comic

In June 2001, ''X-Men'' was retitled as ''New X-Men'' under writer [[Grant Morrison]].  The title consisted of a smaller team featuring Jean, Cyclops, Beast, Wolverine, [[Emma Frost]], and Charles Xavier.  The overarching plot focused on the team assuming the roles of teachers to a new generation of mutants at the Xavier Institute while navigating their personal relationships and dealing with newly emerging pro- and anti-mutant political sentiments.<ref name="NWXMNOMN">{{cite book |title=New X-Men Omnibus (Hardcover) |first=Grant  |last=Morrisson |publisher= Marvel Publishing |location=New York| isbn=0785123261 |year=2006}}</ref>  The series sees the return of Jean's telekinesis, her emerging ability to tap into the powers of the Phoenix Force once again, her assumption of the duties as headmistress of the Xavier Institute, and the failing of her marriage to Scott following his traumatic experience being possessed by Apocalypse.<ref name="NWXMNOMN"/>  Jean and Wolverine address their long-unspoken mutual attraction, deciding it is best not to act on their feelings, while Scott begins feeling further alienated from Jean and seeks consolation from Emma Frost to address his disillusionment and his experiences while possessed by Apocalypse.<ref name="NWXMNOMN"/>  These interactions lead to a "psychic affair" between Scott and Emma.

==Fictional character biography==
===Background===
Jean Grey was born the daughter of [[Dr. John Grey (comics)|Dr. John Grey]] and [[Elaine Grey]].  Before joining the X-Men, she lived with her family in [[Annandale-on-Hudson, New York]], where Dr. Grey worked as a history [[professor]] at [[Bard College]].

Jean is the only member of her immediate family with mutant abilities (her niece and nephew, [[Joey Bailey|Joey]] and [[Gailyn Bailey|Gailyn]], are also revealed as mutants). Her powers first manifest at the age of ten, prematurely triggered when her best friend, Annie Richards, is hit by a car. As her friend lies dying, Jean instinctively links to her mind and senses what Annie feels when she dies, in doing so, the trauma of experiencing her friend's death nearly kills her, leaving her in a coma.{{Issue|date=September 2010}}

===Help from Xavier===
To rouse her out of her catatonic state, Jean's parents seek the expertise of specialists, of whom only [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]] is able to help. Xavier uses Jean to help locate mutants with his [[Cerebro|Cerebro Machine]]. During one fateful session on the astral plane Jean senses young [[Cyclops (comics)|Scott Summers]] in the orphanage and an aspect of her mind, manifesting in the form of a golden Phoenix raptor, reaches out to him.<ref>{{Cite comic

Marvel editor Jim Shooter, in response to a question about the return of Jean Grey, responded, "Jean Grey is dead".{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} For a while, Marvel stuck to this, although the interview in ''The Untold Story'' shows that Byrne had already given thought to a possible way to revive Jean (although the idea as it existed then was not expanded upon in the interview).

===Return===
A few years later, there was a desire to bring Jean Grey back to life, as part of the launch of the new ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' series. Editorially, it was decreed that this would only be allowed if Jean could be utterly absolved of the evil deeds of the ''Dark Phoenix Saga''.

This absolution begins when the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] find a strange pod lying on the bottom of Jamaica bay, which they send to [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] of the [[Fantastic Four]]. The pod cracks open and Jean emerges, with no memories from the time she flew the shuttle until she hatched from the cocoon, but the truth of Phoenix is now revealed. While dying upon the shuttle, Jean was, in fact, approached by a cosmic psychic entity known as the Phoenix Force, which duplicated Jean's form and merged with a portion of her soul/consciousness,  while Jean herself was sealed in a pod at the bottom of the bay to heal.<ref>{{Cite comic

Scott calls Madelyne to try to persuade her to come to New York. When he receives no answer, he assumes that his wife had left him. In truth, [[Mister Sinister]] kidnapped Madelyne and Nathan. Mr. Sinister had created Madelyne from Jean Grey's DNA, believing the offspring of Jean Grey and Scott Summers would be a genetically superior mutant who possessed incredible powers.

With her purpose fulfilled, Sinister turns Madelyne over to the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]]. The X-Men rescue her and she joins them. Wanting to rescue her son from Mr. Sinister, Madelyne makes a pact with demons, and using her despair, the goblins make her their queen, driving her insane. Madelyne attempts to sacrifice Nathan in a ritual that will bring the demons of Limbo into the world. Madelyne dies in a climactic battle with Jean after she links their minds and wills herself to die—hoping the link will kill Jean as well. Madelyne dies, and then the piece of Jean's consciousness that had merged with the Phoenix Force (which had migrated into Madelyne Pryor upon the death of the Phoenix) returned to Jean, granting her all the memories of both Madelyne and the Dark Phoenix.<ref>{{Cite comic

Later, tricked by [[Xorn]], Wolverine and Phoenix are propelled towards the sun while on [[Asteroid M]]. About to die, Wolverine reluctantly stabs Phoenix so she will not have to die an agonizing death in the intense solar heat. Seconds before they collide with the sun, the Phoenix Force manifests within Jean, and she saves them both. She tells him that by killing her, he helped her release the "Phoenix Consciousness." Arriving on Earth, they battled Xorn (who had revealed himself to be Magneto but would later be [[retroactive continuity|retconned]] into an imposter), who then mortally injures Phoenix by transferring a large amount of electro-magnetic energy to her brain, inducing a "planetary-scale stroke."

{{Main|Here Comes Tomorrow}}
Scott Summers' refusal of Emma Frost's offer to reopen Xavier's Institute after Jean's death creates a future timeline in which [[Beast (comics)|Hank McCoy]] reopens the school. Under the pressure, he takes the drug "''[[List of comic book drugs#Kick|Kick]]''", which is revealed to be the [[Particulate|aerosol]] form of the villain [[Sublime (comics)|Sublime]], who possesses Hank McCoy and drives him insane. 150 years later, the near-immortal Beast tries to resurrect Phoenix and use her to destroy every lifeform on Earth, except for the creatures created by Sublime itself, only to be defeated by Jean. Phoenix then carries out her disinfection and absorbs the future universe into the "''White Hot Room''", a higher [[plane (esotericism)|plane]] of [[reality]] with other Phoenix hosts and 'home' to the consciousness of the Phoenix Force. Jean wears a white variation of her Phoenix outfit and is revealed to be "''a White Phoenix of the [[Sahasrara|Crown]]''". Jean reaches back in time and telepathically urges Scott to live. Instead of refusing Emma and leaving the institute, Scott chooses to be with Emma and keep the Xavier Institute alive.<ref name="HCT">{{Cite comic

===Endsong===
{{Main|X-Men: Phoenix – Endsong}}
The Shi'ar resurrect the Phoenix Force in an attempt to destroy it while it is weak. The Phoenix flees to earth and resurrects Jean in an attempt to make itself whole. Wolverine arrives and the two battle until they find themselves at the North Pole. Wolverine repeatedly kills Jean, weakening her and allowing her to gain control of herself and imprison herself in an iceberg. The Phoenix leaves Jean and takes control of Emma Frost, however Emma is not powerful enough and starts to burn up from controlling it. The X-Men free Jean from her prison with her ripping the Phoenix out from Emma. Jean reveals herself to be one being with the Phoenix saying they are the same and the two merge together once more. This causes her to become Dark Phoenix, but Emma Frost and the Stepford Cuckoos link all the past and present X-Men together to show their love for Jean. This causes Jean to become the White Phoenix and she saves the X-Men from the Shi'ar before returning to the White Hot Room.<ref>''X-Men: Phoenix - Endsong'' #1-5</ref>

}}</ref> Pak also stated that Warsong will lay the groundwork for the future of both Jean and the Phoenix. However the story only featured her telepathic voice talking to the Stepford Cuckoos as they flew over her grave and a flashback in the first issue. The rest of the series involved the Cuckoos encountering the fragment of the Phoenix's consciousness that visited them at the end of the Endsong miniseries. They merge with the fragment and gain Phoenix-level abilities, but later must imprison the Phoenix fragment in their diamond hearts, an ability they manifest after their origins—as cloned daughters of Emma Frost—are revealed.

===X-Men Messiah Complex===
{{Main|X-Men: Messiah Complex}}
Since the events of [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], when most of mutantkind was depowered and no new mutant births occur, mutantkind is on the verge of extinction.  Cerebro then detects [[Hope Summers (comics)|a new mutant baby]] born in Cooperstown, Alaska.  Cerebro detects her and is partially destroyed by a tremendous outburst of power from the child. As the child has aged and grown, she has developed features distinctively similar to Jean Grey, including crimson red hair and green eyes.  As seen in ''Cable'' #5, a closeup of the baby's eyes show twin reflections of the Phoenix emblem in them.

===Sisterhood of Mutants===
Jean's clone, Madelyne Pryor, reappears in her new alias as the Red Queen, incorporeal and seeking to revive Jean Grey's body so that she may possess it and live again.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #503</ref>  The Red Queen forms a Sisterhood of Mutants, consisting of [[Lady Mastermind]], her sister, [[Mastermind (Martinique Jason)|Martinique Jason]], [[Spiral (comics)|Spiral]], [[Chimera (comics)|Chimera]], [[Lady Deathstrike]], and a brainwashed Psylocke, attacking the X-Men at their new base in Graymalkin, with the goal of stealing a lock of Jean's hair that belongs to Wolverine.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #509</ref><ref name=UXM510>''Uncanny X-Men'' #510</ref> During the attack, Lady Mastermind manages to hold Emma Frost within a psychic trap, however in the astral plane, Emma encounters a woman who resembles Jean Grey. Emma believes she is Madelyne, but the woman says that she isn't her, but is often confused to be her. She then uses her powers, a piece of the Phoenix Force, to free Emma from the psychic trap before disappearing.<ref name=UXM510/>  Having retrieved the lock of hair, the Red Queen uses it as a talisman to locate Jean's deceased body and arrives back at Westchester where she attempts to resurrect Jean's body and possess it. Unbeknown to her, [[Domino (comics)|Domino]], under Cyclops' orders, switches the bodies in Jean's grave before Madelyne arrives, and since any body besides Jean's cannot hold Madelyne's essence, the ritual fails and the Red Queen is sucked inside to an unknown fate.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #511</ref>

==Romance==
At the beginning of the series, Jean and Scott harbor a mutual [[Limerence|crush]] for a long time but neither is aware of the other's feelings (though the readers are made aware early on) and both are too shy to make a move. Jean once has a date with [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]], but insists on taking Scott along, which confuses and frustrates both men. For a while, Angel has feelings for Jean which lead to some bad moments between him and Scott. When Jean leaves to pursue [[higher education|tertiary education]] at Metro College, it further widens the gap between Scott and Jean; however, Jean and Scott later date openly. At one point, Professor X seems to have some romantic feelings for her.<ref>{{Cite comic

Jean and Scott's relationship takes a brief step forward when the X-Men temporarily disband.  Jean works as a swimsuit model and Scott works as a radio announcer, and the two "pretend" to date.  After the X-Men reform, there are hints that they are more intimately involved, but the relationship is not "outed" for quite some time.

When Jean "dies" and becomes Phoenix, her relationship with Scott changes because she has changed.  After they are separated in the [[Savage Land]] and each thinks the other is dead, Scott is unable to mourn her, and reasons it's because he no longer loves her.  Yet upon their reunion, to fight [[Proteus (comics)|Proteus]] at [[Muir Island]], the passion and relationship is rekindled.

Phoenix discovers that she can telepathically enhance the powers of other mutants.{{Issue|date=October 2009}} She briefly develops a psychic shadow form like Psylocke's, with a gold Phoenix emblem over her eye instead of the [[Crimson Dawn]] mark possessed by Psylocke, Jean briefly lost her telekinesis to Psylocke during this exchange, but her telekinetic abilities later came back in full at a far stronger level than before.

===Telekinesis===
Her telekinetic strength and skill are both of an extremely high level, capable of grasping objects in Earth orbit and manipulating hundreds of components in mid-air in complex patterns. She uses her telekinesis to often lift herself and others giving her the ability of levitation and flight. She also uses her telekinesis to create durable shields and energy blasts.  She later manifests a "telekinetic sensitivity" (called "the Manifestation of the Phoenix"{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}) to objects in her immediate environment that lets her feel the texture of objects, their molecular patterns, feel when other objects come into contact with them, and probe them at a molecular level.

===Phoenix Force===
When possessed by or bonded with the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]], Jean's powers escalate to an incalculable level, allowing her to rearrange matter at a subatomic level, fly unaided through space, survive in any atmosphere, manipulate electromagnetic and cosmic energies for various effects and atmospheric disturbances. She also demonstrates this sub-molecular telekinetic power to change her Phoenix clothes into a set of street clothes.<ref>http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100516042744/marveldatabase/images/0/04/JeanGreyUXM131p6f2.PNG</ref> At this level, she is powerful enough to easily defeat a herald of Galactus.<ref>http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100512024010/marveldatabase/images/e/ef/JeanGreyUXM105p26f1n2.PNG</ref> She can also create [[Wormhole|stargates]] that can transport her to anywhere in the universe instantaneously.

As the Phoenix, Jean can resurrect herself after death and is unaffected by the passage of time. Though initially perceived as "borrowing" the powers of the Phoenix Force, due to her original status as a host for the Force, they are entirely her own; [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] itself has said that Jean is the rightful owner of those powers.<ref name="Classic43"/> She later becomes one with the Phoenix Force (as opposed to serving as its host) due to her status as an Omega-level mutant with unlimited potential, in which it was revealed that Jean holds the unique role of "White Phoenix of the Crown" among the many past, present, and future hosts of the Phoenix.<ref name="HCT"/> As the White Phoenix, Jean can manipulate and control whole timelines, as seen when she brought the alternate future of ''Here Comes Tomorrow'' into the White-Hot Room.<ref>{{Cite comic

Introduced as a concept during ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #125 (September, 1979), the villain [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]] attempted to turn Grey  into the Black Queen of the modern [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] by creating the illusion that she was living in the body of an ancestor named ''Lady Grey''.

Later, [[Ben Raab]] and [[Charlie Adlard]] revisited the concept and in ''X-Men: Hellfire Club'' #2 (February, 2000) made Lady Grey a real ancestor of the character rather than simply an illusion. Her back story, as recounted by the narrative, places her as an influential member, possibly a Queen, of the [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] branch of the Club during the [[American Revolutionary War]].
