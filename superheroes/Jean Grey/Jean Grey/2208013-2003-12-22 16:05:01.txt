'''Jean Grey''' is a [[comic book]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  She has used the code names '''Marvel Girl''' and '''[[Phoenix (comics)|Phoenix]]''' during her career, and is a member of the [[X-Men]].  Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], she first appeared in ''X-Men'' #1 ([[1963]]).

Grey is a [[mutant]] born with the abilities of [[telepathy]] and [[telekinesis]].

==History==

As a teenager, she began attending [[Professor Charles Xavier]]'s "school for gifted youngsters" and joined the X-Men under the name of Marvel Girl.  During her tenure there, she fell in love with [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]].

Following a mission in space, Grey attempted to pilot a shuttle back to Earth during one of the worst solar storms in history. The shuttle was unshielded and Grey would have died were it not for the intervention of the cosmic entity known as the [[Phoenix (comics)|Phoenix]] force. Though at the time it was believed (and the storyline meant it to be) that the Phoenix imbued Jean with vast cosmic powers, this was later [[retcon]]ned that she was actually placed into a coma in a cocoon in [[Jamaica Bay]] and the Phoenix adopted her identity as a heroine.

Phoenix believed herself to be Grey, and she and Cyclops continued their relationship, until Phoenix lost control of her powers, and eventually committed suicide.  The lengthy story of the decline and fall of Phoenix, by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne]], is regarded as one of the best comics stories of the [[1970s]].

Grey's survival was revealed when the original X-Men formed [[X-Factor]], which she joined when she emerged from her coma.  Cyclops, in the meantime, had married her double (later revealed as her [[clone]]), [[Madelyne Pryor]].  Pryor joined her creator, [[Mr. Sinister]], as the villainous [[Goblin Queen]], and herself died sometime after the founding of X-Factor.

As a result, Cyclops and Grey were able to resume their relationship, and eventually married.

==Movies & Television==

Marvel Girl was a character in the mid-[[1990s]] ''[[X-Men (animated series)|X-Men]]'' animated series, and guest starred on at least one episode of ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'' in the early [[1980s]].

In the ''[[X-Men (movie)|X-Men]]'' film and its sequel ''[[X2]]'', Grey was portrayed by [[Famke Janssen]].
