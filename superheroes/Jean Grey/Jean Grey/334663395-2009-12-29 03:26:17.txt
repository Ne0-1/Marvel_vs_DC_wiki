'''Jean Grey-Summers''' is a [[fiction]]al [[comic book]] [[superhero#superheroines|superheroine]] appearing in books published by [[Marvel Comics]]. She has been known under the aliases '''Marvel Girl'''  and later, '''[[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]]''' and '''Dark Phoenix''', and is best known as one of five original members of the [[X-Men]], for her relationship with husband [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], and for her central role and transformation in the classic X-Men storyline, the "[[The Dark Phoenix Saga|Dark Phoenix Saga]]."

Jean Grey-Summers is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] born with [[Telepathy|telepathic]] and [[Psychokinesis|telekinetic]] powers. Her powers first manifested when she saw her childhood friend being hit by a car. She is a caring, nurturing figure, but she also must deal with being an [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)#Omega-level mutants|Omega-level mutant]] and the physical manifestation of the cosmic [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]]. She faces death several times in the history of the series, first in the classic "Dark Phoenix Saga" but due to her connection with the Phoenix Force, she, as her namesake implies, [[comic book death|rises from death]].

Phoenix is an important figure in the lives of other Marvel universe characters, mostly the X-Men, including her husband Cyclops; her mentor and father-figure [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]]; her close friend and sometimes romantic interest [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]; [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], who is her best friend and a sister-like figure; her daughter [[Rachel Summers]]; her son [[Nate Grey|X-Man]]; and stepson [[Cable (comics)|Cable]].

The character is present for much of the X-Men's history, and she is featured in all three ''X-Men'' [[animation|animated series]] and several video games. [[Famke Janssen]] portrays Jean in the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' films]]. She is a playable character in ''[[X-Men Legends]]'' (2004), ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]'' (2005), and ''[[Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2]]'' (2009), and appears as an enemy in the first ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]''.
In 2006, [[IGN]] rated Jean Grey #6 on their list of Top 25 X-Men from the past forty years.<ref name=IGNTop25>{{cite web

==Publication history==
{{Expand|date=September 2008}}
Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist/co-writer [[Jack Kirby]], Jean first appeared as '''Marvel Girl''' in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' #1 (September 1963).  After her resurrection, she continued with her original teammates, as a part of [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], and later rejoined the [[X-Men]], becoming a mainstay character once more.

==Fictional character biography==
===Background===
Jean Grey was born the daughter of [[Dr. John Grey (comics)|Dr. John Grey]] and [[Elaine Grey]].  Before joining the X-Men, she lived with her family in [[Annandale-on-Hudson, New York]], where Dr. Grey worked as a history [[professor]] at [[Bard College]].

Jean is the only member of her immediate family with mutant abilities (her niece and nephew, [[Joey Bailey|Joey]] and [[Gailyn Bailey|Gailyn]], are also revealed as mutants). Her powers first manifest at the age of ten, prematurely triggered when her best friend, Annie Richards, is hit by a car. As her friend lies dying, Jean instinctively links to her mind and senses what Annie feels when she dies; the trauma of experiencing her friend's death nearly kills Jean as well, but instead leaves her in a coma.

===Help from Xavier===
To rouse her out of her catatonic state, Jean's parents seek the expertise of specialists, of whom only [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]] is able to help. Xavier uses Jean to help locate mutants with his [[Cerebro|Cerebro Machine]]. During one fateful session on the astral plane Jean senses young [[Cyclops (comics)|Scott Summers]] in the orphanage and an aspect of her mind, manifesting in the form of a golden Phoenix raptor, reaches out to him.<ref>{{Cite comic

===Romance===
At the beginning of the series, Jean and Scott harbor a mutual [[Limerence|crush]] for a long time but neither is aware of the other's feelings (though the readers are made aware early on) and both are too shy to make a move. Jean once has a date with [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]], but insists on taking Scott along, which confuses and frustrates both men. For a while, Angel has feelings for Jean which lead to some bad moments between him and Scott. When Jean leaves to pursue [[higher education|tertiary education]] at Metro College, it further widens the gap between Scott and Jean; however, Jean and Scott later date openly. At one point, Professor X seems to have some romantic feelings for her.<ref>{{Cite comic

This forces her to keep his secrets and, at one point, transfer his own power into her.  

Jean and Scott's relationship takes a brief step forward when the X-Men temporarily disband.  Jean works as a swimsuit model and Scott works as a radio announcer, and the two "pretend" to date.  After the X-Men reform, there are hints that they are more intimately involved, but the relationship is not "outed" for quite some time.  

When Jean "dies" and becomes Phoenix, her relationship with Scott changes because she has changed.  After they are separated in the [[Savage Land]] and each thinks the other is dead, Scott is unable to mourn her, and reasons it's because he no longer loves her.  Yet upon their reunion, to fight [[Proteus (comics)|Proteus]] at [[Muir Island]], the passion and relationship is rekindled.  Soon after, they psychically "marry" - joining parts of their minds together in a psychic bond.<ref>{{Cite comic

When [[Wolverine (comics)|Logan]] is introduced as part of the "next generation", he is immediately drawn to her, and harbors a secret love for her.  Through the series, Logan generally respects Jean's choice to be with Scott, and the two share a deep friendship which, despite a powerful emotional and physical attraction, is never consummated. In [[Grant Morrison]]'s ''New X-Men'' stories, Jean increasingly talks to Logan about her marital problems, and Logan tries to help the married couple reconcile, even convincing Jean to return to Scott when Scott has a psychic affair with [[Emma Frost]]. Immediately following Jean's death, Scott begins to date Emma.  Although he does 'honor and respect her', this is due to a psychic suggestion left by Jean to force Scott to move on and "live".

[[John Byrne]], penciller on ''Uncanny X-Men'', had strong feelings against how powerful Phoenix had become and worked with writer [[Chris Claremont]] to effectively remove Phoenix from the storyline, initially by removing her powers. However, Byrne's decision to have Dark Phoenix destroy an inhabited solar system in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #135, coupled with the planned ending to the story arc, worried then-Editor-in-Chief [[Jim Shooter]], who felt that allowing Jean to live at the conclusion of the story was both morally unacceptable (given that she had essentially committed an act of [[genocide]]) and also an unsatisfying ending from a storytelling point of view. Shooter himself publicly laid out his reasoning in a 1984 roundtable with Claremont, Byrne, editors [[Jim Salicrup]] and [[Louise Jones,]] and inker [[Terry Austin (comics)|Terry Austin]]:
<blockquote>
I personally think, and I've said this many times, that having a character destroy an inhabited world with billions of people wipe out a starship and then -- well, you know, having the powers removed and being let go on Earth. It seems to me that that's the same as capturing [[Hitler]] alive and letting him go live on Long Island. Now, I don't think the story would ''end'' there. I think a lot of people would come to his door with machine guns... .<ref>{{Cite comic

</blockquote>
As a result, Shooter requested that Claremont and Byrne rewrite the last chapter of issue #137, to explicitly place in the story both a consequence and an ending commensurate with the enormity of Phoenix's actions. 

The original ending was published in the one-shot ''Phoenix: The Untold Story'' in April, 1984. In the original ending, instead of turning into Phoenix again during the X-Men's battle with the [[Shi'ar]] [[Imperial Guard (comics)|Imperial Guard]], Jean is overpowered and captured. [[Lilandra Neramani|Lilandra]] has Jean subjected to what amounts to a psychic lobotomy, leaving Jean without any of her telepathic or telekinetic powers. The concept that Byrne and Claremont had in mind was that her powers ended up being more or less permanently suppressed, but with the threat always in the shadows of Phoenix returning. In the end, Jean is allowed to return to Earth with the rest of the X-Men, "cured" of the power and madness of Dark Phoenix. The one-shot also reveals the original splash page drawn for ''Uncanny X-Men'' #138, which shows Jean and Scott in a happier time, contrasted with the splash page actually published in issue #138 that shows Jean's funeral.

Marvel editor Jim Shooter, in response to a question about the return of Jean Grey, responded, "Jean Grey is dead".{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} For a while, Marvel stuck to this, although the interview in ''The Untold Story'' shows that Byrne had already given thought to a possible way to revive Jean (although the idea as it existed then was not expanded upon in the interview).

===Return===
A few years later, there was a desire to bring Jean Grey back to life, as part of the launch of the new ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' series. Editorially, it was decreed that this would only be allowed if Jean could be utterly absolved of the evil deeds of the ''Dark Phoenix Saga''. 

This absolution begins when the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] find a strange pod lying on the bottom of Jamaica bay, which they send to [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] of the [[Fantastic Four]]. The pod cracks open and Jean emerges, with no memories from the time she flew the shuttle until she hatched from the cocoon, but the truth of Phoenix is now revealed. While dying upon the shuttle, Jean was, in fact, approached by a cosmic psychic entity known as the Phoenix Force, which duplicated Jean's form and merged with a portion of her soul/consciousness,  while Jean herself was sealed in a pod at the bottom of the bay to heal.<ref>{{Cite comic

===Inferno===

Scott calls Madelyne to try to persuade her to come to New York. When he receives no answer, he assumes that his wife had left him. In truth, [[Mister Sinister]] kidnapped Madelyne and Nathan. Mr. Sinister had created Madelyne from Jean Grey's DNA, believing the offspring of Jean Grey and Scott Summers would be a genetically superior mutant who possessed incredible powers.

With her purpose fulfilled, Sinister turns Madelyne over to the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]]. The X-Men rescue her and she joins them. Wanting to rescue her son from Mr. Sinister, Madelyne makes a pact with demons, and using her despair, the goblins make her their queen, driving her insane. Madelyne attempts to sacrifice Nathan in a ritual that will bring the demons of Limbo into the world. Madelyne dies in a climactic battle with Jean after she links their minds and wills herself to die—hoping the link will kill Jean as well. Madelyne dies, and then the piece of Jean's consciousness that had merged with the Phoenix Force (which had migrated into Madelyne Pryor upon the death of the Phoenix) returned to Jean, granting her all the memories of both Madelyne and the Dark Phoenix.<ref>{{Cite comic

Scott Summers' refusal of Emma Frost's offer to reopen Xavier's Institute after Jean's death creates a future timeline in which [[Beast (comics)|Hank McCoy]] reopens the school. Under the pressure, he takes the drug "''[[List of comic book drugs#kick|Kick]]''", which is revealed to be the [[Particulate|aerosol]] form of the villain [[Sublime (comics)|Sublime]], who possesses Hank McCoy and drives him insane. 150 years later, the near-immortal Beast tries to resurrect Phoenix and use her to destroy every lifeform on Earth, except for the creatures created by Sublime itself, only to be defeated by Jean. Phoenix then carries out her disinfection and absorbs the future universe into the "''White Hot Room''", a higher [[plane (esoterism)|plane]] of [[reality]] with other Phoenix hosts and 'home' to the consciousness of the Phoenix Force. Jean wears a white variation of her Phoenix outfit and is revealed to be "''a White Phoenix of the [[Sahasrara|Crown]]''". Jean reaches back in time and telepathically urges Scott to live. Instead of refusing Emma and leaving the institute, Scott chooses to be with Emma and keep the Xavier Institute alive.<ref name="HCT">{{Cite comic

Wolverine repeatedly kills Jean, weakening her and allowing her to gain control of herself and imprison herself in an iceberg. The Phoenix leaves Jean and takes control of Emma Frost, however Emma is not powerful enough and starts to burn up from controlling it. The X-Men free Jean from her prison with her ripping the Phoenix out from Emma. Jean reveals herself to be one being with the Phoenix saying they are the same and the two merge together once more. This causes her to become Dark Phoenix, but Emma Frost and the Stepford Cuckoos link all the past and present X-Men together to show their love for Jean. This causes Jean to become the White Phoenix and she saves the X-Men from the Shi'ar before returning to the White Hot Room.<ref>''X-Men: Phoenix - Endsong'' #1-5</ref>

}}</ref> Pak also stated that Warsong will lay the groundwork for the future of both Jean and the Phoenix. However the story only featured her telepathic voice talking to the Stepford Cuckoos as they flew over her grave and a flashback in the first issue. The rest of the series involved the Cuckoos encountering the fragment of the Phoenix's consciousness that visited them at the end of the Endsong miniseries. They merge with the fragment and gain Phoenix-level abilities, but later must imprison the Phoenix fragment in their diamond hearts, an ability they manifest after their origins—as cloned daughters of Emma Frost—are revealed.

===X-Men Messiah Complex===
{{Main|X-Men: Messiah Complex}}
Since the events of [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], when most of mutantkind was depowered and no new mutant births occur, mutantkind is on the verge of extinction.  Cerebro then detects [[Hope Summers (comics)|a new mutant baby]] born in Cooperstown, Alaska.  Cerebro detects her and is partially destroyed by a tremendous outburst of power from the child. As the child has aged and grown, she has developed features distinctively similar to Jean Grey, including crimson red hair and green eyes.  As seen in ''Cable'' #5, a closeup of the baby's eyes show twin reflections of the Phoenix emblem in them.

===Sisterhood of Mutants===
Jean's clone Madelyne Pryor has reappeared in her new alias as the Red Queen.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #503</ref>.The Red Queen forms a Sisterhood of Mutants, consisting of [[Lady Mastermind]], her sister, [[Martinique Jason]], [[Spiral (comics)|Spiral]], [[Chimera (comics)|Chimera]], [[Lady Deathstrike]] and a brainwashed [[Psylocke]], attacking the X-Men at their new base in Graymalkin.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #509</ref> Lady Mastermind manages to hold Emma Frost within a psychic trap, however in the Astral Plane Emma is confronted by a woman who has a striking resemblance to Jean Grey. Emma calls her Maddie but the woman says that she isn't Maddie but often confused to be her. Jean then uses her powers to free Emma from the psychic trap before disappearing. The Red Queen's goal is revealed to be her taking a lock of Jean's hair that belongs to Wolverine.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #510</ref> The Red Queen uses the lock of hair as a talisman to locate Jean's deceased body and arrives back at Westchester where she attempts to resurrect Jean's body and possess it.

==Powers and abilities==
Jean Grey is an [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)#omega-level mutants|Omega-level mutant]], and is one of the physical hosts of the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]].

When her powers first manifest, Jean is unable to cope with her [[telepathy]], forcing [[Professor X]] to suppress her access to it altogether. Instead, he chooses to train her in the use of her [[telekinesis]] while allowing her telepathy to grow at its natural rate before reintroducing it.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} This is why in Jean's debut appearance as Marvel Girl, she is only capable of using her telekinetic powers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} When the Professor hides to prepare for the [[List of alien races in Marvel Comics#Z|Z'Nox]], he reopens Jean's telepathic powers, which was initially explained as Xavier 'sharing' some of his telepathy with her.<ref>{{Cite comic

Jean's telepathy allows her to read, influence, control, and communicate with the minds of others, project her mind into the [[astral plane]], and generate telepathic force blasts that can stun or kill others.

Her telekinetic strength and skill are both of an extremely high level, capable of grasping objects in Earth orbit and manipulating hundreds of components in mid-air in complex patterns. She uses her telekinesis to often lift herself and others giving her the ability of levitation and flight. She also uses her telekinesis to construct various objects out of telekinetic energy as well as powerful shields and energy blasts.

When Jean absorbs [[Psylocke]]'s specialized telepathic powers, her own telepathy is increased to the point that she can physically manifest her telepathy as a psionic [[phoenix (mythology)|firebird]] whose claws can inflict both physical and mental damage.  Phoenix discovers that she can telepathically enhance the powers of other mutants.{{Issue|date=October 2009}} She briefly develops a psychic shadow form like Psylocke's, with a gold Phoenix emblem over her eye instead of the [[Crimson Dawn]] mark possessed by Psylocke. Jean briefly lost her telekinesis to Psylocke after this, but the Phoenix Force recreated those powers for her at a far stronger level than before.

The [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]] can revive, absorb, rechannel, and preserve the life-force of any kind of life-form, meaning that she can take life energy from one person and give it to others, heal herself with the same life energy, or even resurrect the dead, since the Phoenix is the sum of all life and death{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}. As Phoenix, Jean's powers escalate to an incalculable level: allowing her to rearrange matter at a subatomic level, fly unaided through space, survive in any atmosphere, manipulate electromagnetic and cosmic energies for various effects and atmospheric disturbances.

She manifests a "telekinetic sensitivity" (called "the Manifestation of the Phoenix"{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}) to objects in her immediate environment that lets her feel the texture of objects, their molecular patterns, feel when other objects come into contact with them, and probe them at a molecular level. She can also create [[Wormhole|stargates]] that can transport her to anywhere in the universe instantaneously.  As the Phoenix, Jean can resurrect herself after death and is unaffected by the passage of time. Though initially perceived as "borrowing" the powers of the Phoenix Force, due to original status as a host for the Force, they are entirely her own; [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] itself has said that Jean is the rightful owner of those powers.<ref name="Classic43"/> Further evolution allowed her to actually become one with the Phoenix Force (as opposed to serving as its host) due to her status as an Omega-level mutant with unlimited potential, in which it was revealed that Jean was the White Phoenix of the Crown.<ref name="HCT"/> As the White Phoenix, Jean can manipulate and control whole timelines, as seen when she brought the alternate future of ''Here Comes Tomorrow'' into the White-Hot Room.<ref>{{Cite comic

Jean Grey is also a college graduate from Metro College with select a education in [[psychology]].

==Ancestry==

Introduced as a concept during ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #125 (September, 1979), the villain [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]] attempted to turn Grey  into the Black Queen of the modern Hellfire Club by creating the illusion that she was living in the body of an ancestor named ''Lady Grey''.  

Later, [[Ben Raab]] and [[Charlie Adlard]] revisited the concept and in ''X-Men: Hellfire Club'' #2 (February, 2000) made Lady Grey a real ancestor of the character rather than simply an illusion. Her back story, as recounted by the narrative, places her as an influential member, possibly a Queen, of the [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] branch of the Club during the American Revolutionary War.

==Other versions==
