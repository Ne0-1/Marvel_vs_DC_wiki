[[image:jean-bigcostume3.gif|thumb|left|175px|Marvel Girl.]] '''Jean Grey''' is a [[comic book]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  She has used the code names '''Marvel Girl''' and '''[[Phoenix (comics)|Phoenix]]''' during her career, and is a member of the [[X-Men]].  Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], she first appeared in ''X-Men'' #1 ([[1963]]).

Jean Grey is a [[Mutant (fictional)|mutant]] born with the abilities of [[telepathy]] and [[psychokinesis|telekinesis]].

==Fictional biography==

As a [[teenager]], she began attending [[Professor Charles Xavier]]'s "school for gifted youngsters" and joined the X-Men under the name of Marvel Girl.  During her tenure there, she fell in love with [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]].

Following a mission in space, Grey attempted to pilot a shuttle back to Earth during one of the worst solar storms in history. The shuttle was unshielded and Grey would have died were it not for the intervention of the cosmic entity known as the [[Phoenix (comics)|Phoenix]] force. Though at the time it was believed (and the storyline meant it to be) that the Phoenix imbued Jean with vast cosmic powers, this was later [[retcon]]ned that she was actually placed into a coma in a cocoon in [[Jamaica Bay]] and the Phoenix adopted her identity as a heroine.

Phoenix believed herself to be Grey, and she and Cyclops continued their relationship, until Phoenix lost control of her powers, and eventually committed suicide.  ''The Dark Phoenix Saga'', the lengthy story of the decline and fall of Phoenix, by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne]], is regarded as one of the best comics stories of the [[1970s]].

Grey's survival was revealed when the original X-Men formed [[X-Factor]], which she joined when she emerged from her coma.  Cyclops, in the meantime, had married her double (later revealed as her [[clone]]), [[Madelyne Pryor]].  When Scott left Pryor for Jean, she felt distraught betrayed and became corrupted by goblins, becoming the Goblin Queen. She died in battle with Jean after she (becoming suicidal upon the discovery of being a clone) linked their minds together and killed herself, hoping the link would kill Jean as well (it didn't.)

As a result, Cyclops and Grey were able to resume their relationship, and eventually [[marriage|married]].  Shortly thereafter, she resumed using the name Phoenix as an attempt to redeem both the entity and herself in her mind, and also to honor her "daughter" from a future [[parallel world]], [[Rachel Summers]], who at the time was believed to be dead.  Later, she assumed the role of the Headmistress of the [[Xavier Institute]].

Art by Ethan Van Sciver.]] A combination of Jean's new duties as headmistress, her re-emerging Phoenix powers, and Scott's temporary merger with the evil mutant [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] drove a wedge between the couple. [[The White Queen|Emma Frost]] took advantage of this, initiating an affair with Cyclops and falling in love with him. When Jean walked in on the two in bed, a big psychic fight erupted between the two telepaths where Jean demanded to know what was going on. This led to Cyclops briefly walking out on both Jean and the X-Men.  Upon his return, someone in the guise of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] attacked the X-Men, and killed Jean Grey. As she died in Scott's arms, she told him she forgave him.

In a dark future 150 years down the line, Grey is revived as an even more powerful version of Phoenix.  While she removed that possible future from existence, it is not clear whether Grey is still "alive" in any sense in the present.
