'''Jean Grey-Summers''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]], a [[comic book]] [[superheroine]] who appears in comic books published by [[Marvel Comics]]. She has been known under the aliases '''[[Marvel Girl]]''', '''[[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]]''', and '''Dark Phoenix''' and is best known as one of the founding members of the [[X-Men]], for her relationship with [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], and for her central role and transformation in the ''X-Men'' storyline "[[The Dark Phoenix Saga]]".

Jean Grey is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] born with [[Telepathy|telepathic]] and [[Psychokinesis|telekinetic]] powers. Her powers first manifested when she saw her childhood friend being hit by a car. She is a caring, nurturing figure, but she also has to deal with being an [[Omega-level mutant]] and the physical manifestation of the cosmic [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]]. She has faced death numerous times in the history of the series, the first being when, in her guise as Marvel Girl, she died and was "reborn" as Phoenix, which in time led to her second - though not last - death in the "Dark Phoenix Saga".

Jean is an important figure in the lives of other Marvel Universe characters, mostly the X-Men, including her husband Cyclops; her mentor and father figure [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]]; her close friend and sometimes romantic interest [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]; her best friend and sister-like figure [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]]; and her genetic children [[Rachel Summers]], [[Nate Grey|X-Man]], [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], and [[Stryfe]].

The character was present for much of the X-Men's history, and she was featured in all three ''X-Men'' [[animation|animated series]] and several video games. [[Famke Janssen]] portrayed Jean in the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' films]]. She is a playable character in ''[[X-Men Legends]]'' (2004), ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]'' (2005), ''[[Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2]]'' (2009), ''[[Marvel vs Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds]]'' (2011), and ''[[Marvel Heroes (video game)|Marvel Heroes]]'' (2013), and appeared as an enemy in the first ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]''.

In 2006, [[IGN]] rated Jean Grey #6 on their list of Top 25 X-Men from the past forty years,<ref name=IGNTop25>{{cite web

==Publication history==

===Debut (1960s)===
Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist/co-writer [[Jack Kirby]], Jean first appeared as '''Marvel Girl''' in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' #1 (September 1963). As the original team's sole female member, Marvel Girl was a regular part of the team through the series' publication. Initially possessing the ability of telekinesis, the character was later granted the power of telepathy,<ref>{{Cite comic

This new identity and immense abilities eventually resulted in Jean becoming overwhelmed and corrupted by her god-like powers after a failed attempt by the villainous group called the Hellfire Club to control her mind. She transformed into a force of total destruction; now called '''Dark Phoenix''', she consumed a star, inadvertently killing the inhabitants of the star's planetary system, and jeopardized the entire universe. Eventually, in a regained moment of mental clarity, Jean committed suicide to ensure the universe's, and her fellow X-Men's, safety.

The storyline in which Jean Grey died as Marvel Girl and was reborn as Phoenix (''Uncanny X-Men'' [vol. 1] #101-108, 1976–1977) has been retroactively dubbed by fans "The Phoenix Saga", and the storyline of her eventual corruption and death as Dark Phoenix (''Uncanny X-Men'', vol. 1 #129-138, 1980) has been termed "[[The Dark Phoenix Saga]]". This storyline is one of the most well-known and heavily referenced in mainstream American superhero comics, and is widely considered a classic, including Jean Grey's suicidal sacrifice.<ref name="Epic">{{cite news|url=http://austin.culturemap.com/newsdetail/07-05-12-11-53-assemble-true-believers-legendary-x-men-comic-book-writer-chris-claremont-emerges-at-dragons-lair/|title=Assemble, true believers: Legendary X-Men comic book writer Chris Claremont emerges at Dragon's Lair|last=Graupman|first=Michael|date=July 12, 2012|publisher=http://austin.culturemap.com/|accessdate=30 July 2011 }}</ref><ref name="Classic">{{cite news|url=http://thestar.com.my/lifestyle/story.asp?file=/2012/7/13/lifebookshelf/11637153&sec=lifebookshelf|title=Showdown Supreme|last=Rahan|first=Kaleon|date=July 13, 2012|publisher=http://thestar.com.my|accessdate=30 July 2011 }}</ref><ref name="Claremont">{{cite news|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/blogs/books/2012-07-14/chris-claremont-dead-should-mean-dead/|title=Chris Claremont: Dead Should Mean Dead—'X-Men' mastermind talks the Phoenix and the flame|last=Whittaker|first=Richard|date=July 14, 2012|publisher=http://www.austinchronicle.com/|accessdate=30 July 2011 }}</ref>

When the first [[trade paperback]] of "The Dark Phoenix Saga" was published in 1984, Marvel also published a 48-page special issue titled ''Phoenix: The Untold Story.'' It contained the original version of ''Uncanny X-Men'' #137, the original splash page for ''Uncanny X-Men'' #138, and transcripts of a [[Round table (discussion)|roundtable discussion]] between Shooter, Claremont, Byrne, editors [[Jim Salicrup]] and [[Louise Simonson|Louise Jones]], and inker [[Terry Austin (comics)|Terry Austin]] about the creation of the new Phoenix persona, the development of the story, and what led to its eventual change, and Claremont and Byrne's plans for Jean Grey had she survived.<ref name="Deeley">[http://www.comicsbulletin.com/soapbox/99272726322238.htm ] {{Dead link|date=November 2013}}</ref>

Claremont revealed that his and Cockrum's motivation for Jean Grey's transformation into Phoenix was to create "the first female cosmic hero".<ref name="DPT"/> The two hoped that, like [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] had been integrated into ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' lineup, Phoenix would also become an effective and immensely powerful member of the X-Men. However, both Salicrup and Byrne had strong feelings against how powerful Phoenix had become, feeling that she drew too much focus in the book.<ref name="DPT"/> Byrne worked with Claremont to effectively remove Phoenix from the storyline, initially by removing her powers. However, Byrne's decision to have Dark Phoenix destroy an inhabited planetary system in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #135, coupled with the planned ending to the story arc, worried then-Editor-in-Chief [[Jim Shooter]], who felt that allowing Jean to live at the conclusion of the story was both morally unacceptable (given that she was now a "mass murderer")<ref name="Deeley"/> and also an unsatisfying ending from a storytelling point of view.<ref name="Deeley"/> Shooter publicly laid out his reasoning in the 1984 roundtable:
<blockquote>
I personally think, and I've said this many times, that having a character destroy an inhabited world with billions of people, wipe out a starship and then—well, you know, having the powers removed and being let go on Earth. It seems to me that that's the same as capturing [[Hitler]] alive and letting him go live on Long Island. Now, I don't think the story would ''end'' there. I think a lot of people would come to his door with machine guns...<ref name="DPT">{{Cite comic

</blockquote>
One of the creative team's questions that affected the story's conclusion was whether the Phoenix's personality and later descent into madness and evil were inherent to Jean Grey or if the Phoenix was itself an entity merely possessing her.<ref name="DPT"/> The relationship between Jean Grey and the Phoenix would continue to be subject to different interpretations and explanations by writers and editors at Marvel Comics following the story's [[retcon]] in 1986. At the time of the Dark Phoenix's creation, Byrne felt that, "If someone could be seen to corrupt Jean, rather than her just turning bad, this could make for an interesting story."<ref name="XEffectByrne">{{cite web |first=Jeffrey |last=Klaehn |url=http://www.graphicnovelreporter.com/content/x-effect-interview-john-byrne-interview |title=The X-Effect: An Interview with John Byrne |work=Creator Interviews |publisher=Graphic Novel Reporter |date= |accessdate=January 17, 2011| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5mquoVLkj | archivedate = 2010-01-17| deadurl=no}}</ref> Salicrup and Byrne stated later that they viewed Phoenix as an entity that entirely possessed Jean Grey, therefore absolving her of its crimes once it was driven out.<ref name="DPT"/> However, the creative and editorial team ultimately agreed that Phoenix had been depicted as an inherent and inseparable aspect of Jean Grey, meaning that the character was fully responsible for her actions as Phoenix. As a result, Shooter ordered that Claremont and Byrne rewrite issue #137 to explicitly place in the story both a consequence and an ending commensurate with the enormity of Phoenix's actions.<ref name="DPT"/> In a 2012 public signing, Claremont spoke about the context of the late 1970s and the end of the [[Vietnam War]] during the story's writing, stating that the history of these events also made Jean Grey's genocidal actions difficult to redeem.<ref name="Claremont"/>

In the original ending, Jean does not revert to Dark Phoenix, and the Shi'ar subject her to a "psychic lobotomy", permanently removing all her telepathic or telekinetic powers.<ref name="DPT"/> Claremont and Byrne planned to later have Magneto offer Jean the chance to restore her abilities, but Jean choosing to remain depowered and eliminate the threat of Dark Phoenix returning to power.<ref name="DPT"/>

Jean Grey was reintroduced in Marvel Comics six years after the publication of "The Dark Phoenix Saga" in ''Avengers'' #263 (January 1986) and was revived in ''Fantastic Four'' #286 (January 1986), with the events of "The Dark Phoenix Saga" [[retcon]]ned. The new version of events was that rather than being Jean Grey reborn, Phoenix was actually an entirely separate entity posing as Jean. The new events state that while near-death in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #100, Jean made contact with a cosmic entity called the "[[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]]".<ref name="FF286">{{Cite comic

Busiek later found out that his idea had been used thanks to Layton, and he was credited in ''Fantastic Four'' #286 and paid for his contributions.<ref name="Busiek"/> The decision to revive Jean Grey was controversial among fans, with some appreciating the return of the character and others feeling it weakened the impact of the "Dark Phoenix Saga"'s ending.<ref name="Busiek"/> Busiek maintained that the idea that led to Jean Grey's official return to Marvel Comics was merely a case of sharing his ideas with friends as a fan, and that he neither formally pitched the idea to anyone nor gave it the final go ahead.<ref name="Busiek"/> Claremont expressed dissatisfaction with the retcon, stating in 2012: "We’d just gone to all the effort of saying, 'Jean is dead, get over it,' and they said, 'Haha, we fibbed.'

In the comics, having been fully established as separate from the "Jean Grey" copy created and taken over by the Phoenix Force, Jean is "absolved" of involvement in the atrocities of "The Dark Phoenix" storyline, and she returned in the first issue of ''X-Factor'' (1st Series) only to find that the other members of the original X-Men have retired.<ref name="XFT1">{{Cite comic

Claremont later commented on how Jean's revival affected his original plans for Madelyne Pryor, stating that the relationship between the two women was intended to be entirely coincidental.<ref name="SerieJournalen">Kristiansen, Ulrik & Rensenf, Tue S. [http://www.seriejournalen.dk/tegneserie_indhold.asp?art=&ID=32 "Interview with Chris Claremont" Serie Journalen (May 1, 1996).]{{dead link|date=July 2011}} Accessed July 9, 2010.</ref> He intended Madelyne only to look like Jean by complete coincidence and exist as a means for Cyclops to move on with his life and be written out of the ''X-Men'' franchise, part of what he believed to be a natural progression for any member of the team.<ref name="SerieJournalen"/> Claremont expressed dismay that Jean's resurrection ultimately resulted in Cyclops abandoning his wife and child, tarnishing his written persona as a hero and "decent human being", and the "untenable situation" with Madelyne was dealt with by transforming her into a [[prolicide|prolicidal]] demonic villain and killing her off.<ref name="SerieJournalen"/>

Soon after the beginning publication of ''X-Factor'', Marvel also reprinted and released the original ''X-Men'' series under the title "''Classic X-Men''". These reissues paired the original stories with new vignettes, elaborating on plot points. One such issue, ''Classic X-Men'' #8 (April 1987), paired the original ''X-Men'' #100 (August 1976) story of Jean Grey's disastrous return flight from space immediately preceding her transformation into Phoenix ("Love Hath No X-Man...") with the new story "Phoenix". The story further supported the retcon establishing Jean Grey and the Phoenix Force as two separate entities. The vignette elaborated on the events between ''X-Men'' #100 and ''X-Men'' #101: facing certain death from radiation poisoning, Jean Grey cried out for help to save the lives of her fellow X-Men. Hearing her cry and sensing her intense passion for life and love for Scott and her friends, the Phoenix Force—the "sum and substance of life"—responded, offering to save her by bonding to her, coupling her humanity with its incredible power. Jean accepted and immediately found her consciousness in a duplicated body. She placed her former dying body, still containing a spark of her soul, in a healing cocoon. The duplicate, now calling itself Phoenix, proceeded to the events depicted in the original ''X-Men'' #101 (October 1976) story "Like A Phoenix, From The Ashes!" with the cocoon sinking to the bottom of Jamaica Bay to be discovered in ''Avengers'' #263.<ref name="CLSX8"/>

During the ''Revolution'' event, all ''X-Men'' titles began six months after the events of ''Apocalypse: the Twelve'', allowing writers to create fresh situations and stories and gradually fill in the missing events of the previous six months of continuity. Due to editing decisions following the success of the 2000 ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'' film, which depicted the character of Jean Grey with both telepathy and telekinesis, an explanation for Jean's altered powers in the comics was never explicitly made, though writer Chris Claremont revealed in interviews that it was intended to be an accidental power switch between fellow X-Man [[Psylocke]], explaining Psylocke's new telekinetic powers as well.

Jean was next featured in the six-issue miniseries ''[[X-Men Forever]]'' written by [[Fabian Nicieza]], which was designed to tie up remaining plot lines. During the series, Jean revisited many of the events involving the Phoenix Force and the series introduced the concept of "Omega level mutants", a category for mutants with unlimited potential, which included Jean herself.<ref name="XMFRV">{{Cite comic

Instead, he chooses to train her in the use of her [[psychokinesis|telekinesis]] while allowing her telepathy to grow at its natural rate before reintroducing it.<ref>{{Cite comic

Jean's telepathy allows her to read, influence, control, and communicate with the minds of others, project her mind into the [[astral plane]], and generate telepathic force blasts that can stun or kill others.

===Telekinesis===
Her telekinetic strength and skill are both of a supremely high power-level, capable of grasping objects in Earth orbit and manipulating hundreds of components in mid-air in complex patterns. She often uses her telekinesis to lift herself and others, giving her the ability of levitation and flight. She uses her telekinesis to create durable shields and energy blasts. She later manifests a "telekinetic sensitivity" (called "the Manifestation of the Phoenix"<ref name="NWXMNOMN"/>) to objects in her immediate environment that lets her feel the texture and molecular patterns of objects, feel when other objects come into contact with them, and probe them at a molecular or subatomic level.

===Phoenix Force===
When transformed into Phoenix, Jean's powers escalate to a considerably higher level, allowing her to rearrange or disintegrate matter at a subatomic level, fly unaided through space, survive in any atmosphere, and manipulate electromagnetic and cosmic energies for various effects and atmospheric disturbances. She can create [[Wormhole|stargates]] that can transport her anywhere in the universe instantaneously. At this level, she is powerful enough to easily defeat a herald of [[Galactus]].<ref>http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100512024010/marveldatabase/images/e/ef/JeanGreyUXM105p26f1n2.PNG</ref>

Jean, while acting as a Phoenix Force avatar, can create 'cosmic' flames, even in seemingly impossible situations such as the vacuum of space or underwater. Typically they manifest as a raptor or part of a raptor such as a claw or wings. Jean has perfect control over these flames, and they only consume what she wills, and these flames do not require oxygen to burn, and burn so intensely that matter is consumed without by-products such as ash. It is unclear whether these flames are an extension of her telekinesis and telepathy or a more general property of the Phoenix Force. The cosmic flames are a literal punctuation to the Phoenix's purpose to "burn away what doesn't work", as well as being described as "burning through lies" and deception.

As the Phoenix, Jean is able to resurrect after death. In some depictions, these resurrections are immediately after she is killed, while other depictions indicate that resurrection must occur at a "correct" time, sometimes taking a century. The Phoenix Force allows Jean to revive, absorb, rechannel, and preserve the life-force of any kind of life-form, meaning that she can take life energy from one person and give it to others, heal herself with the same life energy, or even resurrect the dead, since the Phoenix is the sum of all life and death.<ref name="Classic43"/>

The relationship between Jean Grey and the Phoenix (and the nature of the powers she has) is portrayed in a variety of ways throughout the character's history. In the initial plotline of the Phoenix being a manifestation of Jean's true potential, these powers are considered her own,<ref name="Classic43"/> as part of Claremont and Byrne's desire to create "the first cosmic superheroine."<ref name="DPT"/> However, since the retcon of the Phoenix as a separate entity from Jean Grey, depictions of these powers vary; these include Jean being one of many hosts to the Phoenix and "borrowing" its "Phoenix powers" during this time,<ref name="NWXMNOMN"/><ref name="XFT50">{{Cite comic
