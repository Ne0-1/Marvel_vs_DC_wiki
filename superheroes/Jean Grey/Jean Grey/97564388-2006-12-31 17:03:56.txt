'''Jean Grey''' is a [[fictional]] [[Superhero|superheroine]] who lives in the {{Marvel Universe}}. Using the codenames '''Marvel Girl''' and later '''Phoenix''', Jean Grey is best known as a member of the [[X-Men]]. Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist/co-writer [[Jack Kirby]], she first appears in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' #1 (September 1963).

Jean Grey is a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] born with vast [[Telepathy|telepathic]] and [[Psychokinesis|telekinetic]] powers. She is a caring, nurturing figure, but she also must deal with being an [[Omega-level mutant]] and the physical manifestation of the cosmic [[Phoenix (comics)|Phoenix Force]]. She faces death several times in the history of the series, first in the classic "[[Dark Phoenix Saga]]," but due to her connection with the Phoenix Force, she, as her namesake implies, [[comic book death|rises from death]].

Jean is an important figure in the lives of [[Professor X]], [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], and her husband [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]]. She is present for much of the X-Men's history, and she is featured in both ''X-Men'' [[animation|animated series]] and several video games. [[Famke Janssen]] portrays Jean Grey in the [[X-Men (film)|''X-Men'' films]].

==Fictional character history==
===Origin===
[[Jean Grey]] is the daughter of Dr. John Grey and Elaine Grey and has an older sister named [[Sara Grey]]. Before joining the X-Men, she lived with her family in [[Annandale-on-Hudson]], [[New York]], where Dr. Grey worked as a history [[professor]] at [[Bard College]].

Jean is the only member of her family with mutant abilities. Her powers first manifest at the age of ten, prematurely triggered when her best friend, Annie Richards, is hit by a car. As her friend lies dying, Jean instinctively links to her mind; the trauma of experiencing her friend's death nearly kills Jean as well, but instead leaves her in a coma.

Jean's parents seek the expertise of specialists to rouse her out of her catatonic state, of which only [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]] is able to help. Xavier realizes that Jean's young mind cannot yet cope with her abilities, so he telepathically blocks her access to them, allowing her powers to evolve at a more natural pace. Jean develops her telekinetic powers at the age of 13. As a [[teenager]], Jean leaves her parents to attend Xavier's [[X-Mansion|School for Gifted Youngsters]] and, using the codename "Marvel Girl", becomes the first female X-Man. <ref>''X-Men'' (Vol. 1) #1, 1963</ref>

===Romance===
Jean and [[Cyclops (comics)|Scott]] have a mutual [[crush]], but neither is aware of the other's feelings and both are too shy to make a move. Jean once has a date with [[Archangel (comics)|Angel]], but insists on taking Scott along, which confuses and frustrates both men. For a while, Angel had feelings for Jean which led to some bad moments between him and Scott. When Jean leaves to pursue [[tertiary education]] at Metro College, it further widens the gap between Scott and Jean; however, Jean and Scott later date openly. Professor X seems to have some romantic feelings for Jean Grey in the beginning of the X-Men series, in the same issue Scott is first shown to have feelings for her.<ref>''X-Men'' (Vol. 1) #3, 1964</ref> However, he believes that she could not reciprocate because he is a paraplegic; therefore he says nothing of it. This storyline is soon abandoned, in favour of the one involving Jean and Scott, who ultimately marry.{{fact}}

Jean is also drawn to [[Wolverine (comics)|Logan]], who cares deeply for her. Logan generally respects Jean's choice to be with Scott, and the two share a deep friendship which, despite emotional and physical attraction, doesn't affect her feelings toward her husband. In [[Grant Morrison]]'s ''New X-Men'' stories, Jean increasingly talks to Logan about her marital problems, and Logan tries to help the married couple reconcile, even convincing Jean to return to Scott when Scott has an affair with [[Emma Frost]]. In some comics the two had an affair, but Jean left him.

===Phoenix===
[[Image:UncannyXMen101.jpg|150px|Cover to ''Uncanny X-Men'' #101. Art by Dave Cockrum.|thumb]]
After Xavier recruits a new team of X-Men to help save the others from [[Krakoa]]<ref>''Giant-Size X-Men'' #1, 1975</ref>, most senior members leave, including Jean. Scott feels that he belongs only with the X-Men, and this upsets Jean. She remains in contact with the X-Men and becomes good friends with Ororo Munroe ([[Storm (comics)|Storm]]).

While Jean and Scott are having a romantic evening in [[Manhattan]],<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #98, 1992</ref>  they, [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], and [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], are abducted by [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]]. They are taken to an abandoned [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] orbital platform under the command of the anti-mutant activist Steven Lang, who is plotting to unleash a new generation of Sentinels. The other X-Men rescue them. During the space station's destruction,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #100, 1992</ref>  the X-Men find that their shuttle has been damaged in an earlier fight with the Sentinels. The X-Men decide that someone must stay at the controls and pilot the ship, while everyone else remains in the shuttle's heavily-shielded life cell. Knowing no one else could survive long enough to pilot the shuttle to safety, Jean uses her telepathy to learn how to pilot the shuttle and her telekinesis to block the radiation as she pilots the ship back to Earth. Her telekinetic shields give way under the onslaught of the intense radiation. The strain of holding the solar radiation at bay with her powers destroys the psychic shields Xavier placed in her mind as a child, and Jean assumes her ultimate potential as a psychic, becoming an entity of pure thought. The shuttle crashes into a bay, and Jean telekinetically reforms her body and emerges from the water. Taking the code-name of [[Phoenix (comics)|Phoenix]], Jean's psi-powers are now vastly stronger, and she manifests a fiery bird-shaped energy aura whenever she used her powers to their fullest extent.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #101-108</ref>

In the '''"[[Dark Phoenix Saga]]"''', [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]] tampers with Jean's mind, and she loses control of her powers and becomes the [[Dark Phoenix]], attacking her friends and teammates and destroying a populated solar system's star. Jean regains her sanity long enough to commit suicide rather than risk becoming the Dark Phoenix again and killing anyone else.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #129-138</ref>

In the original plot, Jean Grey survives, but editorial concerns led to a re-write of the ending of ''Uncanny X-Men'' issue #137. The original ending, as well as an explanation for the changes, was published in the one-shot ''Phoenix: The Untold Story''. In the original ending, instead of turning into Phoenix again during the X-Men's battle with the Shi'ar Imperial Guard, Jean is overpowered and captured. Lilandra has Jean subjected to what amounts to a psychic lobotomy, leaving Jean without any of her telepathic or telekinetic powers. In the end, Jean is allowed to return to Earth with the rest of the X-Men, "cured" of the power and madness of Dark Phoenix. The one-shot also reveals the original splash page drawn for ''Uncanny X-Men'' #138, which shows Jean and Scott in a happier time, contrasted with the splash page actually published in issue #138 that shows Jean's funeral.

[[John Byrne]], penciller on ''Uncanny X-Men'', had strong feelings against how powerful Phoenix had become and worked with writer [[Chris Claremont]] to effectively remove Phoenix from the storyline, initially by removing her powers; however, Byrne's decision to have Dark Phoenix destroy an inhabited solar system in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #135 caused some consternation with the editors, who felt that since Jean had now become a mass murderer on a galactic scale, her "punishment" at the end of issue #137 was too lenient. As a result, the last chapter of issue #137 was completely rewritten with Phoenix's powers returning and escalating out of control, forcing her to end her own life rather than risk destroying any more worlds.

Marvel editor Jim Shooter, in response to a question about the return of Jean Grey, responded, "Jean Grey is dead". And, for a while, Marvel stuck to this.

===Return===
[[Image:Ff286.png|left|150px|Cover to ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #286. Art by John Byrne.|thumb]]
A few years later, it was desired to bring Jean Grey back to life, as part of the launch of the new ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' series. Editorially, it was decreed that this would only be allowed if Jean could be utterly absolved of the evil deeds of the ''Dark Phoenix Saga''.

This absolution began when the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] find a strange pod lying on the bottom of Jamaica bay, which they send to [[Reed Richards]] of the [[Fantastic Four]]. The pod cracks open and Jean emerges, with no memories from the time she flew the shuttle until she hatched from the cocoon, but the truth of Phoenix is now revealed. While dying upon the shuttle, Jean was, in fact, approached by a cosmic psychic entity known as the Phoenix Force, which duplicated her form and mind and posed as her while Jean herself was sealed in a pod at the bottom of the bay to heal. It was the Phoenix Force which became the Dark Phoenix and committed those evil actions, hence Jean was absolved of them and went on to found X-Factor with her original X-Men team-mates.

Due to the Richards' technology, Jean is now without her telepathy, but her telekinesis is much more powerful. The former X-Men are contacted and she reunites with them.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' (Vol. 1) #286</ref>. Jean finds that the Phoenix Force merged with her daughter from an alternate future, [[Rachel Summers]].

During the time in which Jean is thought dead, Scott met a pilot named [[Madelyne Pryor]]. They marry and produce a son, [[Cable (comics)|Nathan Christopher Charles Summers]]. When Scott hears Jean is alive, he leaves Pryor. Shortly afterward, he joins Jean and the other founding X-Men to create [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]<ref>''X-Factor'' (Vol. 1) #1</ref>. He calls Madelyne to try to persuade her to come to New York. When he receives no answer, he assumes that his wife had left him. In truth, [[Mr. Sinister]] kidnapped Madelyne and Nathan. Mr. Sinister had created Madelyne from Jean Grey's DNA, believing the offspring of Jean Grey and Scott Summers would be a genetically superior mutant who possessed incredible powers.

[[Image:X-factor38.jpg|right|150px|Jean Grey versus her clone Madelyne Pryor. Art by Walter Simonson.|thumb]]
With her purpose fulfilled, Sinister turns Madelyne over to the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]]. The X-Men rescue her and she joins them. Wanting to rescue her son from Mr. Sinister, Madelyne makes a pact with demons, and using her despair, the goblins make her their queen, driving her insane. Madelyne attempts to sacrifice Nathan in a ritual that will bring the demons of Limbo into the world. Madelyne dies in a climactic battle with Jean after she links their minds and wills herself to die -- hoping the link will kill Jean as well. It does not work, and Jean gains all the memories of both Madelyne and the Dark Phoenix.<ref>The ''[[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|X-Men: Inferno]]'' [[fictional crossover|crossover]], 1983</ref>

Jean becomes a member of the X-Men's "Gold Team" led by Storm when X-Factor joins with Xavier. Her telepathy had also been restored to her by the infant Nathan.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #281, 1992</ref> Jean is instrumental in saving Wolverine's life when Magneto rips the adamantium from his skeleton.<ref>"Fatal Attractions": ''X-Men'' (Vol. 2) #25, Wolverine (Vol. 2) #75, 1994</ref> Using her telekinesis, Jean holds Logan's body together and supports his healing factor. When her physical body dies in a Sentinel attack, Jean survives by transferring her psyche into the body of the comatose Emma Frost. While in Emma's body, Jean uses telekinesis, an ability that Emma never used. Jean is later restored to her original body with the help of Xavier and Forge.

=== Marriage ===
Scott proposed to Jean but she declined because the memories of him proposing to BOTH Maddie and The Phoenix kept on haunting her. He told her he would wait for her. Later, Jean proposes to Scott and they marry.<ref>''X-Men'' (Vol. 2) #30, 1994</ref> During their honeymoon, they are taken into the future to raise Scott's son [[Cable (comics)|Nathan]]. <ref>[[The Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix]] #1-4, 1994</ref> After returning, Jean resumes using the name Phoenix as an attempt to redeem both the entity and herself and to honour her time-traveling future daughter Rachel, who was presumed dead at the time, but was later revealed to have been lost somewhere in the timestream with the premature death of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. 

[[Image:Jeanscottemma.png|150px|left|Jean enters Emma's mind interupting Scott and Emma's telepathic affair. Art by Phil Jimenez.|thumb]]
During a battle with the aforementioned villain, Scott merged with the immortal mutant. Jean and [[Psylocke]] switch powers, and Jean adds Psylocke's telepathic powers to her own telepathy, as well as her shadow astral-form, while Psylocke gets Jean's telekinesis. Jean begins to manifest fiery raptor effects as the physical manifestation of her powers. Jean learns that Cyclops is alive, and searches for him with her step-son Cable (Nathan). Jean uses her increased telepathic powers to separate Cyclops' and Apocalypse's spirits. Having her husband back helps Jean accept her role as host of the Phoenix Force and the telekinetic powers it recreates for her.

A combination of Jean's duties as headmistress of the Xavier Institute, her re-emerging Phoenix powers, and Scott's temporary merger with Apocalypse drives a wedge between the couple. Jean attempts to rebuild the relationship, but Scott remains distant, refusing to sleep with her. Scott turns to [[Emma Frost]], who takes advantage of Scott's emotional problems, which leads to a telepathic extra-marital affair.<ref>"Riot at Xavier's": ''New X-Men'' #138, 2003</ref> When confronted by Jean, Scott claims that they shared "only thoughts" and that he had done nothing wrong; Jean, however, disagrees and demands that Emma explain herself, but Emma only jeers and insults her. Enraged, Jean unleashes the Phoenix power on Emma, rifling through her memories and forcing her to confront the truth about herself.<ref>"Murder at the Mansion": ''New X-Men'' #139, 2003</ref>

Later, Wolverine and Phoenix are propelled towards the sun while on Asteroid M. About to die, Wolverine reluctantly stabs Phoenix so she will not have to die an agonizing death in the intense solar heat. Seconds before they collide with the sun, the Phoenix Force manifests within Jean, and she saves them both. She tells him that by killing her, he helped her release the "Phoenix Consciousness." Arriving on Earth, they encounter an impostor of Magneto who mortally injures Phoenix by transferring a large amount of electro-magnetic energy to her brain, inducing a "planetary-scale stroke." As Jean dies in Scott's arms, she tells him to live.<ref>"Planet X": ''New X-Men'' #150, 2004</ref>

===Here Comes Tomorrow===
[[Image:Normal Al Rio-phoenix col.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Jean manifests her Phoenix powers. Art by [[Al Rio]].]]
Scott Summers refusal of Emma Frost's offer to re-open Xavier's Institute creates a future timeline in which [[Hank McCoy]] re-opens the school. Under the pressure, he takes the drug "Kick", which is revealed to be the [[Particulate|aerosol]] form of the villain [[Sublime (comics)|Sublime]], who possesses Hank McCoy and drives him insane. 150 years later, the near-immortal Beast tries to resurrect Phoenix and use her to destroy every lifeform on Earth, except for the creatures created by Sublime itself, only to be defeated by Jean. Phoenix then carries out her disinfection and absorbs the future universe into the "White Hot Room", a higher plane of reality with other Phoenix hosts. She wears a white variation of her Dark Phoenix outfit and is revealed to be the "White Phoenix of the Crown", the most complete state a Phoenix avatar can achieve. Jean reaches back in time and tells Scott to live. Instead of refusing Emma and leaving the institute, Scott chooses to be with Emma and keep the Xavier Institute alive.<ref>"Here Comes Tomorrow": ''New X-Men'' #151-154, 2004</ref>

===Endsong===
{{main|X-Men: Phoenix - Endsong}}
In the 2005 ''X-Men: Phoenix - Endsong'' [[limited series]], the [[Shi'ar]] resurrect the Phoenix Force prematurely in hopes of destroying it while it is relatively weak, but the Phoenix escapes to Earth where it resurrects Jean and bonds with her once more, and discovers that Phoenix and Jean are one. The X-Men battle the Phoenix at the North Pole until, with the help of Cerebra, Emma and the Stepford Cuckoos contact all of the X-Men around the world to focus their love into Jean. This enables Jean to gain control of the Phoenix, and she goes to the [[White Hot Room]].

===Warsong===
{{main|X-Men: Phoenix - Warsong}}
{{future comic}}
Writer Greg Pak has said that Warsong "is not another Jean Grey resurrection story. It's an essential Phoenix story, and therefore ultimately an essential tale for understanding Jean Grey." [http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=7464] Pak also stated that Warsong will lay the groundwork for the future of both Jean and the Phoenix.

==Powers and abilities==
[[Image:Jean Grey 003.jpg|160px|thumb|left|Jean Grey. Art by Phil Jimenez.]]
Jean Grey is an [[Omega-level mutant]], one of the most powerful mutants in existence, and the physical embodiment of the immortal being [[Phoenix (comics)|Phoenix Force]]. Jean Grey's dual psionic potential gives her potentially limitless [[telepathy]] and [[psychokinesis|telekinesis]]. When Jean became Dark Phoenix, she could telekinetically manipulate matter on atomic and sub-atomic levels.

When her powers first manifest, Jean is unable to cope with her telepathy, forcing Professor X to suppress her access to it altogether. Instead, he chooses to train her in the use of her telekinesis while allowing her telepathy to grow at its natural rate before reintroducing it.{{fact}} This is why in Jean's début appearance as Marvel Girl, she is only capable of using her telekinetic powers.{{fact}} When the Professor hides to prepare for the Z'Nox, he reopens Jean's telepathic powers, which was initially explained as Xavier 'sharing' some of his telepathy with her, indicating that writers perhaps did not initially intend for Jean to have telepathic powers.{{fact}}

Jean is considered to be one of the Earth's most powerful telepathic minds. It has been stated that Jean Grey will eventually be more powerful than Professor Xavier,{{fact}} who is widely considered to be the most powerful telepath on Earth. Jean's telepathy allows her to communicate with others telepathically, read the thoughts of others, influence and control the minds of others, project her mind into the astral plane, and generate telepathic force blasts that can stun or kill others. Jean is one of the few telepaths skilled enough to communicate with animals (animals with high intelligence, such as [[dolphins]]<ref> ''Classic X-Men'' # 13, 1987</ref>,[[dogs]]<ref> ''X-men Unlimited'' # 44, 2003</ref>, and [[ravens]]<ref> ''Uncanny X-Men'' # 357, 1998</ref>).
Her telekinetic strength and skill are both of an extremely high level, capable of grasping objects in Earth orbit and manipulating hundreds of components in mid-air in complex patterns. She can telekinetically lift (press) several tons of matter at once, and has learned to use her power both aggressively and defensively, as blasts of focused telekinetic force or defensive shields strong enough to withstand missile fire.{{facts}}

When Jean absorbs [[Psylocke]]'s specialized telepathic powers, her own telepathy is increased to the point that she can physically manifest her telepathy as a psionic [[fire bird (mythology)|firebird]] whose claws can inflict both physical and mental damage. Jean can use her amplified telepathy to increase temporarily the speed of neural signals in brains and mutant's powers to incredible levels. She briefly develops a psychic shadow form like Psylocke's, with a gold Phoenix emblem over her eye instead of the Crimson Dawn eye mark possessed by Psylocke.

The Phoenix can revive, absorb, rechannel, and preserve any kind of lifeform, meaning that she can take life energy from one person and give it to others, heal herself with the same life energy, or even resurrect the fallen, since the Phoenix is the sum of all life and death. As phoenix, Jean's powers escalate to a level that allows her to rearrange matter at a subatomic level, fly unaided through space, survive in any atmosphere, and generate massive destructive blasts and atmospheric disturbances. She manifests a "telekinetic sensitivity" that lets her feel the texture of objects on which she has a telekinetic hold, feel when other objects come into contact with them, and probe them at a molecular level. When she engages her Phoenix powers, Jean is surrounded in a flame-like energy corona that takes the form of a large bird of fire. As the Phoenix, Jean can resurrect herself after death.{{facts}}

==Ancestry==
{{main|Lady Grey}}
Introduced in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #125 (September, 1979) '''Lady Grey''' is the look-alike ancestor of [[X-Men]] member [[Jean Grey]] and a member of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] during the [[18th century]]. During this issue the villain [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]] attempted to turn Grey (Then under the guise of the [[Phoenix (comics)]] into the Black Queen of the modern Hellfire Club by creating the illusion that she was living in the body of an ancestor named ''Lady Grey''.  However, whether this ancestor was a real person or a creation of Mastermind was left uncertain.

This question was finally answered in ''X-Men: Hellfire Club'' #2 (February, 2000), part of a mini-series on the history of the Club.  This particular issue was scripted by [[Ben Raab]] and drawn by [[Charlie Adlard]]. Lady Grey was revealed to have been an influential member, possibly a Queen, of the [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] branch of the Club during the [[American Revolutionary War]] ([[1775]] - [[1783]]).

==Alternate Versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
[[Image:Weaponx1.jpg|150px|left|thumb|AoA Jean Grey with Weapon X (Wolverine) on the cover to Weapon X #1. Art by Adam Kubert.]]
In the "[[Age of Apocalypse]]" storyline, Jean is a student of Magneto who falls in love with fellow student [[Wolverine (comics)|Weapon X]]. Weapon X rescues her after [[Mr. Sinister]] kidnaps her and combines her extracted DNA with that of [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] to clone the perfect mutant. Weapon X and Jean live happily together until Jean learns of a plan to drop nuclear bombs on the United States to kill Apocalypse. Jean tries to stop the attack with the aid of Cyclops and holds back the nuclear bombs with her telekinesis. She dies at the hands of Cyclops' brother [[Havok (comics)|Prelate Havok]].

In a tenth-anniversary limited series, Sinister, who had also been killed in the "Age of Apocalypse" event, finds that Jean's DNA contains special properties and that she should have access to the powers of "Mutant Alpha", the legendary "first mutant". He resurrects her, and she displays the powers of "Mutant Alpha", which look like Phoenix Force powers. At first Jean doesn't remember her old life, but Logan is able to reach her. Jean turns on Sinister and incinerates him. Jean and Logan are reunited, and she becomes leader of the X-Men at Magneto's behest.

===Ultimate Jean Grey/Marvel Girl===

[[Image:Ultimatemarvelgirl.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Ultimate Marvel Girl. Art by [[Adam Kubert]].]]
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] continuity, Jean Grey is a responsible but extroverted teenage girl. She has a sexual affair with [[Ultimate Wolverine|Wolverine]], but drops him for [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] after Wolverine tells her that he had joined the [[Ultimate X-Men]] to assassinate [[Professor X]] for Magneto. Xavier found Jean Grey while she was in a mental hospital, having problems controlling her telepathy and having troublesome visions of a Phoenix raptor. She was Xavier's second student after Cyclops.

The exact nature of the Phoenix in the Ultimate Universe has not been revealed, but it is revealed in Ultimate X-Men #71 that it is an actual entity and not an uncovered aspect of Jean's own mind. According to the Fire and Brimstone story arc, Jean's Phoenix powers come from the [[Phoenix God]], although Xavier does not believe this.

===Marvel Mangaverse Jean Grey===
In the original'' [[Marvel Mangaverse]] X-Men'' and ''X-Men Ronin'' stories, Jean is a powerful telepath and  telekinetic and calls herself Marvel Girl, but she also has access to the Phoenix Force. The three-issue ''X-Men: Phoenix - Legacy of Fire'' limited series, involves a separate character based on Jean Grey named "Jena Pyre". Jena and her sister [[Madelyne Pryor|Madelyne]] are the guardians of the "Phoenix Sword", whose power Jena absorbs. The miniseries infamously depicts the lead characters in near-nudity. The series' rating was raised from PG to PG+ before issue #1 was released, and the series was moved to the [[MAX (comics)|MAX]] mature readers imprint for issues #2 and #3.

===Ruins===
In the [[Ruins (comics)|Ruins]] miniseries, Jean Grey never developed her mutant powers and lived as a prostitute. Shortly after being introduced, she was shot twice and killed by Nick Fury.

===Marvel 1602===
In the ''[[Marvel 1602]]'' miniseries, Jean Grey poses as "John Grey" and is a member of the "witchbreed" led by Carlos Javier (the Charles Xavier of the 1602 universe). Like her Marvel Universe counterpart, she has telekinetic powers. She is a traditional Shakespearean girl posing as a boy and sacrifices her life for her comrades during their battle against Otto Von Doom ([[Victor Von Doom]]) and subsequent escape to America. When her corpse is cremated, the fire forms a giant Phoenix raptor before disappearing. Besides Javier and Sir Nicholas Fury, the only one who knows of Jean's deception is Scotius Summerisle (Scott Summers), who is attracted to her. "John" also has a close friendship with Werner (Angel), who is also attracted to her while still thinking she is a man.

==Appearances in other media==
===Television===
[[Image:C-05.jpg|thumb|150px|Jean Grey In ''X-Men: Evolution'']]
*Jean Grey is a character in the ''[[X-Men (animated series)|X-Men]]'' [[animated television series]] of the mid-1990s, voiced by [[Catherine Disher]]. She also appears a flashback in an episode, "The Origin of Iceman" of ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'' in the early 1980s.

*In the animated TV series ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'', Jean, voiced by [[Venus Terzo]], is beautiful and popular. Her powers are similar to those in the early comic books; she possesses [[telepathy]] and [[telekinesis]], only able to move objects telekinetically that she could move by hand. By the third season, she can levitate objects as heavy as a [[helicopter]] without difficulty. When her powers surge, Jean finds herself losing control, overhearing thoughts without effort. The X-Men help her to regain control, leading her to form a psychic rapport with her teammate Scott Summers. The series ends with glimpses of the future for various characters, and Jean is shown transforming into Dark Phoenix . Had the show been renewed for a fifth season, this subplot would have been further developed[http://x-men.toonzone.net/qaboyd2.php].

=== Film ===
[[Image:Famkexmenthelaststand.jpg|150px|thumb|Jean Grey/Phoenix in X-Men: The Last Stand]][[Famke Janssen]] portrays Jean Grey/Phoenix in the feature films ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'', ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'', and ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]''.

*In ''X-Men'', Jean was introduced as the team’s [[medical doctor]] and is involved in a long-term relationship with Cyclops. A love triangle develops between her, Cyclops, and Wolverine. Jean's powers are mild compared to her teammates', and her telepathy is not as powerful as that of Professor X, who is still teaching her to develop it. However at the process of rescuing Rogue at Liberty Island to stop Magneto from using the Mutation Device to mutate the UN leaders, the energy source from the Mutation Device somehow triggers her senses as she felt something strange within her begins to rise.
 
*In ''X2'', at the Science Museum, Jean expresses her concerns to Cyclops about her experiences of frequent bad dreams and headaches. Jean begins to exhibit Phoenix-like powers as she uses her telekinesis to deflect the missiles fired at the X-Men while trying to escape from the US Air Force. Her eyes glow fiery red as she successfully destroys one missile, and also in another incident when she fights Cyclops, who is under [[William Stryker]]'s control. After the destruction in Alkali Lake, Jean sacrifices herself to save her teammates from a ruptured dam. Her power reaches to the maximum level as she controls the waters while getting the X-Jet off the ground. Jean is then engulfed in a massive fiery glow of energy, as she closes her eyes and let the waters crash onto her. At the end of ''X2'', a vision of a phoenix raptor is seen underneath the lake where Jean 'seemingly' died.

*In ''X-Men: The Last Stand'', Jean's death severely affects Cyclops who keeps having nightmares of her. He returns to Alkali Lake where Jean Grey resurrects. They begin to kiss and it appears she seemingly kills him by atomizing him with her telekinesis. Unconscious, she is taken back to the mansion by Storm and Wolverine. There it is revealed that since childhood, Jean had powers that were beyond limitations. Fearing that Jean could not control her vast powers, Charles Xavier put psychic blocks around her subconscious mind to keep Jean's immense powers at bay. As a result while growing up, Jean has developed a dual personality - one being her usual self and the other is her powerful side which calls itself the '[[Dark Phoenix|Phoenix]]'. Jean's Dark Phoenix powers began to manifest as she uses her telekinesis to attack Xavier. Her eyes turn black (with a subtle amount of fire in her irises), and her skin darkens and becomes veiny (almost zombie like) as she kills Xavier and joins Magneto's Brotherhood. Upon attacking Alcatraz Island - Jean, in her Dark Phoenix form, unleashes her armaggedon fury and destroys much of Worthington Labs, the X-Jet and kills both mutants and humans along the way. Wolverine tells Storm to get everyone to safety and he's the only one who can stop her. He manages to get Jean to re-surface long enough, who pleads for him to stop and save her from causing anymore harm. Wolverine expresses his love for Jean, and then stabs her with his claws. Her gravestone is later seen next to Cyclops' and Xavier's.

===Video Games===
*Jean Grey appears as "Marvel Girl", a playable character in 1990's ''[[X-Men II: The Fall of the Mutants]]'' for the PC. Jean is a supporting character in ''[[X-Men (Sega video game)|X-Men]]'' for the [[Sega Genesis]].

*She appears as "Phoenix" in her blue-and-gold uniform in ''[[X-Men: Gamemaster's Legacy]]'' for the [[Sega Game Gear]].
