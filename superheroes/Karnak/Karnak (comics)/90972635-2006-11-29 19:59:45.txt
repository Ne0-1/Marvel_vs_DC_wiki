'''Karnak''' is a [[fictional character]] in the {{Marvel Universe}}. He is a member of the Inhuman race, one of those who form the [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] Royal Family. Cousin of [[Black Bolt]], king of the Inhumans, Karnak has the ability to find the weak point in any person or thing.  Thus, he is usually used as planner by the Inhumans.

He is the brother of Triton, who endured Terrigenesis before he did. However, Triton's Terrigenesis was so extreme that his parents begged that Karnak not have to endure the procedure. Instead, he was sent to a monastery, where he learned martial arts.

He is usually attended by his relatives, [[Gorgon (comics)|Gorgon]] and [[Triton (comics)|Triton]]. He has taken part in most of the Inhumans' adventures, such as the [[Kree]]-[[Skrull]] War, the many moves of the Inhuman city of Attilan, and being sent to [[Earth]] with Gorgon in an attempt to find Black Bolt's son with [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]'s help.

==Ultimate Karnak==
The character of Ultimate Karnak was introduced in Ultimate Fantastic Four Annual #1. Here, he is a member of the Inhuman royal family, a cousin of Crystal, Medusa and Gorgon, and presumably a brother of Triton. There are differences in the character: firstly, his features are Asian (which is acceptable, given his home's Himalayan location) and white-haired; secondly, he has superpowers. His power is the ability to sense and control energy, for example, he sensed the stress-points in Sue Storm's invisible force-field, and attacked it with a bolt of electricity.

== Other Media ==
Karnak appears in the video game ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]''.
