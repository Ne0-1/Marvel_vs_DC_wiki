'''Karnak''' is a [[fictional]] [[martial artist]] published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=December 2012}}
He first appears in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' vol. 1, #45, and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

==Fictional character biography==
Karnak is a member of the Inhuman race, one of those who form the [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] Royal Family, born on the island of [[Attilan]]. Cousin of [[Black Bolt]], king of the Inhumans, Karnak has the ability to find the weak point in any person, plan, or object. Thus, he is usually used as planner by the Inhumans.  He also serves as a priest and philosopher to the Inhumans.

He is the brother of [[Triton (comics)|Triton]], who endured Terrigenesis before he did. However, Triton's Terrigenesis was so extreme that his parents, Mander and Azur, begged that Karnak not have to endure the procedure. Instead, he was sent to a monastery, where he learned martial arts.

He is usually attended by his relatives, [[Gorgon (Inhuman)|Gorgon]] and Triton. He has taken part in most of the Inhumans' adventures, such as the [[Kree-Skrull War]], and the many moves of the Inhuman city of Attilan.

Karnak and the Royal Family encounter [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus]]' creation, the Trikon, and are driven from Attilan's Great Refuge in exile.<ref>Revealed in ''Inhumans Special'' #1</ref>

Karnak first appeared as a member of the Inhumans when he attempted to retrieve his cousin and queen, [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]] from the outside world and take her back to Attilan. This led him into conflict with the [[Fantastic Four]], the first humans he met, who were harboring Medusa after rescuing her from the villainous [[Frightful Four]]. Accordingly, Karnak is indirectly responsible for revealing the existence of Attilan to the outside world. Karnak battled Maximus alongside the Inhuman Royal Family, and became trapped in Maximus' "negative zone" barrier around the Great Refuge.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #45-48</ref> He was  freed from the "negative zone" barrier along with the rest of the Inhumans,{{by whom|date=August 2014}}{{clarification needed |date=August 2014}} and left the Great Refuge with the Royal Family to visit the outside world.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #59-61</ref> He teamed with the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], [[Human Torch]], and [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] against the [[Psycho-Man]].<ref>''Fantastic Four Annual'' #5</ref> He aided the Inhuman Royal Family in defeating Maximus' next attempt to overthrow the Great Refuge.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #82-83</ref>

He was later sent to [[Earth]] with Gorgon in an attempt to find Black Bolt's missing son with [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]'s help.<ref>''Daredevil'' #274</ref> There he and his companions fought against [[Ultron]]-13 in which Karnak's power allowed him to discover the weak spot in Ultron's neck. Later they became entangled in [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]'s plot against Daredevil, and were transported to a netherworld where they were personally attacked by the supernatural entity known as [[Blackheart]]. Karnak's animosity towards Gorgon was fanned into a rage, causing actual physical violence. Blackheart was soon defeated and the group went their intended ways.<ref>''Daredevil'' #278-282</ref>

Karnak later aided the [[New Warriors]] against the third [[Star Thief|Star-Thief]].<ref>''New Warriors'' #6</ref> Alongside [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], he then battled [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #67-68</ref> Alongside the Avengers, he then battled [[Thane Ector]].<ref>''Avengers'' #334-335</ref>

Later, during a conflict with several Earth countries, Karnak fought with a new costume, designed with the powers of one of the older Inhumans.{{issue|date=January 2014}}

Karnak, along with Gorgon, has been uncovered as violating Inhuman law. After a conflict with the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], Black Bolt uncovers evidence that the two have been using "[[Alpha Primitive]]s," a long-freed slave caste as slaves again. They do not feel that Inhumans should be doing regular chores.{{issue|date=January 2014}}

Karnak joins an Inhuman strike team to help take down the confused super-powered [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]].<ref>''New Avengers'' #9</ref>

During the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'', Karnak encounters a Skrull in the form of Toros.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Inhumans'' #1</ref> Karnak engages it and learns that it can copy his powers. Karnak manages to defeat the Toros-Skrull by sending it out the window where it was impaled on a [[fence]].<ref>''Secret Invasion: Inhumans'' #2</ref>

Following Attilan's destruction during the ''[[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]'' storyline, Karnak goes on a rampage in New York at the start of the ''[[Inhumanity (comics)|Inhumanity]]'' storyline. He is stopped and imprisoned by the Avengers. After warning Medusa to forget what she knows in order to prepare for a coming cataclysm, Karnak commits suicide by leaping out of one of the windows in [[Stark Tower|Avengers Tower]].<ref>''Inhumanity'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Karnak has enhanced strength, stamina, durability, agility, and reflexes as a result of his genetically superior Inhuman physiology.  Unlike most Inhumans, he does not have superhuman powers as a result of exposure to the mutagenic Terrigen Mist, as he was never exposed to the Mist. Instead, Karnak has the extrasensory ability (achieved through meditation and intensive training) to perceive stress points, fracture planes, or weaknesses in objects or persons. He has complete voluntary control of most of his autonomic bodily functions. All striking surfaces of his body are extremely toughened. He is capable of shattering substances up to and including mild steel and rendering superhuman opponents unconscious by striking them.

Like all Inhumans, Karnak's immune system is weaker than that of an average human.

Karnak has received his fighting skills as a result of Inhuman royal militia training.  He is also a graduate of the religious seminary, at the Tower of Wisdom in Attilan.

He uses a hover-platform for transportation designed by Inhuman technicians.
