'''Karnak''' is a [[fictional]] [[martial artist]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He first appears in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' vol. 1, #45, and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

==Fictional character biography==
Karnak is a member of the Inhuman race, one of those who form the [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] Royal Family. Cousin of [[Black Bolt]], king of the Inhumans, Karnak has the ability to find the weak point in any person, plan or object. Thus, he is usually used as planner by the Inhumans.

He is the brother of [[Triton (comics)|Triton]], who endured Terrigenesis before he did. However, Triton's Terrigenesis was so extreme that his parents begged that Karnak not have to endure the procedure. Instead, he was sent to a monastery, where he learned martial arts.

He is usually attended by his relatives, [[Gorgon (comics)|Gorgon]] and Triton. He has taken part in most of the Inhumans' adventures, such as the [[Kree-Skrull War]], the many moves of the Inhuman city of Attilan, and being sent to [[Earth]] with Gorgon in an attempt to find Black Bolt's son with [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]'s help. There he and his companions fought against [[Ultron]]-13 in which karnak's power allowed him to discover the weak spot in [[Ultron]]'s neck. Later they were personally attacked by  the supernatural entity known as [[Blackheart]]. Karnak's animosity towards Gorgon was fanned into a rage, causing actual physical violence. 

Fortunately Blackheart was soon defeated and the group went their intended ways. Later, during a conflict with several Earth countries, Karnak fought with a new costume, designed with the powers of one of the older Inhumans.

Karnak, along with Gorgon, has recently been uncovered as violating Inhuman law. After a conflict with the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], Black Bolt uncovers evidence that the two have been using '[[Alpha Primitive]]s', a long-freed slave caste as slaves again. They do not feel that Inhumans should be doing regular chores.

==Other versions==
===Earth X===
In the alternate future of [[Earth X]], Karnak has undergone a further mutation. His cranium has greatly increased and his features are now more sunken. During an investigative mission to Earth, he attempts to act as a calming influence among the members of the Royal Family. He has altered his uniform in order to expose his powerful limbs.

===Exiles===
In issus #23 and #25 of "[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]", Karnak appears as one of the many heroes overtaken by a mutated version of the techno-organic [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]]. 

===Heroes Reborn===
Karnak lives with the other Inhumans, hidden on Earth. His society pays reverence to Galactus and his many heralds via statues. Karnak dresses in a more stylized version of his 616 uniform.

===Mutant X===
Karnak joins with his fellow Inhumans and a team of [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]] to confront the murderous duo of the [[Beyonder]] and Dracula. Inhumans and Eternals alike are all killed and Dracula drains them. 

===Ultimate Universe===
The character of Ultimate Karnak was introduced in Ultimate Fantastic Four Annual #1. Here, he is a member of the Inhuman royal family, a cousin of Crystal, Medusa and Gorgon, and presumably a brother of Triton. There are differences in the character: firstly, his features are Asian and white-haired; secondly, he has superpowers. His power is the ability to sense and control energy, for example, he sensed the stress-points in Sue Storm's invisible force-field, and attacked it with a bolt of electricity.
