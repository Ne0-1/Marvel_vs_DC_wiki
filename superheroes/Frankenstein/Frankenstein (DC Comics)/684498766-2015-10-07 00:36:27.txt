'''Frankenstein''' is a [[DC Comics]] character who is based on [[Mary Shelley|Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley]]'s original [[Frankenstein's monster]], but is physically more reminiscent of the classic [[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Universal]] representation of the character. He was created in 1948 by [[Edmond Hamilton]] and [[Bob Kane]] in a [[Batman]] ''[[Detective Comics]]'' story.

A later reworking was developed by [[Len Wein]] as the ''[[Spawn of Frankenstein]]'' concept. The monster fell under the thrall of [[Count Dracula]]. They often battled against [[Superman]], [[Batman]], or the [[Phantom Stranger]].

Frankenstein's latest revamping was created by [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Doug Mahnke]] in 2005 and is similar to [[Doc Frankenstein]]. He is one of the [[Seven Soldiers]], and bears a resemblance to the creature as portrayed by [[Boris Karloff]] in the [[Frankenstein (1931 film)|1931 film]] directed by [[James Whale]].

==Fictional character biography==
Frankenstein is an [[undead]] body composed of parts from several corpses stitched together, created by Victor Frankenstein some time in the 19th century. He was assumed dead in Europe when he sank beneath the ice, but he survived and swam to America, having 'many adventures'. He was revived by Victor Adam, and vowed vengeance for restoring him to life, successfully killing him, but accidentally bringing about a coma for [[Doctor Thirteen]]'s wife, Maria, in the process.<ref>''The Phantom Stranger'' (vol. 2) 23-24</ref>  In particular, Frankenstein became a frequent enemy of [[Sheeda#Sheeda characters|Melmoth]], who he referred to as the Ringmaster of the Circus of Maggots. In a climactic battle in the year 1870, Frankenstein faced Melmoth and stopped him from destroying [[Vanity (comics)|a town]] with [[maggot]]-hominids. The fight took place on a moving train, which was derailed during the conflict, and Frankenstein's fate was unknown.

In 2005, a high school student, called 'Uglyhead' by all the other children, acquires [[telepathy|telepathic]] abilities through contact with the Sheeda, which he uses to torment his peers. At the senior prom, the now-docile students are killed by the Sheeda maggot-hominids. This causes the return of Frankenstein, who had survived in a state of hibernation underneath the town, who makes short work of the maggots and the boy, before burning down the school to cover the bodies. Afterwards, Frankenstein tracks down Melmoth and makes his way to [[Mars]] through an "Erdel Gate" (a reference to Dr. Saul Erdel who first transported the [[Martian Manhunter]] to Earth). On Mars, the Monster confronts Melmoth once again. Frankenstein frees the children Melmoth has [[Child labor|enslaved]] to work in his [[Gold mining|gold mines]], and feeds Melmoth to the [[Carnivore|flesh-eating]], [[mantis|praying mantis]]-like horses of Mars. Before he is consumed, Melmoth reveals that it was not lightning that brought the monster to life, but several drops of his own immortal blood, sold to Frankenstein's creator, that still course through Frankenstein's veins.

In the third issue of the series, Frankenstein meets an old acquaintance greatly resembling the "Bride" in [[James Whale]]'s ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'', albeit with two extra arms grafted onto her by the Red Swami, a supervillain who brainwashed her into thinking she was the reincarnation of an assassin goddess.<ref>''Seven Soldiers: Frankenstein'' #3 (April 2006)</ref> She is now an agent of the Super Human Advanced Defense Executive ([[S.H.A.D.E.]]), a secret government agency, which temporarily drafts Frankenstein as well. Of their previous relationship, she says, "It's nothing personal, but you were never my type."

In the final issue, he stows away on a time-ship which brings him to the Sheeda realm in the distant future. There, he destroys their world-destroying fleet, kills the Sheeda-Queen's time-yacht's steersman, and hijacks her ship to the present.  Once in the present, though, [[Klarion the Witch Boy|Klarion]] gains control of Frankenstein using a witch-brand and forces him to take the castle back to the future.

He appears briefly in ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #7, which takes place one week after the Frankenstein miniseries. He is seen fighting against [[General Wade Eiling]].  Frankenstein is armed with a three-foot-long sword, which he claims once belonged to the [[Michael (archangel)|Archangel Michael]], and a large antique pistol, which he calls his 'steam-gun'.

A character called [[Young Frankenstein (comics)|Young Frankenstein]] has appeared in ''[[Teen Titans]]'' as a member of the team during the "Lost Year" covered by ''[[52 (comics)|52]]''. Young Frankenstein is apparently killed by [[Black Adam]] during [[World War III (DC Comics)|WWIII]], but actually survives as shown in the ''Infinite Halloween Special'' and ''Countdown to Mystery'' #2.

Frankenstein and S.H.A.D.E appear in ''[[Final Crisis]]'' #3, also written by Grant Morrison. He again appears two issues later, leading a squad of superheroes against [[Darkseid]]'s forces, who are led by [[Kalibak]]. He is also seen in the final issue fighting in humanity's last stand before [[Superman]] gets the Miracle Machine working. Frankenstein is immune to Darkseid's weapon, the [[Anti-Life Equation]], because he is already dead.

Frankenstein confronts [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]] in the latter's current limited series, and again during the ''[[Blackest Night]]''.<ref>''Superman/Batman'' #66 (November 2009)</ref> Grundy, having been transformed into a [[Black Lantern]], rips out Frankenstein's heart, but, due to having an extra one in his chest, Frankenstein survives this attack.<ref>''Superman/Batman'' #67 (December 2009)</ref>

As part of [[The New 52]] (a reboot of the DC Comics universe), a new [[ongoing series]] ''Frankenstein, Agent of S.H.A.D.E.'' was released, based on the [[Seven Soldiers]] version of Frankenstein. It was initially written by [[Jeff Lemire]] and drawn by [[Alberto Ponticelli]]. [[Matt Kindt]] and [[Alberto Ponticelli]] replaced them with issue 10 and stayed with the book until it was cancelled with issue 16.
