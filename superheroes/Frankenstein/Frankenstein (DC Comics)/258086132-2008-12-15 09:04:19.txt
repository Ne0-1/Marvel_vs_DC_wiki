'''Frankenstein''' is a [[DC Comics]] character who is based on [[Mary Shelley|Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley]]'s original [[Frankenstein's monster]], but is physically and mentally more reminiscent of the classic [[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Universal]] representation of the character. He was created in 1948 by [[Edmond Hamilton]] and [[Bob Kane]] in a [[Batman]] [[Detective Comics]] story. 

A later reworking was developed by [[Len Wein]] as the ''[[Spawn of Frankenstein]]'' concept. The monster fell under the thrall of [[Count Dracula]]. They often battled against [[Superman]], [[Batman]], or the [[Phantom Stranger]]. 

Frankenstein's latest revamping was created by [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Doug Mahnke]] in 2005 and is similar to [[Doc Frankenstein]]. He is a member of the [[Seven Soldiers of Victory#Seven Soldiers|Seven Soldiers of Victory]], and bears a resemblance to the creature as portrayed by [[Boris Karloff]] in the [[Frankenstein (1931 film)|1931 film]] directed by [[James Whale]]. 

==Fictional character biography==

Frankenstein is an [[undead]] body composed of parts from several corpses stitched together, created by Victor Frankenstein some time in the 19th century. He was assumed dead in Europe when he sank beneath the ice, but he survived and swam to America, having 'many adventures'. In 1870, he fought [[Sheeda#Sheeda Characters|Melmoth]], the Ringmaster of the Circus of Maggots, and stopped him from destroying [[Vanity (comics)|a town]] with [[maggot]]-hominids. Exhausted, he sank into the ground.

In 2005, a high school student, called 'Uglyhead' by all the other children, acquires [[telepathy|telepathic]] abilities, which he uses to torment his peers. At the senior prom, the now-docile students are killed by the Sheeda maggot-hominids. This causes the return of Frankenstein, who makes short work of the maggots and the boy, before burning down the school to cover the bodies. Afterwards, Frankenstein makes his way to [[Mars]] through an [[Martian Manhunter#History|Erdel Gate]], where he confronts Melmoth once again. Frankenstein frees the children Melmoth has [[Child labor|enslaved]] to work in his [[Gold mining|gold mines]], and feeds Melmoth to the [[Carnivore|flesh-eating]], [[mantis|praying mantis]]-like horses of Mars. Yet before he is consumed, Melmoth reveals that it was not lightning that brought the monster to life, but several drops of his own immortal blood, sold to Frankenstein's creator, that still course through Frankenstein's veins.

In the third issue of the series, Frankenstein meets an old acquaintance greatly resembling the "Bride" in [[James Whale]]'s ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'', albeit with four arms. She is now an agent of the Super Human Advanced Defense Executive ([[S.H.A.D.E.]], a parody of [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]]'s [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]), a secret government agency who temporarily drafts Frankenstein as well.  Of their previous relationship, she says, "It's nothing personal, but you were never my type."

In the final issue, he stows away on a time-ship which brings him to the Sheeda realm in the distant future. There, he destroys their  world-destroying fleet, kills the Sheeda-Queen's time-yacht's steersman, and hijacks her ship to the present.  Once in the present, though, [[Klarion the Witch Boy|Klarion]] gains control of Frankenstein using a witch-brand and forces him to take the castle back to the future.

He appears briefly in ''[[Infinite Crisis #7]]'', which takes place one week after the Frankenstein miniseries. He is seen fighting against General Wade Eiling.

Frankenstein is armed with a three-foot-long sword, which he claims once belonged to the [[Michael (archangel)|Archangel Michael]], and a large antique pistol, which he calls his 'steam-gun'.

A character called [[Young Frankenstein (comics)|Young Frankenstein]] has appeared in [[Teen Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]] as a member of the team during the "Lost Year" covered by ''[[52 (comics)|52]]''. Young Frankenstein was apparently killed by [[Black Adam]] during [[World War III (comics)#52|WWIII]], but actually survived as shown in the Infinite Halloween Special and Countdown to Mystery #2.

Frankenstein and S.H.A.D.E appear in ''[[Final Crisis]]'' #3, also written by Grant Morrison. He again appears two issues later, leading a squad of superheroes against Darkseid's forces, who are led by [[Kalibak]].
