Frankenstein is a [[DC Comics]] character created by [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Doug Mankhe]] in [[2005]]. He is a member of the [[Seven Soldiers of Victory]], and will probably play no part in the DCU after this story(see below).

==Story==
{{spoiler}}
Frankenstein is an [[undead]] spirit created to combat the [[Sheeda]]. Wherever they stage an attack, the earth draws Frankenstein to this place, where he deals with the problem before sinking back into the ground. In 1870, he fought Melmoth, the Ringmaster of the Carnival of Hate, and stopped him from destroying [[Vanity (comics)|a town]] with maggot-hominids. His job done, he sank into the ground.

In 2005, a student of the local high school is referred to as 'Uglyhead' by all the other children. However, a mysterious power gives him [[telepathic]] abilities, which he uses to torment his peers. At the senior prom, the now-docile students are killed by maggot-hominids. This causes the return of Frankenstein, who makes short work of the maggots and the boy, before burning down the school to cover the bodies. According to advance literature, Frankenstein will soon go to [[Mars]] to liberate Melmoth's slave children(a plot reference to [[Klarion the Witch Boy]]).

Frankenstein is armed with a three-foot-long sword and a large antique pistol.
