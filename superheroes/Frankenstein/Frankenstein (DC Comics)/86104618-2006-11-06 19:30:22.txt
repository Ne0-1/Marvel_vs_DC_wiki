'''Frankenstein''' is a [[DC Comics]] character who was revamped by [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Doug Mahnke]] in [[2005]]. He is a member of the [[Seven Soldiers of Victory]], and a reworking of [[Len Wein]]'s ''[[Spawn of Frankenstein]]'' concept, which is based on [[Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley]]'s original [[Frankenstein's monster]], to whom he bears a strong physical and mental resemblance.

==Story==
{{spoiler}}
Frankenstein is an [[undead]] body composed of parts from several corpses stitched together, created by Herr Doktor Frankenstein some time in the [[19th century]]. He was assumed dead in Europe when he sank beneath the ice, but he survived and swam to America, having 'many adventures'. In [[1870]], he fought [[Sheeda#Sheeda Characters|Melmoth]], the Ringmaster of the Circus of Maggots, and stopped him from destroying [[Vanity (comics)|a town]] with [[maggot]]-hominids. Exhausted, he sank into the ground.

In 2005, a high school student, called 'Uglyhead' by all the other children, acquires [[telepathic]] abilities, which he uses to torment his peers. At the senior prom, the now-docile students are killed by the Sheeda maggot-hominids. This causes the return of Frankenstein, who makes short work of the maggots and the boy, before burning down the school to cover the bodies. Afterwards, Frankenstein makes his way to [[Mars]] through an [[Martian Manhunter#History|Erdel Gate]], where he confronts Melmoth once again. Frankenstein frees the children Melmoth has [[Child labor|enslaved]] to work in his [[Gold mining|gold mines]], and feeds Melmoth to the [[Carnivore|flesh-eating]], [[praying mantis]]-like horses of Mars. But before he is consumed, Melmoth reveals that it was not lightning that brought the monster to life, but several drops of his own immortal blood, sold to Frankenstein's creator, that still course through Frankenstein's veins.

In the third issue of the series, Frankenstein meets an old acquaintance greatly resembling the "Bride" in [[James Whale]]'s ''[[The Bride of Frankenstein]]'' , albeit with four arms.  She is now an agent of the Super Human Advanced Defense Executive ([[S.H.A.D.E.]], a parody of [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]]'s [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]), a secret government agency who temporarily drafts Frankenstein as well.  Of their previous relationship, she says, "It's nothing personal, but you were never my type."

In the final issue, he stowed away on a time-ship which brought him to the Sheeda realm of Summer's End. There, he threatened to kill the Sheeda-Queen if she did not return to stand trial for genocide. She countered that it was only just to feed on a self-destroying society. He countered by bombing her world-destroying fleet, killing her time-yacht's steersman, and hijacking the ship to the present.  Once in the present, though, [[Klarion]] gains control of Frankenstein using a witch-brand, used to control Grundies, and forces him to take the castle back to the future.  Frankenstein's current fate is unknown.

He appears briefly in ''[[Infinite Crisis #7]]'' (which takes place one week after the Frankenstein miniseries) implying his continued activity in the DC Universe.

Frankenstein is armed with a three-foot-long sword, which he claims once belonged to the [[Archangel Michael]], and a large antique pistol, which he calls his 'steam-gun'.

A character called [[Young Frankenstein (comics)|Young Frankenstein]] has appeared in [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]] as a member of the team during the "Lost Year" covered by [[52 (comics)]]. More information about the character, including his relation, if any, with Frankenstein, is forthcoming.
