'''Paladin''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character, a [[mercenary]]. He first appeared in ''[[Daredevil (comics)|Daredevil]]'' (1st series) #150 (January [[1978]]). While he claims that Paladin is his real name, he often goes by the name '''Paul Denning''' (an obvious play on his [[nom de guerre]]). Though not precisely a [[supervillain]], his mercenary activities  often bring him into conflict with [[superhero]]es. 

==History==
An unabashed womanizer, Paladin will often flirt with any woman who catches his eye. He briefly dated the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] at a time when she was separated from [[Hank Pym]], much to the [[Black Knight (comics)|Black Knight]]'s jealously, who was also attracted to her.
. For a time, he also enlisted [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]] into helping him retrieve a sword for Adrienne Frost, the sister of current X-Men member [[Emma Frost]]. During this period, the mutant known as [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] was strongly attracted to Paladin, but that affection disappeared when Generation X and Paladin later went their sperate ways. He has also been a longtime ally to [[Silver Sable]] and her Wild Pack organization. Paladin's strength, speed, stamina and reflexes are all slightly superhuman; he can lift up to one ton of weight unaided. He is also a highly skilled hand-to-hand combatant, marksman, actor, espionage agent, bodyguard and detective.

Paladin has a certain amount of honor. For example, he was once hired by a corrupt government to assist rebels as part of a sting operation. He aided the rebels in a bombing-laying operation at a government facility. When the rebels were caught, his government handler remarked how lucky they were that the bomb had not gone off. Paladin replied, "I'm sorry, that would have been extra," and activated the bomb by remote control while driving away.(''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'', Vol 2, #16)

While he has been written using lethal force, his preferred weapon is his stun gun, which disrupts the nervous system sufficiently to render most people unconscious. 

Very recently, Paladin took down Daredevil with a sniper rifle from a helicopter at a great distance.  He did so for the FBI, in exchange for getting his record expunged.  The hit, while serious, was not fatal.

He is a main character in the new [[Heroes for Hire]] series, although as Misty Knight said he was just there for the money. As it turns out, he was a traitor to the group, only using the Heroes as a means to hunt down [[Captain America]] for [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]. He single handedly defeated Captain America and the entire Heroes for Hire team, with the exceptions of [[Tarantula (comics)|Tarantula]], and [[Orka (comics)|Orka]], who weren't present when the fight took place, with a special gas weapon that affected the nervous system. He them radioed S.H.I.E.L.D. and told them he had Captain America in custody. However, he did not account for [[Shang-Chi]]'s ability to hold his breath over an extended period (thanks to his martial arts training) and was overpowered by him. Shang-Chi then aided Captain America. Captain America switched costumes with Paladin so S.H.I.E.L.D. took Paladin into custody in his place. It is unlikely he will be paid for his botched job.
