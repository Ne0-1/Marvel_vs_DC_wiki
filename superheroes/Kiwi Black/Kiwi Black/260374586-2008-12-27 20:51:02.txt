'''Kiwi Black''' is a fictional [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] character in the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe. His first appearance was in ''Uncanny X-Men #429''.

==Fictional character biography==
Little is known about the past of Kiwi Black, apart from that his mother is from [[Ruatoria]], [[New Zealand]]<ref>''Marvel Atlas'' #1</ref> and his father, Azazel, seduced her.  Because of this Kiwi Black is the half-brother of [[Nightcrawler]] and [[Abyss (comics)|Abyss]].  

He was a mutant bred by [[Azazel (Marvel Comics)|Azazel]] to help him transport his army to [[Earth]] from the hellish dimension they had been trapped in.  However after he survived a summoning ritual (one of three to survive) meant to free Azazel's army, he started secretly operating within Azazel's castle to free the X-Men. Kiwi rejected his father’s influence, and allied himself with the [[X-Men]] in order to eliminate Azazel’s army. In the process, he decapitated one of Azazel's thugs and gained respect from [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]].

===Decimation/M-Day===
After M-Day, it was revealed that Kiwi Black was among the many mutants depowered, as listed by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], alongside his half-brother, Abyss<ref>''New Avengers'' #18</ref>.

==Powers and abilities==
Kiwi Black can focus bio-energy through his body to increase his already impressive strength with his natural physical build, and the potency of his physical attacks. His energy empowered attacks are so powerful because of his technique of releasing energy at the point of contact, therefore enhance his strength to the point where he can break through boulders with his bare hands or, create a gigantic crater by simply kicking the ground. These attacks have been described as a "Being hit with a sledgehammer shot out of a cannon at 220 MPH" by his creator [[Chuck Austen]].

But using this method of energy transference as well as others he has developed, Kiwi Black is able to use his energy to affect, and/or alter the surrounding area or another person. Touching someone and using intricate combinations of his and their energy to cause an internal malfunction in the person being touched, such as making the heart fail or explode all together or even scramble superhuman powers. By slamming his fist into the ground, he can direct energy through the ground to make a pillar of rock/spikes come up from the ground.

It has been speculated that he may even be able to cause volcanoes to explode by disrupting them with his energy affecting powers and that he would be able to physically attack astral projection if he could sense them.
