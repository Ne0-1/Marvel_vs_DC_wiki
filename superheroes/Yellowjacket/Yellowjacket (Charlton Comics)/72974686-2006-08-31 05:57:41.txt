'''Yellowjacket''' was the first super-hero character published by the company that would become [[Charlton Comics]] in the mid-1940s.

The character starred in his own title, ''Yellowjacket'', that was published for 10 issues from 1944 to 1946.  These issues were apparently published by "E. Levy/Frank Comunale", which later became Charlton.  When the title was renamed ''Jack in the Box'', Yellowjacket appeared in the first issue, #11.  He also appeared in ''TNT Comics'' #1, which was published by "Charles Publications".

Yellowjacket is really crime writer, Vince Harley.  He found he had the ability to control [[yellowjackets]], and used that ability to fight crime.
