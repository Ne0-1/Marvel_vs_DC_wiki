'''Ogre''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe.

==History ==

Ogre was originally an operative of the mutant terrorist organization [[Factor Three]]. Ogre used a mind control helmet to brainwash [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]] who soon battled the original [[X-Men]]. 

When Factor Three disbanded Ogre remained behind in Mount Charteris (outside Burton Canyon, Colorado) one of their many mountain bases. Over the years the base was occupied by [[HYDRA]], the [[Sons of the Serpent]], August Masters and the [[Masters of Evil]] (led by the second [[Crimson Cowl]]). When [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]] was held prisoner by the Masters of Evil, Ogre slipped a key into her room which released her from her shackles, this helped Moonstone and the [[Thunderbolts]] defeat the Masters.

[[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], the new leader of the Thunderbolts, suggested that they keep Mount Charteris as their own headquarters. As time passed, the Thunderbolts began to notice strange things happening in their headquarters. [[Atlas (comics)|Atlas's]] damaged costume was repaired. A hover vehicle Hawkeye borrowed from [[Champions (comics)|the Champions]] was rennovated overnight. The team began to realize someone was hiding in the unexplored levels of Mount Charteris and began to investigate.

After a brief skirmish with the Thunderbolts Atlas convinced Ogre that they meant him no harm. The Ogre recounted his story and Hawkeye offered Ogre membership. Soon after the Thunderbolts went back to their part of the mountain base and Ogre was knocked unconscious by [[Fixer (comics)|Techno]], a former member of the Thunderbolts. Techno had Ogre placed in a cryogenic sleep. Techno then morphed his appearance so he would resemble Ogre and took his place on the team.

For months Techno pretended to be Ogre causing mischief amongst his former teammates. When Techno was seemingly destroyed by [[Scourge of the Underworld|Scourge]] saving [[Jolt (comics)|Jolt]] (who had also been in cryogenic sleep), Ogre was released. 

Soon after it was revealed that Ogre had his own cryogenic prisoner that he had been holding captive for several years. Sonny Baredo aka [[Humus Sapien]] was kidnapped by Factor Three years earlier but it was decided he was too dangerous to be released. When the Thunderbolts disbanded [[Redeemers (comics)|the Redeemers]] and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] took over operation of Mount Charteris. A resurrected Techno, now back in his human body, began to investigate and released Humus Sapien. Mount Charteris was destroyed as a result. The Redeemers fought Humus Sapien and discovered that every time he uses his powers someone else on earth died. Eventually Humus Sapien decided to leave earth through an extra-dimensional tesseract rather than endanger innocents. Ogre chose to leave Earth with Humus Sapien in part to redeem his part in keeping Humus Sapien prisoner.
