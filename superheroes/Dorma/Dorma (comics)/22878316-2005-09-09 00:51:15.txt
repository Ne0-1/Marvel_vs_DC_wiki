'''Lady Dorma''' is a fictional character in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel Universe]].

A native of the undersea kingdom of [[Atlantis]], Dorma was [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]]'s closest confidante and lover in many of his  appearances in the late [[1960s]] and early [[1970s]].

She was engaged to be married to the Sub-Mariner when she was kidnapped and murdered by [[Llyra]], who assumed her identity and tricked Namor into marrying her instead (''Sub-Mariner'' #37 [[May]], [[1971]]).
