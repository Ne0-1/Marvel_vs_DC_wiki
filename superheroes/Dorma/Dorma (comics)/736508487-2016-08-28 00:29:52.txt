'''Dorma''' is a fictional character appearing in comic books by [[Timely Comics]] (later known as [[Marvel Comics]]).

A native of the undersea kingdom of [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlantis]], the character was [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]]'s cousin and his close confidant in many of his original appearances in the 1940s, and was reintroduced in the late 1960s and early 1970s as his lover and wife-to-be, before her death.

==Publication history==
Dorma first appeared with a cameo appearance in 1939 in the prototype for a planned giveaway comic titled ''[[Motion Picture Funnies Weekly]]'', produced by the comic book packager [[Funnies, Inc.]] The only eight known samples among those created to send to theater owners were discovered in the estate of the deceased publisher in 1974. When the giveaway idea fell through, creator [[Bill Everett]] used the character for ''[[Marvel Mystery Comics|Marvel Comics]]'' #1, the first comic book by Funnies, Inc. client [[Timely Comics]], predecessor of Marvel. <!--primary Motion Picture Funnies Weekly source: The Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide, annual publication--> The final panel of the earlier, unpublished eight-page Sub-Mariner story had included a "Continued Next Week" box that reappeared, sans lettering, in an expanded 12-page story. Dorma's first full appearance followed in ''Marvel Comics'' #1.

Her first [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] appearance is in ''Fantastic Four Annual'' #1.

==Fictional character biography==
Dorma, an Atlantean aristocrat, was a close friend of Namor during their childhood. She fell in love with him when they grew up, but Namor fell for the surface-worlder Betty Dean, a policewoman. When Namor's enemy [[Destiny (Paul Destine)|Paul Destine]], empowered by [[Serpent Crown]], destroyed Atlantis and left Namor an [[amnesia]]c vagrant, Dorma and the other Atlanteans became nomads. Dorma believed that Destine had killed Namor and was heartbroken.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

Many years later, the [[Fantastic Four]]'s [[Human Torch (Johnny Storm)|Human Torch]] restored Namor's memory and Namor returned to Atlantis. Seeing Atlantis in ruins, he attacked the surface world, but fell in love with Susan Storm, the [[Invisible Woman|Invisible Girl]]. With the help of the Fantastic Four, Namor found the surviving Atlanteans and they returned to Atlantis. Dorma was engaged to the [[Krang (Marvel Comics)|Warlord Krang]], but left him for Namor. When she found out that Namor was in love with Susan Storm, she tried to kill her and very nearly succeeded.  Sue was a prisoner and her arms were tied behind her back. Lady Dorma broke the glass wall of Atlantis saying, "let us see if the surface girl can breathe water".<ref>''Fantastic Four Annual'' #1</ref>  Sue decided to make a futile attempt to reach the surface, but with her arms tied behind her back, the blonde girl could barely swim at all and got helplessly caught in deadly kelp at the bottom of the sea.  With her air running out, Namor found her, saved her and took her to a hospital. His actions alienated Dorma and the other Atlanteans who saw the surface-worlders as enemies and they abandoned Namor.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

Namor would later return to the throne of Atlantis. Krang became an enemy of Namor and tried to kill Namor and take the throne himself, but Dorma aided Namor in defeating Krang. Namor and Dorma became lovers and she became one of his most trusted advisors and allies.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

Dorma was engaged to be married to the Sub-Mariner when she was kidnapped by [[Llyra]], who assumed her identity and tricked Namor into marrying her instead, but according to Atlantean law, Dorma was now Namor's wife, not Llyra, despite her absence from the wedding ceremony. Furious, Llyra fled to the surface world, followed by an equally enraged Namor. Llyra returned to the imprisoned Dorma and smashed Dorma's water-filled prison. Unable to breathe out of water, Dorma suffocated, but not before she struck down Llyra and saved her husband's life.<ref>''Sub-Mariner'' #37 (May, 1971)</ref>
