==Fictional character biography==
Arclight served with the American ground forces during the [[Vietnam War]], and she is still haunted by memories of that place.  She has redirected her rage into bodybuilding, which she uses to augment her mutant powers.  Her mutant ability enables her to create [[shock wave|shockwaves]] through physical contact, usually combined with her super strength in form of punches and blows.  During a few of her appearances she has been shown to project a bright light upon impact of her hands.

As a war veteran, she is well versed in battle, and is known as one of the most bloodthirsty members of the [[Mutant Massacre|mutant massacring]] group, the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]]. Her relationship with teammate [[Scalphunter (Marvel Comics)|Scalphunter]] has also made her second-in-command. During their first mission, Arclight kills dozens of underground-dwelling mutants known as [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]]. She also took some time off to answer [[Superia]]'s invitation to join her female group of villains, the [[Femizons]]. 

Though the details of her recruitment by [[Mister Sinister]] to the Marauders remain unrevealed, she has participated in all of the group's major operations.  Due to Sinister cloning the Marauders multiple times, it is hard to determine if the 'original' Arclight has been present in all of them.

Following [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], Arclight became one of the so-called [[X-Men: The 198|198]], one of the few remaining mutants retaining their powers, and a refugee at the [[X-Mansion]]. She later returns as a member of the New Marauders, alongside old members like Scalphunter and new ones like [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]] and [[Lady Mastermind]].<ref>''[[X-Men (vol. 2)|X-Men]]'' #200</ref>

During Messiah Complex in the final battle on Muir Isle, she is seemingly killed by [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]].

==Powers and abilities==
Arclight possesses the ability to generate seismic energies with her hands that cause shock waves and geo tremors. She also has superhuman strength, stamina, resiliency and durability.

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the [[Age of Apocalypse]], a member of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood]] is named Arclight.  However, this Arclight was a male, and it is unknown if he has any relation to the [[Earth-616]] version, or what powers he possesses.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Arclight made numerous cameo appeareances in the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men Animated Series]]'', most notably in the episode "[[Sanctuary (X-Men episode)|Sanctuary]]," where she, alongside Blockbuster, joins [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]'s [[Asteroid M|mutant haven]].{{Fact|date=October 2008}}
* Arclight first appears in the ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men]]'' episode "eXcessive Force". Similar to her Age of Apocalypse counterpart, this Arclight is male. He is supposedly the field leader of the Marauders taking direct orders from Mister Sinister. He utilizes the same shockwave powers as his mainstream and movie counterparts. When Vertigo arrives to warn him about Cyclops coming, he is attacked while Vertigo flees. Mister Sinister gets contacted by him and is given orders to give Cyclops information that would lead him into a trap.{{Fact|date=December 2008}}

===Film===
* Arclight appeared in the [[2006]] motion picture ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'', played by [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] fashion [[Model (person)|model]] and [[actress]] [[Omahyra Mota]]. Arclight had no lines in the film.  In the movie, her shockwave-based superpowers are more refined than in the comic book: her shockwaves project in an outward fashion and she can target specific materials. She is a member of the Omegas and was killed along with [[Quill (comics)|Quill]] and [[Psylocke]] by [[Dark Phoenix Saga|Dark Phoenix]]'s disintegration wave.{{Fact|date=December 2008}}

==Notes==
{{Trivia|date=March 2008}}
*Arclight's codename comes from the [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]] bombings during the [[Vietnam War]], also called [[Operation Arc Light]].
*Arclight was at one point depicted as unusually tall, and with the physique of a bodybuilder, but in recent appearances she has gained a more conventional comic-book female appearance.
