'''Moonglow''' is a [[fictional character]] found in [[comic book]]s from [[Marvel Comics]]. She was a member of a team of superheroes, [[Squadron Supreme]].
 
'''Melissa Hanover''' (alias '''Moonglow (I)''') was recruited by Nighthawk to serve in his team of super powered "Redeemers" to fight the influence of the Squadron Supreme's "Utopia Program".  She had the ability to project illusions. Melissa Hanover was rather insecure, and used her powers to make herself look beautiful and glamourous, to hide her unattractive appearance.

'''[[Arcanna|Arcanna Jones]]''', working initially as a medium, started an activity as a professional crimefighter and Supreme Squadron asked her to join the group as '''[[Arcanna]]'''. She was present when both the Squadron and [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] battled Overmind and Null the Living Darkness.
When the Squadron was involved in its "Utopia Program", she was pregnant and could not take an active role.
Later, during the Nth Man's attack (who tried to consume the Squadron's universe) she tried to re-join the team. Because she'd had a child just a week previously, Arcanna was forbidden by Power Princess to go; so using her own illusionary abilities, she assumed the guise of '''Moonglow (II)'''. 

When the team left to confront the Nth Man, Melissa agreed to let Arcanna go in her place.
Little is known about Melissa's fate.

The Squadron (and Arcanna) saved their universe, paying the price of exile in alternate universe (the mainstream [[Marvel Universe]], also named [[Earth-616]]).


Note:

The Supreme Squadron members exist in numerous alternate universes, but their main and original timeline is [[Earth-712]].

== Powers ==
Moonglow's powers involved modifying others' perceptions. She was able to alter her appearance as well as others', in order to manipulate or confuse. Like most of the newer Redeemer characters she broke away from the pattern of being based on an existing [[DC Comics]] character and was an original creation.
