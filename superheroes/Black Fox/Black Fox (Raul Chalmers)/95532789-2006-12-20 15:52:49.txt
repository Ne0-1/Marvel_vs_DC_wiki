'''The Black Fox''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]].  He is a jewel thief with a long international criminal career. Though elderly, he was still active and looking to score one last big heist.  He came into conflict with the amazing [[Spider-Man]], often playing off Spider-Man's sympathy towards the elderly, and was forced by the [[Red Ghost]] to commit robberies for him.  He was also pursued by [[Silver Sable]] and [[Doctor Doom]], and his fiancee was murdered by the assassin [[Chance (comics)#Note|Chance]].
