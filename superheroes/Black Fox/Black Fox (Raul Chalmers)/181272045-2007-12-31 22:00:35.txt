Black Fox is a jewel thief with a long international career. In his sixties, he yearns to pull off one last big heist so that he can retire for good to the French Riviera. However, his retirement plans continue to be deferred due to unfortunate encounters with super-beings. In each of his encounters the Fox, having no super-human powers of his own, is in way over his head. The thief's usual response when caught by a superhero is to surrender and negotiate release, which he accomplishes with fabricated stories about his poor wife and children or his poor deceased mother. However, in his last encounter with [[Spider-Man]], the Fox was unable pull the same trick and was carted off to jail.

In addition to coming into conflict with Spider-Man, Black Fox has been forced to lead the [[Red Ghost]]'s super-apes on a robbery mission.  He has also been pursued by [[Silver Sable]] and [[Doctor Doom]], and had his fiancee murdered by the assassin [[Chance (comics)#Chance (Nicholas Powell)|Chance]]. 

Recently, he was defeated by [[Ant-Man (Eric O'Grady)|Ant-Man]], who took the jewels Fox stole to a [[pawn shop]] and sold them himself. Black Fox, however, tracked down O'Grady and forced the Ant-Man to repay him for the botched heist. Ant-Man and Black Fox then returned to the pawn shop together and held up the place. Since then Ant-Man and Black Fox have become partners in crime of sorts. Black Fox can often be seen at O'Grady's apartment playing on a [[Wii]] console.
