'''Radius (Jared Corbo)''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He is a former member of the superhero team [[Alpha Flight]]. He first appeared in ''Alpha Flight: In The Beginning'' #-1, and first appeared as Radius in ''Alpha Flight'' volume 2 #1 (both published in 1998).

==Character biography==

Jared and his younger half-brother Adrian (later codenamed [[Flex (comics)|Flex]]) were raised in the Hull House [[orphanage]], which was actually a facility operated by the [[Canada|Canadian]] government's secretive [[Department H (comics)|Department H]]. While Adrian became shy, reserved and bookish, Jared became athletically inclined, aggressive, and arrogant. Both brothers manifested [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] powers after [[puberty]]: Adrian gained the ability to transform parts of his body into blades, while Jared manifested a personal [[Force field (science fiction)|force field]] that could not be shut down. The brothers were recruited into a new [[incarnation]] of the Canadian superhero team Alpha Flight.

They assisted the new Alpha Flight in battling several foes, including the [[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac]], the [[Brass Bishop]], and Department H's own power-mad leader, Jeremy Clarke, who died of [[radiation]] poisoning during a Zodiac raid on the Department H headquarters. Their Alpha Flight team fought several members of the original Flight and later teamed up with them to defeat a new [[Weapon X]], who had been created by a rogue Department H scientist. Both groups of Alphans merged into a unified Alpha Flight following this adventure. The Corbo brothers and several other members of the new team were later reasigned to Alpha Flight's trainee team, [[Beta Flight]].

Radius was later recruited into the [[X-Corps]], a militaristic strike force founded by former [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]] headmaster and former [[X-Men|X-Man]] Sean Cassidy, a.k.a. [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]]. The X-Corps was ultimately betrayed by its criminal members, and Radius was defeated when the [[villain]] [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]] opened a chasm beneath Radius, swallowing him. Apparently Radius survived this to be depowered on M-Day. He was shown to be depowered in New Avengers #18.

It was revealed in ''Alpha Flight'' (2nd series) #10 that [[Unus the Untouchable]] was Radius' father after [[Flex (comics)|Flex]] started searching for their fathers through their adoption agency.

==Powers and abilities==
Radius generates a permanent force field around him that he is unable to deactivate. He does not feel the impact of blows upon it. While the shield is generally porous enough for him to breathe, he can make it almost impervious, even to air.

He can also create extensions of the field to use as a ranged attack, and brace objects against it to "fake" super-strength.

==Notes==
*'''Ralph Hutchins''' has been also called '''Radius''' which was his third form.  He is also known as '''Brute, Seeker, Torque, Earthlord''' and '''Entity'''.  He first appeared in ''She-Hulk'' vol. 1 #6 and as Radius in ''She-Hulk'' vol. 1 #24
