'''Radius (Jared Corbo)''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He is a former member of the superhero team [[Alpha Flight]]. He first appeared in ''Alpha Flight: In The Beginning'' #-1, and first appeared as Radius in ''Alpha Flight'' volume 2 #1 (both published in 1998).

Jared and his younger half-brother Adrian (later codenamed [[Flex (comics)|Flex]]) were raised in the Hull House orphanage, which was actually a facility operated by the [[Canada|Canadian]] government's secretive Department H. While Adrian became shy, reserved and bookish, Jared became athletically inclined, aggressive, and arrogant. Both brothers manifested [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] powers after puberty: Adrian gained the ability to transform parts of his body into blades, while Jared manifested a personal force field that could not be shut down. The brothers were recruited into a new incarnation of the Canadian superhero team Alpha Flight.

They assisted the new Alpha Flight in battling several foes, including the [[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac]], the [[Brass Bishop]], and Departent H's own power-mad leader, Jeremy Clarke, who died of radiation poisoning during a Zodiac raid on the Department H headquarters. Their Alpha Flight team fought several members of the original Flight and later teamed up with them to defeat a new [[Weapon X]], who had been created by a rogue Department H scientist. Both groups of Alphans merged into a unified Alpha Flight following this adventure. The Corbo brothers and several other members of the new team were later reasigned to Alpha Flight's trainee team, [[Beta Flight]].

Radius was later recruited into the [[X-Corps]], a militaristic strike force founded by former [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]] headmaster and former [[X-Men|X-Man]] Sean Cassidy, a.k.a. [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]]. Tthe X-Corps was ultimately betrayed by it's criminal members, and Radius was defeated when the [[villain]] [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]] opened a chasm beneath Radius, swallowing him. It is unknown if Radius survived.

It's been suggested that Radius' father is [[Unus the Untouchable]], but it has never been confirmed.
