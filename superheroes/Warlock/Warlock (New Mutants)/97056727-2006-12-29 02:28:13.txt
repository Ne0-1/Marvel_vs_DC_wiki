'''Warlock''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[cybernetic]] [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], affiliated with the original [[New Mutants]], a [[mutant]] superhero team.  He was created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Bill Sienkewicz]], and first appeared in ''New Mutants'' #21 (November 1984).

==Character biography==

Warlock is a member of the alien [[Technarchy]], a race of mechanical organisms that survive by infecting living creatures with the "techno-organic" transmode virus, before draining the life energy ("lifeglow") of the infected organism.  Warlock, unlike others of his race, possesses a distinctive degree of compassion, and as a result has been described as a mutant himself.  He is the son of the Technarch ruler, [[Magus (comics)|Magus]], who has battled the New Mutants and the [[X-Men]].  Warlock served as a member of the original New Mutants for much of that group's existence, and became the best friend of his teammate Doug Ramsey, alias [[Cypher (comics)|Cypher]], until Doug's death at the hands of the [[Ani-Mator]].  Warlock was subsequently killed on the island nation of [[Genosha]] during the "[[The X-Tinction Agenda|X-Tinction Agenda]]" [[fictional crossover|crossover]].

Warlock had a distinctive way of talking during his stint in the New Mutants comics, frequently referring to himself with the personal [[pronoun]] "self", and to his teammates as "selffriends". Doug, thanks to selflessly offering his life energy to keep Warlock alive during a dangerous mission earned the unique honorific title of "selfsoulfriend" or "selfsoulfriendcypherdoug".

Later, a group of humans called the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]] appeared.  This group had been mutated into techno-organic forms via the transmode virus, which had been extracted from Warlock's corpse.  One of the Phalanx was '''Douglock''', a lookalike of Doug Ramsey who had all of Doug's memories. Douglock joined the [[Europe]]an mutant superhero team [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]. While his team-mates were unerved by his similarity to Doug, Douglock was eventually accepted as his own person.

It was later revealed that Douglock was actually a reanimated Warlock who had been given Doug's memories. He then reverted to the name of Warlock and began a career as a solo adventurer,  briefly starring in his own title, ''Warlock'', written by [[Louise Simonson]] (who had previously been responsible for killing off both Doug and the original Technarchy Warlock) and drawn by [[Pasqual Ferry|Paschalis Ferry]]. During his adventures, Warlock was joined by a young girl named Hope whom he had unwittingly infected with the Techo-organic virus along with her pet monkey and a novice [[psychic]] named Psimon.

Apparently, Warlock retained his mutant powers during the [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].

==Ultimate Doug Ramsey==
In the ''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'' "Magnetic North" storyline, Doug Ramsey appears.  Whether or not this will lead into the Technarchy storyline is to be determined.  In this continuity, Doug Ramsey is based on [[Ken Jennings]] (of ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' fame) and is not a mutant; he is simply a staggeringly intelligent human being. Warlock made a [[cameo appearance]] in one issue, where he was seen fighting the [[X-Men]] in a gigantic form. However, this served primarily as an [[in-joke]].
