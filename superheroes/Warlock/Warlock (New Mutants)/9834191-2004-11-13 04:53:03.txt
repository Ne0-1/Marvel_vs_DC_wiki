'''Warlock''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[cybernetic]] [[alien]] [[superhero]] affiliated with [[Marvel Comics]]' [[mutant]] [[superhero]] team [[The New Mutants]].  He was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Bill Sienkewicz]].

Warlock is a member of the alien Technarchy, a race of mechanical organisms that survive by draining the life energy ("lifeglow") of living creatures by infecting them with the techno-organic "transmode virus".  Warlock, unlike others of his race, possesses a distinctive degree of compassion, and as a result has been described as a mutant himself.  He is the son of the Technarch ruler, [[Magus (comics)|Magus]], who has battled the New Mutants and the [[X-Men]].  Warlock served as a member of the original New Mutants for most of that group's existence, and become a close friend of his teammate Doug Ramsey, alias [[Cypher (comics)|Cypher]], until Doug's death at the hands of the Ani-Mator.  Warlock was subsequently killed on the island nation of [[Genosha]] during the "X-Cutioner's Song" [[fictional crossover|crossover]].

Later, a group of humans called the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]] appeared.  This group had been mutated into techno-organic forms via the transmode virus, which had been extracted from Warlock's corpse.  One of the Phalanx was "'''Douglock'''", a lookalike of Doug Ramsey who possessed all of Doug's memories and believed himself to actually be Doug Ramsey.  Douglock joined the [[Europe]]an mutant team [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]].  It was later revealed that Douglock was a reanimated Warlock who had been given Doug's memories; he then reverted to the name of Warlock and began a brief career as a solo adventurer.
