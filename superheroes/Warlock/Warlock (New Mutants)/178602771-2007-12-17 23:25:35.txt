'''Warlock''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[cybernetic]] [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], affiliated with the original [[New Mutants]], a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] superhero team.  He was created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Bill Sienkewicz]], and first appeared in ''New Mutants'' #21 (November 1984).

==Publication history==
Warlock briefly starred in his own self-titled series, written by [[Louise Simonson]] (who had previously been responsible for killing off both Doug and the original Technarchy Warlock) and drawn by [[Pasqual Ferry|Paschalis Ferry]]. 

==Fictional character biography==
Warlock is a member of the alien [[Technarchy]], a race of mechanical organisms that survive by infecting living creatures with the "[[techno-organic]]" transmode virus, before draining the life energy ("lifeglow") of the infected organism.  Warlock, unlike others of his race, possesses a distinctive degree of compassion, and as a result has been described as a mutant himself.  He is the son of the Technarch ruler, [[Magus (Technarchy)|Magus]], who has battled the New Mutants and the [[X-Men]]. Warlock served as a member of the original New Mutants for much of that group's existence, and became the best friend of his teammate Doug Ramsey, alias [[Cypher (comics)|Cypher]]. 

Despite Warlock's compassion, he did not completely understand that other humans and living animals were not to be drained of that 'lifeglow' at will. He at first restrained himself because his friends desired him to, though he disobeyed this during a trip to Asgard, where he killed and drained a dragon while lost in Hela's realm. 

His initial trip to Asgard came around because the Asgardian god Loki wished to gain revenge on the X-Men. Because the New Mutants were vacationing with Storm, Loki's ally the [[Enchantress (comics)|Enchantress]] mistook them for the X-Men. During this adventure, like with many others, Warlock would team up with Doug, keeping him safe. Though the two often worked together to confront enemies, Warlock's constant protection only served to lessen Doug's self-esteem.

His shapeshifting abilities led him into a confrontation with the [[Impossible Man]]. This soon snowballed into an earth-threatening incident as both entities tried to outdo each other. This only ended when Warlock showcased his ability to change color, something which the Impossible Man could not do. 

Doug's death at the hands of the [[Ani-Mator]] understandably devastates Warlock, leading him to go so far as to steal Doug's body. With the help of the rest of the New Mutants, he came to terms with Doug's death (and returned the body to its rightful place). He continued to serve with the team, which led to a second trip to Asgard. Warlock and two new friends, [[Meltdown (comics)|Meltdown]] and [[Hrimhari]], became separated from the rest. They traveled Asgard together. They were 'rescued' from imprisonment by the children of [[Volstagg]], who sent them to talk with the mighty being [[Tiwaz]]. The trio eventually joins with a force to rescue the ruler of Asgard from an assassination attempt. During the crisis known as [[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]], his shapeshifting skills became vital in neutralizing the demonic threats. Warlock was kidnapped from the grounds of the X-Mansion, along with his friends [[Rictor]], Meltdown and Wolfsbane. They ended up on the island nation of Genosha, which was ruled by [[Cameron Hodge]]. Warlock was killed in an attempt by Hodge to steal his powers. The news of his death was broadcast worldwide, a public relations disaster for Genosha. The world believed Warlock to be a 'normal' human mutant.

Wolfsbane, who due to her own problems decided to stay on the island, asked Meltdown to put Warlock's ashes on Doug's grave. 

Warlock had a distinctive way of talking during his stint in the New Mutants comics, frequently referring to himself with the personal [[pronoun]] "self", and to his teammates as "selfriends". Doug, thanks to selflessly offering his life energy to keep Warlock alive during a dangerous mission in [[Asgard]] earned the unique honorific title of "selfsoulfriend" or "selfsoulfriendcypherdoug".

===Douglock===
Later, a group of humans called the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]] appeared.  This group had been mutated into techno-organic forms via the transmode virus, which had been extracted from Warlock's ashes.  One of the Phalanx was '''Douglock''', a lookalike of Doug Ramsey who had all of Doug's memories. Douglock joined the [[Europe]]an mutant superhero team [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]. At that time the team was based on [[Muir Island]], which was owned and run by [[Moira MacTaggert]]. While his team-mates were unnerved by his similarity to Doug, Douglock was eventually accepted as his own person. He acted as a tutor to [[Meggan]] and enjoyed a brief romance with fellow teammate Wolfsbane, foster daughter to Moira. This romance would cause him to react irrationally and dangerously at times, mainly destroying valuable scientific research because he did not understand it was more important than his budding relationship with Wolfsbane.

He would also mishandle other aspects of Earthly life. Despite his beliefs he could handle it, Douglock overdid the vodka during [[Captain Britain]]'s bachelor party and passed out. Temporary Excalibur ally [[Mimic (comics)|Mimic]] put him in the Captain's old room to sleep it off, but the problems only continued from there as the alcohol would cause temporary memory problems. 

It was later revealed that Douglock was actually a reanimated Warlock who had been given Doug's memories. He then reverted to the name of Warlock and began a career as a solo adventurer.  During his adventures, Warlock was joined by a young girl named [[Hope (comics)|Hope]] who could infect others with the techno-organic virus without being affected by it herself. Hope had a pet monkey that had been physically affected by the virus also. They were later joined by a novice [[psychic]] named Psimon, whose group of allies combated techno-organic threats. Early on they confronted [[Spider-Man]], would team up with Shadowcat, cause trouble for Iron Man and fight against the villain [[Psycho-Man]].

Douglock later went back to his old home on [[Muir Island]] where he became re-acquainted with his flame Wolfsbane and Moira MacTaggert.

An altered form of [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]] attacked the island. Hope, Psimon and Wolfsbane joined Douglock's efforts to defeat this new threat. Later, all would travel to New York and assist the Avengers in defeating Warlock's father, the Magus.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Doug Ramsey===
In the ''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'' "Magnetic North" storyline, Doug Ramsey appears.  Whether or not this will lead into the Technarchy storyline is to be determined.  In this continuity, Doug Ramsey is based on [[Ken Jennings]] (of ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' fame) and is not a mutant; he is simply a staggeringly intelligent human being. Warlock made a [[cameo appearance]] in one issue, where he was seen fighting the [[X-Men]] in a gigantic form. However, this served primarily as an [[in-joke]].

==In other media==
===Television===
Warlock in his original incarnation appeared in the Phalanx Covenant two-part episode of the ''[[X-Men (animated series)|X-Men'' animated series]]. 

In that story his history was altered so that he actually came to Earth in an effort to escape his destiny of merging with the Phalanx. He and his girlfriend crashed on Earth, and although he escaped the wreckage, his girlfriend did not, ending up captured by the villainous [[Cameron Hodge]] and used to recreate the Phalanx on Earth. After the defeat of the Phalanx, and the recovery of his girlfriend, they both left Earth to return to their homeworld to influence the Phalanx for the better.
