'''Warlock''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[cybernetic]] [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[superhero]] published by [[Marvel Comics]].  He first appeared in ''[[New Mutants]]'' vol. 1 #18 (August 1984), and was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Bill Sienkewicz]].

==Publication history==
Warlock briefly starred in his own self-titled series, written by [[Louise Simonson]] (who had previously been responsible for killing off both Doug and the original [[Technarchy]] Warlock) and drawn by [[Pasqual Ferry|Paschalis Ferry]]. 

==Fictional character biography==
===New Mutant===
Warlock is a member of the alien Technarchy, a race of mechanical organisms that survive by infecting living creatures with the "[[techno-organic]]" transmode virus, before draining the life energy ("lifeglow") of the infected organism.  Warlock, unlike others of his race, possesses a distinctive degree of compassion, and as a result has been described as a mutant himself. He is the son of the Technarch ruler, [[Magus (Technarchy)|Magus]], who has battled the New Mutants and the [[X-Men]]. Warlock served as a member of the original New Mutants for much of that group's existence, and became the best friend of his teammate Doug Ramsey, alias [[Cypher (comics)|Cypher]]. 

Despite Warlock's compassion, he did not completely understand that other humans and living animals were not to be drained of that 'lifeglow' at will. He at first restrained himself because his friends desired him to, though he disobeyed this during a trip to [[Asgard (Marvel Comics)|Asgard]], where he killed and drained a dragon while lost in [[Hela (Marvel Comics)|Hela's]] realm. However, he did this solely as a means of survival as he had lost a great deal of his own personal energies at the time.

His initial trip to Asgard came around because the [[Asgardians (Marvel Comics)|Asgardian]] god [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]] wished to gain revenge on the X-Men. Because the New Mutants were vacationing with [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], Loki's ally the [[Enchantress (comics)|Enchantress]] mistook them for the X-Men. During this adventure, like with many others, Warlock would team up with Doug, keeping him safe. Though the two often worked together to confront enemies, Warlock's constant protection only served to lessen Doug's self-esteem.

His shape-shifting abilities led him into a confrontation with the [[Impossible Man]]. This soon snowballed into an earth-threatening incident as both entities tried to outdo each other. This only ended when Warlock showcased his ability to change color, something which the Impossible Man could not do. 

Doug's death at the hands of the [[Ani-Mator]] understandably devastated Warlock, leading him to go so far as to steal Doug's body. With the help of the rest of the New Mutants, he came to terms with Doug's death (and returned the body to its rightful place). He continued to serve with the team, which led to a second trip to Asgard. Warlock and two new friends, [[Tabitha Smith|Boom Boom]] and [[Hrimhari]], became separated from the rest. They traveled Asgard together. They were 'rescued' from imprisonment by the children of [[Volstagg]], who sent them to talk with the mighty being [[Tiwaz]]. The trio eventually joined with a force to rescue the ruler of Asgard from an assassination attempt.

During the crisis known as [[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]], his shape-shifting skills became vital in neutralizing the demonic threats.

Warlock was kidnapped from the grounds of the X-Mansion, along with his friends [[Rictor]], Boom Boom and [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]], and ended up on the island nation of [[Genosha]], which was ruled by [[Cameron Hodge]]. Warlock was killed in an attempt by Hodge to steal his powers. The news of his death was broadcast worldwide, a public relations disaster for Genosha, since the world believed Warlock to be a 'normal' human mutant. Wolfsbane, who due to her own problems decided to stay on the island, asked Boom Boom to put Warlock's ashes on Doug's grave. 

Warlock had a distinctive way of talking during his stint in the New Mutants comics, frequently referring to himself with the personal [[pronoun]] "self", and to his teammates as "selfriends". Doug, thanks to selflessly offering his life energy to keep Warlock alive during a dangerous mission in Asgard earned the unique honorific title of "selfsoulfriend" or "selfsoulfriendcypherdoug". Danielle Moonstar also gained a unique title from Warlock, likely due to her Native American ancestry, calling her "chiefriend" or "chiefriendani"

===Douglock===
{{main|Cypher (comics)}}
Later, a group of humans called the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]] appeared. This group had been mutated into techno-organic forms via the transmode virus, which had been extracted from Warlock's ashes. One of the Phalanx was '''Douglock''', a lookalike of Doug Ramsey who had all of Doug's memories. Douglock joined the European mutant superhero team [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]. At that time the team was based on [[Muir Island]], which was owned and run by [[Moira MacTaggert]]. While his team-mates were unnerved by his similarity to Doug, Douglock was eventually accepted as his own person. He acted as a tutor to [[Meggan]] and enjoyed a brief romance with fellow teammate Wolfsbane, foster daughter to Moira. This romance would cause him to react irrationally and dangerously at times, mainly destroying valuable scientific research because he did not understand it was more important than his budding relationship with Wolfsbane.

In a bid to seize control of the UK, the covert intelligence operation, [[Black Air]] allied themselves with the London Branch of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] in order to raise an ancient demon from its crypt below London and use the ensuing chaos to their advantage. Black Air kidnapped Douglock to be used as the conduit to the crypt. However, after being lost in the time stream [[Captain Britain]] spent some time in an alternate timeline where Black Air was successful in its plans, leading to a dystopic future. Using this knowledge he and Excalibur were able to defuse the Hellfire Club, enter Black Air's HQ, rescue Douglock and stop the demon's resurrection.

Douglock would continue to mishandle other aspects of Earthly life. Despite his beliefs he could handle it, Douglock became inebriated during [[Captain Britain]]'s [[bachelor party]] and passed out, and later experienced temporary memory problems as a result of the episode.

===Return as Warlock===
It was later revealed that Douglock is actually a reanimated Warlock who had been given Doug's memories. He then reverts to the name of Warlock and began a career as a solo adventurer.  During his adventures, Warlock is joined by a young girl named [[Hope (comics)|Hope]] who could infect others with the techno-organic virus without being affected by it herself. Hope has a pet monkey that had been physically affected by the virus also. They are later joined by a novice [[psychic]] named Psimon, whose group of allies combated techno-organic threats. Early on they confront [[Spider-Man]], would team up with [[Shadowcat]], cause trouble for [[Iron Man]] and fight against the villain [[Psycho-Man]].

Warlock later heads back to his old home on Muir Island where he becomes re-acquainted with his old flame Wolfsbane and her adoptive mother, Moira MacTaggert.

An altered form of [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]] attacks the island. Hope, Psimon and Wolfsbane join Warlock's efforts to defeat this new threat. Later, all would travel to New York and assist the Avengers in defeating Warlock's father, the Magus.

===Nova===
{{see also|Nova (comics)}}
While [[Nova (comics)|Richard Rider (Nova)]] was searching for the Technarchy home world called '''Kvch''' in hope of fighting his Phalanx infection, he finds the planet covered with cities, and itself appears to be techno-organic in nature. Nova then finds the only living beings as Warlock, and his adopted charge, [[Tyro (comics)|Tyro]]. Warlock gave Tyro his non-aggressive form of the transmode virus, and is raising Tyro in hopes that he can slowly but surely change Technarch society into a more benevolent and peaceful one. He also reveals that he cannot cure Nova, let alone stop the Phalanx infection, as doing so would kill him, and he can't give up on the Technarchy. At that same time however, [[Gamora]] and [[Drax the Destroyer|Drax]] appear on the homeworld, and the Phalanx virus transforms them into a Babel Spire, which summons an adult Technarch Siredam.
Warlock however is forced to desperate measures: to ensure Tyro's safety, he sends him away, using all of his lifeglow to purge from Nova the transmode virus. Warlock's dying wish is for Nova to hold back the Siredam, coming to challenge Tyro, giving the youngling enough time to escape. However Tyro comes back, stricken by his surrogate father's sacrifice, and gambles his life in an attempt to "reprogram" the Siredam's body - and all of its Lifeglow reserves. Now in possession of a Siredam's form and cosmic level abilities, Tyro is able to spare some of his inestimable Lifeglow reserves to resurrect Warlock. Warlock than agrees to help Nova in his battle against [[Ultron]] and the Phalanx, and as Tyro before, gambles that his mutant strain of the Transmode Virus could be able to disrupt the Phalanx strain, and purges Ultron out of [[Adam Warlock]]'s body, allowing for his ultimate defeat. Along with Tyro and [[Wraith_(Annihilation)#Wraith_.28Zak-Del.29|Wraith]], he stays in the former Phalanx zones to heal infected people with Tyro's lifeglow and Wraith's exolons. <ref>Annihilation Conquest #6</ref>

==Other versions==
===Exiles===
The reality-hopping [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]] once visited a world where Doug Ramsey was infected by the [[Legacy Virus]]. Trying to save Ramsey's life, Warlock bonded with him, combining their life forces into one. Once the virus was introduced to Warlocks unique physiology, it mutated and became even more contagious. With over half the world infected by this new technological virus (called Vi-Locks), Doug Ramsey was kept in stasis. He was killed by one of the infected, once it found out the Exiles were trying to create a cure based on Ramsey's original strain of the virus.

===Ultimate Doug Ramsey===
In the ''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'' "Magnetic North" storyline, Doug Ramsey appears.  Whether or not this will lead into the Technarchy storyline is to be determined.  In this continuity, Doug Ramsey is based on [[Ken Jennings]] (of ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' fame) and is not a mutant; he is simply a staggeringly intelligent human being. Warlock made a [[cameo appearance]] in one issue, where he was seen fighting the [[X-Men]] in a gigantic form. However, this served primarily as an [[in-joke]].

==Other Media==
===Television===
Warlock in his original incarnation appeared in the Phalanx Covenant two-part episode of the ''[[X-Men (animated series)|X-Men]]'' animated series voiced by [[David Corban]]. In that story his history was altered so that he actually came to Earth in an effort to escape his destiny of merging with the Phalanx. He and his girlfriend crashed on Earth, and although he escaped the wreckage, his girlfriend did not, ending up captured by the villainous [[Cameron Hodge]] and used to recreate the Phalanx on Earth. After the defeat of the Phalanx, and the recovery of his girlfriend, they both left Earth to return to their home world to influence the Phalanx for the better.
