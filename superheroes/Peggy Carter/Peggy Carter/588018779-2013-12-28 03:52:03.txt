'''Margaret "Peggy" Carter''' is a fictional [[comic book]] character appearing in books published by [[Marvel Comics]], usually as a supporting character in books featuring [[Captain America]]. Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]], she first appeared in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #75 as a love interest of [[Captain America]], though she would later be known as a relative of a more recurring love interest after Captain America's decades-long suspended animation. She played a more central role in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] series of feature films, beginning with the 2011 film ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'', and continuing in the tie-in video game ''[[Captain America: Super Soldier]]'', a [[Marvel One Shot]] short film, and the 2014 feature film sequel ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]''.

==Publication history==
The character first appeared, unnamed, as a wartime love interest of Captain America in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #75 (March 1966), which was written by [[Stan Lee]] and penciled by [[Jack Kirby]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ign.com/characters/peggy-carter | title=Peggy Carter | publisher=[[IGN]] | accessdate=21 December 2013}}</ref> She appeared again as the older sister of [[Sharon Carter]] in ''Captain America'' #161 (May 1973). She was later [[retcon]]ned as Sharon's aunt due to the [[floating timeline|unaging nature]] of comic book characters. The character has appeared frequently in Captain America stories set during [[World War II]].

In the comics, Carter joins the [[French Resistance]] as a teenager, and serves on multiple operations alongside Captain America. The two fall in love, but an exploding shell gives her amnesia, and she is sent to live with her parents in Virginia. With Captain America thought dead, she lives a quiet life for many years. After Captain America reemerges, Peggy has a run-in with the villain [[Doctor Faustus (comics)|Doctor Faustus]], from which Captain America saves her. She joins the organization [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], eventually ends up in a nursing home, and later passes away.

===Alternative versions===
In the alternate reality created by in the 2005 "[[House of M]]" storyline, Captain America is never frozen in the Arctic, and instead marries Peggy shortly after World War II ends, though the two later divorce.<ref name="CAv5no10">''[[Captain America]]'' vol. 5 #10 (Oct. 2005).
