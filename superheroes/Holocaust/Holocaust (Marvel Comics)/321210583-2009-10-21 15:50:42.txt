'''Holocaust''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appeared in ''X-Men Alpha'' (February 1995), and was created by [[Scott Lobdell]] and [[Roger Cruz]].

==Fictional character biography==
Holocaust, originally known as '''Nemesis''',<ref>''X-Men Chronicles'' #1</ref> is the purported son of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] and also served as one of his [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Four Horsemen]] in the [[Age of Apocalypse]] timeline.  His physical form, nearly destroyed by [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], is contained in a [[crystalline]] exo-armor of [[phasing]] and [[shape-shifting]] properties. During the final battle in the Age of Apocalypse, Holocaust was transported into the [[Earth 616|main Marvel universe]] by the [[M'Kraan Crystal]].<ref>''X-Men Omega''</ref>  There, he continued to fight his archenemy, [[Nate Grey]] (who also had been transported from the Age of Apocalypse reality) while also acting as an agent for the psionic entity [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]].<ref>''X-Man'' #15-17-44</ref> Holocaust is later forced to join the reality-hopping group of [[superheroes]] known as the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]], but is eventually killed by a genocidal version of [[Hyperion (comics)|Hyperion]], who cracked open his crystal exo-armor and literally inhaled the villain, consuming the microwave energies his body was composed of.<ref>''Exiles'' #60-62</ref>

==Powers and abilities==

Holocaust possessed enhanced strength, endurance, reflexes, and physical invulnerability. He also possessed the power to generate highly destructive bio-nuclear microwave energy blasts and could drain the life-force from others to charge his phasing and shape-shifting crystalline exo-armor, which granted him extra protection from physical harm.

==Other Versions==

===Earth-616===
First mentioned in Stryfe's Stryke File, the Earth-616 version of Holocaust does not need a containment suit and is a silent killer. It has been theorized by fans that [[Fever Pitch (comics)| Fever Pitch]] may be actually the Marvel-616 counterpart of Holocaust. This is due to the fact that their mutant powers both reduced them to nothing more than living flaming skeletons (with highly similar appearances to each other). However this hasn't been confirmed off yet on-panel.

==Other media==
===Television===
* Holocaust makes a brief [[cameo appearance]] in the  ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men: The Animated Series]]'' episode "One Man's Worth."

===Video Games===
* Holocaust appears as a boss in the [[video game]] ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]'' voiced by [[Peter Lurie]]. He's a horseman of Apocalypse based at the Madri Temple and is the protector of the [[Stepford Cuckoos]] (who he refers to as the Trinity). He appears during the battle with the Stepford Cuckoos.

===Toys===
* Although the packaging refers to him as "Dark Nemesis", an action figure of Holocaust was made by Toy Biz in a ninja themed series of X-Men figures during the '90s.
* A Holocaust build-a-figure in the fourth series of Hasbro's [[Marvel Legends]] is being released in 2009.
