'''Holocaust''' (also known as '''Nemesis''') is a [[supervillain]] from the [[X-Men]] series of [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].  He first appeared as a member of the [[Age of Apocalypse]] alternate timeline in ''[[X-Men Alpha]]'' (1995).  He is the son of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] and leader of his forces in the Age of Apocalypse timeline.

==Character biography==
Holocaust played a significant part in the Age of Apocalypse storyline as head of the [[Horsemen (comics)|Horsemen]], a Biblically-inspired quartet of villains that enforced Apocalypse's cullings.  His corporeal form was destroyed by [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] after he murdered [[Scarlet Witch]].

Shortly before [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] prevented the Age of Apocalypse timeline from ever occurring, Holocaust was transported into the main [[Marvel Universe]] timeline when [[X-Man]] rammed a shard of the [[M'Krann Crystal]] into his armour.  Holocaust wound up on [[Avalon (comics)|Avalon]], where he fought [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]] and subsequently destroyed the space station, killing former [[New Mutants]] member [[Rusty (comics)|Rusty]] in the process.

Before his first appearance in ''X-Men Alpha'', Holocaust made a cameo in ''[[Stryfe's Strike File]]'' #1 (1993), which included several years worth of foreshadowing of [[Scott Lobdell]] and [[Fabian Nicieza]]'s X-Men plotlines.

Holocaust recently became 'unhinged' in time and was forced to join the time-travelling group of heroes known as the [[Exiles (comics)|Exiles]], which also included Holocaust's enemies from the Age of Apocalypse's X-Men, [[Blink (comics)|Blink]] and [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]]. Angry at being forced to work as someone else's lackey, Holocaust agreed to work with the Exiles so they could confront the [[Timebroker]] and get back to their respective realities.

When the Exiles went to the Timebroker's base, they discovered a twisted, dictator-like version of [[Hyperion (comics)|Hyperion]]. Angry, Holocaust attacked Hyperion but proved to be no match for the [[Eternals|Eternal]].

''"You're pure energy in a delicious candy shell! You're the kind of sunshine I soak up like a SPONGE! FACE IT, Holly -- I eat chumps like you for BREAKFAST!"''

Hyperion headbutted Holocaust's armor, cracking it open. He then inhaled Holocaust, leaving nothing left of Apocalypse's son but a broken shell.
