'''Mongoose''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] supervillain.

==History==
Apparently, Mongoose was a real [[mongoose]] before his powers were genetically engineered by the [[High Evolutionary]]. At one point, he arrived in New York where he was invited by [[Baron Zemo]] II to join his [[Masters of Evil]]. He later battled both [[Spider-Man]] and [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], and this confrontation eventually caused Thor and Mongoose to become mortal enemies. After his first defeat at the hands of Thor, Mongoose fled. But during his escape, he caused a fall of gliders which injured Erik Masterson, better known as [[Thunderstrike]].

In a later plot against Thor, Mongoose teamed-up with [[Quicksand (comics)|Quicksand]] and [[Count Tagar]] to obtain cell samples from Thor. He joined Tagar into using a weapon called the "vivisector" to obtain the samples, while Quicksand caused a distraction as she battled Thor so her teammates could obtain what they were after. But, Tagar hadn't enough from one sample and ordered Mongoose to obtain more. Mongoose kidnapped Masterson in return, though against Tagar's wishes. Mongoose also managed to launch an attack by the New Men against Thor at [[Wundagore|Wundagore Mountain]]. When Thor eventually realized what was going on, both Mongoose, Quicksand and Tagar were defeated, and Mongoose once again managed to escape. 

Mongoose tried to rejoin the New Men, but they denied affiliation with him because they heard of his villain tricks. Feeling furious over this, Mongoose later attacked both Thor and Erik Masterson. He was about to defeat them, but when the duo were assisted by another God called [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]], Mongoose realized he had no chance of winning and fled yet again. 

Ever since, Mongoose was seen fighting Thor and always ending up defeated, without much important things going on in his life.

===Civil War/The Initiative===
Mongoose was arrested by the current [[Baron Zemo]] and was offered a choice: go to jail or join Zemo's [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]. Refusing to go to jail, Mongoose of course accepted the offer to join the team. 

Mongoose has been identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes who appear on the cover of the comic book ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #1. <ref>[http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 ''Avengers: The Initiative'' #1 Character Map]</ref>
