'''Werewolf by Night''' (birth name '''Jacob Russoff''', legal name '''Jack Russell''') is a [[fictional character]], an [[anti-hero]]ic [[werewolf]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. The Werewolf by Night (usually referred to by other characters simply as the '''Werewolf''') first appeared in ''[[Marvel Spotlight]]'' vol. 1 #2.

==Publication history==
''Werewolf by Night, Volume 1'' ran for 43 issues during the 1970s. Issue #32 is notable for containing the [[first appearance]] of [[Moon Knight]]. Five 'Giant-Size' editions were also published during this time. Jack Russell also co-starred with [[Tigra]] in ''Giant Size Creatures'' #1, which was Tigra's first appearance.

Jack Russell was dormant for most of the 1980s. The character's appearance was radically revamped in ''Moon Knight, Volume 1'' #29. He guest-starred in various issues of ''[[Spider-Woman]], Volume 1'', ''[[West Coast Avengers]]'' and ''Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme''. 

Werewolf by Night was later revived in the pages of ''Marvel Comics Presents<i>, where he appeared irregularly from 1991-1993. He also made regular appearances as a supporting cast member in the pages of <i>[[Morbius the Living Vampire]]'' from 1993-1995. A letters page in an issue of ''Morbius'' mentioned that a ''Werewolf by Night'' mini-series by Len Kaminski and James Fry was in the works, but the mini-series was never published. 

''Werewolf by Night, Volume 2'' ran for 6 issues in the late 1990's. The series was written by [[Paul Jenkins]] and penciled by [[Leonardo Manco]]. After the book's cancellation, the story was continued in the pages of ''Strange Tales'', which also featured the [[Man-Thing]]. That volume of ''Strange Tales'' was canceled after only two issues due to poor sales.

In early 2007, Marvel published a one-shot entitled ''Legion of Monsters: Werewolf by Night'', with art by [[Greg Land]].

==Fictional character biography==
Jack Russell was born Jacob Russoff in [[Media≈ü]], [[Transylvania]], [[Romania]] to Gregor and Laura Russoff. Gregor was himself a [[werewolf]] who had inherited the family curse of [[lycanthropy]]. This curse had originated with their 18th century ancestor Grigori, who had been tainted by the [[Darkhold]], a [[grimoire]] of [[black magic]], and was subsequently bitten by a werewolf who served [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]]. Gregor himself was killed by an angry mob while Jacob was less than two years old. Soon after, Laura took Jacob and his sister, Lissa, to the [[United States]], where Laura married Gregor's brother Philip. The family adopted the last name of Russell, and Jacob's first name was changed to Jack.

Unfortunately for Jack, he would go on to inherit his father's curse on his eighteenth birthday. Under the light of a full moon, Jack would transform into the Werewolf: a ferocious monster who would prowl the area searching for victims. He would hunt down and maim or kill evildoers as he encountered them, although he would often attack others when threatened or panicked. A number of these victims returned as werewolves themselves, only to be killed by Jack when he learned of his creations' bloodlust. Most of Jack's adventures revolved around him searching for a way to control or cure his [[lycanthropy]]. During this time he formed an on-again off-again relationship with the empathic sorceress [[Topaz (Marvel Comics)|Topaz]]. He eventually came to grips with his nature and is currently able to exercise a large degree of control over his actions while in werewolf form, to the point that he can usually think and act normally while transformed.

There was a point in Jack's life where his werewolf form became advanced by a scientist named Dr. Karl Malus whose treatment caused Jack to more closely resemble an actual wolf by having the head of a wolf and a small tail.

Throughout the years, the Werewolf would encounter a variety of [[superhero]] and [[supernatural]] opponents and allies, including [[Moon Knight]], [[Spider-Man]], [[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]], [[Spider-Woman]], [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]], [[Frankenstein's Monster (Marvel Comics)|Frankenstein's monster]], the [[West Coast Avengers]], and the [[Midnight Sons]]. During the encounter with the Midnight Sons, the vampire hunter [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] was [[spiritual possession|possessed]] by the Darkhold and killed the Werewolf; when the spell was reversed, both Blade and Jack were returned to normal. More recently, Jack's niece was introduced as the [[Vampire by Night]], whose hereditary curse had been modified by the bite of a [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampire]].

In 2007's "Legion of Monsters: Werewolf By Night" special, Jack Russell came to Salvage, Alabama to save the Pynchon family from townsfolk led by Cal Escher. Young Rhonda Pynchon was the only one left after her mother and twin sister Suzie chose death by gun or knife. The girl was drowning her sorrows in Sullivan's bar right next to the cemetery when the gang attacked her, triggering a transformation in her with tarot cards and then trying to kill her. Russell interfered, transforming into Werewolf while Rhonda decided to do the same. After killing the violent gang, Russell and Rhonda left the town, determined to control their affliction and live their lives without fear.

==Powers and abilities==
Jack possesses the power of lycanthropy, the power to become a werewolf. In his wolfen form, he still resembles a human, albeit with fur and [[Canidae|canine]] features. During the nights of the full moon, his transformation is full and his head bears a more canine (wolf-like) appearance.  As a werewolf, Jack is superhumanly strong and fast, with animal-like senses of smell and hearing. His claws and fangs can rip most enemies to shreds, even other werewolves. Unlike most werewolves, Jack can become a werewolf whenever it is dark, and doesn't need the full moon to change. However, many of Jack's powers as a werewolf, particularly his physical strength, are at their peak during a full moon.

After a further enhancement with the magics of being a werewolf, his strength increased to an unspecified level.  He easily overpowered [[Sabretooth]] but was in turn unable to match that of [[Mr. Hyde]].

If Jack bites or scratches a human, he can infect them with lycanthropy, and make them werewolves as well. Upon the integration of his wolf and human souls in Marvel Comic Presents, his ability to infect another became optional and he could choose who would receive the curse. His wolfen powers enable him to quickly heal from most injuries, but he is still vulnerable to weapons made of silver.
