'''Werewolf by Night''' (birth name Jacob Russoff, legal name Jack Russell) is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  The Werewolf by Night (usually referred to by other characters simply as the '''Werewolf''') is an [[anti-hero]]ic [[werewolf]]. He first appeared in ''[[Marvel Spotlight]]'' volume 1 #2.

==Character history==
Jack Russell was born Jacob Russoff in [[Romania]] to Gregor and Laura Russoff. Gregor was himself a [[werewolf]] who had inherited the family curse of [[lycanthropy]]. This curse had originated with their 18th century ancestor Grigori, who had been tainted by the [[Darkhold]], a [[grimoire]] of [[black magic]], and was subsequently bitten by a werewolf who served [[Tomb of Dracula|Dracula]]. Gregor himself was killed by an angry mob while Jacob was less than two years old. Soon after, Laura took Jacob and his sister, Lissa, to the [[United States]], where Laura married Jacob's brother Philip. The family adopted the last name of Russell, and Jacob's first name was changed to Jack.

Unfortunately for Jack, he would go on to inherit his father's curse on his eighteenth birthday. Under the light of a full moon, Jack would transform into the Werewolf: a ferocious monster who would prowl the area searching for victims. He would hunt down and maim or kill evildoers as he encountered them, although he would often attack others when threatened or panicked. A number of these victims returned as werewolves themselves, only to be killed by Jack when he learned of his creations' bloodlust. Most of Jack's adventures revolved around him searching for a way to control or cure his [[lycanthropy]]. He eventually came to grips with his nature and is currently able to exercise a large degree of control over his actions while in werewolf form, to the point that he can usually think and act normally while transformed.

Throughout the years, the Werewolf would encounter a variety of [[superhero]] and [[supernatural]] opponents and allies, including [[Moon Knight]], [[Spider-Man]], [[Ghost Rider]], [[Tomb of Dracula|Dracula]], [[Frankenstein's monster]], the [[West Coast Avengers]], and the [[Midnight Sons]]. During the encounter with the Midnight Sons, the vampire hunter [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] was [[spiritual possession|possessed]] by the Darkhold and killed the Werewolf; when the spell was reversed, both Blade and Jack were returned to normal. More recently, Jack's sister Lissa's daughter was introduced as the [[Vampire by Night]], whose hereditary curse had been modified by the bite of a [[vampire]].
