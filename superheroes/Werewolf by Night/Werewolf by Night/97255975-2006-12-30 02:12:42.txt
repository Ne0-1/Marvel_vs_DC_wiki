'''Werewolf by Night''' (birth name '''Jacob Russoff''', legal name '''Jack Russell''') is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  The Werewolf by Night (usually referred to by other characters simply as the '''Werewolf''') is an [[anti-hero]]ic [[werewolf]]. He first appeared in ''[[Marvel Spotlight]]'' volume 1 #2.

==Character history==
Jack Russell was born Jacob Russoff in [[Romania]] to Gregor and Laura Russoff. Gregor was himself a [[werewolf]] who had inherited the family curse of [[lycanthropy]]. This curse had originated with their 18th century ancestor Grigori, who had been tainted by the [[Darkhold]], a [[grimoire]] of [[black magic]], and was subsequently bitten by a werewolf who served [[Tomb of Dracula|Dracula]]. Gregor himself was killed by an angry mob while Jacob was less than two years old. Soon after, Laura took Jacob and his sister, Lissa, to the [[United States]], where Laura married Jacob's brother Philip. The family adopted the last name of Russell, and Jacob's first name was changed to Jack.

Unfortunately for Jack, he would go on to inherit his father's curse on his eighteenth birthday. Under the light of a full moon, Jack would transform into the Werewolf: a ferocious monster who would prowl the area searching for victims. He would hunt down and maim or kill evildoers as he encountered them, although he would often attack others when threatened or panicked. A number of these victims returned as werewolves themselves, only to be killed by Jack when he learned of his creations' bloodlust. Most of Jack's adventures revolved around him searching for a way to control or cure his [[lycanthropy]]. During this time he formed an on-again off-again relationship with the empathic sorceress [[Topaz (Marvel Comics)|Topaz]]. He eventually came to grips with his nature and is currently able to exercise a large degree of control over his actions while in werewolf form, to the point that he can usually think and act normally while transformed.

There was a point in Jack's life where his werewolf form became advanced by a scientist named Dr. Karl Malus whose treatment caused Jack to more closely resemble an actual wolf by having the head of a wolf and a small tail.

Throughout the years, the Werewolf would encounter a variety of [[superhero]] and [[supernatural]] opponents and allies, including [[Moon Knight]], [[Spider-Man]], [[Ghost Rider]], [[Spider-Woman]], [[Tomb of Dracula|Dracula]], [[Frankenstein (Marvel Comics)|Frankenstein's monster]], the [[West Coast Avengers]], and the [[Midnight Sons]]. During the encounter with the Midnight Sons, the vampire hunter [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] was [[spiritual possession|possessed]] by the Darkhold and killed the Werewolf; when the spell was reversed, both Blade and Jack were returned to normal. More recently, Jack's niece was introduced as the [[Vampire by Night]], whose hereditary curse had been modified by the bite of a [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampire]].

The Werewolf by Night remained active within the Marvel Comics universe as recently as 2006.

The most notable issue of Werewolf by Night was #32 which featured the first appearance of Moon Knight

==Powers==
Jack possesses the power of lycanthropy, the power to become a werewolf. In his wolfen form, he still resembles a human, albeit with fur and [[Canidae|canine]] features. As a werewolf, Jack is superhumanly stong and fast, with animal-like senses of smell and hearing. His claws and fangs can rip most enemies to shreds, even other werewolves. Unlike most werewolves, Jack can become a werewolf whenever it is dark, and doesn't need the full moon to change. If Jack bites or scratches a human, he can infect them with lycanthropy, and make them werewolves as well. Note:upon integration of his wolf and human souls in Marvel Comic Presents, his ability to infect another became optional and he could choose who would receive the curse. His wolfen powers enable him to quickly heal from most injuries, but he is still vulnerable to weapons made of silver (such as stakes and bullets).

==Alternate versions==
In '''Earth-Supernatural''', a version of '''Werewolf''' appeared in ''Supernatural Tourbook'' and ''Supernaturals'' #1-4

==Notes==
There have been a few other characters known as '''Werewolf'''.  These include:
*A [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] who developed the [[bloodlust]] when he was exposed to a drop of water in ''Uncanny Tales'' vol. 1 #23 was known as Werewolf.  
*In ''Marvel Tales'' vol. 1 #108, there is a [[werewolf]] who was married to a [[vampire]].
*There are rings known as the '''Werewolf rings''' that were obtained along with other magic items by [[Joshua Kane]] that were allegedly from [[Aelfric]].  After Kaneâ€™s death, his executor [[Geraldo Kabal]] gave one of the rings to [[Lou Hacket]]t who used it to become an intelligent werewolf; it was apparently destroyed along with him. The second ring was taken from Kabal by '''Jack Russell''', and it allowed him to retain his intellect (but not speak) until he lost it in Baron Thunder's building.  The rings appeared in ''Werewolf by Night'' vol. 1 #20-21.

==Trivia==
The character's name may be a reference to the [[Jack Russell Terrier]] breed of dog.
