'''Nightmask''' (real name '''Keith Remsen''') is a [[fictional]] [[Marvel Comics]] character, one of the heroes of Marvel's [[New Universe]] imprint. Created by [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]] and [[Tony Salmons]], he first appeared in ''Nightmask'' #1 (November 1986). Remsen is a paranormal, one of the people affected by the "[[White Event]]", and has the ability to manifest himself in other people's dreams.  

==Publication history==
The Nightmask series was cancelled after 12 issues, although Remsen continued to feature as a significant New Universe character, with a supporting role (and occasional back-up stories) in other titles. 

Oddly, the '[[Gnome (comics)|Gnome]]' storyline was abruptly abandoned (and subsequently ignored) midway through the Nightmask comic's run - this plot was only resolved when ''Untold Tales of the New Universe: Nightmask'' was published in 2006.

==Fictional character biography==
{{spoilers}}
===Main Series===
Keith Remsen was an eighteen-year-old whose parents sent him to study with [[Gnome (comics)|Doctor Horst Kleinmann]], an expert on dreams.  Kleinmann had perfected a way of entering dreams cybernetically, and was worried that Remsen's parents were trying to steal his research.  Kleinmann planted a bomb which killed Remsen's parents, paralyzed his little sister Theodora ("Teddy"), and left Keith himself in a coma, where he remained until he was awakened by the [[White Event]].  

When he awoke, he gradually discovered that he had the power to enter people's dreams telepathically, which he used to assist in psychotherapy.  His sister Teddy was able to communicate with him while he was in the dream state and served as his anchor to reality.  He also fought Kleinmann in the dreamscape, although the conclusion to that fight was never published owing to editorial difficulties and the cancellation of the series.

===The Draft and The War===
After the [[Black Event]], in which the city of Pittsburgh was destroyed, Remsen was one of the first paranormally gifted people [[The Draft (comics)|drafted]] into the military.  His training and abilities earned him a commission and he was assigned to use his abilities to scan paranormal draftees for signs of mental aberration.  Unfortunately, without his sister to act as his anchor, his dream self became more and more unhinged until he felt he could no longer tell the sane from the insane.  This led him to approve a candidate with a dangerously unstable personality and an equally unstable power-- the ability to teleport, leaving behind an explosion whose power is directly proportional to the distance travelled.  When this recruit finally reached his breaking point, he attempted to assassinate the President of the United States (thwarted only because the unnamed President had developed paranormal regenerative abilities himself).  

Remsen stalked the recruit in his dreams until the recruit sought him out personally, intending to kill Remsen and anyone around him.  However, Remsen was carrying a sidearm and he fatally shot the recruit.

===Untold Tales of the New Universe===
In 2006, a single issue story of Nightmask was published, providing the conclusion to the Kleinmann storyline.

==Other versions of Nightmask==
===Exiles===
An alternate version of Keith Remsen attempts to defeat the mutant [[Proteus (comics)|Proteus]] within his dreams. The attempt fails and Proteus strikes back - Remsen appears to suffer a heart attack, it is unclear whether or not he survived.

{{future comic}}
Marvel has announced that Writer [[Warren Ellis]] and Illustrator [[Salvador Larocca]], in honor of '''The 20th Anniversary of The New Universe''', are working on a single-title re-imagining of the New Universe saga named [[newuniversal]]. Ellis has "named Nightmask as one of the more interesting concepts of the previous New Universe incarnation"[http://www.newsarama.com/marvelnew/NextWave/pressconference.htm]. 

The new version of Nightmask will not be Keith Remsen, however - instead it will be an entirely different character, Izanami Randall, "a Japanese-American girl in San Francisco"[http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=7950].

== Trivia ==

When [[Malibu Comics]] revived a number of [[public domain]] [[Centaur Comics]] characters, a superhero known as [[Masked Marvel]] was among them. Fearing that [[Marvel Comics]] might sue if they retain this codename, they changed the codename to Night Mask.
