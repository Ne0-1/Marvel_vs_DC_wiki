'''Lady Death Strike''' (real name Yuriko Oyama) is a [[fictional character]], a [[comic book]] [[supervillain]]ess in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe and a foe of the [[X-Men]].  Lady Deathstrike's father may have been the scientist responsible for discovering the process of bonding adamantium to a human skeleton. As [[Wolverine]] has an adamantium skeleton, Yuriko has been misled to believe that he is somehow partly responsible for the theft of this innovation from her father and seeks retribution.  

Yuriko is set apart from the majority of the X-Men's foes in that she adheres to a code of honor. Lady Deathstrike was a member of the team of criminal cyborgs called the Reavers, led by Donald Pierce, who once managed to successfully defeat the X-Men.  The Reavers have since been annihilated by the Sentinals, and Yuriko has been operating independantly.
