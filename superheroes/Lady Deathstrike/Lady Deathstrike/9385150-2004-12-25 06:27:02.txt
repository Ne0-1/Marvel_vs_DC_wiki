'''Lady Deathstrike''' (real name '''Yuriko Oyama''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[comic book]] [[supervillain]]ess in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe and an occasional foe of the [[X-Men]].  Lady Deathstrike's father was the scientist responsible for discovering the process of bonding [[adamantium]] to a [[human]] [[skeleton]]; the process was stolen from him by scientists working on [[Weapon X]], the project that created [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]. Upon learning of Wolverine's adamantium skeleton, Deathstrike sought to kill him to right the wrong of the theft and thus restore her family's honor. The [[Daredevil]] villain, [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] was also at one point pursued by Lady Deathstrike for his admantium skeleton.

Lady Deathstrike is a [[cyborg]] with [[superhuman]] strength, speed and agility. As she still has some biological parts that do not seem to be affected by the adamantium bonding process which would be lethal to any ordinary human, it has been speculated that she may be [[mutant]] with similar powers to Wolverine; she has demonstrated the ability to regenerate her organic tissue in the past, though whether this is an attribute of her cybernetics or not is unknown. Although her normal form is obviously that of a cyborg, she is capable of hiding this fact (through [[shapeshifting]] and mundane disguises) when necessary. She is an expertly trained [[assassin]] and warrior, and while she prefers stealth and subtlety in her killings, she often lets her hatred of Wolverine overcome her better judgment.

Yuriko is set apart from the majority of the X-Men's foes in that she adheres to a code of honor. Lady Deathstrike was a member of the team of criminal cyborgs called the [[Reavers]], led by [[Donald Pierce]], who once managed to successfully defeat the X-Men.  The Reavers have since been annihilated by the [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]], and Yuriko has been operating independently.  Although she briefly resigned her quest to kill Logan and even assisted the X-Men on a few occasions, she still remains a murderer and assassin.

==Movies & Television==

Lady Deathstrike was portrayed by the actress [[Kelly Hu]] in the ''[[X-Men 2]]'' motion picture released in [[2003 in film|2003]].  In her film incarnation, she is not portrayed as a cyborg, but as a mutant with abilities similar to those of Wolverine.  Though, as in the comic books, she is portrayed as a villian in the film, her actual orientation is unclear as she is under the effects of mind control throughout the story.
