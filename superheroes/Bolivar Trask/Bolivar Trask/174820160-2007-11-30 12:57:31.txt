'''Bolivar Trask''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #14 (November, 1965). He is the creator of the [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]].

==Fictional character biography==
Bolivar Trask was an anthropologist who saw the rise of [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutants]] as a threat to humanity. Bolivar was also the father of [[Larry Trask (comics)|Larry Trask]], who ironically is revealed to be a mutant [[precognition|precognitive]]. Bolivar had realized this, and given his son a medallion which suppresses his power. Bolivar's other child, Tanya, was also a mutant and her ability to travel through time causes her to vanish. Tanya would be rescued by [[Rachel Summers]] in a far future and become a part of the [[Askani]] under the alias [[Madame Sanctity]]. Tanya's travels through time would result in property damage to Trask's land. This mysterious situation would only further cement his attitudes. 

Bolivar decides that humanity has to fight back against the mutants and develops robotic guardians for humanity, known as the Sentinels. His son Larry was protected from the Sentinels' ability to detect mutants due to the medallion Bolivar had given him. Bolivar publishes articles on the threat of mutants. One of these articles showed an illustration of mutant overlords keeping humans as slaves. This illustration would become a symbol for human/mutant relations and several years later [[Quentin Quire]] and his Omega Gang would base their appearance on this picture. 

Professor [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] invites Trask for a public debate on human/mutant relations. Xavier's arguments that mutants were just like humans and not evil didn't convince Trask and he reveals the Sentinels. Trask and his scientists had apparently created an adaptive, open-ended tactical/strategic programming. Trask wasn't a very skilled programmer though and the Sentinels turn against him, claiming that they were superior to humans. The Sentinels left with Trask and brought him to his first creation, the [[Master Mold]], who orders him to construct more Sentinels. 

To stop the Sentinels, Xavier summons his [[X-Men]]. The X-Men fight the Sentinels, but [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] is captured. To reveal the X-Men's secrets, the Sentinels tell Trask to use a device to read Beast's mind. Trask discovers that the X-Men were mutants protecting humanity and realises that he had been wrong. He helps the X-Men defeat the Sentinels by sacrificing himself to destroy the Sentinel's base. 

Bolivar's death wouldn't be the end of the Sentinels though; Master Mold would return and Bolivar's son, Larry, still unaware of his own mutant status, would follow in his father's footsteps and create new Sentinels to avenge his father.

Later, a relative of Bolivar, Donald Trask, would be recruited by the villain [[Cassandra Nova]] to gain control of a group of Sentinels in Ecuador. The machines, now varying in size, will not harm Trask DNA. They obey Donald's orders. However, once Nova is done copying all of Donald's DNA, she kills him and takes over the robots.

==Other versions==

===Age of Apocalypse===
In the ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'', Bolivar Trask married [[Moira MacTaggert|Moira Kinross]] and together they designed heavily-armed Sentinels to fight Apocalypse. These Sentinels were better programmed and even capable of reasoning with mutants if they protected humans (their primary objective). Bolivar participates in a plan to bomb North American Apocalypse forces, though this would mean extensive civilian deaths.

===Ultimate Bolivar Trask===
Bolivar Trask first debuted in [[Ultimate X-Men#Mark Millar (February 2001 - July 2003)|''Ultimate X-Men'']], as the architect for the US Government 'Sentinel Initiative', a response to [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]'s terrorist attacks on Capitol Hill. Initially, the Sentinels patrolled [[Los Angeles]], and then [[New York City]], destroying any human containing mutant genes. However, these attacks ceased after the X-Men rescued the President's daughter from the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]]. Trask discovered the location of the [[Savage Land]], and by the order from the President of the United States, he dispatched his Sentinels to destroy Magneto's paradise. This proved to be a foolish move when Magneto easily reprogrammed the chromium-built machines to destroy humankind. After a subsequent Sentinel attack on [[Washington, D.C.]], the Sentinel Initiative was shut down. 

Trask is also mentioned in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' as the employer of [[Richard and Mary Parker|Richard Parker]] and Edward Brock Sr. (the fathers of Peter Parker/[[Spider-Man]] and [[Venom (Eddie Brock)|Eddie Brock]]/[[Venom (comics)|Venom]]) that stole their cancer cure project (The [[Venom (Eddie Brock)#Ultimate Venom|Venom]] suit) because he was more interested in military applications. He is the main antagonist in the Ultimate Spider-Man video game which continues the story introduced in the comics (see below). He has recently appeared in the [[Ultimate X-Men#Robert Kirkman (March 2006 - )|Sentinels story arc]] of ''Ultimate X-Men'', revealed as being employed by the Fenris twins to build the new Sentinels currently attacking mutants. This would suggest that the government no longer employs him, perhaps due to the failure of the Sentinel Initiative.

==In other media==
===Television===
*In the 1990s [[X-Men animated series|animated series]], Trask is also the creator of the Sentinels, and was much longer-lived than his comic counterpart, returning for several episodes (one of which ironically featured him on the run from his own creations, along with [[Henry Peter Gyrich|Gyrich]]).  Trask was introduced here in the second episode of this series.

*In the [[animated television series]], ''[[X-Men Evolution]],'' Colonel Bolivar Trask is a former member of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], a noted [[anthropologist]] and cyberneticist studying the process of [[genetic mutation]].  Trask concluded the mutants would one day replace [[human]]s as the dominant [[species]] on [[Earth]] if left unchecked.  He decided to prevent this by designing an army of [[robot]]ic guardians who would [[police]] mutant kind &mdash; the Sentinels.  Trask kidnapped Wolverine while he's chasing down Sabretooth to get to Magneto at the second season finale of the series, and uses him as a test subject for his Sentinel prototype.  The Sentinel was able to defeat Wolverine.  After his Sentinel prototype was destroyed and the [[X-Men]]'s names were cleared, Trask was [[arrest]]ed and placed in prison. However, he was released early to continue his work on the sentinel projects, working under [[Nick Fury]], so that the world would be ready for the eventual threat of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]].  In the series, his main weapon is a gun that cannot allow mutants to move while stuck in a sticky green substance.

*[[Bill Duke]] portrays Trask in ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]''. Here, he is the head of the [[Department of Homeland Security]], and has no (presumed) connection to the Sentinels. However, he does appear connected with the ongoing adaptation of human weapons and tactics to mutant threats. It is also notable that in the comics, Trask is of a [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] ethnic background while the actor who portrays him in ''X-Men'' ([[Bill Duke]]) is [[African American]].

===Video games===
*Trask appeared in the video game ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' (played by [[John Billingsley]]), as [[CEO]] of Trask Enterprises. He, along with [[Adrian Toomes]], attemptes to re-create the [[Venom (comics)|Venom]] suit and hires [[Silver Sable]] to capture [[Venom (Eddie Brock)#Ultimate Venom|Eddie Brock]]. 
*In ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]'', Trask was mentioned in stage 4, concerning his Sentinels and how they have been changed. 
*In ''[[X-Men: The Official Game]]'' Trask is briefly mentioned as taking over supervision of the criminal [[Multiple Man]].
