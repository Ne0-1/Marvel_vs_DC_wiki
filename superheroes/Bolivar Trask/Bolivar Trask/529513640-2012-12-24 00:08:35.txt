'''Bolivar Trask''' is a fictional character and a military scientist in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #14 (November 1965). He is the creator of the [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]].

==Fictional character biography==
Bolivar Trask was an anthropologist who saw the rise of [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] as a threat to humanity. Bolivar was also the father of [[Larry Trask (comics)|Larry Trask]], who ironically is revealed to be a mutant [[precognition|precognitive]]. Bolivar had realized this, and gave his son a medallion which suppresses his power.{{issue|date=December 2012}} Bolivar's other child, Tanya, was also a mutant and her ability to travel through time causes her to vanish. Tanya would be rescued by [[Rachel Summers]] in a far future and become a part of the [[Askani]] under the alias [[Madame Sanctity]].{{issue|date=December 2012}} Tanya's travels through time would result in property damage to Trask's land. This mysterious situation would only further cement his attitudes.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Bolivar decides that humanity has to fight back against the mutants and develops robotic guardians for humanity, known as the Sentinels. His son Larry was protected from the Sentinels' ability to detect mutants due to the medallion Bolivar had given him. Bolivar publishes articles on the threat of mutants. One of these articles showed an illustration of mutant overlords keeping humans as slaves. This illustration would become a symbol for human/mutant relations and several years later [[Quentin Quire]] and his [[Omega Gang]] would base their appearance on this picture.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Professor [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] invites Trask for a public debate on human/mutant relations. Xavier's arguments that mutants were just like humans and not evil did not convince Trask and he reveals the Sentinels. But Trask and his scientists had apparently created a too adaptive, open-ended tactical/strategic programming, and as a result the Sentinels turn against him, claiming that they were superior to humans. The Sentinels left with Trask and brought him to his first creation, the [[Master Mold]], who orders him to construct more Sentinels.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

To stop the Sentinels, Xavier summons his [[X-Men]]. The X-Men fight the Sentinels, but [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] is captured. To reveal the X-Men's secrets, the Sentinels tell Trask to use a device to read Beast's mind. Trask discovers that the X-Men were mutants protecting humanity and realizes that he had been wrong. He helps the X-Men defeat the Sentinels by sacrificing himself to destroy the Sentinel's base.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Recently in [[X-Force]], [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]] (who has been reactivated by the [[Purifiers]]) has apparently resurrected Bolivar Trask through use of a Technarch to be part of a team of the world's foremost mutant killers. He was apparently given credit for the deaths of all Sentinels, being the inventor of the first ones, had the highest record of mutant kills: 16,521,618.<ref>''X-Force'' (3rd series) #03 (2008)</ref> Consistent with the remorse he had displayed at the time of his death, he killed himself after escaping Bastion's mental control.<ref>''X-Factor '' #206</ref>

===Bolivar Trask's Legacy===
Bolivar's death would not be the end of the Sentinels though:

* Master Mold would return and Bolivar's son, '''Larry''', still unaware of his own mutant status (who had prophetic dreams), would follow in his father's footsteps and create new Sentinels to avenge his father.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' 57-59</ref>

* Later, a relative of Bolivar named '''Donald Trask, III''' would be recruited by the villain [[Cassandra Nova]] to gain control of a group of Sentinels in Ecuador. The machines, now varying in size, will not harm Trask DNA. They obey Donald's orders. However, once Nova is done copying all of Donald's DNA, she kills him and takes over the robots.<ref>''New X-Men'' #114-115</ref>

* Bolivar Trask also has a brother named '''Simon Trask''' who is the founder of [[Humanity's Last Stand]].<ref>Uncanny X-Men Annual 1995</ref> In the [[Iron Man: Armored Adventures]] episode "The X-Factor," Simon Trask was attacked by Magneto for being a member of Humanity Now (which might be based on Humanity's Last Stand). Simon Trask is eventually found wrapped in a pipe by [[Iron Man]] before Magneto attacks.

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the 1995 crossover, ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'', Bolivar Trask married [[Moira MacTaggert|Moira Kinross]] and together they designed heavily-armed Sentinels to fight Apocalypse. These Sentinels were better programmed and even capable of reasoning with mutants if they protected humans (their primary objective). Bolivar participates in a plan to bomb North American Apocalypse forces, though this would mean extensive civilian deaths.

He returns in the 2012 launched Age of Apocalypse ongoing, as one of the leaders of the remaining human resistance.  His daughter, Francesca, is a main operative in the [[X-Terminators]] (code-named "Fiend") alongside [[William Stryker|Prophet]], [[Donald Pierce|Good Night]], [[Graydon Creed|Horror Show]], and Zora Risman aka DeadEye though she and Bolivar have a rocky relationship.<ref>Age of Apocalypse #1</ref>

===Civil War: House of M===
Bolivar Trask is sworn in as the Vice-President of the U.S.A. and creates Sentinels to fight against Magneto in his rise to power.<ref>''Civil War: House of M'' #3</ref> He is vaporized by his own Sentinels when Magneto throws him in the path of their weapons.<ref>''Civil War: House of M'' #5</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
Bolivar Trask first debuted in [[Ultimate X-Men#Mark Millar (February 2001 - July 2003)|''Ultimate X-Men'']], as the architect for the US Government 'Sentinel Initiative', a response to [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]'s terrorist attacks on Capitol Hill. Initially, the Sentinels patrolled [[Los Angeles]], and then [[New York City]], destroying any human containing mutant genes. However, these attacks ceased after the X-Men rescued the President's daughter from the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]]. Trask discovered the location of the [[Savage Land]], and by the order from the [[President of the United States]], he dispatched his Sentinels to destroy Magneto's paradise. This proved to be a foolish move when Magneto easily reprogrammed the chromium-built machines to destroy humankind. After a subsequent Sentinel attack on [[Washington, D.C.]], the Sentinel Initiative was shut down. 

Trask is also mentioned in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' as the employer of [[Richard and Mary Parker|Richard Parker]] and Edward Brock Sr. (the fathers of Peter Parker/[[Spider-Man]] and [[Eddie Brock]]/[[Venom (comics)|Venom]]) that stole their cancer cure project (The [[Venom (comics)|Venom]] suit) because he was more interested in military applications. The implication, and Peter's theory, being that Trask deliberately crashed the plane carrying Peter's parents just to gain full control of the suit. He is the main antagonist in the [[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man video game]] which continues the story introduced in the comics (see below). He has recently appeared in the [[Ultimate X-Men#Robert Kirkman (March 2006 - )|Sentinels story arc]] of ''Ultimate X-Men'', revealed as being employed by the Fenris twins to build the new Sentinels currently attacking mutants. This would suggest that the government no longer employs him, perhaps due to the failure of the Sentinel Initiative. Feeling horrified by all that he has done, he allows himself to drop into the heart of an explosion and is killed.

Bolivar Trask later appears in a flashback in "Ultimate Spider-Man" #125 where he talks to a captive Eddie Brock about the symbiote in which he makes a deal with him in removing the symbiote with help from [[Vulture (comics)|Dr. Adrian Toomes]]. However, during an experimental examination of Brock (as Venom) the [[Beetle (comics)|Beetle]] abruptly broke into Trask's facility allowing Venom to escape.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #128 (January 2009)</ref>

===X-Men Noir===
Bolivar Trask is a multitalented doctor of anthropology, and sociology, who is also a [[Pulp magazine|pulp]] sci-fi writer, and a public proponent of [[eugenics]], though not a racist, as his leading characters possess the "finest" qualities of different ethnic groups. He is the writer of the pulp sci-fi series, "The Sentinels", about a race of genetically superior beings in the year 2013 who protect humanity from the grisly deformed "Mutants". His characters include [[Steven Lang (comics)|Stephen Lang]], creator of [[Sentinels (comics)|the Sentinels]]; [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]], leader of inadequates/muties; sentinel commander [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]], perfect sentinels [[Nimrod (comics)|Nimrod]] and [[Rachel Summers|Rachel]] as well as the mad Egyptian [[Apocalypse (comics)|En Sabah Nur]].

==In other media==
===Television===
* In the 1990s [[X-Men animated series|animated series]], Bolivar Trask (voiced by [[Brett Halsey]]) is the creator of the Sentinels and was much longer-lived than his comic counterpart, returning for several episodes (one of which ironically featured him on the run from his own creations, along with [[Henry Peter Gyrich|Gyrich]]). Trask was introduced here in the second episode of this series. He was later seen sacrificing himself to destroy [[Master Mold]].
* In the [[animated television series]], ''[[X-Men Evolution]],'' Colonel Bolivar Trask (voiced by [[John Novak]]) is a former member of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], a noted [[anthropologist]] and cyberneticist studying the process of [[genetic mutation]]. Trask concluded the mutants would one day replace [[human]]s as the dominant [[species]] on [[Earth]] if left unchecked. He decided to prevent this by designing an army of [[robot]]ic guardians who would [[police]] mutant kind &mdash; the Sentinels. Trask kidnapped Wolverine while he's chasing down Sabretooth to get to Magneto at the second season finale of the series, and uses him as a test subject for his Sentinel prototype. The Sentinel was able to defeat Wolverine. After his Sentinel prototype was destroyed and the [[X-Men]]'s names were cleared, Trask was [[arrest]]ed and placed in prison. However, he was released early to continue his work on the sentinel projects working under [[Nick Fury]] so that the world would be ready for the eventual threat of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]].
* Bolivar Trask first appears in the ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'' episode "Thieves Gambit" voiced by [[Phil LaMarr]]. In the show, he is a scientist working for Senator Robert Kelly alongside Dr. Sybil Zane on creating the Sentinel Program. Though the building it was being developed in was destroyed in the fight with Wolverine and Gambit, Bolivar and Dr. Zane escaped. In "Badlands," he ran a laboratory that Wolverine, Shadowcat, and Forge infiltrated. When Wolverine ended up captured, Bolivar figured out about his adamantium skeleton resulting in the Wolverine-type Sentinels that Professor X's X-Men encountered 20 years into the future. In "Backlash," he had managed to create Master Mold to create the Sentinels. He was with Senator Kelly, Warren Worthington II, and Dr. Sybil Zane when they watch the Sentinels fight the X-Men and the Brotherhood of Mutants. In "Foresight," he ends up launching the Sentinels to Genosha under orders of Senator Kelly (who was really Mystique in disguise) and later gets knocked out by him.

===Film===
* [[Bill Duke]] portrays Trask in ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]''. Here, he is the head of the [[Department of Homeland Security]]. While a holographic Sentinel does appear in the film as part of a [[Danger Room]] session, Trask has no (presumed) connection to the Sentinels. However, he does appear connected with the ongoing adaptation of human weapons and tactics to mutant threats. It is also notable that in the comics, Trask is of a [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] ethnic background while the actor who portrays him in X-Men: The Last Stand (Bill Duke) is [[African American]]. Also notable is that the film's version of Trask seems to have no real hatred of mutants and is merely doing his job, as opposed to his comic-book incarnation that took great pleasure in making deadlier weapons to use against mutants.

===Video games===
* Bolivar Trask appeared in the video game ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' voiced by [[John Billingsley]]. He appears as the [[CEO]] of Trask Enterprises. He alongside [[Vulture (comics)|Adrian Toomes]] attempt to re-create the [[Venom (comics)|Venom]] suit. To do that, Bolivar Trask hires [[Silver Sable]] and her [[Wild Pack]] to capture [[Eddie Brock|Eddie Brock Jr.]] and later Peter Parker. After Peter Parker is freed from the Carnage symbiote, Venom goes after Bolivar Trask. Upon Spider-Man confronting Bolivar about info on his father (and obtaining the files about him), Venom attacks with Bolivar making his way to a helicopter...which he does not know how to operate as stated by Silver Sable. Spider-Man had to fight Venom to keep him from getting to Bolivar Trask. Bolivar Trask is later arrested by the arriving S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents and later confronted in an offshore prison by Eddie Brock. As Venom, Eddie finally murders Bolivar Trask offscreen for what he made Venom do.
* In ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]'', Trask was mentioned in stage 4, concerning his Sentinels and how they have been changed.
* In ''[[X-Men: The Official Game]]'', Trask is briefly mentioned as taking over supervision of the criminal [[Multiple Man]]. He is also mentioned by [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] that he helped [[William Stryker]] create The Sentinels and the Master-Mold with backing from [[HYDRA]].
* Bolivar Trask appears in the video game adaption of ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine (video game)|X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]'' voiced by [[Bumper Robinson]] and modeled after his appearance in the third film. He is shown researching the mutant gene and also helping to build Sentinels. In the game's continuity, worklogs accessed by the player as they search his base reveal that Trask initially did not have anything against mutants and simply took part in the Sentinel project for the scientific value. However, after witnessing a violent incident which involved a mutant test subject, he came to see mutants as a menace, believing that humanity could only be protected if mutants were eliminated, describing them as freaks of nature. He is seen in the future epilogue of the game in which the Sentinels rule the Earth (a la [[Days of Future Past]]). Notably in the game, he loses his left hand to [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] (similar to the losing of [[Weapon X]]'s [[Professor Thorton]]'s right hand), Wolverine requiring Trask's handprint to get through a door in the facility that he is searching, only to have it replaced with a cybernetic hand in the future.

===Non-fiction===
Bolivar's hatred of mutants is discussed in the non-fiction book, ''From Krakow to Krypton: Jews and comic books''.<ref>{{cite book |title= From Krakow to Krypton: Jews and comic books|last= Kaplan|first= Arie|year= 2008|publisher= Jewish Publication Society|isbn= 978-0-8276-0843-6|page=113 }}</ref>
