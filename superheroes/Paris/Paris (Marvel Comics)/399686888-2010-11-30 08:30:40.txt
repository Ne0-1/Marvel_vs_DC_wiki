==Fictional character biography==
A young '''Nathan Taylor''' aka Paris was saved from the Watts Riots in 1959 by [[Pantheon (Marvel Comics)|Pantheon]] members [[Ulysses (Pantheon)|Ulysses]] I and Walter Charles (Ulysses II). Nathan's parents were killed during a fire. Nathan blamed Walter for their deaths and still held a grudge decades later. Nathan Charles was taken back to the Pantheon headquarters, the Mount.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

Paris often causes trouble for his teammates particularly Ulysses and is something of a trickster. Paris is an empath which is ironic given his seeming insensitivity to the feelings of others. Paris rarely goes out on missions but he has shown a heroic side as when he shielded a little girl who was about to be killed by the villain X-Ray of the [[U-Foes]].<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #397</ref> After the destruction of the Mount, Paris informed the Hulk that they would always be enemies.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

Paris often gives people nicknames they don't like such as when he called the Hulk "Bobby" or [[Henry Peter Gyrich]] "Hank". Most people find him sleazy and untrustworthy yet he remained loyal to the Pantheon in the fight against Pantheon founder [[Agamemnon (Pantheon)|Agamemnon]].<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #424-425</ref>
