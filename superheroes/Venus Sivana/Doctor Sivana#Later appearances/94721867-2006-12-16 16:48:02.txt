'''Doctor Thaddeus Bodog Sivana''' is a [[fictional]] [[comic book]] [[supervillain]]. Created by [[Bill Parker]] and [[C.C. Beck]], he first appeared opposite [[superhero]] [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] in ''[[Whiz Comics]]'' #2 (February [[1940]]) by [[Fawcett Comics]]. Sivana was soon established as Captain Marvel's archenemy and most frequent foe, a role that he continues to hold to this day in his appearances in [[DC Comics]], who eventually acquired the rights to those characters from Fawcett.

==Overview==
===Character history===
Sivana is a short, bald, self-described "[[mad scientist]]" with a penchant for developing unusual technologies, and who often plots to do away with Captain Marvel and his [[Marvel Family]], but is often thwarted in his plans. His trademark phrases are "Curses! Foiled again!" and his mocking laughter "Heh! Heh! Heh!" He also coined the insulting name "Big Red Cheese" to refer to Captain Marvel, a name which the Captain's friends have adopted to light-heartedly tease him with.

The Golden Age Sivana was a single father with four children: good-natured adult offspring ''Beautia'' and ''Magnificus'', and evil teenagers '''Georgia'' and Thaddeus, Jr. (aka ''Sivana, Jr.'') Sivana, Sivana, Jr., and Georgia constituted the supervillain group ''The Sivana Family'', the evil counterpoint to the Marvel Family. Magnificus and Beautia, however, were not enemies to the Marvels; in fact, Beautia has an unrequited crush on Captain Marvel (who she does not realize is really an adolescent boy, Billy Batson). Recently, his family has been reintroduced into modern continuity (see below for more details).

===Publication history===
Doctor Sivana appeared in well over half of all of the Golden Age Captain Marvel comic stories, after having deduced Captain Marvel's dual identity as boy radio broadcaster Billy Batson early on. Depicted as a brilliant, if evil, scientist, Sivana used all manner of unusual inventions and techniques against the Marvels. Along with the Marvel Family, Sivana entered "publishing limbo" in 1953, following a ruling in the ''[[National Comics Publications v. Fawcett Publications]]'' court case finding that Captain Marvel was an illegal infringement of [[Superman]].

In 1972, National Comics (today [[DC Comics]]) acquired the rights to the Captain Marvel characters, relaunching them in a new title, ''Shazam!'', the following February. The characters' twenty-year absence from publication was explained as the result of Doctor Sivana and the Sivana Family having trapped the Marvels, their friends, and, by accident, themselves in a sphere of "Suspendium", a compound which kept them in [[suspended animation]] from 1953 until 1973.

Sivana continued to appear in ''Shazam!'' related stories through the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' limited series in 1985. He was reintroduced by Roy Thomas and Tom Mandrake in the miniseries ''Shazam! The New Beginning'' in 1987. This Sivana was the same mad scientist that the previous one had been, except that he only had two children (Beautia and Magnificus), and was Billy Batson's step-uncle.

[[Jerry Ordway]] revised the character of Sivana for his 1994 graphic novel ''[[The Power of Shazam!]]'' and the resulting ongoing series, and this revision has been retained in all following DC publications. The modern Sivana, in addition to being a mad scientist, was also a powerful and influential tycoon (''a la'' [[Lex Luthor]] of the ''Superman'' comics). The former [[CEO]] of his own Sivana Industries, Sivana's corrupted dealings and crossing of Captain Marvel led to his own destruction and his intense hatred of the Marvel Family.

After ''The Power of Shazam!'' series ended in 1999, Sivana was rarely seen until ''[[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]'' #13 -15 (August-October [[2004]]), when he became the leader of the supervillain group the [[Fearsome Five]]. He freed surviving members [[Gizmo (comics)]], [[Mammoth]], [[Psimon]] and [[Jinx (comics)|Jinx]] from prison, and used his genius to reconstitute [[Shimmer (comics)|Shimmer]], who had been turned into glass and shattered by Psimon. The evil scientist appears briefly in DC's ''[[Infinite Crisis]]''. Sivana also recently appeared along with [[Lex Luthor]] in the four-issue 2005 [[limited series]] ''Superman/Shazam: First Thunder'' by [[Judd Winick]] and [[Joshua Middleton]], which depicts the first meeting between those two superheroes. 

{{spoilers}}
In the currently running ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', Sivana was abducted to Oolong Island, a tropical paradise run by [[Intergang]] where he and many other DC Universe "mad scientists" are allowed to live a hedonistic lifestyle while creating the inventions of their wildest dreams and pitting them against one another. Beautia, Magnificus, Georgia, and Thaddeus Jr. of the Sivana Family were reintroduced, along with their mother, and Dr Sivana's wife, Venus Sivana, in ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' Week Twenty-Six ([[November 1]], [[2006]]).  While Georgia and Thaddeus Jr. seem to be the same, Beautia, Magnificus and Venus act like spoiled elites, caring more about their appearance than anything else (except for Venus' love of Dr. Sivana).

Concurrently, in the ''Outsiders'' series (the events in which take place [[One Year Later|a year after]] those in ''52''), Sivana has employed [[Monsieur Mallah]] and the [[Brain (comics)|Brain]] in a plan to smuggle [[metahuman]] brainwashed clones as ''smart weapons'', and is currently facing off against the Outsiders.

==Other media==
Doctor Sivana  first appeared outside of comics in live-action, as a villain in ''[[Legends of the Superheroes]]'' (1979), played by [[Howard Morris]]. He later appeared as a regular villain, occasionally with Sivanna Jr. and Georgia, in the 1981 ''Shazam!'' Saturday morning cartoon, aired as one-half of ''[[The Kid Superpower Hour with Shazam!]]'' Sivana does not appear in any other animated form, although he appears as a villain in issue 15 of the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' comic book, when he tried to rebuild [[Mister Atom]].
