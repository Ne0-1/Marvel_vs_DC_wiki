'''Killer Croc''' ('''Waylon Jones''') is a [[fictional character]] in the [[DC universe]], an [[supervillain|enemy]] of [[Batman]]. Created by writer [[Gerry Conway]] and artist [[Gene Colan]], he first appeared in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #523 ([[1983#February|February 1983]]).

==Fictional character biography==
'''Waylon Jones''' is born with a medical condition that caused him to grow progressively more like a [[crocodile]]. In the comics his intelligence level has varied from competent schemer to berserk monster.

In his original appearances, he resembled a powerfully-built man covered entirely in green scales. However, his disease has slowly robbed him of all identifiable human traits.  In his most recent appearances, he has an enlongated snout and tail.

Once he was a cocaine/arms dealer until foiled by [[Nightwing]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]].

In Batman issue 489, Killer Croc attacked a shopping mall where Batman and Robin arrived later. After Killer Croc received several punches, Batman got distracted by an image of [[Bane (comics)|Bane]], Croc grabbed Batman and tried to break his back. Robin kicked Killer Croc right near Bane and Bane broke Killer Croc's arms. He was then put back into Arkham.  However, it should be noted that ''[[Azrael (comics)|Jean-Paul Valley]]'' was standing in for Bruce Wayne as Batman in this issue, as Wayne had been suffering from insomnia at the time.

When Bane helped get everyone out of Arkham in the Knightfall saga, Killer Croc went to get revenge on Bane. While in the sewers, he smelled Bane and went after him but only found Robin. Bane then attacked him but the ledge they were standing on broke and the three fell into the sewers. The fight ended up as a draw. 

In a storyline that ran in ''Batman'' issues 521 and 522, Killer Croc is summoned by a [[paranormal]] force to break out of [[Arkham Asylum]] and make his way to the [[Louisiana]] swamps. Batman follows him there only to find that the mysterious force is actually the [[Swamp Thing]], who offers Croc a place in the swampland where he can finally give in to his animal side and live free from human persecution. 

Killer Croc has appeared in both the ''[[Batman: Hush|Hush]]'' storyline and its chronological follow up, ''[[Broken City]]''.  In the former, he is infected with a [[virus]] that greatly increases the rate of his devolution.

In 2005's ''Detective Comics'' #810, Killer Croc attempts to cure his condition. When the doctor fails, Croc devours her.  

In ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Croc became a member of [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].

===One Year Later===     
In the ''[[One Year Later]]'' storyline, Killer Croc is discovered feeding on the remains of [[Orca (comics)|Orca]]. He next shows up in ''[[Countdown (DC Comics)|Countdown]]'' #50 in Arkham. He breaks free from his shackles and attempts to kill [[Jimmy Olsen]], who uses elastic powers to escape. Killer Croc is then subdued.

He is later seen among the exiled Supervillains in ''[[Salvation Run]]''. After the [[Martian Manhunter]] was defeated, Killer Croc suggests that he eat him. Lex Luthor tells him not to and then tells him to eat something else.

In DC Universe #0, he can seen as the member of [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra's]] Secret Society of Super Villains. In ''[[Final Crisis]]'' #4, Killer Croc is turned into a [[Justifiers|Justifier]].

==Powers and abilities==
The Killer Croc is afflicted with regressive [[atavism]], meaning he has inherited some of the traits of ancestral species of the human race, such as reptiles which can regenerate lost limbs. His skin has hardened to the point where it is invulnerable to most forms of abrasion and even high caliber weapons fired from a distance. He possesses super strength, able to rip a large bank vault door right off its hinges with ease. He has superhuman regenerative powers, able to heal even lost limbs.

Over time the primal reptilian part of his brain gains more control of his [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]]. He possesses superhuman reflexes and speed. Croc also possesses the superior senses and underwater capabilities of his namesake.

==In other media==
===''Batman: The Animated Series''===
Killer Croc appears in several episodes of ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Aron Kincaid]]. Croc is a former [[professional wrestling|pro wrestler]] who turned to crime. In this series, he is given gray skin as opposed to his normal green, teeth filed to points, and his reptilian appearance is toned down somewhat. In the episode "''Vendetta''", he runs afoul of [[Harvey Bullock (comics)|Harvey Bullock]], who arrests him. Croc later escapes from prison and seeks revenge by framing him for the abduction of criminals Spider Conway and Joey "The Snail." In another episode, he escapes from prison and flees through the countryside, taking refuge in a town of naively trusting circus carnies (including a [[phocomelia|"seal boy"]], a [[gigantism|giant]], [[conjoined twins]], and a [[scoliosis|hunchbacked]] ringmaster). Croc plans to betray and kill his hosts for the money they have stored away for supplies, although he begins to have second thoughts about it after they treat him like a family member. In this episode, it is established that Croc is legally [[sanity|sane]], and therefore is to be sent to [[Blackgate Penitentiary]] instead of [[Arkham Asylum]]. In the DC comic ''[[The Batman Adventures]]'', Croc reveals that his mother died when he was born, and that he was raised by his cruel aunt. 

Later in the series, Croc would serve as nothing more than comic relief. In the episode "''[[Almost Got 'Im]]''", a group of villains are discussing how they almost defeated Batman. While everyone else had managed to almost kill Batman with a complex deathtrap or such, Croc proudly proclaimed that he once threw a rock at Batman. After a prolonged awkward stare from the other villains, he added: "It was a big rock..." However, this was later revealed to be Batman impersonating him. Still, in the episode "''[[Trial]]''", when Batman is put on trial by all the prisoners he's put in Arkham, Croc is among the quasi-jury shouting "Hit 'im with a rock!!"

===''The New Batman Adventures''===
Croc also appeared &mdash; revamped, with green skin and muscles &mdash; in an episode of ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'' where he joins forces with the criminal [[Baby Doll (Batman: The Animated Series)|Baby Doll]]. Baby Doll, who also suffers from an unusual though less frightening physical condition, believes she has found a kindred spirit in fellow 'freak'  Killer Croc. They go to live in the sewers, committing crimes planned by Doll and carried out largely by Croc. 

Baby Doll seems to have a crush on him, until she overhears Croc boasting about manipulating her to a pair of clingy women (implicitly prostitutes), she betrays him to Batman and [[Batgirl]], and in the ensuing fight, he is defeated after being drenched in boiling water. He makes his final appearance in the later episode ''Judgment Day'', where he is seen trying to get Penguin to pay him for jewels he had stolen for him. The Judge (Two-Face in disguise) attacks and defeats him soon afterwards.
He is voiced here by [[Brooks Gardner]].

===''The Batman''===
[[Image:Killer Croc Swamped.jpg|right|thumb|Killer Croc in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]''.]]
In 2005, an episode of the animated television series ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' featured Killer Croc, voiced by [[Ron Perlman]]. In this version Croc is even more reptilian than past versions and has a tail. He appears to be much stronger than Batman and much like a crocodile, he's able to stay underwater for long periods of time. His origins are mostly unknown: one of his henchmen tells Batman that there are different rumors: that he is a military [[gene]]tic experiment gone awry, that he deals with the wrong kind of {{dn|voodoo}} magic in the swamps, he is simply a genetic freak, or that his mother didn`t want him and flushed him down the toilet and all the acid in the sewers mutated him.(it is never explained which, if any, story is true). He recruits three criminals (two of them voiced by [[Jim Cummings]]) as henchmen to help him flood Gotham City. This animated version also speaks with a [[Cajun]] accent and has two pet crocodiles to do his bidding. Batman later deprived him of his air supply enough to be taken down and left for the police to arrest him and his henchman (remarking that "''Crocs may like water but they're no fish''"). He later returns as part of [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]]'s Team Penguin. Killer Croc and his henchmen later appear as one of the captive victims of Rumor after he ambushed Killer Croc and his henchmen in their hideout. Croc makes his final appearance in "''The End of the Batman''" where he, [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]], [[Ventriloquist (comics)|Ventriloquist]] and [[Joker (comics)|The Joker]] team up to commit a crime spree now that they are under the protection of the vigilante [[Wrath (comics)|Wrath]].

===''Batman: Knightfall and Beyond''===
In the novel ''Batman: Knightfall and Beyond'', based largely on the comics storyline, Killer Croc is said to have suffered from "a raging [[skin cancer]]" that turned the outer layers of his flesh into a hardened covering when he was younger. He escapes from Arkham Asylum when Bane and his men destroy it, freeing most of Batman's major foes in the process as part of a plan by Bane to wear him down before Bane himself "breaks" him. Batman later defeats Croc in a one-on-one fight in the sewers, crushing a cylinder of knock-out gas against the underside of his nose to disable him. Croc is then arrested and held in Blackgate Prison with the other Arkham escapees until the asylum can be rebuilt.

===''Batman: Gotham Knight''===
Killer Croc appears as one of the villains in ''[[Batman: Gotham Knight]]'', in the segment ''[[In Darkness Dwells (Batman: Gotham Knight)|In Darkness Dwells]]''.

In this version, Waylon Jones is a [[cannibalism|cannibalistic]] [[serial killer]]. The [[urban legend]] in the segment goes that he was an infant born with [[epidermolytic hyperkeratosis]], a disfiguring skin disorder. His deformity led to his mother abandoning him in the sewers of Gotham City. He files his front teeth into points to compliment the reptilian appearance of his skin and becomes a circus [[sideshow]] performer for a time. Later, Jones - now called Killer Croc - goes on a killing spree that eventually lands him in Arkham Asylum. There, his homicidal impulses intensify during treatment by [[Scarecrow (comics)|Dr. Jonathan Crane]], who infects him with his fear toxin. Croc escapes from Arkham and flees to the sewers along with Crane (now known as The Scarecrow) and a handful of escaped Arkham inmates.  

When Scarecrow orchestrates the [[kidnapping]] of Cardinal O'Fallon, Croc infiltrates the church and carries him down into the sewers. Batman comes to investigate, and Croc attacks him, biting him and infecting him with the fear toxin that is coursing through Croc's own body. After a lengthy battle, Batman fends off Croc by shoving a smoke [[grenade]] into his mouth.

=== Video games ===
A screenshot of Killer Croc from ''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]]'' appeared in the September 2008 issue of ''[[Game Informer]]'', issue 185, on page 71. He is chained up and is extremely large, towering over Batman and the guards that surround him, he also appears at the end of the recently released trailer of the game, he appears chained to the wall in a dark room in the asylum. Killer Croc also appears in ''[[Lego Batman: The Video Game]]'' as an enemy of Batman and follower of [[the Penguin]].<ref>''Game Informer'' features a two-page gallery of the many heroes and villains who appear in the game with a picture for each character and a descriptive paragraph.  See "''LEGO Batman'': Character Gallery," ''Game Informer'' 186 (October 2008): 93.</ref> He joins Penguin's gang in order to hold the city at ransom. His abilities are super strength and immunity to toxic waste. Like all characters who have super strength in the game, he can grab opponents and attack them. He uses wrestling moves when doing this. Ben of ''Gamer Informer'' writes that "this game is filled with cool playable characters...Nightwing, Joker, Killer Croc, Bane, Catwoman, and Man-bat only scratch the surface of the game's catalog of great characters."<ref>Ben, "''LEGO Batman'': Time to build something new," ''Game Informer'' 187 (November 2008): 116.</ref>  Killer Croc is set to appear in the upcoming video game ''[[DC Universe Online]]''.

==Redesign==
In recent years, Killer Croc has been portrayed as being much more reptilian than in past incarnations. An [[action figure]] made by [[Kenner]] toys in 1998 featured a tail and [[dinosaur]]-like feet. When [[Mattel]] got the license to make DC products in the early 2000s, they released their own version of Killer Croc, sculpted by the Four Horsemen. This version also featured a tail and dinosaur feet. In late 2005, a re-release of this figure was modified so that the tail, along with his shirt, was removed. This version also sports a more "human" head. The 2002-2003 ''Batman'' storyline ''Hush'' featured a more bestial Croc who had been [[mutation|mutated]] against his will to appear more reptilian. This version of the character was drawn by artist [[Jim Lee]].
In the graphic novel, [[Joker (graphic novel)|'''Joker''']], written by [[Brian Azzarello]] and artist [[Lee Bermejo]],  Croc is portrayed as a large African American thug with a scaly skin condition. Of all his previous designs, this is the most human. He is missing his abnormally long snout, tail and claws.
His appearance in the upcoming video-game, ''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]]'', portrays him as far larger than he has ever been before.
