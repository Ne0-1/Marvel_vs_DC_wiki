'''Killer Croc''' ('''Waylon Jones''') is a [[fictional character]] in the [[DC universe]], an [[supervillain|enemy]] of [[Batman]]. Created by writer [[Gerry Conway]] and artist [[Don Newton]], he first appeared in ''[[Batman]]'' #357 ([[1983#February|March 1983]]).

==Fictional character biography==
'''Waylon Jones''' is born with a medical condition that caused him to grow progressively more like a [[crocodile]]. In the comics his intelligence level has varied from competent schemer to berserk monster.

Jones is one of the few black supervillains in American comic books. In his original appearances, he resembled a powerfully-built man covered entirely in green scales. However, his disease has slowly robbed him of all identifiable human traits.  In his most recent appearances, he has an enlongated snout and tail.

Once he was a cocaine/arms dealer until foiled by [[Nightwing]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]].

In Batman issue 489, Killer Croc attacked a shopping mall where Batman and Robin arrived later. After Killer Croc received several punches, Batman got distracted by an image of Bane, Killer grabbed Batman and tried to break his back. Robin kicked Killer Croc right near Bane and Bane broke Killer Croc's arms. He was then put back into Arkham.

When Bane helped get everyone out of Arkham in the Knightfall saga, Killer Croc went to get revenge on Bane. While in the sewers, he smelt Bane and went after him but only found Robin. Bane then attacked him but the ledge they were standing on broke and the three fell into the sewers. The fight ended up as a draw. 

In a storyline that ran in ''Batman'' issues 521 and 522, Killer Croc is summoned by a [[paranormal]] force to break out of [[Arkham Asylum]] and make his way to the [[Louisiana]] swamps. Batman follows him there only to find that the mysterious force is actually the [[Swamp Thing]], who offers Croc a place in the swampland where he can finally give in to his animal side and live free from human persecution. 

Killer Croc has appeared in both the ''[[Batman: Hush|Hush]]'' storyline and its chronological follow up, ''[[Broken City]]''.  In the former, he is infected with a [[virus]] that greatly increases the rate of his devolution.

In 2005's ''Detective Comics'' #810, Killer Croc attempts to cure his condition. When the doctor fails, Croc devours her.  

===One Year Later===     
In the ''[[One Year Later]]'' storyline, Killer Croc is discovered feeding on the remains of [[Orca (comics)|Orca]]. He next shows up in ''[[Countdown (DC Comics)|Countdown]]'' #50 in Arkham. He breaks free from his shackles and attempts to kill [[Jimmy Olsen]], who uses elastic powers to escape. Croc is then subdued.

He is later seen among the exiled Supervillains in [[Salvation Run]].

==Powers and abilities==
Killer Croc is afflicted with what seems to be some form of regressive [[atavism]], meaning he has inherited some of the traits of ancestral species of the human race. His skin has hardened to the point where it is invulnerable to most forms of abrasion and even high caliber weapons fired from a distance. He possesses super strength, able to rip a large bank vault door right off its hinges with ease. He has superhuman regenerative powers, able to heal even lost limbs.

Over time the primal reptilian part of his brain gains more control of his [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]]. He possesses superhuman reflexes and speed. Croc also possesses the superior senses and underwater capabilities of his namesake.

==In other media==
Killer Croc appears in several episodes of ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Aron Kincaid]]. Croc is a former [[wrestling|pro wrestler]] who turned to crime. In this series, he is given gray skin as opposed to his normal green, teeth filed to points, and his reptilian appearance is toned down somewhat. In the episode "Vendetta", he runs afoul of [[Harvey Bullock (comics)|Harvey Bullock]], who arrests him. Croc later escapes from prison and seeks revenge by framing him for the abduction of criminals Spider Conway and Joey "The Snail." In another episode, he escapes from prison and flees through the countryside, taking refuge in a town of naively trusting circus carnies (including a [[phocomelia|"seal boy"]], a [[gigantism|giant]], [[conjoined twins]], and a [[scoliosis|hunchbacked]] ringmaster). Croc plans to betray and kill his hosts for the money they have stored away for supplies. In this episode, it is established that Croc is legally [[sanity|sane]], and therefore is to be sent to [[Blackgate Penitentiary]] instead of [[Arkham Asylum]]. In the DC comic ''[[The Batman Adventures]]'', Croc reveals that his mother died when he was born, and that he was raised by his cruel aunt. 

Later in the series, Croc would serve as nothing more than comic relief.  In the episode [[Almost Got 'em]] he defiantly proclaims that he once threw a rock at Batman.  However, this was later revealed to be Batman impersonating him, and a likely reference to their fight in the episode Sideshow.  

He also appeared &mdash; revamped, with green skin &mdash; in an episode of ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'' where he joins forces with the criminal [[Baby Doll (Batman: The Animated Series)|Baby Doll]]. Baby Doll, who has a condition that makes her look like a child even though she is an adult, believes she has found a kindred spirit in fellow 'freak'  Killer Croc. They go to live in the sewers, committing crimes planned by Doll and carried out largely by Croc.  When Baby Doll overhears Croc boasting about manipulating her, she betrays him to Batman and [[Batgirl]]. He is voiced by [[Brooks Gardner]].

In 2005, an episode of the animated television series ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' featured Killer Croc, voiced by [[Ron Perlman]]. In this episode Croc is even more reptilian and has a tail.  His origins are mostly unknown: one of his henchmen tells Batman that there are different rumors: that he is a military [[gene]]tic experiment gone awry, that he deals with the wrong kind of [[voodoo]] magic in the swamps, or is simply a genetic freak. (It is never explained which origin story is true.)  He recruits three criminals, two of them voiced by [[Jim Cummings]], as henchmen to help him flood Gotham City. This animated version also speaks with a [[Cajun]] accent and has two pet crocodiles to do his bidding. He later returns as part of [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]]'s Team Penguin.

Killer Croc is featured in the [[Lego Batman]] building toy set 7780 ''Batboat: the Hunt for Killer Croc''. Croc rides a jet ski, pitted against Batman in a hovercraft version of the [[Batboat]]. Killer Croc appears in [[minifigure]] form with his signature jeans as in the comic, with a distinct reptilian appearance comprising green skin, scales and a sharp-toothed grin. His head, however, is humanoid.

In the novel ''Batman: Knightfall and Beyond'', based largely on the comics storyline, Killer Croc is said to have suffered from "a raging [[skin cancer]]" that turned the outer layers of his flesh into a hardened covering when he was younger. He escapes from Arkham Asylum when Bane and his men destroy it, freeing most of Batman's major foes in the process as part of a plan by Bane to wear him down before Bane himself "breaks" him. Batman later defeats Croc in a one-on-one fight in the sewers, crushing a cylinder of knock-out gas against the underside of his nose to disable him. Croc is then arrested and held in Blackgate Prison with the other Arkham escapees until the asylum can be rebuilt.

==Redesign==
In recent years, Killer Croc has been portrayed as being much more reptilian than in past incarnations. An [[action figure]] made by [[Kenner]] toys in 1998 featured a tail and [[dinosaur]]-like feet. When [[Mattel]] got the license to make DC products in the early 2000s, they released their own version of Killer Croc, sculpted by the Four Horsemen. This version also featured a tail and dinosaur feet. In late 2005, a re-release of this figure was modified so that the tail, along with his shirt was removed. This version also sports a more "human" head. The 2002-2003 ''Batman'' storyline ''Hush'' featured a more bestial Croc who had been [[mutation|mutated]] against his will to appear more reptilian. This version of the character was drawn by artist [[Jim Lee]].
