'''Killer Croc''' ('''Waylon Jones''') is a [[fiction]]al [[character (arts)|character]] in the [[DC Universe]], an [[supervillain|enemy]] of [[Batman]]. Created by writer [[Gerry Conway]] and artist [[Gene Colan]], he first appeared in ''[[Batman]]'' #357.

==Fictional character biography==
In Croc's initial string of appearances &mdash; a Detective Comics story arc that culminated in [[Jason Todd]] adopting the mantle of Robin &mdash; he was depicted as an unnamed, shadowy figure in a trenchcoat. A ruthless criminal who wants to become the crime kingpin of [[Gotham City]], Croc works behind the scenes using methods like sniping to eliminate his criminal competitors. He briefly unites a small army of Batman villains under his leadership. When Batman finally confronts his mysterious foe, the villain is revealed to have a massive physique and reptilian appearance. It is then revealed that his real name is Waylon Jones, born with a form of [[atavism]] that imparted him with reptilian traits. His parents grew to loathe their child's hideous appearance and brutal behavior. While still an adolescent, his father abandoned him in the wilderness. Croc survived, becoming a career criminal. Batman and the new Robin defeat him after a desperate battle.

In these original, [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|pre-crisis]] appearances, he resembled a powerfully-built man covered entirely in green scales, but was still basically human in his facial proportions and build. Over the years, writers have discarded the original conception of Croc as a crime lord; for instance, Killer Croc was originally depicted as gunning down Jason Todd's parents (this was later [[retcon]]ned to make [[Two-Face]] their murderer). His appearance and personality have become increasingly bestial, explained in the comics that his disease has slowly robbed him of all identifiable human traits. In his most recent appearances, he has an elongated snout and tail.

In ''Batman'' #489, Killer Croc attacks a shopping mall.  After delivering several blows to Croc, Batman (this was [[Jean-Paul Valley]]'s first appearance as Batman) is distracted by a glimpse of [[Bane (comics)|Bane]]; Croc then grabs Batman and tries to break his back.  He fails, and Bane pits himself against Croc, breaking his arms. He is then put back into [[Arkham Asylum]]. 

When Bane helps get Batman's rogues gallery out of Arkham in the ''[[Batman: Knightfall|Knightfall]]'' saga, Croc goes to get revenge on Bane.  While in the sewers, he smells Bane and goes after him, but finds only Robin.  Bane then attacks him, but the ledge they are standing on breaks and the three fall into the sewers.  The fight ends up as a draw. 

In a storyline that ran in ''Batman'' #521 and #522, Croc is summoned by a [[paranormal]] force to break out of Arkham and make his way to the [[Louisiana]] swamps.  Batman follows him there, only to find that the mysterious force is actually [[Swamp Thing]], who offers Croc a place in the swampland where he can finally give in to his animal side and live free from human persecution. 

Killer Croc has appeared in both the ''[[Batman: Hush|Hush]]'' storyline and its chronological follow up, ''[[Broken City]]''.  In the former, he is infected with a [[virus]] that greatly increases the rate of his devolution.

In 2005's ''Detective Comics'' #810, Killer Croc attempts to cure his condition.  When the doctor fails, Croc devours her.

In ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Croc becomes a member of [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].

===One Year Later===
In the ''[[One Year Later]]'' storyline, Killer Croc is seen feeding on the dead body of [[Orca (comics)|Orca]].  He next shows up in ''[[Countdown (DC Comics)|Countdown]]'' #50 in Arkham.  He breaks free from his shackles and attempts to kill [[Jimmy Olsen]], who uses elastic powers to escape.  Killer Croc is then subdued.

He is later seen among the exiled supervillains in ''[[Salvation Run]]''.  After the [[Martian Manhunter]] is defeated, Croc suggests that he eat him.  [[Lex Luthor]] forbids it, however, and then tells him to eat something else.

In ''DC Universe'' #0, Killer Croc can be seen as the member of [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra's]] Secret Society of Super Villains.  In ''[[Final Crisis]]'' #4, Croc is turned into a [[Justifiers|Justifier]].

In the ''[[Batman: Battle for the Cowl|Battle for the Cowl]]'' storyline, Killer Croc is recruited by a new [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]] to be a part of a group of villains aiming to take over Gotham.

During the events of ''[[Brightest Day]]'', Killer Croc is accidentally released from his cell by a guard who Osiris kills when [[Deathstroke]] and his band of [[Teen Titans#Brightest Day: Titans- Villains for Hire|Titans]] infiltrate Arkham. While attempting to flee from the facility, he is attacked by [[Osiris (DC Comics)|Osiris]], who mistakes Killer Croc for his old enemy [[Sobek (comics)|Sobek]].<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #28</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Killer Croc's backstory explains that he was born with a condition resembling [[epidermolytic hyperkeratosis]], a disfiguring skin disorder. However, it is actually a form of regressive [[atavism]], meaning that he has inherited traits of ancestral species of the human race, such as [[reptile]]s. This condition has been augmented by the presence of a [[metahuman|metagene]]. Consequently, he has several extraordinary physical abilities relating to his endurance, strength, and speed. 

His skin is hardened to the degree that it is nearly impenetrable to ordinary forms of [[abrasion (medical)|abrasion]] including high caliber weapons fired from a distance. He possesses a degree of super strength; for example, he was able to tear a bank vault door off of its hinges with minimal effort. He has demonstrated regenerative powers allowing him to heal and restore lost limbs and teeth. He possesses superhuman reflexes and speed, especially while he is moving underwater. Killer Croc also has an enhanced sense of smell.

==Character redesign==
In recent years, Killer Croc has been portrayed as being much more reptilian than in past incarnations. An [[action figure]] made by [[Kenner]] in 1998, featured a tail and [[dinosaur]]-like feet. When [[Mattel]] got the license to make DC products in the early 2000s, they released their own version of Killer Croc, sculpted by [[Four Horsemen Studios]]. This version also featured a tail and dinosaur feet. In late 2005, a re-release of this figure was modified so that the tail, along with his shirt, was removed. This version also sports a more "human" head. 

The 2002-2003 ''Batman'' storyline ''[[Batman: Hush|Hush]]'' featured a more bestial Croc who had been [[mutation|mutated]] against his will to appear more reptilian. This version of the character was drawn by artist [[Jim Lee]].

==Other versions==
In the graphic novel, [[Joker (graphic novel)|''Joker'']], written by [[Brian Azzarello]] and artist [[Lee Bermejo]],  Croc is portrayed as a [[wikt:thug|thug]], a large, muscular African American man with a scaly skin condition. Of all his previous designs, this is the most human. He is missing his abnormally long snout, tail, and claws. However, the book seems to hint that this Croc enjoys [[cannibalism|feeding on human flesh]] ("Croc has a certain...eccentric way with evidence", is one way the narrator of the story, Jonny Frost, puts it). Croc is seen as leading a gang of black thugs, and later being a high level member of Joker's newly formed gang. This vision of the character is not unlike the one from Azzarello's previous work on Batman, [[Broken City]] (although ''Joker'' is non-canon).

In ''Batman: Crimson Mist'', Killer Croc begins as a rumoured serial killer stalking Gotham's sewers, later joining [[Two-Face]]'s gang as the muscle. Faced with the threat of the vampire Batman stalking and killing his opponents, Killer Croc and Two-Face form an alliance with [[James Gordon (comics)#Vampire Batman|Commissioner Gordon]] and [[Alfred Pennyworth#Other Continuities|Alfred Pennyworth]] to trap Batman in the [[Batcave]] and expose him to the sunlight. Although Croc and Two-Face attempt to kill Gordon and Alfred when Batman is believed dead, Alfred is able to recover his old master, sacrificing his life and blood to give Batman the strength to stop Gotham's last criminals. With Alfred's sacrifice, Batman impales Croc with a stalagtite, commenting that Croc can keep his cold blood.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Killer Croc appears in several episodes of ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' voiced by [[Aron Kincaid]]. Waylon Jones is a former [[professional wrestling|pro wrestler]] who turned to crime. In this series, he is given lumpy gray skin as opposed to his normal green, teeth filed to points, and his reptilian appearance is toned down somewhat. Moreover, the character is far less formidable, as his chief assets—his strength and toughness—provide him with no real edge over Batman, who consistently trounces him with relative ease. In the episode "''Vendetta''", he runs afoul of [[Harvey Bullock (comics)|Harvey Bullock]], who arrests him. Croc later escapes from prison and seeks revenge by framing him for the abduction of criminals Spider Conway and Joey "The Snail." In the episode "Sideshow", he escapes from a train bound for Levitz Prison and flees through the countryside, taking refuge in a town of naively trusting circus [[carny|carnies]] including a [[phocomelia|"seal boy"]] named Billy, a [[gigantism|giant]] named Goliath, [[conjoined twins]] named May and June, and a [[scoliosis|hunchbacked]] ringmaster named Richard. Although he begins to have second thoughts about it after they treat him like a family member, Croc plans to betray and kill his hosts for the money they have stored away for supplies. He mentions sardonically: "You said you could be yourself out here, remember? Well, I guess that's what I was doing. Being myself". In this episode, it is established that Croc is legally [[sanity|sane]], and therefore is to be sent to [[Blackgate Penitentiary]] instead of [[Arkham Asylum]]. Later in the series, Croc would serve as comic relief. In the episode "Almost Got 'Im", a group of villains are discussing how they almost defeated Batman. While everyone else describes almost killing Batman with some kind of complex deathtrap, Croc proudly proclaims that he once threw a rock at Batman. After a prolonged awkward stare from the other villains and an attempt to change the subject by Poison Ivy, he defensively added: "It was a big rock..." It was later revealed though that this Croc was Batman in disguise. In the episode "Trial", when Batman is put on trial by all the prisoners he's put in Arkham, Croc is among the [[kangaroo court]] shouting "Hit 'im with a rock!!" The episode "Sideshow" reveals a sequence where Croc nearly does hit Batman with a huge rock, but was drugged and couldn't throw it far enough to smash him. The rock is later referenced again in a season 3 webisode of [[Gotham Girls]] as an item in the evidence vault.

* Killer Croc appeared in ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'' episode "Love is a Croc" voiced by [[Brooks Gardner]]. Killer Croc has been revamped with a bulkier build and green scales and skin. He joins forces with the criminal [[wikia:DCanimated:Baby-Doll|Baby Doll]]. They go to live in the sewers, committing crimes planned by Doll and carried out largely by Croc. Baby Doll falls in love with him, until she overhears Croc boasting about manipulating her. Enraged, she betrays him to Batman and [[Batgirl]] and, in the ensuing fight, he is defeated after being drenched in boiling water.  He makes his final appearance in the later episode "Judgment Day", where he is seen trying to get [[Penguin (comics)|the Penguin]] to fence stolen jewels. That episode villain, the Judge ([[Two-Face]] in disguise), attacks and defeats him.
[[File:Killer Croc-medium-medium.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Killer Croc as he appears in ''The Batman''.]]
* Killer Croc appears in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' voiced by [[Ron Perlman]] in English and [[Hidetoshi Nakamura]] in the Japanese dub. In this version, Croc is even more reptilian and crocodile like than past versions and has a tail, although he also demonstrates a greater intellect and is much more sane and non-cannibalistic than traditional interpretations of the character due to his plan to steal money by flooding downtown Gotham by reversing pumps designed to drain Gotham canals in times of flooding. He appears to be much stronger than Batman and much like a crocodile, he's able to stay underwater for long periods of time. His origins are mostly unknown, with Croc providing little evidence about his past beyond his [[Cajun]] accent, although one of his henchmen tells Batman that there are different rumors: that he is a [[gene]]tic experiment gone awry, then turned mercenary and that he deals with the wrong kind of voodoo magic in the swamps, or that he is simply a circus freak (it is never explained which, if any, story is true). He recruits three criminals (two of them are referred to in the credits as Vic and Freddy) as henchmen to help him flood Gotham City. Along with a [[Cajun]] accent, he has two pet crocodiles to do his bidding. Batman later deprived him of his air supply enough to be taken down and left for the police to arrest him and his henchman (remarking that "''Crocs may like water but they're no fish''"). He later returns as part of the [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]]'s Team Penguin. Killer Croc and his henchmen later appear as one of the captive victims of Rumor after he ambushed him and his henchmen in their hideout. Croc makes his final appearance in "''The End of the Batman''" where he, the Penguin, [[Ventriloquist (comics)|Ventriloquist]], and [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]] team up to commit a crime spree now that they are under the protection of the vigilante [[Wrath (comics)|Wrath]].

===Film===
* Killer Croc appears as one of the villains in ''[[Batman: Gotham Knight]]'', in the segment "In Darkness Dwells". This version of Croc never speaks, and is only shown while under the influence of the toxin. During the segment, it is mentioned (by Gordon) that this version is afraid of bats. In this version, Waylon Jones is a [[cannibalism|cannibalistic]] [[serial killer]]. The [[urban legend]] in the segment goes that he was an infant born with the disfiguring skin disorder [[epidermolytic hyperkeratosis]] and that his mother abandoned him in the sewers of [[Gotham City]]. As an adult, he files his front teeth into points to compliment the reptilian appearance of his skin and becomes a circus [[sideshow]] performer. Later, Jones - now called Killer Croc - goes on a killing spree that eventually lands him in Arkham Asylum. There, his homicidal impulses intensify during treatment by [[Scarecrow (comics)|Dr. Jonathan Crane]], who experimented Killer Croc in his Fear Aversion therapy program. Croc escapes from Arkham and flees to the sewers along with Crane (now known as The Scarecrow) and a handful of escaped Arkham inmates. There, Scarecrow worked on another experiment on Croc by injecting his Fear Toxin into parts of his body. When Scarecrow orchestrates the [[kidnapping]] of Cardinal O'Fallon, Croc infiltrates the church and carries him down into the sewers. Batman comes to investigate, and Croc attacks him, biting him and infecting him with the fear toxin that is coursing through Croc's own body. After a lengthy battle, Batman fends off Croc by shoving a smoke [[grenade]] into his mouth; Croc was never found since.

=== Video games ===
* Killer Croc also appears in ''[[Lego Batman: The Video Game]]'' as a playable character (vocal effects by [[Steven Blum]]).<ref>''[[Game Informer]]'' features a two-page gallery of the many heroes and villains who appear in the game with a picture for each character and a descriptive paragraph. See "''LEGO Batman'': Character Gallery," ''Game Informer'' 186 (October 2008): 93.</ref>

* Killer Croc appears in ''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]]'' voiced again by [[Steven Blum]]. The video game portrays him as far larger than he has ever been before, with his in-game biography listing him as a [[cannibalistic]] [[serial killer]] who is eleven feet tall and weighing five hundred and eighty pounds with massive teeth protruding over his jaws and grey scales, but with a more humanoid appearance overall. In the game, Killer Croc more fully represents the Peter Pan angle of the crocodile that eats the hand of Captain Hook (Aaron Cash), with his hatred of Cash, Cash's intense fear of Killer Croc, and Killer Croc's repeated lines of 'tick, tock' and 'tick, tock, feed the croc'. He attacks Batman later on in the game, who had to enter Killer Croc's lair in order to collect spore samples from Poison Ivy's plants to create an antidote to the Titan formula. When Killer Croc closes in on Batman to eat him, Batman ends up setting off the explosive gel which breaks the floor sending Killer Croc into the water below. Just before this happens he defeats Scarecrow by dragging him into his sewer. At the end of the game, he is one of the three possible villains who grab hold of a crate filled with the Titan formula.

* Killer Croc appears in ''[[DC Universe Online]]''.

===Books===
* In the novel ''Batman: Knightfall and Beyond'', based largely on the comics storyline, Killer Croc is said to have suffered from "a raging [[skin cancer]]" that turned the outer layers of his flesh into a hardened covering when he was younger. He escapes from Arkham Asylum when Bane and his men destroy it, freeing most of Batman's major foes in the process as part of a plan by Bane to wear him down before Bane himself "breaks" him. Batman later defeats Croc in a one-on-one fight in the sewers, crushing a cylinder of knock-out gas against the underside of his nose to disable him. Croc is then arrested and held in Blackgate Prison with the other Arkham escapees until the asylum can be rebuilt.

===Miscellaneous===
* In the DC comic ''[[The Batman Adventures]]'', Croc reveals that his mother died when he was born, and that he was raised by his cruel aunt.
* Killer Croc was featured in issue 3 of the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' [[Batman: The Brave and the Bold (comics)|comic series]].
