'''Killer Croc''', is a [[fictional character]] in [[DC comics]]. He is an enemy of [[Batman]]. He is best known for being born with his powers instead of getting them by accident. 

==Character biography==
'''Waylon Jones''' was born with a medical condition that caused him to grow progressively more like a [[crocodile]], hence his name. In the comics, his intelligence level has been portrayed differently, varying from competent schemer to berserk monster.

Jones is one of the few black supervillains.{{fact}} In his original appearances, he resembled a powerfully-built black man covered entirely in green scales. However, his disease has slowly robbed him of all identifiable human traits. 

In a storyline that ran in ''Batman'' issues 521 and 522, Killer Croc was summoned by some strange [[paranormal]] force to break out of [[Arkham Asylum]] and make his way to the [[Louisiana]] swamps. Batman followed him there only to find that the mysterious force was actually the [[Swamp Thing]], who offered Croc a place in the swampland where he could finally give in to his animal side and live free from human persecution. There he stayed, and Batman returned to [[Gotham City]]. 

Some time after Killer Croc has appeared in both the ''[[Batman: Hush|Hush]]'' storyline and its chronological follow up, ''[[Broken City]]''.

In 2005's ''Detective Comics'' #810, Killer Croc attempted to cure his condition. When the doctor failed, she was devoured by him, as seen occurring on-panel, thus settling the controversy surrounding Killer Croc's often implied and threatened [[cannibalism]] in the comics.

==="One Year Later"===   
{{main article|One Year Later}}   
Killer Croc was discovered feeding on the remains of [[Orca (comics)|Orca]]. How or why he returned to Gotham City has yet to be disclosed.

==Powers and abilities==
The disease the Killer Croc is afflicted with seems to be some form of regressive [[atavism]], meaning he has inherited some of the traits of ancestral species of the human race. His skin has hardened to the point where it is invulnerable to most forms of abrasion and even low calibre weapons fired from a distance. His strength is physically enhanced, as he is several times stronger than Batman. He has shown an ability to heal faster than normal for a human, and an ability to heal injuries that do not normally heal on their own, such as the broken limbs and spine he received from [[Bane (comics)|Bane]]. A side effect of Croc's condition seems to be that over time the primal reptilian part of his brain gains more control of his [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]].

Croc has some experience at street fighting and wrestling, but he is nowhere near as proficient as Batman or [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]]. He is a high school dropout, but has proven to be moderately capable of organizing thugs in small-time [[racketeering]] operations. He is usually hired by other villains as either muscle or a hitman, as he is at least intelligent enough to follow instructions.

==Other media==
*Croc, as he is sometimes called for short, also appeared in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' in a few episodes, voiced by [[Aron Kincaid]]. In this series, he was given grey skin as opposed to his normal green and his reptilian appearance was toned down somewhat. It seems he was once a [[wrestling|pro wrestler]], but grew dissatisfied with that and turned to crime. He ran afoul of [[Harvey Bullock (comics)|Harvey Bullock]], who arrested him; Croc later escaped prison and sought revenge. 

:When being transported to a distant facility by train, he bit through his chains (it seems like a real [[crocodile]], his jaws exude enough force to crush bone) and escaped. Fleeing through the countryside, he took refuge in a town of naively trusting circus carnies (including a [[phocomelia|"seal boy"]], a [[gigantism|giant]], [[conjoined twins]], and a [[scoliosis|hunchbacked]] ringmaster). In this story, he showed that he had a heart. But that quickly changed with his greed for money. Croc planned to betray and kill his hosts for the money they had stored away for supplies. In that episode it was established that Croc is legally [[sane]], and therefore was to be sent to [[Blackgate Penitentiary]] instead of [[Arkham Asylum]]. In the DC comic ''The Batman and Robin Adventures'', Croc seemed romantically inclined towards reporter [[Summer Gleeson]], to whom he revealed that his mother had died when he was born, and was raised by a cruel aunt who liked to drink. 

:He also appeared &mdash; revamped, with green skin &mdash; in an episode of ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'' where he joined forces with the criminal [[Baby Doll (Batman: The Animated Series)|Baby Doll]].  Baby Doll, who had a condition that made her look like a child even though she was an adult, believed she had found a kindred spirit in fellow 'freak'  Killer Croc. They went to live in the sewers, committing crimes planned by Doll and carried out largely by Croc.  When Baby Doll overheard Croc essentially bragging about how he was using her, and didn't care about her at all, she betrayed him to Batman and [[Batgirl]].

Twice during the run of the show, during the afore mentioned episode Sideshow and a TNBA episode entitled [[The Judge]], Croc is implied to have committed murder. However, he never commits such an act on screen; it is implied he did such actions either between episodes or before his first appearance.

* In 2005 the animated television series ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' featured yet another version of Killer Croc, voiced by [[Ron Perlman]]. In this episode Croc was even more reptilian, had a tail and was rumored to have been a military [[gene]]tic experiment gone awry, moving even further away from the character's comic book origins and appearance. He recruited three criminals, two of them voiced by [[Jim Cummings]], as henchmen to help him flood Gotham City. This animated version also spoke with a Cajun accent and had two pet crocodiles/alligators to do his bidding. He later returned as part of [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]]'s Team Penguin.

*Killer Croc is featured in the [[Lego Batman]] building toy set 7780 [[Batboat]]: the Hunt for Killer Croc. Croc rides a jetski, pitted against Batman in a hovercraft version of the Batboat. Killer Croc appears in [[minifigure]] form with his signature jeans as in the comic, with a distinct reptilian appearance comprising green skin, scales and a sharp-toothed grin. His head, however, is humanoid.

==Video Game Appearance==
Killer Croc appeared as a boss in the ''[[Batman: Dark Tomorrow]]'' game.

==Redesign==
In recent years, Killer Croc has been portrayed as being much more reptilian than in past incarnations. An [[action figure]] made by [[Kenner]] toys in 1998 featured a tail and dinosaur-like feet, unlike the comics character. When Mattel gotten the license to make DC products in the early 2000's, they released their own version of Killer Croc, sculpted by the Four Horsemen.  This version also featured a tail and dinosaur feet. In late 2005, a re-release of this figure was modified so that the tail, along with his shirt was removed.  This version also sports a more "human" head. The already-famous 2002-2003 ''Batman'' storyline [[Batman: Hush|Hush]] featured a more bestial Croc who had been [[mutation|mutated]] against his will to appear more reptilian as drawn by artist [[Jim Lee]].
