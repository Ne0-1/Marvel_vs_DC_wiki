'''Killer Croc''', or '''Waylon Jones''', is a [[fictional character]] in [[DC comics]]. He is a criminal and nemesis of [[Batman]]. He has a medical condition that is causing him to grow progressively more like a [[crocodile]], hence his name. In the comics, his intelligence level has been portrayed differently, varying from competent schemer to simply a berserk monster.

==Character biography==
Croc, as he is sometimes called for short, also appeared in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' in a few episodes. It seems he was once a [[wrestling|pro wrestler]], but grew dissatisfied with that and turned to crime. He ran afoul of [[Harvey Bullock]], who arrested him; Croc later escaped [[prison]] and sought [[revenge]]. 

When being transported to a distant facility by [[train]], he bit through his chains (it seems like a real [[crocodile]], his jaws exude enough force to crush [[bone]]) and escaped. Fleeing through the countryside, he refuge in a town of naively trusting circus carnies (including a [[seal (animal)|seal]] boy, a [[giant]], [[conjoined twins]], and a [[scoliosis|hunchbacked]] ringmaster). In this story, he showed that he had a heart. But that quickly changed with his greed for money.  Croc planned to betray and kill his hosts for the money they had stored away for supplies. In that episode it was established that Croc is legally [[sane]], and therefore was to be sent to [[Black Gate]] instead of [[Arkham Asylum]]. 

He also appeared &mdash; revamped, with [[green]] skin &mdash; in an episode of ''Gotham Knights'' where he joined forces with the little girl criminal named [[Baby Doll (Batman: The Animated Series)|Baby Doll]], because they both were misunderstood 'freaks'. They went to live in the [[sewer]]s, but Baby Doll, believing that Croc didn't like her, eventually betrayed him to Batman and [[Batgirl]].

In another storyline that ran in ''Batman'' issues 521 and 522, Killer Croc was summoned by some strange [[paranormal]] force to break out of Arkham Asylum and make his way to the [[Lousiana]] swamps. Batman followed him there only to find that the mysterious force was actually the [[Swamp Thing]], who offered Croc a place in the swampland where he could finally give in to his animal side and live free from human persecution. There he stayed, and Batman returned to [[Gotham City]].

==Powers and abilities==
The disease the Killer Croc is afflicted with seems to be some form of regressive [[atavism]], meaning he has inherited some of the traits of ancestral species of the human race. His skin has hardened to the point where it is invulnerable to most forms of abrasion and even low calibre weapons fired from a distance. His strength is physically enhanced as he is several times as strong as Batman, whose strength is at the olympic athlete level. A side effect of this condition seems to be that over time the primal reptilian part of his brain gains more control of his [[psyche]].

Croc has some experience at street fighting and wrestling, but he is no where near as profficient as Batman or [[Robin (comics)|Nightwing]]. He is a high school drop out, but has proven to be moderately capable of organizing thugs in small-time [[racketeering]] operations. He is usually hired by other villains as muscle or as a hitman, as he is at least intelligent enough to follow instructions.

==Controversy==
In recent years, Killer Croc has been portrayed as being much more reptilian than in past incarnations. A Croc [[action figure]] made by [[Kenner]] toys in 1998 featured a tail and [[dinosaur]]-like feet, unlike the comics character. The already-famous 2002-2003 ''Batman'' storyline [[Batman: Hush|Hush]] featured a more bestial Croc who had been [[mutation|mutated]] against his [[will (philosophy)|will]] to appear more reptilian as drawn by artist [[Jim Lee]].[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/24/Crochush.jpeg]  In the ''Hush'' comic, Killer Croc did not have a tail, but a Croc action figure based on the ''Hush'' version of the character produced the following year by [[Mattel]] toys did. In 2005 the animated television series ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' featured a Killer Croc, played by [[Ron Perlman]], in one episode that was even more reptilian, had a tail, and was rumored to have been a military [[gene]]tic experiment gone awry, moving even further away from the character's comic book [[origin]]s and appearance. He had recruited three robbers, two of them were played by [[Jim Cummings]], as henchmen to help him flood Gotham City. This animated version was also apparently Cajun and had the ability to control crocodiles to do his bidding.
