==Publication history==
[[Image:Daredevil232Nuke.jpg|left|thumb|Nuke's first appearance, ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #232 (Jul. 1986). Art by [[David Mazzucchelli]].]]
Nuke was created by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] and [[David Mazzuchelli]]. He first appeared in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #232. Nuke largely disappeared following his apparent death in ''Daredevil'' #233, although his origin was explored and touched upon in issues of ''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' and ''[[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]]''. It was not until [[Grant Morrison]]'s ''[[New X-Men]]'', when Morrison revealed Nuke was involved in the [[Weapon Plus]] program, that the character made a return in subsequent stories.

==Fictional character biography==
Nuke was a test subject of the [[Weapon Plus#Weapon VII|Weapon Plus]] program, the supersoldier program that had created [[Captain America]] and would later have their [[Weapon X]] facility transform [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] into a killing machine. The enhancing and conditioning process went awry, leaving Nuke seriously deranged.

===Early life===
The origins of Nuke are explained in the series ''[[Wolverine (character)#Wolverine: Origins|Wolverine: Origins]]''.

The disturbed son of a wealthy, abusive, [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]], upper-class woman in Ohio, Frank soon developed an unhealthy affection for his babysitter, the only real maternal figure in his life. The young woman, who was harboring feelings for his father Charles, capitalized on Frank's affection and talked the boy into killing his mother. Wolverine, who at that time was an operative for Weapon Plus, had been sent to kidnap Frank Simpson. Wolverine showed up, dressed as a cop. He then stalked Charles Simpson and the babysitter, eventually shooting the girl with Charles' gun, after which Charles committed suicide. Wolverine then went to Frank's place and abducted him for the supersoldier project.<ref>''Wolverine: Origins'' #3 (2006). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Years later, Frank Simpson was sent into the [[Vietnam War]] as a black-ops agent. Captured by the [[National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam|Viet Cong]], Frank was severely tortured by Logan (who was posing as a Russian intelligence liaison), shattering Frank's still unbalanced mind. While torturing him (even carving into his face the American flag that years later would become part of his superpowered personality), he implanted the phrase "No V.C.!" as a [[Post-traumatic stress disorder|trigger word]], along with the compulsion to kill gruesomely, in retaliation for the tortures suffered, anyone who uttered the words. He then allowed Frank to escape, testing his work with a village of peasants, who, seeing an American soldier, tried to soothe his anger and convince him to spare them, shouting the "No V.C.!" phrase, meaning that they weren't Viet Cong. Frank, in response to the trigger word, burnt the village to the ground killing every inhabitant. The experiment being a success, Logan was installed as his handler. Due to his trauma, Nuke often hallucinates that the enemies he is fighting are the Viet Cong.<ref>''Wolverine: Origins'' #2 (2006). Marvel Comics.</ref>

At some time during the war, Nuke was inducted into the final part of the ''Project Homegrown'', the [[Weapon Plus#Weapon VII|Weapon VII]] programs, that turned him in a partial [[cyborg]] with a subdermal mesh able to deflect bullets, and a second heart that, working in conjunction with some ([[placebo]]) pills, controlled his aggression, leaving him addicted as well. His whereabouts after the war are still unknown.<ref>''New X-Men'' #145. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===First appearance===
Nuke resurfaces, employed by Generalissimo Felix Guillermo Carridad, of Tierra Verde, to destroy a rebel base. Carridad is impressed with his skills, and he enjoys using Nuke periodically as a superhuman iconic symbol.<ref>''Wolverine'' (vol. 2) #18. Marvel Comics.</ref> Following an operation in [[Nicaragua]], the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] hires Nuke through a corrupt general and sends him to kill [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]. Nuke launches an attack on [[Hell's Kitchen]], but is defeated by Daredevil. Enraged at a ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' article reporting on his mass murder in Hell's Kitchen, he escapes his handlers, intending to destroy the ''Bugle'' building. He is intercepted by [[Captain America]] and shot by a military chopper. He faints from the wound and is presumed dead by the general public.<ref>''Daredevil'' #232-233. Marvel Comics.</ref> Nuke was taken into custody by the government, still controlled by the Tierra Verde enclave.<ref>''Wolverine: Origins'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''Wolverine: Origins'' - ''The Death of Wolverine''===
In the series ''Wolverine: Origins'', following Wolverine's regaining of his full memories, and his embarking on a mission to take care of loose ends, the U.S. government dispatches Nuke to hunt Wolverine down.<ref>''Wolverine: Origins'' #1-2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Though Wolverine dispatches Nuke, it is revealed that Nuke's enhanced physiology has further mutated, giving him cybernetic limbs, bones and skull, and the ability to survive the most gruesome injuries, but has left him devoid of any personality or conscience. When Wolverine tries to kill him, [[Captain America]] intervenes, believing that Nuke is a failed subject of the Super Soldier Program. Wolverine asked the telepath [[Emma Frost]] to restore Nuke's broken mind, saying that he would [[euthanize]] Nuke if she determined that it was not possible.<ref name=WolverineOrigins>''Wolverine: Origins'' #3-5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]]'s tenure as the head of the American peace-keeping organization H.A.M.M.E.R., he adds a man named [[Scourge of the Underworld|Scourge]] to his [[black ops]] team, the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]],<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #133 - 135. Marvel Comics.</ref> but the man later reveals himself to be Nuke, and is demoted from the position of team leader.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #136. Marvel Comics.</ref> During the events of the storyline "[[Siege (comics)|Siege]]", Nuke sustains injuries that render him comatose.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #142 - 145. Marvel Comics.</ref> In ''Captain America'' Vol 7, Simpson is allied with the Iron Nail, attacking individuals in Europe that he perceives as enemies of America, until he is stopped by Captain America.<ref>''Captain America'' Vol 7 #12. Marvel Comics.</ref> He is caught in an explosion and presumed dead.<ref>''Captain America'' Vol 7 #17. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Nuke later appears alive with a shaved head in the ''[[Death of Wolverine]]'' mini-series. He is seen working for [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Madame Hydra]] and hunting Wolverine as part of her bounty. While at a bar in British Columbia, Wolverine uses his adamantium skull to headbutt Nuke to spread the word that he spared him while also getting the information on who placed the bounty on him.<ref>''Death of Wolverine'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Nuke possesses various superhuman physical attributes as a result of various [[cybernetic]] enhancements. Nuke's bones have been replaced with advanced cybernetic components, granting him superhuman strength of an unrevealed limit. Aside from his strength, Nuke's body is considerably more resistant to physical injury than that of an ordinary human; even the arcane nerve strikes Daredevil learned during training by his sensei, [[Stick (comics)|Stick]], have no effect. Nuke's skin has been replaced with an artificial type of plastic that looks identical to human skin but is much more durable. In addition, he has an artificial secondary heart that works in conjunction with his colored pills. Nuke is the victim of decades of systematic physical and psychological conditioning at the hands of various individuals working for the United States government. As a result, Nuke is insane. He is now little more than a puppet in the hands of his current handler, and able only to follow issued commands. Also in his first appearance in ''Daredevil'', Nuke was equipped with a monstrous multi-barrelled assault rifle which, in addition to being able to fire massive volleys of bullets, fragmentation grenades, and rockets, was also (due to mechanisms left unexplained) able to "keep count" of the casualties inflicted. Nuke also had a habit of resetting the counter after noting down each "score" trying to "better" it in the coming assignment.{{issue|date=December 2015}}

Apparently Nuke's metabolism is now remote controlled from a secret base on Tierra Verde, whose technicians are able to ''shut down'' the [[biotechnology|biomech]] systems in Nuke's body.<ref name=WolverineOrigins/>

===Pills===
Nuke has a second heart, and takes different colored pills to produce different bodily effects.
Nuke's pill colors are: red, for increased [[adrenaline]]; blue to bring him down; and white, to keep him balanced between missions.

It was originally stated that the red pills Nuke took affected his [[adrenal gland]]s, sending him into his bloodthirsty rages.{{Issue|date=November 2009}} The ''[[Wolverine (character)#Wolverine: Origins|Wolverine: Origins]]'' series [[retcon]]ned this, stating instead that these pills are [[placebo]]s, suggesting that Nuke lives in a constant state of increased adrenaline, but is not aware of this. The pills, therefore, trigger his violent behavior, but the effect is [[psychosomatic]].{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

==Other versions==
In the "[[House of M]]" storyline, Nuke is one of the government agents (alongside [[Mimic (comics)|Mimic]] and [[Bucky|Agent Barnes]]) sent to [[Genosha]] to kill [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] and as many of his followers as possible. He and Mimic served as a distraction while Agent Barnes snuck into Magneto's headquarters.<ref>''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War: House of M]]'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Nuke entered [[Scarlet Witch|Wanda]]'s bedroom in order to kill her, he was disassembled by her.<ref>''Civil War: House of M'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

''What If'' v2 #48 showed what would have happened if Daredevil had saved Nuke. This story manifests as [[Ben Urich]] pondering the situation and thinking of alternatives.<ref>''What If'' #48. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, Frank Simpson appears in ''Ultimate Comics: Captain America'' #1 as the man who was given the [[Super Soldier Serum]] during the [[Vietnam War]] when Steve Rogers was MIA after [[World War II]], but his origin is more reminiscent of the [[Grand Director]], a Captain America post [[World War II]].<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Captain America'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Like his mainstream counterpart, Simpson has the American Flag tattooed onto his face.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Captain America'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Simpson, completely disillusioned by America after [[Vietnam]] (1972) is believed to have betrayed his country due to the war and the augmentations, but has "seen the Light". He is trying to sell his reverse-engineered serum blood to the [[North Korea]]ns, but is stopped by British [[Special Air Service|S.A.S.]] and Steve Rogers. After his identity is revealed to [[Carol Danvers|Colonel Danvers]], Cap is beaten, and travels to Saloth, a [[Cambodia]]n village, but Simpson and his army (all pumped up with the [[Super-Soldier Serum]]) beat him. Simpson vows to make Cap, "see the light", strongly believing America stands for a number of atrocities in the last 50 years. Cap escapes and stops Simpson. He is brought into [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody. Simpson is later visited by Cap in the [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]], which has Rogers reading the [[Bible]] to a bed-ridden Simpson.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Captain America'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the [[Amalgam Comics]] universe, in which the characters of Marvel Comics were merged with those of [[DC Comics]], Nuke is combined with DC's [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] as [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|Hydra]] agent '''Bane Simpson'''.<ref>''Bruce Wayne: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #1. Marvel Comics/[[DC Comics]].</ref>

==In other media==
[[Wil Traval]] portrays '''Will Simpson''' in ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]''. Traval stated the character's origin was "reinvented" for the series.<ref name="SimpsonNuke">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/11/nycc-2015-marvels-nuke-looks-to-be-part-of-jessica-jones|title=NYCC 2015: Marvel's Nuke Looks To Be Part Of Jessica Jones|last=Fowler|first=Matt|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=October 10, 2015|accessdate=October 10, 2015|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6cBlB6RHO|archivedate=October 10, 2015|deadurl=no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/jessica-jones-easter-eggs-netflix-marvel-mcu/|title=Jessica Jones Easter Eggs, Marvel Connections, & Comic Nods|last=Dyce|first=Andrew|publisher=Screen Rant|date=November 23, 2015|accessdate=November 24, 2015|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6dGzN76gy|archivedate=November 24, 2015|deadurl=no}}</ref> Simpson is a former special ops soldier, now a Sergeant at the [[New York City Police Department]]'s 15th Precinct. He is introduced when he is sent by [[Purple Man|Kilgrave]] to kill [[Patsy Walker|Trish Walker]] following an on-phone radio interview with Hope Schlottman (in which she had bashed Kilgrave's character greatly). Jessica is able to free Simpson of Kilgrave's control after Kilgrave tries to command him into jumping off a rooftop. Free of Kilgrave's control, Simpson becomes a lover to Trish. He remains at odds with Jessica, as he is determined to murder Kilgrave to prevent him from hurting anyone else. His attempt to kill Kilgrave by planting a bomb in Jessica's childhood house fails, as Kilgrave finds the bomb and commands Jessica's neighbor to detonate it while returning it to Simpson. When he recovers, Simpson takes drastic action by reconnecting with his military unit, using experimental pills to increase combat awareness. They also make him more manic, to the point that he kills fellow detective Oscar Clemmons and two of his fellow operatives. He then attempts to kill Jessica when he believes that she doesn't have what it takes to kill Kilgrave. He is stopped by both Jessica and Trish when the latter takes some of his combat enhancements and is able to overpower him. Left unconscious, Simpson is later taken away by members of the mysterious "IGH" organization who provided him with the supplements.
