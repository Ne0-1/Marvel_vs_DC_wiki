'''Seamus Mellencamp''' is a member of the [[supervillain]] group the [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]], who serve [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. He first appeared (named Seamus Melloncamp) in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #300, created by [[Scott Lobdell]] and [[John Romita, Jr.]]. 

==History==

As one of the minor Acolytes, little is known about Mellencamp. He is fanatically devoted to Magneto and his teachings that [[Mutant (fictional)|mutants]] are superior to humans. During his first battle with the [[X-Men]], Mellencamp was defeated by [[Jean Grey]], who used her telekinetic powers to throw him many miles away. As Mellencamp was invulnerable, he survived this attack. In his second conflict with the X-men allied group [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], he tried to kill [[Jamie Madrox|Multiple Man]], who in self-defense created a duplicate of himself within Mellancamp's body, killing him. 

Mellencamp returned without explanation in the pages of ''[[Power Man and Iron Fist|Heroes for Hire]]'' #16. (In the pages of ''[[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]]'' a possible explanation was given: the Acolytes leader [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]] claimed to have the ability to resurrect the dead Acolytes.) Mellencamp remained an Acolyte over the next few months and followed Magneto when he took over the island state [[Genosha]]. Genosha and its inhabitants were nearly all exterminated by [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]]. Mellencamp hasn't been seen since and is presumed one of the victims.
