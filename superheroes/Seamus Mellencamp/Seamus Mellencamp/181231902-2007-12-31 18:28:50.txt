'''Seamus Mellencamp''' is a member of the [[supervillain]] group the [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]], who serve [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. He first appeared (named Seamus Melloncamp) in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #300, created by [[Scott Lobdell]] and [[John Romita, Jr.]]. 

==Fictional character biography==
Little is known about Mellencamp's past, save that he was severely and inhumanly abused and mistreated as a child due to his developing mutation. He is loyaly devoted to Magneto and his teachings that [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutants]] are superior to humans, so much so that he has been referred to as the "Noble Knight of the Acolytes." During his first battle with the [[X-Men]], Mellencamp is defeated by [[Jean Grey]]. She uses her telekinetic powers to throw him many miles away. As Mellencamp was invulnerable, he survives this attack. In his second conflict with the X-men allied group [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], he tries to kill [[Jamie Madrox|Multiple Man]]. In self-defense, Multiple Man creates a duplicate of himself within Mellancamp's body, supposedly killing him. 

Mellencamp returns without explanation in the pages of ''[[Power Man and Iron Fist|Heroes for Hire]]'' #16. (In the pages of ''[[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]]'' a possible explanation was given: the Acolytes leader [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]] claims to have the ability to resurrect the dead Acolytes.) Mellencamp remains an Acolyte over the next few months and follows Magneto when he takes over the island state of [[Genosha]]. Genosha and its inhabitants were nearly all exterminated by [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]].

==Powers and abilities==
Mellencamp has a body that has been mentioned as a resemblance of The [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] crossed with [[Godzilla]]{{Fact|date=December 2007}}. He is reptilian in physical appearance with slitted eyes, emerald scales, black hair coming out from under the scales on his head, a powerful prehensile tail, razor sharp teeth and claws, and a large physical build. His height and weight are 7 ft. 5 in. and 422 lb. His animalistic mutation burned off all forms of fat on his body so that he is purely muscle.

All of Mellencamp's physical abilities are greatly beyond a human in peak physical condition. His strength allows him to lift up an object from a pick-up truck to a building and can even cause harm to those who have superhuman durability. He can nearly never become tired because of his immense stamina, this lets him do strenuous activities for days on end. 

Mellencamp has senses far beyond that of any human and many animals. He is able to see in total darkness, blinding light, and under water. His hearing is so great that he can use selective hearing to listen for sound that he only wants/needs to hear. His sense of smell is strong enough to track targets by scent, even if the scent has been eroded over time naturally. He is even able to identify people by scent alone. His sense of taste though seems to be over sensitive, as he has become obsessed with fruits as his favorite foods, especially apples, just by their sweet taste.

It has been shown in the X-men Chaos Engine Trilogy novels that Mellencamp is somehow immune to all, if not most forms of life energy draining as seen when he was biting into the shoulder of [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] while she was trying to drain him to get him off of her. This shows that even when two points of his body, his teeth and hand, were in contact with Rouge, he could not be drained.

The armored plates covering his body are highly resistant to damage, although his internal organs proved vulnerable to Multiple Man's attack.

==Personality==
Mellancamp has gained the nickname of "Noble Knight of the Acolytes" because he has served Magneto as a knight serves it's king. He has a strict personal code, stating that he will defend his allies and friends completely, and treat his enemy with respect. 

Mellancamp absolutely hates torture. He was abused severely both physically and mentally as a child by his parents on inhumane levels, resulting in him keeping his feelings to himself and not showing much emotion. He is friendly though, as he befriended [[Scarlet Witch]], who respected him and considered him to be one of the few people following Magneto who she could have intelligent company with when compaired to others like [[Toad (comics)|Toad]] and [[Blob (comics)|Blob]].

Mellancamp is portrayed as a smart and quiet person. He keeps himself calm, reserved, and polite at all times, even going so far as to warn his enemies to think over their decision of choosing to fight him. When entering battle, his personality changes. He becomes a vicious animal of a man, while retaining his intelligence- this makes him a very deadly foe combining raw animal savagery, and a human's thinking.

This personality change is a mental condition. All of the sufferings from Mellancamp's life is used to spur him on to fight and beat his opponent down. When he has finished fighting, his personality changes back to his calmer self.

==Footnotes==
Mellancamp has [[Heterochromia]]. His left eye is red, and his right eye is a silver/white.
