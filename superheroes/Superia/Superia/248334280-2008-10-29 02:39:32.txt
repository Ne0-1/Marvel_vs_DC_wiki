'''Superia''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[misandry|misandrist]] [[supervillain]] and criminal scientist in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  She was created by writer [[Mark Gruenwald]] and artist [[Rik Levins]] in ''[[Captain America]]'' (vol. 1) #390 ([[1991#August|August 1991]]).

==Fictional character biography==
Little is known of the past of the woman known as Superia, but she was first seen where she and a small army of female supervillains plotted to sterilize all other women in the world, making their reproductive capabilities valuable beyond measure.<ref>''Captain America'' (vol. 1) #387-392</ref>  She was initially inspired to use her scientific knowledge to conquer the world when she discovered, via use of a "time probe", that a descendant of hers, [[Thundra]], would rule the world-spanning [[matriarchy]] of the "[[Femizons]]".  Her plan was thwarted by Captain America and his allies ([[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]], [[Diamondback (comics)|Diamondback]], [[Asp (comics)|Asp]] and [[Black Mamba (comics)|Black Mamba]]).

She later appeared alongside a much smaller group of Femizons, consisting of [[Blackbird (comics)|Blackbird]], [[Iron Maiden (comics)|Iron Maiden]], [[Nightshade (Marvel Comics)|Nightshade]] and [[Snapdragon (comics)|Snapdragon]].  This group fought against the criminal scientists of [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|AIM]], and were defeated, thanks in part to former Femizon [[MODOK|M.O.D.A.M.]]  Superia was saved from certain death by Captain America.

Superia again appeared as "Dr. Deidre Wentworth", and gave a young woman named Cathy Webster [[superhuman]] physical traits and subliminal performance-boosting messages.  These messages also bound Webster (now called [[Free Spirit (comics)|Free Spirit]]) to Superia's control, though Webster was quickly freed.  After a failed negotiation with the [[Baroness Zemo]], she convinced Diamondback to join her as penance for having killed her former lieutenant Snapdragon.  Superia and Diamondback resurfaced soon after, when Superia was convinced to give Captain America a treatment to partially reverse a paralytic effect resulting from the serum that had given him his powers.  The three of them, alongside other allies of Captain America, attacked AIM to steal its new [[Cosmic Cube]], but were forced to retreat.  She offered a permanent cure to Captain America, but the cure was stolen by the [[Red Skull]], whose mind was at the time living in a body [[clone (genetics)|cloned]] from Captain America; he used the cure on himself, and shot and apparently killed Superia.

==Powers and abilities==
In addition to being a [[polymath]] scientific genius, Superia demonstrated superhuman strength and the ability to project concussive blasts in her first fight with Captain America.  The origin of her powers is unknown.  Given that she is a scientific genius, some or all of her powers may be generated by her costume.  Superia also claimed to be a highly-trained martial artist, although Captain America derided her abilities (possibly in order to make her act irrationally).
