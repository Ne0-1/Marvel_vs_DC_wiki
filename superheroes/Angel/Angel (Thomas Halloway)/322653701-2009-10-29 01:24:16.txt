The '''Angel''' ('''Thomas Halloway''') is a [[fictional character]], [[superhero]] in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by writer-artist [[Paul Gustavson]] during the period comics fans and historians call the [[Golden Age of comic books]], the Angel [[first appeared]] in ''[[Marvel Mystery Comics|Marvel Comics]] #1'' (Oct. 1939), the first publication of Marvel predecessor [[Timely Comics]].

The Angel, like [[Batman]], is a non-superpowered detective who nonetheless wore a superhero costume. Gustavson cited [[Leslie Charteris]]' [[pulp magazines|pulp-novel]] detective, [[Simon Templar]], the "Saint," as a model for the Angel.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

==Publication history==
The Angel was the next-most-popular Timely character after the "big three" of the [[Human Torch (android)|Human Torch]], the [[Namor the Sub-Mariner|Sub-Mariner]] and [[Captain America]], with more than 100 Golden Age appearances â€” starting in that initial Marvel title (which changed its name to ''Marvel Mystery Comics'' with issue #2), up through #79 (Dec. 1946); as the sole backup feature in ''Sub-Mariner Comics'' #1-21 (Spring 1941 - Fall 1946); and in occasional appearances in ''[[Mystic Comics]]'' and ''Daring Comics''.

A [[simulacrum]] of the Angel was temporarily created from the mind of [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]], along with those of the [[Blazing Skull]], the [[Fin (comics)|Fin]], the [[Jeffrey Mace|Patriot]], and the Golden Age [[Vision (Timely Comics)|Vision]], to aid the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] during the [[Kree-Skrull War]], in ''The Avengers''  #97 (March 1972).

The Angel is one of the central characters of the 2009 comic-book series ''[[The Marvels Project]]'', by writer [[Ed Brubaker]] and penciler [[Steve Epting]].

==Fictional character biography==
A costumed detective with no superpowers, the Angel is among the few such heroes to wear no mask, and in his Golden Age appearances makes no effort to conceal his identity as independently wealthy Thomas Halloway, a former surgeon. He later acquires the "mystic cape of [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]"<ref>Marvel Mystery Comics vol. 1 #11</ref>, which allows him to fly, but he has used this ability only occasionally, as on his campaign against the foreign spy Cat's Paw.<ref>''Marvel Mystery Comics'' #20 (June 1941)</ref>

The Angel was already  active by the time of the first Human Torch and Sub-Mariner adventures,<ref>''Marvel Comics'' #1</ref> and active as far back as 1936.<ref>''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]'' Vol. 2, #66</ref> He fights alongside  Namor against World War II "Nazombies",<ref>''The Human Torch'' #5[a] (Summer 1941)</ref> and was later [[retconned]] as a member of both the [[All-Winners Squad]] and the [[V-Battalion]] after the war.<ref>''Citizen V & the V-Battalion: The Everlasting'' #1 (March 2002)</ref>

Holloway remains active as an older character who was revealed as the primary force behind the murderous vigilante group [[Scourges of the Underworld]],<ref name="usagentv1-3">''USAgent'' #3 (Aug. 1993)</ref> which has assassinated a large number of lesser supervillains and archcriminals.  Confronted by [[USAgent]], Angel was wounded during the battle and arrested for his part in the murders of the Scourge of the Underworld. However, due to lack of concrete evidence on USAgent's part, Angel was let go and resumed his normal life.<ref name="usagentv1-4">''USAgent'' #4 (Sept. 1993)</ref><ref>Captain America #442</ref>

===Alternate versions===
An alternate version of the Angel, appears in ''[[X-Men Noir]]'', investigating the death of [[Jean Grey]]. He is depicted as private investigator and the child of the warden of a prison called the Welfare Pen. Thomas' mother died in childbirth - consequently he was brought up in the prison where his father was a warden. There he was instructed by a number of experts, as well as a number of the inmates, which gave him a unique insight into the underworld. He earned his moniker when he saved one of these inmates from the chair. Though he wore a costume like a superhero, he wore no mask to conceal his identity.

The final issue reveals that the Angel identity is shared by twins: the idealistic Tom Halloway and his ruthless brother Robert. Robert sacrifices himself to stop Jean, revealed as having killed [[Rogue (comics)#Marvel Noir|Anne-Marie Rankin]] and taken her place.

Due to continuity differences between Tom's appearance and a previous set of appearances, his brother has been [[retconned]] as one of two men who had assumed the identity of the Angel and substituted for his brother on numerous occasions. In modern times, he was living as a homeless man in and beneath [[Manhattan]], where he was ambushed and murdered by the [[supervillain]] [[Everyman (Marvel Comics)|Zeitgeist]].<ref name="newxmen21">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Mark Gruenwald]] | Penciller =  [[Dave Hoover]] & [[Sandu Florea]] | Inker = [[Dan Bulanadi]] | Story = Broad Stripes And White Stars | Title = Captain America | Issue = 442 | Date = August 1995 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref>  He has also appeared in ''[[The Incredible Hulk]]'' vol. 2, #432-433 (Aug.-Sept. 1995) and in ''[[Marvel Super-Heroes]]'' vol. 3, #7 (Oct. 1991). It is unknown what occurred between the brothers and why Tom's brother ended up homeless.
