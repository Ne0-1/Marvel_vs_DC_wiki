The '''Angel''' ('''Thomas Halloway''') is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], created by writer-artist [[Paul Gustavson]] during what comics fans and historians call the [[Golden Age of comic books]]. He [[first appeared]] in ''[[Marvel Mystery Comics|Marvel Comics]] #1'' (Oct. 1939), the first publication of Marvel predecessor [[Timely Comics]].

The Angel, like [[Batman]], is a non-superpowered detective who nonetheless wore a superhero costume. Gustavson cited [[Leslie Charteris]]' [[pulp magazines|pulp-novel]] detective, [[Simon Templar]], the "Saint", as a model for the Angel.{{fact}}

==Publication history==
The Angel was the next-most-popular Timely character after the "big three" of the [[Human Torch (Golden Age)|Human Torch]], the [[Namor the Sub-Mariner|Sub-Mariner]] and [[Captain America]], with more than 100 Golden Age appearances â€” starting in that initial Marvel title (which changed its name to ''Marvel Mystery Comics'' with issue #2), up through #79 (Dec. 1946); as the sole backup feature in ''Sub-Mariner Comics'' #1-21 (Spring 1941 - Fall 1946); and in occasional appearances in ''[[Mystic (comics)|Mystic Comics]]'' and ''Daring Comics''.

A [[simulacrum]] of the Angel was temporarily created from the mind of [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]], along with those of the [[Blazing Skull]], the [[Fin (comics)|Fin]], the [[Jeffrey Mace|Patriot]], and the Golden Age [[Vision (Golden Age)|Vision]], to aid the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] during the [[Kree-Skrull War]], in ''The Avengers'' vol. 1, #97 (March 1972).

==Fictional character biography==
A costumed detective with no superpowers, the Angel is among the few such heroes to wear no mask, and in his Golden Age appearances makes no effort to conceal his identity as independently wealthy Thomas Halloway, a former surgeon. He later acquires the "mystic cape of Mercury"<ref>Marvel Mystery Comics vol. 1 #11</ref> (the [[mythological]] [[god (male deity)|god]], not Marvel character Mercury a.k.a. [[Makkari (comics)|Makkari]]), which allows him to fly, but he has used this ability only occasionally, as on his a campaign against the foreign spy Cat's Paw.<ref>''Marvel Mystery Comics'' #20 (June 1941)</ref>

The Angel is already being active by the time of the first Human Torch and Sub-Mariner adventures<ref>''Marvel Comics'' #1</ref>, and active as far back as 1936<ref>''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]'' Vol. 2, #66</ref>. He fights alongside alongside Namor against World War II "Nazombies",<ref>''The Human Torch'' #5[a] (Summer 1941)</ref> and was later [[retconned]] as a member of both the [[All-Winners Squad]] and the [[V-Battalion]] during the war.<ref>''Citizen V & the V-Battalion: The Everlasting'' #1 (March 2002)</ref>

Holloway remains active as an older character who was revealed as the primary force behind the murderous vigilante group [[Scourges of the Underworld]]<ref>''[[USAgent]]'' vol. 1, #3 (Aug. 1993)</ref>, which has assassinated a large number of lesser supervillains and archcriminals.  To escape USAgent, he fakes his own death.<ref>''USAgent'' vol. 1, #4 (Sept. 1993)</ref>

Due to continuity differences between Tom's appearance and a previous set of appearances, his brother has been [[retconned]] as one of two men who had assumed the identity of the Angel and substituted for his brother on numerous occasions including fighting [[Stinger (comics)|Stinger]]. In modern times, he was living as a homeless man in and beneath [[Manhattan]], where he was ambushed and murdered by the [[supervillain]] [[Zeitgeist (disambiguation)|Zeitgeist]]<ref>''[[Captain America]]'' vol. 1, #442 (Aug. 1995)</ref>.  He has also appeared in ''[[The Incredible Hulk]]'' vol. 2, #432-433 (Aug.-Sept. 1995) and in ''[[Marvel Super-Heroes]]'' vol. 3, #7 (Oct. 1991). It is unknown what occurred between the brothers and why Tom's brother ended up homeless.
