The Angel is a [[Golden Age of Comics]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], created by writer-artist [[Paul Gustavson]] in ''[[Marvel Mystery Comics|Marvel Comics]] #1'' (Oct. 1939), the first publication of Marvel predecessor [[Timely Comics]]. This character is distinct from Marvel's [[X-Men]] hero [[Archangel (comics)|Archangel]], originally called the Angel and created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] in 1963.

The Angel, like [[Batman]], was a non-superpowered detective who nonetheless wore a superhero costume, though distinctly he wore no mask to conceal his identity as independently wealthy Thomas Halloway. He later received an apparently supernatural ability to fly/glide.

The Angel was the next-most-popular Timely character after the "big three" of the [[Human Torch (Golden Age)|Human Torch]], the [[Sub-Mariner]] and [[Captain America]], with more than 100 Golden Age appearances â€” starting in that initial Marvel comic (which changed its name to ''Marvel Mystery Comics'' with issue #2), up through #79 (Dec. 1946); as the sole backup feature in ''Sub-Mariner Comics'' #1 (Spring 1941) - #21 (Fall 1946) and in occasional appearances in ''Mystic Comics'' and ''Daring Comics''. Gustavson has cited [[Leslie Charteris]]' [[pulp magazines|pulp-novel]] detective, [[Simon Templar]], the "Saint", as a model for the Angel.

The Angel remains active in the [[Marvel universe]] as an older character who was revealed in ''[[USAgent]]'' #3 as the primary force behind the murderous vigilante group [[Scourges of the Underworld]], which had assassinated a large number of lesser supervillains and archcriminals. Due to continuity differences between that appearance and a previous set of appearances, a brother of Thomas Halloway has been [[retconned]] as one of two men who had assumed the identity of The Angel.
