The '''Contemplator''' ('''Tath Ki''') is a [[fictional character]] appearing in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  He is one of the [[Elders of the Universe]], and first appeared in ''[[Marvel Treasury Edition|Marvel Treasury Special]]'' #1 (1976).

==Fictional character biography==
Billions of years ago, the extraterrestrial '''Tath Ki''' was born in the Coal Sack Nebula. Eons ago, he chose to dedicate himself to [[philosophy]], [[meditation]], and developing his [[mind]] and [[spirit]] to plumb the mysteries of the universe. At some point, he was contacted to join the [[Elders of the Universe]], a group consisting of some of the oldest beings in the universe, each member devoted to a specific pursuit or ideal.

Tath Ki first appeared in modern times under the alias "Mister Buda" and took [[Captain America]] on a trip through time to witness important events in America's past and future to teach him about America and himself.<ref>''Marvel Treasury Special 1: Captain America's Bicentennial Battles''</ref> The Contemplator then caused a divergence of an alternate Earth ruled by the android [[Adam II]]. The Contemplator sent the first four Captain Americas (Steve Rogers, [[Spirit of '76 (Marvel Comics)|William Naslund]], [[Jeffrey Mace]], and [[Grand Director|the 1950s Captain America]]) there so that the dying Mace, also known as the World War II hero, the Patriot, could have a second chance at being Captain America and defeating Adam II from assassinating Senator [[John F. Kennedy]].<ref>''Captain America Annual'' #6</ref>

Later, a [[Skrull]] (who was at the time locked in the form of the Contemplator) became involved in the Elders' plot to kill [[Galactus]] in order to cause a new Big Bang event.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3 #4</ref>  The Elders intended to destroy the current universe and usher in a new one where they would all be recreated as individual beings of great power like Galactus.  The fake "Contemplator" met with the [[Kree]] [[Supreme Intelligence]] in an attempt to obtain his [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Gem]]. With the other Elders, he tried to kill Galactus with the Infinity Gems, but was thwarted by the [[Silver Surfer]].<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 3 #7-9</ref> When this plot failed, the Skrull impersonating the Contemplator contacted the alien pirate, Captain [[Reptyl]] in a plot against the Surfer. Reptyl sheltered him from Galactus' vengeance.  Quickly infuriated by him however, Captain Reptyl devoured the faux Tath Ki and left his severed head floating in space as a warning to the pursuing Silver Surfer and [[Nova (Frankie Raye)|Nova]].<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3 #12</ref>

However, the fake remained alive despite the damage,<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3 #20</ref> and in disguise proposed to [[Clumsy Foulup]] that he betray Reptyl and make a pact with the [[Kree]] against the Skrulls.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 3 #25</ref> The "Contemplator" revealed himself to Clumsy Foulup and revealed that he sought to destroy Reptyl and the Skrulls and to conquer the Kree Empire. He arrived on the Kree throne-world in astral form, and used his powers to cause the pink Kree to support Clumsy Foulup.  He took control of the Supreme Intelligence. He was physically attacked by the [[Cotati (comics)|Cotati]], a race of telepathic plants, who defeated in psychic combat and caused him to go mad.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3 #26-27, 29-31</ref>

The cosmic [[Avengers (comics)|Avenger]] [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]] later encountered the true Contemplator who claimed someone was impersonating him.  The Contemplator aided Quasar in accessing a higher dimension called 'The Dimension Of Manifestations' to make contact with the abstract beings of the universe. This enabled Quasar to gain vital information during the [[Infinity War]]. The Contemplator stayed in this dimension after Quasar left. Quasar was concerned about the Contemplator being able to leave again, as it had taken a large output of power for both of them to get to the dimension in the first place. Quasar gave the Contemplator an energy bubble, which would allow him to be tracked if need be. The Contemplator put it in his belly button. 

While exploring the dimension, the Contemplator happened upon a large assembly of cosmic beings in conference with the entity called the [[Beyonder]]. At the rear of the assemblage was the Contemplator's fellow Elder, the [[Gardener (comics)|Gardener]].

Soon after, he finds the area where the [[Magus (comics)|Magus]], the foe of the Infinity War, is creating his evil doubles of all the superheroes. It turns out the Manifestor has other clients also, as such the Magus does not have an unlimited supply. Contemplator uses the energy bubble in his belly button to contact Quasar to convey this information. This distracts Quasar enough for [[Adam Warlock]] to temporarily subdue him.

Quasar eventually finds another group of Elders including the Skrull impersonating the Contemplator.<ref>''Quasar'' #47</ref>  The false Contemplator attempts to steal the quantum-bands and was revealed to everyone as a shape-shifting Skrull. The Skrull Contemplator is last seen being taken into the custody of the Judicator (a true Elder of the Universe dedicated to justice) to face the judgment of the real Contemplator.<ref>''Quasar'' #48</ref>

When the villain [[Superia]] transferred her knowledge back in time to her younger self, using her future knowledge to infiltrate A.I.M. and create a new heroic identity for herself and some chosen allies, she set out to infiltrate the Avengers by removing Captain America from history after his 'death' in the Second World War, essentially supplanting his post-war role. With her new position, she allowed the Avengers to disband and be replaced by her 'Americommandos', who arrested the [[X-Men]] and other mutants, captured 'illegal' superhumans like Luke Cage and Spider-Man, and arranged for the Fantastic Four to be lost in the [[Negative Zone]], forcing [[Henry Pym]], the [[Invisible Woman]], and the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] into retirement, and 'killing' [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] while he was undergoing heart surgery while keeping his brain alive to use his intellect. The Contemplator learned of her actions while tracking the chronal ripples they created, and was able to recruit a 'resistance movement' of time-displaced heirs to Captain America's legacy, including Steve Rogers early in his career, the [[U.S. Agent]] shortly after his own time as Captain America, [[American Dream (comics)|American Dream]], [[Commander A]] from the twenty-fifth century, and the present-day [[Bucky]] to oppose her. Having learned of Superia's plans, Steve merged with one of his later selves when the team was sucked into the Cosmic Cube and arrived at the reality nexus where the removed Captain Americas had been sent, the merger creating a chronal ripple that undid her actions.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

==Powers and abilities==
The Contemplator has spent billions of years channeling the cosmic energy of the [[Power Primordial]] to develop his mind.  He is one of the most powerful telepaths known.  He can contact other minds across vast interstellar distances and in different dimensions. Currently he carries an aspect of power from [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]] that enhances his telepathy. He also has other mental powers such as psychokinesis, mental domination of others, precognition, telekinesis, self-levitation, and astral projection.  He can achieve a meditative state that enables him to become one with the universe, granting him cosmic awareness.  This allows him to know everything about anything in the dimension he is in.  It has been suggested he possesses other vast mental powers, but due to limited appearances and his passive nature these are largely unknown.  He can teleport across galactic distances through the power of his mind and sometimes other dimensions but this ability is limited in scope.<ref name="OHOTMUDE3">''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition'' #3</ref> He also has the ability to channel cosmic energies to increase his physical abilities to superhuman levels.

Like all Elders the Contemplator has been rendered completely immortal due to the Grandmaster's pact with Death, even more so than before.  He is immune to aging, poisons, death, disease.  He can survive in space unaided and does not need food, air, or drink.  If his body were to be destroyed it would either reform or he would survive as an astral spirit.<ref name="OHOTMUDE3"/>

He has spent millions of years teaching himself through his studies of the universe, and thus possesses a vast knowledge and comprehension of the fundamental forces of the universe.
