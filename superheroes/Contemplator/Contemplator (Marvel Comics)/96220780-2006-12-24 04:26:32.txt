'''The Contemplator''' ('''Tath Ki''') is a [[fictional character]] appearing in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  He is one of the [[Elders of the Universe]].

==Fictional character biography==
Very little is known about the extraterrestrial '''Tath Ki'''. Eons ago, he chose to dedicate himself to [[philosophy]], [[mediation]], and developing his [[mind]] and [[spirit]] to plumb the mysteries of the universe. At some point, he was contacted to join the group of the oldest being in the universe, the Elders. 

The Contemplator first appeared under the aliases "Mister Buddha" and aided Captain America.

Later, he became involved in the Elders' plot to destroy [[Galactus]] and, in so doing, recreate the universe.

When this failed due to the involvement of the [[hero]]ic [[Silver Surfer]], the Tath Ki contacted the alien pirate, Captain Rep-tyll in a plot against the Surfer. Quickly infuriated by him, Captain Rep-tyll killed Tath Ki. However, Ki continues to survive in a spirit form.

He attempted to conquer the Kree Empire through a proxy, but was left mentally defeated by the Coati, a race of telepathic plants.  

Its highly possible all of these more aggressive and villainous actions were done by a "false" Contemplator.

The cosmic Avenger Quasar later encountered the "true" Contemplator who claimed someone was impersonating him.  The Contemplator aided Quasar in accessing a higher dimension to make contact with the abstract beings of the universe.  He stayed in this dimension after Quasar left.  Quasar eventually stumbled upon another group of Elders with the "false" Contemplator.  The false Contemplator attempted to steal the quantum-bands and was revealed to be a shape-shifting Skrull.  It is most likely that it was the Skrull who tried to destroy Galactus and take over the Kree Empire.  It was last seen being taken into the custody of the Jundicator to face judgement of the real Contemplator.

==Powers and abilities==

The Contemplator has spent billions of years channeling the [[Power Primordial]] to develop his mind.  He is one of the most powerful telepaths known.  He can contact other minds across vast intersellar distances and in different dimensions.  He also has other mental powers such as telekinesis and astral projection.  He can achieve a meditative state that enables him to become one with the universe.  This allows him to know everything about anything in the dimension he is in.  It has been suggested he possesses other vast mental powers, but due to limited appearances and his passive nature these are largely unknown.  He can teleport across galactic distances through the power of his mind and sometimes other dimensions.

Like all Elders the Contemplator has been rendered completely immortal due to the Grandmaster's pact with Death, even more so then before.  He is immune to ageing, poisons, and disease.  He can survive in space unaided and does not need food, air, or drink.  If his body were to be destroyed it would either reform or he would survive as an astral spirit.
