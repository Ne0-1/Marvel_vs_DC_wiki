'''Ultraman''' is a [[supervillain]] who appears in stories published by [[DC Comics]]. He is the [[evil]] criminal counterpart of [[Superman]]. Ultraman first appeared in ''[[Justice League of America]]'' #29 (Aug. 1964). 

==History==
A differently spelled [[Ultra-Man]] in the [[DC Universe]] is a [[Golden Age of Comics]] [[superhero]] from [[All-American Publications]], source of the original [[Jay Garrick|Flash]], [[Alan Scott|Green Lantern]], and other characters, which merged with [[National Periodical Publications]] in 1946. He appeared in modern times in "The Last Earth-Prime Story", ''[[Superman]]'' #411 (Sept. 1985), in flashback, and in ''Legionnaires Annual'' #3 (1996), in which he helped form a 100th-century [[Legion of Super-Heroes]].

===Pre-Crisis Version===
Ultraman originally hailed from the parallel Earth called "[[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Earth-Three]]", and was a member of the criminal organization the [[Crime Syndicate of Amerika|Crime Syndicate of America]].

Unlike Superman, Ultraman gets stronger every time he is exposed to [[kryptonite]], often developing a completely new superpower each time. In one such encounter, Ultraman acquired the ability to see through dimensional barriers, thus alerting the Crime Syndicate to the existence of alternate Earths in their first appearance. This allowed the Syndicate to attack the Justice League and [[Justice Society of America|Justice Society]]. Ultraman also differed from Superman in that his version of [[Krypton (planet)|Krypton]] hadn't exploded. Where the Kryptonite came from is unknown.

In the early 1980s, Ultraman teamed up with the [[Lex Luthor]] of Earth-One and Earth-Two in an unsuccessful attempt to eliminate the Supermen of Earths-One and -Two. Later, Ultraman joined the rest of the Crime Syndicate in a teamup with a time-traveling villain named [[Per Degaton]] in his attempt to conquer Earth-Two, but this proved unsuccessful as well, and the events were wiped from the [[timeline]] afterwards. The original Ultraman was eliminated in the 1985 12-issue [[limited series]] ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''. Following ''Crisis'' his previous appearances were [[retcon|retconned]] by presenting him as coming from the antimatter universe of [[Qward]], his appearance implying that he came from the world of Qward.

===Post-Crisis Version===
In 1998, the Qwardian version was modified in the story arc ''[[JLA: Earth 2]]''.  The Crime Syndicate is revealed for the first time to the Post-Crisis Justice League by '''Alexander Luthor''', the heroic antimatter counterpart to Lex Luthor. In this current continuity the CSA comes from the Antimatter Universe, each member being the antimatter counterpart to a core League member.  Qward has also been retconned to be the center of the antimatter universe, not the entire universe itself. 

Ultraman was fully rewritten for modern continuity as [[Lieutenant]] [[Clark Kent]], a human [[astronaut]] from the antimatter Earth. After a fiery [[space shuttle]] crash, an unknown alien race reconstructed Kent and in an attempt to repair the damaged astronaut, ended up altering the human both mentally and physically and gave him ultrapowers similar to Superman's superpowers. According to Alexander Luthor, the process  also twisted his mind. In contrast to Superman, Ultraman's power relies on his proximity and exposure to a substance called Anti-Kryptonite; the longer and farther he is separated from it the weaker he becomes. This substance has no apparent effect on Superman. 

Ultraman is married to his Crime Syndicate teammate [[Superwoman#Crime Syndicate of America version|Superwoman]]; at least in the identity of their alter-egos, Clark Kent and [[Lois Lane]]. In the early 2000s, the two had a child together. However, Superwoman maintains a periodic affair with another member of the Crime Syndicate, [[Owlman (comics)|Owlman]], much to Ultraman's frustration.

===One Year Later===
{{spoilers}}
In [[One Year Later]] there are hints that a man controlling [[Kandor]] under the name Kal-El could be Ultraman.  He has been using the help of a group of followers called the "Praisesingers" and the guidance of the "Holy Mother."  [[Supergirl]] and [[Power Girl]] fought his efforts, causing his cult-like following to falter.  The fact that his mother turns out to be [[Legion of Super-Villains|Saturn Queen]], however, suggests a connection to an alternate Superman described in the pages of "Superman/Batman", rather than to Ultraman, although his rantings included a mention to ''[[Owlman (comics)|Owlman]]'' and his need for ''medicines''. It has now been revealed that this Kal-El is indeed Ultraman, who was saved from the Crisis and brainwashed by Saturn Queen, one of the masterminds behind The Absolute Power arc in Superman/Batman. Exactly which version of Ultraman (Earth-Three, anti-matter, or another as-yet-unrevealed version) he is has not yet been explained.
