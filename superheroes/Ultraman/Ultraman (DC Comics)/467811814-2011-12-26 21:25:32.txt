==Publication history==

Ultraman first appeared as the evil counterpart of Superman on the original [[Earth-Three]]. Having created the worlds of [[Earth-One]], containing Silver Age superheroes, as well as [[Earth-Two]], containing the golden age ones, [[DC comics]] decided to expand the universe to include various themed universes. The first of these was Earth-Three, in which there were villainous counterparts of DC's heroes as well as heroic counterparts of DC's villains. The first Ultraman was killed in ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' and Earth-Three was destroyed by an anti-matter storm and then wiped from continuity at the end of the series. This original Earth-Three Ultraman has reappeared briefly both in the 1980s ''[[Animal Man]]'' series and the later ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' mini-series.

Since ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', DC has returned to the concept of Ultraman, creating several different characters with that name, often appearing only for a single story. Two versions of the character have appeared, several times each. The first was an anti-matter version of Ultraman, created for [[Grant Morrison]]'s ''[[JLA: Earth 2]]'' graphic novel. This version has appeared several times and was slain at the conclusion of ''[[Final Crisis]]'' series.  Another version, closer to the Silver Age original Ultraman, appeared on the post-52 universe's Earth-3. Based on comments by Grant Morrison, this Earth-3 universe is not the pre-Crisis Earth-Three, making this a new character unrelated to previous versions.<ref>{{cite web

==Fictional character biography==
===Original Earth-Three Ultraman===
Unlike Superman, the Earth-Three Ultraman gets stronger every time he is exposed to [[kryptonite]], originally developing a completely new superpower with each new exposure. In one such encounter, Ultraman acquired the ability to see through dimensional barriers, thus alerting the Crime Syndicate to the existence of alternate Earths in their first appearance. This allowed the Syndicate to attack the Justice League and [[Justice Society of America|Justice Society]]. Ultraman also differed from Superman in that his version of the planet [[Krypton (planet)|Krypton]] had not exploded. Where the Earth-Three dimension kryptonite originated was never specifically listed in any published book. However, it is implied to be the same as ordinary kryptonite, as Ultraman got powers when exposed to Kryptonite from Earth-1 and Earth-2, gaining heat vision from [[the Flash]] throwing some at him. Being exposed to a large chunk of it paralyzed him, as his superpowers were fighting so much he was unable to control his body. He does not appear to have been affected after this, so perhaps he can reject powers, or they wear off.

In the early 1980s, Ultraman teamed up with [[Lex Luthor]] of Earth-One, and [[Lex Luthor#Alexei Luthor|Alexei Luthor]] of Earth-Two, in an unsuccessful attempt to eliminate the Supermen of both Earth-One and -Two (the Supermen were, in turn, assisted by the heroic [[Alternative versions of Lex Luthor|Alexander Luthor]] of Earth-Three).<ref>
   DC Comics Presents Annual #1 (1981).
</ref> Later, Ultraman joined the rest of the Crime Syndicate in a teamup with a [[time-travel]]ing villain named [[Per Degaton]] who had found their prison and released them. Degaton used them in his attempt to conquer Earth-Two, by stealing nuclear missiles from the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] of [[Earth Prime]], though they planned to betray him. However, this proved unsuccessful as well, and he hurled them into the Future of Earth-1, having made sure this would happen if they touched him, and the events were wiped from the [[Alternate history (fiction)|timeline]] afterwards. The original Ultraman was eliminated in the 1985 12-issue [[limited series]] ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''. Distraught at the fact that his superpowers were useless at the one time he actually needed them, he flew straight into the anti-matter cloud that was destroying Earth-Three, telling the [[Power Ring (DC Comics)|Power Ring]], "I do what I have done all my life. Fight... to the very end!".

After his death, the Pre-''Crisis'' Ultraman showed up in the pages of ''[[Animal Man]]''. There he learned that he was seemingly a comic book character himself, who existed only for the entertainment of others.<ref>''Animal'' Man #24 (June 1990)</ref>  He also fought [[Alternative versions of Superman|Overman]], another pre-''Crisis'' alternate universe version of Superman who had been infected by a [[sexually transmitted disease]], became insane and killed, seemingly for the sake of killing. This Ultraman later faded into the mask of the [[Psycho-Pirate]], who, for a time, was the only one who remembered the [[Pre-Crisis]] [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]].

In ''[[One Year Later]]'' there are hints that a man controlling [[Kandor]], under the name Kal-El, could be Ultraman. He has been using the help of a group of followers called the "Praisesingers" and the guidance of the "Holy Mother". [[Supergirl]] and [[Power Girl]] fight his efforts, causing his cult-like following to falter. This leader also slays several of his own people to keep political information quiet. It has now been revealed that this Kal-El is indeed Ultraman, who was saved from the Crisis and brainwashed by [[Saturn Queen]], his "mother", one of the masterminds behind the "Absolute Power" arc in ''[[Superman/Batman]]''.

An additional incarnation of the Pre-''Crisis'' Earth-Three Ultraman has made appearances most recently in ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' where [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]] wanted to create so-called "perfect beings" out of his models of long-dead father [[Lex Luthor|Alexander Luthor, Sr.]], the lone super-hero of Earth-Three, Superman (both of Earth-One and Earth-Two), [[Wonder Woman]] (of Earth-One and Two) and the Earth-Three Ultraman and Superwoman.

===Clark Kent (Anti-Matter Ultraman)===
In 1999, Ultraman was reintroduced in the ''[[JLA: Earth 2]]'' graphic novel. The [[Crime Syndicate of Amerika]] (CSA) is revealed for the first time to the Justice League by '''Alexander Luthor''', the heroic antimatter counterpart to Lex Luthor. In this current continuity, the CSA comes from the Antimatter Universe, each member being the antimatter counterpart to a core League member.<ref name="dc-crim"/>

Unlike the original pre-''Crisis'' Earth-Three Kryptonian Ultraman, the antimatter Ultraman was fully rewritten for modern continuity as [[Lieutenant]] [[Clark Kent]], a human [[astronaut]] from the antimatter Earth and no longer an alien matching Superman exactly. After his ship imploded into hyperspace, an unknown alien race reconstructed Kent in an attempt to repair the damaged astronaut, which ended up altering the human both mentally and physically, giving him ultrapowers similar to Superman's superpowers. According to Alexander Luthor, the process also twisted Ultraman's mind. In contrast to Superman, Ultraman's power relies on his proximity and exposure to a substance called Anti-Kryptonite; the longer and farther he is separated from it, the weaker he becomes. This substance has repeatedly been shown to have no apparent effect on Superman, as Kryptonite has been shown to have no effect on antimatter Clark Kent's superhuman powers and abilities.<ref name="dc-crim"/>

Antimatter Ultraman is unhappily married to his Crime Syndicate teammate [[Superwoman]]. Their alter-egos are the Antimatter Earth's alternate Clark Kent and [[Lois Lane]]. In the early 2000s, the two had a child together. However, Superwoman maintains a periodic affair with another member of the Crime Syndicate, [[Owlman (comics)|Owlman]], much to Ultraman's frustration. Ultraman would usually fire his eyebeams in between Owlman and Superwoman as a warning when he sees Owlman flirting with Superwoman, although undisclosed photographic blackmail material in Owlman's possession stops Ultraman actually doing anything permanent to him.

Antimatter Clark Kent has been shown to have returned to the Antimatter Earth and again leads the antimatter Crime Syndicate. In an attempt to repair their Earth after the destruction done by the Weaponers of [[Qward]] (which resulted as part of the follow-up to their appearance in the first issue of ''[[JLA/Avengers]]''), The Syndicate was shown to have been kidnapping people from all 52 matter universes as shown in the ''[[Trinity (comic book)|Trinity]]'' series. In ''Trinity'' #13; antimatter Ultraman, Owlman and Superwoman were banished to an alternate subdimension by Superman after Superman defeated Ultraman in a fight. Superman informed Ultraman during the confrontation that Ultraman constantly killing his opponents actually made him weaker than Superman, as he simply eliminated his enemies in his first fight with them as they were still getting used to their powers, while Superman fought them as they continued to get stronger and thus had to improve himself.

In ''Superman Beyond'', the antimatter Ultraman was recruited on a journey to the DC Universe's version of Limbo, along with several other alternate universe Supermen, briefly combining- albeit against his will- with Superman to activate a massive robotic version of themselves to defeat Mandrakk, the dark [[Monitors (comics)|Monitor]], their raw power combining in the robot along with Superman's moral strength and Ultraman's pragmatic ruthlessness. In ''Superman Beyond'' #2, he was shown to have been converted into a vampiric being. In the seventh issue of ''[[Final Crisis]]'', the antimatter Ultraman was apparently slain by the united Supermen alongside his new master, Mandrakk.

===Post Crisis Earth-3 Ultraman===
In ''[[52 (comic book)|52]]'' Week 52, a new version of [[Earth-Three#Alternate versions|Earth-Three]] was shown as one universe amongst the Post-Crisis DC Multiverse. In the depiction was the ''[[Crime Syndicate of America|Crime Society of America]]'', whose members were twisted versions of the original [[Justice Society of America]], including [[Superman]]. The names of the characters and the team are not mentioned in the two panels in which they appear, but this Post-''Crisis'' Earth-3 Ultraman was originally shown to be aged, as he was supposed to be reflected of the aged Superman of Post-''Crisis'' Earth-2. When the Earth-3 Ultraman is shown in later appearances of the Countdown series, he is no longer aged but young. It is unclear if the old Ultraman of ''52'' issue 52 is a separate person or the same one. {{Or|date=June 2009}}. At present this is not clarified.<ref>
{{Comic book reference | title=[[52 (comic book)|52]] | issue=52 | date=May 2, 2007 | publisher=[[DC Comics]] | page=11 | panel=3-4 }}</ref> The name of this Earth-3 team has been revealed to be the ''Crime Society of America''. The Society make their first solo appearance in ''Countdown Presents The Search for [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Ray Palmer]]: Crime Society'' #1 (Origin of Post Crisis Earth-3 Owlmen, Talons, Jokester, who is a heroic Joker) written by [[Sean McKeever]] and illustrated by [[Jamal Igle]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=111900|title = The 52 Exit Interviews: Grant Morrison|accessdate = 2007-05-12|last = Brady|first = Matt|date = 2007-05-08|publisher = Newsarama}}</ref><ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=11396 CCI: DC New World Order - Comic Book Resources] ''..there's a CSA in both the anti-matter universe and on Earth-3 (the former is Grant Morrison's rendition, the latter is a "Golden Age" "Crime Society")''</ref><ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=124897 A QUICK CHECK-IN WITH JAMAL IGLE - NEWSARAMA] ..''"I just finished the Crime Society one-shot,"''Jamal Igle</ref> In subsequent appearances, the Crime Society are agents of [[Monarch (comics)|Monarch's]] Multiversal army. Presently the Post-''Crisis'' Earth-3 Ultraman is missing and presumed dead along with most of the major members of the Post-''Crisis'' Earth-3 Crime Society who joined the Monarch Army.

==In other media==
===Film===
* Ultraman appears in the DC animated film ''[[Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths]]'' voiced by [[Brian Bloom]]. Ultraman is the "Boss of Bosses" in the Crime Syndicate. This version of Ultraman speaks and behaves in a manner similar to a stereotypical Italian-American mobster, and is weakened by blue kryptonite, instead of green (Ultraman destroyed the last piece of blue kryptonite on his Earth, but their Lex Luthor has been visiting other Earths.). Ultraman is known to be ruthless, and has personally targeted the Presidential family, by slapping [[Slade Wilson|The President]], killing the [[First Lady]] (assassinated in her limo, via Heat-Vision), and threatening the [[First Daughter]] [[Rose Wilson|Rose]]. In the end, Ultraman was arrested by the [[marine (military)|Marines]] led by President Wilson, along with the rest of the remaining Crime Syndicate bosses, Power Ring and Superwoman.

===Television===
* [[Tom Welling ]] (who also plays [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent)]] portrays Ultraman in the ''[[Smallville]]'' [[Smallville (season 10)|tenth season]] episode, "Luthor".  The episode depicts a parallel universe (dubbed [[Earth-Two]]) in which the infant Kal-El was discovered by [[Lionel Luthor]], instead of [[Jonathan and Martha Kent]] and named '''Clark Luthor'''. Instead of "The Blur", Clark is known as Ultraman and is seen wearing a T-shirt with the Ultraman symbol. Ultraman markings can also be seen on building walls - similar to the Superman shield Clark Kent leaves in Earth-One. He also bears a large L-shaped [[scar]] on his right arm, which he claims was given to him by Lex Luthor and [[Kryptonite|gold Kryptonite]]. Clark Luthor killed [[Lex Luthor (Smallville)|that universe's Lex Luthor]]. He intended to live at [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent's]] universe, which became true when Clark Kent unwittingly activated his universe's version of a device that allowed interdimensional travel. Clark Luthor approved of Clark Kent universe's Lex for killing Lionel.  In the episode "Kent", Clark Luthor again makes his way to Earth and sends Clark Kent to Earth-Two.  At the end of the Episode, Clark Kent makes his way back to Earth-One, and confronts and lures Clark Luthor back to the Fortress of Solitude.  Given Kent's speech to Luthor, followed by Luthor being taken to Earth-Two's Fortress, followed by Earth-Two's Jor-El saying, "Welcome Home, Son", it implies the possibility of redemption for Clark Luthor in his own dimension.
