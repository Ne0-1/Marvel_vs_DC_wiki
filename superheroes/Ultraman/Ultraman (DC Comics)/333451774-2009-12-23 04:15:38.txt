==Publication history==

Ultraman first appeared as the evil counterpart of Superman on the original [[Earth-Three]].  Having created the worlds of [[Earth-One]], containing silver age superheroes, as well as [[Earth-Two]], containing the golden age ones, DC comics decided to expand the universe to include various themed universes.  The first of these was Earth-Three, in which there were villainous counterparts of DC's heroes as well as heroic counterparts of DC's villains.  The first Ultraman was killed in [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]] and Earth-Three was destroyed by an anti-matter storm and then wiped from continuity at the end of the series.  This original Earth-Three Ultraman has reappeared briefly both in the meta-comic [[Animal Man]] and in [[Infinite Crisis]].

Since Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC has returned to the concept of Ultraman, creating several different characters with that name, often appearing only for a single story.  Two versions of the character have appeared several times each.  The first was an anti-matter version of Ultraman, created for Grant Morrison's [[JLA: Earth 2]] comic.  This version has appeared several times and was slain at the conclusion of [[Final Crisis]].  The second was a very similar version to the original Ultraman who appeared on the post-52 universe's Earth-3.  Based on comments by [[Grant Morrison]], this alternate universe is not the pre-Crisis Earth-Three, making this a new character unrelated to previous versions.<ref>{{cite web

==Fictional character biography==
===Jur-Ll (Original Earth-Three Ultraman)===
Born as the son of Jur-Ll (versus Superman's father, Jor-EL) in the Pre-Crisis reality termed "[[Earth-Three]]", Ultraman was the Kryptonian who grew up on the reversed Earth of that reality, and later as an adult became a member of the criminal organization the [[Crime Syndicate of America|Crime Syndicate of America]]. Unlike Superman, the Earth-Three Ultraman gets stronger every time he is exposed to [[kryptonite]], originally developing a completely new superpower with each new exposure. In one such encounter, Ultraman acquired the ability to see through dimensional barriers, thus alerting the Crime Syndicate to the existence of alternate Earths in their first appearance. This allowed the Syndicate to attack the Justice League and [[Justice Society of America|Justice Society]].  Ultraman also differed from Superman in that his version of [[Krypton (planet)|Krypton]] had not exploded. Where the Kryptonite came from is unknown.

In the early 1980s, Ultraman teamed up with [[Lex Luthor]] of Earth-One and [[Lex Luthor#Alexei Luthor|Alexei Luthor]] of Earth-Two in an unsuccessful attempt to eliminate the Supermen of Earths-One and -Two (the Supermen were, in turn, assisted by the heroic [[Alternate versions of Lex Luthor|Alexander Luthor]] of Earth-Three). Later, Ultraman joined the rest of the Crime Syndicate in a teamup with a time-traveling villain named [[Per Degaton]] in his attempt to conquer Earth-Two, but this proved unsuccessful as well, and the events were wiped from the [[Alternate history (fiction)|timeline]] afterwards. The original Ultraman was eliminated in the 1985 12-issue [[limited series]] ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''. Distraught at the fact that his superpowers were useless at the one time he actually needed them, he flew straight into the anti-matter cloud that was destroying Earth-Three, telling [[Power Ring (DC Comics)|Power Ring]] "I do what I have done all my life. Fight... to the very end!".

After his death, the Pre-Crisis Ultraman showed up in the pages of [[Animal Man]]. There he learned that he was seemingly a comic book character himself, who existed only for the entertainment of others.  He also fought Overman, another pre-Crisis alternate universe version of Superman who had been infected by an STI, became insane and killed, seemingly for the sake of killing. This Ultraman later faded into the mask of the [[Psycho-Pirate]], who, for a time, was the only one who remembered the Pre-Crisis multiverse.

An additional incarnation of the Pre-Crisis Earth-Three Ultraman have made appearances most recently in [[Infinite Crisis]] where Alexander Luthor, Jr. wanted to create so called perfect beings out of his models of long dead father Alexander Luthor, Sr. the lone super-hero of Earth-Three, Superman (both of Earth-One and Earth-Two), Wonder Woman (of Earth-One and Two) and the Earth-Three Ultraman and Superwoman.

===Clark Kent (Anti-Matter Ultraman)===
In 1998, Ultraman was reintroduced in the story arc ''[[JLA: Earth 2]]''. The Crime Syndicate of Amerika is revealed for the first time to the Justice League by '''Alexander Luthor''', the heroic antimatter counterpart to Lex Luthor. In this current continuity the CSA comes from the Antimatter Universe, each member being the antimatter counterpart to a core League member.<ref name="dc-crim"/>

Unlike the original Pre-Crisis Earth-Three dimensional Kryptonian Ultraman, the antimatter Ultraman was fully rewritten for modern continuity as [[Lieutenant]] [[Clark Kent]], a human [[astronaut]] from the antimatter Earth and no longer an alien matching Superman exactly. After a fiery [[space shuttle]] crash, an unknown alien race reconstructed Kent in an attempt to repair the damaged astronaut, which ended up altering the human both mentally and physically, giving him ultrapowers similar to Superman's superpowers.  According to Alexander Luthor, the process also twisted Ultraman's mind. In contrast to Superman, Ultraman's power relies on his proximity and exposure to a substance called Anti-Kryptonite; the longer and farther he is separated from it the weaker he becomes. This substance has repeatedly been shown to have no apparent effect on Superman as Kryptonite has been shown to have no effect on antimatter Clark Kent's superhuman powers and abilities.<ref name="dc-crim"/>

Antimatter Ultraman is unhappily married to his Crime Syndicate teammate [[Superwoman]]. Their alter-egos are the Antimatter Earth's alternate Clark Kent and [[Lois Lane]]. In the early 2000s, the two had a child together. However, Superwoman maintains a periodic affair with another member of the Crime Syndicate, [[Owlman (comics)|Owlman]], much to Ultraman's frustration. Ultraman would usually fire his eyebeams in between Owlman and Superwoman as a warning when he sees Owlman flirting with Superwoman.

Antimatter Clark Kent has been shown to have returned to the Antimatter Earth and again leads the antimatter Crime Syndicate. In an attempt to repair their Earth after the destruction done by the Weaponers of [[Qward]] (which resulted as part of the follow-up to their appearance in the first issue of ''[[JLA/Avengers]]''), The Syndicate was shown to have been kidnapping people from all 52 matter universes as shown in the ''[[Trinity (comic book)|Trinity]]'' series. In Trinity #13; antimatter Ultraman, Owlman and Superwoman were banished to an alternate subdimension by Superman.

According to the events of "Final Crisis - Superman Beyond", antimatter Ultraman was shown to be in the DC Universe's version of Limbo, along with several other alternate universe Supermen. At the end of this adventure, he was shown to have been converted into a vampiric being. In the seventh issue of [[Final Crisis]], he was slain by the [[Green Lantern Corps]] alongside his new master, Mandrakk the dark [[Monitors (comics)|Monitor]].

===Post Crisis Earth-3 Ultraman===
In ''[[52 (comic book)|52]]'' Week 52, a new version of [[Earth-Three#Alternate versions|Earth-Three]] was shown as one universe amongst the Post-Crisis DC Multiverse. In the depiction was the ''[[Crime Syndicate of America|Crime Society of America]]'' whose members were twisted versions of the original [[Justice Society of America]], including [[Superman]]. The names of the characters and the team are not mentioned in the two panels in which they appear, but this Post Crisis Earth-3 Ultraman was originally shown to be aged as he was supposed to be reflected of the aged Superman of Post Crisis Earth-2. When the Earth-3 Ultraman is shown in later appearances of the Countdown series he is no longer aged but young. It is unclear if the old Ultraman of 52 issue 52 is a separate person or the same one. {{Or|date=June 2009}}. At present this is not clarified.<ref>
{{Comic book reference | title=[[52 (comic book)|52]] | issue=52 | date=May 2, 2007 | publisher=[[DC Comics]] | page=11 | panel=3-4 }}</ref> The name of this Earth-3 team has been revealed to be the ''Crime Society of America''. The Society make their first solo appearance in ''Countdown Presents The Search for [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Ray Palmer]]: Crime Society'' #1 (Origin of Post Crisis Earth-3 Owlmen, Talons, Jokester, who is a heroic Joker) written by [[Sean McKeever]] and illustrated by [[Jamal Igle]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=111900|title = The 52 Exit Interviews: Grant Morrison|accessdate = 2007-05-12|last = Brady|first = Matt|date = 2007-05-08|publisher = Newsarama}}</ref><ref>http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=11396 ''..there's a CSA in both the anti-matter universe and on Earth-3 (the former is Grant Morrison's rendition, the latter is a "Golden Age" "Crime Society")''</ref><ref>http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=124897..''"I just finished the Crime Society one-shot,"''Jamal Igle</ref> In subsequent appearances, the Crime Society are agents of [[Monarch (comics)|Monarch's]] Multiversal army. Presently the Post Crisis Earth-3 Ultraman is missing and presumed dead along with most of the major members of the Post Crisis Earth-3 Crime Society who joined the Monarch Army.

==Other versions==
===Antimatter Qward Ultraman===
There was a minor Qward based Ultraman shown after the Crisis on Infinite Earths, who was able to be identified as separate from the Earth-Three Ultraman due to his enlarged eyes.  This Qward Ultraman appeared only one time and has never been seen again.

===Deformed Ultraman===
As published in "Brave and the Bold 11 and 12" A specific Green Kryptonite powered antimatter Ultraman wearing the costume and many other similarities to the post-52 Earth-3 Ultraman, appeared recently in ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' #11. After masquerading briefly as Clark Kent on New Earth, this Green K powered antimatter Ultraman decided to battle Superman until stopped by '''Mixyezpitelik''', Ultraman's virtuous adversary and counterpart to [[Mister Mxyzptlk]], who had decided to enlist both Superman and Ultraman in a confrontation with their common enemy - a being known only as Megistus.<ref>''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' #11; Ultraman is specifically referred to as residing in the Anti-Matter Universe</ref> This Ultraman was severely deformed at the end of the adventure. It was unclear if he recovered from his changed state at the end of this adventure when he returned to his source Earth.  Nothing else has been revealed about this specific character thus far.

===One Year Later===
In [[One Year Later]] there are hints that a man controlling [[Kandor]] under the name Kal-El could be Ultraman. He has been using the help of a group of followers called the "Praisesingers" and the guidance of the "Holy Mother." [[Supergirl]] and [[Power Girl]] fight his efforts, causing his cult-like following to falter. This leader also slays several of his own people to keep political information quiet. It has now been revealed that this Kal-El is indeed Ultraman, who was saved from the Crisis and brainwashed by [[Saturn Queen]], his "mother", one of the masterminds behind the "Absolute Power" arc in ''Superman/Batman''.

However, after the Kandor residing in the fortress was revealed as a fake (in ''Superman'' #670), it was destroyed and its various citizens exiled.

==In other media==
