'''Ultraman''' is a [[supervillain]] who appears in stories published by [[DC Comics]]. He is the [[evil]] criminal counterpart of Superman. Ultraman first appeared in ''[[Justice League of America]]'' #29 in [[1964]]. 

Ultraman originally hailed from the parallel Earth called "[[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Earth-Three]]"; in current comics, as told in ''[[JLA: Earth 2]]'', he comes from an alternate Earth in an [[antimatter]] universe. Ultraman is a member of the criminal organization the [[Crime Syndicate of America]].

Unlike Superman, Ultraman gets stronger every time he is exposed to [[kryptonite]], often developing a completely new superpower each time. In one such encounter, Ultraman acquired the ability to see through dimensional barriers, thus alerting the Crime Syndicate to the existence of alternate Earths in their first appearance. This allowed the Syndicate to attack the Justice League and [[Justice Society of America|Justice Society]]. Ultraman also differed from Superman in that his version of [[Krypton (planet)|Krypton]] hadn't exploded.

In the early [[1980s]], Ultraman teamed up with the [[Lex Luthor]] of Earth-One and Earth-Two in an unsuccessful attempt to eliminate the Supermen of Earths-One and -Two. Later, Ultraman joined the rest of the Crime Syndicate in a teamup with a time-traveling villain named [[Per Degaton]] in his attempt to conquer Earth-Two, but this proved unsuccessful as well, and the events were wiped from the [[timeline]] afterwards.

The original Ultraman was eliminated in the [[1985]] miniseries ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''. Following ''Crisis'', his previous appearances were [[retcon|retconned]] by presenting him as coming from the antimatter universe of [[Qward]], his appearance implying that he came from the world of Qward. In the late [[1990s]], the Qwardian version was modified, with Ultraman fully rewritten for modern continuity as [[Lieutenant]] [[Clark Kent]], a human [[astronaut]] from the antimatter universe's version of Earth. After a fiery [[space shuttle]] crash, aliens (probably Qwardian versions of Kryptonians) had reconstructed Kent, and given him superpowers similar to Superman's. However, according to the [[Lex Luthor]] of Ultraman's Earth, the process twisted his mind. In contrast to Superman, Ultraman's power relies on his proximity and exposure to a substance called Anti-Kryptonite; the longer and farther he is separated from it, the weaker he becomes. This substance has no apparent effect on Superman. 

Ultraman is married to his Crime Syndicate teammate [[Superwoman]]-at least in the identity of their alter-egos, Clark Kent and [[Lois Lane]]. In the early [[2000s]], the two had a child together. However, Superwoman maintains a periodic affair with another member of the Crime Syndicate, [[Owlman (comics)|Owlman]], much to Ultraman's frustration.
