'''Ultraman''' is the evil criminal counterpart of Superman.  He hails from [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Earth-Three]] and is a member of the criminal organization, the [[Crime Syndicate of America]]. 

Unlike Superman, Ultraman gets stronger every time he is exposed to [[kryptonite]], often developing a completely new superpower each time.  (In one such encounter, Ultraman acquired the ability to see through dimensional barriers, thus alerting the Crime Syndicate to the existence of alternate Earths, ripe for conquering and plunder.)

Prior to ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' (in which Ultraman and the rest of the Crime Syndicate were wiped out), Ultraman is said to be an alien, referring to his Earth as "my adopted planet" while he tries in vain to save it from destruction during the Crisis.  When Ultraman was re-introduced into DC Comics continuity after the Crisis, he became a human astronaut, reconstructed (presumably by aliens) after a fiery shuttle crash.
