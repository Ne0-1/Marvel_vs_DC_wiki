'''Hawkeye''' ('''Clint Barton'''), also known as '''Ronin''' and '''Goliath''', is a [[fiction]]al [[character (arts)|character]] that appears in the [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appeared in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #57 (Sept. 1964) and was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Don Heck]].

==Publication history==
Hawkeye was introduced as a reluctant villain in ''Tales of Suspense'' #57 (September 1964), and after two more brief appearances in ''Tales of Suspense'' #60 and 64 (December 1964 and April 1965), joined the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] #16 (May 1965). Hawkeye was a perennial member, and has appeared in three volumes. 

Hawkeye featured in two four-issue miniseries, published in 1983 and 1994 respectively. The first was written by [[Mark Gruenwald]] and the second by [[Chuck Dixon]]. This was followed by a one-shot publication, ''Hawkeye: Earth's Mightiest Marksman'' (1998), written by [[Tom DeFalco]] and penciled by [[Jeff Johnson (comics)|Jeff Johnson]]. In 2003 there was an attempt at an ongoing series written by [[Fabian Nicieza]], but the title was canceled after only eight issues.

Hawkeye featured prominently in the'' [[West Coast Avengers]]'' limited series — #1–4 (September 1984 – December 1984) — before appearing in the ongoing title, which ran for 102 issues (including 8 annuals) from October 1985 - January 1994. The title was renamed "Avengers West Coast" from #46 (Aug. 1989). Hawkeye also starred concurrently in almost every issue of ''Solo Avengers'' which ran for 40 issues from December 1987 – January 1991 (the title was renamed ''Avengers Spotlight'' from #21 (August 1989).

From 1998, Hawkeye featured significantly in issues #20–70 of the title ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'', written by [[Kurt Busiek]] and Fabian Nicieza.

==Biography==
Clint Barton was an orphan, and ran away from the orphanage as a pre-teen to join the [[circus]] as a carnival performer, where he was trained in the use of the bow and arrow by the [[Swordsman (comics)#Jacques Duquesne|Swordsman]] and [[Trick Shot (comics)|Trickshot]].<ref>Seen in flashback in ''Solo Avengers'' #1 - 5 (Dec. 1987 - Apr. 1988)</ref> When he discovered that his mentors were both criminals he rejected them, leading to a beating by Swordsman which left Barton badly injured and hospitalized. Years later, he saw [[Iron Man]] in action, and was inspired and decided to become a costumed hero called '''Hawkeye'''. However, there is a misunderstanding on Hawkeye's first outing and he is believed to be a criminal, accused of theft.

On the run, the naive Hawkeye meets the [[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]], a spy for the [[Soviet Union]], whom he falls in love with. She tricks him into helping her to steal technology developed by [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]], Iron Man's alter ego. After several battles with Iron Man — who defeats the pair on every occasion — the Black Widow is injured and Hawkeye flees with her, deciding to go "straight" from then on.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #57 (1964), #60 + 64 (Dec. 1964 and Apr. 1965)</ref> Hawkeye later "applies" for membership in the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], by breaking into [[Avengers Mansion]] and binding and gagging the team's butler, [[Edwin Jarvis]]. Hawkeye is accepted, and together with leader [[Captain America]] and mutant siblings [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and the [[Scarlet Witch]] become the new team when the original members take a leave of absence.<ref>''Avengers'' #16 (May 1965)</ref>

===Avenging Archer and Giant===
Hawkeye remains a constant in the team for many years, and when his bow breaks at a crucial moment decides to use [[Henry Pym|Pym particles]] to become the second [[Goliath (comics)|Goliath]].<ref>''Avengers'' #63 (Apr. 1969)</ref> During this time, Barton suffers a personal setback as his brother Barney is killed by the villain [[Egghead (comics)|Egghead]], whom Goliath brings to justice.<ref>''Avengers'' #64-65 (May - Apr 1969)</ref> At the conclusion of the [[Kree-Skrull War]] Barton resumes the identity of Hawkeye in a new costume, and after a rift with teammate the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)#Silver Age|Vision]] over the affections of the [[Scarlet Witch]], he resumes his old costume and resigns from the team.<ref>''Avengers'' #109 (Mar. 1973)</ref> On a whim Hawkeye returns to the Black Widow and briefly battles her current love, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #99 (May 1973)</ref> Hawkeye then assists the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] against the monster [[Zzzax]],<ref>''Hulk'' #166 (Aug. 1973)</ref> and then follows the Hulk back to the [[Sanctum Sanctorum|mansion]] of [[Doctor Strange]], where after a skirmish Hawkeye joins the "non-team" the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] for a short period.<ref>''Defenders'' #7 - 10 ( Aug. - Nov. 1973)</ref>

Hawkeye then drifts for a time, returning briefly to the Avengers to attend the wedding of the Vision and the Scarlet Witch.<ref>''Giant-Size Avengers'' #4 (Jun. 1975)</ref> Together with the [[Two-Gun Kid]] and [[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]], Hawkeye defeats the monster the Manticore<ref>''Ghost Rider'' #27 (Dec. 1977)</ref> before returning to the Avengers to assist when members of the team begin to mysteriously disappear.<ref>''Avengers'' #172 (Jun. 1978)</ref> The remaining Avengers discover it to be the work of the [[Collector (comics)|Collector]] of the [[Elders of the Universe]].  After his teammates are all captured, Hawkeye single-handedly defeats the Collector,<ref>''Avengers'' #174 (Aug. 1978)</ref> and joins the team for the final battle against [[Korvac]].<ref>''Avengers'' #175 - 177 (Sep - Nov 1978)</ref> Hawkeye's victory is dashed when the Avengers new government liaison [[Henry Peter Gyrich]], limits the roster and replaces him with the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], in an attempt to make the team more "politically acceptable".  After initially failing to find work in his civilian identity, he successfully applies for work at [[Cross Technological Enterprises]] as Hawkeye, and then battles the [[Shi'ar]] villain [[Deathbird]].<ref>''Avengers'' #189 (Nov. 1979)</ref> Hawkeye returns to Avengers mansion several months later for a brief visit "induced" by the heroine [[Moondragon]]<ref>''Avengers'' #211 (Sep. 1981)</ref> before rejoining for a sustained period.<ref>''Avengers'' #222 (Jul. 1982)</ref> It is at this time that Hawkeye inadvertently avenges the death of his brother.

The weapon is an energy pistol and explodes, killing Egghead instantly.<ref>''Avengers'' #229 (Mar. 1983)</ref>

Hawkeye then meets former [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent Barbara "Bobbi" Morse, codenamed [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]]. She is investigating the company Cross Technological Enterprises, which employs Hawkeye as a security consultant. The company is revealed to be owned by the villain [[Crossfire (comics)|Crossfire]], who plans to use an aggression-inducing sonic wave against all of New York's superheroes.

Hawkeye and Mockingbird fall in love and elope immediately after.<ref>''Hawkeye'' #1 - 4 (Sep. - Dec (1983)</ref>

At the direction of then-Avengers chair Vision, Hawkeye and Mockingbird establish the team the [[West Coast Avengers]].
