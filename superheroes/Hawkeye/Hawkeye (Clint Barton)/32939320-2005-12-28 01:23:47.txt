'''Hawkeye''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]]ic [[archery|archer]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  He is a prominent member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], led the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], and founded the [[West Coast Avengers]]. For a brief time, he gave up his Hawkeye identity to succeed [[Henry Pym]] as the size-changing superhero '''Goliath'''.

==Character History==
Hawkeye, whose real name is Clinton "Clint" Francis Barton, was a [[Circus (performing art)|circus]] performer who worked alongside, and was trained by, the [[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]] and [[Trickshot (comics)|Trickshot]].  He eventually turned to petty crime to make ends meet; during this time, he met and became enthralled by the [[Black Widow (comics)|Black Widow]], who was at the time a spy for the [[Soviet Union]].  He completed several criminal acts on her behalf, until he learned that she was a spy and saboteur.  [[Iron Man]] defeated him, but let him go, as he recognized the archer's capacity for heroism.  [[Captain America]] subsequently recruited Hawkeye into the Avengers, where he served alongside Cap, [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and the [[Scarlet Witch]] as "Cap's Kooky Quartet".  Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch, like himself, had also initially been [[supervillain]]s until realizing the error of their prior actions.  Hawkeye would remain with the Avengers for many years, often butting heads with the team's leaders' when not leading a branch of the team himself.  At several points in time (notably the [[Kree-Skrull War]] and [[Operation: Galactic Storm]]), he would temporarily adopt teammate [[Henry Pym|Hank Pym]]'s former powers and codename of '''Goliath''', gaining the ability to increase his body to a massive size.

Although Hawkeye was enamored of the Witch, she eventually married their teammate, the [[Vision (comics)|Vision]].  During a later solo adventure, Hawkeye met the former government agent Bobbi Morse, alias [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]]; the two had a whirlwind romance and were married shortly thereafter.  They subsequently founded the [[West Coast Avengers]], and served as two of the most prominent members of that team.  They founded the much less prominent [[Great Lakes Avengers]] team when the rest of the West Coast team was unavailable.  After Mockingbird was killed by the [[demon]] [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] and the West Coast team disbanded, Hawkeye left the superhero career for a time.  He returned to the Avengers shortly prior to the battle with [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]], after which the Avengers (including Hawkeye) were presumed deceased for a time.  In actuality, they were revived in a [[pocket dimension]] created by [[Franklin Richards]] for the events of "[[Heroes Reborn]]", and returned to [[Earth-616]] during "[[Heroes Return]]".

Shortly after Hawkeye's return, he quit the Avengers, giving his spot in their roster to [[Justice (comics)|Justice]] and [[Firestar]].  He then became affiliated with the Thunderbolts, a group of former [[supervillain]]s who had apparently turned over a new leaf by battling menaces such as [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]].  He joined the team as their ''de facto'' leader and mentor, ultimately helping several members obtain pardons for their past crimes.  During one adventure, [[Hellstorm]] sent them to Mephisto's [[Purgatory]], where they attempted to rescue Mockingbird's soul but instead returned [[Hellcat (comics)|Hellcat]] to the land of the living.  Hawkeye later entered a romantic relationship with his teammate, [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]].

After the Thunderbolts defeated the [[Scourge (comics)|Scourge]] and [[Henry Peter Gyrich]], both of whom were under [[Baron Strucker]]'s domination, the Thunderbolts were offered a full pardon for their actions under two conditions: Hawkeye turn himself in for incarceration, and the other Thunderbolts retire permanently.  They accepted, and Hawkeye went to prison, but later helped [[SHIELD]] by infiltrating a jailbreak that was led by [[Mentallo]] at the behest of [[Justin Hammer]].  Meanwhile, half of the Thunderbolts were teleported by Graviton to [[Counter-Earth (comics)|Counter-Earth]] (the "Heroes Reborn" world, now in orbit around the Sun opposite the Earth).  Hawkeye led the remaining Thunderbolts, plus several of the escaped criminals and some former members of the [[Crimson Cowl]]'s new [[Masters of Evil]] team, to form a new Thunderbolts team.  Once this team was reunited with the lost members, they together defeated the Crimson Cowl, but several Thunderbolts were returned to government custody for violating the terms of their pardon.  Hawkeye then left the team and rejoined the Avengers, giving [[Baron Zemo]] the opportunity to assume leadership of the Thunderbolts.  After the next meeting between the Avengers and Thunderbolts, the Thunderbolts were again disbanded, although this would again prove temporary.

{{spoiler}}

During the [[Avengers Disassembled]] storyline, the Scarlet Witch went insane over the loss of her children with the Vision and used her reality-manipulation powers to create deadly threats to her teammates.  Hawkeye apparently died during this storyline, sacrificing himself to destroy a [[Kree]] starship in ''Avengers'' #502.  However, during the ''[[House of M]]'' miniseries, he showed up alive once more in the Scarlet Witch's mutant-dominated altered reality, with no memory of the previous reality. When a young mutant gave several of the heroes the ability to remember the way the world once was, Hawkeye and the others were horrified at what the Scarlet Witch had done. When the heroes confronted the Witch and her children (who were real and had similar powers to their mother's in this reality), Hawkeye broke rank, shooting her in the back (although it did her no harm), and demanding to know why she had killed him, as he was her friend and had only love for her. One of the Witch's children, annoyed, made Hawkeye vanish into nothingness with a thought. At present his fate is ambiguous; House of M #8 depicted several heroes arriving at the ruined Avengers mansion, after a report that someone had been there, only to find Hawkeye's costume and a newspaper cutting about his death, pinned to the ruins by Hawkeye's trademark purple arrows. 

==Powers and abilities==
Hawkeye has no superhuman powers.  However, he has exceptionally athletic strength, endurance, and stamina.  His reflexes and agility represent the absolute pinnacle of human perfection.  He is capable of acrobatic maneuvers that would put an olympic gold medalist to shame.  His accuracy as an archer is virtually unerring.  He is also a highly competent strategist, tactician, and field commander.  He is an exceptional hand-to-hand combatant having been trained by [[Captain America]].

In the [[Ultimate Marvel Universe]], ''Ultimate Hawkeye'' is a member of the Ultimate version of the Avengers, the [[Ultimates]], where he is the partner of the Ultimate version of the Black Widow.  The Ultimate versions of these characters are much more ready to use lethal force than are their normal Marvel Universe counterparts.  

{{Spoiler}}
===Ultimates===
Clint Barton lives with his girlfriend in a [[domestic partnership]]. He calls her and their children and says goodbye to them before every mission, because one day it will be his last mission.

Hawkeye and Black Widow led a team of black ops S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel to destroy a sleeper colony of Chitauri agents operating out of two New York City office buildings; when the mission went sideways, all but Hawkeye, Widow, and two or three personnel died in the chaos.

Hawkeye was at the Air Force base in New Mexico to fight the Chitauri, and was wounded when Wasp's radio call distracted him. Despite the injury, he was able to fire the anti-Hulk-serum arrow at the rampaging Hulk after he had brought down the Chitauri mothership.

===Ultimates 2===
In issue #7 of volume 2, Hawkeye's home was invaded and his family was murdered.  The issue ended with the implication that Hawkeye was about to be killed as well, though in the next issue his body was missing.  The killers were not revealed. In issue #8, members of S.H.I.E.L.D. see what seems to be Captain America on the video that shows the killing of Hawkeye and his family. Nick Fury sends a team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents to hunt down and ultimately kill Captain America, although it has not been proven that he was the traitor.

However, at the beginning of issue #9, it was revealed that Hawkeye was not killed, but had been kidnapped and is held in an unknown location.  After regaining consciousness, Hawkeye learned that over the previous three days, he had been drugged, presumably tortured, and the security codes to the Triskelion were ripped from his mind.

==Animated Series==
Hawkeye was also a regular character on the ''Avengers'' and ''Iron Man''.
