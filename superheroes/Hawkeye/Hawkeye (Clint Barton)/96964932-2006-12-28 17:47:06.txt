'''Hawkeye''' ('''Clint Barton''') is a [[fictional]] [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]], a longtime member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Don Heck]], he first appeared in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #57 ([[1964#September|September 1964]]).

Like [[DC Comics]]’ [[Green Arrow]], Hawkeye is a costumed [[archery|archer]], possessing a variety of specialized arrows. Brash and somewhat cocky, he has often butted heads with teammates but has been a member of some segment of the Avengers fairly consistently since 1965. He also led the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], attempting to guide the former [[supervillain|villains]] to become heroes. 

He was also a regular character on the short-lived [[1990s]] [[animated series]] ''[[Iron Man (TV series)|Iron Man]]'' and ''[[The Avengers: United We Stand]].''

==Character history==
Hawkeye, whose real name is Clinton "Clint" Francis Barton, ran away from an orphanage as a pre-teen to join the  [[Circus (performing art)|circus]] as a performer, where he was trained by the [[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]] and [[Trick Shot (comics)|Trickshot]]. He decided to become a costumed hero after being inspired by seeing Iron Man in action, but his first attempts were less than successful; he stopped an armed group of jewelry store robbers only to be mistaken by police as the thief himself. On the run from police, he met and became enthralled by the [[Black Widow (comics)|Black Widow]], who was a spy for the [[Soviet Union]]. The Black Widow's main mission at that time was to steal Stark-developed technology to turn over to her handlers, and she was able to convince the besotted Hawkeye that she was working in the interests of international peace. The pair tangled with Iron Man twice, being defeated (barely) both times. When Hawkeye finally learned the Black Widow's true mission (to steal the technology and destroy Iron Man) he refused to betray his country for her, but was persuaded to help her one last time. When the Black Widow was injured during the last fight, Hawkeye broke off his attack on Iron Man to help her, choosing to withdraw rather than kill Iron Man.

===Avengers membership===
Eventually Hawkeye applied for membership in the Avengers (by breaking into the Avengers Mansion and announcing that he wanted to be a part of the group) and was accepted. He served alongside [[Captain America]], [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and the [[Scarlet Witch]] as "the New Avengers", or occasionally as "Cap's Kooky Quartet". Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch had also initially been [[supervillain]]s until realizing the error of their prior actions. Although Hawkeye wanted the Black Widow to join the Avengers with him, several other Avengers were resistant to the idea, given her Cold War spy past, and Black Widow's increasing involvement with S.H.I.E.L.D. also created tension between the pair, finally resulting in a split.

Hawkeye would remain with the Avengers for many years and roster changes, often butting heads with the team's leaders when not leading a branch of the team himself. At several points in time (notably the [[Kree-Skrull War]] and [[Operation: Galactic Storm]]), he would temporarily adopt teammate [[Henry Pym|Hank Pym]]'s former powers and codename of '''Goliath''', gaining the ability to increase his body to a massive size.

Although Hawkeye was enamored of the Scarlet Witch, she eventually married their teammate, the [[Vision (comics)|Vision]]. During a later solo adventure, Hawkeye met the former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Barbara "Bobbi" Morse, alias [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]] while she was investigating Cross Technologies, Hawkeye's "employer" at the time. Unknown to Hawkeye, Cross was run by the villain [[Crossfire (comics)|Crossfire]], who had a plan to use an aggression-inducing sonic wave against all of New York's superheroes. Crossfire captured the snooping Hawkeye and Mockingbird and tested the sonic wave on them, causing them to fight each other. Hawkeye used a sonic ray arrowhead, hidden in his mouth, to cancel out the sonic waves, freeing himself from the wave's control but ruining his hearing in the process. After defeating Crossfire, Hawkeye and Mockingbird eloped.

===West Coast Avengers===
Under the direction of then-Avengers chair The Vision, Hawkeye and Mockingbird subsequently founded the [[West Coast Avengers]] and served as two of the most prominent members of that team. The husband-and-wife duo had a rocky relationship caused by a falling-out over the issue of killing - during a time travel adventure, Mockingbird was drugged into forgetting about Hawkeye and into believing she was in love with the western anti-hero known as the [[Phantom Rider]]. When she was free of the drug's influence she fought the Phantom Rider and allowed him to fall to his death, refusing the chance to save him. When the details were finally revealed, the couple split. During a temporary reconciliation, they also briefly served with the much less prominent and unofficial [[Great Lakes Avengers]] team. 

While a member of the West Coast Avengers, Hawkeye found his leadership usurped by other experienced heroes such as [[Dr. Pym]] and [[USAgent]].  His personality clashes with USAgent led to the two men coming to blows on more than one occasion.

In the late 1980s a new Avengers comic called [[Solo Avengers]] came out, later retitled [[Avengers Spotlight]].  Each issue of the comic featured two stories, each starring an Avenger in solo adventures.  Marvel Comics held a contest to determine the most popular Avenger who didn't have their own series, and Hawkeye won.  In response, Marvel made Hawkeye the regularly featured character in the first story in each issue, with the star of the second feature rotating with each installment.  Towards the end of its run, [[Avengers Spotlight]] dropped the Hawkeye feature and had full-length stories featuring different Avengers.

A short-lived change of direction for Hawkeye began in the pages of [[Avengers Spotlight]].  Hawkeye became involved in battling Los Angeles street gangs and in the process was himself ambushed and gunned down.  Once he recovered, he donned a suit of "battle armor" and became a dark streetfighting character in the vein of the [[Punisher]] or [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]].  This change of direction was short-lived and Hawkeye regained his normal costume and attitude.

After [[Operation: Galactic Storm]] they finally permanently reconciled, only to have [[Ultron]] kidnap Mockingbird to use her brain patterns to create his "perfect wife," [[Alkhema]] (also known as "War Toy"). Feeling that his behavior had been less-than-professional during the rescue, Hawkeye stepped down from chairmanship of the West Coast Avengers and Mockingbird announced that she would be changing to "reserve" status. They had one last adventure as Avengers together, during which Mockingbird was killed by the [[demon]] [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]].

After her death Hawkeye left the team and the West Coast Avengers were disbanded. While most of the former West Coast Avengers went on to form a new team led by [[Iron Man]] called [[Force Works]], Hawkeye began a life of aimless wandering, embittered by Mockingbird's death.  His adventures during this period, which included a clash with [[Viper]] and his old enemy [[Trick Shot]], are chronicled in the second Hawkeye limited series.  During this series he gained a werewolf-like companion named [[Rover]].  When Hawkeye rejoined the Avengers, it was never revealed what happened to Rover.

He finally returned to the Avengers shortly prior to the battle with [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]], after which the Avengers (including Hawkeye) were presumed deceased for a time. In actuality, they were revived in a [[pocket dimension]] created by [[Franklin Richards]] for the events of "[[Heroes Reborn]]", and returned to [[Earth-616]] during "[[Heroes Return]]". As a part of the "return" process, Hawkeye's deafness was cured.

===Thunderbolts===

Shortly after Hawkeye's return, he quit the Avengers, giving his spot in their roster to [[Justice (comics)|Justice]] and [[Firestar]]. He then became affiliated with the Thunderbolts, a group of former [[supervillain]]s who had apparently turned over a new leaf by battling menaces such as [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]]. He joined the team as their ''de facto'' leader and mentor, ultimately helping several members obtain pardons for their past crimes. During one adventure, [[Hellstorm]] sent them to Mephisto's [[Purgatory]], where they attempted to rescue Mockingbird's soul but instead returned [[Hellcat (comics)|Hellcat]] to the land of the living. Hawkeye later entered a romantic relationship with his teammate, [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]].

After the Thunderbolts defeated the [[Scourge (comics)|Scourge]] and [[Henry Peter Gyrich]], both of whom were under [[Baron Strucker]]'s domination, the Thunderbolts were offered a full pardon for their actions under two conditions: Hawkeye turn himself in for incarceration, and the other Thunderbolts retire permanently. They accepted, and Hawkeye went to prison, but later helped [[SHIELD]] by infiltrating a jailbreak that was led by [[Mentallo]] at the behest of [[Justin Hammer]]. Meanwhile, half of the Thunderbolts were teleported by Graviton to [[Counter-Earth (comics)|Counter-Earth]] (the "Heroes Reborn" world, now in orbit around the Sun opposite the Earth). Hawkeye led the remaining Thunderbolts, plus several of the escaped criminals and some former members of the [[Crimson Cowl]]'s new [[Masters of Evil]] team, to form a new Thunderbolts team. Once this team was reunited with the lost members, they together defeated the Crimson Cowl, but several Thunderbolts were returned to government custody for violating the terms of their pardon. Hawkeye then left the team and rejoined the Avengers, giving [[Baron Zemo]] the opportunity to assume leadership of the Thunderbolts. After the next meeting between the Avengers and Thunderbolts, the Thunderbolts were again disbanded, although this would again prove temporary.

Shortly before the Avengers' assault by the Scarlet Witch, he had a brief fling with team member [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]].

===Avengers Disassembled and House of M===
During the [[Avengers Disassembled]] storyline, the Scarlet Witch went insane over the loss of her children with the Vision and used her reality-manipulation powers to create deadly threats to her teammates. Hawkeye apparently died during this storyline, sacrificing himself to destroy a [[Kree]] starship in ''Avengers'' #502. However, during the ''[[House of M]]'' miniseries, he showed up alive once more in the Scarlet Witch's mutant-dominated altered reality, with no memory of the previous reality. When a young mutant named [[Layla Miller]] gave several of the heroes the ability to remember the way the world once was, Hawkeye and the others were horrified at what the Scarlet Witch had done. In addition, Hawkeye remembered the experience of his own death. When the heroes confronted the Witch and her children (who were real and had similar powers to their mother's in this reality), Hawkeye broke rank, shooting her in the back (although it did her no harm), and demanding to know why she had killed him, as he was her friend and had only love for her. One of the Witch's children, annoyed, made Hawkeye vanish into nothingness with a thought. ''House of M'' #8 depicted several heroes arriving at the ruined Avengers mansion, after a report that someone had been there, only to find Hawkeye's costume and a newspaper cutting about his death, pinned to the ruins by Hawkeye's trademark purple arrows.

Some time after House of M, when Jennifer Walters (alias [[She-Hulk]]) was working on a trial involving time travel, The [[Time Variance Authority]] provided a number of jurors from the recent past in order to have jurors who had not been tainted by widespread media coverage of the defendant.   Hawkeye, in his civilian identity, was among those chosen.  (Later it is revealed that the TVA deliberately selected people who had died in order to prevent jurors from having too much impact on the timestream.) 

Hawkeye sneaks away from where the juries are sequestered to fight crime, narrowly avoiding being asked "Aren't you dead?" on several occasions.  He attempts to call the Avenger's switchboard, only to be assumed a crank caller.  She-Hulk attempts to pass him a note giving him information that will hopefully allow him to survive, but the note is intercepted by the TVA, and She-Hulk herself is put on trial for attempting to interfere with time.   Several Avengers are called as character witnesses, and just before the various Avengers are returned to their own times, Wasp steals the intercepted letter and gives it to Hawkeye.

===Post-House of M===
At the moment the world is restored to normal reality, sans most of the mutants, Hawkeye awakes on the grounds of the ruined Avengers Mansion. Inside the mansion he finds an article describing his death. He removes his mask and costume over-tunic and pins those parts of the costume and the article about his death into the wall of the mansion and leaves before the New Avengers arrive to check the disturbance. Seeking out Dr. Strange, where it is confirmed that he is both alive and healthy, Hawkeyes decides to find the Scarlet Witch for answers about his deaths and resurrections at her hands. He travels to Genosha and then to Wundagore (the Scarlet Witch's childhood home) and finds her, by chance, in a small village. After unknowingly defending her from a thief, Hawkeye is shocked to discover that she has no memory of him, the Avengers, or of having lived in America.  To further complicate matters, the Scarlet Witch rewards his earlier bravery with a kiss which leads to the pair having sex.

==Kate Bishop==
{{main|Hawkeye (Kate Bishop)}}

In the time period between ''[[Avengers Disassembled]]'' and the ''[[House of M]]'' events, when Clint Barton was believed dead, Kate Bishop, a member of the [[Young Avengers]], adopted the codename "Hawkeye" at [[Captain America]]'s suggestion. As explained to Kate by [[Jessica Jones]], Kate reminded [[Captain America]] of the first Hawkeye not only because of her skill with a bow and arrows but because she was unafraid to stand up to Captain America for what she thought was right, as the first Hawkeye had often done.

==Powers and abilities==
Hawkeye has no superhuman powers (although he uses [[Henry Pym|Pym particles]] to become Goliath on occasion). He possesses exceptional strength, endurance, and stamina. His reflexes and agility represent the absolute pinnacle of human perfection. He is capable of acrobatic maneuvers that would put an Olympic gold medalist to shame. His accuracy as an archer is virtually unerring. He is also a highly competent strategist, tactician, and field commander. He is an exceptional hand-to-hand combatant, having been trained by [[Captain America]]. 

His primary weapons in crime-fighting are a long bow and an arsenal of arrows, often 36, carried in a back quiver. Half of them have either target or blade points, while the rest carry a wide variety of customized special heads: high explosive, acid, cable (for climbing or crossing gaps), webs and bolas (to entangle suspects), and smoke and freeze arrows are just a few samples. For emergency use, Hawkeye has several spare arrowheads in his costume's belt and straps, enabling him to refit the target point arrows into [[Trick Arrows]] if need be.

==Alternate versions==
===Marvel MAX===
In the [[Marvel MAX]] series [[War Machine|U.S. War Machine]], Hawkeye appeared alongside [[Captain America]] and The [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]]; he and [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] served as [[Captain America]]'s backup and wore no costumes, only being addressed by their real names. In this reality, [[Captain America]] was actually [[Bucky]] wearing the Captain's uniform as here the Captain had died in [[World War II]] in his stead.

===Ultimate Hawkeye===
[[Image:ultimates9.jpg|thumb|200px|Promotional art for '''Ultimates''' #9. Art by [[Bryan Hitch]].]]
In the [[Ultimate Marvel Universe]], ''Ultimate Hawkeye'' is a member of the Ultimate version of the Avengers, the [[Ultimates]], where he is the partner of the Ultimate version of the Black Widow. The Ultimate versions of these characters are much more ready to use lethal force than are their normal Marvel Universe counterparts. 

Hawkeye has a metahuman-level of accuracy, an ability resembling that of the [[Earth-616|616]] character [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]].  Essentially, he can turn any sharp object, however small, into a deadly projectile.  This ability extends to a seemingly superhuman-effectiveness with firearms and bow weapons, as well as a number of improvised weapons like silverware, plates, and in one case, fingernails. Yet, it has never been said outright whether he has powers or not. 

His Ultimates "field" costume is a black sleeveless bodysuit with silver-ridged body armor on the chest and red insets  at the back and sides. In many scenes he wears S.H.I.E.L.D. fatigues or uniform instead of his Ultimates costume. He often - but not always - wears glasses or sunglasses, although it hasn't been stated why (or if) he needs them to correct his vision.

For reasons of pacing he was not featured in the animated film [[Ultimate Avengers]], nor in the sequel.

{{Spoiler}}
====Ultimates====
Clint Barton lives with his wife (initially introduced as his girlfriend, later described as his wife) and three children in the suburbs of New York, in commuting distance from S.H.I.E.L.D.'s headquarters, the Triskelion. He has a tradition of calling her and their children to say goodbye before every mission, should it one day be his last.

Hawkeye and [[Black Widow (comics)#Ultimate Black Widow|Black Widow]] lead a team of Black Ops S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel into a sleeper colony of Chitauri agents operating out of two New York City office buildings. The mission subsequently goes bad, with only Hawkeye, Widow and another trooper, McQuillin, surviving.

Hawkeye fights the Chitauri at an Air Force base in New Mexico, and sustains several wounds in the process. Despite the injury, he is responsible for sedating and immobilizing the rampaging [[Hulk (comics)#Ultimate Hulk|Hulk]] after the invasion is quashed.

====Ultimates 2====
In issue #7, Hawkeye's home is invaded and his family is murdered by masked agents. The issue ends with the implication that Hawkeye was about to be killed as well, though in the next issue his body was missing. The true identities of the killers and their leader was not revealed. In issue #8, members of S.H.I.E.L.D. watch a security video that shows what seems to be Captain America killing Hawkeye and his family.

At the beginning of issue #9, it is revealed that Hawkeye was not killed, but had been shot with tranquilizers. After regaining consciousness, Hawkeye learns that over the previous three days, he had been drugged, tortured, and the security codes to the Triskelion were ripped from his mind.

In  the absence of any nearby weapons, and demonstrating his remarkable accuracy and pain resistance, Hawkeye tears his own fingernails off and uses them as lethal projectiles, flicking them into his captors' mouths, choking and immobilizing them. The squad of soldiers that arrives to contain Hawkeye find him freed from confinement and surrounded by the bodies of his captors. Hawkeye shoots and kills the second squad with weapons taken from the first set. He then travels to Washington DC and helps the other Ultimates defeat the [[Liberators (comics)|Liberators]].
