The character first appeared in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #57 (Sept. 1964) and was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Don Heck]].

==Publication history==
Hawkeye was introduced as a reluctant villain in ''Tales of Suspense'' #57 (September 1964), and after two more brief appearances in ''Tales of Suspense'' #60 and 64 (December 1964 and April 1965), joined the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] #16 (May 1965). Hawkeye was a perennial member, and has appeared in three volumes.

Hawkeye featured in two four-issue miniseries, published in 1983 and 1994 respectively. The first was written by [[Mark Gruenwald]] and the second by [[Chuck Dixon]]. This was followed by a one-shot publication, ''Hawkeye: Earth's Mightiest Marksman'' (1998), written by [[Tom DeFalco]] and penciled by [[Jeff Johnson (comics)|Jeff Johnson]]. In 2003 there was an attempt at an ongoing series written by [[Fabian Nicieza]], but the title was canceled after only eight issues.

Hawkeye featured prominently in the'' [[West Coast Avengers]]'' limited series — #1–4 (September 1984 – December 1984) — before appearing in the ongoing title, which ran for 102 issues (including 8 annuals) from October 1985 - January 1994. The title was renamed "Avengers West Coast" from #46 (Aug. 1989). Hawkeye also starred concurrently in almost every issue of ''Solo Avengers'' which ran for 40 issues from December 1987 – January 1991 (the title was renamed ''Avengers Spotlight'' from #21 (August 1989).

From 1998, Hawkeye featured significantly in issues #20–70 of the title ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'', written by [[Kurt Busiek]] and Fabian Nicieza.

The character appeared in ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' which also saw the return of his love-interest [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]], and the two characters became the leads in a new series ''[[Hawkeye & Mockingbird]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Siegel |first=Lucas |url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/Hawkeye-Mockingbird-McCann-100310.html |title=HAWKEYE & MOCKINGBIRD, In Costume, In Love, In New Ongoing |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |date=March 10, 2010 |accessdate=March 19, 2010}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
'''Clinton Barton''' was an orphan, and ran away from the orphanage as a pre-teen to join the [[circus]] as a carnival performer, where he was trained in the use of the bow and arrow by the [[Swordsman (comics)#Jacques Duquesne|Swordsman]] and [[Trick Shot (comics)|Trickshot]].<ref>Seen in flashback in ''Solo Avengers'' #1 - 5 (Dec. 1987 - Apr. 1988)</ref> When he discovered that his mentors were both criminals he rejected them, leading to a beating by Swordsman which left Barton badly injured and hospitalized. Years later, he saw [[Iron Man]] in action, and was inspired and decided to become a costumed hero called '''Hawkeye'''. However, there is a misunderstanding on Hawkeye's first outing and he is believed to be a criminal, accused of theft.

On the run, the naive Hawkeye meets the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]], a spy for the [[Soviet Union]], whom he falls in love with. She tricks him into helping her to steal technology developed by [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]], Iron Man's alter ego. After several battles with Iron Man — who defeats the pair on every occasion — the Black Widow is injured and Hawkeye flees with her, deciding to go "straight" from then on.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #57 (1964), #60 + 64 (Dec. 1964 and Apr. 1965)</ref> Hawkeye later "applies" for membership in the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], by breaking into [[Avengers Mansion]] and binding and gagging the team's butler, [[Edwin Jarvis]]. Hawkeye is accepted, and together with leader [[Captain America]] and mutant siblings [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and the [[Scarlet Witch]] become the new team when the original members take a leave of absence.<ref>''Avengers'' #16 (May 1965)</ref>

===Avenging Archer and Giant===
Hawkeye remains a constant in the team for many years, and when his bow breaks at a crucial moment, he decides to use [[Henry Pym|Pym particles]] to become the second [[Goliath (comics)|Goliath]].<ref>''Avengers'' #63 (Apr. 1969)</ref> During this time, Barton suffers a personal setback as his brother Barney is killed by the villain [[Egghead (comics)|Egghead]], whom Goliath brings to justice.<ref>''Avengers'' #64-65 (May - Apr 1969)</ref> At the conclusion of the [[Kree-Skrull War]] Barton resumes the identity of Hawkeye in a new costume, and after a rift with teammate the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)#Silver Age|Vision]] over the affections of the [[Scarlet Witch]], he resumes his old costume and resigns from the team.<ref>''Avengers'' #109 (Mar. 1973)</ref> On a whim Hawkeye returns to the Black Widow and briefly battles her current love, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #99 (May 1973)</ref> Hawkeye then assists the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] against the monster [[Zzzax]],<ref>''Hulk'' #166 (Aug. 1973)</ref> and then follows the Hulk back to the [[Sanctum Sanctorum|mansion]] of [[Doctor Strange]], where after a skirmish Hawkeye joins the "non-team" the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] for a short period.<ref>[[Steve Englehart]] (w), [[Sal Buscema]] (p), ''Defenders'' #7 - 10 (Aug. - Nov. 1973), [[New York, NY]]: [[Marvel Comics]]</ref>

Hawkeye then meets former [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent Barbara "Bobbi" Morse, codenamed [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]]. She is investigating the company Cross Technological Enterprises, which employs Hawkeye as a security consultant. The company is revealed to be owned by the villain [[Crossfire (comics)|Crossfire]], who plans to use an aggression-inducing sonic wave against all of New York's superheroes. Hawkeye infiltrates Cross Technological Enterprises with Mockingbird to defeat Crossfire. During this encounter, Hawkeye takes one of his sonic arrows into his mouth to counter the effects of Crossfire's sonic weapon; as a result he suffers major hearing loss and is forced to wear hearing aids. Hawkeye and Mockingbird fall in love and elope immediately after.<ref>''Hawkeye'' #1 - 4 (Sep. - Dec. 1983)</ref>

There are two significant events for Hawkeye during this period. The first involves entering Hell and battling the demon [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] to try to save the soul of his deceased wife, [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]].

===New Avengers===
Unknown to the New Avengers, Hawkeye is resurrected once reality was restored, and seeks out [[Doctor Strange]], who offers Hawkeye shelter while he comes to terms with his new life.

Unaware of his true identity, Bishop berates Barton and states that she adopted Hawkeye's name to honor him, and that if Hawkeye were alive, she would adopt another name. She also affirms that the "real" Captain America gave her the name Hawkeye and his old bow as a tribute to his dead friend. Bishop's words convince Barton to return the shield and costume to Stark, and condemn him for his role in the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]].<ref>''Fallen Son: The Death of Captain America'' #3 (July 2007). #1 - 2 (June 2007); #3 - 4 (July 2007) & 5 (Aug. 2007)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
While Hawkeye has no superhuman powers (with the exception of the period when using [[Henry Pym|Pym particles]] to become Goliath), he is at the very peak of human conditioning; he is an exceptional fencer, acrobat and a grandmaster marksman, having been trained from childhood in the circus and by the criminals archer [[Trick Shot (comics)|Trick Shot]], and [[Swordsman (comics)#Jacques Duquesne|Swordsman]]. Hawkeye has also been thoroughly trained by Captain America in tactics, martial arts, and hand-to-hand combat.

Unlike the artificially augmented Black Widow, Hawkeye utilizes only a range of weapons and can turn any object into a precisely-aimed projectile.

A TNT arrow sent by Clint destroys the container of the 12 artifacts, which draws Krona in and restores the universes to their original states.<ref>[[Kurt Busiek]] (w), [[George Perez]] (p), ''JLA/Avengers'' #3 (December 2003)</ref>

When Hawkeye visits Bruce Banner's cell in the [[Cube (comics)|Cube]] upon Doc Samsons' departure to question him why the Hulk saved his crew instead of escaping, Bruce quotes that the people in the Cube want to use the DNA Samples of him and the other inmates to create more Hulks. Hawkeye later sees Black Widow stealing the DNA sample of the Hulk and finds out that she is a double-agent working for HYDRA. During the fight, Black Widow set Hawkeye up as a double-agent and defeats him causing the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents to remand him to the Vault.

When Abomination and Absorbing Man are defeated, Hawkeye knocks down Leader as Hulk sends the Gamma Generator into space. The next day, footage from Hawkeye's hovercycle confirmed Hawkeye's innocence, but Black Widow got away. Hawkeye vowed to catch Black Widow only to end up joining the Avengers when Hulk says that he'll rejoin if "Cupid stays."
