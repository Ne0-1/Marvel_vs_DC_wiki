'''Hawkeye''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]]ic [[archery|archer]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  He is a prominent member of [[The Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]], and has also served as leader of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], and a member of [[The Defenders (comics)|The Defenders]].

Hawkeye, whose real name is Clinton "Clint" Barton, was a [[Circus (performing art)|circus]] performer who worked alongside the [[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]].  He eventually turned to petty crime to make ends meet; during this time, he met and became enthralled by the [[Black Widow (comics)|Black Widow]], who was at the time a spy for the [[Soviet Union]].  He completed several criminal acts on her behalf, until he learned that she was a spy and saboteur.  [[Iron Man]] defeated him, but let him go, as he recognized the archer's capacity for heroism.  [[Captain America]] subsequently recruited Hawkeye into the Avengers, where he served alongside Cap, [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and the [[Scarlet Witch]].  Although he was enamored of the Witch, she eventually married their teammate, the [[Vision (comics)|Vision]].

During a solo adventure, Hawkeye met the former government agent Bobbi Morse, alias [[Mockingbird (comics)|Mockingbird]]; the two had a whirlwind romance and were married shortly thereafter.  They subsequently founded the [[West Coast Avengers]], and served as two of the most prominent members of that team until Mockingbird was killed by the [[demon]] [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]].  The West Coast team disbanded, and Hawkeye left the superhero career for a time.  He returned to the Avengers shortly prior to the battle with [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]], after which the Avengers (including Hawkeye) were presumed deceased for a time.

Upon his return, he became affiliated with the Thunderbolts, a group of former [[supervillain]]s who had apparently turned over a new leaf, battling menaces such as [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]].  He joined the team as their ''de facto'' leader and mentor, ultimately helping several members obtain pardons for their past crimes.  After a time, he left the Thunderbolts and rejoined the Avengers, until his death in issue #502 during the Avengers Disassembled storyline.

In the [[Ultimate Marvel Universe]], Hawkeye is a member of the Ultimate version of the Avengers, [[The Ultimates]], where he is the partner of the Ultimate version of the Black Widow.
