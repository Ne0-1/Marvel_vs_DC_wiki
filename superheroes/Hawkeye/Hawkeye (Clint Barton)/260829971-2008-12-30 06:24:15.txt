'''Hawkeye''' ('''Clint Barton'''), also known as '''[[Ronin (Marvel Comics)|Ronin]]''' and '''[[Goliath (comics)|Goliath]]''', is a [[fictional character]] that appears in the [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appeared in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #57 (Sept. 1964) and was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Don Heck]].

==Publication history==
Hawkeye was introduced as a reluctant villain in ''Tales of Suspense'' #57 (Sep. 1964), and after two more brief appearances in ''Tales of Suspense'' #60 and 64 (Dec. 1964 and Apr. 1965), joined the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] #16 (May 1965). Hawkeye was a perennial member, and has appeared in three volumes. He also featured prominently in the'' [[West Coast Avengers]]'' limited series - #1-4 (September 1984 - December 1984) - before appearing in the ongoing title, which ran for 102 issues (including 8 Annuals) from Oct. 1985 - Jan. 1994. The title was renamed "Avengers West Coast" from #46 (Aug. 1989). Hawkeye also starred concurrently in almost every issue of ''Solo Avengers'' which ran for 40 issues from Dec. 1987 - Jan 1991 (the title was renamed ''Avengers Spotlight'' from #21 (Aug. 1989) ).

Hawkeye also featured in two four-issue miniseries, published in 1983 and 1994 respectively. The first was written by [[Mark Gruenwald]] and the second by [[Chuck Dixon]]. This was followed by a one-shot publication, ''Hawkeye: Earth's Mightiest Marksman'' (1998), written by [[Tom DeFalco]] and penciled by Jeff Johnson. In 2003 there was an attempt at an ongoing series written by [[Fabian Nicieza]], but the title was cancelled after only eight issues.

From 1998, Hawkeye featured significantly in issues #20 - 70 of the title [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], written by [[Kurt Busiek]] and Fabian Nicieza.

==Fictional character biography==
Clint Barton was an orphan, and ran away from the orphanage as a pre-teen to join the  [[Circus (performing art)|circus]] as a carnival performer, where he was trained in the use of the bow and arrow by the [[Swordsman (comics)#Jacques Duquesne |Swordsman]] and [[Trick Shot (comics)|Trickshot]].<ref>Seen in flashback in ''Solo Avengers'' #1 - 5 (Dec. 1987 - Apr. 1988)</ref> When he discovered that his mentors were both criminals he rejected them, leading to a beating by Swordsman which left Barton badly injured and hospitalized. Years later, he saw [[Iron Man]] in action, and was inspired and decided to become a costumed hero called '''Hawkeye'''. However, there is a misunderstanding on Hawkeye's first outing and he is believed to be a criminal, accused of theft.

On the run, the naive Hawkeye meets the [[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]], a spy for the [[Soviet Union]], whom he falls in love with. She tricks him into helping her to steal technology developed by [[Tony Stark]], Iron Man's alter ego. After several battles with Iron Man — who defeats the pair on every occasion — the Black Widow is injured and Hawkeye flees with her, deciding to go "straight" from then on. <ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #57 (1964), #60 + 64 (Dec. 1964 and Apr. 1965)</ref> Hawkeye later "applies" for membership in the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], by breaking into the Avengers Mansion and binding and gagging the team's butler, [[Edwin Jarvis]]. Hawkeye is accepted, and together with leader [[Captain America]] and mutant siblings [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and the [[Scarlet Witch]] become the new team when the original members take a leave of absence.<ref>''Avengers'' #16 (May 1965)</ref>

===Avenging Archer and Giant===
Hawkeye remains a constant in the team for many years, and when his bow breaks at a crucial moment decides to use [[Henry Pym|Pym particles]] to become the second '''[[Goliath (comics)|Goliath]]'''.<ref>''Avengers'' #63 (Apr. 1969)</ref> During this time, Barton suffers a personal setback as his brother Barney is killed by the villain [[Egghead (comics)|Egghead]], whom Goliath brings to justice. <ref>''Avengers'' #64-65 (May - Apr 1969)</ref> At the conclusion of the [[Kree-Skrull War]] Barton resumes the identity of Hawkeye in a new costume, and after a rift with team-mate the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)#Silver Age|Vision]] over the affections of the [[Scarlet Witch]], he resumes his old costume and resigns from the team. <ref>''Avengers'' #109 (Mar. 1973)</ref> On a whim Hawkeye returns to the Black Widow and briefly battles her current love, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]. <ref>''Daredevil'' #99 (May 1973)</ref> Hawkeye then assists the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] against the monster [[Zzzax]],<ref>''Hulk'' #166 (Aug. 1973)</ref> and then follows the Hulk back to the [[Sanctum Sanctorum|mansion]] of [[Doctor Strange]], where after a skirmish Hawkeye joins the "non-team" the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] for a short period. <ref>''Defenders'' #7 - 10 ( Aug. - Nov. 1973)</ref>

Hawkeye then drifts for a time, returning briefly to the Avengers to attend the wedding of the Vision and the Scarlet Witch. <ref>''Giant-Size Avengers'' #4 (Jun. 1975)</ref> Together with the [[Two-Gun Kid]] and [[Ghost Rider]], Hawkeye defeats the monster the [[Manticore (comics)|Manticore]] <ref>''Ghost Rider'' #27 (Dec. 1977)</ref> before returning to the Avengers to assist when members of the team begin to mysteriously disappear. <ref>''Avengers'' #172 (Jun. 1978)</ref> The remaining Avengers discover it to be the work of the [[Elder of the Universe]] the [[Collector (comics)|Collector]]. After his team-mates are all captured, Hawkeye single-handedly defeats the Collector,<ref>''Avengers'' #174 (Aug. 1978)</ref> and joins the team for the final battle against [[Korvac]]. <ref>''Avengers'' #175 - 177 (Sep - Nov 1978)</ref> Hawkeye's victory is dashed when the Avengers new government liaison [[Henry Gyrich]], limits the roster and replaces him with the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], in an attempt to make the team more "politically acceptable".  After initially failing to find work in his civilian identity, he successfully applies for work at [[Cross Technological Enterprises]] as Hawkeye, and then battles the [[Shi'ar]] villain [[Deathbird]].<ref>''Avengers'' #189 (Nov. 1979)</ref>Hawkeye returns to Avengers mansion several months later for a brief visit "induced" by the heroine [[Moondragon]] <ref>''Avengers'' #211 (Sep. 1981)</ref> before then rejoining for a sustained period. <ref>''Avengers'' #222 (Jul. 1982)</ref> It is at this time that Hawkeye inadvertently avenges the death of his brother. The villain [[Egghead (comics)|Egghead]], having been exposed for framing [[Henry Pym]], attempts to shoot Pym but Hawkeye jams the barrel of the weapon with an arrow. The weapon is an energy pistol and explodes, killing Egghead instantly. <ref>''Avengers'' #229 (Mar. 1983)</ref>

Hawkeye then meets former [[S.H.I.E.L.D]] agent Barbara "Bobbi" Morse, codenamed [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]]. She is investigating the company Cross Technological Enterprises, which employs Hawkeye as a security consultant. The company is revealed to be owned by the villain [[Crossfire (comics)|Crossfire]], who plans to use an aggression-inducing sonic wave against all of New York's superheroes. Hawkeye infiltrates Cross Technological Enterprises with Mockingbird to defeat Crossfire. During this encounter, Hawkeye takes one of his sonic arrows into his mouth to counter the effects of Crossfire's sonic weapon; as a result he suffers major hearing loss and is forced to wear hearing aids. Hawkeye and Mockingbird fall in love and elope immediately after. <ref>''Hawkeye'' #1 - 4 (Sep. - Dec (1983)</ref>

At the direction of then-Avengers chair Vision, Hawkeye and Mockingbird establish the team the [[West Coast Avengers]]. An adventure through time is significant and brings changes as Hawkeye forges the weapons that the modern hero [[Moon Knight]] will eventually use, <ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #21 (Jun. 1987)</ref> and Mockingbird allows the [[Old West]] hero the [[Phantom Rider]] to fall to his death. When Hawkeye discovers this (through machinations of the ghost of [[Phantom Rider]]), he breaks off their relationship. <ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #23 (Aug. 1987) + 41 (Feb. 1989)</ref> Hawkeye then encounters and battles his old mentor, Trickshot <ref>''Solo Avengers'' #5 (Apr. 1988)</ref> and meets and inadvertently encourages a group of minor heroes to form the [[Great Lakes Avengers]].<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #46 (Jul. 1989)</ref> Together with Mockingbird and Trickshot, Hawkeye battles a number of minor villains <ref>''Avengers Spotlight'' #22-25 (Sep. - Dec. 1989)</ref> and then redesigns his costume after being shot by a criminal and battles Los Angeles street gangs. <ref>''Avengers Spotlight'' #30-35 (May - Oct. 1990)</ref>

Hawkeye and Mockingbird reconcile, but soon after the robot [[Ultron]] kidnaps Mockingbird and copies her brain patterns to create a "wife" — [[Alkhema]] (also known as "War Toy").<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #88 - 91 (Dec. 1992 - Feb. 1993)</ref> Although Mockingbird is rescued, she is killed soon afterwards by the demon [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]].<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #100 (Nov. 1993)</ref> Embittered by Mockingbird's death, Hawkeye leaves the team (disbanded almost immediately afterwards)<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #102 (Jan. 1994)</ref> and drifts until forced to stop the villain [[Viper]] and old mentor [[Trick Shot (comics)|Trick Shot]].<ref>''Hawkeye'' #1 - 4 (Jan. - Apr. 1994)</ref>  Hawkeye then returns to the Avengers <ref>''Avengers'' #397 (Apr. 1996)</ref> just prior to the battle with the entity [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]], in which the Avengers (including Hawkeye) are apparently killed.<ref>''Avengers'' #402 (Sep. 1996)</ref> [[Franklin Richards]], however, transported them all to a [[pocket dimension]] where the heroes led altered lives. <ref>''Heroes Reborn: Avengers'' #1 (Nov. 1996)</ref> After several months, the heroes learned the truth and they were returned to the mainstream universe. Hawkeye's hearing was fully restored as, when Franklin Richards re-created the heroes in the new universe, he based them on how he remembered them (Hence also restoring Tony Stark to adulthood following his replacement by "Teen Tony" from an alternate timeline. <ref>''Heroes Reborn: The Return'' # 1 - 4 (Nov. 1997 - Feb 1998)</ref>

===Thunderbolts, Death, and House of M===

Hawkeye then rejoins the Avengers, and after several adventures resigns to assume leadership of the first generation of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], who have broken away from the influence of [[Baron Zemo#Baron Helmut Zemo|Baron Helmut Zemo]].<ref>''Avengers'' #12 (vol. 3, Jan. 1999)</ref> Hawkeye trains the team in the fashion of former team-mate Captain America, and shapes the team into a cohesive fighting unit. There are two significant events for Hawkeye during this period. The first involves entering Hell and battling the demon [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] to try and save the soul of his deceased wife, [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]]. Hawkeye, however, rescues [[Patsy Walker]], but fails to see Mockingbird.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' Annual 2000 </ref> This event gives Hawkeye some closure and he begins a romantic relationship with his Thunderbolt teammate, [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #30 (Sep. 1997)</ref>

The team reforms after a series of battles with another version of the [[Masters of Evil]]. Hawkeye eventually leaves the team, relinquishing leadership to [[Citizen V]], whose mind was under control of Baron Helmut Zemo.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #75 (Feb. 2003)</ref> Hawkeye joins the Avengers once more, and has a brief romantic relationship with team member the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]].

When the Scarlet Witch inadvertently alters reality, Hawkeye is resurrected with no memory of previous events. During this time, Hawkeye joins a Human Resistance operated by Luke Cage and was married to Mockingbird.<ref>''House of M: Avengers'' #2 - 5</ref> When a young mutant named [[Layla Miller]] gives several heroes - including Hawkeye - the ability to remember, he is horrified at the Scarlet Witch's actions. Hawkeye shoots Wanda in the back with an arrow, and in retaliation one of her recreated children wipes him from existence. When the Scarlet Witch's reality is eventually undone, Hawkeye is still presumed dead, and the recently formed [[New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] find his bow and arrows on the site of the old Avengers Mansion, pinning up an article about his death.<ref>''House of M'' #1 - 8 (Jun. 2005 - Jan. 2006)</ref> Hawkeye is later plucked from time by the [[Time Variance Authority]] to serve as a juror in a case involving former Avengers teammate [[She-Hulk]]. She-Hulk tries unsuccessfully to warn Hawkeye as to his future.<ref>''She-Hulk'' vol. 3, #2 (2004)</ref>

===New Avengers===
Unknown to the New Avengers, Hawkeye was resurrected once reality was restored, and seeks out [[Dr. Strange]], who offers Hawkeye shelter while he comes to terms with his new life. On the advice of Dr. Strange, Hawkeye eventually travels to [[Wundagore|Wundagore Mountain]] and finds the [[Scarlet Witch]] living a normal life with no memory of her past and apparently without mutant abilities. The two become intimate and Hawkeye then leaves Wanda to her normal life. <ref>''New Avengers'' #26 (Jan. 2007)</ref> 

Once Hawkeye discovers that Captain America has apparently been killed, he confronts Tony Stark, who offers him Captain America's shield and costume. As Iron Man, Stark accompanies Barton — now dressed as Captain America — on patrol. They meet the new Hawkeye, [[Kate Bishop]], defeating the supervillain [[Firebrand (Marvel Comics)|Firebrand]]. Barton confronts Bishop about her assumption of the Hawkeye mantle. Unaware of his true identity, Bishop berates Barton and states that she adopted Hawkeye's name to honor him, and that if Hawkeye were alive, she would adopt another name. She also affirms that the "real" Captain America gave her the name Hawkeye and his old bow as a tribute to his dead friend. Bishop's words convince Barton to return the shield and costume to Stark, and condemn him for his role in the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]. <ref>''Fallen Son: The Death of Captain America'' #3 (2007)</ref>

Barton returns to speak with Dr. Strange, and to protect himself from recognition adopts the identity of [[Ronin (Marvel Comics)|Ronin]] and joins the New Avengers. As Ronin, he accompanies the team on a journey to Japan to rescue the heroine [[Echo (comics)|Echo]].<ref>''New Avengers'' #30 (May 2007)</ref> Echo—the original Ronin—later gives Barton her blessing to adopt her old identity. <ref>''New Avengers'' #33 (Aug. 2007)</ref> The pair later begin a relationship. <ref>''New Avengers'' #39 (Feb. 2008)</ref>

===Secret Invasion===

==Powers and abilities==
While Hawkeye has no superhuman powers (with the exception of the period when using [[Henry Pym|Pym particles]] to become Goliath), he is a trained athlete and tactician, being at the very peak of human conditioning. He is an expert marksman, having been trained by the criminal archer [[Trick Shot (comics)|Trick Shot]], a highly trained acrobat and aerialist since his days in the circus. Hawkeye has been thoroughly trained by Captain America in tactics, martial arts and hand-to-hand combat. Hawkeye excels in the use of weapons, especially the bow and arrow, and carries a quiver containing a number of customized [[Trick arrows|"trick-arrows"]] that use sonics, gas, explosives and flares, among others. In his new role as Ronin, Barton shows great proficiency with the katana and other melee weapons.
