==Character origin==
Barton, with the alter ego of Hawkeye, was first introduced in Marvel comic books as a reluctant villain, in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #57 (September 1964). After two more appearances as a villain in ''Tales of Suspense'' #60 and #64 (December 1964 and April 1965), Hawkeye joined the ranks of the Avengers in ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #16 (May 1965). He then became a perennial member of the team.

In the mid-2000s, [[Kevin Feige]] realized that Marvel still owned the rights to the core members of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], which included Barton. Feige, a self-professed "fanboy", envisioned creating a shared universe just as creators [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] had done with their comic books in the early 1960s.<ref name="BostonApril2012">{{cite web|date=April 25, 2012 |last=Russo |first=Tom |title=SUPER GROUP |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2012/04/29/the_avengers_collects_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbustersuper_groupthe_avengers_assembles_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbuster/ |publisher=[[Boston.com]] |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6LK5iBg53?url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2012/04/29/the_avengers_collects_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbustersuper_groupthe_avengers_assembles_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbuster/?page=1 |archive-date=November 22, 2013 |url-status=live  }}</ref> After initially offering the role of Barton to [[Jensen Ackles]], who had auditioned for the part of Captain America, Marvel hired Jeremy Renner to portray the character on screen.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/actors-who-turned-down-the-mcu/|title=15 Actors Who Turned Down MCU|date=September 29, 2017|website=CBR}}</ref>

==Character appearances==
Barton appears briefly in ''Thor'' as a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who arms himself with a bow and arrow, preparing to attempt to stop [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] from retrieving Mjolnir in New Mexico.

===Battle of New York===
{{see|The Avengers (2012 film)}}

In ''The Avengers'', [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]] attacks a remote [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] research facility and uses his scepter to enslave Barton's mind and steal the power source known as the Tesseract. They travel to [[Stuttgart]], where Barton steals [[iridium]] needed to stabilize the Tesseract's power while Loki causes a distraction. Loki allows himself to be captured and taken to the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier, which Barton attacks. Aboard the helicarrier, Barton fights [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]], who knocks him out, breaking Loki's control. Barton then participates in the Battle of New York, helping to defeat Loki's army.

===Battle of Sokovia and Civil War===
{{see|Avengers: Age of Ultron|Captain America: Civil War}}
In ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', Barton is seriously injured in an initial battle to capture a HYDRA fortress, but healed by Dr. Helen Cho. The team later hides out at Barton's country house, where it is revealed that he has a wife and children. Barton participates in the Battle of Sokovia, where he convinces Wanda Maximoff to fully become an Avenger, and is saved from an airstrike when Wanda's twin brother Pietro sacrifices his life to shield Barton and a Sokovian child from gunfire. Barton and his wife Laura name their newborn son Nathaniel Pietro Barton, in honor of Pietro.

Barton then retires from the Avengers, but returns in ''Captain America: Civil War'' to side with Steve Rogers against the Sokovia Accords. He recruits Wanda Maximoff to join that side and participates in the Berlin airport fight. He is among the heroes captured at the end of that battle. He is imprisoned in the Raft, but later broken out by Rogers. He and Scott Lang negotiate deals with the U.S. government to turn themselves in, receiving a term of [[house arrest]] in exchange. Due to this status, Barton is not involved in defending the Earth from the initial attack by the forces of Thanos; when Thanos uses the Infinity Gauntlet to snap his fingers and eliminate half of all life in the universe, Barton's wife and children are among those disintegrated. Barton soon learns of what transpired then becomes a rogue warrior, travelling the world and slaughtering organized crime figures he believes do not deserve to have been spared by the Snap.

===Time Heist===
{{see|Avengers: Endgame}}
Five years after the snap, Romanoff finds a despondent Barton killing gangsters in Tokyo, and informs him that the Avengers have discovered a possible method of time travel, which would enable them to steal the Infinity Stones from the past and use them to restore those who had been lost in the snap. Barton volunteers to be the first to test the technology, and is transported to his country home prior to the disappearance of his family, briefly hearing the voice of his daughter before he is returned to the future. Barton and Romanoff travel to a past version of Vormir to retrieve the Soul Stone, but its keeper, the [[Red Skull]], reveals that the stone can only be acquired by a person sacrificing someone they love. Romanoff and Barton each volunteer to be the sacrifice for this purpose, Barton insisting that he deserves to die for the terrible things he's done. After a struggle, Romanoff sacrifices herself, allowing Barton to claim the Soul Stone. After Hulk uses Stark's Infinity Gauntlet to snap the previously disintegrated people back into existence, Barton receives a phone call from his wife Laura to his delight. Before he can answer, Thanos attacks the Avengers compound, and Barton finds the gauntlet and prevents the first wave of forces sent by Thanos from capturing it. He then participates in defending the Earth against this new attack until [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] sacrifices his life to use the Infinity Gauntlet to disintegrate Thanos and his army. Barton and his family later attend Stark's funeral, where Barton and Maximoff commiserate over losing both Romanoff and Vision in their war against Thanos.

==Reception==
[[Screen Rant]] described Renner's portrayal of Barton as one of the casting decisions that helped the MCU, stating that "Renner channels the right amount of cynicism and earnestness to simultaneously shut down fan criticisms, recognize the ridiculousness of the premise, and somehow make it relatable".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/avengers-movies-casting-decisions-hurt-saved-movies/|title=11 Casting Decisions That Hurt The Avengers Movies (And 12 That Saved Them)|date=August 18, 2018|website=ScreenRant}}</ref>
