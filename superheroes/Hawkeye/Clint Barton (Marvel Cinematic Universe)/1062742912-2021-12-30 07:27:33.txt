'''Clinton Francis Barton''', more commonly known as '''Clint Barton''', is a [[character (arts)|fictional character]] portrayed by [[Jeremy Renner]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) [[media franchise]]—based on the [[Marvel Comics]] character [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|of the same name]]—commonly by his [[Pseudonym|alias]], '''Hawkeye'''. Barton is depicted as an expert [[marksman]], [[Archery|archer]] and hand-to-hand combatant, with his preferred weapon being a [[recurve bow]]. Initially an agent of [[S.H.I.E.L.D. (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]], Barton is recruited by [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]] and becomes a founding member of the [[Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers]]. After Barton's family is decimated by [[Thanos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thanos]], he becomes a [[vigilante]] and violently dismantles [[organized crime]] as '''[[Ronin (Marvel Comics)|Ronin]]''' until he and his allies revive those lost during [[the Blip]].{{efn|name=Endgame|As depicted in ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019).}}<ref>{{Cite web |last=Cardona |first=Ian |date=July 20, 2019 |title=Hawkeye: Marvel Confirms Release Date, Teases Ronin and All-New Hawkeye |url=https://www.cbr.com/hawkeye-tv-series-disney-release-date-details/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190721083024/https://www.cbr.com/hawkeye-tv-series-disney-release-date-details/ |archive-date=July 21, 2019 |access-date=September 15, 2021 |website=[[Comic Book Resources]]}}</ref>

Barton's first appearance was a brief [[cameo appearance|cameo]] in ''[[Thor (2011 film)|Thor]]'' (2011), but he became a central figure of the MCU, appearing in five films as of 2021 and has a lead role in the miniseries ''[[Hawkeye (2021 TV series)|Hawkeye]]'' (2021).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/hawkeye-series-jeremy-renner-disney-plus-1203183398/|title=Hawkeye Series Starring Jeremy Renner in the Works at Disney+ (EXCLUSIVE)|last=Otterson|first=Joe|date=April 10, 2019|website=Variety|language=en|access-date=April 10, 2019}}</ref>

==Character origin==
Barton, with the alter ego of Hawkeye, was first introduced in Marvel comic books as a reluctant villain, in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #57 (September 1964). After two more appearances as a villain in ''Tales of Suspense'' #60 and #64 (December 1964 and April 1965), Hawkeye joined the ranks of the Avengers in ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #16 (May 1965). He then became a perennial member of the team.

In the mid-2000s, [[Kevin Feige]] realized that Marvel still owned the rights to the core members of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], which included Barton. Feige, a self-professed "fanboy", envisioned creating a shared universe just as creators [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] had done with their comic books in the early 1960s.<ref name="BostonApril2012">{{cite web|date=April 25, 2012 |last=Russo |first=Tom |title=SUPER GROUP |url=http://archive.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2012/04/29/the_avengers_collects_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbustersuper_groupthe_avengers_assembles_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbuster/ |publisher=[[Boston.com]] |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6LK5iBg53?url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2012/04/29/the_avengers_collects_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbustersuper_groupthe_avengers_assembles_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbuster/?page=1 |archive-date=November 22, 2013 |url-status=live  }}</ref> After initially offering the role of Barton to [[Jensen Ackles]], who had auditioned for the part of Captain America, Marvel hired Jeremy Renner to portray the character on screen.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/actors-who-turned-down-the-mcu/|title=15 Actors Who Turned Down MCU|date=September 29, 2017|website=CBR}}</ref>

Much of Clint's background and characterization in the Marvel Cinematic Universe was inspired by his [[Ultimate Marvel]] incarnation, particularly him being a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent and secretly having a wife and three children. His origin story in Earth-616 of him being a circus performer and former criminal trained by Swordsman is not included, though several elements of this version are implemented such as him becoming Ronin and eventually requiring hearing aids.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lealos |first1=Shawn |title=10 Biggest Differences Between Hawkeye In The Movies And The Comics |url=https://screenrant.com/hawkeye-differences-marvel-comics-mcu-disney-plus-clint-barton/ |website=Screen Rant}}</ref> His story and characterization in the ''Hawkeye'' television series were primarily influenced by [[Matt Fraction|Matt Fraction's]] 2012 comic run with the character.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Davids |first=Brian |date=November 19, 2021 |title='Hawkeye' EP Trinh Tran on Casting Hailee Steinfeld and the Influence of 'Better Call Saul' |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/hawkeye-movie-tv-show-marvel-disney-1235050780 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211119235127/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/hawkeye-movie-tv-show-marvel-disney-1235050780/ |archive-date=November 20, 2021 |access-date=November 20, 2021 |website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref>

{{see|Black Widow (2021 film)|Thor (film)}}
Barton, working as a [[S.H.I.E.L.D. (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent, is sent to kill [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]], but instead recruits her, with the pair becoming close friends and serving on various missions together, including one in [[Budapest]] in which Romanoff attempts to kill General [[Dreykov]].{{efn|name=Black Widow|As depicted in ''[[Black Widow (2021 film)|Black Widow]]'' (2021).}} At some point, [[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]] assists Barton in setting up a [[safehouse]] for his family on a farm in [[Missouri]].{{efn|name=Avengers2|As stated by Barton during the events of ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' (2015).}}

In 2011<!-- See [[Marvel Cinematic Universe#Timeline]] -->, Barton is sent on a mission in [[New Mexico]], where he arms himself with a compound bow, preparing to stop [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] from retrieving [[Mjolnir (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Mjolnir]] but chooses not to engage after watching Thor fail to lift the hammer.

===Battle of New York===
{{see|The Avengers (2012 film)}}
In 2012, Barton is working at a remote S.H.I.E.L.D. research facility with Fury when [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]] arrives and uses his [[Mind Stone|scepter]] to put Barton under [[mind control]] and steal the [[Space Stone|Tesseract]]. They travel to [[Stuttgart]], where Barton steals [[iridium]] needed to stabilize the Tesseract's power while Loki causes a distraction. Loki allows himself to be captured and taken to the S.H.I.E.L.D. [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Helicarriers|Helicarrier]], which Barton attacks with other mind controlled agents. Aboard the Helicarrier, Barton fights Romanoff, who knocks him out, breaking Loki's control. Romanoff helps him recover. After Steve Rogers recruits him, Barton becomes a founding member of the Avengers with Rogers, Romanoff, [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]], [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]], and Thor. He participates in the Battle of New York against the alien army of the [[Chitauri (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Chitauri]]. Barton later witnesses Loki's defeat and afterwards, he and Romanoff drive off together.

===Ultron and the Sokovia Accords===
{{see|Avengers: Age of Ultron|Captain America: Civil War}}
In 2015, Barton and the Avengers attack a [[Hydra (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hydra]] facility in [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Sokovia|Sokovia]] in an effort to retrieve Loki's scepter. However, Barton is seriously injured by [[Pietro Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Pietro Maximoff]] and a Hydra weapon, but is healed by Dr. [[Helen Cho]] at the [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Avengers Tower|Avengers Tower]]. Barton attends the Avengers' celebratory party, where he is introduced to [[James Rhodes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|James Rhodes]] and [[Sam Wilson (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sam Wilson]], and tries and fails to lift Mjolnir. Barton witnesses [[Ultron (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ultron]]'s first attack and his escape. In [[Johannesburg]], Barton and the Avengers track Ultron and try to stop him, but all, except Barton, are enthralled by [[Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wanda Maximoff]]'s mind warping technique. Barton takes the defeated Avengers to his safe house where it is revealed that he has a pregnant wife named Laura and children named Cooper and Lila. There, Fury arrives and motivates the team to assemble and stop Ultron. 

Barton, Romanoff, and Rogers travel to [[Seoul]] to stop Ultron from uploading his network into a [[vibranium]] body powered by the Mind Stone. They succeed, and Barton transports the sentient body back to the Avengers Tower. He also tracks a captured Romanoff's signal in Sokovia. After [[Vision (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Vision]] is awakened, the Avengers return to Sokovia to stop Ultron. There, Barton reunites with Romanoff, participates in the battle against Ultron, convinces Wanda to become an Avenger, and is saved by Pietro who sacrifices his life to shield Barton and a Sokovian child from gunfire. After the battle, Barton goes into retirement and returns home, where he and Laura name their newborn son Nathaniel Pietro Barton, in honor of Romanoff and Pietro.

In 2016, Barton returns from retirement to help Rogers in his opposition to [[United Nations]] control of the Avengers via the [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Sokovia Accords|Sokovia Accords]]. He goes to the Avengers Compound to retrieve Maximoff, but is confronted by Vision, until Maximoff incapacitates him. Barton and Maximoff recruit [[Scott Lang (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Scott Lang]] and travel to the [[Leipzig/Halle airport]] in Germany to join Rogers, Wilson, and [[Bucky Barnes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bucky Barnes]]. However, they are intercepted by Stark's team consisting of Rhodes, Romanoff, [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Parker]], [[T'Challa (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|T'Challa]], and Vision. After Rogers and Barnes escape, Barton is among those captured and imprisoned in [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Raft|the Raft]]. When Stark visits the facility, Barton openly berates him. Later, Rogers breaks him, Lang, Wilson, and Maximoff out, and he and Lang negotiate deals with the U.S. government in accordance with the accords to receive a term of [[house arrest]] instead.

===Ronin and the Time Heist===
{{see|Avengers: Endgame}}
In 2018, Barton, still on house arrest, enjoys a picnic with his family, but is caught off-guard when Laura, Lila, Cooper, and Nathaniel suddenly [[The Blip|vanish]]. In his grief, Barton becomes a vigilante called Ronin. He dons a [[ninja]] costume and [[katana]] and begins to hunt down and eliminate organized crime around the world, killing criminals he believes deserved to die instead of innocents like his family. In New York, he attacks the [[Tracksuit Mafia]] and murders William Lopez and other Tracksuit members, making enemies like the Tracksuit Mafia leader [[Wilson Fisk (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wilson Fisk]] and William Lopez's daughter [[Maya Lopez (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Maya]]. At some point he travels to [[Mexico]] and slaughters a [[drug cartel]]. Rhodes attempts to track him down but is unsuccessful. 

In 2023, Barton travels to [[Tokyo]] and murders the [[Yakuza]], before being approached by Romanoff, who tells him that the Avengers discovered [[time travel]] to reverse the Blip. Barton returns to the Avengers Compound and reunites with the other Avengers, as well as meeting [[Rocket (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Rocket]] and [[Nebula (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nebula]]. Barton volunteers to test out the quantum tunnel and is transported into the [[Quantum Realm]] where he travels to an alternate timeline seeing his house and hearing his daughter's voice before being transported back. After the Avengers formulate a plan to retrieve the Infinity Stones from different points in time, Barton and Romanoff travel to an alternate 2014 timeline. 

Travelling in the ''Benatar'' through space, they land on the planet [[Vormir]] and are met by the [[Red Skull (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Red Skull]], who tells them that in order to retrieve the [[Soul Stone]], a life sacrifice is required. Barton chooses to sacrifice himself, but is stopped by Romanoff. They fight to sacrifice themselves but, in the end, Romanoff jumps over the cliff, allowing Barton to obtain the Soul Stone. After returning to the main timeline, a grief-stricken Barton and the original Avengers hold a mourning for Romanoff outside of the Compound. Once the Nano Gauntlet is constructed, Barton watches as Banner uses it to reverse the Blip. Barton receives a phone call from his restored wife. However, the Compound is then attacked by missiles sent by an alternate Thanos' ''Sanctuary II'' warship and Barton falls into the Compound's tunnels below. Barton recovers the Gauntlet and protects it against [[List of alien races in Marvel Comics#O|O]]utriders, before joining the [[Battle of Earth (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|battle]] against the aliens. Barton watches Stark sacrifice himself to destroy Thanos' army and, after the battle, returns home and reunites with his family. A week later, they all attend Stark's funeral at his cabin and afterwards, Barton reunites with Maximoff.

=== Meeting Kate Bishop ===
{{See also|Hawkeye (2021 TV series)}}
One year later, Barton, now wearing a [[hearing aid]], spends time with his children in New York City for [[Christmas]], attending a [[Broadway theatre]] musical about Steve Rogers and the Avengers. Barton leaves early due to being bothered by the portrayal of the Battle of New York and reminders of Romanoff. That night, he learns from local news that someone has acquired his Ronin suit and is fighting the Tracksuit Mafia while wearing it. After rescuing the disguised individual from the Mafia, he unmasks the individual and finds out it is a young woman named [[Kate Bishop (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Kate Bishop]], a skilled archer who grew up idolizing him after he unknowingly saved her during the Battle of New York. 

Bishop takes Barton back to her apartment, but they are attacked by the Mafia and forced to leave the Ronin suit behind as they evacuate with [[Lucky the Pizza Dog|Lucky]], a [[golden retriever]] that Bishop rescued and adopted earlier. After relocating to Bishop's aunt's apartment, Barton sends his children back home the next morning, promising to return by Christmas Day. He escorts Bishop to her work and then recovers the Ronin suit from a [[Live action role-playing game|LARP]] event in [[Central Park]]. Later, Barton allows himself to be captured by the Mafia to learn more about their plans. Bishop, unaware of this, tracks down Barton's location to rescue him and gets captured in the process. [[Maya Lopez]] interrogates him on Ronin's true identity and Barton tells her that Ronin was killed by Romanoff. After managing to free himself and Bishop, the two work together to battle and evade Lopez and the Mafia at the [[Manhattan Bridge]].

==== Investigating the Tracksuit Mafia ====
Barton, accompanied by Bishop and Lucky, obtains a new hearing aid and then goes to the penthouse of Bishop's mother, Eleanor, to learn more about the Tracksuits using her mother's company's database. However, Bishop gets locked out of her mother's account, and Barton is confronted by [[Jack Duquesne]], the fiancé of Bishop's mother who possesses Barton's Ronin sword. The situation is diffused after Eleanor and Duquesne recognize him. Eleanor asks him to keep Bishop out of his investigation as he secretly takes back his sword. With the help of his wife Laura, Barton discovers that Duquesne is the CEO of Sloan Limited, a [[shell company]] that [[money laundering|launders money]] for the Tracksuits. That night, Bishop throws him and Lucky a small Christmas party to make up for missing time with his family, and the two bond over various activities. Barton tells Bishop about his past with Romanoff as she deduces that he was Ronin. 

The next day, Barton locates Lopez's lieutenant, Kazi Kazimierczak, and demands he convince Lopez to end her vendetta against Ronin. Afterwards, Laura informs Barton that a [[Rolex]] watch recovered from the Avengers Compound stolen by the Tracksuits is sending out tracking signals from an apartment building. Barton and Bishop go to retrieve it, and ultimately find the watch in Lopez's apartment, where she also keeps notes on Barton and his family. As Bishop battles Lopez, Barton is ambushed by a masked assassin who is revealed to be [[Yelena Belova (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Yelena Belova]] (who is targeting him after learning of his involvement in Romanoff's death) before she escapes. Barton decides that he cannot keep putting Bishop in danger and breaks off their partnership.

====Hunted by Lopez and Belova====
Barton takes shelter at the apartment of his new friend, [[FDNY]] firefighter Grills. He visits the local Avengers memorial and speaks to the late Romanoff, apologizing aloud for what he is about to do. Barton sets a meeting with Lopez where he dons the Ronin suit, quickly incapacitates all of her men, and fights and defeats Lopez. He spares her life and unmasks, warning her that continued threats toward his family will result in her demise, and reveals that he was tipped off by an [[informant]] working for Lopez's boss who wanted her father dead. Lopez manages to injure Barton who is subsequently saved by Bishop and Lopez flees. Bishop reveals to Barton that Belova is hunting him. Belova sends Bishop a text message informing her that her mother is working with Lopez's boss, who Barton identifies as organized crime boss [[Wilson Fisk (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wilson Fisk]].

Barton watches a video Belova sent Bishop and learns that Eleanor killed Armand and set up Dusquene to take the fall. On Christmas Eve, Barton and Bishop attend Eleanor’s holiday party at [[Rockefeller Center]]. Kazi attempts to assassinate Eleanor on Fisk's order, but later targets Barton. Barton enlists the help of Grills and the LARPers to evacuate the party guests, then later rejoins Bishop and defeats the Tracksuit Mafia. Bishop later departs to look for Eleanor, while Barton is confronted by Belova, who demands the truth of Romanoff's death. Barton complies but the struggle leads to a fight in which Barton eventually convinces Belova to stand down and spare his life. In the aftermath, Eleanor is arrested by the police for Armand's murder, while Fisk manages to escape but is later shot by Lopez. On Christmas Day, Barton departs New York in a car with Bishop and Lucky. Once home, he introduces Bishop and Lucky to his family, witnesses his children opening their presents, returns the stolen watch, a S.H.I.E.L.D. memento, to his wife Laura, and later burns the Ronin suit with Bishop.

===Ultron's conquest===
{{further|What If... Ultron Won?}}

Afterward, they head to the [[Hydra Siberian Facility]] and locate the final copy of [[Arnim Zola (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Arnim Zola]]'s mind, which they hope to upload onto Ultron's hive mind and eliminate him. This plan backfires as Ultron was not in their universe, prompting Barton to sacrifice himself to the pursuing Ultron sentries for Romanoff and Zola to escape.

==Reception==
[[Screen Rant]] described Renner's portrayal of Barton as one of the casting decisions that helped the MCU, stating that "Renner channels the right amount of cynicism and earnestness to simultaneously shut down fan criticisms, recognize the ridiculousness of the premise, and somehow make it relatable".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/avengers-movies-casting-decisions-hurt-saved-movies/|title=11 Casting Decisions That Hurt The Avengers Movies (And 12 That Saved Them)|date=August 18, 2018|website=ScreenRant}}</ref>

The character has been the subject of various jokes including [[internet memes]]<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cheeda |first1=Saim |title=MCU: 10 Hilarious Hawkeye Logic Memes That Are Too Funny For Words |url=https://www.cbr.com/mcu-hawkeye-logic-memes/ |website=cbr.com |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |access-date=April 9, 2021 |date=January 15, 2021}}</ref> and a 2012 ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' skit (in which Renner portrayed the character),<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sirikul |first1=Laura |title=Jeremy Renner mocks Hawkeye in SNL's Avengers skit |url=http://nerdreactor.com/2012/11/19/jeremy-renner-mocks-hawkeye-in-snls-avengers-skit/ |website=nerdreactor.com |access-date=April 9, 2021 |date=November 19, 2012}}</ref> highlighting the perceived absurdity of a regular human archer amongst aliens, super soldiers, and gods. During ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'' (2015), Barton himself acknowledged this when he stated, "The city is flying and we're fighting an army of robots. And I have a bow and arrow. None of this makes any sense".<ref>{{cite web |title=Avengers: Age of Ultron |url=https://www.quotes.net/mquote/974293 |website=quotes.net |access-date=April 9, 2021 |date=2015}}</ref> Renner indicated that he appreciates that Barton's character is more relatable, stating, "When I get off work, all I wanna do is be with my family.
