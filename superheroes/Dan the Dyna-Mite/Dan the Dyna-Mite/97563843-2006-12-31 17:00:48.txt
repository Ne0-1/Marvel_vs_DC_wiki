'''Dan the Dyna-Mite''' is a [[DC Comics ]] superhero from the 1940s.  He was the young sidekick to the character [[TNT (comics)|TNT]], and was created by [[Mort Weisinger]] and [[Hal Sharp]] for DC Comics.  TNT and Dyna-Mite made their debut in ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' # 5, and starred in ''[[Star-Spangled Comics]]'' # 7-23. 

==Fictional character biography==
Dan's [[secret identity]] was '''Daniel Dunbar'''. He was later in the [[All-Star Squadron]] and the [[Young All-Stars]]. He is was last seen as a member of the superhero protest group [[Old Justice]]. As with his mentor, he possessed a ring which controlled his powers, releasing them only when the two rings came into contact.

==Dino-Mite Dan==
Functional forgeries of the rings were later bought online by a superhero wannabe who called himself '''Dino-Mite Dan'''. He was killed with the rest of the short lived [[Seven Soldiers of Victory]] group introduced in ''Seven Soldiers'' #0.

In the [[Elseworlds]] miniseries ''[[The Golden Age (comics)|The Golden Age]]'' by [[James Robinson]] and [[Paul Smith]], TNT is killed in an apparent accident, and Daniel Dunbar becomes very depressed.  He subjects himself to an experiment (dropping an atomic bomb on him) which transforms him into the powerful Dynaman; however, it is revealed late in the miniseries that the [[Ultra-Humanite]] removed Dunbar's brain and replaced it with that of [[Adolf Hitler]].  Members of the [[Justice Society]] and [[All-Star Squadron]] unite to defeat Dynaman in a colossal battle in [[Washington, DC]].
