'''Garrison Kane''' is a fictional character from the [[Marvel Universe]]. He was created by [[Fabian Nicieza]] and [[Rob Liefeld]], and debuted in ''[[X-Force]] #2'' (1991).  Kane was a former member of [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]'s mercenary team called [[Six Pack (comics)|Six Pack]]. Although he was the youngest member, he was not immature and handled himself well enough on the field. In a Six Pack mission, the team was ambushed by Cable's clone [[Stryfe]], and Kane lost his arms and legs.

Kane was transformed into a [[cyborg]] by the [[Weapon X]] program, who grafted cybernetic arms with weaponry in place of his real ones. He was then loaned to Department K, and, with the help of former Six Pack colleague and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent [[G.W. Bridge]], assembled a strike team named Weapon P.R.I.M.E., in order to aprehend Cable and X-Force, as Kane had seen Stryfe's face and assumed he was Cable.  As X-Force defeated Weapon P.R.I.M.E., Kane learned the truth about Stryfe and was sent to Cable's future timeline, where his [[artificial limb]]s were reconstructed in liquid metal and upgraded with new weaponry and tools by Cable's freedom fighter group Clan Chosen.

After returning to the 20th Century, Kane forgave Cable and retired from mercenary work, but was seen later working for [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] and came to blows with [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] and [[Alpha Flight]]. Recently, he rejoined the Weapon X program and his cybernetic material was once upgraded to be able to duplicate the abilities of any member of Weapon X, and Kane made into the team's hitman. In battle with the group known as the Underground, Kane's mind was shut down by Cable, after which he regained his sanity, absorbing the powers of former Alpha Flight member [[Madison Jeffries]], and absorbed all Weapon X's technology to himself, apparently dying in the process.
