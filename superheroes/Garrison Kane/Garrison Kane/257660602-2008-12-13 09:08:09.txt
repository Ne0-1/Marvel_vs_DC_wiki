'''Garrison Kane''', also known as '''Weapon X''' and '''Kane''', is a fictional character from the [[Marvel Universe]]. He was created by [[Fabian Nicieza]] and [[Rob Liefeld]], and debuted in ''[[X-Force]] vol. 1 #2'' (1991).

==Fictional character biography==
Kane was a former member of [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]'s mercenary team called [[Six Pack (comics)|Six Pack]]<ref>''X-Force'' vol. 1 #8</ref>. Although he was the youngest member, he was not immature and handled himself well enough on the field. In a Six Pack mission, the team was ambushed by Cable's clone [[Stryfe]]. Thinking it would save the team, Kane's friend [[Hammer (comics)|Hammer]] tries to hand over vital information Cable needs. Cable ends up shooting Hammer, paralyzing him. Prevented from rescuing the entire team, Cable flees through time, leaving his friends. In the ensuing destruction, Kane loses his arms and legs.<ref>''Cable: Blood and Metal'' #2</ref>

Alongside [[Deadpool (comics)|Wade Wilson]], the Weapon X program "fixed" Kane by transforming him into a [[cyborg]]<ref>Deadpool vol. 1 #2</ref>, by grafting cybernetic arms in place of his real ones. He was loaned to Department K. With the help of former Six Pack colleague and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent [[G. W. Bridge]], and after a battle with the Mutant Liberation Front<ref>X-Force vol. 1 #7</ref>, Kane assembled and led a strike team named [[Weapon P.R.I.M.E.]]<ref>X-Force vol. 1 #11</ref>. The goal of Weapon P.R.I.M.E was to apprehend Cable and X-Force for multiple reasons, including Kane's belief that Cable and Stryfe were one and the same. As X-Force defeated Weapon P.R.I.M.E., Kane learned the truth about Stryfe and was sent to Cable's future timeline<ref>Cable: Blood and Metal #1</ref>, where his [[artificial limb]]s were reconstructed in liquid metal and upgraded with new weaponry and tools by Cable's freedom fighter group Clan Chosen.<ref>Cable vol. 2 #1</ref>

After returning to the 20th Century, Kane forgave Cable and rejoined the Six Pack<ref>Cable vol. 2 #4</ref>. Kane works on several missions with the remnants of Six Pack, Hammer, [[Grizzly (comics)|Grizzly]] and [[Domino (comics)|Domino]]. At one point, they worked with Nomad to track down an errant piece of valuable technology. Kane seemingly retired from mercenary work, but later was seen working for [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]]. While working with A.I.M., Kane came to blows with [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] and [[Alpha Flight]]. 

Recently, he rejoined the Weapon X program and his cybernetic material was once again upgraded.  The new upgrade made him able to duplicate the abilities of any member in Weapon X. Kane became the team's hitman. In a battle with the group known as the Underground, Kane's mind was shut down by Cable, after which he regained his sanity. Kane then absorbed the powers of former Alpha Flight member [[Madison Jeffries]], who had been brainwashed into working for the murderous leader of Weapon X, [[Malcolm Colcord]]. Kane absorbed Weapon X's technology into himself, apparently dying in the process.

==Powers and abilities==
Before he was given upgrades by the newest incarnation of Weapon X, Kane had a pair of cybernetic arms with superhuman strength. After he was sent to the future he gained new cybernetic apendages which were made out of liquid metal and could transform into shields, knives, or create detatchable remote controlled hands. His arms were also capable of repairing themselves. Due to the enhancements that the newest incarnation of Weapon X has given him, Kane now has numerous bionic appendages which houses various weapons. He now has the ability to see in various spectrums of light, project holograms, and he has a computerized targeting system. His strength was also upgraded and he is now more resistant to damage. He could download super powers such as toxic emissions, metal control, and various other abilities. It has been shown that when Kane was blown up by Deadpool, Weapon X was able to reconstruct him perfectly. It is unknown if he can always be rebuilt or if it was just that one incident. 

==Other versions==
===Exiles===
An alternate version of Kane appeared in ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]'' #5, a version originating from Earth-3031. There, he apparently still was a member of the Six Pack group, alongside his friends Cable, [[Domino (comics)|Domino]] and [[Grizzly (comics)|Grizzly]], though at some point he had also been involved in his reality's [[Weapon X|Weapon X Project]]. Kane was abducted from his reality to join a group of reality hopping superhumans forced to repair broken realities, as all Kane's fellow recruits had been involved with Weapon X in their native timelines, the group took the [[Weapon X (Exiles)|same name]].

===[[House of M]]===
Garrison Kane is shown to be a commander in [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]

===Ultimate Universe===
Kane's ultimate version was introduced in ''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'' #76, where he is once again a partner to Cable, Domino and the other Six Pack team members. This version, like his 616 counterpart, is a Caucasian male, but with Brown instead of Black hair.  He was seen in the battle with the X-men using his robotic arms to launch his fists like missiles as he does in the 616 Marvel Universe.
