'''Garrison Kane''', also known as '''Weapon X''' and '''Kane''', is a fictional character from the [[Marvel Universe]]. He was created by [[Fabian Nicieza]] and [[Rob Liefeld]], and debuted in ''[[X-Force]] vol. 1 #2'' (1991).

==Fictional character biography==
Kane was a former member of [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]'s mercenary team called [[Six Pack (comics)|Six Pack]]<ref>''X-Force'' vol. 1 #8</ref>. Although he was the youngest member, he was not immature and handled himself well enough on the field. In a Six Pack mission, the team was ambushed by Cable's clone [[Stryfe]], and Kane lost his arms and legs<ref>''Cable: Blood and Metal'' #2</ref>

Alongside [[Deadpool (comics)|Wade Wilson]], Kane joined the Weapon X program and was transformed into a [[cyborg]]<ref>Deadpool vol. 1 #2</ref>, who grafted cybernetic arms with weaponry in place of his real ones. He was loaned to Department K, and, with the help of former Six Pack colleague and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent, [[G. W. Bridge]], after a battled with the Mutant Liberation Front<ref>X-Force vol. 1 #7</ref>, assembled and led a strike team named [[Weapon P.R.I.M.E.]]<ref>X-Force vol. 1 #11</ref>, in order to apprehend Cable and X-Force, as Kane had seen Stryfe's face and assumed he was Cable.  As X-Force defeated Weapon P.R.I.M.E., Kane learned the truth about Stryfe and was sent to Cable's future timeline<ref>Cable: Blood and Metal #1</ref>, where his [[artificial limb]]s were reconstructed in liquid metal and upgraded with new weaponry and tools by Cable's freedom fighter group Clan Chosen.<ref>Cable vol. 2 #1</ref>

After returning to the 20th Century, Kane forgave Cable and rejoined the Six Pack<ref>Cable vol. 2 #4</ref> and retired from mercenary work, but was seen later working for [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] and came to blows with [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] and [[Alpha Flight]]. Recently, he rejoined the Weapon X program and his cybernetic material was once upgraded to be able to duplicate the abilities of any member of Weapon X, and Kane made into the team's hitman. In battle with the group known as the Underground, Kane's mind was shut down by Cable, after which he regained his sanity, absorbing the powers of former Alpha Flight member [[Madison Jeffries]], and absorbed all Weapon X's technology to himself, apparently dying in the process.

==Alternate versions==
* An alternate version of Kane appeared in ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]'' #5, a version originating from Earth-3031. There, he apparently still was a member of the Six Pack group, alongside his friends Cable, [[Domino (comics)|Domino]] and [[Grizzly (comics)|Grizzly]], though at some point he had also been involved in his reality's [[Weapon X|Weapon X Project]]. Kane was abducted from his reality to join a group of reality hopping superhumans forced to repair broken realities, as all Kane's fellow recruits had been involved with Weapon X in their native timelines, the group took the [[Weapon X (Exiles)|same name]].

*Kane's ultimate version was introduced in [[Ultimate X-Men]] #76, where he is once again a partner to Cable, Domino and the other Six Pack team members.

==Other media==

Kane makes a "cameo" in the film [[X2 (film)|X2]]. His name appears on a list Mystique scrolls through when accessing Magneto's files.
