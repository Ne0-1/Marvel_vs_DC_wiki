==Publication history==
Debuting in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]''  #137 (Feb. 1967), writer [[Mike Conroy]] noted "In a strip as steeped in Norse mythology as Marvel's ''Thor'', it was no surprise to come across a troll as big and mean as Ulik."<ref>Conroy, Mike. ''500 Comicbook Villains'', Collins & Brown, 2004.</ref> Created as a physical equal for the Thunder God,  the [[Asgardian (comics)|Asgardian]] [[troll]] Ulik guest starred in an initial trilogy in ''Thor'' #137 - 139 (Feb. - Apr. 1967).

==Biography==
Ulik belongs to a race of Rock Trolls who live in the dimension of [[Asgard (Marvel Comics)|Asgard]] in the "Domain of Trolls" in Nornheim. Like all trolls, Ulik has an innate hatred of the Asgardians as they were driven underground by the King of the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] gods, [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]], and forbidden to live on the surface. Ulik is commanded by the Rock Troll King, [[Geirrodur]], to steal Thor's enchanted hammer, [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]], leading to an extended series of battles with the Thunder God. Ulik proves to be a match for Thor, as the character possessing increasing strength and is equipped with [[knuckle duster]]s made of the metal uru (the same metal Mjolnir is composed of).<ref>''Thor'' #137 - 139 (Feb. - April 1967)</ref>
