'''Ulik''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in the [[Marvel Universe]]. Ulik was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], and first appears in ''Thor'' v1. #137.

==Fictional character biography==
Ulik belongs to a race of Rock Trolls who live in the dimension of [[Asgard (Marvel Comics)|Asgard]]. Like all trolls, he has an innate hatred of the [[Asgardians (Marvel Comics)|Asgardians]] as they were driven underground by [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]] and forbidden to live on the surface. For some unknown reason, Ulik is vastly superior to other Rock Trolls in terms of strength, durability and fighting ability, making him a natural opponent for [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. Ulik first encounters Thor when commanded by the Rock Troll King, [[Geirrodur]], to steal Thor's enchanted [[Uru (Marvel Comics)|uru]] hammer, [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]]. <ref>''Thor'' v1. #137 - 139</ref> While Ulik failed, he has returned on several occasions, and has at times aided Thor against a common enemy. Ulik is also responsible for accidentally awakening [[Mangog]]. <ref>''Thor'' v1. #154</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Ulik is the strongest of Rock Trolls and is nearly Thor's equal in strength.  He is exceptionally dense, having casually shrugged off armor piercing rounds from ''The Punisher''. Although the average Rock Troll is not as fast as the average human, Ulik's speed is equal to that of a normal human. 

Normally in battle, he wears Uru knuckle bands used for digging, which are referred to as his pounders.  He is perhaps the most accomplished warrior among the Rock Trolls and is fluent in ''[[English language|English]]'' as well as the native tongues of ''[[Asgard]]''.

==In other media==
Ulik appears as a villain in the video game ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]''.
