'''Ulik''' is a [[fictional]] [[troll]] appearing in the {{Marvel Universe}}. 

Ulik belongs to a race of Rock Trolls who live in the dimension of Asgard. Like all trolls, he has an innate hatred of the Asgardians as they were driven underground by [[Odin (comics)|Odin]] and forbidden to live on the surface. For some unknown reason, Ulik is vastly superior to other Rock Trolls in terms of strength; durability and fighting ability, making him a natural opponent for [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. Ulik first encounters Thor when commanded by the Rock Troll King, [[Geirrodur]], to steal Thor's enchanted uru hammer, [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]]. While Ulik failed, he has returned on several occasions, and has at times aided Thor against a common enemy. Ulik is also responsible for accidentally awakening [[Mangog]].
