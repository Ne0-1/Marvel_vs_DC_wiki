'''Ulik''' is a [[fictional]] character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He usually appears as an adversary of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. Ulik was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], and first appears in ''Thor'' #137 (February 1967).

Debuting in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], Ulik has appeared in over four decades of Marvel continuity, principally as a member of the character [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'s [[Rogues' Gallery]]. The character has also appeared in other Marvel-related products including [[animated]] [[television series]], [[toy]]s, and [[trading cards]].

==Publication history==
Writer [[Mike Conroy (writer)|Mike Conroy]] commented on Ulik's debut in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]''  #137 (Feb. 1967): "In a strip as steeped in Norse mythology as Marvel's ''Thor'', it was no surprise to come across a troll as big and mean as Ulik."<ref>Conroy, Mike. ''500 Comicbook Villains'', Collins & Brown, 2004.</ref> Created as a physical equal for the Thunder God,  the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] [[troll]] Ulik guest starred in an initial trilogy in ''Thor'' #137 - 139 (Feb. - Apr. 1967).

Ulik became a perennial villain in the title, and notable appearances included ''Thor'' #151 - 154 (April - July 1968); #210 - 211 (April - May 1973); #237 - 239 (July - Sep. 1975);  #252 (Oct. 1976); #413 - 414 (Jan. - Feb. 1990) and #430 - 431 (March - April 1991).

==Fictional character biography==
Ulik belongs to a race of Rock Trolls who live in the dimension of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] in the "Domain of Trolls" in Nornheim. Like all trolls, Ulik has an innate hatred of the Asgardians as they were driven underground by the King of the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] gods, [[Odin (comics)|Odin]], and forbidden to live on the surface. Ulik is commanded by the Rock Troll King, [[Geirrodur]], to steal Thor's enchanted hammer, [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]], before an attempt to invade Asgard, leading to an extended series of battles with the Thunder God. Ulik proves to be a match for Thor, as the character possessing increasing strength and is equipped with [[knuckle duster]]s made of the metal uru (the same metal of which Mjolnir is composed). He nearly defeats Thor after going into the berserker state of mind, but is transported away by Geirrodur. Later on Earth he traps Thor in his guise as Don Blake, and tries to gain the power of Thor with his cane. Don tells him to strike it again, although Ulik says if this fails he will kill Blake, but when Ulik brings the cane down Don suddenly holds it, meaning he transforms into Thor.<ref>''Thor'' #137 - 139 (Feb. - April 1967)</ref>

Ulik returns on a regular basis: battling Thor and being thrown down a deep hole before accidentally waking Odin's former foe [[Mangog]] hoping he can be used as an ally against Asgard after reading an inscription on the prison door by Odin;<ref>''Thor'' #151 - 154 (April - July 1968)</ref> aiding Geirrodur once again;<ref>''Thor'' #210 - 211 (April - May 1973)</ref> kidnapping Thor's mortal love [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]];<ref>''Thor'' #237 - 239 (July - Sep. 1975)</ref> and battling Thor for possession of a mystic artifact called the Ruby Eye.<ref>''Thor'' #252 (Oct. 1976)</ref> The character has also travelled to Earth and battled both Thor and [[Olympian (comics)|Olympian]] ally [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]].<ref>''Thor'' #413 - 414 (Jan. - Feb. 1990)</ref><ref>''Thor'' #430 - 431 (March - April 1991)</ref>

For a time Ulik fought on the side of several Asgardians, who were lost in their own Earthly identities. This group included the [[Warriors Three]], Balder and Sif. He battled a version of Thor called [[Red Norvell]] and worked with his temporary allies to escape a Midgard-based technological conspiracy against lost Asgardians.<ref>"Journey Into Mystery" #1-11 (1996-1997)</ref>

Much later, maddened and feral, Ulik is given weapons made from the same forge which created [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]]. He becomes the lead in Loki's attack on Asgard; this snowballs into the true Ragnarok. Ulik perishes early on in the battles. A child's hammer, made of troll-hurting iron, is thrown into his mouth by [[Captain America]]. This results in an explosion that ends his life.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2 #80-81 (2004)</ref>

However, like all of Asgard, Ulik is reformed on Earth. During the ''[[World War Hulks]]'' storyline, Ulik resurfaces and is shown to have gone on a multi-state drinking binge. He ends up destroying a train bridge with the disaster being averted by [[Rick Jones (comics)|A-Bomb]] and [[Marlo Chandler]]. When Ulik starts choking Marlo, he is defeated by A-Bomb.<ref>''World War Hulks'' #1</ref>

After Thor dies during the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Ulik replaces him as ''Tanarus'', the new Thunder God, endorsed by the All-Mothers of the Vanir (Freyja, [[Gaea (Marvel Comics)|Gaea]], and [[Idunn (comics)|Idunn]]). Exploiting a glamour charm given by Karnilla the Norn Queen and the circumstances of Thor's death, Ulik is able to retroactively place himself in Thor's place, rewriting history in the process. Only a few individuals like Karnilla and the current juvenile incarnation of Loki are aware of the deception.<ref>''The Mighty Thor'' #8 (November 2011)</ref> Tanarus' blunt nature in contrast to the honor of the true Thor allows Heimdall and Sif to realize that something is wrong relatively quickly,<ref>''The Mighty Thor'' #10 (January 2012)</ref> culminating in the returned Thor defeating 'Taranus' after his resurrection with relative ease.<ref>''The Mighty Thor'' #12 (March 2012)</ref>

Ulik later shows up as a consultant to the [[Minotaur (comics)|Minotaur]] of [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon]]. First, he helps Roxxon destroy Broxton, OK, right below Asgardia,<ref>''Thor: God of Thunder'' 22</ref> then he offers advice and battle against the Frost Giants of Jotunheim. This failed, as the Frost Giants proceeded to take over the Roxxon facility.<ref>''Thor'' Vol. 4 #2 (Nov. 2014)</ref>

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event, Ulik appears as a member of the Dark Council alongside Malekith the Accursed, Minotaur, [[Laufey (comics)|Laufey]], and some unnamed Fire Demons.<ref>''Mighty Thor'' Vol. 2 #1</ref>

Ulik and some of his trolls later appear in the Moon, where they're found and encountered by Thor Odinson. After an intense battle, Ulik and the trolls escape.<ref>''The Unworthy Thor'' #1 (2016)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Ulik possesses superhuman strength, stamina and durability, and has the ability to see into the [[infrared]] range of the spectrum, allowing complete night vision. He is also a superior hand-to-hand combatant. In battle, Ulik uses "pounders", metal bands forged from uru and worn over the hands like brass knuckles.
