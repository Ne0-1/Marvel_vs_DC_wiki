'''Ulik''' is a [[fictional]] character that appears in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Ulik was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], and first appears in ''Thor'' #137 (Feb. 1967).

==Fictional character biography==
Ulik belongs to a race of Rock Trolls who live in the dimension of [[Asgard (Marvel Comics)|Asgard]]. Like all trolls, he has an innate hatred of the [[Asgardians (Marvel Comics)|Asgardians]] as they were driven underground by [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]] and forbidden to live on the surface. For some unknown reason, Ulik is vastly superior to other Rock Trolls in terms of strength, durability and fighting ability, making him a natural opponent for [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. Ulik first encounters Thor when commanded by the Rock Troll King, [[Geirrodur]], to steal Thor's enchanted uru hammer, [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]]. <ref>''Thor'' #137 - 139 (Feb. - Apr. 1967)</ref> While Ulik failed, he has returned on several occasions, <ref>''Thor'' #210 - 211 (Apr. - May 1973); #237 - 239 (Jul. - Sep. 1975); #252 (Oct. 1976); #413 - 414 (Jan. - Feb. 1990) and #430 - 431 (Mar. - Apr. 1991)</ref> Ulik is also responsible for accidentally awakening [[Mangog]]. <ref>''Thor'' #154 (Jul. 1968)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
