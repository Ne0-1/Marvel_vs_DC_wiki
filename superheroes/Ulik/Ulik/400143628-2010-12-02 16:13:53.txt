'''Ulik''' is a [[fictional]] character that appears in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Ulik was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], and first appears in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' #137 (Feb. 1967).

Debuting in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], Ulik has appeared in over four decades of Marvel continuity, principally as a member of the character [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'s [[Rogues' Gallery]]. The character has also appeared in other Marvel-related products including [[animated]] [[television series]]; [[toy]]s and [[trading cards]].

==Publication history==
Debuting in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]''  #137 (Feb. 1967), writer [[Mike Conroy (writer)|Mike Conroy]] noted "In a strip as steeped in Norse mythology as Marvel's ''Thor'', it was no surprise to come across a troll as big and mean as Ulik."<ref>Conroy, Mike. ''500 Comicbook Villains'', Collins & Brown, 2004.</ref> Created as a physical equal for the Thunder God,  the [[Asgardian (comics)|Asgardian]] [[troll]] Ulik guest starred in an initial trilogy in ''Thor'' #137 - 139 (Feb. - Apr. 1967).

Ulik became a perennial villain in the title, and notable appearances included ''Thor'' #151 - 154 (April - July 1968); #210 - 211 (April - May 1973); #237 - 239 (July - Sep. 1975);  #252 (Oct. 1976); #413 - 414 (Jan. - Feb. 1990) and #430 - 431 (March - April 1991). 

==Biography==
Ulik belongs to a race of Rock Trolls who live in the dimension of [[Asgard (Marvel Comics)|Asgard]] in the "Domain of Trolls" in Nornheim. Like all trolls, Ulik has an innate hatred of the Asgardians as they were driven underground by the King of the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] gods, [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]], and forbidden to live on the surface. Ulik is commanded by the Rock Troll King, [[Geirrodur]], to steal Thor's enchanted hammer, [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]],  before an attempt to invade Asgard, leading to an extended series of battles with the Thunder God. Ulik proves to be a match for Thor, as the character possessing increasing strength and is equipped with [[knuckle duster]]s made of the metal uru (the same metal Mjolnir is composed of).<ref>''Thor'' #137 - 139 (Feb. - April 1967)</ref> 

Ulik returns on a regular basis: battling Thor  and being thrown down a deep hole before accidentally waking Odin's former foe [[Mangog]] hoping he can be used as an ally against Asgard after reading an inscription on the prison door by Odin;<ref>''Thor'' #151 - 154 (April - July 1968)</ref> aiding Geirrodur once again ;<ref>''Thor'' #210 - 211 (April - May 1973)</ref> kidnapping Thor's mortal love [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]];<ref>''Thor'' #237 - 239 (July - Sep. 1975)</ref> and battling Thor for possession of a mystic artifact called the Ruby Eye.<ref>''Thor'' #252 (Oct. 1976)</ref> The character has also travelled to Earth and battled both Thor and [[Olympian (comics)|Olympian]] ally [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]].<ref>''Thor'' #413 - 414 (Jan. - Feb. 1990)</ref><ref>''Thor'' #430 - 431 (March - April 1991)</ref> 

During the ''[[World War Hulks]]'' storyline, Ulik resurfaces and is shown to have gone on a multi-state drinking binge. He ends up destroying a train bridge with the disaster being averted by [[Rick Jones (comics)|A-Bomb]] and [[Marlo Chandler]]. When Ulik starts choking Marlo, he is defeated by A-Bomb.<ref>''World War Hulks'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Ulik possesses superhuman strength, stamina, and durability and has the ability to see into the [[infrared]] range of the spectrum, allowing complete night vision. In battle Ulik uses "pounders", metal bands forged from uru and worn over the hands like brass knuckles.

==Other versions==
In the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] [[imprint]] title ''[[A-Next]]'', a futuristic [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] of Ulik aids the daughter of [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] ([[Sylene]]) into temporarily turning Earth into a new version of Asgard.<ref>''A-Next'' #1 - 5 (Nov. 2006 - Jan. 2007)</ref>
