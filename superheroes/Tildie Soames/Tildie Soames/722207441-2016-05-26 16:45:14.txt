She is shown locked up in a sealed box that was watched over by Kavita Rao at the Mutant Response Division's Central Facility. When [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] reported the problem, [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] sent [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] to break the box open and implant her with a device to make her lose control over her mutant abilities. A dark red gigantically huge monster manifested from Tildie's nightmares, knocked Juggernaut into the city and then went on a rampage. During battle, [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] discovered her in the monster and [[Emma Frost]] was able to infiltrate her mind. [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] absorbs the abilities of [[Kitty Pryde|Shadowcat]] and Juggernaut and uses them to enter the monster. Once Rogue got into the monster, she removed the device as Tildie tells her that she can't stop the monster. Rogue then uses her absorption ability on Tildie which stops the monster. Tildie is currently living with the X-Men to learn how to better control her abilities. In "Backlash," Shadowcat looked after Tildie so that she wouldn't go monster while the X-Men are away. She managed to keep the girl calm and hidden while she took care of an MRD raid. In "Foresight, Part 3", Tildie appeared with the rest of the X-Men and met up with [[Professor X]] for the first time.
