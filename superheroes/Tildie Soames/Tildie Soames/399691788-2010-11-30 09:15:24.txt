==Other media==
===Television===
* Tildie Soames appears in the ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men]]'' episode "Battle Lines" voiced by [[Danielle Judovits]]. She is shown locked up in a sealed box that was watched over by Kavita Rao at the Mutant Response Division's Central Facility. When [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] reported the problem, [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] sent [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] to break the box open and implant her with a device to make her lose control over her powers. A monster manifested from Tildie's nightmares, knocked Juggernaut into the city and then went on a rampage. During battle, [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] discovered her in the monster and [[Emma Frost]] was able to infiltrate her mind. [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] absorbs the abilities of [[Kitty Pryde|Shadowcat]] and Juggernaut and uses them to enter the monster. Once Rogue got into the monster, she removed the device as Tildie tells her that she can't stop the monster. Rogue then uses her power on Tildie which stops the monster. Tildie is currently living with the X-Men. In "Backlash," Shadowcat looked after Tildie so that she wouldn't go monster while the X-Men are away. She managed to keep the girl calm and hidden while she took care of an MRD raid. In "Foresight Part 3" Tildie later appeared with the rest of the X-Men and met with [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]].

* In ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]'' episode "A Brat Walks Among Us", '''Brynnie Bratton''' (voiced by [[Tara Strong]]) is a bratty 3-year-old girl that has a very similar appearance to Tildie Soames. In the show she decides to hire the Heroes For Hire (consisting of Luke Cage, Iron Fist and Misty Knight) to help her find her father, but is also wearing a tiara with a fractal making her invincible. The heroes and villains must put up with her superpower temper-tantrums while Falcon helps Heroes for Hire track down Brynnie's father '''Fireman Bratton''' and bring her under control.
