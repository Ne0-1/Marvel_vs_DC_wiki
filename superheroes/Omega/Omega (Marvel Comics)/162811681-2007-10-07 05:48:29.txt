'''Omega''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]].

Omega is a gigantic humanoid creation of [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus]] which draws upon psionic power from the racial hatred of the [[Inhumans]] towards the [[Alpha Primitive]]s, and converts that power into strength.  

Later, [[Ultron]] betrayed Maximus and placed his computer-mind within an enlarged adamantium head and transplanted it atop Omega's body.  In this form, Ultron attacked the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], [[Fantastic Four]], and Inhumans.
