'''Jason Philip Macendale, Jr.''' is a [[fiction]]al [[character (arts)|character]] that appears in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appears in ''[[Machine Man]]'' #19 (Feb 1981), and was created by writer [[Tom DeFalco]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]].

==Fictional character biography==
'''Jason Philip Macendale''' was a former CIA agent who was recruited out of college to become an agent for the organization. Unfortunately, Macendale quickly proved himself to be a liability to the organization, due to his violent nature and amoral personality. This rejection turned Macendale to crime, as his anger at the US government for firing him as a covert agent led to him becoming a mercenary and ultimately a costumed terrorist, as he adopted the costumed alter ego of [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]]. 

The character debuted as a villain in the pages of [[Machine Man]] volume 1 #19,<ref>''[[Machine Man]]'' #19</ref> before becoming a regular nemesis for Spider-Man, meeting him in battle the first time in ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #56. The character became entangled within the story of the mystery of who was [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]], having been hired to retrieve the villain's lost battle van.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #254</ref>

Wishing to increase his underworld status, Macendale formed an alliance with the villain, who at this time was using brainwashed journalist [[Ned Leeds]] as a proxy to ensure that no one would know that the villainous Hobgoblin was really fashion designer Roderick Kingsley. The two worked together, but the brainwashing treatments used on Ned Leeds to make him Hobgoblin began to affect the writer's sanity, ultimately leading to him doublecrossing Macendale in order to try and kill Spider-Man when the two were in the middle of a desperate chase across the city to evade arrest by a horde of police officers.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #286</ref>

Macendale vowed revenge against Ned Leeds, ultimately arranging for his murder via agents of the super-assassin known only as the [[Foreigner (comics)|Foreigner]]. Upon killing Leeds, all known copies of the Hobgoblin's weapons and costumes were handed over to Macendale, who took over the identity in order to steal Ned's "notoriety" within the supervillain community.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #289, Spider-Man Vs Wolverine</ref>

Sadly Macendale's scheme was foiled by his own arrogance: not only was he exposed as the new Hobgoblin, but he lost several major battles against Spider-Man. This made Macendale a laughing stock in the supervillain community, who by this point knew of how he gained the costumed identity by way of murder.<ref>Web of Spider-Man #38</ref> 

His ultimate humiliation came when his attempt to steal the [[Green Goblin]]'s secret formula of superhuman strength ended in a failure at the hands of [[Harry Osborn]], who donned his father's Green Goblin costume to defeat him, even though Harry tells him the formula was lost years ago, which issues Macendale's  retreat.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #312</ref>

Said battle with Harry Osborn came just as the events of the Marvel crossover ''[[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]]'' began to unfold, as demons invaded New York City. Dejected and humiliated, Macendale foolishly offered to sell his [[soul]] to [[N'astirh]] in exchange for the power of a demon. N'astirh refuses the offer, considering Macendale's wretched soul to be worthless to him. However, in return for amusing the demon's twisted sense of humor, N'astirh fused a demon to Macendale anyway, just for making him laugh.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #147</ref>  Enhanced by the demon's power, Macendale would return to battle Spider-Man once again, nearly killing the web-slinger until he was saved by the intervention of [[Mary Jane Watson]].<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #160-161</ref>  

As an independent mercenary and criminal, Macendale would clash with many other heroes, including [[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]],<ref>''Spider-Man'' #6-7</ref> [[Sleepwalker (comics)|Sleepwalker]], [[Doctor Strange]], and [[Darkhawk]]. He would also join two reformed incarnations of the Sinister Six.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' # 335-339</ref><ref>''Spider-Man'' #18-23</ref> 

Eventually, Macendale's personality was overcome by the insane demon who shared his body, a condition made worse by Macendale's vanity; a side-effect of being bonded with a demon was that the villain's handsome facial features had been twisted into an exact replica of his Hobgoblin mask. To cope with his now inhuman appearance, Macendale began to consider himself an agent of God sent to Earth to kill sinners. This led him into conflict with Ghost Riders [[Ghost Rider (Danny Ketch)|Danny Ketch]] and [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]] and Spider-Man; during the battle, a blast from Johnny Blaze's "Hellfire Shotgun" destabilized the demon within Macendale, long enough for him to briefly regain his sanity. 

During a later four-way fight between Macendale, Spider-Man, [[Moon Knight]], and Doctor Strange, the heroes realized that Macendale's insanity was partly caused by despair over losing his handsome face. To try and calm the monsterous man/demon, Doctor Strange agreed to cast an illusion spell upon Macendale that caused Macendale to see his true face in reflections of himself. This helped Macendale enough that he was ultimately able to expel the demon from within himself, with the demon referring to itself as the [[Demogoblin]]. As Hobgoblin, Macendale was stiff-armed by [[Doctor Octopus]] into joining the 2nd incarnation of the group the Sinister Six, which twice tried to take over the world, failing due to counter measures by Spider-Man, the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], Ghost Rider, the [[Fantastic Four]], and many more heroes.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' # 335-339</ref><ref>''Spider-Man'' #18-23</ref> In a rare event, Macendale teamed up with Spider-Man to defeat the duo of Demogoblin and [[Doppelganger (comics)|Doppelganger]].<ref>''Spider-Man #24; Spirits of Vengeance #5</ref>

By this point, Macendale was desperate to regain his standing as a villain and attempted to assassinate Moon Knight and Nick Katzenberg on orders by the Foreigner, only to be stopped by both Moon Knight and Spider-Man. Coincidentally, Spider-Man turned him over to the authorities.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man #93-96; Spirits of Vengeance #6</ref>

Once more powerless, Macendale would return and obtain the strength formula of [[Kraven the Hunter]],<ref>''Spider-Man'' #47</ref> which enables him to easily defeat his demonic doppelganger, Demogoblin,<ref>''Spider-Man'' #47-49</ref> before Demogoblin ultimately died saving a young child in battle.<ref>''Spider-Man #24; Spirits of Vengeance #5</ref>

Macendale was defeated once more by Spider-Man along with [[Coldheart]], during an attempt to kidnap Jason's long-lost son. However, Macendale's reunion would be an unhappy one as Macendale attempted (unsuccessfully) to use his son as a hostage to avoid going back to jail. He would remain in jail for some time before being freed by [[Mendel Stromm|Gaunt]], sending him into combat against [[Ben Reilly]].<ref>''Spider-Man #69</ref> In exchange for doing Gaunt's bidding, the scientist turned Macendale into a cyborg, complete with removal of one of Macendale's eyes with a new high-tech cyborgnetic eye. He failed however and was once again arrested. 

It was at this point, that a tired and annoyed Jason Macendale went on trial for his vast laundry list of crimes. Found guilty of a laundry list of crimes, including acts caused by both the Roderick and Leeds Hobgoblin, a disgusted Macendale responded to his conviction by revealing that Ned Leeds "was" Hobgoblin. This revelation (done to give him reason to have his most of his convictions overturned), would be Macendale's undoing. This caused [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Roderick Kingsley]], fearful that Ned Leeds being outed as Hobgoblin would expose him being the brainwashed pawn of the real Hobgoblin (Kingsley), to break into the prison holding Macendale and to execute him. Firing a blast of pure energy from one of his gloved gauntlets, Kingsley mocked Macendale's failures as a villain before atomizing him.<ref>''Hobgoblin Lives''</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Macendale originally possessed no superhuman powers, but used similar paraphernalia to the Hobgoblin and Green Goblin; in both his Jack O'Lantern and Hobgoblin persona he used a glider and pumpkin bombs. Though Macendale never acquired the strength enhancing formula of the Green Goblin he did eventually acquire temporary super powers.

Macendale first acquired superhuman abilities in a deal with [[N'astirh]] in which a minor demon was grafted to him. These were the greatest abilities Macendale ever acquired, but they were temporary. This deal granted him super strength, speed, and agility (all though are below the level of Spider-Man), as well as hellfire powers enabling him to create a transport of flame at will. He quickly lost control of the demon causing him to go insane. The human and demon later split into two beings, resulting in the loss of those powers for Macendale. 

Eventually, Macendale managed to acquire the performance enhancing formula of Kraven the Hunter instead, which enhanced his strength, speed, stamina, durability, reflexes, and agility to  superhuman levels (less than Kraven due to having a weaker baseline athletic physique). As he was still no match for Spider-Man, Macendale later had his body augmented cybernetically, giving him greater superhuman strength, speed, reflexes, durability, and stamina.

==Personality, skills, and training==
Macendale had extensive military training in hand-to-hand combat, martial arts, espionage, and knowledge of conventional weaponry. He often used conventional military weapons. When he adopted the Hobgoblin persona he was able to make improvements to the maneuverability to the goblin glider, by utilizing skills he gained from his masters degrees in both mechanical engineering and physics.

Macendale was a sociopath and a sadist, which led to his dishonorable discharge from the military.
