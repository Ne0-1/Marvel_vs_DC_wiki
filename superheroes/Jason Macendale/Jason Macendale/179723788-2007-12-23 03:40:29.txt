'''Jason Philip Macendale''', Jr. is a fictional super-villain in the [[Marvel Universe]]. He was born in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], and was a former CIA agent.

He would become an enemy of [[Spider-Man]], as the first [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]] and later as the fourth [[Hobgoblin (comics)|The Hobgoblin]].

==Fictional character biography==

===Jack O'Lantern===
Jason Philip Macendale, Jr. was born in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].  His original alter ego was [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]], and he wore a flaming pumpkin mask and flew on a disc glider. His first appearance was in ''[[Machine Man]]'' #19.  He battled the aforementioned hero and was soundly defeated.

He later moved to make a permanent home in the family of [[Spider-Man villains]], beginning with ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #56. He had no super powers, hurling explosive grenades and hopping about on a "pogo platform".  

Jack O' Lantern next appears in ''Amazing Spiderman'' #254. He tries to steal the Hobgoblin battle van.    

Despite being a skilled armed and unarmed combattant due to his CIA training, Macendale's early career against Spider-Man was met with a string of humiliating failures, which did little to help his Underworld reputation. He was a minor villain in Spidey's rogues gallery until he formed an enmity with one of [[Hobgoblin (comics)|The Hobgoblin]]'s mind-controlled "stand-ins", [[Ned Leeds]].  

Macendale was obsessed with finding the secret formula of super human strength of the original Green Goblin. However, he did not have the scientific expertise of the Green Goblin or the original Hobgoblin to recreate or complete the formula, while his attempts to steal it from [[Harry Osborn]] failed as the latter did not have it at the time. After Osborn had donned the identity of the Green Goblin and beaten Macendale in a fight, the latter sought alternative means to gain similar abilities. Macendale wished to increase his underworld status and fearing the Leeds/Hobgoblin, hired assassins to kill the Goblin and took his arsenal for himself.  

===Hobgoblin===

As a Hobgoblin, Macendale failed to make any greater mark upon the Underworld.  He made various bizarre efforts to increase his threat-level, ingesting weird alchemies stolen from [[Kraven the Hunter]]'s lineage, and cybernetic implants provided by [[Norman Osborn]].  During this time, he would on least one occasion, attempt to rob a bank wearing his Jack O'Lantern armor, during which effort he was jailed and questioned by [[SHIELD]] as related in the [[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]] miniseries.

During a [[demon]]ic [[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|incursion on New York City]], Macendale foolishly offered to sell his [[soul]] to N'astirh in exchange for the power of a demon. N'astirh refused the offer, considering Macendale's wretched soul to be worthless to him.  However, in return for amusing the demon's twisted sense of humor, N'astirh fused a demon to Macendale anyway, just for making him laugh.  

Macendale went insane as a result of this transformation, and became convinced that he was appointed by [[God]] to kill [[sin]]ners. It was in this state that the Hobgoblin joined the temporarily reassembled [[Sinister Six]]. However, the two identities of Macendale and the demon fought fiercely over control of the body. Shortly thereafter, the demonic presence physically separated itself from Macendale and continued its purge of the city, calling itself the [[Demogoblin]]. The Demogoblin also wanted to destroy Macendale, and Spider-Man found himself in the middle of the two clashing Goblins. In a final battle in a [[cathedral]], the Demogoblin was destroyed when it moved to protect a child, which it deemed an innocent, and was crushed by a falling pillar. During the Acts of Vengeance, Hobgoblin was sent to attack Dr. Strange, but he was defeated by the Sorcerer Supreme.

Powerless once more, Macendale obtained the strength formula of [[Kraven the Hunter]]. Subsequently, he had himself outfitted with [[cybernetic]] implants, but he still was unable to best Spider-Man and was incarcerated. While in prison he was murdered by the original Hobgoblin. The character appeared in [[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]] storyline as a prisoner of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], but this was part of a flash back sequence to provide history for the story. It was later stated explicitly that the character had indeed been killed by the original Hobgoblin.  Roderick Kingsley, the true Hobgoblin, had allowed Macendale his claim on the goblin "franchise" to further hide his identity as the power behind the various incarnations of the Hobgoblin.

As the "second" Hobgoblin, Macendale was a member of several collections of Spider-Man's enemies, including the [[Sinister Six]].

==Powers and abilities==
Hobgoblin IV originally possessed no superhuman powers, but used similar paraphernalia to the first. After his attempts to force Harry to give him the Goblin formula, (which Harry didn't have) he made a deal with a demon during Inferno that turned him into a demon with super strength, speed, and agility, as well as hellfire powers. However, the human and demon later split into two beings, resulting in the loss of those powers for Macendale. Later he managed to acquire the performance enhancing formula of Kraven the Hunter instead, which enhanced his athletic abilities and senses, but the serum may have soon worn off like it did with Kraven. Kraven himself, an Olympic-level athlete, was only about half as strong as Spider-Man when using the formula so it is unlikely that Macendale was any stronger. Macendale later had his body augmented cybernetically.

Macendale did have superior military training in hand-to-hand combat, espionage, and knowledge of conventional weaponry than any other individual to bear the goblin mantle. He used conventional military weapons more often than his predecessor. He was able to make improvements to the maneuverability to the goblin glider. Macendale had masters degrees in both mechanical engineering and physics.

==In other media==

Hobgoblin has appeared in a lot of media. Although it is often unclear which Hobgoblin is present some are specifically Macendale.

===Television===

Macendale is the Hobgoblin in ''[[Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'', and is voiced by [[Mark Hamill]]. He makes numerous appearances, including a crossover with the [[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men Animated Series]]

===Video Games===
The [[NES]] game ''[[Spider-Man: Return of the Sinister Six]]'' had the third line-up of the [[Sinister Six]], which included Macendale.

===Toys===

The demonic version of Macendale appeared in the [[Spider-Man Classics]] line. This was reworked for the Sinister Six [[Marvel Legends]] set and then repainted for the Demogoblin figure.
