'''Jason Philip Macendale, Jr.''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appears in ''[[Machine Man]]'' #19 (Feb 1981), and was created by writer [[Tom DeFalco]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]].

==Fictional character biography==
'''Jason Philip Macendale''' is a mercenary and freelance terrorist/assassin, whose U.S. citizenship is revoked when he enlists in a foreign army, and later becomes a professional criminal. His original alter ego is [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]], and battles [[Machine Man]] in his first appearance. <ref>''[[Machine Man]]'' #19</ref> He later moves to make a permanent home in the family of [[Spider-Man villains]], after encountering [[Spider-Man]] for the first time.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #56</ref> He next tries to hijack the original [[Hobgoblin (comics)#Roderick Kingsley|Hobgoblin]]'s battle van.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #254</ref>

Wishing to increase his underworld status, Macendale hires assassins to kill [[Ned Leeds]] (who was believed to be the original Hobgoblin at that time)<ref>''Spider-Man Vs. Wolverine'' #1</ref> and takes his arsenal for himself, adopting the Hobgoblin identity.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #289</ref> Despite being the Hobgoblin, Macendale lacked the original's superpowers, and became obsessed with finding the [[Green Goblin]]'s secret formula of superhuman strength, attempting to steal it from [[Harry Osborn]], but fails as the latter did not have it at the time. <ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #312</ref>

During a [[demon]]ic [[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|incursion on New York City]], Macendale foolishly offers to sell his [[soul]] to [[N'astirh]] in exchange for the power of a demon. N'astirh refuses the offer, considering Macendale's wretched soul to be worthless to him. However, in return for amusing the demon's twisted sense of humor, N'astirh fuses a demon to Macendale anyway, just for making him laugh. <ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #147</ref>  Enhanced by the demon's power, Macendale would return to battle Spider-Man once again, nearly killing the web-slinger until he was saved by the intervention of [[Mary Jane Watson]].  As an independent mercenary and criminal, Macendale would clash with many other heroes, including [[Ghost_Rider_(comics)|Ghost Rider]], [[Sleepwalker_(comics)|Sleepwalker]], [[Doctor_Strange|Doctor Strange]], and [[Darkhawk]].  

Eventually, Macendale's personality was overcome by the insane demon who shared his body, and the creature became convinced that it had been appointed by [[God]] to kill [[sin]]ners. However, the two identities of Macendale and the demon fought fiercely over control of the body. Shortly thereafter, the demonic presence physically separated itself from Macendale and continued its purge of the city, calling itself the [[Demogoblin]]. Once more powerless, Macendale obtains the strength formula of [[Kraven the Hunter]], <ref>''Spider-Man'' #47</ref> which enables him to easily defeat his demonic doppelganger. <ref>''Spider-Man'' #48</ref>

Macendale is later hired by [[Mendel Stromm|Gaunt]] and further augments himself with cybernetic implants.

After being incarnated in prison, he is murdered by Roderick Kingsley, the true Hobgoblin, who had allowed Macendale his claim on the goblin "franchise" to further hide his identity as the power behind the various incarnations of the Hobgoblin. <ref>''Hobgoblin Lives''</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Macendale originally possessed no superhuman powers, but used similar paraphernalia to the Hobgolin and Greengoblin; in both his Jack'O'Lantern and Hobgoblin persona he used a glider and pumpkin bombs. Though, Macendale never acquired the strength enhancing formula of the Green Goblin he did eventually acquire temporary super powers.

Macendale first acquired superhuman abilities in a deal with [[N'astirh]] in which a minor demon was grafted to him. These were the greatest abilities Macendale ever acquired, but they were temporary. This deal granted him super strength, speed, and agility (all on par with Spider-Man), as well as hellfire powers enabling him to create a transport of flame at will. He quickly lost control of the demon causing him to go insane. The human and demon later split into two beings, resulting in the loss of those powers for Macendale. 

Eventually, Macendale managed to acquire the performance enhancing formula of Kraven the Hunter instead, which enhanced his strength and agility to near superhuman levels (less than Kraven due to having a weaker baseline athletic physique). As he was still no match for Spider-Man, Macendale later had his body augmented cybernetically.

==Personality, skills, and training==
Macendale had extensive military training in hand-to-hand combat, espionage, and knowledge of conventional weaponry. He often used conventional military weapons. When he adopted the Hobgoblin persona he was able to make improvements to the maneuverability to the goblin glider, by utilizing skills he gained from his masters degrees in both mechanical engineering and physics.

Macendale was a sociopath and a sadist, which led to his dishonorable discharge from the military.
