==Fictional character biography==
Dr. Toni Ho is [[Ho Yinsen]]'s daughter who is an engineer with three doctorates.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 4 #1</ref> 

She becomes a member of the rehabilitated [[Advanced Idea Mechanics#Avengers Idea Mechanics|Avengers Idea Mechanics]] after being bought out by [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]]. As part of the group, she serves as part of a support team for the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]].<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 4 #9</ref> Toni also studied Aikku Jokinen, the wearer of the sentient [[Pod (comics)|Pod]] suit. Toni took an interest in Aikku, not only due to Pod's suit but because she sympathizes with Aikku's personal reasons for not wanting to take Pod off. As Toni has fallen in love with Aikku, and Aikku reciprocated these feelings. Both were attacked by the [[Mister Fantastic|Maker]] and Toni donned her own Iron Man armor to defend Aikku and Pod. When Pod ejected Aikku to save her, Toni helps her love interest with the new undersuit.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 4  #13-15</ref>

Toni later uses her own Iron Patriot armor as a member of the [[U.S.Avengers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2016/07/01/marvel-is-creating-an-america-themed-avengers-led-by-a-british-writer-and-a-brazilian-mutant/|title=Marvel is creating an America-themed Avengers â€” led by a British writer and a Brazilian mutant|first=David|last=Betancourt|date=1 July 2016|accessdate=25 January 2018|website=Washingtonpost.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124005659/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2016/07/01/marvel-is-creating-an-america-themed-avengers-led-by-a-british-writer-and-a-brazilian-mutant/|archivedate=24 January 2018|df=}}</ref> In their first mission, the team encountered the [[Secret Empire (organization)|Secret Empire]] in their floating volcanic island base. They're later approached by a future version of [[Danielle Cage]] as Captain America when her nemesis, the Golden Skull, arrived in their timeline to steal all the wealth in the world. In [[Miami, Florida]], the team crashes a charity gala only to discover that the wealthy CEOs were kidnapped and replaced by robots. During the battle, the team manages to defeat and capture the Golden Skull, who was wearing a golden armored suit. Danielle then goes back to her timeline with the Golden Skull as her prisoner.<ref>''U.S.Avengers'' #1-3</ref>

During the "Opening Salvo" part of the ''[[Secret Empire (comic book)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, Aikku becomes concerned about Toni, since she's been spending too much time upgrading her armor.<ref>''U.S.Avengers'' #5</ref> During the event, the team arrives in [[Washington D.C.]] to confront Hydra when [[Robert Maverick|Red Hulk]] begins to attack them due to nanites that were injected in him, which start to control him. In an attempt to save them, Toni used a teleportation device to send Enigma and Squirrel Girl away, where they ended up in Paris. She and Red Hulk are then captured and imprisoned, when they see a nearly dead Roberto in one of the cells. While adjusting to prison life, Toni manages to save Roberto just in time when Hydra soldiers arrive at their cell. At the prison, Toni helps Roberto in the careful use of his powers to defeat the guards and free Red Hulk from the nanites controlling him, enabling them to take control of the prison. She then makes contact with Enigma, after she and Squirrel Girl help the Champions of Europe to defeat Hydra soldiers in Paris, and makes plans to have them return to the US. She also tells Enigma that she'll quit the Iron Patriot mantle so that their relationship can continue. During the course of this imprisonment, Toni lets go of some of her anger against Tony Stark, realizing that her father's sacrifice was a heroic act and should be honored. In the aftermath of the event, Toni deactivates the nanites inside Red Hulk, enabling him to return to normal. She's later approached by some A.I.M. agents who want her to become the organization's new leader after Roberto quits.<ref>''U.S.Avengers'' #6-10</ref> 

While travelling through space, Smasher and the U.S.Avengers are attacked by space pirates known as warpjackers. After a brief fight, the pirates tell them that Glenbrook is actually a planet named Kral X and that it's ruler, Ritchie Redwood, is ruthless. Arriving in Kral X, the heroes manage to help Cannonball and the planet's rebels in overthrowing Ritchie. After restoring order to the planet, the heroes head home.<ref>''U.S.Avengers'' #11-12</ref>
