'''Atomic Skull''' is the name of two different [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]]s.

==Fictional character biography==
===Albert Michaels===
Albert Michaels was a brilliant but distinctly unfriendly scientist-administrator at [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] with a rare nervous system disorder that short-circuited the electrical impulses in his brain, creating painful and uncontrollable [[seizures]]. When he couldn't find a cure, he secretly contacted the criminal organization [[SKULL (DC Comics)|SKULL]], and they implanted him with a [[radium]]-powered device designed to harness his neural disorder into deadly atomic "brain-blasts" in exchange for him becoming their agent. However, these mental blasts were difficult to control and only made his condition worse, a situation he blamed on [[Superman]] after the Man of Steel captured the only SKULL scientists that could have cured him. Swearing revenge, the [[evil genius]] donned his distinctive yellow and green costume with its visored cowl-topped [[skull]] mask and eventually became the organization's leader, flying around in a sleek skull-shaped [[hovercraft]] of his own design assisted by his similarly costumed lover Felicia who was a [[panther]] he had artificially [[evolution|evolved]] into human form. 

Following ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', Michaels made one appearance, battling [[Thunder and Lightning (comics)|Thunder and Lightning]] in ''[[Teen Titans|Teen Titans Spotlight]]''. It is assumed his background has not changed, although instead of being diagnosed with a nervous disorder, it was said that his powers came because he sought immortality and presumably mutated himself. It is not known if he ever fought the Post-Crisis version of Superman before as his first (Post-Crisis) appearance was in ''[[Captain Atom]]'', yet his history with S.T.A.R. Labs and SKULL remained as established in ''The DC Comics Encyclopedia''.

The original Atomic Skull returned in 2007 in the book ''[[Birds of Prey (comic)|Birds of Prey]]''<ref>''Birds of Prey'' #110, November, 2007</ref>. Michaels also appeared in the miniseries ''[[Villains United]]'', where he joined Luthor's Society.<ref>''Villains United'' #5</ref>

===Joseph Martin===
Student Joseph Martin was struck by an intense blast of energy from the [[Dominators]]' gene-bomb that gave him superhuman strength and caused his flesh to become invisible. Later attacked by some thugs, the resulting [[brain damage]] caused insanity, and he took on the guise of "The Atomic Skull" who was a hero from an old [[movie serial]] that he loved. He also emitted dangerous amounts of [[radiation]], later gaining the ability to project it as energy blasts. He has plagued [[Superman]], whom he believed to be the serial's villain Doctor Electron, and [[Lois Lane]], whom he saw as the Skull's love interest, Zelda Wentworth.<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation  | last = Greenberger  | first = Robert | author-link = | contribution = Atomic Skull | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 31  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = London  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5}}</ref>

He was later given enhanced powers by the demon [[Neron]] in exchange for his soul.<ref>''Underworld Unleashed'' #1</ref>  Cured of his delusions, he at first intended to follow the character's example for real as a superhero, but has since appeared as a more conventional villain.

He is killed in battle by the [[Maximums]],<ref>''Superman/Batman'' #21</ref> an alternate reality superhero team, but is later seen alive in the pages of ''Action Comics'',<ref>''Action Comics'' #853</ref> assuming Mr. Mxyptlk reversed his death along with other events having to do with the Maximums.

Recently, Martin crashed a movie premiere in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]], having become obsessed with an actress who was in the film. He was defeated by [[Manhunter (Kate Spencer)|Manhunter]] <ref>''Manhunter'' (vol. 2) #31</ref>.

Martin was among the villains in the ambush of the [[Justice Society of America|JSA]] led by [[Tapeworm (comics)|Tapeworm]].<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #29</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The original Atomic Skull can deliver powerful energy bolts through the visor of his mask.

Joseph Martin has superhuman strength, agility and endurance. He has the ability to project blasts of radioactive energy.

==Other versions==
* The Atomic Skull is the name of Joseph Martin's favorite hero from a (fictional) 12-episode movie serial made by National Film Studios in 1936. The serial stars Lawrence Dennis (according to ''Superman Villains Secret Files'') as the titular character. This Atomic Skull was originally government agent Joe Martin who investigated the evil Doctor Electron and was transformed into the hideous Atomic Skull by one of Electron's inventions. Despite that, he and Zelda Wentworth, Electron's daughter (played by actress Eleanor Hart, whom [[Lois Lane]] has a passing resemblance to<ref>''Superman: The Essential Guide to the Man of Steel'', p. 100</ref>), fell in love. Battling Electron and his minions (such as Rocketman) with his heat ray eye-blasts, the Atomic Skull eventually destroyed the mad scientist's plans and returned to normal. The [[fictional character]] from the serial is visually identical to the pre-Crisis version.
* In a story featuring the reality-altering villain [[Dominus (DC Comics)|Dominus]] recreating various pre-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] Superman continuities, the supposed [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] Atomic Skull was first introduced. He was Albert Michaels, an actor and [[Nazism|Nazi]] sympathizer who used his reputation as the hero of the ''Curse of the Atomic Skull'' serial as a platform to promote Nazism.
* Atomic Skull is featured in the alternate reality ''[[Superman: Red Son]]'' as one of [[Lex Luthor]]'s experiments.

==In other media==
[[Image:Atomic Skull jlu.jpg|125px|thumb|right|Atomic Skull in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''.]]
* The Joseph Martin version of the Atomic Skull appears in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' voiced by [[Lex Lang]]. He first appears in "The Cat and the Canary" as [[Wildcat (comics)|Wildcat]]'s main opponent at [[Roulette (DC Comics)|Roulette]]'s Meta-Brawl until [[Green Arrow]] and [[Black Canary]] interrupted the match. In "I Am Legion," Atomic Skull later returns as a member of [[Gorilla Grodd]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]]. In the episodes "Alive" and "Destroyer," he sides with Luthor during the mutiny during the two-part series finale. He is found among the survivors of [[Darkseid]]'s attack. He and Luthor insist that the surviving villains help the heroes during the defense of Earth against the forces of [[Apokolips]]. He fights alongside [[Hawkgirl]] and [[Commander Steel]] in Washington DC. He is last seen taking advantage of the "five-minute [[Head start (positioning)|head start]]" the Justice League grants the surviving villains at the end of the final episode (notably he is the one who vocally opposes being arrested after helping save the world from Darkseid's forces).
