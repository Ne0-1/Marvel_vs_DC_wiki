'''Atomic Skull''' is the name of two different [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]]s.

==History==
===Albert Michaels===
Albert Michaels was a scientist at [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] with a nervous disorder. When he couldn't find a cure, he contacted the criminal organization [[SKULL (DC Comics)|SKULL]] and they gave him a way to harness his neural disorder into atomic blasts. He became the organization's leader. SKULL is the DC Universe's version of [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] (Advanced Idea Mechanics) an organization of criminal super scientists.

Following ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', Michaels made one appearance, battling [[Thunder and Lightning (comics)|Thunder and Lightning]] in ''[[Teen Titans]] Spotlight''. It is assumed his background has not changed, although it is not known if he fought Superman.

===Joe Martin===

Joe Martin was struck by an intense blast of energy that gave him superhuman strength and premature baldness. Later attacked by some thugs, the resulting head damage caused insanity and he took on the guise of "The Atomic Skull" who was a hero from an old movie serial. He also emitted dangerous amounts of radiation, then later gained the ability to project it as energy blasts. He has plagued [[Superman]], whom he believed to be the serial's villain, and [[Lois Lane]], whom he saw as the Skull's love interest. 

Cured of his delusions, he at first intended to follow the character's example for real as a superhero, but has since appeared as a more conventional villain.

===Alternate version===

In a story featuring the reality-altering villain [[Dominus (DC Comics)|Dominus]] recreating various pre-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] Superman continuities, the [[Golden Age of Comics|Golden Age]] Atomic Skull was introduced. He was Albert Michaels, an actor and [[Nazi]] sympathiser who used his reputation as the hero of the ''Curse of the Atomic Skull'' serial as a platform to promote Nazism (in the unaltered [[DC Universe]] the star of the serial was named Lawrence Dennis, according to ''Superman Villans Secret Files'').

In ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', the Atomic Skull was [[Wildcat (comics)|Wildcat]]'s main opponent at [[Roulette (DC Comics)|Roulette]]'s Meta-Brawl until [[Green Arrow]] and [[Black Canary]] interrupted the match. Atomic Skull later returns as a member of [[Gorilla Grodd]]'s [[Legion of Doom]], and sides with Luthor during the mutiny during the two-part series finale; he survives [[Darkseid]]'s attack, fights alongside [[Hawkgirl]] and [[Steel (comics)|Steel II]] during the defense of Earth against the forces of [[Apokolips]], and is last seen taking advantage of the 'five-minute head start' the Justice League grants the surviving villains at the end of the final episode. He is voiced by [[Lex Lang]].
