'''Woozy Winks''' is the [[sidekick]] to the [[DC Comics]] superhero [[Plastic Man]]. He is a bumbling, inept, overweight and slobbish man who served primarily as a comic relief, much like other golden age sidekicks such as [[Doiby Dickles]]. At first Woozy was gifted with his own super powers; after saving a witch's life a spell was cast on him which caused the forces of nature to protect him when needed. This has since been erased from continuity and he is now nothing more than a bufoon who tags along with Plastic Man. His personality was based on the comedy of [[Lou Costello]].

One history of Woozy, which appeared in the Plastic Man Special in [[1999]], gave him an alternative origin. In this tale he was an extremely competent and intelligent agent known as "Green Cobra" whose only oddities were his dress-sense and a tendency to steal office supplies. After being paired together for the first time, he was trapped in a poorly ventilated locker with a wounded Plastic Man. The fumes from Plas's blood, which was similar in composition to [[glue sniffing|airplane glue]] damaged Winks' brain, making  him "Woozy" forever more. It should be noted that this is contradicted both by his golden age and modern origins, in which he is depicted as having always been dimwitted.
