Woozy Winks is the [[sidekick]] to the [[DC Comics]] superhero [[Plastic Man]]. He is a bumbling, inept, overweight and slobbish man who served primarily as a comic relief, much like other golden age sidekicks such as [[Doiby Dickles]]. At first Woozy was gifted with his own super powers; after saving a witch's life a spell was cast on him which caused the forces of nature to protect him when needed. This has since been erased from continuity and he is now nothing more than a bufoon who tags along with Plastic Man. His personality was based on the comedy of [[Lou Costello]].
