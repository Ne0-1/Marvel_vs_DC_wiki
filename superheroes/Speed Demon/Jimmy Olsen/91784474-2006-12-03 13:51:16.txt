'''Jimmy Olsen''' (full name '''James Bartholomew Olsen''') is a [[fictional character]] who appears in [[DC Comics]]’ [[Superman]] stories. Created by writer [[Jerry Siegel]] and artist [[Joe Shuster]], he first appeared as an anonymous "copy boy" in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #6 in 1938, but first appeared by name in ''Superman'' (volume 1) #13 in 1941.

Jimmy is traditionally depicted as a [[bow tie]]-wearing, [[red hair|red-haired]] young man who works as a cub [[reporter]] and [[photographer]] for ''The [[Daily Planet]]'', alongside [[Lois Lane]] and [[Clark Kent]], whom he idolizes as career role models. In most depictions of the character, he also has a strong friendship with Superman. As Superman's friend, Jimmy has special access to the Man of Steel, thanks to Superman's gift to Jimmy of a "signal [[watch]]," a wristwatch which with the press of a button emits a special [[ultrasonic]] frequency signal that Superman can hear anywhere on Earth.

In many [[Silver Age of comic books|Silver Age]] [[comic books]], Jimmy was often seen sharing adventures with Superman, who saved him from various predicaments ranging from dangerous to merely embarrassing. This was particularly pronounced in the series ''[[Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen (comic)|Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen]]'' (published from 1954 to 1974), which saw Olsen in a variety of [[slapstick]] adventures and strange transformations. Like most DC characters, [[Modern Age of Comic Books|modern]] portrayals of Olsen have been more serious in tone.

An important part of the Superman mythos, Jimmy Olsen has appeared in most other media adaptations of the character.

==History==
===Golden and Silver Age versions===
[[Image:Jimmyolsen.png|thumb|left|Jimmy Olsen, from ''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen'' #36 ([[1959]]). Art by [[Curt Swan]].]]

During the Silver Age, Jimmy starred in his own comic book, ''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen'', which featured his various adventures with and without Superman; it debuted in [[1954]]. The stories in the title would often feature particularly outlandish situations, ranging from Jimmy being hurled back in time to [[Krypton (planet)|Krypton]] before its destruction in issue #36 to dealing frequently with [[gorillas in comic books|gorillas]] of all sorts. Because of these factors, the comic was regarded by some as a poorly written subsidiary title, although some readers still enjoy it for its [[camp (style)|camp]] value. 

The major exception to this was in the early [[1970s]], when the singular writer/artist [[Jack Kirby]] took over the title and created his own distinctive stories as part of [[Jack Kirby's Fourth World]], which introduced many additions to the [[DC Universe]], including the [[supervillain]] [[Darkseid]] and [[Project Cadmus]].  The series revolved around Project Cadmus, and the genetic experiments held there, most notably [[cloning]]. The series ended in [[1974]] with issue #163, when Jimmy's book was folded into the [[anthology]] title ''[[Superman Family]]''. In that book, Olsen became a more serious character who battled criminals as an [[investigative reporter]] in urban crime stories that rarely involved Superman.

====The many transformations of Jimmy Olsen====
Especially in the days of the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]], Jimmy would often find himself temporarily transformed, for better or worse, or undergo a disguise for various purposes. The transformation tradition is still sometimes referenced in current day comics, usually through [[homage]] or [[parody]]. The following is a partial list of some of the various forms and powers that Jimmy has experienced:
*Giant Turtle Boy: One of Jimmy's most frequently cited transformations was that of his turning into a giant turtle boy in ''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen'' #53 ([[1961]]).
*Elastic Lad - Whether by serum or by alien virus, Jimmy could sometimes stretch himself, akin to [[Plastic Man]] or [[Mister Fantastic]]. Jimmy first appeared as Elastic Lad in ''Jimmy Olsen'' #37 ([[1959]]).
[[Image:FlamebirdI.jpg|150px|thumb|Superman as Nightwing (left) and Jimmy Olsen as Flamebird (right) in the bottle city of [[Kandor]]. Art by [[Curt Swan]].]]
*[[Flamebird]]- name he took as a costumed superhero, with Superman disguised as [[Nightwing]], in the shrunken [[Krypton (planet)|Kryptonian]] city of [[Kandor]]. These names were inspired by two native Kryptonian [[birds]], the nightwing and the flamebird.  
*Speed Demon - In [[1956]], a month before the debut of [[Barry Allen]] as the new [[Flash (comics)|Flash]], Jimmy drank a potion produced by a Professor Claude and briefly gained super-speed.
*Radioactive - After being exposed himself, Jimmy began to irradiate everything in his presence.
*Gorilla - Jimmy switched minds with a gorilla in ''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen'' #24 (reprinted in #114).  He went about his reporting duties as a gorilla in Jimmy's clothes.
*Monstrous beard growth - The machinations of the sinister Beard Band cause Jimmy to grow an immense [[beard]].
*Alien-form - [[Extraterrestrial life in culture|Aliens]] transformed Jimmy into a telepathic [[Jupiter (planet)|Jovian]].
*Wolf-Man - In the vein of the popular [[Michael Landon]] 1950's film ''[[I Was a Teenage Werewolf]]'', Jimmy found himself transformed into a [[werewolf]] in ''Jimmy Olsen'' #44 ([[1960]]).
*Hippie - Jimmy grew a beard and joined a Superman-hating band of [[hippie]]s in ''Jimmy Olsen'' #118 ([[1969]]). On the cover of this story's issue, Jimmy's seen wielding a rather humorous sign saying "Superman is a freak-out!"
*Viking - Jimmy put on viking armor and mistakenly thought he'd been transported 1000 years backward in time.
*[[Transvestite]] - Jimmy would occasionally go undercover dressed as a woman, such as in ''Jimmy Olsen'' #44 (1960).  Grant Morrison paid a brief homage to this in ''All Star Superman'' #4.
*[[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] - Also in ''All Star Superman'' #4, Jimmy takes a serum and becomes a version of Superman's foe Doomsday.
*A [[genie]]
*A six-armed man
*A [[fire-breather]]
*A [[water-breather]]
*A human [[porcupine]], in ''Jimmy Olsen'' #65 ([[1962]]).
*A [[gorilla]]'s husband
*Superman on another planet, but he got upset because the civilian knew who he was.

===Modern Age version===
Despite recent modernization efforts, Jimmy Olsen has not been significantly changed in the Modern Age. He is still a cub reporter working for ''The Daily Planet'', and is still friends with Superman. His look was made over as he stopped wearing bowties, and started wearing casual clothing (though this trend started in 1970s comics). An interesting alteration to the relationship was that Jimmy designed the signal watch himself, leading to his first meeting with Superman (''World of Metropolis'' #4). Superman briefly considered confiscating the watch, but decided he trusted Jimmy to use it responsibly.

While weird transformations no longer occur as regularly as they did in the Silver Age, Jimmy did become Elastic Lad on contact with the [[Eradicator (comics)|Eradicator]]. He has also taken the identity of "Giant Turtle Boy" in a series of [[pizza]] [[commercials]], made when he was temporarily laid off from the Planet.

In the late [[1990s]], Jimmy moved to Metropolis broadcaster Galaxy Broadcasting, where he became more brash and arrogant. This came to an end when he thought (wrongly) he had discovered Superman's [[secret identity]] and said he would announce it live on air. He reconsidered his actions, but lost his job for wasting the timeslot. He was again rehired by the Planet.

June [[2003]] saw Jimmy Olsen as the focus of a twelve-part miniseries entitled ''Superman: Metropolis''. Written by [[Chuck Austen]] and illustrated by [[Danijel Zezelj]], the series focused on the futuristic [[technology]] unleashed in Metropolis by [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]] in a previous storyline, and how it affected the everday lives of Metropolis citizens.

Recently, Jimmy had taken a position as a regular star reporter for ''The Daily Planet'', replacing the recently demoted Clark Kent. This caused a strain in the relationship between Clark and Jimmy. It appears, however, that following the [[One Year Later]] storyline jump, Clark has regained his original role as ''The Daily Planet'''s star reporter, and Jimmy has returned to being a photographer, winning the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for his photographic efforts.

==Awards==
[[Jack Kirby]] received a [[Shazam Award]] (for "Special Achievement By an Individual") for his work on ''Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen''.

==Alternate versions==
*In [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s [[2001]] [[graphic novel]] ''Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again'' Jimmy Olsen is featured as the writer of a ''Daily Planet'' article entitled "Truth to Power", where he attempted to reveal that the current President was a holographic projection. However, his attempts to publisicise the truth were halted by [[Lex Luthor]].
*In ''[[JLA: The Nail]]'', an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate reality]] in which a nail punctured the Kents' car, preventing them from finding the spaceship containing a baby Superman, Jimmy Olsen is revealed as the one behind all the other superheroes' troubles. Jimmy had served as an aide to [[Lex Luthor]] following various short-lived attempts at heroism caused by temporary alteration of his DNA. Having discovered Superman's spaceship, using the samples to create numerous [[Bizarro]] [[Clone (genetics)|clone]]s, Luthor grafted [[Krypton (planet)|Kryptonian]] [[DNA]] onto Jimmy- the only such 'graft' that appeared successful, as other subjects either died instantly or mutated before death. This caused Jimmy to go insane and possess superpowers similar to Superman's, as well as mentally transforming him into a Kryptonian, determined to replace human life with Kryptonian. Jimmy played up the public's fear of superheroes via [[propaganda]], hoping to have them imprisoned so he could use their [[DNA]] as well in an attempt to create a stable template. When Jimmy attacked an [[Amish]] couple and their son during a battle with the [[Justice League|JLA]], culminating in a desperate attempt by [[Batman]] and [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]] to stop his by supercharging Batman with his ring, the couple was killed, but the son was revealed to be Superman. In this alternate reality, the Amish couple had raised Superman, and brought him up as a [[pacifism|pacifist]], so he had never used his powers in conflict. Jimmy asked Superman to join him, claiming that they were virtually brothers as they shared the same DNA, but when Superman refused, the two battled. During the battle, Jimmy's body started to refuse the Kryptonian DNA, causing him to disintegrate. The JLA then asked Superman to join them.
* In [[Superman: Red Son]], Jimmy is depicted as an agent of the [[CIA]], eventually becoming the director, and soon joins Luthor in his Presidential bid and becomes [[Vice-President]].
{{spoiler}}
* In [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Frank Quitely]]'s [[All-Star Superman]] series, Jimmy shows up briefly in the Daily Planet offices in argyle socks; this Jimmy seems to be a refined version of the Silver Age vintage, with a signal watch halfway between McDonalds [[happy meal]] toy and [[haute couture]]. He's also shown with something that may be a jetpack. #4 of the series focuses on Jimmy and his adventures as the one-day director of the DNA P.R.O.J.E.C.T., a leftover from the Kirby-era Jimmy Olsen series.
