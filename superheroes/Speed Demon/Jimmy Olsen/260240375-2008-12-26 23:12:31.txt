'''James Bartholomew "Jimmy" Olsen''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[photojournalist]] who appears mainly in [[DC Comics]]â€™ [[Superman]] stories. An anonymous "copy boy" who resembles Olsen makes a brief appearance in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #6, but the character called Jimmy Olsen first appeared in the radio show, ''[[The Adventures of Superman (radio)|The Adventures of Superman]]'', on April 15, 1940. The character moved from the radio show into the comics in 1941,  first appearing in ''Superman'' v1 #13 (1941).  Along with his appearances in current ''Superman'' titles (''Superman'' 
and ''Action Comics''), he was one of the main protagonists in DC Comics' weekly series ''[[Countdown (DC Comics)|Countdown]]''. He has appeared in most [[Superman in other media|media interpretations of Superman]]. He was portrayed by [[Jack Larson]] in the ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]'' television show; [[Marc McClure]] in the [[Superman film series|''Superman'' films]] of the 1970s and '80s, as well as the [[1984 in film|1984]] film ''[[Supergirl (film)|Supergirl]]''; [[Michael Landes]] in the first season of ''[[Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'' and [[Justin Whalin]] in the subsequent three seasons; [[Sam Huntington]] in the [[2006 in film|2006]] film ''[[Superman Returns]]''; and [[Aaron Ashmore]] in the show ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]''.

==Fictional character profile==
Jimmy is traditionally depicted as a [[bow tie]]-wearing, [[red hair|red-haired]] young man who works as a cub [[reporter]] and [[photographer]] for ''The [[Daily Planet]]'', alongside [[Lois Lane]] and [[Clark Kent]], whom he idolizes as career role models. In most depictions of the character, he also has a strong friendship with Superman. As Superman's friend, Jimmy has special access to the Man of Steel, thanks to Superman's gift to Jimmy of a "signal [[watch]]," a wristwatch which, with the press of a button, emits a special [[ultrasonic]] frequency signal that Superman can hear anywhere on Earth. (In [[Post-Crisis]] continuity Jimmy invented the watch himself, and Superman briefly considered confiscating it. In [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|New Earth]] continuity, the watch was designed by Superman based on a larger signalling device Jimmy created.)

In many [[Silver Age of comic books|Silver Age]] [[comic books]], Jimmy was often seen sharing adventures with Superman, who saved him from various predicaments ranging from dangerous to merely embarrassing. This was particularly pronounced in the series ''[[Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen (comic)|Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen]]'' (published from 1954 to 1974), which saw Olsen in a variety of [[slapstick]] adventures and strange transformations. Like most DC characters, [[Modern Age of Comic Books|modern]] portrayals of Olsen have been more serious in tone.

An important part of the Superman mythos, Jimmy Olsen has appeared in most other media adaptations of the character.

"[[Olsen (surname)|Olsen]]" is a common [[Scandinavia|Scandinavian]] name, especially [[Denmark|Danish]],  indicating that the character is likely to be of a [[Danish American]] origin. However, other than the name there was never any indication of a Danish background about him.

==Fictional character biography==
===Golden and Silver Age===
{{main|History of Superman}}
[[Image:Jimmyolsen.png|thumb|left|Jimmy Olsen, from ''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen'' #36 (1959). Art by [[Curt Swan]].]]

During the Silver Age, Jimmy starred in his own comic book, ''[[Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen]]'', which featured his various adventures with and without Superman; it debuted in 1954. The stories in the title would often feature particularly outlandish situations, ranging from Jimmy being hurled back in time to [[Krypton (planet)|Krypton]] before its destruction in issue #36 to dealing frequently with [[gorillas in comic books|gorillas]] of all sorts.

This version of Jimmy Olsen even had his own fan club. In one adventure published in the 1960s, he implied that there were branches of it around the [[United States|country]] and that he intended to lecture them about anti-crime techniques he had learned from Superman and [[Batman]]. <ref>illustration included in the ''Penguin Book of Comics'' by George Perry and Alan Aldridge, published in 1967.</ref>

===Jack Kirby's Fourth World===
Kirby began by introducing a secret "D.N.A. Project" to create Mutated Humans for Good, also adding "The Hairies" (a group of technology-equipped hippies) and superbeings from other planets (proto-New Gods) and Intergang and Morgan Edge... and reintroduced his 1940s Newsboy Legion characters.

About halfway through his run, Kirby also added vampires, the Loch Ness monster, and Victor Volcanum, the fire-eating archcriminal. Readership quickly dropped back to its pre-Jack-Kirby levels.

Jack's tenure on the series ended in 1974 with issue #163, when Jimmy's book was folded into the [[anthology]] title ''[[Superman Family]]''. In that book, Olsen became a more serious character who battled criminals as an [[investigative reporter]] known as "Mr. Action" in urban crime stories that rarely involved Superman.

===Modern adventures===
====''The Man of Steel''====
Following ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', the entire Superman mythos was rebooted from scratch in the limited series ''The Man of Steel''.  Despite recent modernization efforts on Superman and his supporting characters, Jimmy Olsen has not been significantly changed in the Modern Age. He is still a cub reporter working for ''The Daily Planet'', and is still friends with Superman. His look was made over as he stopped wearing bowties, and started wearing casual clothing (though this trend started in 1970s comics). An interesting alteration to the relationship was that Jimmy designed the signal watch himself, leading to his first meeting with Superman.<ref name="WoM4">''World of Metropolis'' #4 (1987)</ref> Superman briefly considered confiscating the watch, but decided he trusted Jimmy to use it responsibly.

While Jimmy's transformations no longer occur as regularly as they did in the Silver Age, Jimmy did become Elastic Lad on contact with the [[Eradicator (comics)|Eradicator]]. He has also taken the identity of "Turtle Boy" in a series of [[pizza]] [[commercials]], made when he was temporarily laid off from the ''Planet''.

In the 1990s, Jimmy moved to Metropolis broadcaster Galaxy Broadcasting, where he became more brash and arrogant. This came to an end when he thought (wrongly) he had discovered Superman's [[secret identity]] and said he would announce it live on air. He reconsidered his actions, but lost his job for wasting the timeslot. He was again rehired by the ''Planet''.

Jimmy later came under the angry hand of the [[Alpha Centurion]], an alternate universe dictator with a deep-seated hatred for Superman and an eye toward Lois Lane. It was Jimmy who first uncovered his secret plot to control the world's finances through his company Aelius Industries, Inc.

====''Superman: Metropolis''====
June 2003 saw Jimmy Olsen as the focus of a twelve-part miniseries entitled ''Superman: Metropolis''. Written by [[Chuck Austen]] and illustrated by Danijel Zezelj, the series focused on the futuristic [[technology]] unleashed in Metropolis by [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]] in a previous storyline, and how it affected the everyday lives of Metropolis citizens.

Recently, Jimmy had taken a position as a regular star reporter for ''The Daily Planet'', replacing the recently demoted Clark Kent. This caused a strain in the relationship between Clark and Jimmy. It appears, however, that following the [[One Year Later]] storyline jump, Clark has regained his original role as ''The Daily Planet'''s star reporter,<ref>''52: Week Eight'' (2006)</ref><ref name="SM650">''Superman'' #650 (2006)</ref> and Jimmy has returned to being a photographer, winning the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for his photographic efforts.

====''Countdown''====
[[Image:Jimmyolsencountdown.jpg|Jimmy Olsen as Mr. Action. Cover art for ''Countdown'' #38, by Shane Davis.|thumb]] 
{{main|Countdown to Final Crisis}}
Jimmy's story in the 2007-08 weekly series ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]'' begins with an investigation into the death of [[Duela Dent]]. Tying into the ''[[Death of the New Gods]]'' storyline, Jimmy starts to develop a plethora of new superpowers, which he first discovers when he is attacked by [[Killer Croc]] while gathering information on Duela's death. As the story progresses he tries to uncover the origin of these powers and starts to discover their potential limitlessness in stories which mimic the Silver Age ''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen'' adventures. Briefly operating as the superhero "Mr. Action", Jimmy is unable to command the respect of established superheroes in the JLA and [[Teen Titans]], and gives up on this particular avenue. One of these powers allows Jimmy to realize the identities of some superheroes, such as the Robins and Superman, who requests that he take care of [[Krypto]].

Jimmy is eventually tracked down by the New God [[Forager (comics)|Forager]], with whom he begins a romantic relationship. Forager informs him that he has become a soulcatcher for the spirits of dying New Gods. The [[Monitors (comics)|Monitor]] known as Solomon later tells him that his new powers are the consequence of Darkseid using Jimmy as a host for powers he wishes to use to recreate the universe in his image, knowing that "Superman's pal" is one of the world's most well-protected citizens. Later, as the events of ''Countdown'' begin to come to their close, Jimmy becomes a more confidently powerful character and is reunited with the series' other cast members on a mission to stop [[Karate Kid (comics)|Karate Kid]]'s disease from becoming a pandemic of apocalyptic proportions. Unfortunately, they fail, and the Morticoccus virus devastates an alternate Earth.

Upon return to their Earth, Jimmy is captured by [[Mary Marvel]], who had been manipulated towards evil by Darkseid. When Superman comes to save Jimmy, Darkseid takes control of the powers within him, causing Jimmy to radiate Kryptonite radiation, until [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Ray Palmer]] manages to rewire Darkseid's control from inside of Jimmy. Jimmy then transforms into a giant turtlelike creature, and prepares to take on Darkseid himself. Darkseid overcomes Jimmy, and prepares to kill him. Ray Palmer then comes out of Jimmy with the New God soul battery, and destroys it, returning Jimmy to normal.

====''Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen Special''====
{{main|Superman: New Krypton}}
During Superman's fight with [[Atlas (DC Comics)|Atlas]] he witnessed a [[Codename: Assassin|mysterious figure]] hovering over the fight.  After some encouraging words from Clark Kent, he decides to take two weeks off to investigate this.

He tracked down a figure connected with the past of [[Codename: Assassin|Jonathan Drew]] and was told the story of how Jonathan became Codename: Assassin.  His informant is quickly executed by Codename: Assassin who then proceeded to try to kill Jimmy.  Jimmy was able to hide from Codename: Assassin and was apparently shielded from Codename: Assassin's telepathy due to his many, many transformations over the years.

He goes to [[Project Cadmus]] and speaks to [[Dubbilex]] who tells him the story about the death of the original [[Guardian (DC Comics)|Guardian]] at the hands of Codename: Assassin and how cloning is such an imperfect science that the only viable clone alive went into hiding in the desert.  Dubbilex promptly dies from injuries sustained in an earlier conflict with Codename: Assassin.  Jimmy then heads south to the town of Warpath, AZ and avoids conflict with Codename: Assassin on the way.

When in Warpath he interviews the sheriff, [[Greg Saunders]], who evades his questions.  He follows him after dark and sees him working with [[Guardian (DC Comics)|the last Guardian clone]].  He then confronts the clone at his home and the two speak.

With his two weeks up, Jimmy returns to Metropolis horrified by what he has learned, a faction within the US military is actively plotting to kill Superman...

==Powers, abilities, and equipment==
[[Image:Jimmyolsentransformations.jpg|Cover art for ''The Amazing Transformations of Jimmy Olsen'', by [[Brian Bolland]].|thumb]]

Jimmy possesses a watch which emits a high-pitched signal only Superman can hear.

Especially in the days of the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]], Jimmy would often find himself temporarily transformed, for better or worse, or undergo a disguise for various purposes. The transformation tradition is still sometimes referenced in present-day comics, usually through [[homage]] or [[parody]]. The variety of transformations Jimmy received during the Silver Age is often homaged or parodied in later comics and adaptations featuring the character &mdash; for instance, in ''[[JLA: The Nail]]'', Jimmy cites three of these transformations as his motivations behind backing Luthor's bill to outlaw metahumans and in ''Countdown'', Jimmy is used as a spirit container for the deceased New Gods, causing him to exhibit strange powers, albeit uncrontrollably,  with other stories simply make passing references.

* Giant Turtle Boy: One of Jimmy's most frequently cited transformations was that of his turning into a giant turtle boy.<ref name="pal53">''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen'' #53 (1961)</ref>
* Elastic Lad - As Elastic Lad, Jimmy (by serum or by alien virus) could sometimes stretch himself, akin to [[Elongated Man]] or [[Plastic Man]].<ref name="pal37">''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen'' #37 (1959)</ref> 
* [[Flamebird]]- This is the name he took as a costumed superhero, with Superman disguised as [[Nightwing]], in the shrunken [[Krypton (planet)|Kryptonian]] city of [[Kandor]]. These names were inspired by two native Kryptonian [[birds]], the nightwing and the flamebird, but the relationship between Nightwing and Flamebird intentionally paralleled the crime-fighting team [[Batman]] (a night-winged creature) and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] (a flame-colored bird). 
* Speed Demon - In [[1956]], a month before the debut of [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] as the new [[Flash (comics)|Flash]], Jimmy drank a potion produced by a Professor Claude and briefly gained super-speed. 
* Radioactive - After being exposed to a radioactive substance, Jimmy began to irradiate everything in his presence.
* Gorilla - When Jimmy switched minds with a gorilla in, he went about his reporting duties as a gorilla in Jimmy's clothes.<ref name="pal24">''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen'' #24</ref>
* Monstrous beard growth - The machinations of the sinister Beard Band cause Jimmy to grow an immense [[beard]].
* Alien-form - [[Extraterrestrial life in culture|Aliens]] transformed Jimmy into a telepathic [[Jupiter (planet)|Jovian]] for a week. Fortunately, this turned out to be a Jovian week ... which is much shorter than an Earth week (about 70 hours = slightly less than three days.)
* Wolf-Man - In the vein of the popular [[Michael Landon]] 1950s film ''[[I Was a Teenage Werewolf]]'', Jimmy found himself transformed into a [[werewolf]].<ref name="pal44">''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen'' #44 (1960)</ref>
* Hippie - Jimmy grew a beard and joined a Superman-hating band of [[hippie]]s.<ref name="pal118">''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen'' #118 (1969)</ref> On the cover of this story's issue, Jimmy's seen wielding a sign that says "Superman is a freak-out!"
* Viking - Jimmy put on Viking armor and mistakenly thought he'd been transported 1000 years backward in time.
* Woman - Jimmy would occasionally go undercover dressed as a woman.<ref name="pal44">''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen'' #44 (1960)</ref>  Grant Morrison paid a brief homage to this in ''All Star Superman''.<ref name="allstar4">''All Star Superman'' #4 (2006)</ref>
* [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] - Also in ''All Star Superman'', Jimmy takes a serum and becomes a version of Superman's foe Doomsday.<ref name="allstar4">''All Star Superman'' #4 (2006)</ref>
* A human [[porcupine]]<ref name="pal65">''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen'' #65 (1962)</ref>

==Publication awards==
[[Jack Kirby]] received a [[Shazam Award]] (for "Special Achievement By an Individual") for his work on ''Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen''. {{fact|date=September 2008}}

==Other versions==
[[Image:Jimmynail.PNG|Jimmy Olsen in ''The Nail''. Art by [[Alan Davis]].|thumb]]
In ''[[JLA: The Nail]]'', an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate reality]] in which a nail punctured a tire on the Kent's car, preventing them from finding the spaceship containing a baby Superman, Jimmy Olsen is revealed as the one behind all the other superheroes' troubles. Jimmy had served as an aide to [[Lex Luthor]] following various short-lived attempts at heroism caused by temporary alteration of his DNA.

:Having discovered Superman's spaceship and using DNA samples to create numerous [[Bizarro]] [[Clone (genetics)|clone]]s, Luthor grafted [[Krypton (planet)|Kryptonian]] [[DNA]] onto Jimmy&mdash;the only such 'graft' that appeared successful, as other subjects either died instantly or mutated before death. This caused Jimmy to go insane, and possess superpowers similar to Superman's, as well as mentally transforming him into a Kryptonian determined to replace human life with Kryptonian life. Jimmy played up the public's fear of superheroes via [[propaganda]], hoping to have them imprisoned so he could use their [[DNA]] as well in an attempt to create a stable template.

:When Jimmy attacked an [[Amish]] couple and their son during a battle with the [[Justice League]], culminating in a desperate attempt by [[Batman]] and [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]] to stop him by supercharging Batman with his ring, the couple was killed, but the son was revealed to be Superman. In this alternate reality, the Amish couple had raised Superman, and brought him up as a [[pacifism|pacifist]], so he had never used his powers in conflict. Jimmy asked Superman to join him, claiming that they were virtually brothers as they shared the same DNA, but when Superman refused, the two battled. During the battle, Jimmy's body started to reject the Kryptonian DNA, causing him to disintegrate. His last, almost prophetic words were directed at Superman, "''We should have been friends''".The Justice League then asked Superman to join them.

*In [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s 2001 [[graphic novel]] ''Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again'', Jimmy Olsen is featured as the writer of a ''Daily Planet'' article titled "Truth to Power", where he attempts to reveal that the current President is a holographic projection. However, his attempts to publicize the truth are halted by [[Lex Luthor]].
* In ''[[Superman: Red Son]]'', written by [[Mark Millar]], Jimmy is depicted as an agent of the [[CIA]], eventually becoming the director, and soon joins Dr. Lex Luthor in his Presidential bid and becomes [[Vice-President]]. His look and model in the series is based off [[James Jesus Angleton]], who served in the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and [[The Good Shepherd (film)|Edward Wilson]].
* In [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Frank Quitely]]'s [[All-Star Superman]] series, Jimmy shows up briefly in the Daily Planet offices in argyle socks; this Jimmy seems to be a refined version of the Silver Age vintage, with a signal watch halfway between a McDonald's [[happy meal]] toy and [[haute couture]]. He's also shown with something that may be a jetpack. Issue #4 of the series focuses on Jimmy and his adventures as the one-day director of the DNA P.R.O.J.E.C.T., a leftover from the Kirby-era Jimmy Olsen series. This is apparently the latest in a series of highly successful articles by Jimmy, in which he spends a day in various roles.
* In [[Alan Moore]] and [[Gene Ha]]'s ''[[Top 10 (comic book)|Top 10]]'', a photograph of a  version of two of Jimmy's superpowered selves, merged, is shown to Andy Soames; having contracted a disease which warps powers, this version appears to be Turtle Boy, driven insane by the acquisition of Elastic Lad's powers.
* Jimmy Olsen makes an appearance in ''[[All Star Batman and Robin|Frank Miller's All Star Batman and Robin The Boy Wonder]]'' #6, helping [[Vicki Vale]], who he appears to be attracted to, escape from hospital and giving her files on Batman and the Flying [[Dick Grayson|Graysons]]. This incarnation is described as a cub reporter for the ''Gotham Gazette'' as opposed to his regular position at the ''Daily Planet'' and as 'Superman's Pal'. However he is still young, so he may work for the Planet.
*In [[Lord Havok]] and the [[Extremists (comics)|Extremists]] #3, a version of Jimmy called '''[[Robin (comics)|Robin]] Olsen''', is shown as a member of [[Monarch (comics)|Monarch's]] army.
