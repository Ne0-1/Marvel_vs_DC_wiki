'''James Bartholomew "Jimmy" Olsen''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[photojournalist]] that appears in [[DC Comics]]â€™ [[Superman]] stories. An anonymous "copy boy" who resembles Olsen makes a brief appearance in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #6, but the character called Jimmy Olsen first appeared in the radio show, ''[[The Adventures of Superman (radio)|The Adventures of Superman]]'', on April 15, 1940. The character moved from the radio show into the comics in 1941,  first appearing in ''Superman'' v1 #13 (1941).  Along with his appearances in current ''Superman'' titles (''Superman'' and ''Action Comics''), he is one of the main protagonists in DC Comics' weekly series ''[[Countdown (DC Comics)|Countdown]]''.

==Fictional character profile==
Jimmy is traditionally depicted as a [[bow tie]]-wearing, [[red hair|red-haired]] young man who works as a cub [[reporter]] and [[photographer]] for ''The [[Daily Planet]]'', alongside [[Lois Lane]] and [[Clark Kent]], whom he idolizes as career role models. In most depictions of the character, he also has a strong friendship with Superman. As Superman's friend, Jimmy has special access to the Man of Steel, thanks to Superman's gift to Jimmy of a "signal [[watch]]," a wristwatch which, with the press of a button, emits a special [[ultrasonic]] frequency signal that Superman can hear anywhere on Earth. (In [[Post-Crisis]] continuity Jimmy invented the watch himself, and Superman briefly considered confiscating it. In [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|New Earth]] continuity, the watch was designed by Superman based on a larger signalling device Jimmy created.)

In many [[Silver Age of comic books|Silver Age]] [[comic books]], Jimmy was often seen sharing adventures with Superman, who saved him from various predicaments ranging from dangerous to merely embarrassing. This was particularly pronounced in the series ''[[Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen (comic)|Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen]]'' (published from 1954 to 1974), which saw Olsen in a variety of [[slapstick]] adventures and strange transformations. Like most DC characters, [[Modern Age of Comic Books|modern]] portrayals of Olsen have been more serious in tone.

An important part of the Superman mythos, Jimmy Olsen has appeared in most other media adaptations of the character.

==Fictional character biography==
===Golden and Silver Age===
{{seealso|History of Superman}}
[[Image:Jimmyolsen.png|thumb|left|Jimmy Olsen, from ''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen'' #36 (1959). Art by [[Curt Swan]].]]

During the Silver Age, Jimmy starred in his own comic book, ''[[Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen]]'', which featured his various adventures with and without Superman; it debuted in 1954. The stories in the title would often feature particularly outlandish situations, ranging from Jimmy being hurled back in time to [[Krypton (planet)|Krypton]] before its destruction in issue #36 to dealing frequently with [[gorillas in comic books|gorillas]] of all sorts. Because of these factors, the comic was regarded by some as a poorly written subsidiary title, although some readers still enjoy it for its [[camp (style)|camp]] value. 

This version of Jimmy Olsen even had his own fan club. [http://supermanica.info/wiki/index.php/The_Jimmy_Olsen_Fan_Club]. In one adventure published in the 1960s, he implied that there were branches of it around the [[United States|country]] and that he intended to lecture them about anti-crime techniques he had learned from Superman and [[Batman]]." <ref>illustration included in the ''Penguin Book of Comics'' by George Perry and Alan Aldridge, published in 1967.</ref>

===Jack Kirby's Fourth World===
Kirby began by introducing a secret "D.N.A. Project" to create Mutated Humans for Good, also adding "The Hairies" (a group of technology-equipped hippies) and superbeings from other planets (proto-New Gods) and Intergang and Morgan Edge... and reintroduced his 1940s Newsboy Legion characters.

About halfway through his run, Kirby also added vampires, the Loch Ness monster, and Victor Volcanum, the fire-eating archcriminal. Readership quickly dropped back to its pre-Jack-Kirby levels. {{Fact|date=September 2007}}

Jack's tenure on the series ended in 1974 with issue #163, when Jimmy's book was folded into the [[anthology]] title ''[[Superman Family]]''. In that book, Olsen became a more serious character who battled criminals as an [[investigative reporter]] known as "Mr. Action" in urban crime stories that rarely involved Superman.

===Modern adventures===
====''The Man of Steel''====
Following ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', the entire Superman mythos was rebooted from scratch in the limited series ''The Man of Steel''.  Despite recent modernization efforts on Superman and his supporting characters, Jimmy Olsen has not been significantly changed in the Modern Age. He is still a cub reporter working for ''The Daily Planet'', and is still friends with Superman. His look was made over as he stopped wearing bowties, and started wearing casual clothing (though this trend started in 1970s comics). An interesting alteration to the relationship was that Jimmy designed the signal watch himself, leading to his first meeting with Superman.<ref name="WoM4">''World of Metropolis'' #4 (1987)</ref> Superman briefly considered confiscating the watch, but decided he trusted Jimmy to use it responsibly.

While weird transformations no longer occur as regularly as they did in the Silver Age, Jimmy did become Elastic Lad on contact with the [[Eradicator (comics)|Eradicator]]. He has also taken the identity of "Giant Turtle Boy" in a series of [[pizza]] [[commercials]], made when he was temporarily laid off from the Planet.

In the late 1990s, Jimmy moved to Metropolis broadcaster Galaxy Broadcasting, where he became more brash and arrogant. This came to an end when he thought (wrongly) he had discovered Superman's [[secret identity]] and said he would announce it live on air. He reconsidered his actions, but lost his job for wasting the timeslot. He was again rehired by the Planet.

====''Superman: Metropolis''====
June 2003 saw Jimmy Olsen as the focus of a twelve-part miniseries entitled ''Superman: Metropolis''. Written by [[Chuck Austen]] and illustrated by Danijel Zezelj, the series focused on the futuristic [[technology]] unleashed in Metropolis by [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]] in a previous storyline, and how it affected the everyday lives of Metropolis citizens.

Recently, Jimmy had taken a position as a regular star reporter for ''The Daily Planet'', replacing the recently demoted Clark Kent. This caused a strain in the relationship between Clark and Jimmy. It appears, however, that following the [[One Year Later]] storyline jump, Clark has regained his original role as ''The Daily Planet'''s star reporter,<ref>''52: Week Eight'' (2006)</ref><ref name="SM650">''Superman'' #650 (2006)</ref> and Jimmy has returned to being a photographer, winning the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for his photographic efforts.

====''Countdown''====
[[Image:Jimmyolsencountdown.jpg|Jimmy Olsen as Mr. Action. Cover art for ''Countdown'' #38, by Shane Davis.|thumb]] 
{{main|Countdown (comic book)}}

Jimmy's story in ''Countdown'' begins with an investigation into the death of [[Duela Dent]].  Superman leads Jimmy to meet with [[Jason Todd|Red Hood]], and then [[the Joker]] at [[Arkham Asylum]].  After a seemingly fruitless interview with the Joker, Jimmy is attacked by [[Killer Croc]].<ref name="c50">''Countdown'' #50 (2007)</ref>  Instead of shredding him, Jimmy shows his first signs of being a metahuman with super-stretch abilities (i.e. [[Plastic Man]] or [[Elongated Man]]) which saves his life.  After Killer Croc is knocked out, Jimmy claims he had no idea that Killer Croc wouldn't be able to kill him.<ref name="c49">''Countdown'' #49 (2007)</ref> Upon returning to Metropolis, he witnesses what appears to be an attack on the city and displays super-speed to rescue a couple from falling debris, again shocked at his new-found ability.<ref name="c48">''Countdown'' #48 (2007)</ref> Jimmy's elastic and speed abilities are nods to his brief time as Elastic Lad and Speed-Demon during the Silver Age.  Upon noting that he only received powers when he was in danger, Jimmy tested himself by picking a fight with a gang in Suicide Slum, only to be punched in the face.  When a member of the gang attempted to grab him, Jimmy grew [[porcupine]]-like [[quills]] that shot at the attacker.<ref name="c44">''Countdown'' #44 (2007)</ref> In issue #41, Jimmy, after deciding to become a superhero, creates a costume and dubs himself "Mr. Action."  In ''Action Comics'' #852-854, he later displays super strength, solar powers, giant size, [[lycanthropy]], a protective turtle shell, and fire breathing. Jimmy later discovers he starts to know information such as the secret identities of Wonder Woman and three [[Robin (comics)|Robins]],<ref name="ac853">''Action Comics'' #853</ref> and later Superman himself.<ref name="cd387">''Countdown'' #37</ref><ref>''Action Comics'' #854</ref> He and Superman share their double identities, and Superman asks Jimmy to adopt [[Krypto]] for him. Jimmy's powers continue to develop and perplex as he is tested by the Justice League, [[John Henry Irons]] and the [[Cadmus Project]]. He is then recruited by [[Forager (comics)|Forager]] to help solve the mystery of the [[Death of the New Gods]]. They journey to [[Apokolips]], but are swiftly defeated and captured. Jimmy's new powers allow him to create a Boom Tube, and the two escape. Upon landing on Earth, Jimmy is kissed by Forager.

==Powers, abilities, and equipment==
[[Image:Jimmyolsentransformations.jpg|Cover art for ''The Amazing Transformations of Jimmy Olsen'', by [[Brian Bolland]].|thumb]]

Jimmy possesses a watch which emits a high pitched signal only Superman can hear.

Especially in the days of the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]], Jimmy would often find himself temporarily transformed, for better or worse, or undergo a disguise for various purposes. The transformation tradition is still sometimes referenced in current day comics, usually through [[homage]] or [[parody]]. The variety of transformations Jimmy received during the Silver Age is often homaged or parodied in later comics and adaptations featuring the character &mdash; for instance, in ''[[JLA: The Nail]]'', Jimmy cites three of these transformations as his motivations behind backing Luthor's bill to outlaw metahumans and in ''Countdown'', Jimmy appears to sporadically assume these transformations for an unknown reason, with other stories simply make passing references.

* Giant Turtle Boy: One of Jimmy's most frequently cited transformations was that of his turning into a giant turtle boy.<ref name="pal53">''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen'' #53 (1961)</ref>
* Elastic Lad - As Elastic Lad, Jimmy (by serum or by alien virus) could sometimes stretch himself, akin to [[Elongated Man]] or [[Plastic Man]].<ref name="pal37">''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen'' #37 (1959)</ref> 
* [[Flamebird]]- name he took as a costumed superhero, with Superman disguised as [[Nightwing]], in the shrunken [[Krypton (planet)|Kryptonian]] city of [[Kandor]]. These names were inspired by two native Kryptonian [[birds]], the nightwing and the flamebird, but the relationship between Nightwing and Flamebird intentionally paralleled the crime-fighting team [[Batman]] (a night-winged creature) and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] (a flame-colored bird). 
* Speed Demon - In [[1956]], a month before the debut of [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] as the new [[Flash (comics)|Flash]], Jimmy drank a potion produced by a Professor Claude and briefly gained super-speed. 
* Radioactive - After being exposed himself, Jimmy began to irradiate everything in his presence.
* Gorilla - When Jimmy switched minds with a gorilla in, he went about his reporting duties as a gorilla in Jimmy's clothes.<ref name="pal24">''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen'' #24</ref>
* Monstrous beard growth - The machinations of the sinister Beard Band cause Jimmy to grow an immense [[beard]].
* Alien-form - [[Extraterrestrial life in culture|Aliens]] transformed Jimmy into a telepathic [[Jupiter (planet)|Jovian]] for a week. Fortunately, this turned out to be a Jovian week ... which is much shorter than an Earth week (about 70 hours = slightly less than three days.)
* Wolf-Man - In the vein of the popular [[Michael Landon]] 1950s film ''[[I Was a Teenage Werewolf]]'', Jimmy found himself transformed into a [[werewolf]].<ref name="pal44">''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen'' #44 (1960)</ref>
* Hippie - Jimmy grew a beard and joined a Superman-hating band of [[hippie]]s.<ref name="pal118">''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen'' #118 (1969)</ref> On the cover of this story's issue, Jimmy's seen wielding a sign that says "Superman is a freak-out!"
* Viking - Jimmy put on Viking armor and mistakenly thought he'd been transported 1000 years backward in time.
* Woman - Jimmy would occasionally go undercover dressed as a woman.<ref name="pal44">''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen'' #44 (1960)</ref>  Grant Morrison paid a brief homage to this in ''All Star Superman''.<ref name="allstar4">''All Star Superman'' #4 (2006)</ref>
* [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] - Also in ''All Star Superman'', Jimmy takes a serum and becomes a version of Superman's foe Doomsday.<ref name="allstar4">''All Star Superman'' #4 (2006)</ref>
* A [[genie]]{{Fact|date=September 2007}}
* Jimmy gets whacked over the head by Bizarro and when he wakes up, he believes he's Perry White; he fires Clark Kent and hires Peter Parker to take his place.
* A six-armed man{{Fact|date=September 2007}}
* A [[Fire breathing|fire-breather]]{{Fact|date=September 2007}}
* A water-breather{{Fact|date=September 2007}}
* A human [[porcupine]]<ref name="pal65">''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen'' #65 (1962)</ref>
* A [[gorilla]]'s husband{{Fact|date=September 2007}}
* Superman on another planet, but he got upset because the civilians knew who he was.{{Fact|date=September 2007}}

==Publication awards==

[[Jack Kirby]] received a [[Shazam Award]] (for "Special Achievement By an Individual") for his work on ''Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen''.

==Other versions==
[[Image:Jimmynail.PNG|Jimmy Olsen in ''The Nail''. Art by [[Alan Davis]].|thumb]]
*In ''[[JLA: The Nail]]'', an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate reality]] in which a nail punctured a tire on the Kents' car, preventing them from finding the spaceship containing a baby Superman, Jimmy Olsen is revealed as the one behind all the other superheroes' troubles. Jimmy had served as an aide to [[Lex Luthor]] following various short-lived attempts at heroism caused by temporary alteration of his DNA. Having discovered Superman's spaceship and using DNA samples to create numerous [[Bizarro]] [[Clone (genetics)|clone]]s, Luthor grafted [[Krypton (planet)|Kryptonian]] [[DNA]] onto Jimmy&mdash;the only such 'graft' that appeared successful, as other subjects either died instantly or mutated before death. This caused Jimmy to go insane and possess superpowers similar to Superman's, as well as mentally transforming him into a Kryptonian, determined to replace human life with Kryptonian life. Jimmy played up the public's fear of superheroes via [[propaganda]], hoping to have them imprisoned so he could use their [[DNA]] as well in an attempt to create a stable template. When Jimmy attacked an [[Amish]] couple and their son during a battle with the [[Justice League]], culminating in a desperate attempt by [[Batman]] and [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]] to stop him by supercharging Batman with his ring, the couple was killed, but the son was revealed to be Superman. In this alternate reality, the Amish couple had raised Superman, and brought him up as a [[pacifism|pacifist]], so he had never used his powers in conflict. Jimmy asked Superman to join him, claiming that they were virtually brothers as they shared the same DNA, but when Superman refused, the two battled. During the battle, Jimmy's body started to reject the Kryptonian DNA, causing him to disintegrate. His last, almost prophetic words were directed at Superman, "''We should have been friends''".The Justice League then asked Superman to join them.
*In [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s 2001 [[graphic novel]] ''Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again'', Jimmy Olsen is featured as the writer of a ''Daily Planet'' article titled "Truth to Power", where he attempts to reveal that the current President is a holographic projection. However, his attempts to publicize the truth are halted by [[Lex Luthor]].
* In ''[[Superman: Red Son]]'', Jimmy is depicted as an agent of the [[CIA]], eventually becoming the director, and soon joins Luthor in his Presidential bid and becomes [[Vice-President]].
* In [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Frank Quitely]]'s [[All-Star Superman]] series, Jimmy shows up briefly in the Daily Planet offices in argyle socks; this Jimmy seems to be a refined version of the Silver Age vintage, with a signal watch halfway between a McDonald's [[happy meal]] toy and [[haute couture]]. He's also shown with something that may be a jetpack. Issue #4 of the series focuses on Jimmy and his adventures as the one-day director of the DNA P.R.O.J.E.C.T., a leftover from the Kirby-era Jimmy Olsen series. This is apparently the latest in a series of highly successful articles by Jimmy, in which he spends a day in various roles.
* In [[Alan Moore]] and [[Gene Ha]]'s ''[[Top 10 (comic book)|Top 10]]'', a photograph of a  version of two of Jimmy's superpowered selves, merged, is shown to Andy Soames; having contracted a disease which warps powers, this version appears to be Turtle Boy, driven insane by the acquisition of Elastic Lad's powers.
* Jimmy Olsen makes an appearance in ''All Star Batman and Robin The Boy Wonder'' #6, helping Vicki Vale, who he appears to be attracted to, escape from hospital and giving her files on Batman and the Flying Graysons. This incarnation is described as a cub reporter for the ''Gotham Gazette'' as opposed to his regular position at the ''Daily Planet'' and as 'Superman's Pal'.

==In other media==
===Radio===

*On the Superman radio series, [[Jack Grimes (actor)|Jack Grimes]] provides the voice of Jimmy Olsen.

[[Image:Jimmyolsen.gif|thumb|Jimmy Olsen in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]''.]]

===Film===
* Jimmy Olsen has appeared in every major [[film]]ed adaptation of Superman.  The first actor to portray Jimmy Olsen in live-action was [[Tommy Bond]] in the serials starring [[Kirk Alyn]]. 
* In the four motion pictures starring [[Christopher Reeve]] beginning with ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'', Jimmy Olsen was portrayed by [[Marc McClure]].  McClure also played Jimmy Olsen in the [[1984 in film|1984]] [[spin-off]] movie ''[[Supergirl]]'', making McClure the only actor and Olsen the only character to appear in all five ''Superman'' films of the 1978-87 era.
*In [[Bryan Singer]]'s [[2006 in film|2006]] movie ''[[Superman Returns]]'', Jimmy Olsen is portrayed by [[Sam Huntington]], an older and more confident, yet goofier portrayal of the character who finds it difficult to get a good shot or get any photos published. In a deleted scene (included in the DVD release) a slightly inebriated Olsen is seen to complain to Clark about the fact he hasn't had a photo printed in several months.
*Jimmy appeared in ''[[Superman: Doomsday]]'', voiced by [[Adam Wylie]].

===Video games===

Jimmy Olsen also appeared in several Superman games.  

*[[Superman]]  [NES, 2600, C64]:  Jimmy appears in the daily building room and enjoys taking pictures of Clark Kent.  Also, in that game, Jimmy's appearance is similar to his pre-crisis comic appearance.

*[[Superman 64]]  [N64]:  He is trapped, along with Lois Lane and Professor Emil Hamilton, by Lex Luthor.  Superman has to save him and his friends in this game.

*[[Superman: Shadow of Apokolips]] [Gamecube, PS2]:  Jimmy makes some minor appearances and only seen in the story between game-play.  He is also seen in the bibliography section of the game.

===Television===
*On the ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]'' [[television]] series starring [[George Reeves]], Jimmy Olsen was portrayed by [[Jack Larson]]. Larson also portrayed an unnaturally aged Jimmy Olsen in an episode of  ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]''.

* [[Jack Grimes (actor)|Jack Grimes]] provided the voice of Jimmy Olsen once again on [[The New Adventures of Superman]], a role that he reprises from the radio series. 

* [[Mark L. Taylor]] did the voice of Jimmy Olsen in the 1988 [[animated]] adaptation of [[Superman]].

*On the television series ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'', Jimmy Olsen was portrayed by [[Michael Landes]] in the first season and [[Justin Whalin]] for the rest of the series' run. The reason cited{{Fact|date=September 2007}} behind the change is that Landes looked too much like [[Dean Cain]] as well as to emphasize Jimmy's youth.

*In ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', Jimmy was voiced by [[David Kaufman (actor)|David Kaufman]]. One episode was called "Superman's Pal" as an homage to the old comic series, and Superman gave Jimmy the signal watch by the end of the episode. Jimmy had several cameo appearances in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', including one episode where [[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]] tied him up, taped his mouth shut, and used the signal watch to attract Superman. Jimmy again was voiced in the television movie ''[[Superman: Brainiac Attacks]]''.
**In the ''Justice League Unlimited'' episode "Chaos at the Earth's Core", several heroes battle a giant turtle that has a thatch of red hair. [[Bruce Timm]] has confirmed this is a reference to Jimmy's [[#Powers, abilities, and equipment|Giant Turtle Boy]] persona, "but it was more economical time-wise to have him revert to cute little turtle than naked, confused photographer." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://jl.toonzone.net/episode53/episode53.htm|title="Chaos at the Earth's Core" at The Watchtower|accessdate=}} Retrieved on [[June 20]], [[2007]].</ref>

====Smallville====
<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Aaron Ashmore.jpg|thumb|right|[[Aaron Ashmore]] as Jimmy Olsen in "Smallville".]] --><!-- Do not remove the Smallville title as it is used as a redirect link for the Smallville box -->In ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'' Jimmy Olsen is first referenced, by first name only, in season 4.  He appears in person, played by [[Aaron Ashmore]], in the season premiere of season 6, now on staff at the ''Planet''. Jimmy and Chloe became a couple again after their reunion in Season 6 premiere "Zod". At first Jimmy is jealous of Clark but their relationship becomes friendly after Clark reunites him with Chloe in season 6 episode "Trespass".

In S7 Jimmy is still at Daily Planet working as a budding photographer, his relationship with Chloe is going through a rough phase due to Chloe's newfound mutant abilities. They broke up in a very emotional scene in the episode "Cure" since Chloe was unable to share her secret with him. Meanwhile Clark's newly arrived Kryptonian cousin Kara Zor-El ([[Laura Vandervoort]]) has developed a crush on Jimmy and they become friends. Jimmy is also smitten by her and teams up with her in episodes like "Cure" and "Lara".

== Cultural references ==
*The [[Spin Doctors]] had a minor hit with their song "Jimmy Olsen's Blues" on their album ''[[Pocket Full of Kryptonite]]'', in which they portrayed Jimmy Olsen as infatuated with [[Lois Lane]] and jealous of Superman.  In the period after the song became popular, artist [[Jon Bogdanove]], who at the time was the regular penciler on the ''Superman: The Man of Steel'' comic, would occasionally depict Jimmy wearing a Spin Doctors [[T-shirt]].
*Often, Superman [[pastiches]] have featured notable Jimmy analogues. For example, in ''[[Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures]]'', [[Mighty Mouse]]'s greatest fan was a young mouse named [[Scrappy Mouse|Scrappy]] with a shock of red hair.
