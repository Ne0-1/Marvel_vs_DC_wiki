'''Jimmy Olsen''' is a [[supporting character]] in the [[Superman]] [[comic book]] series published by [[DC Comics]]. This [[fictional character]]'s full name has been revealed as James Bartholomew Olsen.

Jimmy is usually depicted as a [[bow tie]]-wearing young red-haired man who works as a cub [[reporter]] and [[photographer]] for ''The [[Daily Planet]]'', usually in conjunction with [[Lois Lane]] and [[Clark Kent]], whom he idolizes as career role models. Jimmy has often been portrayed as somewhat naive, but also as clever and resourceful. In his recent comic incarnation, Jimmy has managed to win the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for his photographic efforts.

Jimmy is also known as "Superman's pal" and has privileged access to him with the aid of a special signal [[watch]], which with the press of a button emits a special ultrasonic frequency signal that Superman can hear anywhere on Earth. He also goes by the [[nickname]] "Mr. Action" and in the [[Silver Age of comic books|Silver Age]] occasionally took a potion which gave him stretching powers as "Elastic Lad."

==History==
===Golden and Silver Age versions===
During the Silver Age, Jimmy starred in his own comic book, ''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen'', which featured his various adventures with and without Superman; it debuted in 1954.  The stories in the title would often feature particularly outlandish situations for Jimmy to find himself in (either through his own naive nature or by bad luck), and would range from being hurled back in time to [[Krypton (planet)|Krypton]] before its destruction in issue #36 to dealing frequently with [[gorillas in comic books|gorillas]] of all sorts, e.g., in issue #98. Because of these factors, the comic was regarded by some as a poorly written subsidiary title.

The major exception to this was in the early 1970s, when the singular artist [[Jack Kirby]] took over the title and created his own distinctive stories as part of [[Jack Kirby's Fourth World]], which introduced many additions to the [[DC Universe]], including the [[supervillain]] [[Darkseid]] and [[Project Cadmus]].  The series ended in 1974 with issue #163, when Jimmy's book was folded into the [[anthology]] title ''[[Superman Family]]''.  In that book, Olsen became a more serious character who battled criminals as an investigative reporter in urban crime stories that rarely involved Superman.

===Modern Age version===
Despite being modernized to fit the current times, Jimmy Olsen has not been signifcantly changed in the Modern Age. He is still a cub reporter working for the Daily Planet, and is still friends with Superman.

June 2003 saw Jimmy Olsen as the focus of a twelve-part miniseries entitled ''Superman: Metropolis''. Written by [[Chuck Austen]] and illustrated by [[Danijel Zezelj]], the series focused on the futuristic technology unleashed in Metropolis by [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]] in a previous storyline, and how it affected the everday lives of Metropolis citizens.

Currently Jimmy Olson has taken a position as a regular star reporter for the Daily Planet, apparantly his job replace the position left absent by Clark Kent who has been demoted.  This has caused a strain in the relationship between Clark and Jimmy.   

==Awards==
[[Jack Kirby]] received a [[Shazam Award]] (for "Special Achievement By an Individual") for his work on ''Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen''.

==Alternate versions==
{{spoilers}}
*In [[Frank Miller]]'s 1986 [[graphic novel]] ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'' Jimmy Olsen is featured as the writer of a ''Daily Planet'' article entitled "Truth to Power."
*In ''[[JLA: The Nail]]'', an alternate reality in which a nail punctured the Kent's car, preventing them from finding the spaceship containing a baby Superman, Jimmy Olsen is revealed as the one behind all the other superheroes' troubles. [[Lex Luthor]], who Jimmy had served as an [[aide]] to, grafted [[Kryptonian]] [[DNA]] on him, causing him to go insane and posess superpowers similar to Superman's. Jimmy played up the public's fear of superheroes via propaganda, hoping to have them imprisoned so he could use their DNA as well. When Jimmy attacked an [[Amish]] couple and their son during a battle with the [[JLA]], the couple was killed but the son was revealed to be Superman, who had been raised by the Amish couple as opposed to the Kents in this reality (hence why Superman had never used his powers for battle; he was raised to be a [[pacifist]]). Jimmy offered Superman to join him, and when Superman refused the two battled. During the battle, Jimmy's body started to refuse the Kryptonian DNA, causing him to disenegrate. The JLA then asked Superman to lead them.
