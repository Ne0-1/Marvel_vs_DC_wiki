Art by [[Curt Swan]] and [[Stan Kaye]].]]'''Jimmy Olsen''' is a [[supporting character]] in the [[Superman]] [[comic book]] series published by [[DC Comics]]. This [[fictional character]]'s full name has been revealed as James Bartholomew Olsen.

He is usually depicted as a young red-haired man who works as a cub [[reporter]] and [[photographer]] for ''The [[Daily Planet]]'', usually in conjunction with [[Lois Lane]] and [[Clark Kent]], whom he idolizes as his ideals for his career ambitions.

He is also known as Superman's pal and has privileged access to him with the aid of a special signal watch, which emits a special ultrasonic frequency signal which Superman can hear anywhere on Earth. He also goes by the [[nickname]] "Mr. Action" and in the [[Silver Age of comic books|Silver Age]] occasionally took a potion which gave him stretching powers as Elastic Lad.

During the Silver Age, the character starred in his own comic book, ''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen'', which featured his various adventures with and without Superman. It was generally regarded as a poorly written subsidiary title by both readers and creative staff. The exception to this was in the early [[1970s]], when the singular artist [[Jack Kirby]] took over the title and created his own distinctive stories as part of [[Jack Kirby's Fourth World]], which introduced many addtions to the [[DC Universe]], including the [[supervillain]] [[Darkseid]].

The character has appeared in every major [[film]]ed adaptation of Superman.
