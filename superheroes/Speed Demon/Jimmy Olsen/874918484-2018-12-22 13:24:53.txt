==Publication history==
An unnamed "office boy" with a bow tie makes a brief appearance in the story "Superman's Phony Manager" published in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #6 (November 1938), which is claimed to be Jimmy Olsen's first appearance by several reference sources.<ref>{{cite book|last= Wallace|first= Daniel|title= Superman: The Ultimate Guide to the Man of Steel|publisher= [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year= 2013|location= London, United Kingdom|page= 126|isbn= 978-1465408754}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last= Wallace|first= Daniel|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1930s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|year=2010|location= London, United Kingdom|isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 21 |quote = ''Action Comics'' #6 (November 1938) The Man of Steels's future pal Jimmy Olsen made his first appearance within this issue of ''Action Comics'', although he was identified only as an "inquisitive office-boy.}}</ref><ref>[http://www.comics.org/issue/349/ ''Action Comics'' #6 (November 1938)] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]</ref> The character was first introduced as Jimmy Olsen in the radio show ''[[The Adventures of Superman (radio)|The Adventures of Superman]]'' on April 15, 1940 in the episode "Donelli’s Protection Racket",<ref name="Markstein">{{cite web |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/jimmyo.htm |title=Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen |first=Don |last=Markstein |year=2008 |publisher=[[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QyZoThLM?url=http://www.toonopedia.com/jimmyo.htm |archivedate=July 11, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref> mainly "so the Man of Steel would have someone to talk to".<ref>{{cite comic|story= Lightning Bolts|title= [[Black Lightning]]|issue= 3|date= July 1977}}</ref> With Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster creating and drawing the physical appearance and giving him a bigger personality, the character moved from the radio show back into the comics in 1941, first appearing as a named character in the story "Superman versus The Archer" in ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' #13 (November–December 1941).<ref>Wallace "1940s" in Dolan, p. 37 "''Superman'' #13 (November–December 1941) Jimmy Olsen made his first appearance as a named character in this issue."</ref><ref>[http://www.comics.org/issue/1753/ ''Superman'' #13 (Nov.-Dec.1941)] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> But after a handful of appearances, he disappeared again. In late 1953, while [[Jack Larson]] was playing the character on the ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]'' television show where he was referred to as "Jim Olsen", the character was revived in the Superman comics after a 10-year absence and then given his own title.

Jimmy is traditionally depicted as a [[bow tie]]-wearing, [[red hair|red-haired]] young man who works as a cub [[reporter]] and [[photographer]] for ''The [[Daily Planet]]'', alongside [[Lois Lane]] and [[Clark Kent]], whom he idolizes as career role models. In most depictions of the character, he has a strong friendship with Superman. As Superman's friend, Jimmy has special access to the Man of Steel, thanks to Superman's gift to Jimmy of a "signal [[watch]]", a wristwatch which, with the press of a button, emits a special [[Ultrasound|ultrasonic]] frequency signal that Superman can hear anywhere on Earth. (In [[Post-Crisis]] continuity Jimmy invented the watch himself, and Superman briefly considered confiscating it. In [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|New Earth]] continuity, the watch was designed by Superman based on a larger signaling device Jimmy created.)

===Silver Age===
[[Image:Jimmyolsen.png|thumb|right|From ''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen'' #36 (April 1959). Art by [[Curt Swan]] and Ray Burnley.]]
In many [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], Jimmy was often seen sharing adventures with Superman, who saved him from various predicaments ranging from dangerous to merely embarrassing. Beginning in 1954, Jimmy stars in his own comic book, ''[[Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen]]'',<ref>[[Alexander C. Irvine|Irvine, Alex]] "1950s" in Dolan, p. 73: "Jimmy Olsen got his own adventures in ''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen'' #1. A comic remarkable for its inventiveness and longevity, it ran for 163 issues."</ref> published from 1954 to 1974, which saw Olsen in a variety of [[slapstick]] adventures and strange transformations, with and without Superman. The stories in the title would often feature particularly outlandish situations,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comicsalliance.com/best-jimmy-olsen-comics/ |title=The 10 Most Insane Jimmy Olsen Moments of All Time |first=Chris |last=Sims |date=September 29, 2010 |publisher=[[Townsquare Media|ComicsAlliance]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421051151/http://comicsalliance.com/best-jimmy-olsen-comics/ |archivedate=April 21, 2014 |deadurl=yes |quote=With 163 issues of outright madness, ''Superman’s Pal Jimmy Olsen'' somehow managed to out-crazy every other DC comic in the Silver Age. |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2012/12/18/the-twelve-best-covers-of-supermans-pal-jimmy-olsen/|title= The Twelve Best Covers Of ''Superman’s Pal, Jimmy Olsen''|first= John|last= Rozum|date= December 18, 2012|publisher= [[Comic Book Resources]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140410072519/http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2012/12/18/the-twelve-best-covers-of-supermans-pal-jimmy-olsen/|archivedate= April 10, 2014|deadurl= no}}</ref> ranging from Jimmy being hurled back in time to [[Krypton (planet)|Krypton]] before its destruction in issue #36 to dealing frequently with [[gorillas in comic books|gorillas]] of all sorts.

===Jack Kirby's Fourth World===
[[Jack Kirby]] took over the Jimmy Olsen comic with issue #134.<ref>https://www.newsfromme.com/2003/08/22/jack-kirbys-superman/</ref> He began by introducing a secret "[[Project Cadmus|D.N.A. Project]]" to create Mutated Humans for Good, adding "the Hairies" (a group of technology-equipped hippies), superbeings from other planets (proto-New Gods), [[Intergang]], and [[Morgan Edge]]... and reintroduced his 1940s Newsboy Legion characters.<ref>McAvennie, Michael "1970s" in Dolan, p. 141 "Since no ongoing creative team had been slated to ''Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen'', "King of Comics" Jack Kirby made the title his DC launch point, and the writer/artist's indelible energy and ideas permeated every panel and word balloon of the comic."</ref> About halfway through his run, Kirby introduced [[vampire]]s,<ref>{{cite comic|writer= [[Jack Kirby|Kirby, Jack]]|penciller= Kirby, Jack|inker= [[Vince Colletta|Colletta, Vince]]|story= The Man from Transilvane|title= [[Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen]]|issue= #142|date= October 1971}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic|writer= Kirby, Jack|penciller= Kirby, Jack|inker= Colletta, Vince|story= Genocide Spray|title= Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen|issue= #143|date= November 1971}}</ref> the [[Loch Ness Monster]],<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Kirby, Jack|penciller= Kirby, Jack|inker= Colletta, Vince|story= A Big Thing in a Deep Scottish Lake|title= Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen|issue= #144|date= December 1971}}</ref> and Victor Volcanum, the fire-eating archcriminal.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Kirby, Jack|penciller= Kirby, Jack|inker= [[Mike Royer|Royer, Mike]]|story= A Superman in Super-Town|title= Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen|issue= #147|date= March 1972}}</ref> Readership quickly dropped back to its pre-Kirby levels.

Kirby's tenure on the series ended with issue #148; and with issue #164 (April–May 1974) Jimmy's book was folded into the [[anthology]] title ''[[The Superman Family]]''.<ref>McAvennie "1970s" in Dolan, p. 159 "DC's 100-page Super Spectaculars were proving popular, so DC said goodbye to ''Supergirl'', ''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen'', ''Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane'', and housed the characters together in ''Superman Family''. Continuing the numbering from where ''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen'' ended, the series featured classic reprints with new tales in the lead spot."</ref> In that series, Olsen became a more serious character who battled criminals as an [[investigative reporter]] known as "Mr. Action" in urban crime stories that rarely involved Superman. Jimmy Olsen appeared in new stories in ''The Superman Family'' #164, 167, 170, 173, 176, 179, and 182–222.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Wells|first= John|title= ''Superman Family'' Portraits|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= #62|pages= 44–54|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date= February 2013| location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref>

===Modern adventures===

====''The Man of Steel''====
Following ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', the entire Superman mythos was rebooted from scratch in the limited series ''The Man of Steel''. Despite recent modernization efforts on Superman and his supporting characters, Jimmy Olsen has not been significantly changed in the Modern Age. He is still a cub reporter working for ''The Daily Planet'', and is still friends with Superman. His look was made over as he stopped wearing bowties, and started wearing casual clothing (though this trend started in 1970s comics). An interesting alteration to the relationship was that Jimmy designed the signal watch himself, leading to his first meeting with Superman.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]]|penciller= [[Win Mortimer|Mortimer, Win]]|inker= [[Dick Giordano|Giordano, Dick]]; [[Sal Trapani|Trapani, Sal]]|story= Friends in Need|title= World of Metropolis|issue= #4|date= November 1988}}</ref> Superman briefly considered confiscating the watch, but decided to trust Jimmy to use it responsibly.

While Jimmy's transformations no longer occur as regularly as they did in the Silver Age, Jimmy once became a type of "Elastic Lad" on contact with the [[Eradicator (comics)|Eradicator]]; this transformation, however, was extremely painful for Jimmy and has not appeared since. He also took the identity of "Turtle Boy" in a series of [[pizza]] [[commercials]], made when he was temporarily laid off from the ''Planet''.

In the 1990s, Jimmy quit the ''Planet'' in a dispute over a story and went to Metropolis broadcaster Galaxy Broadcasting, where he worked as an on-air investigative reporter. This change matured Jimmy somewhat, but he became more ambitious, as well as more brash and arrogant. He still stayed on good terms with both Clark and Lois, to the point where Jimmy was best man at their wedding. This period ended when he believed (wrongly) that he had discovered Superman's [[secret identity]] and said he would announce it live on air. He reconsidered his actions, but lost his job for wasting the timeslot. He was again rehired by the ''Planet''.

Jimmy later came under the angry hand of the [[Alpha Centurion]], an alternate universe dictator with a deep-seated hatred for Superman and eyes for Lois Lane. It was Jimmy who first uncovered his secret plot to control the world's finances through his company Aelius Industries, Inc.

====''Superman: Metropolis''====
Olsen is a central character in the twelve-part miniseries ''Superman: Metropolis'' (beginning June 2003). Written by [[Chuck Austen]] and illustrated by Danijel Zezelj, the series focuses on the futuristic [[technology]] unleashed in Metropolis by [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] in a previous storyline and how it affects the everyday lives of Metropolis citizens.

Jimmy takes a position as a regular star reporter for ''The Daily Planet'', replacing the recently demoted Clark Kent. This caused a strain at the '' Planet''.

====''Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen Special''====
{{Main|Superman: New Krypton}}
During Superman's fight with [[Atlas (DC Comics)|Atlas]], Jimmy witnesses a [[Codename: Assassin|mysterious figure]] hovering over the fight. After some encouraging words from Clark Kent, he decides to take two weeks off to investigate.

He tracks down a figure connected with the past of [[Codename: Assassin|Jonathan Drew]] and is told the story of how Jonathan became Codename: Assassin. His informant is quickly executed by Codename: Assassin who then tries to kill Jimmy. Jimmy is able to avoid being killed and is apparently shielded from Codename: Assassin's telepathy due to his own many physical transformations over the years.

Jimmy goes to [[Project Cadmus]] and speaks to [[Dubbilex]], who tells him the story about the death of the original [[Guardian (DC Comics)|Guardian]] at the hands of Codename: Assassin and how cloning is such an imperfect science that the only viable clone alive went into hiding in the desert. Dubbilex then dies from injuries sustained in an earlier conflict with Codename: Assassin. Jimmy heads south to the town of Warpath, AZ, managing to avoid conflict with Codename: Assassin on the way.

Upon arriving in Warpath, Jimmy interviews the sheriff, [[Vigilante (comics)|Greg Saunders]], who evades his questions. Jimmy follows him after dark and sees Saunders working with [[Guardian (DC Comics)|the last Guardian clone]]. He then confronts the clone at his home and the two speak.

With his two weeks up, Jimmy returns to Metropolis horrified from learning that a faction within the U.S. military is actively plotting to kill Superman.

Willing to do anything to uncover the conspiracy behind [[List of government agencies in DC Comics#Project 7734|Project 7734]], Jimmy uses an anonymous [[online chat|chat]] server and gets in contact with Erik/Amazing Woman from [[Infinity Inc.]], who claims to have informations useful to help Jimmy. Despite being actively pursued by Codename: Assassin, who goes so far to place bugs in his house, Jimmy goes to the appointment, only to find Erik's house burned to the ground.

Jimmy pulls Erik out, who with his dying breath, shifts to his more reliable and powerful Erika form. Erik gives him [[Natasha Irons]]' number. Natasha contacts then Jimmy, telling him about the plans of General [[Sam Lane (comics)|Sam Lane]], his outworldly fortress and his capture, and use of a ''Planet Breaker'' weapon of [[Captain Atom]], now codenamed ''Project Breach'' (due to his similarity to [[Breach (comics)|Tim Zanetti]]'s fate).

Finally ready to uncover the truth, Jimmy is openly confronted by Codename: Assassin, who until that point had merely followed him closely. Jimmy uses his signal watch to call [[Lar Gand|Mon-El]]. Jimmy is shot twice in the chest by Codename: Assassin, and sinks into the ocean.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[James Robinson (writer)|Robinson, James]]|penciller= [[Bernard Chang|Chang, Bernard]]|inker= Chang, Bernard|story= The Death of Jimmy Olsen|title= Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen Special|issue= #2|date= October 2009}}</ref> Despite surviving his assassination attempt, Jimmy decides to fake his death, having his documents planted on a heavily disfigured corpse.

====''Action Comics'' backup and ''Jimmy Olsen''====
DC Comics has reported in solicits{{when|date=October 2016}} that [[Nick Spencer]] and R.B. Silva will be producing a monthly 10-page backup feature in ''[[Action Comics]]'' chronicling the adventures of Jimmy Olsen in Metropolis. Reported story topics include an alien civilization choosing Metropolis as the base of a major cultural celebration, and the introduction of [[Chloe Sullivan]] (from the ''[[Smallville]]'' television series) to the DCU proper. In the latest arc, he goes on a charity date with a girl named Maggie, only to discover that she somehow has ties to [[Mister Mxyzptlk|Mr. Mxyzptlk]], and that she wants to marry him.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The last three chapters of the story are told in the self-titled one-shot, ''Jimmy Olsen''.

==Powers, abilities, and equipment==
[[Image:Jimmyolsentransformations.jpg|Cover art for ''Superman: The Amazing Transformations of Jimmy Olsen'', by [[Brian Bolland]].|thumb]]

Jimmy possesses a watch which emits a high-pitched signal only Superman can hear. In a 2010 story, he claimed it stopped working some time in the past, never worked particularly well in the first place, and contacted Superman through [[Morse code]] now, anyway, but still wore it for show.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Nick Spencer|Spencer, Nick]]|penciller= [[R. B. Silva|Silva, R. B.]]|inker= Freitas, Denis|story= Jimmy Olsen's Big Week Day One|title= [[Action Comics]]|issue= #893|date= November 2010}}</ref>

Mostly during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], Jimmy would find himself temporarily transformed, for better or worse, or undergo a disguise for various purposes. The variety of transformations Jimmy received during the Silver Age is often homaged or parodied in later comics and adaptations featuring the character — for instance, in ''[[JLA: The Nail]]'', Jimmy cites three of these transformations as his motivations behind backing Luthor's bill to outlaw metahumans and in ''Countdown'', Jimmy is used as a spirit container for the deceased New Gods, causing him to exhibit strange powers, albeit uncontrollably, with other stories simply making passing references.

===''JLA: The Nail''===
[[Image:Jimmynail.PNG|Jimmy Olsen in ''The Nail''. Art by [[Alan Davis]].|thumb]]
''[[JLA: The Nail]]'' is set in an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate reality]] in which a nail punctures a tire on the Kents' car, preventing them from finding the spaceship containing a baby Kal-El; subsequently, Kal-El never becomes Superman. Jimmy Olsen, an aide to Metropolis Mayor [[Lex Luthor]], is revealed to be the primary villain. Having discovered Superman's spaceship and using [[DNA]] samples to create numerous [[Bizarro]] [[Clone (genetics)|clone]]s, Luthor grafts [[Krypton (planet)|Kryptonian]] DNA onto subjects who either die instantly or mutate before death, except Olsen. The graft gives Olsen superpowers, but also drives him insane, mentally transforming him into a Kryptonian determined to replace human life with Kryptonian life. Olsen plays up the public's fear of superheroes via [[propaganda]], encouraging the popular view of them as alien invaders rather than the enhanced humans of the Justice Society, hoping to have them imprisoned so he can use their DNA as well in an attempt to create a stable template to create other new Kryptonians.

When his secret identity is revealed, he engages in a fight with the [[Justice League]] that spills into the local countryside. An [[Amish]] farmer attempts to stop Olsen but is blasted by his heat vision—which reveals that the farmer is the (now adult) Kal-El. In this reality, an Amish couple had raised Kal-El as a [[pacifism|pacifist]] encouraged to ignore worldly affairs so that he could walk in righteousness. Olsen asks Kal-El to join him, claiming that they are virtually brothers with the same DNA. When Kal-El refuses, Olsen kills Kal-El's foster parents. During the subsequent battle, Jimmy's body rejects the Kryptonian DNA, causing him to disintegrate. His last words to Kal-El are: "We should have been friends". The Justice League asks Kal-El to join them, recognising that his DNA had just been a contributing factor to a chain of events that had driven Jimmy insane rather than bringing out something that was not there before.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Alan Davis|Davis, Alan]]|penciller= Davis, Alan|inker= [[Mark Farmer|Farmer, Mark]]|story= The Nail|title= [[JLA: The Nail]]|issue= #3|date= November 1998}}</ref>

=====''Adventures of Superman''=====
On the ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]'' television series (starring [[George Reeves]]), Jimmy Olsen was portrayed by [[Jack Larson]], who appeared as the cub reporter from 1952 to 1958. Largely because of the popularity of Larson and his portrayal of the character, National Comics Publications (DC Comics) decided in 1954 to create ''[[Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen]]'', a regular title featuring Jimmy as the leading character.<ref>{{cite AV media|people= Golding, James Grant and Smith, Steven (writers); [[Kevin Burns|Burns, Kevin]] (director)|title= [[Look, Up in the Sky: The Amazing Story of Superman]]|medium= documentary film|publisher= [[Warner Home Video]]|location= Burbank, California|date= June 20, 2006}}</ref> Decades later in 1996, Larson portrayed an unnaturally aged Jimmy Olsen in an episode of ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]''.<ref name="loisandclark">{{cite episode|title= Brutal Youth|series= Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman|serieslink= Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman|credits= [[Tim Minear|Minear, Tim]] (writer); [[David Grossman (director)|Grossman, David]] (director)|network= [[American Broadcasting Company]]|airdate= October 20, 1996|season= 4|number= 5}}</ref>

Whalin gave a portrayal closer to previous incarnations of the character, playing Jimmy as a lovably naive rookie. When Whalin took over the role, more emphasis was placed on Jimmy's love-life and he would frequently seek out Lois, Clark and Perry's advice on these matters. Whalin's Olsen was described as being a computer whiz and these talents often came in useful to Lois and Clark/Superman, particularly in the episode 'Virtually Destroyed' where Jimmy's computing abilities come in handy as Lois and Superman battle a villain inside of a virtual reality simulator. Jimmy's home life and background is described in some detail throughout the course of the show. Although we never see her, some references are made to Jimmy's mother who is described as being overweight and having allergies. Jimmy's father Jack Olsen is a James Bond-like secret agent for the fictional National Intelligence Agency (N.I.A.) and the episode 'The Dad who Came in from the Cold' is entirely devoted to this character.

=====''Smallville''=====
<!-- Do not remove the Smallville title as it is used as a redirect link for the Smallville box -->In ''[[Smallville]]'' the series incarnation of Jimmy Olsen is first referenced in [[Smallville (Season 2)|Season 2]] by [[Chloe Sullivan]] ([[Allison Mack]]), when she refers to a "cute boy" she met in Metropolis that made her forget all about Smallville for the summer. His name is first given in [[Smallville (Season 4)|Season 4]] when Chloe says that he was her "first time". In [[Smallville (Season 6)|Season 6]]'s premiere "Zod", he appears in person (played by [[Aaron Ashmore]]) on the staff of the ''Daily Planet'' and prefers to be called "James". As Season 6 progresses, Jimmy and Chloe become a couple again. At first Jimmy is jealous of [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent]] but their relationship becomes friendly after Clark reunites him with Chloe in the Season 6 episode "Trespass".

In [[Smallville (Season 7)|Season 7]], Jimmy is still at the ''Daily Planet'' working as a budding photographer, his relationship with Chloe is going through a rough phase due to Chloe's new-found abilities caused by an amount of [[Kryptonite]] meteor in her blood stream. They broke up in a very emotional scene in the episode "Cure" since Chloe was unable to share her secret with him. Meanwhile, [[Kara Zor-El]] ([[Laura Vandervoort]]), daughter of [[Zor-El]] and thus Clark's cousin, has developed a crush on Jimmy and they become friends. Jimmy is smitten by her and teams up with her in episodes such as "Cure" and "Lara". They are in a relationship briefly, but they break up and Jimmy is shown to be in a relationship again with Chloe in the episode "Sleeper". In the season finale, he proposed to her but she was arrested before she had the time to answer.

In [[Smallville (Season 8)|Season 8]]'s premiere "Odyssey", Jimmy is seen waiting for Chloe at the Talon. Chloe arrives and Jimmy tells her that he takes back his proposal saying it might risk what they have between them. But Chloe disagrees. She reveals that she loves Jimmy and says that she will gladly be his wife. She kisses Jimmy passionately afterwards. In "Committed", Jimmy admits to Chloe that he lied about his father being a [[Manhattan]] [[Investment banking|investment banker]]; Jimmy says his father was an [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]] and a [[mechanic]] in [[Oklahoma City]] and has never met his mother. He apologizes for lying but she hugs him. In "Bride", Jimmy marries Chloe in the Kent barn but the reception is interrupted by [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]], who nearly kills Jimmy and kidnaps Chloe. Jimmy's condition is so serious he must be taken to a hospital in [[Star City (comics)|Star City]]. In "Turbulence", Jimmy sees Davis Bloome (Doomsday's human form) murder a drunk driver and becomes almost violently obsessed with proving it. Davis convinces Chloe that Jimmy is hallucinating from high doses of pain medication, ultimately ending Chloe and Jimmy's marriage and causing Jimmy to become addicted to his pain medication. In Season 8's finale "[[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]]", Chloe and Jimmy finally reconcile after Jimmy discovered Clark's secret and understood why Chloe had been with Davis to protect Clark from his Kryptonian alter-ego, [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]]. As Chloe gives Jimmy a passionate kiss, Jimmy is mortally wounded by a jealous Davis who was stripped of his Kryptonian persona by Clark and Chloe. Before succumbing to his injury, Jimmy kills Davis. At his funeral, his full name is revealed to be '''Henry James Olsen'''. His camera is given to his younger brother (portrayed by Ryan Harder). While Jimmy's younger brother's name is not mentioned, the boy is wearing a bow tie,<ref>{{cite episode|title=Doomsday|series=Smallville|credits= Peterson, Brian; Souders, Kelly (writers) and Marshall, James (director)|network=[[The CW Television Network|The CW]]|airdate= May 14, 2009|season=8|number=22}}</ref> leading to the possibility that ''this'' is Jimmy Olsen (James Bartholomew Olsen), who will befriend Superman.

In the series finale, it is verified that the brother at Henry James' funeral is the "real" Jimmy Olsen, who is trying to follow his late brother's footsteps after being recruited as a news photographer at the Daily Planet. The young adult version of the character is also portrayed by Aaron Ashmore.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Finale|series=Smallville|credits= Septien, Al; Meyer, Turi; Peterson, Brian; Souders, Kelly (writers); Fair, Kevin G.; Beeman, Greg(directors)|network= The CW|airdate= May 13, 2011|season=10|number=21}}</ref>

The 2008 DVD box set for [[Smallville (season 7)|the seventh season of ''Smallville'']] includes a 22-minute featurette, entitled ''Jimmy on Jimmy'', which is a round-table discussion featuring four of the six surviving actors at the time who had portrayed Jimmy Olsen in live action: [[Jack Larson]] (''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]''), [[Marc McClure]] ([[Superman in film|''Superman'' film series]], [[Supergirl (1984 film)|''Supergirl'' film]]), [[Sam Huntington]] (''[[Superman Returns]]''), and [[Aaron Ashmore]] (''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'').
