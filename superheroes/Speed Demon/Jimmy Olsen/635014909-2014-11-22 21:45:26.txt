'''James Bartholomew  "Jimmy" Olsen''' is a [[fictional character]] who appears mainly in [[DC Comics]]’ [[Superman]] stories. Olsen is a young [[photojournalist]] working for the ''[[Daily Planet]]''. He is close friends with [[Lois Lane]], [[Clark Kent]]/[[Superman]] and [[Perry White]]. Olsen looks up to his coworkers as [[role model]]s and [[father figure|parent figures]].

==Fictional character profile==
Jimmy is traditionally depicted as a [[bow tie]]-wearing, [[red hair|red-haired]] young man who works as a cub [[reporter]] and [[photographer]] for ''The [[Daily Planet]]'', alongside [[Lois Lane]] and [[Clark Kent]], whom he idolizes as career role models. In most depictions of the character, he has a strong friendship with Superman. As Superman's friend, Jimmy has special access to the Man of Steel, thanks to Superman's gift to Jimmy of a "signal [[watch]]," a wristwatch which, with the press of a button, emits a special [[Ultrasound|ultrasonic]] frequency signal that Superman can hear anywhere on Earth. (In [[Post-Crisis]] continuity Jimmy invented the watch himself, and Superman briefly considered confiscating it. In [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|New Earth]] continuity, the watch was designed by Superman based on a larger signaling device Jimmy created.)

In many [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], Jimmy was often seen sharing adventures with Superman, who saved him from various predicaments ranging from dangerous to merely embarrassing. This was particularly pronounced in the series ''[[Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen]]'' published from 1954 to 1974, which saw Olsen in a variety of [[slapstick]] adventures and strange transformations. Like most DC characters, [[Modern Age of Comic Books|modern]] portrayals of Olsen have been more serious in tone.

An important part of the Superman mythos, Jimmy Olsen has appeared in most other media adaptations of the character.

==Publication history==
An unnamed "office boy" with a bow tie makes a brief appearance in the story "Superman's Phony Manager" published in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #6 (November 1938), which is claimed to be Jimmy Olsen's first appearance by several reference sources.<ref>{{cite book|last= Wallace|first= Daniel|title= Superman: The Ultimate Guide to the Man of Steel|publisher= [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year= 2013|page= 126|isbn= 978-1465408754}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last= Wallace|first= Daniel|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1930s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 21 |quote = ''Action Comics'' #6 (November 1938) The Man of Steels's future pal Jimmy Olsen made his first appearance within this issue of ''Action Comics'', although he was identified only as an "inquisitive office-boy.}}</ref><ref>[http://www.comics.org/issue/349/ ''Action Comics'' #6 (November 1938)] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]</ref> The character was first introduced as Jimmy Olsen in the radio show ''[[The Adventures of Superman (radio)|The Adventures of Superman]]'' on April 15, 1940<ref name="Markstein">{{cite web |url= http://www.toonopedia.com/jimmyo.htm|title= Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen|first= Don|last= Markstein|year= 2008|publisher= [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]]|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6QyZoThLM|archivedate= July 10, 2014|deadurl= no}}</ref> mainly "so the Man of Steel would have someone to talk to."<ref>{{cite comic|story= Lightning Bolts|title= [[Black Lightning]]|issue= 3|date= July 1977}}</ref> With Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster creating and drawing the physical appearance and giving him a bigger personality, the character moved from the radio show back into the comics in 1941, first appearing as a named character in the story "Superman versus The Archer" in ''Superman'' #13 (November–December 1941).<ref>Wallace "1940s" in Dolan, p. 37 "''Superman'' #13 (November–December 1941) Jimmy Olsen made his first appearance as a named character in this issue."</ref><ref>[http://www.comics.org/issue/1753/ ''Superman'' #13 (Nov.-Dec.1941)] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> But after a handful of appearances, he disappeared again. In late 1953, while [[Jack Larson]] was playing the character on the ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]'' television show where he was referred to as "Jim Olsen", the character was revived in the Superman comics after a 10-year absence and then given his own title.

In addition to Larson, he was portrayed by [[Tommy Bond]] in the two Superman film [[Serial (film)|serials]], [[Superman (serial)|''Superman'' (1948)]] and ''[[Atom Man vs. Superman]]'' (1950); [[Marc McClure]] in the [[Superman film series|''Superman'' films]] of the 1970s and 1980s, as well as the 1984 film ''[[Supergirl (film)|Supergirl]]''; [[Michael Landes]] in the first season of ''[[Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'' and [[Justin Whalin]] in the subsequent three seasons; [[Sam Huntington]] in the 2006 film ''[[Superman Returns]]''; and [[Aaron Ashmore]] in [[the CW]]'s ''[[Smallville]]''.

===Jack Kirby's Fourth World===
[[Jack Kirby]] began by introducing a secret "[[Project Cadmus|D.N.A. Project]]" to create Mutated Humans for Good, adding "The Hairies" (a group of technology-equipped hippies), superbeings from other planets (proto-New Gods), [[Intergang]], and [[Morgan Edge]]... and reintroduced his 1940s Newsboy Legion characters.<ref>McAvennie, Michael "1970s" in Dolan, p. 141 "Since no ongoing creative team had been slated to ''Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen'', "King of Comics" Jack Kirby made the title his DC launch point, and the writer/artist's indelible energy and ideas permeated every panel and word balloon of the comic."</ref> About halfway through his run, Kirby introduced [[vampire]]s, the [[Loch Ness Monster]], and Victor Volcanum, the fire-eating archcriminal. Readership quickly dropped back to its pre-Kirby levels.

Kirby's tenure on the series ended with issue #148; and with issue #164 (April–May 1974) Jimmy's book was folded into the [[anthology]] title ''[[The Superman Family]]''.<ref>McAvennie "1970s" in Dolan, p. 159 "DC's 100-page Super Spectaculars were proving popular, so DC said goodnye to ''Supergirl'', ''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen'', ''Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane'', and housed the characters together in ''Superman Family''.  Continuing the numbering from where ''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen'' ended, the series featured classic reprints with new tales in the lead spot."</ref> In that series, Olsen became a more serious character who battled criminals as an [[investigative reporter]] known as "Mr. Action" in urban crime stories that rarely involved Superman. Jimmy Olsen appeared in new stories in ''The Superman Family'' #164, 167, 170, 173, 176, 179, and 182-222.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Wells|first= John|title= ''Superman Family'' Portraits|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 62|pages= 44–54|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date= February 2013}}</ref>

===Modern adventures===

====''The Man of Steel''====
Following ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', the entire Superman mythos was rebooted from scratch in the limited series ''The Man of Steel''. Despite recent modernization efforts on Superman and his supporting characters, Jimmy Olsen has not been significantly changed in the Modern Age. He is still a cub reporter working for ''The Daily Planet'', and is still friends with Superman. His look was made over as he stopped wearing bowties, and started wearing casual clothing (though this trend started in 1970s comics). An interesting alteration to the relationship was that Jimmy designed the signal watch himself, leading to his first meeting with Superman.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]]|penciller= [[Win Mortimer|Mortimer, Win]]|inker= [[Dick Giordano|Giordano, Dick]]; [[Sal Trapani|Trapani, Sal]]|story= Friends in Need|title= World of Metropolis|issue= 4|date= November 1988}}</ref> Superman briefly considered confiscating the watch, but decided he trusted Jimmy to use it responsibly.

While Jimmy's transformations no longer occur as regularly as they did in the Silver Age, Jimmy did become Elastic Lad on contact with the [[Eradicator (comics)|Eradicator]]. He has taken the identity of "Turtle Boy" in a series of [[pizza]] [[commercials]], made when he was temporarily laid off from the ''Planet''.

In the 1990s, Jimmy moved to Metropolis broadcaster Galaxy Broadcasting, where he became more brash and arrogant. This came to an end when he thought (wrongly) he had discovered Superman's [[secret identity]] and said he would announce it live on air. He reconsidered his actions, but lost his job for wasting the timeslot. He was again rehired by the ''Planet''.

Jimmy later came under the angry hand of the [[Alpha Centurion]], an alternate universe dictator with a deep-seated hatred for Superman and an eye toward Lois Lane. It was Jimmy who first uncovered his secret plot to control the world's finances through his company Aelius Industries, Inc.

====''Superman: Metropolis''====
June 2003 saw Jimmy Olsen as the focus of a twelve-part miniseries entitled ''Superman: Metropolis''. Written by [[Chuck Austen]] and illustrated by Danijel Zezelj, the series focused on the futuristic [[technology]] unleashed in Metropolis by [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]] in a previous storyline, and how it affected the everyday lives of Metropolis citizens.

Recently, Jimmy had taken a position as a regular star reporter for ''The Daily Planet'', replacing the recently demoted Clark Kent. This caused a strain in the ''Daily Planet.''

====''Countdown''====

====''Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen Special''====
{{Main|Superman: New Krypton}}
During Superman's fight with [[Atlas (DC Comics)|Atlas]], Jimmy witnesses a [[Codename: Assassin|mysterious figure]] hovering over the fight. After some encouraging words from Clark Kent, he decides to take two weeks off to investigate.

He tracks down a figure connected with the past of [[Codename: Assassin|Jonathan Drew]] and is told the story of how Jonathan became Codename: Assassin. His informant is quickly executed by Codename: Assassin who then tries to kill Jimmy. Jimmy is able to avoid being killed and is apparently shielded from Codename: Assassin's telepathy due to his own many physical transformations over the years.

Jimmy goes to [[Project Cadmus]] and speaks to [[Dubbilex]], who tells him the story about the death of the original [[Guardian (DC Comics)|Guardian]] at the hands of Codename: Assassin and how cloning is such an imperfect science that the only viable clone alive went into hiding in the desert. Dubbilex then dies from injuries sustained in an earlier conflict with Codename: Assassin. Jimmy heads south to the town of Warpath, AZ, managing to avoid conflict with Codename: Assassin on the way.

Upon arriving in Warpath, Jimmy interviews the sheriff, [[Vigilante (comics)|Greg Saunders]], who evades his questions. Jimmy follows him after dark and sees Saunders working with [[Guardian (DC Comics)|the last Guardian clone]]. He then confronts the clone at his home and the two speak.

With his two weeks up, Jimmy returns to Metropolis horrified from learning that a faction within the US military is actively plotting to kill Superman.

Willing to do anything to uncover the conspiracy behind [[List of government agencies in DC Comics#Project 7734|Project 7734]], Jimmy uses an anonymous [[online chat|chat]] server and gets in contact with Erik/Amazing Woman from [[Infinity Inc.]], who claims to have informations useful to help Jimmy. Despite being actively pursued by Codename: Assassin, who goes so far to place bugs in his house, Jimmy goes to the appointment, only to find Erik's house burned to the ground.

Jimmy pulls Erik out, who with his dying breath, shifts to his more reliable and powerful Erika form. Erik gives him [[Natasha Irons]]' number. Natasha contacts then Jimmy, telling him about the plans of General [[Sam Lane (comics)|Sam Lane]], his outworldly fortress and his capture, and use of a ''Planet Breaker'' weapon of [[Captain Atom]], now codenamed ''Project Breach'' (due to his similarity to [[Breach (comics)|Tim Zanetti]]'s fate).

Finally ready to uncover the truth, Jimmy is openly confronted by Codename: Assassin, who until that point had merely followed him closely. Jimmy uses his signal watch to call [[Lar Gand|Mon-El]]. Jimmy is shot twice in the chest by Codename: Assassin, and sinks into the ocean.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[James Robinson (writer)|Robinson, James]]|penciller= [[Bernard Chang|Chang, Bernard]]|inker= Chang, Bernard|story= The Death of Jimmy Olsen|title= Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen Special|issue= 2|date= October 2009}}</ref> Despite surviving his assassination attempt, Jimmy decides to fake his death, having his documents planted on a heavily disfigured corpse.

====''Action Comics'' backup and ''Jimmy Olsen''====
DC Comics has reported in solicits that [[Nick Spencer]] and R.B. Silva will be producing a monthly 10-page backup feature in ''[[Action Comics]]'' chronicling the adventures of Jimmy Olsen in Metropolis. Reported story topics include an alien civilization choosing Metropolis as the base of a major cultural celebration, and the introduction of [[Chloe Sullivan]] (from the ''[[Smallville]]'' television series) to the DCU proper. In the latest arc, he goes on a charity date with a girl named Maggie, only to discover that she somehow has ties to [[Mister Mxyzptlk|Mr. Mxyzptlk]], and that she wants to marry him.

The last three chapters of the story are told in the self-titled one-shot, ''Jimmy Olsen.''

==Powers, abilities, and equipment==
[[Image:Jimmyolsentransformations.jpg|Cover art for the [[trade paperback]] ''Superman: The Amazing Transformations of Jimmy Olsen'', by [[Brian Bolland]].|thumb]]

Jimmy possesses a watch which emits a high-pitched signal only Superman can hear.  In a 2010 story, he claimed it stopped working some time in the past, never worked particularly well in the first place, and contacted Superman through [[Morse code]] now, anyway, but still wore it for show.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Nick Spencer|Spencer, Nick]]|penciller= [[R.

Mostly during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], Jimmy would find himself temporarily transformed, for better or worse, or undergo a disguise for various purposes. The variety of transformations Jimmy received during the Silver Age is often homaged or parodied in later comics and adaptations featuring the character — for instance, in ''[[JLA: The Nail]]'', Jimmy cites three of these transformations as his motivations behind backing Luthor's bill to outlaw metahumans and in ''Countdown'', Jimmy is used as a spirit container for the deceased New Gods, causing him to exhibit strange powers, albeit uncontrollably, with other stories simply make passing references.

===JLA: The Nail===
[[Image:Jimmynail.PNG|Jimmy Olsen in ''The Nail''. Art by [[Alan Davis]].|thumb]]
In ''[[JLA: The Nail]]'', an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate reality]] in which a nail punctured a tire on the Kent's car, preventing them from finding the spaceship containing a baby Superman, Jimmy Olsen is revealed as the one behind all the other superheroes' troubles. Jimmy had served as an aide to [[Lex Luthor]]- who has become the mayor of Metropolis thanks to his efforts to provide Metropolis with a technologically-advanced police force to battle the threats that Superman was not there to defend the city against- following various short-lived attempts at heroism caused by temporary alteration of his DNA leaving him somewhat cynical of real heroes. Having discovered Superman's spaceship and using DNA samples to create numerous [[Bizarro]] [[Clone (genetics)|clone]]s, Luthor grafted [[Krypton (planet)|Kryptonian]] [[DNA]] onto Jimmy—the only such 'graft' that appeared successful, as other subjects either died instantly or mutated before death. This caused Jimmy to go insane, and possess superpowers similar to Superman's, as well as mentally transforming him into a Kryptonian determined to replace human life with Kryptonian life. Jimmy played up the public's fear of superheroes via [[propaganda]] encouraging the possibility of them as alien invaders rather than the enhanced humans of the Justice Society, hoping to have them imprisoned so he could use their [[DNA]] as well in an attempt to create a stable template to create other new Kryptonians. When Jimmy attacked an [[Amish]] couple and their son during a battle with the [[Justice League]]- which culminated in a desperate attempt by [[Batman]] and [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]] to stop him by supercharging Batman with his ring after Jimmy defeated the rest of the team-, the couple was killed, but the son was revealed to be Superman. In this alternate reality, the Amish couple had raised Superman, and brought him up as a [[pacifism|pacifist]] who was encouraged to ignore worldly affairs so that he could walk in righteousness, so he had never used his powers in conflict. Jimmy asked Superman to join him, claiming that they were virtually brothers as they shared the same DNA, but when Superman refused, the two battled. During the battle, Jimmy's body finally started to reject the Kryptonian DNA, causing him to disintegrate. His last, almost prophetic words were directed at Superman, "''We should have been friends''". The Justice League then asked Superman to join them, recognising that his DNA had only given Jimmy an opportunity to vent his pre-existing frustrations rather than bringing out something that was not there before.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Alan Davis|Davis, Alan]]|penciller= Davis, Alan|inker= [[Mark Farmer|Farmer, Mark]]|story= The Nail, Book Three of Three|title= [[JLA: The Nail]]|issue= 3|date= November 1998}}</ref>

===All-Star Superman===
In [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Frank Quitely]]'s ''[[All-Star Superman]]'' series, Jimmy shows up briefly in the Daily Planet offices in argyle socks; this Jimmy seems to be a refined version of the Silver Age vintage, with a signal watch halfway between a McDonald's [[happy meal]] toy and [[haute couture]]. He is shown with something that may be a jetpack. Issue #4 of the series focuses on Jimmy and his adventures as the one-day director of the [[DNA Project|DNA P.R.O.J.E.C.T.]], a leftover from the [[Jack Kirby]]-era Jimmy Olsen series. This is apparently the latest in a series of highly successful articles by Jimmy, in which he spends a day in various roles.

==In other media==

===Radio===
On the Superman radio series, [[Jackie Kelk|Jack Kelk]] and [[Jack Grimes (actor)|Jack Grimes]] portrayed Jimmy Olsen.

===Film===
Jimmy Olsen appeared in the ''[[Superman (1940s cartoons)|Superman]]'' animated short film "[[Showdown (1942 film)|Showdown]]", where he is voiced by actor [[Jack Mercer]].

The first actor to portray Jimmy Olsen in a live-action format was [[Tommy Bond]], who co-starred with [[Kirk Alyn]] (Superman/Clark Kent) and [[Noel Neill]] (Lois Lane) in the film serials ''[[Superman (serial)|Superman]]'' (1948) and ''[[Atom Man vs. Superman]]'' (1950).

In the four motion pictures starring [[Christopher Reeve]], beginning with ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman: The Movie]]'', Jimmy Olsen was portrayed by [[Marc McClure]]. McClure reprised his role as Jimmy Olsen in the 1984 [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] movie ''[[Supergirl (film)|Supergirl]]'', making McClure the only actor and Olsen the only character to appear in all five ''Superman'' films of the 1978-1987 era.

In [[Bryan Singer]]'s 2006 movie ''[[Superman Returns]]'', Jimmy Olsen is portrayed by [[Sam Huntington]], an older and more confident, yet goofier portrayal of the character who finds it difficult to get a good shot or get any photos published. In a deleted scene included in the DVD release, a slightly inebriated Olsen is seen to complain to Clark about the fact he has not had a photo printed in several months. In the film, [[Jack Larson]], who portrayed Jimmy in the ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]'' television series, plays Bo, a bartender who talks to Clark and Jimmy.  Singer originally offered [[Shawn Ashmore]] the role, but the actor declined due to his commitments to ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]].''<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=[[National Post]]|title=The Iceman Returneth|date=May 20, 2006|first=Bob |last=Thompson}}</ref> Ashmore's twin brother [[Aaron Ashmore]] played Jimmy in ''[[Smallville]]''.

Jimmy Olsen did not appear in [[Zack Snyder]]'s ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'' film.

On the television series ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'', Jimmy Olsen was portrayed by [[Michael Landes]] in the first season and [[Justin Whalin]] for the rest of the series' run.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1995-03-05/entertainment/9502210407_1_jimmy-olsen-superman-lois-clark|title= A Younger Jimmy Joins ''Lois & Clark''|first= Harriet|last= Winslow|date= March 5, 1995|publisher= ''[[Sun-Sentinel]]''|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130719215939/http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1995-03-05/entertainment/9502210407_1_jimmy-olsen-superman-lois-clark|archivedate= July 19, 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate= October 22, 2010}}</ref> The reason cited behind the change is that Landes looked too much like [[Dean Cain]] as well as to emphasize Jimmy's youth.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/16/arts/a-familiar-name-but-i-can-t-place-the-face.html|title= A Familiar Name, but I Can't Place the Face|first= Andy|last= Meisler|date= October 16, 1994 |publisher= ''[[The New York Times]]''|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130618083225/http://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/16/arts/a-familiar-name-but-i-can-t-place-the-face.html|archivedate= June 18, 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate= October 22, 2010}}</ref> Landes played Olsen as a cocksure, sarcastic [[Generation X]] character, who often seemed like he was very sure of himself although usually, the opposite was true. Whalin gave a portrayal closer to previous incarnations of the character, playing Jimmy as a lovably naive rookie. When Whalin took over the role, more emphasis was placed on Jimmy's love-life and he would frequently seek out Lois, Clark and Perry's advice on these matters. Whalin's Olsen was described as being a computer whiz and these talents often came in useful to Lois and Clark/Superman, particularly in the episode 'Virtually Destroyed' where Jimmy's computing abilities come in handy as Lois and Superman battle a villain inside of a virtual reality simulator. Jimmy's home life and background is described in some detail throughout the course of the show. Although we never see her, some references are made to Jimmy's mother who is described as being overweight and having allergies. Jimmy's father Jack Olsen is a James Bond-like secret agent for the fictional National Intelligence Agency (N.I.A.) and the episode 'The Dad who Came in from the Cold' is entirely devoted to this character.

===== ''Smallville'' =====
<!-- Do not remove the Smallville title as it is used as a redirect link for the Smallville box -->In ''[[Smallville]]'' the series incarnation of Jimmy Olsen is first referenced in [[Smallville (Season 2)|Season 2]] by [[Chloe Sullivan]] ([[Allison Mack]]), when she refers to a "cute boy" she met in Metropolis that made her forget all about Smallville for the summer. His name is first given in [[Smallville (Season 4)|Season 4]] when Chloe says that he was her "first time." In [[Smallville (Season 6)|Season 6]]'s premiere "[[General Zod|Zod]]", he appears in person (played by [[Aaron Ashmore]]) on the staff of the ''Daily Planet'' and prefers to be called "James". As Season 6 progresses, Jimmy and Chloe become a couple again. At first Jimmy is jealous of [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent]] but their relationship becomes friendly after Clark reunites him with Chloe in the Season 6 episode "Trespass".

In [[Smallville (Season 7)|Season 7]], Jimmy is still at ''Daily Planet'' working as a budding photographer, his relationship with Chloe is going through a rough phase due to Chloe's newfound abilities caused by an amount of [[Kryptonite]] meteor in her blood stream. They broke up in a very emotional scene in the episode "Cure" since Chloe was unable to share her secret with him. Meanwhile, [[Kara Zor-El]] ([[Laura Vandervoort]]) (Clark's cousin) has developed a crush on Jimmy and they become friends. Jimmy is smitten by her and teams up with her in episodes such as "Cure" and "Lara". They are in a relationship briefly, but they break up and Jimmy is shown to be in a relationship again with Chloe in the episode "Sleeper". In the season finale, he proposed to her but she was arrested before she had the time to answer.

In [[Smallville (Season 8)|Season 8]]'s premiere "Odyssey", Jimmy is seen waiting for Chloe at the Talon. Chloe arrives and Jimmy tells her that he takes back his proposal saying it might risk what they have between them. But Chloe disagrees. She reveals that she loves Jimmy and says that she'll gladly be his wife. She kisses Jimmy passionately afterwards. In "Committed", Jimmy admits to Chloe that he lied about his father being a [[Manhattan]] [[Investment banking|investment banker]]; Jimmy says his father was an [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]] and a [[mechanic]] in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma|Oklahoma City]] and has never met his mother, apologizingly for lying but she hugs him. In "Bride", Jimmy marries Chloe in the Kent barn but the reception is interrupted by [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]], who nearly kills Jimmy and kidnaps Chloe. Jimmy's condition is so serious he must be taken to a hospital in [[Star City (comics)|Star City]]. In "Turbulence", Jimmy sees Davis Bloome (Doomsday's human form) murder a drunk driver and becomes almost violently obsessed with proving it. Davis convinces Chloe that Jimmy is hallucinating from high doses of pain medication, ultimately ending Chloe and Jimmy's marriage and causing Jimmy to become addicted to his pain medication. In Season 8's finale "[[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]]", Chloe and Jimmy finally reconciled after Jimmy discovered Clark's secret and understood why Chloe had been with Davis to protect Clark from his kryptonian alter-ego: [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]]. As Chloe gives Jimmy a passionate kiss, Jimmy is mortally wounded by a jealous Davis who was stripped of his Kryptonian persona by Clark and Chloe. Before succumbing to his injury, Jimmy kills Davis. At his funeral, his full name is revealed to be '''Henry James Olsen'''. His camera is given to his younger brother (portrayed by Ryan Harder). While Jimmy's younger brother's name is not mentioned, the boy is wearing a bowtie,<ref>{{cite episode|title=Doomsday|series=Smallville|credits= Peterson, Brian; Souders, Kelly (writers) and Marshall, James (director)|network=[[The CW Television Network|The CW]]|airdate= May 14, 2009|season=8|number=22}}</ref> leading to the possibility that ''this'' is Jimmy Olsen (James Bartholomew Olsen), who will befriend Superman. In [[Smallville (Season 9)|Season 9]] finale, Clark has a premonition about the future in 2013 where [[Lois Lane (Smallville)|Lois Lane]] calls out to an "Olsen", likely calling the younger Jimmy Olsen.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Salvation|series=Smallville|credits= Septien, Al; Meyer, Turi (writers) and Beeman, Greg (director)|network= The CW|airdate= May 14, 2010|season=9|number=21}}</ref> In the [[Smallville (season 10)|Season 10]] episode "Homecoming", Clark accidentally time-travels to the future in 2017 (thanks to [[Brainiac 5]]) and reads a ''Daily Planet'' article that listed Jimmy Olsen. In the series finale, it verifies that the brother at Henry James' funeral is the "real" Jimmy Olsen, who is trying to follow his late brother's footsteps after being recruited as a news photographer at the Daily Planet. The young adult version of the character is also portrayed by Aaron Ashmore.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Finale|series=Smallville|credits= Septien, Al; Meyer, Turi; Peterson, Brian; Souders, Kelly (writers); Fair, Kevin G.; Beeman, Greg(directors)|network= The CW|airdate= May 13, 2011|season=10|number=21}}</ref>

The DVD box set for [[Smallville (season 7)|the seventh season of ''Smallville'']] includes a featurette entitled ''Jimmy on Jimmy''.  Approximately 22 minutes in length, ''Jimmy on Jimmy'' is a roundtable discussion featuring four of the six surviving actors who have portrayed Jimmy Olsen in live action: [[Jack Larson]] (''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]''), [[Marc McClure]] ([[Superman in film|''Superman'' film series]], ''[[Supergirl (film)|Supergirl]]''), [[Sam Huntington]] (''[[Superman Returns]]''), and [[Aaron Ashmore]] (''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'').  [[Michael Landes]] and [[Justin Whalin]] (both from ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'') did not participate.

====Animation====
[[Jack Grimes (voice actor)|Jack Grimes]] reprised his role as Jimmy Olsen in ''[[The New Adventures of Superman (TV series)|The New Adventures of Superman]]''.

In the ''[[Super Friends]]'' animated series, he "appears" in the second episode of ''[[The World's Greatest Super Friends]]'' season, '[[Lex Luthor]] Strikes Back', with Lois Lane. It wasn't Jimmy at all, but Lex Luthor's henchman [[Otis (Superman)|Orville Gump]] in disguise.

[[Mark L. Taylor]] played Jimmy Olsen in the 1988 [[animated]] adaptation of [[Superman (1988 TV series)|Superman]].

In ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', Jimmy was played by voice actor [[David Kaufman (actor)|David Kaufman]]. One episode was called "Superman's Pal" as an homage to the classic comic series, and Superman gave Jimmy the signal watch by the end of the episode. Another allusion to the comics made in the show was seen in the second season episode "Mxyzpixilated," where Mr. Mxyzptlk turns all the employees of the Daily Planet into animals. Jimmy is turned into a turtle, possibly as a homage.

In ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' Jimmy makes a brief appearance in Superman's nightmare (in which Superman, uncontrollably strong, hugs him so hard he kills his friend) in "Only a Dream", with David Kaufman reprising the role. He makes a cameo at Superman's funeral in "Hereafter." A photographer with orange hair appears beside Clark at the beginning of "Starcrossed." Though his face isn't shown, it is likely Jimmy.

Jimmy had several [[cameo appearance]]s in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', including one episode where [[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]] used sleeping gas on him, tied him up, taped his mouth shut, and used the signal watch to attract Superman. In the episode "Chaos at the Earth's Core", several heroes battle a giant turtle that has a thatch of red hair. [[Bruce Timm]] has confirmed this is a reference to Jimmy's [[#Powers, abilities, and equipment|Giant Turtle Boy]] persona, "but it was more economical time-wise to have him revert to cute little turtle than naked, confused photographer."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://jl.toonzone.net/episode53/episode53.htm|title= Chaos at the Earth's Core|date= n.d.|publisher= Toonzone.net|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130603164940/http://jl.toonzone.net/episode53/episode53.htm|archivedate= June 3, 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate= June 20, 2007}}</ref>

Jimmy appeared in the Season 5 premiere of ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' played by voice actor [[Jack DeSena]]. He and [[Dick Grayson]] have a back and forth discussion about Batman and Superman from their sides of view.

Jimmy appears in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "Battle of the Super Heroes", voiced by [[Alexander Polinsky]]. The episode references him with his misadventures of him being transformed into a giant turtle, and having quills thanks to [[Mxyzptlk]].
