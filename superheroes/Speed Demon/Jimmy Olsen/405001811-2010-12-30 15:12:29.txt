'''James Bartholomew "Jimmy" Olsen''' is a [[fictional character]] who appears mainly in [[DC Comics]]’ [[Superman]] stories. Olsen is a young [[photojournalist]] working for the [[Daily Planet]]. He is close friends with [[Lois Lane]], [[Clark Kent]]/[[Superman]] and [[Perry White]]. Olsen looks up to his coworkers as [[role models]] and [[father figure|parent figures]].

==Fictional character profile==
Jimmy is traditionally depicted as a [[bow tie]]-wearing, [[red hair|red-haired]] young man who works as a cub [[reporter]] and [[photographer]] for ''The [[Daily Planet]]'', alongside [[Lois Lane]] and [[Clark Kent]], whom he idolizes as career role models. In most depictions of the character, he also has a strong friendship with Superman. As Superman's friend, Jimmy has special access to the Man of Steel, thanks to Superman's gift to Jimmy of a "signal [[watch]]," a wristwatch which, with the press of a button, emits a special [[Ultrasound|ultrasonic]] frequency signal that Superman can hear anywhere on Earth. (In [[Post-Crisis]] continuity Jimmy invented the watch himself, and Superman briefly considered confiscating it. In [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|New Earth]] continuity, the watch was designed by Superman based on a larger signaling device Jimmy created.)

In many [[Silver Age of comic books|Silver Age]] [[comic books]], Jimmy was often seen sharing adventures with Superman, who saved him from various predicaments ranging from dangerous to merely embarrassing. This was particularly pronounced in the series ''[[Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen (comic)|Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen]]'' (published from 1954 to 1974), which saw Olsen in a variety of [[slapstick]] adventures and strange transformations. Like most DC characters, [[Modern Age of Comic Books|modern]] portrayals of Olsen have been more serious in tone.

An important part of the Superman mythos, Jimmy Olsen has appeared in most other media adaptations of the character.

==Fictional character history==
An anonymous "copy boy" who resembles Olsen makes a brief appearance in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #6, but the character called Jimmy Olsen first appeared in the radio show ''[[The Adventures of Superman (radio)|The Adventures of Superman]]'' (on April 15, 1940) mainly "so the Man of Steel would have someone to talk to."<ref>"Lightning Bolts," ''Black Lightning'' #3 (July 1977).</ref> With Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster creating and drawing the physical appearance and giving him a bigger personality, the character moved briefly from the radio show into the comics in 1941, first appearing in ''Superman'' v1 #13 (1941). But after a handful of appearances, he disappeared again. In late 1953, while [[Jack Larson]] was playing the character on the ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]'' television show, the character was revived in the Superman comics after a 10-year absence and then given his own title. 

In addition to Larson, he was portrayed by [[Tommy Bond]] in the two [[Superman]] film [[Serial (film)|serials]], [[Superman (serial)|''Superman'' (1948)]] and ''[[Atom Man vs. Superman]]'' (1950); [[Marc McClure]] in the [[Superman film series|''Superman'' films]] of the 1970s and '80s, as well as the [[1984 in film|1984]] film ''[[Supergirl (film)|Supergirl]]''; [[Michael Landes]] in the first season of ''[[Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'' and [[Justin Whalin]] in the subsequent three seasons; [[Sam Huntington]] in the [[2006 in film|2006]] film ''[[Superman Returns]]''; and [[Aaron Ashmore]] in the CW's ''[[Smallville]]'.

===Golden and Silver Age===
{{Main|History of Superman}}
[[Image:Jimmyolsen.png|thumb|left|Jimmy Olsen, from ''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen'' #36 (1959). Art by [[Curt Swan]].]]

During the Silver Age, beginning in 1954, Jimmy starred in his own comic book, ''[[Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen]]'', which featured his various adventures with and without Superman. The stories in the title would often feature particularly outlandish situations, ranging from Jimmy being hurled back in time to [[Krypton (planet)|Krypton]] before its destruction in issue #36 to dealing frequently with [[gorillas in comic books|gorillas]] of all sorts.

This version of Jimmy Olsen even had his own fan club. In one adventure published in the 1960s, he implied that there were branches of it around the [[United States|country]] and that he intended to lecture them about anti-crime techniques he had learned from Superman and [[Batman]].<ref>illustration included in the ''Penguin Book of Comics'' by George Perry and Alan Aldridge, published in 1967.</ref> 

===Jack Kirby's Fourth World===
[[Jack Kirby|Kirby]] began by introducing a secret "D.N.A. Project" to create Mutated Humans for Good, also adding "The Hairies" (a group of technology-equipped hippies), superbeings from other planets (proto-New Gods), [[Intergang]], and [[Morgan Edge]]... and reintroduced his 1940s Newsboy Legion characters. About halfway through his run, Kirby introduced vampires, the Loch Ness monster, and Victor Volcanum, the fire-eating archcriminal. Readership quickly dropped back to its pre-Kirby levels.

Kirby's tenure on the series ended with issue #148; and in 1974 (with issue #163) Jimmy's book was folded into the [[anthology]] title ''[[Superman Family]]''. In that book, Olsen became a more serious character who battled criminals as an [[investigative reporter]] known as "Mr. Action" in urban crime stories that rarely involved Superman.

===Modern adventures===
====''The Man of Steel''====
Following ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', the entire Superman mythos was rebooted from scratch in the limited series ''The Man of Steel''. Despite recent modernization efforts on Superman and his supporting characters, Jimmy Olsen has not been significantly changed in the Modern Age. He is still a cub reporter working for ''The Daily Planet'', and is still friends with Superman. His look was made over as he stopped wearing bowties, and started wearing casual clothing (though this trend started in 1970s comics). An interesting alteration to the relationship was that Jimmy designed the signal watch himself, leading to his first meeting with Superman.<ref name="WoM4">''World of Metropolis'' #4 (1987)</ref> Superman briefly considered confiscating the watch, but decided he trusted Jimmy to use it responsibly.

While Jimmy's transformations no longer occur as regularly as they did in the Silver Age, Jimmy did become Elastic Lad on contact with the [[Eradicator (comics)|Eradicator]]. He has also taken the identity of "Turtle Boy" in a series of [[pizza]] [[commercials]], made when he was temporarily laid off from the ''Planet''.

In the 1990s, Jimmy moved to Metropolis broadcaster Galaxy Broadcasting, where he became more brash and arrogant. This came to an end when he thought (wrongly) he had discovered Superman's [[secret identity]] and said he would announce it live on air. He reconsidered his actions, but lost his job for wasting the timeslot. He was again rehired by the ''Planet''.

Jimmy later came under the angry hand of the [[Alpha Centurion]], an alternate universe dictator with a deep-seated hatred for Superman and an eye toward Lois Lane. It was Jimmy who first uncovered his secret plot to control the world's finances through his company Aelius Industries, Inc.

====''Superman: Metropolis''====
June 2003 saw Jimmy Olsen as the focus of a twelve-part miniseries entitled ''Superman: Metropolis''. Written by [[Chuck Austen]] and illustrated by Danijel Zezelj, the series focused on the futuristic [[technology]] unleashed in Metropolis by [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]] in a previous storyline, and how it affected the everyday lives of Metropolis citizens.

Recently, Jimmy had taken a position as a regular star reporter for ''The Daily Planet'', replacing the recently demoted Clark Kent. This caused a strain in the relationship between Clark and Jimmy. It appears, however, that following the [[One Year Later]] storyline jump, Clark has regained his original role as ''The Daily Planet'''s star reporter,<ref>''52: Week Eight'' (2006)</ref><ref name="SM650">''Superman'' #650 (2006)</ref> and Jimmy has returned to being a photographer, winning the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for his photographic efforts.

====''Countdown''====

{{Main|Countdown to Final Crisis}}

====''Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen Special''====
{{Main|Superman: New Krypton}}
During Superman's fight with [[Atlas (DC Comics)|Atlas]], Jimmy witnesses a [[Codename: Assassin|mysterious figure]] hovering over the fight. After some encouraging words from Clark Kent, he decides to take two weeks off to investigate.

He tracks down a figure connected with the past of [[Codename: Assassin|Jonathan Drew]] and is told the story of how Jonathan became Codename: Assassin. His informant is quickly executed by Codename: Assassin who then tries to kill Jimmy. Jimmy is able to avoid being killed and is apparently shielded from Codename: Assassin's telepathy due to his own many physical transformations over the years.

Jimmy goes to [[Project Cadmus]] and speaks to [[Dubbilex]], who tells him the story about the death of the original [[Guardian (DC Comics)|Guardian]] at the hands of Codename: Assassin and how cloning is such an imperfect science that the only viable clone alive went into hiding in the desert. Dubbilex then dies from injuries sustained in an earlier conflict with Codename: Assassin. Jimmy heads south to the town of Warpath, AZ, managing to avoid conflict with Codename: Assassin on the way.

Upon arriving in Warpath, Jimmy interviews the sheriff, [[Vigilante (comics)|Greg Saunders]], who evades his questions. Jimmy follows him after dark and sees Saunders working with [[Guardian (DC Comics)|the last Guardian clone]]. He then confronts the clone at his home and the two speak.

With his two weeks up, Jimmy returns to Metropolis horrified from learning that a faction within the US military is actively plotting to kill Superman.

Willing to do anything to uncover the conspiracy behind [[List of government agencies in DC Comics#Project 7734|Project 7734]], Jimmy uses an anonymous [[online chat|chat]] server and gets in contact with Erik/Amazing Woman from [[Infinity Inc.]], who claims to have informations useful to help Jimmy. Despite being actively pursued by Codename: Assassin, who goes so far to place bugs in his house, Jimmy goes to the appointment, only to find Erik's house burned to the ground.

Jimmy pulls Erik out, who with his dying breath, shifts to his more reliable and powerful Erika form. Erik gives him [[Natasha Irons]]' number. Natasha contacts then Jimmy, telling him about the plans of General [[Sam Lane]], his outworldly fortress and his capture, and use of a ''Planet Breaker'' weapon of [[Captain Atom]], now codenamed ''Project Breach'' (due to his similarity to [[Breach (comics)|Tim Zanetti]]'s fate).

Finally ready to uncover the truth, Jimmy is openly confronted by Codename: Assassin, who until that point had merely followed him closely. Jimmy uses his signal watch to call [[Lar Gand|Mon-El]]. Jimmy is shot twice in the chest by Codename: Assassin, and sinks into the ocean.<ref>''Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen Special'' #2 (August 2009)</ref>

Despite surviving his assassination attempt, Jimmy decides to fake his death, having his documents planted on a heavily disfigured corpse. With no one knowing about his survival, Jimmy moves into the old Pemberton Camera Factory, sharing the results of his now unhindered investigations with Perry and Mon-El.<ref>''Superman'' (vol. 1) #695 (December 2009)</ref>

====''Action Comics backup''====
DC Comics has reported in solicits that [[Nick Spencer]] and R.B. Silva will be producing a montly 10-page backup feature in [[Action Comics]] chronicling the adventures of Jimmy Olsen in Metropolis. Reported story topics range from an alien civilization choosing Metropolis as the base of a major cultural celebration and the introduction of [[Smallville]] character [[Chloe Sullivan]] to the DCU proper. IN the latest story he goes on a charity date with a girl named Jill. Just to find that she is Myzslpx daughter and have planned their wedding.

==Powers, abilities, and equipment==
[[Image:Jimmyolsentransformations.jpg|Cover art for the [[trade paperback]] ''Superman: The Amazing Transformations of Jimmy Olsen'', by [[Brian Bolland]].|thumb]]

Jimmy possesses a watch which emits a high-pitched signal only Superman can hear.  Recently he claimed it stopped working some time in the past, never worked particularly well in the first place, and contacted Superman through [[Morse code]] now, anyway, but still wore it for show.<ref>[[Nick Spencer]] (w); [[R.B. Silva]] (a). "Jimmy Olsen's Big Week, Day One", ''Action Comics'' #893, [[DC Comics]], cover date November 2010.</ref>

Mostly during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]], Jimmy would find himself temporarily transformed, for better or worse, or undergo a disguise for various purposes. The transformation tradition is still sometimes referenced in present-day comics, usually through [[homage]] or [[parody]]. 

The variety of transformations Jimmy received during the Silver Age is often homaged or parodied in later comics and adaptations featuring the character — for instance, in ''[[JLA: The Nail]]'', Jimmy cites three of these transformations as his motivations behind backing Luthor's bill to outlaw metahumans and in ''Countdown'', Jimmy is used as a spirit container for the deceased New Gods, causing him to exhibit strange powers, albeit uncontrollably, with other stories simply make passing references.

*Giant Turtle Boy: One of Jimmy's most frequently cited transformations was that of his turning into a giant turtle boy.<ref name="pal53">''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen'' #53 (1961)</ref>
*Elastic Lad - As Elastic Lad, Jimmy (by serum or by alien virus) could sometimes stretch himself, akin to [[Elongated Man]] or [[Plastic Man]].<ref name="pal37">''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen'' #37 (1959)</ref>  As Elastic Lad, Jimmy was inducted as an Honorary Member of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes (1958 team)|Legion of Super-Heroes]].<ref>''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen'' #72 (October 1963)</ref>
*[[Flamebird]]- This is the name he took as a costumed superhero, with Superman disguised as [[Nightwing]], in the shrunken [[Krypton (planet)|Kryptonian]] city of [[Kandor]]{{Issue|date=January 2010}}. These names were inspired by two native Kryptonian [[birds]], the nightwing and the flamebird, but the relationship between Nightwing and Flamebird intentionally paralleled the crime-fighting team [[Batman]] (a night-winged creature) and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] (a flame-colored bird).
*Speed Demon - In [[1956]], a month before the debut of [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] as the new [[Flash (comics)|Flash]], Jimmy drank a potion produced by a Professor Claude and briefly gained super-speed.{{Issue|date=January 2010}}
*Radioactive - After being exposed to a radioactive substance, Jimmy began to irradiate everything in his presence.
*Gorilla - When Jimmy switched minds with a gorilla, he went about his reporting duties as a gorilla in Jimmy's clothes.<ref name="pal24">''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen'' #24</ref>
*Mobidly Obese-Jimmy tried to get fat in order to stop a jewel smugliing and to impress a[[Circus Fat Lady]].
*Monstrous beard growth - The machinations of the sinister Beard Band cause Jimmy to grow an immense [[beard]].{{Issue|date=January 2010}}
*Alien-form - [[Extraterrestrial life in culture|Aliens]] transformed Jimmy into a telepathic [[Jupiter (planet)|Jovian]] for a week.{{Issue|date=January 2010}} Fortunately, this turned out to be a Jovian week ... which is much shorter than an Earth week (about 70 hours = slightly less than three days.)
*Wolf-Man - In the vein of the popular [[Michael Landon]] 1950s film ''[[I Was a Teenage Werewolf]]'', Jimmy found himself transformed into a [[werewolf]].<ref name="pal44">''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen'' #44 (1960)</ref>
*Hippie - Jimmy grew a beard and joined a Superman-hating band of [[hippie]]s.<ref name="pal118">''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen'' #118 (1969)</ref> On the cover of this story's issue, Jimmy's seen wielding a sign that says "Superman is a freak-out!"

==Other versions==
[[Image:Jimmynail.PNG|Jimmy Olsen in ''The Nail''. Art by [[Alan Davis]].|thumb]]
In ''[[JLA: The Nail]]'', an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate reality]] in which a nail punctured a tire on the Kent's car, preventing them from finding the spaceship containing a baby Superman, Jimmy Olsen is revealed as the one behind all the other superheroes' troubles. Jimmy had served as an aide to [[Lex Luthor]] following various short-lived attempts at heroism caused by temporary alteration of his DNA.

:Having discovered Superman's spaceship and using DNA samples to create numerous [[Bizarro]] [[Clone (genetics)|clone]]s, Luthor grafted [[Krypton (planet)|Kryptonian]] [[DNA]] onto Jimmy—the only such 'graft' that appeared successful, as other subjects either died instantly or mutated before death. This caused Jimmy to go insane, and possess superpowers similar to Superman's, as well as mentally transforming him into a Kryptonian determined to replace human life with Kryptonian life. Jimmy played up the public's fear of superheroes via [[propaganda]], hoping to have them imprisoned so he could use their [[DNA]] as well in an attempt to create a stable template.

:When Jimmy attacked an [[Amish]] couple and their son during a battle with the [[Justice League]], culminating in a desperate attempt by [[Batman]] and [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]] to stop him by supercharging Batman with his ring, the couple was killed, but the son was revealed to be Superman. In this alternate reality, the Amish couple had raised Superman, and brought him up as a [[pacifism|pacifist]], so he had never used his powers in conflict. Jimmy asked Superman to join him, claiming that they were virtually brothers as they shared the same DNA, but when Superman refused, the two battled. During the battle, Jimmy's body finally started to reject the Kryptonian DNA, causing him to disintegrate. His last, almost prophetic words were directed at Superman, "''We should have been friends''".The Justice League then asked Superman to join them.

*In [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s 1986 [[graphic novel]] [[The Dark Knight Returns]], an older Jimmy Olsen (James, as he is now called) appears on various TV shows, recalling the age of heroes, He later appeared in the 2001 sequels ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'', featured as the writer of a ''Daily Planet'' article titled "Truth to Power", where he attempts to reveal that the current President is a holographic projection. However, his attempts to publicize the truth are halted by [[Lex Luthor]] as Metropolis is destroyed (killing hundreds, including Jimmy, [[Lois Lane|Lois]], and [[Perry White|Perry]]) by [[Brainiac (comics)|BrainIAC]].

*In ''[[Superman: Red Son]]'', written by [[Mark Millar]], Jimmy is depicted as an agent of the [[CIA]], eventually becoming the director, and soon joins Dr. Lex Luthor in his Presidential bid and becomes [[Vice-President]]. His look and model in the series is based on [[James Jesus Angleton]], who served in the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}.
*In [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Frank Quitely]]'s [[All Star Superman]] series, Jimmy shows up briefly in the Daily Planet offices in argyle socks; this Jimmy seems to be a refined version of the Silver Age vintage, with a signal watch halfway between a McDonald's [[happy meal]] toy and [[haute couture]]. He's also shown with something that may be a jetpack. Issue #4 of the series focuses on Jimmy and his adventures as the one-day director of the DNA P.R.O.J.E.C.T., a leftover from the [[Jack Kirby]]-era Jimmy Olsen series. This is apparently the latest in a series of highly successful articles by Jimmy, in which he spends a day in various roles. This version of Jimmy also became that reality's version of [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]].<ref name="allstar4">''All Star Superman'' #4 (2006)</ref>
*Jimmy Olsen makes an appearance in ''[[All Star Batman and Robin|Frank Miller's All Star Batman and Robin The Boy Wonder]]'' #6, helping [[Vicki Vale]], who he appears to be attracted to, escape from hospital and giving her files on Batman and the Flying [[Dick Grayson|Graysons]]. This incarnation is described as a cub reporter for the ''Gotham Gazette'' as opposed to his regular position at the ''Daily Planet'' and as 'Superman's Pal'. However he is still young, so he may yet work for the Planet.

==Parody/Homage==
*In [[Alan Moore]] and [[Gene Ha]]'s ''[[Top 10 (comic book)|Top 10]]'', a photograph of a version of two of Jimmy's superpowered selves, merged, is shown to Andy Soames; having contracted a disease which warps powers, this version appears to be Turtle Boy, driven insane by the acquisition of Elastic Lad's powers.
*In [[Lord Havok]] and the [[Extremists (comics)|Extremists]] #3, a variation of Jimmy called '''[[Robin (comics)|Robin]] Olsen''', is shown as a member of [[Monarch (comics)|Monarch's]] army.
* In [[Alan Moore]]'s ''[[Supreme (comics)|Supreme]]'', Billy Friday is a young, red-haired associate of Ethan Crane/Supreme; Friday eventually becomes/merges with Master Meteor, a time-travelling villain powered by the reality-bending substance Supremium, and becomes the insane Supremium Man.

On the television series ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'', Jimmy Olsen was portrayed by [[Michael Landes]] in the first season and [[Justin Whalin]] for the rest of the series' run.<ref>{{cite news|title= A Younger Jimmy Joins `Lois & Clark'|work= Sun Sentinel|date=|url= http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1995-03-05/entertainment/9502210407_1_jimmy-olsen-superman-lois-clark|accessdate=2010-10-22}}</ref> The reason cited behind the change is that Landes looked too much like [[Dean Cain]] as well as to emphasize Jimmy's youth.<ref>{{cite news|title= A Familiar Name, but I Can't Place the Face|work= The New York Times|date=|url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70D12F634590C758DDDA90994DC494D81|accessdate=2010-10-22}}</ref>

Landes played Olsen as a cocksure, sarcastic [[Generation X|Generation-X]] character, who often seemed like he was very sure of himself (although usually, the opposite was true). Whalin gave a portrayal closer to previous incarnations of the character, playing Jimmy as a lovably naive rookie. When Whalin took over the role, more emphasis was placed on Jimmy's love-life and he would frequently seek out Lois, Clark and Perry's advice on these matters. Also, Whalin's Olsen was described as being a computer whiz and these talents often came in useful to Lois and Clark/Superman, particularly in the episode 'Virtually Destroyed' where Jimmy's computing abilities come in handy as Lois and Superman battle a villain inside of a virtual reality simulator.

Jimmy's home life and background is described in some detail throughout the course of the show. Although we never see her, some references are made to Jimmy's mother who is described as being overweight and having allergies. Jimmy's father Jack Olsen is a James Bond-like secret agent for the fictional National Intelligence Agency (N.I.A.) and the episode 'The Dad who Came in from the Cold' is entirely devoted to this character.

<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Aaron Ashmore.jpg|thumb|right|[[Aaron Ashmore]] as Jimmy Olsen in "Smallville".]] --><!-- Do not remove the Smallville title as it is used as a redirect link for the Smallville box -->In ''[[Smallville]]'' a version Jimmy Olsen is first referenced, by first name only (as [[Chloe Sullivan]]'s "first time"), in Season 4. He appears in person, played by [[Aaron Ashmore]], in the season premiere of Season 6, now on staff at the ''Planet'', and he prefers to be called "James". Jimmy and Chloe became a couple again after their reunion in the Season 6 premiere "[[General Zod|Zod]]". At first Jimmy is jealous of Clark but their relationship becomes friendly after Clark reunites him with Chloe in the Season 6 episode "Trespass".

In Season 7, Jimmy is still at ''Daily Planet'' working as a budding photographer, his relationship with Chloe is going through a rough phase due to Chloe's newfound abilities caused by an amount of [[Kryptonite]] meteor in her blood stream. They broke up in a very emotional scene in the episode "Cure" since Chloe was unable to share her secret with him. Meanwhile Clark's newly arrived Kryptonian cousin [[Kara Zor-El]] ([[Laura Vandervoort]]) has developed a crush on Jimmy and they become friends. Jimmy is also smitten by her and teams up with her in episodes like "Cure" and "Lara". They are in a relationship briefly, but they break up and Jimmy is shown to be in a relationship again with Chloe in the episode "Sleeper". In the season finale, he proposed to her but she was arrested before she had the time to answer.

In the eighth season premiere "Odyssey", Jimmy is seen waiting for Chloe at the Talon. Chloe arrives and Jimmy tells her that he takes back his proposal saying it might risk what they have between them. But Chloe disagrees. She reveals that she loves Jimmy and says that she'll gladly be his wife. She kisses Jimmy passionately afterwards. In "Committed," Jimmy admits to Chloe that he lied about his father being a [[Manhattan]] [[Investment banking|investment banker]]; Jimmy says his father was an [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]] and a [[mechanic]] in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma|Oklahoma City]]. He never met his mom. He apologizes for lying but she hugs him. In "Bride," Jimmy marries Chloe in the Kent barn but the reception is interrupted by [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]], who nearly kills Jimmy and kidnaps Chloe. Jimmy's condition is so serious he must be taken to a hospital in [[Star City (comics)|Star City]]. In "Turbulence", Jimmy sees Davis Bloome (Doomsday's human form) murder a drunk driver and becomes almost violently obsessed with proving it. Davis convinces Chloe that Jimmy is hallucinating from high doses of pain medication, ultimately ending Chloe and Jimmy's marriage and causing Jimmy to become addicted to his pain medication. 

In the finale of Season 8, Chloe and Jimmy finally reconciled after Jimmy discovered Clark's secret and understood why Chloe had been with Davis to protect Clark from his kryptonian alter-ego: [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]]. Chloe gave Jimmy his final passionate kiss before Jimmy was killed by Davis who was stripped of his kryptonian persona by Clark and Chloe. Yet, before his death, Jimmy killed Davis. At his funeral, his full name is revealed to be '''Henry James Olsen''', not James Bartholomew Olsen. His camera is given to his younger brother (portrayed by [[Ryan Harder]]). His name is not mentioned but the boy is wearing a bowtie,<ref>{{cite episode|title=Doomsday|series=Smallville|credits=Brian Peterson, Kelly Souders (writers) & James Marshall (director)|network=[[The CW Television Network|The CW]]|airdate=2009-05-14|season=8|number=22}}</ref> leading to the possibility that ''this'' is the Jimmy Olsen that will befriend Superman. In the season 9 finale, Clark has a premonition about the future in 2016, where Lois calls out Olsen, obviously meaning Henry was not Jimmy.

=====''Jimmy on Jimmy''=====
The DVD box set for [[Smallville (season 7)|the seventh season of ''Smallville'']] includes a featurette entitled ''Jimmy on Jimmy''.  Approximately 22 minutes in length, ''Jimmy on Jimmy'' is a roundtable discussion featuring four of the six surviving actors who have portrayed Jimmy Olsen in live action: [[Jack Larson]] (''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]''), [[Marc McClure]] ([[Superman (film series)|''Superman'' film series]], ''[[Supergirl (film)|Supergirl]]''), [[Sam Huntington]] (''[[Superman Returns]]''), and [[Aaron Ashmore]] (''[[Smallville]]'').  [[Michael Landes]] and [[Justin Whalin]] (both from ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'') do not participate.

=====''Super Friends''=====
In the ''[[Super Friends]]'' animated series, he "appears" in the second episode of ''[[The World's Greatest Super Friends]]'' season, '[[Lex Luthor]] Strikes Back', with Lois Lane. However, it turned out it wasn't Jimmy at all, but Lex Luthor's henchman [[Otis (Superman)|Orville Gump]] in disguise.

=====''Superman'' (1988)=====
[[Mark L. Taylor]] played Jimmy Olsen in the 1988 [[animated]] adaptation of [[Superman (1988 TV series)|Superman]].

=====''Superman: The Animated Series''=====
[[Image:Jimmyolsen.gif|thumb|Jimmy Olsen in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]''.]]In ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', Jimmy was played by voice actor [[David Kaufman (actor)|David Kaufman]]. One episode was called "Superman's Pal" as an homage to the classic comic series, and Superman gave Jimmy the signal watch by the end of the episode. Another allusion to the comics made in the show was seen in the second season episode "Mxyzpixilated," where Mr. Mxyzptlk turns all the employees of the Daily Planet into animals. Jimmy is turned into a turtle, possibly as an homage.

=====''Justice League''=====
Jimmy makes a brief appearance in Superman's nightmare in "Only a Dream," with David Kaufman reprising the role. He also makes a cameo at Superman's funeral in "Hereafter." A photographer with orange hair also appears beside Clark at the beginning of "Starcrossed." Though his face isn't shown, it is likely Jimmy.

=====''Justice League Unlimited''=====
Jimmy had several [[cameo appearance]]s in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', including one episode where [[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]] tied him up, taped his mouth shut, and used the signal watch to attract Superman. In the episode "Chaos at the Earth's Core", several heroes battle a giant turtle that has a thatch of red hair. [[Bruce Timm]] has confirmed this is a reference to Jimmy's [[#Powers, abilities, and equipment|Giant Turtle Boy]] persona, "but it was more economical time-wise to have him revert to cute little turtle than naked, confused photographer."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jl.toonzone.net/episode53/episode53.htm|title="Chaos at the Earth's Core" at The Watchtower}} Retrieved on June 20, 2007.</ref>

=====''The Batman''=====
