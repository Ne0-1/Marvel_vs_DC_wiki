==Fictional character biography==
===Lord Shingen===
'''Lord Shingen''' was a [[Japan]]ese [[Yakuza]] crime boss who disgraced his family name, when he claimed he had a legitimate claim to the [[Emperor of Japan|Imperial Throne of Japan]], by turning his [[clan]] into a criminal empire.

To settle a [[consumer debt|personal debt]] incurred during his rise to power, Shingen forced his daughter [[Mariko Yashida]] to marry criminal boss Noboru Hideki.<ref name="Wolverine #1">''Wolverine'' vol. 1 #1</ref> [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] found out Noboru beat Mariko nearly to death and confronted Noboru but relented from killing Noboru upon Mariko's insistence, however, Shingen had Wolverine poisoned, temporarily greatly weakening Wolverine so that he could beat and humiliate the superhuman [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] in a duel with [[bokken]] in front of Mariko. Shingen used his expert knowledge of human anatomy to secretly attack Wolverine's nerve endings in such a way so as to make the duel life-threatening. But as Mariko did not know this when Wolverine attempted to use Wolverine's claws against Shingen to save Wolverine's own life, it appeared to Mariko that Wolverine was cheating in the duel. Mariko did not know that Wolverine's body had been saturated with enough lethal poison to kill several dozen ordinary men, or that Shingen was the one who was actually cheating in the duel. This had the effect of disgracing Wolverine in front of a [[Intimate relationship|lover]], which was the design of Shingen.<ref name="Wolv-2">''Wolverine'' vol. 1 #2</ref> Logan was then dumped onto the Tokyo streets and found by [[Yukio (comics)|Yukio]] (Shingen's best assassin) who participated in a deception with the [[The Hand (comics)|Hand]] ninja clan to manipulate Wolverine into an assassination of a rival crime lord, using Mariko as unwitting bait for additional motivation. After his role was completed, Shingen ordered Logan killed, but Yukio ignored the order which led to the Hand being sent to enforce his will. In the events resulting from that action, including the death of a personal friend by Yukio, Wolverine realized that Yukio was the one who poisoned Logan at Shingen's residence and was being played for a fool at apparently Shingen's orders.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 1 #3</ref> After a philosophic epiphany about humanity, Logan then completely destroyed the Yashida criminal empire to which Wolverine confronted Shingen a second time, Shingen did not survive Wolverine's confrontation and Mariko revealed of planning to kill her dishonorable father personally and commit [[seppuku]] in recompense had not Logan preempted Mariko. Afterwards, Mariko and Wolverine decided to marry with the [[X-Men]] receiving an invitation from the [[Emperor of Japan]] for the event.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 1 #4</ref> 

It's later revealed that his illegitimate son [[Kenuichio Harada]] wanted to inherit Shingen's position.<ref>''New Mutants'' #6</ref><ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' vol. 1 #172</ref> 

Shingen was briefly resurrected by Phaedra of the [[The Hand (comics)|Hand]] as part of a campaign of revenge against Wolverine.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #61</ref>

===Shin Harada===
'''Shingen''' "'''Shin'''" '''Harada''', otherwise known as the second '''[[Silver Samurai]]''', is Kenuichio Harada's son and named after Lord Shingen, his grandfather. He had been committing larceny with [[Amiko Kobayashi]].<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 4 #300. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Shin later worked with [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] to track down newly awakened mutants to join a cause. He was later recruited by Kade Killgore to be a teacher at the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]'s Hellfire Academy where he worked as a designer.<ref name="WatX-M #20">''Wolverine and the X-Men'' #20. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Wolverine and the X-Men'' #31. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Silver Samurai later appeared as a member of Mystique's fourth incarnation of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]].<ref>''All-New X-Men'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref> During [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]]'s fight with the Brotherhood of Mutants on [[Madripoor]], Magneto controlled Silver Samurai into wounding Mystique.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' Vol. 3 #16. Marvel Comics.</ref>

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'', Shingen Harada represented the Yashida Corporation when he attended a meeting at the Universal Bank with Tiberius Stone of [[Alchemax]], [[Kingpin (character)|Wilson Fisk]] of Fisk Industries, [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]] of Shaw Industries, [[Darren Cross]] of [[Cross Technological Enterprises]], [[Zeke Stane]] of Stane International, Frr'dox of Shi'ar Solutions Consolidated, and Wilhelmina Kensington of Kilgore Arms where they discussed with [[Minotaur (comics)|Dario Agger]] about [[Roxxon Energy Corporation]]'s plans to exploit the Ten Realms of Asgard. When the true motive of the meeting was revealed, Harada attacked Dario and they almost fought, interrupted by the arrival of Exterminatrix of the Midas Foundation, resulting in Dario getting knocked out when declaring herself a new member of their assembly.<ref>''Mighty Thor'' Vol. 5 #8. Marvel Comics.</ref> He then went to an underwater station in the Southern Ocean, where he attacked the employees until encountering [[Jane Foster (comics)|Thor]] who defeated him by smacking him repeatedly with [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]]. He then escaped and joined Exterminatrix in an aerial battle against soldiers attempting to rescue Dario. They later entered Roxxon Corporation HQ, where they encountered the B.E.R.S.E.R.K.E.R.S., a group of Hulk-like superhumans. While the Mindless Ones fought  the B.E.R.S.E.R.K.E.R.S., Silver Samurai and Exterminatrix went to Dario's vault, attempting to take the money until Agent Solomon arrived, forcing Exterminatrix to fight the woman while Silver Samurai opened the vault. When the vault was opened, Dario transformed into Minotaur and knocked out Silver Samurai. Then, the floating island the building was located on fell down due to the activation of the Agger Imperative. While [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] evacuated the building, Thor destroyed the island. The villains were later arrested and taken into custody.<ref>''Mighty Thor'' Vol. 5 #9–11. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Silver Samurai approached [[Old Man Logan]] wanting to ally in stopping the Hand's Regenix operation. He agreed in exchange that Mariko doesn't get killed and that Touku and Asami's child is taken care of. When Logan and Silver Samurai attack the Hand's Regenix operations, Silver Samurai fought [[Gorgon (Tomi Shishido)|Gorgon]] while Logan fought the Hand Ninjas to confront Mariko. After Gorgon got away, Silver Samurai injected nanites into Mariko to break the Hand's control. Afterwards, Logan and Mariko sent Silver Samurai to destroy the Regenix shipments in Madripoor.<ref>''Old Man Logan'' #33. Marvel Comics.</ref>
