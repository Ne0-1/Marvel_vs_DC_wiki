The '''Two-Gun Kid''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[cowboy]] [[gunslinger]] in the [[Wild West]] of [[Marvel Comics]]' [[shared universe]], the [[Marvel Universe]].  

==Publication history==
The original Two-Gun Kid, Clay Harder, was Marvel's first continuing western character,  appearing in ''Two-Gun Kid'' #1 (1948) and  continuing off and on until 1962, with [[Joe Sinnott]] being the last artist to draw the original Kid on a regular basis.  The second Two-Gun Kid, Matt Liebowicz (alias "Matt Hawk"â€”the Liebowicz name was eventually [[retcon]]ned in to replace the original "Hawk"), first appeared in ''Two-Gun Kid'' #60 (1962).  The latter Kid is better known today, thanks primarily to his connection with and later full integration into the [[Marvel Universe]], not to mention simply being more recent, but the earlier Kid enjoyed a prolific 14-year life span in comics.  ''Two-Gun Kid'' #60 [[retcon]]ned the Clay Harder character out of existence, turning him into a dime novel character (at a time when comics had just gone up in price from a dime to twelve  cents).  The two Kids wore different outfits: Clay Harder had bright blond hair and wore an all-black suit with a plackard shirt, a broad-brimmed black hat, and packed two long-barreled pistols with individual overlapping gun belts, while Matt Hawk wore a similar outfit only with an orange-and-black spotted vest, a slightly narrower-brimmed hat, two pistols on a single gun belt, and a black mask covering the top half of his face in the [[Zorro]] style.  At one point later in the second series, some of the original Kid's adventures were retouched to make him look like the newer Kid for reprints.  [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], creators of the [[Fantastic Four]], concocted the new Kid to make the character resemble a superhero with a secret identity in order to stimulate sales for the title.

==Fictional character biography==
The character's original name was "Matt Hawk" but this was later [[retcon]]ned into "Matt Liebowicz."  What follows is the current version of the character's biography: Matt Liebowicz was a [[lawyer]] from [[Boston, Massachusetts]] who was inspired to fight evil as a masked crimefighter of the 19th Century American West by the stories of the fictional "Two-Gun Kid", Clay Harder.  After being trained in combat by the gunfighter Ben Dancer, Liebowicz assumed the dual identities of "Matt Hawk" and the Two-Gun Kid.  With his horse Cyclone, his partner "Boom Boom" Brown, and a pair of pistols, he became one of the West's most prolific heroes, often teaming up with the [[Rawhide Kid]], [[Kid Colt]] or the [[Phantom Rider]].  In one of his first adventures he fought an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]], and in other early outings he fought criminals who could only be called [[supervillain]]s.  During one adventure, he was brought to the present day via [[time travel]] and joined the [[superhero]] team of [[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]].  He fought alongside them before leaving to wander America alongside his teammate [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], and eventually returned to his own time, occasionally making a cameo appearance in other Western tales or stories of time travel.

The ''[[Two-Gun Kid: Sunset Riders]]'' [[limited series]] revealed that the Kid had married, only for his wife to die in childbirth; this series also revealed that the Kid had brought a cache of modern weapons back with him from the future.  The later [[limited series]] ''[[Blaze of Glory (comics)|Blaze of Glory]]'' depicted the Kid as retired from gunplay, now going by the name of Clay Harder and working as a full-time lawyer.  The Rawhide Kid convinced him to return to action, but the Two-Gun Kid died in battle against the racist mercenary Nightriders, alongside his old partners Kid Colt and the [[Outlaw Kid]].

===The Return of the Two-Gun Kid===
In ''[[She-Hulk]]'' (vol. 2) #3, Jennifer Walters, after dealing with the [[Time Variance Authority]], is given the chance to free one time traveling Avenger out of continuity limbo. She chooses the Two-Gun Kid. It's clarified that his heroic nature prevents him from being returned to his own time, as he would inevitably try to fix things.

In present time, he learns his previous modern-day encounters with the Avengers has resulted in his law license and other paraphenellia being kept in an Avengers safety-deposit box. Once he learns She-Hulk works for a law-firm, [[Goodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg & Holliway]], he tries to become her colleague. He comes to the conclusion he will never be able to catch up on current laws and becomes a bounty hunter in issue #5. His first catch is [[Bushwacker (comics)|Bushwacker]].

For a time he rooms with the [[Awesome Android]], who had reformed and was also an employee for the same law firm. He uses a twin-engine jet cycle to fly around the city. This cycle is donated to him by [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], an old friend who was aware of his past time-traveling difficulties and the potential for even more.

===Civil War/The Initiative===
During the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] event, Matt Hawk became a licensed bounty hunter and works alongside She-Hulk, helping her to apprehend super-villains. For example, he takes down the rampaging villain [[Ruby Thursday]] with a stun-rifle.<ref>''She-Hulk'' #10</ref> He was later sent to [[Arizona]] to lead the [[Desert Stars]] team of the [[Fifty State Initiative]].<ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showpost.php?p=5572067&postcount=13 NEWSARAMA - View Single Post - Cup o' Joe May - 23<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He is injured when team member the Blacksmith is revealed to be a Skrull and attacks the team.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #16</ref> After that he recovers and with Komodo, Supermax, and Johnny Cool aids the Heavy Hitters to protect a dam from an attack of super-powered villain [[Zzzax]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiaive Special'' #1</ref>
