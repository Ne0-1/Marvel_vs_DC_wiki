The '''Two-Gun Kid''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[cowboy]] [[gunslinger]] in the [[Wild West]] of the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  

==Publication history==
The original Two-Gun Kid, Clay Harder, was Marvel's first continuing western character,  appearing in ''Two-Gun Kid'' #1 ([[1948]]) and  continuing off and on until 1962, with [[Joe Sinnott]] being the last artist to draw the original Kid on a regular basis.  The second Two-Gun Kid, Matt Liebowicz (alias "Matt Hawk"--the Liebowicz name was eventually [[retcon]]ned in to replace the original "Hawk"), first appeared in ''Two-Gun Kid'' #60 ([[1962]]).  The latter Kid is better known today, thanks primarily to his connection with and later full integration into the [[Marvel Universe]], not to mention simply being more recent, but the earlier Kid enjoyed a prolific 14-year life span in comics.  ''Two-Gun Kid'' #60 [[retcon]]ned the Clay Harder character out of existence, turning him into a dime novel character (at a time when comics had just gone up in price from a dime to twelve  cents).  The two Kids wore different outfits: Clay Harder had bright blond hair and wore an all-black suit with a plackard shirt, a broad-brimmed black hat, and packed two long-barreled pistols with individual overlapping gun belts, while Matt Hawk wore a similar outfit only with an orange-and-black spotted vest, a slightly narrower-brimmed hat, two pistols on a single gun belt, and a black mask covering the top half of his face in the [[Zorro]] style.  At one point later in the second series, some of the original Kid's adventures were retouched to make him look like the newer Kid for reprints!  [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], creators of the [[Fantastic Four]], concocted the new Kid to make the character resemble a superhero with a secret identity in order to stimulate sales for the title.

==Fictional character biography==
The character's original name was "Matt Hawk" but this was later [[retcon]]ned into "Matt Liebowicz."  What follows is the current version of the character's biography: Matt Liebowicz was a [[lawyer]] from [[Boston, Massachusetts]] who was inspired to fight evil as a masked crimefighter of the 19th Century American West by the stories of the fictional "Two-Gun Kid", Clay Harder.  After being trained in combat by the gunfighter Ben Dancer, Liebowicz assumed the dual identities of "Matt Hawk" and the Two-Gun Kid.  With his horse Cyclone, his partner "Boom Boom" Brown, and a pair of pistols, he became one of the West's most prolific heroes, often teaming up with the [[Rawhide Kid]], [[Kid Colt]] or the [[Phantom Rider]].  In one of his first adventures he fought an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]], and in other early outings he fought criminals who could only be called [[supervillain]]s.  During one adventure, he was brought to the present day via [[time travel]] and joined the [[superhero]] team of [[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]].  He fought alongside them before leaving to wander America alongside his teammate [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], and eventually returned to his own time, occasionally making a cameo appearance in other Western tales or stories of time travel.

The ''[[Two-Gun Kid: Sunset Riders]]'' [[limited series]] revealed that the Kid had married, only for his wife to die in childbirth; this series also revealed that the Kid had brought a cache of modern weapons back with him from the future.  The later [[limited series]] ''[[Blaze of Glory (comics)|Blaze of Glory]]'' depicted the Kid as retired from gunplay, now going by the name of Clay Harder and working as a full-time lawyer.  The Rawhide Kid convinced him to return to action, but the Two-Gun Kid died in battle against the racist mercenary Nightriders, alongside his old partners Kid Colt and the [[Outlaw Kid]].

===The Return of the Two-Gun Kid===
In ''[[She-Hulk]]'' (vol. 2) #3, Jennifer Walters was given the chance to free one time traveling Avenger out of continuity limbo after her time travel trial was over with.  She chose the Two-Gun Kid and in issue #5 of same, he assumes the parole officer/bounty hunter type role for Jennifer Walters/She-Hulk's law firm; [[Goodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg & Holliway]]. For a time he rooms with the [[Awesome Android]], who had reformed and was also an employee for the same law firm. He uses a twin-engine jet cycle to fly around the city.

===Civil War/The Initiative===
During the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] event, Matt Hawk became a licensed bounty hunter and worked alongside She-Hulk, helping her to apprehend super-villains.

Matt has been identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes who appear on the cover of the comic book [[Avengers: The Initiative]] #1. <ref>[http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 Avengers: The Initiative #1 Character Map]</ref>
