The '''Two-Gun Kid''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[cowboy]] [[gunslinger]] in the [[Wild West]] of the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  The original Two-Gun Kid, Clay Harder, appeared in ''Two-Gun Kid'' #1 ([[1948]]).  The second Two-Gun Kid, Matt Liebowicz (alias "Matt Hawk"), first appeared in ''Two-Gun Kid'' #60 ([[1962]]).  The latter Kid is better known today, thanks primarily to his connection with and later full integration into the [[Marvel Universe]].

''Two-Gun Kid'' #60 [[retcon]]ned the Clay Harder character out of existence.  Matt Liebowicz was a [[lawyer]] from [[Boston, Massachusetts]] who was inspired to fight evil by the stories of the fictional "Two-Gun Kid", Clay Harder.  After being trained in combat by the gunfighter Ben Dancer, Liebowicz assumed the dual identities of "Matt Hawk" and the Two-Gun Kid.  With his horse Cyclone, his partner "Boom Boom" Brown, and a pair of pistols, he became one of the West's most prolific heroes, often teaming up with the [[Rawhide Kid]], [[Kid Colt]] or the [[Phantom Rider]].  In one of his first adventures he fought an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]], and in other early outings he fought criminals who could only be called [[supervillain]]s.  During one adventure, he was brought to the present day via [[time travel]] and joined the [[superhero]] team of [[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]].  He fought alongside them before leaving to wander America alongside his teammate [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], and eventually returned to his own time, occasionally making a cameo appearance in other Western tales or stories of time travel.

The ''[[Two-Gun Kid: Sunset Riders]]'' [[limited series]] revealed that the Kid had married, only for his wife to die in childbirth; this series also revealed that the Kid had brought a cache of modern weapons back with him from the future.  The later [[limited series]] ''[[Blaze of Glory (comics)|Blaze of Glory]]'' depicted the Kid as retired from gunplay, now going by the name of Clay Harder and working as a full-time lawyer.  The Rawhide Kid convinced him to return to action, but the Two-Gun Kid died in battle against the racist mercernary Nightriders, alongside his old partners Kid Colt and the [[Outlaw Kid]].

==The Return of the Two-Gun Kid==
In ''[[She-Hulk]]'' (vol. 2) #3, Jennifer Walters was given the chance to free one time traveling Avenger out of continuity limbo after her time travel trial was over with.  She chose the Two-Gun Kid and in issue #5 of same, he assumed the parole officer/bounty hunter type role for Jennifer Walters/She-Hulk's law firm; [[Goodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg & Holliway]].  During the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] event, Matt Hawk became a licensed bounty hunter and worked alongside She-Hulk, helping her apprehending super-villains.
