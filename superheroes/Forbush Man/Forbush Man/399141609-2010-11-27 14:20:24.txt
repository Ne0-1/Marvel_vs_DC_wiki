'''Forbush Man''', (spelt '''Forbush-Man''' in his early appearances), was the [[mascot]] of [[Marvel Comics]]' ''[[Not Brand Echh]]'', a 1960s [[comic book]] that spoofed other comic books, including Marvel's own line of [[superhero]] titles. According to ''[[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Alternate Universes 2005]]'', Forbush Man is a native to Earth 665, as opposed to Marvel's regular [[Earth-616]].

==Fictional character biography==
Forbush-Man was a wannabe superhero (albeit one with no [[List of comic book superpowers|superpowers]]), with a costume comprising red [[Long underwear|long johns]] with the letter F on the front and a cooking pot with eye-holes on his head. Forbush-Man's appearance may be a tribute to the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] [[Red Tornado (Golden Age)|Red Tornado]] character.

===Not Brand Ecch===
Forbush-Man appeared on the cover of the first issue of ''Not Brand Echh'' (August 1967), which was drawn by [[Jack Kirby]] and features [[Doctor Doom]], the [[Fantastic Four]] and the [[Silver Surfer]] cowering in fear as Forbush Man approaches. However, Forbush-Man's first major appearance was in the lead story of ''Not Brand Echh'''s fifth issue (December 1967): "The Origin of Forbush-Man," which was "conceived, created and cluttered-up" by [[Stan Lee]] and Jack Kirby. In this story, Forbush-Man's secret identity is revealed as [[Irving Forbush]], the fictitious office [[gofer]] at Marvel Comics (here referred to as 'Marble Comics').<ref>Lee, Stan and Kirby, Jack. "The Origin of Forbush-Man," ''Not Brand Echh'' #5 (Marvel Comics, December 1967).</ref>

The character was supplied with a backstory, including a shrewish maiden aunt (Auntie Mayhem) who was indirectly responsible for her nephew becoming a superhero (in a fit of pique, she slams the fabled cooking pot over Irving's head, inadvertently providing him with the disguise he'd been looking for). Numerous in-jokes peppered throughout the dialogue suggested that Irving and his aunt were both Jewish (a schtick repeated in at least two subsequent storylines). 

Like his better known Marvel contemporaries, Forbush-Man went on to triumph over a number of super powered adversaries (starting with 'The [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernut]]' in ''Not Brand Echh'' number five). All of his victories were purely accidental; lacking superhuman powers, dumb luck necessarily played a major role in all of the character's adventures. 

Forbush-Man's next 'canon' appearance came in Not Brand Echh issue eight (June 1968), when he applies for membership with 'The Revengers' (The [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]), 'S.H.E.E.S.H' ([[SHIELD]]) and finally 'The Echhs-Men' ([[X-Men]]). After each attempt ends in disaster for the group concerned, Forbush is offered a position in '[[Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band]],' which he declines, believing it better to 'quit while I'm still behind'.  

Forbush-Man's third major appearance came in ''Not Brand Ecch'' #13 (May 1969, coincidentally the comic's final issue), where he fights 'The Strangie' in a loose parody of ''[[Silver Surfer]]'' number five (April 1969). The story, once again rife with Jewish references, featured caricatures of various Marvel characters (including [[Spider-Man|Spidey-Man]], [[Thing (comics)|The Thung]], [[Human Torch|The Human Scorch]] and The Simple Surfer). Stan Lee himself put in an appearance as Marble Comics' 'Fearless Leader' in the final two panels.

===What The--?!===
During the 1980s Forbush Man became a staple cast member in the satirical Marvel Comics title ''[[What The--?!]]'' an ensemble book that encompassed and poked fun at the entirety of the canon Marvel Universe and beyond.

In 1993, What The?! published a story chronicling the death of Forbush Man. The story was a parody of the "Death of Superman" mini-series, and featured Forbush Man dying in battle against the villain, Dumsday.

===Nextwave===
Forbush Man appeared in ''[[Nextwave|Nextwave: Agents of H.A.T.E.]]'' as a member of 'The New Paramounts', a team consisting of ''Not Brand Echh'' characters including The Inedible Bulk.  This Forbush Man was apparently killed by [[Tabitha Smith]] after he failed to mind control her (she apparently had no mind). Nextwave and the [[Beyond CorporationÂ©]] exist within the mainstream [[Marvel Universe]].

==Powers==
While the original Forbush Man had no superpowers, the Forbush Man who appeared in ''Nextwave'' (who may or may not have been a [[Broccoli Men|Broccoli Man]]) had the power to project utterly realistic visions into the minds of others when he removed the cast-iron pot on his head. The hallucinations typically depicted a reality that was hellish to each victim, slowly killing them as they struggled against it. This power had no effect on [[Tabitha Smith]] as, in ''Nextwave'', she has no apparent mind at all. It is also possible that he has powers far beyond this: he cites during his recruitment to the New Paramounts several occasions on which he claims to have saved the Earth from certain doom so quickly and efficiently that nobody realized he'd done anything. He also purports to be "mighty with women," though whether this is one of his many powers is debatable.  Forbush Man even goes so far as to purport that he is "the greatest power in human history", although the veracity of these claims is unverified, and Tabitha Smith defeated him with apparently very little effort.

==Other versions==
===Lobo the Duck===
During the DC/Marvel [[Amalgam Universe]] [[intercompany crossover|crossover]], Irving Forbush was fused with DC's AL to form Al Forbush, proprietor of Lobo the Duck's favorite diner in the series' parody installment. He wears Forbush Man's trademark cooking pot with eye holes on his head.
