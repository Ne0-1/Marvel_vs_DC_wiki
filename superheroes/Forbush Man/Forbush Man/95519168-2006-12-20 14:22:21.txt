[[Image:Forbush_man.jpg|right|thumb|Panel from ''The Origin of Forbush Man'']]'''Forbush Man''' was the [[mascot]] of [[Marvel Comics]]' ''[[Not Brand Echh]]'', a 1960's [[comic book]] that spoofed other comic books, including Marvel's own line of [[superhero]] titles. 

Forbush Man was a [[wannabe]] superhero (albeit one with no [[List of comic book superpowers|superpowers]]), with a costume comprising red [[long johns]] with the letter F on the front and a cooking pot with eye-holes on his head. Forbush Man's appearance may be a tribute to the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] [[Red Tornado (Golden Age)|Red Tornado]] character.

Forbush Man appeared on the cover of the first issue of ''Not Brand Echh'', which was drawn by [[Jack Kirby]] and features [[Doctor Doom]], the [[Fantastic Four]] and the [[Silver Surfer]] cowering in fear as Forbush Man approaches. However, Forbush Man's first major appearance was in the lead story of ''Not Brand Echh'''s fifth issue: ''The Origin of Forbush Man'', which was "conceived, created and cluttered-up" by [[Stan Lee]] and Jack Kirby. In this story, Forbush Man's secret identity is revealed as Irving Forbush, the fictitious office [[gofer]] at Marvel Comics.

The name "Irving Forbush" was made up by Stan Lee as far back as [[1956]] to refer to an imaginary low-grade colleague who became the butt of many of Lee's jokes. The name cropped up repeatedly in the credit panels, [[Bullpen Bulletins]] and letters sections of Marvel comics during the 1960s. It soon became an in-joke between Lee and his readers.

*During the 1980s Forbush Man became a staple cast member in the satirical Marvel Comics title "What The..?!" an ensemble book that encompassed and poked fun at the entirety of the canon Marvel Universe.

*Forbush Man recently appeared in ''[[Nextwave|Nextwave: Agents of H.A.T.E.]]'' as a member of 'The New Paramounts', a team consisting of ''Not Brand Echh'' characters including The Inedible Bulk.

*Forbush man is a Bystander Token in the Supernova series of the game Heroclix. The token has no attack power, but high defense value.

While the original Forbush Man had no superpowers, the Forbush Man who appeared in ''Nextwave'' (who may or may not have been a Broccolli Man) had the power to project utterly realistic visions into the minds of others when he removed the cast-iron pot on his head. The hallucinations typically depicted a reality that was hellish to each victim, slowly killing them as they struggled against them. This power had no effect on [[Tabitha Smith]] as, in ''Nextwave'', she has no apparent mind at all.
