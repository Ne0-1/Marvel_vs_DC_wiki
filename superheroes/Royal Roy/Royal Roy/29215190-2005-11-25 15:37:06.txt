'''''Royal Roy:  A Prince of a Boy''''' was a [[comic book]] series from the [[Marvel Comics]] younger readers' imprint [[Star Comics]].  Begun in [[1985]], it was an answer to the successful [[Harvey Comics]] [[Richie Rich]] series.  Its namesake character was the young Prince Roy.  Like Richie, Roy had a sweet-natured middle-class girlfriend and a wealthy, abrasive acquaintance, Lorna Loot, who vied for his affections.
