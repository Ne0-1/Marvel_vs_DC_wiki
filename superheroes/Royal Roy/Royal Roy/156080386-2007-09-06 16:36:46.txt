'''''Royal Roy: A Prince of a Boy''''' was a short-lived [[comic book]] title from the [[Marvel Comics]] younger readers' imprint [[Star Comics]]; it lasted six issues.

==Publication history==
''Royal Roy: A Prince of a Boy'' began in [[April]], [[1985]], as an answer to the successful [[Harvey Comics]] [[Richie Rich]] series.  Its title character was the young Prince Roy of Cashelot, a fictional [[kingdom]] whose name was a [[blend]] of "[[cash]]" and "[[Camelot]]."  Like Richie, Roy was surrounded by wealth and luxury, but wasn't spoiled by it; in many ways, he was just like any other young boy. Also like Richie, Roy had a sweet-natured middle-class girlfriend (Crystal Cleer) and a wealthy, abrasive acquaintance (Lorna Loot) who vied for his affections.

The bimonthly series ended in [[March]], [[1986]].
