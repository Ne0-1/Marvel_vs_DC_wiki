'''''Royal Roy: A Prince of a Boy''''' was a short-lived [[bimonthly]] [[comic book]] title from the [[Marvel Comics]] younger readers' imprint [[Star Comics]], created by [[Lennie Herman]] and [[Warren Kremer]].

==Publication history==
''Royal Roy'' began in April 1985 as an answer to the successful [[Harvey Comics]] ''[[Richie Rich (comics)|Richie Rich]]'' series.  Its title character was the young Prince Roy of Cashelot, a fictional [[monarchy|kingdom]] whose name was a [[blend]] of "[[cash]]" and "[[Camelot]]."  Like Richie, Roy was surrounded by wealth and luxury, but wasn't spoiled by it; in many ways, he was just like any other young boy. Also like Richie, Roy had a sweet-natured middle-class girlfriend ('''Crystal Cleer''', a parody of [[Gloria Glad]]) and a wealthy, abrasive acquaintance ('''Lorna Loot''', a parody of [[Mayda Munny]]) who vied for his affections.

===Controversy===
In late 1985 Harvey Comics sued Star Comics for copyright infringement, claiming that Royal Roy was a blatant copy of Richie Rich.<ref>"Harvey Sues Marvel Star Comics, Charges Copyright Infringement," ''The Comics Journal'' #105 (Feb. 1986), pp. p. 23-24.</ref> (Longtime Harvey creator Lennie Herman had created ''Royal Roy'' for Star Comics; Herman died in 1983<ref>"Harvey Veteran Lenny Herman Dies," ''The Comics Journal'' #87 (December 1983), p. 21.</ref> before the first issue of ''Royal Roy'' was published.) 

''Royal Roy'' was cancelled after six issues in March 1986, and Harvey's lawsuit was dropped.

===[[X-Babies]]===
An updated version of Royal Roy (along with [[Planet Terry]], [[Top Dog (comics)|Top Dog]] and [[Wally the Wizard]]) is featured in the four-issue ''[[X-Babies]]'' miniseries published by [[Marvel Comics]] in late 2009.
