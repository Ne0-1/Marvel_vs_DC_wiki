'''Clayface''' is a name used by several [[DC Comics]] [[fictional character]]s, most of them possessing [[clay]]-like bodies and [[shapeshifting]] abilities. All of them have been [[supervillain|enemies]] of [[Batman]]. Created by [[Bob Kane]], the original Clayface, '''Basil Karlo''', was a [[B movie]] actor who began a life of crime using the identity of a villain he portrayed in a [[horror film]].<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation  | last = Wallace | first = Dan | author-link = | contribution = Clayface I-IV | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 85  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = New York  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>

In the late 1950s, Batman began facing a series of [[science fiction]]-inspired foes and '''Matt Hagen''', a treasure hunter given vast shapeshifting powers and resiliency by [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] [[protoplasm]], became the new Clayface. He retained the title for the next several decades of [[comic book]] history. In the late '70s, '''Preston Payne''' became the third Clayface. A scientist suffering from [[hyperpituitarism]], Payne used Hagen's blood to create a cure but became a clay-like creature that needed to pass his condition onto others to survive. His condition was used as a [[metaphor]] for [[drug abuse]] and [[sexually transmitted disease]].

'''Sondra Fuller,''' of Strike Force Kobra, used the [[terrorism|terrorist]] group’s technology to become the fourth Clayface, also known as '''Lady Clay'''. She formed the Mud Pack with Karlo, Payne, and a reanimated Hagen, which during that time, Payne and Fuller had a son '''Cassius "Clay" Payne''' who also had [[metahuman]] clay powers. During this era, Karlo used the [[DNA]] of Payne and Fuller to become the most powerful Clayface, often considered the current and ultimate incarnation of the villain. 

Clayface has appeared in three [[animation|animated]] adaptations of Batman, starting with the late 1970s-era ''[[The New Adventures of Batman]],'' which featured a comedic version of Hagen. The 1990s-era ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' featured a past-his-prime actor [[disfigurement|disfigured]] in a car accident who uses an experimental, addictive cosmetic to regain his appearance only to became a monstrous hunk of clay after a massive overdose of the substance. This interpretation, like the series’ [[Mr. Freeze]], was applauded as a deeper, more sympathetic version of a sci-fi-era villain, and the comic book incarnation of the Basil Karlo Clayface was retooled after it. The 2000s-era ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' featured a new character '''[[Ethan Bennett]]''', who had ties to a young Bruce Wayne, as Clayface before introducing a version of Basil Karlo. 

In 2009, Clayface was ranked as [[IGN]]'s 73rd Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.

==Fictional character biography==
===Basil Karlo===
[[Image:Clayface2.jpg|200px|left|thumb|The Basil Karlo Clayface. Art by Glen Orbik and Laurel Blechman.]]
The original Clayface, '''Basil Karlo''', appeared in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #40. He is an [[actor]] who is driven mad when he hears of a remake of the classic [[horror film]] he had starred in, ''The Terror'', even though he is to be one of the advising staff. Donning the mask of the film's villain, Clayface, he embarks on a murder spree among the cast and crew of the remake. He is foiled by [[Batman]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]. He reappears in ''Detective Comics'' #49 (March 1941) after the prison ambulance he is riding in plunges off a cliff. He once again dons the mask of Clayface and targets Bruce Wayne's fiancée, [[Julie Madison]]. Once again, the Dynamic Duo foil the evil Karlo.<ref name="dc-ency"/> A movie buff, Batman creator [[Bob Kane]] states that the character was partially inspired by the [[Lon Chaney, Sr.]] version of ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' and that the name of the character comes from [[Boris Karloff]].<ref> Bob Kane, ''Batman and Me'' (Foestfille, CA: Eclipse Books 1989), pg 111.</ref> 

Much later, Karlo languishes in a prison hospital, when Sondra Fuller visits him out of curiosity. Karlo proposes an alliance between all living Clayfaces to kill Batman. Even though the ''Mud Pack'', as the group called itself, is defeated, Karlo imbues himself with abilities similar to those of Preston Payne and Sondra Fuller. He is defeated by the combined efforts of Batman and [[Looker (comics)|Looker]] of the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]] by overloading his abilities, making him melt into the ground. He literally sinks into the earth's crust when he loses control of his power; he survives, however, and now his body sports crystals similar to [[quartz]] that endow him with greater powers. Karlo escapes his underground prison when [[Gotham City]] is struck by the great [[Batman: Cataclysm|Cataclysm]].  He captures Batman and is about to kill him, but he gets into a feud with [[Mr. Freeze]] on who has a right to kill the Caped Crusader.  With that distraction, Batman soundly defeats both of them.

During the "''[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]''" storyline, Basil Karlo holds [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], who is in charge of producing fresh vegetables for the remaining people in the city, prisoner in Robinson Park. Poison Ivy eventually battles and defeats Karlo, sinking him deep into the ground. It appears that the Ultimate Clayface is destroyed in this battle, but has resurfaced as a member of the [[Villains United|Secret Society of Super Villains]]. Later, he seeks to increase his already formidable powers by absorbing [[Wonder Woman]] (a clay construct similar to him), giving him an amount of powers that bordered on invulnerability. While he is successful in absorbing the heroine, he is ultimately forced to release her.

Basil Karlo is among the members of the [[Injustice League]] and is among the villains seen in ''[[Salvation Run]]''. He can be seen as the member of [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra's]] Secret Society of Super Villains.  In the second issue of ''[[Final Crisis]]'', he triggers an explosion at the ''[[Daily Planet]]''.

===Matt Hagen===<!-- This section is linked from [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]] -->
[[Image:Dc298.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Cover to ''Detective Comics'' #298. Matt Hagen as Clayface.]]
The second Clayface, '''Matt Hagen''', first appeared in ''Detective Comics'' #298. A treasure hunter, Hagen finds a mysterious [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] pool of [[protoplasm]] in a cave. Immersing himself in it, he is transformed into a malleable [[clay]]-like form which could be shaped into almost anything he desires. This is only a temporary effect, however, requiring him to return to the pool periodically in order to maintain use of his powers.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

He eventually copies the pool's protoplasmic jelly by chemistry studies, although the artificial proptoplasm only allows him five hours of Clayface powers compared to the full two days of the pool's. 

Hagen is ultimately killed by a shadow demon during the 12-issue [[limited series]] ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''.

During the "''Mud Pack''" storyline, the other villains who use the name Clayface gather Hagen's remains and make him a post-mortem member of their gang.

===Preston Payne===<!-- This section is linked from [[List of DC Comics characters: C]] -->
The third Clayface, '''Preston Payne''' first appeared at the end of ''Detective Comics'' #477 before making his first full appearance in #478. Suffering from [[hyperpituitarism]], Payne works at [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] searching for a cure. He obtains a sample of the then-living Matt Hagen's blood, and isolates an [[enzyme]] which he introduces into his own bloodstream. Although he is briefly able to shape his own appearance, this effect is short-lived: while on a date, his [[flesh]] begins to melt, and when he touches his horrified girlfriend, she completely melts. Payne builds an [[exoskeleton]] anti-melting suit to prevent himself from touching anyone, but he learns that he needs to spread his melting contagion onto others to survive (he feels pain if he doesn't melt anyone). During this time his mental health starts to slip as he falls in love with a wax mannequin he names "Helena", thinking she is the only woman immune to his touch. After another breakdown, he thinks Helena enjoys watching men "fighting over her" when he battles Batman yet again in front of the wax doll. Although he doesn't give her up, he keeps her in [[Arkham Asylum]], saying "we're both too polite to admit [[divorce]], but she can't live forever."<ref name="dc-ency"/>

During the events of the ''Mud Pack'', Sondra Fuller, the fourth Clayface, begins masquerading as the hero Looker and visits Payne at Arkham. That same night, he gets into an argument with Helena and unintentionally knocks her head off. Believing he has killed her, Payne goes on a rampage until subdued in a nearby swamp by the asylum guards. Fuller, who is still using Looker's appearance and powers, rescues him and influences him to follow Basil Karlo's commands. Karlo ultimately betrays Fuller, and takes samples of her and Payne's blood to inject into himself. He finally breaks free of Fuller's control, and is about to kill her when she admits how sorry she is for using him. The two fall in love and go on to live together, leading to Fuller becoming [[pregnant]] with their child, Cassius.

Preston acquires medicine to control his pain and now feels the "hunger" only in his mind. It is also revealed that he was [[child abuse|abused]] by his parents.

A stunted, emaciated Preston Payne appears in the graphic novel ''[[Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth|Arkham Asylum]]'' by [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Dave McKean]]. He is used to metaphorically represent [[sexually transmitted disease]]s.

Payne next appears in the ''[[Justice League: Cry for Justice]]'' miniseries, having been coerced into working for [[Prometheus (comics)|Prometheus]], who had threatened the life of his son. Prometheus had further mutated Payne, giving him back his old shapeshifting abilities, and had him act as a decoy for the [[Justice League]]. When the ruse was discovered, an explosive device planted inside Payne's body detonated, presumably killing him.<ref>''Justice League: Cry for Justice'' #3</ref>

===Sondra Fuller===<!-- This section is linked from [[List of DC Comics characters: C]] -->
The fourth Clayface, '''Sondra Fuller''', also known as Lady Clay, first appeared in ''[[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]'' (volume 1) #21. She is a member of Strikeforce Kobra who is transformed into a shape-changer by her employer [[Kobra (comics)|Kobra]]'s technologies, a process to which she agrees to become a subject because she hates her own face. 

She possesses identical abilities to those of Matt Hagen, but they are permanent, without the requirement for a source of protoplasm. She can additionally copy any special powers of the being she is mimicking. She is defeated by the Outsiders.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Later, after the Mud Pack forms and battles Batman, Fuller falls in love with Preston Payne and they have a child named Cassius "Clay" Payne. After [[Abattoir (comics)|Abbatoir]] kidnaps the child, the couple get into a fight involving [[Azrael (comics)|Azrael/Batman]].

===Mud Pack===
Before the appearance of the fifth and sixth Clayfaces, the third and fourth Clayfaces team up, breaking the original Clayface out of prison and futilely attempting to revive the second. Together, the four form the "Mud Pack". Karlo later copies the others' powers by injecting himself with extracts of samples of the other two Clayfaces, becoming the "Ultimate Clayface". The three battle, and are defeated by Batman. (Detective Comics #604-607)

===Cassius "Clay" Payne===
[[File:Clayface.jpg|right|thumb|Cassius "Clay" Payne as the fifth Clayface]]
After the Mud Pack, Payne and Fuller fall in love and eventually have a child together named '''Cassius "Clay" Payne''', who became the fifth Clayface who debuted in ''Batman #550''. The boy is separated from his parents and held in a government laboratory. The full extent of his powers are unknown. The name "Cassius" is a pun on "Cassius Clay", the birthname of legendary boxer [[Muhammad Ali]].

If a piece of him is separated from his body, it can grow a mind of its own, but it mostly thinks in an unstable form of what Cassius wants. If bonded with another human, becoming a Claything, the piece can give that human Clayface-like abilities, such as becoming soft and malleable, being able to withstand bullets and other harm, and could also manifest Payne's ability to melt objects; all this person would have to do is just think it.

In an issue of ''[[Batman: Gotham Knights]]'', Cassius was depicted as having the clay-like appearance of his mother and father, but can only stay in Clayface mode while awake.

Cassius was featured in ''[[Final Crisis]] Aftermath: Run'' #3.

===Claything===<!-- This section is linked from [[List of DC Comics characters: C]] -->
The sixth Clayface, also known as '''Claything''' also debuted in ''Batman #550''. Claything was created when a skin sample from Cassius Payne comes to life and merges with a DEO ([[Department of Extranormal Operations]]) scientist, Dr. Peter Malley. He has the ability to melt objects simply by looking at them. Claything is destroyed and his remains are stored at the DEO Headquarters.

===Johnny Williams===
[[Image:Gothamknights69.jpg|180px|thumb|right|{{Descript-cvr-art|[[Batman: Gotham Knights]]||69|Nov, 2005}}Art by [[Claudio Castellini]].]]
The seventh Clayface debuted in ''Batman'' #614 (June 2003), but was not formally introduced until ''Batman: Gotham Knights'' #60 (February 2005). '''Johnny Williams''' is introduced as a former firefighter in Gotham who is transformed into a clay-based creature by an explosion in a chemical plant. He first discovers his transformation after he accidentally kills a [[prostitute]]; horrified and stricken with guilt, he plans to commit [[suicide]]. Just then, he is approached by [[Hush (comics)|Hush]] and the [[Riddler]], who tell him that the chemicals turned him into the latest Clayface. They begin to manipulate Williams, holding out the promise of a cure and making him do his bidding, including pretending to be Tommy Elliot (Hush's true identity) and an adult [[Jason Todd]], to hurt and confuse Bruce Wayne. Eventually, Williams realizes he is being manipulated. Knowing that he is going to die, he offers Batman assistance against Hush in exchange for protecting his family. He redeems himself in his death, also ensuring that [[Alfred Pennyworth]] is cleared of murder.

==Other versions==
===Earth-9===
The [[Earth-9]] version of Clayface is featured in [[Tangent Comics]]' ''Superman's Reign'' series. This version is a shapeshifter like the mainstream versions, but his base form is that of a hulking, misshapened human with melted skin.<ref>''Tangent: Superman's Reign'' #10</ref>

===All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder===
The Basil Karlo version of Clayface will make his appearance in the ''[[All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder]]'' series.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Clayface's first appearance outside the comics was in the late 1970s, in four episodes of [[Filmation]]'s ''[[The New Adventures of Batman]]'', where he was voiced first by [[Lou Scheimer]] and later by [[Lennie Weinrib]]. This was the Matt Hagen version of Clayface, and he must drink his special potion daily to keep his Clayface powers. In this show, he often took on the forms of animals. 

[[Image:Clayface-Batman.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Clayface as he appears in ''Batman: The Animated Series''.]]
* ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', featured a version of the character (voiced by [[Ron Perlman]] in the English version, and by [[Masashi Ebara]] in the Japanese dub) that combined aspects of several of the comic-book Clayfaces. In the episode "[[wikia:DCAnimated:Feat of Clay|Feat of Clay]]" (written by veteran comic book writer [[Marv Wolfman]]), he is introduced as Matt Hagen, a past-his-prime actor [[disfigurement|disfigured]] in a horrible car accident. While recovering in a burn clinic, he is approached by corrupt businessman [[Roland Daggett]], who makes him a test subject for a compound called "RenuYou" that he promises will immediately restore his youthful good looks compared to years of [[plastic surgery]]. In exchange, Hagen must disguise himself to commit crimes for Daggett. He greatly resents this, but is forced to comply as the RenuYou chemical is extremely addictive. Hagen attempts to steal a large quantity of RenuYou from Daggett's compound, but is caught, and Daggett's men try to kill Hagen by pouring an entire canister of the compound down his throat. Rather than kill him, the [[drug overdose|overdose]] saturates every [[cell (biology)|cell]] in his body, turning him into a bulky and misshapen clay like form. For short periods of time, he can shapeshift into anything or anybody he wishes. After trying to get [[revenge]] on Daggett, he is stopped by Batman. When caught, Clayface fakes his death.

Clayface reappears in "Mudslide", which reveals that he has been in hiding since "Feat of Clay" and that his body is beginning to deteriorate. He is restored to a semblance of health by a former medical adviser on his films, Dr. Stella Bates, who falls in love with Hagen. Batman tracks Hagen down and prevents Dr. Bates' treatment of Clayface. Clayface and Batman then fight on a cliff during a rainstorm above an ocean. They both fall, and hang onto the cliff. Batman attempts to save Clayface, but his body absorbs too much rain to hold itself and he falls into the ocean, where he dissolves.

[[Image:Clayface3.jpg||thumb|right|225px|Clayface as he appears in ''The New Batman Adventures'']]
* In ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', Clayface also makes a brief appearance in the pilot episode, "[[wikia:DCAnimated:Holiday Knights|Holiday Knights]]" where he separates himself into various little boys to steal items during a [[Christmas Eve]] rush. Revealing himself, he attacks Detectives [[Harvey Bullock (comics)|Harvey Bullock]] and [[Renee Montoya]], but is defeated by [[Batgirl]] (who was shopping there as [[Barbara Gordon]] at the time).  Despite this is the first episode of ''The New Batman Adventures'', it was set after the event of "Growing Pains."  Clayface returns in the episode, "Growing Pains" with Ron Perlman reprising Clayface. Barely alive after dissolving after his last battle with Batman on "Mudslide", Clayface (or his remains) drift near a pipe leaking strange chemicals into the ocean, which combine with Clayface's remains to restore his strength. Still weakened, Clayface sends a portion of himself, which takes the form of a little [[amnesia]]c girl (voiced by [[Francesca Smith|Francesca Marie Smith]]), to see if the city is still safe for him to resurface.  The girl unexpectedly develops an individual personality and left him.   Robin found and develops affections for the girl and names her "Annie."  During this period, Clayface poses as the girl's [[child abuse|abusive]] father, committing various robberies in order to make a living in the sewers of Gotham along finding her. Eventually, Clayface recovers, cornering Robin and Annie who allows herself to be reabsorbed (effectively killing her), to save Robin. Enraged by Annie's "death," Robin almost kills Clayface with gallons of [[solvent]], but Batman intervenes and stops him and the villain is arrested and imprisoned in [[Arkham Asylum]].  Robin told Batman and the police to add murder to his list of crimes. It is left ambiguous as to whether this charge would stand since technically Annie is a part of Clayface himself. 
* Ron Perlman once again voices Clayface in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' series. It is revealed that he had been captured, separated, and sealed into several [[biological hazard|biohazard]] canisters by [[Morgan Edge]]. [[Gorilla Grodd]] and his newly-formed Secret Society attack Edge's mansion, freeing Clayface and offering him membership. Clayface is reluctant at first, but Grodd promises to find a way to revert Clayface back to his human form, yet allow him to keep his powers, but the Society is defeated, included Clayface as well, after Flash and Hawgirl stuff him with fireworks and set them off.  This is Clayface's final episode in DC Animated Universe.

* Clayface made an appearance in the 12th episode of the short-lived ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]'' television series portrayed by [[Kirk Baltz]]. This version of Clayface is a sculptor who is [[schadenfreude|inspired by other people's pain]]. Like other versions, he is a shapeshifter, but his powers are explained to come from taking a special formula specifically tailored by a crooked scientist to work with his [[DNA]]. In this series, he is hired by the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] to kill [[Catwoman]]. He has a son named '''Chris Cassius''' (a pun on [[Muhammad Ali]], whose birth name was Cassius Clay) who turns people into clay after stealing and taking his father's formula, making his powers similar to the Preston Payne Clayface and his own son, "Clay" Payne.

[[Image:Clayface of Tragedy.jpg|right|thumb|Clayface, as he appears in ''The Batman'']]
* There are two versions of Clayface in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]''
:The first Clayface is [[Ethan Bennett]], a detective in the [[Gotham City Police Department]] and Bruce Wayne's best friend. This version of Clayface is voiced by [[Steve Harris (actor)|Steve Harris]]. Clayface originates in the two-part episodes "The Rubber Face of Comedy/Clayface of Tragedy". After he inhales a dose of the Joker's Joker Putty (following a session of extensive [[brainwashing]], driving him insane), Bennett is rescued by Batman and his partner, Detective [[Ellen Yin]]. He is suspended by Chief Rojas after publicly denouncing the chief's claims about Batman. At his apartment, Bennett mutates into a featureless gray clay-like figure, and tries to look for help, scaring away the locals, though he manages to change back into his original form with practice. After many battles with Batman, it has become clear that he still holds a grudge against the Joker. At one point he even impersonates [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]] in order to loot the city on [[Halloween]], but is ultimately stopped by Batman. As Clayface returns in the fourth season episode "Clayfaces", Bennett seems to have finally reformed. He tracks down and captures the Joker, disguising himself as the Joker's henchmen, Punch and Judy. He hands him over to the police without using excessive force, and turns himself in to the authorities, who take him to Arkham Asylum. However, Bennett has not completely regained Bruce Wayne's (and Batman's) trust. He is eager to leave Arkham and continue working as a police officer, although Batman refuses to consider this request until Bennett is cured, citing he could easily go back to crime. When Basil Karlo begins wreaking havoc as the second Clayface, Bennett feels he is the only one who could defeat him. Bennett once again requests a second chance, but after he is refused again, he resorts to escaping from Arkham. Bennett tracks down and battles Karlo with the aid of Batman and Robin. Bennett holds Karlo down while Batman administers the antidote. Bennett is shown at the end to be fully cured, while Karlo retains his powers.

[[Image:KarloClayface.jpg|right|thumb|Basil Karlo as the second Clayface in ''The Batman'']]
:The fourth season episode "Clayfaces" introduces Basil Karlo (in his first actual appearance outside the comics) as the series' second Clayface voiced by [[Wallace Langham]] and later by [[Lex Lang]]. Here, he is shown to be an ugly, untalented actor. He is seen repeatedly turned down in auditions for a dog food commercial when he hears that Bennett is about to be cured. Karlo breaks into Wayne Industries and drinks a refined, purified sample of the Clayface [[mutagen]] Bennett was exposed to. This successfully turns him into Clayface. After being rejected once again for a dog food commercial, he snaps and uses his Clayface powers to attack the city. At first he believes this incident would be the death of his career, but he then sees that being a [[supervillain]] has made him a celebrity, covered on nearly every channel. At the last channel he stops on, it shows his previous movie, ''The Revenge of The Atomic Clone''. After a battle with Batman, Robin, and Ethan Bennett, Basil Karlo is injected with the Clayface antidote, seemingly restoring him to normal. However, the episode's final scene shows that Karlo has retained his powers. He reappears in "The Batman/Superman Story, Part One" where he, along with [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] and [[Mr. Freeze]], is in the employ of [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]], who has teamed up with [[Lex Luthor]] and kidnapped [[Lois Lane]] as bait for a trap to lure in [[Superman]].

===Video games===
Clayface is the second boss of [[Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu]].

Clayface/Basil Karlo appears in ''[[Lego Batman: The Videogame]]'' with his vocal effects provided by [[Ogie Banks]]. His structure and look is that of the Matt Hagen Clayface from ''Batman: The Animated Series'' <ref> ''Game Informer'' features a two-page gallery of the many heroes and villains who appear in the game with a picture for each character and a descriptive paragraph.  See "''LEGO Batman'': Character Gallery," ''Game Informer'' 186 (October 2008): 93.</ref> His actions and mannerisms suggests a low level of intelligence; "Iconic characters, such as Clayface and Robin, have been turned into village idiots," writes Ben of ''[[Game Informer]]''.<ref>Ben, "''LEGO Batman'': Time to build something new," ''Game Informer'' 187 (November 2008): 116.</ref>

Clayface/Basil Karlo can be seen in the game ''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]]'', changing into various other game characters, while asking to be let out of his cell. His biography states it is Basil Karlo, although the presence of a mannequin in the cell hints at Preston Payne's relationship with 'Helena'.
