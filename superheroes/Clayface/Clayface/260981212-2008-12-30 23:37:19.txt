'''Clayface''' is a name used by several [[DC Comics]] [[fictional character]]s, most of them possessing [[clay]]-like bodies and [[shapeshifting]] abilities. All of them have been [[supervillain|enemies]] of [[Batman]]. Created by [[Bob Kane]], the original Clayface, '''Basil Karlo''', was a [[B movie]] actor who began a life of crime using the identity of a villain he portrayed in a [[horror film]].<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation  | last = Wallace | first = Dan | author-link = | contribution = Clayface I-IV | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 85  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = New York  | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>

In the late 1950s, Batman began facing a series of [[science fiction]]-inspired foes and '''Matt Hagen''', a treasure hunter given vast shapeshifting powers and resiliency by [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] [[protoplasm]], became the new Clayface. He retained the title for the next several decades of [[comic book]] history. In the late '70s, '''Preston Payne''' became the third Clayface. A scientist suffering from [[hyperpituitarism]], Payne used Hagen's blood to create a cure but became a clay-like creature that needed to pass his condition onto others to survive. His condition was used as a [[metaphor]] for [[drug abuse]] and [[sexually transmitted disease]].

'''Sondra Fuller,''' of Strike Force Kobra, used the [[terrorism|terrorist]] group’s technology to become the fourth Clayface, also known as '''Lady Clay'''. She formed the Mud Pack with Karlo, Payne, and a reanimated Hagen, which during that time, Payne and Fuller had a son '''Cassius "Clay" Payne''' who also had [[metahuman]] clay powers. During this era, Karlo used the [[DNA]] of Payne and Fuller to become the most powerful Clayface, often considered the current and ultimate incarnation of the villain. 

Clayface has appeared in three [[animation|animated]] adaptations of Batman, starting with the late 1970s-era ''[[The New Adventures of Batman]],'' which featured a comedic version of Hagen. The 1990s-era ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' featured a past-his-prime actor [[disfigurement|disfigured]] in a car accident who uses an experimental, addictive cosmetic to regain his appearance only to became a monstrous hunk of clay after a massive overdose of the substance. This interpretation, like the series’ [[Mr. Freeze]], was applauded as a deeper, more sympathetic version of a sci-fi-era villain, and the comic book incarnation of the Basil Karlo Clayface was retooled after it. The 2000s-era ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' featured a new character '''[[Ethan Bennett]]''', who had ties to a young Bruce Wayne, as Clayface before introducing a version of Basil Karlo.

==Fictional character biography==
===Basil Karlo===  
[[Image:Clayface2.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Clayface I. Art by Glen Orbik and Laurel Blechman.]]
The original Clayface, '''Basil Karlo''', appeared in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #40. He is an [[actor]] who is driven mad when he hears of a remake of the classic [[horror film]] he had starred in, ''The Terror'', even though he is to be one of the advising staff. Donning the mask of the film's villain, Clayface, he embarks on a murder spree among the cast and crew of the remake. He is foiled by [[Batman]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]. He reappears in ''Detective Comics'' #49 (March 1941) after the prison ambulance he is riding in plunges off a cliff. He once again dons the mask of Clayface and targets Bruce Wayne's fiancee. Once again, the Dynamic Duo foil the evil Karlo.<ref name="dc-ency"/> The name of the character comes from [[Boris Karloff]] and[[ Basil Rathbone]].

Much later, Karlo languishes in a prison hospital, when Sondra Fuller visits him out of curiosity. Karlo proposes an alliance between all living Clayfaces to kill Batman. Even though the ''Mud Pack'', as the group called itself, is defeated, Karlo manages, by tricking his allies, to imbue himself with abilities similar to those of Preston Payne and Sondra Fuller. He was defeated by the combined efforts of Batman and [[Looker]] of the [[Outsiders]] by overloading his abilities making him melt into the ground.  While literally sinking into the earth's crust when he loses control of his power, he manages to survive, and now his body sports crystals similar to [[quartz]] that endow him with greater powers.  Karlo was able to escape his underground prison when Gotham City was struck by the great [[Cataclysm]].  He was able to capture Batman and was about to kill him, but he got into a feud with [[Mr. Freeze]] on who has a right to kill the Caped Crusader.  With that distraction, Batman soundly defeated both of them.

During the "''[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]''" storyline, Basil Karlo holds [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], who is in charge of producing fresh vegetables for the remaining people in the city, prisoner in Robinson Park. Poison Ivy eventually battles and defeats Karlo, sinking him deep into the ground. It appears that the Ultimate Clayface is destroyed in this battle, but has resurfaced as a member of the [[Villains United|Secret Society of Super Villains]]. Later, he seeks to increase his already formidable powers by absorbing [[Wonder Woman]] (a clay construct similar to him), giving him an amount of powers that bordered on invulnerability. While he is successful in absorbing the heroine, he is ultimately forced to release her.

Basil Karlo was among the members of the [[Injustice League]] and was among the villains seen in ''[[Salvation Run]]''. His name is a pun on [[Boris Karloff]]. He can be seen as the member of [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra's]] Secret Society of Super Villains.  In the second issue of ''[[Final Crisis]]'', he triggers an explosion at the ''[[Daily Planet]]''.

===Matt Hagen===<!-- This section is linked from [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]] -->
[[Image:Dc298.jpg‎|200px|thumb|right|Cover to ''Detective Comics'' #298. Matt Hagen as Clayface.]]
The second Clayface, '''Matt Hagen''', first appeared in ''Detective Comics'' #298. A treasure hunter, Hagen finds a mysterious [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] pool of [[protoplasm]] in a cave. Immersing himself in it, he is transformed into a malleable [[clay]]-like form which could be shaped into almost anything he desires. This is only a temporary effect, however, requiring him to return to the pool periodically in order to maintain use of his powers.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

He eventually copies the pool's protoplasmic jelly by chemistry studies, although the artificial proptoplasm only allows him five hours of Clayface powers compared to the full two days of the pool's. 

Hagen is ultimately killed by a shadow demon during the 12-issue [[limited series]] ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''.

During the "''Mud Pack''" storyline, the other villains who use the name Clayface gather Hagen's remains and make him a post-mortem member of their gang.

===Preston Payne===<!-- This section is linked from [[List of DC Comics characters: C]] -->
The third Clayface, '''Preston Payne''' first appeared at the end of ''Detective Comics'' #477 before making his first full appearance in #478. Suffering from [[hyperpituitarism]], Payne works at [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] searching for a cure. He obtains a sample of the then-living Matt Hagen's blood, and isolates an [[enzyme]] which he introduces into his own bloodstream. Although he is briefly able to shape his own appearance, this effect is short-lived: while on a date, his [[flesh]] begins to melt, and when he touches his horrified girlfriend, she completely melts. Payne builds an [[exoskeleton]] anti-melting suit to prevent himself from touching anyone, but he learns that he needs to spread his melting contagion onto others to survive (he feels pain if he doesn't melt anyone). During this time his mental health starts to slip as he falls in love with a wax mannequin he names "Helena", thinking she is the only woman immune to his touch. After another breakdown, he thinks Helena enjoys watching men "fighting over her" when he battles Batman yet again in front of the wax doll. Although he doesn't give her up, he keeps her in [[Arkham Asylum]], saying "''we're both too polite to admit [[divorce]], but she can't live forever.''"<ref name="dc-ency"/>

During the events of the ''Mud Pack'', Shondra Fuller, the fourth Clayface, began masquerading as the hero Looker and visited Preston at Arkham. That same night, he got into an argument with Helena and unintentionally knocked her head off. Believing he killed her, Preston went on a rampage until subdued in a nearby swamp by the asylum guards. Rescued by Fuller, who was still using Looker's appearance and powers, used them to make Preston follow Basil Karlo's, the first Clayface, commands. Karlo ultimately betrayed Fuller, and took samples of hers and Preston's blood to inject into himself. After finally breaking free of Fuller's control, he was about to kill her when she admitted how sorry she was for using him. The two fell in love and went on to live together, leading to Fuller becoming pregnant with their child, Cassius.

Preston acquires medicine to control his pain and now feels the "hunger" only in his mind. It is also revealed that he was [[child abuse|abused]] by his parents.

A stunted, emaciated Preston Payne appears in the graphic novel ''[[Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth|Arkham Asylum]]'' by [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Dave McKean]]. He is used to metaphorically represent [[sexually transmitted disease]]s.

===Sondra Fuller===<!-- This section is linked from [[List of DC Comics characters: C]] -->
The fourth Clayface, '''Sondra Fuller''', also known as Lady Clay, first appeared in ''[[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]'' (volume 1) #21. She is a member of [[Strikeforce Kobra]] who is transformed into a shape-changer by her employer [[Kobra (comics)|Kobra]]'s technologies, a process to which she agrees to become a subject because she hates her own face. 

She possesses identical abilities to those of Matt Hagen, but they are permanent, without the requirement for a source of protoplasm. She can additionally copy any special powers of the being she is mimicking. She is defeated by the Outsiders.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Later, after the Mud Pack forms and battles Batman, Fuller falls in love with Preston Payne and they have a child named Cassius "Clay" Payne. After [[Abattoir (comics)|Abbatoir]] kidnaps the child, the couple get into a fight involving [[Azrael (comics)|Azrael/Batman]].

===Mud Pack===
Before the appearance of the fifth and sixth Clayfaces, the third and fourth Clayfaces team up, breaking the original Clayface out of prison and futilely attempting to revive the second. Together, the four form the "Mud Pack". Karlo later copies the others' powers by injecting himself with extracts of samples of the other two Clayfaces, becoming the "Ultimate Clayface". The three battle, and are defeated by Batman. (Detective Comics #604-607)

===Cassius "Clay" Payne===<!-- This section is linked from [[List of DC Comics characters: C]] -->
After the Mud Pack, Payne and Fuller fall in love and eventually have a child together named '''Cassius "Clay" Payne''', who became the fifth Clayface. The boy is separated from his parents and held in a government laboratory. The full extent of his powers are unknown. The name "Cassius" is a pun on "Cassius Clay", the birthname of legendary boxer [[Muhammad Ali]].

Currently, the bio status of Cassius shows that if a piece of him is separated from his body, it can grow a mind of its own, but it mostly thinks in a retarded form of what Cassius wants. If bonded with another human (i.e. Claything), the piece can give that human Clayface-like abilities, such as become like clay, being able to withstand bullets and other harm, and could also manifest Payne's ability to melt objects; all this person would have to do is just think it. It is unknown if a person can gain different abilities when bonded with a piece of Cassius.

In a recent issue of ''[[Batman: Gotham Knights]]'', Cassius has now taken on the clay-like appearance of his mother and father, but he looks more like Basil Karlo than either of his parents. He can only stay in Clayface mode while awake.

===Claything===<!-- This section is linked from [[List of DC Comics characters: C]] -->
The sixth Clayface, also known as '''Claything''', appeared in ''Batman'' #550: "''Chasing Clay''". Claything is created when a skin sample from Cassius Payne comes to life and merges with a DEO ([[Department of Extranormal Operations]]) scientist, Dr. Malley. He has the ability to melt objects simply by looking at them. Claything is destroyed and his remains are stored at the DEO Headquarters.

===Johnny Williams===
[[Image:Gothamknights69.jpg|180px|thumb|right|{{Descript-cvr-art|''[[Batman: Gotham Knights]]''||69|Nov, 2005}}Art by [[Claudio Castellini]].]]
The seventh Clayface debuted in ''Batman'' #614 (June 2003), but was not formally introduced until ''Batman: Gotham Knights'' #60 (February 2005). '''Johnny Williams''' was once a normal firefighter in Gotham. A blast from within a chemical factory not only killed his fellow firefighters, but also changed him that day. He first discovered this after he accidentally killed a prostitute. This gave Johnny plans to kill himself. Also at that time, he was approached by [[Hush (comics)|Hush]] and the [[Riddler]], who tell him that the chemicals turned him into the latest Clayface. They began to manipulate Williams, holding out the promise of a cure and making him do his bidding, including pretending to be Tommy Elliot (Hush's true identity) to hurt and confuse Bruce Wayne. Eventually, Williams realized how much he was being manipulated. Knowing that he was going to die, he offered Batman assistance against Hush in exchange for the hero freeing Johnny's family from Hush. He redeemed himself in his death, also ensuring that butler [[Alfred Pennyworth]] was cleared of murder.

==Other media==
===Animated versions===
====''The New Adventures of Batman''====
Clayface's first appearance outside the comics was in several episodes of [[Filmation]]'s ''[[The New Adventures of Batman]]'' in the late 1970s. This show featured the Matt Hagen version of Clayface, and according to his first appearance he must drink his special potion daily to keep his Clayface powers. In this show, he often uses his powers to take on the forms of animals.

In Clayface's first episode, Clayface is shown to be able to survive in water without dissolving (unlike later animated incarnations) by turning into a [[dolphin]], but as Matt Hagen he does not know how to swim. His second episode pairs him up with [[Catwoman]] in a plot to steal [[oil]]. He is also one of the four villains featured in the two-part "''Have An Evil Day''", in which the alien Zarbor cons him, [[Joker (comics)|The Joker]], Catwoman, and [[Penguin (comics)|The Penguin]] into teaming up against Batman and Robin as a diversion while Zarbor steals Earth's nuclear plants. In this series, Clayface was voiced by [[Lou Scheimer]] and [[Lennie Weinrib]].

====DC animated universe====
=====''Batman: The Animated Series''=====
[[Image:Clayface-Batman.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Clayface as he appears in ''Batman: The Animated Series''.]]
In ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', several episodes featured a more tragic Clayface character, voiced by [[Ron Perlman]], that combined aspects of several of the comic-book Clayfaces.

In the episode "''Feat of Clay''" he is introduced as Matt Hagen (a nod to the second Clayface), a past-his-prime actor (a nod to the first Clayface) who had been [[disfigurement|disfigured]] in a horrible car accident (a nod to the third Clayface). While recovering in a burn clinic, he is approached by corrupt businessman [[Roland Daggett]], who makes him a test subject for a compound called "RenuYou" (pronounced "Renew You") that he promises will immediately restore his youthful good looks (a nod to the fourth Clayface). In exchange, Hagen must impersonate people in illegal roles for Daggett. He greatly resents this, but is forced to comply, as the RenuYou chemical is extremely addictive. Daggett has Hagen impersonate Bruce Wayne in order to obtain documents from [[Lucius Fox]], who is inadvertently wounded; Bruce Wayne is arrested for assault and brought in for questioning. Hagen, attempting to steal a large quantity of RenuYou from Daggett's compound, is seized by Daggett's henchmen; they then try to kill Hagen by pouring an entire canister of the compound on his face. Rather than kill him, however, the [[drug overdose|overdose]] saturates every [[cell (biology)|cell]] in his body, turning him into a bulky and misshapen clay like form who can, for short periods of time, shapeshift into anything or anybody he wishes. After trying to get [[revenge]] on Daggett, he is stopped by Batman and, upon being caught, fakes his death. 

Clayface reappears in the episode "''Mudslide''", in which he has been in hiding since the events of "''Feat of Clay''" and in which his body is beginning to deteriorate. He is restored to a semblance of health by a former medical adviser on his films, Dr. Stella Bates, who falls in love with Hagen. She sells her motel in order to raise funds for a laboratory in which to treat him. Batman tracks him down and prevents Dr. Bates' treatment of Clayface (partly because he stole the necessary formula compound from Wayne Biomedical Labs). He and Clayface then fight, but Hagen's now-unstable clay form absorbs too much rainwater to hold its cohesion, falls into the ocean, and he is destroyed once he dissolves. (This episode is notable for its numerous references to classic movies, in-jokes associated with Clayface's history as an actor. For example, Dr. "Bates" owns a "motel," referencing [[Psycho]], while, at the end, a rain-washed Clayface moans for the doctor, crying, "Stella!", in reference to [[A Streetcar Named Desire (play)|A Streetcar Named Desire]].)

An action figure of this version of Clayface was featured in the ''Batman: The Animated Series'' toy line and featured a firing spiked ball.

=====''The New Batman Adventures''=====
[[Image:Clayface3.jpg||thumb|right|225px|Clayface as he appears in ''The New Batman Adventures'']]
In ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', Hagen's character re-forms again in "''Growing Pains''", in which Robin ([[Robin (Tim Drake)|Tim Drake]]) befriends a lost, [[amnesia]]c little girl he names "Annie". The child turns out to be a portion of Clayface - who has returned to life by way of some strange chemicals - that has gained sentience and an identity on its own, and in the end is re-absorbed into the main body of the villain, effectively "killing" the girl as a separate person. Due to this, Robin (who had feelings for her) mumbled the extra charge of murder to himself as Clayface was taken by the police. [[Batgirl]] ([[Barbara Gordon]]) is also shown battling Clayface in one segment of a [[Christmas]] themed episode, "''Holiday Knights''", in which Clayface further expands his separative ability by posing as four separate children at once to shoplift from Gotham department stores at the height of the [[Christmas Eve]] rush.

====''Justice League''====
A more sympathetic Clayface makes his return to action in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' series, where it is revealed that at some point, he had been captured, separated, and sealed into several [[biological hazard|biohazard]] canisters by [[Morgan Edge]]. [[Gorilla Grodd]] and his newly-formed Secret Society attacks Edge's mansion, freeing Clayface and offering him a position in their group. Although Clayface is reluctant at first, Grodd promises to find a way to revert Clayface back to his human form. Clayface is defeated when [[Wally West|the Flash]] plants fireworks in his clay body and [[Hawkgirl#Justice League|Hawkgirl]] ignites them, blowing Clayface apart. He resurfaces in a later issue of the ''JLU'' comic.

====''The Batman''====
There are two versions of Clayface in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'':

=====Ethan Bennett=====
{{main|Ethan Bennett}}
[[Image:Clayface of Tragedy.jpg|right|thumb|Clayface, as he appears in ''The Batman'']]
The first Clayface is [[Ethan Bennett]], a detective in the [[Gotham City Police Department]] and Bruce Wayne's friend from high school. This version of Clayface is voiced by [[Steve Harris (actor)|Steve Harris]].

Clayface originates in the two-part episodes "''The Rubber Face of Comedy''/''Clayface of Tragedy''". After he inhales a dose of the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]'s Joker Putty (following a session of extensive [[brainwashing]], driving him insane), Bennett is rescued by Batman and his partner, Detective [[Ellen Yin]]. He is suspended by Chief Rojas after publicly denouncing the chief's claims about Batman. At his apartment, Bennett mutates into a featureless gray clay-like figure, and tries to look for help, scaring away the locals, though he manages to change back into his original form with practice. After many battles with Batman, it has become clear that he still holds a grudge against the Joker. At one point he even impersonates [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]] in order to loot the city on [[Halloween]], but is ultimately stopped by Batman.

As Clayface returns in the fourth season episode "''Clayfaces''", Bennett seems to have finally reformed. He tracks down and captures the Joker, disguising himself as the Joker's henchmen, Punch and Judy. He hands him over the police without using excessive force, and turns himself in to the authorities, who take him to Arkham Asylum. However, Bennett has not completely regained Bruce Wayne's (and Batman's) trust. He is eager to leave Arkham and continue working as a police officer, although Batman refuses to consider this request until Bennett is cured, citing he could easily go back to crime.

When Basil Karlo begins wreaking havoc as the second Clayface, Bennett feels he is the only one who could defeat Karlo. Bennett once again requests a second chance, but after he is refused again, he resorts to escaping from Arkham. Bennett tracks down and battles Karlo with the aid of Batman and Robin. Bennett holds Karlo down while Batman administers the antidote. Bennett is shown at the end to be fully cured, while Karlo retains his powers.

=====Basil Karlo=====
[[Image:KarloClayface.jpg|right|thumb|Basil Karlo as the second Clayface in ''The Batman'']]
The fourth season episode "''Clayfaces''" introduces Basil Karlo (in his first actual appearance outside the comics) as the series' second Clayface, voiced by [[Wallace Langham]] and later by [[Lex Lang]]. Here, he is shown to be an ugly, untalented actor. He is seen repeatedly turned down in auditions for a dog food commercial when he hears that Bennett is about to be cured.

Karlo breaks into Wayne Industries and drinks a refined, purified sample of the Clayface mutagen Bennett was exposed to. This successfully turns him into Clayface. After being rejected once again for a dog food commercial, he snaps and uses his Clayface powers to attack the city. At first he believes this incident would be the death of his career, but he then sees that being a [[supervillain]] has made him a celebrity, covered on nearly every channel. At the last channel he stops on, it shows his previous movie, ''The Revenge of The Atomic Clone''. 

After a battle with Batman, Robin, and Ethan Bennett, Basil Karlo is injected with the Clayface antidote, seemingly restoring him to normal. However, the episode's final scene shows that Karlo has retained his powers.

He reappears in ''The Batman/Superman Story, Part One'' where he, along with [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] and [[Mr. Freeze]], is in the employ of [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]], who has teamed up with [[Lex Luthor]] and kidnapped [[Lois Lane]] as bait for a trap to lure in [[Superman]].

===Live action television===
====''Birds of Prey''====
Clayface also made an appearance in the 12th episode of the short-lived ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]'' television series portrayed by [[Kirk Baltz]]. This version of Clayface is an artist - not a [[thespian]], but a sculpturist--who is artistically inspired by the agony of others.  Like other versions, he is a [[shapeshifter]], but his powers are explained to come from taking a special formula specifically tailored by a crooked scientist to work with his DNA. In this series, he is hired by the Joker to kill Catwoman. He has a son named '''Chris Cassius''' (a pun on [[Muhammad Ali]], whose birth name was [[Cassius Marcellus Clay|Cassius Clay]]) who turns people into clay after stealing and taking his father's formula, making his powers similar to the Preston Payne Clayface and his own son, "Clay" Payne.

===Video games===
Clayface has made several appearances in [[video game]]s featuring Batman. He appeared as a boss in ''[[The Adventures of Batman & Robin (video game)|The Adventures of Batman & Robin]]'' for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] and [[Sega Mega-CD|Sega CD]] and ''[[Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu]]''. Ron Perlman reprised his role as Clayface from the animated series for the latter two games. The Sega CD game features Clayface as the final boss, where he impersonates crime lord [[Rupert Thorne]] while the real Thorne is on vacation. He then uses Thorne's wealth to hire some of Batman's greatest villains ([[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], [[Riddler|the Riddler]], and the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]) to kill him, so that [[Gotham City]] would be his for the taking. In the end, Clayface tries to escape in a helicopter, but it crashes into the side of a bridge, causing him to fall into the harbor and dissolve.

He appears in ''[[Lego Batman: The Videogame]]'', his structure and look is that of the Matt Hagen Clayface from ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', but the game names him as Basil Karlo.<ref>''Game Informer'' features a two-page gallery of the many heroes and villains who appear in the game with a picture for each character and a descriptive paragraph.  See "''LEGO Batman'': Character Gallery," ''Game Informer'' 186 (October 2008): 93.</ref>  In the game he is an enemy of [[Batman]] and a follower of [[the Riddler]].  He and Riddler break into a bank in order to steal a (gigantic) key to the Gotham gold reserves. While Riddler gets away, Clayface stays at the bank and builds a tiny house of gold bars, and is subsequently defeated by Batman and Robin. His possesses  super strength and the ability to double jump. His actions and mannerisms suggests a low level of intelligence; "Iconic characters, such as Clayface and Robin, have been turned into village idiots," writes Ben of ''Gamer Informer''.<ref>Ben, "''LEGO Batman'': Time to build something new," ''Game Informer'' 187 (November 2008): 116.</ref>

Clayface is set to appear in the upcoming video game, ''[[DC Universe Online]]''.
