'''Clayface''' is the identity used by a number of [[shapeshifting]] [[supervillain]]s who have battled the [[Batman]]. He is notable for being a classic villain who is [[metahuman]] rather that a deranged 'normal' human being like most in the Batman's [[rogues gallery]].

==Basil Karlo (aka Ultimate Clayface)==
The original Clayface, '''Basil Karlo''', appeared in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #40. He was an [[actor]] who was driven mad when he heard of a remake of the classic [[horror film]] he had starred in. Donning the mask of the film's villain, the Clayface, he embarked on a murder spree among the cast and crew of the remake. He was foiled by Batman and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], and incarcerated in [[Arkham Asylum]].

Much later, during the final stages of the Mud Pack Event (see below), he was imbued with abilities similar to those of Clayfaces III and IV, and was dubbed the "Ultimate Clayface".

During the "No Man's Land" event, Basil Karlo battled and was defeated by [[Poison Ivy]] in Robinson Park. It appears the Ultimate Clayface was destroyed in this battle, but has resurfaced as a member of the [[Villains United|Secret Society of Super Villains]].

==Matt Hagen==
The second Clayface, '''Matt Hagen''', first appeared in ''Detective Comics'' #298. A treasure hunter, Hagen found a mysterious [[radioactive]] pool of [[protoplasm]] in a cave. Immersing himself in it, he was transformed into a malleable [[clay]]-like form which could be shaped into almost anything he desired, though this was only a temporary effect, requiring him to return to the pool periodically in order to maintain use of his powers. Hagen was ultimately killed during the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''. During the Mud Pack storyline, the other villains that used the name Clayface gathered Clayface II's remains and made him a post-mortem member of the Mud Pack.

==Preston Payne==
The third Clayface, '''Preston Payne''', first appeared in ''Detective Comics'' #478.  Suffering from hyperpituitarism, Payne worked at [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] searching for a cure. He obtained a sample of the then-living Matt Hagen's blood, and isolated an [[enzyme]] which he introduced into his own bloodstream. Although he was briefly able to shape his own appearance, this effect was short-lived: while on a date, his [[flesh]] began to melt, and when he touched his horrified woman, she completely melted. Payne built an [[exoskeleton]] anti-melting suit to prevent himself from touching anyone, but he learned that he needed to spread his melting contagion onto others to survive (he feels pain if he doesn't melt anyone). He fought and was defeated by Batman, and was believed dead for a time.

==Sondra Fuller==
The fourth Clayface, '''Sondra Fuller''', also known as Lady Clay, first appeared in ''[[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]'' (volume 1) #21. She was an agent of [[Kobra (comics)|Kobra]] who was transformed into a shape-changer by her employer's technologies. She possesses identical abilities to those of Matt Hagen, but without the requirement for a source of protoplasm. She was defeated by the Outsiders.

==Cassius "Clay" Payne==
After the Mud Pack, Payne and Fuller fell in love and eventually became recluses and had a child together named '''Cassius "Clay" Payne''', who became the fifth Clayface.  The boy is separated from his parents and held in a government laboratory.  The full extent of his powers are unknown. The name "Cassius" is a pun on "Cassius Clay", the  birthname of legendary boxer [[Muhammad Ali]].

==Claything==
The sixth Clayface, also known as '''Claything''', was created when a skin sample from Cassius Payne came to life and merged with a DEO (Department of Extra-Normal Operations) scientist, Dr. Malley.  He had the ability to melt objects simply by looking at them. Claything was destroyed and his remains are stored at the DEO HQ. These events took place in ''Batman #550'': "Chasing Clay".

==The Mud Pack==
Before the appearance of the fifth and sixth Clayfaces, the third and fourth Clayfaces teamed up, breaking the original Clayface out of prison. Karlo later managed to copy the others' powers by injecting himself with extracts of samples of the other two Clayfaces, becoming the "Ultimate Clayface".  The three battled and were defeated by Batman.

==Clayface in other media==
In ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', several episodes featured a more tragic Clayface character, voiced by [[Ron Perlman]], that combined aspects of several of the comic-book Clayfaces. He was Matt Hagen, a past-his-prime actor who had been [[disfigurement|disfigured]] in a horrible car accident and was rushed to the burn clinic. While at the burn clinic, he was approached by corrupt businessman [[Roland Daggett]] and had him turned to an untested, non-FDA approved, and highly [[addictive]], [[cosmetic]] compound called Renuyu to maintain his youthful appearance compared to years of plastic surgery. In exchange, Hagen would commit crimes for him. When Hagen stopped, his supply was cut off. He was caught in Daggett Industries trying to steal a large supply of Renuyu by Raymond Bell and [[Germs (Batman)|Germs]], who worked for Roland Daggett; they then tried to kill him by forcing him to ingest an entire canister of Renuyu. Rather than kill him, however, the [[overdose]] saturated every [[cell (biology)|cell]] in his body, turning him into a bulky and misshapen claylike form who could, for short periods of time, shapeshift into anything or anybody he wished. After trying to get [[revenge]] on Daggett, he was stopped and, apparently, destroyed by Batman. It was soon discovered that he had faked his own death, however, and was still very much alive for the time being.

Eventually, Clayface began to slowly fall apart as his chemical structure degraded. He took refuge with a young, female research scientist who fell in love with him and helped him commit crimes to afford the research necessary to find a cure. Just as they were about to administer a treatment, however, Batman intervened and fought him. Beaten, Clayface essentially committed [[suicide]] by allowing himself to fall into the nearby [[ocean]]. 

About a year later, he once again took shape, hiding in the Gotham [[reservoir (water)|reservoir]] system, and gained the ability to form [[automaton|automata]] from his body to be sent to do things for him at a distance. [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] encountered one which had no memory of her [[origin]] and developed an independent personality. In time, Clayface sought to reabsorb her, fighting Robin to get to her. As Clayface was just about to kill the hopelessly overmatched Robin, the automaton [[sacrifice]]d herself to save him by running and absorbing herself into her maker, knocking him into the sewer.  

Eventually in ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'', Clayface was separated and sealed into several [[biohazard]] canisters, which came into the possession of a wealthy collector named [[Morgan Edge]]. [[Gorilla Grodd]] and his newly-formed Secret Society attacked his mansion, freeing Clayface and offering him a position in their group. Grodd promised Clayface that he'll find a way to revert Clayface back to Matt Hagen. Clayface and the other members of the Society were finally defeated by the Justice League.  

In ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', Clayface is [[Detective Ethan Bennett]], the detective at the police force, and Bruce Wayne's friend at high school. Bennett was a great supporter of the Batman.

Clayface originates in the two-part episodes "The Rubber Face of Comedy/The Clay Face of Tragedy." After he inhaled a dose of Joker's ''Joker Putty'', Bennett was rescued by Batman and his partner, and got suspended by Chief Rojas after he claims the sayings of Batman are wrong. At Bennett's apartment, Bennett mutated into a featureless gray-clay like figure, and tries to look for help, only to scare away the locals, and he was dubbed Clayface. Clayface had become insane of killing his boss.  Now, everyone, including Batman, and Bennett's partner Detective Ellen Yin, doesn't recognize him, until Batman and Yin found the connection that Clayface was Ethan Bennett. At East Gotham Gym, Chief Rojas almost got killed by Clayface, after Batman rescued him, and he and Clayface confront each other. In the end, Clayface turns into a puddle to go down the drain, after having a talk with his partner, and Yin accepted Batman as an ally.  

In ''Meltdown'', Clayface is getting a payback against the Joker for his transformation, and he was captured by Batman using a freeze pellet. After Bennett was released in Arkham Asylum on probation during a trial where a scientist and [[Hugo Strange]] protested against Bruce Wayne's suggestion, he still wanted to get Joker during the time he was a security guard. At the confrontation, Clayface becomes a criminal and he got send to Arkham after getting away from Batman only to get captured by Ellen Yin who uses a freeze pellet where he resides at his cell. 

In ''Grundy's Night'', Clayface disguises as [[Solomon Grundy]] to terrorize Halloween. In the wax museum, Batman confronts Clayface. In the end, Clayface was encased in wax, and he was taken back to Arkham Asylum. 

This version of Clayface was voiced by [[Steve Harris]].

The original animated form of Clayface was derived from the ''[[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]]'' comics character [[Plasmus]].  

Clayface also made an appearance in the last episode of the short-lived ''[[Birds of Prey (television series)|Birds of Prey]]'' television series. In this series he killed Catwoman.
