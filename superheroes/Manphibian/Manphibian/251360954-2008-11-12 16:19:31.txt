'''Manphibian''' is a fictional character from the [[Marvel Universe]] who first appeared in ''Legion of Monsters'' #1.  It has some resemblance to the "Gill Man"  seen in ''[[Creature from the Black Lagoon]]''.

==History==
'''Manphibian''' is an [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]] creature that arrived on [[Earth]] over 1000 years ago.  It is revived in 1975 and is later revealed to be captured by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]  It is then placed in the [[Nick Fury's Howling Commandos|Howling Commandos]] Monster Force.

A ''Manphibian'' is also the term for a man who is equally at home on land and in water, and/or equally comfortable in a wide range of surroundings or habitat (ie on a construction site or at a dance club).  Because of their amazing adaptability Manphibians are often very socially adept and usually like to surf.  Jason Plitz is the best known of the ''Manphibians'' (see photo [http://www.pondhockeymovie.com/media/manphibian.jpg Jason 'The Manphibian' Plitz]). The ''Manphibian'' song was created in his honor (see link
