'''Red Wolf''' is the name of a number of [[fictional character]]s in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[shared universe]], the [[Marvel Universe]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Johnny Wakeley===
'''Johnny Wakeley''' was the adopted name of a Cheyenne man who was raised from childhood by a white couple in the late 19th century. His adoptive parents were killed by Native Americans in retaliation for the U.S. Army cavalry's massacre of their own people. Pursued by members of his own tribe, Wakeley stumbled into the burial place of a former man known as Red Wolf and was visited by the spirit of a Cheyenne god named [[Owayodata]]. He was given the ceremonial garb of the Red Wolf, and the coup stick, his totem of power, and became the first known recorded Red Wolf.<ref>''Marvel Spotlight'' #1 (November 1971)</ref> Red Wolf used his newfound great skills and prowess to promote peace between the white and Native American peoples.<ref>''Red Wolf'' #1-6 (May 1972-March 1973)</ref>

The character appears in 2010's ''[[Rawhide Kid]]: The Sensational Seven''.

===William Talltrees===
'''William Talltrees''' is a man born in modern times, born in [[Wolf Point, Montana]]. He was the son of Thomas Talltrees, a Cheyenne tribal leader, and grew up hearing tales of the legendary Red Wolf. William witnessed his father being intimidated into selling his property to corrupt businessman [[Taurus (comics)|Cornelius van Lunt]]; that night, van Lunt's henchmen killed William's family. William swore vengeance, finding and donning the ceremonial garb of Red Wolf. Owayodata visited him and imbued the young man with his spiritual legacy, granting him superhuman powers. The new Red Wolf found a wolf cub that he named Lobo and trained to be his companion.  Following van Lunt back to New York, he was able to gain vengeance on him with the aid of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>''Avengers'' #80-81</ref>

Alongside Jill tomahawk, Red Wolf battled King Cycle.<ref>''Red Wolf'' #8</ref> He also battled Clayton Bickford.<ref>''Red Wolf'' #9</ref> Red Wolf was also once assisted by [[Gabriel, Devil Hunter]].<ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' #9; note that the character in the ''Red Wolf'' series may not be William Talltrees</ref>

It was revealed that Will Talltrees was part of a squad of Marines during the [[Vietnam War]], along with Willie Lincoln, Josh Cooper, [[War Machine|Jim Rhodes]], and others named Fong and Janes. They were part of an attack on a village that resulted in the slaughter of the parents of The [[Bengal (comics)|Bengal]]. As an adult, Bengal resurfaced to take vengeance on those Marines,<ref>''Daredevil'' #258</ref> but has since turned away from his vendetta. Red Wolf suffered a crisis of faith caused by his defeat at the hands of the Bengal.<ref name="Marvel Comics Presents #15">''Marvel Comics Presents'' #15</ref>

Some time later, Red Wolf adopted a new wolf cub.<ref name="Marvel Comics Presents #15"/> Alongside [[Doctor Strange]] and the [[Black Crow (comics)|Black Crow]], Red Wolf stopped the Cheyenne pantheon from taking vengeance for the Cheyenne people.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' Vol. 3 #25</ref> Red Wolf later battled eco-terrorists in the employ of [[Roxxon Oil Company]].<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #107</ref>

Weeks after the conclusion to the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] event, Red Wolf was seen as a member of Texas' new government-sponsored superhero team, the revived Rangers, as part of the [[Fifty State Initiative]] Program.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = Mark Millar | Penciller = Steve McNiven | Inker = Dexter Vines | Story =  | Title = Civil War | Volume = 1 | Issue = 7  | Date =  | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>

During the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'', a [[Skrull]] had posed as Lobo and attacked [[Delroy Garrett]], [[Ant-Man (Eric O'Grady)|Ant-Man]] III, and the Rangers in a Skrull/wolf-like form. When Red Wolf asked it what they did with the real Lobo, the Skrull-Lobo says that he'll learn his wolf's fate soon enough when he shares it with him. Delroy and Red Wolf subdued the Skrull-Lobo and Shooting Star shot it.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #19</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The wolf spirit Owayodata (a god of the Native American pantheon) granted William Talltrees superhuman strength, and sensory acuity heightened to superhuman levels. He is also a highly skilled hand-to-hand combatant, an experienced wrestler, an adept combat gymnast, a superb archer, and an expert marksman with throwing weapons. He is an expert tracker, and a skilled animal trainer. His weapons include a coup stick (a six-foot wooden staff used as a bow or javelin), a tomahawk, a hunting knife, and a bow and arrows. 

According to one text, Red Wolf was able to cause his coup stick and his wolf companion Lobo to appear from nowhere, and Lobo also possessed the power of intangibility. Since the same text also related an erroneous account of Red Wolf's origin, giving his real name as Thomas Thunderhead, and referred to him as a Sioux rather than a Cheyenne, it may be regarded as apocryphal.

==Other versions==
* In ''[[Avengers Forever]]'', an ancestor of William Talltrees, named Wildrun, is addressed by [[Libra (comics)|Libra]] as "the first of the Red Wolves."<ref>''Avengers Forever'' #3</ref>
