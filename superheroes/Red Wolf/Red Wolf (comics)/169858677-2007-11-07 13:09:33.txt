'''Red Wolf''' is the name of a number of fictional characters in the [[Marvel Universe]].

==Johnny Wakeley==
===Fictional character biography===
'''Johnny Wakeley''' was the adopted name of a Cheyenne man who was raised from childhood by a white couple in the late 19th century.  His adoptive parents were killed by Native Americans in retaliation for the U.S. Army cavalry's massacre of their own people.  Pursued by members of his own tribe, Wakeley stumbled into the burial place of a former man known as Red Wolf and was visited by the spirit of a Cheyenne god named [[Owayodata]].  He was given the ceremonial garb of the Red Wolf, and the coup stick, his totem of power, and became the first known recorded Red Wolf.  Red Wolf used his newfound great skills and prowess to promote peace between the white and Native American peoples.

==William Talltrees==
===Fictional character biography===
'''William Talltrees''' is a man born in modern times, born in [[Wolf Point, Montana]].  He was the son of Thomas Talltrees, a Cheyenne tribal leader, and grew up hearing tales of the legendary Red Wolf.  William witnessed his father being intimidated into selling his property to corrupt businessman [[Taurus (comics)|Cornelius van Lunt]]; that night, van Lunt's henchmen killed William's family.  William swore vengeance, finding and donning the ceremonial garb of Red Wolf.  Owayodata visited him and imbued the young man with his spiritual legacy.  The new Red Wolf found a wolf cub whom he named Lobo and trained to be his companion.  Following van Lunt back to New York, he was able to gain vengeance on him with the aid of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].

It was revealed that Will Talltrees was part of a squad of Marines during the [[Vietnam War]], along with others named Fong and Janes and Willie Lincoln. They were part of an attack on a village that resulted in the slaughter of the parents of The [[Bengal (comics)|Bengal]]. Bengal resurfaced to take vengeance on those Marines, but has since turned away from his vendetta.

===Civil War/The Initiative===
Weeks after the conclusion to the ''[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]'' event, Red Wolf was seen as a member of Texas' new government-sponsored superhero team, the revived [[Rangers (comics)|Rangers]], as part of the [[50 States Initiative]] Program.

William has been identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes who appear on the cover of the comic book ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #1. <ref>[http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 ''Avengers: The Initiative'' #1 Character Map]</ref>
