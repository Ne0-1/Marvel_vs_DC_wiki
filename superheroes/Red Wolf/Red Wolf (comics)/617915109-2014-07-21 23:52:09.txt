'''Red Wolf''' is the name of a number of [[fictional character]]s in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[shared universe]], the [[Marvel Universe]]. The different characters are Native American heroes with mystical powers and have a trusted wolf companion named Lobo.<ref>{{Cite book|first1=Gina Renée|last1=Misiroglu|first2=David A.|last2=Roach||title=The Superhero Book: The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Comic-book Icons and Hollywood Heroes|publisher=Visible Ink Press|year=2004|page=562|isbn=978-1-57859-154-1|url=http://books.google.fr/books?id=IDlEHGKj8JgC&pg=PA562#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=May 4, 2014}}</ref>

==Publication history==
Red Wolf is Marvel's first Native American superhero.<ref name=ComicBookNation>[http://books.google.fr/books?id=_iYL9qTMu1EC&pg=PA249#v=onepage&q&f=false Comic Book Nation: The Transformation of Youth Culture in America]</ref> The William Talltrees version of Red Wolf first appeared in the story "The Coming of Red Wolf!" published in ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #80 ([[cover-date]]d Sept. 1970), and was created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[John Buscema]].<ref>[http://books.google.fr/books?id=Y0O-Jh5dugUC&pg=PA4#v=onepage&q&f=false Multicultural Comics: From Zap to Blue Beetle]</ref> The character appeared also in the next issue. Shortly afterward, Marvel editor-in-chief [[Stan Lee]] began prominently incorporating minorities and female characters into the Marvel lineup. The character became the star of the nine-issue series ''Red Wolf'' (May 1972 - Sept. 1973. The stories delved into American Indian culture and were set in the Old West.<ref name=ComicBookNation/><ref>{{cite book |last1=Raphael |first1=Jordan |last2=Spurgeon |first2=Tom |year=2004 |title=Stan Lee and the Rise and Fall of the American Comic Book |url=http://books.google.fr/books?id=_fsoARercNsC&pg=PA141#v=onepage&q&f=false |page=141 |publisher=Chicago Review Press |isbn=9781556525414 |accessdate=December 14, 2013}}</ref> These adventures featured Johnny Wakely in issues #1-6 and Thomas Thunderhead in #7-9, both Red Wolf predecessors of William Talltrees. The Wakely version lives in the late 19th century and appeared in subsequent comic books about the Old West. The Thunderhead version lives in the 1970s and was never used again.

In 1976, writer [[Tony Isabella]] made the Talltrees version and the superheroine [[Tigra]] a team in ''Marvel Chillers'' #3, 5 and 6.  In the issue #7, [[Jim Shooter]] wrote a story where the two superheroes fought the [[Super Skrull]]. Years later, in the story "You Get What You Need!" published in ''[[Incredible Hulk]]'' vol. 2, #265 (Nov. 1981), writer [[Bill Mantlo]] and penciller [[Sal Buscema]] created the superhero team the [[Rangers (comics)|Rangers]], consisting of Western characters [[Firebird (Marvel Comics)|Bonita Juarez / Firebird]], [[Shooting Star (comics)|Victoria Starvin / Shooting Star]], [[Texas Twister|Drew Daniels / Texas Twister]], [[Phantom Rider (Hamilton Slade)|Hamilton Slade / Phantom Rider]], then called Night Rider, and William Talltrees, the contemporary Red Wolf.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Green |first=Paul |date= |title=Encyclopedia of Weird Westerns: Supernatural and Science Fiction Elements in Novels, Pulps, Comics, Films, Television and Games |url=http://books.google.fr/books?id=HDnHo993Dv0C&pg=PA168#v=onepage&q&f=false |page=168 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=9780786458004 |accessdate=December 13, 2013}}</ref>

In ''Fantastic Four Annual'' #25 (Oct. 1992), writer [[Mark Gruenwald]] and penciller [[Herb Trimpe]] created the [[Anachronauts (comics)|Anachronauts]], [[Kang the Conqueror]]'s personal guard. Among them, there was Wildrun, the first of the Red Wolves. The character appeared in subsequent comic books featuring the Anachronauts until his last appearance in ''Avengers Forever'' #3 (February 1999).<ref name=Anachronauts>{{cite web |url=http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/anachron.htm |title=Anachronauts |last1=Ettlinger |first1=Markus Raimund |website=marvunapp.com |publisher=the Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe |accessdate=December 16, 2013}}</ref>

The Wakely version of Red Wolf appeared in 2000's ''[[Blaze of Glory: The Last Ride of the Western Heroes]]''. [[John Ostrander]], the creator of this comic book series, remade the character as a western vigilante.<ref>[http://books.google.fr/books?id=Nf5tAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT34#v=onepage&q&f=false Native Americans in Comic Books: A Critical Study], p.34-35</ref> In 2006, Red Wolf has an entry in the ''Marvel Westerns: Outlaw Files'' (June 2006).<ref>[http://www.marvunapp.com/ohotmu/appendixes/outapp.htm Outlaw Files] at marvunapp.com</ref> The same year, writer [[Karl Kesel]] and penciller [[Carmine Di Giandomenico]] wrote a story on the Wakely version of Red Wolf in ''Mighty Marvel Western - Western Legends'' #1 (September 2006).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&old=1&id=7687 |title=Marvel Previews for 7/19: "Captain America," "New X-Men" & More! |first1=Jonah |last1=Weiland |date=June 27, 2006 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=December 14, 2013}}</ref>

Johnny Wakely also appeared in 2010's ''[[Rawhide Kid]]: The Sensational Seven''. The series includes a mix of actual, real world Western heroes and ones from Marvel continuity.<ref>[http://marvel.com/news/story/12635/tuesday_qa_ron_zimmerman Tuesday Q&A: Ron Zimmerman]</ref> In an interview with [[Comic Book Resources]], writer [[Ron Zimmerman]] revealed that Red Wolf and his canine companion Lobo would get a bit of a reinvention in the series. He pointed to Red Wolf as his favorite character in the book, next to Rawhide Kid and expressed an interest in writing a spinoff title starring the character. "Red Wolf is probably the only one on the team that is the intellectual equal of Rawhide Kid," said the writer. "I would liken him a little bit to Hank McCoy. He's incredibly well educated and very articulate. This isn't Tonto. This guy will hopefully read as funny, because he's nothing like any other Native American of that day - other than the fact that he's not crazy about white people. He's a little bit of a racist. But still, he's a hero."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=25768 |title=Zimmerman Rides Again with The Rawhide Kid |first1=Kevin |last1=Mahadeo |date=April 16, 2010 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=December 14, 2013}}</ref>

In a 2011 interview, writer [[Jason Aaron]] revealed that in his original outline of ''Astonishing Spider-Man & Wolverine'', the title characters would have been stranded in the 15th century where Spider-Man would have started the [[New World]] Avengers with Sasquatch, Red Wolf and an Aztec Ghost Rider.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=32564 |title=X-POSITION: Aaron Talks X-Men and Inner Turmoil |first1=George A. |last1=Tramountanas |date=May 31, 2011 | publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=December 14, 2013}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==

===Wildrun===
'''Wildrun''' is the Red Wolf of the 18th century in the [[American frontier|Wild West]]. In order for the Cheyenne to have a place to live, he drove the Sioux away from the plains. [[Kang the Conqueror]] is the only man to have defeated him in battle. As a result, Wildrun swore loyalty to Kang and became a member of his personal guard, the [[Anachronauts (comics)|Anachronauts]]. In ''[[Avengers Forever]]'', [[Libra (Marvel Comics)|Libra]] who somehow knows Wildrun described him as "the first of the Red Wolves."<ref name=Anachronauts/><ref>''Avengers Forever'' #3</ref>

===Johnny Wakely===
'''Johnny Wakely''' was the adopted name of a [[Cheyenne people|Cheyenne]] man who was raised from childhood by a white couple in the late 19th century.<ref>[http://books.google.fr/books?id=3et4AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA29#v=onepage&q&f=false Native Americans in Comic Books: A Critical Study], p.29</ref> His adoptive parents were killed by Native Americans in retaliation for the U.S. Army cavalry's massacre of their own people. Some time later, a local land baron tried to buy the Wakely property; when Johnny refused to sell, the land baron's hired guns burned down the house. Trying to find his place in this world, Johnny joined the U.S. Cavalry at Fort Rango as a scout, but although accepted by the commanding officer found himself shunned and despised by the soldiers. While on a scouting mission to find a renegade Indian war party, Johnny's position was accidentally given away. Pursued by the warriors, Wakely stumbled into the burial place of a former warrior known as Red Wolf and was visited by the spirit of a Cheyenne god named [[Owayodata]]. He was given the ceremonial garb of the Red Wolf, and the coup stick, his totem of power, and became the first known recorded Red Wolf.<ref>''Marvel Spotlight'' #1 (November 1971)</ref> Red Wolf used his new-found great skills and prowess to promote peace between the white and Native American peoples.<ref>''Red Wolf'' #1-6 (May 1972-March 1973)</ref> He fought and defeated Ursa the Man Bear<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/ursamb.htm |title=Ursa the Man Bear |last1=Christiansen |first1=Jeff |website=marvunapp.com |publisher=the Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe |accessdate=December 16, 2013}}</ref> and Devil Rider.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/devrid.htm |title=Devil Rider |last1=Christiansen |first1=Jeff |website=marvunapp.com |publisher=the Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe |accessdate=December 16, 2013}}</ref>

===William Talltrees===
'''William Talltrees''' is a man born in modern times, born in [[Wolf Point, Montana]]. He was the son of Rebecca and Thomas Talltrees, a Cheyenne tribal leader, and grew up hearing tales of the legendary Red Wolf.<ref name=A80-81/><ref>[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix6/talltreesthomas.htm Thomas Talltrees] at marvunapp.com</ref><ref>[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix6/talltreesrebecca.htm Rebecca Talltrees] at marvunapp.com</ref> William witnessed his father being intimidated into selling his property to corrupt businessman [[Taurus (comics)|Cornelius van Lunt]] and his enfoncer Jason Birch; that night, van Lunt's henchmen killed William's family. William swore vengeance, finding and donning the ceremonial garb of Red Wolf. Owayodata visited him and imbued the young man with his spiritual legacy, granting him superhuman powers. The new Red Wolf found a wolf cub that he named Lobo and trained to be his companion. Following the two criminals back to New York, he was able to gain vengeance on them with the aid of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref name=A80-81>''Avengers'' #80-81</ref><ref>[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix2/taurusvanlunt.htm Taurus (Cornelius van Lunt)] at marvunapp.com</ref><ref>[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix6/birchjason.htm Jason Birch] at marvunapp.com</ref>

It was revealed that Will Talltrees was part of a squad of Marines during the [[Vietnam War]], along with Willie Lincoln, Josh Cooper, [[War Machine|Jim Rhodes]], and others named Fong and Janes. They were part of an attack on a village that resulted in the slaughter of the parents of The [[Bengal (comics)|Bengal]].

During the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'', a [[Skrull]] had posed as Lobo and attacked [[Delroy Garrett]], [[Ant-Man (Eric O'Grady)|Eric O'Grady / Ant-Man]], and the Rangers in a Skrull/wolf-like form. When Red Wolf asked it what they did with the real Lobo, the Skrull-Lobo says that he'll learn his wolf's fate soon enough when he shares it with him.

==Powers and abilities==
The wolf spirit Owayodata (a god of the Native American pantheon) granted William Talltrees superhuman strength, and sensory acuity heightened to superhuman levels. He is also a highly skilled hand-to-hand combatant, an experienced wrestler, an adept combat gymnast, a superb archer, and an expert marksman with throwing weapons. He is an expert tracker, and a skilled animal trainer. His weapons include a coup stick (a six-foot wooden staff used as a bow or javelin), a tomahawk, a hunting knife, and a bow and arrows.

Wildrun displayed no superhuman abilities, but presumably had the same enhanced senses and tracking skills as his successors. His weapons are a bow, dagger and spear. Sometimes, when he was a member of the Anachronauts, he used explosive arrows.

Thomas Thunderhead was able to cause his coup stick and his wolf companion Lobo to appear from nowhere, and Lobo also possessed the power of intangibility.

==Supporting cast==
Except Wildrun, the three other characters have a wolf companion named Lobo in nearly all their adventures. In ''Marvel Super-Heroes'' #2 (1990), William Talltrees used a horse named Ranger.<ref>[http://www.marvunapp.com/ohotmu/appendixes/petapp.htm Cowboy horses of the Old West]</ref>

==Other characters named Red Wolf==
In ''Rawhide Kid'' #27 (April 1962), writer [[Stan Lee]] and artists [[Jack Kirby]] and [[Dick Ayers]] introduced an Apache warrior named Red Wolf. This character appeared only in the second story of this issue named "The Girl, the Gunman, and the Apaches!". Red Wolf and other Apaches attacked a [[covered wagon|prairie schooner]] and brought back a blonde woman to their camp. Rawhide Kid came to their camp and demanded her release. Red Wolf challenged Rawhide Kid in a hand-to-hand combat, the winner would keep the woman. The Kid won the contest and left with the woman. An unhappy Red Wolf and some Apaches pursued the couple. To stop his pusuers path, Rawhide Kid successfully frightened a herd of bison by shooting in the air.<ref>[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/redwolfapache.htm Red Wolf (Apache, Rawhide Kid foe)] at marvunapp.com</ref>

In the story "Red Wolf Stalks the Stars!" published in ''Hercules'' vol.2 #2 (April 1984) written and pencilled by [[Bob Layton]], [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] met a character named Red Wolf. The character also appeared in the two following issues and his adventures took place in an alternate reality during the 24th century. This Red Wolf has no known connection to the Native American superheroes. Red Wolf is the god of the Talbosians, a race of fierce lupine-humanoids. Rojahn Smythe was an archeologist who discovered the planet Talbos and became the vessel of vengeance of the Talbosians against the Skrulls. Smythe won the ability to detect any Skrull and to change into Red Wolf.<ref>[http://comicbookdb.com/character.php?ID=13232 Red Wolf (Rojahn Smythe)] at comicbookdb.com</ref><ref>[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/redwolfherc.htm Red Wolf (Rojahn Smythe)] at marvunapp.com</ref> During a chat, it was revealed that [[Jim Shooter]] did not let his creator Bob Layton do a mini series on Red Wolf. Layton said "Red Wolf was another one of those forgotten characters I spoke about-- like Hercules. I really wanted to do something fun with that character."<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=5846 Chat Transcript: Bob Layton]</ref>

Bowen Designs created a Red Wolf Mini-Bust, sculpted by Randy Bowen.<ref>[http://www.86thfloor.com/Advance%20Order/January2009/Merchandise.htm 86th Floor Comics January 2009 Orderform Spotlight Merchandise]</ref>
