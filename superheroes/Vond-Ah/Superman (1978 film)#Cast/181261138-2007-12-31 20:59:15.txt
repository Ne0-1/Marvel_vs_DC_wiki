'''''Superman''''' (also known as ''Superman: The Movie'') is a [[1978 in film|1978]] [[superhero film]] based on the [[fictional character|fictional]] [[DC Comics]] character [[Superman]]. [[Richard Donner]] directed the film, which stars [[Christopher Reeve]] as Superman, as well as [[Gene Hackman]], [[Margot Kidder]], [[Marlon Brando]], [[Ned Beatty]], [[Valerie Perrine]], [[Glenn Ford]] and [[Jackie Cooper]]. The film depicts the origin story of the character from being infant Kal-El of [[Krypton]], and then being rocketed to [[Smallville (DC Comics)|Smallville]] by [[Jor-El]]. There he is discovered by good-natured farmers who raise him to be an honest and faithful teenager, an aspect that will help him in future years. In his wake, he fulfills his destiny at the [[Fortress of Solitude]], discovering his past and knowing what he specifically is to do on Earth. He takes up the guise of [[nerd|mild mannered]] reporter [[Clark Kent]] and falls in love with fellow reporter [[Lois Lane]], though to make conflicts even more is the villainous [[Lex Luthor]], who sets a dire plot that will ultimately face consequences for The Last Son of Krypton.

The film was initially conceived as far back as 1973 by [[Alexander Salkind]], his son [[Ilya Salkind|Ilya]] and fellow partner [[Pierre Spengler]]. The project went through various directors and scripts by [[Mario Puzo]], [[David Newman]] and wife [[Leslie Newman|Leslie]], and [[Robert Benton]] before given the directorial job to Donner. Donner in turn, brought in [[Tom Mankiewicz]] to make changes as a means to what he calls, "respect the character, not do a straight face [[parody]]." Due to Puzo's original 500 plus page script, it was decided to shoot ''Superman'' and ''Superman II'' simultaneously. Locations during the shoot included [[Shepperton Studios]], [[Canada]], [[New York City]] and [[New Mexico]]. Due to the film's excessive budget, tensions rose between Donner and the Salkinds, to which it was decided to finish filming ''Superman'' while ''Superman II'' was already 80% finished. This would eventually give birth to ''[[Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut]]''. 

''Superman'' was released to positive reviews and a box office success. Some critics found analogies similar to [[Jesus]], which Mankiewicz claims were set purposely as he himself finds the character to be a symbol of Christ. It was this film that sparked and inspired the birth of [[comic book movies]].

==Plot==
On the planet [[Krypton]], the Council sentences three insurrectionists, [[General Zod]], [[Ursa]] and [[Non]], to isolation in the [[Phantom Zone]]. Later, believing that the planet will shortly explode, [[Jor-El]] launches a spacecraft containing his infant son, [[Kal-El]] towards Earth, a distant planet with a suitable atmosphere, and where his dense molecular structure will give him superhuman powers. Moments after launch, Jor-El's prediction comes true: Krypton is destroyed. 

The ship crashes in an American farming town, [[Smallville (DC Comics)|Smallville]], where little Kal-El is found by [[Jonathan Kent|Jonathan]] and wife [[Martha Kent]] and raised as their own son, Clark. Eighteen Earth years later, when Clark learns the truth about his heritage, he leaves the homestead and heads to the Arctic, where a vision of Jor-El appears before him, explaining his responsibilities on his adoptive planet. More years pass, and Clark Kent finds a job at the ''[[Daily Planet]]'' in [[Metropolis]], where he meets and develops a crush upon fellow reporter [[Lois Lane]], whom he later rescues from a helicopter accident after switching his street clothes and glasses for a costume bearing his father's symbol. 

Later, he visits her at home, takes her for a flight over the city and allows her to interview him for a newspaper article in which she names him 'Superman.' Meanwhile, criminal genius [[Lex Luthor]] diverts two nuclear rockets from a missile testing site, one to [[Hackensack, New Jersey]], the other to the [[San Andreas fault|San Andreas fault line]]. The latter, he hopes will knock California into the sea, increasing the value of his real estate on what would become the new West Coast. To stop Superman from preventing the disaster, Luthor lures him to his underground hideaway, where he exposes him to [[Kryptonite]], the only substance known to cause him harm. 

Superman escapes, in time to prevent the first impact but too late to stop the second; the missile explodes, and as a consequence, Lois Lane is killed. Unable to cope with her death, Superman ignores his father's warning not to interfere with human history, and spins the world back to its axis, effectively turning back the clock, ans saving the woman he loves. While Lois is left to ponder why Clark Kent is never around when Superman shows up, Superman delivers Lex Luthor to his new home: prison.

==Production==
===Development===
[[Ilya Salkind]] had conceived the idea of the film as far back as 1974 and presented the concept to his father [[Alexander Salkind]] and [[Pierre Spengler]]. Although Ilya openly states it was his idea, he claims that the film would never happen if it hadn't been his father's ability to persuade financiers to provide the money, Ilya calling his father "a financial Wizard." Salkind also felt they should produce and film ''Superman'' and ''[[Superman II]]'' simultaneously, a previous (and what he believed to be successful) attempt they made on ''[[The Three Musketeers (1973 film)|The Three Musketeers]]'' and ''[[The Four Musketeers (film)|The Four Musketeers]]''. In addition Ilya felt not to do a straight face [[parody]] of the character, calling the style of the film to be "fictional reality." Securing the film rights from [[DC Comics]] was an unbearable experience for the Salkinds and Spengler, whom Spengler had to spend two weeks in meeting with the company specifically on a "Integrity of the character" clause. However, the producers did make sure DC approve over every aspect of the film (including dialouge).<ref name=ilyandpierre>{{cite video | title = Superman (1978) Audio Commentary by Producers [[Ilya Salkind]] and [[Pierre Spengler]]  | format = DVD | publisher = [[Warner Brothers]] | year = 2006}}</ref>

With the film rights set in stone, [[William Goldman]] was approached to write the script though Ilya personally cited creative differences with the writer. [[Mario Puzo]] was then hired after the producers were impressed with his work on ''[[The Godfather (film)|The Godfather]]'', and Alexander approved over "his famous credibility." As Puzo wrote the script, the search for a director took place. [[Steven Spielberg]] expressed high interest and Salkind felt comfortable in hiring him to direct upon being impressed with his work on ''[[Duel (film)|Duel]]'' and ''[[The Sugarland Express]]''. Ilya personally predicted his future filmmaking success and approached Alexander to hire Spielberg. Alexander was skeptical, feeling that Spielberg wasn't famous enough and claimed they needed to wait until "that [[Jaws (film)|fish movie]] of his" was released. ''Jaws'' was released with unanimous success, though by this time it was far too late as Spielberg opted to do ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' instead.<ref name=ilyandpierre/>

[[Peter Yates]] was interested in directing and was involved in negotiations though for unknown reasons the deal collapsed. Both [[William Friedkin]] and [[Sam Peckinpah]] were offered the chance to direct. Friedkin turned down the offer outright while Peckinpah dropped out of the running when he produced a gun during a meeting with Ilya. [[Guy Hamilton]], [[George Lucas]], [[John Guillermin]] and [[Ronald Neame]] were then considered though Lucas was dropped as Ilya found out he was too committed on ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]''. It was decided to go with Hamilton as Ilya was impressed with his work on ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'' and ''[[Battle of Britain (film)|Battle of Britain]]''.<ref name=ilyandpierre/>

Ilya originally recommended Puzo to write the script as a serious science fiction epic. Although Puzo did impress Ilya with certain aspects, Ilya felt the script remained intact with being overall [[campy]], as did Hamilton. In addition they cited too much "[[Greek tragedy]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearean]]" elements. A fourth villain sentenced to the [[Phantom Zone]] named Zak-Ur appeared as a comedic henchman. Hamilton and Ilya brought in [[David Newman]] and [[Robert Benton]] to rewrite Puzo's draft as a means to delete objectionable material concerning an excessive amount of comedic scenes. Although Ilya does admit an infamous scene written (featuring [[Telly Savalas]] in ''[[Kojak]]'' appearance interacting with Superman), he does openly support their rewrite, claiming "not that much had changed [between the finished film]." [[Leslie Newman]] was brought in once Benton left to direct ''[[The Late Show]]''.<ref name=ilyandpierre/>

By this time sets were being initiated in [[Rome, Italy]] as well as having flying tests being experimented. However, Brando couldn't arrive in Rome as there was still a warrant out for his arrest in ''[[Last Tango in Paris]]'' due to "sexual obscenity." It was decided to move the production to [[England]] but Hamilton himself was a tax exile from his native country, which only allowed him to spend no more than 30 a year. Hamilton was forced to drop out because of Brando's actions and by this time six million dollars had already been spent on the production. [[Mark Robson]] was then in negotiations to direct after Ilya was impressed with his work on ''[[Earthquake (film)|Earthquake]]''. However, after viewing [[Richard Donner]]'s ''[[The Omen]]'' it was decided otherwise.<ref name=ilyandpierre/>

Donner read the script but thought there was too many comedic aspects. Fellow friend [[Tom Mankiewicz]] was then brought in and sets started to be constructed at [[Shepperton Studios]] for [[Marlon Brando]]'s filming dates that would happen in less than three months. Meanwhile [[James Caan]] was considered to portray [[Superman]] while [[Neil Diamond]] expressed heavy interest, but was ignored. [[James Brolin]], [[Lyle Waggoner]] and [[Perry King]] were looked at as well though nothing happened beyond that. Casting director Lynn Stalmaster	was then brought in to help out on the complicated situation. It was then agreed between Ilya, Donner and Stalmaster that the only actor suitable for the role would have to be an unknown. [[Christopher Walken]] (then unknown at the time) auditioned for the role as did dozens of other actors, including [[Christopher Reeve]]. Reeve was ignored as the three felt him too be too skinny and too young. The casting notice became so desperate, that the dentist of Ilya's then wife at the time was screen tested as the filmmakers felt he had an uncanny resemblance to Superman. Stalmaster still felt Reeve would be the best choice and convinced Donner and Ilya to have him audition once again. Reeve surprised everyone with his performance.<ref name=ilyandpierre/>

===Principal photography===
''Superman'' started filming on March 24, 1977. It was shot simultaneously with ''[[Superman II]]'', including eleven different units on location. The scenes of [[Krypton]] were shot at both [[Pinewood Studios|Pinewood]] and [[Shepperton Studios]]. [[Smallville (DC Comics)|Smallville]] was shot on location in [[High River]], [[Alberta]] while [[Metropolis]] was filmed in [[Calgary, Alberta]]. For scenes involving the ''[[Daily Planet]]'', ''[[The New York Daily News]]'' was put in its place.<ref name=legend>{{cite video | title = Making Superman: Filming The Legend | format = DVD | publisher = [[Warner Brothers]] | year = 2001}}</ref> Filming was to remain very secretive as [[Christopher Reeve]] would have to literally walk in a bathrobe between shots as a means to not reveal the Superman suit to magazine spies/photographers. During the stressful shoot, tensions rose between the Salkinds and Donner as the two were barely speaking. Salkind blamed it was the fact they were constantly over budget, behind schedule and lack of a [[teaser trailer]].<ref name=ilyandpierre/> 

[[Tom Mankiewicz]] claims that Donner was never given a budget or a schedule, and was constantly told by The Salkinds that he was either over budget or behind schedule. [[Warner Brothers]] would eventually stepp up and provided more money for the film. [[Richard Lester]], who directed the Salkind's previous films ''[[The Three Musketeers (1973 film)|The Three Musketeers]]'' and its sequel ''[[The Four Musketeers (film)|The Four Musketeers]]'', was brought in as an uncredited producer, setting a balance between Donner and the Salkinds who were barely speaking. Mankiewicz claims the Salkinds brought in Lester because they were either waiting for Donner to quit, or having Donner go so over budget, that he would be fired. Lester refused to be credited and went uncredited for his work. Although Donner and Lester got along great, it was Lester who came up with the idea to stop filming ''Superman II'' and instead focus on finishing ''Superman''. By this time 80% of ''II'' was finished; that included every scene featuring [[Marlon Brando]] and [[Gene Hackman]], as it would be impossible bringing back the two high profiled actors. This would eventually spark the birth of ''[[Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut]]''. The remaining 20% of ''Superman II'' would be finalized provided if ''Superman'' were a success.<ref name=ilyandpierre/>

''Superman'' is well-known for its large-scale special effects sequences, all of which were created without the benefit of [[computer-generated imagery]]. The sets of [[Krypton]] were built at [[Pinewood Studios]] with the "Kryptonian Council Dome" being designed as a miniature. The [[Golden Gate Bridge]] miniature stood 70 feet long, and 20 feet wide. During the construction of the scene involving the [[Hoover Dam]], a miniature was built and as an affect to simulate the vast amount of water, slow motion (an over-cranked camera) was put in process. The [[Fortress of Solitude]] was a full-scale set, though some scenes required matte paintings. The Destruction of Krypton was also filmed on a full-scale set, though would eventually be crushed to pieces. Young Clark Kent's long-distance football punt was executed courtesy of a cannon placed in the ground. Discarded footage exists of Superman literally flying in lava during the earthquake scene though for unknown reasons it didn't appear in either of the original release or [[Richard Donner]]'s director's cut.<ref name=magic>{{cite video | title = The Magic Behind The Cape | format = DVD | publisher = [[Warner Brothers]] | year = 2001}}</ref>

Of all the visual effects, the flying sequences were the hardest. The first test involved simply catapulting a dummy out of a cannon. Another technique was to have a remote control cast of the character flying around. Both were discarded due to lack of movement. High quality, realistic-looking animation was tried, with animated speed trails added to make the effect more convincing. Finally, a technique was developed that combined front projection with specially designed zoom lenses. The illusion of movement was created by zooming in on [[Christopher Reeve]] while making the front projected image appear to recede. For scenes where Superman has to interact with other people or objects while in flight, Reeve and fellow actors were put in a variety of rigging equipment with careful lighting and photography to hide the equipment. The Superman costume was originally a much darker blue, but had to change to a more turquoise color in order to composite better with the [[Chroma key|blue screen]].<ref name=magic/>

===Music===
[[Richard Donner]] originally had in mind for [[Jerry Goldsmith]] to compose the music for the film as the two had worked together on ''[[The Omen]]''. Goldsmith was set to work on the film but backed out due to scheduling conflicts. However, pieces of Goldsmith's musical notes for ''[[Capricorn One]]'' coincidentally found its way into the [[teaser trailer]] of this film, and years later, Goldsmith would find himself writing the film score for ''[[Supergirl (film)|Supergirl]]''. It was decided to hire [[John Williams]] as the filmmakers were impressed with his work on ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]''. Salkind also felt comfortable in hiring Williams as he felt "he could bring a 'bigger-than-life' feeling [for the film]" in comparison to ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''. In the scene whereas Lois Lane and Superman are flying through the [[New York City]] atmosphere, it was originally intended for [[Margot Kidder]] to sing the words rather than narrating. Lyrics were written by [[Leslie Bricusse]] though the idea was ultimately dropped.<ref name=ilyandpierre/>

Many publicity stills were released well ahead of the film itself, some of which were related directly to scenes in the film.

===Advertising===
The Salkinds tried a bold approach went it came to marketing. Up from 1974 to 1978 every years at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] they would have airplanes and jets fly by the location interpreting the cast and crew involved. A "laster show" at the [[Hudson River]] was also put into place and even showcased itself in the [[New York City]] atmosphere at night time, which [[Ilya Salkind]] personally found to be quite successful. Most critics found the publicity to be the most outrageous ever since ''[[Gone With the Wind (film)|Gone With the Wind]]''.<ref name=ilyandpierre/>

===Reaction===
''Superman'' opened on [[December 15]], [[1978 in film|1978]] in the [[United States]] in 806 theaters, accumulating $7,465,343 over its opening weekend.
