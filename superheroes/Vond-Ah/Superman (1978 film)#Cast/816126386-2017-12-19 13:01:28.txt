'''''Superman''''' (informally titled '''''Superman: The Movie''''' in some listings and reference sources) is a 1978 <!-- Please do not add British-American per WP:FILMLEAD. --> [[superhero film]] directed by [[Richard Donner]] and based on the [[DC Comics]] [[Superman|character of the same name]]. The film is a British, Swiss, Panamanian and American joint venture,<ref name=AFI /> produced by [[Warner Bros.]], Film Export A.G., Dovemead Limited and International Film Productions. ''Superman'' features an [[ensemble cast]] of [[Marlon Brando]], [[Gene Hackman]], [[Christopher Reeve]], [[Jeff East]], [[Margot Kidder]], [[Glenn Ford]], [[Phyllis Thaxter]], [[Jackie Cooper]], [[Trevor Howard]], [[Marc McClure]], [[Terence Stamp]], [[Valerie Perrine]], [[Ned Beatty]], [[Jack O'Halloran]], [[Maria Schell]], and [[Sarah Douglas (actress)|Sarah Douglas]]. The film depicts [[origin of Superman|Superman's origin]], including his infancy as Kal-El of [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]] and his youthful years in the rural town of [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]]. Disguised as reporter [[Clark Kent]], he adopts a mild-mannered disposition in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] and develops a romance with [[Lois Lane]], while battling the villainous [[Lex Luthor]].

Several directors, most notably [[Guy Hamilton]], and screenwriters ([[Mario Puzo]], [[David Newman (filmmaker)|David]] and [[Leslie Newman]], and [[Robert Benton]]), were associated with the project before Richard Donner was hired to direct. [[Tom Mankiewicz]] was drafted in to rewrite the script and was given a "[[creative consultant]]" credit. It was decided to film both ''Superman'' and its sequel ''[[Superman II]]'' (1980) simultaneously, with [[principal photography]] beginning in March 1977 and ending in October 1978. Tensions arose between Donner and the producers, and a decision was made to stop filming the sequel, of which 75 percent had already been completed, and finish the first film.<ref>{{Cite web|first=Peter |last=Tonguette |url=http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/36/lester1.html |title=Bright Lights Film Journal :: The Superman Films of Richard Lester |publisher=Brightlightsfilm.com |accessdate=June 17, 2010}}</ref>

The most expensive film made up to that point with a budget of $55 million, ''Superman'' was released in December 1978 to critical and financial success; its worldwide box-office earnings of $300 million made it the second-highest-grossing release of the year. Reviewers particularly praised Reeve's performance.<ref name=comment/> It was nominated for three [[Academy Award]]s, including [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Music (Original Score)]], and [[Academy Award for Best Sound|Best Sound Mixing]], and received a [[Special Achievement Academy Award]] for [[Visual Effects]].<ref>[http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1448874964259 "Superman (1978) - Awards and Nominations"]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''AwardsDatabase.oscars.org'', Retrieved November 30, 2015</ref> Groundbreaking in its use of [[special effect]]s and science fiction/fantasy storytelling, the film's legacy presaged the mainstream popularity of Hollywood's [[superhero film]] franchises. In 2017, ''Superman'' was inducted into the [[Library of Congress]]' [[National Film Registry]].

==Plot==
<!--per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plots are between 400 and 700 words only-->
On the planet [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]], using evidence provided to the Council by scientist [[Jor-El]], the attempted insurrectionists [[General Zod]], [[Ursa (comics)|Ursa]], and [[Non (comics)|Non]] are sentenced to the [[Phantom Zone]]. For this, Zod swears revenge on Jor-El and his family. Jor-El, despite his eminence, is unable to convince the Council that Krypton will soon be destroyed when its [[red supergiant]] sun goes [[supernova]]. To save his infant son, [[Superman|Kal-El]], Jor-El launches him in a spaceship to Earth, a planet with a suitable atmosphere where Kal-El's dense molecular structure will give him superhuman powers. Shortly after the launch, Krypton's sun explodes, destroying the planet.

The ship crash lands on Earth near [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]], [[Kansas]]. Kal-El, who is now three years old, is found by [[Jonathan and Martha Kent]], who are astonished when he lifts their truck. They take him to their farm and raise him as their own, naming him [[Clark Kent|Clark]] after Martha's maiden name.

At 18, soon after Jonathan's death from a [[heart attack]], Clark hears a psychic "call" and discovers a glowing crystal in the remains of his spacecraft. It compels him to travel to the [[Arctic]], where it builds the [[Fortress of Solitude]]. Inside, a hologram of Jor-El explains Clark's origins, and after 12 further years of educating him on his powers and responsibilities, he leaves the Fortress wearing a blue and red suit with the [[Superman logo|House of El family crest]] on his chest and becomes a reporter at the ''[[Daily Planet]]'' in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]. He meets and develops an unrequited [[Relationship of Clark Kent and Lois Lane|romantic attraction]] to co-worker [[Lois Lane]].

Lois becomes involved in a helicopter accident where conventional means of rescue are impossible, requiring Clark to use his powers in public for the first time to save her, and goes on to thwart a jewel thief attempting to scale [[Solow Building|a building]] using suction cups, captures robbers fleeing police on [[Fulton Market|the river]] by depositing their boat at [[Wall Street|the police station]], rescues a girl's cat from a tree in [[Brooklyn Heights|her neighborhood]], and saves [[Air Force One]] after a lightning strike destroys the port outboard engine, making the "caped wonder" an instant celebrity. He visits Lois at her home the next night and takes her for a flight over the city, allowing her to interview him for an article in which she names him "Superman".

Meanwhile, criminal genius [[Lex Luthor]] plans to make a fortune in real estate by buying large amounts of barren desert land, then using a nuclear explosion on a weak point in the [[San Andreas Fault]], sinking California and leaving Luthor's desert as the new [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], greatly increasing its value. Upon learning the [[U.S Army]] and [[U.S. Navy]] will launch a twin nuclear missile test, he diverts one missile to the weak spot, after his incompetent henchman Otis accidentally redirects the first missile to the wrong place.

Knowing Superman could stop his plan, Luthor lures him to an underground lair, reveals his plan and exposes him to [[Kryptonite]]. As Superman weakens, Luthor further taunts him by revealing the first missile is headed toward [[Hackensack, New Jersey]], as even Superman cannot stop both impacts. Eve Teschmacher, Luthor's accomplice, is horrified because her mother lives in Hackensack, but Luthor does not care and leaves Superman to a slow death. Knowing his reputation for keeping his word, Teschmacher rescues Superman on the condition he will deal with the New Jersey missile first. After Superman diverts the missile into outer space, the other one explodes near the San Andreas Fault. He mitigates the effects of the explosion, getting rid of the fallout and shoring up the crumbling Earth, but the aftershocks damage the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] and cause the [[Hollywood Sign]] and the [[Hoover Dam]] to collapse, endangering lives.

While Superman is busy saving others, Lois's car ends up falling into a crevice that opens from one of the aftershocks. It fills with dirt and debris and she suffocates to death. Angered at being unable to save her, Superman defies Jor-El's earlier warning not to manipulate human history, preferring to heed Jonathan's advice that he must be here for "a reason". He accelerates around Earth, rewinding time, to save Lois. After bringing Luthor and Otis to prison, he flies into the sunrise for further adventures.

==Cast==
* [[Marlon Brando]] as [[Jor-El]]: Superman's biological father on [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]]. He has a theory about the planet exploding, yet the Council refuses to listen. He dies as the planet explodes but successfully sends his infant son to Earth as a means to help the innocent. Brando sued the Salkinds and Warner Bros. for $50&nbsp;million because he felt cheated out of his share of the box office profits.<ref name=Kroll/> This stopped Brando's footage from being used in Richard Lester's version of ''Superman II''.<ref name=DVD/>
* [[Gene Hackman]] as [[Lex Luthor]]: A scientific genius and businessman who is Superman's nemesis. It is he who discovers Superman's weakness and hatches a plan that puts millions of people in danger.
* [[Christopher Reeve]] as [[Clark Kent]]/[[Superman]]: Born on Krypton as Kal-El and raised on Earth, he is a being of immense power, strength and invulnerability who, after realizing his destiny to serve mankind, uses his powers to protect and save others. As a means to protect his identity, he works in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] at the ''[[Daily Planet]]'' as mild-mannered newspaper reporter Clark Kent and changes his clothes into a red-blue red caped suit with an S shield on its chest and known for his dubbing as "Superman" by Lois. Reeve was picked from over 200 actors who auditioned for the role.
** [[Jeff East]] as the teenage [[Clark Kent]]: As a teenager, he is forced to hide his superhuman abilities, making him unpopular among his classmates and frustrating his efforts to gain the attention of classmate [[Lana Lang]] (Diane Sherry). Following the death of his adoptive father, he travels to the Arctic to discover his Kryptonian heritage. East's dialogue in the film is redubbed by Christopher Reeve for the final cut.<ref name=East/>
* [[Ned Beatty]] as Otis: Lex Luthor's bumbling henchman.
* [[Jackie Cooper]] as [[Perry White]]: Clark Kent's hot-tempered boss at the ''Daily Planet''. He assigns Lois to uncover the news of an unknown businessman purchasing a large amount of property in California. [[Keenan Wynn]] was originally cast, but dropped out shortly before filming because of [[heart disease]]. Cooper, who originally auditioned for Otis, was subsequently cast.<ref name=Ilya/>
* [[Glenn Ford]] as [[Jonathan and Martha Kent|Jonathan Kent]]: Clark Kent's adoptive father in Smallville during his youth. He is a farmer who teaches Clark skills that will help him in the future. He later suffers a fatal heart attack that changes Clark's outlook on his duty to others.
* [[Trevor Howard]] as the First Elder: Head of the Kryptonian Council, who does not believe Jor-El's claim that Krypton is doomed. He threatens Jor-El, "Any attempt by you to create a climate of fear and panic amongst the populace must be deemed by us an act of insurrection."
* [[Margot Kidder]] as [[Lois Lane]]: A reporter at the ''[[Daily Planet]]'', who becomes a romantic interest to Clark Kent. The producers and director had a very specific concept for Lois: liberated, hard-nosed, witty and attractive. Kidder was cast because her performance had a certain spark and vitality, and because of her strong interaction with Christopher Reeve.<ref>{{cite book|last=Petrou|first=David Michael|title =The Making of Superman the Movie|publisher=[[Warner Books]]|year=1978|isbn=0352304529|pages=47, 81}}</ref> Over 100 actresses were considered for the role. Margot Kidder (suggested by Stalmaster), [[Anne Archer]], [[Susan Blakely]], [[Lesley Ann Warren]], [[Deborah Raffin]] and [[Stockard Channing]] screen tested from March through May 1977. The final decision was between Channing and Kidder, with the latter winning the role.<ref name=flight/><ref name=screen/>
* [[Jack O'Halloran]] as [[Non (comics)|Non]]: Large and mute, the third of the Kryptonian villains who are sentenced to be isolated in the Phantom Zone.
* [[Valerie Perrine]] as Eve Teschmacher: Lex Luthor's girlfriend and accomplice. Already cynical of his increasing grandiosity and disturbed by his cruelty, she saves Superman's life after learning that Luthor has launched a nuclear missile toward her mother's hometown of [[Hackensack, New Jersey]]. She shows a romantic interest in Superman, implied by her fixing her hair before she makes her presence known to him, and then by kissing him before she saves his life.
* [[Maria Schell]] as Vond-Ah: Like Jor-El, a top Kryptonian scientist; but she too is not swayed by Jor-El's theories.
* [[Terence Stamp]] as [[General Zod]]: Evil leader of the three Kryptonian criminals who swears vengeance against Jor-El when he is sentenced to the [[Phantom Zone]].
* [[Phyllis Thaxter]] as [[Jonathan and Martha Kent|Martha Kent]] (née Clark): Clark Kent's faithful adoptive mother. A kindly woman who dotes on her adoptive son and is fiercely devoted to her husband, Jonathan. She is her son's emotional support after Clark is devastated by Jonathan's death. Thaxter was producer [[Ilya Salkind]]'s mother-in-law.<ref name=saga/>
* [[Susannah York]] as [[Lara (comics)|Lara]]: Superman's biological mother on Krypton. She, after learning of Krypton's fate, has apprehensions about sending her infant son to a strange planet alone.
* [[Marc McClure]] as [[Jimmy Olsen]]: A teenage photographer at the ''Daily Planet''. Jeff East, who portrayed the teenage Clark Kent, originally auditioned for this role, but outranked following his portrayal of the teen Clark.<ref name=East/>
* [[Sarah Douglas (actress)|Sarah Douglas]] as [[Ursa (comics)|Ursa]]: General Zod's second in command and consort, sentenced to the Phantom Zone for her unethical scientific experiments.
* [[Harry Andrews]] as the Second Elder: Council member, who urges Jor-El to be reasonable about plans to save Krypton.

[[Kirk Alyn]] and [[Noel Neill]] have [[cameo appearance]]s as Lois Lane's father and mother in a deleted scene that was restored in later home media releases.<ref>https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-kirk-alyn-1083768.html Obituary: Kirk Alyn</ref> Alyn and Neill portrayed Superman and Lois Lane in the film serials ''[[Superman (serial)|Superman]]'' (1948) and ''[[Atom Man vs. Superman]]'' (1950), and were the first actors to portray the characters onscreen in a live-action format. Neill reprised her role in the 1950s ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]'' TV series, and also appeared as Lex Luthor's elderly wife in the opening scene of the film ''[[Superman Returns]]'' (2006).

[[Larry Hagman]] and [[Rex Reed]] also make cameos; Hagman plays an army major in charge of a convoy that is transporting one of the missiles, and Reed plays himself as he meets Lois and Clark outside the ''Daily Planet'' headquarters.

==Production==

===Development===
[[Ilya Salkind]] had first conceived the idea for a Superman film in late 1973.<ref name=one>{{Cite news| author = Barry Freiman | url = http://www.supermanhomepage.com/movies/movies.php?topic=interview-salkind | title = One-on-One Interview with Producer Ilya Salkind | work = Superman Homepage | date = February 2006 | accessdate = September 9, 2008}}</ref> In November 1974, after a long, difficult process with [[DC Comics]], the Superman [[film rights]] were purchased by Ilya, his father [[Alexander Salkind]], and their partner [[Pierre Spengler]]. DC wanted a list of actors that were to be considered for Superman, and approved the producer's choices of [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Al Pacino]], [[James Caan]], [[Steve McQueen]], [[Clint Eastwood]] and [[Dustin Hoffman]].<ref name=saga>Richard Donner, [[Tom Mankiewicz]], Ilya Salkind, [[Pierre Spengler]], [[David Prowse]], ''You Will Believe: The Cinematic Saga of Superman'', 2006, [[Warner Home Video]]</ref> The filmmakers felt it was best to film ''Superman'' and ''[[Superman II]]'' [[Back to back film production|back-to-back]], simultaneously, and to make a [[negative pickup deal]] with [[Warner Bros.]]<ref name=flight>Richard Donner, [[Tom Mankiewicz]], Christopher Reeve, Margot Kidder, Lynn Stalmaster, [[Marc McClure]], Taking Flight: The Development of ''Superman'', 2001, [[Warner Home Video]]</ref> [[William Goldman]] was approached to write the screenplay, while [[Leigh Brackett]] was considered. Ilya hired [[Alfred Bester]], who began writing a [[film treatment]]. Alexander felt, however, that Bester was not famous enough, so he hired [[Mario Puzo]] (''[[The Godfather]]'') to write the screenplay at a $600,000 salary.<ref name=life>{{Cite book| author=[[Julius Schwartz]]; Brian M. Thomsen | title =Man of Two Worlds: My Life In Science Fiction and Comics | publisher =[[HarperCollins]] | year =2000 | location = New York City| pages = 135–142| isbn = 0-380-81051-4| chapter = B.O.}}</ref><ref name=market/> [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[William Friedkin]], [[Richard Lester]], [[Peter Yates]], [[John Guillermin]], [[Ronald Neame]] and [[Sam Peckinpah]] were in negotiations to direct. Peckinpah dropped out when he produced a gun during a meeting with Ilya. [[George Lucas]] turned down the offer because of his commitment to ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''.<ref name=Ilya/><ref name=one/>

Ilya wanted to hire [[Steven Spielberg]] to direct, but Alexander was skeptical, feeling it was best to "wait until [Spielberg's] big fish opens." ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' was very successful, prompting the producers to offer Spielberg the position, but by then Spielberg had already committed to ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]''.<ref name="one" /> [[Guy Hamilton]] was hired as director, while Puzo delivered his 500-page script for ''Superman'' and ''Superman II'' in July 1975.<ref name="flight" /> [[Jax-Ur]] appeared as one of [[General Zod]]'s [[henchman|henchmen]], with Clark Kent written as a television reporter. Dustin Hoffman, who was previously considered for Superman, turned down [[Lex Luthor]].<ref name="saga" /><ref name="life" />

In early 1975, Brando signed on as Jor-El with a salary of $3.7&nbsp;million and 11.75% of the box office gross profits, totaling $19&nbsp;million. He horrified Salkind by proposing in their first meeting that Jor-El appear as a green [[suitcase]] or a [[bagel]] with Brando's voice, but Donner used flattery to persuade the actor to portray Jor-El himself.<ref name="one" /> Brando hoped to use some of his salary for a proposed 13-part ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]''-style [[miniseries]] on [[Native Americans in the United States]].<ref>{{Cite book| author= Peter Manso| title = Brando the Biography | publisher =[[Hyperion (publisher)|Hyperion]] |date=November 1995 | location = | isbn = 0-7868-8128-3 | chapter = The Way It's Never Been Done Before}}</ref> Brando had it in his contract to complete all of his scenes in 12 days. He also refused to memorize his dialogue, so [[cue card]]s were compiled across the set. Fellow [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Oscar winner]] Hackman was cast as Lex Luthor days later. The filmmakers made it a priority to shoot all of Brando's and Hackman's footage "because they would be committed to other films immediately."<ref name="flight" /><ref name="one" /> Though the Salkinds felt that Puzo had written a solid story for the two-part film, they deemed his scripts too long and so hired [[Robert Benton]] and [[David Newman (filmmaker)|David Newman]] for rewrite work. Benton became too busy directing ''[[The Late Show (film)|The Late Show]]'', so David's wife [[Leslie Newman|Leslie]] was brought in to help her husband finish writing duties.<ref name="Ilya" /> [[George MacDonald Fraser]] was later hired to do some work on the script, but he says he did little.<ref name="fraser">George MacDonald Fraser, ''The Light's on at Signpost'', HarperCollins 2002 p55-65</ref>

Their script was submitted in July 1976,<ref name="flight" /> and carried a [[camp (style)|camp]] tone, including a [[cameo appearance]] by [[Telly Savalas]] as his ''[[Kojak]]'' character. The scripts for ''Superman'' and ''Superman II'' were now at over 400 pages combined.<ref name="Kroll">{{Cite news| author = Jack Kroll | title = ''Superman'' to the Rescue | work = [[Newsweek]] | date = January 1, 1979 | pages = 34–41 | accessdate = September 8, 2008}}</ref><ref name="Dick">{{Cite news| author = Daniel Dickholtz | title = Steel Dreams: Interview with Tom Mankiewicz | work = [[Starlog]] | date = December 16, 1998 | pages = 67–71 | accessdate = September 1, 2008}}</ref> Pre-production started at [[Cinecittà]] Studios in Rome, with sets starting construction and flying tests being unsuccessfully experimented. "In Italy," producer Ilya Salkind remembered, "we lost about $2&nbsp;million [on flying tests]."<ref name="one" /> Marlon Brando found out he could not film in Italy because of a warrant out for his arrest: a sexual-obscenity charge from ''[[Last Tango in Paris]]''. Production moved to England in late 1976, but Hamilton could not join because he was a [[tax exile]].<ref name="Dick" />

[[Mark Robson]] was strongly considered and was in talks to direct, but after seeing ''[[The Omen]]'', the producers hired [[Richard Donner]]. Donner had previously been planning ''[[Damien: Omen II]]'' when he was hired in January 1977 for $1&nbsp;million to direct ''Superman'' and ''Superman II''.<ref name="Hughes" /> Donner felt it was best to start from scratch. "They had prepared the picture for a year and not one bit was useful to me."<ref name="Hughes">{{Cite book| author=David Hughes | title =Comic Book Movies | publisher =[[Virgin Books]] | year =2003 | location = | pages = 5–23 | isbn = 0-7535-0767-6| chapter = Superman: The Movie}}</ref> Donner was dissatisfied with the campy script and brought in [[Tom Mankiewicz]] to perform a rewrite. According to Mankiewicz "not a word from the Puzo script was used."<ref name="Dick" /> "It was a well-written, but still a ridiculous script. It was 550 pages. I said, 'You can't shoot this screenplay because you'll be shooting for five years'," Donner continued. "That was literally a [[shooting script]] and they planned to shoot all 550 pages. You know, 110 pages is plenty for a script, so even for two features, that was way too much."<ref name="cine">{{Cite news| author = Don Shay | title = Richard Donner on ''Superman'' | work = [[Cinefantastique]] | date = Summer 1979 | pages = 26–36 | accessdate = September 7, 2008}}</ref> Mankiewicz conceived having each Kryptonian family wear a [[crest (heraldry)|crest]] resembling a different letter, justifying the 'S' on Superman's costume.<ref name="Hughes" /> The [[Writers Guild of America]] refused to credit Mankiewicz for his rewrites, so Donner gave him a [[creative consultant]] credit, much to the annoyance of the Guild.<ref name="Hughes" />

====Casting of Superman====
It was initially decided to first sign an [[A-list]] actor for Superman before Richard Donner was hired as director. [[Robert Redford]] was offered a large sum, but felt he was too famous. [[Burt Reynolds]] also turned down the role, while [[Sylvester Stallone]] was interested, but nothing ever came of it. [[Paul Newman]] was offered his choice of roles as Superman, Lex Luthor or Jor-El for $4&nbsp;million, turning down all three roles.<ref name="Ilya" />

When it was next decided to cast an unknown actor, [[Casting (performing arts)|casting director]] Lynn Stalmaster first suggested [[Christopher Reeve]], but Donner and the producers felt he was too young and skinny.<ref name=flight/> Over 200 unknown actors auditioned for Superman.<ref>{{cite news | author = Peter Coutros | title = Young Actor to Play in Super Role | work = [[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]] | date = February 24, 1977 | accessdate = }}</ref>

Olympic champion [[Caitlyn Jenner|Bruce Jenner]] had auditioned for the title role.<ref name="Ilya" /> [[Patrick Wayne]] was cast, but dropped out when his father [[John Wayne]] was diagnosed with stomach cancer.<ref name="Hughes" />

Both [[Neil Diamond]] and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] lobbied hard for the role, but were ignored. [[James Caan]], [[James Brolin]], [[Lyle Waggoner]], [[Christopher Walken]], [[Nick Nolte]], [[Jon Voight]], and [[Perry King]] were approached.<ref name="Ilya" /><ref name="one" /> [[Kris Kristofferson]] and [[Charles Bronson]] were also considered for the title role.<ref>2001 introduction to Turner Classic Movies broadcast of ''Superman'' by Robert Osbourne, TCM</ref>

James Caan said he was offered the part but turned it down. "I just couldn't wear that suit."<ref>James Caan's career hitting tough times
Siskel, Gene. Chicago Tribune (1963–Current file) [Chicago, Ill] November 27, 1977: e6.</ref>

"We found guys with fabulous physique who couldn't act or wonderful actors who did not look remotely like Superman," creative consultant [[Tom Mankiewicz]] remembered.  The search became so desperate that producer [[Ilya Salkind]]'s wife's [[dentistry|dentist]] was [[screen test]]ed.<ref name=Ilya/><ref name=one/>

Stalmaster convinced Donner and Ilya to have Reeve screen test in February 1977. Reeve stunned the director and producers, but he was told to wear a "muscle suit" to produce the desired muscular physique. Reeve refused,<ref name=screen>Lynn Stalmaster, ''Superman'': Screen Tests, 2001, [[Warner Home Video]]</ref><ref>The Making of ''Superman: The Movie'' (television Special), 1980, Film Export, A.G.</ref> undertaking a strict [[physical exercise]] regime headed by [[David Prowse]]. Prowse had wanted to portray Superman, but was denied an audition by the filmmakers because he was not American. Prowse also auditioned for [[Non (comics)|Non]]. Reeve went from 188 to 212 pounds during pre-production and filming.<ref>{{cite book | author=[[David Prowse]] | title =Straight from the Force's Mouth | publisher =Filament Publishing |date=June 2005 | isbn = 978-0-9546531-6-3 | chapter = Chapter 25}}</ref> Reeve was paid a mere $250,000 for both ''Superman'' and ''Superman II,'' while his veteran co-stars received huge sums of money: $3.7 million for Brando and $2 million for Hackman for ''Superman I''.{{sfn|Andersen|2008|p=32}} However, Reeve felt, "'Superman' brought me many opportunities, rather than closing a door in my face."<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.supermanhomepage.com/movies/movies.php?topic=interview-aol-chrisreeve1 | title = AOL Online Chat with Christopher Reeve | work = Superman Homepage | date = May 1, 2001 | accessdate = September 10, 2008}}</ref> [[Jeff East]] portrays [[Superboy (Kal-El)|teenage Clark Kent]].

===Filming===
[[Principal photography]] began on March 28, 1977 at [[Pinewood Studios]] for Krypton scenes, budgeted as the most expensive film ever made at that point. Since ''Superman'' was being shot simultaneously with ''[[Superman II]]'', filming lasted 19 months, until October 1978. Filming was originally scheduled to last between seven and eight months, but problems arose during production. [[John Barry (set designer)|John Barry]] served as [[production designer]], while [[Stuart Craig]] and [[Norman Reynolds]] worked as [[art director]]s. [[Derek Meddings]] and [[Les Bowie]] were credited as [[visual effects supervisor]]s.

Lester was offered producing credit but refused, going uncredited for his work.<ref name="legend"/> Salkind felt that bringing a second director onto the set meant there would be someone ready in the event that Donner could not fulfill his directing duties.

''Superman'' is well known for its large-scale [[visual effects]] sequences, all of which were created before the [[computer-generated imagery|digital age]]. The [[Golden Gate Bridge]] [[scale model]] stood 70 feet long and 20 feet wide. Other miniatures included the Krypton Council Dome and the [[Hoover Dam]]. [[Slow motion]] was used to simulate the vast amount of water for the Hoover Dam destruction. The [[Fortress of Solitude]] was a combination of a full-scale set and [[matte painting]]s. [[Superboy (Kal-El)|Young Clark Kent]]'s long-distance [[Punt (gridiron football)|football punt]] was executed with a wooden football loaded into an [[air blaster]] placed in the ground. The Superman costume was to be a much darker blue, but the use of [[chroma key|blue screen]] made it [[transparency (optics)|transparent]].<ref name=magic>The Magic Behind The Cape, 2001, [[Warner Home Video]]</ref>

The first test for the flying sequences involved simply catapulting a [[crash test dummy]] out of a cannon. Another technique had a remote control cast of Superman flying around. Both were discarded due to lack of movement. High-quality, realistic-looking animation was tried, with speed trails added to make the effect more convincing.

As detailed in the ''Superman: The Movie'' DVD special effects documentary 'The Magic Behind The Cape', presented by optical effects supervisor Roy Field, in the end, three techniques were used to achieve the flying effects.

For landings and take-offs, wire flying riggings were devised and used. On location, these were suspended from tower cranes, whereas in the studio elaborate rigs were suspended from the studio ceilings. Some of the wire-flying work was quite audacious considering computer-controlled rigs were not then available—the penultimate shot where Superman flies out of the prison yard for example. Although stuntmen were used, Reeve did much of the work himself, and was suspended as high as 50&nbsp;feet in the air. Counterweights and pulleys were typically used to achieve flying movement, rather than electronic or motorized devices. The thin wires used to suspend Reeve were typically removed from the film in post-production using rotoscope techniques, although this wasn't necessary in all shots (in certain lighting conditions or when Superman is very distant in the frame, the wires were more or less imperceptible).

For stationary shots where Superman is seen flying toward or away from the camera, blue screen matte techniques were used. Reeve would be photographed suspended against a blue screen. While a special device made his cape flap to give the illusion of movement, the actor himself would remain stationary (save for banking his body). Instead, the camera would use a mixture of long zoom-ins and zoom-outs and dolly in/dolly outs to cause him to become larger or smaller in the frame. The blue background would then be photochemically removed and Reeve's isolated image would be 'inserted' into a matted area of a background plate shot. The zoom-ins or zoom-outs would give the appearance of flying away or toward the contents of the background plate. The disparity in lighting and color between the matted image and the background plate, the occasional presence of black matte lines (where the [[Matte (filmmaking)|matte area]] and the matted image—in this case, Superman—do not exactly match up), and the slightly unconvincing impression of movement achieved through the use of zoom lenses is characteristic of these shots.

Where the shot is tracking with Superman as he flies (such as in the Superman and Lois Metropolis flying sequence), front projection was used. This involved photographing the actors suspended in front of a background image dimly projected from the front onto a special screen made by 3M that would reflect light back at many times the original intensity directly into a combined camera/projector. The result was a very clear and intense photographic reproduction of both the actors and the background plate, with far less image deterioration or lighting problems than occur with rear projection.

A technique was developed that combined the [[front projection effect]] with specially designed [[zoom lens]]es.<ref name=magic/> The illusion of movement was created by zooming in on Reeve while making the front projected image appear to recede. For scenes where Superman interacts with other people or objects while in flight, Reeve and actors were put in a variety of rigging equipment with careful lighting and photography.<ref name=magic/> This also led to the creation of the [[Zoptic]] system.<ref>{{Cite news| author = Nicholas Leahy | title = How Superman flies | work = [[Starburst (magazine)|Starburst]] | date = April 1982 | pages = 16–19 | accessdate = September 5, 2008}}</ref>

The highly reflective costumes worn by the Kryptonians are made of the same 3M material used for the front projection screens and were the result of an accident during Superman flying tests. "We noticed the material lit up on its own," Donner explained. "We tore the material into tiny pieces and glued it on the costumes, designing a front projection effect for each camera. There was a little light on each camera, and it would project into a mirror, bounce out in front of the lens, hit the costume, [and] millions of little glass beads would light up and bring the image back into the camera."<ref name=Hughes/>

===Music===
[[Jerry Goldsmith]], who scored Donner's ''[[The Omen]]'', was originally set to compose ''Superman''. Portions of Goldsmith's work from ''[[Capricorn One]]'' were used in ''Superman''<nowiki/>'s teaser trailer. He dropped out over scheduling conflicts and [[John Williams]] was hired. Williams conducted the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] to record the soundtrack.<ref>[http://lso.co.uk/page/3151/LSO-and-Film-Music London Symphony Orchestra and Film Music] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930173905/http://lso.co.uk/page/3151/LSO-and-Film-Music |date=September 30, 2011 }} LSO. Retrieved June 30, 2011</ref> The music was one of the last pieces to come into place. Williams liked that the film did not take itself too seriously and that it had a theatrical camp feel to it.<ref name=Ilya>Ilya Salkind, [[Pierre Spengler]], DVD [[audio commentary]], 2006, [[Warner Home Video]]</ref> Kidder was supposed to sing "Can You Read My Mind?," the lyrics to which were written by [[Leslie Bricusse]], but Donner disliked it and changed it to a composition accompanied by a voiceover.<ref name=comment/> [[Maureen McGovern]] eventually recorded the single, "Can You Read My Mind?," in 1979, although the song did not appear on the film soundtrack.  It became a mid-chart hit on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] that year (#52), spending three weeks at number five on the U.S. Adult Contemporary chart, as well as making lesser appearances on the corresponding Canadian charts.  It was also a very minor hit on the U.S. Country chart, reaching #93.  The score earned John Williams an Academy Award nomination, but he lost to [[Giorgio Moroder]]'s score for ''[[Midnight Express (film)|Midnight Express]]''.<ref>[http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1448874611974 "51st Academy Awards - Music (Original Score)"]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''AwardsDatabase.oscars.org'', Retrieved November 30, 2015</ref>

''Superman'' is divided into three basic sections, each having a distinct theme and visual style. The first segment, set on Krypton, is meant to be typical of [[science fiction films]], but also lays the groundwork for an analogy that emerges in the relationship between Jor-El and Kal-El. The second segment, set in Smallville, is reminiscent of 1950s films, and its small-town atmosphere is meant to evoke a [[Norman Rockwell]] painting. The third (and largest) segment, set mostly in Metropolis, was an attempt to present the superhero story with as much realism as possible (what Donner called "verisimilitude"), relying on traditional cinematic drama and using only subtle humor instead of a [[camp (style)|campy]] approach.<ref name=comment>Richard Donner, [[Tom Mankiewicz]], DVD [[audio commentary]], 2001, [[Warner Home Video]]</ref>

In each of the three acts, the mythic status of Superman is enhanced by events that recall the hero's journey (or [[monomyth]]) as described by [[Joseph Campbell]]. Each act has a discernible cycle of "call" and journey. The journey is from Krypton to Earth in the first act, from Smallville to the Fortress of Solitude in the second act, and then from Metropolis to the whole world in the third act.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stucky|first=Mark|title=The Superhero's Mythic Journey: Death and the Heroic Cycle in Superman|journal=Journal of Religion and Film|year=2006|volume=10|issue=2|url=http://www.unomaha.edu/jrf/Vol10No2/Stucky_Superman.htm|accessdate=May 10, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618040335/http://www.unomaha.edu/jrf/Vol10No2/Stucky_Superman.htm|archivedate=June 18, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Many have noted the examples of apparent Christian symbolism. Donner, [[Tom Mankiewicz]] and Ilya Salkind have commented on the use of [[religious perspectives on Jesus|Christian references]] to discuss the themes of ''Superman''.<ref name="comment"/><ref name=Ilya/> Mankiewicz deliberately fostered analogies with Jor-El ([[El (god)|God]]) and [[Superman|Kal-El]] (Jesus).<ref name=Dick/> Donner is somewhat skeptical of Mankiewicz' actions, joking "I got enough [[death threat]]s because of that."<ref name=comment/>

Several concepts and items of imagery have been used in [[Bible|Biblical]] comparisons. Jor-El casts out [[General Zod]] from Krypton, a parallel to [[War in Heaven|the casting out]] of [[Satan]] from [[Heaven]].<ref name=comment/> The [[spacecraft]] that brings Kal-El to Earth is in the form of a star ([[Star of Bethlehem]]). Kal-El comes to [[Ma and Pa Kent|Jonathan and Martha Kent]], who are unable to have children. [[Martha Kent]] states, "All these years how we've prayed and prayed that the good Lord would see fit to give us a child," which was compared to [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|the Virgin Mary]].<ref name=comment/>

Just as little is known about Jesus during his middle years, Clark travels into the wilderness to find out who he is and what he has to do. Jor-El says, "Live as one of them, Kal-El, to discover where your strength and power are needed. But always hold in your heart the pride of your special heritage. They can be a great people, Kal-El, and they wish to be. They only lack [[Light of the World|the light to show the way]]. For this reason above all, their capacity for good, I have sent them you, my only son."<ref name=comment/> The theme resembles the Biblical account of God sending his only son Jesus to Earth in hope for the good of mankind. More were seen when Donner was able to complete ''[[Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut]]'', featuring [[Crucifixion of Jesus|the fall]], [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] and his [[Harrowing of Hell|battle with evil]]. Another vision was that of ''[[The Creation of Adam]]''.<ref name=comment/>

The Christian imagery in the Reeve films has provoked comment on the Jewish origins of Superman. Rabbi [[Simcha Weinstein]]'s book ''[[Up, Up and Oy Vey]]: How Jewish History, Culture and Values Shaped the Comic Book Superhero'', says that Superman is both a pillar of society and one whose cape conceals a "nebbish", saying "He's a bumbling, nebbish Jewish stereotype. He's [[Woody Allen]]."<ref name="neb">{{Cite news|author=Michael Elkin |title=Super ...

This same theme is pursued about 1940s superheroes generally in ''Disguised as Clark Kent: Jews, Comics, and the Creation of the Superhero'' by [[Danny Fingeroth]].<ref name=neb/><ref name=Allen/>

In the scene where Lois Lane interviews Superman on the balcony, Superman replies, "I never lie." Salkind felt this was an important point in the film, since Superman, living under his [[secret identity]] as Clark Kent, is "telling the biggest lie of all time." [[Relationship of Clark Kent and Lois Lane|His romance with Lois]] also leads him to contradict Jor-El's orders to avoid [[alternate history|altering human history]], [[time travel]]ing to save her from dying. Superman instead takes the advice of Jonathan Kent, his father on Earth.<ref name=Ilya/>

==Release==
''Superman'' was originally scheduled to be released in June 1978, the 40th anniversary of ''[[Action Comics 1]]'', which first introduced Superman, but the problems during filming pushed the film back by six months. Editor [[Stuart Baird]] reflected, "Filming was finished in October 1978 and it is a miracle we had the film released two months later. Big-budgeted films today tend to take six to eight months."<ref name=legend/> Donner, for his part, wished that he had "had another six months; I would have perfected a lot of things. But at some point, you've gotta turn the picture over."<ref name=cine/> Warner Bros. spent $7&nbsp;million to market and promote the film.<ref name="market">{{Cite news| author = Ivor Davis | title = Marketing The Man of Steel | work = [[Maclean's]] | date = December 1978 | pages = 22–26 | accessdate = September 5, 2008}}</ref>

Three days later, on December 13, it had a European Royal Charity Premiere at the [[Empire, Leicester Square]] in London in the presence of [[HM Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Prince Andrew]]. It went on to gross $134.21&nbsp;million in North America and $166&nbsp;million internationally, totaling $300.21&nbsp;million worldwide.<ref name= BOM /> ''Superman'' was the [[1978 in film|second-highest-grossing film of 1978]] (behind only ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]''), and became the sixth-highest-grossing film of all time after its theatrical run.

He also argued that the film should have adhered more to the spirit of Mario Puzo's original script, and referred to the first three Superman films collectively as "simply puffed-up TV episodes."<ref>{{cite news | first = Dan | last = Hagen | date = January 1988 | title = Neal Gabler | work = [[Comics Interview]] | issue = 54 | pages = 61–63 | publisher = [[Fictioneer Books]]}}</ref>

===The television broadcasts===
While, by contract, Richard Donner had major editorial control over what was theatrically released, the Salkinds had editorial control on what was shown outside of theaters.  This was the result of deals that had been made between the producers and the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television network prior to the film's release.  Financially, the more footage that was restored for television, the more revenue that could be made for the broadcast (the producers charged by the minute for every bit of footage added back in).  During production of the film, Alexander and Ilya Salkind had been relegated to having to sell more and more of their rights back to Warner Bros. in exchange for financial help{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}, which is why Warner Bros. would have theatrical and home video distribution rights.  So by 1981 when the television rights reverted to the Salkinds, the producers prepared a 3-hour and 8-minute version for worldwide television reincorporating some 45 minutes of footage and music deleted from the theatrical cut, and specially prepared so that networks and stations can re-edit their own version at their discretion. This edit is commonly known as the "Salkind International Television Cut".  All subsequent network television cuts were derived from this version.

[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] aired the broadcast television debut of ''Superman'' over two nights in February, 1982, with a majority of the unused footage. The 182-minute network cut (which was slightly cut down for content) was repeated in November of that same year, this time in its entirety in one evening.  The remaining two ABC broadcasts were presented in its original theatrical version.

When the TV rights reverted back to [[Warner Bros.]] in 1985, [[CBS]] aired the film one last time on network television in its theatrical version. When the movie entered the [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.supermanii.com/siiweb/sii%20behind-the-scenes/SMT_194.html |title=Monday, May 14th. 7:00–10:00&nbsp;pm- WPIX New York airs the theatrical version of 'Superman The Movie' |publisher=Supermanii.com |accessdate=November 30, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205082009/http://www.supermanii.com/siiweb/sii%20behind-the-scenes/SMT_194.html |archivedate=February 5, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref> market in 1988 (following a play-out run on pay cable<ref name="The Salkind International Cut">[http://www.capedwonder.com/newwebsite/pages/si-ii.htm The Salkind International Cut at CapedWonder.com]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.supermanii.com/siiweb/sii%20behind-the-scenes/SMT_157.html |title=HBO premieres the theatrical version of 'Superman The Movie'.

The stations that showed the extended cut<ref name="The Salkind International Cut"/> edited the second half to add more advertising time and "previously on..." cutback scenes just as ABC had done in 1982.

In 1994 (following a pay-cable reissue and its obligatory run on [[USA Network]]), [[Warner Bros. Television]] syndicated the full 188-minute international television version, most famously on a [[Los Angeles]] television station. The most notable additions unseen on U.S. television were two additional scenes never seen before, in addition to what had been previously reinstated.<ref name="DVD">{{Cite news| first = Barry | last = Freiman | url = http://www.supermanhomepage.com/movies/movies.php?topic=interview-salkind-SE | title = Special Edition Superman DVDs on the Way | work = Superman Homepage | date = January 2006 | accessdate = September 8, 2008}}</ref>  This version also surfaced outside of Los Angeles. For example, [[WJLA-TV|WJLA]] Channel 7, an ABC affiliate out of Washington, D.C., aired the extended cut in July 1994. Because its first known airing was on [[Los Angeles]] television station [[KCOP]], it is also known in fan circles as the "KCOP Version".

When Michael Thau and [[Warner Home Video]] started working on a [[film restoration]] in 2000, some of the extra footage was not added because of poor visual effects. Thau felt "the pace of the film's storyline would be adversely affected [and there were] timing problems matching [footage] with John Williams' [''sic''] musical score, etc… The cut of the movie shown on [[KCOP-TV|KCOP]] was put together to make the movie longer when shown on TV as the Television Station paid per minute to air the movie.

Thau explained, "I worked on ''[[Ladyhawke (film)|Ladyhawke]]'' and that's how I really met Dick [Donner] and [[Tom Mankiewicz]]. I used to hear those wonderful stories in the cutting room that Tom and Dick and [[Stuart Baird|Stuart]] would tell about ''Superman'' and that's how I kind of got the ideas for the plots of 'Taking Flight' and 'Making Superman'".<ref name=plot/> Donner commented, "There are a few shots where Chris [Reeve]'s costume looked green.

There were various extended TV versions each broadcast in various countries. Most of these are in [[pan and scan]], as they were made in the 1980s, when films were not letterboxed to preserve the theatrical aspect ratio on old TVs.

Until 2017, it was thought the quality of the extended network TV version was inferior to any theatrical or previous home video release because it was mastered in [[16mm]] (using the "[[film chain system]]") and a [[Monophonic sound|mono]] sound mix done, as by the time the extended cut was prepared in 1981, stereo was not available in television broadcasts (16mm television prints were in fact made and mastered on NTSC Standard Definition video for the initial ABC network broadcasts). However, during an inventory of the Warner Bros. library, an IP master of the full 188-minute television version was discovered.  This eight-reel master was not marked with an aspect ratio, but the print was inspected and, as it turned out, was in the proper 2.35:1 [[Panavision]] ratio.  This was the source of the [[Warner Archive Collection]] Blu-Ray release of what would officially be called the "Superman: The Movie Extended Cut", issued on October 3, 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-three-hour-extended-cut-of-superman-the-movie-is-f-1818543643 |title= The Three-Hour Extended Cut of Superman: The Movie Is Finally Getting a Home Release |website= gizmodo.com |accessdate= September 19, 2017}}</ref>  The new video release was visually restored by WB's imaging department, and, other than the opening and end credits (which are in true stereo), the film is presented in an enhanced version of the mono TV sound mix.  It should be noted, however, that eight of the 45 minutes of extended scenes that were used in the later 2000 director's cut restoration (which is also included in the new video release) were taken from restored elements.

''Superman'' was nominated for three [[Academy Award]]s ([[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] – ([[Stuart Baird]]), [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] – ([[John Williams]]) and [[Academy Award for Best Sound|Best Sound]] – ([[Gordon K.

Donner publicly expressed disgust that [[production designer]] [[John Barry (set designer)|John Barry]] and [[cinematographer]] [[Geoffrey Unsworth]] had not been recognized by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|Academy]].<ref name=Hughes/>

''Superman'' was successful at the [[32nd British Academy Film Awards]].

With the film's success, it was immediately decided to finish ''[[Superman II]]''. Ilya and Alexander Salkind and [[Pierre Spengler]] did not ask Donner to return because Donner had criticized them during the film's publicity phase.<ref name=Ilya/> Donner commented in January 1979, "I'd work with Spengler again, but only on my terms. As long as he has nothing to say as the producer, and is just liaison between Alexander Salkind and his money, that's fine. If they don't want it on those terms, then they need to go out and find another director, it sure as shit ain't gonna be me."<ref name=cine/> Kidder, who portrayed Lois Lane, was dissatisfied by the producers' decision,<ref name=legend/> and also criticized the Salkinds during publicity. As a result, Kidder was only given a [[cameo appearance]] for ''Superman III'', and not a main supporting role.<ref>{{Cite news| author = Barry Freiman | url = http://www.supermanhomepage.com/movies/movies.php?topic=interview-expo-kidder | title = One-on-One with Margot Kidder | work = Superman Homepage | date = February 8, 2005 | accessdate = September 9, 2008}}</ref> [[Jack O'Halloran]], who portrayed [[Non (DC Comics)|Non]], stated, "It was great to work with Donner.

''[[Superman Returns]]'' was released in 2006. Director [[Bryan Singer]] credited the 1978 ''Superman'' as an influence for ''Superman Returns'', and used restored footage of Brando as Jor-El. ''[[Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut]]'' also was released in 2006.<ref name=look/>

The film's final sequence, which features Superman flying high above the Earth at sunrise, and breaking the [[fourth wall]] to smile briefly at the camera, featured at the end of every Superman film starring Reeve and was re-shot with [[Brandon Routh]] for ''[[Superman Returns]]''.

The series was [[Reboot (fiction)|rebooted]] with ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'' in 2013.

Because ''Superman'' went into production prior to the releases of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (May 1977) and ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' (November 1977), some observers credit the three films collectively for launching the reemergence of a large market for [[science fiction film]]s 
[[List of science fiction films of the 1980s|in the 1980s]]. This is certainly the view of ''Superman'' producer Ilya Salkind and some who have interviewed him,<ref name=Ilya/><ref name=one/> as well as of film production assistant Brad Lohan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.entertainmentbuff.com/culture/what-if-star-wars-had-never-been-made/ |title=What If "Star Wars" Had Never Been Made? |author=Brad Lohan |work= |publisher=Entertainment Buff |accessdate=January 26, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710193902/http://www.entertainmentbuff.com/culture/what-if-star-wars-had-never-been-made/ |archivedate=July 10, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref> Other observers of film history tend to credit the resurgence of science fiction films simply to the Lucas and Spielberg productions, and see ''Superman'' as the first of the new cycle of films launched by the first two.<ref>{{cite book |title=VFX Artistry: A Visual Tour of How the Studios Create Their Magic |last=Drate |first=Spencer |authorlink= |author2=Judith Salavetz  | year=2009 |publisher=Focal Press |location= |isbn=0-240-81162-3 |page=164 |url= |accessdate=}}</ref> Ilya Salkind denies any connection between ''Superman''—which began filming in March 1977—and the other films, stating that "I did not know about 'Star Wars'; 'Star Wars' did not know about 'Superman'; 'Close Encounters' did not know about 'Superman.' It really was completely independent—nobody knew anything about anybody."<ref name=one/> ''Superman'' also established the [[superhero film]] genre as viable outside the production of low-budget Saturday matinee serials. Director [[Christopher Nolan]] cited Richard Donner's vision and scope of ''Superman'' when pitching the concept for ''[[Batman Begins]]'' to Warner Bros. in 2002.<ref name=journeybegins>''The Fire Rises: The Creation and Impact of the Dark Knight Trilogy'' [Blu-ray, 2013]</ref>

The movie inspired [[The Kinks]]' 1979 song "[[(Wish I Could Fly Like) Superman]]", when the band's main songwriter, [[Ray Davies]], watched the film in late 1978.<ref name=story>{{cite book|title=You Really Got Me: The Story of The Kinks|author=Hasted, N.|page=|year=2011|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=9781849386609}}</ref>
