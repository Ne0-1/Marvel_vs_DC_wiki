'''''Superman''''' (also known as '''''Superman: The Movie''''') is a 1978 [[epic film|epic]] [[superhero film]] based on the [[DC Comics]] character of the [[Superman|same name]]. [[Richard Donner]] directed the film, which stars [[Christopher Reeve]] as Superman, as well as [[Gene Hackman]], [[Margot Kidder]], [[Marlon Brando]], [[Glenn Ford]], [[Phyllis Thaxter]], [[Jackie Cooper]], [[Marc McClure]], [[Valerie Perrine]] and [[Ned Beatty]]. The film depicts the [[origin of Superman]], from infancy as Kal-El of [[Krypton]] and growing up in [[Smallville (DC Comics)|Smallville]]. Disguised as reporter [[Clark Kent]], he adopts a [[nerd|mild mannered]] attitude in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] and develops a romance with [[Lois Lane]],while battling against the villainous [[Lex Luthor]].

The film was conceived in 1973 by [[Ilya Salkind]]. Several directors, most notably [[Guy Hamilton]], and screenwriters ([[Mario Puzo]], [[David Newman|David]] and [[Leslie Newman]] and [[Robert Benton]]) were associated with the project before Richard Donner was hired to direct. Donner brought [[Tom Mankiewicz]] to rewrite the script, feeling it was too [[camp (style)|camp]]y. Mankiewicz was credited as [[creative consultant]]. It was decided to film both ''Superman'' and ''[[Superman II]]'' simultaneously.

[[Principal photography]] started in March 1977 and ended in October 1978. Tensions rose between Donner and the producers, and a decision was made to stop filming ''Superman II'' and finish the first film. Donner had already shot 75% of the sequel, eventually giving birth to ''[[Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut]]''. ''Superman'' was released with critical acclaim and financial success. Reviewers noted parallels between the film's depiction of Superman and [[Jesus]].<ref name=comment/> The film's legacy helped create a reemergence of [[science fiction film]]s and the establishment of the [[superhero film]] genre.

==Plot==
On the planet [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]], using evidence provided by scientist [[Jor-El]], the Ruling Council sentences three insurrectionists, [[General Zod]], [[Ursa]] and [[Non (DC comics)|Non]], to "eternal living death" in the [[Phantom Zone]] for attempting a totalitarian rebellion. Although the Council widely respects him, Jor-El is unable to convince them of his belief that the Kryptonian sun will shortly explode and destroy their planet. As a result, Jor-El launches a spacecraft containing his infant son, [[Kal-El]], towards Earth, a distant planet with a suitable atmosphere, and where Kal-El's dense molecular structure will give him superhuman powers. Shortly after the ship launches Krypton is destroyed.

Three years later the ship reaches Earth, crashing near an American farming town, [[Smallville (DC Comics)|Smallville]], where Kal-El is found by [[Ma and Pa Kent|Jonathan and Martha Kent]] and raised as their own son, Clark. Eighteen years later, after the death of Jonathan, Clark hears a psychic "call", discovering a glowing green crystal in the ship. Compelled to travel north, heading to the [[Arctic]], where the crystal builds the [[Fortress of Solitude]], resembling the architecture of Krypton. Activating a control panel inside the fortress, a vision of Jor-El explains Clark's origins, educating him in powers and responsibilities. After twelve years, with his powers fully developed, Clark leaves the Fortress and finds a job at ''[[The Daily Planet]]'' in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]. He meets and develops a romantic attraction to reporter [[Lois Lane]], but the feelings are not returned: she regards him as a friend. Lois becomes involved in a helicopter accident where conventional means of rescue are impossible, requiring Clark to use his powers in public for the first time in order to save her.

Later, he visits her at home, takes her for a flight over the city, and allows her to interview him for a newspaper article in which she dubs him "Superman." Meanwhile, criminal genius [[Lex Luthor]] has developed a cunning plan to make a fortune in real estate by buying large amounts of "worthless" desert land and then diverting a nuclear rocket from a missile testing site to the [[San Andreas Fault]]. This will destroy [[California]] and leave Luthor's desert as the new [[West Coast of the United States]], greatly increasing its [[real estate]] value. After his incompetent henchman Otis accidentally redirects the first rocket to the wrong place, Luthor's girlfriend Eve Teschmacher successfully changes the course of a second missile. Knowing Superman could stop his plan, Luthor lures him to his underground lair and exposes him to [[Kryptonite]]. As Superman weakens, Luthor taunts him by revealing the first missile is headed to [[Hackensack, New Jersey]], in the opposite direction, knowing Superman could not stop both impacts.

Teschmacher is horrified because her mother lives in Hackensack, but Luthor does not care and leaves Superman to a slow death. Teschmacher rescues Superman on the condition that he will deal with the New Jersey missile first. He is consequently too late to stop the second impact, causing a massive earthquake which he battles to correct. While he is busy saving others, Lois' car falls into the ground by an earthquake, and quickly begins to fill with dirt and debris, which suffocates her. Distraught at being unable to save Lois, Superman ignores Jor-El's warning not to interfere with human history, preferring to remember Jonathan Kent's advice that he must be here for "a reason" and travels back in time in order to save Lois. Having finally averted the disaster, Superman delivers Luthor and Otis to prison, where he knows they will be secure until they receive a [[right to a fair trial|fair trial]].

==Cast==
'''[[Christopher Reeve]]''' as '''[[Clark Kent|Kal-El / Clark Kent]] / [[Superman]]''': After discovering his roots and origins from the planet [[Krypton]], he sets himself to fulfill his destiny and help those on Earth. In his wake, he finds the villainous Lex Luthor which sets dire consequences. As a means to protect his identity, he works as mild mannered reporter Clark Kent at ''[[The Daily Planet]]''. The producers previously failed to sign an [[A-list]] actor for the role before Richard Donner's hiring. It was decided to cast an unknown actor, and [[Casting (performing arts)|casting director]] Lynn Stalmaster first suggested [[Christopher Reeve]], but Donner and the producers felt he was too young and skinny.<ref name=flight/> Over 200 unknown actors auditioned for Superman,<ref>{{cite news | author = Peter Coutros | title = Young Actor to Play in Super Role | work = [[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]] | date = [[1977-02-24]] | accessdate = }}</ref> including [[Christopher Walken]] and [[Nick Nolte]].<ref name=Ilya/><ref name=flight/> "We found guys with fabulous physique who couldn't act or wonderful actors who did not look remotely like Superman," creative consultant [[Tom Mankiewicz]] remembered.

Stalmaster convinced Donner and Ilya to have Reeve screen test in February 1977. Reeve stunned the director and producers, but he was told to wear a "muscle suit" to produce the desired muscular physique.

This set up their roles in ''[[Superman II]]''. [[Kirk Alyn]] and [[Noel Neill]] have [[cameo appearance]]s as Lois Lane's [[Sam Lane|father]] and mother. Alyn and Neill portrayed Superman and Lois Lane in [[Superman (serial)|the 1948 serial]] and ''[[Atom Man vs. Superman]]''.

==Production==
===Development===
Producer [[Ilya Salkind]] conceived the idea for a Superman film in late 1973.<ref name=one>{{cite news | author = Barry Freiman | url = http://www.supermanhomepage.com/movies/movies.php?topic=interview-salkind | title = One-on-One Interview with Producer Ilya Salkind | work = Superman Homepage | date = February 2006 | accessdate = 2008-09-09}}</ref> In November 1974, after a long difficult process with [[DC Comics]], the Superman [[film rights]] were purchased by Ilya and father [[Alexander Salkind]] and [[Pierre Spengler]]. DC wanted a list of actors that were to be considered for Superman. They approved over the producer's choices of [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Al Pacino]], [[James Caan]], [[Steve McQueen (actor)|Steve McQueen]], [[Clint Eastwood]] and [[Dustin Hoffman]].<ref name=saga>[[Richard Donner]], [[Tom Mankiewicz]], [[Ilya Salkind]], [[Pierre Spengler]], [[David Prowse]], ''You Will Believe: The Cinematic Saga of Superman'', 2006, [[Warner Home Video]]</ref> The filmmakers felt it was best to film ''Superman'' and ''[[Superman II]]'' simultaneously, and make a [[negative pickup deal]] with [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]].<ref name=flight>[[Richard Donner]], [[Tom Mankiewicz]], [[Christopher Reeve]], [[Margot Kidder]], Lynn Stalmaster, [[Marc McClure]], Taking Flight: The Development of ''Superman'', 2001, [[Warner Home Video]]</ref> [[William Goldman]] was approached to write the screenplay, while [[Leigh Brackett]] was considered. Ilya hired [[Alfred Bester]], who began writing a [[film treatment]].

Peckinpah dropped out when he produced a gun during a meeting with Ilya. [[George Lucas]] turned down the offer because of his commitment to ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]''.<ref name=Ilya/><ref name=one/>

During the filming of ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', [[Steven Spielberg]] expressed interest in directing ''Superman''. Ilya was enthusiastic to hire Spielberg, but Alexander was skeptical, feeling it was best to wait for the release "of that fish movie of his". ''Jaws'' was released with [[box office]] success, prompting the producers to offer Spielberg the position, but he was already committed to ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]''.<ref name=one/> [[Guy Hamilton]] was hired as director, while Puzo delivered his 500-page script for ''Superman'' and ''Superman II'' in July 1975.<ref name=flight/> [[Jax-Ur]] appeared as one of [[General Zod]]'s [[henchman]], with [[Clark Kent]] written as a television reporter. Dustin Hoffman, who was previously considered for Superman, turned down [[Lex Luthor]].<ref name=saga/><ref name=life/> It was decided to first sign an [[A-list]] actor for Superman. [[Robert Redford]] was offered a lot of money, but felt he was too famous. [[Burt Reynolds]] also turned down the role, while [[Sylvester Stallone]] was interested, but nothing ever came of it. [[Paul Newman]] was offered his choosing as Superman, Lex Luthor or Jor-El for $4 million, turning down all three roles.<ref name=Ilya/>

In early 1975, [[Marlon Brando]] signed on as Jor-El with a salary of $3.7 million and 11.75% of the box office gross profits, totaling $19 million. Brando hoped to use some of his salary for a proposed thirteen-part ''[[Roots (TV miniseries)|Roots]]''-style [[miniseries]] on [[Native Americans in the United States]].<ref>{{cite book | author= Peter Manso| title = Brando the Biography | publisher =[[Hyperion (publisher)|Hyperion]] | month = November | year = 1995 | location = | isbn = 0786881283 | chapter = The Way It's Never Been Done Before}}</ref> Brando had it in his contract to complete all of his scenes in 12 days. He also refused to memorize his dialog, so [[cue card]]s were compiled across the set. [[Gene Hackman]] was cast as Lex Luthor days later. The filmmakers made it a priority to shoot all of Brando and Hackman's footage "because they would be committed to other films immediately".<ref name=one/><ref name=flight/> Puzo's scripts were too [[epic film|epic]], bringing [[Robert Benton]] and [[David Newman (filmmaker)|David Newman]] for rewrite work.

Their script was submitted in July 1976,<ref name=flight/> and carried a [[camp (style)|camp]] tone, including a [[cameo appearance]] by [[Telly Savalas]] as his ''[[Kojak]]'' character.

Production moved to England in late-1976, but Hamilton could not join because he was a [[tax exile]].<ref name=Dick/>

[[Mark Robson]] became in talks to direct, but after seeing ''[[The Omen]]'', the producers hired [[Richard Donner]]. Donner had previously been planning ''[[Damien: Omen II]]'' when he was hired in January 1977 for $1 million to direct ''Superman'' and ''Superman II''.<ref name=Hughes/> Donner felt it was best to start from scratch.

According to Mankiewicz "not a word from the Puzo script was used".<ref name=Dick/> "It was a well-written, but still a ridiculous script. It was 550 pages. I said, 'You can't shoot this screenplay because you'll be shooting for five years'," Donner continued. "That was literally a [[shooting script]] and they planned to shoot all 550 pages. You know, 110 pages is plenty for a script, so even for two features, that was way too much."<ref name=cine>{{cite news | author = Don Shay | title = Richard Donner on ''Superman'' | work = [[Cinefantastique]] | date = Summer 1979 | pages = 26&mdash;36 | accessdate = 2008-09-07}}</ref> Mankiewicz conceived having each Kryptonian family wear a [[crest (heraldry)|crest]] resembling a different letter, justifying the 'S' on Superman's costume.<ref name=Hughes/> The [[Writers Guild of America]] refused to credit Mankiewicz for his rewrites, so Donner gave him a [[creative consultant]] credit, much to the annoyance from the Guild.<ref name=Hughes/>

===Filming===
[[Principal photography]] began on March 24, 1977 at [[Pinewood Studios]] for [[Krypton]] scenes, budgeted as the most expensive film ever made at that point. Since ''Superman'' was being shot simultaneously with ''[[Superman II]]'', filming lasted for 19 months, until October 1978. Filming was originally to last for 7&mdash;8 months, but problems rose during production. [[John Barry (set designer)|John Barry]] served as [[production designer]], while [[Stuart Craig]] and [[Norman Reynolds]] worked as [[art director]]s. [[Derek Meddings]] and [[Les Bowie]] were credited as [[visual effects supervisor]]s. [[Stuart Freeborn]] was the [[make-up artist]], while Barry, [[David Lane (director)|David Lane]], [[Peter MacDonald (film director)|Peter MacDonald]] and [[John Glen]] directed [[second unit]] scenes. [[Vic Armstrong]] was hired as the [[stunt coordinator]] and Reeve's [[stunt double]], his wife Wendy Leech was [[Margot Kidder]]'s double. ''Superman'' was also the final film by [[cinematographer]] [[Geoffrey Unsworth]], who died during post-production. The [[Fortress of Solitude]] was constructed at [[Shepperton Studios]] and the [[007 Stage]].<ref name=legend>Making ''Superman'': Filming The Legend, 2001, [[Warner Home Video]]</ref><ref name=look>[[Look, Up in the Sky: The Amazing Story of Superman]], 2006, [[Warner Home Video]]</ref> Upon viewing the footage of Krypton, [[Warner Bros.]] decided to distribute in not only North America, but also in foreign countries. Due to complications and problems during filming, Warners also supplied $20 million and acquired [[broadcasting|television rights]].<ref name=legend/><ref name=market/> 

[[New York City]] doubled for [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], while the [[Daily News (New York)|''New York Daily News'']] served as the location for the ''[[Daily Planet]]''. [[Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn|Brooklyn Heights]] was also used.<ref>{{cite news | author = Peter Coutros | title = Clark Kent Uses Our Lobby for a Phone Booth | work = [[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] | date = June 1977 | accessdate = 2008-09-05}}</ref> Filming in New York lasted five weeks, during the time of the [[New York City blackout of 1977]]. Production moved to [[Alberta]] for scenes set in [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]], while brief filming took place in [[Gallup, New Mexico]], [[Lake Mead]] and [[Grand Central Terminal]].<ref name=comment/> Director Richard Donner had tensions with producers Ilya and Alexander Salkind and Pierre Spengler concerning the escalating production budget and the [[shooting schedule]]. [[Creative consultant]] [[Tom Mankiewicz]] reflected, "Donner never got a budget or a schedule. He was constantly told he was way over schedule and budget. At one point he said, 'why don't you just schedule the film for the next two days and I'll be nine months over'."<ref name=legend/> [[Richard Lester]], who worked with the Salkinds on ''[[The Three Musketeers (1973 film)|The Three Musketeers]]'' and ''[[The Four Musketeers (film)|The Four Musketeers]]'', was brought as a producer to mediate the relationship between Donner and the producers.<ref name=one/> Donner and the Salkinds refused to talk to each other.<ref name=legend/> With his relationship with Spengler, Donner remarked, "At one time if I'd seen him, I would have killed him."<ref name=market/>

Lester was offered producing credit but refused and went uncredited for his work.<ref name=legend/> Salkind felt that bringing a second director on-set meant there was someone ready in the event Donner couldn't fulfill his directing duties. "Being there all the time meant he [Lester] could take over," Salkind admitted. "[Donner] couldn't make up his mind on stuff."<ref name=one/> On Lester, Donner reflected, "He had been suing the Salkinds for his money on ''Three'' and ''Four Musketeers'', which he had never gotten. He won a lot of his lawsuits, but each time he sued the Salkinds in one country, they'd move to another, from Costa Rica to Panama to Switzerland. When I was hired, Lester told me, 'Don't do it. Don't work for them. I was told not to, but I did it. Now I'm telling you not to, but you'll probably do it and end up telling the next guy.' Lester came in as a 'go-between'. I didn't trust Lester, and I told him. He said, 'Believe me, I'm only doing it because they're paying me the money that they owe me from the lawsuit. I'll never come onto your set unless you ask me; I'll never go to your [[dailies]]. If I can help you in any way, call me."<ref name=cine/>

It was decided to stop shooting ''Superman II'' and focus on finishing ''Superman''. Donner had already completed 75% of the sequel.<ref>{{cite news | author = Richard Fyrbourne | title = The Man Behind ''Superman'': Richard Donner | work = [[Starlog]] | date = January 1979 | pages = 40&mdash;44 | accessdate = 2008-09-07}}</ref> The filmmakers took a risk: if ''Superman'' was a [[box office bomb]], they would not finish ''Superman II''. The original [[climax (narrative)|climax]] for ''Superman II'' had [[General Zod]], [[Ursa (comics)|Ursa]] and [[Non (DC Comics)|Non]] destroying the planet, with Superman [[time travel]]ing to fix the damage.<ref name=Ilya/> On the original ending for ''Superman'', [[Lex Luthor]] and [[Otis (Superman)|Otis]] were put in prison, with the nuclear missile that Superman did not counter against flying in [[outer space]]. The missile would strike the [[Phantom Zone]], freeing the three Kryptonian villains. Donner commented, "I decided if ''Superman'' is a success, they're going to do a sequel. If it ain't a success, a [[cliffhanger]] ain't going to bring them to see ''Superman II''."<ref name=Hughes/>

''Superman'' is well-known for its large-scale [[visual effects]] sequences, all of which were created before the [[computer-generated imagery|digital age]]. The [[Golden Gate Bridge]] [[scale model]] stood 70 feet long and 20 feet wide. Other miniatures included the Krypton Council Dome and the [[Hoover Dam]]. [[Slow motion]] was used to simulate the vast amount of water for the Hoover Dam destruction. The [[Fortress of Solitude]] was a combination of a full-scale set and [[matte painting]]s. [[Superboy (Kal-El)|Young Clark Kent]]'s long-distance [[Punt (football)|football punt]] was executed with a wooden football loaded into an [[air blaster]] placed in the ground. The Superman costume was to be a much darker blue, but the use of [[chroma key|blue screen]] made it [[transparency (optics)|transparent]].<ref name=magic>The Magic Behind The Cape, 2001, [[Warner Home Video]]</ref>

The first test for the flying sequences involved simply catapulting a [[crash test dummy]] out of a cannon. Another technique had a remote control cast of Superman flying around. Both were discarded due to lack of movement. High quality, realistic-looking animation was tried, with speed trails added to make the effect more convincing. Finally, a technique was developed that combined the [[front projection effect]] with specially designed [[zoom lens]]es.<ref name=magic/> The illusion of movement was created by zooming in on Christopher Reeve while making the front projected image appear to recede. For scenes where Superman interacts with other people or objects while in flight, Reeve and actors were put in a variety of rigging equipment with careful lighting and photography.<ref name=magic/> This also led to the creation of the [[Zoptic]] system.<ref>{{cite news | author = Nicholas Leahy | title = How Superman flies | work = [[Starburst (magazine)|Starburst]] | date = April 1982 | pages = 16&mdash;19 | accessdate = 2008-09-05}}</ref>

The highly reflective costumes worn by the Kryptonians were the result of an accident during Superman flying tests. "We noticed the material lit up on its own," Donner explained. "We tore the material into tiny pieces and glued it on the costumes, designing a front projection effect for each camera. There was a little light on each camera, and it would project into a mirror, bounce out in front of the lens, hit the costume, [and] millions of little glass heads would light up and bring the image back into the camera."<ref name=Hughes/>

[[Jerry Goldsmith]], who scored Donner's ''[[The Omen]]'', was originally set to compose ''Superman''. Portions of Goldsmith's work from ''[[Capricorn One]]'' were used in ''Superman'''s teaser trailer. He dropped out over scheduling conflicts and [[John Williams]] was hired.<ref name=Ilya>[[Ilya Salkind]], [[Pierre Spengler]], DVD [[audio commentary]], 2006, [[Warner Home Video]]</ref> Kidder was supposed to sing "[[Can You Read My Mind]]", the lyrics to which were written by [[Leslie Bricusse]], but Donner disliked it and changed it to a composition accompanied by a voiceover.<ref name=comment/>

[[Richard Donner]], [[Tom Mankiewicz]] and [[Ilya Salkind]] have commented on the use of [[religious perspectives on Jesus|Christian references]] to discuss the themes of ''Superman''.<ref name=comment>[[Richard Donner]], [[Tom Mankiewicz]], DVD [[audio commentary]], 2001, [[Warner Home Video]]</ref><ref name=Ilya/> Mankiewicz deliberately fostered analogies with Jor-El ([[El (god)|God]]) and [[Superman|Kal-El]] ([[Jesus]]).<ref name=Dick/> Donner is somewhat skeptical of Mankiewicz' actions, joking "I got enough [[death threat]]s because of that."<ref name=comment/>

Several concepts and items of imagery have been used in [[Bible|Biblical]] comparisons. Jor-El casts out [[General Zod]] from [[Krypton]], a parallel to [[War in Heaven|the casting out]] of [[Satan]] from [[Heaven]].<ref name=comment/> The [[spacecraft]] that brings Kal-El to Earth is in the form of a star ([[Star of Bethlehem]]). Kal-El comes to [[Ma and Pa Kent|Jonathan and Martha Kent]], who are unable to have children. [[Martha Kent]] states, "how we prayed and prayed the good Lord see fit to give us a child", which was compared to [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|the Virgin Mary]].<ref name=comment/>

Just as little is known about Jesus during his middle years, Clark travels into the wilderness to find out who he is and what he has to do. Jor-El says, "You must live as one of them, but always hold in your heart the pride of your special heritage. They can be a great people Kal-El, they wish to be, they only lack the light to show the way. For this reason above all, their capacity for good, I have sent them you, my only son."<ref name=comment/> The theme resembles the Biblical account of God sending his only son [[Jesus]] to Earth in hope for the good of mankind. More were seen when Donner was able to complete ''[[Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut]]'', featuring [[Crucifixion of Jesus|the fall]], [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] and his [[Harrowing of Hell|battle with evil]]. Another vision was that of ''[[The Creation of Adam]]''.<ref name=comment/>

The Christian imagery in the Reeve films has provoked comment on the Jewish origins of Superman. Rabbi [[Simcha Weinstein]]'s book ''Up, up, and oy vey: How Jewish History, Culture, and Values Shaped the Comic Book Superhero'' says that Superman is both a pillar of society and one whose cape conceals a "nebbish", saying "He's a bumbling, nebbish Jewish stereotype. He's [[Woody Allen]]."<ref name=neb>{{cite news | author =  Michael Elkin | title = Super ...

This same theme is pursued about '40s superheroes generally in ''Disguised as Clark Kent: Jews, Comics, and the Creation of the Superhero'' by Danny Fingeroth.<ref name=neb/><ref name=Allen/>

In the scene where [[Lois Lane]] is interviewing Superman on the balcony, Superman replies, "I never lie". Salkind felt this was an important point in the film, since Superman, living under his [[secret identity]] as [[Clark Kent]], is "telling the biggest lie of all time". [[Relationship of Clark Kent and Lois Lane|His romance with Lois]] also leads him to contradict Jor-El's orders to avoid [[alternate history|altering human history]], [[time travel]]ing to save her from dying. Superman instead takes the advice of Jonathan Kent, his father on Earth.<ref name=Ilya/>

==Release==
''Superman'' was originally to be released in June 1978, but the problems during filming pushed the film back by six months. Due to the rushed [[post-production]], no [[premiere]] took place. Editor [[Stuart Baird]] reflected, "Filming was finished in October 1978 and it is a miracle we had the film released three months later. Big-budgeted films today tend to take six&mdash;eight months."<ref name=legend/> Donner wished he "had another six months; I would have perfected a lot of things. But at some point you've got to turn the picture over."<ref name=cine/> Warner Bros. spent $7 million to market and promote the film.<ref name=market>{{cite news | author = Ivor Davis | title = Marketing The Man of Steel | work = [[Maclean's]] | date = December 1978 | pages = 22&mdash;26 | accessdate = 2008-09-05}}</ref> 

''Superman'' opened on December 15, 1978 in America, grossing $134.22 million in North America and $166 million in foreign countries, totaling $300.22 million worldwide. The film was declared a financial success since it beat its $55 million budget.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=superman.htm | title = Superman (1978) | work = [[Box Office Mojo]] | accessdate = 2008-09-01}}</ref> ''Superman'' was the sixth-highest grossing film at the time of its release, as well as [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]]' most successful (which has since been beaten).<ref name=legend/> Based on 46 reviews collected by ''[[Rotten Tomatoes]]'', 93% of reviewers enjoyed ''Superman'', with the consensus "''Superman'' deftly blends humor and gravitas, taking advantage of the perfectly cast [[Christopher Reeve]] to craft a loving, nostalgic tribute to an American pop culture icon."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/superman_the_movie/ | title = Superman: The Movie (1978) | work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate = 2008-09-01}}</ref> By comparison ''[[Metacritic]]'' collected an average score of 88, based on 12 reviews.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/supermanthemovie?q=Superman | title = Superman: The Movie (1978): Reviews | work = [[Metacritic]] | accessdate = 2008-09-01}}</ref> Superman creators [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]] gave a positive reaction.<ref name=saga/> Shuster was "delighted to see Superman on the screen. I got chills. Chris Reeve has just the right touch of humor. He really is Superman."<ref name=Kroll/>

[[Roger Ebert]] gave a largely positive review. "''Superman'' is a pure delight, a wondrous combination of all the old-fashioned things we never really get tired of: adventure and romance, heroes and villains, earthshaking special effects and wit. Christopher Reeve is perfectly cast in the role. Any poor choice would have ruined the film."<ref>{{cite web | title = Superman | work = [[Roger Ebert]] | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19781215/REVIEWS/41011001/1023 | accessdate = 2008-09-01}}</ref> [[James Berardinelli]] believed "there's no doubt that it's a flawed movie, but it's one of the most wonderfully entertaining flawed movies made during the 1970s. It's exactly what comic book fans hoped it would be. Perhaps most heartening of all, however, is the message at the end of the credits announcing the impending arrival of ''[[Superman II]]''."<ref>{{cite web | title = Superman | url = http://www.reelviews.net/php_review_template.php?identifier=736 | work = [[James Berardinelli]] | accessdate = 2008-09-01}}</ref> [[Harry Knowles]] is a longtime fan of the film, but was critical of elements that didn't represent the Superman stories as seen in the comics.<ref>{{cite news | author = [[Harry Knowles]] | url = http://www.aintitcool.com/display.cgi?id=13404 | title = Harry talks with JJ Abrams for a Couple of Hours about ''Superman'' | work = [[Ain't It Cool News]] | date = [[2002-09-28]] | accessdate = 2008-09-01}}</ref> [[Dave Kehr]] felt "the tone, style, and point of view change almost from shot to shot. This is the definitive corporate film. It is best when it takes itself seriously, worst when it takes the easy way out in giggly camp, When Lex Luthor enters the action, Gene Hackman plays the arch-villain like a hairdresser left over from a TV skit."<ref>{{cite news | author = [[Dave Kehr]] | url = http://onfilm.chicagoreader.com/movies/capsules/11755_SUPERMAN | title = Superman | work = [[Chicago Reader]] | accessdate = 2008-09-01}}</ref>

===Legacy===
''Superman'' did not win any of its three [[Academy Award]] nominations ([[Academy Award for Film Editing|Editing]], [[Academy Award for Original Music Score|Music (Original Score)]] and [[Academy Award for Sound Editing|Sound]]), although it received a [[Academy Special Achievement Award|Special Achievement Award]] for its [[visual effects]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Academy_Awards_USA/1979 | title = 51st Academy Awards | work = [[Internet Movie Database]] | accessdate = 2008-01-06}}</ref> Donner was disgusted that [[production designer]] [[John Barry (set designer)|John Barry]] and [[cinematographer]] [[Geoffrey Unsworth]] were not recognized. "If you look at the pictures that were nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]], it's a fucking sin that Unsworth wasn't up there. As for [[Academy Award for Best Art Direction|Art Direction]] they put up pictures like ''[[California Suite (film)|California Suite]]'', duplications of the [[Beverly Hills Hotel]]. Big deal! Just look what John Barry did, and he wasn't nominated either."<ref name=Hughes/> 

''Superman'' was successful at the [[32nd British Academy Film Awards]]. Reeve won [[BAFTA Award for Best Newcomer|Best Newcomer]], while [[Gene Hackman]], Unsworth, Barry and the [[sound design]]ers earned nominations.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://imdb.com/Sections/Awards/BAFTA_Awards/1979 | title = 32nd British Academy Film Awards | work = [[Internet Movie Database]] | accessdate = 2008-01-06}}</ref> The film won the [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation]].<ref>{{cite web |title = The 1979 Hugo Awards | work = [[Internet Movie Database]] | url = http://imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Hugo_Awards/1979 | accessdate = 2008-01-06}}</ref> At The [[Saturn Award]]s [[Margot Kidder]], Barry, [[John Williams]] and the [[visual effects]] department received awards, and the film won [[Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film|Best Science Fiction Film]].

With the success of the film it was instantly decided to finish ''[[Superman II]]''. [[Ilya Salkind|Ilya]] and [[Alexander Salkind]] and [[Pierre Spengler]] did not ask [[Richard Donner]] to return because Donner criticized them during [[publicity]].<ref name=Ilya/> Donner commented in January 1979, "I'd work with Spengler again, but only on my terms. As long as he has nothing to say as the producer, and is just liaison between Alexander Salkind and his money, that's fine. If they don't want it on those terms, then they've got to go out and find another director, it sure as shit ain't going to be me."<ref name=cine/> [[Margot Kidder]], who portrayed [[Lois Lane]], was dissatisfied by the producers' decision,<ref name=legend/> and also criticized the Salkinds during publicity. As a result, Kidder was only given a [[cameo appearance]] for ''Superman III'', and not a main supporting role.<ref>{{cite news | author = Barry Freiman | url = http://www.supermanhomepage.com/movies/movies.php?topic=interview-expo-kidder | title = One-on-One with Margot Kidder | work = Superman Homepage | date = [[2005-02-08]] | accessdate = 2008-09-09}}</ref> [[Jack O'Halloran]], who portrayed [[Non (DC Comics)|Non]], stated, "It was great to work with Donner. Richard Lester was as big an asshole as the Salkinds."<ref>{{cite news | author = Steve Younis | url = http://www.supermanhomepage.com/movies/movies.php?topic=interview-jack-ohalloran | title = Exclusive Jack O'Halloran Interview | work = Superman Homepage | date = [[2001-10-25]] | accessdate = 2008-09-10}}</ref> Two more films, ''[[Superman III]]'' (1983) and ''[[Superman IV: The Quest for Peace]]'' (1987), were produced. ''[[Superman Returns]]'' was released in 2006. Director [[Bryan Singer]] credited ''Superman: The Movie'' as an influence for ''Superman Returns'', and even used restored footage of Marlon Brando as Jor-El''. ''[[Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut]]'' also was released in 2006.<ref name=look/>

Alongside ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', ''Superman'' created a reemergence of [[science fiction film]]s. ''Superman'' also established the [[superhero film]] genre as viable outside the world of Saturday matinee serials, although it was a decade before the comparable success of the ''Batman'' series and two decades before that of ''X-Men'' and ''Spider-Man''.<ref name=Ilya/>

===Beyond theatrical release===
[[American Broadcasting Company]] aired the television debut of ''Superman'' in 1980, adding over 30 minutes of footage not seen in theaters. A syndicated version of the film aired in local television stations in [[Los Angeles, California]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] in the 1990s included most of this added footage and two additional scenes never seen before.<ref name=DVD>{{cite news | author = Barry Freiman | url = http://www.supermanhomepage.com/movies/movies.php?topic=interview-salkind-SE | title = Special Edition Superman DVDs on the Way | work = Superman Homepage | date = January 2006 | accessdate = 2008-09-08}}</ref> When [[Michael Thau]] and [[Warner Home Video]] started working on a [[film restoration]] in 2000, some of the extra footage was not added because of poor visual effects. Thau felt "the pace of the film's storyline would be adversely affected. This included timing problems with John William's musical score. The cut of the movie shown on TV was put together to make the movie longer when shown on TV because ABC paid per minute to air the movie. The [[special edition]] cut is designed for the best viewing experience in the true spirit of movie making."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.supermanhomepage.com/movies/movies.php?topic=interview-michael-thau1 | title = Superman "Special Edition" Interview | work = Superman Homepage | accessdate = 2008-09-10}}</ref> In May 2001, Warner Home Video released the special edition on DVD.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.amazon.com/Superman-Movie-Vass-Anderson/dp/B000059Z8J/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1220808567&sr=1-3 | title = Superman: The Movie (1978) | work  = [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] | accessdate = 2008-09-07}}</ref> Director Richard Donner also assisted, working slightly over a year on the project. The release included [[making-of]] documentaries directed by Thau and eight minutes of restored footage.<ref name=plot/>

Thau explained, "I worked on ''[[Ladyhawke]]'' and that's how I met Donner and [[Tom Mankiewicz]]. I used to hear those wonderful stories in the cutting room that Tom, Donner and [[Stuart Baird|Stuart]] would tell about ''Superman'' and that's how I kind of got the ideas for the plots of ''Taking Flight'' and ''Making Superman''.<ref name=plot>{{cite news | author = Barry Freiman | url = http://www.supermanhomepage.com/movies/movies.php?topic=interview-michael-thau2 | title = Interview with Michael Thau | work = Superman Homepage | date = December 2006 | accessdate = 2008-09-07}}</ref> Donner commented, "There were a few shots where the Superman costume looked green. We went in and cleaned that up, bringing the color back to where it should be."<ref name=ex>{{cite news | author = Steve Younis | url = http://www.supermanhomepage.com/movies/movies.php?topic=interview-richard-donner | title = Exclusive Richard Donner Interview | work = Superman Homepage | date = [[2001-03-27]] | accessdate = 2008-09-04}}</ref> Thau wanted to make the film shorter, "I wanted to take out the damn flying sequence where Lois is reciting a poem ["[[Can You Read My Mind]]"] when they're flying around. I also wanted to take out where it was just generic action. It was like a two minute car chase. Donner protested and the stuff stayed in."<ref name=plot/> It was followed by a [[box set]] release in the same month, containing "bare bones" editions of ''Superman II'', ''Superman III'' and ''Superman IV: The Quest for Peace''.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.amazon.com/Complete-Superman-Collection-Gene-Hackman/dp/B000059Z8L/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1220808567&sr=1-7 | title = The Complete Superman Collection | work  = [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] | accessdate = 2008-09-07}}</ref> In November 2006, a four-disc special edition was released,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.amazon.com/Superman-Four-Disc-Special-Christopher-Reeve/dp/B000IJ79UW/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1220808567&sr=1-4 | title = Superman: The Movie (4-disc special edition) | work  = [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] | accessdate = 2008-09-07}}</ref> followed by a [[HD DVD]] release<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.amazon.com/Superman-Movie-DVD-Christopher-Reeve/dp/B000I2JKEC/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1220808567&sr=1-5 | title = Superman: The Movie (4-disc special edition HD DVD) | work  = [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] | accessdate = 2008-09-07}}</ref> and [[Blu-ray Disc|blu-ray]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.amazon.com/Superman-Movie-Blu-ray-Kirk-Alyn/dp/B000K4X5XA/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1220808567&sr=1-2 | title = Superman: The Movie (Blu-ray) | work  = [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] | accessdate = 2008-09-07}}</ref> Also available (with other films) is the eight disc "Christopher Reeve Superman Collection"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.amazon.com/Christopher-Reeve-Superman-Collection-Movie/dp/B000IJ79VQ/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1220809380&sr=1-3 | title = The Christopher Reeve Superman Collection | work  = [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] | accessdate = 2008-09-07}}</ref> and the 14 disc "Superman Ultimate Collector's Edition".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.amazon.com/Superman-Ultimate-Collectors-Richard-Returns/dp/B000J10ERE/ref=pd_cp_d_2?pf_rd_p=413864101&pf_rd_s=center-41&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_i=B000P6XQ50&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=1QDRJVHZD4JEGVST5HGR | title = Superman Ultimate Collector's Edition | work  = [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] | accessdate = 2008-09-07}}</ref>
