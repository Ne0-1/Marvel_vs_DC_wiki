'''''Superman''''' (also known as '''''Superman: The Movie''''') is a 1978 American [[superhero film]] based on the [[DC Comics]] character of the [[Superman|same name]]. [[Richard Donner]] directed the film, which stars [[Christopher Reeve]] as Superman, as well as [[Gene Hackman]], [[Margot Kidder]], [[Marlon Brando]], [[Glenn Ford]], [[Phyllis Thaxter]], [[Jackie Cooper]], [[Marc McClure]], [[Valerie Perrine]] and [[Ned Beatty]]. The film depicts the [[origin of Superman]], from infancy as Kal-El of [[Krypton]] and growing up in [[Smallville (DC Comics)|Smallville]]. Disguised as reporter [[Clark Kent]], he adopts a [[nerd|mild mannered]] attitude in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] and develops a romance with [[Lois Lane]], while battling against the villainous [[Lex Luthor]].

The film was conceived in 1973 by [[Ilya Salkind]]. Several directors, most notably [[Guy Hamilton]], and screenwriters ([[Mario Puzo]], [[David Newman|David]] and [[Leslie Newman]] and [[Robert Benton]]) were associated with the project before Richard Donner was hired to direct. Donner brought [[Tom Mankiewicz]] to rewrite the script, feeling it was too [[camp (style)|campy]]. Mankiewicz was credited as [[creative consultant]]. It was decided to film both ''Superman'' and ''[[Superman II]]'' simultaneously.

[[Principal photography]] started in March 1977 and ended in October 1978. Tensions rose between Donner and the producers, and a decision was made to stop filming ''Superman II'' and finish the first film. Donner had already shot 75% of the sequel, eventually giving birth to ''[[Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut]]''. ''Superman'' was released with critical acclaim and financial success. Reviewers noted parallels between the film's depiction of Superman and [[Jesus]].<ref name=comment/> The film's legacy helped create a reemergence of [[science fiction film]]s and the establishment of the [[superhero film]] genre.

== Plot ==
On the planet [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]], using evidence provided by foremost scientist [[Jor-El]], the Ruling Council of Elders sentences three insurrectionists, [[General Zod]], [[Ursa (comics)|Ursa]] and [[Non (DC comics)|Non]], to "eternal living death" in the [[Phantom Zone]] for attempting a totalitarian rebellion. Before being sent to the Zone, Zod offers Jor-El a chance to reconsider that action, only to angrily swear vengeance when Jor-El refuses.  Although the Council widely respects him, Jor-El is unable to convince them of his belief that the red Kryptonian sun will shortly explode and destroy their planet. The Council warns Jor-El that should he attempt to go public with his information --- which could encite a panic among his fellow Kryptonians --- he himself would be sentenced to exile in the Phantom Zone. Jor-El reluctantly reassures the Council members that neither he or his wife [[Lara]] will leave the planet.  Resigned to his and his planet's fate, and with very little time left, Jor-El prepares an experimental, one-man spacecraft to transport his infant son [[Kal-El]] to a small planet in another galaxy called Earth, whose inhabitants bear a close resemblance to the Kryptonians. He reassures Lara that the child would have a decided advantage on Earth since the planet's yellow sun and lighter gravity would give him extraordinary powers, making him completely invulnerable. After an emotional farewell, Jor-El launches the spacecraft which safely leaves Krypton's galaxy. Shortly thereafter, Krypton is destroyed.

After traveling thousands of lightyears to Earth, the ship crashes near an American farming town, [[Smallville (DC Comics)|Smallville]], [[Kansas]], where the infant Kal-El is found by [[Ma and Pa Kent|Jonathan and Martha Kent]]  who were investigating the crash site after the ship narrowly missed them as they were driving home. The couple decide to take the child home with them after witnessing the child easily lift the rear of Jonathan's pick-up truck, saving Jonathan's life before the truck can crash upon him while he repairs a flat tire. Giving the child Martha's maiden name Clark, the couple lovingly raise the child as thier own son.  

14 years later, the now-teenaged Clark exhibits other extraordinary powers, outrunning speeding trains, and punting a football into the stratosphere. Shortly afterward, Jonathan Kent offers his son his own brand of fatherly advice before dying of a heart attack. Clark, stunned by the fact that he can now do nothing, is devastated. 

Sometime following Jonathan's funeral, Clark hears a psychic "call", which soon summons him to the family barn where he then discovers a glowing green crystal --- the last surviving remnant from the ship from Krypton, which the boy somehow manged to store safely beneath the barn.

Compelled to travel north, Clark emotionally bids Martha Kent farewell before beginning his journey to the [[Arctic Circle]]. Tossing the crystal an extreme distance, Clark watches in awe as its magic builds the [[Fortress of Solitude]], resembling the architecture of Krypton. Upon entering the now-constructed Fortress, Clark activates a control panel, triggering the appearance of a vision of Jor-El, who states: "By now, you will have reached your 18th year as it is measured on Earth. By that reckoning, I shall have been dead for many thousands of your years." (This means that a year in Earth's time translates to a thousand or more years in Kryptonian time, or perhaps according to [[Einstein]] and his theory of time and relativity (a theory taught to the young Kal-El while he was in the capsule traveling to Earth), that Kal-El's journey to Earth would have only aged him by about 3 or 4 years; and yet it took many thousands of years to make the trip.) Jor-El now gives Clark background into his origins, educating him in his powers and responsibilities. After 12 years, with his powers fully developed, and now wearing the familiar blue and red caped costume made with his swaddling cloths from his infancy, Clark leaves the Fortress and finds a job at ''[[The Daily Planet]]'' in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]. He meets and develops a romantic attraction to reporter [[Lois Lane]], but the feelings are not returned: she regards him as merely a friend. Lois, while traveling to an assignment, becomes involved in a helicopter accident where conventional means of rescue are impossible, requiring Clark to publicly use his powers for the first time to save her. Lois asks him who he is to which he simply replies, "A friend." Clark then patrols all over the city, thwarting robberies, capturing criminals in spectacular fashion and even preventing the Presidential plane, ''[[Air Force One]]'', from crashing in a severe storm. As the next morning dawns, his heroic exploits have made Clark a media sensation, as everyone is fascinated of him, especially Lois, as a man who can fly without aid and apparently with powers far beyond of any mortal.

Later, Clark secretly leaves a note for Lois that he wants to meet her at her home and signs it "A friend."  Later, he arrives at Lois' penthouse apartment and allows her to interview him for a newspaper article. He then takes Lois on a nighttime flight above Metropolis.  As the romantic flight ends, Lois mutters to herself: "What a super man," and thus is inspired to dub him "Superman." Meanwhile, criminal genius [[Lex Luthor]] has developed a cunning plan to make a fortune in real estate by buying large amounts of "worthless" desert land and then diverting a nuclear rocket from a missile testing site to the [[San Andreas Fault]]. This will destroy [[California]] killing millions of people and leave Luthor's desert as the new [[West Coast of the United States]], greatly increasing its [[real estate]] value. After his incompetent henchman Otis accidentally redirects the first rocket to the wrong place, Luthor's girlfriend, Eve Teschmacher, successfully changes the course of the second missile. Knowing Superman could stop his plan and seeing him as a worthy adversary, Luthor lures him to his underground lair via a [[supersonic]] greeting threatening the city and exposes him to [[Kryptonite]]. As Superman weakens, Luthor taunts him by revealing the first missile is headed to [[Hackensack, New Jersey]], in the opposite direction, knowing Superman could not stop both impacts.

Teschmacher is horrified because her mother lives in Hackensack, but Luthor does not care and leaves Superman to a slow death. Teschmacher rescues Superman on the condition that he will deal with the New Jersey missile first. He is consequently too late to stop the second impact, causing a massive earthquake which he battles to correct. While he is busy saving others, Lois' car falls into the ground as a result of an aftershock, and quickly begins to fill with dirt and debris, which suffocates her to death. Distraught at being unable to save Lois, Superman ignores Jor-El's warning not to interfere with human history, preferring to remember Jonathan Kent's advice that he must be here for "a reason." Flying at incredible speed, Superman circles the Earth, creating a force that reverses Earths spin thus reversing all the events that led to Lois' death. Satisfied that all has been restored, Superman returns Earth to its normal spin. After making sure Lois was alive and well,  Superman then delivers Luthor and Otis to prison, where he believes that they would be secure until they receive a [[right to a fair trial|fair trial]]. Superman then soars into the night sky to his next adventure.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
[[Ilya Salkind]] had first conceived the idea for a Superman film in late 1973.<ref name=one>{{cite news | author = Barry Freiman | url = http://www.supermanhomepage.com/movies/movies.php?topic=interview-salkind | title = One-on-One Interview with Producer Ilya Salkind | work = Superman Homepage | date = February 2006 | accessdate = 2008-09-09}}</ref> In November 1974, after a long difficult process with [[DC Comics]], the Superman [[film rights]] were purchased by Ilya, his father [[Alexander Salkind]], and their partner [[Pierre Spengler]]. DC wanted a list of actors that were to be considered for Superman. They approved the producer's choices of [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Al Pacino]], [[James Caan]], [[Steve McQueen (actor)|Steve McQueen]], [[Clint Eastwood]] and [[Dustin Hoffman]].<ref name=saga>[[Richard Donner]], [[Tom Mankiewicz]], [[Ilya Salkind]], [[Pierre Spengler]], [[David Prowse]], ''You Will Believe: The Cinematic Saga of Superman'', 2006, [[Warner Home Video]]</ref> The filmmakers felt it was best to film ''Superman'' and ''[[Superman II]]'' back-to-back, simultaneously, and to make a [[negative pickup deal]] with [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]].<ref name=flight>[[Richard Donner]], [[Tom Mankiewicz]], [[Christopher Reeve]], [[Margot Kidder]], Lynn Stalmaster, [[Marc McClure]], Taking Flight: The Development of ''Superman'', 2001, [[Warner Home Video]]</ref> [[William Goldman]] was approached to write the screenplay, while [[Leigh Brackett]] was considered. Ilya hired [[Alfred Bester]], who began writing a [[film treatment]]. Alexander felt, however, that Bester was not famous enough, and so hired [[Mario Puzo]] (''[[The Godfather]]'') to write the screenplay at a $600,000 salary.<ref name=life>{{cite book | author=[[Julius Schwartz]]; Brian M.

Peckinpah dropped out when he produced a gun during a meeting with Ilya. [[George Lucas]] turned down the offer because of his commitment to ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]''.<ref name=Ilya/><ref name=one/>

During the filming of ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', [[Steven Spielberg]] expressed interest in directing ''Superman''. Ilya was enthusiastic to hire Spielberg, but Alexander was skeptical, feeling it was best to wait for the release "of that fish movie of his". ''Jaws'' was released with [[box office]] success, prompting the producers to offer Spielberg the position, but by then Spielberg had already committed to ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]''.<ref name="one" /> [[Guy Hamilton]] was hired as director, while Puzo delivered his 500-page script for ''Superman'' and ''Superman II'' in July 1975.<ref name="flight" /> [[Jax-Ur]] appeared as one of [[General Zod]]'s [[henchman]], with [[Clark Kent]] written as a television reporter. Dustin Hoffman, who was previously considered for Superman, turned down [[Lex Luthor]].<ref name="saga" /><ref name="life" /> It was decided to first sign an [[A-list]] actor for Superman. [[Robert Redford]] was offered a lot of money, but felt he was too famous. [[Burt Reynolds]] also turned down the role, while [[Sylvester Stallone]] was interested, but nothing ever came of it. [[Paul Newman]] was offered his choosing as Superman, Lex Luthor or Jor-El for $4 million, turning down all three roles.<ref name="Ilya" />

In early 1975, [[Marlon Brando]] signed on as Jor-El with a salary of $3.7 million and 11.75% of the box office gross profits, totaling $19 million. Brando hoped to use some of his salary for a proposed 13-part ''[[Roots (TV miniseries)|Roots]]''-style [[miniseries]] on [[Native Americans in the United States]].<ref>{{cite book | author= Peter Manso| title = Brando the Biography | publisher =[[Hyperion (publisher)|Hyperion]] | month = November | year = 1995 | location = | isbn = 0786881283 | chapter = The Way It's Never Been Done Before}}</ref> Brando had it in his contract to complete all of his scenes in 12 days. He also refused to memorize his dialog, so [[cue card]]s were compiled across the set. [[Gene Hackman]] was cast as Lex Luthor days later. The filmmakers made it a priority to shoot all of Brando and Hackman's footage "because they would be committed to other films immediately".<ref name="flight" /><ref name="one" /> Puzo's scripts were too [[epic film|epic]], bringing [[Robert Benton]] and [[David Newman (filmmaker)|David Newman]] for rewrite work.

Their script was submitted in July 1976,<ref name="flight" /> and carried a [[camp (style)|camp]] tone, including a [[cameo appearance]] by [[Telly Savalas]] as his ''[[Kojak]]'' character. The scripts for ''Superman'' and ''Superman II'' were now at over 400-pages combined.<ref name=Dick>{{cite news | author = Daniel Dickholtz | title = Steel Dreams: Interview with Tom Mankiewicz | work = [[Starlog]] | date = 1998-12-16 | pages = 67&mdash;71 | accessdate = 2008-09-01}}</ref><ref name="Kroll">{{cite news | author = Jack Kroll | title = ''Superman'' to the Rescue | work = [[Newsweek]] | date = 1979-01-01 | pages = 34&mdash;41 | accessdate = 2008-09-08}}</ref> [[Pre-production]] started in [[Rome]], with sets starting construction and flying tests being unsuccessfully experimented.

Production moved to England in late-1976, but Hamilton could not join because he was a [[tax exile]].<ref name="Dick" />

[[Mark Robson]] became in talks to direct, but after seeing ''[[The Omen]]'', the producers hired [[Richard Donner]]. Donner had previously been planning ''[[Damien: Omen II]]'' when he was hired in January 1977 for $1 million to direct ''Superman'' and ''Superman II''.<ref name="Hughes" /> Donner felt it was best to start from scratch. "They had prepared the picture for a year and not one bit was useful to me."<ref name="Hughes">{{cite book | author=David Hughes | title =Comic Book Movies | publisher =[[Virgin Books]] | year =2003 | location = | pages = 5–23 | isbn = 0753507676| chapter = Superman: The Movie}}</ref> Donner was dissatisfied with the campy script and brought [[Tom Mankiewicz]] to perform a rewrite. According to Mankiewicz "not a word from the Puzo script was used".<ref name="Dick" /> "It was a well-written, but still a ridiculous script. It was 550 pages. I said, 'You can't shoot this screenplay because you'll be shooting for five years'," Donner continued. "That was literally a [[shooting script]] and they planned to shoot all 550 pages. You know, 110 pages is plenty for a script, so even for two features, that was way too much."<ref name=cine>{{cite news | author = Don Shay | title = Richard Donner on ''Superman'' | work = [[Cinefantastique]] | date = Summer 1979 | pages = 26&mdash;36 | accessdate = 2008-09-07}}</ref> Mankiewicz conceived having each Kryptonian family wear a [[crest (heraldry)|crest]] resembling a different letter, justifying the 'S' on Superman's costume.<ref name="Hughes" /> The [[Writers Guild of America]] refused to credit Mankiewicz for his rewrites, so Donner gave him a [[creative consultant]] credit, much to the annoyance from the Guild.<ref name="Hughes" />

=== Filming ===
[[Principal photography]] began on March 24, 1977 at [[Pinewood Studios]] for [[Krypton]] scenes, budgeted as the most expensive film ever made at that point. Since ''Superman'' was being shot simultaneously with ''[[Superman II]]'', filming lasted for 19 months, until October 1978. Filming was originally scheduled to last between 7 and 8 months, but problems rose during production. [[John Barry (set designer)|John Barry]] served as [[production designer]], while [[Stuart Craig]] and [[Norman Reynolds]] worked as [[art director]]s. [[Derek Meddings]] and [[Les Bowie]] were credited as [[visual effects supervisor]]s. [[Stuart Freeborn]] was the [[make-up artist]], while Barry, [[David Lane (director)|David Lane]], [[Peter MacDonald (film director)|Peter MacDonald]] and [[John Glen]] directed [[second unit]] scenes. [[Vic Armstrong]] was hired as the [[stunt coordinator]] and Reeve's [[stunt double]], his wife Wendy Leech was [[Margot Kidder]]'s double. ''Superman'' was also the final complete film by [[cinematographer]] [[Geoffrey Unsworth]], who died during post-production while working on ''[[Tess (film)|Tess]]'' for director [[Roman Polanski]]. The [[Fortress of Solitude]] was constructed at [[Shepperton Studios]] and at Pinewood's [[007 Stage]].<ref name=legend>Making ''Superman'': Filming The Legend, 2001, [[Warner Home Video]]</ref><ref name=look>[[Look, Up in the Sky: The Amazing Story of Superman]], 2006, [[Warner Home Video]]</ref> Upon viewing the footage of Krypton, [[Warner Bros.]] decided to distribute in not only North America, but also in foreign countries. Due to complications and problems during filming, Warners also supplied $20 million and acquired [[broadcasting|television rights]].<ref name=market/><ref name=legend/> 

[[New York City]] doubled for [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], while the [[Daily News (New York)|''New York Daily News'']] Building served as the location for the offices of the ''[[Daily Planet]]''. [[Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn|Brooklyn Heights]] was also used.<ref>{{cite news | author = Peter Coutros | title = Clark Kent Uses Our Lobby for a Phone Booth | work = [[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] | date = June 1977 | accessdate = 2008-09-05}}</ref> Filming in New York lasted 5 weeks, during the time of the [[New York City blackout of 1977]]. Production moved to [[Alberta]], [[Canada]] for scenes set in [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]], with the cemetery scene filmed in the canyon of [[Beynon, Alberta]], the high school football scenes at [[Barons, Alberta]], and the Kent farm constructed at [[Blackie, Alberta]].<ref>The Making of Superman the Movie, David Michael Petrou, New York:Warner Books, 1978.</ref>  Brief filming also took place in [[Gallup, New Mexico]], [[Lake Mead]] and [[Grand Central Terminal]].<ref name=comment/> Director Richard Donner had tensions with the Salkinds and Spengler concerning the escalating production budget and the [[shooting schedule]]. [[Creative consultant]] [[Tom Mankiewicz]] reflected, "Donner never got a budget or a schedule. He was constantly told he was way over schedule and budget. At one point he said, 'Why don't you just schedule the film for the next 2 days, and then I'll be 9 months over?'."<ref name=legend/> [[Richard Lester]], who worked with the Salkinds on ''[[The Three Musketeers (1973 film)|The Three Musketeers]]'' and ''[[The Four Musketeers (film)|The Four Musketeers]]'', was then brought in as a temporary associate producer to mediate the relationship between Donner and the Salkinds,<ref name=one/> who by now were refusing to talk to each other.<ref name=legend/> With his relationship with Spengler, Donner remarked, "At one time if I'd seen him, I would have killed him."<ref name=market/> Superman would go on to make $300.22 million making it the second highest grossing movie of 1978 behind ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]''.

Lester was offered producing credit but refused, going uncredited for his work.<ref name="legend"/> Salkind felt that bringing a second director onto the set meant there would be someone ready in the event that Donner couldn't fulfill his directing duties. "Being there all the time meant he [Lester] could take over," Salkind admitted. "[Donner] couldn't make up his mind on stuff."<ref name="one" /> On Lester, Donner reflected, "He'd been suing the Salkinds for his money on ''Three'' and ''Four Musketeers'', which he'd never gotten. He won a lot of his lawsuits, but each time he sued the Salkinds in one country, they'd move to another, from Costa Rica to Panama to Switzerland. When I was hired, Lester told me, 'Don't do it. Don't work for them. I was told not to, but I did it. Now I'm telling you not to, but you'll probably do it and end up telling the next guy.' Lester came in as a 'go-between'. I didn't trust Lester, and I told him. He said, 'Believe me, I'm only doing it because they're paying me the money that they owe me from the lawsuit. I'll never come onto your set unless you ask me; I'll never go to your [[dailies]]. If I can help you in any way, call me."<ref name="cine" />

It was decided to stop shooting ''Superman II'' and focus on finishing ''Superman''. Donner had already completed 75% of the sequel.<ref>{{cite news | author = Richard Fyrbourne | title = The Man Behind ''Superman'': Richard Donner | work = [[Starlog]] | date = January 1979 | pages = 40&mdash;44 | accessdate = 2008-09-07}}</ref> The filmmakers took a risk: if ''Superman'' was a [[box office bomb]], they would not finish ''Superman II''. The original [[climax (narrative)|climax]] for ''Superman II'' had [[General Zod]], [[Ursa (comics)|Ursa]] and [[Non (DC Comics)|Non]] destroying the planet, with Superman [[time travel]]ing to fix the damage.<ref name="Ilya" /> On the original ending for ''Superman'', [[Lex Luthor]] and [[Otis (Superman)|Otis]] were put in prison, with the nuclear missile that Superman did not counter against flying in [[outer space]]. The missile would strike the [[Phantom Zone]], freeing the three Kryptonian villains. Donner commented, "I decided if ''Superman'' is a success, they're going to do a sequel. If it ain't a success, a [[cliffhanger]] ain't gonna bring them to see ''Superman II''."<ref name=Hughes/>

''Superman'' is well-known for its large-scale [[visual effects]] sequences, all of which were created before the [[computer-generated imagery|digital age]]. The [[Golden Gate Bridge]] [[scale model]] stood 70 feet long and 20 feet wide. Other miniatures included the Krypton Council Dome and the [[Hoover Dam]]. [[Slow motion]] was used to simulate the vast amount of water for the Hoover Dam destruction. The [[Fortress of Solitude]] was a combination of a full-scale set and [[matte painting]]s. [[Superboy (Kal-El)|Young Clark Kent]]'s long-distance [[Punt (football)|football punt]] was executed with a wooden football loaded into an [[air blaster]] placed in the ground. The Superman costume was to be a much darker blue, but the use of [[chroma key|blue screen]] made it [[transparency (optics)|transparent]].<ref name=magic>The Magic Behind The Cape, 2001, [[Warner Home Video]]</ref>

The first test for the flying sequences involved simply catapulting a [[crash test dummy]] out of a cannon. Another technique had a remote control cast of Superman flying around. Both were discarded due to lack of movement. High quality, realistic-looking animation was tried, with speed trails added to make the effect more convincing.

As detailed in the Superman: The Movie DVD special effects documentary 'The Magic Behind The Cape', presented by optical effects supervisor Roy Field,  in the end, three techniques were used to achieve the flying effects.

For landings and take-offs, wire flying riggings were devised and used. On location, these were suspended from tower cranes, whereas in the studio elaborate rigs were suspended from the studio ceilings. Some of the wire-flying work was quite audacious considering computer controlled rigs were not then available -- the penultimate shot where Superman flies out of the prison yard for example.  Although stuntmen were used, Christopher Reeve did much of the work himself, and was suspended as high as 50ft in the air. Counterweights and pulleys were typically used to achieve flying movement rather than electronic or motorised devices. 

For shots where the camera is stationary and Superman is seen flying towards or away from the camera in the frame, blue screen matte shots were used. Reeve would be photographed against a blue screen. While a special device made his cape flap to give the illusion of movement, the actor himself would remain stationary. Instead, the camera would use a mixture of long zoom-ins and zoom-outs to cause him to become larger or smaller in the frame. The blue background would then be photochemically removed and Reeve's isolated image would then be 'inserted' in to a matted area of a background plate shot.  The zoom-ins or zoom-outs would give the appearance of flying away or towards the contents of the background plate. The disparity in lighting and colour between the matted image and the background plate, the occassional presence of black matte lines (where the matte area and the matted image -- in the case Superman -- don't exactly match-up) and the slightly unconvincing impression of movement achieved through the use of long zoom lenses is characteristic of these shots. 

For shots where the camera is tracking with Superman as he flies (such as in the Superman and Lois Metropolis flying sequence) front projection was used.  This involved photographing the actors suspended in front of a background image dimly projected from the front on to a special screen made by 3M that would reflect light back at many times the original intensity directly in to a combined camera/projector. The result was a very clear and intense photographic reproduction of both the actors and the background plate with far less of the image deterioration or lighting problems than occur with rear projection.  

A technique was developed that combined the [[front projection effect]] with specially designed [[zoom lens]]es.<ref name=magic/> The illusion of movement was created by zooming in on Christopher Reeve while making the front projected image appear to recede. For scenes where Superman interacts with other people or objects while in flight, Reeve and actors were put in a variety of rigging equipment with careful lighting and photography.<ref name=magic/> This also led to the creation of the [[Zoptic]] system.<ref>{{cite news | author = Nicholas Leahy | title = How Superman flies | work = [[Starburst (magazine)|Starburst]] | date = April 1982 | pages = 16&mdash;19 | accessdate = 2008-09-05}}</ref>

The highly reflective costumes worn by the Kryptonians were the result of an accident during Superman flying tests. "We noticed the material lit up on its own," Donner explained. "We tore the material into tiny pieces and glued it on the costumes, designing a front projection effect for each camera. There was a little light on each camera, and it would project into a mirror, bounce out in front of the lens, hit the costume, [and] millions of little glass heads would light up and bring the image back into the camera."<ref name=Hughes/>

=== Music ===
[[Jerry Goldsmith]], who scored Donner's ''[[The Omen]]'', was originally set to compose ''Superman''. Portions of Goldsmith's work from ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' were used in ''Superman'''s teaser trailer. He dropped out over scheduling conflicts and [[John Williams]] was hired.<ref name=Ilya>[[Ilya Salkind]], [[Pierre Spengler]], DVD [[audio commentary]], 2006, [[Warner Home Video]]</ref> Kidder was supposed to sing "[[Can You Read My Mind]]", the lyrics to which were written by [[Leslie Bricusse]], but Donner disliked it and changed it to a composition accompanied by a voiceover.<ref name=comment/>

''Superman'' is divided into three basic sections, each with three distinct themes and visual styles. The first segment, set on Krypton, is meant to be typical of [[science fiction film]]s, but also lays the groundwork for the Jesus Christ analogy that emerges in the relationship between Jor-El and Kal-El. The second segment, set in Smallville, is reminiscent of 1950s films, and its small-town atmosphere is meant to evoke a [[Norman Rockwell]] painting. The third (and largest) segment was an attempt to present the superhero story with as much realism as possible (what Donner called "verisimilitude"), relying on traditional cinematic drama and using only subtle humor instead of a [[camp (style)|campy]] approach.<ref name=comment>[[Richard Donner]], [[Tom Mankiewicz]], DVD [[audio commentary]], 2001, [[Warner Home Video]]</ref>

[[Richard Donner]], [[Tom Mankiewicz]] and [[Ilya Salkind]] have commented on the use of [[religious perspectives on Jesus|Christian references]] to discuss the themes of ''Superman''.<ref name="comment"/><ref name=Ilya/> Mankiewicz deliberately fostered analogies with Jor-El ([[El (god)|God]]) and [[Superman|Kal-El]] ([[Jesus]]).<ref name=Dick/> Donner is somewhat skeptical of Mankiewicz' actions, joking "I got enough [[death threat]]s because of that."<ref name=comment/>

Several concepts and items of imagery have been used in [[Bible|Biblical]] comparisons. Jor-El casts out [[General Zod]] from [[Krypton]], a parallel to [[War in Heaven|the casting out]] of [[Satan]] from [[Heaven]].<ref name=comment/> The [[spacecraft]] that brings Kal-El to Earth is in the form of a star ([[Star of Bethlehem]]). Kal-El comes to [[Ma and Pa Kent|Jonathan and Martha Kent]], who are unable to have children. [[Martha Kent]] states, "All these years how we've prayed and prayed that the good Lord would see fit to give us a child," which was compared to [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|the Virgin Mary]].<ref name=comment/>

Just as little is known about Jesus during his middle years, Clark travels into the wilderness to find out who he is and what he has to do. Jor-El says, "Live as one of them, Kal-El, to discover where your strength and power are needed. But always hold in your heart the pride of your special heritage. They can be a great people, Kal-El, they wish to be. They only lack a light to show the way. For this reason above all, their capacity for good, I have sent them you..... my only son."<ref name=comment/> The theme resembles the Biblical account of God sending his only son [[Jesus]] to Earth in hope for the good of mankind. More were seen when Donner was able to complete ''[[Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut]]'', featuring [[Crucifixion of Jesus|the fall]], [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] and his [[Harrowing of Hell|battle with evil]]. Another vision was that of ''[[The Creation of Adam]]''.<ref name=comment/>

The Christian imagery in the Reeve films has provoked comment on the Jewish origins of Superman. Rabbi [[Simcha Weinstein]]'s book ''[[Up, Up and Oy Vey]]: How Jewish History, Culture and Values Shaped the Comic Book Superhero'', says that Superman is both a pillar of society and one whose cape conceals a "nebbish", saying "He's a bumbling, nebbish Jewish stereotype. He's [[Woody Allen]]."<ref name=neb>{{cite news | author = Michael Elkin | title = Super ... Mensch? | url = http://www.jewishexponent.com/article/10036 | work = [[The Jewish Exponent]] | date = 2006-07-06 | accessdate = 2008-11-01}}</ref><ref name=Allen>{{cite news | work = Contact Music | url = http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/superman%20is%20jewish_1000359 | title = Clark Kent - Superman is 'Jewish' | date = 2006-06-20 | accessdate = 2008-11-01}}</ref> Ironically, it is also in the Reeve films that Clark Kent's persona has the greatest resemblance to Woody Allen, though his conscious model was Cary Grant's character in ''Bringing up Baby''. This same theme is pursued about '40s superheroes generally in ''Disguised as Clark Kent: Jews, Comics, and the Creation of the Superhero'' by Danny Fingeroth.<ref name=neb/><ref name=Allen/>

In the scene where [[Lois Lane]] interviews Superman on the balcony, Superman replies, "I never lie." Salkind felt this was an important point in the film, since Superman, living under his [[secret identity]] as [[Clark Kent]], is "telling the biggest lie of all time." [[Relationship of Clark Kent and Lois Lane|His romance with Lois]] also leads him to contradict Jor-El's orders to avoid [[alternate history|altering human history]], [[time travel]]ing to save her from dying. Superman instead takes the advice of Jonathan Kent, his father on Earth.<ref name=Ilya/>

== Release ==
''Superman'' was originally scheduled to be released in June 1978, but the problems during filming pushed the film back by 6 months. Due to the rushed [[post-production]], no [[premiere]] took place. Editor [[Stuart Baird]] reflected, "Filming was finished in October 1978 and it is a miracle we had the film released 3 months later. Big-budgeted films today tend to take 6 to 8 months."<ref name=legend/> Donner, for his part, wished that he'd "had another 6 months; I would have perfected a lot of things. But at some point, you've gotta turn the picture over."<ref name=cine/> Warner Bros. spent $7 million to market and promote the film.<ref name=market>{{cite news | author = Ivor Davis | title = Marketing The Man of Steel | work = [[Maclean's]] | date = December 1978 | pages = 22&mdash;26 | accessdate = 2008-09-05}}</ref> 

''Superman'' opened on December 15, 1978 in America, grossing $134.22 million in North America and $166 million in foreign countries, totaling $300.22 million worldwide. The film was declared a financial success since it beat its $55 million budget.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=superman.htm | title = Superman (1978) | work = [[Box Office Mojo]] | accessdate = 2008-09-01}}</ref> ''Superman'' was the sixth-highest grossing film at the time of its release, as well as [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]]' most successful (which has since been beaten).<ref name=legend/> Based on 46 reviews collected by ''[[Rotten Tomatoes]]'', 93% of reviewers enjoyed ''Superman'', with the consensus "''Superman'' deftly blends humor and gravitas, taking advantage of the perfectly cast [[Christopher Reeve]] to craft a loving, nostalgic tribute to an American pop culture icon."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/superman_the_movie/ | title = Superman: The Movie (1978) | work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate = 2008-09-01}}</ref> By comparison ''[[Metacritic]]'' collected an average score of 88, based on 12 reviews.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/supermanthemovie?q=Superman | title = Superman: The Movie (1978): Reviews | work = [[Metacritic]] | accessdate = 2008-09-01}}</ref> Superman creators [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]] gave a positive reaction.<ref name=saga/> Shuster was "delighted to see Superman on the screen. I got chills. Chris Reeve has just the right touch of humor. He really is Superman."<ref name=Kroll/>

[[Roger Ebert]] gave a largely positive review. "''Superman'' is a pure delight, a wondrous combination of all the old-fashioned things we never really get tired of: adventure and romance, heroes and villains, earthshaking special effects and wit. Christopher Reeve is perfectly cast in the role. Any poor choice would have ruined the film."<ref>{{cite web | title = Superman | work = [[Roger Ebert]] | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19781215/REVIEWS/41011001/1023 | accessdate = 2008-09-01}}</ref> [[James Berardinelli]] believed "there's no doubt that it's a flawed movie, but it's one of the most wonderfully entertaining flawed movies made during the 1970s. It's exactly what comic book fans hoped it would be. Perhaps most heartening of all, however, is the message at the end of the credits announcing the impending arrival of ''[[Superman II]]''."<ref>{{cite web | title = Superman | url = http://www.reelviews.net/php_review_template.php?identifier=736 | work = [[James Berardinelli]] | accessdate = 2008-09-01}}</ref> [[Harry Knowles]] is a longtime fan of the film, but was critical of elements that didn't represent the Superman stories as seen in the comics.<ref>{{cite news | author = [[Harry Knowles]] | url = http://www.aintitcool.com/display.cgi?id=13404 | title = Harry talks with JJ Abrams for a Couple of Hours about ''Superman'' | work = [[Ain't It Cool News]] | date = 2002-09-28 | accessdate = 2008-09-01}}</ref> [[Dave Kehr]] felt "the tone, style, and point of view change almost from shot to shot. This is the definitive corporate film. It is best when it takes itself seriously, worst when it takes the easy way out in giggly camp, When Lex Luthor enters the action, Gene Hackman plays the arch-villain like a hairdresser left over from a TV skit."<ref>{{cite news | author = [[Dave Kehr]] | url = http://onfilm.chicagoreader.com/movies/capsules/11755_SUPERMAN | title = Superman | work = [[Chicago Reader]] | accessdate = 2008-09-01}}</ref>

=== Legacy ===
''Superman'' was nominated for three [[Academy Awards]] ([[Academy Award for Film Editing|Editing]], [[Academy Award for Original Music Score|Music (Original Score)]] and [[Academy Award for Sound Editing|Sound]]), and received a [[Academy Special Achievement Award|Special Achievement Award]] for its [[visual effects]]. Donner publicly expressed disgust that [[production designer]] [[John Barry (set designer)|John Barry]] and [[cinematographer]] [[Geoffrey Unsworth]] had not been recognized.<ref name=Hughes/> 

''Superman'' was successful at the [[32nd British Academy Film Awards]]. Reeve won [[BAFTA Award for Best Newcomer|Best Newcomer]], while [[Gene Hackman]], Unsworth, Barry and the [[sound design]]ers earned nominations.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://imdb.com/Sections/Awards/BAFTA_Awards/1979 | title = 32nd British Academy Film Awards | work = [[Internet Movie Database]] | accessdate = 2008-01-06}}</ref> The film won the [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation]].<ref>{{cite web |title = The 1979 Hugo Awards | work = [[Internet Movie Database]] | url = http://imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Hugo_Awards/1979 | accessdate = 2008-01-06}}</ref> At The [[Saturn Award]]s [[Margot Kidder]], Barry, [[John Williams]] and the [[visual effects]] department received awards, and the film won [[Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film|Best Science Fiction Film]].

With the success of the film, it was immediately decided to finish ''[[Superman II]]''. [[Ilya Salkind|Ilya]] and [[Alexander Salkind]] and [[Pierre Spengler]] did not ask [[Richard Donner]] to return because Donner had criticized them during the movie's  [[publicity]] phase.<ref name=Ilya/> Donner commented in January 1979, "I'd work with Spengler again, but only on my terms. As long as he has nothing to say as the producer, and is just liaison between Alexander Salkind and his money, that's fine. If they don't want it on those terms, then they need to go out and find another director, it sure as shit ain't gonna be me."<ref name=cine/> [[Margot Kidder]], who portrayed [[Lois Lane]], was dissatisfied by the producers' decision,<ref name=legend/> and also criticized the Salkinds during publicity. As a result, Kidder was only given a [[cameo appearance]] for ''Superman III'', and not a main supporting role.<ref>{{cite news | author = Barry Freiman | url = http://www.supermanhomepage.com/movies/movies.php?topic=interview-expo-kidder | title = One-on-One with Margot Kidder | work = Superman Homepage | date = 2005-02-08 | accessdate = 2008-09-09}}</ref> [[Jack O'Halloran]], who portrayed [[Non (DC Comics)|Non]], stated, "It was great to work with Donner. Richard Lester was as big an asshole as the Salkinds."<ref>{{cite news | author = Steve Younis | url = http://www.supermanhomepage.com/movies/movies.php?topic=interview-jack-ohalloran | title = Exclusive Jack O'Halloran Interview | work = Superman Homepage | date = 2001-10-25 | accessdate = 2008-09-10}}</ref> Two more films, ''[[Superman III]]'' (1983) and ''[[Superman IV: The Quest for Peace]]'' (1987), were produced. ''[[Superman Returns]]'' was released in 2006. Director [[Bryan Singer]] credited ''Superman: The Movie'' as an influence for ''Superman Returns'', and even used restored footage of Marlon Brando as Jor-El. ''[[Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut]]'' also was released in 2006.<ref name=look/>

The film's final sequence, which features Superman flying high above the Earth at sunrise, and breaking the [[fourth wall]] to smile briefly at the camera, featured at the end of every Superman film starring Christopher Reeve, and was reshot with [[Brandon Routh]] for [[Superman Returns]].

Alongside ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', ''Superman'' created a reemergence of [[science fiction film]]s. ''Superman'' also established the [[superhero film]] genre as viable outside the world of Saturday matinee serials, although it was a decade before the comparable success of the ''Batman'' series and two decades before that of ''X-Men'' and ''Spider-Man''.<ref name=Ilya/>

=== Beyond theatrical release ===
The [[American Broadcasting Company]] aired the television debut of ''Superman'' in 1981, adding over 30 minutes of footage not seen in theaters. A syndicated version of the film aired in local television stations in [[Los Angeles, California]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] in the 1990s included most of this added footage and two additional scenes never seen before.<ref name=DVD>{{cite news | author = Barry Freiman | url = http://www.supermanhomepage.com/movies/movies.php?topic=interview-salkind-SE | title = Special Edition Superman DVDs on the Way | work = Superman Homepage | date = January 2006 | accessdate = 2008-09-08}}</ref> When [[Michael Thau]] and [[Warner Home Video]] started working on a [[film restoration]] in 2000, some of the extra footage was not added because of poor visual effects. Thau felt "the pace of the film's storyline would be adversely affected. This included timing problems with John William's musical score. The cut of the movie shown on TV was put together to make the movie longer when shown on TV because ABC paid per minute to air the movie. The [[special edition]] cut is designed for the best viewing experience in the true spirit of movie making."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.supermanhomepage.com/movies/movies.php?topic=interview-michael-thau1 | title = Superman "Special Edition" Interview | work = Superman Homepage | accessdate = 2008-09-10}}</ref> There was a special test screening of the Special Edition in 2001 in Austin, Texas, on March 23 with plans for a possible wider theatrical release later that year, which did not occur.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.supermanhomepage.com/news/2001-news/2001-news-movie.php?topic=2001-news-movie/0329|date=2001-03-29|author=Jim Bowers|title=Superman San Antonio Report|work=Superman Homepage|accessdate=2009-04-20}}</ref> In May 2001, Warner Home Video released the special edition on DVD.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.amazon.com/Superman-Movie-Vass-Anderson/dp/B000059Z8J/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1220808567&sr=1-3 | title = Superman: The Movie (1978) | work = [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] | accessdate = 2008-09-07}}</ref> Director Richard Donner also assisted, working slightly over a year on the project. The release included [[making-of]] documentaries directed by Thau and eight minutes of restored footage.<ref name=plot/>

Thau explained, "I worked on ''[[Ladyhawke]]'' and that's how I met Donner and [[Tom Mankiewicz]]. I used to hear those wonderful stories in the cutting room that Tom, Donner and [[Stuart Baird|Stuart]] would tell about ''Superman'' and that's how I kind of got the ideas for the plots of ''Taking Flight'' and ''Making Superman''.<ref name=plot>{{cite news | author = Barry Freiman | url = http://www.supermanhomepage.com/movies/movies.php?topic=interview-michael-thau2 | title = Interview with Michael Thau | work = Superman Homepage | date = December 2006 | accessdate = 2008-09-07}}</ref> Donner commented, "There were a few shots where the Superman costume looked green.

I also wanted to take out where it was just generic action. It was like a two minute car chase.
