'''''Superman''''', also known as '''''Superman: The Movie''''', is a [[superhero]] [[film|movie]], released by [[Warner Bros.]] in [[1978 in film|1978]], and based on the popular [[DC Comics]] [[Superman|character of the same name]].

[[Christopher Reeve]] starred in the title role and that of [[Clark Kent]], while top-billed [[Marlon Brando]] played Superman's father, [[Jor-El]], for a salary, record-setting at the time, of $3,700,000 for eight minutes of screen time; other prominent cast members were [[Gene Hackman]] as [[Lex Luthor]], [[Margot Kidder]] as [[Lois Lane]], [[Ned Beatty]] as Otis, [[Jackie Cooper]] as Perry White, [[Glenn Ford]] as [[Jonathan Kent|Pa Kent]], [[Valerie Perrine]] as Eve Teschmacher, [[Marc McClure]] as [[Jimmy Olsen]], and [[Jeff East]] as the young [[Clark Kent]]. It was directed by [[Richard Donner]] and executive produced by [[Ilya Salkind]], with music by [[John Williams (composer)|John Williams]].

''Superman'' received a "Special Achievement" [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]]. It was nominated for [[Academy Award for Film Editing|Best Film Editing]], [[Academy Award for Original Music Score|Best Music, Original Score]] and [[Academy Award for Sound|Best Sound]]. 

The movie led to three theatrical [[sequel|sequels]], ''[[Superman II]]'' ([[1980 in film|1980]]), ''[[Superman III]]'' ([[1983 in film|1983]]) and ''[[Superman IV: The Quest For Peace]]'' ([[1987 in film|1987]]) and inspired the Salkind-backed ''[[Supergirl (movie)|Supergirl]]'' ([[1984 in film|1984]]). The upcoming ''[[Superman Returns]]'' will be reportedly based on the continuity of the 1978 movie, and will include footage with Marlon Brando as Jor-El that was shot during ''Superman: The Movie'''s production that was to be used in ''Superman II''.

==Production History==
Although [[Warner Brothers]] had acquired [[DC Comics]] in the 1960s through a series of corporate mergers, there was little interest from the studio to exploit DC's most famous heroic character. The father-and-son producing team of [[Alexander Salkind|Alexander]] and [[Ilya Salkind]] had enjoyed some success with European-based productions, and along with their longtime partner, producer [[Pierre Spengler]], signed a 'negative pick-up deal' with Warners, under which they themselves would assume responsibility for fronting the production costs. This deal was consummated primarily on the basis that the film would potentially star Marlon Brando and Gene Hackman, two of the biggest marquee names of the mid-seventies --- but in the early days of the project's development, no one was actually sure as to what part either actor would play. A relatively unknown [[Nick Nolte]] was signed for the part of Superman and a script was commissioned in 1976 with a story by [[Mario Puzo]]. 

The Salkinds' original choice for director, veteran British helmer [[Guy Hamilton]], had to amicably leave the project, as the film, originally intended to have been shot at [[Cinecitta Studios]] in Rome, Italy,  would now be shot at [[Pinewood Studios]] in Iver Heath, Buckinghamshire, England; however, due to director Hamilton's status as a tax exile, he could not be involved in the filming. In the end, Alexander Salkind made a personal phone call to [[Richard Donner]] and offered him the Superman film, promising to pay Donner a fee of $1 million. Although the filming dates for both Brando and Hackman had already been set, Donner found that certain elements of the Puzo script were 'campy' and therefore could not be used in the film; as a last resort, Donner brought in Tom Mankiewicz to re-write several key portions of the script (Mankiewicz ultimately ended up being credited as 'Creative Consultant'). With the delay in production, Nolte also left the Superman project.

[[Image:Sprmnmovie.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Christopher Reeve in the title role]]
A talent search was put on for the role of [[Lois Lane]] with most of the leading young actresses of the time being considered. An unknown stage actor named Christopher Reeve was hired to provide feedlines during auditions and it was Donner's wife who first pointed out that he was ideal for the role. The director and producers had originally thought a bodybuilder or athlete would be the first choice.  In fact, people such as [[Charles Bronson]], [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Paul Newman]], [[Robert Redford]], [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], and even Ilya Salkind's then-wife's dentist, were among those tested for the role of Superman.  But, in the end, the Salkinds kept coming back to Reeve, who had only one other theatrical role and a television appearance in the soap opera ''[[Love of Life]]'' to his credit.  Reeve was then hired to play Superman.

Close to $1 million of the budget had already been spent before Donner joined attempting to design a way for Superman to fly including animation and a remote control plane. As a tax break, shooting would, as noted, be headquartered at Pinewood Studios, with a second unit housed at nearby [[Shepperton Studios]] in Middlesex, England. Before long, the film had the good fortune of securing [[John Barry (set designer)|John Barry]] as production designer. It was Barry who designed the crystaline world of Krypton. New York-based optical effects house [[R/Greenberg Associates]], who until then had done mostly advertising, was responsible for the opening credits sequence. Model effects were designed, directed and supervised by [[Thunderbirds]] stalwart [[Derek Meddings]].

Brando reportedly had contempt for the production and when it was time to shoot his parts in 1977 he did not learn his lines and they were read from cue cards. The Kryptonian costumes using front projection material were also of use in disguising Brando's girth. Hackman would not wear a bald cap for the part of [[Lex Luthor]] (except for one small scene at the end of the film) so the character wearing a wig was contrived. At some point during the production the producers decided they could fashion two films out of the material with Brando and Hackman. Due to the court case that resulted it is not possible to state if Brando and Hackman knew this at the time but based on the DVD commentary by Donner and Mankiewicz it is clear that additional film of Brando was shot that has still not been released.

As production dragged on through 1977 the studio became concerned - by that time, ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars, Episode IV: A New Hope]]'' had proven to be a big hit and Warners were not convinced the Salkinds' film would be as big of a draw. Donner soon commissioned an early [[teaser trailer]], also developed by R/Greenberg Associates, in which clouds raced by the viewer with the names of the all star cast literally blasting onto the screen. This teaser trailer was released in the second half of 1977 on the back of ''A New Hope'' and garnered an enthusiastic audience reaction that did much to keep the production going.  (That teaser is available in the "specials" on the DVD).

==Critical reaction==
The critical reaction was largely enthusiastic with Christopher Reeve singled out for particular praise for his sincere performance (though not everyone was pleased with his portrayal of Clark Kent).  The [[visual effects]] were also praised for their believable visuals in contrast to the typically low budget live action productions of this kind in the past, while John Williams added to his glowing string of kudos for his [[film score]] which critics noted helped give an essential mythic grandeur to the story and character.  (As with "Superman" scores past, the main theme centers around a musical triad).  While the critics were divided over their preference for the reverent origin sequence in the first part, or the more lively later sequence of [[Superman]] beginning his career, it has been considered one of the best superhero movies ever made.

The movie's legacy includes numerous [[television]] series, notably ''[[Superboy (TV series)|Superboy]]'' (produced, like the movie, by Alexander Salkind), ''[[Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'', ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', and the current prequel series, ''[[Smallville]]'', which have all been influenced by the movie to some extent. A particular example of this influence is [[John Williams (composer)|John Williams]]' ''Superman March'', which is often played and parodied in movies with superheroes.

In addition, the success of  film, which cost an enormous $55 million-- at the time, big-budget movies usually cost about $20-$30 million-- set a new standard for superhero movies which demanded similar production values and fidelity to the comics.

==Synopsis==
{{spoiler}}

''The following synopsis is based on the 2000 "special edition" restoration, and not upon any previous theatrical or television version of the film.''

===Introduction===
The movie begins with a short introductory sequence that shows the ''Daily Planet'' during the midst of the [[Great Depression|Depression]] in 1938 (the year the first ''Superman'' comic book was published). Afterwards, the title sequence begins (set to [[John Williams (composer)|John Williams]]' [[Grammy award|Grammy]]-winning main title march), which is shown as flying through space.

The main story moves forward ten years to 1948, in the Krypton star system. After the planet [[Krypton (planet)|Krypton]] is seen, the capital city is shown, with the high dome of that city.

The viewer is taken inside the dome, where the trial of three criminals is underway. Jor-El, the father of Superman and a member of the council, is giving the closing arguments in a trial of three criminals (who were later to appear in ''[[Superman II]]''): ''"This is no fantasy..... no careless product of wild imagination. No, my good friends. These indictments that I have brought you today ... specific charges listed herein against the individuals ... their acts of treason, their ultimate aim of sedition.'' (Lifts up his crystal staff.) ''These are matters of undeniable fact. I ask you now to pronounce judgment on those accused: on this --- this mindless aberration, whose only means of expression are wanton violence and destruction; on the woman Ursa, whose perversions and unreasoning hatred of all mankind have threatened even the children of the planet Krypton ..... and finally, General Zod --- once trusted by this Council, charged with maintaining the defense of the planet Krypton itself --- chief architect of this intended revolution, and author of this insidious plot, to establish a 'New Order' amongst us --- with himself as absolute ruler! You have heard the evidence. The decision of the Council will now be heard.'' 

Jor-El turns to the holographic image of the senior councilman. "Guilty," he proclaims. His fellow councilmen concur the verdict. Because the vote has to be unanimous, the final decision falls to Jor-El. He too casts his guilty vote, not orally but by illuminating his staff. At this, Zod swears revenge upon Jor-El and his family. After Jor-El leaves, the dome opens and the criminals are swept away into the [[Phantom Zone]], which quickly leaves the planet.

As the three criminals are being carried into interstellar space by the Phantom Zone, Jor-El attends a council meeting. He tries again, as he has in prior recent affairs, to convince the elders that the planet Krypton would explode within the space of 30 days, but the council again refuses to accept his findings, and threatens to have him also imprisoned in the Phantom Zone unless he remains silent. Jor-El relents, declaring that neither he or his wife will leave the planet. Jor-El returns home to his wife Lara, and assembles a spacecraft to take advantage of a loophole in the pact that he had made, which is that he is free to send his son to Earth.  Lara questions her husband's actions, but Jor-El feels that the environment and culture on Earth would give his son the advantage he would need to survive.

Later, the council members discover that Jor-El may be misusing energy, and begin to suspect that he could be violating the agreement he had made. The senior councilman orders a full-scale investigation. Meanwhile, joined by a tearful Lara, Jor-El utters his final farewell to their beloved son. Within moments, the spaceship is set to launch, even as the planet begins to fall apart under the influence of some sort of matter expelled from the sun. The crystal-like spaceship then crashes through the ceiling and begins its departure from Krypton. Soon afterwards the planet explodes, destroying nearly the entire Kryptonian civilization.

Baby Kal-El begins his three-year journey to Earth, during which the ethereal voice of his father instructs him on the history of the universe and how it was embroiled in interplanetary war (which is why Jor-El warns his son not to interfere in human history).

By the time the spaceship lands in a wheat field in [[Smallville]], a rural town in [[Kansas]], it is the year 1951. The boy is discovered by a childless couple in their late 40s or early 50s, Jonathan and Martha Kent, whose truck was knocked off the road as the spacecraft came down. They cover him with red and blue blankets they find in the spaceship. The truck falls off the jack, injuring Jonathan, but the baby Kal-El easily raises the vehicle with his own hands. Surprised and dumbfounded, the Kents realize the only way to keep him away from those who may ridicule him is to adopt him as their foster son, whom they name Clark (Martha's middle name in the movie).

===Clark/Kal-El as a teen===
The story moves forward to the fall of 1965. Teenage high school senior Clark Kent, after being ridiculed by his classmates, kicks a football in anger--the football travels farther than even he could imagine. Clark then races towards home and along the way outpaces a speeding train that has a young Lois Lane as a passenger who spots him but cannot convince her parents of the feat. The little race concludes with a reckless jump at a crossing in which Clark barely avoids a collision with the train and then proceeds to continue home, beating his classmates by mere minutes. His foster father Jonathan has a talk with him about his importance on Earth, after which he dies after suffering a fatal [[heart attack]]. Days later, at the funeral, Clark realizes the fragility of human life.. even with all his powers, he couldn't save his adoptive father.

Months later, in the summer of 1966, Clark is awakened by a high-pitched noise coming from the nearby barn. There, he discovers a crystal Jor-El sent with him. He realizes it is time for him to leave. Clark says an emotional goodbye to his foster mother Martha, part of the only family he ever knew.

Weeks pass, and Clark finishes a journey to the Arctic region with the green crystal. Upon arrival, he is compelled to throw it into the ice where it creates his [[Fortress of Solitude]]. Inside, Clark finds a console, including the green crystal, and is able to call up a hologram of his biological father, Jor-El, and there he learns (as it was in the comic books) that he is the only survivor of the doomed planet Krypton. For the next twelve years, he is instructed about his origins, everything there is to learn, and his intended role as his new home's champion by way of extensive recordings made by Jor-El. As his long education ends, he emerges from the Fortress as Superman, dressed in a red cape and blue suit that bears his biological family's crest as a chest symbol which coincidentally resembles an "'''S'''" on a triangular shield.

===Clark/Kal-El as a man, set-up of the plot===
The setting changes to the big city of [[Metropolis (Superman)|Metropolis]], in the year 1978. Clark Kent, having reached adulthood, takes a job as a [[reporter]] for the ''[[Daily Planet]]'' newspaper under editor-in-chief [[Perry White]] and alongside ace reporter [[Lois Lane]] and photographer [[Jimmy Olsen]]. As Clark goes through his first day on the job, Lois makes no secret of her disdain for her partner's naiviete or the competition he represents.  When they go out for lunch, Lois and Clark are held up by a crook whom Lois unwisely resists and nearly gets shot for her efforts but for Clark secretly catching the bullet that would have struck her. 

Meanwhile, a bumbling simpleton named Otis is delivering the new issue of the Daily Planet to arch criminal [[Lex Luthor]] at his hideout under Metropolis's train station, "60 feet below Park Avenue", unaware he is being followed again by federal agents. To elude pursuit, Luthor murders the shadowing agent and his partners lose sight of Otis. Luthor's frustration at Otis' carelessness is alleviated at the paper's headline of two [[ICBM]]s being readied for transport to their respective test launches. Luthor, along with cohort Eve Teschmacher, plans the "greatest real estate swindle of all time" with the aid of the U.S. Government using those missiles.

===Superman's first public appearance===
One week later, Lois is on assignment to interview the President of the United States. As the helicopter is about to depart the roof of the Daily Planet, a freak accident occurs that sends the helicopter in a tailspin, finally crashing on the edge of the Daily Planet building and threatening to fall. It is at this point that Clark first appears publicly as Superman, rescuing Lois and saving the helicopter from certain doom. Superman has a busy first night where he stops crime all over the city and performs spectacular rescues, including [[Air Force One]] which was hit by lightning and lost an engine. After all this, Superman returns to the Fortress of Solitude and talks to the spirit form of his father. Jor-El warns his son that while enjoying his work is permissible, he is not to reveal his secret identity, and not to use his powers excessively.

Superman's escapades are making headlines on every television network in the world. Lex Luthor, having seen one of the newscasts, realizes that Superman is obviously a powerful alien who poses a threat to his scheme should he, as seems likely, interfere. The next day, Perry White gathers the headlines of Superman's heroics from every metropolitan newspaper, notes that it happened under their own noses, and demands an up-close interview with Superman himself. Lois finds a note from Superman telling her he intends to visit her home that night. Sure enough, the superhero arrives and agrees to an interview which includes a romantic demonstration of his flight power by taking her on an aerial trip above the city. Upon the conclusion of the interview/date, Superman leaves and quickly returns as Clark for his own date with Lois, barely resisting the temptation of revealing his secret identity to her.

From the published story, Luthor, Otis and Eve learn of Superman's weaknesses (he is unable to see through lead), and that his origin is a destroyed planet. Lex infers that fragments may have landed on Earth, scientifically reasons that such fragments ([[Kryptonite]]) would be deadly to Superman, and finds out that a [[meteorite]] of the needed mineral is available at [[Addis Ababa]]. After stealing the rock, they travel to California under a series of disguises and reprogram the two missiles. Luthor seems well-prepared for a foul-up, and when Otis fouls up the first reprogramming (diversion: Eve laying on the road near an overturned car), Luthor springs the second diversion (wide motorhome meets missile convoy at a narrow bridge).

===Luthor and Superman===
Days later, Perry White comments briefly about a strange robbery in [[Addis Ababa]], in which two museum guards are killed and the only thing stolen is a "worthless piece of meteorite", before advising Clark on his need for more self-confidence. But just then, the young reporter hears a high-screeched noise that only he and the entire canine population of the city can hear. It comes from Lex Luthor, who threatens that "in approximately 5 minutes, a poison gas pellet containing propane lithium compound will be released through thousand of air ducts in the city, effectively annihilating half the population of Metropolis." Clark jumps from a 100-story window and transforms into Superman to track down the noise, eventually reaching an underground section of downtown. Lex attempts to do away with Superman by trying to kill him with bullets, fire, and ice (via a tunnel leading to Luthor's lair), but to no avail.

Eventually, Superman finds Luthor, and the archvillain explains the motive behind his "crime of the century". Luthor's objective: to make the West Coast of California "more valuable between the time you buy it and the time you sell it." To accomplish that, Lex hopes to set up a major [[earthquake]] in California by using the two missiles, one of which he has programmed as a diversion, the other to hit the [[San Andreas Fault]]. That in turn would cause most of the state to slide into the ocean, killing millions of people while simultanously making the vast tracts of worthless [[desert]] land that he had quietly purchased skyrocket in value when it becomes the new West Coast of the [[United States]].

Luthor tricks the incensed Superman into opening a lead container of [[Kryptonite]]; the lethal effects of the emerald rock instantly incapacitate him. Placing the rock around his neck, Luthor drops Superman in the indoor pool for him to drown while leaving to monitor the missiles' progress.  However, Superman escapes with the help of Luthor's girlfriend, Eve Teschmacher, who makes him promise to first stop the missile directed to [[Hackensack, New Jersey]], where her mother lives. Superman fulfills his promise, steering the Hackensack missile off course into the sky, only to see the nuclear explosion from the California missile cause a severe earthquake.

Doing what only he can, Superman stops the earthquake, saves a bus from the damaged [[Golden Gate Bridge]] in [[San Francisco]], repairs a crumbling railroad line, rescuing Jimmy Olsen from the collapsing [[Hoover Dam]] and stops the ensuing flood.  Lois Lane, in California on the "worthless land" story for the ''Daily Planet'', becomes a victim of the quake when she is drawn into a crevice created by the quake and tries in vain to escape.  After stopping the flow of the collapsed dam from reaching other territories, Superman then realizes he has forgotten Lois.  He flies at lightning speed to try and save her, but it is too late. He finds her dead, her body crushed by the impact of the dirt.

===Denouement===
Fraught with grief over Lois' death, Superman flies towards the clouds and hears the voices of his Kryptonian father, Jor-El (warning him not to interfere in human history), and his Earth father Jonathan Kent (remembering the conversation he had with his foster son before his death). Finally, Superman makes the decision to defy Jor-El's orders by turning back time at super-speed, revolving around the earth numerous times, reversing history to the point where the earthquake began. He then returns Earth to its proper rotation, and finds Lois Lane alive, trying to start her car. Lois grumbles: "That's the problem with men of steel -- there's never one around when you want one! Ya know what happened to me while you were off flying around? I'm almost in an earthquake, I have this gas station blow up beside my car, there's telephone poles falling all over the road, I'm almost killed -- and to top the whole thing off, this stupid car runs outta gas!" "Well, sorry about that, Lois, but I've been kinda busy for a while," says Kal-El. Just as they start to kiss, Jimmy enters the scene, thanking Superman for saving him. Superman realizes there's one more thing he has to do, and flies off.  Jimmy wishes Clark was around to see what has happened, but Lois becomes skeptical about how Clark isn't around when Superman is. She dismisses her thoughts as the "silliest idea", and realizes Superman does care about her. But she also knows the day will come when Superman will return to Lois, the woman he loves.

The story concludes at Metropolis prison, where Superman arrives with Lex and Otis (effectively a "citizen's arrest") where they will "be safe until they can get a fair trial". Lex takes off his hairpiece to reveal his true, bald-headed identity. As the two criminals are led away, arguing with each other, the warden declares, "This country is safe again, Superman, thanks to you." Superman replies, "No, sir! Don't thank me, Warden. We're all part of the same team. Good night." Then, as he circles "up, up and away" around the globe for another patrol, Superman suddenly notices the camera, and smiles straight into it. And so the Man of Steel's first mission in his fight for "truth, justice, and the American way" is complete.  Humanity now has a savior.

==Different versions==
''Superman'' was originally released to theatres in December, 1978 with a running time of 143 minutes, edited from Richard Donner's original three-hour director's rough cut.  In 1981, the rights to the movie reverted from Warner Bros. to Alexander Salkind, which allowed him to re-edit the film for international television distribution, including over 45 minutes of previously deleted footage and even some of John Williams' original score that had been left out of the theatrical cut, both elements restored to the film.  This so-called "Salkind International Edit" runs 188 minutes.  Due to a clause in director Donner's contract, Donner himself was excluded from the re-editing process.  It was expanded in an attempt by the Salkinds to charge by the minute for television rights.  [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], which had U.S. broadcast rights to the Salkinds' library, first aired ''Superman'' domestically in February, 1982 as a two-night event.  ABC's 182-minute edit, which deleted a few short scenes deemed inappropriate for television, aired again in November of 1982.  The ABC version was derived from the Salkind edit.  Subsequently, both the theatrical and television versions were distributed in syndication by Warner Bros., which regained control of the film in 1985, but until 2001 only the theatrical version was issued on home video.

In 1979, WCI Home Video (now [[Warner Home Video]]) issued Superman on [[VHS]] and Betamax. However the film was horrifically truncated to a length of 127 minutes, by way of [[time compression]], in most scenes without dialogue were sped up, and deleting a majority of the film's closing credits, instead replacing them with a truncated version consisting of the copyright notice, and a [[chyron]] of the credits taken from an 8mm release of selected scenes from the film.  This time compression was necessary because of the technological limitations of videocassettes at the time and the unavailbility of long playing cassettes.  The film would not be available in an uncompressed form until 1983, when Warner Bros. finally issued such a version on home video.  

In 1994, [[Los Angeles]] television station [[KCOP]] (at the time an independent station) aired the first U.S. broadcast of the complete Salkind edit (it has been believed to have been broadcast outside of the U.S. prior to 1994 since this cut was originally prepared in 1981 before ABC's original telecast).  The full expanded cut has unofficially been circulated on video among fans throughout the bootleg community, at conventions and, most recently, via Internet forums.

==The restoration==
In 2000, director Richard Donner and [[film preservation|film restoration]] producer Michael Thau prepared a new 151-minute "Special Edition" originally for theatrical re-release.  Working from original film elements (which were beginning to deteriorate), the film went through a six-month restoration, with both color and sound rejuvenated, and dirt that had been built in the film over twenty years cleaned.  Also, Donner selected eight of the 45-plus minutes that had been used for television release to be incorporated into this new cut of the film.  This version was slated for worldwide theatrical reissue, but was instead released to video and, for the first time ever, on DVD, in the summer of 2001.  This version has been seen on cable television and in revival film houses.

A remastered version of the 143-minute theatrical cut was also prepared, and although this version has not been released on DVD, it has been seen on cable television.
