'''Zabu''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]]. He is the last known living sabretooth tiger and is a companion and ally of [[Ka-Zar]].

==Fictional character biography==
Zabu was born in the [[Savage Land]].  While still a cub, his mother and siblings were killed by human hunters.  He wandered the Savage Land on his own, teaching himself how to survive as he grew to adulthood.  Zabu encounters a young boy named Kevin Plunder as he was about to be attacked by a group of human Savage Land natives.  Zabu saves Kevin, and the two become companions.  Zabu protects the boy as he grows to adulthood, and eventually took on the name Ka-Zar, which means "son of the tiger."

Zabu helps Ka-Zar battle many enemies. For example, in ''Ka-Zar: Lord of the Hidden Jungle'' #3 they confront '[[Kukulcan (comics)|El Tigre]]' and 'Man-God'. This paticular battle results in El Tigre mentally controlling Zabu for a time, causing him to attack Ka-Zar. Fortunately, El Tigre loses control before any serious injuries happen.

Zabu's family grows by two when Ka-Zara marries ''[[Shanna the She Devil]]'' and they later have a son named Matthew.

Zabu has left the Savage Land, in at least one instance, venturing to New York City with Ka-Zar during marital difficulties; his master was having difficulty controlling an addiction to outside technology.
