'''Zabu''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]], a [[superhero]] whom is connected primarily to the [[Savage Land]], and the [[X-Men]], and most recently the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] (by way of the "[[Pet Avengers]]"), he first appeared in X-Men #10 (Mar 1965). He is the last known living [[sabretooth tiger]] and is a companion and ally of [[Ka-Zar]].

==Fictional character biography==
Zabu was born in the [[Savage Land]].  While still a cub, his mother and siblings were killed by human hunters.  He wandered the Savage Land on his own, teaching himself how to survive as he grew to adulthood.  Zabu encounters a young boy named Kevin Plunder as he was about to be attacked by a group of human Savage Land natives.  Zabu saves Kevin, and the two become companions.  Zabu protects the boy as he grows to adulthood, and eventually took on the name Ka-Zar, which means "son of the tiger." Zabu was brought to near human intelligence due to exposure of [[radioactive]] mists.

Zabu helps Ka-Zar battle many enemies. For example, in ''Ka-Zar: Lord of the Hidden Jungle'' #3 they confront '[[Kukulcan (comics)|El Tigre]]' and 'Man-God'. This particular battle results in El Tigre mentally controlling Zabu for a time, causing him to attack Ka-Zar. El Tigre loses control before any serious injuries happen.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Zabu's family grows by two when Ka-Zar marries ''[[Shanna the She Devil]]'' and they later have a son named Matthew.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Zabu has left the Savage Land, in at least one instance, venturing to New York City with Ka-Zar during marital difficulties; his master was having difficulty controlling an addiction to outside technology. Zabu has many adventures in New York City, as he assists Ka-Zar and Shanna against [[Plunderer|Parnival]] Plunder, who wishes to kill them all.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

In a Spider-Man family one shot in issue six, the secondary story is about Zabu having emotional troubles, knowing he has no family left. Ka-Zar asks Peter to watch Zabu while he attends a world summit on global warming. Later Peter's Aunt May (completely unaware Zabu is hiding in the garage, because after Uncle Ben was killed she tries to stay away from there) told Peter this is how she feels knowing she's outlived her friends, husband, and relatives. Peter uses this to bond with Zabu. Peter takes Zabu to a museum to interact with the fake sabretooth tigers on display and they are almost caught by a guard. Peter tells Zabu to pull a "[[Calvin and Hobbes]]" maneuver, to which he plays like he's a stuffed animal, leaving Peter stunned at Zabu's intelligence. Afterword Zabu is feeling better and Ka-Zar picks him up from Spider-Man. Zabu and Ka-Zar return apparentlly months later, and team up with Spidey to fight [[Sauron (comics)|Sauron]]. Zabu jumps on Peter/Spider-Man and seems to be hugging him; Ka-Zar says this is a sign that he is part of Zabu's family, and that he hasn't seen Zabu do this for quite some time.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} During the [[Secret Invasion]], Zabu was present when the [[Skrull]] ship landed in the Savage Land. He helped Shanna and Ka-Zar battle the Skrulls, killing the Skrull pretending to be Jessica Jones.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #5</ref>

== Other versions ==
*'''[[House of M]]''': Zabu appeared as a picture in a [[Daily Bugle]] article about Ka-Zar and his seeking of [[Right of asylum|asylum]] in the United States.

*'''Ultimate Universe''': In this reality, Zabu actually is a [[tiger]] with sabre-teeth, rather than looking like a traditional [[smilodon]] as he looks in the main Marvel universe. Flashbacks reveal Zabu, Shanna and Ka-Zar have been together since childhood.<ref>"Ultimates Vol 3 #3"</ref>

==In other media==

* Zabu appeared in the 1981 [[Spider-Man (1981 TV series)|Spider-Man]] episode "The Hunter and the Hunted." J. Jonah Jameson hires Kraven the Hunter to capture Zabu so that he can be the mascot for the Daily Bugle much to the objection of Robbie Robertson and Betty Brant. Ka-Zar travels to Manhatten to rescue Zabu. When the chain on the airport crane holding Zabu's cage breaks, Zabu gets loose and Spider-Man tries to subdue Zabu only for an allergy to smilodons to kick in. Spider-Man does managed to trap Zabu in his webs. Kraven later uses Zabu for bait when it came to hunting Ka-Zar. When Ka-Zar ends up tangled up in Kraven's vines, he manages to swing to Zabu's cage and release him. He and Ka-Zar managed to trick Kraven into one of his cages.

Around Zabu's neck was a Star Quartz that would bind and merge any metal in the presence of Vibranium.
