'''Phantom Girl''' is the [[superhero]] [[pseudonym|alias]] of '''Tinya Wazzo'''. In the Post-Zero Hour continuity, she is known as '''Apparition'''. She is a [[fictional character]] in the [[DC Universe]] and a member of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] in the 30th and 31st centuries. She has the power to turn intangible and phase through solid objects as do all other natives of her home planet, [[Bgztl]]. Her mother is Winema Wazzo.

==Pre-Zero Hour==
In the original pre-[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]] (ZH) continuity, she was the fifth member to join the Legion. Her home planet Bgztl exists in the 4th Dimension. She first appeared in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #276 in the [[Supergirl]] story "Supergirl's Three Super Girl-Friends" along with [[Triplicate Girl]] and [[Saturn Girl]], and wore white tights and a white cape with a stylized ''P'' on the chest. A member of the Legion's Espionage Squad, she was involved romantically with fellow Legionnaire [[Ultra Boy]] for many years. 

In pre-ZH continuity she has a brother, Gmya Wazzo. In the slightly altered post-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]] continuity caused by the removal of [[Superboy]] by [[Superman]]'s post-crisis revamp, she was thought to have been killed in a shuttle accident; in reality, the time sorceress [[Glorith]] sent her to the 20th century where, stripped of her memory of her true identity and place and time, she assumed the name Phase and joined the interstellar law enforcement agency, [[L.E.G.I.O.N.]] Just before ''Zero Hour'', in yet another continuity shift, Phase was revealed to be Enya Wazzo, Tinya's never before mentioned cousin. The [[Time Trapper]] returned Tinya to be reunited with Jo Nah ([[Ultra Boy]]) just before ''Zero Hour'' ended the first Legion continuity.

During the "Five Year Gap" following the Magic Wars, Earth fell under the covert control of the [[Dominators]], and withdrew from the [[United Planets]].  A few years later, the members of the Dominators' highly classified "Batch SW6" escaped captivity.  Originally, Batch SW6 appeared to be a group of teeange Legionnaire clones, created from samples apparently taken just prior to [[Ferro Lad]]'s death at the hands of the [[Sun-Eater]].  Later, they were revealed to be time-paradox duplicates, every bit as legitimate as their older counterparts.  After Earth was destroyed in a disaster reminiscent of the destruction of [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]] over a millennium earlier,<ref>''Legion of Super-Heroes'' (Vol. 4) #38, Late December 1992.</ref>  a few dozen surviving cities and their inhabitants reconstituted their world as New Earth. The SW6 Legionnaires remained, and their version of Phantom Girl assumed the code name Apparition.

==Post-Zero Hour==
In the second reboot continuity she was also the fifth to join, under the codename Apparition. As in pre-ZH reality, she became romantically involved with Ultra Boy, but she was eventually revealed to be half-Carggite, and Phase to be another of her bodies. She never used the codename "Phantom Girl".

'''Tinya Wazzo''' was the daughter of [[Winema Wazzo]], the [[Btzgl]]ian Ambassador to the [[United Planets]], and regularly chafed under her mother's obsession with running her life for her. One day, she was helping her mother at a conference, which included the official unveiling of the Legion of Super-Heroes (at that point composed of just the three founders), when, in a rush, she phased through the decorative UP globe rather than go around it and spotted something wrong. Thus, when [[Saturn Girl]] scanned the room, she picked up on this, giving time for [[Cosmic Boy]] and [[Live Wire (DC Comics)|Live Wire]] to get rid of it before the blast went off. She then tagged along while they searched for the culprits and saved Saturn Girl's life and, along with [[Triad (comics)|Triad]], was immediately inducted onto the team.

When she met [[Ultra Boy]], the two were instantly mutually smitten, but their romance was tumultuous, with Tinya's mother - already angered by her entry into the Legion - dead set against it, until Tinya was apparently killed by [[Daxamite]] [[White Triangle]] terrorists, who burned her to death with their heat vision in the invulnerable Ultra Boy's arms.

However, that was not the end for Tinya. Shortly afterward, Jo (Ultra Boy) began having painful seizures, and, eventually, Apparition emerged from his body - although now permanently phased and with only Jo and her mother able to see her. Nonetheless, she played a small but critical part in freeing the Legion from the [[Emerald Eye]]'s control, after it had corrupted [[Violet (comics)|Shrinking Violet]]. She accidentally freed [[Saturn Girl]] by phasing through her (with the side-benefit that Imra could now see her), and Imra managed to influence the others enough until Violet panicked, causing the Eye to send half the Legionnaires (including Imra, Tinya and Jo) back in time to the late 20th Century, and take Violet far away through space.

[[Image:LSH98.png|thumb|left|Apparition first encounters [[Phase (comics)|Phase]] (left). Art by [[Alan Davis]]]]While stranded in the past, she encountered a psychic using a Bgztllian touchstone - a red stone that aided the Bgztllians' phasing, which encounter ended with her now visible to all, and able to disrupt machinery and electronics when phasing through them. Then, when Phase of the [[L.E.G.I.O.N.]] came to find the touchstone - hers - it was discovered that Phase was also Tinya Wazzo! The two involuntarily merged, and Tinya became the dominant personality in the resulting body, gaining a physical form once more. Through hypnotic regression, it was found that Tinya was half-Carggite, and that she should have had the Carggite ability to triplicate, but, unbeknownst to Tinya's mother, who hadn't known that  Tinya's father was a Carggite and was only expecting one child, Tinya's father had stolen her other two bodies as newborns and sold them to the [[Luck Lords]] to pay off his gambling debts. Phase, lost in time, was one of these. The fate of her third body remains unknown.

===Blight===

Ultra Boy and Apparition remained extremely close in the following months, rarely being seen without the other by their side. Eventually, Tinya decided to make a point of going on a Legion mission without Jo, to prove to herself as much as to him that they could survive apart. This led to her, [[Brainiac 5#Upgrades: Brainiac 5.1|Brainiac 5.1]], Cosmic Boy and [[Monstress]] being stranded far from Earth as, while they were away, the Blight used the Stargate network to take over the planet, shutting the door behind them. Brainiac would later comment that he wasn't sure which was worse - the month-long slog back to Earth, or Apparition's I-want-my-Ultra-Boy tantrums."

When they finally arrived back, they crashed to Earth as the Legion Outpost exploded behind them, and found [[Chameleon (DC Comics)|Chameleon]], the sole remaining uncaptured/unBlighted Legionnaire. Together with [[XS (comics)|XS]] and [[Saturn Girl]], who managed to escape, they found a way to defeat the Blight, while Tinya herself managed to convince Ultra Boy to throw off his Blighting.

===Lost?===
Shortly afterward, the Blight's damage to the Stargate network led half the team to be thrown through a Rift in space to a "Second Galaxy." Just as Ultra Boy was about to go nuts at the thought of never seeing Tinya again, she seemed to appear from the floor. However, this was actually a telepathic illusion on Saturn Girl's part, who "played" Tinya in an attempt to keep Ultra Boy sane. When her deception was discovered, Jo Nah initially ignored Imra, then they ended up passionately kissing. Confused, they broke off and were awkward around each other until returning home.

===Baby===
Meanwhile, the real Apparition was present at the official disbanding of the Legion of Super-Heroes in the wake of the Rift disaster by United Planets President "[[Leland McCauley]]" (who, in reality, had been replaced by [[Ra's Al Ghul]]). There, [[Invisible Kid]] noticed she was pregnant, and she begged him not to tell her mother, now UP Vice-President, which he reluctantly agreed to do.

She lived with her mother for several months thereafter, until her mother, having discovered Tinya was pregnant, became overbearing, whereupon she fled to [[Rimbor]], Ultra Boy's homeworld. There, she met [[Timber Wolf (comics)|Timber Wolf]], who, with the aid of a small gang he commanded, helped and protected her. The news of the Lost Legionnaires return would trigger her labour, and the baby was born successfully, in spite of an attempt by three mercenaries - hired by her mother to recover her and the baby - to kill her for ease of transport while taking the baby. They then stole the mercenaries' tickets back to Earth, whereupon Timber Wolf went with her.

On the ship, it became obvious that [[Cub]], as the baby became known, was growing abnormally fast - and displaying the powers of both his parents. They were then stranded for a time when they were knocked out of warp space by the [[Robotica]]n battle fleet, and it was discovered that the "engine" was in fact a living creature in significant pain.

===Estrangement===
Reunited with the Legion, she also reconciled with Ultra Boy, but their marriage came under strain after the extended separation, as she discovered a letter to Imra mentioning Jo's kiss with her, even as he and Imra realised that their kiss was borne purely out of confusion, and he misunderstood her relationship with Timber Wolf. In addition, Cub continued to age rapidly, reaching an apparent age of six years old after an experiment designed to retard his aging backfired. The tensions had not been resolved when the series rebooted.

==2005 Reboot==
In the new ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' continuity started in 2005, Tinya Wazzo is again called Phantom Girl. In this setting, Bgztl exists in the same location as Earth but is out of phase with it. Essentially, the whole planet is in the "Buffer Zone" that the original version of Phantom Girl used to phase into. Tinya is the only Bgzltian who can interact with the real universe. When she phases she is visible in both universes, which can cause confusion.

==Post-Infinite Crisis==
The events of the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' miniseries have apparently restored a close analogue of the Pre-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] Legion to continuity, as seen in "[[The Lightning Saga]]" story arc in ''[[Justice League of America]]'' and ''[[Justice Society of America]]'', and in the "[[Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes (comics)|Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes]]" story arc in ''[[Action Comics]]''.  Phantom Girl is included in their number.

==Other media==
In ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', Phantom Girl made a cameo appearance in the episode "New Kids In Town". She later reappeared in an episode of ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' titled "Far From Home". 

She is part of the core Legion team in the ''[[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)|Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' series. The voice actor portraying Phantom Girl is [[Heather Hogan]]. As in post-ZH continuity, her mother is President of the UP. There is also a romance hinted between her and Timberwolf.
