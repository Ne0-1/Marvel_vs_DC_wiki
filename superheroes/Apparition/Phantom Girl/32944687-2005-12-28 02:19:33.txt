''This page discusses the pre-[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]] [[reboot_(continuity)|reboot]] version of the character. For the post-ZH version, see [[Apparition (comics)]].''

'''Phantom Girl''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[DC Universe]], a member of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] in the thirtieth century. Her real name is Tinya Wazzo and she has the power to turn intangible and phase through solid objects as do all other natives of [[Bgztl]].

In the original pre-[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]] continuity she was the fifth member to join the Legion. Her home planet is Bgztl which exists in the 4th Dimension. She first appeared in Action Comics # 276 in the [[Supergirl]] story, 'Supergirl's Three Super Girl-Friends' along with [[Triplicate Girl]] and [[Saturn Girl]]. A member of the Legion's Espionage Squad, she was involved romantically with fellow Legionnaire [[Ultra Boy]] for many years. 

The name of her mother is Winema Wazzo (in both pre and post ZH continuity), in pre ZH continuity she has a brother, Gmya Wazzo. In the slightly altered post-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]] continuity caused by the removal of [[Superboy]] by [[Superman]]'s post crisis revamp, she was thought to have been killed in a shuttle accident, in reality, she was sent back to the 20th century where, stripped of her memory of her true identity and place and time, she had become [[Phase (comics)|Phase]] of [[L.E.G.I.O.N]]. Just before Zero Hour in yet another continuity shift Phase was revealed to actually be Enya Wazzo, Tinya's never before mentioned cousin. The Time Trapper returned Tinya to be reunited with Jo Nah ([[Ultra Boy]]) just before Zero Hour ended the first Legion continuity.

===Post Zero Hour===
In the second reboot continuity she was also the fifth to join, under the codename Apparition. As in pre-ZH reality, she became romantically involved with Ultra Boy, but she was eventually revealed to be half-Carggite, and Phase to be another of her bodies. She never used the codename "Phantom Girl".
