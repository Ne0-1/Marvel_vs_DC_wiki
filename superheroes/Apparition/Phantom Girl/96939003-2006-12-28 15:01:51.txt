'''Phantom Girl''' is the [[superhero]] [[pseudonym|alias]] of '''Tinya Wazzo'''. She is a [[fictional character]] in the [[DC Universe]] and a member of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] in the 30th century. She has the power to turn intangible and phase through solid objects as do all other natives of her home planet, [[Bgztl]]. Her mother is Winema Wazzo.

==Pre-Zero Hour==
In the original pre-[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]] (ZH) continuity, she was the fifth member to join the Legion. Her home planet Bgztl exists in the 4th Dimension. She first appeared in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #276 in the [[Supergirl]] story "Supergirl's Three Super Girl-Friends" along with [[Triplicate Girl]] and [[Saturn Girl]], and wore white tights and a white cape with a stylized ''P'' on the chest. A member of the Legion's Espionage Squad, she was involved romantically with fellow Legionnaire [[Ultra Boy]] for many years. 

In pre-ZH continuity she has a brother, Gmya Wazzo. In the slightly altered post-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]] continuity caused by the removal of [[Superboy]] by [[Superman]]'s post crisis revamp, she was thought to have been killed in a shuttle accident, in reality, she was sent back to the 20th century where, stripped of her memory of her true identity and place and time, she had become [[Phase (comics)|Phase]] of [[L.E.G.I.O.N.]] Just before Zero Hour in yet another continuity shift Phase was revealed to actually be Enya Wazzo, Tinya's never before mentioned cousin. The Time Trapper returned Tinya to be reunited with Jo Nah ([[Ultra Boy]]) just before Zero Hour ended the first Legion continuity.

==Post-Zero Hour==
:''Main article: [[Apparition (comics)]]''
In the second reboot continuity she was also the fifth to join, under the codename Apparition. As in pre-ZH reality, she became romantically involved with Ultra Boy, but she was eventually revealed to be half-Carggite, and Phase to be another of her bodies. She never used the codename "Phantom Girl".

==2005 Reboot==
In the new ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' continuity started in 2005, Tinya Wazzo is again called Phantom Girl. In this setting, Bgztl exists in the same location as Earth but is out of phase with it. Essentially, the whole planet is in the "Buffer Zone" that the original version of Phantom Girl used to phase into. Tinya is the only Bgzltian who can interact with the real universe. When she phases she is visible in both universes, which can cause confusion.

==Elseworlds and other versions of Phantom Girl==
Phantom Girl appeared in the [[Amalgam Comics]] title [[Amalgam_Comics#Spider-Boy_Team-Up|Spider-Boy Team-Up]]. She was merged with [[X-Men]] member [[Kitty Pryde]] to form the character Phantom Cat.  She was a member of the ''Legion Of Galactic Guardians 2099''.

==Other media==
In ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', Phantom Girl made a cameo appearance in the episode "New Kids In Town". She later reappeared in an episode of ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' titled "Far From Home". 

She is part of the core Legion team in the ''[[Legion of Super Heroes (animated series)|Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' series. The voice actor portraying Phantom Girl is [[Heather Hogan]].
