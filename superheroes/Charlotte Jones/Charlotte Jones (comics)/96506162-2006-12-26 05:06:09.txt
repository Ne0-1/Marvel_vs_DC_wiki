'''Charlotte Jones''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[mutant (fictional)|latent mutant]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe. Her first appearance was in ''X-Factor (1st series) #51''.

==Fictional character biography==
Once a trauma nurse at a [[Brooklyn]] hospital, Charlotte Jones' husband was a police officer who was killed when he and his son Timmy were caught in the middle of a drug war after walking home from a parents' night at Timmy's school. One of the bullets nearly severed Timmy's spine, resulting in years of physical therapy to learn to walk again. As a result of that night, Charlotte became a police officer herself.

It was in this capacity that Jones first met the winged mutant named [[Archangel (comics)|Archangel]], a member of the team of superhuman mutant adventurers known as [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] who had only recently fought off the mental manipulations of the eternal mutant [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. Archangel saved Jones from plummeting to her death after her police helicopter was struck by a news chopper, and then saved her again the next day from an ambush by a street gang. Jones was later captured by the psychic vampires known as the Ravens who sought to make Archangel one of their number by forcing him to feed on Jones' life energy. However, Jones managed to free Archangel, and the Ravens were defeated with the assistance of X-Factor and two members of the team of superhuman mutant adventurers known as the [[X-Men]], the mutant techno-wizard [[Forge (comics)|Forge]] and the sonic-screaming Banshee. As a result of their brief psychic linking, Archangel admitted that it was Jones' courage that helped him overcome the Ravens' control. Subsequently, Jones and Archangel began to see each other socially, and the two began to fall in love.

Jones later clashed with [[Magistrates]] from the island nation of [[Genosha]] who had come to the U.S. to reclaim escaped mutate Jenny Ransome. During a firefight with the Magistrates, Jones' partner was killed. Following them into the sewers, she was saved by Forge who provided her with an X-Men training costume which proved a snug fit but afforded Jones a great degree of resistance to physical injury.

Jones and Archangel would eventually end their relationship after Archangel rejoined the X-Men, but Jones still remained an ally to the mutant heroes. Later, after Jones had been promoted to Detective, she was forced to betray the X-Man named Iceman and the mutant doctor [[Cecilia Reyes]] to cyborg [[Sentinel (comics)|Prime Sentinels]] from Operation: Zero Tolerance, a government-sponsored anti-mutant strikeforce headed up by the android [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]]. Bastion had abducted Jones' son, leaving her with no other choice. Her son was eventually rescued by members of the X-Men shortly before OZT was shut down.

Later, whilst pursuing a drug pusher named Rufus Delgado, the pair unwittingly stumbled into the secret base of the [[Neo (comics)|Neo]], a race of superior mutants who were waging a war against the X-Men. Jones and Delgado were affected by the powers of the Neo named [[Tartarus (comics)|Tartarus]] and his sister [[Elysia (comics)|Elysia]], which caused them to experience their greatest fear and greatest desire respectively. For Jones, it was the fear of falling victim to a criminal. For Delgado, it was his desire of gaining dominance over his long-time nemesis Jones. The result was a physical merging of the two into a two-torsoed winged demonic amalgam of a creature, with Delgado's personality dominant. Delgado subsequently struck a secret deal with the Neo [[Rax (comics)|Rax]], who sought to usurp control of the Neo from their then-leader [[Domina (comics)|Domina]]. After the X-Men invaded the Neo's stronghold, Delgado was killed when he was decapitated by the feral X-Man [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]. A ceasefire was eventually called between the Neo and the X-Men, and Jones was restored to her normal self.

Jones continues to serve as a detective with the [[NYPD|New York Police Department]], and remains a steadfast ally of the X-Men.

Sergeant Jones was with the X-Man known as [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] when he went to the apartment of a former mutant named [[Hannah Levy]], who used to be able to eat only insects. They rescued Hannah, who was mad with fear because her insects had gotten loose and she believed they wanted to eat her.

Jones was also with Bishop when he was approaching the Metropolitan Correctional Facility to check on the [[Shi'ar]] Death Commados who were being held for murdering the entire Grey family (except [[Rachel Summers|Marvel Girl III]] and [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], although they did not appear to know that Cable's late mother, [[Madelyne Pryor]], was a clone of [[Jean Grey]], and therefore he should be on their list). Their mission was to eliminate Jean Grey's bloodline so that the Phoenix could never rise again. 

The Shi'ar Death Commandos were escaping because they knew that Marvel Girl III was well away from the X-Men and they still intended to kill her. Jones shot Devo, but was shot by Warshot. Sega picked her up, but she shot Sega (with bullets, not an energy weapon). Sega swatted her toward Blackcloak shortly before he and other Death Commandos were beamed toward Marvel Girl III. Jones' condition is not yet known.
