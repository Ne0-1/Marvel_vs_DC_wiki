'''Kulan Gath''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[villain]]ous [[magic (paranormal)|magician]] who was created at [[Marvel Comics]] as a foe of [[Conan the Barbarian]] and who was later fully integrated into the [[Marvel Universe]].

The character's first appearance, in ''Conan the Barbarian'' #14 and #15, was a [[fictional crossover|crossover]] between [[Robert E. Howard]]'s Conan and [[Michael Moorcock]]'s [[Elric of Melniboné]]. As such, determining the character's actual creators is difficult; Moorcock was credited as co-plotter, [[Roy Thomas]] as plotter and scripter, and [[Barry Windsor-Smith]] as [[penciller]]. Despite his having orginated in a licensed crossover comic book, the character is owned by Marvel, and has since fought several of Marvel's modern-day [[superhero]]es.

Kulan Gath was a sorcerer in Earth's Hyborian Era, the ancient time period in which Conan the Barbarian lived. At some point, he married the witch Vammatar in an alliance to obtain the power of the demon [[Shuma-Gorath]]. He had an apprentice named Razal Gulath, and was an enemy of the immortal vampire-like [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] named [[Selene (comics)|Selene]]. In his first appearance, he sought the power of the Melnibonéan sorceress Terhali, who had been exiled to Earth and placed in suspended animation; when Terhali awoke, she disintegrated Kulan Gath with a magical bolt of energy.

This proved to be only a setback for Kulan Gath, as he had achieved effective immortality by placing his life energy into a magical amulet. He eventually regained his body, allied with Vammatar, and fought Conan and [[Red Sonja]]. Kulan Gath and his bride were apparently destroyed when they attempted to control the demon [[Shuma-Gorath]]. Kulan Gath returned again in the miniseries ''Conan: The Flame and the Fiend'', thanks to the efforts of his new wife, Armati, but he was decapitated by Conan. At some point, his body was restored and his heart was cut out by Red Sonja; a silhouetted scene in ''Marvel Saga'' #1 suggests that this may have occurred with the assistance of Conan.

Millennia later, Kulan Gath returned to life in the modern world when the necklace that housed his essence turned up at a museum display in New York City. The necklace was donned by a night watchman; the sorcerer transformed the guard's body into a duplicate of his own, which he then possessed. He was defeated by Red Sonja, who had been temporarily reincarnated in the present day in the body of [[Mary Jane Watson]], and her newfound ally [[Spider-Man]]. Spider-man later tossed the necklace off of a ferry bound for Staten Island, but was found not long afterwards by a fisherman; although the fisherman resisted Kulan Gath, a mugger who subsequently killed him did not, and when the mugger donned the necklkace, he was possessed and transformed by the wizard.

Kulan Gath, now returned to the height of his power, transformed [[Manhattan]] into a likeness of his native time. Everyone trapped on the island believed that the transformed world was the true world, with the exceptions of his enemy Spider-Man and the modern-day Sorcerer Supreme, [[Doctor Strange]]. Kulan Gath mystically bound Strange, and transformed [[Professor X]] and [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]] into a hybrid creature under his control. He also took control of the minds of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], the [[X-Men]], the [[New Mutants]] and the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]], who hunted down Spider-Man. In the end, Spider-Man and several other heroes were killed by Kulan Gath, his enemy Selene, or the mind-controlled agents of one of the two. Strange and the New Mutant [[Magik (comics)|Magik]] used their powers to change time so that the mugger who had been Kulan Gath's host had instead been slain by the time-travelling android [[Nimrod (comics)|Nimrod]], thus preventing all of the changes and deaths from having occurred. In the process of the mugger's death, Kulan Gath's amulet was lost in the New York City sewers.

Yet another fisherman later found the amulet and was transformed into Kulan Gath's new host. Kulan Gath traveled to the Latin American nation of Costa Verde, and transformed the region inhabited by the fictional Kamekeri Native Americans as he had previously transformed Manhattan. The [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], accompanied by their ally [[Silverclaw]], traveled to Costa Verde to stop him. He attempted to sacrifice Silverclaw to his demonic gods, but Silverclaw's mother, the Kamekeri goddess Pelali, died to prevent her daughter's death. The gods, having been partially summoned, still required a sacrifice, and when no other victim was offered, they took Kulan Gath to their native dimension.
