'''Lynn Michaels''' is a character in the [[Punisher]] comic books.  She works alongside the Punisher as his [[sidekick]] and love interest. 

==History==

She first appeared in Punisher War Zone #7, as a police officer attempting to catch a rapist.  After several unsuccessful tries, she teamed up with the Punisher to take him down, and succeeded in Punisher War Zone #10.  She and the Punisher worked as partners for several years until she decided it was too stressful an occupation and went to her uncle's farm in Punisher War Journal #80.

==Skills and Abilities==

She has no superpowers but is highly proficient at unarmed combat due to her police training and, like the Punisher, is not averse to using guns in her war against crime.  She wears a Punisher-inspired [[Kevlar]] costume.
