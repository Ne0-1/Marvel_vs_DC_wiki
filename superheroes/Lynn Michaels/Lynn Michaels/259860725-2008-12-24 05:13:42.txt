'''Lynn Michaels''' is a character in the [[Punisher]] comic books.  She works alongside the Punisher as his [[sidekick]]. She is known as '''Lady Punisher'''<ref>[http://mtcgonline.com/web/card/show/845 Marvel Vs. Community - Lady Punisher]</ref>. 

== History ==
She first appeared in Punisher War Zone #7, as a police officer attempting to catch a rapist.  After several unsuccessful tries, she teamed up with the Punisher to take him down, and succeeded in Punisher War Zone #10.  She and the Punisher worked as partners for several years until she decided it was too stressful an occupation and went to her uncle's farm in Punisher War Journal #80.

She has re-emerged in recent issues of [[The Punisher War Journal]], aligning herself with [[Jigsaw (Marvel Comics)|Jigsaw]].

== Fictional character biography ==
Lynn Michaels was an officer with the NYPD.  She helped out The Punisher a few times. After being frustrated with the legal system one to many times, she quit the force after a 10 year career.

She took over as The Punisher after it was believed that Frank Castle had died in an exploding building. She was also sometimes called Lady Punisher after it was discovered that Frank Castle was still alive.

She desperately tried to find Frank Castle, but when she found his War Journal, she was hurt that there was no mention of her in it and decided The Punisher wasn't for her.  What she didn't know is that the War Journal was one of several copies, some of them forgeries.

She left New York to get away from the mess she found herself in with Payback and her father never to return.

== Abilities ==
She has no superpowers but is highly proficient at unarmed combat due to her police training and, like the Punisher, is not averse to using guns in her war against crime.  She wears a Punisher-inspired [[Kevlar]] costume.
