She is known as '''Lady Punisher'''.<ref>[http://mtcgonline.com/web/card/show/845 Marvel Vs. Community - Lady Punisher]</ref>

== Fictional character biography ==
She first appeared in Punisher War Zone #7, as a police officer attempting to catch a serial rapist plauging [[Central Park]].  After several unsuccessful tries, she teams up with the Punisher to take him down, and succeeds in Punisher War Zone #10. The fight also involves several assassins pursuing the Punisher himself. 

Lynn soon becomes disenchanted with her job. She quits the force and becomes a vigilante on her own. Her efforts lead her, among many other people, to fight the corrupt anti-vigilante force known as V.I.G.I.L. At one point she infiltrates their headquarters to rescue a small-town sheriff the group was holding prisoner. 

Lynn works on and off with Frank Castle, continuing his work even after his supposed death in a skyscraper collapse. Lynn gains the nickname 'Lady Punisher'.

Lynn teams up with 'Payback' (Eddie Dyson), another Punisher-inspired vigilante, a former police officer whose family had been murdered in a mafia bombing. In her searches for Frank, she discovers his 'War Journal' and is hurt that there is no mention of her in it. She is unaware there are several copies of the Journal, some forgeries.

Lynn and Payback are targeted by various groups looking to wipe out V.I.G.I.L and anything to do with the Punisher. Lynn's uncle comes to assist them. Despite his mistakes, such as using a credit card to pay for a motel room, they survive various assassination attempts and escape the city. Lynn and Payback take up residence at her uncle's farm.<ref>Punisher War Journal #80</ref>

== Abilities ==
She has no superpowers but is highly proficient at unarmed combat due to her police training and, like the Punisher, is not averse to using guns in her war against crime.  She wears a Punisher-inspired [[Kevlar]] costume.
