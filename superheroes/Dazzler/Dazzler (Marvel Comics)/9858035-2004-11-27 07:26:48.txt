'''Dazzler''' is a [[comic book]] [[superhero]] from the [[Marvel Comics]] [[universe]]. During her lifetime, she has used the aliases Disco Dazzler, Sandy Blossom, and Lightengale, along with her real name, Alison Blaire. She first appeared in ''Uncanny X-Men #130''. 

Blaire is a [[mutant]] who possesses the ability to convert sound into light. Her powers encompass the entire spectrum of light and range of sound, but she prefers to use music to create her lightshows. She can create many things with her light, such as the typical lightshows she uses at performances, tight laser beams that can cut through steel, a protective laser force field, and with great effort, even holograms. Her potential to convert sound into light is infinite, with the one restriction being that she cannot, for unknown reasons, use her own voice to create light.

Her body, especially her eyes, protects itself against any injury that would be caused by the light she generates, or any bright light. Loud noises also do not affect her, due to her absorption of them. She can also store sound to use in the future.When in a vacuum there is no sound present, and the Dazzler cannot gather sound in order to use her powers. She also gradually loses any stored sound she has, leading to a total loss of power.

==History==

Alison was born in [[Gardendale, New York]] to Carter and Katherine Blaire on an unspecified date. Her mutant powers first manifested when she was in [[high school]]. An aspiring singer, she had been hired to sing at school [[dance]] when her [[light]]-generating abilities first appeared. Everyone at the dance assumed it was [[special effects]], and this assumption would continue until she was revealed as a mutant.

Using the [[stage name]] the Dazzler, she set out to make a name for herself in the [[music]] [[industry]] using her light powers to back up her incredible voice. Few but those closest to her knew she was actually a mutant. Time and time again after meeting the [[X-Men]] for the first time, she found herself using her abilities to fight ordinary criminals and rogue superhumans.

After moving to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] from [[New York City]], she was revealed to the general population by her then-lover and then-producer Roman Nekobah to be a mutant. This revelation destroyed her reputation entirely and she was forced into obscurity to continue her career. She ended up possessed by another mutant named [[Malice (comics)|Malice]], who was later exorcised and is presumed dead.

After her experience with Malice, she sought out the X-Men and requested training from them in her superhuman abilities. As a result, she is much more adept in the use of her powers than she was before.

She recently returned from the [[Mojo (comics)|Mojoverse]], where she had been living with her romantic partner [[Longshot]]. The two had been named rulers there and along with caring for the [[X-Babies]], they were trying to rebuild the Mojoverse into a much more hospitable place. Her musical style has once again become popular, and she has returned to her singing career.
