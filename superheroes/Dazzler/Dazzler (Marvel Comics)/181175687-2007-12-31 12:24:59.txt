'''Dazzler''' ('''Alison Blaire''') is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero#superheroines|superheroine]], associated with the [[X-Men]]. She first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #130 ([[1980#February|February 1980]]).

A [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with the ability to convert sound vibrations into light and energy beams, Dazzler was originally developed as a cross-promotional, multi-media creation between [[Casablanca Records]], Filmworks, and [[Marvel Comics]] until the tie-ins were dropped in 1980. The character was created by a committee of Marvel staff, principally writer/editor [[Tom DeFalco]] and illustrator [[John Romita, Jr.]]

Despite the fact that Dazzler was originally commissioned as a [[disco]] singer, the character shifted to other musical genres, including [[rock and roll|rock]] and [[adult contemporary music|adult contemporary]]. She starred in a self-titled solo series in the early 1980s, and later joined the cast of the [[X-Men]].  She is currently a member of the [[spin-off]] group [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]].

==Publication history==
===Origins of ''Dazzler''===
''Dazzler'' was originally a project commissioned by [[Casablanca Records]] in the mid-late 1970s, to be a cross-promotion in the mold of [[Kiss (band)|KISS]] who had two successful comic book tie-in super-specials by the end of 1977.  Marvel Comics would develop a singing super-heroine, while Casablanca would produce a singer.  The two companies would then work with Filmworks and produce a tie-in motion picture; Marvel Comics Editor-in-Chief [[Jim Shooter]] wrote a treatment for the project. [http://www.phobosweb.com/corporate/bios/shooter.html]

The character was originally conceptualized as "The Disco Queen" with powers to make people tell the truth.  Initially, no one wanted anything to do with the project.  Marvel Comics appointed former ''[[Archie Comics]]'' writer [[Tom DeFalco]] to the character and he developed some changes to the character, namely suggesting light-based powers.  [[Roger Stern]] conceived of the character's name, Dazzler, while [[John Romita, Jr.]] provided pencils.

Artist John Romita, Jr. originally intended for the character to resemble model, actress, and singer [[Grace Jones]], as seen in early depictions.  However, representatives from Filmworks -- wanting to promote model and actress [[Bo Derek]] -- insisted on design changes to reflect Derek's features.  

To promote ''Dazzler'', Casablanca wanted it cross-promoted within several key Marvel Comics titles: ''The [[X-Men]]'', '' The [[Fantastic Four]]'', and ''[[Spider-Man]]'' in particular, with Dazzler debuting in ''The Uncanny X-Men'' because she was a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] character.  However, Casablanca continued to request conceptual changes to the character's appearance and personality, leading to several cancellations of the project.  Eventually, Casablanca Records backed out of the ''Dazzler'' project altogether due to financial concerns.  Marvel Comics, left with a much-publicized new character, decided to launch the project as a monthly series.

According to writer Tom DeFalco, Dazzler was cancelled "five or six times" prior to its launch in March, 1981.  At the time, Marvel Comics was looking for other filmmakers to invest in a ''Dazzler'' cross-promotion.  However, Jim Shooter and [[Stan Lee]] decided to launch the series without such a partnership because of their "faith in the character." 

By this time, ''Dazzler #1'' was edited to reflect changes in the Marvel Comics universe and to fit the new 22-page publication format.  X-Men member Cyclops was edited out of the issue, and Kitty Pryde inserted, and an additional "origin of the Dazzler" sequence was added to fill new pages.  Also, ''Dazzler'' distanced its character from the [[disco]] genre, as the creators recognized the disco fad was fading by 1980.

In a revolutionary move, Shooter decided to release ''Dazzler #1'' exclusively to [[Direct market|comic specialty shops]], bypassing the wider circulation market.  This was the first comic exclusively delivered to comic shops - a relatively new industry for 1981. Over 400,000 copies of issue 1 were pre-sold, more than double the average comic sales amount.

===''Dazzler'': 1981-1985===
''Dazzler'' proved a success, largely due to guest-starring several key Marvel Comics characters in its first few issues: [[Spider-Man]], The [[Human Torch]], [[Doctor Doom]], [[Galactus]], The [[Hulk (comics)| Hulk]], The [[X-Men]], and [[Klaw]] were just a few of the several guest-stars who placed Dazzler squarely into the Marvel Universe.  Dazzler herself also guest-starred in Marvel titles, such as ''The Uncanny X-Men'', ''The [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'', and the Marvel crossover, ''[[Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions|Contest of Champions]]''.  

The series, however, was not free from critique. Several readers disapproved of the "real life" focus of ''Dazzler,'' including the focus on "soft plots" — career , family, relationships — rather than action-based and more traditional superhero plot devices. Dazzler's "superhero" outfit was her performance outfit, which also serves as a major disconnect from the superhero staples of the day.  Years later, DeFalco reflected on these criticisms as an inherent hypocrisy with the readership: on one hand, readers clamored for something "new", which was how ''Dazzler'' was conceived. Yet on the other, they wanted Dazzler to be a super-heroine in the mold of [[Jean Grey|Phoenix]] and conform to other super-heroic stereotypes.

[[Image:wiki dazzler gn.jpg|Cover to ''Dazzler: The Movie'', ''Marvel Graphic Novel'' #12, 1984.|150px|thumb|right]]John Romita, Jr. left ''Dazzler'' in issue #3, and was replaced by [[Frank Springer]], who penciled most of the ''Dazzler'' series.  DeFalco stayed on as chief writer through issue #6, and helped successive writer Danny Fingeroth with several of the following issues.  Fingeroth and Springer remained the ''Dazzler'' stable team through issue #27.

Eventually, ''Dazzler'' failed to adequately create its own cast and began to lose commercial appeal.  With issue #25, ''Dazzler'' became a bi-monthly publication. This schedule, along with extreme character changes and a lackluster spin-off miniseries, further complicated the character and series’ appeal to both existing and new readers. The plot focus changed so that, instead of being a singer in New York, Springer moved Dazzler to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] as an aspiring actress. To promote this new direction, Marvel had artist [[Bill Sienkiewicz]] do painted artwork pieces for several ''Dazzler'' covers, from issues #27 through #35.  Springer left ''Dazzler'' with issue #32, and returned briefly for issue #35 and the ''Dazzler: The Movie'' graphic novel.  

Marvel attempted to jump-start the series with a tie-in [[graphic novel]] and [[limited series|mini-series]] that would highlight the character's career struggles in a prejudiced world.  While the graphic novel received acclaim, the mini-series and regular ''Dazzler'' series suffered.

In a final attempt, [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]] and [[Paul Chadwick]] were assigned to ''Dazzler'' with issue #38, ditching the singer-subtext and making Dazzler more of a generic super-heroine with an official costume.  It did not save the series, and ''Dazzler'' was eventually canceled in 1985.

After this, the character would go on to a short spell as an X-Men member, before disappearing completely for much of the 1990s and early 2000s, barring occasional cameos. With the launch of ''[[Excalibur (comics)|New Excalibur]]'', where she is a cast member, she returned to monthly publication for the first time in over fifteen years.

===Behind the scenes===
Common misconceptions have resulted from the obfuscation of Dazzler's creation -- namely, several readers believe X-Men creative team [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne]] were the character's originators. Although they wrote and penciled her first appearance, they had nothing to do with the character or her series' creation.<ref>See: Howell, Richard and Carol Kalish.  "Dissecting the Dazzler!"  ''Comics Feature''.  Vol 1, No. 7.  Nov, 1980.</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Uncanny130.jpg|Dazzler's first appearance. Cover for Uncanny X-Men #130 by John Romita Jr., interiors by John Byrne (1980).|150px|thumb|left]] -->
Alison was born in Gardendale, New York to Carter and Katherine Blaire. Her [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] powers first manifested when she was in high school. An aspiring singer, she volunteered to perform at her school dance when her light-generating abilities first appeared. Everyone at the dance assumed it was a techno-based [[special effect]], and this assumption would continue until she was revealed as a mutant.

Using the [[stage name]] "Dazzler", Alison set out to make a name for herself in the music [[industry]], while using her light powers and dancing ability to enhance her performances.  It was at one of these shows that Alison met the [[X-Men]], who were fighting the forces of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]. Alison aided the X-Men this time,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #130-131</ref> but did not yet become a regular associate of the X-Men.

Few but those closest to her knew she was actually a mutant. After acquainting herself with the various [[Marvel Comics]] superheroes, Alison found herself continually using her abilities to fight ordinary criminals and rogue superhumans — often at the expense of her career ambitions. She met [[Spider-Man]], and teamed with him against the [[Lightmaster]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #203</ref> She later battled the [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]].<ref>''Dazzler'' #1-2</ref> She was next defeated by [[Doctor Doom]], and then fought [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]].<ref>''Dazzler'' #3-4</ref> She also met [[Blue Shield (comics)|Blue Shield]].<ref>''Dazzler'' #5</ref> She aided the X-Men and [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]] against the misguided [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #148</ref> She also battled the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]].<ref>''Dazzler'' #6-7</ref>

She even encountered the planet-eater [[Galactus]], who thought she was of little notice and generally ignored her.  Galactus, however, temporarily endowed her with cosmic energy, to retrieve his herald [[Terrax]] for him.<ref>''Dazzler'' #10</ref> In addition to being offered membership into the X-Men, Alison was also asked to audition for a place in the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], but declined whilst facing [[Fabian Stankowicz]], who was ultimately defeated easily by Janet Van Dyne (a.k.a. the [[Wasp (comics)| Wasp]]), saying that the superhero "trip wasn't for [her]."

After moving to Los Angeles, Alison attempted careers in [[Physical fitness|fitness]] training, [[dance|dancing]], [[model (person)|modeling]], and [[acting]]. Influenced both by her lover Roman Nekoboh, and her desire to abate the growing anti-mutant sentiment, Alison publicly declared her mutant identity. This revelation backfired, destroying her reputation and career, inflaming anti-mutant sentiment, and sent Alison into a depressive state. Forced again into hiding, she spent some time as a keyboard player in rock singer and fellow mutant [[Lila Cheney]]'s band. The band's plane crashed on tour and led to her, Lila and a band-mate being successfully rescued by [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] and his brother, [[Icarus (comics)|Joshua]]. Lila had been knocked out so Dazzler used the music Joshua played at the scene to blast a hole through the wreckage. Alison was later possessed by the psychic mutant [[Malice (comics)|Malice]]. She was saved and taken-in by the [[X-Men]]. 

During her tenure with the X-Men, Alison received greater training and control over her powers, and developed a romance with the extra-dimensional [[Longshot]]. She was also forced to work alongside [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], with whom she had a longstanding grudge. There was underlying tension between them at first (mostly on Alison's part), but over time, she eventually forgave Rogue. Dazzler struggled with her career ambitions and personal insecurities, and eventually she — along with teammates Rogue, Psylocke, Colossus, and Havok — entered the mystical Siege Perilous, leaving her in an amnesiac state. Discovered by Longshot, and devastated by the loss of her career, Alison ventured to his native "Mojoworld", and remained to help fight in the ongoing rebellion against the tyrant [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]]. Lila would again join with Dazzler in combating Mojo.

Dazzler eventually returned to Earth without Longshot after an unfortunate series of events, including miscarriage and war. She helped Jean Grey in the fight against a re-powered Magneto, who had an army of Genoshans. She and Jean led a small band of mutants to back up the original X-Men, who were in Genosha already. Dazzler even faced down Magneto himself, barely surviving the encounter. After the conclusion of this incident, the X-Men offered Alison support for her personal problems, but she declined.

Among Dazzler fans in comics are the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]]<ref>Uncanny X-Men #217</ref>, former teammate [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], [[Julia Carpenter]]<ref>Ms Marvel vol. 2 #7</ref>, The [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], [[Molly Hayes]] from ''[[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]]'', and [[Kitty Pryde]].

===New Excalibur===
{{main|Excalibur (comics)#New Excalibur (2005)}}

The Dazzler later re-established her musical career, marketing her trademark disco image in the [[Trance music|Techno/Trance]] genre.  Alison has since moved her career abroad to England and recently has joined with X-Men allies such as the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] and [[Captain Britain]]. she was recently reunited with Longshot in the ''[[X-Men: Die by the Sword]]'' miniseries, but Longshot is currently suffering from [[amnesia]] and does not remember her.

==Powers and abilities==
Dazzler is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with the superhuman ability to transduce sonic vibrations which reach her body into various types of light. This ability seems to operate over a great range of frequencies, including the audible spectrum (35 to 16,500 cycles per second), and a great variation of sound pressure levels regardless of the complexity, dissonance, or randomness of the sound. For example, a car crash and a symphonic passage of equal duration will both produce usable incoming acoustic vibrations.

Dazzler, however, prefers utilizing the sound of music, particularly that which is rhythmically sustained. Not only is music more pleasant to her ears, but the steady beat of contemporary popular provides a more constant source of sound to convert. The precise means by which this conversion process works is as yet unknown, but it must involve a body-wide energy field that controls the energy levels of the outer electron shells of her body in such a way as to cause the cascaded release of photons.

The field thus operates in a similar fashion as the process that creates a laser (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation) and apparently has the same efficiency as a laser (99.9 percent). The released energy is far greater than the incoming kinetic energy and therefore must involve another, unknown energy source as well. Left undirected, Dazzler's light will radiate from her body in all directions, producing regular flashes of white light (white light is a mixture of all portions of the visible spectrum). By conscious control over the light she produces, she can control its direction, frequency (color), amplitude (intensity), and duration.

Apparently Dazzler must consciously or subconsciously will the light to leave her body. Otherwise, light would "leak" from her at all times, even when she was asleep or unconscious. Dazzler can produce numerous effects with the light she converts from sonic vibrations. She can simply cause a bright glow all about her body. She can create very simple patterns out of rays of light like circles, squares, triangles, and stars. With effort, she can even create holograms of human beings and other three-dimensional beings and objects. She can create a pulse of light on the order of several thousand [[watt]]s of power, which temporarily blinds people with its brilliance. She can create a chaotic cascade of sparkling lights and colors that severely upsets other people's equilibrium, or a pulsating strobe-light effect. By concentrating, Dazzler can generate a coherent beam of light, approximating a laser beam, with which she can cut through virtually anything.

Her training with the X-Men, especially with Cyclops, has taught her how to produce such laser-like beams with much less effort than it previously required of her. She generally directs the laser from a single finger when she requires precision in its use, since pointing aids her in defining its direction. But she can also direct laser blasts from both hands at once when she wishes, for example, to demolish a large structure. She most often uses her hands for directing her light effects, but she could also use other parts of her body.

Since studying with the X-Men, she has become adept at directing her blinding strobe light blast from her eyes. The Dazzler has also learned how to create a protective force field about herself with laser light that can deflect or vaporize oncoming projectiles. The most powerful manifestation of her abilities is a concentrated beam of solid photons she usually fires from her right index finger. The beam is extremely powerful and as a consequence uses a great deal of her energy reserves. She has since learned how to produce these blasts without draining herself, while still providing them with considerable power. She has also recently shown the ability to form her photon emissions into a solid, sword-like construct. Dazzler's potential to convert sound to light is unlimited. Curiously, she cannot use her own un-amplified voice as a source of sound for her transduction abilities. Dazzler's body, especially her eyes, shields itself against any injurious effects of her light transducing abilities and against those of bright lights in general. Her ability to transduce sound also protects her from being deafened by loud noises. 

Since the events of ''Dazzler: The Movie'', Alison's body can store light energy for future discharge on occasional instances of extreme duress.

Dazzler is a highly skilled athlete, and has become a good hand-to-hand combatant thanks to her training with the X-Men, and with the Gladiators. In addition, she is a talented singer, actress, and dancer. She is also a highly accomplished roller skater.

Recently, Dazzler has displayed an unusual ability to completely recover from life threatening or fatal injuries{{issue}}. The nature of this new ability has yet to be explained.

Thanks to [[Professor X]], Dazzler's costume contains devices that enable her to store sonic energy more efficiently and to gauge and focus the light she generates with greater skill. She formerly carried a customized radio/cassette tape player to provide her with sound until she acquired the sound storing devices in her costume.  She occasionally wears a pair of roller blades which magnetically adheres to her bots; she can use the skates to move at high speed.

==Other characters named Dazzler==
[[Warren Worthington III|Angel]]'s uncle, Burt Worthington, also went by the name the Dazzler.<ref>''Marvel Tales'' #30</ref> The first Dazzler killed Warren's father, Warren Worthington, Jr.

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
[[Image:Dazzler aoa.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Dazzler from ''Amazing X-Men'' #1.  Art by Andy Kubert.]]

Dazzler appears as a member of the X-Men.  She is a chain smoker but is more skilled with her powers, being able to create hard-light constructs, as well as manipulate both light and sound energies.  With this new power-set, the Dazzler serves as a one-woman training facility, as well as a messenger via holographic transmissions.<ref>Nicieza, Fabian and Andy Kubert.  ''Amazing X-Men'' #1-2.</ref>  She was romantically involved with [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]] and did not accompany the main team of X-Men in the final assault on Apocalypse.  
<br>
Dazzler was one of only a few characters involved in the original Age of Apocalypse to be brought back for the ''Age of Apocalypse 10th Anniversary'' mini-series.  Like many of the other X-Men, Dazzler's costume in the 10th anniversary reflects an updated take on her original costume: the silver jumpsuit. Against the battle with Mr. Sinister's Sinister Six, Dazzler was swallowed within Cloak's dark dimension, but is ultimately saved by a lightning bolt from Storm which forces Cloak to spit her back out.

===The End===
[[Image:Dazzler theend.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Dazzler, Iceman, and Storm from ''X-Men: The End (Vol. 3)'' #4.  Art by Sean Chen.]]

In this series about the X-Men's hypothetical future, Dazzler reverted her costume to reflect her classic, silver design, continuing her career as a singer.   Dazzler, an occasional "reserve" team member, joined Storm and X-Men members Iceman, Bishop, Psylocke, and Sage for Xavier's "Plan B" team.  Co-piloting the ship to the extraterrestrial Shi'ar homeworld, Dazzler uses her powers to create a lightshow, calming the passions of the battling X-Men and Shi'ar Imperial Guard.  The series' primary villain — Cassandra Nova — then manifests, slaying the Imperial Guard and leaving the remaining X-Men as her sole adversaries.  Dazzler uses her lasers to blast a hole through Cassandra's head, to no avail.  Dazzler was then killed by Cassandra Nova in retaliation, along with several of her teammates.  Dazzler is believed to be among the slain X-Men that were invited to a plane of higher existence by the Phoenix.<ref>Claremont, Chris and Sean Chen.  ''X-Men: The End: Book 3'' #5-6.</ref>

===House of M===
[[Image:Dazzler hom.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Dazzler from ''House of M'' #2.  Art by Olivier Coipel.]]

When Wanda Maximoff, the Scarlet Witch, used her reality-altering powers to change the world, Dazzler became one of the most famous mutants on Earth.  After having a successful singing career as a teenager, the Dazzler continued her career as the world's primary media personality via her syndicated talk show.<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael and Oliver Coipel.  ''House of M'' #2.</ref>

The ''House of M'' newsprint special featured a tabloid-esque "blind" article, indicating that Alison's signature lightshow was fading due to a rare blood disorder, which was causing her to lose her mutation.  Storm used Alison's popular talk show to sound off on her disapproval of Magneto's handling of mutant affairs and Mr. Sinister was seen watching the Alison show when Deadpool went to rescue an infant Cable.

Author [[Brian Michael Bendis]] originally scripted for the Dazzler to be this alternate reality's answer to [[Oprah]].{{Fact|date=October 2007}}

===Marvel Zombies=== 
[[Image:Dazzler marvelzombies.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Dazzler from ''Marvel Zombies vs. Army of Darkness'' #2.  Art by Fabiano Neves.]]

Dazzler appears as one of the few uninfected mutants in the limited series [[Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness|Marvel Zombies vs. Army of Darkness]]. There, she is almost eaten by an infected [[Bucky#Winter Soldier|Winter Soldier]] until he gets killed by [[Ash Williams]]. Ash falls in love with Dazzler because of her good looks, but she doesn't reciprocate his feelings. As a thanks for saving her, Dazzler agrees to help Ash find the Necronomicon book that might put an end to the zombies.  The duo pair up with the Scarlet Witch to discover that the Necronomicon is being kept at Dr. Doom's fortress in Latveria. Ash discovers the Necronomicon, but unfortunately it has nothing to do with this worlds infection. On his way back he meets an imprisoned [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]]. Because of the nature of her powers, Ash believes the Enchantress is unaffected. In a confrontation with Dazzler, the Enchantress bites off her finger, infecting her with the zombification virus. Before she can turn, [[Doctor Doom]] appears and destroys both women.

This series is the first since Dazzler's 1980 solo series to feature the character primarily as a Marvel Comics heroine, with greater links to superheroes such as the Avengers and Fantastic Four, rather than as an X-Men member.

Dazzler's presence in the "Marvel Zombies vs. Army of Darkness" limited series may very well discredit the crossover as part of the [[Marvel Zombies]] canon, as a zombified Dazzler is quite visible in the bottom left corner of the large center cell on page 13 of Issue #23 of [[Ultimate Fantastic Four]] -- part 3 of the three-part arc that introduced the "Marvel Zombies" Universe [The three part arc consisted of "Ultimate Fantastic Four issue #'s 21-23]. As noted, Dazzler was destroyed - disintegrated - by Dr. Doom in the "Marvel Zombies Vs. Army of Darkness" limited series and hence, never lived to become a zombie.

===Ultimate Dazzler===
[[Image:UltimateDazzler.jpg|frame|Dazzler from ''Ultimate X-Men'' #42.  Art by David Finch.]]

The [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate]] incarnation of Dazzler (Alison Blaire) is introduced as a punk rock singer in ''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'' #42.  Alison briefly joins [[Emma Frost#Ultimate universe|Emma Frost]]'s [[New Mutants|Academy of Tomorrow]] when promised a record deal, but joins the [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Men]] after they rescue her from a [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] attack. There she is called "Dazzler", the name of her band. Alison often shows a lack of enthusiasm for the X-Men or their missions, but after learning of a proposed public execution of a mutant, she convinces a group of teammates to go on a rescue mission. When the mission goes astray and [[Archangel (comics)#Ultimate Angel|Angel]] is captured, Dazzler takes initiative and leads the team on a rescue mission. This leads to the accidental release of a Longshot.

Later, she and Angel go out on a presumed 'date'; really an effort to get themselves involved with the X-Men's latest mission; preventing the ''Academy of Tomorrow'' students from attacking the [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]]. During the incident, power is lost and one of the inmates, [[Lady Deathstrike#Ultimate Lady Deathstrike|Deathstrike]] impales Dazzler through the chest. Ironically, Deathstrike is defeated by the very killer Dazzler has assisted before.

Dazzler stays in a coma for several weeks, visited many times by [[Nightcrawler (comics)#Ultimate Nightcrawler|Nightcrawler]] who has an unrequited crush on her. Unfortunately many factors have combined to unhinge Nightcrawler and as soon as she is able to be moved, he fools her into thinking they must escape. Initially trusting him, she cooperates until the rest of the X-Men rescue her. 

The others, understanding Nightcrawler is mentally ill, plan to rehabilitate him. Dazzler does not accept this and quits the team in protest. She has since been labeled as one of the "most important" mutants to the X-Men's cause by the future [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]].

Dazzler's powers allow her to convert sonic vibrations into various forms of [[Photovoltaics|photovoltaic]] energy, including concussive photon pulses, laser beams, hard light [[holographic]] illusions, destructive force fields, light fog, hypnotic bursts of light, and levitation. Her photon pulses have been shown as strong enough to destroy several Sentinals at once.

===Interlocking Technologies===
:A woman from Earth-721, was given the powers and appearance of Dazzler by Interlocking Technologies.  She came to Earth-616 and impersonated the original Alison.  She toured the Western States of the USA in Dazzler's original costume.  However, she was ultimately discovered, stripped of her powers and returned to Earth-721<ref>''She-Hulk'' vol. 2 #21</ref>

===X-Babies===
:A member of the [[X-Babies]] is imaged after Dazzler.  It is unknown is she is still alive or has been terminated since Alison left the X-Men<ref>''Uncanny X-Men Annual'' #12</ref>

===Earth X===
:In the Earth X timeline, Dazzler had her heart torn out by Mephisto though due to the "death" of Death, she lives on in constant agony<ref>''Paradise X'' #2</ref> 

===What If?===
:In a two similar What If? stories (What if Cable had destroyed the X-Men? and What if Magneto took over the U.S.A.?) based on ''Uncanny X-Men'' #269, Dazzler is an agent of Magneto<ref>''What If...?'' vol. 2 #46</ref>.  She is ultimately killed by a Sentinel warhead<ref>''What If...?'' vol. 2 #47</ref>.  The second Earth is designated Earth-21993.

==In other media==
===Television===
*Dazzler appeared in the ''[[Pryde of the X-Men]]'' animated pilot. Alexandra Stoddart provided Dazzler's voice.  Her powers were exaggerated in this cartoon, with Professor Xavier explaining that she had the ability to transform sound into "powerful bolts of light."
*She also guest-starred in the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men animated series]]'': Dazzler appeared as a background character in "Mojovision", and was central to the plot of "Dark Phoenix Saga Part 1: Dazzled", in which [[Donald Pierce]] tries to kidnap her in order to force her to join the Inner Circle of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]].

===Video games===
*Dazzler was a playable character in the [[X-Men (arcade game)|''X-Men'' arcade game]] released by [[Konami]] in 1992.  
*Dazzler was also a playable in two early PC X-Men games by [[Paragon Software]]: ''X-Men: Madness in Murderworld'' and the later ''[[X-Men II: The Fall of the Mutants]]''.
*Dazzler appears as a non-playable character (NPC) in ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]''.  Raven designed an online-exclusive "Dazzler's Nightclub level for a mission which re-enacts Uncanny X-Men #130, where the X-Men must protect Dazzler from the Hellfire Club guards.  Closer inspection of the game's files reveals a dialogue portrait, HUD head, and unique character select animations for Dazzler--indicating that at some stage of development Raven Software had intended her to be a playable character.

===Films===
*In the film ''[[X2: X-Men United]]'', her name appears on a list of names [[Mystique]] scrolls through on Stryker's computer while looking for Magneto's file.

===Other comics===
*In issue 5 of the bimonthly [[Simpsons Comics]] from [[Bongo Comics|Bongo]] entitled "When Bongos Collide", the citizens of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] were transformed into "costumed super-characters." [[Lisa Simpson]] called herself "The Jazzler" and had powers very similar to Dazzler's. The only difference is that Lisa draws her powers from her saxophone.
