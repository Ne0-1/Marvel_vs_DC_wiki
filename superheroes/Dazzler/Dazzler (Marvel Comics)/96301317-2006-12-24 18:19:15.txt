'''Dazzler (Alison Blaire)''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]], associated with the [[X-Men]]. She first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #130 ([[1980#February|February 1980]]).

A [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] with the ability to convert sound vibrations into light and energy beams, Dazzler was originally developed as a cross-promotional, multi-media creation between [[Casablanca Records]], [[Filmworks]], and [[Marvel Comics]] until the tie-ins were dropped in 1980. The character was created by a committee of Marvel staff, principally writer/editor [[Tom DeFalco]] and illustrator [[John Romita Jr.]].

Despite the fact that Dazzler was originally commissioned as a [[disco]] singer, the character shifted to other musical genres, including [[rock and roll|rock]] and [[adult contemporary]]. She starred in a self-titled solo series in the early [[1980s]], and later joined the cast of the [[X-Men]].  She is currently a member of the [[spin-off]] group [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]].

==Publication history==
===Origins of ''Dazzler''===

''Dazzler'' was originally a project commissioned by [[Casablanca Records]] in the mid-late 1970s, to be a cross-promotion in the mold of [[KISS (band)|KISS]] who had two successful comic book tie-in super-specials by the end of [[1977]].  Marvel Comics would develop a singing superheroine, while Casablanca would produce a singer.  The two companies would then work with Filmworks and produce a tie-in motion picture; Marvel Comics Editor-in-Chief [[Jim Shooter]] wrote a treatment for the project. [http://www.phobosweb.com/corporate/bios/shooter.html]

[[Image:wiki_dazzler_aa.jpg|Excerpt from a portrait of Dazzler, depicted as African American, and the X-Men with [[Neil Bogart]].  John Romita Jr., 1979.|150px|thumb|left]]The character was originally conceptualized as "The Disco Queen" with powers to make people tell the truth.  Initially, no one wanted anything to do with the project.  Marvel Comics appointed former ''[[Archie Comics]]'' writer [[Tom DeFalco]] to the character and he developed some changes to the character, namely suggesting light-based powers.  [[Roger Stern]] conceived of the character's name, Dazzler, while [[John Romita Jr.]] provided pencils.

Artist John Romita, Jr. originally intended for the character to resemble model, actress, and singer [[Grace Jones]], as seen in early depictions.  However, representatives from Filmworks -- wanting to promote model and actress [[Bo Derek]] -- insisted on design changes to reflect Derek's features.  

To promote ''Dazzler'', Casablanca wanted it cross-promoted within several key Marvel Comics titles: [[X-Men|The X-Men]], [[Fantastic Four|The Fantastic Four]], and [[Spider-Man]] in particular, with Dazzler debuting in ''The Uncanny X-Men'' first because she was a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] character.  However, Casablanca continued to request conceptual changes to the character's appearance and personality, leading to several cancellations of the project.  Eventually, Casablanca Records backed out of the ''Dazzler'' project altogether due to financial concerns.  Marvel Comics, left with a much-publicized new character, decided to launch the project as a monthly series.

According to writer Tom DeFalco, Dazzler was cancelled "five or six times" prior to its launch in March, 1981.  At the time, Marvel Comics was looking for other filmmakers to invest in a ''Dazzler'' cross-promotion.  However, Jim Shooter and [[Stan Lee]] decided to launch the series without such a partnership because of their "faith in the character." 

By this time, ''Dazzler #1'' was edited to reflect changes in the Marvel Comics universe and to fit the new 22-page publication format.  X-Men member Cyclops was edited out of the issue, and Kitty Pryde inserted, and an additional "origin of the Dazzler" sequence was added to fill new pages.  Also, ''Dazzler'' distanced its character from the [[disco]] genre, as the creators recognized the disco fad was fading by 1980.

In a revolutionary move, Shooter decided to release ''Dazzler #1'' exclusively to [[Direct market|comic specialty shops]], bypassing the wider circulation market.  This was the first comic exclusively delivered to comic shops - a relatively new industry for 1981. Over 400,000 copies of issue 1 were pre-sold, more than double the average comic sales amount.

===''Dazzler'': 1981-1985===

''Dazzler'' proved a success, largely due to guest-starring several key Marvel Comics characters in its first few issues: [[Spider-Man]], [[Human Torch|The Human Torch]], [[Dr. Doom]], [[Galactus]], [[Hulk (comics)|The Hulk]], [[X-Men|The X-Men]], and [[Klaw]] were just a few of the several guest-stars who placed Dazzler squarely into the Marvel Universe.  Dazzler herself also guest-starred in Marvel titles, such as X-Men, [[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]], and the Marvel crossover, [[Contest of Champions]].  

The series, however, was not free from critique. Several readers disapproved of the "real life" focus of ''Dazzler,'' including the focus on "soft plots" -- career, family, relationships -- rather than action-based and more traditional superhero plot devices. Dazzler's "superhero" outfit was her performance outfit, which also serves as a major disconnect from the superhero staples of the day.  Years later, DeFalco reflected on these criticisms as an inherent hypocrisy with the readership: on one hand, readers clamored for something "new," which was how ''Dazzler'' was conceived. Yet on the other, they wanted Dazzler to be a superheroine in the mold of [[Jean Grey|Phoenix]] and conform to other superheroic stereotypes.

[[Image:wiki_dazzler_gn.jpg|Cover to ''Dazzler: The Movie'', Marvel Graphic Novel #12, 1984.|150px|thumb|right]]John Romita, Jr. left ''Dazzler'' in issue #3, and was replaced by [[Frank Springer]], who penciled most of the ''Dazzler'' series.  DeFalco stayed on as chief writer through issue #6, and helped successive writer Danny Fingeroth with several of the following issues.  Fingeroth and Springer remained the ''Dazzler'' stable team through issue #27.

Eventually, ''Dazzler'' failed to adequately create its own cast and began to lose commercial appeal.  With issue #25, ''Dazzler'' became a bi-monthly publication. This schedule, along with extreme character changes and a lackluster spin-off miniseries, further complicated the character and series’ appeal to both existing and new readers. The plot focus changed so that, instead of being a singer in New York, Springer moved Dazzler to [[Los Angeles]] as an aspiring actress. To promote this new direction, Marvel had artist [[Bill Sienkiewicz]] do painted artwork pieces for several ''Dazzler'' covers, from issues #27 through #35.  Springer left ''Dazzler'' with issue #32, and returned briefly for issue #35 and the ''Dazzler: The Movie'' graphic novel.  

Marvel attempted to jump-start the series with a tie-in [[graphic novel]] and [[mini-series]] that would highlight the character's career struggles in a prejudiced world.  While the graphic novel received acclaim, the mini-series and regular ''Dazzler'' series suffered.

In a final attempt, [[Archie Goodwin (comic book writer)|Archie Goodwin]] and [[Paul Chadwick]] were assigned to ''Dazzler'' with issue #38, ditching the singer-subtext and making Dazzler more of a generic superheroine with an official costume.  It did not save the series, and ''Dazzler'' was eventually cancelled in 1985.

After this, the character would go on to a short spell as an X-Men member, before disappearing completely for much of the 1990s and early 2000s, barring occasional cameos. With the launch of ''[[Excalibur (comics)|New Excalibur]]'', where she is a cast member, she has just returned to monthly publication for the first time in over fifteen years.

==Fictional character history==
[[Image:Uncanny130.jpg|Dazzler's first appearance. Cover for Uncanny X-Men #130 by John Romita Jr., interiors by John Byrne (1980).|150px|thumb|left]]
Alison was born in Gardendale, New York to Carter and Katherine Blaire on an unspecified date. Her mutant powers first manifested when she was in high school. An aspiring singer, she volunteered to perform at her school dance when her [[light]]-generating abilities first appeared. Everyone at the dance assumed it was a techno-based [[special effect]], and this assumption would continue until she was revealed as a mutant.
<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:dazzler05.jpg|thumb|Cyclops reveals to Dazzler that she is a mutant.]] -->

Using the [[stage name]] “Dazzler,” Alison set out to make a name for herself in the [[music]] [[industry]], while using her light powers and dancing ability to enhance her performances.  It was at one of these shows that Alison met the [[X-Men]].  Few but those closest to her knew she was actually a mutant.  After acquainting herself with the various [[Marvel Comics]] superheroes, Alison found herself continually using her abilities to fight ordinary criminals and rogue superhumans –- often at the expense of her career ambitions.  In addition to being offered membership into the X-Men, Alison was also asked to join the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] twice -- all of which she declined.
<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:dazzler-costume1.jpg|thumb|right|Dazzler's first costume.]] -->

After moving to Los Angeles, Alison attempted careers in fitness training, modeling, and acting. Influenced both by her lover Roman Nekoboh, and her desire to abate the growing anti-mutant sentiment, Alison publicly declared her mutant identity. This revelation backfired, destroying her reputation and career, inflaming anti-mutant sentiment, and sent Alison into a depressive state. Forced again into hiding as a keyboard player in rock singer and fellow mutant [[Lila Cheney]]'s band, Alison was possessed by the psychic mutant [[Malice (comics)|Malice]], and was later saved and taken-in by the [[X-Men]]. 

During her tenure with the X-Men, Alison received greater training and control over her powers, and developed a romance with the extra-dimensional [[Longshot]].  She was also forced to work alongside [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], with whom she had a longstanding grudge. There was underlying tension between them at first(mostly on Alison's part), but over time, she eventually forgave Rogue. Dazzler struggled with her career ambitions and personal insecurities, and eventually she -- along with teammates Rogue, Psylocke, Colossus, and Havok -- entered the mystical Siege Perilous, leaving her in an amnesiac state.  Discovered by Longshot, and devastated by the loss of her career, Alison ventured to his native "Mojoworld," and remained to help fight in the ongoing rebellion against the tyrant [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]]. Dazzler eventually returned to Earth without Longshot after an unfortunate series of events, including miscarriage and war.  The X-Men offered Alison support, but she declined.

The Dazzler later re-established her musical career, marketing her trademark disco image in the [[Trance music|Techno/Trance]] genre.  Alison has since moved her career abroad to England and recently has joined with X-Men allies such as the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] and [[Captain Britain]].

==Powers and abilities==
Dazzler is a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] who possesses the ability to convert sound into light.  Her powers encompass the entire light spectrum.  While Dazzler can absorb all forms of external sound, she prefers to use music with its rhythmic patterns.   These light projections are very versatile, ranging from the typical lightshow, to catatonic [[strobe light|strobe]] flashes, to pin-point laser beams, to solid photon blasts, to protective force fields. She can also use light energy to propel herself through the air, allowing her to fly.  Her potential to convert sound into light is almost infinite, with the one restriction being that she cannot, for unknown reasons, use her own voice to create light. 

Her body, especially her eyes, protects itself against any injury that would be caused by either external or self-generated light sources.  Loud noises also have no effect due to her ability to absorb them. Since the events of ''Dazzler: The Movie'', Alison’s body can store light energy for future discharge. Dazzler is also capable of redirecting absorbed or stored sound energy back as pure concussive force.

==Trivia==   
Common misconceptions have resulted from the obfuscation of Dazzler's creation -- namely, several readers believe X-Men creative team Chris Claremont and John Byrne were the character's originators. Although they wrote and pencilled her first appearance, they had nothing to do with the character or series' creation. Those roles went largely to Tom DeFalco and John Romita, Jr.<ref>See: Howell, Richard and Carol Kalish.  "Dissecting the Dazzler!"  ''Comics Feature''.  Vol 1, No. 7.  Nov, 1980.</ref>

==Ultimate Dazzler==
[[Image:UltimateDazzler.jpg|frame|Dazzler from ''Ultimate X-Men'' #42.  Art by David Finch.]]

The [[Ultimate Universe|Ultimate]] incarnation of Dazzler (Alison Blaire) is introduced as a punk rock singer in ''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'' #42.  Alison briefly joins [[Emma Frost#Ultimate universe|Emma Frost’s]] [[Academy of Tomorrow]] when promised a record deal, but joins the [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Men]] after they rescue her from a [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] attack. There she is called "Dazzler," the name of her band. Alison often shows a lack of enthusiasm for the X-Men or their missions, but after learning of a proposed public execution of a mutant, she convinces a group of teammates to go on a rescue mission. When the mission goes astray and [[Archangel (comics)#Ultimate Angel|Angel]] is captured, Dazzler takes initiative and leads the team on a rescue mission. Later while out on a date with Angel, Dazzler ends up in a fight to help prevent the escape of [[Magneto (comics)#Ultimate Magneto|Magneto]] from the [[Triskelion]]. During the fight, she is injured by [[Lady Deathstrike#Ultimate Lady Deathstrike|Deathstrike]]. For a while, Dazzler was in the hospital in a coma, and was frequently visited by [[Nightcrawler#Ultimate Nightcrawler|Nightcrawler]] who has an unrequited crush on her. Shortly following her regaining consciousness, Nightcrawler abducted her from her hospital room to a secluded cave, an action fueled by a growing irrational obsession with her, but she was rescued by the remaining X-Men. She angrily quit the team partially to resume her music career, but mainly in protest of Xavier's intent to rehabilitate Nightcrawler.

Dazzler’s powers allow her to convert sonic vibrations into various forms of [[Photovoltaics|photovoltaic]] energy, including photon pulses, laser beams, [[hard light]] holographic illusions, destructive force fields, light fog, hypnotic bursts of light, and levitation. Her photon pulses have shown strong enough to send people soaring in the air.
