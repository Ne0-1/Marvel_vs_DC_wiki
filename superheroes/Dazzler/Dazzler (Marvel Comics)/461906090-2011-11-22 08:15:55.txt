'''Dazzler''' ('''Alison Blaire''') is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[Superhero#Female superheroes|superheroine]], associated with the [[X-Men]]. She first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #130 (February [[1980 in comics|1980]]).

A [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with the ability to convert sound vibrations into light and energy beams, Dazzler was originally developed as a cross-promotional, multi-media creation between [[Casablanca Records]] and [[Marvel Comics]] until the tie-ins were dropped in 1980. The character was created by a [[design by committee|committee]] of Marvel staff, principally writer/editor [[Tom DeFalco]] and illustrator [[John Romita, Jr.]]

Despite the fact that Dazzler was originally commissioned as a [[disco]] singer, the character shifted to other musical genres, including [[rock and roll|rock]] and [[adult contemporary music|adult contemporary]]. She starred in a self-titled solo series in the early [[1980s in comics|1980s]] which lasted 42 issues, a [[Marvel Graphic Novel]] titled ''Dazzler: The Movie'', a 4 issue limited-series co-starring Hank "The Beast" McCoy titled ''Beauty and The Beast'', and later joined the cast of the [[X-Men]]. She was briefly a member of the [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] group [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] but has since re-joined the X-Men.

==Publication history==
===Origins of ''Dazzler''===
[[Image:Debut of Dazzler.jpg|200px|left|thumb|First appearance of the Dazzler]]
''Dazzler'' was originally a project commissioned by [[Casablanca Records]] in the mid-late [[1970s in comics|1970s]], to be a cross-promotion in the mold of [[Kiss (band)|KISS]], who had two successful comic book tie-in super-specials by the end of 1977. Marvel Comics would develop a singing superhero, while Casablanca would produce a singer. The two companies would then work with Filmworks and produce a tie-in motion picture; Marvel Comics Editor-in-Chief [[Jim Shooter]] wrote a treatment for the project.<ref>[http://www.phobosweb.com/corporate/bios/shooter.html]</ref><ref>[http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2008/06/26/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-161/ Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #161], [[Comic Book Resources]], June 26, 2008</ref>

The character was originally conceptualized as "The Disco Queen" with the power to make people tell the truth. Initially, no one wanted anything to do with the project{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}. Marvel Comics appointed former ''[[Archie Comics]]'' writer [[Tom DeFalco]] to the character and he developed some changes to the character, namely suggesting light-based powers{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}. [[Roger Stern]] conceived of the character's name, Dazzler, while [[John Romita, Jr.]] provided pencils.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Artist John Romita, Jr. originally intended for the character to resemble model, actress, and singer [[Grace Jones]], as seen in early depictions.<ref>[http://twomorrows.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=661][Modern Masters Volume Eighteen: John Romita Jr. TwoMorrows Publishing July 2008]</ref> However, representatives from Filmworks &ndash; wanting to promote model and actress [[Bo Derek]] &ndash; insisted on design changes to reflect Derek's features.<ref>[http://twomorrows.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=661] [Modern Masters Volume Eighteen: John Romita Jr. TwoMorrows Publishing July 2008]</ref>

To promote ''Dazzler'', Casablanca wanted it cross-promoted within several key Marvel Comics titles: ''The [[X-Men]]'', '' The [[Fantastic Four]]'', and ''[[Spider-Man]]'' in particular{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}, with Dazzler debuting in ''The Uncanny X-Men'' because she was a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] character. However, Casablanca continued to request conceptual changes to the character's appearance and personality, leading to several cancellations of the project.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Eventually, Casablanca Records backed out of the ''Dazzler'' project altogether due to financial concerns. Marvel Comics, left with a much-publicized new character, decided to launch the project as a monthly series.

According to writer Tom DeFalco, Dazzler was canceled "five or six times" prior to its launch in March [[1981 in comics|1981]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}. At the time, Marvel Comics was looking for other filmmakers to invest in a ''Dazzler'' cross-promotion{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}. However, Jim Shooter and [[Stan Lee]] decided to launch the series without such a partnership because of their "faith in the character."{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

By this time, ''Dazzler #1'' was edited to reflect changes in the Marvel Comics universe and to fit the new 22-page publication format. X-Men member [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] was edited out of the issue, and [[Kitty Pryde]] inserted, and an additional "origin of the Dazzler" sequence was added to fill new pages. Also, ''Dazzler'' distanced its character from the [[disco]] genre, as the creators recognized the disco fad was fading by 1980.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

In a revolutionary move, Shooter decided to release ''Dazzler #1'' exclusively to [[Direct market|comic specialty shops]], bypassing the wider circulation market. This was the first comic exclusively delivered to comic shops - a relatively new industry for 1981. Over 400,000 copies of issue 1 were pre-sold, more than double the average comic sales amount.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

===''Dazzler'': 1981-1985===
''Dazzler'' proved a success, largely due to the many Marvel Comics characters in its first few issues; [[Spider-Man]], the [[Human Torch]], [[Doctor Doom]], [[Galactus]], the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], the [[X-Men]], and [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Klaw]] were just a few of the several guest stars who placed Dazzler squarely into the [[Marvel Universe]]. Dazzler herself also guest starred in Marvel titles, such as ''The Uncanny X-Men'', ''The [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'', and the Marvel crossover, ''[[Contest of Champions]]''.

The series, however, was not free from critique. Several readers disapproved of the "real life" focus of ''Dazzler,'' including the focus on "soft plots" — career, family, relationships — rather than action-based and more traditional superhero plot devices.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Dazzler's "superhero" outfit was her performance outfit, which also serves as a major disconnect from the superhero staples of the day. Years later, DeFalco reflected on these criticisms as an inherent hypocrisy with the readership: on one hand, readers clamored for something "new", which was how ''Dazzler'' was conceived. Yet on the other, they wanted Dazzler to be a superhero in the mold of [[Jean Grey|Phoenix]] and conform to other superheroic stereotypes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

[[Image:wiki dazzler gn.jpg|Cover to ''Dazzler: The Movie'', ''Marvel Graphic Novel'' #12, 1984.|150px|thumb|right]]John Romita, Jr. left ''Dazzler'' in issue #3, and was replaced by [[Frank Springer]], who penciled most of the ''Dazzler'' series. DeFalco stayed on as chief writer through issue #6, and helped successive writer Danny Fingeroth with several of the following issues. Fingeroth and Springer remained the ''Dazzler'' stable team through issue #27.

Eventually, ''Dazzler'' failed to adequately create its own cast and began to lose commercial appeal. With issue #25, ''Dazzler'' became a bi-monthly publication. This schedule, along with extreme character changes and a lackluster spin-off miniseries, further complicated the character and series’ appeal to both existing and new readers.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Springer changed Dazzler from a singer in New York to an aspiring actress in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. To promote this new direction, Marvel had artist [[Bill Sienkiewicz]] do painted artwork pieces for several ''Dazzler'' covers, from issues #27 through #35. Springer left ''Dazzler'' with issue #32, and returned briefly for issue #35 and the ''Dazzler: The Movie'' graphic novel.

Marvel attempted to jump-start the series with a tie-in [[graphic novel]] and [[limited series|miniseries]] that would highlight the character's career struggles in a prejudiced world. While the graphic novel received acclaim, the miniseries and regular ''Dazzler'' series suffered.

In a final attempt, [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]] and [[Paul Chadwick]] were assigned to ''Dazzler'' with issue #38, ditching the singer-subtext and making Dazzler more of a generic superhero with an official costume. It did not save the series, and ''Dazzler'' was eventually canceled in 1985. After that she was briefly considered as a possible ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' founding member, but the decision to resurrect [[Jean Grey]] put that idea aside.

===X-Men===
After this, the character would go on to a notable run as an X-Men member, before disappearing completely for much of the 1990s and early 2000s, barring occasional cameos. With the launch of ''[[Excalibur (comics)|New Excalibur]]'', she returned to monthly publication for the first time as a prominent cast member in over fifteen years.

When Marvel forcibly canceled New Excalibur, Dazzler was brought back to be a supporting character in Uncanny X-Men written by [[Matt Fraction]]. She is currently an active member of the X-Men.

In February 2010 Marvel announced a one-shot ''Dazzler'' special by writer [[Jim McCann (writer)|Jim McCann]] and artist Kalman Andrasofszky would be published in May.<ref>{{cite web | author= Richards, Dave| date=2010-02-08| title=MCCANN MAKES DAZZLER SING ONCE MORE | work=[[Comic Book Resources]] | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=24753| accessdate=2010-03-19}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Uncanny130.jpg|Dazzler's first appearance. Cover for Uncanny X-Men #130 by John Romita Jr., interiors by John Byrne (1980).|150px|thumb|left]] -->
Alison was born in Gardendale, New York to Carter and Katherine Blaire. Her [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] powers first manifested when she was in high school. An aspiring singer, she volunteered to perform at her school dance when her light-generating abilities first appeared. Everyone at the dance assumed it was a technologically-generated [[special effect]], an assumption commonly made before she reveals herself to be a mutant later in her life.

Using the [[stage name]] "Dazzler", Alison sets out to make a name for herself in the [[music industry]], using her light powers and dancing ability to enhance her performances. It is at one of her shows that Alison first meets the [[X-Men]] who are attacked by the forces of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]. Angry at the interruption of her show, Alison lashes out in anger at the Hellfire intruders, unintentionally making one of them [[catatonic]]. Alison subsequently aids the X-Men in finding [[Kitty Pryde]]. She had always assumed that life as a disco queen would be exciting but finds the fight with the X-Men's enemies going a bit too far. Thus she turns down their offer to join the team.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #130-131</ref>

Dazzler hides her status as a mutant from all but those closest to her. After acquainting herself with the various [[Marvel Comics]] superheroes, Alison finds herself continually using her abilities to fight both ordinary criminals and rogue superhumans — often at the expense of her career ambitions. On one occasion, she meets [[Spider-Man]], and teams with him against the [[Lightmaster]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #203</ref> She later battles the [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]],<ref>''Dazzler'' #1-2</ref> is overwhelmed by [[Doctor Doom]], the [[Absorbing Man]] and then fights off [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]].<ref>''Dazzler'' #3-4</ref> She briefly allies with the [[Blue Shield (comics)|Blue Shield]],<ref>''Dazzler'' #5</ref> and aids the X-Men and [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]] against the misguided [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]].<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #148">''Uncanny X-Men'' #148</ref> On another occasion, she battles the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]<ref>''Dazzler'' #6-7</ref> and establishes a long standing feud with the then-mentally unstable [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]].<ref>''Dazzler'' #22-23</ref> She also had a romantic affair with [[Warren Worthington III]].<ref>''Dazzler'' # 17-28</ref>
In the course of her inadvertent adventures, she even encounters the planet-devouring [[Galactus]], who initially thinks she is of little notice and generally ignores her. Nevertheless, he temporarily endows her with cosmic energy so she can retrieve his herald [[Terrax]] for him.<ref name="Dazzler #10">''Dazzler'' #10</ref> In addition to being offered membership into the X-Men, Alison is also asked to audition for a place in the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. She declines while facing [[Fabian Stankowicz]] (who is ultimately easily defeated by the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]]), saying that the superhero "trip wasn't for [her]."

After moving to Los Angeles in a vain attempt to help her half-sister [[Lois London]], who has the mutant ability to kill anyone she touches, but has little to no control over her abilities, Alison attempts careers in [[Physical fitness|fitness]] training, [[dance|dancing]], [[model (person)|modeling]], and [[acting]]. Influenced both by her lover, Roman Nekoboh, and her desire to abate the growing anti-mutant sentiment, Alison publicly declares her mutant identity. The revelation backfires, destroying her reputation and career and inflaming anti-mutant sentiment, which sends Alison into a depressive state. Forced again into hiding, she spends some time as a keyboard player in rock singer and fellow mutant [[Lila Cheney]]'s band. While on tour, the band's plane crashes, which leads to Dazzler, Lila, and a bandmate being successfully rescued by [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] and his brother, [[Icarus (comics)|Joshua]]. Lila has been knocked out so Dazzler uses the music Joshua plays at the scene to blast a hole through the wreckage. Alison is later possessed by the psychic mutant [[Malice (comics)|Malice]]. She is saved and taken in by the [[X-Men]], becoming a member of the team.

During her tenure with the X-Men, Dazzler receives training, attains greater control over her powers, and develops a romance with the extra-dimensional [[Longshot]]. She is also forced to work alongside the now-reformed Rogue. This causes considerable tension between them at first, due to Alison's difficulty in getting over Rogue's attempts to kill her in the past, as well as Rogue's own strong feelings for Longshot. Over time she eventually believes Rogue is genuinely remorseful and forgives her. Dazzler struggles with her career ambitions and personal insecurities, and eventually she and her team-mates in the X-Men enter the mystical [[Siege Perilous (comics)|Siege Perilous]], which leaves her in an amnesiac state. Discovered washed up on a beach by her former bodyguard [[Strong Guy]], she is nursed back to health by him and Lila Cheney, though their efforts prove unsuccessful in helping restore her memory. It is eventually restored when she is found by Longshot. Devastated by the loss of her career, Alison ventures to Longshot's native "Mojoworld", and remains there to help fight in the ongoing rebellion against the tyrant [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]] along with Lila Cheney.

Dazzler eventually returns to Earth without Longshot after an unfortunate series of events, including miscarriage and war. She helps Jean Grey in the fight against a repowered [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], who is backed by an army of [[Genosha]]ns. She and Jean lead a small band of mutants to back up the original X-Men, who are in Genosha already. Dazzler faces down Magneto who turns her powers against her and apparently incinerates her. As he arrogantly boasts about his triumph, Dazzler reveals herself to be alive and well. She and Jean had concocted a plan for Alison to generate a hard-light hologram of herself to distract Magneto, who was then gravely wounded by Wolverine. After the conclusion of this incident, the X-Men offer Alison support for her personal problems, but she declines.

The Dazzler later re-establishes her musical career, marketing her trademark disco image as part of the [[Trance music|Techno/Trance]] genre. Alison moved her career abroad to England and joined with X-Men allies such as the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] and [[Captain Britain]].<ref>''New Excalibur'' #1</ref> She was reunited with [[Longshot]] in the ''[[X-Men: Die by the Sword]]'' miniseries, although Longshot was suffering from [[amnesia]] and did not remember her.

In retaliation, Dazzler later accompanies [[Emma Frost]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], and [[Karma (comics)|Karma]] for the revenge-attack on the Sisterhood in San Francisco where she engages a mind controlled [[Psylocke]], who was back in her original body, in battle. While Psylocke gains the upper hand, Dazzler points out that Storm blew out all the windows when they entered. This was so she could absorb all the sound from the city outside, which she turned into a beam of light that burns the right side of Psylocke's face off. After the Sisterhood retreats Dazzler is happily reunited with Psylocke, who regains control of her Japanese body.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #511</ref>

===X-Men: Second Coming===
Dazzler, along with [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]], [[Anole (comics)|Anole]], [[Northstar (comics)|Northstar]], [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]], [[Pixie (comics)|Pixie]] and [[Trance (comics)|Trance]] travel to Limbo to rescue [[Magik (comics)|Magik]]. Things go wrong when the ground starts to tremble and an army of monstrous demons attack the team. Dazzler calls upon Gambit for help during the attack, but Gambit sinks into the darkness, claiming "Remy's not home right now" leading the X-Men to be overwhelmed by the demons.<ref>''X-Men: Hellbound'' #1</ref> Dazzler ends up alone and is rescued by Northstar just as she is about to lose her fight against the demons. Northstar and Dazzler encounter Gambit shortly after, unfortunately he has reverted to his Death persona. He seemingly attacks Northstar who easily evades his cards. As Northstar avoids the attack he realizes the cards were meant for Dazzler and she is transformed into a state much like the Death persona Gambit takes on. Dazzler, infected by Gambit (now completely consumed by the concept of survival of the fittest), joins his ranks goes after the other X-Men in Limbo to infect them as well.<ref>''X-Men: Hellbound'' #2</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Dazzler is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with the ability to transduce sonic vibrations which reach her body into various types of light. This ability seems to operate over a great range of frequencies, including the audible spectrum, and a great variation of sound pressure levels regardless of the complexity, dissonance, or randomness of the sound. Sounds as different as a car crash and a symphonic passage both produce convertible incoming acoustic vibrations.

Dazzler prefers utilizing the sound of music, particularly that which is rhythmically sustained. Not only is music more pleasant to her ears, but the steady beat of contemporary music provides a more constant source of sound to convert. The precise means by which this conversion process works is as yet unknown. Dazzler has been shown to create a "null space" of sound in a certain radius of her person, as a result of "pulling" the sound in her area to her person, to either protect a crowd of people or to supercharge her power reserves.<ref>''Dazzler: The Movie'' Marvel Graphic Novel #12</ref>

Left undirected, Dazzler's light will radiate from her body in all directions, producing regular flashes of white light. By conscious control over the light she produces, she can control its direction, frequency (color), amplitude (intensity), and duration.

Dazzler can produce numerous effects. She can create simple patterns out of rays of light or  combinations of patterns which produce trance-like effects in her targets. She can create a pulse of light on the order of several thousand [[watt]]s of power, which temporarily blinds people with its brilliance. She can create a chaotic cascade of sparkling lights and colors that severely upsets other people's equilibrium, or a pulsating strobe-light effect. Dazzler can generate a coherent beam of light, approximating a laser beam.

Dazzler has polarizing eyes and cannot be blinded or dazzled by light.<ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' vol. 2 #3</ref>

With effort, she can create holograms of human beings and other three-dimensional beings and objects.

She generally directs lasers from a single finger when she requires precision. She most often uses her hands for directing her light effects, but she could also use other parts of her body. Since studying with the X-Men, she has become adept at directing her blinding strobe light blast from her eyes.

The most powerful manifestation of her laser abilities are a concentrated stream of solid photons she usually fires from her index finger but can emit from her entire body. The beam is extremely powerful and as a consequence uses a great deal of her energy reserves. She has also demonstrated the ability to stretch the electromagnetic spectrum to produce devastating microwave energy.<ref>''Dazzler'' #29</ref> She has since learned how to produce these blasts without draining herself, while still providing them with considerable power.{{issue|date=December 2010}}

When Galactus enlisted her to retrieve his wayward herald [[Terrax]] from the heart of a black hole he had her exposed to unimaginable sounds, including the explosion of an entire galaxy, to boost her to sufficient levels.<ref name="Dazzler #10"/>

Since the events of ''Dazzler: The Movie'', Alison's body can store light energy for future discharge on occasional instances of extreme duress. Thanks to [[Professor X]], Dazzler's costume contains devices that enable her to store sonic energy more efficiently and to gauge and focus the light she generates with greater skill. She has also demonstrated on at least one occasion the ability to expel the stored sound into a devastating wave of sonic energy that destroyed her foe Dust.<ref>''Dazzler'' #42</ref>

Dazzler is immune to the injurious effects of her light transducing abilities. Her ability to transduce sound also protects her from being deafened by loud sounds.

Dazzler is a highly skilled athlete, and has become an excellent hand-to-hand combatant thanks to her training with the X-Men, and with the Gladiators.<ref>''Beauty and the Beast'' #3</ref> In addition, she is a talented singer, actress, and dancer. She is also a highly accomplished roller skater and can move at high speed; she occasionally wears a pair of roller blades which magnetically adheres to her boots.

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
{{Main|Age of Apocalypse}}
Dazzler appears as a member of the X-Men. She is a chain smoker, having no use for a singing voice in this timeline. She is also more skilled with her powers, being able to create hard-light constructs, as well as manipulate both light and sound energies. With this new power-set, Dazzler serves as a one-woman training facility, as well as a messenger via holographic transmissions.<ref>Nicieza, Fabian and Andy Kubert. ''Amazing X-Men'' #1-2.</ref>  She was romantically involved with [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]] and did not accompany the main team of X-Men in the final assault on [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]].

Dazzler was one of the characters involved in the original Age of Apocalypse to be brought back for the ''Age of Apocalypse 10th Anniversary'' miniseries. Like many of the other X-Men, Dazzler's costume in the 10th anniversary reflects an updated take on her original costume: the silver jumpsuit. Against the battle with Mr. Sinister's Sinister Six, Dazzler was swallowed within Cloak's dark dimension, but is ultimately saved by a lightning bolt from Storm which forces Cloak to spit her back out.

===The End===
In ''[[X-Men: The End]]'', a series about the X-Men's hypothetical future, Dazzler reverted her costume to reflect her classic, silver design, continuing her career as a singer. Dazzler, an occasional "reserve" team member, joined Storm and X-Men members [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]], [[Psylocke]], and [[Sage (comics)|Sage]] for Xavier's "Plan B" team. Co-piloting the ship to the extraterrestrial [[Shi'ar]] homeworld, Dazzler uses her powers to create a light show, calming the passions of the battling X-Men and [[Shi'ar]] [[Imperial Guard (comics)|Imperial Guard]]. The series' primary villain — [[Cassandra Nova]] — then manifests, slaying the Imperial Guard and leaving the remaining X-Men as her sole adversaries. Dazzler attempts to subdue Cassandra along with Storm and Iceman. While she uses her ability to laser a hole through Cassandra's head, Storm strikes her with lightning, giving Iceman a chance to freeze her. Bishop then shatters her in order to prevent her from returning. However, Cassandra simply reforms, and as a form of retaliation, blasts a hole through Dazzler, strikes Storm with energy, and freezes Iceman. She successfully killed Storm and Dazzler, but Iceman survived the ordeal.. Dazzler is believed to be among the slain X-Men that were invited to a plane of higher existence by the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]].<ref>Claremont, Chris and Sean Chen. ''X-Men: The End: Book 3'' #5-6.</ref>

===House of M===
When Wanda Maximoff, the [[Scarlet Witch]], used her reality-altering powers to change the world, Dazzler became one of the most famous mutants on Earth. After having a successful singing career as a teenager, Dazzler continued her career as the world's primary media personality via her syndicated talk show.<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael and Oliver Coipel. ''House of M'' #2.</ref>

The ''House of M'' newsprint special featured a tabloid-esque [[blind article]], indicating that Alison's signature lightshow was fading due to a rare blood disorder, which was causing her to lose her mutation. [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] used Alison's popular talk show to sound off on her disapproval of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]'s handling of mutant affairs and [[Mister Sinister]] was seen watching the Alison show when [[Deadpool]] went to rescue an infant [[Cable (comics)|Cable]].

Author [[Brian Michael Bendis]] originally scripted for the Dazzler to be this altered reality's answer to [[Oprah Winfrey|Oprah]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

===Marvel Zombies===
Dazzler appears as one of the few uninfected heroes in the limited series ''[[Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness]]''. There, she is almost eaten by an infected [[Bucky#Winter Soldier|Winter Soldier]] until he gets killed by [[Ash Williams]]. Ash is attracted to Dazzler, but she doesn't reciprocate his feelings. As a thanks for saving her, Dazzler agrees to help Ash find the Necronomicon book that might put an end to the zombies. The duo pair up with the [[Scarlet Witch#Marvel Zombies|Scarlet Witch]] to discover that the Necronomicon is being kept at Doctor Doom's fortress in Latveria. Ash discovers the Necronomicon, but unfortunately it has nothing to do with this world's infection. On his way back, he meets an imprisoned [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)#Marvel Zombies|Enchantress]]. Because of the nature of her powers, Ash believes the Enchantress is unaffected. In a confrontation with Dazzler, the Enchantress bites off her finger, infecting her with the zombification virus. Before she can react, [[Alternative versions of Doctor Doom#Marvel Zombies|Doctor Doom]] appears and destroys both women.

This series is the first since Dazzler's 1980 solo series to feature the character primarily as a Marvel Comics hero, with greater links to superheroes such as the Avengers and Fantastic Four, rather than as an X-Men member{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}.

Another zombified Dazzler is quite visible in the bottom left corner of the large center cell on page 13 of Issue #23 of [[Ultimate Fantastic Four]] &ndash; part 3 of the three-part arc that introduced the "Marvel Zombies" Universe [the three part arc consisted of ''Ultimate Fantastic Four'' issues 21-23]. As noted, Dazzler was destroyed - disintegrated - by [[Doctor Doom]] in the "Marvel Zombies Vs. Army of Darkness" limited series and hence, never lived to become a zombie.

===Ultimate Dazzler===

The [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate]] incarnation of Dazzler (Alison Blaire) is introduced as a punk rock singer in ''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'' #42. Alison briefly joins [[Emma Frost#Ultimate Emma Frost|Emma Frost]]'s [[New Mutants#Alternate versions|Academy of Tomorrow]] when promised a record deal, but joins the [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Men]] after they rescue her from a [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] attack. There she is called "Dazzler", the name of her band.

Alison often shows a lack of enthusiasm for the X-Men or their missions, but after learning of a proposed public execution of a mutant, she convinces a group of teammates to go on a rescue mission. When the mission goes astray and [[Warren Worthington III#Ultimate Angel|Angel]] is captured, Dazzler takes initiative and leads the team on a rescue mission. This leads to the accidental release of [[Longshot#Ultimate Longshot|Longshot]].{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

Later, she and Angel go out on a presumed 'date' (really an effort to get themselves involved with the X-Men's latest mission) preventing the ''Academy of Tomorrow'' students from attacking the [[Ultimates#Headquarters|Triskelion]]. During the incident, power is lost and one of the inmates, [[Lady Deathstrike#Ultimate Lady Deathstrike|Deathstrike]], impales Dazzler through the chest. Ironically, Deathstrike is defeated by the very killer Dazzler has assisted before.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #65</ref>

Dazzler stays in a coma for several weeks, visited many times by [[Alternative versions of Nightcrawler#Ultimate Marvel|Nightcrawler]] who has an unrequited crush on her. Unfortunately, many factors have combined to unhinge Nightcrawler and as soon as she is able to be moved, he fools her into thinking they must escape. Initially trusting him, she cooperates until the rest of the X-Men rescue her.<ref name="Ultimate X-Men Annual #2">''Ultimate X-Men Annual'' #2</ref>

The others, understanding Nightcrawler is mentally ill, plan to rehabilitate him. Dazzler does not accept this and quits the team in protest.<ref name="Ultimate X-Men Annual #2"/> She has since been labeled as one of the "most important" mutants to the X-Men's cause by the future [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]].<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #82</ref>

Dazzler later joins Bishop's new team in Ultimate X-Men #82. Bishop dies in Ultimate X-Men #90, and since then Dazzler has returned to the Xavier Institute to be with Angel and on Xavier's X-Men team once again. She is seen to be on [[Alternative versions of Colossus#Ultimate Colossus|Colossus]]' enhanced team, using the drug [[Banshee (comics)#Ultimate Banshee|Banshee]] to boost her powers, seemingly with the ability to generate solid light spider legs and constructs and later faces off against Wolverine with hard-light versions of his claws. The drug enhanced team battles Xavier's main X-Men and eventually leave their drug-filled lives and return to the X-Mansion.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #97</ref>

The Ultimatum Wave{{Clarify|date=December 2010}} hits the X-Men next and Dazzler is revealed by Jean Grey to have been killed by it along with fellow team mates Beast and Nightcrawler.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #98</ref>

Dazzler's powers allow her to convert sonic vibrations into various forms of [[Photovoltaics|photovoltaic]] energy, including blinding flashes and concussive photon pulses; when boosted by the drug Banshee she was able to create hard light [[holography|holographic]] constructs. Her photon pulses have been shown as strong enough to destroy several Sentinels at once.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

===Interlocking Technologies===
A woman from Earth-721, was given the powers and appearance of Dazzler by Interlocking Technologies. She came to Earth-616 and impersonated the original Alison. She toured the Western States of the USA in Dazzler's original costume. However, she was ultimately discovered, stripped of her powers and returned to Earth-721.<ref>''She-Hulk'' vol. 2 #21</ref>

===X-Babies===

===Earth X===

===What If?===
In a two part [[What If (comics)|What If?]] story (What if Cable had destroyed the X-Men? and What if Magneto took over the U.S.A.?) based on ''Uncanny X-Men'' #269, Dazzler is an agent of Magneto.<ref>''What If...?'' vol. 2 #46</ref>  She is ultimately killed by a Sentinel warhead.<ref>''What If...?'' vol. 2 #47</ref>  In ''What If'' (1st series) #33 (June 1982), Dazzler decides to stay Galactus’ [[herald of Galactus|herald]] after she defeats Terrax.
