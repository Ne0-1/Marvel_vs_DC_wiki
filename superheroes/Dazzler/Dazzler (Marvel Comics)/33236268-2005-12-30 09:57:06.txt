'''Dazzler''' is a [[comic book]] [[superhero]] from the [[Marvel Comics]] [[universe]].  She first appeared in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #130, in February of 1980.  ''Dazzler'' also refers to the Marvel Comics series launched in 1981 starring the character of the same name.  For information on the series, please visit [[Dazzler (series)|Dazzler (series)]].

Originally, Dazzler was a commissioned project from record company [[Casablanca Records]] in the late 70s. She was originally called "The Disco Queen" with the powers to make people tell the truth. The character was fleshed out by a committee of editors at Marvel Comics, and Casablanca kept making conceptual changes to the character.  Eventually, Casablanca dropped out of the project before her first issue was released and Marvel took ownership and creative control.

Though originally commissioned as a [[disco]] singer, the Dazzler was shifted to other musical genres including [[rock_and_roll|rock]], [[country_music|country]] and [[adult_contemporary|adult contemporary]] once Marvel Comics assumed creative control.

==Character History==
[[Image:Uncanny130.jpg|Dazzler's first appearance. Art by John Byrne (1980).|150px|thumb|left]]
Alison was born in Gardendale, [[New York]] to Carter and Katherine Blaire on an unspecified date. Her mutant powers first manifested when she was in [[high school]]. An aspiring singer, she volunteered to perform at her school dance when her [[light]]-generating abilities first appeared. Everyone at the dance assumed it was a techno-based [[special effect]] and this assumption would continue until she was revealed as a mutant.

Using the [[stage name]] “Dazzler,” Alison set out to make a name for herself in the [[music]] [[industry]], while using her light powers and dancing ability to enhance her performances.  It was at one of these shows that Alison met the [[X-Men]].  Few but those closest to her knew she was actually a mutant.  After acquainting herself with the various [[Marvel Comics]] [[superheroes]], Alison found herself continually using her abilities to fight ordinary criminals and rogue superhumans –- often at the expense of her career ambitions.  In addition to being offered membership into the X-Men, Alison was also asked to join the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] twice -- all of which she declined.  

After moving to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] from [[New York City]], Alison attempted careers in fitness training, modeling and acting.  Influenced both by her lover, Roman Nekoboh and her desire to abate the growing anti-mutant sentiment, Alison publicly declared her mutant identity.  This revelation backfired, destroying her reputation and career, inflaming anti-mutant sentiment and sent Alison into a depressive state.  Forced again into hiding, Alison was possessed by the psychic mutant [[Malice (comics)|Malice]] and was later saved and taken-in by the [[X-Men]].

During her tenure with the X-Men, Alison received greater training and control over her powers and developed a romance with the extra-dimensional humanoid creature [[Longshot]].  She was also forced to work alongside [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], with whom she had a longstanding grudge.  Dazzler often struggled with her career ambitions and personal insecurities, whilst trying to uphold the superhero facade.  Eventually Dazzler along with teammates Rogue, Psylocke, Colossus and Havok, entered the mystical Seige Perilous leaving her in an amnesiac state.  Discovered by Longshot and devastated by her long-lost career, Alison ventured to his native "Mojoworld" and remained to help fight in the ongoing rebellion against the tyrant [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]].  Dazzler eventually returned to Earth without Longshot after an unfortunate series of events, including [[miscarriage]] and war.  The X-Men offered Alison support but she declined.

The Dazzler later re-established her musical career, marketing her trademark "disco" image in the [[Trance_music|Techno/Trance]] genre.  Alison has since moved her career abroad to England and recently has joined with X-Men allies such as the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] and [[Captain Britain]].

==Powers and Abilities==
Dazzler is a [[mutant]] who possesses the ability to convert sound into light.  Her powers encompass the entire light spectrum.  While the Dazzler can absorb all forms of external sound, she prefers to use music with its rhythmic patterns.   These light projections are very versatile ranging from the typical lightshow, to catatonic [[strobe light|strobe]] flashes, to pin-point laser beams, to protective force fields.  Her potential to convert sound into light is infinite with the one restriction being that she cannot, for unknown reasons, use her own voice to create light.

Her body, especially her eyes, protects itself against any injury that would be caused by either external or self-generated light sources.  Loud noises also have no effect due to her ability to absorb them.  Since the events of ''Dazzler: The Movie'', Alison’s body can store light energy for future discharge.  However, the Dazzler gradually loses this stored energy, which results in a total loss of power.  Dazzler is also capable of redirecting absorbed or stored sound energy back as pure concussive force.

==''Dazzler'' Series==
[[Image:dazzler-issue1.jpg|frame|Cover of ''Dazzler'' #1, by Bob Larkin.<br><br>The artwork is indicative of the delays plaguing ''Dazzler'' -- Bob Larkin completed the piece in 1979 although ''Dazzler'' #1 wasn't published until March of 1981.|150px|thumb|right]]
Marvel Comics published ''Dazzler'' in March of 1981.  The series lasted for five years ending with issue 42 in March of 1986.  For an in-depth overview of ''Dazzler,'' please visit [[Dazzler (series)|Dazzler (series)]].

''Dazzler'' #1 was the first comic sold exclusively to comic shops, pre-selling 400,000 copies – about double the number sold for a Marvel comic at that time.  The issue was eventually re-printed for the broader-market, as readers had difficulty finding copies of the first issue.  Also, it is important to mention that Dazzler was the first [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] superhero of the X-Men variety to receive an ongoing series.  X-Men powerhouse [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] received an ongoing series in 1988, three years after the end of ''Dazzler''.  

Although Dazzler was introduced in ''Uncanny X-Men'' and was a [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] [[superhero]], the ''Dazzler'' series spotlighted several of Marvel’s non-mutant superheroes and villains.  Guest-starring characters included [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)]], the [[Fantastic Four]], the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and [[Galactus]].  Because of the title’s emphasis on many Marvel Universe characters and concepts, Dazzler was regarded as more of a "Marvel Comics Superhero," rather than an "X-Men Character" as she is today.

Eventually, ''Dazzler'' failed to adequately create its own cast and began to lose commercial appeal.  With issue #25, ''Dazzler'' became a bi-monthly publication.  This schedule along with extreme character changes and a lackluster spin-off miniseries, further complicated the character and series’ appeal to both existing and new readers.

''Dazzler'' ditched its singer-subtext and was re-conceived as a superhero book with issue #38.  Unfortunately, the series did not recover and was cancelled with issue #42, headlining "Because You Demanded It – The '''Last''' Issue of the ''Dazzler''!"

==Dazzler’s Aliases==
Several recent ''Marvel Handbooks'' and on-line character biographies list Dazzler as having several nicknames and aliases.  As Dazzler went into hiding several times between ''Dazzler''  #27 until joining the X-Men, she would occasionally drop a false name to an unsuspecting human to avoid detection.  None of these aliases were permanent; in fact Alison was almost exclusively referred to as "Dazzler," "Alison," "Ali" or "Dazz."  Even "The Disco Dazzler," was only a name marketed by Marvel Comics and used once or twice in-text or for solicitation purposes.

==Ultimate Dazzler==
[[Image:UltimateDazzler.jpg|frame|Dazzler from ''Ultimate X-Men'' #42.  Art by David Finch.]]
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] timeline, writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] re-imagined Alison Blaire as a [[punk rock]] singer, first appearing in ''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'' #42 in February of 2004. Additionally, the "Dazzler" label referred to the character's band and not as an alias for the character herself.  In this incarnation, the Dazzler is fashioned in the [[punk_fashion | punk]] style -- a stark contrast to her feel-good, high-fashion incarnations.  This design also bears a striking resemblance to [[Brody Dalle]] of [[Punk rock | punk rock]] band [[The Distillers]].

In keeping with her iconoclastic appearance, Dazzler has openly defied the orders of Professor Xavier on more than one occasion, leading to her suspension from the group's official missions. Later on, she developed an intimate relationship with her teammate Warren Worthington III -- the [[Angel (comics)|Angel]].  In the conclusion to 'Magnetic North', Dazzler was stabbed by [[Lady Deathstrike]] and remains in a coma.
