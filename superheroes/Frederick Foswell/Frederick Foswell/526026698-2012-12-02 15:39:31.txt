'''Frederick Foswell''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]].

==Publication history==

==Fictional character biography==
Frederick Foswell was born in [[Queens, New York]]. He was one of [[Spider-Man]]'s first opponents. He worked at the Daily Bugle for evidently quite a number of years, though the sliding timescale puts some of the hints of this into question: in the Night Raven story in Marvel Super-Heroes (UK)#394 (February 1983), Foswell is referred to as a friend of Scoop Daly and as having attended Scoop Daly's funeral. A man named Fredrick was shown working for the Bugle in Sgt. Fury#110. 

A reporter for the [[Daily Bugle]], Foswell led a double life behind a mask as '''The Big Man''', head of New York's crime and the boss of the notorious [[Enforcers (comics)|Enforcers]]. Although he did not possess any actual superpowers, he was a slippery opponent. However, following a confrontation with Spider-Man, his identity was exposed and the police brought him in (Although Spider-Man had initially assumed that the Big Man was [[J. Jonah Jameson]] due to Foswell using padding to make himself appear larger as the Big Man). 

After Foswell was released from prison, Jameson rehired him, an act of trust which immediately earned Foswell's gratitude.  When another masked crime lord called the Crime-Master arose, working in collusion with the [[Green Goblin]], Spider-Man suspected Foswell, but it turned out to be someone else. However, Foswell had indeed been wearing a mask - a patch-eyed face that he used as an alter ego, Patch. Acting as a stool-pigeon, he tipped off the police to planned crimes while getting scoops.

At one point, Foswell actually discovered Spider-Man's secret identity, but Spider-Man was warned by his spider-sense and managed to trick Foswell into believing that he wasn't Peter Parker, faking a conversation between his two identities and then rapidly creating a 'dummy' by filling his costume with webbing and sending it swinging away while Foswell was watching. Parker and Foswell occasionally worked together, with Peter tipping off Foswell as Spider-Man before a major bust and then taking pictures to go with Foswell's stories.

When Spider-Man gave up the costume in ''Amazing Spider-Man #50'', the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] entered and took over New York's underworld.  Foswell, believing that he could take over from the Kingpin, returned to crime, but the Kingpin outwitted him, instead forcibly enlisting him as a lieutenant. When the Kingpin kidnapped Jameson because of his editorials on the new crime wave, Spider-Man returned and tried to rescue him, but was beaten by the Kingpin. The Kingpin tried to kill both Jameson and Spider-Man by drowning them, but Spider-Man used his webbing to create an air bubble that kept them both alive.

The attempted murder of Jameson turned Foswell against the Kingpin, who, sensing this, tried to kill him. However, Spider-Man entered and stopped him just in time. While the Kingpin and Spider-Man battled, Foswell ran into the basement of the Kingpin's building to try to help Jameson. When he found Jameson, Foswell protected him from the thugs trying to kill him, and took a bullet meant for Jameson. The Kingpin escaped, and Foswell died a hero, having repaid his debt to Jameson. For this, Jameson memorialized him as a hero in the ''Daily Bugle''.

The daughter of the original Big Man, Janice Foswell sought to follow in the footsteps of her father and gain control of the New York underworld. She was soon joined by a new [[Crime-Master]] and [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]]. She and her Enforcers were defeated by [[Spider-Man]], the [[Human Torch]] and the [[Sons of the Tiger]]. Over a dispute about eliminating Spider-Man and the Sons, Janice was killed by the [[Crime Master]], who turned out to be her fiancé and son of the original Crime-Master, Nick Lewis Jr; both had separately pursued vengeance against Spider-Man without knowledge of each other's identity.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate===
In the alternate, [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, Foswell (aka Mr. Big) was introduced as a mobster and the head of Wilson Fisk's Enforcers. <ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #9</ref> Foswell was scheming to overthrow Fisk, using Spider-Man as his secret weapon.  The plan backfired and when Fisk learned that Foswell was the one responsible for Spidey's assault on his office, he crushed the mobster's head with his bare hands. <ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #10</ref>

Another Frederick Foswell also exists in the Ultimate universe. His name is seen on a byline in [[The Daily Bugle]] in a published story on the death of Spider-Man and revealing his identity as Peter Parker. <ref>''Ultimate Comics: Fallout'' #1</ref>

===MC2===
In the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] universe, '''[[Henry Pym]] Jr.''', inheriting his father's size changing powers, takes the name Big Man. He is briefly a member of the [[Revengers]], before going straight and joining a government-sponsored team. <ref>''A-Next'' #12</ref>

===DC===
In [[Superman]] (vol 2) #51, Sam Foswell makes his first appearance in a storyline where he becomes temporary manager of [[The Daily Planet]] as Perry White takes a leave of absence.  This Foswell has an appearance identical to Frederick Foswell, and they are both newspaper men.  If not exactly the same character, he is at the least an elaborate homage.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Frederick Foswell appears in the ''[[Spider-Man (1967 TV series)|1967 TV series]]'' episode "King Pinned". Peter Parker learns that Foswell - one of the Bugle's top-rated reports - is actually an employee of the Kingpin. Foswell informs Kingpin that  J. Jonah Jameson is aware of their involvement in the pharmaceutical racket. He confirms that a bomb is set to explode when the presses start rolling tonight. Peter realizes that [[Aunt May]] is a victim of this scam and decides to help expose it.

* Frederick Foswell is a minor character in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' voiced by [[James Arnold Taylor]]. During several scenes at the ''Daily Bugle,'' [[J. Jonah Jameson]] mentions Foswell. This series version of Foswell even appears briefly in ''Market Forces'', with blonde hair, a mustache, and a green business suit. Later ''The Invisible Hand'', shows Foswell working as a Bugle employee. Twelve years ago, he won a Pulitzer for writing an expose on the criminal activities of [[Silvermane]], and put him behind bars. At the office, he is asked about the Big Man by [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]]. The only other related name Parker learned was "Lincoln," and Foswell cites rumors that "[[Tombstone (comics)|L. Thompson Lincoln]]" was the Big Man, though Foswell admits that his investigation has led him to believe that Lincoln is not the Big Man. Foswell's "Patch" persona appears in the episode "Reinforcement". Spider-Man asks him about the Master Planner. He later uses it again in "Accomplices" to obtain information about an auction between the factions of the Big Man, [[Dr. Octopus]], Silvermane, and [[Roderick Kingsley]]. He bugs Donald Menken (the auctioneer), and combined with Peter's photos of the event, they convince Jonah to run a story about the gang war. Foswell is later undercover as Patch in "Gangland" during the [[Valentine's Day]] Summit, and writes an article exposing [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]] as the Big Man.

===Video games===
* Frederick's daughter Janice is mentioned by a henchmen in ''[[Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions]]''. She is mentioned to be [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]]'s girlfriend. When [[Fancy Dan]] was flirting with her, Hammerhead had [[Crime Master]] kill him and put him in a garbage can. [[Snake Marston (comics)|Snake Marston]] has also attempted to seduce her.
