==Fictional character biography==
Frederick Foswell was born in [[Queens, New York]]. He was one of [[Spider-Man]]'s first opponents. He worked at the Daily Bugle for evidently quite a number of years, though the sliding timescale puts some of the hints of this into question: in the Night Raven story in Marvel Super-Heroes (UK)#394 (February 1983), Foswell is referred to as a friend of Scoop Daly and as having attended Scoop Daly's funeral. A man named Fredrick was shown working for the Bugle in Sgt. Fury#110. 

A reporter for the [[Daily Bugle]], Foswell led a double life behind a mask as '''The Big Man''', head of New York's crime and the boss of the notorious [[Enforcers (comics)|Enforcers]]. Although he did not possess any actual superpowers, he was a slippery opponent. However, Spider-Man eventually revealed his identity and brought him in.

After Foswell was released from prison, [[J. Jonah Jameson]] rehired him, an act of trust which immediately earned Foswell's gratitude.  When another masked crime lord called the Crime-Master arose, working in collusion with the [[Green Goblin]], Spider-Man suspected Foswell, but it turned out to be someone else. However, Foswell had indeed been wearing a mask - a patch-eyed face that he used as an alter ego, Patch. Acting as a stool-pigeon, he tipped off the police to planned crimes while getting scoops.

At one point, Foswell actually discovered Spider-Man's secret identity, but Spider-Man was warned by his spider-sense and managed to trick Foswell into believing that he wasn't Peter Parker. Parker and Foswell occasionally worked together, with Peter tipping off Foswell as Spider-Man before a major bust and then taking pictures to go with Foswell's stories.

When Spider-Man gave up the costume in ''Amazing Spider-Man #50'', the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] entered and took over New York's underworld.  Foswell, believing that he could take over from the Kingpin, returned to crime, but the Kingpin outwitted him, instead enlisting him as a lieutenant. When the Kingpin kidnapped Jameson because of his editorials on the new crime wave, Spider-Man returned and tried to rescue him, but was beaten by the Kingpin. The Kingpin tried to kill both Jameson and Spider-Man by drowning them, but Spider-Man created an air bubble that kept them both alive.

The attempted murder of Jameson turned Foswell against the Kingpin, who, sensing this, tried to kill him. However, Spider-Man entered and stopped him just in time. Foswell ran into the basement of the Kingpin's building to try and help Jameson. When he found Jameson, Foswell protected him from the thugs trying to kill him, and took a bullet meant for Jameson. The Kingpin escaped, and Foswell died a hero, having repaid his debt to Jameson. For this, Jameson memoralized him as a hero in the ''Daily Bugle''.

The daughter of the original Big Man, Janice Foswell sought to follow in the footsteps of her father and gain control of the New York underworld. She was soon joined by a new [[Crime-Master]] and [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]]. She and her Enforcers were defeated by [[Spider-Man]], the [[Human Torch]] and the [[Sons of the Tiger]]. Over a dispute about eliminating Spider-Man and the Sons, Janice was killed by the [[Crime-Master]], who turned out to be her fianc√© and son of the original Crime-Master, Nick Lewis Jr; both had separately pursued vengeance against Spider-Man without knowledge of each other's identity.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate===
In the alternate, [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, Foswell (aka Mr. Big) was introduced as a mobster and the head of Wilson Fisk's Enforcers.  Foswell was scheming to overthrow Fisk, using Spider-Man as his secret weapon.  The plan backfired and when Fisk learned that Foswell was the one responsible for Spidey's assault on his office, he crushed the mobster's head with his bare hands.

===MC2===
In the [[MC2]] universe, [[Henry Pym]] jr., inheriting his father's size changing powers, takes the name Big Man. He is briefly a member of the [[Revengers]], before going straight and joining a government-sponsored team.

== In other media ==
Frederick Foswell is a minor character in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' voiced by [[James Arnold Taylor]]. During several scenes at the ''Daily Bugle,'' [[J. Jonah Jameson]] mentions Foswell. This series version of Foswell even appears briefly in ''Market Forces'', with blonde hair, a mustache, and a green business suit. Later "The Invisible Hand", shows Foswell working as a Bugle employee. At the office, he is asked about the Big Man by [[Peter Benjamin Parker|Peter Parker]]. The only other related name Parker learned was "Lincoln," and Foswell cites rumors that "[[Tombstone (comics)|L. Thompson Lincoln]]" was the Big Man, though Foswell admits that his investigation has led him to believe that Lincoln is not the Big Man.
