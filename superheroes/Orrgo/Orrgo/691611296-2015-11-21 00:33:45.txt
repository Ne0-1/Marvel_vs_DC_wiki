==Fictional character biography==
Orrgo is a 25-30 ft. [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]] "space god", who arrived on Earth and has tried to conquer it many times in the past. He arrived on Earth to display his superior powers over the humans. With his abilities, Orrgo took over the world quickly. With the human race under his mental domination, Orrgo went back to the circus where it first arrived and went to sleep. A circus gorilla named Jojo realized that it was the reason that it was not being fed. Jojo escaped from its cage and killed Orrgo. The human race was then freed from Orrgo's control as the rest of Orrgo's kind left thinking that the humans have defeated Orrgo.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #90</ref>

The [[Headmen]] later stole the God from Beyond from the museum and used it to summon Orrgo.<ref>''Defenders'' Vol. 2 #5</ref>

The [[Headmen]] and [[MODOK]] summoned Orrgo using the God from Beyond statue. [[Patsy Walker|Hellcat]], [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Nighthawk]], and [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]] of the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] fought Orrgo only to be defeated by him. Orrgo then went on to attack the city. After making volcanoes erupt, cities levitate, and populated areas burst into flames, Orrgo took control of the minds of Earth's population. The Headmen, MODOK, and the Defenders were not affected because they came in contact with the God from Beyond.<ref>''Defenders'' Vol. 2 #9</ref> When the Defenders attacked the Headmen's base, they ordered Orrgo to summon a supervillain army to fight them. While [[Doctor Strange]], [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], [[Namor]], and [[Silver Surfer]] were busy fighting the villains, Hellcat, Nighthawk, and Valkyrie enter the base of the Headmen as Nighthawk seized the God from Beyond. With the God from Beyond in their possession, the Defenders ordered Orrgo to undo the damage that it caused. With the damage undone and the supervillains teleported back to where they came from, Doctor Strange stated that they could banish all evil from Earth. Hellcat broke the God from Beyond stating that it would be a violation of the free will to do such a thing. Upon being freed, Orrgo thought for itself again and threatened to devastate the planet. Hellcat reminded Orrgo that his race has always been defeated by the humans and asked if he really wanted to fight them. Orrgo decides to leave Earth and return when the humans are extinct.<ref>''Defenders'' Vol. 2 #10</ref>

Through unknown means, Orrgo was captured by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and placed in the [[Nick Fury's Howling Commandos|Howling Commandos]] Monster Force.<ref>''Nick Fury's Howling Commandos'' #6</ref>
