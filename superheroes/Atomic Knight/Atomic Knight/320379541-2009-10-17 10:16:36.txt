'''Atomic Knight''' is a [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]] and was briefly a member of the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]] team.

==Original Atomic Knights==
[[Image:Strangeadventures144-175.jpg|right|thumb|150px|The only Atomic Knights cover appearance in Strange Adventures #144. Note the giant Dalmatians.]]
The Atomic Knights appeared off and on in issues of ''[[Strange Adventures]]'' in the early 1960s, beginning with #117 (June 1960). Created by [[John Broome (writer)|John Broome]] and [[Murphy Anderson]], they were a band of heroes living in the post-apocalyptic future of 1992.
 
Following the catastrophic Hydrogen War of 1986, a petty tyrant named the Black Baron ruled a small section of the Midwest with an iron fist. He was opposed by Sgt. Gardner Grayle and the Atomic Knights, who wore medieval suits of armor that were impervious to the Baron's energy weapons, having been irradiated in the war. The other Knights were twins Wayne and Hollis Hobard, Bryndon Smith, the last scientist left on Earth, and brother and sister Douglas and Marene Herald.

The fifteen Atomic Knights stories in ''[[Strange Adventures]]'' generally dealt with post-holocaust recovery, as the Knights would fend off menaces and attempt to rebuild the area around their homebase of Durvale, though they also managed to travel to Los Angeles, Detroit, New Orleans, New York, and Washington, D.C. In all, there were fifteen early-1960s Atomic Knights stories; their last appearance in ''Strange Adventures'' came in issue #160 (January 1964).

The Atomic Knights concept then lay dormant for several years, until [[Cary Bates]] used the Knights as guest-stars in the mid-70s series ''[[Hercules (DC Comics)|Hercules Unbound]]'', beginning with #10 (April-May 1977). Hercules, [[Kamandi]] and the Atomic Knights all inhabited the same universe, one in which the [[Great Disaster]] had taken place (references to 1986 became less and less frequent as that date actually approached). The entire Great Disaster concept has since been declared to be out of continuity in the current DC Universe. The Atomic Knights themselves were revealed to be the dream of Gardner Grayle in ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' #57, where Superman attempts to prevent Grayle from causing a nuclear war.

The original Atomic Knights stories were reprinted in ''Strange Adventures'' #217-231. Their appearances in ''Hercules Unbound'' and ''DC Comics Presents'' have not been reprinted.

===Early character history===
On Earth-One, '''Gardner Grayle''' was a [[sergeant]] in the army. His platoon was the infamous Platoon 13 and its symbol was a knight. Feverishly opposed to nuclear war, Grayle volunteered for a virtual reality experiment to see how people would react to a post atomic war world. Within this experiment, Grayle believed that the adventures of the Atomic Knights were only a dream. After emerging from the experiment, Grayle donned a [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] battle suit and declared himself a modern knight in shining armor, briefly becoming the second [[Shining Knight]] and serving with the [[Seven Soldiers of Victory]].<ref name="dc-ency"/>

After a mildly successful career as a superhero, Grayle took a job at S.T.A.R. When he received a premonition from the goddess Cassandra, Grayle proceeded to use his new technical know-how to build his atomic armor. He then participated in the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' as one of the [[Forgotten Heroes]] who contacted [[Darkseid]] to enlist his help against the [[Anti-Monitor]].

Afterward, he appeared in the ''[[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]'' (vol. 1), a team he joined up until its disbanding. The Outsiders would later reform (in vol. 2), but were considered fugitives after being framed for the slaughter of a Markovian village (home country to Outsider [[Geo-Force]]). At first he hunted the team down but was ultimately convinced of their innocence and was able to clear their name to the rest of the world. He also helps the Outsiders battle a vampiric infestation of the underground nation of Abyssia. With the Outsiders, he also fell in love with fellow Outsider [[Windfall (comics)|Windfall]] and they were seen together at Geo-Force's wedding. 

Beyond just his Atomic Knight armor, Gardner also had the power to see the future.

==="One Year Later"===

In the post-''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' mini-series ''The Battle for Blüdhaven'', Gardner Grayle is the leader of an underground band of new Atomic Knights operating within the destroyed city of [[Blüdhaven]], working with an organization named the Roundtable towards helping citizens harassed by the organization known as [[Father Time (DC Comics)|S.H.A.D.E.]] and the new Black Baron (a former pimp and drug dealer who gains metahuman powers after the Blüdhaven destruction and is later defeated by the [[golem]] known as [[Monolith (comics)|Monolith]]). There are roughly 125 Atomic Knights, with the main Knights being Grayle, Marene and Doug Herald, Bryndon, and Wayne and Hollis Hobard (based on the original group from the 1960s), who are shown posing as refugees with the help of advanced cloaking technology, and using armor with numerous powers including the ability to record and analyze complex data and fire powerful ballistic and nuclear blasts. At the end of the series, [[Captain Atom]] obliterates the remains of Blüdhaven, making way for the departure of S.H.A.D.E. operatives. After this, the Knights are seen entering an underground lush environment through a bunker named '''Command-D''', reminiscent of their access to the post-nuclear world of their original incarnation. Command-D is the bunker that Kamandi and his grandfather the original [[OMAC]] lived.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

===Final Crisis===
In the second issue of ''[[Final Crisis]]'', Dan Turpin travels to Blüdhaven, and briefly sees the Atomic Knights, riding atop giant dogs in the ruined city. Afterwards, he visits the Command-D bunker.

In the third issue, the Knights accompany [[Wonder Woman]] into the city, where they go up against an evil [[Mary Marvel]], who chops Marene Herald in half.

==Other versions==
In the out-of-continuity maxi-series ''[[Justice (DC Comics)|Justice]]'', the [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]] wears a suit of armor that resembles the Earth-One Atomic Knight.

In ''[[52 (comic book)|52]]'', the existence of a new Multiverse is revealed. These Earths are originally carbon copies of the New Earth created at the end of ''Infinite Crisis''.

===Earth-17===
One of the Earths, designated Earth-17 by Rip Hunter, is heavily altered by [[Mister Mind]], and his effects on the Earth have turned it into the home of an alternate version of the Atomic Knights, a version very similar in appearance to the original Atomic Knights and their stories.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Based on comments by [[Grant Morrison]], this alternate universe is not the original setting of the 1960s stories.<ref>{{cite web
