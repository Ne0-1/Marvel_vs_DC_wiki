==Character biography==

=== Doug Taggert ===
The original Grasshopper was '''Doug Taggert''', an employee of the [[Roxxon]] corporation. Taggert used a robotic armor suit to protect the company, as well as doing freelance superhero work. In his civilian life he developed a crush on Cindy Shelton, the head of a research and development team within Roxxon. Cindy, however, was infatuated with the Grasshopper, creating a bizarre love triangle.

He later joined the [[Great Lakes Avengers]], a division of the regular [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], when [[Flatman]] and the Doorman on their trip recuiting trip to New York City. Unfortunately, 5.8 seconds after teaming up with the GLA, he was impaled through the head by a [[sai]] thrown by supervillain [[Zaran]] and died as a result.

===Neil Shelton===
The second Grasshopper was '''Neil Shelton''', a security guard for Roxxon who gained use of the Grasshopper suit in the intervening time after Doug Taggert's summer death. While patrolling outside of Roxxon Labs on Christmas day, Shelton defeated Killer Shrike (himself a former employee of Roxxon) during his attempt to steal "Project Z".

Dr. Cindy Shelton recovered the the "Project Z" device. During a conversation between the two, Neil reveals in a thought bubble that he is actually Cindy's long lost brother and then refuses a dinner invitation from her. This revealation makes the previous Grasshopper/Cindy Shelton love triange even more bizarre.

Neil then initiates a "Maximum Jump", which is later revealed to have propeled him into space, killing him. Later, his body re-enters the Earth's atmosphere and becomes a [[meteor|shooting star]].

== Powers and abilities==
Both interations of the Grasshopper use a [[powered armor]] similar to that of [[Iron Man]]. The suit's primary ability is that of a fantastic vertical leap, which is powered by robotic grasshopper legs. Its secondary abilities include Insectroid Sensors, which work as an early warning system, and the suit's Zoom Lenses, which provide long range sight. Voice activated commands can be used to initiate some of the suit's powers. Neil Shelton's armor could do a "Maximum Jump", while it is unknown if Doug Taggert's had the same ability.

== Trivia ==
*The Grasshopper's first appearance in the [[Great Lakes Avengers|GLA]] miniseries was on the first page of the first issue in the out of continuity issue introduction.
*According to an aside narration by teammate Monkey Joe, 5.8 seconds is the record for the shortest membership on a super-team.
*The Grasshopper is a combined homage to [[Iron Man]] and [[Spider-Man]]; borrowing many aspects of each's histories.
*Neither of the Grasshoppers have lived more than one issue, which may end up being a tradition for any future wearers of the mantle.
