'''The Grasshopper''' is the name of two humorous [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]]s. Neither Grasshopper to date has survived past the issue they first appeared in. Both Grasshoppers are clearly a simultaneous [[homage]] to and [[satire]] of stereotypical superheroes and Marvel's tendency towards animal-themed characters.  They are also a lampoon of the tendency of superhero team books to introduce new, hastily developed characters just for the sake of dramatically killing them off within a few issues. The complicated romantic troubles of the first Grasshopper recall at least a dozen other characters with similar [[subplot]]s ([[Spider-Man]], for instance), as does the unlikely family background of the second. 

==Doug Taggert==
'''Grasshopper''' is a [[fictional]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe who first appeared in the pages of the "[[Great Lakes Avengers|GLA: Misassembled]]" miniseries of 2005. The character was created by [[Dan Slott]] and [[Paul Pelletier]]. He was (very) briefly a member of the [[Great Lakes Avengers]].

===Fictional character history===
Although first appearing when he joined in a [[fourth wall]] breaking out-of-continuity prequel presented by [[Squirrel Girl]]<ref>[[Great Lakes Avengers|GLA]] #1</ref>, he did not appear in continuity until the next issue<ref>[[Great Lakes Avengers|GLA]] #2</ref>.

It is revealed that Grasshopper is in fact Doug Taggert, an employee of [[Roxxon]] Oil who pines after fellow Roxxon researcher Cindy Shelton, who in turn only has eyes for the "ever-gregarious Grasshopper" (thus setting up a classic comic-book style [[love triangle]]). Later it is clarified that Grasshopper is "part-time Roxxon security" who does "some super heroing on the side." Though it is never so stated, the implication is that Roxxon designed and built the gear which is the source of Grasshopper's powers. Soon Grasshopper meets up with the GLA as they both try to stop a robbery being committed by [[Batroc the Leaper|Batroc's Brigade]]. During the course of the battle, Grasshopper agrees to join up with the GLA ... and then almost immediately is killed by a [[Sai (weapon)|sai]] thrown by supervillain [[Zaran]] after it passed through fellow teammate [[Doorman (comics)|Doorman]]. As team sidekick Monkey Joe comments off-panel, "five point eight seconds. A new record for shortest membership on ANY team."

Doug Taggert briefly appears, showing up in a [[limbo]]-like afterlife hanging out with other deceased GLA'ers. Though not particularly cheery in demeanor, he didn't seem too upset about his unfortunate fate either.

===Powers and abilities===
The first Grasshopper's powers are derived entirely from a powered suit, metallic green in color and with an appearance reminiscent of his namesake. The suit's primary ability is that of a fantastic vertical leap, powered by long, robotic hindlegs. These legs can also deliver devastating kicks. Its secondary abilities include "Insectroid Sensors", which work as an early warning system, and the suit's Zoom Lenses, which provide long range sight. Voice activated commands can be used to initiate some of the suit's powers. A notable fault of the suit seems to be that, despite its stiff and sturdy appearance, it offers little to no armor protection to the wearer (thus allowing a simple hand-thrown weapon to pierce the head, normally one of the most heavily defended areas on a suit of armor). It is unknown whether Taggart's suit had the "Maximum Jump" ability his successor Neil Shelton (unfortunately) had while using the suit.

The second '''Grasshopper''' is a [[fictional]], corporate [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe who first appeared in the pages of the ''Great Lakes Avengers'' miniseries in 2005.

The Grasshopper first appeared in ''GLX-Mas Special'' #1, a [[Marvel Comics]] title and was created by [[Dan Slott]] and [[Paul Pelletier]].

He is a member of the [[Great Lakes Avengers]] but, like Doug Taggart, was killed in action.  

===Publication history===
The Grasshopper is a combined homage to [[Iron Man]] and [[Spider-Man]]; borrowing many aspects of each's histories.

Like Taggart before him, Shelton didn't live more than one issue, which may end up being a tradition for any future wearers of the mantle.

===History===
'''Neil Shelton''' was a security guard for Roxxon who gained use of the Grasshopper suit some time after Doug Taggert's death. As the second Grasshopper, he used a [[powered armor]] similar to that of [[Iron Man]]. The suit's primary ability is that of a fantastic vertical leap, which is powered by robotic grasshopper legs. Its secondary abilities include Insectroid Sensors, which work as an early warning system, and the suit's Zoom Lenses, which provide long range sight. Voice activated commands can be used to initiate some of the suit's powers. 

While patrolling outside of Roxxon Labs on Christmas day, Shelton defeated [[Killer Shrike]] (himself a former employee of Roxxon) during the villain's attempt to steal "Project Z".

Dr. Cindy Shelton shows up to recover the "Project Z" device and, unaware that this is a new wearer of the suit, invites Grasshopper to dinner. Via thought balloon, Neil states that he is secretly Cindy's long lost brother and must deny her feelings. This revelation makes the previous Grasshopper/Cindy Shelton love triangle even more bizarre. To escape Cindy's amorous advances, Neil initiates a "Maximum Jump", rocketing heroically into the air. However, it is later revealed (when [[Doorman (comics)|Doorman]] in his new role as an angel of death shows up to pick up his spirit) that the jump propelled Grasshopper into space, killing him. His sacrifice was not completely in vain, as Grasshopper's body re-entered the Earth's atmosphere to become a beautiful Christmas [[meteor|shooting star]].

===Significant Issues===
*''GLX-Mas Special'' #1
