'''Sin''' is a fictional comic book character appearing in books published by [[DC Comics]]. She first appeared in ''[[Birds of Prey (comic book)|Birds of Prey]]'' #92 (1999), and was created by [[Gail Simone]].

==Fictional character biography==
Sin was introduced when [[Black Canary]] made a deal with [[Lady Shiva]]. They would switch lives for a year, in which Dinah would train as Lady Shiva had done, while Shiva herself took her position with [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]] and the Birds of Prey. During Dinah's training, she arrived at a village in Asia, which was ruled by a martial arts master known simply as Mother. Dinah was allowed to be trained by the cruel matriarch, though it often came as horrible mental and physical abuse.{{issue|date=November 2011}}

While there, Dinah met a little girl dubbed '''Sin''' (the name may have been created to dehumanize Sin; while training there, Dinah was given the name "Tag", meaning "swine"). Sin was being groomed to become the next Lady Shiva, following the death of the current one. Sin and Dinah developed an immediate bond that bordered on sister and mother/daughter. When Dinah grew tired of Mother and her training, she decided to leave, and take Sin with her.  Mother attempted to stop her, but was no match for Black Canary.{{issue|date=November 2011}}

Returning to [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] with Sin, Dinah introduced Sin to her friends in the Birds of Prey, who all took a shine to the girl. They began to teach her the wonders of the western world and educate her in English and name-calling (she on occasion addressed [[Huntress (Helena Bertinelli)|Helena]] as "Spinster"). Over time however, Dinah slowly began to question her life as member of the Birds of Prey, now that she had a child to care for. After several missions, she decided to leave the team so as to raise Sin fulltime. This would prove difficult however, after Dinah once again joined the [[Justice League]].{{issue|date=November 2011}}

In the ''Black Canary'' miniseries, the [[League of Assassins]] attempts to kidnap Sin, seeing the martial arts prodigy as a messiah that could unite their splintered and then-leaderless group. In an attempt to save Sin from the League, [[Green Arrow]] fakes the child's death. Though the decision pains him, he conceals the truth from Dinah so that her grief will be real and convincing to their enemies. Dinah later learns of her foster daughter's survival.{{issue|date=November 2011}}

Currently, Sin lives in a secluded monastery, being kept safe from the League of Assassins and others who would exploit her intuitive gift for the martial arts. Black Canary makes occasional trips to visit her, still playing the role of mother part time.{{issue|date=November 2011}}
