'''Sin''' is a fictional character in the {{DC Universe}}. She first appeared in ''[[Birds of Prey (comic book)|Birds of Prey]]'' #92, and was created by [[Gail Simone]].

== Fictional character biography ==
Sin was introduced when [[Black Canary]] made a deal with [[Lady Shiva]].  They would switch lives for a year, in which Dinah would train as Lady Shiva had done, while Shiva herself took her position with [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]] and the Birds of Prey.  During Dinah's training, she arrived at a village in Asia, which was ruled by a martial arts master known simply as Mother.  Dinah was allowed to be trained by the cruel matriarch, though it often came as horrible mental and physical abuse.

While there, Dinah met a little girl dubbed '''Sin''' (the name may have been created to dehumanize Sin; while training there, Dinah was given the name "Tag", meaning "swine").  Sin was being groomed to become the next Lady Shiva, following the death of the current one.  Sin and Dinah developed an immediate bond that bordered on sister and mother/daughter.  When Dinah grew tired of Mother and her training, she decided to leave, and take Sin with her.  Mother attempted to stop her, but was no match for Black Canary.

Returning to [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] with Sin, Dinah introduced Sin to her friends in the Birds of Prey, who all took a shine to the girl.  They began to teach her the wonders of the western world and educate her in English and name-calling (she on occasion addressed Helena as "Spinster").  Over time however, Dinah slowly began to question her life as member of the Birds of Prey, now that she had a child to care for.  After several missions, she decided to leave the team so as to raise Sin fulltime.  This might prove difficult however, now that Dinah has joined the JLA again.

Solicitations for Black Canary's upcoming miniseries by [[Tony Bedard]] read "The [[League of Assassins]] tracks Black Canary to [[Star City (comics)|Star City]] in an effort to liberate the child, Sin, they believe to be the DCU's next greatest assassin.  Luckily, Black Canary has other plans for Sin's abilities and future."
