==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=December 2012}}
Sin first appeared in ''Captain America'' (1st series) #290 (Feb 1984), and was created by [[J.M. DeMatteis]] and [[Paul Neary]].

==Fictional character biography==
[[Image:SinAging.png|thumb|left|Sin being aged into adulthood. Art by [[Paul Neary]].]]
Seeking an heir, the Red Skull (Johann Schmidt) fathered a daughter with a washerwoman. After the woman died in childbirth, the Red Skull angrily almost killed the child as it was a girl. But his follower [[Mother Night (comics)|Susan Scarbo]] convinced him not to, telling him she would raise the girl herself as her nanny. The Skull agreed and left the girl now named "Sinthea" with Scarbo to be raised by her and indoctrinated with the Skull's views as she grew up. The Skull returned when Sinthea was a child and put her in a machine that had her acceleratedly aged into adulthood and gave her superhuman powers.<ref>''Captain America'' #298 [[Marvel Comics]], (October 1984)</ref>

As "Mother Superior", Sinthea became the leader of a group called the "[[Sisters of Sin]]", young orphan girls who were accelerated into adulthood and given [[psionics|psionic]] powers by the Skull after being indoctrinated by Sinthea. The Sisters of Sin would have many run-ins with [[Captain America]] (the Red Skull's nemesis) before being de-aged when they entered a chamber designed to reverse the Skull's aging process and they were restored to children (she would later claim she was deaged to the wrong age - but whether this is true, and in which direction, is unclear).{{Issue|date=October 2009}}

Later, [[Mother Night (comics)|Mother Night]] (Susan Scarbo) reformed the Sisters of Sin and became their new leader, while the deaged Sinthea herself took the name "Sister Sin".{{Issue|date=October 2009}}

Sometime later, she was captured by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and taken to their reeducation facility where they reprogrammed her with false memories as a "normal" American girl named "Erica Holstein". After the Red Skull was seemingly assassinated by the [[Bucky|Winter Soldier]] under [[Aleksander Lukin]]'s orders, [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]] (one of the Skull's henchmen) broke into the facility, kidnapped Erica and tortured her to break her reprogramming. After he succeeded, she simply calls herself "Sin" while she entered into a relationship with him and the two went on a killing spree. She later reunited with the Red Skull while her father was living inside the mind of General Lukin.<ref>''Captain America'' #21 Marvel Comics, (October 2006)</ref>

As the first part of the Skull's Master Plan, Sin disguised herself as a nurse after the [[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]] while Crossbones sniped Captain America at the courthouse, even though it meant obeying her father and abandoning Crossbones to his fate. Sin then revealed to [[Sharon Carter]] that Carter was the one who had killed Cap. Now the leader of a new incarnation of the [[Serpent Squad]], Sin breaks Crossbones out of jail. He is later apprehended again, and Sin wounded, in an attempt to break into the Capitol Building. Sin is later sent to assassinate the Democratic and Republican presidential candidates, but is stopped by [[Bucky|the new Captain America]].<ref>''Captain America'' #42, Marvel Comics</ref> In the aftermath of ''[[Captain America: Reborn]]'', after attempting to put her father in Steve Rogers' body, she is injured by the explosion of her father's mechanical body and her face is hideously scarred like her father's, making her the new "[[Red Skull]]".<ref>''Captain America: Reborn'' #6, Marvel Comics</ref> 

She is later visited in prison by Baron Zemo for information about Bucky.<ref>''Captain America'' #606, Marvel Comics</ref> Sometime later, [[Master Man]] sprung Sin from prison, prompting Sin to take her place as the new Red Skull.<ref>''Captain America'' #612, Marvel Comics</ref> She delivers a video to the media recorded three months before the trial of Bucky where he declares that he wasn't brainwashed but was an accomplice and fully aware of his actions.{{issue|date=December 2012}} She along with Master Man are later seen on Ellis Island where she pretends to blow up the ''[[Statue of Liberty]]'' with Falcon and Black Widow in it, unless Bucky is delivered to her.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

==="Fear Itself"===
During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Sin (with the help of Baron Zemo) unearths the Hammer of [[Skadi]] and becomes Skadi in order to free Serpent: God of Fear from his underwater prison. Sin vows to do what her father failed to do in taking over the world.<ref>''Fear Itself: Book of the Skull'' Marvel Comics</ref> She succeeds in her mission in freeing Serpent and then she prepares an army of Nazis to take over the D.C. Capital.<ref>''Fear Itself'' #1 Marvel Comics, (April 2011)</ref> During their battle in Washington, D.C., Skadi mortally wounds the [[Bucky|James "Bucky" Barnes]], the then-current [[Captain America]].<ref>''Fear Itself'' #3 Marvel Comics, (June 2011)</ref> In the final battle, Skadi battles Steve Rogers, who returns to the mantle of Captain America. Thor gives Cap his hammer Mjolnir so that he can make up for the loss of his shield. Thor manages to kill the Serpent and Odin strips the Worthy of the hammers, causing Sin to lose the power of Skadi. This leaves Sin incapacitated.<ref>''Fear Itself'' #7 Marvel Comics, (October 2011)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
As Mother Superior, Sin possessed a range of superhuman powers including [[telepathy]], [[telekinesis]], [[teleportation]] and [[Wiktionary:intangible|intangibility]]. After she was de-aged, she apparently lost these powers completely - unlike the other "Sisters of Sin", whose powers were diminished but not eliminated upon de-aging. The reason for this discrepancy has never been revealed.

Being trained by her father, she is an expert hand to hand combatant and martial artist. She is also highly proficient in firearms and explosives. As the Red Skull's child, Sin also has a high level of intellect.

==In other media==
===Film===
* In the 1990 [[low budget film]] ''[[Captain America (1990 film)|Captain America]]'', Sin is portrayed by actress [[Francesca Neri]]. She is both the Red Skull's daughter and second in command, but they are both Italian instead of German, with her name changed to '''Valentina de Santis''' to reflect this.
