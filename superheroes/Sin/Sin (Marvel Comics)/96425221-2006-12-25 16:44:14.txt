''Sin is also the name of the little girl who [[Black Canary]] 'adopted'''<br>
'''Sin''' (real name '''Synthia Schmidt''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[villain]]ness in the [[Marvel Universe]]. She is the daughter of the [[Red Skull]].

==Character history==

Seeking an heir, the Red Skull fathered a daughter with a washerwoman. The woman died in childbirth, and the Red Skull almost killed the child, angry that it was a girl. One of his followers, Susan Scarbo, convinced him not to, telling him she would raise the girl herself as her nanny. The Skull agreed and left the girl (now named Synthia) to be raised by Scarbo, who indoctrinated her with the Skull's views as she grew up.  The Skull returned when Synthia was a child and put her in a machine that had her acceleratedly aged into adulthood and gave her superhuman powers.

As '''Mother Superior''', Synthia became the leader of a group called the "Sisters of Sin"; young orphan girls who were accelerated into adulthood and given powers by the Skull after being indoctrinated by Synthia. The Sisters of Sin would have many run-ins with the Red Skull's nemesis [[Captain America]] before being de-aged when they entered a chamber designed to reverse the Skull's aging process to assault Captain America - who had suffered through the Skull's process and had become elderly - while he was using it to return himself to normal, and they were reverted to children at the same time Captain America was restored (she would later claim she was deaged to the wrong age - but whether this is true, and in which direction, is unclear).

Later, Synthia's nanny, Susan Scarbo (now calling herself Mother Night), reformed the Sisters of Sin and became their new leader, while the deaged Synthia herself took the name '''Sister Sin'''.

She was later captured by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and taken to their reeducation facility, where they attempted to reprogram her to be a "normal" American girl and gave her false memories to that effect. Later, the Red Skull was assassinated by the [[Bucky|Winter Soldier]] under the orders of [[Aleksander Lukin]], and one of the Skulls's henchmen, [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]], broke into the facility and kidnapped Synthia. Crossbones tortured Synthia to break S.H.I.E.L.D's conditioning. After he succeeded, she entered into a relationship with him, and - with Synthia now calling herself simply '''Sin''' - the two went on a killing spree.  They later reunited with the Skull, now living inside the mind of General Lukin.

==Powers and abilities==

As Mother Superior, Sin possessed a range of superhuman powers including [[telepathy]], [[telekinesis]], [[teleportation]] and [[Wiktionary:intangible|intangibility]]. After she was deaged, she apparently lost these powers completely - unlike the other "Sisters of Sin", whose powers were diminished but not eliminated upon deaging. The reason for this discrepancy is unclear.

She is an expert in firearms and explosives.
