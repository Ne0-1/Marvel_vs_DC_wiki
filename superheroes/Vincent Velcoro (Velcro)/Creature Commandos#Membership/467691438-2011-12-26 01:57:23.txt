==History==
===Project M===
[[Project M]] is a secret government organization which began during [[World War II]] and specializes in experimental biotechnology and necromancy. Known creations of the Project include the Creature Commandos, [[Miss America (DC Comics)|Miss America]] and the ''G.I. Robot''. The Project's main scientist is one Professor Mazursky. He was aided by [[Robotman|Robert Crane]]. As told in Young All-Stars #12, they operated from a secret underground complex on mythical Ferris Island in [[New York]].<ref name="dc-ency"/>

In 1942, Project M created the Creature Commandos. They were:
'''Lt. Matthew Shrieve''' (normal), '''Warren Griffith''' (werewolf), '''Sgt. Vincent Velcro''' (vampire), '''Pvt. Elliot "Lucky" Taylor''' (frankenstein's monster) and '''Dr. Myrra Rhodes''' (medusa).

Project M yielded other interesting specimens. Most notably, they were behind the creation of the heroine, Miss America. Prof. Mazursky kidnapped her after his original subject perished. At first, his experiments appeared to have left her incapacitated. He later returned her unconscious form to the surface world. After that, she began a career as a masked hero but was critically injured while fighting alongside the [[Freedom Fighters (comics)|Freedom Fighters]]. Project M recovered her and nursed her back to health. While there, Project M was visited by the [[Young All-Stars]], who had discovered that Project M had been infiltrated. A criminal named [[Deathbolt]] was there seeking a new physical host for the disembodied brain of the [[Ultra-Humanite]]. The Ultra-Humanite took over the body of a dinosaur recovered from Dinosaur Island.

During the same visit, the All-Stars witnessed the unfinished body of the creature that would later be known as [[G.I. Robot]].<ref name=cosmicteams>[http://www.mykey3000.com/cosmicteams/cosmic/c.html Cosmic Teams Creature Commandos]</ref>

===World War II===
The team's first mission was in [[France]], where they destroyed [[Nazi]] manufactured android duplicates of the Allied leaders. In their next mission to France to free scientist Dr. Renee Frederique. The Commandos ultimately found her in a death camp, and they had no choice but to kill her. Her knowledge of a chemical nerve gas was too risky to be left in Nazi hands. Because of his part in the killing, Taylor attempted suicide. Although the doctors attempted to repair him, he remained mute for the rest of the series. On another morally dubious mission the team caused the deaths of dozens of super-soldier children.

In 1943, the Commandos were deployed to [[Dinosaur Island]] in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]]. They were supposed to solve the disappearance of several Allied spotter planes. They discovered a hidden Axis naval base and were able to trick the [[dinosaur]]s in turning on the Japanese navy. Shrieve took pictures for his commanders as proof of the island's existence. But Taylor destroyed them, he believed that the war would bring destruction to the dinosaurs. 

When next they returned to Dinosaur Island, they met the first '''J.A.K.E.''', the G.I. Robot. He met the Commandos when their plane was attacked by a dinosaur and crashed into the beach. Together, the soldiers discovered an underwater civilization, a supposed lost colony of [[Atlantis (DC Comics)|Atlantis]] situated in the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]]. The lost colony had created a group of robots to carry on the work of Atlantean conquest, and these androids took control of the G.I. Robot's mind. J.A.K.E. ultimately overrode their commands and sacrificed itself to destroy the colony.

At the end of the war, the remaining Creature Commandos and J.A.K.E. 2 (and his cat and dog) were forced to man a rocket aimed at [[Berlin]]. But the rocket went radically off course and headed out of the atmosphere into deep space. Much, much later, they (with J.A.K.E. as of Action Comics 872) appeared as captured in Brainiac's ship (Action Comics 868).<ref name=cosmicteams />

===Modern Era===
Somehow the original team later returned to Earth and to Project M, where they continued to serve as a special operations force. To keep pace with their aging physiology, Mazursky the doctor who had originally transformed them, continued to perform a series of body modifications. This process extended their lives, but at the cost of their humanity.

At an unspecified date in the near future, the various original team members adopted code names. Project M continued to grow in size, and the originals came to form the core field team codenamed M-Team Alpha. The Alpha team was sporadically infused with new operatives as attrition took its toll. Presumably, Lt. Shrieve died or retired along the way. In his place came Capt. Lucius Hunter formerly of [[Hunter's Hellcats]]. Hunter was said to be 74 years old, and a recipient of extensive body modifications and rejuvenation therapies. Other new members are: Aten, a mummy-like communications specialist; The Bogman, an [[amphibian]] grunt resembling the [[Creature from the Black Lagoon]]; and recently revived cyborg Gunner MacKay, who—along with his partner "Sarge"--died during World War II. Both Lucius Hunter and Gunner MacKay were feature characters in [[Our Fighting Forces]].<ref name="dc-ency"/>

While deep undercover, Medusa discovered that Earth's dimension was in danger of invasion by a military alliance from the alternate earth of '''Terra Arcana'''. This other-dimensional conglomerate of warlords included '''Lord Saturna''',  '''[[Hyathis]]''' of Alstair (killed by Tazzala), '''Tazzala''' of Korrl ([[Queen Bee (comics)#Tazzala|Queen Bee III]]), '''Sayvar''' reptile lord of Llarr, '''Kraad''' of Kranaal, '''Simon Magus''' of Blackstaff, '''Xotar''' the Weapons Master, '''Kromm''' of Mosteel (killed by Saturna), and the '''Troll King''' (killed by Velcoro).

In order to conquer earth the one remaining free dimension, Saturna's alliance enlisted the assistance of a powerful consortium on Future Earth. This group from Earth gave weapons and teleportation technology to the alliance in return for alien real estate. Tazzala and Magus soon betrayed Saturna, cutting their own deal with Murray. In the M-Team's raid on Terra Arcana, Velcoro and Gunner were captured by [[Claw the Unconquered]]. Claw was convinced to ally with them, and his people joined the battle against Saturna. In conclusion Tazzala killed Saturna and was, herself, killed. Terra Arcana's future was then left in the hands of its people.<ref name=cosmicteams />

The modern Creature Commandos later appeared in the [[The OMAC Project|OMAC Project]] mini-series, 2005&ndash;2006.

During the "[[Infinite Crisis]]: [[Villains United]]" [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]], a metahuman prison named "Enclave M" was shown in New Mexico. It's connection to Project M is unclear at this time. In the ''Booster Gold'' 2008 miniseries, [[Maxwell Lord]] mentions Project M as still active, at least in the times of his cyberization, and claims he was able to use their resources to give himself a new human body, free from the manipulations of [[Kilg%re]].

In the ''[[Justice League: Generation Lost]]'' storyline, Maxwell Lord, took control of the Creature Commandos to attack the old [[Justice League International|JLI]] embassy.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #15 (December 2010)</ref> During the battle Max reveals himself while posing as one of the Creature Commandos, in which he captures the [[Blue Beetle (Jaime Reyes)|Blue Beetle]] and escaped.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #16 (December 2010)</ref> Shortly thereafter the Creature Commandos were broken free from Max's influence, realizing they do not know why they are so far from their Project M base.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #17 (January 2011)</ref>

They also appear to be main characters in Frankenstein and the Agents of Shades within the new 52.

===Flashpoint===
In the alternate timeline of the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' event, Lt. Matthew Shrieve was ambushed by Nazi soldiers, and then saved by [[Frankenstein (DC Comics)|Frankenstein]]. Later, Shrieve and Frankenstein were invited by Project M to join the Creatures Commandos. After the end of World War II, however, Project M was deemed obsolete by [[Robotman (Robert Crane)|Robert Crane]]'s government services. Over 65 years later, Frankenstein and the Creatures Commandos revive and escape from the lab facility where they were imprisoned. General [[Captain Atom|Nathaniel Adam]] then contacted Shrieve's granddaughter, Miranda to hunt down the Creatures Commandos.<ref>''Flashpoint: Frankenstein and the Creatures of the Unknown'' #1 (June 2011)</ref> The Creatures Commandos then travel to Gotham City, where Dr. Mazursky last lived and find his cabin, only to learn he has moved to [[Romainia]]. The group is then ambushed by Miranda, along with the [[G.I. Robot]] and a platoon of soldiers. Miranda's tells them that her grandfather attempted to assemble a second incarnation of the Creatures Commandos, consisting of [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]], [[Man-Bat]] and [[Doctor Phosphorus]], who turned on him and killed him.

Later, the Creatures Commandos travel to Romania, where they found a small village populated by monsters. The village is then attacked by a giant G.I. Robot. Frankenstein and Bride combat the G.I. Robot, while Miranda helped Nina attend for Griffith's wounds, and suggest to the nearby castle where Dr. Mazursky is alive, who is then reunited with his daughter. Mazursky explains that the village's inhabitants were peaceful, and that they were the basis for creating the Creature Commandos. When Project M was deemed obsolete, Dr. Mazursky escaped and returned to the village for eternal life. After Frankenstein and Bride destroyed the G.I. Robot, Velcoro died from the sunrise, Griffith is recovering to being human again and developing a relationship with Nina.
