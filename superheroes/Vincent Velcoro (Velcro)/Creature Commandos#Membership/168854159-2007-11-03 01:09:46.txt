The '''Creature Commandos''' are a fictional [[DC Comics]] team of military superhumans first deployed in [[World War II]]. The original team, created by J.M. DeMatteis, was introduced in ''[[Weird War Tales]]'' #93 (November [[1980]]). 

The modern team first appeared in their own mini-series Creature Commandos #1 May [[2000]], this version was written by [[Tim Truman]] and drawn by [[Scott Eaton]].

==History==
===Project M===
Project M was a secret government organization which operated during [[World War II]] and specialized in experimental biotechnology and necromancy. Known creations of the Project include the Creature Commandos, [[Miss America (DC Comics)|Miss America]] and the ''G.I. Robot''. The Project's main scientist is one Professor Mazursky. He was aided by [[Robotman|Robert Crane]]. As told in Young All-Stars #12, they operated from a secret underground complex on mythical '''Ferris Island''' in [[New York]].

In 1942, Project M created the Creature Commandos. They were:
'''Lt. Matthew Shrieve''' (normal), '''Warren Griffith''' (werewolf), '''Sgt. Vincent Velcro''' (vampire), '''Pvt. Elliot "Lucky" Taylor''' (frankenstein's monster) and '''Dr. Myrra Rhodes''' (medusa).

Project M yielded other interesting specimens. Most notably, they were behind the creation of the heroine, Miss America. Prof. Mazursky kidnapped her after his original subject perished. At first, his experiments appeared to have left her incapacitated. He later returned her unconscious form to the surface world. After that, she began a masked heroing career but was critically injured while fighting alongside the [[Freedom Fighters (comics)|Freedom Fighters]]. Project M recovered her and nursed her back to health. While there, Project M was visited by the [[Young All-Stars]], who had discovered that Project M had been infiltrated. A criminal named [[Deathbolt]] was there seeking a new physical host for the disembodied brain of the [[Ultra-Humanite]]. The Ultra-Humanite took over the body of a dinosaur recovered from '''Dinosaur Island'''.

During the same visit, the All-Stars witnessed the unfinished body of the creature that would later be known as [[G.I. Robot]].[http://www.mykey3000.com/cosmicteams/cosmic/c.html]

===World War II===
The team's first mission was in [[France]], where they destroyed [[Nazi]] manufactured android duplicates of the Allied leaders. In their next mission to France to free scientist Dr. Renee Frederique. The Commandos ultimately found her in a death camp, and they had no choice but to kill her. Her knowledge of a chemical nerve gas was too risky to be left in Nazi hands. Because of his his part in the killing, Taylor attempted suicide. Although the doctors attempted to repair him, he remained mute for the rest of the series. On another morally dubious mission the team caused the deaths of dozens of super-soldier children.

In 1943, the Commandos were deployed to '''[[Dinosaur Island]]''' in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]]. They were supposed to solve the disappearance of several Allied spotter planes. They discovered a hidden Axis naval base and were able to trick the [[dinosaurs]] in turning on the Japanese navy. Shrieve took pictures for his commanders as proof of the island's existence. But Taylor destroyed them, he believed that the war would bring destruction to the dinosaurs. 

When next they returned to Dinosaur Island, they met the first '''J.A.K.E.''', the G.I. Robot. He met the Commandos when their plane was attacked by a dinosaur and crashed into the beach. Together, the soldiers discovered an underwater civilization, a supposed lost colony of [[Atlantis (DC Comics)|Atlantis]] situated in the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]]. The lost colony had created a group of robots to carry on the work of Atlantean conquest, and these androids took control of the G.I. Robot's mind. J.A.K.E. ultimately overrode their commands and sacrificed itself to destroy the colony.

At the end of the war, the remaining Creature Commandos and J.A.K.E. 2 were forced to man a rocket aimed at [[Berlin]]. But the rocket went radically off course and headed out of the atmosphere into deep space.[http://www.mykey3000.com/cosmicteams/cosmic/c.html]

===Modern Era===
Somehow the original team later returned to Earth and to '''Project M''', where they continued to serve as a special operations force. To keep pace with their aging physiology, Mazursky the doctor who had originally transformed them, continued to perform a series of body modifications. This process extended their lives, but at the cost of their humanity.

At an unspecified date in the near future, the various original team members adopted code names. Project M continued to grow in size, and the originals came to form the core field team codenamed '''M-Team Alpha'''. The Alpha team was sporadically infused with new operatives as attrition took its toll. Presumably, Lt. Shrieve died or retired along the way. In his place came Capt. Lucius Hunter formerly of '''Hunter's Hellcats'''. Hunter was said to be 74 years old, and a recipient of extensive body modifications and rejuvination therapies. Other new members are: Aten a mummy like communications specialist, The Bogman an [[amphibian]] grunt remsembling the [[Creature from the Black Lagoon]], and recently revived cyborg Gunner MacKay, who along with his partner "Sarge" had died during World War II. Both Lucius Hunter and Gunner macKay were feature characters in [[Our Fighting Forces]]. 

While deep undercover, Medusa discovered that Earth's dimension was in danger of invasion by a military alliance from the alternate earth of '''Terra Arcana'''. This other-dimensional conglomerate of warlords included '''Lord Saturna''',  '''[[Hyathis]]''' of Alstair (killed by Tazzala), '''Tazzala''' of Korrl ([[Queen Bee (comics)#Tazzala|Queen Bee III]]), '''Sayvar''' reptile lord of Llarr, '''Kraad''' of Kranaal, '''Simon Magus''' of Blackstaff, '''Xotar''' the Weapons Master, '''Kromm''' of Mosteel (killed by Saturna), and the '''Troll King''' (killed by Velcoro).

In order to conquer earth the one remaining free dimension, Saturna's alliance enlisted the assistance of a powerful consortium on Future Earth. This group from Earth gave weapons and teleportation technology to the alliance in return for alien real estate. Tazzala and Magus soon betrayed Saturna, cutting their own deal with Murray. In the M-Team's raid on Terra Arcana, Velcoro and Gunner were captured by [[Claw the Unconquered]]. Claw was convinced to ally with them, and his people joined the battle against Saturna. In conclusion Tazzala killed Saturna and was, herself, killed. Terra Arcana's future was then left in the hands of its people.[http://www.mykey3000.com/cosmicteams/cosmic/c.html]

The modern Creature Commandos later appeared in the [[Omac]] miniseries, 2005&ndash;2006.

During the Infinite Crisis: [[Villains United]] one-shot, a metahuman prison named "Enclave M" was shown in New Mexico. It's connection to Project M is unclear at this time.

==Trivia==
*The Creature Commandos mini-series is not billed as an "[[Elseworlds]]", but the author [[Tim Truman]] describes it as taking place "'''a second in the future'''". Various modifications were made to the team member's names and appearances. Truman renamed original team members Velcro and Myrna as "Velcoro" and "Myrra".[http://www.mykey3000.com/cosmicteams/cosmic/c.html]
*Truman said he based Patch's character on the DCU's Patchwork Man from Swamp Thing v.1 #2.[http://www.mykey3000.com/cosmicteams/cosmic/c.html]
*The villains in this series are old [[Justice League of America]] villains dating back from 1960 through 1963. Xotar's first appearance was [[The Brave and the Bold|Brave and the Bold]] #29. Simon Magus, Saturna, the Troll King are from JLA #2. [[Hyathis]], Kromm and Sayvar are from issue Justice League of America #3. Tazzala is presumably some relation to Zazzala, who appeared in Justice League of America #23. Kraad is from Justice League of America #25.[http://www.mykey3000.com/cosmicteams/cosmic/c.html] 
*The usage of [[Claw the Unconquered]] in this series is rendered true to his pre-Crisis origins.[http://www.mykey3000.com/cosmicteams/cosmic/c.html]
