==Fictional character biography==
Jason Woodrue first appears in ''The Atom'' #1 (June–July 1962).  Woodrue is an exile from an interdimensional world (Floria)<ref name=secret23>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Rick Veitch|Veitch, Rick]] | Artist = [[Brett Ewins|Ewins, Brett]] | Story = The Secret Origin of The Guardians of the Universe | Title = Secret Origins | Issue = 23 | Date = February 1988 | Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> inhabited by [[dryad]]s. Calling himself the Plant Master, Woodrue uses his advanced botanical knowledge to control plant growth in an attempt to take over the world. He is defeated by the superheroic Atom.<ref name="dc-ency"/> Plant Master returns to face the Atom<ref>''The Atom'' #24 (Apr/May 1966)</ref> and the [[Justice League]].<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 1) #61 (March 1968)</ref>

In ''Flash'' (vol. 1) #245 (November 1976), Woodrue uses an experimental formula to transform his body into a plant/human hybrid, with his skin resembling bark and his hair turning into leaves.<ref name=secret23/> Now calling himself the Floronic Man, he is defeated by [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]].<ref name="dc-ency"/><ref name=secret23/> After a rematch with the Atom and [[Wonder Woman]],<ref>''[[Super-Team Family]]'' #14</ref> the Floronic Man later becomes a member of the [[Secret Society of Super-Villains]].<ref name=secret23/><ref>''Secret Society of Super-Villains'' #11 (December 1977)</ref>

In [[Alan Moore]]'s relaunch of the [[Swamp Thing]] in ''Saga of the Swamp Thing'' #21 (February 1984), Woodrue is hired by General Averly Sunderland to discover how scientist Alec Holland had been turned into the Swamp Thing.<ref name=secret23/> Woodrue discovers that the creature, instead of being a mutated version of Holland, is rather an intelligent mass of plant life that had fed on Holland's dead body and absorbed his knowledge and memories. The Floronic Man tries to warn Sunderland that the Swamp Thing is not dead, but the General refuses to listen and announces his intent to terminate Woodrue's employment. Subsequently, the Floronic Man traps Sunderland in his office with a thawed and enraged Swamp Thing, who kills the General.<ref name=secret23/>

In ''Saga of the Swamp Thing'' #22 (March 1984), the Floronic Man uses the Swamp Thing's body—now regressing to a plant-like state out of his inability to accept the new revelation about his origins, Woodrue literally eating parts of him—to contact the Green, which is composed of the life force of all plants on Earth. The experience drives the Floronic Man insane, and he sets out to destroy all nonplant life on Earth by forcing the plants to produce an excess amount of oxygen to force humanity into extinction, in the belief that he is 'saving' Earth from mankind. Woodrue is confronted by a revived Swamp Thing, who reveals to the Green that plants cannot survive without animals as he is depriving them of the carbon dioxide they require to breathe, forcing Woodrue to acknowledge that his actions are the actions of a man rather than a plant. The Green abandons the Floronic Man, who is then taken into custody by the Justice League after undergoing a complete mental breakdown.<ref name=secret23/><ref>''Saga of the Swamp Thing'' #24 (May 1984)</ref>

The 1988 [[Neil Gaiman]]/[[Dave McKean]] miniseries ''[[Black Orchid (comics)|Black Orchid]]'' recasts Dr. Jason Woodrue as a University professor who taught botany to Philip Sylvian, [[Swamp Thing|Alec & Linda Holland]], and [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Pamela Isley]]. The character Philip Sylvian, apparently unaware of Woodrue's transformation, refers to him as a "poor old guy" and states: "Last I heard he was in Arkham ''Insane'' Asylum..."

The Floronic Man was briefly a hero, after the events of [[Millennium (comics)|Millennium]] led to him to become a member of the [[New Guardians]]. In this new role, Woodrue takes on the name Floro. After the death of most of his teammates, he reverts to his original status as a villain.

Floro returns in ''Batman: Shadow of the Bat'' #56 (November 1996). After breaking [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] out of Arkham with his two underlings Holly and Eva, Floro explains his past to [[Batman]] and Poison Ivy, telling the story of how he prevented a plot of Swamp Thing's only to get [[decapitated]]. After scientists manage to keep his head alive, the first thing he comes in contact with is [[marijuana]]. Regenerating a plant body, he begins his quest to flood the streets of Gotham City with his advanced and cheap pot. Floronic Man takes some of Poison Ivy's DNA in an attempt to create a "child". Poison Ivy, in exchange, gets a trunk full of dope money, and is free to walk away. Deciding she does not want Floronic Man running the world, she frees the Batman. After a short battle, Batman notices that Floronic Man is standing in a puddle, and uses an electrical cable to electrocute the villain, then decapitates him once again.

The character has since appeared in various other comics and storylines. He assists [[Starman (Jack Knight)|Starman]], [[Alan Scott]], Batman and others in trying to save a friendly, peaceful version of [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]].<ref>''Starman'' (vol. 2) #33–35 (August–October 1997)</ref> In a recent issue of ''[[Batman]]'', he is killed after assassins shoot him repeatedly with bullets, although this is in direct contrast to his most famous appearance (in ''The Saga of the Swamp Thing'' #21) in which he points out that "you can't kill a vegetable by shooting it through the head."  He is one of the many villains who was mind-wiped by the JLA, but has since recovered those memories.<ref>''JLA'' #115–119 (August–November 2005)</ref>

During the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Floronic Man appears as a member of [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] and takes part in the Battle of Metropolis.<ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #7</ref>

In the post-''Infinite Crisis'' DCU, he is responsible for Pamela Isley's transformation into Poison Ivy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dccomics.com/dcu/heroes_and_villains/?hv=origin_stories/poison_ivy&p=1 |title=DCU &#124; Heroes and Villains |publisher=Dccomics.com |date=2010-04-21 |accessdate=2011-03-22}}</ref>

In [[The New 52]] (a reboot of the DC Comics universe), Woodrue is re-introduced in Swamp Thing Annual, making a deal with The Green by taking care of Alec Holland.<ref>''Swamp Thing Annual'' #1</ref> Woodrue is later revealed to be '''The Seeder''', now endowed with powers by the Parliament of Trees. Swamp Thing had been hunting him for disrupting the balance of the Green. The Parliament of Trees decides that he and Swamp Thing must fight, once they have fully realized their powers, to decide who shall be the champion of the Green.<ref>''Swamp Thing'' #24 (Dec 2013)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
In his original form, Jason Woodrue had advanced knowledge of [[botany]], which he used to accelerate plant growth. After becoming the Floronic Man, Woodrue gains the ability to merge with and mentally control plant life. After eating the 'organs' of the Swamp Thing, this power expanded to allow Woodrue to control all of the world's plants for a time, but he lost this power after Swamp Thing forced him to recognise that the loss of animals would also destroy the plants.

==In other media==

===Television===
* A character loosely based on Jason Woodrue's Plant Master appearance appears in an episode of the "Atom" segment of ''[[The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure]]'' called "The Plant Master" voiced by [[Ted Knight]]. Straal is a scientist who has discovered a way to use wave patterns with plant growths. When a plane carrying members of Ivy University science faculty lands on his island as part of a plan to establish a research center, Plant Master uses his special plants to knock them out and have his henchmen capture them. When Atom arrives, he takes out Plant Master's henchmen before being captured by Plant Master and his pet cat. Plant Master then places Atom in a container where he is strangled by living grass that Plant Master activated. With some unknowing help from Plant Master's cat, Atom was able to defeat Plant Master where he and his henchmen are arrested by the Coast Guard.
* Dr. Woodrue is referenced several times in the ''[[Swamp Thing: The Series|Swamp Thing]]'' [[television series]]. In this incarnation, he is a scientist that is a rival of [[Anton Arcane|Dr. Arcane]]. He invented some sort of method to "grow" human life by artificial means.

Dr. Woodrue is shown in a [[South America]]n lab (before financed by [[Wayne Enterprises]]) where he uses plant toxins to turn a [[serial killer]] facing [[life imprisonment]] into a super-soldier named Bane.

Woodrue offers her the opportunity to join him, but she refuses and threatens to report him. Woodrue attempts to kill her by throwing her into a shelf full of plant chemicals and toxins.
