The '''Floronic Man''' is the alias used by the villainous scientist Jason Woodrue, a character in the [[DC Comics]] universe.  He was created as an enemy of the [[Atom (comics)|Atom]], which remains his regular nemesis and still fights on a fairly regular basis, but his most famous appearance was in the ''[[Swamp Thing]]'' comic, particularly when it was written by [[Alan Moore]].  

A bio-chemical mishap has turned Woodrue into a plant/human creature, similar to the titular Swamp Thing, but with a more vengeful nature and an obsession with protecting the plant world from what he perceives as an assault by humanity.  He once almost achieved this goal by using his newly gained control over plants to make them produce excess [[oxygen]] so the slightest spark could cause devastating fires around the world.  However, he was foiled when the Swamp Thing pointed out that this attempt was in fact devastating the plants since killing all the oxygen breathers would mean cutting off the production of [[carbon dioxide]] that plants need to live. He was then apprehended by the [[Justice League]].

Along his history he is responsible for mutanting [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], has fought the JLA on several ocasions and was recently a member of an incarnation of the [[Injustice Gang]]. The Floronic Man was briefly a hero, after the events of [[Millennium (comics)|Millennium]] led to him becoming a member of the [[New Guardians]].  After the death of most of his teammates, he seems to have reverted to his original status as a villain.

The character has appeared in various other comics and storylines: in a recent issue of [[Batman]] he was killed after assassins shot him repeatedly with bullets, although this is in direct contrast to his most famous appearance, in which he pointed out that "you can't kill a vegetable by shooting it through the head". He is one of the many villains who was mind-wiped by the JLA, but he has since recovered those memories.

==Other Media==

He was played by actor [[John Glover]] in the 1997 film ''[[Batman and Robin]]'' in which he was a minor character responsible for the origins of [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] and Poison Ivy. In the film, he is simply corrupt scientist Jason Woodrue, not the Floronic Man.
