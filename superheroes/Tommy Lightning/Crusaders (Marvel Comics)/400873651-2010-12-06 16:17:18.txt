'''The Crusaders''' is the name of a group of [[fictional characters]] that appear in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The characters first appear in ''[[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]]'' #14 (Mar. 1977) and were created by [[Roy Thomas]];[[Jack Kirby]] and [[Frank Robbins]].

==Publication history==
The Crusaders first appear in the [[World War II]] title ''[[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]]'', and capture the crew of a crashed [[Germany|German]] [[bomber]]. Accepted by the [[United Kingdom|British]] people, the team (''[[Captain Wings]]''; ''[[Destroyer (Roger Aubrey)|Dyna-Mite]]''; ''[[Ghost Girl (Marvel Comics)|Ghost Girl]]''; ''The [[Spirit of '76 (comics)|Spirit of '76]]''; ''Thunder Fist'' and ''Tommy Lightning'') become the official protectors of the current [[King]] (''[[George VI]]''), thereby displacing the [[United States|American]] [[superhero]] team the Invaders. The Crusaders, are revealed to be guided by  a [[cabbie]] driver and apparent British [[spy]] called '''Alfie''', who can cancel their powers courtesy of a technological belt the character wears.

The character Dyna-Mite, who has no memory of his former life, becomes suspicious and spies on Alfie, learning he is a [[Nazi]] agent and is planning to use the heroes to [[assassinate]] the King. Dyna-Mite warns the Invaders, and Alfie instigates a fight between the heroes and the Crusaders. The Nazi is killed in a car crash attempting to escape from the ''[[Human Torch (android)|Human Torch]]''. The Crusaders, now powerless, disband, although Dyna-mite - revealed to be Roger Aubrey, the close friend of Brian Falsworth, the brother of Invader ''[[Spitfire (comics)|Spitfire]]'' -  remains trapped in a minute form.<ref>''Invaders'' #14 - 15 (Mar. - Apr. 1977)</ref>

Aubrey is eventually restored to normal height and adopts Falsworth's former heroic identity as the Destroyer, now calling himself the [[Destroyer (Timely Comics)|Mighty Destroyer]] (as Falsworth eventually succeeded his father James Falsworth as [[Union Jack (comics)#Union Jack (Brian Falsworth)|Union Jack II]]).<ref>''Invaders'' #26 (Mar. 1978)</ref>

===Conception===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}
The Crusaders were based on the DC Comics' superhero team The Freedom Fighters.
* Captain Wings = Black Condor
* Dyna-Mite = Doll Man
* Ghost Girl = Phantom Lady
* Spirit of '76 = Uncle Sam
* Thunder Fist = Human Bomb
* Tommy Lightning = The Ray

At the same time the Invaders were meeting the Crusaders at Marvel Comics, over in DC's comic book the Freedom Fighters, that group was also facing off against a team called The Crusaders (in Freedom Fighters issue numbers 8 and 9), with the DC version of The Crusaders based upon Marvel Comics' The Invaders.  (Several of the Crusaders that fought the Freedom Fighters were really "comic book fans" named "Lennie" (Len Wein), "Marvin" (Marv Wolfman), "Arch" (Archie Goodwin), and "Roy" (Roy Thomas), as shown in Freedom Fighters issue No. 9.)
