''Princess Zarda (aka Power Princess)'', based on '''[[Wonder Woman]]''' 
==[[Squadron Supreme]]==
*'''Power Princess''' lived on Utopia Isle, a small island in the southern sea, untouch by [[civilzation]]. The Utopians believe themselves to be the result of genetic experimentation conducted upon [[Homo sapiens]]. While the rest of [[Homo sapiens]] was making [[flint spearheads]], the Utopians developed a [[culture]] based on peace, fellowship and experience or learning. On their little island community people knew no [[poverty]], [[injustice]], [[war]], [[crime]], or [[sexual discrimination]]. After the outside world made the first [[atom bomb]], the Utopians believed way of life was in jeopardy. So building a starship, they left the earth to find a new home among the stars. Princess Zarda chose to remain behind as their sole emissary to the earth, a role she had assumed some years earlier.
*Living in Capitol city Magelland with Howard Sheltion who she met 50-60 years ago, the sole survivor of a sinking ship and the first from the outside world she got to know and grew to love.
