'''Power Princess''', real name Zarda, is a fictional character in [[Marvel Comics]]. She resides in an alternate universe (not the [[Marvel Universe]] which is populated by [[Spider-Man]], the [[Fantastic Four]], etc.) and is a member of the superhero group, the [[Squadron Supreme]]. Her character was originally developed as a thinly disguised analog of [[DC Comics]]' [[Wonder Woman]]. Since the debut of Marvel's [[MAX (comics)|MAX]] title ''[[Supreme Power]]'', the Squadron Supreme characters have been [[reboot (continuity)|reboot]]ed. 

{{spoiler}}
==Various incarnations of Power Princess==

===Squadron Supreme===

Princess Zarda lived on Utopia Isle, a small island in the southern sea, untouched by outside [[civilization]]. The Utopians believe themselves to be the result of genetic experimentation conducted upon [[Homo sapiens]]; they are, indeed, the equivalent on the Squadron's Earth of the [[Inhumans]]. While the rest of [[Homo sapiens]] were making [[flint]] spearheads, the Utopians developed an advanced [[culture]] based on peace, fellowship and experience or learning. On their little island community, people knew no [[poverty]], [[injustice]], [[war]], [[crime]], or [[sexual discrimination]]. After the outside world made the first [[atom bomb]], the Utopians believed their way of life was in jeopardy. Building a starship, they left Earth to find a new home. Princess Zarda chose to remain behind as their sole emissary to the earth, a role she had assumed some years earlier as Power Princess.

Living in Capitol City, she married Howard Shelton, a sailor whom she met during "the war" (possibly World War II). Howard was the sole survivor of a sinking ship and the first outsider Zarda met. Howard aged normally while Zarda appears to be the same age as she was when they met, 50&ndash;60 years earlier. Howard eventually died, leaving Zarda free to pursue a romanctic relationship with [[Hyperion (comics)|Hyperion]].

===Supreme Power===

The new Princess debuted in ''[[Supreme Power]]'' #2. Apparently a [[Greek god]]dess who sleeps in a mausoleum, at one point she wakes up and finds the injured [[Hyperion (Supreme Power)|Hyperion]], healing him. She alludes to having similar origins to Hyperion and a mission to colonize and conquer the planet, but her memories seem mixed up. After separating, Zarda goes on a rampage, disregarding human life and private property. Zarda is no longer called Power Princess or acts like a superhero. She attempted to remove [[Doctor Spectrum]]'s power prism and it tried to retrieve her memories, but before that happened, she was attacked by [[Amphibian (comics)|Amphibian]] in retaliation for harming Spectrum. Later, Zarda kills a woman and steals her identification, in hopes of starting anew, while working in a women's clothing store.

Her powers include some healing based abilities. Zarda's first appearance is as an extremely aged crone. After killing a man that sees, she then appears as her current form of a youthful woman. Twice in the series, after noticing a gray hair or a scratch from a fight, she's killed a human female via an energy flash from her eyes. Both times, her "imperfection" was removed. On the opposite end of the scale, she used a similar energy flash to heal Hyperion when he received life threatening injuries.

Her insanity may be linked to having semi-slept for 2,000 years in a mausoleum awaiting the arrival of Hyperion.
