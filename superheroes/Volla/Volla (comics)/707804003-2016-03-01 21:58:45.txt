===Video games===
* Volla appears as a non-playable character in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'', voiced by [[Nika Futterman]]. One of the optional missions in Niffleheim involves finding a trunk that contains her ring and its key is missing. This has been stolen by [[Kurse]] and [[Ulik]]. If the player recovers Volla's ring, she will warn [[Odin (comics)|Odin]] about an attempt on his life which will lead to the capture of [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]] in the years to come. If not, she won't warn Odin about an attempt on his life and the death of Odin will plunge Asgard into years of chaos during which Thor will rule Asgard after [[Sif (comics)|Sif]] dies in battle. On a side note, she has special dialogue with [[Carol Danvers|Ms. Marvel]] when the player first meets her, and with [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] after the player finds her ring. After the player beats Baron Mordo and Ultron, there are four replicas placed alongside Odin's spear. When the player has found Volla's ring, the real spear that would lead them to where Doctor Doom has taken Loki glows.
