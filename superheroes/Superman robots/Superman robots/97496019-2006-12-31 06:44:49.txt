'''Superman Robots''' were [[List of fictional robots and androids|fictional robots]] from the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|Universe]].  The robots resembled [[Superman]] in appearance and [[Superman's powers and abilities|abilities]].

==Silver Age versions==
Superman robots played a particularly dominant role in late 1950s and 1960s era Superman comics, when readers were first introduced to Superman possessing various robot duplicates. These robots each possessed a fraction of the Man of Steel's powers, and were sometimes used to substitute for him on missions (such as those where [[kryptonite]] was present) or for the purposes of protecting his [[secret identity]] (to that end, Superman also possessed a few [[Clark Kent]] robots). One notable Superman robot is Ajax A.K.A [[Wonder Man (DC Comics)|Wonder Man]]

The idea of Superman robots were extended into [[Superboy]] stories of the period as well, where it was revealed that Superboy also possessed robot duplicates of himself (both as Superboy and as Clark Kent). Nearly all of these robots were either deactivated or converted into adult-sized robots when Superboy grew up to become Superman.

In the early 1970s, the Superman comics largely abandoned the use of Superman robots as part of a change in the books' tone and writing style; the excuse given in the comics was that Earth's pollution levels and atmospheric conditions had rendered Superman's robots unusable.

==Modern Age versions==
The notion of Superman robots were reintroduced for [[post-Crisis]] comic continuity in a late 1990s storyline. During the period where Superman (under the control of [[Dominus_(DC_Comics)|Dominus]]) felt he must police the entire earth, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week he built an army of Superman Robots (created in his own image, all wearing the famous "S" shield but wearing variations of the Red, Blue and Yellow costume). However, unlike the pre-Crisis Superman robots, these automata were not realistic androids capable of passing for the real Superman, but instead were obviously mechanical, with metallic bodies that possessed no artificial skin. These modern Superman Robot's powers included Super-Strength, Flight and Heat Vision, but were inferior to Superman's own powers. The Superman Robots were also given a small degree of [[sentience]], making each one an autonomous agent of the Man of Steel. Their job: To protect mankind (aggressively if necessary) and attend to crises beyond Superman's reach.

Once Dominus had been defeated, Superman had most of the Robots destroyed. One particular Robot (programmed to protect [[Lois Lane|Lois]]) was particularly difficult to get rid of.

After [[Krypto]] almost killed [[Mongul]], Superman realised that he was too dangerous to have around and so confined him to the [[Fortress of Solitude]], where one robot is currently employed as Krypto's caretaker. The robot is programmed to give off Superman's scent every now and again to keep Krypto happy.  The robot is named "Ned".

In more recent times, a forgotten unit became active, its powers increased to a prodigious level thanks to its possession by [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac 8]], and fought the [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]], killing [[Donna Troy]] and [[Lilith (DC Comics)|Omen]] before it was defeated.

==Elseworlds Versions==
In [[Superman: Red Son]], the Superman robots are actually Soviet citizens lobotomized and fitted with cybernetic implants for speaking or acting against the Soviet regime.
