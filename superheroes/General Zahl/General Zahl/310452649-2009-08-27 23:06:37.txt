==Biography==
General Zahl is a former Nazi [[U-boat]] captain who tangled from time to time with the [[Doom Patrol]], originally as "Captain Zahl."

As a U-boat captain, Zahl was ruthless and effective, achieving the highest kill number of any commander in the German fleet.  After the fall of the Nazis, Captain Zahl worked as a mercenary, until a conflict with the Doom Patrol forced him into retirement. Later, Zahl (now calling himself "General Zahl") assisted [[Madame Rouge]] in apparently killing the Doom Patrol. Madame Rouge had previously succeeded (also apparently) in destroying the other members of the [[Brotherhood of Evil]].<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Years later, [[Beast Boy|Changeling]], [[Robotman (comics)#Cliff Steele|Robotman]], and the [[Teen Titans]] tracked down Zahl and Rouge. In the conflict, bullets ricocheted from Robotman's chest, killing Zahl.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

==Powers and abilities==
Zahl is a skilled military commander and soldier, but has no superhuman powers.

==Trivia==
{{trivia|date=January 2008}}
