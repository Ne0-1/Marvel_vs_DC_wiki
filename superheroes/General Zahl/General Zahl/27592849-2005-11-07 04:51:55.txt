'''General Zahl''' is a [[DC Comics]] villain.  He first appeared in [[Doom Patrol]] v.1 #121.

==Biography==
General Zahl is a former Nazi [[U-boat]] captain, who tangled from time to time with the [[Doom Patrol]], originally as "Captain Zahl." Note: Zahl is a different character from fellow Doom Patrol villain [[General Immortus]].  

As a U-boat captain, Zahl was ruthless and effective, achiving the highest kill number of any commander in the German fleet.  After the fall of the Nazis, Captain Zahl served as a mercenary, until a conflict with the Doom Patrol forced him into retirement. Later, Zahl (now calling himself "General Zahl") assisted [[Madame Rouge]] in apparently killing the Doom Patrol. Madame Rouge had previously succeeded (also apparently) in destroying the other members of the [[Brotherhood of Evil]].

Years later, [[Beast Boy|Changeling]], [[Robotman]], and the [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]] tracked down Zahl and Rouge. In the conflict, bullets ricocheted from Robotman's chest, killing Zahl.

In 2004, DC writer [[John Byrne]] resurrected the ''Doom Patrol'' series and declared that the previous history had never happened. [[As of 2005]], it remains to be seen what history, if any, Zahl now has.

==Powers and abilities==
Zahl is a skilled military commander and soldier, but has no superhuman powers.
