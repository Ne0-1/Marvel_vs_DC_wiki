He first appeared in ''[[Justice League|Justice League of America Annual]]'' #2 (October 1984),<ref name="GCD"/> and was created by [[Gerry Conway]] and [[Chuck Patton]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Manning|first= Matthew K.|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1980s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 209 |quote = The prestigious Justice League of America got a bit easier to join, thanks to writer Gerry Conway and artist Chuck Ryan Patton.

==Fictional character biography==
Paco Ramone or Francisco "Cisco" Ramone's career as Vibe began shortly after [[Aquaman]] disbanded the original [[Justice League]]. When young Cisco heard that a  [[Justice League Detroit|new Justice League]] was forming in his own hometown of Detroit, he decided to give up his position as the leader of a local street gang, Los Lobos, to join.<ref name="GCD"/> What made Ramon a candidate was his [[metahuman]] ability to emit powerful vibratory shock waves.

Vibe's presence on the team caused Aquaman and the [[Martian Manhunter]] to harbor some strong doubts about the new JLA, particularly after he got the League involved in a rumble with a rival gang.<ref>''Justice League of America'' #233 (December 1984)</ref> Vibe soon proved his mettle during the League's battles against [[Cadre (comics)|Cadre]],<ref>''Justice League of America'' #233-236 (December 1984-February 1985). DC Comics</ref> Anton Allegro<ref>''Justice League of America'' #237-239 (July–September 1985). DC Comics</ref> and [[Amazo]].<ref>''Justice League of America'' #241-243 (August–October 1985). DC Comics</ref> He stayed with the League through the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' crossover, when his powers played a vital role in defeating Despero.<ref>''Justice League of America'' #254 (September 1986). DC Comics</ref>

During Darkseid's assault on Earth during the ''[[Legends (comics)|Legends]]'' mini-series, the Justice League of America was disbanded and Paco left his JLA comrades to seek the familiar solace of the streets. Vibe was attacked by one of [[Professor Ivo]]'s androids, and  became the first Justice League member to be killed in the line of duty.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer =  | Penciller = [[Luke McDonnell|McDonnell, Luke]] | Inker = [[Bob Smith (comics)|Smith, Bob]] | Story = [[J.

One of Vibe's younger brothers, Armando, developed a similar set of vibratory powers and joined [[Booster Gold]]'s team of heroes, the  [[The Conglomerate (comics)|Conglomerate]], using the code names Reverb and later Hardline.<ref>''Justice League Quarterly'' #1 (Winter 1990)</ref> He has since been depicted as the owner of a dance club named Reverb in the Little Tachyon section of Old Town Metropolis.<ref>''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman Annual]]'' #14. DC Comics</ref>

In the ''[[Trinity (comic book)|Trinity]]'' maxi-series, reality is altered, and a living Cisco is shown as a member of The League, an underground version of the Justice League.<ref>''Trinity'' #25 (November 2008). DC Comics</ref> Soon after [[Superman]], [[Batman]] and [[Wonder Woman]] return, his head is disintegrated by an energy blast, killing him again.

===Blackest Night===
In a ''Justice League of America'' tie-in to the "[[Blackest Night]]" storyline, Vibe was reanimated as a member of the [[Black Lantern Corps]], rising from his coffin in the [[Hall of Justice (comics)|Hall of Justice]].<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #39 (November 2009)</ref> Alongside the Black Lantern [[Commander Steel|Steel]], Vibe attacked his former teammates, [[Gypsy (comics)|Gypsy]] and [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]], until [[Doctor Light (Kimiyo Hoshi)|Doctor Light]] destroyed him.<ref>''Justice League of America'' (Vol. 2) #40 (December 2009). DC Comics</ref>

===The New 52===
In DC's [[Free Comic Book Day]] 2012 sample during ''[[The New 52]]'', a gatefold revealed various characters who will make an appearance in ''Justice League'' over the coming year, one of which is Vibe. [[Geoff Johns]] revealed that Vibe's return would be explored in greater detail in the third story arc of ''Justice League''.<ref>{{cite news| last= Truitt |first= Brian |date= 4 May 2012 |url= http://www.usatoday.com/life/comics/story/2012-05-05/DC-Comics-Free-Comic-Book-Day-issue/54730640/1 |title= Geoff Johns gives out good vibes for Free Comic Book Day |newspaper= [[USA Today]]}}</ref> On August 26, 2012, DC announced a new ''Justice League of America'' title which would feature Vibe.<ref>Mullin, Pamela (August 26, 2012).

'Arrow' Creator Andrew Kreisberg On DC Comics New 'Vibe' Ongoing Series |work= MTV Geek |publisher=MTV.com }}</ref> In new continuity, Vibe's powers derive from being "caught in the [[event horizon]] of a [[Boom Tube]]", in which "interdimensional forces rewrote his [[DNA]]". ''Justice League of America's Vibe'' lasted for ten issues, with the final issue released on December 18, 2013.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=48521 | title= 'Superman Unchained' Skips January; 'Vibe,' 'Katana' Ending | publisher= Comic Book Resources | date= 15 October 2013| accessdate= 11 May 2014}}</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Vibe's sonic powers enabled him to create shock waves of considerable strength. His power could shatter concrete or steel. His agility was above average (and he was a superb [[breakdancing|breakdancer]]). Under Batman's tutelage, Vibe became a more skilled combatant.{{citation needed|date= May 2014}}

Vibe's reintroduction in 2013 has sought to establish him as a more powerful character. Part of this was redefining his powers as having to do with interdimensional physics. ''Justice League of America'' establishes that Vibe's sonic waves have the power to disrupt the [[Speed Force]], making him one of the few characters in the [[DC Universe]] who poses a serious threat to [[Flash (comics)|the Flash]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]] | story=Trinity War, Part Two |title= Justice League of America |issue= 6 |date= 2013}}</ref> For this reason, he is recruited into the JLA by [[Steve Trevor]], which exists to guard against the threat of the main Justice League going rogue.<ref name=JLA1>Johns, Geoff. ''Justice League of America'' #1 (2013)</ref> In ''Justice League of America's Vibe'' #3, [[Amanda Waller]] says "Cisco Ramon might be one of the most powerful super-humans on the planet. He wields vibrational powers that could in theory shake the Earth apart. And he's the only person we know of who can find and track interdimensional breaches." <ref>Gates, Sterling. ''Justice League of America's Vibe'' #3 (2013)</ref> He is also undetectable by security cameras.<ref name=JLA1/>

==Other versions==

===''Justice League Unlimited''===
Vibe has a major role in issue 15 of the ''Justice League Unlimited'' comic book series where he stopped [[Doctor Sivana]]'s plan to rebuild [[Mister Atom]].<ref>http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Justice_League_Unlimited_Vol_1_15</ref>

==In other media==

===Television===
* Vibe has made several appearances in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]].'' He was often seen next to other members of the Detroit League, but he did not get a major role in any episode. His most prominent action is helping rescue civilians in the New Mexico city attacked in "Flashpoint". He is shown with fellow Detroit-era members Vixen, Steel and Gypsy in the final "curtain call" of the episode "Destroyer".
* Vibe appears in a series of ''[[DC Nation Shorts]]'' voiced by [[Carlos Alazraqui]]. In a two-part short, he goes up against [[Professor Ivo]]'s breakdancing robot Extremo in a breakdancing contest.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

[[File:Cisco Ramon (Carlo Valdes).jpg|150px|thumbnail|right|[[Carlos Valdes (actor)|Carlos Valdes]] as Cisco Ramon on the CW series ''The Flash''.]]
* [[Carlos Valdes (actor)|Carlos Valdes]] portrays Cisco Ramon on The CW's ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' and ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]''. He made his debut as a guest in the ''Arrow'' episode "The Man Under the Hood" and is a series regular on ''The Flash''. Along with [[Killer Frost|Dr. Caitlin Snow]] ([[Danielle Panabaker]]), he is part of the S.T.A.R. Labs team which supports Barry Allen ([[Grant Gustin]]) in using his powers to save lives and fight crime as the Flash, and eventually becomes good friends with Barry. He helps design technology to help Barry's superhero career as the Flash, and in crossover episodes with ''Arrow'', provides augmentation for [[Oliver Queen (Arrow)|Green Arrow]] ([[Stephen Amell]]), [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|the Atom]] ([[Brandon Routh]]) and [[Black Canary]] ([[Katie Cassidy]]) as well. Cisco is fond of inventing colorful names for the villains Barry's team comes across, giving them their supervillain monikers from the comics. In season one, Cisco like the others learns that their beloved mentor Harrison Wells ([[Tom Cavanagh]]) is really the murderous [[Reverse-Flash]], [[Professor Zoom|Eobard Thawne]]; Cisco's curiosity and cunning intelligence is instrumental in exposing this, including in an averted timeline in which he is killed for his discovery. It is later revealed that Cisco was also affected by the particle accelerator blast, and that as a result he can detect and remember alternate timelines. Thawne hints that Cisco may have other abilities and that he is at the beginning of a "great adventure". In season 2, it is shown the Cisco can see where the metahumans of Earth-2 are with his powers, allowing him to inform Barry of their location. He keeps it hidden for a little bit, dreading that the powers could make him like Wells, but the Earth-2 Wells reveals Cisco's secret to the team (which Cisco claims he was planning to reveal anyway). Afterwards, Barry and Caitlin follow Cisco's tradition and nickname him "Vibe" based on his visions.<ref>{{cite web|last=Webb |first=Matt |url=http://tvline.com/2015/04/24/castle-season-7-finale-spoilers-rick-kate/ |title=‘Castle’ Season 7 Finale Spoilers — Beckett’s Big Decision |publisher=TVLine |date=2015-04-24 |accessdate=2015-05-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Beedle |first=Tim |url=http://www.dccomics.com/blog/2014/10/01/meet-cisco-ramon-an-interview-with-the-flashs-carlos-valdes |title=Meet Cisco Ramon: An Interview with The Flash's Carlos Valdes |publisher=DC Comics |date=2014-10-01 |accessdate=2015-05-23}}</ref>
