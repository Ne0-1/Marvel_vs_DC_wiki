'''Vibe''' (real name '''Paco Ramone''' or '''Francisco "Cisco" Ramon''') is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in comic books  published by [[DC Comics]].

==Publication history==
Vibe first appearance was in ''[[Justice League|Justice League of America Annual]]'' #2 (October 1984),<ref name="GCD" /> and he was created by [[Gerry Conway]] and [[Chuck Patton]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Manning|first= Matthew K.|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1980s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 209 |quote = The prestigious Justice League of America got a bit easier to join, thanks to writer Gerry Conway and artist Chuck Ryan Patton. Marking the debut of camouflaging hero Gypsy, the shockwave-casting Vibe, and the second generation hero Steel, this landmark comic saw many of the more famous League members step down in order to make way for a younger roster to carry on their legacy.}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Paco Ramone or Francisco "Cisco" Ramon's career as Vibe began shortly after [[Aquaman]] disbanded the original [[Justice League]]. When young Cisco heard that a  [[Justice League Detroit|new Justice League]] was forming in his own hometown of Detroit, he decided to give up his position as the leader of a local street gang, Los Lobos, to join.<ref name="GCD" /> What made Ramon a candidate was his [[metahuman]] ability to emit powerful vibratory shock waves.

Vibe's presence on the team caused Aquaman and the [[Martian Manhunter]] to harbor some strong doubts about the new JLA, particularly after he got the League involved in a rumble with a rival gang.<ref>''Justice League of America'' #233 (December 1984)</ref> Vibe soon proved his mettle during the League's battles against [[Cadre (comics)|Cadre]],<ref>''Justice League of America'' #233-236 (December 1984-February 1985). DC Comics</ref> Anton Allegro<ref>''Justice League of America'' #237-239 (July–September 1985). DC Comics</ref> and [[Amazo]].<ref>''Justice League of America'' #241-243 (August–October 1985). DC Comics</ref> He stayed with the League through the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' crossover, when his powers played a vital role in defeating Despero.<ref>''Justice League of America'' #254 (September 1986). DC Comics</ref>

During Darkseid's assault on Earth during the ''[[Legends (comics)|Legends]]'' mini-series, the Justice League of America was disbanded and Paco left his JLA comrades to seek the familiar solace of the streets. Vibe was attacked by one of [[Professor Ivo]]'s androids, and  became the first Justice League member to be killed in the line of duty.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer =  | Penciller = [[Luke McDonnell|McDonnell, Luke]] | Inker = [[Bob Smith (comics)|Smith, Bob]] | Story = [[J.

One of Vibe's younger brothers, Armando, developed a similar set of vibratory powers and joined [[Booster Gold]]'s team of heroes, the  [[The Conglomerate (comics)|Conglomerate]], using the codenames Reverb and later Hardline.<ref>''Justice League Quarterly'' #1 (Winter 1990)</ref> He has since been depicted as the owner of a dance club named Reverb in the Little Tachyon section of Old Town Metropolis.<ref>''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman Annual]]'' #14. DC Comics</ref>

In the ''[[Trinity (comic book)|Trinity]]'' maxi-series, reality is altered, and a living Cisco is shown as a member of The League, an underground version of the Justice League.<ref>''Trinity'' #25 (November 2008). DC Comics</ref> Soon after [[Superman]], [[Batman]] and [[Wonder Woman]] return, his head is disintegrated by an energy blast, killing him again.

===Blackest Night===
In a ''Justice League of America'' tie-in to the "[[Blackest Night]]" storyline, Vibe was reanimated as a member of the [[Black Lantern Corps]], rising from his coffin in the [[Hall of Justice (comics)|Hall of Justice]].<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #39 (November 2009)</ref> Alongside the Black Lantern [[Commander Steel|Steel]], Vibe attacked his former teammates, [[Gypsy (comics)|Gypsy]] and [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]], until [[Doctor Light (Kimiyo Hoshi)|Doctor Light]] destroyed him.<ref>''Justice League of America'' (Vol. 2) #40 (December 2009). DC Comics</ref>

===The New 52===
In DC's [[Free Comic Book Day]] 2012 sample during ''[[The New 52]]'', a gatefold revealed various characters who will make an appearance in ''Justice League'' over the coming year, one of which is Vibe. [[Geoff Johns]] revealed that Vibe's return would be explored in greater detail in the third story arc of ''Justice League''.<ref>{{cite news| last= Truitt |first= Brian |date= 4 May 2012 |url= http://www.usatoday.com/life/comics/story/2012-05-05/DC-Comics-Free-Comic-Book-Day-issue/54730640/1 |title= Geoff Johns gives out good vibes for Free Comic Book Day |newspaper= [[USA Today]]}}</ref> On August 26, 2012, DC announced a new ''Justice League of America'' title which would feature Vibe.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mullin |first=Pamela |url=http://www.dccomics.com/blog/2012/08/26/dc-entertainment-announces-justice-league-of-america |title=DC Entertainment Announces JUSTICE LEAGUE OF AMERICA &#124; DC |publisher=Dccomics.com |date=2012-08-26 |accessdate=2016-05-24}}</ref> On November 5, 2012, DC announced that Vibe would star in his own ongoing monthly title.<ref>{{cite web|author=mtv |url=http://geek-news.mtv.com/2012/11/05/justice-league-of-america-52-variant-covers/ |title=EXCLUSIVE!: ‘Justice League of America’ #1 Triumphs with 52 State Variants, Plus More News - MTV |publisher=Geek-news.mtv.com |date=2012-11-05 |accessdate=2016-05-24}}</ref> It was written by [[Andrew Kreisberg]] and drawn by [[Pete Woods]] and debuted in February 2013.<ref>{{cite news|last= Zalben |first= Alex |date=5 November 2012| url= http://geek-news.mtv.com/2012/11/05/andrew-kreisberg-vibe/ |title= EXCLUSIVE!

''Justice League of America's Vibe'' lasted for ten issues, with the final issue released on December 18, 2013.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=48521 | title= 'Superman Unchained' Skips January; 'Vibe,' 'Katana' Ending | publisher= Comic Book Resources | date= 15 October 2013| accessdate= 11 May 2014}}</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Vibe's powers revolve around [[vibration]], [[frequency]] and [[resonance]]; Vibe's powers enabled him to create shock waves of considerable strength that could shatter concrete or steel. His powers can affect the physical world as [[seismic]] [[vibration]] (and even [[List of superhuman features and abilities in fiction#Elemental and environmental powers|Terrakinesis]]), or the fabric of [[spacetime]] ([[interdimensional doorway|interdimensional]], [[transdimensional]] and [[extradimensional]] portals).  

Vibe's reintroduction in 2013 redefined his powers as having to do with inter-dimensional physics. Vibe's waves have the power to disrupt the [[Speed Force]], making him one of the few characters who poses a serious threat to [[Flash (comics)|the Flash]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]] | story=Trinity War, Part Two |title= Justice League of America |issue= 6 |date= 2013}}</ref> For this reason, he is recruited into the JLA by [[Steve Trevor]], which exists to guard against the threat of the main Justice League going rogue.<ref name=JLA1>Johns, Geoff. ''Justice League of America'' #1 (2013)</ref> 

[[Amanda Waller]] says that "Cisco Ramon might be one of the most powerful super-humans on the planet. He wields vibrational powers that could in theory shake the Earth apart. And he's the only person we know of who can find and track inter-dimensional breaches."<ref>Gates, Sterling. ''Justice League of America's Vibe'' #3 (2013)</ref> He is also undetectable by security cameras.<ref name=JLA1 />

In the 2014 [[The Flash (2014 TV series)|"The Flash" TV series]], Vibe's powers first manifested as [[Precognition|precognitive]]/[[Retrocognition|retrocognitive]] [[visionary|visions]] [[Psychometry (paranormal)|brought-on by touch]] or by a strong-enough [[Law of contagion|imprint]], initially, before the developed further, such as focused waves of concussive, vibrational force, to inter/extradimensional breaches.  

In addition, his agility is above average (and he was a superb [[breakdancing|breakdancer]]). Under Batman's secret tutelage, Vibe became a more skilled combatant.{{citation needed|date= May 2014}}

==In other media==

===Television===
* Vibe made several non-voiced appearances in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''. He was often seen next to other members of the Detroit League, but he did not get a major role in any episode. His most prominent action is helping rescue New Mexico city's civilians in the episode "Flashpoint". He is also shown with fellow Detroit-era members Vixen, Steel and Gypsy in the final "curtain call" of the series finale "Destroyer".
* Vibe made an appearance in his 2-part DC Nation cartoon short called "Enter Extremo", voiced by [[Carlos Alazraqui]].
[[File:Cisco Ramon (Carlo Valdes).jpg|150px|thumbnail|right|[[Carlos Valdes (actor)|Carlos Valdes]] as Cisco Ramon on the CW series ''The Flash''.]]
* [[Carlos Valdes (actor)|Carlos Valdes]] portrays Cisco Ramon / Vibe in the [[Arrowverse]] across The CW's ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'', ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'' and ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/18/arrow-crossover-100-episode-spoilers?iid=sr-link4|title=''Arrow'' boss teases 100th episode, crossover catalyst|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|last=Abrams|first=Natalie|date=October 18, 2016}}</ref> He debuted in guest appearances on ''Arrow'' and is a series regular on ''The Flash''. In season one, he and [[Killer Frost|Dr. Caitlin Snow]] are part of the [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] team which supports [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] as he saves lives and fights crime as the Flash, and eventually becomes good friends with Barry. A talented engineer and creative mind, Cisco builds much of the Flash's equipment and is fond of assigning colorful nicknames to criminal metahumans. Although Cisco initially appears unaffected by the particle accelerator blast which was behind the Flash's powers, he begins having visions of people in other timelines and thus is a [[metahuman]]; Cisco's ability is what helps the team to discover that [[Eobard Thawne|Dr. Harrison Wells]] is actually the Reverse-Flash. In season two, Cisco takes the nickname "Vibe" after embracing his metahuman status. He eventually learns to call upon his powers to a greater degree while the team faces off against the Earth-2 supervillain [[Hunter Zolomon|Zoom]], and discovers from his own Earth-2 doppelganger, '''Reverb''', that he has the latent power to open dimensional portals and emit powerful destructive blasts. He develops these abilities himself in later episodes, but to a limited degree. In season three, his relationship with Barry is temporally  strained after Barry's changes to the timeline lead to his brother Dante's death. But after he changes history during the [[Dominators]] invasion, he reaizes that Barry made the exact mistake and reconciles with him. He also grows more confident in using his powers offensively against villains such as the [[Reverse-Flash#Edward Clariss|Rival]], to trigger visions, and in order to open up portals across Central City and to other worlds.

===Film===
* Vibe's Earth-3 counterpart Breakdance is shown in the movie ''[[Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths]]'', voiced by [[Carlos Alazraqui]]. He is a member of the [[Crime Syndicate of America]] and first appears as part of Owlman's clean-up crew. Breakdance is shown with the other evil counterparts of the Detroit-era Justice League, including Gypsy Woman and Vamp.

===Video games===
* Vibe appears as playable character in ''[[Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham]]'', voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]].

===Web series===
* Cisco Ramon appears in the animated web series: ''[[Vixen (web series)|Vixen]]'', voiced by [[Carlos Valdes (actor)|Carlos Valdes]]. In episode 3, Cisco has been running a modified facial recognition algorithm created by [[Felicity Smoak]] at S.T.A.R. Labs in an attempt to locate [[Metahuman|Meta-humans]] outside [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]]. The software picks up Mari's encounter with the thugs from episode 1, and Cisco alerts a distracted Barry Allen attempting to locate a missing USB drive containing crime scene statistics. Cisco gives Mari the name [[Vixen (comics)|"Vixen"]], and tells Barry that she's currently in Detroit before asking him to check out the situation.
* Vibe is one of the background students in the web series ''[[DC Super Hero Girls]]''.
