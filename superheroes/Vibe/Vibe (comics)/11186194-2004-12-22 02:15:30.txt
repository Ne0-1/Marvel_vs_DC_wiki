'''Vibe''' was a [[superhero]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]]. He was a former [[Puerto Rican]] gang leader who had the power to produce sound waves. He was introduced as a new member of the [[Justice League]] during the "Justice League Detroit" era. The character was considered to be a stereotype and, like the rest of the new "Detroit League" characters, was massively unpopular.  He was soon killed off by [[Professor Ivo]].     Actually, I don't think Vibe was massively unpopular, I think the editors wanted the book go in a different direction. (It might be possible that Gerry Conway who wrote the first issues of the JLA Detroit stories had moved on to other projects.) I think some people started to warm up to the Justice League Detroit era before it ended. Also Vixen was part of the league at the same time and later she was a member of the Suicide Squad.
