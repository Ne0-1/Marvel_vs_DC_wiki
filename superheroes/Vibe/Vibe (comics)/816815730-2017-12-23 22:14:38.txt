'''Vibe''' (real name '''Paco Ramone''' or '''Francisco''' "'''Cisco'''" '''Ramon''') is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic books]] published by [[DC Comics]].

==Publication history==
Vibe first appearance was in ''[[Justice League|Justice League of America Annual]]'' #2 (October 1984),<ref name="GCD" /> and he was created by [[Gerry Conway]] and [[Chuck Patton]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Manning|first= Matthew K.|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1980s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 209 |quote = The prestigious Justice League of America got a bit easier to join, thanks to writer Gerry Conway and artist Chuck Ryan Patton. Marking the debut of camouflaging hero Gypsy, the shockwave-casting Vibe, and the second generation hero Steel, this landmark comic saw many of the more famous League members step down in order to make way for a younger roster to carry on their legacy.}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Paco Ramone began his career as Vibe shortly after [[Aquaman]] disbanded the original [[Justice League]]. When young Cisco heard that a  [[Justice League Detroit|new Justice League]] was forming in his own hometown of Detroit, he decided to give up his position as the leader of a local street gang, Los Lobos, to join.<ref name="GCD" /> What made Ramon a candidate was his [[metahuman]] ability to emit powerful vibratory shock waves.

Vibe's presence on the team caused Aquaman and the [[Martian Manhunter]] to harbor some strong doubts about the new JLA, particularly after he got the League involved in a rumble with a rival gang.<ref>''Justice League of America'' #233 (December 1984)</ref> Vibe soon proved his mettle during the League's battles against [[Cadre (comics)|Cadre]],<ref>''Justice League of America'' #233-236 (December 1984-February 1985). DC Comics</ref> Anton Allegro<ref>''Justice League of America'' #237-239 (July–September 1985). DC Comics</ref> and [[Amazo]].<ref>''Justice League of America'' #241-243 (August–October 1985). DC Comics</ref> He stayed with the League through the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' crossover, when his powers played a vital role in defeating Despero.<ref>''Justice League of America'' #254 (September 1986). DC Comics</ref>

During Darkseid's assault on Earth during the ''[[Legends (comics)|Legends]]'' mini-series, the Justice League of America was disbanded and Paco left his JLA comrades to seek the familiar solace of the streets. Vibe was attacked by one of [[Professor Ivo]]'s androids, and  became the first Justice League member to be killed in the line of duty.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer =  | Penciller = [[Luke McDonnell|McDonnell, Luke]] | Inker = [[Bob Smith (comics)|Smith, Bob]] | Story = [[J.

One of Vibe's brothers, [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Armando Ramon|Armando Ramon]], developed a similar set of vibratory powers. 

In the ''[[Trinity (comic book)|Trinity]]'' maxi-series, reality is altered, and a living Cisco is shown as a member of The League, an underground version of the Justice League.<ref>''Trinity'' #25 (November 2008). DC Comics</ref> Soon after [[Superman]], [[Batman]] and [[Wonder Woman]] return, his head is disintegrated by an energy blast, killing him again.

In a ''Justice League of America'' tie-in to the "[[Blackest Night]]" storyline, Vibe was reanimated as a member of the [[Black Lantern Corps]], rising from his coffin in the [[Hall of Justice (comics)|Hall of Justice]].<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #39 (November 2009)</ref> Alongside the Black Lantern [[Commander Steel|Steel]], Vibe attacked his former teammates, [[Gypsy (comics)|Gypsy]] and [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]], until [[Doctor Light (Kimiyo Hoshi)|Doctor Light]] destroyed him.<ref>''Justice League of America'' (Vol. 2) #40 (December 2009).

===The New 52===
In DC's [[Free Comic Book Day]] 2012 sample during ''[[The New 52]]'', a gatefold revealed various characters who will make an appearance in ''Justice League'' over the coming year, one of which is Vibe. [[Geoff Johns]] revealed that Vibe's return would be explored in greater detail in the third story arc of ''Justice League''.<ref>{{cite news| last= Truitt |first= Brian |date= 4 May 2012 |url= https://www.usatoday.com/life/comics/story/2012-05-05/DC-Comics-Free-Comic-Book-Day-issue/54730640/1 |title= Geoff Johns gives out good vibes for Free Comic Book Day |newspaper= [[USA Today]]}}</ref> On August 26, 2012, DC announced a new ''Justice League of America'' title which would feature Vibe.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mullin |first=Pamela |url=http://www.dccomics.com/blog/2012/08/26/dc-entertainment-announces-justice-league-of-america |title=DC Entertainment Announces JUSTICE LEAGUE OF AMERICA &#124; DC |publisher=Dccomics.com |date=2012-08-26 |accessdate=2016-05-24}}</ref> On November 5, 2012, DC announced that Vibe would star in his own ongoing monthly title.<ref>{{cite web |author=mtv |url=http://geek-news.mtv.com/2012/11/05/justice-league-of-america-52-variant-covers/ |title=EXCLUSIVE!: ‘Justice League of America’ #1 Triumphs with 52 State Variants, Plus More News - MTV |publisher=Geek-news.mtv.com |date=2012-11-05 |accessdate=2016-05-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524163843/http://geek-news.mtv.com/2012/11/05/justice-league-of-america-52-variant-covers/ |archivedate=2013-05-24 |df= }}</ref> It was written by [[Andrew Kreisberg]] and drawn by [[Pete Woods]] and debuted in February 2013.<ref>{{cite news|last= Zalben |first= Alex |date=5 November 2012| url= http://geek-news.mtv.com/2012/11/05/andrew-kreisberg-vibe/ |title= EXCLUSIVE!

''Justice League of America's Vibe'' lasted for ten issues, with the final issue released on December 18, 2013.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=48521 | title= 'Superman Unchained' Skips January; 'Vibe,' 'Katana' Ending | publisher= Comic Book Resources | date= 15 October 2013| accessdate= 11 May 2014}}</ref>

Another of Vibe's brothers, [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Dante Ramon|Dante Ramon]], is seen in ''The New 52''.

==Powers and abilities==
Vibe's powers revolve around [[vibration]], [[frequency]] and [[resonance]]; Vibe's powers enabled him to create shock waves of considerable strength that could shatter concrete or steel. His powers can affect the physical world as [[seismic]] [[vibration]] (and even [[List of superhuman features and abilities in fiction#Elemental and environmental powers|Terrakinesis]]), or the fabric of [[spacetime]] ([[interdimensional doorway|interdimensional]], [[transdimensional]] and [[extradimensional]] portals).

Vibe's reintroduction in 2013 redefined his powers as having to do with inter-dimensional physics. Vibe's waves have the power to disrupt the [[Speed Force]], making him one of the few characters who poses a serious threat to [[Flash (comics)|the Flash]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]] | story=Trinity War, Part Two |title= Justice League of America |issue= 6 |date= 2013}}</ref> For this reason, he is recruited into the JLA by [[Steve Trevor]], which exists to guard against the threat of the main Justice League going rogue.<ref name=JLA1>Johns, Geoff. ''Justice League of America'' #1 (2013)</ref>

[[Amanda Waller]] says that "Cisco Ramon might be one of the most powerful super-humans on the planet. He wields vibrational powers that could in theory shake the Earth apart. And he's the only person we know of who can find and track inter-dimensional breaches."<ref>Gates, Sterling. ''Justice League of America's Vibe'' #3 (2013)</ref> He is also undetectable by security cameras.<ref name=JLA1 />

In ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' 2014 series, Vibe's powers first manifested as [[Precognition|precognitive]]/[[Retrocognition|retrocognitive]] [[visionary|visions]] [[Psychometry (paranormal)|brought-on by touch]] or by a strong-enough [[Law of contagion|imprint]], initially, before the developed further, such as focused waves of concussive, vibrational force, to inter/extradimensional breaches.

In addition, his agility is above average (and he was a super [[breakdancing|breakdancer]]). Under Batman's secret tutelage, Vibe became a more skilled combatant.

==In other media==

===Television===
* Vibe made several non-voiced appearances in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''. This version was often seen next to the Detroit League's other members but did not get a major role in any episode. His most prominent action is in the episode "Flashpoint" helping rescue New Mexico's civilians in the aftermath of the [[Project Cadmus|Cadmus]] facility's destruction. He is also shown with fellow Detroit-era members [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]], [[Steel (John Henry Irons)|Steel]] and [[Gypsy (comics)|Gypsy]] in the final 'curtain call' of the series finale "Destroyer".
* Vibe made an appearance in his 2-part DC Nation cartoon short "Enter Extremo", voiced by [[Carlos Alazraqui]].
[[File:Cisco Ramon (Carlo Valdes).jpg|150px|thumbnail|right|[[Carlos Valdes (actor)|Carlos Valdes]] as Cisco Ramon on the CW series ''The Flash''.]]
* [[Carlos Valdes (actor)|Carlos Valdes]] portrays Cisco Ramon/Vibe in [[The CW]]'s ''[[Arrowverse]]'', being a series regular on ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]''. This version of the character is a mechanical engineering genius at [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] with known metahuman powers to detect anomalies within reality and sonic manipulation. He is a part of Team Flash alongside [[Killer Frost|Caitlin Snow]] and [[Harrison Wells]] which support [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] saving lives and fighting crime as the Flash. A talented engineer and creative mind, Cisco builds much of the Flash's equipment and is fond of assigning colorful nicknames to criminal metahumans. He has also has a rocky relationship with his brother [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Dante Ramon|Dante Ramon]]. In season one, he becomes good friends with Barry. Although Cisco initially appears unaffected by the particle accelerator blast which was behind the Flash's and many others' powers, he begins having visions of people in other timelines and thus is a [[Metahuman|metahuman]]; Cisco's ability is what helps the team to discover that Wells is actually the [[Eobard Thawne|Reverse-Flash]]. In season two, Cisco takes the "Vibe" nickname after embracing his metahuman status. He eventually learns to call upon his powers to a greater degree while the team faces off against the Earth-2 supervillain [[Hunter Zolomon|Zoom]], and discovers from his own Earth-2 doppelganger [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Armando Ramon|Reverb]] that he has the latent power to open dimensional portals and emit powerful destructive blasts. He develops these abilities himself thanks to Harry Wells but to a limited degree. In season three, his relationship with Barry is temporarily strained after Barry's [[Flashpoint (comics)|timeline changes]] lead to Dante's death. But after he changes history during the [[Dominators]] invasion, he realizes that Barry made the exact mistake and reconciles. He also grows more confident in using his powers offensively, to trigger visions, and to open up portals across Central City and to other worlds. As Vibe, he used his powers offensively against opponents (such as the [[Reverse-Flash#Edward Clariss|Rival]] to help Barry, Gypsy to save H.R. Wells from execution, and finally Killer Frost due to [[Savitar (comics)|Savitar]]). Cisco has also made appearances on each of the other "Arrowverse" shows (''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'', ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'' and ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'').

===Film===
* Vibe's Earth-3 counterpart Breakdance is shown in the movie ''[[Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths]]'', voiced by [[Carlos Alazraqui]]. He is a member of the [[Crime Syndicate of America]] and first appears as part of Owlman's clean-up crew. Breakdance is shown with the other evil counterparts of the Detroit-era Justice League, including Fortuneteller and Vamp.

===Video games===

Labs in an attempt to locate [[Metahuman|Meta-humans]] outside [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]]. The software picks up Mari McCabe's encounter with the thugs from episode 1, and Cisco alerts a distracted Barry Allen attempting to locate a missing USB drive containing crime scene statistics. Cisco gives Mari the name [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]], and tells Barry that she's currently in Detroit before asking him to check out the situation.
* Cisco Ramon is the main character in the web series ''Chronicles of Cisco'', reprised by [[Carlos Valdes (actor)|Carlos Valdes]], which details Cisco Ramon being alone at [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] at night, where he encounters an intruder, [[Peek-a-Boo (comics)|Peek-a-Boo]].
