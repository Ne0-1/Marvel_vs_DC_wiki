==Fictional character biography==
===Paco Ramone===
Paco Ramone's career as Vibe began shortly after [[Aquaman]] disbanded the original [[Justice League]]. When young Paco heard that a  [[Justice League#Detroit|new Justice League]] was forming in his own hometown of Detroit, he decided to give up his position as the leader of a local street gang, Los Lobos, to join up.<ref name="GCD"/> What made Ramone a candidate was his [[metahuman]] ability to emit powerful vibratory shock waves. 

Vibe's presence on the team caused Aquaman and the [[Martian Manhunter]] to harbor some strong doubts about the new JLA, particularly after he got the League involved in a rumble with a rival gang.<ref>''Justice League of America'' #233 (December 1984)</ref> However, Vibe soon proved his mettle during the League's battles against [[Cadre (comics)|Cadre]],<ref>''Justice League of America'' #233-236 (December 1984-February 1985)</ref> Anton Allegro,<ref>''Justice League of America'' #237-239 (July-September 1985)</ref> and [[Amazo]].<ref>''Justice League of America'' #241-243 (August-October 1985)</ref> He stayed with the League through the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' crossover, when his powers played a vital role in defeating Despero.<ref>''Justice League of America'' #254 (September 1986)</ref>

During Darkseid's assault on Earth during the ''[[Legends (comics)|Legends]]'' mini-series, the Justice League of America was disbanded and Paco left his JLA comrades to seek the familiar solace of the streets. Vibe was attacked by one of [[Professor Ivo]]'s androids, and  became the first Justice League member to be killed in the line of duty.<ref>{{Cite comic

In an ''Justice League of America'' tie-in to the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' crossover, Vibe was reanimated as a member of the [[Black Lantern Corps]], rising from his coffin in the [[Hall of Justice (comics)|Hall of Justice]].<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #39 (November 2009)</ref> Alongside the Black Lantern [[Commander Steel|Steel]], Vibe attacked his former teammates, [[Gypsy (comics)|Gypsy]] and [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]], until the current [[Doctor Light (Kimiyo Hoshi)|Doctor Light]] destroyed him.<ref>''Justice League of America'' (Vol. 2) #40 (December 2009)</ref>
