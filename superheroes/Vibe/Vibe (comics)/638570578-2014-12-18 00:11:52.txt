'''Vibe''' is the alter ego of '''Francisco "Paco" Ramon''', a [[fictional character]] and [[comic book]] [[superhero]] published by [[DC Comics]]. He first appeared in ''[[Justice League|Justice League of America Annual]]'' #2 (October 1984),<ref name="GCD"/> and was created by [[Gerry Conway]] and [[Chuck Patton]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Manning|first= Matthew K.|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1980s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 209 |quote = The prestigious Justice League of America got a bit easier to join, thanks to writer Gerry Conway and artist Chuck Patton. Marking the debut of camouflaging hero Gypsy, the shockwave-casting Vibe, and the second generation hero Steel, this landmark comic saw many of the more famous League members step down in order to make way for a younger roster to carry on their legacy.}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Paco Ramon's career as Vibe began shortly after [[Aquaman]] disbanded the original [[Justice League]]. When young Paco heard that a  [[Justice League#Detroit|new Justice League]] was forming in his own hometown of Detroit, he decided to give up his position as the leader of a local street gang, Los Lobos, to join up.<ref name="GCD"/> What made Ramon a candidate was his [[metahuman]] ability to emit powerful vibratory shock waves.

Vibe's presence on the team caused Aquaman and the [[Martian Manhunter]] to harbor some strong doubts about the new JLA, particularly after he got the League involved in a rumble with a rival gang.<ref>''Justice League of America'' #233 (December 1984)</ref> However, Vibe soon proved his mettle during the League's battles against [[Cadre (comics)|Cadre]],<ref>''Justice League of America'' #233-236 (December 1984-February 1985)</ref> Anton Allegro,<ref>''Justice League of America'' #237-239 (July–September 1985)</ref> and [[Amazo]].<ref>''Justice League of America'' #241-243 (August–October 1985)</ref> He stayed with the League through the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' crossover, when his powers played a vital role in defeating Despero.<ref>''Justice League of America'' #254 (September 1986)</ref>

During Darkseid's assault on Earth during the ''[[Legends (comics)|Legends]]'' mini-series, the Justice League of America was disbanded and Paco left his JLA comrades to seek the familiar solace of the streets. Vibe was attacked by one of [[Professor Ivo]]'s androids, and  became the first Justice League member to be killed in the line of duty.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer =  | Penciller = [[Luke McDonnell|McDonnell, Luke]] | Inker = [[Bob Smith (comics)|Smith, Bob]] | Story = [[J.

DeMatteis|DeMatteis, J.M.]] | Title = Justice League of America | Issue = 258 | Date = January 1987 | Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> The Martian Manhunter brought Vibe's body back to the League's mountain sanctuary, where Vibe was laid to rest in a [[cryonics|cryogenic]] chamber. However, Paco's dead form has twice been resurrected by evil-doers.<ref>''JLA Annual'' #2 (1998)</ref><ref>''Martian Manhunter'' vol. 2 #12 (November 1999)</ref>

One of Vibe's younger brothers, Armando, developed a similar set of vibratory powers and joined [[Booster Gold]]'s team of heroes, the  [[The Conglomerate (comics)|Conglomerate]], using the code names '''Reverb''' and later '''Hardline'''.<ref>''Justice League Quarterly'' #1 (Winter 1990)</ref> He has since been depicted as the owner of a dance club named Reverb in the Little Tachyon section of Old Town Metropolis.<ref>''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman Annual]]'' #14</ref>

In the ''[[Trinity (comic book)|Trinity]]'' maxi-series, reality is altered, and a living Paco is shown as a member of '''The League''', an underground version of the Justice League.<ref>''Trinity'' #25 (November 2008)</ref> However, soon after [[Superman]], [[Batman]] and [[Wonder Woman]] return, his head is disintegrated by an energy blast, thus killing him again.

In a ''Justice League of America'' tie-in to the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' crossover, Vibe was reanimated as a member of the [[Black Lantern Corps]], rising from his coffin in the [[Hall of Justice (comics)|Hall of Justice]].<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #39 (November 2009)</ref> Alongside the Black Lantern [[Commander Steel|Steel]], Vibe attacked his former teammates, [[Gypsy (comics)|Gypsy]] and [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]], until [[Doctor Light (Kimiyo Hoshi)|Doctor Light]] destroyed him.<ref>''Justice League of America'' (Vol. 2) #40 (December 2009)</ref>

In DC's [[Free Comic Book Day]] 2012 sample during ''[[The New 52]]'', a gatefold revealed various characters who will make an appearance in ''Justice League'' over the coming year, one of which is Vibe. [[Geoff Johns]] revealed that Vibe's return would be explored in greater detail in the third story arc of ''Justice League''.<ref>{{cite news| last= Truitt |first= Brian |date= 4 May 2012 |url= http://www.usatoday.com/life/comics/story/2012-05-05/DC-Comics-Free-Comic-Book-Day-issue/54730640/1 |title= Geoff Johns gives out good vibes for Free Comic Book Day |newspaper= [[USA Today]]}}</ref> On August 26, 2012, DC announced a new ''Justice League of America'' title which would feature Vibe.<ref>Mullin, Pamela (August 26, 2012).

''Justice League of America's Vibe'' lasted for ten issues, with the final issue released on December 18, 2013.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=48521 | title= 'Superman Unchained' Skips January; 'Vibe,' 'Katana' Ending | publisher= Comic Book Resources | date= 15 October 2013| accessdate= 11 May 2014}}</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Vibe's sonic powers enabled him to create shock waves of considerable strength. His power could shatter concrete or steel. His agility was above average (and he was a superb [[breakdancing|breakdancer]]). Under Batman's tutelage, Vibe became a more skilled combatant.{{citation needed|date= May 2014}}

Vibe's reintroduction in 2013 has sought to establish him as a more powerful character. Part of this was redefining his powers as having to do with interdimensional physics. ''Justice League of America'' establishes that Vibe's sonic waves have the power to disrupt the [[Speed Force]], making him one of the few characters in the [[DC Universe]] who poses a serious threat to [[Flash (comics)|the Flash]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]] | story=Trinity War, Part Two |title= Justice League of America |issue= 6 |date= 2013}}</ref> For this reason, he is recruited into the JLA by [[Steve Trevor]], which exists to guard against the threat of the main Justice League going rogue.<ref name=JLA1>Johns, Geoff. ''Justice League of America'' #1 (2013)</ref> In ''Justice League of America's Vibe'' #3, [[Amanda Waller]] says "Cisco Ramon might be one of the most powerful super-humans on the planet. He wields vibrational powers that could in theory shake the Earth apart. And he's the only person we know of who can find and track interdimensional breaches".<ref>Gates, Sterling. ''Justice League of America's Vibe'' #3 (2013)</ref> He is also undetectable by security cameras.<ref name=JLA1/>

==Other versions==
Vibe has a major role in an issue of the ''Justice League Unlimited'' comic book series where he stopped [[Doctor Sivana]]'s plan to rebuild [[Mister Atom]].{{issue|date=February 2013}}

==In other media==
===Television===
====Animated====
* Vibe has made several appearances in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]].'' He was often seen next to other members of the Detroit League, but he did not get a major role in any episode. His most prominent action is helping rescue civilians in the New Mexico city attacked in "Flashpoint". He is shown with fellow Detroit-era members Vixen, Steel and Gypsy in the final "curtain call" of the episode "Destroyer".

* Vibe appears in a series of ''[[DC Nation Shorts]]'' voiced by [[Carlos Alazraqui]]. In a two-part short, he goes up against [[Professor Ivo]]'s breakdancing robot Extremo in a breakdancing contest.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

====Live action====
*Carlos Valdes portrays Cisco Ramon on [[The CW|The CW's]] ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' and ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]''.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://deadline.com/2014/02/the-flash-carlos-valdes-elena-kampouris-odyssey/|title=Carlos Valdes Cast In CW’s ‘The Flash’, Elena Kampouris In NBC’s ‘Odyssey’|first= Nellie|last= Andreeva|publisher=Deadline|date=February 4, 2014|accessdate=February 4, 2014}}</ref> He made his debut in the ''Arrow'' episode "The Man Under the Hood". He and [[Killer Frost|Caitlin Snow]] appear in the Starling City STAR Labs warehouse doing inventory. He and Caitlin are then chased by [[Deathstroke]] through the warehouse. After Cisco and Caitlin find a weapon created by [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Doctor Light]], he uses it on Deathstroke to stun him and evade capture. Felicity Smoak and John Diggle arrive to learn what Deathstroke stole and Felicity reunites with the two as she met them previously. She questions them about the status of [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]], who has been in a coma. Felicity later returns to ask Cisco and Caitlin for help in finding a cure for the serum Mirakuru, that was responsible for Deathstroke gaining super abilities. Cisco is a series regular in The Flash, where he and Caitlin help Barry fight crime by guiding him, Cisco even developing the Flash's costume—originally intended to be donated to fire-fighters before being chosen as the Flash's attire due to its heat-resistant properties preventing it being damaged by friction—although he also unintentionally "creates" Flash's worst enemy [[Captain Cold]], as he developed a gun that can freeze and slow down the air around it, which was subsequently stolen by Leonard Snart (aka Captain Cold), having created it in case Barry went rogue. He also makes up names for all of the metahumans (and Captain Cold). It is currently unknown how or if Cisco will obtain the Vibe moniker or the powers associated with it.

===Film===
* Vibe's Earth-3 counterpart Breakdance is shown in the movie ''[[Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths]]'' voiced by [[Carlos Alazraqui]]. He appears as part of Owlman's clean up crew. He is shown with the other evil counterparts of the Detroit-era Justice league including Gypsy Woman and Vamp (counterparts to Gypsy and Vixen). It is implied that they were J'edd J'arkus Made Men before he died as his New Earth counterpart is the Martian Manhunter who led the Detroit Justice League.

===Video games===
* Vibe appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham]]'', voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]].

==Controversy==
Comics artist [[George Pérez]] took exception to the Vibe character. In a 1985 interview with [[Heidi MacDonald]], he stated, "I have a certain bigotry towards Vibe...I sincerely say he's the one character who turned me off the JLA. If nothing else, every character that was introduced was an ethnic stereotype."<ref>{{cite book|last=MacDonald|first= Heidi|last2=Heintjes|first2=Tom, ed.|chapter= The George Pérez Interview|title = Focus on George Pérez|publisher=[[Fantagraphics Books]] |year=1985 |isbn= 0-930193-09-1 |page= 29 |quote = }} Online version of interview:{{cite web |url= http://www.titanstower.com/source/libntt/focuson.html|title= Focus On George Pérez |first= |last= |date= |work= |publisher= TitansTower.com |archiveurl= |archivedate= |deadurl= |accessdate= |quote=  }}</ref> Perez's dislike of the character was such that in ''[[JLA/Avengers]]'' in which every member of both teams were depicted at least once, Vibe's cameo was merely of his legs as he fell off panel.
