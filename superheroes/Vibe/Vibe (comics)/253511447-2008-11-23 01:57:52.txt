'''Vibe''' was a [[superhero]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]]. He first appeared in ''Justice League of America Annual'' #2 (November 1984).

==Fictional character history==
===Paco Ramone===
Paco Ramone's career as a Justice Leaguer was as short as they come. His career as Vibe began shortly after [[Aquaman]] disbanded the original [[Justice League]]. When young Paco heard that a  [[Justice League#Detroit| new Justice League]] was forming in his own backyard of Detroit, he decided to give up his position as the leader of a local street gang, El Lobos, to join up. <ref>''Justice League of America Annual'' #2</ref> What made Ramone a candidate was  metahuman ability to emit powerful vibratory shockwaves. 

Vibe's presence on the team caused Aquaman and the [[Martian Manhunter]] to harbor some strong doubts about the new JLA, particularly after he got the League involved in a rumble with a rival gang. <ref>''Justice League of America'' #233</ref> However, Vibe soon proved his mettle during the League's battles against [[Cadre (comics)|Cadre]], <ref>Ibid #233-236</ref> Anton Allegro, <ref>Ibid #237-239</ref> and [[Amazo]]. <ref>Ibid #241-243</ref> He stayed with the League through the first great [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]], when his powers played a vital role in defeating Despero. <ref>Ibid #254</ref>

During Darkseid's assault on Earth's [[Legends (comics)|"legends"]], the Justice League of America was disbanded<ref>{{Cite comic

==Other Media==
