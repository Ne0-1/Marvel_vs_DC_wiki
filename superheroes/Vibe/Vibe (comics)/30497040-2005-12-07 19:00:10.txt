'''Vibe''' was a [[superhero]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]]. Born Paco Ramone, he was a former [[Puerto Rican]] gang leader (A member of the Detroit gang "Los Lobos") who had the power to produce sound waves. He was introduced as a new member of the [[Justice League]] during the "Justice League Detroit" era. The character was considered to be a stereotype and, like the rest of the new "Detroit League" characters, was massively unpopular.  He was soon killed off by [[Professor Ivo]].

He has a brother named Armaldo who has the same powers, who has gone by the codenames Reverb and Hardline.
