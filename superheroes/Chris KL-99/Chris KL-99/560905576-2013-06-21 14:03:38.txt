==Publication history==
'The adventures of Chris KL99' first appeared in ''Strange Adventures'' #1 (Aug. 1950). With a slight name change to KL-99 from issue #2 he made eight appearances in the title in total - issues #1-#3, #5, #7, #9 and #11, ending with ''Strange Adventures'' #15 (Dec. 1951), all written by Edmond Hamilton and drawn by Howard Sherman. Since then, a brief appearance in ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' #78 (February 1985), a cameo appearance in ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' #10 (Jan. 1986), and a brief but completely revised origin story in ''[[Secret Origins]]'' #43 (Aug. 1989) have been his only other appearances to date.

==Fictional character biography==
According to his early adventures, Chris KL, the son of Jon ST-94, was born on a spaceship somewhere between Earth and Mars, the first Earth child to be born in outer space, in the 21st century, and was named after Christopher Columbus.<ref name="Green Nebula' 1950">'' 'The Menace of the Green Nebula' '', ''Strange Adventures'' #1 (Aug. 1950)</ref> He became an instant celebrity because of his status as the first child of space, but was kidnapped by aliens on his eighth birthday and not returned for nine years. It turned out that the aliens were a dying race, and chose him to train for some still unknown purpose.They had not meant to kidnap him, but were unable to communicate their wishes to anyone else.<ref>'' 'The Saga of Chris KL-99' '', ''[[Secret Origins]]'' #43 (Aug. 1989)</ref><ref>''This 1980s story changes Chris's motivations completely, although probably not critically affecting the storyline. His attitude to his parents and Earth is one of hatred for their interrupting his learning with the aliens, treating them as hostiles and killing most of what is left of the race. In the original stories he went to Space Academy because he wanted to go to space to find his missing parents, in the revised version he goes into space before Academy and tries to find the surviving aliens. There is theoretically still room to fit in Chris returning to Earth once again, his parents going into space and him going to Space Academy with changed feelings as a result of their vanishing - which would fit with his later history of space exploration with the United Worlds Federation - but this has not been confirmed or negated in any later storyline.''</ref>

After his return, his parents left Earth to find new worlds to colonise on the exploratory spaceship 'The Starfarer', and were not seen again. According to one version of his story, Chris then vowed to go to Space Academy so he could journey to find them when he was older,<ref>but see note  above</ref> and after graduating from Space Academy '99' was appended to his name because of his 99% rating at the Academy,<ref name="Green Nebula' 1950"/> and he later became the greatest space explorer of his day. Another version of Chris's story has him not returning to Earth, but travelling in space to find the last surviving aliens to continue his training with them, appending the KL to his name in honour of the alien race, the K'l, and the 99 in acknowledgement that there were only 98 of the aliens left alive when he was with them.<ref>''[[Secret Origins]]'' #43 (Aug. 1989)</ref> Whatever the correct version, accompanied by Halk, a [[Mars|Martian]] scientist (once Chief Scientist of Mars), Jero, a [[Venus]]ian,<ref name="dc-ency"/> and a pet chameleon dog, Loopy, whose colour changes according to his mood, he discovered many alien worlds (and a sub-atomic universe<ref>'' 'The World Inside The Atom' '', ''Strange Adventures'' #5 (February 1951)</ref>) in his spaceship 'The Pioneer'. In recognition of his work he was given the authority to protect the people of the new worlds he discovered from danger as 'Commissioner for Protection of Planetary Peoples'.<ref name="Green Nebula' 1950"/>

Chris eventually found 'The Starfarer' and his parents' graves on the planet where they had died saving the rest of the crew in a crash.<ref>('' 'The Lost Earthmen' '', ''Strange Adventures'' #7 (April 1951)</ref> Other adventures involved saving the ancient Earth monuments from aliens in need of metal to save their universe,<ref>'' 'The Metal World' '', ''Strange Adventures #3 (Dec. 1950)</ref> and re-discovering a second moon that used to orbit Earth millions of years ago.<ref>'' 'The Missing Moon' '', ''Strange Adventures'' #11, (Aug. 1951)</ref>

He was present during the DC Universe 'Crisis on Infinite Earths', first in his own time to help Superman and [[Forgotten Heroes|The Forgotten Heroes]] defeat [[Forgotten Villains|The Forgotten Villains]] at the start of the Crisis,<ref>'' 'The Triad' '', ''DC Comics Presents #78, (February 1985)</ref> and then towards the end of Crisis to help with powering the time machines critical to saving the universe.<ref>'' 'Death at the Dawn of Time' '', ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' #10 (Jan. 1986)</ref>
