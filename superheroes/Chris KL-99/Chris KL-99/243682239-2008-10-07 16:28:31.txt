==Fictional character biography==
Chris was the first Earth child ever to be born in outer space.  His father named him after the explorer [[Christopher Columbus]].  His parents both went missing on a space mission, and as an adult Christopher matriculated at the "Space Academy" out of a desire that he might find out what happen to them.  Christopher was an outstanding student, and his 99th percentile test scores were appended to his name, rechristened "Chris KL-99".  He searched the galaxy in his starcraft, the ''Pioneer'', for traces of his lost parents.  On his travels, he acquired two constant companions, Halk, a [[Mars|Martian]], and Jero, a [[Venus|Venusian]].<ref name="dc-ency"/>
