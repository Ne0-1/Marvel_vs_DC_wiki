'''Dark Angel''' is a fictional [[DC Comics]] villain who battled [[Wonder Woman]]. She is a wandering spirit who inhabited the body of '''[[Baroness Paula Von Gunther]]''' during [[World War II]]. Recently it was revealed that Dark Angel, was in fact the '''[[Donna Troy]]''' of the pre-''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]]'' [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Earth-Seven|Earth-Seven]], saved from certain death by the [[Anti-Monitor]].

==Fictional character biography==
The bringer of doom known as '''Dark Angel''' has long bedevilled humans foolish enough to summon her. During World War II, [[Baroness Paula Von Gunther]], (pre-''Crisis'', a brilliant Nazi saboteur who eventually became one of Wonder Woman's staunchest allies, who became post-Crisis a Nazi occult mistress), called forth this wandering evil spirit, who then took over Von Gunther's body and attacked [[Queen Hippolyta (comics)|Wonder Woman]] and the [[Justice Society]] with her mythical might.

Hippolyta battled Dark Angel on many occasions, and eventually Dark Angel appeared on [[Themyscira]]. She intended to kidnap Princess Diana, but instead kidnapped her magical double.  She forced the double (who she thought was Diana) to live thousands of lifetimes, each one ending in tragedy.  She hoped the cumulative effect would drive Hippolyta insane. Instead, the double was  able to grow stronger, and finally became an independent entity now known as [[Donna Troy]].

Donna Troy was able to defeat Dark Angel, and at some point Dark Angel separated herself from von Gunther. The Baroness was last seen living among the Amazons.

===Return of Donna Troy===

In the ''Return of Donna Troy'' mini-series, Donna Troy discovered that Dark Angel was in fact her counterpart from [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Catalogued Earths|Earth-Seven]] and was saved from the burning apartment by the [[Anti-Monitor]], who raised her to serve him much as the [[Monitor (comics)|Monitor]] had saved and raised [[Harbinger (DC Comics)|Harbinger]]. When the Multiverse was reconfigured in one single Universe, Dark Angel, who had somehow escaped the compression of every Donna Troy into one single person in the new Earth, sought to kill Donna and make her relive the lives of the other alternate Donnas as a way to avoid the merging and remain the last one standing. When Dark Angel was defeated, Donna became the real sum of every Donna Troy that existed on every Earth, a living key to the lost Multiverse.

===One Year Later===
The continuity-altering effects of ''[[52 (comic book)|52]]'' and ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' resulted in a new [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]].  A new Dark Angel has appeared, although it is not yet known if she is a multiversal counterpart to Donna Troy or if she has a different origin altogether.

A year after the events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Dark Angel appeared as the servant of [[Monitors (comics)|the 52 new Monitors]], each born from the creation of a new Multiverse. She tested [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]] to see if she was indeed the proper persona to exist in the current [[DC Universe]]. After the test Dark Angel told Supergirl that it was her job to prod and provoke questionable entities or anomalies, in order to ensure their veracity in the world. Believing Supergirl to be out of place in the timestream Dark Angel was about to erase Supergirl's existence but was stopped by one of the 52 Monitors before she could do so and was re-assigned to another unknown task. This task is later revealed to be the destruction of the entirety of Earth-48, the [[Forerunner (comics)|Forerunner]] home planet.<ref>''Countdown to Adventure'' #1</ref> She later pursues Donna Troy, [[Kyle Rayner]] and [[Jason Todd]] through the Multiverse (possibly at the Monitors' behest), inquiring to the denizens of the [[Wildstorm Universe]] (Earth-50) as to whether her lookalike had passed through.<ref>''Countdown Presents: The Search for Ray Palmer - Wildstorm'' #1</ref> Dark Angel then appears in ''Countdown to Adventure'' #3, disguised as an [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]] on Earth-33, turning the conjurers against Forerunner when she arrives. She then sheds her disguise and attacks Forerunner, killing the Earth-33 version of [[Starman (comics)|Starman]] before she is defeated. She escapes before Forerunner can finish her.

==Powers and abilities==
Dark Angel has vast powers and is able to perform a variety of feats including mind control, altering her size, teleportation and altering the time stream.
