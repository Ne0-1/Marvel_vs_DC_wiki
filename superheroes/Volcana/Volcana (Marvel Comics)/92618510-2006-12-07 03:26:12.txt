'''Volcana''' is a fictional character featured in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]].

Along with [[Titania (Marvel Comics)|Titania]], Marsha Rosenberg was a normal human resident of Denver who was spirited away to the [[Beyonder|Beyonder's]] "Battleworld" during [[Marvel Comics]] [[Secret Wars]] series. Lusting for power and respect, she agreed to serve [[Doctor Doom]], in exchange for super powers. Doctor Doom had managed to figure out how to operate a machine utilizing alien technology, and used it to grant her the ability to transform into a molten [[lava]] form, and fire powerful [[thermal energy]] blasts, hence her choosing the codename "Volcana". During the series, she developed a relationship with the [[supervillain]] [[Molecule Man]].

Later, during battles with the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]] and [[Klaw]] she found herself able to transform into volcanic rock ([[pumice]]) and [[volcanic ash]] forms. At that time she was briefly reunited with Molecule Man (whom she believed had been irrevocably merged into another "[[cosmic cube]]" along with the Beyonder) and subsequently discovered that he'd secretly "willed" her a portion of his reality-warping power just before his supposed "death". It was this power that gave her the ability to manifest other forms at critical times when she needed them. After regaining his power from her, she saw the darker side of his personality clearly for the first time and terminated their relationship. She is currently living in New York with her friend "Roxy."
