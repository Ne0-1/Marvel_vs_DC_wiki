'''Volcana''' ('''Marsha Rosenberg''') is a fictional character featured in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]] who first appeared in ''Secret Wars'' #3 (July 1984).  She was created by [[Jim Shooter]] and [[Mike Zeck]]

==Fictional character biography==
Marsha Rosenberg was born in [[Denver, Colorado]].  Along with her friend [[Titania (Marvel Comics)|Skeeter]], Marsha was a normal human resident of Denver who was spirited away to the [[Beyonder|Beyonder's]] "Battleworld" during [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Secret Wars]] series. Lusting for power and respect, she and Skeeter agreed to serve [[Doctor Doom]], in exchange for super powers. Doctor Doom had managed to figure out how to operate a machine utilizing alien technology, and used it to grant her the ability to transform into a molten [[lava]] form, and fire powerful [[thermal energy]] blasts, hence her choosing the codename "Volcana". During the series, she developed a relationship with the [[supervillain]] [[Molecule Man]].

Later, during battles with the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]] and [[Klaw]] she found herself able to transform into volcanic rock ([[pumice]]{{Fact|date=May 2008}}) and [[volcanic ash]] forms. At that time she was briefly reunited with Molecule Man (whom she believed had been irrevocably merged into another "[[cosmic cube]]" along with the Beyonder <ref>around Fantastic Four I#319</ref>) and subsequently discovered that he'd secretly "willed" her a portion of his reality-warping power just before his supposed "death"<ref>Fantastic Four Annual#24/3</ref>. It was this power that gave her the ability to manifest other forms at critical times when she needed them. After he had regained his power from her, she saw the darker side of his personality clearly for the first time and terminated their relationship. She is currently living in New York with her friend "Roxy."

==Physical appearance==
In her human form, the 6'5" tall Marsha has long black hair, is often mildly [[obesity|overweight]], usually wears only her [[magenta]]-colored [[swimsuit]] (which is impervious to her volcanic powers) and she is always barefoot. 

When ignited into her Volcana form, she blazes with white-hot intensity, at times setting aflame any surface beneath her.

==In other media==
===Novels===
Volcana appears in the novel ''[[Spider-Man]]/[[X-Men]]: Time's Arrow: The Present'' by [[Tom DeFalco]] and [[Adam-Troy Castro]], in which she is hired by agents of [[Kang the Conqueror]] to fight [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] and the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]]. While she is not normally a mercenary, she needed the money to repair her car.

An [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] version of the character also appears in the book, as a member of a resistance movement against a fascist version of the X-Men.
