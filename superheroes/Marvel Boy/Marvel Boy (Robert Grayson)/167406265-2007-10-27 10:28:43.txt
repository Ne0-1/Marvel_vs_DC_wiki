'''Marvel Boy''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]].

==Publication history==
'''Robert Grayson''' is the 1950s [[Marvel Boy]], debuting in ''Marvel Boy'' #1 (Dec. 1950), from Marvel 1950s forerunner, [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]]. He continued to appear when the series title was changed to ''Astonishing'' with issue #3. Created by writer-[[editing|editor]] [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Russ Heath]], with writer-artist [[Bill Everett]] taking over with issue #2, His final Atlas story was in ''Astonishing'' #7 (Dec. 1951). Grayson would not appear again until his alternate-reality counterpart was featured in Marvel's ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'' Vol. 1, #9 (June 1978). This version of Marvel Boy was revived in new Marvel series released during the first decade of the 21st century but set in the 1950s: ''[[Marvel: The Lost Generation]]'' (2001) and the ''What If''-inspired ''[[Agents of Atlas]]'' (2006).

===The Crusader===
Robert Grayson, purportedly, returned much later as an [[antagonist]] in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #164-165 (Nov.-Dec.1975), having been driven by grief into insanity and calling himself '''The Crusader''' (no relation to [[Black Knight (comics)#The Crusader|the medieval character]] from the Atlas Comics  title ''[[Black Knight (comics)|The Black Knight]]''). When his power bracelets — which writer-editor [[Roy Thomas]] here dubbed "Quantum Bands" — overloaded, he was vaporized.

The 2006 Marvel [[miniseries]] ''[[Agents of Atlas]]'' explained his survival by stating that The Crusader had actually been a different person — a confused and surgically altered [[Uranian (comics)|Uranian]] [[Eternals|Eternal]] who had been using the Quantum Bands as a replacement for Marvel Boy's own power bracelets. This replacement was intended as an unquestioningly loyal servant of the Uranian Eternals, conditioned to obey and to believe he was actually the original Marvel Boy. However, the plan went awry when a disaster destroyed his creators midway through the project, leaving the Crusader in a deranged and delusional state.

==Fictional character biography==
Robert Grayson was born in [[Trenton, New Jersey]], the son of Dr. Horace Grabshield (later Anglicized as Grayson).  Robert's father was a Jewish scientist who fled Earth with his infant son during the rise of [[Nazi Germany]].  The Graysons landed on [[Uranus (planet)|Uranus]], where they were greeted by the native [[Uranian (comics)|Uranian]] [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]].  Robert was given a costume and a pair of powerful energy-band bracelets, and returned to Earth in the 1950's to battle crime.

===Other versions===
The manipulative mastermind [[Thanos]] created a duplicate of Marvel Boy via the [[Infinity Gauntlet]]; this double was later renamed the '''Blue Marvel''' and attempted to become the [[Punisher]]'s sidekick, but was rejected and was later exiled to a limbo dimension.

The [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] [[anthology]] ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'' Vol. 1, #9 (June 1978) showed a world where Marvel Boy was a member of a team of 1950s [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]; this alternate timeline was destroyed in the 1998-2000 [[limited series]] ''[[Avengers Forever]]''.
