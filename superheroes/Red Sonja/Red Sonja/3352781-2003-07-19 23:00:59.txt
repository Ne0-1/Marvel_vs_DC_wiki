'''Red Sonja''' is a [[fantasy]] [[sword and sorcery]] literary character created by [[Robert E. Howard]].  She is a female warrior who wears a very brief [[bikini]]-like costume of [[chainmail]] and who has sworn an oath never to have sex with any man unless he had defeated her in personal combat.

'''The She-Devil with a Sword''' has become the archetypical example of the fantasy literary figure of a fierce and stunningly beautiful female barbarian who typically wears sexy, but impractical skimpy armor.

Howard actually gave her only a passing mention and wrote no stories about her.  The character was actually developed in the ''[[Conan the Barbarian]]'' [[comic books]] by [[Frank Thorne]] for [[Marvel Comics]].  She also appeared in the 1985 film, ''Red Sonja'' with [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as Kalidor (a Conan clone) and [[Brigitte Nielsen]] in the title role.
