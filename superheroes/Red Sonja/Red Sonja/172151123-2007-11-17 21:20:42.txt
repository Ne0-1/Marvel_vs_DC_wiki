'''Red Sonja''', the '''She-Devil with a Sword''', a "warrior woman out of majestic Hyrkania"{{Fact|date=September 2007}}, is a [[fictional character]], a [[low fantasy]] [[sword and sorcery]] heroine created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Barry Windsor-Smith]]. She first appeared in ''[[Conan (comics)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' #23 ([[Marvel Comics]]). The character was loosely based on Red Sonya of Rogatino in [[Robert E. Howard]]'s short story "[[The Shadow of the Vulture]]" (''[[Oriental Stories/The Magic Carpet (magazine)|The Magic Carpet]]'', January 1934), which Roy Thomas rewrote as a Conan story for the Marvel comic. 

The character now appears monthly in her own series, as well as a series of mini-series and one-shots, all published by Dynamite Entertainment. The main Red Sonja series features a wide array of cover artists as well as the regular creative team of writer Michael Avon Oeming and artist Mel Rubi.

Red Sonja has become the archetypical example of the fantasy figure of a fierce and stunningly beautiful female [[barbarian]] who typically wears armor resembling a bikini or lingerie.

==Origin==
[[Image:SonjaMarotoAdams.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Red Sonja as drawn by [[Esteban Maroto]] and [[Neal Adams]] for her first solo story in ''[[Conan (comics)|The Savage Sword of Conan]]'' #1. Colored by [[José Villarrubia]] for ''The Adventures of Red Sonja'' #1.]]

The origin story for Red Sonja, "The Day of the Sword", first appeared in ''[[Kull|Kull and the Barbarians]]'' #3 by [[Roy Thomas]], Doug Moench and [[Howard Chaykin]], and was later redrawn by [[Dick Giordano]] and Terry Austin for ''The Savage Sword of Conan'', issue 78.

In this story, Red Sonja lived with her family in a humble house in the Western Hyrkanian steppes (modern Ukraine/Russia). When she had just turned 17 years old, a group of mercenaries killed her family and burned down their house.  Sonja survived but she had been brutally [[rape]]d by the leader of the group, leaving her in shame.  Answering her cry for revenge, the red [[goddess]] Scathach appeared to her, and instilled in her incredible skill in the handling of swords and other weapons on the condition that she would never lie with a man unless he defeated her in fair combat.

In the current Dynamite comic book series, Sonja's origins are portrayed in "flashbacks" within each issue beginning with issue #8. The goddess makes her first appearance in the new series in issue #12, which also marks the return of the deadly sorcerer [[Kulan Gath]].

==Red Sonja vs. Red Sonya==
Roy Thomas's "Sonja" is very different from Robert E. Howard's original "Sonya". Besides tweaking the spelling of her name, Thomas transformed her from a sword- and pistol-wielding supporting character of the late [[Renaissance]] into a sword-wielding heroine of Conan's prehistoric [[Hyborian Age]].

The first description of Sonya is this:
{{quote|She was tall, splendidly shaped, but lithe. From under a steel cap escaped rebellious tresses that rippled red gold in the sun over her compact shoulders. High boots of Cordovan leather came to her mid-thighs, which were cased in baggy breeches. She wore a shirt of fine Turkish mesh-mail tucked into her breeches. Her supple waist was confined by a flowing sash of green silk, into which were thrust a brace of pistols and a dagger, and from which depended a long Hungarian saber. Over all was carelessly thrown a scarlet cloak.|[[Robert E. Howard]]|[[The Shadow of the Vulture]]}}

Howard's Sonya of Rogatino was the sister of [[Roxelana|Sultana Roxelana]].  Both versions come from the [[Ukraine]] area.

==Bikini==
Most artists depict Red Sonja wearing a very brief [[bikini]]-like costume of [[scale mail]], usually with boots and gauntlets. As originally drawn by [[Barry Windsor-Smith|Barry Smith]] for "The Shadow of the Vulture" and "The Song of Red Sonja" in ''[[Conan the Barbarian]]'' issues 23 and 24 (1973), she did not have as full a figure and dressed a little more conservatively, in a long-sleeved mail shirt and short pants of red silk. 

As told by [[Roy Thomas]] in the introduction of  ''Red Sonja Adventures'' Volume 1 (Dynamite Entertainment) Spanish artist [[Esteban Maroto]] submitted an uncommissioned illustration to him when he was editing the magazine ''Savage Sword of Conan'' where he redesigned the character and for the first time showed her wearing what would become her famous costume, the silver “metal bikini”, which resembled other fantasy costumes that other Maroto heroines sported in the 1970’s. This illustration had been printed for the first time in [[Jim Steranko]]'s magazine ''Comixscene'' #5 in black and white. It was reprinted in ''Savage Sword of Conan'' #1, and in ''Marvel Treasury Edition'' #15 colored but poorly reproduced, and finally restored and colored by [[José Villarrubia]] as an alternate cover for the Dynamite Entertainment edition of ''Red Sonja'' #2. Maroto drew her in this costume for a double page spread illustration in ''[[Savage Tales]]'' #3 and then for her first solo adventure in ''Savage Sword of Conan'' #1, and [[John Buscema]] drew her in this costume in the same magazine. Buscema drew her again in this costume in issues 43, 44 and 48 of  ''[[Conan the Barbarian]]'' (1974) and [[Dick Giordano]] in the first issue of ''[[Marvel Feature]]'' (1975) before [[Frank Thorne]] took over from issue 2 (1976). The "bikini" proved popular, becoming well known through the paintings of [[Boris Vallejo]] and others.

== In other media ==
===Television===
[[Image:Conan the Adventurer.JPG|thumb|Red Sonja (bottom left) as she appears in the TV series, "Conan the Adventurer."|150px]]
Red Sonja makes an appearance on the ''[[Conan the Adventurer (TV series)|Conan]]'' TV series, in the episode, "Red Sonja". She is on a mission to rescue a young wizard who was kidnapped. When one of Conan's partners sarcastically asks why the village didn't send their best warriors, Sonja replies, "They did send their best warrior, mulebrain!" She was played by [[Angelica Bridges]].

===Film===
She was played by [[Brigitte Nielsen]] in the 1985 film ''[[Red Sonja (1985 film)|Red Sonja]]'', which also starred [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as Prince Kalidor (a Conan clone). The film was directed by [[Richard Fleischer]].  It performed poorly at the box office, and was also widely panned by critics.

Avi Lerner and Danny Dimbort's Millennium Films and Randall Emmett and George Furla's Emmett/Furla Films announced they have acquired the rights to produce and distribute a feature film based on the “Red Sonja” property as well as the allied and ancillary rights. The picture will be produced by Randall Emmett, George Furla and Avi Lerner as well as executive produced by M. Dal Walton III, Luke Lieberman, Nick Barrucci, Danny Dimbort, Trevor Short and Boaz Davidson. The property is currently out to writers and directors.

A remake of "Red Sonja" is currently in the works. It is currently in pre-production and very little has been decided on. It is scheduled to be released in 2008.

==Parodies==
{{Original research|date=September 2007}} 
There are two live-action shows of note:
The earliest "Red Sonja and the Wizard" shows were organized by Red Sonja artist, Frank Thorne and together with a bevy of Red Sonja's, they developed a story that they performed at various comic cons in 1977 through 1978.

Today, the newest "Red Sonja and the Wizard" show is in current productions throughout Tennessee and Virginia.  It features young Wendy Potter as Red Sonja and a cast of characters in a dramatic and exciting rendition of the show.{{Fact|date=September 2007}}

The character has been parodied in numerous forms including '''Red Sophia''', a character from [[Dave Sim]]'s black and white, independent comic book, ''[[Cerebus]]''.

Herrena the [[Henna]]-Haired Harridan in the ''[[Discworld]]'' novel ''[[The Light Fantastic]]'' is probably also intended as a Sonja parody. Her introduction makes much of the fact she wears sensible chainmail, rather than "something off the cover of the more advanced kind of lingerie catalogue". In ''[[Eric (novel)|Eric]]'' she is briefly mentioned having a drink with another swordswoman named "Red Scharron".

Beverly Switzler, a character from the Marvel comic book, ''[[Howard the Duck]]'' is featured on the cover of ''Howard the Duck'' (Volume 1) #1 wearing a scale mail bikini similar to the outfit worn by Red Sonja.

Popular [[webcomic]] ''[[The Wotch]]'' features a comic-loving male character named Jason who is regularly transformed into a red-haired female alter ego named Sonja. The Red Sonja reference is made explicit in this<ref>[http://www.thewotch.com/?epDate=2006-10-25 The Wotch]</ref> episode of the comic.

Makri, a part-human, part-elf and part-orc character in the [[Thraxas]] series of novels is probably based on Red Sonja. As well as a very accomplished fighter with a sword or axe, she usually only ever wears a chain-mail bikini, again similar to the outfit worn by Red Sonja.

[[Blatant Comics]]<ref>[http://www.blatantcomics.com/ Blatant Comics]</ref> published ''Dead Sonja: She-Zombie with a Sword'', a collection of three short comics parodying Red Sonja as a [[zombie]].

==Awards==

*1973 Academy of Comic Book Arts Awards: Best Individual Story (Dramatic).  ''The Song of Red Sonja''. Written by [[Roy Thomas]] and pencilled, inked and colored by [[Barry Windsor-Smith|Barry Smith]]. The story first appeared in ''[[Conan the Barbarian]]'' issue 24 (March 1972), where two panels were censored by [[John Romita Sr.]] The uncensored story was reprinted in Marvel Treasury Edition, Volume 1, No. 15, 1977, where it was recolored by [[Glynis Wein]] and the artwork was slightly cropped to fit the page format.

* Red Sonja publisher Dynamite Entertainment was awarded the title of "Best New Publisher" by Diamond Comics Distributors in 2005.

==Legal==
On [[June 6]], [[2006]] comic news site [[Newsarama]] reported that Red Sonja, LLC (which holds rights to the Roy Thomas version of the character) filed a lawsuit on four counts against [[Paradox Entertainment]] (which claims rights to Red Sonya as part of the Howard library, though no renewal record for ''[[The Shadow of the Vulture]]'' exists) in US Federal Court in April 2006. The four counts are claims of copyright infringement, trademark infringement, trademark dilution, and unfair competition.<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/dynamitenew/redsonja/12/SonjaConan.html Newsarama]</ref> The lawsuit was to be heard beginning in July 2007<ref>[http://blog.newsarama.com/2007/07/16/red-sonja-vs-red-sonya-in-court-this-week/]</ref> but was postponed until January 2008. <ref>[http://blog.newsarama.com/2007/07/12/ultimate-wolverine-vs-hulk-the-end-is-near-ish/?p=4602]</ref>
