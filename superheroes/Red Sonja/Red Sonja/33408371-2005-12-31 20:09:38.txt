'''Red Sonja''', "warrior woman out of majestic Hyrkania," is a [[fantasy]] [[sword and sorcery]] heroine created by [[Roy Thomas]] and  [[Barry Windsor-Smith|Barry Smith]] and first appearing in ''[[Conan the Barbarian]]'' #23 ([[Marvel Comics]]). She was loosely based on the character Red Sonya of Rogatino in [[Robert E. Howard]]'s short story "[[The Shadow of the Vulture]]" (''[[The Magic Carpet Magazine]]'', January 1934), which was rewritten as a Conan story for the Marvel comic. 

The ''She-Devil with a Sword'' has become the archetypical example of the fantasy figure of a fierce and stunningly beautiful female barbarian who typically wears sexy, but impractically skimpy armor.

==Origin==

[[Image:RedSonja1.jpg|left|thumb|''Red Sonja'' #1 variant cover by [[Michael Turner]]]]The origin of Red Sonja, "The Day of the Sword", first appeared in ''Kull and the Barbarians'' issue 3 by [[Roy Thomas]], Doug Moench and [[Howard Chaykin]], and was later redrawn by [[Dick Giordano]] and Terry Austin for ''The Savage Sword of Conan'', issue 78.

Red Sonja lived with her family in a humble home in the Western Hyrkanian steppes. When she had just turned 17 years old, a group of cruel mercenaries killed her father Ivor, her mother and two younger brothers and burned their house and all their possessions.  She survived but was raped by the leader of the group.  Answering her cry for revenge, the red goddess Scathach appeared to her, and instilled in her incredible skill in the handling of swords and other weapons on the condition that she would never never lay with a man for the rest of her life, unless he had defeated her in fair battle.

==Howard vs. Marvel==

Howard's Red Sonya was very different from Thomas's: Thomas reinvented her, making her a heroine of Conan's [[Hyborian Age]], tweaking the spelling of her name, and giving her a sword instead of her guns.

She is most often depicted wearing a very brief [[bikini]]-like costume of scale mail. As originally drawn by [[Barry Windsor-Smith|Barry Smith]] for "The Shadow of the Vulture" and "The Song of Red Sonja" in ''[[Conan the Barbarian]]'' issues 23 and 24 (1973), she did not have as full a figure and dressed a little more conservatively, in a chainmail long-sleeved shirt and red cloth (maybe leather) shorts. 

As told by [[Roy Thomas]] in the introduction of  ''Red Sonja Adventures'' Volume 1 (Dynamite Entertainment) Spanish artist [[Esteban Maroto]] submitted an uncommissioned illustration to him when he was editing the magazine ''Savage Sword of Conan'' where he redesigned the character and for the first time showed her wearing what would become her famous costume, the silver “metal bikini”, which resembled other fantasy costumes that other Maroto heroines sported in the 1970’s. This illustration was printed for the first time in black and white in ''Savage Sword of Conan'' #1, was later reprinted in ''Marvel Treasury Edition'' #15 colored but poorly reproduced, and finally restored and colored by [[José Villarrubia]] as an alternate cover for the Dynamite Entertainment edition of ''Red Sonja'' #2. Maroto drew her in this costume for her first solo adventure in ''Savage Sword of Conan'' #1, and [[John Buscema]] drew her in that costume in the same magazine. Buscema drew her again in that costume in issues 43, 44 and 48 of  ''[[Conan the Barbarian]]'' (1974) and [[Dick Giordano]] in the first issue of ''[[Marvel Feature]]'' (1975) before [[Frank Thorne]] took over from issue 2 (1976). For some reason the "bikini" proved popular, becoming well known through the paintings of [[Boris Vallejo]] and others.

The character has been parodied in numerous forms including the [[furry]] comic book series, ''[[Red Shetland]]'' where the title character is a humanoid mare in the archetypical armor [[bikini]].

Another parody of [[Red Sonja]] is realized in the form of '''Red Sophia''', a character from [[Dave Sim]]'s black and white, independent comic book, ''[[Cerebus]]''.
