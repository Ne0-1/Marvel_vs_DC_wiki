'''Red Sonja''', the '''She-Devil with a Sword''', is a [[fictional character]], a [[low fantasy]] [[sword and sorcery]] heroine created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Barry Windsor-Smith]]. She first appeared in ''[[Conan the Barbarian (comic)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' #23 & #24 ([[Marvel Comics]]). 

The character now appears monthly in her own series, as well as a series of mini-series and one-shots, all published by Dynamite Entertainment. The main Red Sonja series features a wide array of cover artists as well as the regular creative team of writer Michael Avon Oeming and artist [[Mel Rubi]].

Red Sonja has become the archetypical example of the fantasy figure of a fierce and stunningly beautiful female [[barbarian]] who typically wears armor resembling a bikini or lingerie.

==Origin==

[[Image:SonjaMarotoAdams.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Red Sonja as drawn by [[Esteban Maroto]] and [[Neal Adams]] for her first solo story in ''[[Conan (comics)|The Savage Sword of Conan]]'' #1. Colored by [[José Villarrubia]] for ''The Adventures of Red Sonja'' #1.]]

The origin story for Red Sonja, "The Day of the Sword", first appeared in ''[[Kull of Atlantis|Kull and the Barbarians]]'' #3 by [[Roy Thomas]], Doug Moench and [[Howard Chaykin]], and was later redrawn by [[Dick Giordano]] and Terry Austin for ''The Savage Sword of Conan'', issue 78.

In this story, Red Sonja lived with her family in a humble house in the Western Hyrkanian steppes (modern Ukraine/Russia). When she had just turned 17 years old, a group of mercenaries killed her family and burned down their house.  Sonja survived but she had been brutally [[rape]]d by the leader of the group, leaving her in shame.  Answering her cry for revenge, the red [[goddess]] Scathach appeared to her, and instilled in her incredible skill in the handling of swords and other weapons on the condition that she would never lie with a man unless he defeated her in fair combat.

In the current Dynamite comic book series, Sonja's origins are portrayed in "flashbacks" within each issue beginning with issue #8. The goddess makes her first appearance in the new series in issue #12, which also marks the return of the deadly sorcerer [[Kulan Gath]].

Later during the series, the original character is killed off in issue #34. Instead, a new character of the same name, described a ''reincarnation'' of the original Sonja, takes her place from issue #35 onward

=== Revamped Sonja ===

In this new continuity, Sonja is described as a distant relative of the original Red Sonja, taking her namesake as a good omen, since Sonja had come to be known as the most beautiful and fearless woman in Hyrkania. A noblewoman, this incarnation lives a fairly sheltered existance, along with her sister Verona and her little niece, longing for a kid on her own and waiting for the return of her distant husband, Lord Daniel.

Eventually she's reunited with her husband, but then a pirate crew, unbeknowst to them called upon by Verona's husband, Lord Lucan, in a bid for more power, slays him and leave Sonja on the brink of death. Sonja is then nursed to health by Osin, in Sonja's previous life a bard companion and now a gruff swordsman, who accepted the curse of [[Claw the Unconquered]] for himself in exchange for the ability to locate, and train the new incarnation of Red Sonja.

Osin begins her training, finding that, even if Sonja has occasionally flashes of her former reflexes, she no longer have access to the full might of the skills bestowed upon her by Scathach (now an almost forgotten goddess with waning powers) in her previous life, nor the fit body she once possessed, due to her sheltered life. Despite these handicaps Sonja is able to learn faster than presumed, but decides to act stealthy, joining Lucan's pirate crew to be closer to Daniel's assassins.

==Prototypes: Red Sonja vs. Red Sonya==

The character was loosely based on Red Sonya of Rogatino in [[Robert E. Howard]]'s short story "[[The Shadow of the Vulture]]" (''[[Oriental Stories/The Magic Carpet (magazine)|The Magic Carpet]]'', January 1934), which Roy Thomas rewrote as a Conan story for Marvel Comics ''Conan the Barbarian'' #23 (1973). Thomas also somewhat based Red Sonja on another Howard character, [[Dark Agnes de Chastillon]], a sword woman in 16th-century France.<ref>Afterword by [[Roy Thomas]], in ''The Chronicles of Conan Volume 4: The Song of Red Sonja and Other Stories'' (Dark Horse, 2004)</ref>

Red Son'''j'''a is somewhat different from Robert E. Howard's original Red Son'''y'''a. Besides tweaking the spelling of her name, Thomas transformed her from a sword- and pistol-wielding supporting character of the late [[Renaissance]] into a sword-wielding heroine of Conan's prehistoric [[Hyborian Age]].

In 2006 Red Sonja LLC brought a lawsuit in Delaware Federal Court against Paradox Entertainment alleging Trademark Infringement and unfair competition.  Paradox claims the rights to 'Red Sonya' [sic] as part of the Howard Library, even though no copyright renewal was filed for the story "Shadow of a Vulture." Red Sonja LLC succeeded in securing settlement in the nature of all of Paradox's rights in the story "Shadow of a Vulture" and Paradox's endorsement of RS LLC's trademark in Red Sonja regardless of spelling.

==Bikini== 

Most artists depict Red Sonja wearing a very brief [[bikini]]-like costume of [[scale mail]], usually with boots and gauntlets. As originally drawn by [[Barry Windsor-Smith|Barry Smith]] for "The Shadow of the Vulture" and "The Song of Red Sonja" in ''[[Conan the Barbarian]]'' issues 23 and 24 (1973), she did not have as full a figure and dressed a little more conservatively, in a long-sleeved mail shirt and short pants of red silk, a style that did not last long. 

As told by [[Roy Thomas]] in the introduction of  ''Red Sonja Adventures'' Volume 1 (Dynamite Entertainment) Spanish artist [[Esteban Maroto]] submitted an uncommissioned illustration to him when he was editing the magazine ''Savage Sword of Conan'' where he redesigned the character and for the first time showed her wearing what would become her famous costume, the silver “metal bikini”, which resembled other fantasy costumes that other Maroto heroines sported in the 1970’s. This illustration had been printed for the first time in [[Jim Steranko]]'s magazine ''Comixscene'' #5 in black and white. It was reprinted in ''Savage Sword of Conan'' #1, and in ''Marvel Treasury Edition'' #15 colored but poorly reproduced, and finally restored and colored by [[José Villarrubia]] as an alternate cover for the Dynamite Entertainment edition of ''Red Sonja'' #2. Maroto drew her in this costume for a double page spread illustration in ''[[Savage Tales]]'' #3 and then for her first solo adventure in ''Savage Sword of Conan'' #1, and [[John Buscema]] drew her in this costume in the same magazine. Buscema drew her again in this costume in issues 43, 44 and 48 of  ''[[Conan the Barbarian]]'' (1974) and [[Dick Giordano]] in the first issue of ''[[Marvel Feature]]'' (1975) before [[Frank Thorne]] took over from issue 2 (1976). The "bikini" proved popular, becoming well known through the paintings of [[Boris Vallejo]] and others.

== In other media ==
===Television===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Conan the Adventurer.JPG|thumb|Red Sonja (bottom left) as she appears in the TV series, "Conan the Adventurer."|150px|{{ifdc|1=Conan the Adventurer.JPG|log=2008 December 25}}]] -->
Red Sonja makes an appearance on the ''[[Conan the Adventurer (TV series)|Conan]]'' TV series, in the episode, "Red Sonja". She is on a mission to rescue a young wizard who was kidnapped. When one of Conan's partners sarcastically asks why the village didn't send their best warriors, Sonja replies, "They did send their best warrior, mulebrain!" She was played by [[Angelica Bridges]].

===Film===
She was played by [[Brigitte Nielsen]] in the 1985 film ''[[Red Sonja (1985 film)|Red Sonja]]'', which also starred [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as Prince Kalidor (originally intended to be Conan). The film was directed by [[Richard Fleischer]].  It performed poorly at the box office, and was also widely panned by critics.{{Fact|date=April 2008}}

Avi Lerner and Danny Dimbort's Millennium Films and Randall Emmett and George Furla's Emmett/Furla Films announced they had acquired the rights to produce and distribute a feature film based on the “Red Sonja” property as well as the allied and ancillary rights. The picture was to be produced by Randall Emmett, George Furla and Avi Lerner as well as executive produced by M. Dal Walton III, Luke Lieberman, Nick Barrucci, Danny Dimbort, Trevor Short and Boaz Davidson. In the past, the property was out to writers and directors.

A [[Red Sonja (2009 film)| new adaptation]] of  ''Red Sonja'' not based on the original film is currently in the works. It is currently in pre-production and very little has been decided on. It will be produced by [[Robert Rodriguez]], directed by Douglas Aarniokoski (with considerable participation of Rodriguez), and actress [[Rose McGowan]] will portray Red Sonja. [[Kulan Gath]] will also play a major role in the movie.  The release date was recently reporteded to be late 2009 with a teaser poster being released which shows Red Sonja with her sword atop of a pile of skulls.  <ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/10010156-red_sonja/pictures/ Red Sonja Pictures - Rotten Tomatoes<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The film is currently being filmed and will be released in theaters in  late 2009 or early 2010.

==Awards==

The four counts are claims of copyright infringement, trademark infringement, trademark dilution, and unfair competition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newsarama.com/dynamitenew/redsonja/12/SonjaConan.html |title=Sonja vs. Conan - Red Sonja, LLC Sues Paradox |accessdate= |work=Newsarama}}</ref> The lawsuit was settled in January 2008, on the second day of the hearing, for a sum of $1 each.
