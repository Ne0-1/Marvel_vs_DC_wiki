'''Red Sonja''', the '''She-Devil with a Sword''', is a [[fictional character]], a [[high fantasy]] [[sword and sorcery]] heroine created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Barry Windsor-Smith]], and loosely based on Red Sonya of Rogatino in [[Robert E. Howard]]'s 1934 short story "[[The Shadow of the Vulture]]". She first appeared in the [[Marvel Comics]] book ''[[Conan the Barbarian (comics)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' #23 (February 1973).

Red Sonja has become the archetypical example of the fantasy figure of a fierce and stunningly beautiful female [[barbarian]] who typically wears armor resembling a bikini or lingerie.

==Origin==
[[Image:SonjaMarotoAdams.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Red Sonja as drawn by [[Esteban Maroto]] and [[Neal Adams]] for her first solo story in ''[[The Savage Sword of Conan]]'' #1. Colored by [[José Villarrubia]] for ''The Adventures of Red Sonja'' #1.]]
The origin story for Red Sonja, "The Day of the Sword", first appeared in ''[[Kull of Atlantis|Kull and the Barbarians]]'' #3 by [[Roy Thomas]], [[Doug Moench]], and [[Howard Chaykin]], and was later redrawn by [[Dick Giordano]] and [[Terry Austin (comics)|Terry Austin]] for ''[[The Savage Sword of Conan]]'', issue 78.

In this story, Red Sonja lived with her family in a humble house in the Western Hyrkanian steppes (this seems to be in modern Ukraine/Russia though historical [[Hyrcania]] was on the borders of modern Iran/Turkmenistan). When she had just turned 17 years old, a group of mercenaries killed her family and burned down their house. Sonja survived but was brutally [[rape]]d by the leader of the group, leaving her in shame. Answering her cry for revenge, the red goddess [[Scáthach]] appeared to her, and instilled in her incredible skill in the handling of swords and other weapons on the condition that she would never lie with a man unless he defeated her in fair combat.

In the current Dynamite comic book series, Sonja's origins are portrayed in "flashbacks" within each issue beginning with issue #8. The goddess makes her first appearance in the new series in issue #12, which also marks the return of the deadly sorcerer [[Kulan Gath]].

Later during the series, the original character is killed off in issue #34. Instead, a new character of the same name, described as a ''reincarnation'' of the original Sonja, takes her place from issue #35 onward.

=== Revamped Sonja ===
{{Unreferenced|section|date=October 2011}}
In this new continuity, Sonja is described as a distant relative of the original Red Sonja, taking her name as a good omen, since Sonja had come to be known as the most beautiful and fearless woman in Hyrkania. A noblewoman, this incarnation lives a fairly sheltered existence, along with her sister Verona and her little niece, longing for a child of her own and waiting for the return of her distant husband, Lord Daniel.

Eventually she is reunited with her husband, but then a pirate crew (unbeknownst to them called upon by Verona's husband, Lord Lucan, in a bid for more power) slays him and leaves Sonja on the brink of death. Sonja is then nursed to health by Osin, in Sonja's previous life a bard companion and now a gruff swordsman, who accepted the curse of [[Claw the Unconquered]] for himself in exchange for the ability to locate, and train the new incarnation of Red Sonja.

Osin begins her training, finding that, even if Sonja has occasional flashes of her former reflexes, she no longer has access to the full might of the skills bestowed upon her by Scathach (now an almost forgotten goddess with waning powers) in her previous life, nor the fit body she once possessed, due to her sheltered life. Despite these handicaps Sonja is able to learn faster than presumed, but decides to act stealthily, joining Lucan's pirate crew to be closer to Daniel's assassins.

==Prototypes: Red Sonja vs. Red Sonya==
The character was loosely based on Red Sonya of Rogatino in [[Robert E. Howard]]'s short story "[[The Shadow of the Vulture]]" (''[[Oriental Stories/The Magic Carpet (magazine)|The Magic Carpet]]'', January 1934), which Roy Thomas rewrote as a Conan story for Marvel Comics ''Conan the Barbarian'' #23 (1973). Thomas also somewhat based Red Sonja on another Howard character, [[Dark Agnes de Chastillon]], a sword woman in 16th-century France.<ref>Afterword by [[Roy Thomas]], in ''The Chronicles of Conan Volume 4: The Song of Red Sonja and Other Stories'' (Dark Horse, 2004)</ref>

Red Sonja is somewhat different from Robert E. Howard's original Red Sonya. Besides tweaking the spelling of her name, Thomas transformed her from a sword- and pistol-wielding supporting character of the late [[Renaissance]] into a sword-wielding heroine of Conan's prehistoric [[Hyborian Age]].

==Bikini==
[[File:10.15.11RedSonjaByLuigiNovi1.jpg|thumb|left|A [[cosplay]]er at the 2011 [[New York Comic Con]] dressed as Red Sonja.]]
Most artists depict Red Sonja wearing a very brief [[bikini]]-like costume of [[scale mail]], usually with boots and [[Gauntlet (glove)|gauntlets]]. As originally drawn by [[Barry Windsor-Smith|Barry Smith]] for "The Shadow of the Vulture" and "The Song of Red Sonja" in ''[[Conan the Barbarian]]'' issues 23 and 24 (1973), she did not have as full a figure and dressed a little more conservatively, in a long-sleeved mail shirt and short pants of red silk, a style that did not last long.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

As told by [[Roy Thomas]] in the introduction of ''Red Sonja Adventures'' Volume 1 (Dynamite Entertainment) Spanish artist [[Esteban Maroto]] submitted an uncommissioned illustration to him when he was editing the magazine ''Savage Sword of Conan'' where he redesigned the character and for the first time showed her wearing what would become her famous costume, the silver "metal bikini", which resembled other fantasy costumes that other Maroto heroines sported in the 1970s. This illustration had been printed for the first time in [[Jim Steranko]]'s magazine ''Comixscene'' #5 in black and white. It was reprinted in ''Savage Sword of Conan'' #1, and in ''Marvel Treasury Edition'' #15 colored but poorly reproduced, and finally restored and colored by [[José Villarrubia]] as an alternative cover for the Dynamite Entertainment edition of ''Red Sonja'' #2. Maroto drew her in this costume for a double page spread illustration in ''[[Savage Tales]]'' #3 and then for her first solo adventure in ''Savage Sword of Conan'' #1, and [[John Buscema]] drew her in this costume in the same magazine. Buscema drew her again in this costume in issues 43, 44 and 48 of  ''[[Conan the Barbarian]]'' (1974) and [[Dick Giordano]] in the first issue of ''[[Marvel Feature]]'' (1975) before [[Frank Thorne]] took over from issue 2 (1976). The "bikini" proved popular, becoming well known through the paintings of [[Boris Vallejo]] and others.
