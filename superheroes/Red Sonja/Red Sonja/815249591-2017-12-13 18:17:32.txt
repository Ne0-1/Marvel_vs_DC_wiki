'''Red Sonja''' is a fictional [[Character (arts)|character]], a [[sword and sorcery|sword-and-sorcery]] [[comic book|comic-book]] heroine created by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and artist [[Barry Windsor Smith]] for Marvel Comics in 1973, partially based on [[Robert E. Howard]]'s own creation 'Red Sonya of Rogatino'  a female [[swashbuckler]] from his 1934 short story "[[The Shadow of the Vulture]]" and to a certain degree also based on Howard's character [[Dark Agnes de Chastillon]].<ref>Afterword by [[Roy Thomas]], in ''The Chronicles of Conan Volume 4: The Song of Red Sonja and Other Stories'' (Dark Horse, 2004)</ref> 

Red Sonja debuted in ''[[Conan the Barbarian (comics)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' #23 ([[cover-date]]d Feb. 1973). Roy Thomas created a new origin story and transposed the timeline from the 16th century of Howard's original Red Sonya, to the [[Hyborian Age]], another Howard creation, in order to have the comic-book Red Sonja interact with [[Conan the Barbarian]]. In 1975 Marvel Comics published the first issue of ''Red Sonja'' after the character headlined ''[[Marvel Feature]]'' for seven issues that same year.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Cassell|first=Dewey|title=Marvel Feature|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=71|page=18|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=April 2014|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref><ref>http://www.redsonja.com/history/</ref>

At the 2013 [[Emerald City Comic Con]], [[Dynamite Entertainment|Dynamite]], which began publishing Red Sonja comics in 2005, announced that [[Gail Simone]] would be writing a new ongoing ''Red Sonja'' series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicvine.com/articles/eccc-13-gail-simone-to-write-new-red-sonja-ongoing/1100-146141/|title=ECCC 13: Gail Simone to Write New RED SONJA Ongoing Series|work=Comic Vine}}</ref> Simone noted in further interviews that her version is slightly "rebooted," showing the character's beginnings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/25781.html|title=ICv2: Gail Simone on Her New 'Red Sonja' Series|work=icv2.com}}</ref> Issue #1 of Simone's run was released in July 2013, and reviews were positive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicvine.com/articles/early-review-gail-simone-s-red-sonja-1/1100-146593/|title=Early Review: Gail Simone's RED SONJA #1|work=Comic Vine}}</ref> The series ran through 18 issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ladygeekgirl.wordpress.com/2015/10/01/a-fond-farewell-to-gail-simones-red-sonja/|title=A Fond Farewell to Gail Simone’s Red Sonja|work=Lady Geek Girl and Friends}}</ref> In 2017, a new Red Sonja comic series began, written by [[Amy Chu]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2016/09/01/red-sonja-back-in-the-bikini-chainmail-as-amy-chu-launches-series-dynamite-with-carlos-gomez-for-december/|title=Red Sonja Back In The Bikini Chainmail As Amy Chu Launches New Series With Carlos Gomez For December|work=Bleeding Cool}}</ref>

She was portrayed by [[Brigitte Nielsen]] in the 1985 film ''[[Red Sonja (film)|Red Sonja]]''. In 2011, Sonja was ranked first in ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'s'' "100 Sexiest Women in Comics" list.<ref>{{cite book| last = Frankenhoff| first = Brent| authorlink = Brent Frankenhoff| title = Comics Buyer's Guide Presents: 100 Sexiest Women in Comics| publisher = [[Krause Publications]] | year = 2011| pages = 4–5| url = | isbn = 1-4402-2988-0}}</ref>

== Origin ==
Red Sonja's origin story, "The Day of the Sword", first appeared in ''[[Kull the Conqueror|Kull and the Barbarians]]'' #3 (September 1975) by [[Roy Thomas]], [[Doug Moench]], and [[Howard Chaykin]]. The same story was later redrawn by [[Dick Giordano]] and [[Terry Austin (comics)|Terry Austin]] for ''[[Savage Sword of Conan]]'', issue 78 (July 1982).

In this story, Red Sonja lives with her family in a humble house in the Western Hyrkanian steppes (this seems to be in modern Ukraine/Russia, though historical [[Hyrcania]] is on the borders of modern Iran/Turkmenistan). When she is just 17, a group of mercenaries kills her family and burns down their house. Sonja attempts to defend herself, but cannot lift her brother's sword. She is brutally [[rape]]d by the leader of the group. Answering her cry for revenge, the red goddess [[Scáthach]] appears to her, and gives her incredible fighting skills, on the condition that she never lie with a man unless he defeats her in fair combat.

In the Dynamite comic book series by Michael Avon Oeming, Sonja's origins are portrayed in "flashbacks" within each issue beginning with issue #8. The goddess makes her first appearance in this series in issue #12, which also marks the return of the deadly sorcerer [[Kulan Gath]].<ref>Oeming, Michael Avon. ''Red Sonja: She-Devil With a Sword Vol. 2: Arrowsmith.'' Dynamite Comics, 2007.</ref>

In the Dynamite series by Gail Simone, Sonja's origins are again told in flashbacks. Sonja is a young teenager in a Hyrkanian village which is attacked by bandits. After her family is killed, Sonja lures the bandits into the forest and kills them one by one. No goddess appears in this version and Sonja makes no vow of chastity. While she is threatened by the bandits, she is neither raped nor seriously injured. Another set of flashbacks shows Sonja as an adult, and indicates that she learned many of her fighting skills from a fellow prisoner when she was captured and forced to fight as a gladiator.<ref>Simone, Gail. ''Red Sonja: Queen of Plagues.'' Dynamite Comics, 2014.</ref>

=== Revamped Sonja (2010–2012) ===
The original Sonja is killed off in issue #34 of the first Dynamite series. Instead, a new character of the same name, described as a ''reincarnation'' of Red Sonja, takes her place from issue #35 onward.<ref>Reed, Brian. ''Red Sonja: Born Again''. Dynamite Comics, 2010.</ref>

In her new life, Sonja is described as a distant relative of the original Red Sonja, taking her name as a good omen, since Sonja had come to be known as the most beautiful and fearless woman in Hyrkania. A noblewoman, this incarnation lives a fairly sheltered existence, along with her sister Verona and her little niece, longing for a child of her own and waiting for the return of her distant husband, Lord Daniel.

Eventually she is reunited with her husband, but then a pirate crew (unbeknownst to them called upon by Verona's husband, Lord Lucan, in a bid for more power) slays him and leaves Sonja on the brink of death. Sonja is then nursed to health by Osin, in Sonja's previous life a bard companion and now a gruff swordsman, who accepted the curse of [[Claw the Unconquered]] for himself in exchange for the ability to locate and train the new incarnation of Red Sonja.

Osin begins her training. He and Sonja find that, even though she has occasional flashes of her former reflexes, she no longer has access to the full might of the skills bestowed by Scathach (now an almost forgotten goddess with waning powers) in her previous life. Despite this, Sonja is able to learn faster than Osin expects. She decides to seek revenge covertly, joining Lucan's pirate crew to be closer to Daniel's assassins.

== Red Sonja vs. Red Sonya ==
Red Sonja was based on Red Sonya of Rogatino, a character from [[Robert E. Howard]]'s short story "[[The Shadow of the Vulture]]" (''[[Oriental Stories/The Magic Carpet (magazine)|The Magic Carpet]]'', January 1934). Red Sonya was a sword-and-pistol-wielding supporting character of the late [[Renaissance]]. Roy Thomas rewrote "The Shadow of the Vulture" as a Conan story for Marvel Comics' ''Conan the Barbarian'' #23 (1973). Thomas admits that the character he used was a mash-up of two of Howard's characters: Red Sonja and [[Dark Agnes de Chastillon]], a sword woman in 16th-century France.<ref>Afterword by [[Roy Thomas]], in ''The Chronicles of Conan Volume 4: The Song of Red Sonja and Other Stories'' (Dark Horse, 2004)</ref>

== Bikini armor ==
[[File:10.15.11RedSonjaByLuigiNovi1.jpg|thumb|A [[cosplay]]er at the 2011 [[New York Comic Con]] dressed as Red Sonja]]
{{unreferencedsection|date=October 2017}}
Most artists depict Red Sonja wearing a very brief [[chainmail bikini|bikini-like]] costume of [[scale armor]], usually with boots and [[Gauntlet (glove)|gauntlets]]. As originally drawn by [[Barry Windsor-Smith|Barry Smith]] for "The Shadow of the Vulture" and "The Song of Red Sonja" in ''[[Conan the Barbarian]]'' issues 23 and 24 (1973), she did not have as full a figure and dressed a little more conservatively, in a long-sleeved mail shirt and short pants of red silk, a style that did not last long.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

As told by [[Roy Thomas]] in the introduction of ''Red Sonja Adventures'' Volume 1 (Dynamite Entertainment) Spanish artist [[Esteban Maroto]] submitted an uncommissioned illustration to him when he was editing the magazine ''Savage Sword of Conan'' where he redesigned the character and for the first time showed her wearing what would become her famous costume, the silver "metal bikini", which resembled other fantasy costumes that other Maroto heroines sported in the 1970s. This illustration had been printed for the first time in [[Jim Steranko]]'s magazine ''Comixscene'' #5 in black and white. It was reprinted in ''Savage Sword of Conan'' #1, and in ''[[Marvel Treasury Edition]]'' #15 colored but poorly reproduced, and finally restored and colored by [[José Villarrubia]] as an alternative cover for the Dynamite Entertainment edition of ''Red Sonja'' #2. Maroto drew her in this costume for a double page spread illustration in ''[[Savage Tales]]'' #3 and then for her first solo adventure in ''Savage Sword of Conan'' #1, and [[John Buscema]] drew her in this costume in the same magazine. Buscema drew her again in this costume in issues 43, 44 and 48 of  ''[[Conan the Barbarian]]'' (1974) and [[Dick Giordano]] in the first issue of ''[[Marvel Feature]]'' (1975) before [[Frank Thorne]] took over from issue 2 (1976). The "bikini" proved popular, becoming well known through the paintings of [[Boris Vallejo]] and others.

On June 6, 2006, comic news site [[Newsarama]] reported that Red Sonja, LLC (which holds rights to the Roy Thomas version of the character) filed a lawsuit on four counts against [[Paradox Entertainment]] (which claims rights to Red Sonya as part of the Howard library, though no renewal record for ''[[The Shadow of the Vulture]]'' exists) in US Federal Court in April 2006. The four counts are claims of copyright infringement, trademark infringement, trademark dilution, and unfair competition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/dynamitenew/redsonja/12/SonjaConan.html |title=Sonja vs. Conan – Red Sonja, LLC Sues Paradox |accessdate= |work=Newsarama |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628052713/http://www.newsarama.com/dynamitenew/redsonja/12/SonjaConan.html |archivedate=2006-06-28 |df= }}</ref> The lawsuit was settled in January 2008, on the second day of the hearing, for a sum of $1 each. Red Sonja LLC paid $1 to Paradox for the rights to Howard's Red Sonya and permission for the Red Sonja stories to continue being set in Conan's [[Hyborian Age]].
