The '''Omega Men''' are a [[fictional]] team of [[extraterrestrial]] [[superhero]]es published by [[DC Comics]]. They first appeared in ''[[Green Lantern]]'' #141 (June 1981), and were created by [[Marv Wolfman]] and [[Joe Staton]].

==Publication history==
After appearances in ''Green Lantern'', ''[[Action Comics]]'' and ''[[Titans (comics)|The New Teen Titans]]'', the Omega Men were featured in their own comics series which ran for 38 issues from April 1983 to May 1986.  During its run, writer [[Roger Slifer]] and artist [[Keith Giffen]] created the [[mercenary]] [[anti-hero]] [[Lobo (comics)|Lobo]].  Later creators included writers [[Doug Moench]] and [[Todd Klein]] (who also lettered later issues in the run), artists [[Tod Smith]], [[Shawn McManus]] and [[Alex Nino]], and inkers [[Mike DeCarlo]], [[Jim McDermott (illustrator)|Jim McDermott]] and [[Greg Theakston]].  Members of the Omega Men have most recently appeared in the 2004 eight-issue [[Adam Strange]] [[limited series]], as well as the 2005 ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' lead-in 6-issue limited series, ''[[Rann-Thanagar War]]''. And in 2006 had their own six issue  mini-series with Tigorr, Doc, Elu, Broot and Ryand'r - written by [[Andersen Gabrych]] and art by [[Henry Flint]].

==Fictional team history==
The Omega Men hail from the [[Vega|Vegan system]], a [[planetary system]] with twenty-five habitable planets, which as of the early 1980s had been ruled for millennia by the [[Citadel (comics)|Citadellians]], a race of warriors cloned from the First Citadellian the demi-godlike son of [[X'Hal]].

The Citadellians established a tyrannical regime based in a fortress moon known as the Citadel. The citadel then set about to conquer the younger races of Vega. Originally there were only two races in the Vegan system, the primitive Branx and the warlike Okaarans, but the Psions used Okaaran dna to create the other twenty-three races of Vega such as the Tamaraneans, Euphorixians, Aelloans, Karnans, and the Changralyns.

The Omega Men was assembled as a group of renegades and representatives of conquered Vegan worlds to fight Citadellian aggression. Pre-''Infinite Crisis'' the team was based on the planet Kuraq. The Omega Men are important peacekeepers in their sector because the Green Lantern Corps is not allowed into Vegan space, due to a long standing agreement with the Spider Guild.

The Omega Man made a return appearance in the [[Adam Strange]] mini-series. Still led by Tigorr, with veteran members Broot, Doc, Elu, Artin and Harpis. They were joined by a group of new members whose names were given, but not identified in the book. It was in this storyline that the first Doc was killed by a [[Durlan (DC Comics)|Durlan]] assassin who masqueraded as him until discovered. 

In the recent Omega Men mini, it had been revealed that upon returning to the remains of [[Tamaran]] with Ryand'r (who wasn't part of the team in the Adam Strange mini), the Omegans were attacked by the [[Darkstars|Darkstar]] zombies of Lady Styx and all but five of them died.
