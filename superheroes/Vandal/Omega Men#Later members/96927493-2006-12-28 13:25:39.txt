The '''Omega Men''' are a team of [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[comic book]] [[superhero]]es in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]].  Created by writer [[Marv Wolfman]], they first appeared in ''[[Green Lantern]]'' #136 ([[1981]]).

==Publication history==
After appearances in ''Green Lantern'', ''[[Action Comics]]'' and ''[[Titans (comics)|The New Teen Titans]]'', the Omega Men were featured in their own comics series which ran for 38 issues from April 1983 to May 1986.  During its run, writer [[Roger Slifer]] and artist [[Keith Giffen]] created the [[mercenary]] [[anti-hero]] [[Lobo (comics)|Lobo]].  Later creators included writers [[Doug Moench]] and [[Todd Klein]] (who also lettered later issues in the run), artists [[Tod Smith]], [[Shawn McManus]] and [[Alex Nino]], and inkers [[Mike DeCarlo]], [[Jim McDermott (illustrator)|Jim McDermott]] and [[Greg Theakston]].  Members of the Omega Men have most recently appeared in the 2004 eight-issue [[Adam Strange]] [[limited series]], as well as the 2005 ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' lead-in 6-issue limited series, ''[[Rann-Thanagar War]]''. And in 2006 will have their own six issue  mini-series with Tigorr, Doc, Elu, Broot and Ryand'r - it will be written by [[Andersen Gabrych]] and [[Henry Flint]] will provide the art.

==Fictional team history==
The Omega Men hail from the [[Vega]]n [[star system]], a star system with twenty-five habitable planets, which as of the early 1980s had been ruled for millennia by the Citadellians a race of warriors cloned from the First Citadellian the demi-godlike son of X'Hal. 

The Psions also accidentally created the goddess [[X'Hal]] by mutating an Okaaran woman who gave birth to twin sons Lambien and the First [[Citadel (comics)|Citadellian]], her evil son the nameless "First Citadellian" would turn the peaceful Okaarans into the Warlords of Okaara, and later clone the Citadellian race from his own cells. The Psions also accidentally created Nimbus when they separated him from his Branx host.

All Branx possess an angelic shadow creature of living energy like Nimbus, which departs their bodies when they die and enters the body of a newborn Branx. It is possible that the Branx population has never grown past its initial numbers because of this limitation.

The Citadellians established a tyrannical regime based in a fortress moon known as the Citadel. The citadel then set about to conquer the younger races of Vega. Originally there were only two races in the Vegan star system, the primitive Branx and the warlike Okaarans, but the Psions used Okaaran dna to create the other twenty-three races of Vega such as the Tamaraneans, Euphorixians, Aelloans, Karnans, and the Changralyns.

The Omega Men was assembled as a group of renegades and representatives of conquered Vegan worlds to fight Citadellian aggression. Pre Infinite Crisis the team was based on the planet Kuraq. The Omega Men are important peacekeepers in their sector because the Green Lantern Corps is not allowed into Vegan space, due to a long standing agreement with the Spider Guild.
