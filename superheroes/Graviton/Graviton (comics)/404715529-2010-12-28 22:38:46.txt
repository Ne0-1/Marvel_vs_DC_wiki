'''Graviton''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appears in ''Avengers'' #158 (April 1977) and was created by [[Jim Shooter]] and [[Sal Buscema]].

==Fictional character biography==
Franklin Hall is a physicist involved in an experiment in a private research facility in the [[Canadian Rockies]]. A mistake in Hall's calculations causes graviton particles to merge with his own molecules, and Hall later discovers that he can mentally control gravity. Hall at first tries to hide his newfound ability, but becomes tempted by the potential power, and donning a costume adopts the alias "Graviton."

When Graviton takes over the research facility and forbids all communications with the outside world, a fellow scientist sends a distress signal to the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. A furious Graviton then lifts the facility several thousands of feet into the sky and threatens to kill the scientist. The Avengers then arrive and attack, but with the exception of the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] are all defeated when trapped in a gravity field. The Panther escapes and summons the thunder god [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], who battles Graviton to a standstill until Graviton is tricked into thinking a fellow scientist he cares for has committed suicide. Graviton then panics and causes the entire facility to collapse on him, forming a giant stone sphere that is dropped into a river by the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' #158 - 159 (April 1977)</ref>

Graviton later reappears, although is suffering from [[amnesia]] and is flickering in out of existence. Somehow guided to the female scientist he has feelings for, Graviton attempts to abduct her but is stopped by [[Fantastic Four]] member the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] and the [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] [[Black Bolt]]. During the battle, Graviton describes himself as becoming a "living black hole" and morphs into a {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on}} humanoid. Graviton is then attacked until he loses concentration, and then apparently implodes and is considered dead.<ref>''Marvel Two-In-One'' Annual #4 (1979)</ref> Graviton is eventually able to reform his body, and decides to seek
a bride. Elevating a [[Bloomingdale's]] store into the sky, he takes several women hostage until tricked by Thor. Thor then maroons a defeated Graviton in an alternate dimension.<ref>''Thor'' #324 (Oct. 1982)</ref> 

Graviton is able to return when an anomaly opens a portal to Earth. Arriving in [[Los Angeles]], Graviton attempts to unite all criminal elements under his leadership, but is defeated by the [[West Coast Avengers]].<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #2 - 4 (Oct. - Dec. 1984)</ref> Graviton was among the villains recruited by Mister Bitterhorn into Mephisto's Legion Accursed. They were used in part of a plot to kill the Beyonder with Mephisto's Beyondersbane weapon, but were delayed by the Thing until the weapon melted down.<ref>Secret Wars II #7 (January 1986)</ref> Graviton then recruits the supervillains [[Halflife (comics)#Halflife (alien)|Halflife]], [[Quantum (comics)|Quantum]], and [[Zzzax]] as allies, but they are once again defeated by the West Coast Avengers.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' Vol. 2, #12 - 13 (Sep. - Oct 1986)</ref> Graviton then defeats [[Spider-Man]],<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #326 (Dec. 1989)</ref> and after a skirmish with the [[Fantastic Four]],<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #322 (Jan. 1989)</ref> is defeated in turn by a cosmic-powered Spider-Man.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #329 (Feb. 1990); ''Web of Spider-Man'' #64 - 65 (May - June 1990)</ref>

Graviton then attacks the Avengers again, but is defeated when they overload his powers, banishing him to yet another alternate dimension.<ref>''Avengers Unplugged'' #2 (Dec. 1995)</ref> He then sends out a distress signal, which is noticed by the villains [[Techno (comics)|Techno]] and [[Baron Zemo]]. Graviton is eventually freed and attacks the teams the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] and [[Great Lakes Avengers]], but is persuaded by Thunderbolt [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]] to rethink his priorities.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #17 (Aug. 1998)</ref> Desiring still more power, Graviton recruited a team of criminals and looted the city of [[San Francisco]], until eventually defeated by the Thunderbolts with the use of technology from [[Machine Man]], whose flight capabilities cancel gravity.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #27 - 30 (June - Sept. 1999)</ref>

Banished once again to the same alternate dimension, Graviton becomes insane from the constant defeats and exile from Earth, and returns with the goal of total world conquest, accompanied by an adult-level P'tah named M'reel. Seeking revenge on the Thunderbolts, Graviton storms their headquarters to discover they have disbanded and been replaced by the group the [[Redeemers (comics)|Redeemers]]. Graviton kills almost the entire team before being defeated by a reformed Thunderbolts. Discovering that M'reel was channeling his power to create a dimensional warp enabling the P'tah to invade Earth a furious Graviton apparently dies stopping the alien invasion and saves the Thunderbolts.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #53 - 58 (Aug. 2001 - Jan. 2002)</ref> 

Under unrevealed circumstances, Graviton returned to Earth once more and was rendered powerless long enough to be imprisoned on the Raft with other superhuman criminals; however, when Electro shorted out the Raft's defenses to free Sauron, Graviton and dozens of other inmates escaped, only to be confronted by the heroes who would soon organize as the latest incarnation of the Avengers.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 1 #1-5</ref> Although recaptured, Graviton evidently sustained a head injury that somehow greatly dampened his powers, making him way less powerful than at his previous encounter with the Thunderbolts. He also was more megalomaniacal than ever during his next escape, declaring himself capable of forgiving and punishing sins. The reorganized Avengers again fought him at Ryker's, and after wounding Captain America and Spider-Man, Graviton was downed and almost killed by an Extremis enhanced [[Iron Man]].<ref>''Iron Man'' #8 (July 2006)</ref>

He is than seen one final time, and after battling Iron Man once again, ends his own life.<ref>''Iron Man'' #21 - 23 (2007)</ref>

It appeared that Graviton had an evil son with the same powers as he has, named Singularity, but he was revealed to be a normal kid unrelated to Graviton, who was brainwashed and mutated by the evil son of the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]], The Superior.<ref>''Young Allies'' #1-5 (2010)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Franklin Hall was a normal human until empowered by an explosion that intermingled his molecules with sub-nuclear graviton particles generated by a nearby particle generator, which gave him the ability to manipulate [[graviton]]s (the subatomic particles that carry the force of gravitational attraction) and anti-gravitons (similar particles but with opposite force and spin of gravitons). Graviton can surround any person or object, including himself, with gravitons or anti-gravitons, thereby increasing or decreasing the pull of gravity upon it. Hall is able to manipulate gravitons for various uses, including the projection of highly-concussive blasts, formation of gravitational force fields and levitation, and has also proven capable of generating gravitational fields in various objects, making them attract any nearby matter (or individuals) not heavy enough or physically strong enough to resist. By decreasing the pull of gravity beneath him, he can fly at any speed or height at which he can still breathe. By increasing the pull of gravity beneath his opponents, he can pin them to the ground, having made them too heavy to move, or cause sufficient gravitational stress to impair the normal functioning of the human cardiovascular system. He can also cause an inanimate object (such as a 1-foot diameter rock) to radiate enough gravitons to give it its own gravitational field, able to attract nearby matter and energy.

By rapidly projecting gravitons in a cohesive beam, he can generate a force blast with a maximum concussive force equivalent to the primary shockwave of an explosion of 20,000 pounds of TNT. He can also create a gravitational force field around him capable of protecting him from any concussive force up to and including a small nuclear weapon.

On a large scale Graviton could exert his gravitational control over a maximum distance of 2.36 miles from his body. Thus, the maximum volume of matter he could influence at once is 6.88 cubic miles. He once exercised this control by lifting into the air an inverted conic frustum-shaped land mass whose uppermost area was 4 miles across, and causing it to fly as though it were a [[Airship|blimp]].<ref name="autogenerated2007">''All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z'' Update 1 (2007)</ref> He can also erect a gravitational force-field of similar proportions. Graviton can perform as many as four separate tasks simultaneously - he has not only lifted a 4-mile wide land mass as high as cloud level above San Francisco, but he has also surrounded himself with a force-field, ascended on a small rock down and hurled some policemen and helicopter 10000 miles up into the Orbit all at the same time.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #28</ref> Graviton can use his power at maximum capacity for up to eight hours before mental fatigue significantly impairs his performance, and considerably longer (up to eighteen hours) if he conserves his energy during that time.

He was somehow also able to bestow the power of self-propelled flight to at least 70 people independent from his location, however he was also able to take this power away with a thought.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #28</ref>

With time and training his power further advanced as sustained application of his power, even to the extent of levitating an island miles above ground level,<ref name="autogenerated2007"/> can continue while he sleeps,<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #29</ref> he was able to somewhat reshape mountains on the Moon<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #53</ref> and demonstrated the ability to lift a small stone in China while residing in L.A. and deposit it in Australia through a victims head just to see if he could so.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #54</ref> By separating himself from Earth's gravitational field and instead attuning himself to the gravitational field of the Sun he was able to cross the distance from Earth to the Sun within minutes, where his individual force field proved strong enough to withstand the forces of the Sun itself. <ref>''Thunderbolts'' #56</ref>

Hall's single most ambitious display of power was when he held almost every Marvel hero in stasis, including the whole [[Fantastic Four]], some of the [[X-Men]] and such physical powerhouses as [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]], [[Hulk (comics)| the Hulk]] and [[Namor]], and began using his powers to try reshaping the Earth in his image.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #57</ref>

He also had the ability to detect extra-dimensional-shiftings and phased or invisible objects through his immediate awareness of gravitational shiftings<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #17</ref><ref>''Thunderbolts'' #58</ref> and while he was not able to invoke dimensional portals<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #17</ref> he is at least able to close them.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #58</ref> He can simulate vast superhuman strength and durability using gravitonic fields to surround his body, but he cannot actually manipulate density or increase his physical strength.

Aside from his powers to manipulate gravity, Hall had a PhD in Physics and is intellectually brilliant, with expertise in advanced physics, including teleportation. His greatest limitation was that he was emotionally and mentally very disturbed.

Franklin Hall joined S.H.I.E.L.D. in a plan to recreate the Super-Soldier Serum. Hall ended up causing the accident that gave himself gravitational powers. Due to him being dangerous, Hall ended up imprisoned at [[The Raft (comics)|The Raft]] by Nick Fury. When a technological problem occurred at The Raft, Graviton was freed and planned his revenge on Nick Fury. This was interrupted by Thor, Wasp, Iron Man, and Ant-Man who as a team fought Graviton. Only with additional help from the Hulk were they able to defeat Graviton. Clay Quartermain later told Nick Fury that Graviton was still asleep when the Raft had a technological problem meaning that someone else orchestrated the breakouts.
