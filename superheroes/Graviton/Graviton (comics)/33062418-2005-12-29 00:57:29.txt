'''Graviton''' (Franklin Hall) is an [[elemental]] [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], and an enemy of [[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]].
==Character biography==
Graviton is an extremely poweful villain with the ability to control gravity in the area around him. He can levitate objects, surround himself with an impenatrable forcefield, etc. He is also completely insane.  He has tried to conquer the world on a few occasions and has come into conflict with a large number of superheroes, who were usually able to defeat him by exploiting his weak psyche.

Franklin Hall was once a scientist who was experimenting with physics in a private research facility in the [[Canadian Rockies]]. During an accident, his atoms were mixed with thousands of sub-nuclear [[graviton]]s. After recuperating from the accident, he found that he could control [[gravity]] mentally. Unfortunately, the accident damaged his mind, causing him to be criminally insane. He constructed a suit for himself and dubbed himself "Graviton", after his ability to control gravity. 

After recovering, he took over the research facility and, using his gravity power, blasted into the sky with it. The Avengers were alerted to this threat, and attempted to rescue the facility. The resulting battle caused the facility to collapse inward on Graviton, and it sufficiently added to his mass, giving him a greater gravitational field. Eventually, he was able to separate himself from the facility.

==Powers and abilities==
Hall is able to manipulate gravitons for various uses, including the projection of concussive blasts, formation of force fields and levitation, and has also proven capable of generating gravitational fields in various objects, making them attract any nearby matter (or individuals) not heavy enough or physically strong enough to resist.

Aside from his powers to manipulate gravity, Hall has a PhD in Physics and is intellectually brilliant. Graviton is potentially one of the most powerful Marvel characters. His greatest limitation is that he is emotionally and mentally very disturbed.
