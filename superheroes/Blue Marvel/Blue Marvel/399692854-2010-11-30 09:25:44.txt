'''Blue Marvel''' ('''Adam Brashear''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[comic book]] [[superhero]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The Blue Marvel debuted in ''Adam: Legend of the Blue Marvel'' # 1, (November 2008), and was created by [[Kevin Grevioux]]. The Blue Marvel was based in part on a character Grevioux created as a kid being a fan of superhero comics.<ref>http://marvel.com/catalog/?id=10120</ref>

==Publication history==
Adam Brashear debuted in the five issue ''Adam: Legend of the Blue Marvel'' mini-series created by [[Kevin Grevioux]].<ref>[http://marvel.com/news/comicstories.4309.sdcc_~apos~08~colon~_adam~colon~_legend_of_the_blue_marvel Marvel.com: SDCC '08: Adam: Legend of the Blue Marvel], [[Marvel.com]], July 25, 2008</ref><ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=17398 CCI: The 'Return' of "The Blue Marvel"], [[Comic Book Resources]], July 25, 2008</ref> He later appeared briefly in ''[[Secret Invasion#What If?|What If? Secret Invasion]]'' #1 (February 2010) wearing an updated version of his costume. Although to note, it was an alternate universe version of Adam Brashear, not the
Earth-616 version.

==Fictional character biography==
Adam Brashear is a former [[Fullback (American football)|fullback]] at [[Cornell University]] who graduated [[magna cum laude]], and a veteran of the [[Korean War]], a member of the [[Marine Corps]] with two [[Silver Stars]].<ref>''Adam: Legend of the Blue Marvel'' #1, (November 2008)</ref> The Marine Corps was where he first met Conner Sims, the friend he would later know as "Anti-Man". Brashear later became the project lead on a scientific attempt to harness [[anti-matter]] through the creation of a "Negative Reactor" which created a bridge between the [[Negative Zone]] and the positive matter universe. This reactor would then allow for an almost unlimited source of clean energy by allowing devices to tap the energy generated by a stable [[event horizon]] balanced between these positive and negative universes. Due to the unexpected explosion of the reactor, both Brashear and Sims were subjected to [[mutagenic]] radiation generated by the then unstable event horizon, and while Sims' body [[decoherence|decohered]] into energy, Brashear became a stable "antimatter reactor" and developed a set of superhuman abilities.<ref>''Adam: Legend of the Blue Marvel'' #4, (April 2009)</ref>

In [[1962]] Adam received the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] from President [[John F. Kennedy]] on the day the President asked him to retire. The reason why he was asked to retire was that it had been discovered by the public that he is an [[African-American]] (As the Blue Marvel, Brashear wore a full-face helmet, which on this occasion was damaged). This immediately led to massive controversy; the America of 1962 was definitely not ready for a black super-man. The President reluctantly decided to ask Brashear to step back, and torn between myriad considerations, the Blue Marvel conceded.

He came back for one final mission and defeated the herald of an alien armada bent on enslaving the earth. After that fight, he left the Medal of Freedom in the [[Blue Area of the Moon]], where he first met [[Uatu]] the [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]]. His conversation with the Watcher was interrupted by the late arrival of the alien armada, and he was forced to defeat them. The United States Government used this final mission to fake his death. The government later sets up with covert [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Agent Marlene Frazier as Brashear's monitor, she was known to him as Candace. Frazier eventually became his lover and later his wife, the mother of their two children.<ref>''Adam: Legend of the Blue Marvel'' #2-3, (February–March 2009)</ref> Brashear later became a tenured professor of [[physics]] at the [[University of Maryland]].

After Anti-Man's return resulted in the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] being soundly defeated, Tony Stark ([[Iron Man]]), tracks down Brashear and with the help of [[Reed Richards]] they come up with a plan to stop Anti-Man (Conner Sims). After a surprise confrontation by Sims on the moon, Brashear is left unconscious. Later after an extended fight with Anti-Man, Adam's wife Candace Brashear is accidentally killed. At the conclusion of their battle, Brashear takes Anti-Man up to the edge of the [[ionosphere]] and siphons off his remaining "anti-matter energy" causing his waveform to permanently decohere and collapse.<ref>''Adam: Legend of the Blue Marvel'' #5, (May 2009)</ref>

===Heroic Age===
{{main|Heroic Age (comics)}}
Afterward, Brashear recently returned to action as a full-time superhero in ''[[Heroic Age (comics)|Age of Heroes]]'' #3. And after a discussion with [[Uatu]] the [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]], he ends up traveling to [[Uzbekistan]] to help the [[Winter Guard]] subdue an alternate version of [[Hyperion (comics)#Exiles|King Hyperion]]. This version of King Hyperion had somehow found his way to Earth.<ref>''Age of Heroes'' #3 (September 2010)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
*As the Blue Marvel, Brashear displayed immunity against physical harm, flying ability, superhuman speed, creating energy shields and constructs, the ability to thrive in the vacuums of space, and vast superhuman strength. Examples of the extent of these abilities include: 1. Lifting an asteroid the size of Arkansas 2. Surviving a ground zero detonation of an atomic bomb. 3. Engaging in a sustained battle with Avengers, culminating in him knocking the Superman-like Sentry into orbit unconscious.<ref>''Adam: Legend of the Blue Marvel'' #1-5 (November 2008-May 2009)</ref>
*According to Brashear he is a stable "antimatter reactor", but from his broader explanation what he appears to do is channel [[exotic particles]] generated by a stable [[event horizon]] caused by the interaction of opposing positive matter and negative matter ([[Negative Zone]]) universes. Because Brashear has retained his abilities all this time, it would seem that either the specific generative reaction, that granted him his powers continues at an unseen or [[subatomic]] level in the facility where he first gained his abilities, or exotic particles generated by the experiment somehow became [[quantum entanglement|quantum entangled]] with Brashear.<ref>''Adam: Legend of the Blue Marvel'' #2-3, (February–March 2009)</ref>
*Adam Brashear holds a [[PhD]] in [[Theoretical Physics]], and a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[Electrical Engineering]] from [[Cornell University]].<ref>''Adam: Legend of the Blue Marvel'' #1 (November 2008)</ref>
*Brashear maintains a massive undersea "[[Fortress of Solitude]]" in the [[Mariana trench]] at a location known only to [[Namor]] the Sub Mariner.<ref>''Adam: Legend of the Blue Marvel'' #4, (April 2009)</ref>
