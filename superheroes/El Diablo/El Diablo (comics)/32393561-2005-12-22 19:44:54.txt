'''El Diablo''' is a name shared by at least two fictional characters whose adventures have been published by [[DC Comics]] over the decades.

===1.1 Lazarus Long===

Lazarus Long was the original El Diablo, operating in the latter half of the 19th Century in the old American West.

Lane was originally a bank teller who was nearly killed by a gang of thieves and put in a coma after being hit by lightning. After being revived by a Native American shaman, Lane became a vigilante and called himself El Diablo. He is one of several Wild West DC characters, along with [[Jonah Hex]], [[Bat Lash]], the original [[Pow-Wow Smith]], and the original, heroic [[Trigger Twins]]. The name El Diablo means "the devil" in Spanish.

The second comics series published by DC under the ''El Diablo'' name was published under their [[Vertigo (comics)|Vertigo]] imprint as a mature readers title.

He is not to be confused with the fire-powered character named El Diablo featured in the comic-related Freedom Force computer games.

===1.2 Rafael Sandoval===

The second iteration was created in 1988 by writer [[Gerard Jones]] and artist [[Mike Parobeck]] as a title set in the modern DC Universe.

As created by Jones and Parobeck, Rafael Sandoval was a rookie member of the city council of [[Dos Rios (comics)|Dos Rios]], [[Texas]] who created his version of El Diablo from an old boxing persona and local legends surrounding the [[Devil]] when stymied by his rookie status in local politics in trying to pursue the case of a serial insurance arsonist via official channels.

This title lasted 16 months, and the Sandoval character has subsequently made one major guest appearance in one of the [[Justice League]] titles.

===1.3 Depictions in Other Media===

In the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode ''[[The Once and Future Thing]]: [[Weird Western Tales]],'' the version used is that of the original hero from the [[Old West]].  His costume somewhat resembles that of [[Zorro]].
