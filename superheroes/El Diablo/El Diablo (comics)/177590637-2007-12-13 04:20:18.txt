'''El Diablo''' is a name shared by two [[fictional]] characters published by [[DC Comics]]. 

Lazarus Lane first appeared in ''[[All-Star Western]]'' #2 (October 1970), and was created by [[Robert Kanigher]] and [[Gray Morrow]]. Rafael Sandoval first appeared in ''El Diablo'' #1 (August 1989), and was created by [[Gerard Jones]] and [[Mike Parobeck]].

==Lazarus Lane==
Lazarus Lane is the original El Diablo, operating in the latter half of the 19th Century in the old American West.

Lane was originally a bank teller who is nearly killed by a gang of thieves and put in a coma after being hit by lightning. After being revived by a Native American shaman, Lane becomes a vigilante and called himself El Diablo. He is one of several Wild West DC characters, along with [[Jonah Hex]], [[Bat Lash]], the original [[Pow-Wow Smith]], and the original, heroic [[Trigger Twins]]. The name El Diablo means "the devil" in Spanish.

The second comics series published by DC under the ''El Diablo'' name was published under their [[Vertigo Comics|Vertigo]] imprint as a mature readers title.

According to ''Jonah Hex'' #11 (2006) and issue #24 (2007), Lazarus Lane is cursed to be the host of a minor demon which acts as a [[Spectre (comics)|Spirit of Vengeance]]. His fate is similar to that of the current [[Crimson Avenger#Current Crimson Avenger|Crimson Avenger]].

==Rafael Sandoval==
The second iteration was created in 1988 by writer [[Gerard Jones]] and artist [[Mike Parobeck]] as a title set in the modern DC Universe.  This title lasted 16 months.

As created by Jones and Parobeck, Rafael Sandoval is a rookie member of the city council of [[Dos Rios (comics)|Dos Rios]], [[Texas]] who creates his version of El Diablo from an old boxing persona and local legends surrounding the [[Devil]] when stymied trying to pursue the case of a serial insurance arsonist via official channels.

Subsequent efforts involve battles with illicit drug smugglers using [[maquiladora]] covers for their activities, a hunt for a serial killer, conflicts with human-smuggling operations, and with Sandoval's own conscience over how best to serve the people of Dos Rios.

The Sandoval character has subsequently made guest appearances in one of the [[Justice League]] titles, in which he is possessed by the spirit of an [[Aztec]] god-emperor.  He also appears in the [[Villains United|Villains United Special]] when he is pulled out of retirement by [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]] to serve in her ''de facto'' Justice League, whereupon he is attacked by a member of the [[Royal Flush Gang]] during a battle at the ''[[List of correctional facilities in comics#Enclave M|Enclave M]]'' prison in the [[Sonora|Sonora Valley]], [[Mexico]]. He is wounded in the battle, but saved from death by the warden of the facility.

===One Year Later===
In ''[[Blue Beetle (Jaime Reyes)|Blue Beetle]]'' v.3 # 8, a chain of restaurants operating under the ''El Diablo's'' name is established. What relationship the chain has to either Lane or Sandoval or any other character now using the alias is as yet unidentified.

==Other versions==
*El Diablo is a character featured in [[Irrational Games]]' [[Freedom Force (computer game)|Freedom Force]] series of video games and a six-issue comic book miniseries based on those games published by [[Image Comics]] in 2005.

==Appearances in other media==
In the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "[[The Once and Future Thing (Justice League Unlimited)|The Once and Future Thing]]," the original version of El Diablo appears.  His costume somewhat resembles that of [[Zorro]].  He is voiced by [[Nestor Carbonell]].
