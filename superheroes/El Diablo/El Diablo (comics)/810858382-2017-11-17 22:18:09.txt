==Fictional character biography==

===Lazarus Lane===
Lazarus Lane is the original iteration of El Diablo, operating in the later half of the 19th century in the [[American Old West]]. Lane was originally a [[bank teller]] who is nearly killed by a gang of thieves and put in a [[coma]] after being struck by [[lightning]]. After being revived by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[Shamanism|shaman]] "Wise Owl", Lane becomes the [[vigilante]] El Diablo.<ref name="dc-ency"/> The name [[wiktionary:El Diablo|El Diablo]] means "the devil" in [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

According to ''[[Jonah Hex]]'' vol. 2, #11 (Nov. 2006)  and #24 (Dec. 2007), Lazarus Lane is cursed to be the host of a minor [[demon]] which acts as a [[Spectre (comics)|Spirit of Vengeance]]. Lane's body slumbers in a coma while "El Diablo" roams the Earth. His fate is similar to that of the current [[Crimson Avenger#Current Crimson Avenger|Crimson Avenger]].  In ''Swamp Thing'' vol. 2, #85 (April 1989), Wise Owl is shown in a more villainous light, with Lane/El Diablo his unwilling servant. In that story, set in 1872, a number of DC's western heroes (including the aforementioned Hex, [[Bat Lash]], [[Johnny Thunder]], and [[Madame .44]]) were employed by Otto Von Hammer and [[Jason Blood]] to defeat Wise Owl and recover from him an object of great power, which turned out to be a crystal containing the spirit of [[Swamp Thing]], who had become lost in time.  When the group killed Wise Owl, Lane's comatose body woke up, and El Diablo apparently vanished forever.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

In ''[[The New 52]]'' (a reboot of the DC Comics universe), Lazarus Lane appeared in a backup feature in ''[[All-Star Western]]''. In this iteration, he was once again cursed by Wise Owl to become the host of a demon. Rather than being in a coma, Lazarus remains awake. However, El Diablo arises from his body whenever he is unconscious.

===Rafael Sandoval===
Rafael Sandoval was the second iteration created in 1989 by writer [[Gerard Jones]] and artist [[Mike Parobeck]] as a title set in the modern DC Universe. This title lasted 16 months. As created by Jones and Parobeck, Sandoval is a rookie member of the city council of Dos Rios, Texas who creates his version of El Diablo (from a festival costume and an old boxing persona and local legends surrounding the [[Devil]]) after being stymied by officials while trying to pursue the case of a serial arsonist.<ref name="dc-ency"/> Subsequent efforts involved battles with illicit drug smugglers using [[maquiladora]] covers for their activities, a hunt for a serial killer, conflicts with human-smuggling operations, and with Sandoval's own conscience over how best to serve the people of Dos Rios.

Rafael Sandoval's character has subsequently made guest appearances in one of the ''[[Justice League]]'' titles, in which he is possessed by the spirit of an [[Aztec]] god-emperor and takes on an appearance reminiscent of the Lazarus Lane Diablo.<ref name="dc-ency"/>  He also appears in the [[Villains United|Villains United Special]] when he is pulled out of retirement by [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]] to serve in her ''de facto'' Justice League, whereupon he is attacked by a member of the [[Royal Flush Gang]] during a battle at the [[List of correctional facilities in comics#Enclave M|Enclave M]] prison in the [[Sonora|Sonora Valley]], [[Mexico]]. He is wounded in the battle, but saved from death by the warden of the facility.

===Chato Santana===
The current iteration of El Diablo is Chato Santana, an ex-criminal who after being hospitalized, meets a still living comatose Lazarus Lane.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com//comics/080616-dc-solicits-sept08.html |title=DC Comics' September 2008 Solicitations |publisher=Newsarama.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showpost.php?p=4739328&postcount=1 |title=NEWSARAMA - View Single Post - EL DIABLO RETURNS AT DC IN 2008 |publisher=Forum.newsarama.com |date=2007-11-17 |accessdate=2011-04-02}}</ref> It is written by [[Jai Nitz]], pencilled by [[Phil Hester (comics)|Phil Hester]], with inks by [[Ande Parks]].<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/080802-ElDiablo.html Jai Nitz & Phil Hester - Introducing El Diablo], [[Newsarama]], August 2, 2008</ref>

In [[The New 52]] continuity and [[DC Extended Universe]], he is a member of the [[Suicide Squad]]. He is later recruited into [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]] under the leadership of Uncle Sam, until he realizes that he is being lied to and abandons them in search of the truth.
