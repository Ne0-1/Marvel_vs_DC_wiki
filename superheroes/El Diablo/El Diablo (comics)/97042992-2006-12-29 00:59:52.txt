'''El Diablo''' is a name shared by at least two fictional characters whose adventures have been published by [[DC Comics]] and that of a completely different character featured in Irrational Games' [[Freedom Force]] series of video games and a six-issue comic book miniseries based on those games published by Image Comics in 2005.

==Lazarus Lane==
Lazarus Lane was the original El Diablo, operating in the latter half of the 19th Century in the old American West.

Lane was originally a bank teller who was nearly killed by a gang of thieves and put in a coma after being hit by lightning. After being revived by a Native American shaman, Lane became a vigilante and called himself El Diablo. He is one of several Wild West DC characters, along with [[Jonah Hex]], [[Bat Lash]], the original [[Pow-Wow Smith]], and the original, heroic [[Trigger Twins]]. The name El Diablo means "the devil" in Spanish.

The second comics series published by DC under the ''El Diablo'' name was published under their [[Vertigo (comics)|Vertigo]] imprint as a mature readers title.

According to ''Jonah Hex'' #11(2006), Lazarus Lane is the host of a minor [[Spectre (comics)|Spirit of Vengeance]] similar to the current [[Crimson Avenger#Current Crimson Avenger|Crimson Avenger]].

==Rafael Sandoval==
The second iteration was created in 1988 by writer [[Gerard Jones]] and artist [[Mike Parobeck]] as a title set in the modern DC Universe.

As created by Jones and Parobeck, Rafael Sandoval was a rookie member of the city council of [[Dos Rios (comics)|Dos Rios]], [[Texas]] who created his version of El Diablo from an old boxing persona and local legends surrounding the [[Devil]] when stymied by his rookie status in local politics in trying to pursue the case of a serial insurance arsonist via official channels.

Subsequent efforts involved battles with illicit drug smugglers using [[maquiladora]] covers for their activities, a hunt for a serial killer, conflicts with human-smuggling operations, and with Sandoval's own conscience over how best to serve the people of Dos Rios.

This title lasted 16 months, and the Sandoval character has subsequently made guest appearances in one of the [[Justice League]] titles, in which he was possessed by the spirit of an [[Aztec]] god-emperor, and the [[Villains United|Villains United Special]] when he was pulled out of retirement by [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]] to serve in her ''de facto'' Justice League, whereupon he was attacked by a member of the [[Royal Flush Gang]] during a battle at the prison '''Enclave M''' in the Sonora Valley. He was wounded in the battle, but saved from death by the warden of the facility.

==One Year Later==

In ''Blue Beetle'' v.3 # 8, a chain of restaurants operating under the ''El Diablo's'' name is established. What relationship the chain has to either Lane or Sandoval or any other character now using the alias is as yet unidentified.

==Depictions in Other Media==

In the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode ''[[The Once and Future Thing]]: [[Weird Western Tales]],'' the version used is that of the original hero from the [[Old West]].  His costume somewhat resembles that of [[Zorro]].  He is voiced by [[Nestor Carbonell]].
