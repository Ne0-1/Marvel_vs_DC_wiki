==Publication history==
The first El Diablo, Lazarus Lane, was created by [[Robert Kanigher]] and [[Gray Morrow]] and debuted in ''[[All-Star Western]]'' #2 (October [[1970 in comics|1970]]). Lane starred in a  four issue mini-series series published by DC Comics through their [[Vertigo Comics|Vertigo]] imprint as a mature readers title; ''El Diablo'' vol. 1 #1, (March 2001) was written by [[Brian Azzarello]] and drawn by Danijel Zezelj. 

Rafael Sandoval first appeared in ''El Diablo'' vol. 2 #1 (August [[1989 in comics|1989]]) and was created by [[Gerard Jones]] and [[Mike Parobeck]]. 

Chato Santana first appeared in ''El Diablo'' vol. 3 #1 (September 2008) and was created by Jai Nitz, [[Phil Hester (comics)|Phil Hester]] and [[Ande Parks]].

==Lazarus Lane==
Lazarus Lane is the original El Diablo, operating in the latter half of the 19th century in the [[American Old West]]. Lane was originally a [[bank teller]] who is nearly killed by a gang of thieves and put in a [[coma]] after being struck by [[lightning]]. After being revived by a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[Shamanism|shaman]] named "Wise Owl", Lane becomes a [[vigilante]] and called himself El Diablo.<ref name="dc-ency"/> The name [[El Diablo (disambiguation)|El Diablo]] means "the devil" in [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

According to ''[[Jonah Hex]]'' vol. 2 #11 (November 2006) and Jonah Hex vol. 2 #24 (December 2007), Lazarus Lane is cursed to be the host of a minor [[demon]] which acts as a [[Spectre (comics)|Spirit of Vengeance]]. Lane's body slumbers in a coma while "El Diablo" roams the Earth. His fate is similar to that of the current [[Crimson Avenger#Current Crimson Avenger|Crimson Avenger]].  In Swamp Thing vol. 2 #85 (April 1989), Wise Owl is shown in a more villainous light, with Lane/El Diablo his unwilling servant.  In that story, set in 1872, a number of DC's western heroes (including the aforementioned Hex, [[Bat Lash]], [[Johnny Thunder]], and [[Madame .44]]) were employed by Otto Von Hammer and [[Jason Blood]] to defeat Wise Owl and recover from him an object of great power, which turned out to be a crystal containing the spirit of [[Swamp Thing]], who had become lost in time.  When the group killed Wise Owl, Lane's comatose body woke up, and El Diablo apparently vanished forever.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

=== 2011 Relaunch ===
Following the company-wide DC reboot in 2011, Lazarus Lane appeared in a backup feature in ''[[All-Star Western]]''.  In this iteration, he was once again cursed by Wise Owl to become the host of a demon.  Rather than being in a coma, Lazarus remains awake, however El Diablo arises from his body whenever he is unconscious.

==Rafael Sandoval==
The second iteration was created in 1989 by writer [[Gerard Jones]] and artist [[Mike Parobeck]] as a title set in the modern DC Universe.  This title lasted 16 months. As created by Jones and Parobeck, Rafael Sandoval is a rookie member of the city council of Dos Rios, Texas who creates his version of El Diablo from a festival costume and an old boxing persona and local legends surrounding the [[Devil]] when stymied by officials while trying to pursue the case of a serial arsonist.<ref name="dc-ency"/> Subsequent efforts involved battles with illicit drug smugglers using [[maquiladora]] covers for their activities, a hunt for a serial killer, conflicts with human-smuggling operations, and with Sandoval's own conscience over how best to serve the people of Dos Rios.

Rafael Sandoval's character has subsequently made guest appearances in one of the [[Justice League]] titles, in which he is possessed by the spirit of an [[Aztec]] god-emperor and takes on an appearance reminiscent of the Lazarus Lane Diablo.<ref name="dc-ency"/>  He also appears in the [[Villains United|Villains United Special]] when he is pulled out of retirement by [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]] to serve in her ''de facto'' Justice League, whereupon he is attacked by a member of the [[Royal Flush Gang]] during a battle at the ''[[List of correctional facilities in comics#Enclave M|Enclave M]]'' prison in the [[Sonora|Sonora Valley]], [[Mexico]]. He is wounded in the battle, but saved from death by the warden of the facility.

==Chato Santana==
The current El Diablo is Chato Santana, an ex-criminal who after being hospitalized, meets a still living comatose Lazarus Lane.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com//comics/080616-dc-solicits-sept08.html |title=DC Comics' September 2008 Solicitations |publisher=Newsarama.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showpost.php?p=4739328&postcount=1 |title=NEWSARAMA - View Single Post - EL DIABLO RETURNS AT DC IN 2008 |publisher=Forum.newsarama.com |date=2007-11-17 |accessdate=2011-04-02}}</ref> It is written by [[Jai Nitz]], pencilled by [[Phil Hester (comics)|Phil Hester]], with inks by [[Ande Parks]].<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/080802-ElDiablo.html Jai Nitz & Phil Hester - Introducing El Diablo], [[Newsarama]], August 2, 2008</ref>

In DC's 2011 relaunch, he is now a member of the Suicide Squad.

==In other media==
In the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "[[The Once and Future Thing (Justice League Unlimited)|The Once and Future Thing]]," the original version of El Diablo appears.  While designed after his comic appearance, elements from [[Zorro|Zorro's]] appearance were added in.  He is voiced by [[Nestor Carbonell]].
