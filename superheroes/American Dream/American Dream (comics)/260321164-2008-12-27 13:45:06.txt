'''American Dream''' ('''Shannon Carter''') is a [[fictional character]] featured in [[Marvel Comics]] [[MC2]] series ''[[A-Next]]''.  Her costume is very similar to that of [[Captain America]] and like him she has an [[Captain America's shield|indestructible metal shield]].  She appeared as a civilian in ''A-Next'' no. 1, and was named as "Shannon" in ''A-Next'' no.3; it was not until ''A-Next'' no. 4 that she appeared in costume, as a prospective team member. 

American Dream's own five-part [[limited series|mini-series]] began in May [[2008 in comics|2008]].

==Fictional character biography==
The niece of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent [[Sharon Carter]]<ref>[http://en.marveldatabase.com/Shannon_Carter_%28Earth-982%29 Marvel Database]</ref>, Shannon Carter grew up idolizing Captain America. She was hired by [[Edwin Jarvis]] as a tour guide for the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] Headquarters, at that time functioning only as a museum. When the new Avengers team was formed, she was determined to join. She wears a costume based on Captain America's and carries on her arms disc weapons resembling miniature versions of his shield.  Her strength and agility are honed by intensive physical training. After joining the team as the "American Dream", <ref>''A-Next'' #4</ref> Shannon soon proved herself to be an effective Avenger, and when the team saved the original Avengers from a dark parallel world, Captain America himself judged her worthy to wield the shield of the alternate Captain.<ref>''A-Next'' #11</ref>. She also proved to be an important character in defeating Galactus in the [[Last Planet Standing]] limited series. She along with Stinger and Spider-Girl took down Galactus from the inside. They survived the imminent explosion by shrinking to microscopic size.

Carter is the leader of the "Dream Team" comprising herself, [[Bluestreak (comics)|Bluestreak]], [[Crimson Curse]] and [[Freebooter (comics)|Freebooter]]. All members of the Dream Team became members of the new Avengers team in [[A-Next]] no. 4. American Dream is also an ally of [[Spider-Girl]], [[Earth Sentry]], [[Blacklight (MC2)|Blacklight]], [[Coal Tiger]], [[Argo the Almighty|Argo]] and Captain America.

American Dream has fought against the [[Sons of the Serpent]],<ref>''A-Next'' #4 and #9</ref> [[Seth (Marvel Comics)|Seth]], the [[Revengers]],<ref>''A-Next'' #12</ref> [[Fatal Force]] and [[Loki (comics)|Loki]].<ref>''[[Last Hero Standing]]''</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Although a non-powered human, American Dream is in peak physical condition and is a skilled [[martial arts|martial artist]]. She has disc weapons similar to [[Ricochet (comics)|Ricochet]]'s and has superb aim. She now also carries a version of Captain America's shield, which she uses both defensively and offensively to great effect. Her fighting skills are matched by her leadership ability.
