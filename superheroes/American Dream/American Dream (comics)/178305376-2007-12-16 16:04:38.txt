'''American Dream''' ('''Shannon Carter'''), a [[fictional character]] featured in [[Marvel Comics]] series ''[[A-Next]]''. Carter is the leader of the "Dream Team" comprising herself, [[Bluestreak (comics)|Bluestreak]], [[Crimson Curse]], [[Freebooter (comics)|Freebooter]] and [[J2 (comics)|J2]]. She is in excellent physical condition and is a skilled fighter. Her costume is very similar to that of [[Captain America]] and like him she has an indestructible metal shield. All members of the Dream Team became members of the [[A-Next]]. American Dream is also an ally of [[Spider-Girl]], [[Earth Sentry]], [[Blacklight (MC2)|Blacklight]], [[Coal Tiger]], [[Argo the Almighty|Argo]] and Captain America.

==Fictional character biography==
The daughter of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent [[Sharon Carter]], Shannon Carter grew up idolizing Captain America. She got a job working as a tour guide for the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] Mansion. When the new Avengers team A-Next was formed, she was invited to join. She had designed a costume, created disc weapons that looked like miniature versions of Captain America's shield, and underwent a lot of physical training to make herself as strong and as agile as humanly possible. She joined the team as the "American Dream". Shannon soon proved herself to be worthy of Cap's colors, and when the team had to save the original Avengers from a dark parallel reality, she proved that she was worthy of his shield; The original Captain America gave her the alternate Captain's shield.

American Dream has fought against the [[Sons of the Serpent]], [[Seth (comics)|Seth]], Doctor Doom ([[Kristoff Vernard]]), the [[Revengers]], [[Fatal Force]] and [[Loki (comics)|Loki]]. She is not only a great fighter, but also a great leader.

==Powers and abilities==
American Dream is in peak physical condition for a non-powered human and is a skilled [[martial arts|martial artist]]. She has disc weapons similar to those used by [[Ricochet (comics)|Ricochet]] and has superb aim. Later she was given a duplicate of Captain America's shield (more accurately, the shield itself from another dimension), and she uses it well, both defensively and offensively.
