'''Baron Blitzkrieg''' is a [[fictional]] [[supervillain]] in the [[DC Comics]] universe, originally residing on Earth-Two. He first appeared in ''World's Finest Comics'' #246 (August-September 1977). His first several appearances marked an antagonistic relationship with Wonder Woman and later faced both the Amazon and Superman towards the end of [[World War II]].

He was a frequent opponent of the heroic [[All-Star Squadron]], a band of costumed adventurers who fought domestic and foreign menaces during World War II. Baron Blitzkrieg was originally an especially vicious German army officer who was blinded when a [[concentration camp]] prisoner threw acid in his face. German scientists experimented on Blitzkrieg, giving him superhuman strength, optical energy beams and the ability to fly. However, each of these abilities were manifested one at a time and only with training was he able to incorporate them together.

Baron Blitzkrieg was leader of [[Shadowspire]] and allied with Vandal Savage's organization known as Symbolix. Together, they incorporated experimental research which produced the superhero [[Damage (comics)|Damage]]. The Baron became a recurring foe in Damage's series, starting with issue number three.

During the ''[[Justice Society of America|JSA]]'' tie-in to ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', it was revealed the Baron Blitzkrieg had joined [[Secret Society of Super Villains|the Society]]. The [[Philadelphia]] heroine known as [[Liberty Belle (comics)|Liberty Belle]], who gets her powers from the [[Liberty Bell]], attempted to jumpstart her abilities by ringing the bell. However, due to the recent supposed death of [[Uncle Sam (comics)|Uncle Sam]] (who has recently returned in [[DCU: Brave New World|A Brave New World]]), her powers are unfocused, and Blitzkrieg was thought to have been killed by the sonic shockwaves. He appeared again in ''Infinite Crisis #7'' where he was killed by [[Superboy-Prime]] who fried the Baron's head with his [[heat vision]].
