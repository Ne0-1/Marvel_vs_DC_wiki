==Fictional character biography==
He is a frequent opponent of the heroic [[All-Star Squadron]], a band of costumed adventurers who fight domestic and foreign menaces during World War II. Baron Blitzkrieg was originally an especially vicious German army officer who was blinded when a [[concentration camp]] prisoner threw acid in his face. German scientists experiment on Blitzkrieg, giving him superhuman strength, invulnerability, optical energy beams and the ability to fly. However, each of these abilities are manifested one at a time and only with training is he able to incorporate them together.

Baron Blitzkrieg is the leader of [[Shadowspire]] and allied with Vandal Savage's organization known as Symbolix. Together, they incorporate experimental research which produces the superhero [[Damage (comics)|Damage]]. The Baron becomes a recurring foe in Damage's series, starting with issue number three.

During the ''[[Justice Society of America|JSA]]'' tie-in to ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', it is revealed that Baron Blitzkrieg has joined [[Secret Society of Super Villains|the Society]]. The [[Philadelphia]] heroine known as [[Liberty Belle (comics)|Liberty Belle]], who gets her powers from the [[Liberty Bell]], attempts to jumpstart her abilities by ringing the bell. However, due to the recent supposed death of [[Uncle Sam (comics)|Uncle Sam]] (who has recently returned in [[DCU: Brave New World|A Brave New World]]), her powers are unfocused, and Blitzkrieg is thought to have been killed by the sonic shockwaves.  He appears again in ''Infinite Crisis #7'' where he is killed by [[Superboy-Prime]] who destroys the Baron's head with his [[heat vision]].

Brutal in her killings, she runs through her victims and turns them into pulp. Her connection to the Baron, if any, save for the same purple lightning symbol, has yet to be revealed.

==Powers and abilities==
Baron Blitzkrieg has enhanced strength, agility and endurance. He wears body armour that offers some protection from physical attack. He has weak heat vision and he can fly.
