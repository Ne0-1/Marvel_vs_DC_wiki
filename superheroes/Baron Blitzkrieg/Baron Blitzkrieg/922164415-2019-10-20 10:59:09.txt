A version of the character named Baron Reiter appeared in the fourth season of the television series ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' played by [[Jimmy Akingbola]].

==Fictional character biography==
He is a frequent opponent of the heroic [[All-Star Squadron]], a band of costumed adventurers who fight domestic and foreign menaces during World War II. Baron Blitzkrieg was originally an especially vicious German army officer who was blinded and disfigured when a concentration camp prisoner threw a bottle in his face. German scientists restored his sight but not his appearance. So they experimented on Blitzkrieg, giving him superhuman strength, invulnerability, optical energy beams and the ability to fly. However, each of these abilities are manifested one at a time and only with training is he able to incorporate them together.

Baron Blitzkrieg is the leader of [[Shadowspire]] and allied with [[Vandal Savage]]'s organization known as Symbolix. Together, they incorporate experimental research which produces the superhero [[Damage (DC comics)|Damage]]. The Baron becomes a recurring foe in Damage's series, starting with issue number three.

During the ''[[Justice Society of America|JSA]]'' tie-in to ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', it is revealed that Baron Blitzkrieg has joined [[Secret Society of Super Villains|the Society]]. The [[Philadelphia]] heroine known as [[Liberty Belle (comics)|Liberty Belle]], who gets her powers from the [[Liberty Bell]], attempts to jumpstart her abilities by ringing the bell. However, due to the recent supposed death of [[Uncle Sam (comics)|Uncle Sam]] (who  later returned in [[DCU: Brave New World|A Brave New World]]), her powers are unfocused, and Blitzkrieg is thought to have been killed by the sonic shockwaves. He appears again in ''Infinite Crisis #7'' where he is killed by [[Superboy-Prime]] who destroys the Baron's head with his [[Infrared vision|heat vision]].

Baron Blitzkrieg has been identified as one of the deceased entombed below the [[Hall of Justice (comics)|Hall of Justice]]. In ''[[Blackest Night]]'' #4, he is revived as a member of the [[Black Lantern Corps]].

He also appeared in ''[[Batman: The Widening Gyre]]'' by [[Kevin Smith]].

===One Year Later===
{{main|One Year Later}}
A new, Nazi-themed speedster supervillain named '''Baroness Blitzkrieg''' recently appeared as a member of The Fourth Reich, a team of Nazi-themed supervillains in ''[[Justice Society of America]]''. Brutal in her killings, she runs through her victims and turns them into pulp.
She is presumably a descendant of the original Baron Blitzkrieg; the Baroness joined the Nazi supervillain group Fourth Reich, and sometime before that group was hired by Vandal Savage to help exterminate the families of old Golden Age superheroes. For her part, the Baroness slaughtered several of the descendants of [[Commander Steel]], but was later beaten by Jay Garrick during an unsuccessful attempt to kill young Mike Dugan, son of retired hero [[Stripesy]] and stepbrother of [[Courtney Whitmore|Stargirl]].

==Powers and abilities==
Baron Blitzkrieg has enhanced strength, agility and endurance. He wore body armor that offered some protection from physical attack. He has heat vision and he can fly.

The pre-[[Crisis On Infinite Earths|Crisis]] version of the character could travel between [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Earth-2]] and [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Earth-X]].

Reiter is a leader of criminal organisation called [[Shadowspire]] where he appeared in flashback, in the episode "A.W.O.L.". [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Oliver Queen]] is sent there to infiltrate them and learn what they're doing there by [[A.R.G.U.S.]]. The harvesting is later revealed to be a front for Reiter while his men look for a magical artifact called the Khushu Idol (which is used frequently by [[Damien Darhk]]). Once Oliver Queen and fellow slave Tania Venediktov finds the map, they begin digging to find it. Eventually, they find it, but Oliver steals it and hides it in some caves then blows the entrance, but Reiter finds the idol and sacrifices two of his men to gain power from it to free himself. In "Schism", a confrontation between Tania, Oliver and Reiter breaks out resulting in Oliver killing Reiter and burying Tania next to his dead father. This version of the character is not German, but African nor is called Baron Blitzkrieg.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/07/22/arrow-season-4-baron-reiter-blitzkrieg|title=Arrow boss explains Baron Reiter casting|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|last=Abrams|first=Natalie|accessdate=August 12, 2015}}</ref>
