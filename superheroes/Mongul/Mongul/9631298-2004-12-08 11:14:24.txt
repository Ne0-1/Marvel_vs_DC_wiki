'''Mongul''' is a fictional [[supervillain]]; considered one of the best, yet lesser known, of [[Superman]]'s enemies. Mongul is noteworthy for being one of the few villains who was actually STRONGER than Superman.

Mongul first appeared in the pages of the [[DC Comics]] Presents [[comic book]] series, in stories written by writer/artist [[Jim Starlin]]. It is apparent that Starlin created Mongul as a version of his other most famous villain character, [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Thanos]], for use in the [[DC Universe]]. However, Mongul is probably best known for his part in the story "For the Man who has Everything" by british writer [[Alan Moore]], which appeared in a Superman Comics [[Annual]], and is considered one of the best Superman stories of all time. Some of the Mongul stories (including For the Man who has Everything) have been adapted into episodes of the [[Justice League]] [[animated series]].

In the comics, Mongul was originally the tyrannical ruler of his own [[alien]] race (who, like him, are yellow-skinned [[humanoid]]s.) He was eventually deposed by a revolution, and Mongul swore he'd reconquer them. To this end he sought the most powerful weapon in the universe: the artificial planet Warworld. To activate it, however, he needed a "key" device, which was under the care of The [[Martian Manhunter]]. Mongul kidnapped three of Superman's friends ([[Lois Lane]], [[Jimmy Olsen]], and [[Steve Lombard]]) to force the hero to get the key for him. Superman fought against and defeated the Manhunter, and obtained the key,. In the subsequent scuffle, the Manhunter rescued Superman's friends, but Mongul escaped with the key. (Note that this story contained several plot holes and character misinterpretations; see discussion.)

Mongul activated Warworld and linked his mind directly to its controls. Warworld was attacked by Superman and [[Supergirl]], and Mongul used its superweapons against them. Almost too late, he realized that the controls' drain on his brain was too strong; however, he managed to escape just before the heroes destroyed Warworld.

Some time later, Mongul again tried to steal a superweapon; this time, it was a planet-destroying ray machine used by the empress of another galaxy to blackmail its citizens into obedience. It was controlled by the empress's crown, which Mongul obtained by killing her, then capturing her brother, the alien superhero [[Starman]], and threatening to kill him unless his lover gave him the crown. He obtained it, but was attacked again by Superman; this proved to be a diversion while Starman destroyed the weapon. Again, Mongul escaped.

Desiring revenge on Superman, Mongul stole a [[Sun-Eater]] from the [[Controller]] who kept it, and tried to use it to devour the Earth's solar system. With help from the [[Legion of Super Heroes]], the Sun-Eater was destroyed (and Superman was finally able to defeat Mongul in hand-to-hand combat.)

In "For the Man who has Everything" Mongul tricks Superman by sending him an alien [[parasite]] disguised as a birthday present. The parasite trapped Superman in a [[coma]], while making him live an imaginary life in his mind, in which [[Krypton]] had never exploded and he had grown to adulthood there.  With help from [[Batman]], [[Robin]] and [[Wonder Woman]] (who had also come to give him birthday presents) Superman escaped the trance and trapped Mongul with his own parasite. 

After DC Comics decided to [[reboot]] their universe (see [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]) the original Mongul stories were no longer valid. Mongul was reintroduced as already having obtained Warworld, and having used it to create his own space empire. He entertained its citizens with [[gladiatorial]] games; the current champion was an alien warrior called [[Draaga]]. Mongul captured Superman for use in the games; the hero ended up joining forces with Draaga and making Mongul flee. (note: this version of Mongul was NOT stronger than him.)

Mongul then joined forces with the [[Cyborg Superman]] in order to gain vengeance on Superman, and also to try to turn the Earth into another Warworld. In the process, [[Green Lantern]] Hal Jordan's home, Coast City, was destroyed, which led to Jordan helping Superman and his allies to defeat him (see [[Death of Superman]].)

Mongul was finally killed by the [[Demon Lord]] [[Neron]] after he refused to join forces with it against Earth's heroes. However, since then, a "son of Mongul" virtually identical to him, has appeared.
