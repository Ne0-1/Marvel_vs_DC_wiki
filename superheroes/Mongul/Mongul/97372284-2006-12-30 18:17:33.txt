'''Mongul''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]] created by [[Jim Starlin]] and [[Len Wein]]. He's notable as one of the few villains to be equally strong as [[Superman]] himself, yet least known, of his enemies.

==Character history==
===Pre-Crisis===

Mongul first appeared in the pages of the ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' [[comic book]] series, in stories written by writer/artist [[Jim Starlin]]. It is apparent that Starlin created Mongul as a version of his most famous villain character, [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Thanos]], for use in the [[DC Universe]] (which is ironic, considering that Thanos originated as an imitation of DC's [[Darkseid]]). However, Mongul is probably best known for his villainous part in [[Alan Moore]]'s story ''[[For the Man Who Has Everything]]'', which appeared in ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]] [[Annual publication|Annual]]'' #11. Some of the Mongul stories (including ''For the Man Who Has Everything'') have been adapted into episodes of the [[Justice League]] [[animated series]].

Unlike Thanos or Darkseid, Mongul is a small-minded, self-centered tyrant who rarely plans beyond his own greed.  While he is very intellligent, he does not have the charisma or personality to inspire the loyalty needed for grand, galactic conquests; rather, he is simply a petty despot who happens to have enormous physical prowess.  This makes it relatively easy for quick-witted superheroes to defeat him using their wits, rather than through brute force.

====Warworld====
In the comics, Mongul was originally the tyrannical ruler of his own [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] race (who, like him, are yellow-skinned [[humanoid]]s.) He was eventually deposed by a revolution and Mongul swore he'd reconquer his subjects. To this end, he sought the most powerful weapon in the Universe: the artificial planet, Warworld. To activate it, however, he needed a "key" device, which was under the care of the [[Martian Manhunter]]. Mongul kidnapped three of Superman's friends ([[Lois Lane]], [[Jimmy Olsen]] and [[Steve Lombard]]) to force the hero to get the key for him. Superman fought against and defeated the Manhunter and obtained the key. In the subsequent scuffle, the Manhunter rescued Superman's friends, but Mongul escaped with the key.

Mongul activated Warworld and linked his mind directly to its controls. Warworld was attacked by Superman and [[Supergirl]] and Mongul used its superweapons against them. Almost too late, he realized that the controls' drain on his brain was too strong; however, he managed to escape just before the heroes destroyed Warworld.

Some time later, Mongul again tried to steal a superweapon; this time, it was a planet-destroying ray machine used by the empress of another galaxy to blackmail its citizens into obedience. It was controlled by the empress's crown. In a plot to obtain the crown, Mongul killed the empress, captured her brother, the alien superhero [[Starman (comics)|Starman]] and threatened to kill him unless Starman's lover gave him the crown. He got the crown, but was attacked again by Superman; this proved to be a diversion while Starman destroyed the weapon. Again, Mongul escaped.

====Sun-Eater====
Desiring revenge on Superman, Mongul stole a [[Sun-Eater]] from the [[Controller (DC comics)| Controller]] who kept it and tried to use it to devour the Earth's solar system. With help from the [[Legion of Super Heroes]], the Sun-Eater was destroyed (and Superman was finally able to defeat Mongul in hand-to-hand combat).

===Post-Crisis===
After DC Comics decided to [[reboot]] their Universe (see [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]), the original Mongul stories were no longer valid. Mongul was reintroduced as already having obtained Warworld and having used it to create his own space empire. He entertained the empire's citizens with [[gladiatorial]] games; the Champion was an alien warrior called [[Draaga]]. Mongul captured Superman for use in the games, but the hero ended up joining forces with Draaga and making Mongul flee. (Note: this version of Mongul was ''not'' stronger than Superman.)

Mongul then joined forces with the [[Cyborg Superman]] in order to gain vengeance on Superman and to try to turn the Earth into another Warworld. In the process, [[Green Lantern]] Hal Jordan's home, Coast City, was destroyed, which led to Jordan joining Superman and his allies to defeat Mongul (see [[Death of Superman]]).

After his defeat, Mongul was imprisoned in a jail for intergalactic criminals, only to break out during a riot. His first target was Green Lantern, who found out that the one who he faced ([[Kyle Rayner]]), was not the one he fought earlier. Even more so, he was easily defeated when Kyle's ring showed no weakness to yellow, something that even shocked the aiding Superman. Following his defeat, he was re-imprisoned.

====Death and legacy====
During the [[Underworld Unleashed]] comic storyline, the Demon Lord [[Neron]] began bargaining souls for great power, all by lighting a candle. Mongul was one of them, but, proud fool that he was, declined. In responce, Neron slew him.

====Mongul II====
Mongul II, the son of the first, appeared to assist and train Superman, in preparation for the forthcoming [[Imperiex]]. He was apparently killed during the conflict, but returned to menace [[Hal Jordan]], the newly-returned Green Lantern, by using the Black Mercy on him and [[Green Arrow]]. In the meantime, he sought his sister, [[Mongal]], to settle family squabbles. The heroes broke free and used a teleporter to transport Mongul and Mongal to their home planet. Stating family to be a weakness, Mongul punched off Mongal's head.

In the animated series ''[[Justice League]]'', Mongul is the ruler of War World and sends Superman to the gladiator pits of his domain. However, he is defeated and disappears until Justice League Unlimited.

In the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' adaptation of the story "For the Man Who Has Everything", Mongul ([[Eric Roberts]]) tricked Superman by sending him an alien [[parasite]] disguised as a birthday present. The parasite trapped Superman in a [[coma]], while making him live an imaginary life in his mind, a life in which [[Krypton]] had never exploded and he had grown to adulthood there. With help from [[Batman]] and [[Wonder Woman]] (who had also come to give him birthday presents), Superman escaped the trance, in part with his fantasy world subconsciously and gradually subverted into a nightmare of social chaos and trapped Mongul with his own parasite. This story was based on the 1985 Superman Annual by [[Alan Moore]] and [[Dave Gibbons]], replacing Robin (Jason Todd)'s role to add more of Wonder Woman's response to Mongul's sexist prodding.

Mongul also appeared in the [[Superman Returns (video game)|Superman Returns]] video game as one of the major villains of the story.
