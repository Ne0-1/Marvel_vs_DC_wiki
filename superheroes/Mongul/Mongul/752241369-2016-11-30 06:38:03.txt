'''Mongul''' is the name of two [[fictional character]]s that appear in [[comic books]] published by [[DC Comics]]. Writer [[Len Wein]] and artist [[Jim Starlin]] created the first version of the character, who debuted in ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' #27 (Nov. 1980). Writer [[Peter J. Tomasi]] and artist [[Scot Eaton]] created the second version, who first appeared in ''Showcase '95'' #8 (Sept. 1995) as an infant.

Debuting in the [[Bronze Age of comic books]], Mongul has been featured in other DC Comics-endorsed products such as [[animated]] [[television series]]; [[video game]]s; a [[Direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]] film, and merchandise such as [[action figures]] and [[trading cards]].

== Publication history ==
Mongul debuted in the title ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' and was created by writer [[Len Wein]] and artist [[Jim Starlin]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Manning|first= Matthew K.|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1980s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 188 |quote = Artist Jim Starlin displayed his penchant for portraying powerful cosmic villains with the debut of Mongul, a new threat to plague Superman's life, in a story written by Len Wein.}}</ref> Starlin often receives credit as creator of the character, but Wein in an interview stated "Well, [Mongul] had Starlin visuals, but he was my creation." Wein said he conceived Mongul specifically as a villain to physically challenge [[Superman]].<ref>Interview with Lein Wein from ''The Krypton Companion''</ref>

==Fictional character biography==

===Bronze Age (1980-1985)===
Mongul was the ruler of his own alien race until a [[revolution]] occurred, and he was exiled into outer space.<ref name="DCCP28">''DC Comics Presents'' #28</ref> In his first appearance, Mongul kidnaps [[Superman]]'s friends ([[Lois Lane]], [[Jimmy Olsen]] and [[Steve Lombard]]), threatening to kill them unless the hero brings him the key that can activate the artificial planet [[Warworld]]. After retrieving the key,<ref name="DCCP27">''DC Comics Presents'' #27</ref> he activates Warworld. Psychically linked with its controls, Mongul tries to destroy Superman and [[Supergirl]]. Mongul is ultimately rendered unconscious by a massive mental strain caused from using its controls, but manages to escape before the heroes destroy Warworld.<ref name="DCCP28"/>

Mongul then tries to conquer Throneworld, the home planet of [[Starman (comics)#Prince Gavyn|Prince Gavyn]], one of the heroes who have used the name [[Starman (comics)|Starman]]. Mongul murders Gavyn's sister and forces his love into marrying him in order to usurp the throne of the empire for himself. He uses Throneworld's planet-destroying weapon to blackmail the resident planets into obedience. Superman arrives and battles Mongul, while Starman disables the weapon. Mongul retreats.<ref name="DCCP36">''DC Comics Presents'' #36</ref> Now wanting revenge on Superman, Mongul kills a [[Controller (DC Comics)|Controller]] and steals the [[Sun-Eater]] to devour the Earth's sun. While the [[Justice League of America]] and [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] battle Mongul, Superman finally defeats him as the Legion destroys the Sun-Eater.<ref name="DCCP43">''DC Comics Presents'' #43</ref>

Mongul eventually attacks Superman on his birthday and ensnares him with a Black Mercy, an alien plant that fed off a victims "bio-aura" while rendering the victim incapable of fighting back, giving them their own perfect "dream world" in return. In the end, thanks to [[Robin (Jason Todd)|Robin]], Mongul becomes the plant's next victim and dreams of himself as ruler of the universe.<ref>''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]] [[Annual publication|Annual]]'' #11 ''[[For the Man Who Has Everything]]''</ref> The story "[[For the Man Who Has Everything]]" was written by [[Alan Moore]] and illustrated by [[Dave Gibbons]].

===Modern Age (1985-Present)===
After the 12-issue [[limited series]] ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', DC Comics [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] the histories of some major characters to update them for contemporary audiences. The original stories involving Mongul were no longer in continuity, and the character was reintroduced as the ruler of Warworld, a space empire where Mongul entertains the citizens with [[gladiator]]ial games. Mongul captures Superman for use in the games, but Superman joins forces with an alien warrior called [[Draaga]] and makes Mongul flee. Mongul is then persuaded via torture to serve the [[Hank Henshaw|Cyborg Superman]] to gain vengeance on Superman and to try to turn the Earth into another Warworld. In the process, [[Green Lantern]] Hal Jordan's home, [[Coast City]], is destroyed, which leads to Jordan joining Superman and his allies to defeat Mongul.

After his defeat, Mongul is imprisoned for intergalactic criminals only to break out during a riot. His first target is Green Lantern; he learns that the one whom he faced ([[Kyle Rayner]]), is not the one he fought earlier. Mongul is defeated when Kyle's ring shows no weakness to yellow. Mongul is re-imprisoned.

Mongul breaks out of the Lunar penal colony, killing everyone there including prisoners who are left to die in the vacuum of space. His ship is almost wrecked and he is near death; he is teleported to a planet and saved. In return, he takes over the planet and ends up being left alone as the inhabitants prefer dying due to a virus than his tyranny. Until he ends up finding two babies immune to the virus (a story started in Showcase 95 #7, with the two babies appearing in Showcase 95 #8; reprinted in DC Universe Special Superman #1).

Mongul is later defeated on Earth by [[Wally West]] (the Flash) when Mongul tries to unearth a starship left from one of the [[Darkstars]]' enemies underneath Keystone City. The Flash easily defeats Mongul. The Flash seemingly uses Mongul to test his new upgraded powers. During the battle, Wally is only hit one time by the giant hulking Mongul. Flash uses his super speed to quickly confuse and defeat Mongul and has him imprisoned in the Slab, a prison for super villains  (Flash #102, reprinted in DC Universe Special Superman #1).

During the ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'' storyline, the Demon Lord [[Neron (DC comics)|Neron]] offers supervillains (including Mongul) enhanced power in exchange for their souls, all by lighting a candle. Mongul's pride causes him to decline the offer and threatens Neron. In response, Neron beats Mongul to death for his defiance, taking his soul in the process.

====Son of Mongul====
Mongul's son, also named Mongul, appears to assist and train Superman, in preparation for the arrival of [[Imperiex]].<ref>''Superman vol 2'' #153 (February 2000)</ref> This Mongul seems to be more powerful than his father. He appears to have been killed later in the ''[[Our Worlds at War]]'' crossover, but returns during ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' after learning from [[Despero]] that the Justice League has apparently been destroyed. His intention is to loot their Watchtower headquarters but he ends up fighting [[Batman]], [[Superman]], and [[Wonder Woman]]. He is almost killed by Wonder Woman before escaping via a working teleporter.<ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #1</ref> The teleportation transports him to Earth, to menace [[Hal Jordan]], the newly returned [[Green Lantern]], by using the Black Mercy on him and [[Green Arrow]].<ref>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #7</ref> In the meantime, he seeks his sister, [[Mongal]], to settle family squabbles. The heroes break free and use a teleporter to transport Mongul and Mongal to their home planet. Stating family to be a weakness, Mongul decapitates Mongal with a single blow to her head.<ref name="Green Lantern vol. 4 #8">''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #8</ref>

Mongul's origins depicts him as a child who wanted to be like his father. He made journeys and he watched digital renderings where his father fought against [[For the Man Who Has Everything|Superman and his allies]] and [[Emerald Twilight|the destruction of Coast City]]. He copies his father's actions when he encounters a group of aliens whose spaceship crashes on Arkymandryte, turning them into his slaves. Mongul's father returns, and discovering his son's slaves, he kills the aliens and tells him only one being on the planet is worthy of adoration.<ref>''Blackest Night: Tales of the Corps'' #1</ref>

Mongul receives a Yellow [[Power Ring (weapon)|power ring]] after breaking a dying [[Sinestro Corps]] member's neck<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #19</ref> (a later promotional image shows Mongul with the Yellow ring as well a [[Green Lantern Corps]] ring).<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #20</ref> Mongul offers the Sinestro Corps inductees a choice: to serve him or die. He removes the ring from each one who refuses, and at one point had gained an extra five rings. He then attacks [[Arisia Rrab|Arisia]] and [[Sodam Yat]] with Black Mercy plants, and takes them prisoner.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #23</ref><ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #24</ref> He uses his ring to send thousands of Black Mercy seeds, which he had genetically engineered to bring the victims greatest fears to life, instead of their dreams, to several unsuspecting planets. In a confrontation with several members of the Green Lantern Corps, Mongul is defeated when the fly-like Lantern [[List of Green Lanterns#Bzzd|Bzzd]] flies through his eye, and he is thrown down to the [[List of Green Lanterns#Mother Mercy|Black Mercy]]'s planet. He is last seen buried in soil, being used as food by the Black Mercys.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #25</ref><ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #26</ref> However, he soon breaks free and escapes the planet, while keeping his rings and his right arm. His left arm had been severed in the process, but, through the power of his rings, Mongul is able to control and direct it.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #27</ref> He attacks a nearby ship to get food for himself, killing the husband of the pilot. This inadvertently causes the woman to become the first recruit of the [[Star Sapphire (comics)|Star Sapphires]], the violet Power Ring having been drawn to her by the void in her heart created by her loss.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #29</ref> Mongul uses his left arm to invade the planet [[Daxam]] and establish it as the new homeworld for his faction of the Sinestro Corps under his command.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #31</ref> However, he is challenged for the leadership by [[Enkafos|Arkillo]].<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #33</ref> Defeating him in single combat, Mongul pulls out Arkillo's tongue and wears it as a necklace. In the process, he gains the loyalty of the faction of the Sinestro Corps loyal to Arkillo and complete rule over the planet Daxam, but draws on himself the attentions of Arisia and Sodam Yat, the Daxamite host for the [[Ion (DC Comics)|Ion Entity]]. Upon the arrival of Arisia and Yat, several members of the Sinestro Corps are swiftly defeated and killed by Yat until his Superman-like powers fade under Daxam's red sun. Despite his power loss and Mongul's incredible strength, Yat does battle with him, using the Ion power to briefly launch Mongul into space, before entering Daxam's sun and transforming it from red to yellow, granting all Daxamites superpowers.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #34</ref><ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #36</ref> The Daxamite's overwhelming attack forces Mongul to have the Sinestro Corps abandon Daxam, with the despot planning to make a different planet their home base.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #37</ref><ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #38</ref>

Mongul takes the Sinestro Corps to [[Korugar]], Sinestro's homeworld, having the inhabitants strung up along the streets. He also decides to rename the Yellow lanterns as "[[Sinestro Corps|The Mongul Corps]]", after himself.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #39</ref> Soon after, [[Sinestro]] is brought to Korugar and confronts Mongul. Then, using an [[wikt:override|override]] built into Mongul's rings, Sinestro defeats him, thus reclaiming the Sinestro Corps. Then, he imprisons  Mongul in the Corps' central power battery, intending to kill him once the Black Lantern Corps is dealt with.<ref>''Green Lantern'' (Vol. 4) #46</ref>

====New-52====
Mongul is reintroduced within the new universe created after [[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]] event, where he is once again reintroduced as lord and master of the planetary siege engine [[Warworld]]. Here in his introduction he is laying waste to a planet he is poised to conquer as he brought a resisting general aboard his vessal in order to show him the devastation of his home world just before decapitating him and adding his remains to a trophy room on his arsenalized planet.<ref>''Green Lantern'' (Vol. 5) #23.3</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
During the Bronze [[Bronze Age of Comic Books|Age of comic books]], Mongul was stronger than Superman and almost totally invulnerable to harm.<ref name="DCCP36"/><ref name="DCCP43"/> Superman defeated him by foiling his schemes, but only once defeated Mongul in hand-to-hand combat. Even then, Superman fell unconscious immediately after.<ref name="DCCP43"/> Mongul also demonstrated the ability to [[Teleportation|teleport]];<ref name="DCCP36"/> limited [[telepathy]] and [[Telekinesis]];<ref name="DCCP43"/> and could project blasts of potent force via his eyes,<ref name="DCCP27"/> hands,<ref name="DCCP36"/> or chest. The character also used technology to shrink his enemies and place them in dimensional-inversion cubes designed to prevent escape by warping their interior reality and absorbing any power used against them from within.<ref name="DCCP43"/> The [[Modern Age of Comic Books|Modern Age]] Mongul the Elder version started off with less power than the silver age but was still a formidable foe and a capable match up against Superman on multiple occasions if, albeit, slightly weaker.

Mongul was able to resist half-power Kryptonian heat vision at point-blank range and, thanks to his enhanced musculature, was incredibly resilient to physical harm. Because of his impressive muscle structure, Mongul was also incredibly fast, and able to push himself forward at high speed while running or able to leap several miles into the air by his powerful legs. He also had his chest cannon with which he could fire potent energy blasts that could stagger or kill even Superman. So formidable a foe was he that Mongul could not only trade blows with Kryptonians but repeatedly battle Green Lanterns on a regular basis; especially given that his natural yellow skin gave him protection against their rings. He was still outclassed, though, by individuals of greater capability (be it physical or technological in nature), such as Hank Henshaw (before and after his acquisition of Superman's genetic template) and the demon Neron (who killed him with his bare hands).

His progeny Mongul II, however, showed himself to either be on equal footing or in greater strength than even his father. Having demonstrated strength enough for defeating DC Universe heavy-hitters like Wonder Woman (Infinite Crisis issue 1, December 2005), along with killing members of both the Green Lantern & Sinestro Corps in his pursuit of power rings. He was strong enough to decapitate and kill his sister Mongal in one blow.<ref name="Green Lantern vol. 4 #8"/> When acquiring his first Yellow Lantern ring, he decided to learn about its potential for 96 hours, hinting at a methodical mindset mostly absent from Yellow Lanterns. Mongul II also battled Superman, leading to his defeat after both delivered many blows, leading to Superman unleashing a massive combination attack required to overpower this villain (Superman #152, January 2000). This battle displayed him having an endurance to massive blows from a being as powerful as Superman. After having obtained several Qwardian Power Rings, he showed a rather avid usage of their power for numerous effects (i.e., having used them along with his father's innate knowledge of the Black Mercy to modify the plant's parasitic behavioral patterns inducing frightful mirages over happy fantasies; create and manipulate fear driven constructs powerful enough to batter an ion empowered Sodom Yat; and reattach destroyed or removed limbs or body parts via precise fear energy material rearrangement).

In the [[The New 52|new universe]] Mongul has been radically re-imagined from being the formidable adversary he once was during the Bronze-Silver Ages. Now back in control over Warworld, he again started cutting a bloody swath across the universe conquering planet after planet with his cosmic dreadnaught. When he makes his way to Earth, he showcases extreme levels of super strength and resilience as he gets into a colossal battle between Superman and an empowered Batman who, at the time, had Kryptonian-like power sets.<ref>''batman/Superman'' (vol. 1) #7</ref> Kal-El once stated him to be about as strong as [[Darkseid]]; proven true in a number of cases where he showed his might by fighting off an entire brigade of yellow lanterns backed by a New God within their ranks.<ref>''Sinestro'' (vol. 1) #10</ref> He still retains his chest cannon which can still blow away multiple personages in one blast as well as heat vision to incinerate his enemies.<ref>''Sinestro'' (vol. 1) #9</ref>
