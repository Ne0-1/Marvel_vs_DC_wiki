== Publication history ==
Mongul debuted in the title ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' and was created by writer [[Len Wein]] and artist [[Jim Starlin]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Manning|first= Matthew K.|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1980s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 188 |quote = Artist Jim Starlin displayed his penchant for portraying powerful cosmic villains with the debut of Mongul, a new threat to plague Superman's life, in a story written by Len Wein.}}</ref> Starlin often receives credit as creator of the character, but Wein in an interview stated "Well, [Mongul] had Starlin visuals, but he was my creation." Wein said he conceived Mongul specifically as a villain to physically challenge [[Superman]].<ref>Interview with Lein Wein from ''The Krypton Companion''</ref>

==Fictional character biography==

===Bronze Age (1980-1985)===
Mongul was originally the ruler of his own alien race until a [[revolution]] occurred and he was exiled into outer space.<ref name="DCCP28">''DC Comics Presents'' #28</ref> In his first appearance, Mongul kidnaps [[Superman]]'s friends ([[Lois Lane]], [[Jimmy Olsen]] and [[Steve Lombard]]), threatening to kill them unless the hero brings him the key that can activate the artificial planet [[Warworld]]. After retrieving the key,<ref name="DCCP27">''DC Comics Presents'' #27</ref> the character activates Warworld; psychically linked with its controls, Mongul attempts to destroy Superman and [[Supergirl]]. Mongul is ultimately rendered unconscious by a massive mental strain caused from using its controls, but managed to escape before the heroes destroy Warworld.<ref name="DCCP28"/>

Mongul then attempts to conquer Throneworld, the home planet of [[Starman (comics)#Prince Gavyn|Prince Gavyn]], one of the heroes who have used the name [[Starman (comics)|Starman]]. Mongul murders Gavyn's sister and forcing his love into marrying him in order to usurp the throne of the empire for himself. He then uses Throneworld's planet-destroying weapon to blackmail the resident planets into obedience. However, Superman arrives and battles Mongul while Starman disables the weapon, and Mongul retreats.<ref name="DCCP36">''DC Comics Presents'' #36</ref> Mongul, now desiring revenge on Superman, kills a [[Controller (DC Comics)|Controller]] and steals the [[Sun-Eater]] to devour the Earth's sun. While the [[Justice League of America]] and [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] battle Mongul to no avail, Superman finally defeats him as the Legion destroys the Sun-Eater.<ref name="DCCP43">''DC Comics Presents'' #43</ref>

Mongul eventually attacks Superman on his birthday and ensnares him with a Black Mercy, an alien plant that fed off a victims "bio-aura" while rendering the victim incapable of fighting back, giving them their own perfect "dream world" in return. In the end, thanks to Robin, Mongul becomes the plant's next victim and dreams of himself as ruler of the universe.<ref>''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]] [[Annual publication|Annual]]'' #11 ''[[For the Man Who Has Everything]]''</ref> The story "[[For the Man Who Has Everything]]" was written by [[Alan Moore]] and illustrated by [[Dave Gibbons]], and has become the pivotal Mongul story.

===Modern Age (1985-Present)===
After the 12-issue [[limited series]] ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', DC Comics [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] the histories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences, the original stories involving Mongul were no longer valid and the character was reintroduced as the ruler of Warworld, a space empire where Mongul  entertained the citizens with [[gladiator]]ial games. Mongul captured Superman for use in the games, but the hero ended up joining forces with alien warrior called [[Draaga]] and making Mongul flee. Mongul was then persuaded via torture to serve the [[Hank Henshaw|Cyborg Superman]] in order to gain vengeance on Superman and to try to turn the Earth into another Warworld. In the process, [[Green Lantern]] Hal Jordan's home, [[Coast City]], was destroyed, which led to Jordan joining Superman and his allies to defeat Mongul.

After his defeat, Mongul was imprisoned in a jail for intergalactic criminals, only to break out during a riot. His first target was Green Lantern; he found out that the one whom he faced ([[Kyle Rayner]]), was not the one he fought earlier. Mongul was defeated when Kyle's ring showed no weakness to yellow, something that even shocked the aiding Superman. Following his defeat, he was re-imprisoned.

Mongul breaks out of the Lunar penal colony he was in, killing everyone there including prisoners who are left to die in the vacuum of space. His ship is almost wrecked and he is near death; he is teleported to a planet and saved. In return, he takes over the planet and ends up being left alone as the inhabitants prefer dying due to a virus than his tyranny. Until he ends up finding two babies immune to the virus (a story started in Showcase 95 #7, with the two babies appearing in Showcase 95 #8; reprinted in DC Universe Special Superman #1).

Mongul is later defeated on Earth by [[Wally West]] (the Flash) when Mongul tries to unearth a starship left from one of the [[Darkstars]]' enemies underneath Keystone City. The Flash easily defeats Mongul. The Flash seemingly uses Mongul to test his new upgraded powers. During the battle, Wally is only hit one time by the giant hulking Mongul. Flash uses his super speed to quickly confuse and defeat Mongul and has him imprisoned in the Slab, a prison for super villains  (Flash #102, reprinted in DC Universe Special Superman #1).

During the ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'' storyline, the Demon Lord [[Neron]] began offering supervillains enhanced power in exchange for their souls, all by lighting a candle. Mongul was one of those offered the deal, but his pride caused him to decline the offer and threaten Neron. In response, Neron easily beat Mongul to death for his defiance, taking his soul in the process.

====Son of Mongul====
Mongul's son, also named Mongul, appears to assist and train Superman, in preparation for the arrival of [[Imperiex]].<ref>''Superman vol 2'' #153 (February 2000)</ref> This Mongul seems to be more powerful than his father. He appears to have been killed later in the ''[[Our Worlds at War]]'' crossover, but returns during ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' after learning from [[Despero]] that the Justice League has apparently been destroyed. His intention is to loot their Watchtower headquarters but he ends up fighting [[Batman]], [[Superman]], and [[Wonder Woman]]. He is almost killed by Wonder Woman before escaping via a working teleporter.<ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #1</ref> The teleportation transports him to Earth, to menace [[Hal Jordan]], the newly returned [[Green Lantern]], by using the Black Mercy on him and [[Green Arrow]].<ref>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #7</ref> In the meantime, he seeks his sister, [[Mongal]], to settle family squabbles. The heroes break free and use a teleporter to transport Mongul and Mongal to their home planet. Stating family to be a weakness, Mongul decapitates Mongal with a single blow to her head.<ref>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #8</ref>

Mongul's origins depicts him as a child who wanted to be like his father. He made journeys and he watched digital renderings where his father fought against [[For the Man Who Has Everything|Superman and his allies]] and [[Emerald Twilight|the destruction of Coast City]]. He copies his father's actions when he encounters a group of aliens whose spaceship crashes on Arkymandryte, turning them into his slaves. Mongul's father returns, and discovering his son's slaves, he kills the aliens and tells him only one being on the planet is worthy of adoration.<ref>''Blackest Night: Tales of the Corps'' #1</ref>

Mongul receives a Yellow [[Power Ring (weapon)|power ring]] after breaking a dying [[Sinestro Corps]] member's neck<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #19</ref> (a later promotional image shows Mongul with the Yellow ring as well a [[Green Lantern Corps]] ring).<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #20</ref> Mongul offers the Sinestro Corps inductees a choice: to serve him or die. He removes the ring from each one who refuses, and at one point had gained an extra five rings. He then attacks [[Arisia Rrab|Arisia]] and [[Sodam Yat]] with Black Mercy plants, and takes them prisoner.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #23</ref><ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #24</ref> He uses his ring to send thousands of Black Mercy seeds, which he had genetically engineered to bring the victims greatest fears to life, instead of their dreams, to several unsuspecting planets. In a confrontation with several members of the Green Lantern Corps, Mongul is defeated when the fly-like Lantern [[List of Green Lanterns#Bzzd|Bzzd]] flies through his eye, and he is thrown down to the [[List of Green Lanterns#Mother Mercy|Black Mercy]]'s planet. He is last seen buried in soil, being used as food by the Black Mercys.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #25</ref><ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #26</ref> However, he soon breaks free and escapes the planet, while keeping his rings and his right arm. His left arm had been severed in the process, but, through the power of his rings, Mongul is able to control and direct it.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #27</ref> He attacks a nearby ship to get food for himself, killing the husband of the pilot. This inadvertently causes the woman to become the first recruit of the [[Star Sapphires]], the violet Power Ring having been drawn to her by the void in her heart created by her loss.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #29</ref> Mongul uses his left arm to invade the planet [[Daxam]] and establish it as the new homeworld for his faction of the Sinestro Corps under his command.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #31</ref> However, he is challenged for the leadership by [[Enkafos|Arkillo]].<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #33</ref> Defeating him in single combat, Mongul pulls out Arkillo's tongue and wears it as a necklace. In the process, he gains the loyalty of the faction of the Sinestro Corps loyal to Arkillo and complete rule over the planet Daxam, but draws on himself the attentions of Arisia and Sodam Yat, the Daxamite host for the [[Ion (DC Comics)|Ion Entity]]. Upon the arrival of Arisia and Yat, several members of the Sinestro Corps are swiftly defeated and killed by Yat until his Superman-like powers fade under Daxam's red sun. Despite his power loss and Mongul's incredible strength, Yat does battle with him, using the Ion power to briefly launch Mongul into space, before entering Daxam's sun and transforming it from red to yellow, granting all Daxamites superpowers.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #34</ref><ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #36</ref> The Daxamite's overwhelming attack forces Mongul to have the Sinestro Corps abandon Daxam, with the despot planning to make a different planet their home base.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #37</ref><ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #38</ref>

Mongul takes the Sinestro Corps to [[Korugar]], Sinestro's homeworld, having the inhabitants strung up along the streets. He also decides to rename the Sinestro Corps as "[[The Mongul Corps]]", after himself.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #39</ref> Soon after, [[Sinestro]] is brought to Korugar and confronts Mongul. Then, using an [[wikt:override|override]] built into Mongul's rings, Sinestro defeats him, thus reclaiming the Sinestro Corps. Then, he imprisons  Mongul in the Corps' central power battery, intending to kill him once the Black Lantern Corps is dealt with.<ref>''Green Lantern'' (Vol. 4) #46</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
During the Bronze [[Bronze Age of Comic Books|Age of comic books]], Mongul was written as physically more powerful than Superman and as almost totally invulnerable to harm.<ref name="DCCP36"/><ref name="DCCP43"/> While the character was defeated only by Superman foiling his schemes, the hero managed once to defeat Mongul in hand-to-hand combat, although fell unconscious immediately after that.<ref name="DCCP43"/> In addition, Mongul demonstrated the ability to [[Teleportation|teleport]];<ref name="DCCP36"/> limited [[telepathy]];<ref name="DCCP43"/> and could project blasts of potent force via his eyes  <ref name="DCCP27"/> or hands.<ref name="DCCP36"/> The character also used technology to shrink his enemies and place them in dimensional-inversion cubes, designed to prevent escape by warping their interior reality and absorbing any power used against them from within.<ref name="DCCP43"/>

The [[Modern Age of Comic Books|Modern Age]] version of Mongul started off with less power than Mongul I. But then he demonstrated strength not realized earlier by defeating DC Universe heavy-hitters like Wonder Woman (Infinite Crisis issue 1, December 2005), along with killing members of the Sinestro Corps in his pursuit of power rings. When acquiring his first Yellow Lantern ring he decided to learn about its potential for 96 hours, hinting at a methodical mindset mostly absent from Yellow Lanterns. Mongul II also battled Superman, leading to his defeat after both delivered many blows leading to Superman unleashing a massive combination attack required to overpower this villain (Superman #152, January 2000). This battle displayed an endurance to massive blows from a being as powerful as Superman.

===Television===
* Mongul appears in the [[animated]] [[television series]] ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' and ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' voiced by [[Eric Roberts]]. In it, he is the dictator of 'war world,' holding Gladiatorial type games to keep the masses appeased with his rule, being considered the most powerful being on the planet, having never lost a match, but more than willing to resort to trickery to win. He is defeated by Superman and Draaga, and appears later in ''Justice League Unlimited'' when the "For the Man Who Has Everything" story is adapted into an episode of the same name, albeit with [[Jason Todd|Robin]] being written out. Mongul is defeated in the same way as in the original story, and the defeat remains his ultimate fate in the [[DC Animated Universe]], never returning to threaten again.

While the Justice League defend the Earth against Warworld, the Team manages to infiltrate Warworld in order to confront Mongul and shut down Warworld. [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]], [[Roy Harper (comics)|Arsenal]], and [[Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark)|Wonder Girl]] confront Mongul, who defeats them as he plans to use all the weapons of Warworld on Earth.
