'''Mongul''' is the name of two [[fictional character]]s that appear in [[comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. The original Mongul first appeared in ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' #27 (November 1980), and was created by [[Jim Starlin]] and [[Len Wein]]. The second Mongul, the son of the first, first appeared in ''Showcase '95'' #8 and was created by [[Jeph Loeb]].

In 2009, Mongul was ranked as [[IGN]]'s 41st Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.<ref>[http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/41.html Mongul is number 41 ], [[IGN]].</ref>

== Fictional character biography ==
=== Pre-Crisis ===
Mongul was originally the tyrannical ruler of his own [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] race. He was eventually deposed by a revolution led by an ancient mystic known as the Arkymandryte, Mongul fled the theocratic [[coup]] with a small trusted crew and swore that he would reconquer his subjects. To this end, he sought the most powerful weapon in the Universe: the artificial planet, [[Warworld]]. To activate it, however, he needs a "key" device, which is under the care of the [[Martian Manhunter]]. Mongul kidnapped three of Superman's friends ([[Lois Lane]], [[Jimmy Olsen]], and Steve Lombard) to force the hero to get the key for him. Superman fought against and defeated the Manhunter and obtained the key. In the subsequent scuffle, the Manhunter rescued Superman's friends, but Mongul escaped with the key. Mongul activated Warworld and linked his mind directly to its controls. Warworld was attacked by Superman and [[Supergirl]] and Mongul used its superweapons against them. Almost too late, he realized that the controls' drain on his brain was too strong; however, he managed to escape just before the heroes destroyed Warworld.

Some time later, Mongul again tried to steal a superweapon; this time, it was a planet-destroying ray machine used by the empress of another galaxy to blackmail its citizens into obedience. It was controlled by the empress' crown. In a plot to obtain the crown, Mongul killed the empress, captured her brother, the alien superhero [[Starman (comics)|Starman]] and threatened to kill him unless Starman's lover gave him the crown. He got the crown, but was attacked again by Superman; this proved to be a diversion while Starman destroyed the weapon. Again, Mongul escaped.{{Issue|date=August 2009}}

Desiring revenge on Superman, Mongul steals a [[Sun-Eater]] from the [[Controller (DC Comics)|Controller]] who kept it and tried to use it to devour the Earth's solar system. With help from the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]], the Sun-Eater was destroyed (and Superman was finally able to defeat Mongul in hand-to-hand combat).{{Issue|date=August 2009}}

Mongul is probably best known for his villainous part in [[Alan Moore]]'s story "[[For the Man Who Has Everything]]," which appeared in ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]] [[Annual publication|Annual]]'' #11.

=== Post-Crisis ===
After DC Comics decided to [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]] their Universe (see ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''), the original Mongul stories were no longer valid (with the exception of ''For The Man Who Has Everything''). Mongul was reintroduced as already having obtained Warworld and having used it to create his own space empire. He entertained the empire's citizens with [[gladiator]]ial games; the champion was an alien warrior called [[Draaga]]. Mongul captured Superman for use in the games, but the hero ended up joining forces with Draaga and making Mongul flee. Mongul was then persuaded via torture to serve the [[Hank Henshaw|Cyborg Superman]] in order to gain vengeance on Superman and to try to turn the Earth into another Warworld. In the process, [[Green Lantern]] Hal Jordan's home, [[Coast City]], was destroyed, which led to Jordan joining Superman and his allies to defeat Mongul (see ''[[The Death of Superman]]''). After his defeat, Mongul was imprisoned in a jail for intergalactic criminals, only to break out during a riot. His first target was Green Lantern; he found out that the one whom he faced ([[Kyle Rayner]]), was not the one he fought earlier. He was defeated when Kyle's ring showed no weakness to yellow, something that even shocked the aiding Superman. Following his defeat, he was re-imprisoned. 

Mongul breaks out of the Lunar penal colony he was in, killing everyone there including prisoners who are left to die in the vacuum of space. His ship is almost wrecked and he is near death; he is teleported to a planet and saved. In return, he takes over the planet and ends up being left alone as the inhabitants prefer dying due to a virus than his tyranny until he ends up finding two babies immune to the virus (Showcase 95 #7-8, reprinted in DC Universe Special Superman #1).
Mongul is later defeated on Earth by the [[Wally West|Flash]] when Mongul tries to unearth a starship left from one the [[Darkstars]]' enemies underneath Keystone City. The Flash easily defeats Mongul. The Flash seemingly uses Mongul to test his new upgraded powers and during the battle, Wally is only hit one time by the giant hulking Mongul. Flash then uses his super speed to quickly confuse and defeat Mongul and has him imprisoned in the Slab, a prison for supervillains  (Flash #102, reprinted in DC Universe Special Superman #1).

During the ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'' storyline, the Demon Lord [[Neron]] began offering supervillains enhanced power in exchange for their souls, all by lighting a candle. Mongul was one of those offered the deal, but his pride caused him to decline the offer and threaten Neron. In response, Neron easily beat Mongul to death for his defiance, taking his soul in the process.

====Son of Mongul ====
Mongul's son, also named Mongul, appears to assist and train Superman, in preparation for the arrival of [[Imperiex]]. This Mongul seems to be more powerful than his father. He appears to have been killed later in the ''[[Our Worlds at War]]'' crossover, but returns during ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' after learning from [[Despero]] that the Justice League has apparently been destroyed. His intention is to loot their Watchtower headquarters but he ends up fighting [[Batman]], [[Superman]], and [[Wonder Woman]]. He is almost killed by Wonder Woman before escaping via a working teleporter.<ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #1</ref> The teleportation transports him to Earth, to menace [[Hal Jordan]], the newly-returned [[Green Lantern]], by using the Black Mercy on him and [[Green Arrow]].<ref>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #7</ref> In the meantime, he seeks his sister, [[Mongal]], to settle family squabbles. The heroes break free and use a teleporter to transport Mongul and Mongal to their home planet. Stating family to be a weakness, Mongul decapitates Mongal with a single blow to her head.<ref>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #8</ref>

Mongul's origins depicts him as a child who wanted to be like his father. He made journeys and he watched digital renderings where his father fought against [[For the Man Who Has Everything|Superman and his allies]] and [[Emerald Twilight|the destruction of Coast City]]. He copies his father's actions when he encounters a group of aliens whose spaceship crashes on Arkymandryte, turning them into his slaves. Mongul's father returns, and discovering his son's slaves, he kills the aliens and tells him only one being on the planet is worthy of adoration.<ref>''Blackest Night: Tales of the Corps'' #1</ref>
Mongul receives a Yellow [[Power Ring (weapon)|power ring]] after breaking a dying [[Sinestro Corps]] member's neck<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #19</ref> (a later promotional image shows Mongul with the Yellow ring as well a [[Green Lantern Corps]] ring.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #20</ref> Mongul offers the Sinestro Corps inductees a choice: to serve him or die. He removes the ring from each one who refuses, and at the moment has gained an extra five rings. He then attacks [[Arisia Rrab|Arisia]] and [[Sodam Yat]] with Black Mercy plants, and takes them prisoner.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #23</ref><ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #24</ref> He uses his ring to send thousands of Black Mercy seeds, which he had genetically engineered to bring the victims greatest fears to life, instead of their dreams, to several unsuspecting planets. In a confrontation with several members of the Green Lantern Corps, Mongul is defeated when the fly-like Lantern [[List of Green Lanterns#Bzzd|Bzzd]] flies through his eye, and he is thrown down to the [[List of Green Lanterns#Mother Mercy|Black Mercy]]'s planet. He is last seen buried in soil, being used as food by the Black Mercys.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #25</ref><ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #26</ref> However, he soon breaks free and escapes the planet, while keeping his rings and his right arm. His left arm had been severed in the process, but, through the power of his rings, Mongul is able to control and direct it.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #27</ref> He attacks a nearby ship to get food for himself, killing the husband of the pilot. This inadvertently causes the woman to become the first recruit of the [[Star Sapphire (comics)#Star Sapphires|Star Sapphires]], the violet Power Ring having been drawn to her by the void in her heart created by her loss.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #29</ref> Mongul uses his left arm to invade the planet [[Daxam]] and establish it as the new homeworld for his faction of the Sinestro Corps under his command.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #31</ref> However, he is challenged for the leadership by [[Sinestro Corps#Ring bearers|Arkillo]].<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #33</ref> Defeating him in single combat, Mongul pulls out Arkillo's tongue and wears it as a necklace. In the process, he gains the loyalty of the faction of the Sinestro Corps loyal to Arkillo and complete rule over the planet Daxam, but draws on himself the attentions of Arisia and Sodam Yat, the Daxamite host for the [[Ion (comics)|Ion Entity]]. Upon the arrival of Arisia and Yat, several members of the Sinestro Corps are swiftly defeated and killed by Yat until his Superman-like powers fade under Daxam's red sun. Despite his power loss and Mongul's incredible strength, Yat does battle with him, using the Ion power to briefly launch Mongul into space, before entering Daxam's sun and transforming it from red to yellow, granting all Daxamite's superpowers.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #34</ref><ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #36</ref> The Daxamite overwhelming attacks forces Mongul to have the Sinestro Corps abandon Daxam, with the despot planning to make a different planet their home base.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #37</ref><ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #38</ref>

Mongul takes the Sinestro Corps to [[Korugar]], Sinestro's homeworld, having the inhabitants strung up along the streets. He also decides to rename the Sinestro Corps as "The Mongul Corps", after himself.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #39</ref> Soon after, [[Sinestro]] is brought to Korugar and confronts Mongul. Then, using an [[wikt:override|override]] built into Mongul's rings, Sinestro defeats him, thus reclaiming the Sinestro Corps. Then, he imprisons  Mongul in the Corps' central power battery .<ref>''Green Lantern'' (Vol. 4) #46</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Mongul possesses extraordinary superhuman physical attributes. He demonstrated that he had equal or greater strength than [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] [[Superman]] himself. In addition, he was invulnerable to nearly all forms of physical harm. Mongul also had the technology or the capacity himself to create dimensional-inversion cubes, designed to prevent escape by warping their interior reality and absorbing any power used against them from within. He also possessed technology or the limited capacity for telepathy, and transportation across even interplanetary distances. 

After the events of ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', Mongul still possessed enhanced endurance and strength. Mongul II, his progeny, demonstrated his strength to be as great as, or more powerful than, that of his father, as he held his own against [[Superman]], [[Batman]], and [[Wonder Woman]] in Infinite Crisis # 1 and killed his own sister with one blow in Green Lantern #9. Both incarnations of Mongul were also wielded a highly powerful energy cannon in their chests.

Mongul often uses a parasitic fictional plant-based life-form called the "Black Mercy" as a sort of weapon. This parasite has the ability to totally immerse a victim in a fantasy world. It does so simply by wrapping itself around the victim. These parasites also feed off their victims' life force demonstrating an unusual amount of durability at times; when on a victim like Superman, they appear to be nearly indestructible.

During the aftermath of the [[Sinestro Corps War]], Mongul II obtained a Yellow [[Qward]]ian [[Power Ring (weapon)|Power Ring]] and as such acquired all the powers that come with wielding such a weapon. He went on to kill at least 5 other Sinestro Corps members, and was seen wearing eight large rings (six for his fingers, two for his thumbs). With these, he has been able to create several complex constructs, including a series of chains and collars for his slave chamber. Sinestro has now reclaimed the yellow rings, and imprisoned Mongul in the Central Power Battery of the Sinestro Corps.

==In other media==
===Inter-company Crossovers===

* In the limited series ''[[JLA/Avengers]]'', Mongul has a brief scene in the story where Green Lantern witnesses him being attacked by the [[Marvel Comics]] aliens known as the [[Brood (comics)|Brood]].

===Television===
* In the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' animated series, Mongul first appears in the episode "War World" voiced by [[Eric Roberts]]. He is the ruler of War World and sends Superman to the gladiator pits of his domain. However, he is defeated and disappears.
** In the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "For the Man Who Has Everything" (which is an adaptation of [[For the Man Who Has Everything|the comic story of the same name]]), Mongul tricked Superman by sending him an alien [[Parasitism|parasite]] (a Black Mercy Plant) disguised as a birthday present. The Black Mercy trapped Superman in a [[coma]], while making him live an imaginary life in his mind, a life in which [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]] had never exploded, he had grown to adulthood there and was now leading a happy family life with his wife Loana (mixing elements of both [[Lois Lane]] and [[Lana Lang]]) and son Van-El. With help from [[Batman]] and [[Wonder Woman]] (who had also come to give him birthday presents), Superman escaped the trance, with the illusionary Krypton exploding, much as it did in the real world. Wonder Woman then trapped Mongul with his own parasite. The viewers never see the fantasy Mongul has when he is trapped, but we have a brief moment where we hear screams and sounds of war, while Mongul gives a small smirk of satisfaction.

* Mongul appeared in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "Duel of the Double-Crossers" voiced by [[Gary Anthony Williams]]. This version of Mongul is Mongul, Jr. and his sister [[Mongal]] was his second-in command. He used his technology to bring [[Jonah Hex]] from the past to War World, saving his life in the process, and promised to return him to the past if he could bring him Batman.  He is very similar to [[Darkseid]] in this incarnation, with his sister having the same voice as [[Granny Goodness]], even using her [[Female Furies |Furies]].  He appears in "Death Race to Oblivion" as the main villain, forcing heroes and villains to race for the survival of Earth.

===Film===
* Mongul is one of the villains in the ''[[Superman/Batman: Public Enemies]]'' animated film voiced by [[Bruce Timm]]. Here he is out to get the bounty that [[Lex Luthor]] put out on Superman, though his actions are not his own as he is being controlled mentally by [[Gorilla Grodd]].

=== Video games ===
* Mongul appears in the ''[[Superman Returns (video game)|Superman Returns]]'' video game voiced by [[Todd Williams (actor)|Todd Williams]]. He appears as one of the major villains of the story. The evil tyrant intercepts Kal-El as he returns to Earth from his voyage to Krypton. He forces Superman to compete in gladiatorial combat in Warworld. After the Kryptonian defeats all of his minions Mongul himself steps into the arena and a massive battle ensues, which ends with Superman overpowering the warlord and leaving his battered body in the gladiator's pit. Mongul swears revenge and later in the game travels to Metropolis for a rematch. He attempts to destroy the city but Superman once again bests him, and Mongul flees from Earth.

* Mongul is set to appear in the upcoming video game ''[[DC Universe Online]]''.
