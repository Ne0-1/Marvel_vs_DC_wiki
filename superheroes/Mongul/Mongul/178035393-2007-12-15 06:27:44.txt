'''Mongul''' is a [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]] created by [[Jim Starlin]] and [[Len Wein]]. Notably, he is one of the few villains that is as strong as [[Superman]]. While fairly well-known among Superman's enemies, he is not as famous as [[Lex Luthor]] or [[Darkseid]].

Mongul first appeared in the pages of the ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' [[comic book]] series, in stories written by writer/artist [[Jim Starlin]]. It is apparent that Starlin created Mongul as a version of his most famous villain character, [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Thanos]], for use in the [[DC Universe]] (which is ironic, considering that Thanos supposedly originated as an imitation of DC's [[Darkseid]]). However, Mongul is probably best known for his villainous part in [[Alan Moore]]'s story ''[[For the Man Who Has Everything]]'', which appeared in ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]] [[Annual publication|Annual]]'' #11. Some of the Mongul stories (including ''For the Man Who Has Everything'') have been adapted into episodes of the [[Justice League]] [[List of animated television series|animated series]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Pre-Crisis===
[[Image:Fortheman.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Cover to ''Superman Annual'' #11 ''<br>[[For the Man Who Has Everything]]''.<br>Art by Dave Gibbons.]]
In the comics, Mongul was originally the tyrannical ruler of his own [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] race (who, like him, are yellow-skinned [[humanoid]]s.) He was eventually deposed by a revolution and Mongul swore he'd reconquer his subjects. To this end, he sought the most powerful weapon in the Universe: the artificial planet, Warworld.

To activate it, however, he needed a "key" device, which was under the care of the [[Martian Manhunter]]. Mongul kidnapped three of Superman's friends ([[Lois Lane]], [[Jimmy Olsen]], and Steve Lombard) to force the hero to get the key for him. Superman fought against and defeated the Manhunter and obtained the key. In the subsequent scuffle, the Manhunter rescued Superman's friends, but Mongul escaped with the key. Mongul activated Warworld and linked his mind directly to its controls. Warworld was attacked by Superman and [[Supergirl]] and Mongul used its superweapons against them. Almost too late, he realized that the controls' drain on his brain was too strong; however, he managed to escape just before the heroes destroyed Warworld.

Some time later, Mongul again tried to steal a superweapon; this time, it was a planet-destroying ray machine used by the empress of another galaxy to blackmail its citizens into obedience. It was controlled by the empress' crown. In a plot to obtain the crown, Mongul killed the empress, captured her brother, the alien superhero [[Starman (comics)|Starman]] and threatened to kill him unless Starman's lover gave him the crown. He got the crown, but was attacked again by Superman; this proved to be a diversion while Starman destroyed the weapon. Again, Mongul escaped.

Desiring revenge on Superman, Mongul stole a [[Sun-Eater]] from the [[Controller (DC Comics)|Controller]] who kept it and tried to use it to devour the Earth's solar system. With help from the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]], the Sun-Eater was destroyed (and Superman was finally able to defeat Mongul in hand-to-hand combat).

===Post-Crisis===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Mongulmad.png|thumb|right|200px|Cover to ''Superman'' (Vol. 2) #32.<br>Art by Dennis Janke.]] -->
After DC Comics decided to [[reboot (continuity)|reboot]] their Universe (see [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]), the original Mongul stories were no longer valid. Mongul was reintroduced as already having obtained Warworld and having used it to create his own space empire. He entertained the empire's citizens with [[gladiator]]ial games; the champion was an alien warrior called [[Draaga]]. Mongul captured Superman for use in the games, but the hero ended up joining forces with Draaga and making Mongul flee.

Mongul then joined forces with the [[Hank Henshaw|Cyborg Superman]] in order to gain vengeance on Superman and to try to turn the Earth into another Warworld. In the process, [[Green Lantern]] Hal Jordan's home, Coast City, was destroyed, which led to Jordan joining Superman and his allies to defeat Mongul (see [[The Death of Superman]]). After his defeat, Mongul was imprisoned in a jail for intergalactic criminals, only to break out during a riot. His first target was Green Lantern; he found out that the one who he faced ([[Kyle Rayner]]), was not the one he fought earlier. Even more so, he was defeated when Kyle's ring showed no weakness to yellow, something that even shocked the aiding Superman. Following his defeat, he was re-imprisoned.

During the ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'' storyline, the Demon Lord [[Neron]] began offering supervillains enhanced power in exchange for their souls, all by lighting a candle. Mongul was one of those offered the deal, but his pride caused him to decline the offer. In response, Neron easily beat Mongul to death, taking his soul in the process.

====Mongul II====
Mongul's son, also named Mongul, appeared to assist and train Superman, in preparation for the arrival of [[Imperiex]]. He appeared to have been killed later in the ''[[Our Worlds at War]]'' crossover, but returned during ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' after learning from [[Despero]] that the Justice League had apparently been destroyed. His intention was to loot their Watchtower headquarters but he ended up fighting [[Batman]], [[Superman]], and [[Wonder Woman]]. During the fight, he declared he would take Batman's skull for his throne. He was almost killed by Wonder Woman before escaping via a working teleporter.

The teleportation transported him to Earth, to menace [[Hal Jordan]], the newly-returned Green Lantern, by using the Black Mercy on him and [[Green Arrow]]. In the meantime, he sought his sister, [[Mongal]], to settle family squabbles. The heroes broke free and used a teleporter to transport Mongul and Mongal to their home planet. Stating family to be a weakness, Mongul punched off Mongal's head.

===Sinestro Corps===
[http://dccomics.com/comics/?cm=8729 DC Comics Solicitations] for January 2008 state that Mongul will become a member of the [[Sinestro Corps]], hated enemies of the [[Green Lantern Corps]], adding that he is "ready to instill great fear!". It is notable that the Corps have already made a few ties to Mongul with the construction of a new [[Warworld]], piloted by his father's old comrade the [[Cyborg Superman]]. Mongul receives a ring in Green Lantern Corps #19 after breaking a dying Sinestro Corps member's neck.

On the cover of ''[[Justice League of America]]'' #13 (Vol.2), it shows Mongul as a member of the new [[Injustice League]].

==Powers and abilities==
Mongul possesses extraordinary superhuman physical attributes. He demonstrated that he actually was stronger than [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] [[Superman]] himself. In addition, he was invulnerable to nearly all forms of physical harm. Superman at one time did defeat Mongul, by going all out with speed and strength and heat vision, but fell into ''unconsciousness'' immediately afterwards. Mongul also seemingly had the capacity to create dimensional-inversion cubes, designed to prevent escape by warping their interior reality and absorbing any power used against them from within. Whether this was an actual power or merely a sophisticated technological device remains unclear but it general believed to be technological device. He also seemed to possess a limited capacity for telepathy, and the ability to teleport himself across even interplanetary distances. 

After the events of ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', Mongul no longer possessed his other powers, and was no stronger than Superman. However, he was still strong enough to challenge the Man of Steel. Mongul II, his progeny, possesses the same abilities as he once had.
Both incarnations of Mongul were also capable of projecting extremely potent energy beams from their chest.

*In the animated series ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'', Mongul is the ruler of War World and sends Superman to the gladiator pits of his domain. However, he is defeated and disappears until ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', in the episode [[For the Man Who Has Everything (Justice League Unlimited episode)|For the Man Who Has Everything]], which is an adaptation of the [[For the Man Who Has Everything|comics story]] of the same name, Mongul ([[Eric Roberts]]) tricked Superman by sending him an alien [[Parasitism|parasite]] disguised as a birthday present. The parasite trapped Superman in a [[coma]], while making him live an imaginary life in his mind, a life in which [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]] had never exploded and he had grown to adulthood there. Mongul wondered what Superman was seeing.  His actual words are, "I wonder where he thinks he is?  Sitting on a throne ruling the universe, all you human garbage fawning at his feet?  More honest, don't you think, than this pretence of being a selfless hero." With help from [[Batman]] and [[Wonder Woman]] (who had also come to give him birthday presents), Superman escaped the trance, with the illusionary Krypton exploding, much as it did in the real world. He then trapped Mongul with his own parasite. The viewers never see the fantasy Mongul has when he is trapped, but we have a brief moment where we hear screams.  This story was based on the 1985 Superman Annual by [[Alan Moore]] and [[Dave Gibbons]], replacing Robin's (Jason Todd) role to add more of Wonder Woman's response to Mongul's sexist prodding.  Again in this episode we see that he is physically a match for Superman and outclasses even Wonder Woman.

*in the [[Superman Returns (video game)|Superman Returns]] video game, Mongul appears as one of the major villains of the story.
