'''Captain Comet''' ('''Adam Blake''') is a [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]] created by DC Comics Editor [[Julius Schwartz]], writer [[John Broome (writer)|John Broome]], and artist [[Carmine Infantino]].

Once a minor character in the DC Comics canon, he occupies an almost unique position in DC Comics history as a superhero who was created between the two great superhero comics periods, the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] and the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]]. His early stories fall into a no-man's land, sometimes referred to as "The Atomic Age" because of the recurrent science-fiction themes of most comics of the period, when very few superheroes comics were published and less than a dozen short-lived, superhero characters were introduced.

Along with [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]] and [[Toro (comics)|Toro]] (sidekick of the original [[Human Torch (android)|Human Torch]]), he is among the first [[Mutant (fictional)|mutant]] [[metahuman]] superheroes (meaning he was born with his powers), predating [[X-Men]] by 12 years.  He is one of the few DC Comics characters not to have had their earlier history significantly changed by various DC Comics major continuity changing events over the years such as ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' and ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]''.

==Publication history==
The character of Captain Comet first appeared in a 10-page tale, "The Origin Of Captain Comet", in the flagship science-fiction title ''[[Strange Adventures]]'' #9 (June 1951) published by [[DC Comics#The Golden Age|National Comics]] (now known as DC Comics).<ref name=Guide>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=62}}</ref> He was created by ''Strange Adventures'' editor [[Julius Schwartz]],<ref>"In an interview, [[Paul Kupperberg]] has explained that the inspiration for Captain Comet was [[Edmond Hamilton|Edmond Hamilton's]] Captain Future (a slight error—the Captain Future pulp stories were mainly written by Hamilton but the character was created by [[Mort Weisinger]]). At that time Hamilton was represented by [[Julius Schwartz]], then a literary agent, later a DC Comics Editor—including editor of ''Strange Adventures''." Interview with Paul Kupperberg by [[Michael Eury]], p200 of ''The Krypton Companion'' ed. Eury, Michael (TwoMorrows Publications 2006) {{ISBN|1-893905-61-6}}.</ref> John Broome, and artist Carmine Infantino, and the story was written by John Broome (under the alias Edgar Ray Merritt), drawn by Carmine Infantino, and inked by [[Bernard Sachs (comics)|Bernard Sachs]]. The character was based on the [[pulp magazine|pulp fiction]] character [[Captain Future]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Anderson |first1=Murphy |last2=Harvey |first2=R.C. |title=The Life and Art of Murphy Anderson |date=2003 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=1-893905-21-7 |page=49}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Eury |first1=Michael |title=The Krypton Companion |date=2006 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=1-893905-61-6 |page=200}}</ref> 

His first appearance was actually a two-part story, continued in "The Air Bandits from Space" in ''Strange Adventures'' #10 (July 1951). From issue #12 (September 1951) [[Murphy Anderson]] took over as artist, and he drew all Captain Comet's further appearances in ''Strange Adventures'' until #46 (July 1954);<ref>{{cite book |last1=Schelly |first1=William |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: The 1950s |date=2013 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=9781605490540 |page=40}}</ref> [[Sy Barry]] and [[Gil Kane]] drew the last two stories. John Broome wrote every issue.

Captain Comet appeared in 38 issues of ''Strange Adventures'', (missing only issues #45, #47, and #48); the series ending in ''Strange Adventures'' #49 (October, 1954). From the beginning, Captain Comet appeared on most of the covers, mainly drawn by Murphy Anderson or Gil Kane. Stories ranged in length from six to ten pages, dropping from ten pages in 1951 to eight pages in 1952 and finally six pages from May 1953. He next appeared in 1976, when writer [[Gerry Conway]] and co-writer [[David Anthony Kraft]] reintroduced him as a supporting character in ''[[Secret Society of Super Villains]]'' starting with "No Man Shall Call Me Master" (''Secret Society of Super Villains'' #2, July/August 1976). He appeared in most issues of that title, together with associated ''Secret Society of Super Villains Special'' #1 (October 1977), until it was canceled with issue #15 (June/July 1978). During this run he also appeared in ''[[Super-Team Family|Super-Team Family Giant]]'' #13 (September 1977), a story directly linked to the ''Secret Society of Super Villains'' series, and as lead character for the first time since 1954 in an extended story, "Danger: Dinosaurs at Large!" in ''DC Special'' #27, April/May 1977, by [[Bob Rozakis]] and artist [[Rich Buckler]]. ''Secret Society of Super Villains'' was canceled as part of the [[DC Implosion]]. Captain Comet was a popular character at the time—he came second in a poll for potential [[Justice League]] membership, and writer [[Bob Rozakis]] presented DC Comics with a proposal for Captain Comet's first self-titled series.<ref>"Here comes Captain Comet pt 1"&nbsp;– Bob Rozakis ''Answer Man'' website&nbsp;– http://www.comicsbulletin.com/bobro/99588498838532.htm{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>'Here comes Captain Comet pt 2'&nbsp;– Bob Rozakis 'Answer Man' website&nbsp;– http://www.comicsbulletin.com/bobro/99649653780073.htm{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

After the cancellation of ''Secret Society of Super Villains'', Captain Comet entered another hiatus, his appearances limited to guest spots in other DC titles during the 1980s. Four of these were cameo appearances—''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' #5 (August 1985), #10 (January 1986) and #12 (March 1986), and ''[[All-Star Squadron]]'' #53 (January 1986). Two were team-ups with Superman—''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' #22 (June 1980) and #91 (March 1986); the fourth was a retelling of his origin by Roy Thomas in ''[[Secret Origins]] Annual'' vol 2 #1 (1987). He also appeared in the non-canonical series ''[[DC Challenge]]'' (1986).

He then became a supporting character in the ''[[L.E.G.I.O.N.]]'' series from issue #16 (June 1990). Captain Comet was actually a late replacement for fellow 1950s space traveler [[Adam Strange]] who was due to become a regular character, as otherwise it would have clashed with the ''Adam Strange'' limited series published around the same time.<ref>Editorial on letters page in ''L.E.G.I.O.N. ’90'' #16 (June 1990)</ref> He was then part of the ''R.E.B.E.L.S.'' series which continued from ''L.E.G.I.O.N.'' That series was canceled with ''R.E.B.E.L.S. ’96'' #17 (March 1996), and had a solo story in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase ’96]]'' #10 (November 1996), after which another hiatus followed.

Since 2005, under the writer [[Jim Starlin]], Captain Comet has had his highest profile in DC Comics publications since the 1950s, featuring in the ''[[Rann–Thanagar War]]'' miniseries (2005), starring in the 8-issue miniseries ''[[Mystery in Space#Mystery in Space (2006)|Mystery in Space (vol 2)]]'' (2006),<ref>{{cite book|last=Cowsill|first= Alan|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 2000s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 327|quote = [Mystery in Space] returned for an eight-issue run featuring Captain Comet, and was written by Jim Starlin and drawn by Shane Davis.}}</ref> and co-starring in ''Rann-Thanagar Holy War'' (2008) and ''Strange Adventures'' (vol 3, 2009), as well as appearing briefly in the ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' (2006) and ''[[Final Crisis]]'' (2008) events. Most recently he has become a regular character in the ongoing new ''[[R.E.B.E.L.S.]]'' series (2009).

==Fictional character biography==
[[File:Strange adventures 9.jpg|thumb|left|150px|''Strange Adventures'' #9<br>Art by [[Carmine Infantino]].]]

===1950s&nbsp;– ''Strange Adventures''===
Captain Comet, the "first man of the future", is a [[Mutant (fictional)#DC Comics|mutant]] [[metahuman]] "born a hundred thousand years before his time", in 1931 to John and Martha Blake, a farming couple from the American [[Midwest]].<ref>''Strange Adventures'' #9, (June 1951)</ref> His "metagene" was triggered by a [[comet]] passing overhead at birth.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Markstein |first1=Don |title=Captain Comet |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/capcomet.htm |website=Don Markstein's Toonopedia |access-date=2 April 2020}}</ref>

Adam Blake discovered his unique abilities as he grew up—at the age of four he instantly found a ring his mother had lost ("I just knew it was there"), and by eight years old demonstrated photographic memory by rapidly reading a whole encyclopedia and retaining the information. Other skills manifested almost instantly: he could play musical instruments without training and was secretly expert at sports to Olympic record level. In high school he saved a schoolmate from falling to her death by mental force, but despite his powers he felt isolated from other humans because of his differences from them. After leaving school he became a librarian in Midwest City, where he sought the help of a renowned physicist, Professor Emery Zackro, who tested him and discovered Adam was a mutant—postulating he was the reverse of an evolutionary throwback, "an accidental specimen of future man".<ref>''Strange Adventures'' #9 (June 1951) Note: Roy Thomas' telling of Captain Comet's origin in ''Secret Origins Annual'' #1 (1987) has this happening in his senior year, not after leaving school.</ref> His Captain Comet persona began when Adam used his powers to intervene when criminals attempted to steal an advanced scientific device invented by Professor Zackro. Immediately after this, Blake and the Professor agreed Blake should become a superhero on a full-time basis, and he made his first appearance in public as Captain Comet combating giant,  terraforming robot tops belonging to an alien race looking for a world to colonize. During this task, Adam built a working version of a prototype spaceship Professor Zackro had designed, which would become his personal spaceship, ''The Cometeer'', and took up a costume, spacesuit and stun gun also invented by the Professor.<ref>''Strange Adventures'' #9 (June 1951)—although it is Roy Thomas' re-telling of Captain Comet's history in ''Secret Origins Annual'' #1 (1987) that actually makes this clear.</ref>

Over the next three years he saved Earth from multiple alien invasions and explored space in ''The Cometeer'', saving other civilizations and meeting beautiful alien damsels in distress. During this period he largely used intelligence and his mind-reading skills to help solve problems, seldom resorting to physical solutions. Among his weirder adventures, Captain Comet battled mad [[Greek gods]] from space,<ref>"Secret of the Twelve Eternals", ''Strange Adventures'' #19 (April 1952)</ref> fought dinosaurs and alien creatures, and came up against an evil super-powered ape several times.<ref>"Challenge of Man-Ape the Mighty", ''Strange Adventures'' #32 (May 1953)</ref><ref>"The Guilty Gorilla", ''Strange Adventures'' #39 (December 1953)</ref> Sometime after 1954 he disappeared into space in ''The Cometeer'' on another expedition of discovery, but this time he would not return for over 20 years.

===1970s–1980s===
In 1976 Captain Comet returned to Earth, having not aged, with a new protective costume instead of a spacesuit, and enhanced skills—controlling his appearance mentally (although dressing in 1950s style)—and with a powerful physical punch as well as a mental force, super-speed, and an ability to manipulate objects. He also had an explanation for his absence—having always felt alienated from normal humans because of his abilities: "For 20 years he spanned the spaceways, searching for himself." "He’s been across the galaxy—twice."<ref>"No Man Shall I Call Master", ''Secret Society of Super Villains'' #2 (July/August 1976)</ref> After misreading a battle between [[Green Lantern]] and [[Gorilla Grodd]], and some trickery by Grodd, he ended up joining the Secret Society of Super Villains and battled [[Darkseid]] and the forces of [[Apokolips]] with them.<ref>''Secret Society of Super Villains'' #2-5.</ref> Later he turned down full membership in the Justice League, but became an honorary member and took up residence in their satellite headquarters.<ref>''Secret Society of Super Villains'' #5 (January/February 1977)</ref> After fighting [[Chronos (comics)|Chronos]] and dinosaurs in [[Gotham City]],<ref>"Danger: Dinosaurs at Large", ''DC Special'' #27 (April 1977)</ref> the Captain continued his crusade against the Secret Society of Super Villains despite a number of setbacks orchestrated by Gorilla Grodd.<ref>''Secret Society of Super Villains'' #15 (June/July 1978)</ref>

Although present at the marriage of [[The Atom|Ray 'The Atom' Palmer]] and [[Jean Loring]] several months later,<ref>''Justice League of America'' #157 (August 1978)</ref> Captain Comet remained off-radar for nearly two years, eventually contacting [[Superman]] when the effect of the comet that mutated him wore off, turning him into a human comet whose powers fluctuated wildly.<ref>"Plight of the Human Comet", ''DC Comics Presents'' #22 (June 1980)</ref> With Superman's help he tracked down the comet and stabilized his powers. Superman's help was needed again six years later when the villain Brain Storm attempted to augment his waning powers by stealing Captain Comet's power, which accidentally evolved him to a more advanced form temporarily.<ref>"The Brains That Stormed Metropolis", ''DC Comics Presents'' #91 (March 1986)</ref>

===1990s&nbsp;– ''L.E.G.I.O.N.'' / ''R.E.B.E.L.S.''===
He spent the next few years "roaming the stars... just drifting",<ref>''L.E.G.I.O.N. 90'' #18 (August 1990)</ref> before being captured by the space outlaw Dagon-Ra<ref>''L.E.G.I.O.N.90'' #16 (June 1990)</ref> despite his new powers including near invulnerability, telekinesis and increased strength. Rescued by L.E.G.I.O.N., he recuperated in their headquarters hospital and was invited to join them soon after,<ref>''L.E.G.I.O.N. 90'' #19 (September 1990)</ref> and did so a year later.<ref>''L.E.G.I.O.N. 91'' #29 (July 1991)</ref>

His involvement with L.E.G.I.O.N. was in a supporting role. He fell in love with fellow member scientist Marij'n Bek, who nursed him back to health and studied the massive headaches he frequently suffered. These were the result of his possession by a psi-creature in space before meeting L.E.G.I.O.N.; it was eventually purged by [[Vril Dox]], leaving the Captain once again hospitalised for months.<ref>''L.E.G.I.O.N. 92'' #46 (November 1992)</ref> Soon after he was apparently killed by [[Lady Quark]]—who had been possessed by the same parasite. Buried under a mountain on Ith'kaa,<ref>''L.E.G.I.O.N. 94'' #63 (February 1994)</ref> he eventually dug himself out<ref>''L.E.G.I.O.N. 94'' #67 (June 1994)</ref> and used his knowledge to manipulate the savage indigenous population to achieve the technological level to build him a spaceship (explaining later, without irony, that it took six months to industrialize the tribal society because "they were slow learners").<ref>''R.E.B.E.L.S.'' #11 (September 1995)</ref> Returning to R.E.B.E.L.S. homeworld of Cairn, he learned that Vril Dox's son Lyrl had brainwashed most of the L.E.G.I.O.N., made the key L.E.G.I.O.N. members fugitives, and taken control of Cairn; he and Maryj'n formed a resistance movement to free the population and overthrow Lyrl, and were key in successfully defeating him. As a result, Captain Comet became leader of the new, reformed L.E.G.I.O.N.<ref>''R.E.B.E.L.S. 96'' #16 (February 1996)</ref>

During this period, Captain Comet took up residence (with Tyrone, an artificially created telepathic clone bulldog) in The Zelazny Building on "[[Hardcore Station]]", a corrupt commercial satellite station with a population of several million in a free space zone between a number of trading civilisations.<ref name="MysteryIn">''Mystery In Space'' (vol 2) #1 (November 2006)</ref>

===Post 1990s===
====''Rann–Thanagar War''====
At some undefined point in the next ten years Captain Comet stepped down as leader and became a paid freelance aide and agent to Vril Dox, who took back the L.E.G.I.O.N. reins. He was next seen with Dox under contract to the planet Ancar, which had been invaded by [[Khund]]s during the [[Rann–Thanagar War]]; after intervention by Green Lantern [[Kyle Rayner]], he decided to stay and help him end the war.<ref>''Rann-Thanagar War'' #2 (August 2005)</ref> He first accompanied Kyle to the destroyed planet [[Thanagar]], where they built a protective dome and terraformed the land to create a secure environment for the survivors.<ref>''Rann-Thanagar War'' #3–4 (September–October 2005)</ref> Then he joined up with [[Adam Strange]] and [[Hawkman]] to defend Rann against the Thanagarians under the control of the demon [[Onimar Synn]], who he was instrumental in destroying.<ref>''Rann-Thanagar War'' #5–6 (November–December 2005)</ref>

====''52'' and ''Mystery in Space''====
A year after the events of ''Infinite Crisis'', Captain Comet was captured and tortured by [[Lady Styx]], forcing him to jettison his primary consciousness from his body before death.<ref>''52'' Week Thirty-One (December 2006)</ref> His psychic self merged briefly with that of [[Weird (comics)|The Weird]], which had been drifting in space since his death,<ref>''The Weird'' #4 (July 1988)</ref> and both were revived in new bodies.<ref name="MysteryIn" /> Captain Comet's new body re-formed at Hardcore Station—with golden eyes, a 20-year-old's physique, and the ability to teleport, although he had lost some strength. Shortening his name to Comet and fostering the misconception that he was his own nephew, he searched for the remains of his old body on Hardcore Station, discovering that it had been stolen by the Eternal Light Corporation Church and he was being hunted by a team of their telepathic assassins.<ref>''Mystery In Space'' (vol 2) #2–4 (December 2006&nbsp;– February 2007)</ref> On breaking into the Eternal Light Corporation's building, he uncovered that brainwashed cloned telepaths were being grown from the charred remains of his corpse, which he destroyed. Becoming a fugitive, he hid from the E.L.C. so they could not use his new body to continue their cloning—allowing thousands of Hardcore residents to die when the E.L.C. cut off life support to a whole area of Hardcore Station to force them to surrender Comet. Eventually he destroyed all the clones and the E.L.C.—also killing hundreds of their followers.

====''Rann–Thanagar Holy War'', ''Strange Adventures'' (vol 3) and ''R.E.B.E.L.S.''====
Target of an assassination attempt by a surviving E.L.C. follower during a resurgence of the faith, Comet accepted an offer by Adam Strange to leave Hardcore Station and help quell growing religious fanaticism on Rann.<ref>''Rann-Thanagar Holy War'' #1 (July 2008)</ref> He ended up working with Adam Strange, Hawkman, [[Starfire (Koriand'r)|Starfire]], The Weird, and the [[Starman (comics)|Prince Gavyn Starman]] against the influences of the warring Lord Synnar (a cosmic tyrant behind the Eternal Light Corporation) and Lady Styx on Rann and Thanagar (which once again set the two planets on course for war). Their interference was eventually key in Lord Synnar's plans to reach a higher plane of existence.<ref>''Rann–Thanagar Holy War'' #8 (February 2009)</ref>

Later, Comet learned from the future spirit of Synnar that he is destined to be one of "The Aberrant Six": a group critical to preventing Synnar (trapped in The Weird's body) from destroying the universe. Ultimately the Aberrant Six did not form, and the future Synnar was forced to leave after Comet's mercenary friend Eye was killed by Synnar's supreme god-enemy. Comet was entrusted with Eye's robot companion, Orb, until Synnar returns to "continue his negotiations". Comet then returned to Hardcore Station,<ref>''Strange Adventures'' (vol 3) (May–December 2009)</ref> and almost immediately joined Vril Dox's new R.E.B.E.L.S.<ref>''R.E.B.E.L.S.'' #9, December 2009</ref> He entered into a brief relationship with Starfire and helped defeat Starro the Conqueror saving Rann, the Vega System and the galaxy.

===New 52===
Adam Blake was re-introduced in the 2011 ''[[New 52]]'' event during [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Rags Morales]] revamp of ''[[Action Comics]]''. <ref>''Action Comics Vol 2 #10''</ref> In this reality, Adam Blake was "Comet", a hyper-evolved human, who at the time of his birth, a comet passed over his house. The comet's radiation caused his body to evolve, and be, as scientist Emery Zackro called it, "born 1000 years ahead of his time". <ref>''Action Comics Vol 2 #12''</ref>

Misunderstood, he was shunned by his father and the rest of the town, and roamed rural [[Kansas]] for several years, until it was time for him to go to space, to the source of his powers. <ref>''Action Comics Vol 2 #10''</ref> <ref>''Action Comics Vol 2 #12''</ref> At the end of issue 12 of ''[[Action Comics]]'', Comet was revealed as the first Neo Sapiens, enlisted by the Oort-Kind to find others similarly evolved, including [[Lois Lane]]'s niece, Suzie.

==Other versions==
===''Elseworlds''===
Captain Comet has also appeared in a number of DC Comics titles which do not fit into normal continuity:
* ''[[DC Challenge]]'' (November 1985&nbsp;– October 1986);
* ''[[Kingdom Come (comic)|Kingdom Come]]'' (1996), an acclaimed [[Elseworlds]] miniseries in which Captain Comet was a member of Superman's reformed Justice League. He was chosen by Superman to be warden of the Gulag, the holding facility/prison for metahumans who chose to defy the Justice League, and was killed in a prison riot.
* ''[[The Golden Age (comics)|The Golden Age]]'' (1991), an Elseworlds miniseries where Captain Comet made a brief appearance in the final issue. This took place in 1951, the first year of his crime fighting career.
* In the [[Tangent Comics|DC Tangent]] "[[Earth-9]]" universe, Captain Comet was an African-American superhero from that reality's Chicago who was killed in Czechoslovakia trying to prevent a war in Europe. He was resurrected, and sought revenge for the bombing of a US Army base.
* He also made a brief appearance in the Elseworlds tale ''[[JLA: Another Nail]]'' (2004), when all time periods melded together.
* An older version of Captain Comet fights against the tyranny of [[Vril Dox]] in the ''[[Armageddon 2001]]'' crossover. He loses his then-wife in the battle, Marijin, and is slain himself.<ref>''L.E.G.I.O.N.'' Annual #2 (1991)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
[[File:Captain Comet (DC Comics).jpg|180px|thumb|Captain Comet in ''Rann–Thanagar War'' #5 (2005). Art by [[Ivan Reis]].]]
Captain Comet is supposedly the pinnacle of human evolution. His mutant mental functions not only give him genius level [[Intelligence quotient|I.Q.]] but endow him with a photographic memory and [[telepathy]], enabling him to read or control people's minds (including alien races). He has [[psychokinesis|telekinetic powers]], which enable him to use his thoughts to move, lift, and alter matter without physical contact, mentally lift himself to fly at high-speed, create barriers of psychic force to deflect physical attack, and fire bursts of psionic energy that strike with concussive impact, sometimes in the form of lightning or fire blasts. He has an accelerated healing and his telekinetic shield can simultaneously protect him from the vacuum of space and surround him with a breathable environment.

Captain Comet's brain also contains evolved sensory centers enabling him to [[clairvoyance|clairvoyantly]] "see" events outside of his range of sight. His evolved physiology originally made him superhumanly strong and durable, enough to lift a large spaceship and fight toe to toe with beings such as Lobo. After his resurrection, however, his physical power was significantly diminished, although his mental and psionic abilities have been enhanced.  He has also acquired a teleportation ability that can be used on others as well as himself, but normally requires an hour to recharge after every "jump".

==In other media==
===Television===
* Captain Comet appears in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "The Siege of Starro" Pt. 1. He is seen with the Green Lantern Corps fighting the Starro-controlled heroes and succumbs to Starro's control.
