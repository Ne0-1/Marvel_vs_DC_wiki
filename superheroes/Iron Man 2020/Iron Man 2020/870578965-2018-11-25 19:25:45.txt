Arno is Tony Stark's future [[cousin|first cousin once removed]], and the unscrupulous [[Morgan Stark]]'s son. Arno inherited the company [[Stark Industries]]. Rather than use the armor for heroic deeds, he prefers to act as a hired [[mercenary]] or commit acts of corporate [[espionage]] to cripple his competitors for industrialist gain.<ref>''Machine Man 2020'' #2</ref>

In his original appearance, the Iron Man of 2020 was employed by [[Sunset Bain]] (as an old woman) to destroy [[Machine Man]] who had been accidentally discovered and subsequently reactivated by the Midnight Wreckers, rebellious youths who scavenged discarded technology. Despite ostensibly superior power, Iron Man was defeated by the furious Machine Man who went on to claim "I'm a better man than you." <ref>''Machine Man 2020'' #3</ref>

In another story, Arno's factory is infiltrated by Robert Saunders, a heavily scarred man who starts a countdown on a powerful bomb of Stark's design, threatening Stark's wife and son (trapped in the factory) and the surrounding city. The only way to deactivate the device is with a [[retinal scan]] of Saunders, but is killed and the man's body destroyed while trying to escape. To get the scan data, Stark travels back in time to the "present" (i.e. 1986, when the story was published<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #20</ref>) to find Saunders as a child. He is soon mistaken for the "current" Iron Man (Tony Stark) and attacked by one of Tony's enemies [[Blizzard (comics)|Blizzard]] (Gregor Shapanka). Arno, knowing his time in the 20th century is limited, kills Blizzard and continues his search for the young Saunders. This draws the attention of [[Spider-Man]], who also mistakes Arno for Tony and further mistakes Arno's attempts to get a retinal scan from Saunders as an attack on the boy. While protecting Saunders, Spider-Man evades various attempts by Arno to get hold of the boy, while Arno becomes increasingly desperate as his time in the 20th century nears its end. One of Arno's attacks seriously injures Saunders; the scars Arno inflicted would eventually lead Saunders's vengeance-minded future self to sabotage Arno's factory, thus Arno unwittingly creates the situation he traveled back in time to resolve and [[Spider-Man]] is sufficiently angered to directly attack the much more powerful Arno. Surprised by the assault and overwhelmed by Spider-Man's far greater speed, Arno's armor is significantly damaged. When he is pulled back to his own time, he finds himself standing in the center of a huge crater, having returned too late to prevent the bomb's detonation and the destruction of his family, factory and city.

In a later appearance, Iron Man 2020 fought the time-traveling cyborg [[Death's Head]].<ref>''Death's Head #10 ''</ref>

Iron Man 2020 also had his own one-shot in June 1994, in which he faces off against an industrial rival who seeks to use him to destroy all his competitors all at once, sacrificing his own daughter in the process. At the end of the story, Arno and the girl Melodi get together, suggesting an evolution towards a more heroic role again. Meanwhile, the background character Howard is revealed (if only to the reader) to be the aged Tony himself who intends to guide his young cousin.<ref>''Iron Man 2020'' graphic novel</ref>

He (or an alternate version) has been seen imprisoned in the time cells of the [[Time Variance Authority]], the holding facilities for the most "dangerous time-travel offenders".<ref name="She-Hulk vol. 2 #3">''She-Hulk'' vol. 2 #3 (Feb. 2006).</ref>

In 2023, Arno makes helicarrier technology available for public use, to start with in the form of a helicruiser called the "Spirit of free enterprise". At the same time, he has supplied [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] with a far more advanced replacement Hypercarrier. Unfortunately, his launching the airborne cruise ship has raised the ire of the aged [[sky pirate]], Commodore Q. Arno has married Melodi at this point and "Howard" remains his retainer. He also employs a squad of fetal [[Extremis]] enhanciles who act as his personal armored combat squad.<ref>"Astonishing Tales (2009) #1-6"</ref>

A version of Arno's armor left in the present is stolen by the [[Sinister Six]] as part of [[Doctor Octopus]]' plans [[Ends of the Earth (Marvel Comics)|against the Avengers]], using technology from the armor to devise a means of defeating the Iron Man of the present.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #683</ref>

Arno is later rescued from a collapsing timeline by [[Kang the Conqueror]] who recruits him as part of a team of multiversal characters tasked with combating the [[Apocalypse Twins]].<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #14</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Iron Man 2020 wears a suit of highly sophisticated [[armor]], similar in appearance to the classic Iron Man armor (circa Model 5), with the exception of the faceplate and shoulders. Beam weapons are fitted in the gauntlets of the suit, as well as the chest beam and shoulder epaulets. The user no longer requires a [[cybernetic]] link in the helmet to control the armor; the helmet can also be hidden via cloaking technology, which was presumably developed based on the Chameleon mode of the Silver Centurion armor. Iron Man 2020's systems are built for [[warfare]], not super heroics like the original Iron Man. Iron Man 2020's repulsors (and an arsenal of other weapons) always fire at maximum power for the most lethal effects.  Curiously, Iron Man 2020 also has the original Iron Man's 1970s-era rollerskates (updated to a "roller blade" style{{issue|date=April 2013}}) built into the boots of the suit.

The [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe features '''Gregory "Greg" Stark''', a unique character to the Ultimate Marvel universe created by [[Mark Millar]] and [[Carlos Pacheco]]. His character shares similarities with Arno Stark of the mainstream Marvel universe. In contrast to his brother [[Ultimate Iron Man (comics)|Iron Man]] (Tony Stark), he is more competent and doesn't possess an infamous lifestyle, but also suffers from a superiority complex.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Avengers'' #2</ref> Gregory serves as [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]]'s benefactor for the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] to initially defeat the [[Red Skull]] and [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]].<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Avengers'' #4</ref><ref>''Ultimate Comics: Avengers'' #5</ref><ref>''Ultimate Comics: Avengers'' #6</ref> Stark later participated in a war between the Avengers led by Fury and the [[Ultimates]] led by [[Carol Danvers]]. After an all-out fight which resulted in Fury being taken into custody and Danvers being in critical condition, Stark was given leadership of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] by the [[President of the United States]]. Stark then revealed that he was actually responsible for Fury's framing as a rogue agent selling top secret superhuman research on the black market. Gregory has also used his S.H.I.E.L.D. director position to aid in his cause of supplying smuggled super-soldiers to pro-democratic rebellions in rogue states and creating a new world order according to his own agenda.<ref>''Ultimate Avengers vs. New Ultimates'' #4</ref> When Fury and the Avengers confront him, Stark uses a nanite fleet in his body, imbuing him with super-human strength and invulnerability. As his plans came to fruition as nations (such as Iran and North Korea) fall to revolution, Stark ordered the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Ultimates]] to stand down. But when the New Ultimates and the Avengers fight against of the conspiracy, Stark personally fought against both groups in North Korea; he destroys [[Ultimate Captain America|Captain America]]'s [[Captain America's shield|shield]] to show his strength. When Iron Man disabled his brother's nanites via electromagnetic pulse, Gregory is killed when [[Ultimate Thor|Thor]] strikes him with a lightning bolt.<ref>''Ultimate Avengers vs. New Ultimates'' #5</ref><ref>''Ultimate Avengers vs. New Ultimates'' #6</ref>
