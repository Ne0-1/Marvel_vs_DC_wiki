'''Iron Man 2020''' (real name '''Arno Stark''') is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[superhero]]. He is the counterpart of the [[superhero]] [[Iron Man]] in the future year of 2020 in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|multiverse]]. He first appeared in the second issue of the ''[[Machine Man]]'' [[limited series]] (1984).

==Fictional character biography==
Arno Stark is the future [[cousin|first cousin once removed]] of the present day of [[Iron Man]], Tony Stark. His father is Stark's unscrupulous cousin, Morgan Stark. Arno inherited Tony Stark's company, Stark Industries, and rather than use the armor for heroic deeds, prefers to act as a hired [[mercenary]] or commit acts of corporate [[espionage]] to cripple his competitors for industrialist gain.<ref>''Machine Man'' #2</ref>

In his original appearance, the Iron Man of 2020 was employed by [[Sunset Bain]] (then an old woman) to destroy [[Machine Man]], who had been accidentally discovered and subsequently reactivated by the Midnight Wreckers, rebellious youths who scavenged discarded technology. Despite ostensibly superior power, Iron Man was defeated by the furious Machine Man, who went on to claim "I'm a better man than you." <ref>''Machine Man'' #3</ref>

In another story, Arno Stark's factory is infiltrated by a heavily-scarred man named Robert Saunders, who starts a countdown on a powerful bomb of Stark's design, threatening Stark's wife and son (trapped in the factory) and the surrounding city.  The only way to deactivate the device is with a [[retinal scan]] of Saunders, but he is killed and his body destroyed while trying to escape.  To get the scan data, Stark travels back in time to the "present" (i.e. 1986, when the story was published<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #20</ref>) to find Saunders as a child.  He is soon mistaken for the "current" Iron Man (Tony Stark) and attacked by one of Tony Stark's enemies, [[Blizzard (comics)|Blizzard]] (Gregor Shapanka).  Arno, knowing his time in the 20th century is limited, kills Blizzard and continues his search for the young Saunders.  This draws the attention of [[Spider-Man]], who also mistakes Arno for Tony and further mistakes Arno's attempts to get a retinal scan from Saunders as an attack on the boy.  While protecting Saunders, Spider-Man evades various attempts by Arno to get hold of the boy, while Arno becomes increasingly desperate as his time in the 20th century nears its end.  One of Arno's attacks seriously injures Saunders (inflicting the scars that would eventually lead his vengeance-minded future self to sabotage Arno's factory, thus Arno unwittingly creates the situation he traveled back in time to resolve) and Spider-Man is sufficiently angered to directly attack the much more powerful Arno.  Surprised by the assault and overwhelmed by Spider-Man's far greater speed, Arno's armor is significantly damaged.  When he is pulled back to his own time, he finds himself standing in the center of a huge crater, having returned too late to prevent the bomb's detonation and the destruction of his family, factory and city.

In a later appearance, Iron Man 2020 fought the time-traveling cyborg [[Death's Head]].<ref>''Death's Head Vol. 2 ''</ref>

Iron Man 2020 also had his own one-shot in June 1994, in which he faces off against an industrial rival who seeks to use him to destroy all his competitors all at once, sacrificing his own daughter in the process. At the end of the story, Arno Stark and the girl, Melodi, get together, suggesting an evolution towards a more heroic role again. Meanwhile, the background character Howard is revealed (if only to the reader) to be an aged Tony Stark himself who intends to guide his young cousin.<ref>''Iron Man 2020'' graphic novel</ref>

He (or an alternate version of him) has been seen imprisoned in the time cells of the [[Time Variance Authority]], the holding facilities for the most "dangerous time-travel offenders".{{issue|date=April 2013}}

In 2023, Arno Stark makes helicarrier technology available for public use, to start with in the form of a helicruiser called the "Spirit of free enterprise". At the same time, he has supplied S.H.I.E.L.D. with a far more advanced replacement Hypercarrier. Unfortunately, his launching the airborne cruise ship has raised the ire of the aged sky-pirate, Commodore Q. Arno has married Melodi at this point and "Howard" remains his retainer. He also employs a squad of fetal [[Extremis]] enhanciles' who act as his personal armored combat squad.<ref> "Astonishing Tales (2009) #1-6" </ref>

A version of Arno's armor left in the present is stolen by the [[Sinister Six]] as part of [[Doctor Octopus]]'s plans [[Ends of the Earth (Marvel Comics)|against the Avengers]], using technology from the armor to devise a means of defeating the Iron Man of the present.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #683</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Iron Man 2020 wears a suit of highly sophisticated [[armor]], similar in appearance to the classic (circa Model 5) Iron Man, with the exception of the faceplate and shoulders. [[Beam weapons]] are fitted in the gauntlets of the suit, as well as the chest beam and shoulder epaulets. The user no longer requires a [[cybernetic]] link in the helmet to control the armor; the helmet can also be hidden via [[cloaking technology]], which was presumably developed based on the Chameleon mode of the Silver Centurion armor. Iron Man 2020's systems are built for [[warfare]], not super heroics like the original Iron Man. Iron Man 2020's repulsors (and an arsenal of other weapons) always fire at maximum power for the most lethal effects.  Curiously, Iron Man 2020 also has the 1970s-era Iron Man rollerskates (updated to a "roller blade" style{{issue|date=April 2013}}) built into the boots of the suit.

==Other versions==
===Paradise X===
The Iron Man of 2020 also appeared in the ''[[Earth X|Paradise X]]'' mini-series alongside numerous Marvel heroes from different time-lines, such as [[Alternate versions of Storm|a version]] of [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] named "Bloodstorm", [[Deathlok]], [[Spider-Girl]] and [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] (in his [[Days of Future Past]] form).<ref>''Paradise X: Heralds'' #2</ref>

===Avengers Forever===
A version of the Iron Man of 2020 appeared as one of the multidimensional "potential" Avengers in ''[[Avengers Forever]]''.<ref>''Avengers Forever'' #1-12</ref>
