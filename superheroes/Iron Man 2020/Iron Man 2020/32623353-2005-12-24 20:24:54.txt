'''Iron Man 2020''' (real name Arno Stark) is a [[fictional character]] and [[supervillain]] who exists in the future year of [[2020]] within the [[Marvel Comics]] [[multiverse]]. He first appeared in ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]] [[annual publication|Annual]]'' #16 ([[1986]]).

==Character history==

Arno Stark is the future nephew of the present day [[Iron Man]], billionaire industrialist playboy Tony Stark. His father is Stark's unscrupulous cousin, Morgan Stark. Arno inherited his uncle's company, Stark Industries, and rather than use the armor for heroic deeds, prefers to act as a hired [[mercenary]] or commit acts of corporate [[espionage]] to cripple his competitors for industrialist gain.

In his first appearance, Iron Man 2020 travelled to the present day in order to obtain the retinal patterns of a young boy. In the year 2020, that boy's adult self had set a bomb to kill Arno Stark's family, and his retinal patterns were needed to defuse the bomb. Iron Man 2020 was successful in obtaining retinal scans, but was delayed in battle by the superhero [[Spider-Man]], who only witnessed an unconscious and battered young boy being presumably kidnapped by a villain. This delay somehow resulted in Iron Man 2020 returning to the future too late to defuse the bomb, although this makes no sense with regards to the physics of time travel. In his later appearances, Iron Man 2020 fought the 2020 counterpart of [[Machine Man]] and the time-traveling cyborg [[Death's Head]].

He is currently imprisoned in the time cells of the Time Variance Authority, the holding facilities for the most "dangerous time-travel offenders".

==Powers and abilities==

Iron Man 2020 wears a suit of highly sophisticated armor, similar in appearance to Iron Man, with the exception of the faceplate and shoulders. Repulsor rays are equipped in the gaunlets of the suit, as well as the chest beam, albeit, far more powerful and destructive than in the past. The user no longer requires a [[cybernetic]] link in the helmet to control the armor; the helmet can also be hidden via cloaking technology, which was presumably developed sometime in the future.
