'''Slipstream''' ('''Davis Cameron''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]] associated with the [[X-Men]]. Created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Salvador Larroca]], he first appeared in ''[[X-Treme X-Men]]'' #6 ([[2001#December|December 2001]]).
 
He is a [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]], he could generate a "warp wave" for the purpose of [[teleportation]]. He and his sister [[Lifeguard (comics)|Lifeguard]] were briefly members of the segment of X-Men featured in the series ''X-Treme X-Men.''

==Fictional character history==
He and his sister Heather lived perfectly normal lives at Surfer's Paradise in [[Australia]]. Unfortunately they did not know that their actual father was an underworld crime lord known as [[Viceroy (comics)|Viceroy]], and upon his death they were attacked.  Together with [[Storm (comics)|Storm]] and [[Neal Shaara]] (the new Thunderbird), they managed to defeat their attackers.

Davis was never meant to be a mutant. His latent mutant gene was supposed to be passed down to his children. When Heather's life was endangered, Davis was informed by [[Sage (comics)|Sage]] that his latent mutant power might be helpful to her. He agreed to let her activate it, thus gaining teleportation powers in the form of the "Warp Wave".  Both of the siblings joined this splinter team of X-Men with their newfound powers.  Davis had a brief romance with Storm.

Later, when infiltrating the ship of the intergalactic warlord, [[Khan (comics)|Khan]], Heather's appearance changed and it was suspected that the two had [[Shi'ar]] heritage.  Her brother was unable to see past her new, alien appearance and ran away. [[Lifeguard (comics)|Lifeguard]] and [[Neal Shaara]] (or [[Thunderbird III]]) went in search of him. It is still unknown if Sage's tampering of his genetics has any ''other'' effect at all on him.

He was said to be [[Decimation (comics)|depowered]] in ''New Avengers'' #18. Even if he is confirmed to be depowered, it is still unknown if his Shi-ar heritage will affect him as it did his sister or if [[Sage]]'s tampering of his bio-chemistry will have any negative effects in the future.

==Alternate Versions==
In [[X-Men: The End]], a title presenting one possible future of the X-Men, Slipstream works freely for the slavers. It is eventually revealed that he is seemingly controlled by [[Cassandra Nova]].

==Powers==

Slipstream can teleport to any place on earth using the warp wave. He is also able to sense the location of whomever he chooses, and the best path to reach them.

He uses a special 'surfboard' to help him 'ride' the warp waves teleportational energies.
