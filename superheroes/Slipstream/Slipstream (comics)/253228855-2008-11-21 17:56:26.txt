'''Slipstream''' ('''Davis Cameron''') is a [[fictional character]] in [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He is a [[superhero]] associated with the [[X-Men]]. Created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Salvador Larroca]], he first appeared in ''[[X-Treme X-Men]]'' #6 ([[2001#December|December 2001]]).
 
He is a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]], able to generate a "warp wave" for the purpose of [[teleportation]]. He and his sister [[Lifeguard (comics)|Lifeguard]] were briefly members of the squad of [[X-Men]] featured in the series ''X-Treme X-Men.''

==Fictional character biography==
He and his sister [[Lifeguard (comics)|Heather]] lived perfectly normal lives at [[Surfers Paradise]] in [[Australia]]. Unfortunately they did not know that their actual father was an underworld crime lord known as [[Viceroy (comics)|Viceroy]], and upon his death they were attacked.  When Heather's life was endangered, Davis was informed by [[Sage (comics)|Sage]] that although he was never meant to be a mutant (his latent mutant gene was supposed to be passed down to his children) his mutant power might be helpful to her. He agreed to let her activate it, gaining a teleportational ability in the form of the "warp wave".  Together with [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] and [[Neal Shaara|Thunderbird III]], he and his sister manage to defeat their attackers.  Following these events, both siblings join Storm's team of X-Men.  Davis had a brief romance with Storm.


Later, when infiltrating the ship of the intergalactic warlord, [[Khan (comics)|Khan]], Heather develops a more avian look, leading to speculation that the two have [[Shi'ar]] heritage.  Ultimately, Davis is unable to see past his sister's alien appearance and leaves the X-Men. It isn't known whether or not he and Heather ever reconciled.

He was said to be depowered in ''New Avengers'' #18 as a result of [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]], although not actually shown. It is still unknown if his Shi'ar heritage or the alterations to his bio-chemistry performed by Sage will have any future effects. A recent panel at the San Diego Comic Con mentioned that both Lifeguard and Slipstream would be seen again sometime in 2009.

==Powers and abilities==

Slipstream can teleport to any place on earth using warp waves, or portals that he can use to transport himself and large groups to any point he wishes. He is also able to sense the location of whomever he chooses, and the best path to reach them.

He uses a special 'surfboard' to help him 'ride' the warp waves teleportational energies.

==Other versions==
===X-Men: The End===
In [[X-Men: The End]], a title presenting one possible future of the X-Men, Slipstream works freely for the slavers. It is eventually revealed that he is seemingly controlled by [[Cassandra Nova]].
