'''Slipstream''' (Davis Cameron) is a [[fictional character]], a [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] [[superhero]] in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. Created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Salvador Larroca]], he first appeared in ''[[X-Treme X-Men]]'' #6.

He and his sister Heather lived perfectly normal lives at Surfer's Paradise in [[Australia]]. Unfortunately they did not know that their actual father was an underworld crime lord known as [[Viceroy (comics)|Viceroy]], and upon his death they were attacked.  Together with [[Storm (comics)|Storm]] and [[Thunderbird (comics)|Neal Shaara]] (the new Thunderbird), they managed to defeat their attackers.

When Heather's life was endangered again, Davis was informed by [[Sage (comics)|Sage]] that his latent mutant power would be helpful to her, so he agreed to let her activate it, giving him control of the "Warp Wave".  Both of the siblings joined this splinter team of X-Men with their newfound powers.  Davis had a brief romance with Storm.

Later, when infiltrating the ship of the intergalactic warlord, [[Khan (comics)|Khan]], Heather's appearance changed and it was suspected that the two had [[Shi'ar]] heritage.  Her brother was unable to see past her new, alien appearance and ran away. Lifeguard and Thunderbird went in search of him; his location has yet to be revealed.
