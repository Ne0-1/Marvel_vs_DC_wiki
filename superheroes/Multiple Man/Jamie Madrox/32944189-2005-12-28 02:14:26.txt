'''James Arthur "Jamie" Madrox''', formerly known as the '''Multiple Man''', is a [[fictional character]] and a [[mutant]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Universe]] who runs a detective agency known as [[X-Factor Investigations]].  He first appeared in ''Giant-Size Fantastic Four'' #4.

==Character Biography==
Jamie Madrox was born to a family living near the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] research facility; the background [[radiation]] may have stimulated his mutation. When Jamie was born, the doctorâ€™s slap caused him to multiply into two identical babies, which was rather shocking to both his parents and the doctor. [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]], a friend of the Madrox family, suggested that they move to Kansas to raise the boy in privacy.  Dr. Daniel Madrox, Jamie's father, created a suit for him to wear which was designed to absorb kinetic energy, the presumed source of the duplication.  When Jamie was 15, his parents were killed when a tornado struck their farm and for the next few years he ran the farm by himself until one day when his suit malfunctioned.  Madrox went to New York City for help, where he met [[Mister Fantastic]] of the [[Fantastic Four]]. Mister Fantastic agreed to help him with the suit and informed Professor Xavier of the situation.

Madrox was invited to join the X Men but he declined. Instead, he moved to [[Muir Island]] to assist Dr. [[Moira MacTaggert]] with her research. He was a member of [[X-Factor]] when the group was under [[Valerie Cooper|Val Cooper's]] control. However, during a battle with the would-be savior [[Haven (comics)|Haven]], Madrox was apparently killed as a result the [[Legacy Virus]]. Unknown to all, it was a duplicate who had been infected and died; the real Madrox lived, amnesiac. Although he did not rejoin X-Factor, he did regain his memory and returned to the superheroic life.

For a time, he served as the majority staff for Banshee's X-Corps, who also paid ex-criminals for their service, whose responsibility was to police other mutants who got out of line. Unfortunately things turned sour when a number of the members began rebelling and a number of Madrox's dupes were controlled by Mastermind II to help destroy Paris. Ultimately, he was able to regain control of them, but the memory left him with deep guilt.

A ''MadroX'' miniseries began in 2004, written by [[Peter David]], who had previously written the character in ''X-Factor''. It shows Madrox working as a [[private detective]] in the "Mutant Town" area of [[New York]], along with former X-Factor teammates [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]] and [[Strong Guy]].  It also reveals that he has sent "dupes" out to lead alternate lives, including one who spent years as a [[Shaolin]] monk; this has allowed him to gain years of expertise in certain [[martial art]]s.

After the events in the [[House of M]] crossover, Madrox has upgraded his detective agency to a new building, with new members [[Siryn]], [[Rictor]] and [[M (comics)|M]], along with returning members Wolfsbane and Strong Guy.  He bought the building using the money he won through a [[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire]]-type show, using a room full of dupes as one of his lifelines.

==Powers and abilities==
Madrox's power is the ability to create duplicates of himself at will through an unknown process whenever he is struck or even when he snaps his fingers or stamps his foot. Each of the duplicates is completely capable of independent thought and can create duplicates of himself. The original Madrox can absorb them back into himself at will, at the same time absorbing the memories, skills and experiences of the duplicate. The dupe usually appears to his side or often near a focused area, such as a finger.

During his time with X-Factor, the number of duplicates was probably around 40, but has grown far larger since then.  Duplicates have independent minds from the original, but are usually willing to merge back because their memories and knowledge are retained.  However, there have been exceptions where duplicates have wished for independence completely.

Madrox also uses merging with his duplicates as a form of healing.  Originally, uninjured dupes "shared" the damage when they merged, e.g., if an injured Madrox merged with an uninjured Madrox, the resulting Madrox had an injury half as severe as the original injury.  Now, however, the core Madrox can reabsorb injured or even near-dead dupes without taking on any of their physical injuries at all, although the memories of traumatic experiences still affect him.

==Alternate versions==
*In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, Madrox is a member of the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants|Brotherhood]]. 

*In the [[Age of Apocalypse]], his duplicates became Apocalypse's soldiers, the '''Madri''', where the original Jamie--having been overextended in the use of his powers--sits near-brainless in a room guarded by his duplicates. 

{{spoilers}}
In the [[Earth X]] storyline, Multiple Man and his duplicates became an army of [[Wendigo (comics)|Wendigo]] after he fed on the flesh of one of his duplicates.

==Other Media==
In [[X-Men: The Animated Series]], Multiple Man appeared in the episode "Cold Comfort" as a member of the X-Factor led by the modern day [[Forge (comics)|Forge]]

The animated series ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'' features Jamie Madrox under the codename Multiple, instead of Multiple Man.  In the series, Jamie is a member of a "junior team" of X-Men, roughly equating to the [[New Mutants]].  The reason for the name change was that being a kid, assumed to be the youngest in the Evolution version of The New Mutants, he was not yet a Multiple "Man" in this instance.

The movie [[X-Men 3]] includes Multiple Man, played by [[Eric Dane]], as an ally of the Brotherhood.
