'''Multiple Man''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[mutant]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Universe]] and a former member of [[X-Factor]].  His real name is James (“Jamie”) Madrox.  He first appeared in ''Giant-Size Fantastic Four'' #4.

Jamie’s power is the ability to create duplicates of himself at will through an unknown process whenever he is struck, or even when he snaps his fingers or stamps his foot.  Each of the duplicates is completely capable of independent thought and can create duplicates of himself. The original Madrox can absorb them back into himself at will, at the same time absorbing the memories, skills and experiences of the duplicate.

Jamie was born to a family living near the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] research facility; the background [[radiation]] may have induced his mutation. When Jamie was born, the doctor’s slap caused him to multiply into two identical babies, which was rather a surprise to his parents and the doctor. [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]] suggested that the Madroxes move to Kansas and raise the boy in privacy.  His father created a suit for him to wear which would absorb kinetic energy, the presumed source of the duplication.  When Jamie was 15, his parents were killed by a tornado, and for the next few years he ran the farm by himself until his suit one day malfunctioned.  He ran for help to New York City, where he met [[Mister Fantastic]] of the [[Fantastic Four]]. Mister Fantastic helped him with the suit and informed Professor Xavier of the dilemma.

Jamie was invited to join the X Men, but he declined. Instead, he moved to [[Muir Island]] to assist Dr. [[Moira MacTaggert]] with her research. He was a member of [[X Factor]] when the group was under [[Valerie Cooper|Val Cooper's]] control. However, during a battle with the would-be savior [[Haven (comics)|Haven]], Madrox was apparently killed as a result the [[Legacy Virus]]. Unknown to all, it was a duplicate who had been infected and died; the real Madrox lived, amnesiac. Although he did not rejoin X-Factor, he did regain his memory and returned to the superheroic life.

A ''Madrox'' miniseries began in [[2004]], written by [[Peter David]], who had previously written the character in ''X-Factor''. It shows Madrox working as a [[private detective]] in the "Mutant Town" area of [[New York]]. It also reveals that he has sent "dupes" out to lead alternate lives, including one who spent years as a Buddhist monk.

==Alternate versions==

In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, Madrox is a member of the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants|Brotherhood]]. In the [[Age of Apocalypse]], his duplicates became Apocalypse's soldiers, the Madri. 

The animated series ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'' features Multiple Man as a member of a "junior team" of X-Men, rougly equating to the [[New Mutants]].
