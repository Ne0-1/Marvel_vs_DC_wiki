'''Nightmare''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supernatural]] being who has appeared in many [[Marvel Comics]] stories, most commonly as one of [[Doctor Strange]] and [[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]]'s major enemies.

==Publication history==
The character was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]] in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #110 (July, [[1963]]), the very same issue where the Master of the Mystic Arts first appeared.

==Fictional character biography==
He is the evil ruler of a '[[List of Marvel Comics dimensions|dream dimension]]', where tormented humans are brought during their sleep. He roams this realm on his black [[unicorn]], Dreamstalker. He appears as a chalk-white man with wild green hair, a green bodysuit and a ragged cape. 

Nightmare is a demon from the dimension Everinnye, like his "cousin", the [[Dweller-in-Darkness]]. Nightmare is dependent on the human race's need to dream. Without this ability, Nightmare would cease to exist, but humanity would go insane. At one point Strange and Nightmare had to join forces to prevent that from happening.<ref>Doctor Strange (vol.2) # 53</ref>

Nightmare has run afoul of [[Spider-Man]], [[Captain America]], [[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Ghost Rider]], [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] and the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] on different occasions.

Nightmare also served under [[Shuma-Gorath]] and warned Strange that the demon would be a force that even the Sorcerer Supreme would have trouble defeating.

Nightmare once joined [[Fear Lords (comics)|the Fear Lords]], a group of supernatural creatures who fed on fear, to attack Dr. Strange together. But their plans were undone when [[D'Spayre|D'spayre]] tricks him into competing with the [[Dweller-in-Darkness]] over who could frighten humanity more.<ref>Dr. Strange vol.3 #40</ref>

Nightmare is the father of the [[Dreamqueen]], a similar being who rules her own "dream dimension".

Nightmare's realm is not part of The Mindscape, but the [[Sleepwalker (comics)|Sleepwalkers]] are aware of him and consider him an enemy.  

Because Sleepwalkers do not have to sleep, Nightmare has never been able to affect or dominate them. He sought to do this through the hero Sleepwalker, who had been connected into the brain of the human Rick Sheridan. Nightmare sent Sleepwalker back to his own realm, with a monitor to assure the hero Rick was not being tormented. Rick was being tormented, with the intent of driving Sleepwalker mad and thus giving Nightmare access the minds of Sleepwalker's people. The hero was not fooled and sacrificed his return home in order to stop Nightmare.

Later, Nightmare was able to access human minds through the concept of the 'American dream'. Many people who were deeply patriotic or had achieved a degree of success through hard work were going on violent rampages. Nightmare was soon stopped by the combined forces of [[Captain America]], [[Sharon Carter]] and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]].

In the ''Tempest Fugit'' storyline of ''The Incredible Hulk'' it is revealed that Nightmare has been plaguing the Hulk for years with hallucinations, misdirections, and manipulations of reality, by empowering himself from the effects of the [[9/11]] terrorist attacks.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol.3, #81</ref> His second, more benevolent, daughter ''Daydream'' is also introduced in this storyarc. Nightmare here claimed that this daughter was conceived by forcibly entering the mind of the Hulk's late wife, [[Betty Ross|Betty Ross Banner]], and is temporarily killed by the Hulk in retaliation.

Nightmare appeared in in the [[Secret Invasion|"Secret Invasion"]] arc of ''[[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|The Incredible Hercules]]''. Hercules and the [[God Squad (comics)|God Squad]], making their way to the [[Skrull]] gods' realm, require a map of the [[Dreamtime]], and barter with Nightmare for it. Nightmare agrees, in exchange for access to the fears of the five gods; however, he actually intends to use these divine fears to conquer the world. Hercules and the others escape his realm, having stolen the map via trickery.

Nightmare is now plotting to conquer the entirety of fiction, adding it to his realm of nightmares.<ref>''Fantastic Four: True Story #2''</ref>

In the Avengers: The Initiative Special, it was revealed that Nightmare is [[Trauma (comics)|Trauma]]'s father, which explains Trauma's fear powers.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative Special''</ref>

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Nightmare===
In Ultimate Spider-Man, Nightmare appeared as a demon who entered Doctor Strange's mind and plagued it with nightmares. When Spider-Man entered the building Nightmare moved to Spider-Man's mind and plagued him with nightmares. Doctor Strange eventually entered Spider-Man's mind via a spell and vanquished the demon Nightmare. Nightmare can shape shift into different forms based on the victim's memories. His main appearance was as a half-rotted, grey corpse.
