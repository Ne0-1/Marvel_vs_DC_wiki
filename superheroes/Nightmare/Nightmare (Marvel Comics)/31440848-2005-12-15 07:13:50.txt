'''Nightmare''' is a fictional [[supernatural]] being who has appeared in many [[Marvel Comics]] stories, most commonly as one of [[Doctor Strange]]'s major enemies.

He is the evil ruler of a 'dream dimension', where tormented humans are brought during their sleep, and that he roams on his black [[unicorn]] (possibly a mare, and thus a pun on his name: Night Mare.) He appears as a chalk-white man with wild, green hair, and wearing a green bodysuit and a ragged cape.

The character was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]] in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #110 (July, [[1963]]), the very same issue where the Master of the Mystic Arts first appeared.

Nightmare is a creation of the human race's need to dream. Without this ability, Nightmare would cease to exist, but humanity would go insane. At one point Strange and Nightmare had to join forces to prevent that from happening (in Doctor Strange (vol.2) # 53).

Nightmare once joined the "Fear Lords", a group of supernatural creatures who fed on fear, to attack Dr. Strange together. But their plans were undone when [[D'spayre]] tricked him into competing with the [[Dweller in Darkness]] over who could frighten humanity more. (Dr. Strange vol.3 #40)

Note that there are several similarities between this character and [[Neil Gaiman]]'s version of the [[Sandman (DC Comics Modern Age)|Sandman]]. Note also that during the period of Sandman's popularity, Marvel had Nighmare star in  a mini-series with a similar style (Nightmare: A Killer of a Love Story).

Nightmare is the father of the [[Dreamqueen]], a similar but lesser being who rules her own "dream dimension".

Nightmare's realm is NOT part of The Mindscape, but the [[Sleepwalker (comics)|Sleepwalkers]] are aware of him and consider him an enemy.  

Because Sleepwalkers do not have to sleep, Nightmare has never been able to affect or dominate them.  He sought to do this through the hero Sleepwalker.  He sent Sleepy (as he is called by his fans) back to with a monitor that would allow Sleepwalker to see that Nightmare was keeping up his end of the deal (not harming the human).  In reality he intended Sleepy to witness the torment he planned to unleash on Sleepwalker's human "host," therefore driving Sleepy mad, and giving him some semblance of influence over the Sleepwalkers and the Mindscape.  Sleepy was not fooled and sacrificed his return home for just one human's good night's sleep.

[[Neil Gaiman]]'s famous version of the [[DC comics]] character [[The Sandman (DC Comics Modern Age)|The Sandman]], draws inspiration from Nightmare.
