'''Drax the Destroyer''' ('''Arthur Douglas''') is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Creation and early life===
Arthur Douglas, a real estate agent and sometime musician, was born in [[Burbank, California]].
Arthur and his wife Yvette, and their daughter Heather are driving across the [[Mojave Desert]] from [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] to [[Los Angeles]] when a spaceship carrying the mad Titan [[Thanos]] passes overhead on a surveillance mission to Earth. Wishing to keep his existence a secret, Thanos destroys the automobile in case its passengers observed his ship.  Thanos lands to make certain they are dead and, satisfied, he leaves. Unknown to the Titan, his father, [[A'lars|Mentor]], had been monitoring his activities on Earth. Mentor discovers that Heather Douglas is still alive and takes her back to Titan. She later returns to Earth as [[Moondragon]]. 

Mentor determines that the threat of his son Thanos can no longer be ignored and decides to create a being of sufficient power to defeat Thanos. Enlisting the aid of his father [[Kronos (comics)|Chronos]], who millennia before had become a discorporate wraith, Mentor has Chronos seize the astral form (living consciousness) of Arthur Douglas before it can completely flee the mortal plane. Chronos and Mentor then fashion a humanoid body from immutable soil, grant it superhuman powers, and empower it with Douglas' spirit. Thus, the being who becomes known as Drax the Destroyer is created. 

Mentor blocks all of Drax's memories of his old life, instilling in him a monomaniacal hate for and an obsession to destroy Thanos. For years, Drax serves as Thanos's nemesis, thwarting certain of the Titan's plans, but never finally crushing Thanos himself. Thanos hired legions of alien mercenaries just to keep Drax away from him. Finally, in Thanos's campaign to possess the [[Cosmic Cube]], Drax, in the company of [[Avengers (comics)|the Avengers]], [[Mar-Vell|Captain Marvel]] and Moondragon, sees Thanos destroyed. Suddenly lacking a reason for existence, Drax wanders space in grim contemplation. By the time he learns that Thanos had managed to rematerialize himself, Thanos has once again been killed. Drax, purposeless again, battles Captain Marvel to vent his frustrations.

Sometime later, Drax is contacted by his daughter Moondragon and invited to join her in her journey through space in search of knowledge. Drax accepts the offer, and the two travel aboard Moondragon's personal starship, Sensia.  Eventually, they come upon the planet Ba Banis, a world of humanoid aliens caught in a vast civil war. Moondragon uses her mental powers to quell the conflict and then decides to set herself up as the world's goddess. Drax recognizes that her ambitions are ignoble and so sends their ship to Earth with a holographic distress message. The Avengers respond and discover Moondragon's world of mentally enforced tranquility. Freed by the Avengers from his daughter's mental domination, Drax advances toward her, seeking to end her menace. In order to stop him, Moondragon mentally forces Drax's life essence to vacate his artificial body.<ref>Avengers #220</ref> Later, after subduing Moondragon and returning to Earth, the Avengers place Drax's body inside the Sensia and send it into space programmed to self destruct. Without Drax's spirit inside it, Drax's body is destroyed when the Sensia exploded.

===Infinity Watch===
Several years later, when Thanos is resurrected by [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Mistress Death]], Chronos reanimates the Destroyer to again combat his mad grandson, and grants him with even greater physical power. However, Chronos does not consider the effects of Drax's death, and the Destroyer's mind retains the damage done by Moondragon. Despite this setback and following Thanos' defeat and the subsequent breakup of the [[Infinity Gauntlet]], Drax is chosen by [[Adam Warlock]] to safeguard the Power Gem as part of the [[Infinity Watch]]. During his time on the team, it is feared he would regain his memories and attempt to slay Moondragon for what she had done to him. Drax rarely shows any signs of violence towards his friends. He is portrayed as gentle, sometimes even playing the saxophone.

Drax takes part in the [[Infinity Crusade]] and [[Infinity War]], but mostly as muscle, doing little more than beating adversaries into submission.

Eventually, due to internal strife, the Watch fragments and go their separate ways. Afterward, Drax returns to Titan with Moondragon, who successfully petitions Chronos to restore Drax's mind to its former acuity at the cost of some physical power. Thus, Drax is restored to his original condition. 

Drax is then accused of the murder of [[Elysius]] and several others. However, he is cleared when Warlock, [[Gamora]], [[Pip the Troll]], and [[Genis-Vell]] discover that the creature [[Syphon (Marvel Comics)|Syphon]] is manipulating Drax.

Following this event, Drax's condition begins to change. His mass and strength climb back to previous levels, and his mind becomes clouded. Finally, he seeks out Moondragon, which leads to an altercation with Genis-Vell, the son of [[Mar-Vell]]. In the course of this struggle, Drax is transported to the [[Microverse]] with Genis, where, for a time, he finds acceptance and happiness on the planet [[K'ai]].

===Reborn===

Drax is later seen on a ship with [[Paibok]], [[Lunatik]], and the [[Blood Brothers (comics)|Blood Brothers]]. They are to have been transported to an intergalactic prison, but the ship crashes on Earth under mysterious circumstances. Drax attacks the others to keep them from harming innocent lives. His intelligence comes back to him at random intervals during his fight with the other prisoner. (As stated by writer [[Peter David]], Drax's intelligence/power levels have been in a state of flux since at least 1996, his strength diminishing whenever his intelligence grew, and vice versa.)  While on Earth and at a low-point of intelligence he wanders through Alaska and confuses a young girl named Cammi for his daughter.  As he slowly wanders through the country side he encounters Paibok yet again.  Paibok ruthlessly murders him, yet Drax emerges with a new body with a higher intelligence and possibly other unknown abilities.  This "new" Drax kills Lunatik and one of the Blood Brothers.  The mini-series ends with Drax and Cammi back on a prison ship.

===Annihilation===
{{main|Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation}}
Drax plays a role in the 2006 ''Annihilation'' crossover event, written by [[Keith Giffen]].  Surviving [[Annihilus]]' attack on the intergalactic prison known as the [[Kyln]], Drax and Cammi team up with the last member of the Xandarian Nova Corps, [[Nova (comics)|Richard Rider]]. Together they fight against the advancing Annihilation Wave.  Drax teaches Nova the power of concentration so that he may contain the entire Nova force.  Moreover, Nova asks Drax to teach him an important lesson:  How to destroy.

During a doomed battle between the Annihilation Wave and the [[United Front (comics)|United Front]] on Daedalus 5, Drax stays behind to fight off the invaders while [[Nova (comics)|Nova]] and the rest of the group (including Cammi) finish the evacuation. Drax fights his way to one of the Annihilation Wave's ships in his quest for Thanos. He finds the Titan attempting to release [[Galactus]] from his prison on Annihilus' mother ship. Before Thanos can release Galactus using his unique energy signature, Drax breaks through Thanos' defensive shield and punches a hole through the Titan's chest.  Drax then realizes that they could "trick" the security system into shutting off by using the Silver Surfer, which succeeds.  Once Galactus is freed, he teleports Moondragon and Drax to a far-off planet to spare them from his wrath on the Annihilation Wave.  Afterwards, Moondragon says Drax just "disappeared", with it heavily implied she was covering for him.

==Powers and abilities==
Drax's powers at one point included super strength, energy blasts, tremendous resilience, flight, and the ability to survive and travel at high speeds in [[outer space]] and [[hyperspace]]. While wearing the [[Power Gem]] his power was such that he could destroy planets with a single blow and rip apart the core inside a star causing it to explode. His own strength, without an infinitely powerful external power-source, has been compared with that of the merged incarnation of the [[Hulk (comics)#Merged Hulk/The Professor|Hulk]], but lacking the latter's rage-fueled potential. He had bright green skin, and almost always wore a purple skullcap.

As of the 2006 "Annihilation" mini-series, Drax has again "died" and undergone a "rebirth," appearing to have lost some of his strength and resilience, as well as his ability to fly and shoot energy blasts. However, his intellect has returned to its original level, and he has taken a liking to using knives in battle. He has also appeared for the first time without his usual purple uniform and skullcap, and gained scarlet tattoos instead.  In addition, he has gained a sidekick of sorts, a young earth girl named Cammi whom he seems determined to protect at all costs. As a result of the Annihilation wave, he has also become a mentor to [[Nova (comics)|Nova]], the sole remaining member of the [[Nova Corps]].

In issue #4 of "Annihilation," Drax displayed an  ability heretofore unseen in any of his previous incarnations; while in close proximity to Thanos's body, his own body emitted a strange, form-fitting aura; shortly thereafter, he punched straight through the Mad Titan's chest with a single blow. Given the tremendous displays of Thanos's durability over the years and his ability to withstand the blows of stronger opponents, it can only be assumed that the energy field that Drax manifested was designed for that purpose.

==Other media==
Drax appeared in an episode of the [[Silver Surfer (animated series)|''Silver Surfer'' animated series]] as an [[android]] and a companion of Mentor, brother of Thanos.  Though [[Eros]] is a brother of Thanos, Mentor became the brother due to a typographical error in the script.
