Sometime later, Drax is possessed by an alien entity and battles [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and his daughter Moondragon. When Drax recovers, he and Moondragon journey through space in search of knowledge.<ref>''Thor'' #314</ref> Eventually, they come upon the planet Ba-Banis, a world of humanoid aliens caught in a vast civil war. Moondragon uses her mental powers to quell the conflict and then decides to set herself up as the world's goddess.

The Avengers respond and discover Moondragon's world of mentally enforced tranquility.

===Infinity Watch===
{{Main|Infinity Watch}}
When Thanos is resurrected by [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Mistress Death]], Chronos reanimates the Destroyer and grants him even greater physical power.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 3 #35</ref> However, Chronos does not consider the effects of Drax's death, and the Destroyer's mind retains the damage done by Moondragon. Alongside a multitude of other heroes, Drax helped battle Thanos and [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]] for possession of the [[Infinity Gauntlet]].<ref>''Infinity Gauntlet'' #1-6</ref> Drax is chosen by [[Adam Warlock]] to safeguard the [[Infinity Gems|Power Gem]] as part of the [[Infinity Watch]].<ref>''Warlock and the Infinity Watch'' #2</ref>

Thus, Drax is restored to his original condition.<ref>''Cosmic Powers Unlimited'' #3</ref>

Drax is then accused of the murder of [[Elysius]] and several others. However, he is cleared when Warlock, [[Gamora]], [[Pip the Troll]], and [[Genis-Vell]] discover that the creature [[Syphon (Marvel Comics)|Syphon]] is manipulating Drax.<ref>''Warlock'' vol 3 #1-4</ref>

Later, Drax seeks out Moondragon, which leads to an altercation with Genis-Vell.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' vol 4 #4</ref> In the course of this struggle, Drax is transported to the [[Microverse]] with Genis, where, for a time, he finds acceptance and happiness on the planet [[K'ai]].<ref>''Captain Marvel'' vol 4 #6-8</ref>

The ship crashes in Alaska, and Drax attacks the others to keep them from harming innocent lives.<ref>''Drax the Destroyer'' #1 (2005)</ref> He mistakes a young girl named Cammi for his daughter, and tries to protect her from Paibok.  Drax appears to be killed, but a slimmer, smarter Drax emerges from the larger shell of the dead body.<ref>''Drax the Destroyer'' #3 (2005)</ref> When a second prison ship arrives to recapture the prisoners, both Drax and Cammi are arrested.<ref>''Drax the Destroyer'' #4 (2005)</ref>

===Annihilation===
{{Main|Annihilation (comics)}}
Surviving [[Annihilus]]' attack on the intergalactic prison known as the [[Kyln]], Drax and Cammi team up with the last member of the Xandarian Nova Corps, [[Nova (comics)|Richard Rider]]. Together they fight against the advancing Annihilation Wave as Drax trains Nova to be a warrior.<ref>''Annihilation: Nova'' #4 (2006)</ref>

Drax learns that Thanos has taken Moondragon hostage, and that she will be killed if Drax pursues him.<ref>''Annihilation'' #1 (2006)</ref> During a doomed battle between the Annihilation Wave and the [[United Front (comics)|United Front]], Drax stays behind to fight off the invaders while [[Nova (comics)|Nova]] and the rest of the group (including Cammi) finish the evacuation.<ref>''Annihilation'' #3 (2006)</ref> Drax fights his way to one of the Annihilation Wave's ships. He finds Thanos on Annihilus' mother ship and kills him. Drax helps to free a captive Galactus, who teleports Moondragon and Drax to a far-off planet to spare them from his wrath on the Annihilation Wave.<ref>''Annihilation'' #5</ref>  Afterwards, Moondragon says Drax just "disappeared." Cammi is later seen, alive, allied with one of Thanos' powerful, miniature assistants.<ref>''Annihilation'' #6</ref>

===Annihilation: Conquest===
{{Main|Annihilation: Conquest}}
During the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phanlanx]]'s invasion of the [[Kree]] home-world, Drax was assimilated as a "select" of the hive mind. They dispatch him along with [[Gamora]] to apprehend Nova after he flees the planet.<ref>''Nova'' Vol. 4 #7</ref>
Following Nova to Kvch, the home planet of the parental race of the Phalanx, the [[Technarchy]], Drax and Gamora are freed from the Phalanx by the Technarch Tyro. Together they return to Hala where they help in the defeat of [[Ultron]].<ref>''Annihilation: Conquest'' #6</ref>

[[Star-Lord]] recruits Drax for the new [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]].<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol 2 #1</ref>

===The Thanos Imperative===
{{Main|The Thanos Imperative}}

The Guardians are forced to ally themselves with Thanos and travel into an alternate reality.<ref>''The Thanos Imperative'' #1 (2010)</ref> Drax experiences a bout of maddness and attacks Thanos. Drax is killed.<ref>''The Thanos Imperative'' #3 (2010)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Drax's powers include super strength, tremendous resilience, flight, and the ability to project concussive blasts of cosmic energy from his hands. He can also travel at high speeds in [[outer space]] and [[Hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]] without air, food, or water. Drax also possessed the ability to sense the presence of [[Thanos]] across vast distances.

After his resurrection, his physical might increased, but he suffered severe mental disability in his new incarnation.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol 3 #35 (1990)</ref> Instead of his ability to sense Thanos across vast distances, he now possessed the ability to sense when beings have been in recent contact with Thanos, and a precognitive ability to sense when beings will be in contact with Thanos in the near future.

Drax's strength has been compared with that of the merged incarnation of the [[Hulk (comics)#Merged Hulk/The Professor|Hulk]], but lacking the latter's rage-fueled potential.

During the 2006 "Annihilation" mini-series, Drax lost some of his strength, resilience, flight, and energy blasts. However, his intellect has returned to its original level, and he has taken a liking to using knives in battle.<ref>''Drax the Destroyer'' #4 (2005)</ref><ref>''Annhilation: Nova'' #1-4 (2006)</ref> At least temporarily, he had the ability to pass through Thanos' force field.<ref>''Annihilation'' #4 (Nov 2006)</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
* Drax appeared in an episode of the ''[[Silver Surfer (TV series)|Silver Surfer]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Norm Spencer]]. He is seen as an [[Android (robot)|android]] and a companion of Mentor, brother of Thanos. Though [[Starfox (comics)|Eros]] is a brother of Thanos, Mentor became the brother due to a typographical error in the script.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvelite.prohosting.com/surfer/toon/lbrody.html |title=Interview with Larry Brody |publisher=Marvelite.prohosting.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-12}}</ref>
