'''Metal Men''' are a team of [[robot]] [[superhero|superheroes]] created by writer [[Robert Kanigher]], pencilled by [[Ross Andru]] and inked by [[Mike Esposito (comics artist)|Mike Esposito]] for [[DC Comics]] in [[1962]]. They made their first appearance in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #37--#40 as part of a four-issue series created as a last-minute filler feature. They proved unexpectedly popular and the characters were revived for more stories under their own title, and had subsequent appearances in various series in the DC Universe.

==Biography==
The Metal Men were presented as advanced [[artificially intelligent]] robots, created by scientist [[Will Magnus|Dr. William "Will" Magnus]]. "Doc" Magnus (as his creations affectionately call him) states that their intelligence and personalities are generated by devices called "responsometers". They mirror characteristics commonly associated with the various [[metal]]s that are their namesakes, both in personality and in substance; according to some accounts, they are actually composed of their namesake metal, while in others, they are made of a chemical substance that can duplicate the properties of a specific metal, determined by the programming in their individual "responsometers".

The team consisted of their field leader [[Gold]], strong man [[Iron]], slow-witted loyal [[Lead]], self-doubting and insecure [[Tin]], hot-headed [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]], and [[Platinum]], or Tina, who thought she was a real woman rather than a robot and was, in a [[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]] twist, in love with creator Doc Magnus. Tin later kit-built himself a girlfriend whom he called "Nameless" who shared some adventures.

Each of the individual Metal Men had abilities that reflected the traits of their namesake metal.  Gold could flatten himself down, Iron was super strong, Lead could morph into a shield to block harmful radiation and the like, and Mercury could melt and reform himself.

The Metal Men's main foes included [[Chemo (comics)|Chemo]] (a mobile plastic giant filled with various lethal chemicals), the robotic alien [[Missile Men]], the [[Gas Gang]], and other mechanical menaces such as a robotic T-Rex, robo-centaur, robot-[[Egg Fu]], the Sizzler, and nefarious amusement park rides. On several occasions Doc made new robots of different metals such as Uranium, Silver, Cobalt, Chromium, and others, including counterpart "boyfriend and girlfriend" robots. The new robots always went to the scrap heap. The Metal Men also had many adventures on other planets, usually meeting robot menaces.

''The Metal Men'' had a broken run of sixty issues in their own comic book title. Their [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] series of issues #1 to #41 began in [[1963]] and ended in [[1970]]. Their adventures were fast-paced, light-hearted, ripe with melodrama and sentimentality, and loaded with "make it up as you go along" leaps in logic that made a charming whole. Many issues included the feature "Metal Facts & Fancies" with real metal facts and whimsical drawings. 

As part of a company-wide effort to retool their books into a more "hip" and "relevant" style of plotting, the 33rd issue featured the first of two changes of direction â€“ Doc Magnus was comatose from an injury, while the Metal Men found themselves hunted by the authorities after faulty responsometers were installed. When this change in direction resulted in a massive sales drop, a second retooling was implemented where each assumed a human identity. The "New Metal Men" then were assigned the task of apprehending Doc Magnus, who himself had now become a fugitive after having been kidnapped, reawakened and brainwashed by a mad dictator, and turned into a scientist dedicated towards global conquest. Sales took an even more severe nosedive, and the series was cancelled with the 41st issue.  

The Metal Men reappeared in [[1973]] in three reprint issues (#42, 43 and 44). They returned with new stories in #45 (April-May [[1976]]) by artist [[Walt Simonson]] (who would go on to work on [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]) and various writers. Doc Magnus's sanity was restored and he once again joined his robot creations. Simsonson was succeeded as artist by [[Joe Staton]]. The team's run as regular headliners ended at #56 in [[1978]], where despite acceptable sales the book fell victim to the [[DC Implosion]].

The Metal Men have appeared as guests in several other comic book titles including ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' (#55, #66, #74, #103, #113, #121, #135-136, and #187) where they teamed-up with Metamorpho, the Atom, and several times, [[Batman]]. Most memorable of all was #187, which explored the mysterious disappearance of Nameless, Tin's homemade girlfriend.

The Metal Men also guest starred alongside [[Superman]] in ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' (#4 and #70) and ''[[Action Comics]]'' when it became a team-up title under the direction of artist/writer [[John Byrne]].

Doc Magnus helped rebuild Cliff Steele, also known as [[Robotman (Cliff Steele)|Robotman]] of the [[Doom Patrol]], and made several other appearances in that title.

A four book mini-series (numbered #1-4) was printed in [[1993]]. In a [[retcon]] of their origin story, it was revealed that the Metal Men carry the intellects and personalities of Doc's brother, his fiancee, two lab workers, a janitor, and a pizza-delivery man. These unfortunates' personalities were accidentally transferred to blank robots in a lab accident. Thus the Metal Men were not artificially generated by "responsometers" as previously stated. In the fast and furious climax, Gold was permanently killed and Doc Magnus mortally wounded. Doc permanently transferred his personality into a blank robot known as [[Veridium]], made of a green alien metal. Doc became the new robotic leader of the Metal Men.  This episode has itself been retconned away as a delusion suffered by Doc Magnus ([[52 (comic book)|52]] Week 22).

===Infinite Crisis and One Year Later===

{{spoilerabout|[[Infinite Crisis]]}}
As revealed during ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', when [[Superboy-Prime]] pounded on the walls of reality, he caused the very fabric of reality to shift, changing and merging histories. The "blank robots with responsometers" origin has returned into continuity and the "human personalities and Doc as Veridium" origin has been dismissed as delusions suffered by Doc Magnus after his first mental breakdown. 

The responsometers now contain an "artificial soul", invented by Doc Magnus with inspiration from [[T. O. Morrow]], when the latter was a college teacher for the young Magnus. After the unexplained dismantling of the Metal Men, Doc Magnus was unable to restore their personalities. He now takes [[Prozac]] for clinical depression. When Morrow supplied his former student with a string in machine code, Magnus was able to revive Mercury. 

Meanwhile, government agents hover around hoping to use the Metal Men as soulless smart weapons, and the mysterious conspiracy responsible for the kidnapping of all mad scientists in the DCU, destroyed his house, and the newly reborn Mercury with Metal Men mindless replicas.  Doc Magnus has been involuntarily recruited to Oolong Island along with many other "mad" scientists to build ultimate weapons for a mysterious master, who seems to be a cyborg [[Egg Fu]].

{{main|One Year Later}}
As of ''Justice League of America'' #1, Platinum is now re-assembled, but at the end of the issue an unknown assailant decapitates both Gold and Platinum to steal the body of the Red Tornado. 

The entire team of Metal Men are also expected to make a further appearance in a three part Superman/Batman story that will include new member, Copper, a female motherly figure for the others. A revived Platinum now calling herself Platina, along with the others will all be employed by Waynetech. (Wizard 183){{fact}}

===Earth-Two Metal Men from Jupiter===

In All Star Comics #26, scientist Hebert Crawford enlists the aid of "Metal Men from Jupiter", beings made completely of metal, to steal various objects for him. These beings consume various metals in order to survive, and the [[Justice Society of America]] exploits various properties of their diet in order to neutralize them. These beings were never seen again after this case.

==Appearances in other media==

The Metal Men are brainwashed destruct-robs in the Elseworlds mini-series, ''The Nail''. They battle [[Wonder Woman]] after destroying the [[White House]].

A possible future version of the Metal Men in a combined form called [[Alloy]] appears in artist [[Alex Ross]] and [[Mark Waid]]'s ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]''. Alloy appeared in modern continuity in ''Superman: Man of Steel 1000000'' (part of the "DC One Million" event). The Metal Men, driven insane by the Hourman Virus, attack Superman, at one point combining into Alloy. 

In the 31st Century, the Metal Men were misremembered as JSA-like superheroes: Mercury like the mythical god, Gold as a knight, Iron in a hard hat, Lead as a masked wrestler, and [[Rin Tin Tin|Tin as a dog]]). (Legionnaires 38.)

The Metal Men showed up in some [[DC One Million]] titles. Platinum played a special role, giving the citizens of the 853rd century an oral history of the [[Superman]] lineage.

Another appearance of note is the Metal Men entry in the [[Bizarro Comics]] story "The Tinocchio Syndrome" by [[Bob Fingerman]] and [[Pat McEown]] in which the team disguise themselves as humans and spends an evening in a dance bar, with mixed results.

Available Metal Men merchandise has included t-shirts, a collector's plate by [[Alex Ross]] and a [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] figure set.

A version called the Magnetic Men appeared in the DC/Marvel crossover "[[Amalgam Comics]]"; see [[Amalgam_Comics#Magneto_.26_The_Magnetic_Men|Magneto & The Magnetic Men]] and [[Amalgam_Comics#Magnetic_Men_Featuring_Magneto|Magnetic Men Featuring Magneto]]. These versions are robots created by 'Magneto' (an amalgam of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] and Will Magnus) based on members of the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] and named after [[Magnetism|magnetic]] or [[Diamagnetism|diamagnetic]] metals: a version of the [[Toad (comics)|Toad]] called [[Bismuth]], etc.

===Film===
{{future film}}
During an interview with superherohype.com on [[April 9]], [[2006]], Lauren Shuler Donner, producer of the [[X-Men (film)|X-Men trilogy]], expressed interest in developing Metal Men into a movie like "Men in Black", a light film with "a lot of CGI."  On [[November 19]] Donner confirmed in an interview with IESB.net that she was indeed in the early stages of developing the movie with Warner Bros.
