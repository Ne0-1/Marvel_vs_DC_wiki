'''The Metal Men''' is a team of [[robotic]] [[superheroes]] published by [[DC Comics]] created by [[Robert Kanigher]] in [[1962]].  

They are a team of advanced [[artificially intelligent]] [[robot]]s, created by the scientist Dr. Will Magnus.   Their molecular compositions and personalities each mirror the commonly associated characteristics of various [[metal]]s.

This series was created as a last minute filler feature for ''[[Showcase (DC Comics)|Showcase]]''.  It proved unexpectedly popular and the characters were revived for more stories which included various regular series and mini-series over the years.
