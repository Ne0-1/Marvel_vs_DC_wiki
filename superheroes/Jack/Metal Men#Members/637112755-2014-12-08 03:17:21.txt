The '''Metal Men''' are [[fictional characters]] that appear in [[comic books]] published by [[DC Comics]]. The characters first appeared in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #37 and were created by writer [[Robert Kanigher]] and penciller [[Ross Andru]].<ref>{{cite book|last=McAvennie|first= Michael|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 105 |quote = Writer/editor Robert Kanigher and artist Ross Andru put a then-modern-day spin on robots with the exploits of comics' first "heavy metal" group, the Metal Men.}}</ref> Debuting in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], the characters have appeared in comic books and other ''DC Comics''-related products such as [[animated]] [[television series]], clothing, [[figurine]]s and [[trading card]]s.

==Publication history==

===1960s and 1970s===
Established as advanced [[artificially intelligent]] [[robot]]s, the Metal Men were introduced in the comic book ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #37 as "last minute" filler.<ref>[http://www.themetalmen.com/index.htm]</ref> Created by scientist [[Will Magnus|Dr. William "Will" Magnus]], the six robots were field leader [[Gold]], strong man [[Iron]], slow-witted and loyal [[Lead]], hot-headed [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]], self-doubting and insecure [[Tin]], and [[Platinum]] (also called "Tina"), who believed she was a real woman and was in love with her creator. The group's personalities mirrored their namesake [[metal]]s, being dictated by devices called "responsometers".<ref>{{cite book |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia|last= |first= |year=2004|publisher=Dorling Kindersley Limited|isbn=0-7566-0592-X|page=201}}</ref> Each Metal Man also possessed abilities that reflected the traits of their namesake metal: Gold could stretch his form almost infinitely, Iron was super strong. Lead could block harmful radiation by morphing into thick shields, Mercury could melt and pass through small spaces before reforming, while Platinum and Tin could stretch, flatten or spin into fine filaments 

The characters reappeared in the following three issues of ''Showcase'' (#38 - 40, June. Aug. & Oct. 1962) and proved popular enough to warrant a reappearance in their own [[eponymous]] title. First published in May 1963, the title ran on a bi-monthly schedule with original stories until ''Metal Men'' #41 (Dec. 1969). A second female robot (created by Tin) was introduced in issue #13 (April–May 1965), and was later (issue #15, August–September 1965) christened as "Nameless", last appearing in issue #32.<ref>http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~cje/mh/ME/metal.html</ref> The tone changed with issue #33 (Sept. 1968) and shortly after the team adopted human identities in issue #37 (May 1969) the title was cancelled, the last issue being #41 (Dec. 1969).

Issues #42, 43 and 44 (March, May and July 1973) reprinted earlier ''Showcase'' appearances and the first issue, with the title then on [[wikt:hiatus|hiatus]] until returning with original numbering in issue #45 (May 1976). The bi-monthly publishing schedule continued until issue #56 (March 1978), when the title and many others were cancelled due to the [[DC Implosion]].

The Metal Men co-starred with other DC heroes such as [[Atom (DC Comics)|Atom]], [[Metamorpho]] and [[Batman]] in ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' #55 (Sept. 1964), #66 (July 1966), #74 (Nov. 1967), #103 (Nov. 1972), #113 (July 1974), #121 (Sept. 1975), #135-136 (July-Sept. 1977) and #187 (June 1982). This trend was repeated with [[Superman]] in ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' #4 (Dec. 1978) and #70 (June 1984), and an appearance in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #100 (May 1978).

===1990s===
The group returned in an eponymous four issue limited series (''Metal Men'', vol. 2, #1 - 4, Oct. 1993 - Jan. 1994) that featured a [[retcon]] of the characters' origin story. A laboratory accident transfers the intellects and personalities of Doctor Magnus' brother Mike, his fiancee Sharon, laboratory workers Redmond Wilde and Randy Pressman, Thomas Tinkham and a pizza-delivery man named Jack to blank robots (Gold, Platinum, Mercury and Iron, Tin and Lead respectively). During a battle, Gold is killed<ref>{{cite book |title=The Dark Age: Grim, Great & Gimmicky Post-Modern Comics|last=Voger|first=Mark|year= 2006|publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing|isbn=978-1-893905-53-5|page=134}}</ref> and Doctor Magnus mortally wounded, being forced to transfer his personality into a robot known as '''[[Veridium]]'''. Magnus then becomes the leader of the Metal Men. Lead later makes a brief appearance as a worker at a superhero bar, and is temporarily damaged while protecting civilians.<ref>"Guy Gardner Warrior" #38 (Jan. 1996)</ref>

===2000s===
The Metal Men then reappeared during the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' storyline (''Infinite Crisis'' #1 - 7, Dec. 2005 - June 2006, ''Villains United'' #1 - 6, July - Dec. 2005), battling the [[OMAC (comics)|O.M.A.C.S]] [[cyborg]]s and acting as part of a superhero strike force assembled to protect the city of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] from the [[Secret Society of Supervillains]]. Several of the Metal Men appeared in ''[[Justice League of America]]'' #1 (vol. 2, Aug. 2006), with the events of the limited series eventually revised and presented as a delusion suffered by Doctor Magnus in ''52'', #22 (Oct. 2006).

The entire group reappeared in ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' #34-36 (May, July-Aug. 2007), having been rebuilt and upgraded and including a new female member, the sarcastic [[Copper]]. Employed by [[Lucius Fox]] as security for WayneTech, the Metal Men temporarily fall under the influence of [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]]. The group starred in another eponymous limited series, running for eight issues (''Metal Men'' vol. 3, #1 - 8 Oct. 2007 - June 2008). David Magnus, another brother of Will and Mike Magnus attempts to avert a catastrophic future and prevent the creation of the group, and uses a device stolen from the villain [[T. O. Morrow]] to change the Metal Men into evil, radioactive versions based on other metals, called the '''Death Metal Men''' ([[Uranium]] (Iron), [[Strontium]] (Mercury), [[Thorium]] (Platinum), [[Radium]] (Gold), [[Lithium]] (Copper), [[Polonium]] (Lead), and [[Fermium]] (Tin)). Doctor Magnus, however, is able to reverse the process and with the Metal Men and the assistance of the alien robot [[L-Ron]], defeat his brother.

The Metal Men also featured in a stand-alone story in the weekly publication ''[[Wednesday Comics]]'' (#1 - 12, Sept. - Nov. 2009), and co-starred in the first seven issues of ''[[Doom Patrol]]'' (vol. 5, Oct. 2009 - April 2010). This series was later reprinted in ''DC Comics Presents: Metal Men 100 Page Spectacular'' (2011).

The Metal Men appeared in ''[[Justice League: Generation Lost]]'' #10-11 (Nov.- Dec. 2010). Captured by villain [[Maxwell Lord]], the Metal Men are reprogrammed and believe themselves to be humans living in a magical fantasy world. At Lord's behest, the brainwashed Metal Men attack the members of the new [[Justice League International]] (thinking them monsters), and merge into their [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] persona '''Alloy''' (from the limited series ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'' (#1 - 4, May - Aug. 1996)), but are eventually defeated.

===2010s===
In ''[[The New 52]]'' (a reboot of the DC Comics universe), the Metal Men were created by Doctor Magnus but subsequently disappeared. [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] locates Magnus and learns the scientist was tasked by the military with the creation of a rescue team that could enter toxic environments. Although successful, Magnus learns the military intends to use the Metal Men as assassins and the group flee and take refuge in his apartment. When the entity [[Chemo (comics)|Chemo]] is created (on account of a prototype responsometer created by Magnus being thrown into a vat of chemicals by a thief), the Metal Men fought Chemo to protect Will Magnus and the local population, and while successful are thought destroyed<ref>''Justice League'' vol. 2 #28 (April 2014)</ref> before eventuslly reappearing.<ref>''Swamp Thing'' vol. 5 #36(Nov. 2014)</ref>
