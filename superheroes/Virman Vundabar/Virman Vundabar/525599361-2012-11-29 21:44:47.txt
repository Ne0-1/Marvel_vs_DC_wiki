A resident of [[Apokolips]], Virman is a minion of [[Granny Goodness]], having grown up in her orphanages like many of Darkseid's soldiers.

N.B. The name "Vundabar" is a corruption of the German word "wunderbar", which means "wonderful". This name was given to him by [[Granny Goodness]], and while the spelling of his name has varied over the years between ''Vundabar'' and ''Vunderbarr'', in his first appearance it was spelled "Vundabar".
