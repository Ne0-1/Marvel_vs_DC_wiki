==Fictional character biography==
A resident of [[Apokolips]], Virman is a minion of [[Granny Goodness]], having grown up in her orphanages like many of Darkseid's soldiers. He models his personality and schemes on [[Prussia]]n military appearance and precision partly because of the Earth-based name assigned to him by Granny. Like many of his associates, he is a nemesis of [[Mister Miracle]]. Virman has involved himself with many schemes to gain power, often involving many of Darkseid's lieutenants, such as [[Doctor Bedlam]], [[Steppenwolf (comics)|Steppenwolf]] and [[Kanto (comics)|Kanto]].

Specifically, in ''Underworld Unleashed: Apokolips - Dark Uprising'' #1 (1995), while Darkseid is missing at the [[Source Wall]], Vundabar allies himself with [[Granny Goodness]] against the other members of Darkseid's inner circle. 

Darkseid returns from the Source Wall, but he is not in full control of his mind. Virman attempts to take advantage of this but Darkseid recovers enough to obliterate him with his Omega Beams. However, Darkseid resurrects him in ''[[Death of the New Gods]] #1'' (October 2007), and he is again seemingly loyal to Darkseid despite the skepticism of Granny Goodness. 

In the pages of [[Terror Titans]], Vundabar appears as a member of the Board. He is killed by [[Clock King]].

His niece, [[Malice Vundabar|Malice]], has joined the [[Female Furies]]. She can control a shadow monster named [[Chessure]].

==Powers and abilities==
Virmin Vunderbarr has no super human powers but he is a skilled military tactican and hand-to-hand combatant. 

==Other versions==
* In the [[Elseworlds]] story ''Superman: The Dark Side'', Virman is depicted as a double of [[Adolf Hitler]].

* In [[Mark Waid]] and [[Alex Ross]] work [[Kingdom Come (comic)|Kingdom Come]], an elderly Vundabar can be seen in the bar, which Superman crashes.

==Other Media==
Vundabar has appeared in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "The Ties That Bind" voiced by [[Arte Johnson]] who uttered a variation on his signature "Very interesting... but stupid" [[catch phrase]] from ''[[Laugh-in]]''. In that episode, he was in control of [[Apokolips]] when [[Darkseid]] disappeared and held [[Kalibak]] as a prisoner. He also makes a [[cameo appearance]] in the ''Justice League Unlimited'' episode "Alive", where he tried to take over Apokolips from [[Granny Goodness]] and the [[Female Furies]].

N.B. The name "Vundabar" is a corruption of the German word "wunderbar", which means "wonderful". This name was given to him by [[Granny Goodness]], and while the spelling of his name has varied over the years between ''Vundabar'' and ''Vunderbarr'', in his first appearance it was spelled "Vundabar".
