'''Baron Bedlam''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] in the [[DC Universe]]. The character first appeared in ''Batman and the Outsiders'' #1 (August 1983).

==Fictional character biography==
Baron Bedlam is really '''Baron Frederick DeLamb''' ("Bedlam" is an anagram of his last name).  DeLamb's father is installed as a puppet ruler of [[Markovia]] by the [[Nazism|Nazis]] during [[World War II]]. It was during this time that Bedlam made advances to a young woman. She became very distressed over this and smashes a bottle into his face. Bedlam gains a prominent scar, and the women is executed. At the end of the war, American forces help the Markov family reclaim the throne. Frederick flees, but his father is hung by a mob.

Years later, Frederick DeLamb, taking the name Baron Bedlam, gains the support of the Soviet army and the mysterious political manipulator the [[Bad Samaritan]]. Bedlam murders King Viktor and seizes the throne. Soviet and Markovian forces battle, leading to deaths on both sides.

The crown prince, Brion Markov, with the aide of the scientist Dr. Jace, gains superpowers for the express purpose of stopping this invasion. With the aid of other superheroes, a grouping under [[Batman]]'s leadership that would soon call themselves the Outsiders, they infiltrate the country. The group gains intelligence on the invasion via the capture of a Soviet pilot.

Soon after, the Outsiders confront another aspect of Bedlam's forces, the super-powered [[Masters of Disaster]]. The two groups engange in a prolonged battle. The Bad Samaritan also discovers Bedlam's plan to clone [[Adolf Hitler]]. Bedlam was not pleased at this and attacks his ally. The clone project ultimately ends in failure. The new Hitler ends up being greatly distressed at what his 'father' has done and has no wish to continue the madness.

Geo-Force apparently kills Bedlam by dropping him into a raging mob. Bedlam survives this and has returned many times to face the team.

At one point, in the ''Outsiders'' 1987 Special, his identity is usurped by the [[Psycho Pirate]].

The name Baron Bedlam has recently been taken by another DC supervillain, formerly known as [[Doctor Bedlam]].
