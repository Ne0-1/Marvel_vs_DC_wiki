'''Baron Bedlam''' is the name of a [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]]. His real name is '''Frederick DeLamb''' ("Bedlam" is an anagram of his last name).

DeLamb's father was installed as a puppet ruler of [[Markovia]] by the [[Nazism|Nazis]] during [[World War II]]. (It was during this time that Bedlam made advances to a young woman, who smashed a bottle on his face in a fit about his behaviour and was executed for the deed. This incident gave him a prominent scar on his face.) When the Markov family reclaimed the throne, Frederick fled, but his father was hanged. 

Years later, Frederick DeLamb, taking the name Baron Bedlam, murdered King Viktor, and seized the throne. He was defeated by the crown prince, Brion Markov, who became [[Geo-Force]] specifically to battle this threat to his country. Brion was aided by other heroes, leading to the creation of the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]].

The name Baron Bedlam has recently been taken by another DC supervillain, formerly known as [[Doctor Bedlam]].
