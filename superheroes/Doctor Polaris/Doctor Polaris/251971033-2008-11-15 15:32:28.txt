'''Doctor Polaris''' is an alias used by two [[fictional]] [[supervillain]]s, [[comic book]] characters published by [[DC Comics]]. Neil Emerson first appeared as Doctor Polaris in ''[[Green Lantern]]'' #21 (June 1962), and was created by [[John Broome]] and [[Gil Kane]]. John Nichol first attributed appearance as the new Doctor Polaris occurs in ''[[Blue Beetle]]'' vol. 2 #31, (November 2008), and was created by [[Matthew Sturges]] and Andre Coelho.

==Publication history==
John Nichol the second Doctor Polaris makes his first chronological appearance (offpanel) in ''[[Justice League of America]]'' #11 (September 2007) by [[Brad Meltzer]] and [[Gene Ha]]. But his first in universe appearance occurs in ''[[Blue Beetle]]'' vol. 2 #31, (November 2008).

== Fictional character biography ==
===Neal Emerson===
'''Neal Emerson''' and his brother John were raised by an [[child abuse|abusive]] father (although a later flashback shows him raised by an abusive aunt).  This apparently drove Neal Emerson within himself and led to the creation of the personification of his own dark side.<ref name="dc-ency"/>  Emerson left the United States for a year and returned to find he was an uncle.  His brother John and sister-in-law Katherine had adopted a baby and named him [[Damage (comics)|Grant]].  Emerson was not around much for his nephew over the years, but he was quite fond of the boy.

As a medical student, Neal Emerson develops a [[fanaticism|fanatical]] interest in [[magnets]], despite the teasings of his classmates.  Emerson is convinced exposure to [[magnetic fields]] will give him more energy.   He later holds crowd-drawing lectures on "Health via Magnetism."  Due to his medical background and belief in [[magnetism]], Emerson adopts the name "Doctor Polaris." He even designs a special costume and mask to wear for his public appearances.<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation | last = Jimenez | first = Phil | author-link = Phil Jimenez | contribution = Doctor Occult | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 105  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = New York  | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>   

====Green Lantern====
{{main|Hal Jordan}}
After time Emerson came to believe he had absorbed too much magnetic energy, and unsuccessfully tries to drain off the excess energy.  In desperation, Emerson tries to make a public appeal at a charity event to [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]], believing Green Lantern's [[power ring (weapon)|power ring]] can help him.  Unfortunately, putting on the costume causes the evil persona of Doctor Polaris to take over Emerson, and he robs the box office of the proceeds instead.<ref name="dc-ency"/>  Polaris tries to draw a magnetic gun on Green Lantern, but is knocked unconscious by the Latern instead.  At the hospital, Green Lantern probes Polaris' mind, and learns of Emerson's evil side.  Shortly thereafter, Polaris recovers and attacks Green Lantern from hiding with girders and other metal objects.  The Green Lantern manages to draw Polaris out into the open and defeat him.  Doctor Polaris is remanded to police custody; during that time, his "good self" resurfaces.

Doctor Polaris apparently returns to battle Green Lantern and the [[Justice League]] alongside [[Killer Moth]], [[Dagon]], [[The Mask (DC Comics)|the Mask]] and [[Pied Piper (comics)|the Pied Piper]], but it is later revealed the demons [[Demons Three|Abnegazar, Rath and Ghast]] had created magical duplicates of the villains.  The League even has to battle the villains' costumes before ultimately defeating the demons three.

Doctor Polaris was later released from imprisonment during one of his "good" periods.  He attempted to discover the source of Green Lantern's power by kidnapping his friend, [[Tom Kalmaku]]. Polaris learned Green Lantern's power battery was hidden at Ferris Aircraft and was able to put a magnetic barrier around it, which prevented Green Lantern from fully charging his ring. The hero tracked Kalmaku to Polaris' lair as his power ring ran out of energy. Polaris turned his weapon on the Green Lantern, apparently killing him.  The emerald gladiator's body disappeared.

What Doctor Polaris did not know was that Green Lantern was taken to [[Oa]], home of the [[Guardians of the Universe]], the masters of the [[Green Lantern Corps]].  Due to the magnetic effect of Polaris' weapon, they believed Jordan was dead.  To complicate matters further, Jordan was taken into the 58th Century where he battled a threat to the Earth in the fictional identity of [[Pol Manning]], space explorer.  Returning to the 20th Century, Green Lantern defeated a surprised Doctor Polaris.  After reviving him, Jordan revealed to Kalmaku the "good" nature of Neal Emerson had lessened the effect of Doctor Polaris' weapon, thereby saving the ring wielder.

A reformed Emerson travelled to the Earth's magnetic [[North pole]] to study it.  Emerson was at the point where the lines of magnetic force converge when an earthquake plunged him into a deep crevice.  At the bottom of the crevice lay a glowing blue blob.  The radiation from the blob altered Emerson's perceptions, allowing him to understand the blob's intentions to dehydrate the entire Earth. Though weak, Emerson was able to subconsciously influence Hal Jordan into becoming Green Lantern, but was unable to bring the Lantern to the North Pole.  In desperation, Emerson created a mental duplicate of his evil alter ego.  Doctor Polaris took advantage of the situation and attacked Green Lantern by blocking his power battery with a magnetic barrier.  Doctor Polaris flew into Earth's orbit in order to increase the solar radiation reaching the planet.  As he left the Earth's magnetic field, the barrier around the power ring faded, allowing Green Lantern to recover.  Green Lantern managed to use micrometeorites to form an iron mask around Polaris' head, blocking off his vision.  Back on Earth, Emerson was able to use [[telepathy]] to warn Green Lantern of the alien threat.  Once Green Lantern disintegrated the blob, the mental image of the evil Doctor Polaris faded away.

Years later, Emerson's dark side returns.  Returning to his old costume, Polaris takes the name of Baxter Timmons and moves to [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]' Suicide Slum, where he steals advanced technology from warehouses throughout the city.  Polaris integrates the new magnetic circuits into his costume, as part of an attempt to gain revenge on Green Lantern.  Polaris' plans are stopped through the efforts of the superhero [[Black Lightning]].  

====Neron====
{{main|Neron}}
Over the years, the Polaris and Emerson personalities fought for dominance, until Polaris was approached by the [[demon]] [[Neron]]. Polaris sold Neron Emerson's [[soul]] in exchange for greater power and being rid of the other, restraining side of his personality. Polaris was one of Neron's lieutenants before being betrayed by [[Lex Luthor]] and the Joker.

Polaris later attacks [[John Henry Irons|Steel]] in [[Washington D.C.]], seeking a weapon called the Annihilator that Steel had built. During the battle, Steel's grandmother attacks Polaris and is killed.  Polaris is driven away after the [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]] attacks him.  Parasite, afraid of absorbing Polaris's mind and not just his power, lets him go before killing him.  Polaris flees to Keystone City.

Some time after that, Polaris shows up at Poseidonis in an attempt to seize control of the city, prompting a battle against [[Aquaman]] and his allies.  At that same time, [[Maxima (comics)|Maxima]] is in the city trying to force Aquaman to marry her. Using her powerful mental abilities, Maxima compells Polaris into believing that his alternate personality has reemerged, forcing him into a nearly catatonic state.

Under unknown circumstances, the catatonic Polaris ends being held in [[Irak]], but he is rescued by [[Hatchet (comics)|Hatchet]], [[Heat Wave (comics)|Heat Wave]] and [[Sonar (comics)|Sonar]]. The trio planned to carry him in the ''Aurora Borealis'' to the magnetic North Pole for recharge, thinking that he would be thankful with them and would lead them. They fought [[Wally West|The Flash]], [[Connor Hawke|Green Arrow]] and [[Kyle Rayner|Green Lantern]]. When Polaris recovered, the Flash gave him a bit of his speed, which had the same effect as applying kinetic energy to a magnet; Doctor Polaris' body attracted the remains of the sunken Aurora Borealis, which contained him. (''Green Lantern #96'', ''Green Arrow #130'' and ''Flash #135'')

In 2001, Polaris emerges during the Joker's [[Last Laugh (comics)|Last Laugh]] crisis attempting to take control of the magnetic south pole itself, forcing a battle against the Justice League. At the end of ''Last Laugh'', the Slab metahuman prison is moved to [[Antarctica]], as Polaris now ''is'' the magnetic pole, and cannot be moved.

====Infinite Crisis ====
{{main|Infinite Crisis}}
Shortly before ''Infinite Crisis'', Dr Polaris appears in [[Metropolis (Superman)|Metropolis]], seeking [[Superman]]'s help in battling a more powerful and ruthless magnetism manipulator who calls herself '''Repulse'''. It eventually transpires that this is a new manifestation of his personality disorder; Polaris is hallucinating Repulse (who looks like the aunt who hated him), and performs her actions himself. Eventually, Superman forces him to accept she is not real.

After recovering from this breakdown, Polaris was recruited by [[Lex Luthor]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] in ''[[Villains United]]''. Dr. Polaris was one of the villains waiting to ambush the [[Freedom Fighters (comics)|Freedom Fighters]] in a warehouse south of Metropolis in the beginning of ''Infinite Crisis''.  As the [[Human Bomb]] watched his allies be beaten to death, especially when [[Phantom Lady]] was impaled by [[Deathstroke]], he became enraged.  After Dr. Polaris taunted the living bomb, he was blown into pieces by the Human Bomb's explosive rage.<ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #1</ref><ref name="dc-ency"/>

===John Nichol===
In ''[[Justice League of America]]'' #11, John Nichol as Doctor Polaris is mentioned, having fought League members [[Roy Harper (comics)|Red Arrow]] and [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]]. The battle occurred off-panel, but he appeared in a panel in Justice League of America #17. In ''Justice League of America'' #21, the new Doctor Polaris can be seen among the recruits of [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]]'s new Secret Society. 

====Blue Beetle====
{{main|Blue Beetle (Jaime Reyes)}}
In ''[[Blue Beetle]]'' vol. 2 #32, (December 2008) it is revealed that [[businessman]] and [[Intergang]] associate John Nichol, a follower of Neal Emerson's exploits, had become the second Doctor Polaris, he had taken over the role after the death of Neal Emerson.

==Powers and abilities==
*Both Doctor Polaris' are capable of manipulating and channelling magnetic fields. They can manipulate iron and iron-based alloys to his whim. They can explode most metal constructs, manipulate ferrous materials and also fly using their power.
*The Neal Emerson Doctor Polaris was shown to have lost his powers when exposed to extreme heat. Another one of Emerson's weaknessess was telepathy, due to his fragile psyche.
*The John Nichol Polaris has all of Emerson's abilities and more, such as the power to create a localised magnetic storm in a person's brain, killing them instantly.<ref>''Blue Beetle'' (vol. 2) #32</ref> Having no mental defects, Nichol is able to utilise his powers much more effectively then Emerson did.

In ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', Dr. Polaris (wearing his original costume and voiced by [[Michael Rosenbaum]]) is seen as a member of the new [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]] led by [[Gorilla Grodd]]. He and [[Key (comics)|the Key]] rescue Lex Luthor from the pursuing cops and brought him to Grodd. He, Lex Luthor, and Key raid the [[Blackhawk (comics)|Blackhawks]] old base and battle [[Hawkgirl]], [[Flash (comics)|Flash]], [[Fire (DC Comics)|Fire]] and a retired Blackhawk and are able to get away by putting the base on self-destruct which is aborted. Here, he is portrayed as one of the Legion's most powerful members. 

Dr. Polaris returns in the episode "The Great Brain Robbery", in which he attempts to wrest control of the organization from Lex Luthor.  Luthor reveals that when he augmented Polaris' powers, he installed failsafes that allow him override Polaris' powers.
