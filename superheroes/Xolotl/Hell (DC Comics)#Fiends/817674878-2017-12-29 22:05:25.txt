'''Hell''' (a.k.a. '''Gehenna''', '''Hades''', '''Hel''', '''Jahannam''', '''Sheol''' and '''Tartarus''') is a [[fictional]] [[Location (geography)|location]], an infernal Underworld utilized in titles published by [[DC Comics]]. It is the locational [[antithesis]] of the [[Silver City (comics)|Silver City]]. The DC Comics location known as Hell is based heavily on [[Hell|its]] depiction in [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic mythology]].  Aside from a brief appearance in ''[[DC Special Series]]'' #8 (1978) that was never referred to or even mentioned again, the DC Comics concept of Hell was first mentioned in ''The Saga of the [[Swamp Thing]]'' (vol. 2) #25-27 (June-August 1984), described by [[Alan Moore]] and was first seen in ''Swamp Thing Annual'' #2 (1985), both of which were written by Moore and depicted by [[Stephen R. Bissette| Stephen Bissette]] and [[John Totleben]].

The hierarchy of Hell, specifically the triumvirate of  [[Lucifer (DC Comics)|Lucifer]], [[Azazel (DC Comics)|Azazel]] and [[Beelzebub]], was first depicted in ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'' (vol. 2) #4 (April 1989) and was created by [[Neil Gaiman]] and [[Sam Kieth]]; in the story, Lucifer had been forced to accept the rule due to the disruption caused by the [[Great Evil Beast]]'s attack on Creation in the 14-part 
''American Gothic'' storyline in ''Swamp Thing'' (vol. 2) #37-50 (June 1985-July 1986). ''[[Hellblazer]]'' would add in the [[First of the Fallen]], who preceded Lucifer. In ''[[Who's Who in the DC Universe]]'' #11 (July 1991), the entry on "Hell's Hierarchy" included all the elements of Gaiman's version, plus [[John Constantine]]'s archfoe [[Nergal (DC Comics)|Nergal]], Agony and Ecstasy the Slave-Twins of the Inquisition, (from ''Hellblazer'' #12 (December 1988)), [[Astaroth in popular culture#Literature|Asteroth]], [[Abaddon|Abaddon the Destroyer]], [[Morax (DC Comics)|Morax]] and [[Superman]]'s demonic foe [[Blaze and Satanus|Blaze]], who, with her brother [[Blaze and Satanus|Satanus]], came to rule Hell in the eight-issue [[Limited series (comics)|miniseries]] ''[[Reign in Hell]]'' (September 2008-April 2009).

==Publication history==
Because of the multiplicity of imprints and acquisitions under the DC Comics umbrella, there have been many versions of "Satan" and "Hell".

At [[Quality Comics]] in 1942, the hero known as [[Midnight (DC Comics)|Midnight]] encountered the Devil and his domineering Wife after his untimely death.<ref>''Smash Comics'' #36 (October 1942)</ref> At [[Fawcett Comics]] in 1942, [[Ibis the Invincible]] confronted a demonic entity who inexplicably named itself "Satan".<ref>''Whiz Comics'' #27 (February 1942)</ref> From [[DC Comics]], the pages of ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #60 (January-February 1966) featured the first appearance of Azmodus and ''[[Justice League of America]]'' #49 (November 1966) introduced the demon Abaddon, who possesses a farmer named Hiram Spiezel. DC Comics' interpretation of [[Lucifer (DC Comics)|Lucifer]] debuted in a dream sequence in ''[[Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen]]'' #65 (December 1962). Lucifer was introduced for real in ''[[DC Special Series]]'' #8 (1978), a.k.a. ''[[The Brave and the Bold]] Special'', which teamed up [[Batman]] I (Bruce Wayne), [[Sgt. Rock]] and [[Deadman]] and depicted Lucifer in Hell with an advisory board consisting of [[Guy Fawkes]], [[Benedict Arnold]], [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Jack the Ripper]], [[Nero]] and [[Bluebeard]] and controlling a human operative named Edward Dirkes. Jason Blood has a nightmare of Hell in [[Jack Kirby]]'s ''The Demon'' #14 (November 1973), but otherwise, the concept is in absentia other than through [[Retroactive continuity|retcon]]. Etrigan the Demon debuted in the first issue of the 16-issue series ''The Demon'' (August-September 1972-January 1974), but Hell was never actually mentioned in a concrete manner in any of the original ''Demon'' stories until ''The Saga of the Swamp Thing'' (vol. 2) #25-27 (June-August 1984), in which [[Alan Moore]] made the first canonical claim for Etrigan being a denizen of Hell, referring to his promotion to a Rhyming Demon and having him speak consistently in rhyme, which he did not do at all during the Kirby series.  Many stories in DC's various mystery titles featured "Satan" and at least one, in ''[[Weird Mystery Tales]]'' #4 (January-February 1973), featured Lucifer, but these stories may or may not be in mainstream continuity.  Satan did appear, along with an angelic pre-Fall Etrigan, in one of the four possible origins of the [[Phantom Stranger]] (three of which are Judeo-Christian inspired, a fourth, science fiction inspired)  in ''[[Secret Origins]]'' (vol. 2) #10 (January 1987).

Aside from ''DC Special Series'' #8, which was ignored in subsequent continuity, Hell made its actual first appearance in ''Swamp Thing Annual'' #2.  Subsequently it would appear in ''Swamp Thing'' (vol. 2) #49-50 (June-July 1986), in which there is a war going on in Hell and Etrigan is there. The [[Spectre (character)|Spectre]]'s failure in his intervention in this conflict leads to a reduction of his power as described in ''The Spectre'' (vol. 2) #1 (April 1987).  While Hell appeared in the 31 issues (and one ''Annual'') of that series (April 1987-November 1989), readers never saw any major developments outside of characters being condemned to go there and the occasional demon tormenting them, such as in ''The Spectre'' (vol. 2) #21 (December 1988).  Hell also appeared in the 31 issues (and one ''Annual'') of ''[[Blue Devil]]'' (June 1984-December 1986).  In ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'' (vol. 2) #4 (April 1989), we are introduced to the rulers of Hell, a triumvirate consisting of Lucifer, a fallen angel drawn to resemble [[David Bowie]]; Beelzebub, a large fly and Azazel, a shadowy, many-eyed creature (Azazel had previously appeared as an [[incubus]] in the [[Madame Xanadu]] story that was first published in ''[[Cancelled Comic Cavalcade]]'' #1 (summer 1978) and then was officially published in ''[[The Unexpected]]'' #190 (March-April 1978)). This triumvirate (albeit with Beelzebub referred to as Belial) returned in ''[[Secret Origins]]'' (vol. 2) #48 (April 1990), presenting the never-before-told origin of [[Stanley and His Monster]], in which the triumvirate expels a monster from Hell to Earth for being too nice, where he is discovered by Stanley Dover, who names him Spot.  This version of Hell also appeared in the 58 issues (plus two ''Annual''s and one #0 issue) of ''The Demon'' (vol. 3) (July 1980-May 1995) and the four-issue miniseries ''[[The Books of Magic]]'' (December 1990-March 1991), as well as the three-issue miniseries ''[[Kid Eternity#Modern incarnation|Kid Eternity]]'' (May-October 1991) by [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Duncan Fegredo]].

In ''Swamp Thing Annual'' #2, Hell was said to be a place that beings went to only because they '''believed''' that they belonged there. During the fourth ''Sandman'' story arc, ''[[The Sandman: Season of Mists|Season of Mists]]'', in ''The Sandman'' (vol. 2) #21-28 (January-July 1991), Lucifer decides to abandon Hell and forces all of these beings to leave.  He closes the gates of Hell behind him and gives the key to [[Dream (comics)|Dream]] of the [[Endless (comics)|Endless]], who does not want it, and many divine beings, such as [[List of The Sandman characters#Odin|Odin]], [[List of The Sandman characters#Bast|Bast]] and Shivering Jemmy, a [[Lords of Chaos and Order|Lord of Chaos]], attempt to persuade him to give the key to them.  Odin attempts to bribe Dream with the Twilight Dimension of [[Ragnarok]] from ''Last Days of the [[Justice Society of America]] Special'' (1986), specifically because it contains his successor's grandfather, [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Hawkman]] I (Carter Hall) and his protégé, [[Sandman (Wesley Dodds)|Sandman]] (Wesley Dodds),<ref>''The Sandman'' (vol. 2) #26 (May 1991)</ref> but this attempt fails.  Eventually, Dream gives the key to the angels [[List of The Sandman characters#Remiel|Remiel]] and [[Duma (DC Comics)|Duma]], who, denied re-entry into the Silver City, reinstate Hell as a place of spiritual rehabilitation rather than eternal punishment.  This version of Hell is also depicted in the four-issue miniseries ''Stanley and His Monster'' (vol. 2) (February-May 1993), ''Vertigo Visions: Phantom Stranger'' #1 (October 1993), a [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] issue under the Vertigo imprint by [[Alisa Kwitney]] and [[Guy Davis (comics)|Guy Davis]], the 16-issue series ''[[Kid Eternity#Modern incarnation|Kid Eternity]]'' (May 1993-September 1994) by [[Ann Nocenti]] and [[Sean Phillips]], also under the Vertigo imprint (albeit with Beelzebub having taken human form) and ''[[Batman]]'' #544-546 (July-September 1997), which guest-starred Etrigan.

''[[Hellblazer]]'' under [[Garth Ennis]] would have its own Satan and to avoid clashes with ''The Sandman'' (vol. 2), this version was turned in ''Hellblazer'' #59 (November 1992) into the [[First of the Fallen]]: the first being in Hell, preceding Lucifer and the failed revolt in Heaven. The First and two other demons ruled Hell once Lucifer had quit, with the two demons said to be only barely in charge, and in a [[fourth wall]] moment the First complained about "those endless, ''bloody'' triumvirates". [[John Constantine]], to save himself, set up the First to be taken out and the succubus Chantinelle took control, but the First retook power shortly afterward.

The Master Baytor was nominally the ruler of Hell for a brief period, but spent the whole time babbling incoherently (''Hitman'' #17 (August 1997)).

In ''The Sandman Presents: Lucifer'' #1-3 (March-May 1999) and the 75-issue series ''Lucifer'' (June 2000-August 2006; including a one-shot issue called ''Lucifer: Nirvana'' (2002)), a human is eventually placed in charge of Hell while the title character roams Earth and owns a piano bar as depicted in the ninth ''Sandman'' story arc, ''[[The Sandman: The Kindly Ones|The Kindly Ones]]'', in ''Vertigo Jam'' #1 (August 1993) and ''The Sandman'' (vol. 2) #57-69 (February 1994-July 1995).

The six-issue miniseries ''[[Human Defense Corps]]'' (July-December 2003) detailed the US military designation for demonic entities as "Hostile Species NHH-014". The Human Defense Corps were able to defeat a minor Lord of the Damned named Scarmaglione, then Sergeant Montgomery Kelly assumed his powers and claimed his clan and seat for the [[United States|United States of America]]. His status as a minor ruler was confirmed by Neron, whose title was at that time the First Seated of the Entire Infernal Dominion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dcuguide.com/HDC/HDC_004.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120729041142/http://www.dcuguide.com/HDC/HDC_004.php |archivedate=2012-07-29 |df= }}</ref><ref name="Human Defense Corps' 2003"/><ref name="dcuguide.com"/>

[[Superman]] briefly became Lord of Hell in ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' #666 (October 2007).

The eight-issue miniseries ''Reign in Hell'' (September 2008-April 2009) created by [[Keith Giffen]] and [[Tom Derenick]]<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/080620-ReigninHell.html "Better to Reign in Hell - Keith Giffen Talks"], ''[[Newsarama]]'', June 20, 2008.</ref><ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=17281 "Keith Giffen Reigns In Hell!"], ''[[Comic Book Resources]]'', July 17, 2008.</ref> introduced a new status quo for the DC Comics version of Hell; it also gave readers specific geographical references and defined a codex of rules that governed the damned. Two years after ''Reign in Hell'', DC decided to remove all DC Universe characters from the Vertigo imprint, though Vertigo would have its own version of John Constantine.<ref>http://www.bleedingcool.com/2010/07/23/karen-berger-confirms-dc-characters-to-leave-vertigo/</ref>

==Description==
{{see also|Blaze and Satanus}}
In the [[DC Universe]], Hell is an alternate plane of reality, traditionally accessible only by those of demonic heritage, beings of a higher order and those whose [[soul]]s have been barred from entering the Silver City. DC Comics' Hell is a debased reflection of Earth, so as Earth became more technologically or socially advanced so did Hell, due to an effect not unlike [[time dilation]]: "[a] day in Hell is equal to a minute's passage on Earth". All denizens of DC Comics' version of Hell are all capable of using some form of [[Maleficium (sorcery)|maleficium]]; the most powerful infernal magic users are the ruling gentry of Hell and their enforcers the Necro-Mages, Forges, Exegesis Guild, Renderers, Howlers, Incendiaries and Rhyming Demons. Every building, piece of furniture, weapon, piece of armor, article of clothing, serving of food, etc. in Hell is made from the bodies of the damned. The damned are put through a process called rendering by the Exegesis Guild and their servants the Renderers in order to manufacture the raw materials of Hell.<ref name="Hell' 2008">''Reign in Hell'' #1 (August 2008)</ref>

==Fictional history==
During ''[[The Final Night]]'' storyline, the Rhyming Demon known as Etrigan offered to bring all of the living people of Earth into Hell so that they could stay warm in exchange for their souls; the people rejected him, primarily because his plan was to shift Earth into Hell.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dcuguide.com/FN/FN_003.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120905081217/http://www.dcuguide.com/FN/FN_003.php |archivedate=2012-09-05 |df= }}</ref> During the ''[[Day of Judgment (comics)|Day of Judgment]]'' storyline, a fallen King-Angel named [[Asmodel]], with the help of Etrigan (who was trying to cause chaos on Earth and defeat his rival Neron), took control of the Spectre and sought to destroy both Heaven and Hell. He used the Spectre's powers to extinguish the hellfire font, causing Hell to freeze over. A team of heroes including [[Superman]], [[Zatanna]], [[Sebastian Faust]], [[Firestorm (comics)#Fire Elemental|Firestorm]], [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]], [[Enchantress (DC Comics)|Enchantress]] and [[Deadman]] were sent deep into Hell in order to reignite the hellfire font. The reignition required an act of true evil, so Sebastian Faust took matters into his own hands and slit Enchantress' throat, thereby damning himself and thus satisfying the infernal conditions. The storyline ends with a three-way battle between Neron, Asmodel and the then-deceased [[Hal Jordan]] for control over the Spectre-Force (which ultimately chooses Hal Jordan, thus making him the Spectre's new host for a time).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dcuguide.com/DoJ/DoJ.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120903163136/http://www.dcuguide.com/DoJ/DoJ.php |archivedate=2012-09-03 |df= }}</ref>

===''Reign in Hell''===
{{main|Reign in Hell}}
During the ''Reign in Hell'' storyline, the Underworld is thrown into a massive conflict as Neron and his generals are confronted with a rebellion led by Blaze and Satanus, the rulers of Purgatory. Neron soon discovered that the rebel demons were offering the damned hope and that this was a powerful spur. Recognizing what would happen if the damned rose up against him, Neron has his consort Lilith, the "mother of all earthborn fiends", summon all [[vampire]]s,  [[werewolf|werewolves]], [[ghoul]]s and infernally powered humans to Hell.

[[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]], who is confined to the Labyrinth, Hell's prison, is freed as a result of the titanic battle between Etrigan and Blue Devil, a battle which results in Etrigan's temporary death at Blue Devil's hands.<ref name="Hell' 2009">''Reign in Hell'' #1-8 (September 2008-April 2009)</ref> Lobo tears apart the soul of [[Zatara]] ([[Zatanna]]'s father) which forces Zatanna to destroy his soul rather than consign him to an eternity of pain and torment. Zatara is later shown to have been saved by a demon who owes him a favor in the 16-issue series ''Zatanna'' (vol. 2) (July 2010-October 2011).

Satanus reveals that he used the war to spread a modified viral version of [[List of comic book drugs#DMN|DMN]], the anagogic drug that he had once used to destabilize [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] and confound [[Superman]]. This version of DMN is airborne and when combined with the magic word '' '[[Shazam (wizard)|Shazam]]' ''  it transforms Neron and all of Hell's demons into soulless humans, all except Lilith who was not a true demon. Satanus then beheads Neron and takes over as Hell's ruler.<ref>''Reign in Hell'' #7 (March 2009)</ref> The damned turn their rage upon the now human and powerless demons and imps, slaughtering them wholesale and damning themselves anew.

Blaze later takes advantage of her brother's momentary weakness during a moment when he allows [[Black Alice (comics)|Black Alice]] to touch him and sample his powers; this action shatters Alice's psyche and allows Blaze to drain Satanus' power and take the throne for herself.<ref name>''Reign in Hell'' #8 (April 2009)</ref> Near the end of the miniseries the ''Unspoken Principium'' of Hell is revealed by [[Doctor Occult]] to be "You can leave whenever you want",<ref>''Reign in Hell'' #6 (February 2009)</ref>reiterating what was said about Hell in the Gaiman version.

==Geography==
In the ''Reign in Hell'' miniseries, the '''Infernal Dominion''' is divided up into nine Provinces, each of which have their own rulers. All of the rulers of the Provinces bowed down to Neron, then to Satanus when he took the throne and then to Blaze when she did the same thing. The Nine Provinces included Pandemonia, the Odium, the Gull, Praetori, Internecia, Ament, the Labyrinth, Err and Purgatory (Below see descriptions of the Nine Provinces of the Infernal Dominion as depicted in the miniseries).<ref name="Hell' 2009"/>

*'''Pandemonia''' -  The First Province, home of Hell's high-caste demons and of Hell's throne, the seat of the Dominus or Domina.
*'''The Odium''' - The Second Province, the [[Industry|industrial]] and [[manufacturing]] center. Home of the rendering factories and the Renderers.

*'''Err''' - The Eighth Province, the [[Religious intolerance|theological suppression]] ministry.
*'''Purgatory''' - The Ninth Province, the place of secondary [[damnation]]; it was formerly ruled by Blaze and Satanus. Anyone can leave Purgatory and enter Hell, but they can never return.
*'''The Selvage''' - The [[Selvage]] is the infernal [[Aether (classical element)|aether]], a dimensional waste which separates and surrounds the Provinces; all passage between Provinces must pass through the Selvage. The very nature of the Selvage rejects magic.
*'''Masak Mavdil''' - The pit of rejected failures where demons exile their own kind and which is guarded by the demon Abaddon.

==Infernal Hosts==
According to the ''Reign in Hell'' miniseries, Blaze, the sister of Satanus, is the current ruler of Hell; she succeeded her brother who in turn succeeded Neron. The mainstream DC Comics Hell always has a single ruler known as the "First Seated of the Entire Infernal Dominion" and holding the title of [[Dominus (title)|Dominus]] (male) or [[Dominus (title)|Domina]] (female); the first such Dominus was Neron, the current Domina is Blaze, sister of Satanus and daughter of the wizard [[Shazam (wizard)|Shazam]].

It is then assumed that these demon princes ultimately answer to the crowned head of Hell. The demoness [[Belyllioth]] is Princess of one-thirteenth of Hell's realms in these stories. She supposedly replaced the previous ruler Dalkriig-Hath once he was destroyed by his bride [[Artemis of Bana-Mighdall#Requiem|Artemis of Bana-Mighdall]]. Artemis was by right next in line to rule her former husband's realm, but instead had the other twelve Princes of Hell grant Belyllioth her station instead.<ref>According to ''Artemis: Requiem'' #1-6 (June-November 1996) and ''Wonder Woman Annual'' #6 (second story) (1997)</ref> Notable in this depiction were the [[Myrmidons]], a race of savage ant-like demons faithful to Belyllioth.<ref>''Artemis: Requiem'' #1 (June 1996)</ref>

==Vertigo==

===Description===
{{see also|Lucifer (DC Comics)}}
The [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] imprint of DC Comics also has its own version of Hell, with its own very specific infernal sovereignty formerly ruled by [[Lucifer (DC Comics)|Lucifer Samael Morningstar]].

===Fictional history===
Contrary to popular belief, the term '''Satan''' represents a title within the legions of Hell and is not a name. The most well-known Satan is Lucifer Samael Morningstar whose rule supplanted that of the [[First of the Fallen]] and the First Triumvirate. Lucifer was the fourth fallen angel and not the first ruler of Hell, though he later became the supreme ruler of Hell for many centuries. When the Great Evil Beast threatened all existence, a civil war erupted in Hell and the regency was split into the Second Triumvirate. Eventually, Lucifer grew bored with his position and retired to Earth with his mistress, the Lilim known as [[Mazikeen (comics)|Mazikeen]].

===Geography===
The realms of Vertigo's Hell are not as defined as the ones in the mainstream DC Universe after the ''Reign in Hell'' miniseries, but specific areas have been mentioned in various books.

*'''[[Dis (Divine Comedy)|Dis]]''' - A Hellcity, home to the palace of Lucifer Morningstar.<ref name="TheSandman' 1989">''The Sandman'' (vol. 2) #4 (April 1989)</ref>
*'''Effrul''' - The home Province of Arux, an Arch-Duke of Hell.<ref>First seen in ''Lucifer'' #15 (August 2001)</ref>
*'''Mashkan-Shapir''' - The home city of Nergal, an Arch-Duke of Hell.<ref>http://www.dcuguide.com/who.php?name=nergal</ref>

===Infernal sovereignty===
The hierarchy of Vertigo's Hell has changed several times over the centuries, the leader of which has always assumed the title of '''Satan'''.  Eventually, Lucifer abandons Hell, forces every being within it out of it, closes its gates behind him and gives its key to [[Dream (comics)|Dream]] of the [[Endless (comics)|Endless]], who eventually gives it to two angels, [[List of The Sandman characters#Remiel|Remiel]] and [[Duma (DC Comics)|Duma]], who then transform Hell into a place of spiritual rehabilitation rather than eternal punishment. In the interim, Lucifer was shown as ruler of Hell in the DC Universe series ''[[Etrigan the Demon|The Demon]]'' (vol. 3) and ''[[Spectre (character)|The Spectre]]'' (vol. 2) and the miniseries ''[[Stanley and His Monster]]'' (vol. 2).
