'''Hell''', (also '''Gehenna''', '''Hades''', '''Hel''', '''Jahannam''', '''Sheol''', '''Tartarus''') is a [[fictional]] [[location]], an infernal underworld utilized in titles published by [[DC Comics]]. It is the locational [[antithesis]] of the [[Silver City (comics)|Silver City]]. The DC Comics location known as Hell is based heavily on its depiction in Judeo-Christian mythology. The DC Comics version of Hell debuted in ''[[Etrigan the Demon|The Demon]]'' #1, (August [[1972 in comics|1972]]) and was created by [[Jack Kirby]]. The [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo Comics]] version of Hell debuted in ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'' #4 (April 1989), and was created by [[Neil Gaiman]] and [[Sam Kieth]].

==Publication history==
Because of the multiplicity of imprints and acquisitions under the DC Comics umbrella, there have been many versions of "Satan" and "Hell".

At [[Quality Comics]] in 1942, the hero known as [[Midnight (DC Comics)|Midnight]] encountered the Devil and his domineering Wife after his untimely death.<ref>As seen in ''Smash Comics'' #36 (October 1942)</ref><ref>http://www.dcuguide.com/who.php?name=devilandhiswife</ref> At [[Fawcett Comics]] in 1942, [[Ibis the Invincible]] confronted a demonic entity who inexplicably named itself "Satan".<ref>As seen in Whiz Comics #27 (February 1942)</ref> From [[DC Comics]], The pages of ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #60 (January 1966) featured the first appearance of Azmodus. And ''[[Justice League of America]]'' #49 (November 1966) introduced the demon Abaddon, who possesses a farmer named Hiram Spiezel. And finally in the pages of the ''[[The Demon]]'' #1, (September 1972) Jack Kirby introduced us to the earliest in continuity fictional depictions of the [[Silver City (comics)|Silver City]], [[Presence (DC Comics)|The Presence]], [[Lucifer]] and [[Hell]].

The [[Human Defense Corps]] mini-series in 2003 detailed the US Military designation for Demonic entities as "Hostile Species NHH-014". The Human Defense Corps were able to defeat a minor Lord of the Damned named Scarmaglione, and Sergeant Montgomery Kelly assumed his powers and claimed his clan and seat for the [[United States of America]], his status as minor ruler was confirmed by Neron, who was then the First Seated of Hell.<ref>http://www.dcuguide.com/HDC/HDC_004.php</ref><ref>As seen in ''Human Defense Corps'' #4 (October 2003)</ref><ref>http://www.dcuguide.com/HDC/HDC_006.php</ref>

At one point DC Comics and its [[Vertigo Comics]] imprint shared the same version of Hell, but after an editorially mandated separation, the two realms began to diverge, this divergence saw its culmination in the 2008-2009 limited series ''Reign in Hell'' created by [[Keith Giffen]] and Tom Derenick.<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/080620-ReigninHell.html "Better to Reign in Hell - Keith Giffen Talks"], [[Newsarama]], June 20, 2008.</ref><ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=17281 "Keith Giffen Reigns In Hell!"], [[Comic Book Resources]], July 17, 2008.</ref> Reign in Hell introduced a new status quo for the DC Comics version of Hell, it also gave readers specific geographical references, and defined a codex of rules that govern the damned.

==DC Comics==
===Description===
{{see also|Blaze and Satanus}}
In the DC Comics universe, Hell is an alternate plane of reality, traditionally accessible only by those of demonic heritage, beings of a higher order, and those whose [[soul]]s have been barred from entering the Silver City. The DC Comics Hell is a debased reflection of Earth, so as Earth became more technologically or socially advanced so does Hell. Due to [[time dilation]], "A day in Hell is equal to a minute's passage on Earth". All denizens of DC's Comics' infernal region known as Hell are all capable of using some form of [[Maleficium (sorcery)|maleficium]], the most powerful infernal magic users are the ruling gentry of Hell, and their enforcers the Necro-Mages, Forges, Renderers, Howlers, and Rhyming Demons. Every building, every piece of furniture, weapons, armor, clothing, food, etc in hell is made from the bodies of the damned. The damned are put through a process called rendering by the Exegis Guild, in order to manufacture the raw materials of Hell.<ref>As seen in ''Reign in Hell'' #1 (September 2008)</ref>

===Fictional history===
During the ''[[Final Night]]'' event, the Rhyming Demon known as Etrigan offered to bring all of the living people of Earth into Hell so they could stay warm.<ref>http://www.dcuguide.com/FN/FN_003.php</ref> During the "[[Day of Judgment (comics)|Day of Judgment]]" storyline, with the help of Etrigan a fallen angel named [[Asmodel]] took control of the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] and sought to destroy Heaven and Hell. He used the Spectre's powers to extinguish the hellfire font, causing Hell to freeze over. A team of heroes including [[Superman]], [[Zatanna]], [[Sebastian Faust|Faust]], [[Firestorm]], [[Atom (comics)|The Atom]], [[Enchantress (DC Comics)|Enchantress]] and [[Deadman]] were sent deep into Hell in order to reignite the hellfire font. The re-ignition required an act of true evil, so Sebastian Faust took matters into his own hands and slit the Enchantress' throat, thereby satisfying the infernal conditions. The story ends with a three way battle between Neron, Asmodel and Hal Jordan for control over the Spectre Force.<ref>http://www.dcuguide.com/DoJ/DoJ.php</ref>

====Reign in Hell====
{{cquote|"You can leave whenever you want."</br>Unspoken Principium}}
During the events of ''Reign in Hell'', the Underworld is thrown into a massive conflict as Neron and his generals are confronted with a rebellion led by Lord Satanus and Lady Blaze the rulers of Purgatory. Neron soon discovered that the rebel demons were offering the damned hope, and that this was a powerful spur. Recognizing what would happen if the damned rose up against him, Neron has his consort Lilith the "mother of all earthborn fiends" summon all [[vampire]]s, [[ghoul]]s, [[werewolf|werewolves]], and infernally powered humans to [[Hell]].

[[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]] who is confined to the Labyrinth, Hell's prison is freed as a result of the titanic battle between Etrigan the Demon and Blue Devil, a battle which results in Etrigan's temporary death at Blue Devil's hands.<ref>As seen in ''Reign in Hell'' #1-8 (September 2008 - April 2009)</ref>

Lord Satanus reveals that he used the war to spread a modified viral version of [[List of comic book drugs#DMN|DMN]], the anagogic drug he had once used to destabilize [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] and confound [[Superman]]. This version of DMN is airborne and when combined with the magical word "[[Shazam]]" it transforms Neron and all of Hell's demons into soulless humans, all except Lilith who was not a true Demon. Satanus then decapitates Neron and takes over as Hell's ruler.<ref>As seen in ''Reign in Hell'' #7 (March 2009)</ref> The Damned turn their rage upon the now human and powerless demons and imps, slaughtering them wholesale, and damning themselves anew.

Lady Blaze later takes advantage of her brother's momentary weakness during a moment when he allows [[Black Alice (comics)|Black Alice]] to touch him and sample his powers, this action shatters Alice's psyche and allows Lady Blaze to drain Lord Satanus' power and take the throne for herself. At the end of the series the ''Unspoken Principium'' of Hell is revealed by [[Doctor Occult]] "You can leave whenever you want." <ref>As seen in ''Reign in Hell'' #8 (April 2009)</ref>

==DC Comics: Geography==
In the ''Reign in Hell'' mini-series the '''Infernal Dominion''' is divided up into nine provinces, each of which have their own rulers. All rulers bowed to Neron.

Below see descriptions of the Nine Provinces of the Infernal Dominion as depicted in the Reign in Hell mini-series.

It is then assumed that these Demon Princes ultimately answer to the crown head of hell. The demoness [[Belyllioth]] is Princess of 1/13th of hell's realms in these stories. She supposedly replaced the previous ruler Dalkriig-Hath once he was destroyed by his bride Artemis. Artemis was by rights next in line to rule her former husband's realm, but instead had the other 12 Princes of hell grant Belyllioth her station instead.<ref>According to ''Artemis: Requiem'' #1-6 (June 1996) and ''Wonder Woman Annual'' (vol. 2) #6 (1997)</ref> Notable in this depiction were the [[Myrmidon]]s, a race of savage ant-like demons faithful to [[Belyllioth]].<ref>''Artemis: Requiem'' #1</ref>

==Vertigo Comics==
===Description===
{{see also|Lucifer (DC Comics)}}
The [[Vertigo Comics]] imprint also has its own version of Hell, with its own very specific infernal sovereignty formerly ruled by [[Lucifer (DC Comics)|Lucifer Morningstar]]. The Vertigo version of Hell is ruled by a Triumvirate who took over after Lucifer Morningstar abandoned Hell.

===Fictional history===
Contrary to popular belief, the term ''Satan'' represents a rank within the legions of Hell and is not a name. The most well-known Satan is Lucifer Morningstar whose rule supplanted that of the [[First of the Fallen]] and the First Triumvirate.<ref>http://www.dcuguide.com/who.php?name=triumvirateofhell</ref> Contrary to popular belief, Lucifer was the fourth fallen Angel and not the first ruler of Hell, though he later became the supreme ruler of Hell for many centuries. When the great Darkness of creation threatened all existence, a civil war erupted in Hell and the realm was split into a triumvirate. Eventually, Lucifer grew bored with his position and retired to Earth with his consort, the Lilim known as [[Mazikeen]].

==Vertigo Comics: Geography==
The regions of Vertigo Comics' Hell are not as defined as the mainstream universe after the ''Reign in Hell'' mini-series, but specific areas have been mentioned in various books.

*'''[[Dis (Divine Comedy)|Dis]]''' - a Hellcity, home to the palace of Lucifer Morningstar.<ref>As seen in Sandman vol 2 #4 (April 1989)</ref>
*'''Effrul''' - The home province of Lord Arux an Arch-Duke of Hell.
*'''Mashkan-Shapir''' - The home city of Arch-Duke Nergal.<ref>http://www.dcuguide.com/who.php?name=nergal</ref>

==Vertigo Comics: Infernal sovereignty==
The hierarchy of Vetigo Comics' Hell has changed several times over the centuries, the leader of which has always assumed the title of '''Satan'''.  Eventually, Lucifer abandons Hell, gives its key to [[Dream (comics)|Dream]], and eventually, two angels, [[Remiel]] and [[Duma (DC Comics)|Duma]] transform Hell into a place of rehabilitation.  In the interim, Lucifer was shown as ruler of Hell in the DC Universe titles ''[[Etrigan|The Demon]]'', ''[[The Spectre]]'', and ''[[Stanley and His Monster]]''.
