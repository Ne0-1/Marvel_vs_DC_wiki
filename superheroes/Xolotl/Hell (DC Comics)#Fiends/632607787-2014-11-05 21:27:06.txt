'''Hell''' (also '''Gehenna''', '''Hades''', '''Hel''', '''Jahannam''', '''Sheol''', '''Tartarus''') is a [[fictional]] [[Location (geography)|location]], an infernal underworld utilized in titles published by [[DC Comics]]. It is the locational [[antithesis]] of the [[Silver City (comics)|Silver City]]. The DC Comics location known as Hell is based heavily on [[Hell|its]] depiction in [[Abrahamic mythology]].  Aside from a brief appearance in ''[[DC Special Series]]'' #8 (1977) that was never referred to again, the DC Comics concept of Hell was first mentioned in ''[[Swamp Thing]]'' (vol. 2) #27 (July 1984), described by [[Alan Moore]], and was first seen in ''Swamp Thing'' Annual #2 (January 1985), written by Moore and depicted by [[Steve Bissette]] and [[John Totleben]].

The hierarchy of Hell, specifically the triumvirate of  ([[Lucifer (DC Comics)|Lucifer]], [[Beelzebub (DC Comics)|Beelzebub]], and [[Azazel (DC Comics)|Azazel]]), was first depicted in ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'' #4 (April 1989), and was created by [[Neil Gaiman]] and [[Sam Kieth]]; in the story, Lucifer had been forced to accept the rule due to the disruption caused by the Darkness' attack in ''Swamp Thing''. ''[[Hellblazer]]'' would add in the [[First of the Fallen]], who predates Lucifer. In ''[[Who's Who in the DC Universe]]'' #11 (July 1991), the entry on "Hell's Hierarchy" included all the elements of Gaiman's version, plus [[John Constantine]]'s archfoe [[Nergal]], [[Agony and Ecstasy]] (from ''[[Hellblazer]]'' #12), [[Asteroth]], [[Abaddon the Destroyer]], [[Morax (demon)|Morax]], and [[Superman]]'s demonic foe [[Blaze and Satanus|Blaze]], who, with Satanus, came to rule Hell in DC's 2008-2009 ''[[Reign in Hell]]'' [[limited series]].

==Publication history==
Because of the multiplicity of imprints and acquisitions under the DC Comics umbrella, there have been many versions of "Satan" and "Hell".

At [[Quality Comics]] in 1942, the hero known as [[Midnight (DC Comics)|Midnight]] encountered the Devil and his domineering Wife after his untimely death.<ref>''Smash Comics'' #36 (October 1942)</ref><ref>http://www.dcuguide.com/who.php?name=devilandhiswife</ref> At [[Fawcett Comics]] in 1942, [[Ibis the Invincible]] confronted a demonic entity who inexplicably named itself "Satan".<ref>Whiz Comics #27 (February 1942)</ref> From [[DC Comics]], the pages of ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #60 (January 1966) featured the first appearance of Azmodus and ''[[Justice League of America]]'' #49 (November 1966) introduced the demon Abaddon, who possesses a farmer named Hiram Spiezel. DC Comics' interpretation of [[Lucifer (DC Comics)|Lucifer]] debuted in a dream sequence in ''[[Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen]]'' #65 (December 1962), and eventually for real in ''[[DC Special Series]]'' #8 (1977).  The latter appearance depicted Lucifer in Hell with an advisory board consisting of [[Guy Fawkes]], [[Benedict Arnold]], [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Jack the Ripper]], [[Nero]], and [[Bluebeard]], and controlling a human operative named Edward Dirkes. Jason Blood has a nightmare of Hell in [[Jack Kirby]]'s ''[[Etrigan the Demon|The Demon]]'' (vol. 1) #14 (November 1973), but otherwise, the concept is in absentia other than through [[retcon]]. Etrigan the Demon debuted in the first issue of the series, but Hell was never actually mentioned in a concrete manner in ''Demon'' stories until ''[[Swamp Thing]]'' (vol. 2) #27, in which [[Alan Moore]] made the first canonical claim for Etrigan being a denizen of Hell, referring to his promotion to a Rhyming Demon, and having him speak consistently in rhyme, which he did not do during the Kirby series.  Many stories in DC's various mystery titles featured "Satan," and at least one, in ''[[Weird Mystery Tales]]'' #4, featured Lucifer, but those stories may or may not be in continuity.  Satan did appear, along with an angelic pre-fall Etrigan, in one of the four possible origins of [[The Phantom Stranger]] (three of which are Judeo-Christian inspired, a fourth, science fiction)  in ''[[Secret Origins]]'' (vol. 3) #10 (January 1987).

Aside from ''DC Special Series'' #8, which was ignored in subsequent continuity, Hell made its actual first appearance in ''[[Swamp Thing]]'' (vol. 2) Anunual #2.  Subsequently it would appear in issues #49-#50, in which there is a war going on in Hell, and Etrigan is there.  [[The Spectre]]'s failure in his intervention in this conflict leads to a reduction of his power as described in ''The Spectre'' (vol. 2) #1 (April 1987).  While Hell appeared in issues of that series, we never saw any major developments outside of characters being condemned to go there and the occasional demon tormenting them, such as in issue #21.  Hell subsequently appeared in issues of ''[[Blue Devil]]''.  In ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'' #4 (April 1989), we are introduced to the leaders of Hell, a trinity consisting of Lucifer, an angel drawn to resemble [[David Bowie]]; Beelzebub, a large fly, and Azazael, a shadowy, many-eyed creature (Azazel had previously appeared as an [[incubus]] in the [[Madame Xanadu]] story in ''[[Cancelled Comic Cavalcade]]'' #2 and ''[[The Unexpected]]'' #190 (March/April 1978)).  In April 1990, this trinity (albeit with Beelzebub referred to as Belial) appeared in ''[[Secret Origins]]'' #48, presenting the never-before-told origin of [[Stanley and His Monster]], in which the trinity expels a monster to Earth for being too nice, where he is discovered by Stanley Dover, who names him Spot.  This version of Hell continued to appear in issues of ''The Demon'' (vol. 3), and ''[[The Books of Magic]]''.

In the second Swamp Thing annual, Hell was said to be a place that beings went to only because they '''believed''' that they belonged there. During the fourth ''Sandman'' story arc, ''[[Season of Mists]]'', in issues 21-28 (January–July 1991), Lucifer decides to abandon Hell, and forces all of these beings to leave.  He gives the key to [[Dream (comics)|Dream]], who does not want it, and has many divine beings, such as [[Odin]], [[List of The Sandman characters#Bast|Bast]], and Shivering Jemmy, a [[Lords of Chaos and Order|Lord of Chaos]], attempt to persuade him to give the key to them.  Odin attempts to bribe Dream with the Twilight Dimension of [[Ragnarok]] from ''The Last Days of the [[Justice Society of America]] Special'', specifically because it contains his successor's grandfather, [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)]], and his protégé, [[Sandman (Wesley Dodds)]],<ref>''The Sandman'' (vol. 2) #26</ref> but this fails.  Eventually, Dream gives Hell to the angels [[Remiel (DC Comics)|Remiel]] and [[Duma (DC Comics)|Duma]], who, denied reentry into the [[Silver City (comics)|Silver City]], reinstate Hell as a place of spiritual rehabilitation rather than punishment.  This version of Hell is also depicted in the ''Stanley and His Monster'' 1993 [[limited series]], an October 1993 ''Phantom Stranger'' [[One-shot (comics)|one shot]] under the Vertigo imprint by [[Alisa Kwitney]] and [[Guy Davis (comics)|Guy Davis]], the 1993-1994 ''[[Kid Eternity]]'' series by [[Ann Nocenti]] and [[Sean Phillips]], also under the Vertigo imprint, albeit with Beelzebub having taken human form, and ''[[Batman]]'' #544 (July 1997), which guest-starred Etrigan.

''[[Hellblazer]]'' under [[Garth Ennis]] would have its own Satan, and to avoid clashes with ''Sandman'' this was turned in ''Hellblazer'' #59 into the [[First of the Fallen]]: the first being in Hell, predating Lucifer and the failed uprising in Heaven. The First and two other demons ruled Hell once Lucifer had quit, with the two angels said to be only nominally in charge, and in a [[fourth wall]] moment the First complained about "those endless, ''bloody'' triumverates". [[John Constantine]], to save himself, set up the First to be taken out and the succubus Chantinelle took control, but the First retook power shortly after.

The Master Baytor was nominally the ruler of Hell for a brief period, but spent the whole time rambling incoherently. (''Hitman'' #17)

In the ''Lucifer'' series, which ran from 1999–2006, a human is eventually placed in charge of Hell while the title character roams Earth and owns a piano bar as depicted in the ''Sandman'' story arc ''[[The Sandman: The Kindly Ones|The Kindly Ones]]'' (#57-69, February 1994-July 1995).

The ''[[Human Defense Corps]]'' mini-series in 2003 detailed the US Military designation for Demonic entities as "Hostile Species NHH-014". The Human Defense Corps were able to defeat a minor Lord of the Damned named Scarmaglione, and Sergeant Montgomery Kelly assumed his powers and claimed his clan and seat for the [[United States of America]]. His status as minor ruler was confirmed by Neron, who was then the First Seated of Hell.<ref>http://www.dcuguide.com/HDC/HDC_004.php</ref><ref name="Human Defense Corps' 2003"/><ref name="dcuguide.com"/>

[[Superman]] briefly became lord of Hell in ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' #666 (October 2007).

The 2008-2009 limited series ''Reign in Hell'' created by [[Keith Giffen]] and [[Tom Derenick]]<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/080620-ReigninHell.html "Better to Reign in Hell - Keith Giffen Talks"], [[Newsarama]], June 20, 2008.</ref><ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=17281 "Keith Giffen Reigns In Hell!"], [[Comic Book Resources]], July 17, 2008.</ref> introduces a new status quo for the DC Comics version of Hell; it also gave readers specific geographical references, and defined a codex of rules that govern the damned. Two years after ''Reign in Hell'', DC decided to remove all DC Universe characters from the Vertigo imprint, though Vertigo would have its own version of Constantine.<ref>http://www.bleedingcool.com/2010/07/23/karen-berger-confirms-dc-characters-to-leave-vertigo/</ref>

==Description==
{{see also|Blaze and Satanus}}
In the [[DC Universe]], Hell is an alternate plane of reality, traditionally accessible only by those of demonic heritage, beings of a higher order, and those whose [[soul]]s have been barred from entering the Silver City. The DC Comics Hell is a debased reflection of Earth, so as Earth became more technologically or socially advanced so does Hell. Due to an effect not unlike [[time dilation]] "[a] day in Hell is equal to a minute's passage on Earth". All denizens of DC's Comics' infernal region known as Hell are all capable of using some form of [[Maleficium (sorcery)|maleficium]], the most powerful infernal magic users are the ruling gentry of Hell, and their enforcers the Necro-Mages, Forges, Renderers, Howlers, and Rhyming Demons. Every building, every piece of furniture, weapons, armor, clothing, food, etc. in hell is made from the bodies of the damned. The damned are put through a process called rendering by the Exegesis Guild, in order to manufacture the raw materials of Hell.<ref name="Hell' 2008">''Reign in Hell'' #1 (September 2008)</ref>

==Fictional history==
During the ''[[Final Night]]'' event, the Rhyming Demon known as Etrigan offered to bring all of the living people of Earth into Hell so they could stay warm.<ref>http://www.dcuguide.com/FN/FN_003.php</ref> During the "[[Day of Judgment (comics)|Day of Judgment]]" storyline, with the help of Etrigan a fallen angel named [[Asmodel]] took control of the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] and sought to destroy Heaven and Hell. He used the Spectre's powers to extinguish the hellfire font, causing Hell to freeze over. A team of heroes including [[Superman]], [[Zatanna]], [[Sebastian Faust|Faust]], [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]], [[Atom (comics)|The Atom]], [[Enchantress (DC Comics)|Enchantress]] and [[Deadman]] were sent deep into Hell in order to reignite the hellfire font. The re-ignition required an act of true evil, so Sebastian Faust took matters into his own hands and slit the Enchantress' throat, thereby satisfying the infernal conditions. The story ends with a three way battle between Neron, Asmodel and Hal Jordan for control over the Spectre Force.<ref>http://www.dcuguide.com/DoJ/DoJ.php</ref>

===Reign in Hell===
{{main|Reign in Hell}}
During the events of ''Reign in Hell'', the Underworld is thrown into a massive conflict as Neron and his generals are confronted with a rebellion led by Lord Satanus and Lady Blaze, the rulers of Purgatory. Neron soon discovered that the rebel demons were offering the damned hope, and that this was a powerful spur. Recognizing what would happen if the damned rose up against him, Neron has his consort Lilith the "mother of all earthborn fiends" summon all [[vampire]]s, [[ghoul]]s, [[werewolf|werewolves]], and infernally powered humans to Hell.

[[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]] who is confined to the Labyrinth, Hell's prison is freed as a result of the titanic battle between Etrigan the Demon and Blue Devil, a battle which results in Etrigan's temporary death at Blue Devil's hands.<ref name="Hell' 2009">''Reign in Hell'' #1-8 (September 2008 - April 2009)</ref> Lobo eviscerates the spirit-form of [[Zatara]] (Zatanna's father) which forces Zatanna to destroy his soul rather than consign him to an eternity of pain and torment. Zatara is later shown to have been saved by a demon who owes him  a favor in the ''Zatanna'' series.

Lord Satanus reveals that he used the war to spread a modified viral version of [[List of comic book drugs#DMN|DMN]], the anagogic drug he had once used to destabilize [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] and confound [[Superman]]. This version of DMN is airborne and when combined with the magical word "[[Shazam (comics)|Shazam]]" it transforms Neron and all of Hell's demons into soulless humans, all except Lilith who was not a true Demon. Satanus then decapitates Neron and takes over as Hell's ruler.<ref>''Reign in Hell'' #7 (March 2009)</ref> The Damned turn their rage upon the now human and powerless demons and imps, slaughtering them wholesale, and damning themselves anew.

Lady Blaze later takes advantage of her brother's momentary weakness during a moment when he allows [[Black Alice (comics)|Black Alice]] to touch him and sample his powers, this action shatters Alice's psyche and allows Lady Blaze to drain Lord Satanus' power and take the throne for herself. At the end of the series the ''Unspoken Principium'' of Hell is revealed by [[Doctor Occult]] "You can leave whenever you want," <ref>''Reign in Hell'' #8 (April 2009)</ref> reiterating what was said about Hell in the Gaiman version.

==Geography==
In the ''Reign in Hell'' mini-series the '''Infernal Dominion''' is divided up into nine provinces, each of which have their own rulers. All rulers bowed to Neron. The Nine Provinces included Pandemonia, The Odium, The Gull, Praetori, Internecia, Ament, Labyrinth, Err, and Purgatory. Below see descriptions of the Nine Provinces of the Infernal Dominion as depicted in the Reign in Hell mini-series.

*'''Pandemonia''' -  The First Province, home of Hell's high caste demons and of Hell's throne, the first seat of the Dominus or Domina.

It is then assumed that these Demon Princes ultimately answer to the crown head of hell. The demoness [[Belyllioth]] is Princess of 1/13th of hell's realms in these stories. She supposedly replaced the previous ruler Dalkriig-Hath once he was destroyed by his bride Artemis. Artemis was by rights next in line to rule her former husband's realm, but instead had the other twelve Princes of hell grant Belyllioth her station instead.<ref>According to ''Artemis: Requiem'' #1-6 (June 1996) and ''Wonder Woman Annual'' (vol. 2) #6 (1997)</ref> Notable in this depiction were the [[Myrmidons]], a race of savage ant-like demons faithful to [[Belyllioth]].<ref>''Artemis: Requiem'' #1</ref>

==Vertigo==

===Description===
{{see also|Lucifer (DC Comics)}}
The [[Vertigo Comics]] imprint also has its own version of Hell, with its own very specific infernal sovereignty formerly ruled by [[Lucifer (DC Comics)|Lucifer Morningstar]].

===Fictional history===
Contrary to popular belief, the term ''Satan'' represents a rank within the legions of Hell and is not a name. The most well-known Satan is Lucifer Morningstar whose rule supplanted that of the [[First of the Fallen]] and the First Triumvirate.<ref>http://www.dcuguide.com/who.php?name=triumvirateofhell</ref> Contrary to popular belief, Lucifer was the fourth fallen Angel and not the first ruler of Hell, though he later became the supreme ruler of Hell for many centuries. When the great Darkness of creation threatened all existence, a civil war erupted in Hell and the realm was split into a triumvirate. Eventually, Lucifer grew bored with his position and retired to Earth with his consort, the Lilim known as [[Mazikeen (comics)|Mazikeen]].

===Geography===
The regions of Vertigo Comics' Hell are not as defined as the mainstream universe after the ''Reign in Hell'' mini-series, but specific areas have been mentioned in various books.

*'''[[Dis (Divine Comedy)|Dis]]''' - a Hellcity, home to the palace of Lucifer Morningstar.<ref>Sandman vol 2 #4 (April 1989)</ref>
*'''Effrul''' - The home province of Lord Arux an Arch-Duke of Hell.
*'''Mashkan-Shapir''' - The home city of Arch-Duke Nergal.<ref>http://www.dcuguide.com/who.php?name=nergal</ref>

===Infernal sovereignty===
The hierarchy of Vertigo Comics' Hell has changed several times over the centuries, the leader of which has always assumed the title of '''Satan'''.  Eventually, Lucifer abandons Hell, gives its key to [[Dream (comics)|Dream]], and eventually, two angels, [[Remiel (DC Comics)|Remiel]] and [[Duma (DC Comics)|Duma]] transform Hell into a place of rehabilitation.  In the interim, Lucifer was shown as ruler of Hell in the DC Universe titles ''[[Etrigan|The Demon]]'', ''[[The Spectre]]'', and ''[[Stanley and His Monster]]''.
