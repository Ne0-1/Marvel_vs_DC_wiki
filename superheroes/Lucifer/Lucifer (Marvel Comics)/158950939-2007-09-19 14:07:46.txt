'''Lucifer''' is a [[fictional character]], an alien [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. His first appearance was in ''The [[Uncanny X-Men]]'' (Vol.1) #9.

Lucifer is an agent of the [[List of Marvel Comics alien races#Quists|Quists]], an alien race who are also known as the Arcane.

==Fictional character biography==
An [[extraterrestrial life|alien]], Lucifer first came to Earth as the vanguard of an [[alien invasion]], which was foiled by the young Charles Xavier (later [[Professor X]], leader of the [[X-Men]]). In retaliation, Lucifer dropped an enormous stone block on Xavier, leaving his legs crippled so that he would need a wheelchair. Lucifer made several later attempts to conquer Earth, all foiled by the X-Men or other heroes, although one of his attempts did force the first X-Men team to confront the original [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] due to a misunderstanding. He was eventually banished to an alternate realm known as the Nameless Dimension, where he used "ionic energy" to give himself superhuman strength and the ability to project force beams from his hands, in addition to his apparently pre-existing telepathic powers.  He continued to try conquering Earth by using his "dimensional transmitter" to imbue humans with ionic energy and turning them into his minions. His masters ultimately apparently "terminated" him for his failures, and replaced him with the computer [[Dominus (Marvel Comics)|Dominus]].

==Other media==
In the novel ''Shadows of the Past'' by [[Michael Jan Friedman]], Lucifer is revealed to be alive, capturing Professor X and replacing him with an ionic energy duplicate, while trapping Xavier in the Nameless Dimension with him. Using the original X-Men, the duplicate Professor dispatched them to acquire three components from Quistalian outposts around the globe, intending to use them to alter the machine that had sent the Professor into the Nameless Dimension so that it could be used to allow him to return to Earth. Fortunately, although the dimensional distance prevented the Professor from telepathically contacting his students directly, he was able to make contact with Jeffery Saunders, the mentally handicapped grandson of a deceased friend of his, whose mental state meant that he lacked the conflicting thoughts that had prevented the Professor reaching the X-Men. Using Jeffrey's physically superior body, the Professor was not only able to alert the X-Men to the deception- thanks to [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] (The only member of the team to see how the Professor treated the ''real'' Jeffrey) realizing that the duplicate was acting out-of-character, but later defeated an ionic duplicate of [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]] that could have allowed Lucifer to use the portal to return to their dimension. With Xavier's return, the machine is destroyed, leaving Lucifer to fume and plot his revenge in the Nameless Dimension once again.
