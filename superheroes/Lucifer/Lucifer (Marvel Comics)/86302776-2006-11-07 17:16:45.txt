An [[extraterrestrial life|alien]], he first came to Earth as the vanguard of an [[alien invasion]], which was foiled by the young Charles Xavier (later [[Professor X]], leader of the [[X-Men]]). In retaliation, Lucifer dropped an enormous stone block on Xavier, leaving him in a wheelchair. Lucifer made several later attempts to conquer Earth, all foiled by the X-Men. His masters ultimately "terminated" him for his failures, and replaced him with the computer [[Dominus (comics)|Dominus]].
