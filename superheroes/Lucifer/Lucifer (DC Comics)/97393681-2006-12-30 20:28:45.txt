'''''Lucifer''''' is a [[comic book]] published by [[Vertigo (comics)|Vertigo]], an [[imprint]] of [[DC Comics]].

{{Spoiler}}


The series concerns the adventures of the [[fallen angel]] [[Lucifer|Lucifer Morningstar]] on [[Earth]], in [[heaven]] and through other realms of creation. 

==Sandman continuity==

In the earlier related series ''[[The Sandman (DC Comics Modern Age)|The Sandman]]'', written by [[Neil Gaiman]], Lucifer abandoned his lordship over [[Hell]]. While Lucifer had previously appeared in various stereotypical guises in earlier DC books, Gaiman's version was unique and premised on English poet and prose writer [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]''. In the Sandman series, Lucifer had ruled as lord of Hell for ten billion years. Over that time, he had manipulated the various demons of Hell against each other, provided a place for dead mortals to be tormented, and led the war against Heaven. However, at some point during his rule, he had become bored with his existence. He became tired of the various stereotypes that mortals held of the devil, such as the idea that he purchased and traded for souls, which were largely untrue. He had become tired of his reign over Hell, and felt it an unfair punishment that he should have to rule there forever simply because he once rebelled. In the Sandman story ''[[The Sandman: Season of Mists|Season of Mists]]'', Lucifer expels all demons and damned souls from Hell before locking Hell's gates and handing over the key to Hell to [[Dream (DC Comics)|Dream of the Endless]], the title character of The Sandman series. Eventually, control of Hell was handed over to two Angels, Duma (the angel of silence) and Remiel ("who stumbled rather than fell"), while Lucifer simply retired to Earth.

== Solo ongoing series ==

Written by [[Mike Carey]], Lucifer's story continues. Now running a piano bar (an element introduced in the Sandman story ''[[The Sandman: The Kindly Ones|The Kindly Ones]]'') called "Lux" in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] with the assistance of his Lilim female consort, [[Mazikeen]], Lucifer is portrayed as sophisticated and almost charming, similar to the stereotypical [[Christian]] [[devil]]. Beneath his charisma, however, Lucifer is a deadly and [[Machiavellianism|Machiavellian]] character, with no regard for human life or indeed anyone or anything but himself: a proud and vindictive fallen angel who has no qualms using powers second only to those of his father, [[Yahweh]]. In fact, during the fourth book of the Sandman series, Lucifer is described as having been the wisest, most beautiful and most powerful of all the angels in heaven. Despite his [[Egotism|egotistic]] and [[narcissistic]] tendencies, he does follow something akin to a [[honor|code of honor]], refusing to lie (which he considers crass and undignified), insisting on paying back debts, and keeping his word.

As the series opened in 1999, Lucifer's "restful" retirement was disturbed by a series of associates from his past, and after various catalytic events, he endeavored to create a universe in competition with (and presumably against the wishes of) his father, [[Yahweh]].  This puts him on a collision course with several powerful mystical entities that have a vested interest in the new creation and draws the angelic host into the fray - including his brother, the archangel [[Michael Demiurgos]].

The series paralleled Sandman in several ways, with epic fantasy stories being told in arcs separated by oneshot episodes depicting a smaller, more personal tale. Unlike Sandman, the series has had a consistant art team of Peter Gross and Richard Kelly, with the odd issues illustrated by a variaty of artists, but mostly Dean Ormston. The title's 50th issue was penciled by P. Craig Russel, homaging Sandman#50. Structurally, aside from the meeting in Hell that Lucifer arranges with angel Amandiel in much the same way Dream did with himself in the pages of Sandman, the series follows its own path. Being what it is, many Gods appear, with greater focus on Judeo-Christian religion (as viewed by John Milton in 'Paradise lost'), Chinese and Nordic mythology than in Sandman. As for the Endless themselves, all but Destruction, Desire and Despair make small and very rare appearences. 

Strong-willed and sure of himself, Lucifer himself is also opposite in character to the more romantic and introspective Dream, even though for some reason he loses a bit of sadistic spark and the charm in the last third of the series.

Cover art has changed hands, going from Duncan Fegredo to Christian Moeller and eventually Michael Wm Kalluta. Strangely, the letters are inconsistent, with the first half of the series carrying particularly established fonts of Gaudium, Michael and God only to drop almost all of them save Lucifer's towards the end with numerious changes in the letterers. 

The series is densly packed with plot particularly hard to follow if not read as a whole in a short space of time. It comes full circle especially at the end when even the bit players from the beginning of the series and the excellent "the Morningstar option" mini preceding it, finding their subplot's end.

The links to DC universe are very sparse, consisting of mainly Lucifer at one point during "Gods and monsters" storyline leaving to the end of the universe and shown referencing Jack Kirby's New Gods mythology, via the Wall and the Source. No superheroes are shown, named or implied to exist, with even Vertigo mythology sans Sandman getting very small mentions contained in one-panel appearance of Vertigo Swamp Thing and a surprise showing of it's counterpart in Lucifer's cosmos. Hellblazer's John Constantine appears in "Gods and monsters" in a very small role, discussing the plot but not actively participating in it.

The series ended in June [[2006]] with issue #75 and has thus far been collected in eleven books, with a standalone story (''Lucifer: Nirvana'') published as a smaller [[graphic novel]]. The series' parent title, ''The Sandman'', also ran for 75 issues.

==Notes==
In ''[[Weird Mystery Tales]]'' #4 (Jan-Feb 1973), a story by [[Jack Oleck]] and [[Ruben Yandoc|Rubeny]] depicts Lucifer, looking much like his present incarnation, save for a few panels in which he appeared as a more traditional [[devil]], held prisoner by an order of [[monk]]s.  It also presents a prisoner switch trick not unlike the one performed in ''[[The Sandman: Season of Mists]]'', in addition to being hosted by [[Destiny (DC Comics)|Destiny]].  This story may or may not be considered in continuity, or have been an influence on Gaiman and Carey.  In the story, Lucifer gave Philip Burton his form in order to trade places with him and fulfill his wish for immortality.  Lucifer walked away in the body of the elderly Burton.
