'''''Lucifer''''' is a [[comic book]] published by [[Vertigo (comics)|Vertigo]], an imprint of [[DC Comics]].

{{Spoiler}}
The series concerns the adventures on Earth (and beyond) of the [[fallen angel]] [[Lucifer|Lucifer Morningstar]], who had abandoned his lordship over [[Hell]] earlier in the related series ''[[The Sandman (DC Comics Modern Age)|The Sandman]]'', written by [[Neil Gaiman]]. While Lucifer had previously appeared in various stereotypical guises in earlier DC books, Gaiman's version was unique and premised on English poet and prose writer [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]''. In the Sandman series, Lucifer had ruled as lord of Hell for ten billion years. Over that time, he had manipulated the various demons of Hell against each other, provided a place for dead mortals to be tormented, and lead the war against Heaven. However, at some point during his rule, he had become bored with his existence. He became tired of the different sterotypes that mortals held of the devil, such as the idea that he purchased and traded for souls, that were largely untrue. He had become tired of his reign over Hell, and felt it an unfair punishment that he should have to rule there forever simply because he once rebelled. He then expelled all demons and damned souls from Hell before locking Hell's gates and handing over the key to Hell to Dream of Endless, the title character of The Sandman series. Eventually, control of Hell was handed over to two Angels, Duma and Remiel, while Lucifer simply retired to Earth. 

Written by [[Mike Carey]], Lucifer's story continues where he improbably runs a piano bar called "Lux" in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] with the assistance of his demonic female cohort, [[Mazikeen]]. He is portrayed as sophisticated and almost charming, rather than the stereotypical [[Christian]] [[devil]]. Beneath this veneer, however, Lucifer is a deadly and [[Niccolo Machiavelli|Machiavelli]]an character, with no regard for human life or indeed anyone or anything but himself: a proud and vindictive fallen angel who has no qualms using powers second only to those of his father, [[Yahweh]]. In fact, during the fourth book of the Sandman series, Lucifer is described as having been the wisest, most beautiful and most powerful of all the angels in heaven. Despite his [[solipsistic]], [[narcissistic]] tendencies, he does follow something akin to a [[code of honor]], refusing to lie (which he considers crass and undignified), insisting on paying back debts, and keeping his word - literally.

As the series opened in 1999, Lucifer's "restful" retirement was disturbed by a series of associates from his past, and after various catalytic events, he endeavored to create a universe in competition with (and presumably against the wishes of) his father, [[Yahweh]].  This puts him on a collision course with several powerful mystical entities that have a vested interest in the new creation and draws the angelic host into the fray - including his brother, the archangel [[Michael Demiurgos]].

The series, as of [[July]] [[2005]] is still in progress, and has thus far been collected in eight books, with a standalone story (''Lucifer: Nirvana'') published as a smaller [[graphic novel]]. Carey has stated the series will end with issue #75, probably to be published in May 2006.
