'''Lucifer''' is a [[DC Comics]] [[Character (fiction)|character]] that starred in an eponymous [[comic book]] published under the [[Vertigo Comics|Vertigo]] [[imprint]], whose entire run was written by [[Mike Carey (writer)|Mike Carey]]. Though various depictions of Lucifer &mdash; the [[Biblical]] [[fallen angel]] and [[devil]] of the [[Abrahamic religions]] &mdash; have been presented by DC Comics in their run, his modern interpretation by [[Neil Gaiman]] first debuted in ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'' in 1989. Like many modern interpretations of [[Satan]], DC's Lucifer owes much to the character's portrayal in [[John Milton]]'s epic poem ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', though Gaiman adapts the character to fit the fictional [[DC Universe]] where their comics are set, where the character exists alongside superheroes and deities from multiple religions.

Later, the character acquired an [[ongoing series|ongoing]] ''Lucifer'' spin-off  series, depicting his adventures on Earth, Heaven, and in the various other realms of creation after abandoning [[Hell (DC Comics)|Hell]] in the ''Sandman'' series.<ref name="vert-ency">{{Citation  | last = Irvine | first = Alex | author-link = Alexander C.

Two angels, several demons, a human, and briefly, [[Superman]],<ref>''Superman'' #666</ref> have taken his place as ruler of Hell, and the ''[[Reign in Hell]]'' series further straightened things out.

==Fictional character biography==
===Sandman continuity===
In the earlier related series ''[[The Sandman (DC Comics Modern Age)|The Sandman]]'', written by [[Neil Gaiman]], Lucifer abandoned his lordship over [[Hell]]. While Lucifer had previously appeared in various stereotypical guises in earlier DC books, Gaiman's version was unique and premised on English poet and prose writer [[John Milton|John Milton's]] ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (at Gaiman's request of the artist Lucifer looks like [[David Bowie]]). In the Sandman series, Lucifer had ruled as lord of Hell for ten billion years, after rebelling three seconds after Creation. Over that time, he had manipulated the various demons of Hell against each other, provided a place for dead mortals to be tormented, and led the war against Heaven. 

However, at some point during his rule, he had become bored with his existence. He became tired of the various stereotypes that mortals held of the devil, such as the idea that he purchased and traded for souls, which were largely untrue, and that he forced mortals to commit evil acts. He had become tired of his reign over Hell, and felt it an unfair punishment that he should have to rule there forever simply because he once rebelled. In the Sandman story ''[[The Sandman: Season of Mists|Season of Mists]]'', Lucifer expels all demons and damned souls from Hell before locking Hell's gates and handing over the key to Hell to [[Dream (DC Comics)|Dream of the Endless]], the title character of The Sandman series. Eventually, control of Hell was handed over to two Angels, [[Duma (DC Comics)|Duma]] (the angel of silence) and [[Ramiel|Remiel]] ("set over those who rise"), while Lucifer simply retired to Earth, initially to [[Perth, Western Australia]]<ref>''Sandman'' #28, July 1991: "[[The Sandman: Season of Mists|Season of Mists]]" part 7</ref> and later to [[Los Angeles, California]].<ref>''Sandman'' #57, February 1994, p21: "[[The Sandman: The Kindly Ones|The Kindly Ones]]" part 1</ref>

===Solo series===
Lucifer was the main character in an eponymous series that ran for 75 issues and the ''Lucifer: Nirvana'' one-shot, from June 2000 to August 2006, the entire run of which was written by [[Mike Carey (British writer)|Mike Carey]]. (This series was preceded by 1999's Carey-penned ''The Sandman Presents: Lucifer'' miniseries.)  Carey described the book as being "autobiographical", in so much as Lucifer is so much the opposite of the author and all humanity that he "defines [us] in negative": to Carey, the essence of the character was that "we play safe. Most of us do, most of the time . . . but Lucifer doesn't know the meaning of safe, and he never bothers to look down at the tramlines. He goes wherever the hell he likes, picks his fights where he finds them and generally wins . . . following [his] own will and [his] own instincts to the very end of the line, no matter what the obstacles are".<ref>{{cite| last=Carey| first=Mike |title=On The Ledge| publisher=DC Comics / Vertigo |date=July 2000}}</ref>

In the series, Lucifer runs a piano bar (an element introduced in the Sandman story ''[[The Sandman: The Kindly Ones|The Kindly Ones]]'') called "Lux" in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], with the assistance of his female consort, [[Mazikeen (comics)|Mazikeen]] who is a [[Lilim]], one of the race descended from [[Lilith]]. Lucifer is portrayed as a sophisticated and charming man, according to the stereotypical gentleman-[[devil]].<ref name="vert-ency"/>

The theme of the Lucifer series revolves around the [[free will]] problem. Carey's Lucifer is a [[Nietzsche]]an figure representing will and individual willpower, who challenges the 'tyranny of predestination'. While in heaven's eyes this is blasphemy, Lucifer points out that rebellion (and indeed all sin) and damnation as consequence were pre-planned by his Creator.  Lucifer rejects God's rule as tyrannical and unjust.  Violent, aggressive, vengeful, and dictatorial aspects of heaven's rule are represented mostly by the archangel Amenadiel, who has a particular hatred of Lucifer and leads attacks of various kinds against him, such as verbal criticism, marshalling the host of heaven as well as challenging him to individual combat - almost all of it without the slightest care for the countless innocent, unwilling and unwitting victims he is more than willing to sacrifice for his own pride. For his part, Lucifer disdains Amenadiel, treating his emotional outbursts with contempt and repeatedly defeats his assaults with Machiavellian scheming.

Elaborate codes of conduct and schemes of entrapment based on these codes are vital elements of the DC\Vertigo magical universe.  Lucifer appears as the master of these Machiavellian arts. In an encounter during the first Sandman story arc (around issue 5#) a weakened Dream outsmarts Lucifer. Lucifer first swears revenge on Dream, but later comes to accept Dream's critique of his role and project as Lord of Hell. This inspires Lucifer's abdication, a vital element of the Sandman saga, and the point of departure for the Lucifer series.<ref name="vert-ency"/>

For Lucifer and Dream, their word is bond.  This shared characteristic is key to both character's mastery of manipulation and maneuvering in the realms of magic.  As David Easterman, a character who sees himself as a victim of Lucifer, puts it: "when the devil wants you to do something, he doesn't lie at all.  He tells you the exact, literal truth.  And he lets you find your own way to hell" <ref>Lucifer Vol 1. Issue 11</ref> Refusal to lie is also central to the moral position of both characters- they see themselves as neutral or amoral facilitators of forces within individuals (will and dreams respectively) with Lucifer actively and effectively combating what he regards as corrupting moral codes.  While both characters avoiding lying, their callous morality seldom extends to compassion.  Both sagas are moral dramas, but while Sandman involves a tale of atonement, Lucifer is concerned with war and peace in the heavens, with Lucifer regarding the sacrifice of millions of souls as unimportant collateral damage, with there being few, if any beings he respects and even less he cares for. It should be reminded, however, that it is very difficult to discern when Lucifer acts as a slave to predestination and when he effectively acts according to his own free will.

As the series opened in [[2000 in comics|2000]], Lucifer's "restful" retirement was disturbed by a series of associates from his past, and after various catalytic events, he endeavored to create a universe in competition with (and presumably against the wishes of) his father, [[Yahweh]]. This puts him on a collision course with several powerful mystical entities that have a vested interest in the new creation and draws the angelic host into the fray - including his brother, the archangel [[Michael Demiurgos]], and his niece, [[Elaine Belloc]].

The series paralleled The Sandman in several ways, with epic fantasy stories being told in arcs separated by [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] episodes depicting a smaller, more personal tale. Unlike Sandman, the series has had a consistent art team in [[Peter Gross (comics)|Peter Gross]] and [[Ryan Kelly (comics)|Ryan Kelly]], with most of the odd issues illustrated by Dean Ormston. The title's 50th issue was penciled by [[P. Craig Russell]], homaging ''Sandman ''#50. Structurally, aside from the meeting in Hell that Lucifer arranges with angel Amenadiel in much the same way Dream did with himself in the pages of Sandman, the series follows its own path. Numerous Gods appear, with greater focus on Judeo-Christian religion (as viewed by John Milton in ''Paradise Lost''), Japanese and Nordic mythology than in Sandman. As for the Endless themselves, all but Desire and Despair appear, but their appearances are small and very rare.

However subtle, the influence of the Endless throughout the series is undeniable, as their roles are paralleled by other almost similar notions : Destiny of the Endless acts like predestination - Lucifer finds Destiny "offensive as a concept" and tells him "[He knows he is] really just a SIDE effect of [his] FATHER. Or rather, his deterministic APPROACH to the act of creation." His contempt for Destiny (though "It's really nothing PERSONAL.") is mostly due to the fact that Lucifer has spent the major part of eternity trying to break free from predestination; Lucifer is a psychopomp, like Death; the way Lucifer manipulates reality resembles Dream's ability to bring dream objects into the waking world; both destruction and creation are tied together by Michael's death and the way Lucifer uses its power to create a new world, which reminds us of Destruction's dual nature; One of the various reasons why Destruction left his realm and responsibilities was that "light and matter are interchangeable", which is confirmed in the series by the fact that angels are made of pure light; Fenris takes on the role of absolute dissolution and destruction; just like Destruction, Lucifer abandoned his realm and responsibilities partly because of a revelation as well (due to Dream's comment in Hell); Many characters just follow their immediate desires, without regards for others - similarly, "Desire is a creature of the moment" and "Desire is cruel", as it uses to play horrible games with mortals; Hell and the House Of Windowless Rooms are places of almost ultimate despair (the House Of Windowless Rooms somehow parallels Despair's realm); Several characters are in a state of delirium.

Cover artists included [[Duncan Fegredo]], [[Christopher Moeller]] and [[Michael William Kaluta|Mike Kaluta]]. The letters are inconsistent, with the first half of the series carrying particularly established fonts of Gaudium, Michael and God only to drop almost all of them save Lucifer's towards the end with numerous changes in the letterers. 

The series ended in June [[2006 in comics|2006]] with issue #75 and has thus far been collected in eleven books, with a standalone story (''Lucifer: Nirvana'') published as a smaller [[graphic novel]]. The series' parent title, ''The Sandman'', also ran for 75 issues.

In its concluding issue, the Lucifer story mirror the theme of other contemporary DC comic series. When Lucifer ventures outside creation, he sees something resembling the comics pages themselves, a meta-effect which was a year earlier also used in the finale of the [[Promethea]] series by Alan Moore, published on Wildstorm, a subsidiary of DC. 
In the end of the Lucifer story arc, God and the devil are no longer part of the universe and a former human ([[Elaine Belloc]]) is instead presiding over it. New concepts for heaven and hell are created, inspired and influenced by other human or superhuman characters in the story. The new situation is described on several occasions by the fallen cherubs Gaudium and Spera. In essence it is "growing up" i.e.: the need to find your own truth and values without being told by your parents.

This resolution is similar to the one in the DC series [[Preacher (comics)|Preacher]], where the struggle between good and evil ends with both God and the devil out of the picture and man in control of his own destiny.

==Powers and abilities==
Lucifer possesses incalculable power; he can shape the matter of creation into anything he can imagine including matter, energy, and more abstract concepts such as time.  However, he does have certain limitations.  Simply put, he cannot create something out of nothing.  He needs existing matter (and where that is unavailable, the Demiurgic power of the archangel Michael) to provide the foundation for him to shape.  Only his brother Michael Demiurgos is his equal in power.  However, in certain dimensions he is powerless and his mobility is limited without his angelic wings. He may choose to temporarily abandon his powers (including immortality) and it is strongly suggested that even he could not survive if his heart were to be eaten by another character. In the story "Lilith", it is implied that his father could destroy him at his whim - which makes "[Lucifer] sometimes WONDER [...] why he hasn't dealt with [him] ALREADY." He is never without the formidable resources of his brilliant intellect and his unbending will however.  Although Lucifer's overt exercises of power are limited in the books, if he is provoked to violence his preference always seems to be to use fire as a weapon.  His original role was "God's lamplighter," using his unmatched will to condense clouds of hydrogen into star-masses, and setting them alight.  As terrifying as they are brief, battles with Lucifer usually begin (and end) with him drawing down the flames of some superheated star and incinerating to ash anything in the immediate area. However, the true reasons why he favors light and fire are partly explained in the story "Lilith" (from "Lucifer : The Wolf Beneath The Tree").

==Other versions==
* ''The Unofficial Guide to the DC Universe'' lists Lucifer as first having appeared in a dream in ''[[Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen (comic)|Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen]]'' #65 (1962).<ref name="TheUnofficial">[http://www.dcuguide.com/chronology.php?name=lucifer The Unofficial Lucifer Morningstar Chronology<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  He appears when [[Jimmy Olsen]] attempts to memorize a [[devil's food cake]] recipe with his alleged [[photographic memory]] and dreams that he is in France 300 years in the past.  Putting on the clothing of a bandit who has ditched them, Jimmy is arrested and sent to rot in [[Devil's Island]] [[Penal Colony]].  A bald man known as Lord L offers five years of freedom for people to escape in exchange for their souls.  Convinced that the magic the man uses is technological in nature, assuming him to be an ancestor of [[Lex Luthor]], he asks to be returned to from where he came, believing Lord L will be long dead by then and unable to claim him.  Lord L shows up at his front door, still bald but now with a [[goatee]], and insists that he is Lucifer and has given him over 300 years extra, but will dine with him before taking him, but disappears when Jimmy serves him cake.  [[Superman]] wakes Jimmy soon after and reveals that the card he memorized was really for [[angel food cake]], and this is why Lucifer disappeared.
* In ''[[Weird Mystery Tales]]'' #4 (Jan-Feb 1973), a story by [[Jack Oleck]] and [[Ruben Yandoc|Rubeny]] depicts Lucifer, looking much like his present incarnation, save for a few panels in which he appeared as a more traditional [[devil]], held prisoner by an order of [[monk]]s. It also presents a prisoner switch trick not unlike the one performed in ''[[The Sandman: Season of Mists]]'', in addition to being hosted by [[Destiny (DC Comics)|Destiny]], another character later used by Gaiman. In the story, Lucifer gave Philip Burton his form in order to trade places with him and fulfill his wish for immortality. Lucifer walked away in the body of the elderly Burton.
*A character called Lucifer, The Fallen Angel appears in ''[[Blue Devil]]'' #31 (the final issue).  He has angelic wings and a halo, and his face includes dark facial hair.  He does not have horns.  [[Madame Xanadu]] recognizes that even with a magic book, he is not the real Lucifer.  He is simply a washed-up actor who decides to be a costumed criminal for a living.  He is dragged into Hell on a train at the end of the issue.
*The Unofficial Guide to the DC Universe lists Lucifer's first genuine [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|pre-Crisis]] appearance as ''[[DC Special Series]]'' #8 (1978's ''[[The Brave and the Bold]] Special'' Starring [[Batman]], [[Deadman]] and [[Sgt. Rock]]).<ref name="TheUnofficial" /> This character has hair and wings like Lucifer as he appears in ''Sandman'' #4, but he is red-skinned and has a face like  a traditional devil, complete with goatee, though his horns may be part of a headband.  His appearance in the comic is brief, but he is specifically referred to as "Lucifer," rather than by other epithets.  He has an advisory board consisting of [[Guy Fawkes]], [[Benedict Arnold]], [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Jack the Ripper]], [[Nero]], and [[Bluebeard]].  He has an operative, Edward Dirkes, set bombs, while using a bronze [[Batman]] statue transported by the [[Easy Company (comics)|Easy Company]] like a [[voodoo doll]].
*Writer [[Garth Ennis]] introduced a character intended to be the Devil as an antagonist in his run on the ''[[Hellblazer]]'' comic: however, as the character appeared at the same time as Gaiman's reuse of the Lucifer character, Ennis had to introduce a new back story for his character to distinguish the two: the ''Hellblazer'' character was named the [[First of the Fallen]], and was ruler of Hell prior to and after Lucifer's reign. How this fits in with the reigns of the angels and Christopher Rudd has not been clarified, although the First of the Fallen mentions Duma and Remiel ruling Hell during Ennis' run.
*[[Satan]] has appeared as a distinct figure in numerous DC comics.<ref>http://www.comicbookdb.com/character_chron.php?ID=15956</ref>
* In one of DC-Vertigo's "Fables" spinoffs, "Jack Of Fables", the titular character made various (totally stupid) pacts with several devils. One of them is heavily inspired by Milton's "Paradise Lost".
