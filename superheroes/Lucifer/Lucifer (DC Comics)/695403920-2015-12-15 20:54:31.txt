'''Lucifer Morningstar''' is a [[DC Comics]] [[Character (fiction)|character]] appearing primarily as a supporting character in the [[comic book]] series [[The Sandman (Vertigo)|''The Sandman'']] and as the title character of a [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]], both published under the [[Vertigo Comics|Vertigo]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]].

Though various depictions of [[Lucifer]] – the [[Biblical]] [[fallen angel]] and [[Devil]] of the [[Abrahamic religions]] – have been presented by DC Comics in their run, this interpretation by [[Neil Gaiman]] debuted in ''The Sandman'' in 1989. Like many modern interpretations of [[Satan]], DC's Lucifer owes much to the character's portrayal in [[John Milton]]'s epic poem ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', though Gaiman adapts the character to fit the fictional [[DC Universe]] where their comics are set, where the character exists alongside superheroes and deities from multiple religions.

Later, the character acquired an [[ongoing series|ongoing]] ''Lucifer'' spin-off series written by [[Mike Carey (writer)|Mike Carey]], depicting his adventures on Earth, Heaven, and in the various other realms of his family's creations and in uncreated voids after abandoning [[Hell (DC Comics)|Hell]] in the ''Sandman'' series.<ref name="vert-ency">{{Citation  | last = Irvine | first = Alex | author-link = Alexander C.

In 2010, [[IGN]] named Lucifer as the 68th greatest comic book villain of all time.<ref name="ign-top-100-villains">''Lucifer is number 68'', 2010: [http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/68.html IGN comics &mdash; Lucifer is number 68]</ref>

==Fictional character biography==

===Sandman continuity===
In the earlier related series [[The Sandman (DC Comics Modern Age)|''The Sandman'']], written by [[Neil Gaiman]], Lucifer abandoned his lordship over [[Hell]]. While Lucifer had previously appeared in various stereotypical guises in earlier DC books, Gaiman's version was premised on English poet and prose writer [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (at Gaiman's request of the artist, Lucifer looks like [[David Bowie]] at the time).<ref>"...Neil was adamant that the Devil was David Bowie. He just said, 'He is. You ''must'' draw David Bowie. Find David Bowie, or I'll send you David Bowie. Because if it isn't David Bowie, you're going to have to redo it until it ''is'' David Bowie.' So I said, 'Okay, it's David Bowie.'..." Kelley Jones, from ''Hanging out with the Dream King'' (a book consisting of interviews with Gaiman's collaborators)</ref> In the ''Sandman'' series, Lucifer had ruled as Lord of Hell for 10,000,000,000 years after rebelling three seconds after Creation. Over that time, he had manipulated the various demons of Hell against each other, provided a place for dead mortals to be tormented, and led the war against Heaven.

However, at some point during his rule, he had become bored with his existence. He became tired of the various [[stereotype]]s and prejudices that mortals held of the Devil, such as the idea that he purchased and traded for souls, which were largely untrue, and that he forced mortals to commit evil acts. He had become tired of his reign over Hell, and felt it an unfair punishment that he should have to rule there forever simply because he once rebelled. In the ''Sandman'' story [[The Sandman: Season of Mists|"Season of Mists"]], Lucifer expels all demons and damned souls from Hell before locking Hell's gates and handing over the key to Hell to [[Dream (DC Comics)|Dream of the Endless]], the title character of the ''Sandman'' series. Eventually, control of Hell was handed over to two angels, [[Duma (DC Comics)|Duma]] (the angel of silence) and [[Remiel (DC Comics)|Remiel]] ("set over those who rise"), while Lucifer simply retired to Earth, initially to [[Perth, Western Australia]]<ref>''Sandman'' #28, July 1991: [[The Sandman: Season of Mists|"Season of Mists"]] part 7</ref> and later to [[Los Angeles, California]].<ref>''Sandman'' #57, February 1994, p21: [[The Sandman: The Kindly Ones|"The Kindly Ones"]] part 1</ref>

By the end of the series, however, it is revealed that Hell was not a punishment, but a gift: being the furthest possible place from the throne of light, Lucifer could be as separated from God as possible. Lucifer never created the physical features of Hell - Hell created itself around him.

===Solo series===
Lucifer was the main character in an eponymous series that ran for 75 issues and the ''Lucifer: Nirvana'' one-shot, from June 2000 to August 2006, the entire run of which was written by [[Mike Carey (British writer)|Mike Carey]]. (This series was preceded by Carey's work in 1999, ''The Sandman Presents: Lucifer'' miniseries.)  To Carey, the essence of the character was:
{{quote|We play safe. Most of us do, most of the time... but Lucifer doesn't know the meaning of safe, and he never bothers to look down at the tramlines. He goes wherever the hell he likes, picks his fights where he finds them and generally wins... following [his] own will and [his] own instincts to the very end of the line, no matter what the obstacles are.<ref>{{citation| last=Carey| first=Mike |title=On The Ledge| publisher=DC Comics / Vertigo |date=July 2000}}</ref>}}

In the series, Lucifer runs a [[piano bar]] (an element introduced in the Sandman story [[The Sandman: The Kindly Ones|"The Kindly Ones"]]) called "Lux" in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], with the assistance of his female consort, [[Mazikeen (comics)|Mazikeen]] who is a [[Lilim]], one of the race descended from [[Lilith]]. Lucifer is portrayed as a sophisticated and charming man, in accordance with the stereotypical gentleman-[[devil]].<ref name="vert-ency"/>

The theme of the ''Lucifer'' series revolves around the [[free will|free-will]] problem. Carey's Lucifer is a figure representing will and individual willpower, who challenges the "tyranny of [[predestination]]". While in Heaven's eyes this is [[blasphemy]], Lucifer points out that the rebellion (and indeed all sin) and [[damnation]] as consequence were pre-planned by his Creator, God. Lucifer rejects God's rule and moral philosophy as tyrannical and unjust. The violent, aggressive, totalitarian, vengeful, and dictatorial aspects of Heaven's rule are represented mostly by the Archangel Amenadiel, who has a particular hatred of Lucifer and leads attacks of various kinds against him. The attacks include verbal criticism, marshaling the [[host of Heaven]], as well as challenging him to individual combat - almost all of it without the slightest care for the countless innocent, unwilling and unwitting victims he is more than willing to sacrifice for his own pride. For his part, Lucifer disdains Amenadiel, treating the latter's emotional outbursts with contempt, and repeatedly defeats Amenadiel's assaults with well-orchestrated, hidden plans. Ironically, however, it is often difficult to discern when Lucifer acts as a slave to predestination and when he effectively acts according to his own free will.

Elaborate codes of conduct and schemes of entrapment based on these codes are vital elements of the DC\Vertigo magical universe.  Lucifer appears as a master of these arts. In an encounter during the first ''Sandman'' [[story arc]] (around issue #5) a weakened Dream outsmarts Lucifer. Lucifer first swears revenge on Dream, but later comes to accept Dream's critique of his role and project as Lord of Hell. This inspires Lucifer's abdication, a vital element of the ''Sandman'' saga, and the point of departure for the ''Lucifer'' series.<ref name="vert-ency"/>

For Lucifer, his [[Gentlemen's agreement|word is bond]]. As David Easterman, a character who sees himself as a victim of Lucifer, puts it:
{{quote|When the Devil wants you to do something, he doesn't lie at all. He tells you the exact, literal truth. And he lets you find your own way to Hell.<ref>''Lucifer'' Vol 1. Issue #11</ref>}} Despite his theological title as the "Lord of Lies", refusal to lie is central to the moral position of the character&nbsp;- he sees himself as a neutral or amoral facilitator of forces within individuals, and Lucifer actively and effectively combats what he regards as corrupting moral codes.  While he avoids lying, his morality seldom extends to compassion, with Lucifer regarding the sacrifice of millions of souls as unimportant [[collateral damage]], with there being few, if any, beings he respects and even fewer for whom he cares.

As the series opened in [[2000 in comics|2000]], Lucifer's "restful" retirement was disturbed by a series of associates from his past. After various catalytic events, he endeavored to create a universe in competition with (and presumably against the wishes of) his father, [[Presence (DC Comics)|Yahweh]]. This puts him on a collision course with several powerful mystical entities that have a vested interest in the new creation and draws the angelic host into the fray&nbsp;- including his brother, the archangel [[Michael Demiurgos]], and his niece, [[Elaine Belloc]].

The series paralleled ''The Sandman'' in several ways, with epic fantasy stories being told in arcs separated by [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] episodes depicting a smaller, more personal tale. Unlike ''The Sandman'', the series has had a consistent art team in [[Peter Gross (comics)|Peter Gross]] and [[Ryan Kelly (comics)|Ryan Kelly]], with most of the odd issues illustrated by Dean Ormston. The title's 50th issue was penciled by [[P. Craig Russell]], an homage to ''The Sandman'' #50. Structurally, the series mostly follows its own path. Numerous gods appear, with greater focus on Judeo-Christian religion (as viewed by John Milton in ''Paradise Lost''), Japanese, and Nordic mythology than in ''Sandman''. As for the Endless themselves, Dream, Death, Delirium, and Destiny appear, but their appearances are small and rare. Destiny, perhaps, plays the biggest role in so far as he represents predestination, which Lucifer of course finds "offensive as a concept," stating that Lucifer knows Destiny is "really just a SIDE effect of [Lucifer's] FATHER, or rather, his deterministic APPROACH to the act of creation."

Cover artists included [[Duncan Fegredo]], [[Christopher Moeller]] and [[Michael William Kaluta|Mike Kaluta]]. The letters are inconsistent, with the first half of the series carrying particularly established fonts of Gaudium, [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] and God, only to drop almost all of them, save Lucifer's, towards the end with numerous changes in the letterers.

The series ended in June [[2006 in comics|2006]] with issue #75 and has thus far been collected in eleven books, with a standalone story (''Lucifer: Nirvana'') published as a smaller [[graphic novel]]. The series' parent title, ''The Sandman'', also ran for 75 issues.

When Lucifer ventures outside Creation, he sees something resembling the comics pages themselves. In the end of the ''Lucifer'' [[story arc]], God and the Devil are no longer part of the universe, and a former human ([[Elaine Belloc]]) is instead presiding over it. New concepts for Heaven and Hell are created, inspired and influenced by other human or superhuman characters in the story. The new situation is described on several occasions by the fallen cherubs Gaudium and Spera. In essence, it is "growing up", i.e., the need to find one's own truth and values without being directed by parents, elders, teachers, authority figures, etc.

===The New 52===
The ''New 52'' reinterpretation of Lucifer is much more influenced by traditional Judeo-Christian theology. He is depicted as a malevolent, sadistic, and cunning fallen angel who is the ruler of Hell and seeks to possess human souls. He is held with great respect and fear by the denizens of Hell, who serve and obey him like a king. Lucifer himself however is mostly bored with his existence when the group known as the Demon Knights are captured by him during the early Middle Ages, and passes the time by finding small amusements, such as watching the struggles and falls of Etrigan the Demon.

Lucifer made a more physical appearance in ''[[I...Vampire]] #19'' after being tipped by [[John Constantine]] in destroying [[Cain (DC Comics)|Cain]]. Lucifer immediately sentences Cain and drags him to Hell. Though a being claiming to be him has appeared in the modern age of DC to the hero Deadman, the current whereabouts and status of Lucifer remain unknown.

==Powers and abilities==
Lucifer possesses nigh-omnipotent supernatural power; he can shape the matter of Creation into anything he can imagine, including [[matter]], [[energy]], and more abstract concepts such as [[time]].<ref>''Lucifer'' #16</ref>  However, he does have certain limitations as he is still a creation of God. He cannot create something out of nothing, unlike his father or brother. In some ways, this makes him the most disadvantaged, though not the weakest, of the archangelic host. He needs existing matter (and where that is unavailable, the Demiurgic power of the Archangel Michael) to provide the foundation for him to shape. Only his brother, the archangel Michael Demiurgos, is his equal in power and only God, his creator and father Yahweh, is his superior. However, in certain dimensions, he is powerless and his mobility is limited without his angelic wings. He may choose to temporarily abandon his powers, including his [[immortality]]. In the story titled Lilith, it is implied that God could destroy him at His own whim - which makes Lucifer sometimes wonder why He hasn't dealt with him already.
He is never without the formidable resources of his brilliant, nigh-[[Omniscience|omniscient]] intellect and his unbending will or inner strength, which allowed him to defy and confront his father, Almighty God, without fear or doubt. Although Lucifer's overt exercise of power is limited in the books, if he is provoked to violence, his preference seems to be to use fire as a weapon.  His original role was as "God's lamplighter", in which he used his will to condense clouds of [[hydrogen]] into star-masses and set them alight. As terrifying as they are brief, battles with Lucifer usually begin (and end) with him drawing down the flames of some superheated [[star]] and incinerating to ash anything in the immediate area. However, the true reasons why he favors light and fire are partially explained in the story "Lilith" (from "Lucifer: The Wolf Beneath the Tree").

Lucifer possesses the common powers appropriate to an archangel of his position; incalculable physical strength that rivals the likes of cosmic beings such as Asmodel, Eclipso and the Spectre, nigh omnipresence, invulnerability, flight, acidic blood (or, rather, he bleeds will, as depicted in when he reaches Yggdrasil in "Lucifer: The Wolf Beneath the Tree"), a devastating sonic cry, telepathy, and the power to speak to and understand animals. As an archangel, his powers are significantly superior to other angels.

In the ''New 52'' reboot, Lucifer is shown to possess power over the human soul itself. However, he has no power over animal souls. He can open and close magical portals to Earth from Hell and back again. He can use this power to either summon or banish demons, as he does with [[Etrigan the Demon|Etrigan]]. He is clairvoyant, possessing a heightened perception or knowledge of time, even to the extent of being able to know the future.

==Other versions==
* ''The Unofficial Guide to the DC Universe'' lists Lucifer as first having appeared in a dream in ''[[Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen]]'' #65 (1962).<ref name="TheUnofficial">[http://www.dcuguide.com/chronology.php?name=lucifer The Unofficial Lucifer Morningstar Chronology<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  He appears when [[Jimmy Olsen]] attempts to memorize a [[devil's food cake]] recipe with his alleged [[photographic memory]] and dreams that he is in France 300 years in the past.  Putting on the clothing of a bandit who has ditched them, Jimmy is arrested and sent to rot in [[Devil's Island]] [[Penal Colony]].  A bald man known as Lord L offers five years of freedom for people to escape in exchange for their souls.  Convinced that the magic the man uses is technological in nature, assuming him to be an ancestor of [[Lex Luthor]], he asks to be returned to from where he came, believing Lord L will be long dead by then and unable to claim him.  Lord L shows up at his front door, still bald but now with a [[goatee]], and insists that he is Lucifer and has given him over 300 years extra, but will dine with him before taking him, but disappears when Jimmy serves him cake. [[Superman]] wakes Jimmy soon after and reveals that the card he memorized was really for [[angel food cake]], and this is why Lucifer disappeared.
* In ''[[Weird Mystery Tales]]'' #4 (Jan-Feb 1973), a story by [[Jack Oleck]] and [[Ruben Yandoc]] depicts Lucifer, looking much like his present incarnation, save for a few panels in which he appeared as a more traditional [[devil]], held prisoner by an order of [[monk]]s. It also presents a prisoner switch trick not unlike the one performed in ''[[The Sandman: Season of Mists]]'', in addition to being hosted by [[Destiny (DC Comics)|Destiny]], another character later used by Gaiman. In the story, Lucifer gave Philip Burton his form in order to trade places with him and fulfill his wish for immortality. Lucifer walked away in the body of the elderly Burton.
*A character called Lucifer, The Fallen Angel appears in ''[[Blue Devil]]'' #31 (the final issue).  He has angelic wings and a halo, and his face includes dark facial hair.  He does not have horns. [[Madame Xanadu]] recognizes that even with a magic book, he is not the real Lucifer.  He is simply a washed-up actor who decides to be a costumed criminal for a living.  He is dragged into Hell on a train at the end of the issue.
*''The Unofficial Guide to the DC Universe'' lists Lucifer's first genuine [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|pre-Crisis]] appearance as ''[[DC Special Series]]'' #8.<ref name="TheUnofficial" /> This character has hair and wings like Lucifer as he appears in ''Sandman'' #4, but he is red-skinned and has a face like a traditional devil, complete with goatee, though his horns may be part of a headband.  His appearance in the comic is brief, but he is specifically referred to as "Lucifer," rather than by other epithets.  He has an advisory board consisting of [[Guy Fawkes]], [[Benedict Arnold]], [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Jack the Ripper]], [[Nero]], and [[Bluebeard]].  He has an operative, Edward Dirkes, set bombs, while using a bronze [[Batman]] statue transported by the [[Easy Company (comics)|Easy Company]] like a [[voodoo doll]].
*Writer [[Garth Ennis]] introduced a character intended to be the Devil as an antagonist in his run on the ''[[Hellblazer]]'' comic: however, as the character appeared at the same time as Gaiman's reuse of the Lucifer character, Ennis had to introduce a new back story for his character to distinguish the two: the ''Hellblazer'' character was named the [[First of the Fallen]], and was ruler of Hell prior to and after Lucifer's reign. How this fits in with the reigns of the angels and Christopher Rudd has not been clarified, although the First of the Fallen mentions Duma and Remiel ruling Hell during Ennis' run. In the Hellblazer film adaption, [[Constantine (film)|Constantine]], however Lucifer, portrayed by [[Peter Stormare]] showed up as an antagonist.
*[[Satan]] has appeared as a distinct figure in numerous DC comics.<ref>http://www.comicbookdb.com/character_chron.php?ID=15956</ref>
* In one of DC-Vertigo's ''[[Fables (comics)|Fables]]'' spinoffs, ''[[Jack of Fables]]'', the title character made various (unwise) pacts with several devils. One of them is heavily inspired by Milton's ''Paradise Lost''.

==In other media==
*Lucifer appeared in the 2005 film ''[[Constantine (film)|Constantine]]'' portrayed by [[Peter Stormare]].
*In ''[[Smallville]]'', Lucifer was one of the aliases used by [[Darkseid]] through history.<ref>Smallville Season 10 episodes 21 and 22 "Finale"</ref> Darkseid is also shown to corrupt people using the [[Seven Deadly Sins]] (associated with Lucifer/Satan and the Demons of Hell)<ref>Smallville Season 10 Episode 14 "Masquerade"</ref> Darkseid's minions offered the faithful worshipers Rapture from the oncoming [[Apokolips|apocalypse]] as opposed to salvation (as the Book of Revelation promises to the worshipers of God).
