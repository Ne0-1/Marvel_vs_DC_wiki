'''''Lucifer''''' is a [[DC Comics]] [[Character (fiction)|character]] that starred in an eponymous [[comic book]] published under the [[Vertigo Comics|Vertigo]] [[imprint]]. The series, a spin-off of [[Neil Gaiman]]'s ''[[The Sandman]]'', concerns the adventures of the [[fallen angel]] [[Lucifer|Lucifer Morningstar]] on [[Earth]], in [[Heaven]] and through other realms of creation after abandoning [[Hell]] in the ''Sandman'' series.  Lucifer also appears as a supporting character in issues of ''[[Etrigan the Demon|The Demon]]'' and other [[DC Universe]] comics.  Two angels, a human, and briefly, [[Superman]], have taken his place as ruler of Hell.

==Fictional character biography==
===Sandman continuity===
In the earlier related series ''[[The Sandman (DC Comics Modern Age)|The Sandman]]'', written by [[Neil Gaiman]], Lucifer abandoned his lordship over [[Hell]]. While Lucifer had previously appeared in various stereotypical guises in earlier DC books, Gaiman's version was unique and premised on English poet and prose writer [[John Milton|John Milton's]] ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (at his earliest appearance in the Sandman he looked extremely similar to young [[David Bowie]]). In the Sandman series, Lucifer had ruled as lord of Hell for ten billion years. Over that time, he had manipulated the various demons of Hell against each other, provided a place for dead mortals to be tormented, and led the war against Heaven. 

However, at some point during his rule, he had become bored with his existence. He became tired of the various stereotypes that mortals held of the devil, such as the idea that he purchased and traded for souls, which were largely untrue. He had become tired of his reign over Hell, and felt it an unfair punishment that he should have to rule there forever simply because he once rebelled. In the Sandman story ''[[The Sandman: Season of Mists|Season of Mists]]'', Lucifer expels all demons and damned souls from Hell before locking Hell's gates and handing over the key to Hell to [[Dream (DC Comics)|Dream of the Endless]], the title character of The Sandman series. Eventually, control of Hell was handed over to two Angels, Duma (the angel of silence) and Remiel ("set over those who rise"), while Lucifer simply retired to Earth, specifically to [[Perth, Western Australia]].

===Solo ongoing series===
In the regular series, written by [[Mike Carey]], Lucifer runs a piano bar (an element introduced in the Sandman story ''[[The Sandman: The Kindly Ones|The Kindly Ones]]'') called "Lux" in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], with the assistance of his Lilim female consort, [[Mazikeen (comics)|Mazikeen]]. Lucifer is portrayed as a sophisticated and almost charming man, according to the stereotypical gentleman-[[devil]]. Beneath his charisma, however, Lucifer is a deadly and [[Machiavellianism|Machiavellian]] character, with no regard for human life or indeed anyone or anything but himself: a proud and vindictive fallen angel who has no qualms using powers second only to those of his father, [[Yahweh]]. In fact, during the fourth book of the Sandman series, Lucifer is described as having been the wisest, most beautiful and most powerful of all the angels in heaven. Despite his [[Egotism|egotistic]] and [[narcissistic]] tendencies, he does follow something akin to a [[honor|code of honor]], refusing to lie (which he considers crass and undignified), insisting on paying back debts, and keeping his word.

As the series opened in 1999, Lucifer's "restful" retirement was disturbed by a series of associates from his past, and after various catalytic events, he endeavored to create a universe in competition with (and presumably against the wishes of) his father, [[Yahweh]]. This puts him on a collision course with several powerful mystical entities that have a vested interest in the new creation and draws the angelic host into the fray - including his brother, the archangel [[Michael Demiurgos]].

The series paralleled Sandman in several ways, with epic fantasy stories being told in arcs separated by oneshot episodes depicting a smaller, more personal tale. Unlike Sandman, the series has had a consistent art team in [[Peter Gross]] and [[Ryan Kelly]], with most of the odd issues illustrated by Dean Ormston. The title's 50th issue was penciled by [[P. Craig Russell]], homaging ''Sandman ''#50. Structurally, aside from the meeting in Hell that Lucifer arranges with angel Amenadiel in much the same way Dream did with himself in the pages of Sandman, the series follows its own path. Numerous Gods appear, with greater focus on Judeo-Christian religion (as viewed by John Milton in ''Paradise Lost''), Japanese and Nordic mythology than in Sandman. As for the Endless themselves, all but Destruction, Desire and Despair appear, but their appearances are small and very rare. 

Cover artist included [[Duncan Fegredo]], [[Christopher Moeller]] and [[Michael William Kaluta|Mike Kaluta]]. The letters are inconsistent, with the first half of the series carrying particularly established fonts of Gaudium, Michael and God only to drop almost all of them save Lucifer's towards the end with numerous changes in the letterers. 

The series ended in June [[2006]] with issue #75 and has thus far been collected in eleven books, with a standalone story (''Lucifer: Nirvana'') published as a smaller [[graphic novel]]. The series' parent title, ''The Sandman'', also ran for 75 issues.

==Powers and abilities==
Lucifer possesses incalculable power, he can shape the stuff of creation into anything he can imagine including matter, energy, and more abstract concepts such as time.  However, he cannot create out of nothing.  He needs the demiurgic power of Michael to provide the foundation for him to shape.  Only his brother Michael is his equal in power, and only God is superior to both of them. However, in certain dimensions he is powerless and much of his power depends on having his wings.  Lucifer is also a master manipulator, and regularly likes to use his mind instead of his powers.

==Earlier versions of Lucifer in DC Comics==
*In ''[[Weird Mystery Tales]]'' #4 (Jan-Feb 1973), a story by [[Jack Oleck]] and [[Rubeny]] depicts Lucifer, looking much like his present incarnation, save for a few panels in which he appeared as a more traditional [[devil]], held prisoner by an order of [[monk]]s. It also presents a prisoner switch trick not unlike the one performed in ''[[The Sandman: Season of Mists]]'', in addition to being hosted by [[Destiny (DC Comics)|Destiny]]. This story may or may not be considered in continuity, or have been an influence on Gaiman and Carey. In the story, Lucifer gave Philip Burton his form in order to trade places with him and fulfill his wish for immortality. Lucifer walked away in the body of the elderly Burton.

*The Unofficial Guide to the DC Universe lists Lucifer as first having appeared in a dream in ''[[Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen (comic)|Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen]]'' #65 and first genuine [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|pre-Crisis]] appearance as ''[[DC Special Series]]'' #8 (''[[The Brave and the Bold]] Special'' Starring [[Batman]], [[Deadman]] and [[Sgt. Rock]]).<ref>http://www.dcuguide.com/chronology.php?name=lucifer</ref>  The latter figure has hair like Lucifer as he appears in ''Sandman'' #4, but he is red-skinned and has a face like  a traditional devil, complete with goatee, though his horns may be part of a headband.  His wings are typically demonic-looking rather than the angelic wings of the Vertigo character.  His appearance in the comic is brief, but he is specifically referred to as "Lucifer," rather than by other epithets.
