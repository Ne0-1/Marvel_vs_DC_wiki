'''''Lucifer''''' is a [[comic book]] published by [[Vertigo (publisher)|Vertigo Comics]], an imprint of [[DC Comics]].  The series concerns the adventures on Earth of the fallen angel, [[Lucifer|Lucifer Morningstar]], who had abandoned his lordship over [[Hell]] earlier in the separate series ''[[The Sandman (DC Comics Modern Age)|The Sandman]]''.  Lucifer is also the name of the character in that series.

Written by [[Mike Carey]], Lucifer improbably runs a piano bar called "Lux" in [[Los Angeles]] with the assistance of his sinister female cohort, [[Mazikeen]]. Lucifer is portrayed as sophisticated and almost charming, rather than the stereotypical [[devil]]. Beneath this veneer, however, Lucifer is portrayed as a deadly and [[Machiavelli]]an character, with no regard for human life or indeed anyone aside from himself: a proud and vindictive fallen angel who has no qualms in using powers which are second only to those of [[God]]. 

Lucifer's "blissful" retirement is disturbed by a series of associates from his past, and after a certain triggering events he sets out to create a universe in competition to (and against the wishes of) God. 

The series, as of April [[2003]], has yet to be completed, and has thus far been collected in four anthologies, with a separate story (''Lucifer: Nirvana'') published as a [[graphic novel]].

The book is heavily influenced by ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' by [[John Milton]].
