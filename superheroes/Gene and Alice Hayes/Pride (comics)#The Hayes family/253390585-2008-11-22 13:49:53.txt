'''The Pride''' is a [[fictional]] [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain]] team of twelve people, a criminal organization that controlled the [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] area of the [[Marvel Universe]].<ref name="comicvine">[http://67.205.100.17/pride/65-40890/ The Pride]</ref> The Pride consists of twelve people (six couples); the mob boss '''Wilders''', the time-travelling '''Yorkes''', the unwanted mutant '''Hayeses''', the alien invader '''Deans''', the mad scientist '''Steins''' and the dark wizard '''Minorus'''.<ref name="comicvine"/> The Pride was often considered to be an efficient super-villain team, that barred other villains from controlling Los Angeles. Although the real world did not know of The Pride's existence, other mafia mob bosses controllers had, such as the [[Kingpin (comics)|the Kingpin]], who admits the group ran Los Angeles with efficiency and vision.<ref name="Vol2#25">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #25</ref> The Pride had originally debuted in ''[[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]] #1'', published by [[Marvel Comics]] in 2003, and were created by [[Brian K. Vaughan]] and [[Adrian Alphona]].<ref name="Vol1#1">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #1</ref>

==Origin==
The six couples were called together in 1985 by the [[Gibborim (comics)|Gibborim]], three mythical giants who had ruled the world when it had "originally been one, serene utopia".<ref name="Vol1#13">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #13</ref> The Gibborim informed the couples (who revealed themselves to be aliens, time-travellers, magicians, scientists, mutants, and criminals) they desired the wish to turn the world into the same peaceful utopia it had been millions of years before, but did not have the strength.<ref name="Vol1#13"/> The Gibborim required the six couples' help ("a Pride") to wipe out the entire [[planet]], and when they achieved their goal, six of the twelve who served them the best would be able to rule the world with them, while the other six would perish with the rest of the human race.<ref name="Vol1#13"/> The couples agreed, and formed The Pride. For 25 years the Gibborim had given The Pride wealth and had their powers enhanced so that they could rule over the entire Los Angeles.<ref name="Vol1#13"/> Every year, The Pride gathered at the Wilder residence, using the excuse of an "annual charity fundraiser", while in reality, they would perform the "Rite of Blood", a ritual sacrifice of an innocent young female victim;<ref name="Vol1#1"/> the spirit of the victim would then be fed to the Gibborim in the "Rite of Thunder".<ref name="Vol1#14">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #14</ref> 

After Janet Stein became pregnant during their third year as The Pride, The Pride agreed to end its struggle against one another. Each couple would instead ensure their child would receive one of the six places in the coming paradise, so The Pride's legacy could go on.<ref name="Vol1#13"/> Unbeknownst to the rest of The Pride, the alien Deans and mutant Hayeses had made a deal; to murder the rest of The Pride and take the six tickets in paradise for themselves and their daughters, [[Karolina Dean]] and [[Molly Hayes]].<ref name="Vol1#14"/>

==Recent activities==
Seventeen years later, The Pride's children see "the Rite of Blood" and run away.<ref name="Vol1#1"/> With assistance of LAPD Lieutenant Flores, their parents frame their children for the murder of the innocent girl who served as their most recent sacrifice.<ref name="Vol1#1"/> A note left at the Deans' house reveals that one of the Runaways is secretly loyal to the Pride.<ref name="Vol1#6">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #6</ref> Due to an attack on their children by the [[vampire]] Topher, The Pride tracked down and killed Topher's lackeys.<ref name="Vol1#10">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #10</ref> In the process, The Pride learns that their children have defeated the vampire themselves.<ref name="Vol1#10"/> The mole within the Runaways tips off the Pride to their involvement with [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]].<ref name="Vol1#12">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #12</ref> 

During a ceremony at the "Rite of Thunder",<ref name="Vol1#14"/> Alex Wilder manipulates his teammates into defeat and reveals himself as the mole. He learned of The Pride a year ago; he also discovered the Deans' and Hayes' betrayal.<ref name="Vol1#17">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #17</ref> Alex manipulated the Runaways as a way to save his parents and rule paradise with [[Nico Minoru]], offering the remaining two places to her parents.<ref name="Vol1#17"/> Molly destroys the container carrying the girl's soul, the Gibborim destroy Alex, and the undersea lair in which they offer the soul collapses, trapping The Pride inside, though the children manage to escape.<ref name="Vol1#17"/> The Pride was presumed dead.<ref name="Vol1#18">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #18</ref>

==Members==
===Original members===
Despite the Pride's allegiance to one another, rifts and alliances had been common amongst the group; indeed, the most notable of the alliance was the Hayes and Deans, who had plotted to beat the other remaining Pride members because they were human. All members of the Pride are given nicknames by the Gibborim.<ref>The Gibborim have given them nicknames while taking them away from their places, and when they had introduced one another.</ref> 

====The Wilders====
'''[[Geoffrey Wilder|Geoffrey]]''' and '''Catherine Wilder''' ("the Thieves") are [[Alex Wilder]]'s parents. They are crime bosses who posed as business people. They handled [[illegal drug trade]], [[gambling]] and [[robbing]] in Los Angeles. For this, these two established strong and powerful connections throughout the Los Angeles, a reason the Pride is able to frame their kids for murder and kidnap. Geoffrey had led the entire Pride.<ref name="Vol1#17">[http://runaways.mergingminds.org/showarticle.asp?section=10&fldAuto=410 Runaways: Vol. 1, #17]</ref> Geoffrey originally appeared as a stern, demeaning man, who had forbade his son from playing online roleplaying games.<ref name="Vol1#1"/> His cool persona is often distinguished, meaning other characters can detect his attitude, as evidenced when Nico is able to identify a 1985 version of Geoffrey. When the Gibborim had called them to the first meeting, Geoffrey and Catherine had been on the run from the cops, after a fresh robbery,<ref name="Vol1#13"/> where it was revealed that Geoffrey and Catherine had [[elope]]d, defying Catherine's mother's wishes.<ref name="Vol1#13"/> Originally appearing as average parents, it is shown the two can also have short tempers; when one of the Pride's agents informed Geoffrey that their children had run away, Geoffrey carried a dagger to Alex's room; Catherine later shot the same agent in the knee.<ref name="Vol1#10">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #10</ref> 

Geoffrey Wilder later returns, after a group unintentionally brings a 1985 version of him back from his time.<ref name="Vol2#14">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #14</ref> He was later defeated, and returned to his time with his memory wiped by Nico.<ref name="Vol2#18">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #18</ref> 

====The Yorkes====
'''Dale''' and '''Stacey Yorkes''' ("the Travelers") are [[Gertrude Yorkes]]'s parents. They are [[time travel]]ers who posed as [[antique]] dealers. The two, using a special 4-D portico, traveled all over time, and had stolen a dinosaur, mentally linking it with their daughter.<ref name="Vol1#17"/> They had lived in the 87th century.<ref name="Vol1#17"/> When the Gibborim had called them to the first meeting, Dale and Stacey had accidentally landed in 1985, where Stacey quotes was "the worst decade of the century".<ref name="Vol1#13"/> They believed the Gibborim would make a better world, one that wasn't full of [[superhero]]es who had foiled their plans in the past (and presumably the future).<ref name="Vol1#17"/><ref name="IGNReview#30">[http://comics.ign.com/articles/884/884477p1.html Whedon's run finally ends.]</ref> The two have a distinct way of speech (unlike the rest of the Pride, they have older-fashioned speech),<ref name="Vol1#6"/> and often imply they know what will go on in the future.<ref name="Vol2#27">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #27</ref> They dress in pilot styles in that of [[Amelia Earhart]], complete with the goggles, scarves, and gloves. It was later revealed their outfits were actually technical advances, where their gloves cause fire and restraining shields.<ref name="Vol2#28">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #28</ref><ref name="Vol2#29">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #29</ref> The Yorkes appear as self-righteous, obnoxious people, particularly Stacey.<ref name="Vol2#28"/> Gert had had a strong dislike to her parents because of an incident involving Gert's pet pig the Yorkes hated; after Gert had been playing with it, she had briefly left to answer the phone, and when she returned, she found it had been gone, and suspected her parents for the crime.<ref name="Vol1#3">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #3</ref>

When the runaways are time-displaced in 1907, it was revealed the runaways had landed in a time the Yorkes were visiting, where the Yorkes are the heads of a super powered street gang known as the Sinners.<ref name="Vol2#27"/> When Chase reveals Gert is dead to Dale, he snaps, prompting him to almost assault Chase with his fiery gloves.<ref name="Vol2#28"/> Later on, Dale reveals the Yorkes have several kingdoms through time, and plan on destroying all of 1907 New York in honour for their daughter. Nico stops them with her most complex spell yet, revealing a painful secret about the Yorkes: the Yorkes would remember everything about their daughter's death, their upcoming deaths, and wouldn't be able to change the future or say anything that would.<ref name="Vol2#30">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #30</ref>

====The Deans====
'''Frank''' and '''Leslie Dean''' ("the Colonists") are [[Karolina Dean]]'s parents. They are alien invaders from Majesdane, the homeworld of their race, who posed as Hollywood actors. The Deans are intergalactic arms traders to the [[Skrull]]s.<ref name="Vol1#5">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #5</ref> In their alien form, they appear humanoid with bright, wispy skin, and can manipulate and control solar energy for a variety of purposes.<ref name="Vol1#5"/> When the Gibborim had called the Deans for the first meeting, the Deans were on a Hollywood set for their show, ''[[General Hospital]]''.<ref name="Vol1#13"/> The two had inhibited Karolina's alien powers for most of her life because of a medical alert bracelet that was forged from far-distant metal, telling her she had an allergy to penicillin.<ref name="Vol1#17"/> Frank had included Karolina in his will with a paper instructing her to take off the bracelet, but Karolina had discovered the will early.<ref name="Vol1#3"/> Frank and Leslie had originally appeared as a happy, smiling couple that complimented Karolina's special fajitas, but as issues went on, it was shown the two would have violent and warlike tempers; when the runaways battle their parents over Molly Hayes, Leslie appears rather viciously, returning every time she was knocked out;<ref name="Vol1#6"/> when Frank arrived from New York and discovered his daughter had already left home and discovered her powers, he had violently attacked Victor Stein roaring for his daughter.<ref name="Vol1#7">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #7</ref> The Deans also were the only ones that didn't want a child.<ref name="Vol1#13"/> The Deans had conspired with the Hayes's to kill the rest of the Pride and take the six tickets in paradise for them, their daughter, and the three Hayeses.<ref name="Vol1#16">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #16</ref> 

When on the run, Karolina meets Xavin, an alien, and more of the Deans are revealed: the Deans had actually been exiled from their planet for criminal activities; the two immigrated to Earth were they took their last name from a memorial of [[James Dean]].<ref name="Vol1#18">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #18</ref> When Prince De'zean of the [[Skrulls]] (aliens) had arrived at Earth to conquer it, Frank and Leslie had stopped him. In exchange, the two gave the Skrulls the coordinates of a much more valuable planet: ''Majesdane'', the Deans' birth planet, which was hidden beneath a [[white dwarf]] star.<ref name="Vol2#8">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #8</ref> To assure the Skrulls the coordinates were real, the Deans offered the Prince their daughter's hand in marriage; therefore, Karolina was engaged to the son of the Prince, Xavin.<ref name="Vol2#8"/> The Skrulls then left to destroy Majesdane, culminating in a fifteen year war.<ref name="Vol2#8"/> The Deans had privately believed that Xavin would die in the war, and wouldn't expect him to survive to come and collect the marriage agreement.<ref name="Vol2#8"/> More recently, Karolina had a dream involving both her parents; in a split image, Leslie pulled Karolina to Earth, while Frank pulled Karolina to a milky ball that was Majesdane.<ref name="Vol2#23">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #23</ref>

It was later revealed by the Majesdanian soldier, vaDanti, that it was specifically Frank Dean who told the Skrulls where Majesdane was hidden.<ref name="Vol3#2">''Runaways'': Volume 3, #2</ref>

====The Steins====
'''Victor''' and '''Janet Stein''' ("the Wise Men") are [[Chase Stein]]'s parents. They are world-renown brilliant inventors, are known for making fortunes for what people believe are neccesities.<ref>They supposedly made a fortune from creating a tool that removes the annoying plastic wrapping easily from a CD.</ref> They also made "weaponized" gloves called Fistigons, multi-spectral goggles and the transport ship "the Leapfrog".<ref name="Vol1#17"/> When the Gibborim had called them for the first meeting, the Steins were in their laboratory. At the back of the Stein home is their workshop, which appears as a small shed. When entered, the space is equal to that of a large cave.<ref name="Vol1#4">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #4</ref> The Steins are also responsible for the money the Pride obtains, as Victor revealed he and Janet had counterfeited the new fifty within two minutes.<ref name="Vol1#14">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #14</ref> The Steins have also created watches that zap electricity, watches that scan police radars and senses, creating the container that carries the soul they sacrifice they dress in scientific outfits for their villainous costumes.<ref name="Vol1#1"/> Janet Stein's pregnancy is the reason the remaining Pride wished to have children, and started the idea of offering their place to a child.<ref name="Vol1#13"/> Victor is the one parent often described as being the most abusive,<ref name="Vol2#24">[http://runaways.mergingminds.org/showarticle.asp?section=10&fldAuto=376 Runaways: Vol. 1, #17]</ref> as he first appears punching Chase across the face for getting C's, with Janet scolding slightly.<ref name="Vol1#1"/> A remark from Chase implies that his father regularly beats him.<ref name="Vol1#4"/> Chase later quotes his parents often argue.<ref name="Vol1#6"/> On the night of the Rite of Thunder, Victor tells Geoffrey that he really loves his son,<ref name="Vol1#14"/> and Janet later reveals she admits she doesn't know how her soul is, because of the murders.<ref name="Vol1#17"/>

When Chase receives an opportunity to get Gert back to life, he immediately agrees to take it: sacrifice an innocent life and Gert would be alive.<ref name="Vol2#24">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #24</ref> Chase agrees to the deal and wishes to sacrifice himself, because he had realized he was innocent; Victor would often abuse Chase when he was young, hitting him with a burbank [[phone book]], which Chase quotes as "strong enough to hurt but not leave any marks".<ref name="Vol2#24"/> Janet would then put on the radio, so she wouldn't hear her son crying downstairs.<ref name="Vol2#24"/> Victor would hurt him for getting a D in Algebra, a parking ticket, or even if he was just having a bad day.<ref name="Vol2#24"/> Chase had never thought of them as good excuses, so he had begun to make up his own, and even believe them, until he realized that he was entirely innocent.<ref name="Vol2#24"/>

====The Hayeses====
'''Gene''' and '''Alice Hayes''' ("the Outcasts") are [[Molly Hayes]]'s parents. The two are telepathic [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutants]] who posed as a doctor<ref name="Vol1#1"/> and a speech therapist.<ref name="Vol1#11">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #11</ref> Gene first appears as a very awkward man, unwilling to talk about his daughter's puberty. Alice is described a strong and caring mother, but still able to offer up her own daughter as a ransom to capture the five other runaways.<ref name="Vol1#5"/> When the Gibborim had called the Hayeses for the first meeting, Gene and Alice had been getting harassed by the neighbours, who had thrown rocks at them for being mutants.<ref name="Vol1#13"/> Just before a furious Gene was about to protect a whimpering Alice, the two had been called forth by the Gibborim. This led to the Hayes's strong hatred towards humans, a reason they were willing to conspire with the Deans to kill the human members of the Pride and ensure the six tickets in paradise for themselves, Molly, and the three Deans.<ref name="Vol1#16"/> It was revealed early on that the Hayeses had no idea Molly was a mutant herself, but when Molly's supposed puberty was actually her mutant genes kicking in, the Hayeses were shocked.<ref name="Vol1#7"/> The two can telepathically remove all memory and [[Sedation|sedate]] people, but this has backfired on one occasion; when they had wiped [[Cloak and Dagger|Cloak]]'s memory of ever encountering the runaways, Cloak and Dagger travelled back to New York, where after receiving a blow to the head, Cloak remembered.<ref name="Vol1#17"/>

Molly had difficulty in believing her parents were villains for two main reasons; because of her age, and her strong empowering belief her parents were actually innocent people.<ref name="Vol1#18"/> After Molly had escaped a villain named "the Provost", Molly rescued several other runaway children who had thought their parents villains and offered them a place on the team;<ref name="Vol2#14">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #14</ref> when they rejected and said they would go to their families, Molly later had a dream of her parents appearing in a dream, reminding her they would still be going to [[Disney Land]], and Molly admitting to her dream-mother that her whole experience as a runaway was a horrible nightmare.<ref name="Vol2#14">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #14</ref> The dream-Alice comforts Molly by telling her it was nothing but a dream, and not to worry, because she's home.<ref name="Vol2#14"/>

====The Minorus====
'''Robert''' and '''Tina Minoru''' ("the Magicians") are [[Nico Minoru]]'s parents. The two are dark [[Wizard (fantasy)|wizards]] who posed as an average, church-going, [[middle-class]] couple.<ref name="Vol1#16">''Runaways'': Vol. 1, #16</ref><ref name="Vol1#1"/> The two are the least-liked by the Pride; in a holograph, it's revealed the Steins and Yorkes consider them as unstable because they're magicians;<ref name="Vol2#26">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #26</ref> the Deans and Hayeses hate them because they're humans;<ref name="Vol1#16"/> Geoffrey Wilder also critices Robert on one occasion.<ref name="Vol1#2">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #2"</ref> When the Gibborim had first abducted the Pride for the first meeting, the Minorus were on their wedding day.<ref name="Vol1#17"/> Arriving in the Gibborim's chamber with the rest of the Pride, the two quickened unleash a blackhole of bats at the Pride.<ref name="Vol1#13"/> In their first appearance, the two appear as an average couple, where Robert is unwilling to be late, and Tina is an ''[[Oprah]]'' fan.<ref name="Vol1#1"/> In the Rite of Blood, Robert conducts the enchanted spell of sacrifice.<ref name="Vol1#17"/> When the runaways witness the Rite of Blood, they see that Robert conducts the enchanted spell of sacrifice.<ref name="Vol1#17"/> The runaways see the Minoru's in action when they get ambushed at the Stein's laboratory; Tina conducts her powers using a mystical Staff known as the "Staff of One", and Robert conducts his powers through a spellbook.<ref name="Vol1#4"/> Tina attempted to stab Nico with her Staff, but the Staff was absorbed by Nico, who kept it.<ref name="Vol1#3"/> In the final battle with the Pride at the Marine Vivarium, Nico ignored the Wilders' and her parents' wishes to rule in the new world. Regardless, Tina screamed at Nico to run while she and Robert held back the Gibborim, a reason the runaways were able to flee to safety.<ref name="Vol1#17"/>

Robert and Tina later appear in a dream Nico has, where the two criticize Nico and call her a slut for kissing Alex, Chase, Topher, and Victor.<ref name="Vol2#24"/> Nico then overcomes her previous insecurities by destroying her parents in her dream by screaming a spell, "and I liked you better dead!"<ref name="Vol2#24"/>

=="The New Pride"==
At the end of issue 6 in the second series, a figure who had impersonated [[Chamber (comics)|Chamber]] from the [[X-Men]], is implied to be a resurrected Alex Wilder,<ref name="Vol2#6">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #6</ref> and has formed a new Pride using some of the original team's tools, including the Minoru's Chameleon Glamour, a small talismen to disguise the user into any form.<ref name="Vol2#6"/> They had later used the Minoru's Eye-Spy Cauldron to spy on the Runaways, who had left from New York City and were returning to Los Angeles.<ref name="Vol2#12">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #12</ref> They had also obtained the Stein's copy of the abstract.<ref name="Vol2#12"/> It was later revealed that they were a group of Alex's former online friends on a role-playing game; '''Stretch''', an overweight boy who lives with his grandmother (had roleplayed as several female and scantily clad superheroes such has [[Emma Frost]], [[Ms Marvel]], and the [[Invisible Woman]]), '''Hunter''', a thin young man with a stereotypical [[slacker]] appearance (had roleplayed as the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]), '''Lotus''', a female [[fantasy]] fan who participates in [[Renaissance Fair]]s (had roleplayed as [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]) and '''Oscar''', a man who often was fired from many jobs because of using the computers for online games (had roleplayed as [[Spider-Man]]).<ref name="Vol1#1"/><ref name="Vol2#13">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #13</ref>

It was later revealed they were "the new Pride". Hunter hacked into Alex's game account, and through that eventually found his computer's journal, and learned about the Pride. After Alex's death, the friends find certain items from the Pride in an attempt to bring back Alex, but end up killing Oscar, and bringing back a younger version of Alex's father, Geoffrey, from a time period of one year after joining the Pride. Geoffrey then lied to the new Pride acting as the "good guy" and saying that the Runaways killed Alex. Ironically, the new Pride formed because Alex's friends claimed that they wanted to become more "responsible members of society", and begin acting like adults. The Runaways' philosophy states that no adults are to be trusted.

Geoffrey Wilder murders [[Gertrude Yorkes]] as part of a sacrificial ritual, but he is captured and returned to his own time (with his memory erased in the process). The new Pride disbands after the Runaways reveal Geoffrey Wilder's true goal. Following Gert's death, ''Stretch'' checks himself into a [[Psychiatric hospital|mental health facility]], and ''Hunter'' joins the [[Peace Corps]] to atone for the "blood" on his hands. ''Lotus'' is kidnapped (or, as she puts it, "hired") by [[Chase Stein]] to help him resurrect Gert. When the attempt fails, Chase releases Lotus, telling her to burn her copy of the Abstract.

==Former agents==
*'''Lieutenant Flores''' of the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]]. Shot in the leg by Catherine Wilder for bringing Cloak and Dagger to L.A. and then killed by Geoffrey Wilder after he failed to capture the children.
*'''Alex Wilder''', revealed to be a spy for his parents and the rest of the Pride. Killed by the Gibborim.

==Other versions==
===House of M===
The Pride is mentioned as ruling Southern California in the House of M reality warp.  Unlike mainstream reality, their children stay with their parents.<ref>''House of M: Avengers'' #4</ref>
