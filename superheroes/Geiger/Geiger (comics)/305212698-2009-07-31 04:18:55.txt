==Powers and abilities==
Due to a Gamma radition accident, Geiger has the ability to mimic the powers of any gamma-powered beings in her immediate vicinity, potentially making her as strong as the Hulk, as intelligent as the Leader, etc.  However, she has little control over these powers, a downside exacerbated by the fact that she also takes on personality aspects of whoever she is mimicking as well.
