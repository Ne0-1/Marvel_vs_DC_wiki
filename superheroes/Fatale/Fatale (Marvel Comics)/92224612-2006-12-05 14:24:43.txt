'''Fatale''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. She is an assassin, usually working for [[Dark Beast]]. She first appeared in ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' #112, but in ''[[X-Men]]'' volume 2 #49 it was revealed that Pamela Greenwood, a waitress who had appeared two years before in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #299, was in fact Fatale in disguise.

==Character biography==
Little is known about Fatale's youth and how she came to be [[Dark Beast]]'s most trusted servant. It is possible that Dark Beast created her himself. When Dark Beast became interested in the [[X-Men|X-Man]] [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]], he placed Fatale undercover as a waitress in '''Harry's Hideaway''', a  bar the X-Men often visited. Fatale somehow scanned Bishop's mind to find his ideal woman and changed her appearance to match this image. She took the name ''Pamela Greenwood'', but she failed to get any closer to Bishop. Bishop noticed something familiar about Pamela, but never pursued his interest in her. 

Several months later, [[Havok]] was losing control of his powers. Dark Beast ordered Fatale to kidnap Havok so that he could [[Brainwashing|brainwash]] him. Fatale took the appearance of ''Scarlet McKenzie'', a woman Havok had known and loved, but who had died years before. Intrigued by Scarlet's reappearance, Havok left his team, [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] to investigate, but he was captured by Fatale. X-Factor and their ally [[Yukio (comics)|Yukio]] defeated Fatale and freed Havok. A second attempt by Dark Beast, using [[Random (comics)|Random]] succeeded, and Fatale brought Havok to Dark Beast.

After his visit to the [[Age of Apocalypse]], Bishop began having nightmares. He felt that Pamela Greenwood was somehow connected and went to her apartment to question her. Pamela revealed herself as Fatale and fought Bishop, but Dark Beast, monitoring the fight, called her off when [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] entered the fight. Seeing a new opportunity to infiltrate the X-Men, Dark Beast kidnapped Beast and took his place. When [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] attacked the X-Men, Dark Beast revealed himself and offered his services to Onslaught. Dark Beast, Random, Fatale and a brainwashed Havok formed the '''Dark Descendants''' and fought X-Factor, but were defeated. Havok and Random escaped, but Dark Beast and Fatale were sent to prison. 

Havok decided that Dark Beast's experiments might still be going on and he allied himself with the telepath/teleporter '''Ever''' and formed a new incarnation of the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], simply called '''The Brotherhood'''. Havok freed Fatale and Dark Beast from prison, telling them that he chose Fatale over Ever and that he wanted both of them to join his Brotherhood. Both agreed, but Havok disbanded the group several weeks later when he discovered Dark Beast's hidden lab. Fatale sided with Dark Beast, but was defeated by Havok.

Fatale was depowered during [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]] as confirmed in [[Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] #18.

==Powers and abilities==
Fatale had several superhuman powers: she could bend light around her, altering her appearance and even turn invisible this way. She was also a powerful teleporter, capable of teleporting large objects or groups of people across the world. She lost these powers following M-Day, but even without her powers Fatale remains a threat; Fatale is a skilled martial artist and often uses a poisonous blade or advanced firearms. Yukio identified Fatale's fighting style as ''Ghost Tiger Style''. Fatale is also a skilled [[forgery|forger]].
