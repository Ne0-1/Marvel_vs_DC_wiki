'''Gertrude Yorkes''', also known as '''Arsenic''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel universe]], a member of the team of young superheroes known as the [[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]]. Her first appearance was in ''Runaways'' (first series) #1.

==Fictional character biography==
'''Gertrude Yorkes''' was a smart, frank, slightly overweight, and sarcastic young woman.  She had [[socialist]] leanings, and wanted to be a [[senator]] until her experiences as a Runaway soured her towards adults in positions of power. Although ethnically [[Jewish]], Gert was an [[agnostic]].  She knew a little [[Hebrew (language)|Hebrew]], presumably as a result of a Jewish education.  

Gert was the only Runaway not shocked by the revelation that her parents were members of the secret [[super-villain]] organization known as the [[Pride (comics)|The Pride]]<ref>Runaways (first series) #1</ref>.  At an early age Gert became convinced that her parents were secretly evil; she believed they were responsible for the disappearance of her first pet, a [[pot-bellied pig]] named [[Orwell]]. 

Gert first suggested that the team members take codenames, and she stuck to hers, Arsenic, longer than the others. Gert rejected her given name for some time, wishing to shed her parents' influence completely.  However, she finally conceded that "some things" they gave her were actually worth keeping.

===Old Lace===
At the beginning of the series Gert inherited a genetically engineered [[dinosaur]] that she named [[Old Lace (comics)|Old Lace]].  ([[Arsenic and Old Lace]] is a well known play and film.)  Victor later explains to Gert that Old Lace is not a [[Velociraptor]] but actually a [[Deinonychus]].  

Gert saw Old Lace as more than a pet, which was likely a result of their psychic bond; when one is injured, the other feels pain.  Old Lace was unconditionally loyal to Gert, even to the point of fighting against the team when Gert ordered her to follow Alex's commands. Old Lace once lashed out without Gert's orders when she grew upset with Nico; the dinosaur attacked her as an apparent experssion of Gert's emotions. Also, despite her fiercesome appearance, she is often drawn with exaggerated expressions, making her appear, surprisingly, cute.

===Relationship with Chase===
Gert was in love with [[Chase Stein]]<ref>Runaways (first series) #16</ref>; the two had their first kiss after Gert performed [[CPR]] on him, saving his life after a near drowning. Chase declared her to be "the hottest chick [he's] ever seen."  Gert's relationship with Chase softened her somewhat, though she didn't entirely lose her sarcastic edge. Their relationship developed quickly, with a few off-hand comments suggesting that they shared the same bed and were sexually intimate.  

However, their relationship was threatened when Gert learned that Nico had kissed Chase in a moment of passion. Though Chase rebuffed Nico's advances, Gert was still hurt that Chase had kept the interaction hidden from her. She revealed her insecurity about her appearance (having feared that Chase would eventually leave her for a more conventionally pretty girl) and told him their relationship was over.

{{spoiler}}
However, Gert proved to Chase that she still loved him when she died in his place at the hand of [[Geoffrey Wilder]].  

Chase, in an attempt to rescue [[Nico Minoru|Nico]], [[Molly Hayes|Molly]], and [[Xavin]] from a burning building, was captured by Geoff, whose aim is to sacrifice him to the Gibborim.  Geoff was interrupted by Gert, who informed Geoff that Chase would not qualify as the "pure" sacrifice he requires. Deducing that Gert was right, Geoff decides to kill her instead and threw his knife into her stomach, mortally wounding her.  Now weaponless, Geoff offered Chase the chance to join him, asking that he help drag Gert's body over to the sacrificial zone. Refusing, Chase knocked him out with one punch. With her last breaths, Gert assured Chase that she really did love him, and that her harsh words about him were lies intended to protect him.  

Before dying Gert transferred Old Lace's psychic link to Chase.

==Alternate Future: Heroine and Victor==
An alternate future version of Gert, calling herself '''Heroine''' and a member of the Avengers, shows up to warn the Runaways<ref>Runaways (second series) #1</ref>.  In this timeline, the character survives to adulthood and becomes the leader of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] under the codename '''Heroine'''. She uses her parents' time machine to warn the Runaways about [[Victor Mancha]], who will one day become the deadly super-villain Victorious. After delivering the warning, Gert dies in Chase's arms from internal injuries. Despite the knowledge that Victor will kill her in a possible future, Gert shows him no hostility: she believes that the future is not set, and Victor has the power to shape his own destiny. Since this episode Victor has shown himself to be Gert's intellectual equal, earning her respect (although she enjoyed placing paperclips on his face while he was asleep). This friendship played on Chase's insecurities about their relationship, despite Gert's assurances.
