'''Gertrude Yorkes''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe, a member of the team of young superheroes known as the [[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]]. Her first appearance was in Runaways (vol. 1) #1.

==Character History==

'''Gertrude Yorkes''' is an incredibly smart and clever individual, and is very frank and sarcastic when addressing others. Gert has socialist leanings, and wanted to be a [[senator]] before her experiences as a Runaway soured her to adults in positions of power. Gert was the only Runaway not shocked by the revelation that her parents were members of the secret [[super-villain]] organization known as the [[Pride_%28comics%29|The Pride]]; she was convinced her parents were secretly evil at a young age, for she believed they were responsible for the disappearance of her first pet, a potbelly [[pig]] named [[Orwell]]. 

At the beginning of the series she inherits a genetically engineered [[dinosaur]] (whom she dubs Old Lace) from her time-traveling, warlord parents. Gert sees Old Lace as more than a pet, which is likely a result of their psychic bond; when one is injured, the other feels pain.

Her codename ''Arsenic'' is a reference to the classic [[Arsenic and Old Lace (play)|play]] and [[Arsenic and Old Lace (film)|film]]. Gert was the Runaway who first suggested taking codenames, and she sticks to hers longer than the others. Gert at first rejects her given name, wishing to shed her parents' influence completely, but finally concedes that "some things" they gave her are worth keeping. 

Gert considers herself to be [[agnostic]], though she is ethnically [[Jewish]]. She is presented as knowing a little [[Hebrew (language)|Hebrew]], presumably as a result of a Jewish education. 

She is currently dating [[Chase Stein]]; the two had their first kiss after Gert performed [[CPR]] on him, saving his life after a near drowning. Chase declared her to be "the hottest chick [he's] ever seen." Despite their differences, the two are very much in love. In fact, her relationship with Chase has softened her somewhat; while she hasn't lost her sarcastic edge, she often acts as the team's voice of reason, and [[Molly Hayes]] often looks to her as a big sister.

In issue #1 of the second series we meet a future version of Gert; in one Marvel universe timeline she becomes the leader of the [[Avengers]] under the codename '''Heroine'''. She uses her parents' time machine to warn the Runaways of [[Victor Mancha]], who will one day become the deadly super-villain Victorious. She then dies in Chase's arms from internal injuries.

During the Runaways' attempt to bring Victor to the Hostel, he explains to Gert that Old Lace is not a [[Velociraptor]] but actually a [[Deinonychus]]. Despite the fact that he will kill her in one possible future, Gert hasn't shown any hostility towards the young, innocent Victor, mainly because she believes that the future is not set, and Victor has the power to shape his own destiny. Victor has shown himself to be Gert's intellectual equal, which bothers Chase; despite Gert's assurances that she loves only him, Chase fears that there may be an attraction brewing between Victor and Gert.

Gert has also mentioned being highly allergic to bees, and was aware of [[Karolina Dean]]'s [[homosexuality]] before she officially came out of the closet.
