'''Ultra the Multi-Alien''' was a science fiction superhero featured in comics published by [[DC Comics]].  He first appeared in ''[[Mystery in Space]]'' #103 (1965), pushing out [[Adam Strange]] and [[Space Ranger]] from that title.  He was created by writer Dave Wood and artist [[Lee Elias]].

==Fictional character biography==
Ultra was originally Earth spaceman Ace Arn, living in an unspecified future era when spaceflight was common place. Crashing on a world in another star system, he was attacked by four aliens from different planets, each of who shot him with a ray gun to try to turn him into one of them.  Because all hit him at the same time, he was changed to have one quarter of his body resemble the four aliens. The upper right of his body was green, hairy, and strong.  The upper left was blue and had magnetic powers.  His right leg was like a bird's, with a small wing that enabled him to fly. His left leg was a bolt of lightning.

He combined the first letter of the worlds the four aliens were from, along with the first letter of his name to come up with: U-L-T-R-A, his new name. He soon found a device to convert back to human form, to make it easier to move in society. His series lasted until issue #110 (1966), when ''Mystery in Space'' was cancelled.  He would not reappear for several years. 

===Post-Crisis===
Ultra was one of [[Wizard Magazine]]'s "Mort of the Month", a featurette showcasing comic characters considered low-quality. [[Grant Morrison]] used him both in his run in [[Animal Man]] (in issue #25 Ultra and other pre-''Crisis'' characters appear in comic book limbo) and in the [[Aztek (comics)|Aztek]] limited series (though not shown, Ultra makes two appearances).

The character appeared in ''[[Starman (Jack Knight)|Starman]]'' #55 (1999), in which Ultra, along with [[Space Ranger]], is riding in [[Space Cabby]]'s cab and looking for Starman IV's cosmic staff for the Space Museum.  Each regales the other with a different interpretations of Jack and Mikaal rescuing [[Starfire (comics)|Starfire]] from a space pirate.

[[Geoff Johns]] was the next writer to use these concepts. A storyline in ''[[Stars and S.T.R.I.P.E.]]'' involved [[Young Justice]] teaming with [[Stargirl|Star-Spangled Kid]] and [[Pat Dugan|S.T.R.I.P.E.]] to stop a group of Larroo (one of the four aliens from Ultra's origin) from using their ray to turn everyone in [[Blue Valley (comics)|Blue Valley]] into Larroo. It was established that the Larroo had invented the ray, but were preparing to sell it to the other three alien races.  

Ultra appeared as a background character in the ''Infinite Crisis'' event. Having apparently somehow traveled back in time to the present era, Ultra is one of the many spacefaring heroes who aid [[Donna Troy]] in the fallout of the [[Rann-Thanagar War]]. He also appeared in ''[[Superman]]/[[Batman]]'' # 31 (2007), overwhelmed by an alien influence that is affecting many of the part-alien heroes on earth. After a highly destructive rampage through the American town of Dalesville, he leaves (causing more destruction upon his exit) with Supergirl, also affected. In "Superman/Batman" #33, he and other influenced aliens try to destroy the titular heroes. Fortunately his mind is soon cleared of all influence and the villain behind it all, [[Despero]], is defeated.

The planet Larroo appeared in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #867. [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]] attacked the planet while searching the universe for Superman. Superman arrived but could do nothing. A city containing all four races which created Ultra was contained within a forcefield, shrunk and captured. Their star was detonated and Superman was left floating among the remains of the planet. His most recent appearance is in ''Action Comics'' #868 and #872, held with other humanoid characters on Brainiac's ship.
