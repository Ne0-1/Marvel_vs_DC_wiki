'''Gim Allon''' is a [[fictional character]] in the 30th and 31st centuries of the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]] who has gone by a variety of [[superhero]] names over the past several decades, although originally (and most commonly) Colossal Boy.  He is a member of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]].  He first appeared in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #267.  In the 1990s, the entirety of the Legion of Super-Heroes were changed in what was referred to as a "reboot" of those characters continuity, including Allon.  Later on, these superheroes were again restarted in what has been referred to as the "threeboot" of the Legion of Super-Heroes.  This last version is currently being published by DC Comics.

The name was Gim Allon was probably devised as a science-fiction version of "Jim Allen"; but later its similarity to the standard Israeli surname "Allon" led writer [[Paul Levitz]] to identify the character as Jewish in the 1970s. 

==Character history==
===Original Continuity===
[[Image:Colossalboy.gif|100px|thumb|left|Gim Allon as Colossal Boy, in his Silver Age costume.  Art by [[Curt Swan]] and [[George Klein (comics)|George Klein]].]]
Gim Allon was mutated by a [[radiation|radioactive]] [[meteorite]], gaining the [[superhuman]] ability to increase his size, and went by the superhero name of Colossal Boy.  With his parents' blessing, he joined the Legion of Super-Heroes, becoming a member in good standing.  He had an unreciprocated crush on fellow Legionnaire [[Shrinking Violet]]; this crush was only returned when Violet was replaced by a [[shapeshifting]] impostor, a [[Durlan (DC Comics)|Durlan]] named Yera.  The two were married; when the deception was exposed, he discovered that he was still in love with Yera, and they remained married.  For a time, Colossal Boy's mother Marte Allon was President of the Earth.

During the "Five Year Gap" following the Magic Wars, Gim joined the Science Police and ultimately never returned to the Legion.  Earth fell under the covert control of the [[Dominators]], and withdrew from the [[United Planets]].  A few years later, the members of the Dominators' highly classified "Batch SW6" escaped captivity.  Originally, Batch SW6 appeared to be a group of teeange Legionnaire clones, created from samples apparently taken just prior to [[Ferro Lad]]'s death at the hands of the [[Sun-Eater]].  Later, they were revealed to be time-paradox duplicates, every bit as legitimate as their older counterparts.  After Earth was destroyed in a disaster reminiscent of the destruction of [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]] over a millennium earlier,<ref>''Legion of Super-Heroes'' (Vol. 4) #38, Late December 1992.</ref>  a few dozen surviving cities and their inhabitants reconstituted their world as New Earth. The SW6 Legionnaires remained, and their version of Colossal Boy assumed the code name Leviathan.

===1994 Reboot===

In 1994 the original continuity of the Legion ended and their story was restarted from the beginning.  In this post [[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]] version, Gim Allon was known as Leviathan and was from Mars instead of Earth. Like his previous counterpart, he was a Science Police officer who was given his powers by being grazed by a meteorite.

He was the first official leader of the team, but resigned after one mission, following the death of the first [[Kid Quantum]] and realising that [[Cosmic Boy]] was more suited to the role - although Rokk persuaded him to take on the deputy leadership.

He then became ensconced in a [[love triangle]]. While he nursed a crush on [[Kinetix]], [[Violet (comics)|Shrinking Violet]] nursed a crush on him. This ended in tragedy when the [[Emerald Empress|Emerald Eye]] - on orders from Violet to give each member of the team their heart's desire - caused him to die in battle with [[Doctor Regulus]], fulfilling his wish to have a heroic death.

===2005 Reboot===
In the 2005 relaunch, Gim Allon is a member of race of giants created by Bizarro-Brainiac 200 years prior to the start of the "Legion Era". He considers his super-power to be the ability to shrink to six feet tall and prefers the code name '''Micro Lad'''.  Still, all Legionnaires, as well as the public in general, know him as Colossal Boy. He often affects a bemused manner with his comrades, enjoying his time spent with "little people."  Gim is often both the first and last Legionnaire in a fight, as his size grants him first strike ability as well as serving useful in the cleanup operations which inevitably follow.

He should not be confused with the [[Imsk]]ian villain who used the name Micro Lad, in preboot continuity.

===Post-Infinite Crisis===
The events of the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' miniseries have apparently restored a close analogue of the Pre-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] Legion to continuity, as seen in "[[The Lightning Saga]]" story arc in ''[[Justice League of America]]'' and ''[[Justice Society of America]]'', and in the "[[Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes (comics)|Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes]]" story arc in ''[[Action Comics]]''.  Colossal Boy is included in their number.

==Powers==
As Colossal Boy or Leviathan, Gim Allon could increase his size to many times the height of a human, with proportionate increases in strength and mass.  In the current run of Legion of Super-Heroes, the character insists that his powers involve shrinking instead of growing, although the effect upon opponents appears to be the same.

==Other media==
Colossal Boy made a cameo in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "Far From Home". 

Colossal Boy appeared in three episodes of the first season of the animated TV series ''[[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)|Legion of Super Heroes]]''. First, in "Timber Wolf," where he is only seen on a monitor, and in "Lightning Storm", where he helped the Legion stop a squid-like alien in space. He also appeared in "Chain of Command" for a mission. He has become a semi-regular character in season two.
