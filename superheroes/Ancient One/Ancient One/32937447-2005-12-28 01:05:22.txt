He was the mentor of both [[Doctor Strange]] and [[Baron Mordo]], and held the title "[[Sorcerer Supreme]]" prior to Strange earning that position himself.

Eventually, Strange was forced to "kill" the Ancient One to stop an extradimensional monster called Shuma-Gorath, but the manner of his "death" in fact caused him to achieve [[transcendence]].

In the [[Guardians of the Galaxy]] timeline, Doctor Strange ceded the role and title of Sorcerer Supreme to his own pupil and became known as the Ancient One himself.
