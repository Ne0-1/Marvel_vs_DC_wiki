The '''Ancient One''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Universe|Universe]] of the [[Marvel Comics]] comic book company. He was the mentor of [[Doctor Strange]] and existed as the "Sorcerer Supreme", a title that he wins, during the 20th century AD.<ref>{{cite web|title=CHAPTER 3: THE DAWN OF HUMAN CIVILIZATION|url=http://www.reocities.com/jjnevins/wicks3.html|work=ReoCities – The  UNOFFICIAL CHRONOLOGY TO  THE MARVEL UNIVERSE|publisher=Jess Nevins|accessdate=2 December 2012|author=Jess Nevins|year=2012}}</ref> 

==Fictional character biography==
The character who would eventually become the Ancient One was born in [[Kamar-Taj]], [[Tibet]], more than 500 years in the past.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} In his youth, he was a peaceful farmer, but his friend, [[Kaluu]], discovered the power of magic.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} and shared his knowledge of the mystic arts with friend; however, the two friends disagreed on how they would use the powers. The Ancient One wishes to protect his village and help others, but Kaluu, while sharing a desire to protect the village, seeks to conquer the neighboring villages with an army formed from the villagers; a large empire is Kaluu's ultimate aspiration.

The Ancient One and Kaluu agree to cast a spell, eliminating sickness, disease and age from Kamar-Taj; shortly afterwards, Kaluu, while under Kaluu's mind-control spell, is crowned as king of the village by its inhabitants. The Ancient One tries to stop Kaluu and the village of Kamar-Taj is wiped out as a result of their conflict. Kaluu is consequently banished to an alternate dimension and the Ancient One is stripped of his immortality; however, the Ancient One ages far more slowly than any regular human.<ref>''Strange Tales'' vol. 1 #111</ref>

===Acquiring knowledge===
Over the next few centuries, the Ancient One travels the Earth, battling demons and evil spirits, banishing many from Earth. He increases his own knowledge, gathering and guarding books that contain dangerous knowledge. He encounters the being, [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]], through his meditations and the latter gives him the [[Eye of Agamotto|Amulet of Agamotto]], a powerful mystical artifact.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Then in [[Babylonia]], the Ancient One defeats a [[griffin]] while guarding the [[Book of the Vishanti]], a tome of mystical knowledge, that eventually ends up in his possession.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} 

The Ancient One finally settles in the [[Himalaya]] Mountains and builds a palace as his home, together with an order of monks that he forms for his own protection and support.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} In a tournament organized by the sorcerer, [[Aged Genghis]], the Ancient One wins the title of Earth's Sorcerer Supreme{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} and subsequently takes on responsibility for a student, who later becomes [[Mister Jip]]. The student is then banned from the Ancient One–Sorcerer Supreme's home when the student is discovered by his master to have been studying forbidden books of black magic to increase his own power.<ref>''Strange Tales'' vol. 3 #11</ref>

In London, during the [[Great Fire of London|Great London Fire]], the Ancient One, one of their many conflicts, battles [[Dormammu]], forcing him to retreat.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} While the Ancient One successfully protects Earth, he never completely defeats Dormammu, meaning that Dormammu repeatedly returns.

===Taking an apprentice===
As he ages and weakens, the Ancient One seeks out another student{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} and eventually approaches Anthony Ludgate Druid, a psychiatrist with mystical talents. Posing as the High Lama, the Ancient One trains Druid to become [[Doctor Druid]].<ref>''Avengers Spotlight'' #37</ref> Also, [[Baron Mordo]], a [[Transylvania]]n nobleman, approaches the Ancient One to inquire about the possibility of becoming his student. The Ancient One saw the corruption within Mordo's heart, but holds hope that rerdemption would occur following the training–teaching process. 

The Ancient One accepts Mordo's request and begins teaching Mordo,{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} who seems to change at first, but grows jealous when the Ancient One proceeds to protect a boy named [[Doctor Strange|Stephen Strange]]—the Ancient One claims that Strange possesses incredible magical talents and holds the potential to become the new Sorcerer Supreme.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Mordo constructs a plot against Strange, sending demons and nightmares to plague the boy, but the Ancient One continues to protect Strange and erases the encounters from the boy's mind. However, the boy has nevertheless been affected by Mordo's actions and Strange eventually becomes a self-centered, highly successful neurosurgeon.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} It is revealed that the Ancient One was aware of Mordo's actions, but decides to maintain a close relationship with Mordo with the intention of limiting any further damage due to an ability to monitor Mordo's actions.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} 

After a car crash, Strange seeks assistance from the Ancient One to cure the nerve damage in his hands. The Ancient One then accepts Strange as a student when Strange reveals a discovery to the Ancient One, whereby Mordo and Dormammu had become collaborators and that Mordo had perpetrated an attack against the Ancient One.<ref name="Vine">{{cite web|title=Doctor Strange|url=http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-strange/29-1456/|work=Comic Vine|publisher=Comic Vine|accessdate=2 December 2012|year=2012}}</ref> Mordo leaves the palace shortly afterwards and Stephen becomes the Ancient One's successor under the name "[[Doctor Strange]]".<ref>''Strange Tales'' vol. 1 #115</ref> The Ancient One often assists Strange, but when the extra-dimensional monster, [[Shuma-Gorath]], tries to invade Earth through the Ancient One's mind while the latter is in the Crypts of Kaa-U, the Ancient One prompts Strange to destroy the portion of the Ancient One's mind in which the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]], or sense of self, exist within. While such action blocks the way for Shuma-Gorath, trapping him within the Ancient One's mind, the Ancient One's physical body is also destroyed. The Ancient One's corporeal existence is over, but his soul subsequently achieves [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]], becoming one with the universe and [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]].<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #8-10</ref> Strange then inherits the Ancient One's title as Sorcerer Supreme and corresponding powers.

The Ancient One demonstrates his existence following the death of his physical body by manifesting himself as an avatar of Eternity, intervening in a struggle between Doctor Strange and Eternity.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' vol. 2 #12-13</ref> He also briefly regains his corporeal form when the [[Creators (comics)|Creators]] cause the universe to reject him, during which time he lives as an [[alcoholism|alcohol-dependent]] derelict in the [[Bowery]] section of [[Manhattan]], New York, United States (US).<ref name="mnyc">{{cite book  | last = Sanderson  | first = Peter  | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City  | publisher = [[Pocket Books]]  | year = 2007  | location = New York City  | url =   | doi =   | id =   | isbn = 1-4165-3141-6  | page = 18}}</ref> He resumed his oneness with the universe upon Doctor Strange's defeat of the Creators.<ref>''Strange Tales'' vol. 2 #26-28</ref>

===The next-life===
The Ancient One reappeared in the ''[[Dead Girl]]'' mini-series as an opponent of Dr. Strange. For increasingly evil acts in the afterlife, the Ancient One is demoted to Hell. While in Hel, the Ancient One becomes an ally of the Pitiful One and other banished characters seeking to regain life. In a climactic battle, Strange defeats his former teacher,{{issue|date=August 2012}} but, in the ''All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z'', select entries (including that of the Ancient One himself) state that the Ancient One on this occasion was likely to have been an impostor.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

During Hercules' journey to the underworld in the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline, the Ancient One was seen in Erebus gambling for his resurrection.<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #129</ref>

During a demonic invasion of New York via the [[Eye of Agamotto]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] finds himself transferred into a white void when he comes in contact with the Eye, resulting in a face-to-face confrontation with a form that appears to be the Ancient One; the form claims that both he and a currently-unidentified associate are responsible for the demonic invasion due to his anger at Strange's recent "failures".<ref name="New Avengers vol. 2 #3">''New Avengers'' vol. 2 #3</ref> However, a casual comment by [[Spider-Man]] prompts Strange, [[Doctor Voodoo]], and [[Daimon Hellstrom]] to realize that they are actually dealing with Agamotto himself, as the Ancient One's demands for the Eye defy everything that was previously told to Strange about how the Eye is passed from one sorcerer to another.<ref name="New Avengers vol. 2 #3"/>

After [[Daniel Drumm]] is defeated by Doctor Strange, using dark magic that does not control him, the Ancient One's spirit appears and speaks to Doctor Strange: 

<blockquote>
You taught yourself to vanquish a foe who used your friends as weapons against. And you did it without hurting any of them. You protected this realm even though it is no longer your duty. I know that you relinquished your role as Sorcerer Supreme because you thought you did not deserve it anymore. Yet you continued to act as hero to anyone and everyone. And you asked for nothing in return. And because of this, I bequeath you once again the all-seeing Eye of Agamotto. For you are the Sorcerer Supreme once more."<ref>''New Avengers'' Vol. 2 #34</ref></blockquote>

==Strange (2005)==
In [[J. Michael Straczynski]]'s ''Strange'' series, Doctor Strange's origin was adapted. In this series, the Ancient One differs slightly from the established Ancient One, as he is an ancient [[magic (paranormal)|magician]], physically frail from old age, but spiritually and psychically powerful. He is depicted as an old, bald man with a long, flowing, white beard and moustache, usually shown sitting cross-legged and immersed in prayer or meditation, while dressed in nothing but a white robe. This version of the character retreated from human society more than a thousand years ago, preferring to live alone in the depths of a dark cavern, sustaining himself through prayer and meditation, having no need for food or drink.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==Powers and abilities==
In his prime, the Ancient One was a master of the mystic arts, with a vast knowledge of magical lore. He possessed the ability to manipulate the forces of magic for a vast number of effects and was able to tap into extra-dimensional energy by invoking entities or objects of power, existing in dimensions tangential to those of the Earth, through the recitation of spells. The Ancient One was capable of [[astral projection]], [[levitation]], interdimensional teleportation, and a large number of other effects. 

The Ancient One also possessed a variety of mystical objects, such as the Book of the Vishanti, the [[Orb of Agamotto|Orb]], Amulet, and [[Eye of Agamotto]], and devices gathered throughout his lifetime. After becoming one with Eternity, the extent of the Ancient One's powers is unknown.
