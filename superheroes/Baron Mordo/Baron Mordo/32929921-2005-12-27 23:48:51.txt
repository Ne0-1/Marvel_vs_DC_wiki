'''Baron Karl Amadeus Mordo''' was a [[fictional character|fictional]] villain created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]], in [[comic book]]s featuring his opponent [[Doctor Strange]]. He first appeared in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #111 (August 1963).
==Character biography==
Originally a [[Transylvania]]n nobleman, Mordo became a student of the [[Tibet]]an sorcerer known as the [[Ancient One]]. When Mordo plotted to kill his teacher, the Ancient One's newer student Dr. Stephen Strange learned of the plot, and was forced to develop great magical skills in order to overcome Mordo. Thereafter, the evil Mordo became an open foe of Dr. Strange and often joined forces with his sometime master, the [[demon]]ic [[Dormammu]], to battle Strange and to generally amass power.

His abilities were similar to those of Dr. Strange, but he was particularly skilled at [[astral projection]] and [[mesmerism]].  He was more than willing to use powerful [[black magic]] and [[invocation|invoke]] demons, both of which Strange was reluctant or unable to do, although both acts would sometimes backfire on Mordo.

Mordo eventually contracted terminal [[cancer]] as a side effect of his use of black magic, and renounced evil just before his death in ''Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme'' #87 (March 1996). However, in ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #500 (December 2003), he was resurrected as a side-effect of Doctor Strange's manipulation of time to help [[Spider-Man]].

==Powers and abilities==
Baron Mordo has vast magical abilities derived from his years of studying black magic and the mystic arts. He can separate his astral form from his body, allowing him to become intangible and invisible to most beings (obviously useful for spying). He can project deadly force blasts using magic, can teleport, and can manipulate many forms of magical energy. He can also summon demons but they often don't do what he wants them to do (because they are demons).

Baron Mordo has great intelligence.
