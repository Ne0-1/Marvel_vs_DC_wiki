==Fictional character biography==
Originally a [[Transylvania]]n nobleman (born in Varf Mandra), Mordo became a student of the [[Tibet]]an [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]] known as the [[Ancient One]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} When Mordo plotted to kill his teacher, the Ancient One's visitor Dr. Stephen Strange learned of the plot, forcing Mordo to cast restraining spells to prevent him from warning his master or attacking him. Unfortunately, when Strange selflessly decided to accept the Ancient One's offer to learn [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] in order to help the old man, the Ancient One freed him from those spells, which he was fully aware were in place, and trained him as a formidable enemy of Mordo. Eventually Mordo was exiled by the Ancient One.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #111</ref> Mordo's abilities were similar to those of Doctor Strange, but Mordo was particularly skilled at [[astral projection]] and [[hypnosis]], as well as [[Animal magnetism|mesmerism]]. He was more than willing to use powerful [[black magic]] and invoke [[Demons in the Marvel Universe|demons]], both of which Strange was reluctant or unable to do, although both acts would sometimes backfire on Mordo.

The evil Mordo became an open foe of Doctor Strange, serving as one of Strange's primary antagonists early in his career as [[Sorcerer Supreme]]. He sent his astral form to hypnotize the Ancient One's servant into poisoning his food, hoping the old man would reveal his secrets of magic. However, Strange tricked him into returning to his physical body after engaging in astral contact with him, thus breaking his hold over the servant, who helped the Ancient One to recover. Mordo disguised himself as Sir Clive Bentley, and trapped Doctor Strange with a drugged candle that paralyzed him, but Strange was able to use his mental powers to call a local girl to free him.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #114</ref> He opposed Doctor Strange's discipleship to the Ancient One.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #115</ref> He set a series of new traps for Strange in a bid to wrest magical secrets from the Ancient One.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #117</ref>  Mordo stole Strange's body while Strange was astral projecting for a threat he sensed that Mordo had caused, and cast a barrier around it, knowing that if his astral form was out for 24 hours it would die. Strange found it in a Wax museum, but was unable to enter. But Strange took control of a wax model in the last minute, distracting Mordo and enabling Strange to return to his body.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #121</ref> He imprisoned the Ancient One, but was again defeated.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #125</ref> Mordo made a deal with his new master, the demonic [[Dormammu]], to amass additional power to defeat Doctor Strange.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #130</ref> He dispatched agents, other evil magicians around the World and Spirit wraiths, to search for the incognito Strange,<ref>''Strange Tales'' #131</ref> and then banished him from the Earth.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #132</ref> He fled from Strange,<ref>''Strange Tales'' #134</ref> and then dispatched agents to kill Strange.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #135-136</ref> He engaged in personal combat with Strange.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #139</ref> Mordo was exiled to the Dimension of Demons by Dormammu.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #141</ref> He battled Doctor Strange once more at Stonehenge, but was ultimately banished from Earth.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #159-162</ref>

Mordo would return in time to continue to bedevil Doctor Strange. He impersonated Doctor Strange during Strange's brief retirement, but was soon vanquished.<ref>''Marvel Feature'' #1</ref> Mordo discovered the Book of Cagliostro, and battled Strange in 18th-Century Paris.  He then accompanied Strange and [[Sise-Neg]] to the dawn of time.<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #13-14</ref> After suffering a mental breakdown, he was placed in Doctor Strange's care, but later escaped.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' #10</ref> Mordo transformed the dead Lord Phyffe into Azrael, angel of death, and dispatched him against Strange.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' #40</ref> He sent the [[Man-Thing]] to kill Strange, and assembled thirteen people for human sacrifice to the Chaos Demon. Mordo was defeated by Strange, [[Jennifer Kale]], and the Man-Thing.<ref>''Man-Thing'' Vol. 2 #4; ''Doctor Strange'' #41</ref> He attacked Strange, and escaped into the 1940s, but was manipulated by Dormammu.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' #49-50</ref>

Mordo later sold his soul to both [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] and [[Satannish]] for power, gaming that Strange would save him. He was trapped with [[Sara Wolfe]], and later rescued her.<ref>''Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme'' #5-8</ref> Mordo himself was later imprisoned, and Sara Wolfe freed him from imprisonment. Mordo battled Dormammu to defend the Earth. He was defeated, and pretended to ally himself with Dormammu, and then allied himself with [[Umar (Marvel Comics)|Umar]] to defeat Dormammu.<ref>''Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme'' #22-23</ref>

Umar and Mordo were eventually deposed by Clea.<ref>''Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme'' #48</ref> Mordo eventually contracted terminal [[cancer]] as a side effect of his use of black magic, and renounced evil just before his death.<ref>''Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme'' #87 (March 1996)</ref> He later returned to life.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #500</ref> He later allies himself with [[Terrax]], [[Tiger Shark (Marvel Comics)|Tiger Shark]] and [[Red Hulk]] as the "Offenders", to be opposed by his old rival and newly costumed Doctor Strange, aided by the other three original Defenders.<ref>''Hulk'' #10</ref>

Mordo appeared in the pages of ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' Vol. 3 #203, where it is revealed that he kidnapped politician Cartier St. Croix in order to lure his daughter [[Monet St. Croix]] into a trap.<ref>''X-Factor'' Vol. 3 #203</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Baron Mordo has vast magical abilities derived from his years of studying black magic and the mystic arts. He can manipulate magical forces for a variety of effects, including hypnotism, mesmerism, thought-casting, and illusion casting. He can separate his astral form from his body, allowing him to become intangible and invisible to most beings. He can project deadly force blasts using magic, can teleport inter-dimensionally, and can manipulate many forms of magical energy. He can tap extra-dimensional energy by invoking entities or objects of power existing in dimensions tangential to Earth's through the recitation of spells. He can also summon demons, but often does not have enough power to force them to do what he wants them to do.

Baron Mordo has some knowledge of a karate-like martial art form, and has an extensive knowledge of magical lore.

==Other versions==
===''Mutant X''===
Baron Mordo appears in the last issue of ''[[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]]'', being referred to as the 'Ancient One'. He is still considered a villain, though he allies himself with other heroes and villains in order to stop the Beyonder/Goblin Queen entity.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Baron Mordo first appears in the ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'' episode "Sins of the Fathers Chapter 1: Dr. Strange" voiced by [[Tony Jay]]. In the show, Mordo appears as Dormammu's minion. In his first appearance, he was ordered by Dormammu to steal the [[Wand of Watoomb]] to make a portal that would release him from his dimension. To do so, Mordo brainwashes [[Mary Jane Watson]] to become his servant. His plan almost succeeded when Spider-Man, Dr. Strange, his assistant Wong, and Mary Jane stopped him from freeing Mordo's master from his dimension. Later, in "[[Venom Returns]]" and "[[Carnage (Spider-Man: The Animated Series)|Carnage]]", Mordo was ordered by Dormammu to bring the symbiote back to Earth to make [[Eddie Brock]] whole once more. Then, Dormammu orders Mordo to give Brock a message. At Stark Enterprises, Mordo disguises himself as Orden Bloom in order to get the portal. When Spider-Man and [[War Machine]] join forces to fight Venom, Dormammu tells Mordo that there is another symbiote, which Mordo then bestows to [[Cletus Kasady]], naming the result "Carnage." After retrieving the probe, Dormammu orders Carnage to steal the "life force" energy from humans, so he may gain enough strength to enter our world. When Carnage absorbs too much force, Mordo brings him back to his lair to drain the power into an urn. When Carnage attempts to send the urn into Dormammu's portal, Spider-Man, [[Iron Man]], and Venom interrupt him. Mordo ordered Carnage to throw the urn to unleash Dormammu, but was thwarted. Sacrificing himself, Venom pulled Carnage into the dimension following Dormammu's reversion, after which Mordo made his escape.
* Baron Mordo appears in ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]'' episode "Night in the Sanctorum" voiced by [[Dave Boat]]. This version of the character is also completely insane. He was shown imprisoned in a soda can when [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]]' magic vexes [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] to open the soda can containing Mordo. While belching out bubbles, Mordo ends up fighting Thor destroying Doctor Stange's kitchen until Doctor Strange appears and reimprisons Mordo in the soda can. In "Invader from the Dark Dimension", the soda can Mordo was imprisoned in was recycled into the Dark Dimension by [[Wong (comics)|Wong]]. When Iron Man ends up in the Dark Dimension through a [[Portals in fiction|portal]] near the statue of the Mayor of Superhero City, he encounters Mordo. Mordo manages to possess Iron Man, and uses his body to try to claim all of the Infinity Fractals. Upon turning Iron Man into the Iron Menace upon possessing him, Mordo takes over Stark Industries and uses [[mind control]] technology to take over [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], Redwing, and [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]]. Thor, [[Silver Surfer]], and [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] had to team up with Doctor Strange and [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]] to stop him even gaining some help from [[Doctor Doom]] and [[MODOK]]. Doctor Strange managed to trick Mordo back into the Dark Dimension and free Iron Man from his control.

===Film===
* Baron Mordo appears as the secondary antagonist in the 2007 animated movie ''[[Doctor Strange: The Sorcerer Supreme]]'' voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]. His origin is altered, yet maintains his dislike for Strange and the Ancient One. In this adaptation he is a warrior-like sorcerer who began to think only about victory instead of why they battled, willing to go as far as killing innocent children, which was against all the Ancient One stood for; this caused the Ancient One to reject his attempt to be Sorcerer Supreme. Believing the Ancient One has turned his back on him, Mordo sided with Dormammu and killed his former master. Doctor Strange managed to avenge the Ancient One and defeated Mordo. Angered at his failure, Dormammu eats his failed servant.

===Video games===
* Baron Mordo appears in the video game ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'' voiced by [[Philip Proctor]]. He is a member of the game's version of the [[Masters of Evil]] and one of Doctor Doom's lieutenants. He uses a spell to have the Orb of Teleportation transport the heroes to Murderworld instead of Castle Doom. He and [[Ultron]] fight the heroes in the path to Spire's Ascent after Doctor Doom and [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] left them behind. A simulation disk has Doctor Strange protecting [[Clea]] from Baron Mordo while in Mephisto's Realm. Another simulation disk has [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]] protecting Wolverine from Baron Mordo while in Mephisto's Realm also. He doesn't speak in either simulation disk though.
