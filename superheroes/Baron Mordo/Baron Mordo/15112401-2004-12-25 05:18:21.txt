'''Baron Karl Amadeus Mordo''' was a [[fictional character|fictional]] villain created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]], in [[comic book]]s featuring his opponent [[Doctor Strange]]. He first appeared in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #111, and died in ''Doctor Strange, Sorceror Supreme'' #87.

Originally a [[Transylvania]]n nobleman, Mordo became a student of the [[Tibet]]an sorcerer known as the Ancient One. When Mordo plotted to kill his teacher, the Ancient One's newer student Dr. Stephen Strange learned of the plot, and was forced to develop great magical skills in order to overcome Mordo. Thereafter, the evil Mordo became an open foe of Dr. Strange and often joined forces with his sometime master, the [[demon]]ic [[Dormammu]], to battle Strange and to generally amass power.

His abilities were similar to those of Dr. Strange, but he was particularly skilled at [[astral projection]] and [[mesmerism]].  He was more than willing to use powerful [[black magic]] and [[invocation|invoke]] demons, both of which Strange was reluctant or unable to do, although both acts would sometimes backfire on Mordo.

Mordo eventually contracted terminal [[cancer]] as a side effect of his use of black magic, and renounced evil just before his death. However, recently in the pages of [[Amazing Spider-Man]], he has been resurrected as a side-effect of Strange and Spider-Man's manipulations of time.
