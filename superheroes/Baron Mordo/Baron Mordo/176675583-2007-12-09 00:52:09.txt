'''Baron Karl Amadeus Mordo''' was a [[fictional character|fictional]] villain created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]], in [[comic book]]s featuring his opponent [[Doctor Strange]]. He first appeared in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #111 (August 1963).

==Fictional character biography==
Originally a [[Transylvania]]n nobleman (born in Varf Mandra), Mordo became a student of the [[Tibet]]an sorcerer known as the [[Ancient One]]. When Mordo plotted to kill his teacher, the Ancient One's newer student [[Doctor Strange|Dr. Stephen Strange]] learned of the plot, and was forced to develop great magical skills in order to overcome Mordo.  Mordo was exiled by the Ancient One.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #111</ref> Mordo's abilities were similar to those of Dr. Strange, but Mordo was particularly skilled at [[astral projection]] and [[mesmerism]].  He was more than willing to use powerful [[black magic]] and [[invocation|invoke]] demons, both of which Strange was reluctant or unable to do, although both acts would sometimes backfire on Mordo.

The evil Mordo became an open foe of Doctor Strange, serving as one of Strange's primary antagonists early in his career as [[Sorcerer Supreme]].  Mordo disguised himself as Sir Clive Bentley, and trapped Doctor Strange.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #114</ref> He opposed Dr. Strange's discipleship to the Ancient One.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #115</ref> He set a series of new traps for Strange in a bid to wrest magical secrets from the Ancient One.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #117</ref>  Mordo stole Strange's body while Strange was astral projecting.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #121</ref> He imprisoned the Ancient one.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #125</ref> Mordo made a deal with his new master, the [[Demons (Marvel Comics)|demonic]] [[Dormammu]], to amass additional power to defeat Doctor Strange.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #130</ref> He dispatched agents to search for the incognito Strange,<ref>''Strange Tales'' #131</ref> and then banished him from the Earth.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #132</ref> He fled from Strange,<ref>''Strange Tales'' #134</ref> and then dispatched agents to kill Strange.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #135-136</ref> He engaged in personal combat with Strange.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #139</ref> Mordo was exiled to the Dimension of Demons by Dormammu.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #141</ref> He battled Dr. Strange once more at Stonehenge, but was ultimately banished from Earth.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #159-162</ref>

Mordo would return in time to continue to bedevil Doctor Strange.  He impersonated Doctor Strange during Strange's brief retirement, but was soon vanquished.<ref>''Marvel Feature'' #1</ref> Mordo discovered the Book of Cagliostro, and battled Strange in 18th-Century Paris.  He then accompanied Strange and [[Sise-Neg]] to the dawn of time.<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #13-14</ref> After suffering a mental breakdown, he was placed in Doctor Strange's care, but later escaped.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' #10</ref> Mordo transformed the dead Lord Phyffe into Azrael, angel of death, and dispatched him against Strange.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' #40</ref> He sent the [[Man-Thing]] to kill Strange, and assembled thirteen people for human sacrifice to the Chaos Demon.  Mordo was defeated by Strange, [[Jennifer Kale]], and the Man-Thing.<ref>''Man-Thing'' Vol. 2 #4; ''Doctor Strange'' #41</ref> He attacked Strange, and escaped into the 1940s, but was manipulated by Dormammu.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' #49-50</ref>

Mordo later sold his soul to both [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] and [[Satannish]] for power, gaming that Strange would save him.  He was trapped with [[Sara Wolfe]], and later rescued her.<ref>''Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme'' #5-8</ref> Mordo himself was later imprisoned, and Sara Wolfe freed him from imprisonment. Mordo battled Dormammu to defend the Earth.  He was defeated, and pretended to ally himself with Dormammu, and then allied himself with [[Umar (Marvel Comics)|Umar]] to defeat Dormammu.<ref>''Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme'' #22-23</ref>

Mordo eventually contracted terminal [[cancer]] as a side effect of his use of black magic, and renounced evil just before his death.<ref>''Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme'' #87 (March 1996)</ref>.

==Powers and abilities==
Baron Mordo has vast magical abilities derived from his years of studying black magic and the mystic arts. He can manipulate magical forces for a variety of effects, including mesmerism, thought-casting, and illusion casting. He can separate his astral form from his body, allowing him to become intangible and invisible to most beings. He can project deadly force blasts using magic, can teleport inter-dimensionally, and can manipulate many forms of magical energy. He can tap extra-dimensional energy by invoking entities or objects of power existing in dimensions tangential to Earth's through the recitation of spells.  He can also summon demons, but often does not have enough power to force them to do what he wants them to do.

Baron Mordo has some knowledge of a karate-like martial art form, and has an extensive knowledge of magical lore.

==Other versions==
===Mutant X===
Baron Mordo appears in the last issue of the [[Mutant X]] series, being referred to as the 'Ancient One'. He is still considered a villain, though he allies himself with other heroes and villains in order to stop the Beyonder/Goblin Queen entity.

==In other media==

===Cartoons===
*In ''[[Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'', Baron Mordo (voiced by [[Tony Jay]]) first appears in [[Doctor Strange (Spider-Man: Animated Series)|''Sins of the Fathers'' Chapter 1: Dr. Strange]]. In the show, Mordo appears as Dormammu's minion. In his first appearance, he was ordered by Dormammu to steal the Wand of Watoomb to make a portal that would release him from his dimension. To do so, Mordo brainwashes [[Mary Jane Watson]] to become his servant.  His plan almost succeeded when Spider-Man, [[Dr. Strange]], his assistant Wong, and Mary Jane stopped him from freeing Mordo's master from his dimension. Later, in "[[Venom Returns]]" and "[[Carnage (Spider-Man: The Animated Series)|Carnage]]", Mordo was ordered by Dormammu to bring the symbiote back to Earth to make [[Eddie Brock]] whole once more.  Then, Dormammu orders Mordo to give Brock a message.  At Stark Enterprises, Mordo disguises himself as Orden Bloom in order to get the portal.  When Spider-Man and [[War Machine]] join forces to fight Venom, Dormammu tells Mordo that there is another symbiote, which Mordo then bestows to Cletus Kasady, naming the result "Carnage." After retrieving the probe, Dormammu orders Carnage to steal the "life force" energy from humans, so he may gain enough strength to enter our world. When Carnage absorbs too much force, Mordo brings him back to his lair to drain the power into an urn. When Carnage attempts to send the urn into Dormammu's portal, Spider-Man, [[Iron Man]], and Venom interrupt him. Mordo ordered Carnage to throw the urn to unleash Dormammu, but was thwarted. Sacrificing himself, Venom pulled Carnage into the dimension following Dormammu's reversion, after which Mordo made his escape.

===Film===
Mordo appears as one of the main villains in the 2007 animated movie ''[[Doctor Strange (2007 film)|Dr. Strange]]'' voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]. His origin is altered, yet maintains his dislike for Strange and the Ancient One. In it he is a warrior-like sorcerer who began to think only about victory instead of why they battled, going as far as killing innocent children, which was against all the Ancient One stood for; this caused the Ancient One to reject his attempt to be Sorcerer Supreme. Believing the Ancient One is the traitor, Mordo sided with Dormammu and killed his former master. Doctor Strange manages to avenge the Ancient One and defeat Mordo. Angered at his failure, Dormammu devours his failed servant.

===Video Games===
Baron Mordo appears in the video game ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'' voiced by [[Philip Proctor]]. He is a member of this version of the [[Masters of Evil]], and one of [[Doctor Doom]]'s lieutenants. He and [[Ultron]] fight the heroes in the path to Spire's Ascent after Doctor Doom and [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] left them behind. A simulation disk has Doctor Strange protecting Clea from Baron Mordo while in Mephisto's Realm. Another simulation disk has [[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Ghost Rider]] protecting [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] from Baron Mordo while in Mephisto's Realm also.
