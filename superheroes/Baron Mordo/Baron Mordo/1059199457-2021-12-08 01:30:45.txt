==Publication history==

Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]], Baron Mordo first appeared in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #111 (Aug. 1963).<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=42}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
A [[Transylvania]]n nobleman (born in Varf Mandra), Karl Amadeus Mordo became a student of the [[Tibet]]an [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]] known as the [[Ancient One]].<ref>''Strange Tales'' #115 (Dec. 1963)</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=93}}</ref> When Mordo plotted to kill his teacher, Dr. Stephen Strange learned of the plot. Mordo was forced to cast restraining spells to prevent Strange from warning the Ancient One. In desperation, Strange decided to accept the Ancient One's offer to take him on as his mentor in [[Magic (supernatural)|magic]] to have some hope of stopping Mordo. The Ancient One, however, was fully aware of Mordo's plot and of Strange's desire to warn him. Pleased at Strange's unselfish decision, the Ancient One's [[Magic (supernatural)|magical teachings]] immediately freed the doctor and explained the full situation. Thus informed in the face of his recent experiences, Strange agreed to become the Ancient One's apprentice despite the requirement that he abandon his former life. The Ancient One trained him to be a formidable opponent of Mordo. Eventually Mordo was exiled by the Ancient One.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #111</ref> Mordo's abilities were similar to those of Doctor Strange, but Mordo was particularly skilled at [[astral projection]] and [[hypnosis]], as well as [[Animal magnetism|mesmerism]]. He was more than willing to use powerful [[black magic]] and invoke [[List of Marvel Comics demons|demons]], both of which Strange was reluctant or unable to do. Mordo's use of these darker arts would sometimes backfire.

The evil Mordo became an open foe of Doctor Strange. He sent his [[Astral projection|astral form]] to hypnotize the Ancient One's servant into poisoning his food, hoping the old man would reveal his secrets of magic. However, Strange tricked him into returning to his physical body after engaging in astral contact with him, thus breaking his hold over the servant, who helped the Ancient One to recover. Mordo disguised himself as Sir Clive Bentley, and trapped Doctor Strange with a drugged candle that paralyzed him, but Strange was able to use his mental powers to call a local girl to free him.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #114</ref> He opposed Doctor Strange's discipleship to the Ancient One.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #115</ref> He set a series of new traps for Strange in a bid to wrest magical secrets from the Ancient One.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #117</ref>  Mordo took Strange's body while Strange was astral projecting for a threat he sensed that Mordo had caused, and cast a barrier around it, knowing that if his astral form was out for 24 hours it would die. Strange found it in a [[wax museum]], but was unable to enter. However, Strange took control of a wax model in the last minute, distracting Mordo and enabling Strange to return to his body.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #121</ref> He imprisoned the Ancient One, but was again defeated.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #125</ref> Mordo made a deal with his new master, the demonic [[Dormammu]] of the [[Dark Dimension (comics)|Dark Dimension]], to amass additional power to defeat Doctor Strange.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #130</ref> He dispatched agents, other evil magicians around the World and Spirit wraiths, to search for the incognito Strange,<ref>''Strange Tales'' #131</ref> and then banished him from the Earth.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #132</ref> He fled from Strange,<ref>''Strange Tales'' #134</ref> and then dispatched agents to kill Strange.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #135-136</ref> He engaged in personal combat with Strange.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #139</ref> Mordo was exiled to the Dimension of Demons by Dormammu.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #141</ref> He battled Doctor Strange once more at Stonehenge, but was ultimately banished from Earth.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #159-162</ref>

Mordo would return eventually to continue to bedevil Doctor Strange. He impersonated Doctor Strange during Strange's brief retirement, but was soon vanquished.<ref>''Marvel Feature'' #1</ref> Mordo discovered the Book of Cagliostro, and battled Strange in 18th-Century Paris.  He then accompanied Strange and [[Sise-Neg]] to the dawn of time.<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #13-14</ref> After suffering a mental breakdown, he was placed in Doctor Strange's care, but later escaped.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' #10</ref> Mordo transformed the dead Lord Phyffe into Azrael, angel of death, and dispatched him against Strange.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' #40</ref> He sent the [[Man-Thing]] to kill Strange, and assembled thirteen people for human sacrifice to the Chaos Demon. Mordo was defeated by Strange, [[Jennifer Kale]], and the Man-Thing.<ref>''Man-Thing'' Vol. 2 #4; ''Doctor Strange'' #41</ref> He attacked Strange, and escaped into the 1940s, but was manipulated by Dormammu.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' #49-50</ref>

Mordo later sold his soul to both [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] and [[Satannish]] for power, gaming that Strange would save him. He was trapped with [[Sara Wolfe]], and later rescued her.<ref>''Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme'' #5-8</ref> Mordo himself was later imprisoned, and Sara Wolfe freed him from imprisonment. Mordo battled Dormammu to defend the Earth. He was defeated, and pretended to ally himself with Dormammu, and then allied himself with [[Umar (Marvel Comics)|Umar]] to defeat Dormammu.<ref>''Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme'' #22-23</ref>

Umar and Mordo were eventually deposed by Clea.<ref>''Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme'' #48</ref> Mordo eventually contracted terminal [[cancer]] as a side effect of his use of black magic, and renounced evil just before his death.<ref>''Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme'' #87 (March 1996)</ref> He later returned to life.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #500</ref> He later allies himself with [[Terrax]], [[Tiger Shark (Marvel Comics)|Tiger Shark]] and [[Red Hulk]] as the "Offenders", to be opposed by his old rival and newly costumed Doctor Strange, aided by the other three original Defenders.<ref>''Hulk'' #10</ref>

He then helps Doctor Strange in banishing Dormammu directly to Shuma-Gorath.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' vol. 4 #15-16</ref>

Baron Mordo has vast magical abilities derived from his years of studying black magic and the mystic arts. He can manipulate magical forces for a variety of effects, including hypnotism, mesmerism, thought-casting, and illusion casting. He can separate his astral form from his body, allowing him to become intangible and invisible to most beings. He can project deadly force blasts using magic, can teleport inter-dimensionally, and can manipulate many forms of magical energy. He can tap extra-dimensional energy by invoking entities or objects of power existing in dimensions tangential to Earth's through the recitation of spells. He can also summon demons, but often does not have enough power to force them to do what he wants them to do.

Baron Mordo has some knowledge of a karate-like martial art form, and has an extensive knowledge of magical lore.

This led the latter to reject Mordo's attempt to become Sorcerer Supreme. Believing the Ancient One had turned his back on him, Mordo sides with [[Dormammu]] and kills his former master.
