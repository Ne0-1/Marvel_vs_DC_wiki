'''Bat-Mite''' is a [[fictional]] [[comic book]] [[fictional character|character]] who appeared in stories published by [[DC Comics]].  He first appeared in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #267 ([[May]] [[1959]]).

Bat-Mite is an [[imp]] similar to the [[Superman]] villain [[Mr. Mxyzptlk]]. He appears as a small childlike man in an ill-fitting [[Batman]] [[costume]], with a black lightning bolt instead of the Bat-insignia. Bat-Mite possesses near-infinite [[magic (paranormal)|magical powers]] and comes from another dimension, much like Mr. Mxyzptlk. In Bat-Mite's dimension, the resident imps idolize the heroes of the [[DC Universe]] and impersonate them, re-enacting their heroic feats and adventures. Bat-Mite's favorite hero is Batman, and thus the imp visited Batman on various occasions, often setting up strange events so that he could see his hero in action. Despite this, Bat-Mite is more of a nuisance than a [[supervillain]], and often left his hero alone when he realized he had angered his idol again.  Bat-Mite and Mr. Mxyzptlk teamed up four times in the pages of ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' to plague Superman and Batman together, as well.  
    
Bat-Mite regularly appeared in ''Batman'', ''Detective Comics'' and ''World's Finest Comics'' for five years. However in [[1964]], when the Batman titles were revamped with a more serious tone under new editor [[Julius Schwartz]], Bat-Mite vanished along with the other extraneous members of the Batman family such as [[Ace the Bat-Hound]]. After this, only three more Bat-Mite stories were published in the pre-''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' DC Universe: two Bat-Mite/Mr. Mxyzptlk teamups in ''World's Finest Comics'' #152 ([[August]] [[1965]]) and #169 ([[September]] [[1967]]) (which were not edited by Schwartz but by [[Mort Weisinger]]), and "Bat-Mite's New York Adventure" from ''Detective Comics'' #482 ([[February]]-[[March]] [[1979]]), in which the imp visits the DC Comics offices and insists that he be given his own feature in a Batman comic.

After the continuity-revising [[1985]] miniseries ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' was published, Bat-Mite was mostly removed from the Batman comics canon. Bat-Mite made an appearance in the series ''[[Legends of the Dark Knight]]'', although he may have been the [[hallucination]] of a minor character. This version of Bat-Mite later appeared in ''Mitefall'', a one-shot story that was a parody of the "[[Knightfall]]" Batman storyline.  He also appeared in the one-shot comic special ''[[World's Funnest]]'', in which he battles Mr. Mxyzptlk, destroying the pre-Crisis [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]] of DC Comics as well as the post-Crisis DC universe, the universe of [[Kingdom Come (comic)|Kingdom Come]], and the universe of the [[Superman: The Animated Series|Superman]] and [[Batman: The Animated Series|Batman]] animated series. Bat-Mite may or may not have been formally reintroduced into the modern DC Universe in a [[1990s]] ''World's Finest'' miniseries (where he teams up with Mr. Mxyzptlk to "test" Superman and Batman), but this isn't entirely clear.

Apart from ''World's Funnest'', there has been no direct connection between Bat-Mite and Mr. Mxyzptlk; the ''World's Funnest'' special implied that different rules applied to their powers. In the ''[[Bizarro Comics]]'' anthology, Mxyzptlk's native fifth dimension seemed to include beings similar to Bat-Mite and [[Johnny Thunder]]'s Thunderbolt. Neither of these comics are considered canonical, however, in a JLA/JSA crossover in ''[[JLA]]'' and in ''[[JSA]]'' #78-80 it was revealed that both Mxyzptlk and Thunderbolt came from the 5th Dimension. Letter columns and writer interviews indicate that Bat-Mite comes from there as well, although this has never been shown thus far in the comic stories themselves.

Bat-Mite was a regular character of the [[1977]] [[animated series]] ''[[The New Adventures Of Batman]]'' where he was depicted as a well meaning magical fan of the superhero.  As such, he tried to help Batman even though he usually complicated matters.

An [[animatronic]] Bat-Mite briefly appeared in the "Deep Freeze" episode of ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', in which Bat-Mite enthusiastically greeted Batman, saying, "Hi, I'm Bat-Mite!  I'm your biggest fan!" before kissing the Dark Knight, who was not amused.  Then, it malfunctions.

One episode of the animated series ''[[Teen Titans (animated series)|Teen Titans]]'' had the appearance of a very similar character named "Nosyarg Kcid" ("Dick Grayson" spelled backwards) but whom the characters rename Larry for ease. In this episode, "Larry" idolized Robin rather than Batman.
