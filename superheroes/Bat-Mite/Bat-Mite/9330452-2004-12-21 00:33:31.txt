'''Bat-Mite''' is a [[fictional]] [[comic book]] [[character]] from [[DC Comics]].

Bat-Mite is an [[imp]] similar to the [[Superman]] villian [[Mr Mxyzptlk]]. He appears as as small childlike man in an ill-fitting [[Batman]] [[costume]], with a lightning bolt instead of the bat-insignia. Bat-Mite is often portrayed as having near infinite [[magic|magical powers]] though in reality these have a [[scientific]] explaination as he comes from a higher [[dimension]] again similar to Mr. Mxyzptlk who comes from the [[5th Dimension (comics)|5th Dimension]]. In Bat-Mite's dimension the imps idolise the heroes of the DC Universe and impersonate them re-enacting their heroic feats and adventures. Bat-Mite's favourite hero is The [[Batman]] and he will often set up strange events so that he can see his hero in action. Despite this he is more of a nuscience than a [[supervillain]].

[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|pre-crisis]] Bat-Mite was part of the [[canon (fiction)|DC Canon]] but post-crisis his existence is a more tenuous. He has appeared in ''[[Legends of the Dark Knight]]'' although he may have been the [[hallucination]] of a minor character. He also appeared in ''[[World's Funnest]]'' in which he battles Mr. Mxyzptlk, destroying the Pre-crisis [[multiverse]] of DC Comics as well as the post-crisis universe, the universe of [[Kingdom Come (comic)|Kingdom Come]] and the universe of the [[Superman: The Animated Series|Superman]] and [[Batman: The Animated Series|Batman]] Animated series.

Apart from ''World's Funnest'' there has been no direct connection between Bat-Mite and Mr. Mxyzptlk. In fact in this comic there seemed to be different laws applied to their powers. In [[Bizzaro Comics]] Mxyzptlk's with dimension seemed to include beings similar to Bat-Mite. Neither of these comics are considered canon however.
