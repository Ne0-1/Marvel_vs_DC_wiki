'''Bat-Mite''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[comic book]] stories published by [[DC Comics]].  Bat-Mite is an [[Imp]] similar to the [[Superman]] villain [[Mr. Mxyzptlk]]. Appearing as a small childlike man in an ill-fitting costume, Bat-Mite possesses near-infinite magical powers and comes from another dimension, much like Mr. Mxyzptlk. Bat-Mite idolizes Batman, and thus he has visited Batman on various occasions, often setting up strange events so that he could see his hero in action. Bat-Mite is more of a nuisance than a [[supervillain]], and often leaves his hero alone when he realizes he has angered his idol. 
    
==Character history==
Bat-Mite regularly appeared in ''Batman'', ''Detective Comics'', and ''World's Finest Comics'' for five years. Bat-Mite and Mr. Mxyzptlk teamed up four times in the pages of ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' to plague Superman and Batman together, as well. However in [[1964]], when the Batman titles were revamped under new editor [[Julius Schwartz]], Bat-Mite vanished along with the other extraneous members of the Batman family such as [[Ace the Bat-Hound]]. After this, only three more Bat-Mite stories were published in the pre-''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]]'' DC Universe: two Bat-Mite/Mr. Mxyzptlk teamups in ''World's Finest Comics'' #152 (August 1965) and #169 (September 1967) (which were not edited by Schwartz but by [[Mort Weisinger]]), and "Bat-Mite's New York Adventure" from ''Detective Comics'' #482 (February–March 1979), in which the imp visits the DC Comics offices and insists that he be given his own feature in a Batman comic. This story featured protestors with [[picket signs]] shouting "We want Bat-Mite!" outside the [[Tishman Building]] (where DC's editorial offices were located at the time), and was accompanied by an editorial comment that this story was published specifically to acknowledge the actual requests of fans for this character's revival.

After the continuity-changing 1985 [[limited series]] ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' was published, Bat-Mite was mostly removed from the Batman comics canon. Bat-Mite made an appearance in the series ''[[Legends of the Dark Knight]]'', although he may have been the [[hallucination]] of a drug-addled criminal named Bob Overdog. This version of Bat-Mite later appeared in ''Mitefall'', a [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] book which was a parody of the "[[Knightfall]]" Batman storyline (with Overdog in the [[Azrael (comics)|Jean-Paul Valley]] role). In #6 of the 1999 ''World's Finest'' miniseries, Mr. Mxyzptlk encountered Bat-Mite, shortly after being mistaken for him by Overdog. While in this story the post-Crisis Bat-Mite encountered Batman for the first time, Superman and Batman subsequently concluded that Mxyzptlk had created him, inspired by Overdog's ravings.

Bat-Mite also appeared in the 2000 one-shot [[Elseworlds]] comic special ''[[World's Funnest]]'', in which he battles Mr. Mxyzptlk, destroying the pre-Crisis [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]] and the Post-Crisis Universe of DC Comics, as well as the Elseworlds of ''[[Kingdom Come (comic)|Kingdom Come]]'', ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]'', and the [[DC Animated Universe]]. Despite being an Elseworlds story itself, it is not clear whether ''World's Funnest'' is in continuity.

Apart from ''World's Finest'', there has been no direct connection between Bat-Mite and Mr. Mxyzptlk. In the ''[[Bizarro Comics]]'' anthology, Mxyzptlk's native 5th Dimension seemed to include beings similar to Bat-Mite and [[Johnny Thunder]]'s Thunderbolt. Neither of these comics are considered canonical; however, in a JLA/JSA crossover in ''[[JLA]]'' and in ''[[Justice Society of America|JSA]]'' #78–80 it was revealed that both Mxyzptlk and Thunderbolt come from the 5th Dimension. Letter columns and writer interviews indicate that Bat-Mite comes from there as well, although this has never been shown thus far in the comic stories themselves. 

In the post-Crisis issue ''Superman/Batman'' #25, it was revealed that [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]] had gained Bat-Mite's powers by absorbing his essence; at the end, [[Bizarro]] was able to free him.  As such Bat-Mite has been fully re-established into the current continuity, though his exact connection or whether he idolizes Batman like he previously did, has not been established.

The most recent significant appearance of Bat-Mite was in Batman #672, written by [[Grant Morrison]].  Batman is confronted with Bat-Mite after being shot in the chest and suffering a heart attack.  This version of Bat-mite looks significantly creepier than the original. It is not currently clear what purpose he will serve in the ongoing series. 

Bat-Mite can be seen peeking through one of the windows on the cover of #2 in the 2007-08 
"Gotham Underground" limited series but it is unknown whether this is just a cameo or whether he will actually appear in the series.

==Alternate versions==
*In Frank Miller's ''[[The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'', Bat-Mite is one of the co-founders of 'The First Church of the Last Son of Krypton', a Lunatic Fringe dedicated to worshipping [[Superman]] as God, stating: 'So you're saying your guy can walk on water and heal the sick, and you're calling '''Us''' crazy?'

Bat-Mite was a regular character of the 1977 [[animated series]] ''[[The New Adventures of Batman]]'' where he was depicted as a well meaning magical fan of the superhero.  As such, he tried to help Batman even though he usually complicated matters. One episode featured his home planet, called Ergo, as well as a villain of Bat-Mite's species named Zarbor. He also has a crush on [[Batgirl]]. Bat-Mite was voiced by [[Lou Scheimer]].

An [[animatronic]] Bat-Mite briefly appeared in the "[[Deep Freeze (Batman: The Animated Series)|Deep Freeze]]" episode of ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', in which Bat-Mite enthusiastically greeted Batman, saying, "Hi, Dynamic Duo!  I'm your biggest fan!" before kissing Robin, who was shocked. It then malfunctions and falls apart, stuttering "I just wanna help!" as it does so. In the background, an animatronic [[Mr. Mxyzptlk]], [[Streaky the Supercat]] and [[Krypto|Krypto the Superdog]] can also be seen.

One episode of the animated series ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' had the appearance of a very similar character named "nosyarG kciD" ("[[Dick Grayson]]" spelled backwards) but whom the characters rename [[Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series)#Larry the Titan|Larry]] for ease. In this episode, "Larry" idolized Robin rather than Batman. He also claims to be his dimension's incarnation of Robin (hence the name), and they are proven to be genetically identical, thus giving the identity of Robin to be Dick Grayson.
