'''Bat-Mite''' is a fictional [[Character (arts)|character]] appearing in stories published by [[DC Comics]].  Bat-Mite is an [[Imp]] similar to the [[Superman]] villain [[Mister Mxyzptlk]]. Appearing as a small childlike man in an ill-fitting costume, Bat-Mite possesses what appears to be near-infinite magical power, but in reality is highly advanced technology from the fifth-dimension that can not be understood by our limited three-dimensional views. Bat-Mite idolizes Batman, and thus he has visited Batman on various occasions, often setting up strange events so that he could see his hero in action. Bat-Mite is more of a nuisance than a [[supervillain]], and often leaves his hero alone when he realizes he has angered his idol.<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation  | last = Beatty  | first = Scott | author-link = Scott Beatty | contribution = Bat-Mite | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 39  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = London  | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5}}</ref>
    
==Fictional character history==
===Pre-Crisis===
Bat-Mite regularly appeared in ''Batman'', ''Detective Comics'', and ''World's Finest Comics'' for five years. Bat-Mite and Mr. Mxyzptlk teamed up four times in the pages of ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' to plague Superman and Batman together, as well. In 1964, however, when the Batman titles were revamped under new editor [[Julius Schwartz]], Bat-Mite vanished along with the other extraneous members of the Batman family such as [[Ace the Bat-Hound]]. After this, only three more Bat-Mite stories were published in the pre-''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]]'' DC Universe: two Bat-Mite/Mr. Mxyzptlk team ups in ''World's Finest Comics'' #152 (August 1965) and #169 (September 1967) (which were not edited by Schwartz but by [[Mort Weisinger]]), and "Bat-Mite's New York Adventure" from ''Detective Comics'' #482 (February–March 1979), in which the imp visits the DC Comics offices and insists that he be given his own feature in a Batman comic. This story featured protestors with [[Picketing (protest)|picket signs]] shouting "We want Bat-Mite!" outside the [[666 Fifth Avenue|Tishman Building]] (where DC's editorial offices were located at the time), and was accompanied by an editorial comment that this story was published specifically to acknowledge the actual requests of fans for this character's revival.

Later Bat-Mite appeared in a one-page story in the 200th issue of ''The Brave and the Bold''.

===Post-Crisis===
After the continuity-changing 1985 [[limited series]] ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' was published, Bat-Mite was mostly removed from the Batman comics canon. Bat-Mite made an appearance in the series ''[[Legends of the Dark Knight]]'', although he may have been the [[hallucination]] of a drug-addled criminal named Bob Overdog. This version of Bat-Mite later appeared in ''Mitefall'', a [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] book which was a parody of the "[[Batman: Knightfall|Knightfall]]" Batman storyline (with Overdog in the [[Azrael (comics)|Jean-Paul Valley]] role). In #6 of the 1999 ''World's Finest'' miniseries, Mr. Mxyzptlk encountered Bat-Mite, shortly after being mistaken for him by Overdog. While in this story the post-Crisis Bat-Mite encountered Batman for the first time, Superman and Batman subsequently concluded that Mxyzptlk had created him, inspired by Overdog's ravings.

Bat-Mite also appeared in the 2000 one-shot [[Elseworlds]] comic special ''[[Superman and Batman: World's Funnest|World's Funnest]]'', in which he battles Mr. Mxyzptlk, destroying the pre-Crisis [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]] and the Post-Crisis Universe of DC Comics, as well as the Elseworlds of ''[[Kingdom Come (comic book)|Kingdom Come]]'', ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]'', and the [[DC animated universe]]. Despite being an Elseworlds story itself, it is not clear whether ''World's Funnest'' is in continuity.

Apart from ''World's Funnest'', there has been no direct connection between Bat-Mite and Mr. Mxyzptlk. In the ''Bizarro Comics'' anthology, Mxyzptlk's native 5th Dimension seemed to include beings similar to Bat-Mite and [[Johnny Thunder]]'s Thunderbolt. Neither of these comics are considered canonical; however, in a JLA/JSA crossover in ''[[Justice League|JLA]]'' and in ''[[Justice Society of America|JSA]]'' #78–80 it was revealed that both Mxyzptlk and Thunderbolt come from the 5th Dimension. [[Comic book letter column|Letter columns]] and writer interviews indicate that Bat-Mite comes from there as well, although this has never been shown thus far in the comic stories themselves. 

In the post-Crisis issue ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' #25, it was revealed that [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]] had gained Fifth Dimensional powers by maintaining the essence of Mr. Mxyzptlk from the earlier "Emperor Joker" storyline; at the end, [[Bizarro]] was able to extract this latent magical essence from the Joker, which manifested in a form recognizable as Bat-Mite.  As such, a Bat-Mite has been fully reestablished into the current continuity as an outgrowth of Mr. Mxyzptlk incubated within the Joker. 

The first Post-[[Infinite Crisis]] appearance of Bat-Mite was in ''Batman'' #672, written by [[Grant Morrison]].  Batman is confronted with Bat-Mite (or "Might") after being shot in the chest and suffering a heart attack. Might, who bears a green [[insectoid]] creature on his back, claims to have come from "Space B at the Fivefold Expansion of Zrfff" (''Batman'' #674) (At times Zrfff has been used as the name of Mr. Mxyzptlk's home dimension). Only Batman sees him. As Batman is having an increasingly difficult time keeping his grip on reality during this period, it is possible that Might is a mental delusion. 

In ''Batman'' #678, Might reappears at the last page, commenting, "uh-oh" to Batman's increasing delusions. He then, throughout the whole ''Batman R.I.P.'' series, appears to counsel the ''[[Batman of Zur-En-Arrh]]'', a delusional personality manufactured by Bruce himself to keep Batman able to fight in case he was [[mindwipe]]d, or driven to insanity. ''Batman'' #680 reveals that Might is indeed a product of Batman's imagination being Batman's rationale, although he comments that he is from the 5th dimension because the fifth dimension is imagination.

In ''Superman/Batman'' #52, Bat-Mite appears having had a bet with Mr. Mxyzptlk similar to that of ''World's Funnest''. This Bat-Mite appears to admire Batman, and Batman addresses him with familiarity.

==Other versions==
In Frank Miller's ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again|The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'', Bat-Mite is one of the co-founders of 'The First Church of the Last Son of Krypton', a Lunatic Fringe dedicated to worshiping [[Superman]] as God; its founders clearly include Bat-Mite, who urges their followers to "Put your hand in the hand of the man with Heat Vision."

In ''[[Superman & Batman: Generations]]'', he appears in 1959, along with [[Mister Mxyzptlk]]. The two imps are testing [[Batman]] and [[Superman]], each trying to prove that their hero is the greatest. They are doing so in order for two aliens to take the greatest hero to the other side of the universe to save their planet (Bat-Mite is doing so because he truly wants to help, Mxy is doing so merely because it would take Superman centuries to return from the other side of the universe). However, each one must test the other's hero, so Mxy tests Batman, and vice-versa. After a huge battle, the aliens decide to take Bat-Mite and Mxy back to their planet.

In ''[[Batman: Dark Victory]]'', the name Bat-Mite is used on a possible costume design sketched by a young [[Dick Grayson]], as he tries to come up with a secret identity to fight alongside Batman.

In ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke]]'' Bat-Mite can be seen in a picture inside the [[Batcave]].

In ''[[JLA: The Nail]]'' Bat-Mite can be seen frozen inside an ice chunk in the Batcave.

* Bat-Mite was a regular character of the 1977 [[Filmation]] [[List of animated television series|animated series]] ''[[The New Adventures of Batman]]'' voiced by [[Lou Scheimer]]. He was depicted as a well meaning magical fan of the superhero. As such, he tried to help Batman even though he usually complicated matters, with a whiny "All I wanna do is help!" as a near-catchphrase. One episode featured his home planet, called Ergo, as well as a villain of Bat-Mite's species named Zarbor. He also has a crush on [[Batgirl]]. 

* An [[Audio-Animatronics|animatronic]] Bat-Mite briefly appeared in the "Deep Freeze" episode of ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' voiced by [[Pat Fraley]]. Bat-Mite enthusiastically greeted Batman, saying, "Greetings, Dynamic Duo! I'm your biggest fan!" before kissing Robin, who was shocked. It then malfunctions and falls apart, stuttering "I just wanna help!" It is revealed just to be robot toy. In the background, an animatronic [[Mister Mxyzptlk]], [[Streaky the Supercat]], and [[Krypto|Krypto the Superdog]] can also be seen.

* In ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' episode "Fractured," a Bat-Mite counterpart named Larry (voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]) appears. Larry, instead of looking like Batman, looks like [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] and is Robin's biggest fan. His real name is '''NOSYARG KCID''', [[Dick Grayson]] spelled backwards.

* Bat-Mite appeared in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' "Legends of the Dark-Mite!" voiced by [[Paul Reubens]]. He first appears goading some bank robbers and creating more robbers to see Batman in action. He eventually shows himself and makes Batman fight more and more villains, including [[Gorilla Grodd]] (who was reading a book before "dropping in"), [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]], [[Shaggy Man (comics)|Shaggy Man]], and [[Calendar Man]], whom he powers up. After believing he has convinced Bat-Mite to return home, Batman unwittingly insults him which leads to the creature deciding to use him as a toy in a battle against imaginary monsters. Batman is able to escape by convincing Bat-Mite to use his powers to become the Dark Knight himself. In doing so, Bat-Mite comes to understand the peril of Batman's role and agrees to leave in peace. A closing sequence shows him instead stalking [[Green Arrow]]. The episode draws heavily from previous Batman incarnations, including a sequence in which Bat-Mite addresses fan criticism of the show's perceived lighter tone.  Episode writer Paul Dini is shown as one of the convention attendees, dressed as his creation [[Harley Quinn]]. Bat-Mite will return in "The Reign of Emperor Joker!".

===Video Games===
* Bat-Mite is set to appear in the upcoming [[MMORPG]] ''[[DC Universe Online]]''.
