'''Spider-Man 2099''' ('''Miguel O'Hara''') is a [[fictional]] [[comic book]] [[superhero]], created by [[Peter David]] and [[Rick Leonardi]] in [[1992 in comics|1992]] for [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel 2099]] line. His secret alter-ego, Miguel O' Hara, is a brilliant [[genetics|geneticist]] who gains his spider-like powers from a gene-splicing incident.

==Publication history==
Spider-Man 2099 is a direct result of the 30th anniversary of [[Spider-Man]]'s first appearance.  Spider-Man 2099 was one of the many Marvel characters to be re-imagined for the [[Marvel 2099]] comic book line that showed future versions of classic Marvel characters living in the year 2099, a century after the current [[Marvel Universe]] time period (the Marvel 2099 timeline began its run in 1992, approximately 107 years prior to the year in which the new books would take place.) Spider-Man 2099 was first featured in a five page sneak preview of the first issue of his then-upcoming series in the 30th anniversary issue of ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]''.  The ''Spider-Man 2099'' series' first issue appeared shortly afterward.  When originally published, the Marvel 2099 stories were meant to be the official future of the [[Marvel Universe]]: a [[dystopian]] America governed by corrupt corporations. The setting also has a number of [[cyberpunk]] elements.

The character was originally designed by [[Rick Leonardi]], with [[Peter David]] brought onboard to flesh out the character’s alter ego and supporting characters.  ''Spider-Man 2099'' #1 written by Peter David, penciled by Rick Leonardi, inked by [[Al Williamson]], and lettered by [[Rick Parker]].<ref>''Spider-Man 2099'' Vol. 1, #1 (November 1992), Marvel Comics</ref> Peter David has said that ''Spider-Man 2099'' #1 is the highest selling single issue of any comic he has ever written.<ref> [[Looking Back: Spider-Man 2099]] http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=1009</ref>

Although the book was continuously selling more than 100,000 copies per issue, the book and entire 2099 comic line underwent a drastic shift in early 1996, with the firing of the 2099 series editor [[Joey Cavalieri]]. At this time, Marvel’s finances and future were unstable, and sudden firings were quite common. Like virtually all of the other writers in the line, Peter David chose to show solidarity with his editor, and resigned from the book with issue #44.<ref>Peter David. "But I Digress..." ''Comics Buyer's Guide'' #1269; March 13, 1998; Page 78</ref>

Marvel turned the remaining issues over to fill-in writers and editors, and wrapped up the ''Spider-Man 2099'' series with issue #46.  A few months later, demonstrating the popularity of the 2099 imprint, Marvel announced they would publish a new 2099 title, ''[[2099: World of Tomorrow]]'', immediately following the last issues of the original titles, using the new staff.  The new bi-monthly title lasted eight issues and served for the most part as the finale for the series, and the end of regular publication of the 2099 comic line.

Spider-Man 2099's alter ego was seen again without a costume in 1998 in ''2099: Manifest Destiny'', a 2099 wrap-up one shot issue that was meant to bring a complete closure to the line and fixed problems and unsolved storylines.  The character has since made several cameo and guest appearances in such titles as ''[[Genis-Vell|Captain Marvel]]'' (vol. 4) #27-30 (written by Peter David) and most recently on ''[[Exiles]]'' #75-99. <ref> [[2099 Comicboards Checklist]] http://www.comicboards.com/2099ug/moderator/Exhaustive%202099%20comic%20checklist.html</ref>  It was announced in January 2009 that Marvel would be publishing a collected edition of the first ten issues of the original series in April.<ref>{{cite|author=CBR News Editor|title=CBR News - Marvel Solicitations, April 2009| publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] website|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=19606 | date=21 January 2009|accessdate=21 January 2009}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
===Young Miguel O'Hara ===
Miguel O'Hara was born in [[New York City]] after the end of what came to be known as the "Heroic Age."  He grew up with his eccentric mother, Conchata, younger brother Gabriel, and the abusive man he believed to be his father, George.  Brilliant and precocious, Miguel was awarded enrollment in the Alchemax School for Gifted Youngsters (not officially said but believed to be the original [[X-Mansion|X-Men's headquarters]]) in Westchester under the direction of headmistress Angela Daskalakis.  Here, he befriended Xina Kwan, who helped Miguel defend himself against the bullying of Kron Stone, son of Alchemax's Vice President of Research and Development, [[Tyler Stone (comics)|Tyler Stone]].  With Xina's encouragement, Miguel mustered the bravery to have Kron expelled from the school.<ref>''Spider-Man 2099'' #25–30, #32–34 (1994–1995), Marvel Comics</ref>

Years later, as young adults, Miguel and Xina dated until Miguel cheated on her with Gabriel's girlfriend, Dana D'Angelo.<ref>''Spider-Man 2099'' #37  (November 1995) Marvel Comics</ref>  In time, Miguel and Dana were engaged.  Confident and smugly self-assured, Miguel became project head of the genetics program of Alchemax, performing research inspired by the [[Spider-Man]] of the Heroic Age involving alterations of animals' genetic structure.  After an incident in which a convicted prisoner used as a test subject dies, Miguel started to doubt the goings on at Alchemax and decides to quit.

=== Origin ===
Told he was poisoned by [[Tyler Stone (comics)|Tyler Stone]] with a permanently addictive drug called Rapture for quitting Alchemax, Miguel tried to purge his body clean on a genetic level in his laboratory.  He needed to act quickly as he thought that once the drug was bound to his system, he would need it for the rest of his life.  Since only Alchemax legally sold the drug, Miguel would have been forced to continue employment at Alchemax or buy the drug through the black market.  His experiment to genetically reset his body was sabotaged by his jealous supervisor, Aaron Delgato, accidentally endowing Miguel with fantastic spider-like abilities.  After an explosion in the lab, Delgato apparently fell to his death while Miguel fled, realizing his new powers as he avoided the Alchemax-sponsored Public Eye security patrol.<ref>''Spider-Man 2099'' #1</ref>  A Thorite (worshipper of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]), aided Miguel's escape, deeming "Spider-Man's" return as an omen of his god's return, and immediately labeled Miguel's alter-ego with an epithet that would follow him for much of his career: The Harbinger of Thor.<ref>''Spider-Man 2099'' #2</ref>

Tyler Stone hired the cyborg bounty-hunter named Venture to investigate the incident.  With Venture in pursuit, Miguel returned to his home at the Babylon Towers apartment building, and concealed his identity in a full-body costume acquired in a prior trip with his brother at a Mexican [[Day of the Dead]] festival.  After a fierce assault, Spider-Man shredded Venture's circuitry.  Upon recounting the events to his quirky holo-agent (holographic assistant) Lyla, Miguel realized his uncertain future.<ref>''Spider-Man 2099'' #3 Marvel Comics</ref>

===Heroic career===
With Stone feigning ignorance of Miguel's transformation, Miguel returned to work, hopeful to find a cure for his condition; but Miguel gradually discovered the importance of Spider-Man in his world, where his own employer was a major source of corruption and oppression. He helped rescue Karyn "Kasey" Nash, Gabriel's girlfriend, after she was kidnapped by a Zaibatsu Samurai, the [[Specialist (comics)|Specialist]], for Alchemax to perform human experimentation. Spider-Man's victory over the Specialist earned him the enmity of another major corporation, Stark-Fujikawa, and left him plummeting below the elevated city into Downtown, the realm of the forgotten and undesirables of Nueva York,<ref>''Spider-Man 2099'' Vol. 1, No 4-5 (1993) Marvel Comics</ref> independent of the major corporations' control but ruled by gangs. Here, Spider-Man encountered the cruel Watchdogs and Fenris gangs, the hopeful Thorites, the justice seeking Throwbacks, and the largest gang, the Freakers, with their cannibalistic leader, the Vulture. Spider-Man rejected the Vulture's offer to join his crusade against Alchemax, and after a vicious battle aided by Kasey, Gabriel and the Throwbacks, he retreated home. While he was away, Dana was approached by Tyler to partner with her firm, Synthia, and Alchemax. Miguel had discovered that Spider-Man had become a hero to his institutionalized mother (alone after George died) and inspiration for the Spiderite cult of costumed followers.<ref>''Spider-Man 2099'' Vol. 1, No 6-9 (1993) Marvel Comics</ref>

===''Spider-Man 2099 Meets Spider-Man''===
In the 1995 [[one-shot]] book, ''Spider-Man 2099 Meets Spider-Man'', Miguel and Peter Parker, the [[Spider-Man]] of the Heroic Age, find themselves having switched places, with Miguel waking up next to Peter's wife, [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane]], and Spider-Man finding himself in the future. They discover that their predicament is caused by Fujikawa (in the Modern Age) and Stark-Fujikawa (in the year 2099) running experiments on a temporal energy generator. While Peter tackles the Vulture of 2099, Miguel faces [[Eddie Brock|Venom (Eddie Brock)]]. The two Spider-Men were united to face the twisted time-traveling Hobgoblin of the year 2211 (Robin Borne) from the alternate universe of [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Earth-9500]]. Hobgoblin's father, [[Spider-Man 2211|Spider-Man (Max Borne)]] deflects her Retcon bombs into the time energy generators, and the ensuing explosion sends everyone back to their respective times.<ref>Peter David. ''Spider-Man 2099 Meets Spider-Man'' (1995) Marvel Comics</ref>

In the weeks that follow, Miguel becomes more comfortable in his role as a costumed defender. He halts the attacks of the hyper-adaptable Mutagen (Gerald Bernardson),<ref>''2099 Unlimited'' #1</ref> protects the city from disaster from a reawakened Cold War Russian super soldier, Chernobyl,{{Issue|date=April 2009}} wrestles himself free from electronically transmitted mind control by Macroware software developer Dr. Damian Fawcett,{{Issue|date=April 2009}} clashes with a specially trained agent heavily armed with SItuation Emergency GEar (SIEGE),{{Issue|date=April 2009}} and defends Dana from the monstrous Man-Spider (Antoine Tarantella).{{Issue|date=April 2009}} He battled Tyler Stone, Alchemax, and Stark-Fujikawa.<ref>''Spider-Man 2099'' #9</ref>

=== The Net Prophet & Thanatos===
{{Refimprove|section|date=April 2009}}
The mysterious amnesiac Net Prophet (formerly [[Justice (New Universe)|Justice, John Roger Tensen]] of [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Earth-148611)]] was liberated from Interspace after the Virtual Unreality experiments of Euromax transfer, the pretentious scientist [[Halloween Jack|Jordan Boone]], lured the nigh-unstoppable [[Thanatos (comics)|Thanatos]] (a Destiny-Force powered megalomaniac Rick Jones of [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Earth-9309]]) to Alchemax, where he kidnapped Tyler Stone and Spider-Man, and after the two defended Dana's sister, Jennifer D'Angleo, in Downtown against the Fenris gang, Tensen opted to explore the world.<ref>''Spider-Man 2099'' #11</ref>

When Spider-Man battled the savage Bloodsword and the Fenris gang Downtown, back home Lyla began malfunctioning, while at Alchemax Stone made romantic advances towards Dana. Upon his return, Miguel with Dana visited Alchemax's floating city, Valhalla, where it appeared that Thor and [[Heimdall (comics)|Heimdall]] had returned, though lacking the nobility of their Heroic Age counterparts. Alchemax CEO, Avatarr, had transformed ordinary people into the Aesir, loyal to the corporation, in order to eliminate the rising super heroic interference. With help from [[Doom 2099|Doom]], [[Ravage 2099|Ravage]], [[The Punisher 2099|Punisher (Jake Gallows)]], the [[X-Men 2099|X-Men]] and [[Halloween Jack|Loki (a transformed Jordan Boone)]], the Aesir were defeated. 
While Miguel tried to get back to a normal life, Lyla attacked Dana out of apparent jealously. She and the rest of the city were victims of the mad cyberspace entity named Discord, trying to "ease humanity into Armageddon". After saving Stark-Fujikawa's head, Hikaru-Sama, Miguel joined Gabriel (as "Firelight") in Cyberspace and defeated Discord. Afterwards, Gabriel admitted to his brother that he knew his secret identity from the start, recognizing the costume from the [[Day of the Dead|Mexican festival]].

=== The Time Flies Saga===
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2009}}
[[Genis-Vell|Captain Marvel (Genis-Vell)]] and a critically injured [[Starfox (comics)|Starfox]] of the Heroic Age of [[Earth-616]] were sent to 2099. After encountering Spider-Man, [[Genis-Vell|Captain Marvel]] located Miguel to act as their guide. At Alchemax they battled [[Thanatos (comics)|Thanatos]], sending the three into the Dystopian alternate future of [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Earth-9200]] ruled by evil future [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], [[Maestro (Marvel Comics)|Maestro]], the other heroes defeated [[Thanatos (comics)|Thanatos]], returning everyone back to their original timeline. 

Meanwhile, Kasey was kidnapped by SIEGE for Stark-Fujikawa and, as a repayment of Hikaru-Sama's debt, transformed into Payback, a [[cyborg]] warrior designed to be a worthy associate of Spider-Man. Fighting against Risque, Venture’s cyborg sister, Payback failed, leaving Spider-Man alone to defeat the villain. Gabriel was beaten by Alchemax' Flyboys as they arrested Kasey. While Miguel eavesdropped, Conchatta confronted [[Tyler Stone (comics)|Tyler]] to release Kasey, blackmailing him with evidence that he killed his ex-wife, Nancy. There, Miguel learned the truth that the Rapture he was given was only a short-lasting simulation and that Tyler Stone was really his father. Miguel left profoundly disturbed. 

Xina, Lyla's creator, repaired the holo-agent, spitefully programming her to insult Dana. Offended, Dana accused the emotionally raw Miguel of dating Xina again; after an explosive fight, Miguel and Dana broke up. Later, Spider-Man battled the mercenary android Vlad the Impaler targeting a boy named Gedde O'Hara (mistakenly believed by Miguel to be targeting his brother Gabriel O'Hara), and after Woodstock 2099 fought against Major Jones, a dealer peddling a metamorphosis-enabling drug called Chameleon. For a vacation, Miguel and Xina visited Nightshade, an independent corporation run by their old headmistress, Angela, when Alchemax performed a literal hostile takeover via Mr. Pembert, the Corporate Headhunter, and the six Corporate Raiders. Though the monstrous genetically manipulated ex-Flyboy, Sgt. Rico Estevez (Subject 394, a.k.a Travesty), and Spider-Man defended Nightshade, the Raiders succeeded, killing Angela in the process. 
Packrat and his scavenger gang of Foragers descended upon the ruins of Nightshade, kidnapping Spider-Man. The gang offered Spider-Man a means of freedom if he fixed an old robot named Junior. The android, apparently the inert body of a [[Super-Adaptoid]], recognized something in Spider-Man, and awakened as an amalgam of O'Hara's Spider-Man with Spider-Man and [[Venom (comics)|Venom]] from the Heroic Age. Calling itself Flipside, it behaved like an emotionally unstable psychopath. Heroically, Spider-Man saved his captor's life, leaving Flipside shredded and decapitated; however, after Spider-Man departed, Filpside reassembled itself and resumed its assault on Packrat’s gang. On Miguel’s walk home through the desert, he was assaulted and exhausted, having what appeared to be a horrific nightmare before Xina rescued him.

===Doctor Strange===
Miguel and Xina attempted another vacation in [[Mexico City]], where they ran into Gabriel and Kasey (who believed Gabe was secretly Spider-Man). There a man named Fernando Morgez performed an arcane ritual to revive his dead sister Anita, inadvertently summoning zombies from a local graveyard instead. Spider-Man, temporarily blinded by Morgez' spell due to his sensitive eyes, teamed with the Sorceress Supreme, Strange, to end the undead invasion. Distraught over his failure to make amends for his sister's accidental death, Morgez committed suicide. The four returned back home seeking some normalcy; instead, they found the country had been overtaken by [[Doom 2099|Doom]], who sent federal officers to abduct Miguel from Xina's car.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

===One Nation Under Doom ===
Taken to the White House, Miguel impressed President [[Doom 2099|Doom]] with his confidence. With all megacorps nationalized under Doom’s control and Avartarr dead, Tyler Stone became Doom’s corporate Minister, while Stone offered Miguel his seat as CEO of Alchemax.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Later, as Spider-Man assisted protesting Spiderites brutalized by federal Watchdogs, Doom offered him a cabinet position as Minister of Supernormal Affairs.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Disgusted with Tyler and his dubious relationship with Dana, Conchatta surprised Tyler at his apartment and shot him twice.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

===The Venom Saga ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2009}}
In Neuva York, the battle cries of Bloodmace (formerly Bloodsword and Bloodaxe) against "leaderless" Alchemax were abbreviated by the return of the [[Venom symbiote]], which engulfed him in an acid-excreting ebony shroud, leaving behind only a skeleton. Venom traveled to confront the hospitalized Tyler, burning Miguel and slashing Dana. Spider-Man and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents engaged in fierce combat to protect Stone from Venom, but the monster escaped. Miguel, accepting his promotion, decided to use his position to forge a new direction for Alchemax, and to protect his alter-ego by ordering S.H.I.E.L.D. reps to leave Spider-Man alone. Venom resurfaced and kidnapped both Dana and Xina; Venom released Xina, while Miguel severed Venom’s arm. After Venom escaped, grabbing Xina again, Miguel authorized S.H.I.E.L.D. to use lethal force. Miguel returned to find Venom had taken Dana again and fled, forcing Xina to drive her car. The battle culminated at the visually askew place called the [[M. C. Escher|Escher]] Club, where Miguel had first met Dana. Dana shoved Venom, allowing Xina to escape, but was killed by S.H.I.E.L.D. bullets passing through Venom. While Venom eluded the authorities, Dana died in Spider-Man's arms. 

Miguel returned to Alchemax, demanding answers from his researchers on how to stop Venom. Studying a piece of the symbiote, Miguel realized the symbiote was averse to sound. Broadcasting high intensity sound through the public speaker system, Spider-Man tackled the weakened Venom, discovering that beneath the symbiote was his half-brother, Kron Stone. Miguel separated Kron from the symbiote and forced a confession out of him. After being left for dead by the Punisher, Kron had encountered and bonded with the mutated symbiote, which had been sitting dormant in the sewers for some time. Kron faked his own death, and upon hearing his father had survived an assassination attempt, he had sought to complete the murder.

===The Goblin ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2009}}
Meanwhile, Downtown, the Vulture and the mysterious Goblin attacked Kasey Nash, out to prove Spider-Man was allied with Alchemax and the corporate establishment. Summoned Downtown by Gabriel, Spider-Man battled the Goblin. Struggling against the Goblin’s hallucinogenic attack, Spider-Man barely escaped with his life. The Goblin rallied Downtown’s citizens against Spider-Man by projecting images of Spider-Man (taken out of context) implicating him as a corporate flunky. Spider-Man left, disgusted by the ingratitude, to find President Doom’s sovereignty at an end as evident by fragments of his Environmental Maintenance Platforms (EMPs) fallen from the sky. 
After Dana’s funeral, wheelchair bound Tyler Stone attempted to return as CEO of Alchemax. Miguel refused to yield, stating his intention to run a compassionate corporation to serve people, and ejected Stone from the building. Tyler’s attempt to shock Miguel with the knowledge of his paternity had no effect. Miguel discovered that his time as Spider-Man had brought out the best in him, and it was time to become a hero out of costume as well. At Alchemax, Miguel was joined by his brazen mother as the best candidate for his personal assistant, handling even the violent Grunt Union representative, Boru. 

Union problems became a minor issue for Miguel when communications with the New Atlantis project, Alchemax's undersea research and habitation endeavor, were severed. Miguel learned that Alchemax had been exploiting the undersea mutates, using them for slave labor. The mutates, under leadership of one called Marriner, broke free; and Roman, who modeled himself after the legendary Sub-Mariner, rebelled. Torn between corporate loyalties and ethical treatment of the mutates, Miguel opted to attempt peaceful negotiations; however, Roman took the initiative to launch an offensive, flooding Nueva York and dispatching a leviathan, [[Giganto]]. Spider-Man incapacitated and captured Roman, and sent the sea-monster home. Via holovid, Tyler confronted Conchata about her assassination attempt, telling Miguel he's his father, and admitting he knew all along Miguel was Spider-Man. These revelations, however, actually brought Miguel and his mother closer.

===The Beginning of the End ===
Trying to reach Jennifer from the flooded Downtown, Spider-Man fought the Goblin. The Goblin revealed himself to be Gabriel, motivated by jealously for his brother. Chaos reigned in the city as the Atlanteans waged war while the Vulture set charges to demolish the Alchemax building. As Tyler attempted to flee to a Martian colony, he was killed by the Atlantean, General Dagim. As Spider-Man and Fr. Jennifer made their escape, Conchatta was believed to have been killed and Alchemax was destroyed. Miguel later learned that Gabriel was innocent, since a shape-shifter took over Gabriel’s life for a time and played the role of the Goblin. Pronouncement of Conchatta's death was premature, and she later worked to identify the shapeshifter.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

===2099 World Of Tomorrow ===
After the polar ice caps melted, a massive deluge killed most of the world's inhabitants. The remnants faced a new threat from space from the techno-organic Phalanx. Spider-Man worked together with Doom, whose foresight ended the invasion at the cost of his life.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

===2099 Manifest Destiny ===
{{Refimprove|section|date=April 2009}}
As society rebuilt itself, Miguel reopened Alchemax and married Xina, Together they reawakened [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]], offering him [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'s hammer, [[Mjolnir (Marvel Comics)|Mjolnir]]. Jettisoned into space, Rogers passed Mjolnir back to Miguel, deemed worthy to lift the hammer. Though not physically transformed, Miguel became heir to awesome power. Secretly aided by the Cyberspace persona [[Ghost Rider 2099|Zero Cochrane 2.0]], Miguel ruled for the next thousand years, ushering in an unprecedented age of enlightenment. Peace, morality and progress spread from Earth to the surrounding worlds. In 3099, Rogers was once again revived and received the hammer, leaving Miguel to retire. Miguel O'Hara's journey from a cowardly, arrogant youth to super-hero to galactic leader and icon was at an end.<ref>[[Marvel Universe: the Official Marvel Wiki: Marvel Universe Spider-Man (2099)]] http://www.marvel.com/universe/Spider-Man_%282099%29</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Miguel O'Hara was the subject of genetic imprinting with spider DNA. Spider-Man 2099's hybrid human/spider physiology gives him a wide array of powers. He has the proportionate strength, speed and agility of a spider, which allows him to lift many times his own body weight, perform complicated acrobatic and gymnastic maneuvers that would be impossible for even the most highly-trained athlete, and jump great distances. His durability was also increased to a point where in an issue he suffered a punctured lung, broken ribs, major abrasions and bruises, and made it to a hospital in time where a doctor told him he has amazing constitution for him to be alive. His metabolism allows him to heal faster than a normal human, although he does not have a true [[healing factor]]. Notably absent from his suite of powers is a "Spider-Sense". Despite this fact, Spider-Man 2099 seems nearly as flexible, acrobatic, and evasive as his namesake. Though he claims to not have been in a fight since he was a child, Miguel quickly develops an effective fighting style that capitalizes on his unique abilities as well as his genius-level intelligence.

[[spinneret (spider)|Spinnerets]] in his forearms enable him to fire an organic spider-webbing-like substance from the top of his wrists, usable in a wide variety of ways. Like his predecessor, Spider-Man 2099 can travel at high speeds swinging on "weblines" when necessary, and he can use his webbing to ensnare enemies. Retractable talons in his fingertips and toes enable him to climb most surfaces or rend substances up to and including cinderblock. Though they are rather short (approximately an inch long), they are extremely sharp, and seem strong enough to resist breakage despite his enhanced strength — Miguel has shown capable of rending metal armor on numerous occasions. These talons acted instinctively at first, and it took practice to retract them properly (making short work of his bedsheets while sleeping). They automatically retract on contact with Miguel's skin.

He possesses venom glands and [[fangs|pronounced, pointed canine teeth]], which allows him to paralyze his foes should he choose to bite them. While the exact makeup of his venom has never been discussed, it seems powerful enough to affect such foes as Thanatos — and it differs from real spider venom in that it does not seem to act as a digestive agent in addition to its paralytic properties.

Compensating for his lack of a "Spider-Sense", his hearing exceeds the acuity of a normal human, as does his vision — he can see extremely well over both long distances ("telescopic" vision) and in low-light conditions and even pitch darkness. In addition to the generally enhanced properties of his vision, the [[flicker fusion threshold]] of his retinas is reduced to such an extent that he can easily perceive fast-moving objects that would appear to others as a blur. A side effect of his visual enhancements are the color of his eyes — they are generally drawn as having red irises, making sunglasses a regular part of Miguel's wardrobe. When trying to perform "damage control" with his girlfriend early on in the original series, Miguel told Dana that as a result of breaking his genetically-coded Rapture addiction, his eyes were now more sensitive to light and that his jaw hurt (allowing him to more easily hide his red eyes and pointed teeth).

His web cape, which he obtained from a Thorite (worshipper of Thor), is made from an [[anti-gravity]] material called "Lyte Byte", commonly used in the manufacturing of hang-gliders in 2099, and acts as an air foil, allowing him to glide on air currents for a short period of time, as well as slow his rate of descent and control his direction in freefall. Coupled with his superhuman strength and agility, the Lite-Byte cloth allows him near-immunity to damage from falls - on numerous occasions, he has leapt from the top of tall buildings with no apparent ill effects upon landing.

Miguel is also a highly skilled geneticist, with an advanced degree in genetics.

==Other versions==
===Destiny War===
Another version of Spider-Man 2099 was one of the alternate [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] seen briefly during The Destiny War, in ''Avengers Forever'' #12.

===2998 AD===
In ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #439, the issue takes place 1,000 years (2998 based on the release date of the issue) in the future.  Two archaeologists stumble across relics belonging to Spider-Man (such as his webshooters).  They speculate on his career, and discuss the other heroes who were inspired by him, such as [[Spider-Girl]], Spider-Man 2099, and [[Spider-Man 2211]].

===''What The''===
In issue #26 of [[What The--?!]], a humor anthology title, the character [[Spider-Ham]] (an [[anthropomorphic]] pig who [[parody|parodied]] the original Spider-Man) was reworked for a parody of Spider-Man 2099 entitled "Spider-Ham 15.88".  A laboratory janitor named "Piguel O'Hara" accidentally falls into a vat of spider venom and gains spider-powers.  A short (and confusing) excursion as [[Spider-Ham#Post Cancellation|Spider-Ham 2099]] follows, including encounters with parody versions of [[The Punisher 2099]] and [[Ravage 2099]].

===Exiles===
[[Image:Spider-man.JPG|Spider-Man 2099 with the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]|thumb|right]] 
After battling the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]] on another world, [[Proteus (comics)|Proteus]] has possessed the body of [[Justice (New Universe)|John "Net Prophet" Tensen]]<ref>''Exiles'' #72-74</ref> and escapes into Earth-928 via Jordan Boone's Virtual Unreality portal (mirroring the Net Prophet's first arrival into 2099.) Proteus arrives at a time before Doom overtook leadership of the United States.<ref>''Exiles'' #75</ref> There, Proteus assumes possession of the body of the [[Hulk 2099|Hulk]] of that era.<ref> [[Marvel Universe Spider-Man (Miguel O'Hara Earth-6375)]] http://www.marvel.com/universe/Spider-Man_2099_(Exiles)</ref>  Spider-Man joins forces with the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]] to stop him. Proteus, being too strong for his opponent, unmasks Spider-Man for the world to see. Spider-Man then convinces Proteus that coming to 2099 was a mistake and that he should move on. Feeling guilty, and afraid of being hunted down with his secret identity now all over the Net, Miguel realized his life was over if he remained in his reality. Spider-Man leaves his world and joins the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]] to stop Proteus and continue fixing damaged realities.<ref>''Exiles'' #76</ref>

===''Timestorm 2009-2099''===
In the newly relaunched 2099 world, O'Hara is younger than in his original version.  His father is a scientist at Alchemax and Miguel himself is a high school student attending the [[Henry Pym|Pym]] Academy.<ref name=Timestorm2 />  Miguel lives with his father, with no siblings; as opposed to the original incarnation in which he lives with his mother and brother Gabriel.<ref name=Timestorm>''Timestorm 2009-2099: Spider-Man'' one-shot, Aug 2009</ref>

Miguel received his powers in an accident caused by the Timestorm.  At the time, he was attending a class on biological re-engineering in which he and his classmates were altering the genetic code of various bugs.  When the Timestorm happened, his DNA was mixed with that of the spider he was working on.  His powers are extremely similar to those of Peter Parker's, with the exception of Miguel's organic webbing, that is shot from the top of his hand.  As opposed to the original incarnation of Miguel O'Hara, the Timestorm version does not appear to have razor sharp "talons" on his hands and feet.<ref name=Timestorm2>''Timestorm 2009-2099'' #2, Jul 2009</ref>

After gaining his powers, he creates his Spider-Man costume in a [[3D printing|3D printer]] and helps a time-lost Peter Parker battle [[Scorpion (comics)|Scorpion]] 2099 (Kron Stone, who was caught in the same accident as Miguel). The original Spider-Man advises him not to be a hero as it's too dangerous, and he instead uses his powers in a fighting arena against the Atlantean [[Human Torch]].<ref name=Timestorm />
