'''Spider-Man 2099''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]], a [[fictional character]] created by [[Peter David]] and [[Rick Leonardi]] in 1992.

His first appearance was a preview in ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]] #365'', his first full appearance being soon afterwards in ''Spider-Man 2099'' #1.  Spider-Man was one of the many Marvel characters to be reimagined for the [[Marvel 2099]] [[comic book]] line, a collection of several series' that showed future versions of classic Marvel characters living in the year 2099,  decades after the current [[Marvel Universe]] time period.  A few other examples are Hulk 2099, Doom 2099 and X-Men 2099.

The ''Spider-Man 2099'' series continued on for almost four years, ending in August [[1996]] with #46; Spider-Man 2099 appeared immediately after in all eight issues of the ''2099: World of Tomorrow'', which was for the most part the finale of the 2099 universe, and later still in ''2099: Manifest Destiny'', a one-shot edition that ostensibly concluded the 2099 series.  However, the character has since made several cameo and guest appearances in other comic books, the most recent being ''[[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]]'' Vol. 5, #28 up until the World Tour storyline in the Exiles series leading to his joining the team.

==Character history==
The character's alter ego is '''Miguel O'Hara''', a half-Mexican, half-Irish genetic engineer at the Alchemax Corporation, who after gaining arachnid-like powers in a gene-splicing accident took on the identity of Spider-Man, donning a Mexican [[Day of the Dead]] suit as his costume.  As Spider-Man, Miguel fought against the Alchemax Corporation's control over the city, and tried to bring down the corporation's CEO, Tyler Stone, whom Miguel later discovered to be his birth father.

Miguel's family tree was complicated.  His mother Conchata frequently disagreed with his "father" George's attempts to push Miguel into superior academic pursuits, going as far as beating her when she voiced disagreement.  At one point Conchata cheated on her husband with Tyler Stone, and Miguel was born.  Miguel went to the Alchemax Academy For Gifted Youngsters and studied alongside Xina Kwan, who became his girlfriend, and Kron Stone, whom he did not know until later was his half-brother.  Much later, Kron, by then a petty crook, bonded with the Venom Symbiote, which discovered him after he was nearly killed by the 2099-era Punisher, Jake Gallows.  As Venom, Kron tortured Miguel and Xina, and eventually murdered Miguel's one-time fiancé, Dana D'Angelo.  Miguel's other half brother, Gabriel (Gabe) O'Hara, grew up resentful of the attention shown Miguel by their parents.  He moonlighted in virtual reality as a superhero named Firelight, and at one time was accused of being a 2099 version of the Green Goblin (who subsequently was referenced as having been a shapeshifter assuming Gabe's form).

Over the four-year-run of the series, Spider-Man 2099 encountered futuristic versions of modern Spider-Man villains, including the previously-mentioned Goblin and Venom, as well as the Vulture and the Chameleon, in addition to new villains like Venture, a cyborg; Thanatos, the Rick Jones from an alternate timeline; Discord, a virtual reality archetype; and Flipside, a Spider-Man doppelgänger.  He also met the other heroes of 2099; the hero Justice from the [[New Universe]], who was known in 2099 as the Net Prophet; and also, in a special edition entitled ''Spider-Man meets Spider-Man 2099'', his original counterpart.  This comic also introduced 'Spider-Man 2211', yet another latter-day Spider-Man from further down the timestream.  It also introduced the Hobgoblin of 2211, whose appearance clearly recalled that of Norman Osborn's Green Goblin persona in keeping with the recurrent 2099 theme of confusing distant history, characters, and events.

==Exiles==

The Exiles will visit the 2099 world during Exiles #75-76 as part of the World Tour. Spider-Man will apparently become one of these Exiles.[[Image:Spider-man.JPG|Spider-Man with Exiles. Cover of Exiles #77|thumb|left]]
