'''Spider-Man 2099 (Miguel O'Hara)''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]], a [[fictional character]] created by [[Peter David]] and [[Rick Leonardi]] in 1992.

Spider-man 2099 is supposed to take place in an alternate universe future, a different world thatn the regual marvel 616 reality. His first appearance was a preview in ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]] #365'', his first full appearance being soon afterwards in ''Spider-Man 2099'' #1.  Spider-Man was one of the many Marvel characters to be reimagined for the [[Marvel 2099]] [[comic book]] line, a collection of several series that showed future versions of classic Marvel characters living in the year 2099,  decades after the current [[Marvel Universe]] time period.  A few other examples are [[Hulk 2099]], [[Doom 2099]] and [[X-Men 2099]].

The ''Spider-Man 2099'' series continued on for almost four years, ending in August [[1996]] with #46; Spider-Man 2099 appeared immediately after in all eight issues of the ''2099: World of Tomorrow'', which was for the most part the finale of the 2099 universe, and later still in ''2099: Manifest Destiny'', a one-shot edition that ostensibly concluded the 2099 series. However, the character has since made several cameo and guest appearances in other comic books, the most recent being ''[[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]]'' Vol. 5, #28 He has since Joined the reality hopping team [[Exiles]] during their recent "world tour" storyline.  He has been a recurring member of this team ever since.

==Character history==
The character's alter ego is '''Miguel O'Hara''', a half-Mexican, half-Irish genetic engineer at the Alchemax Corporation. Miguel feels that the company is too unethical; he decides to quit, but his greedy boss drugs him with a very addictive poison. In order to get rid of the drug, Miguel undergoes a dangerous procedure, but a vengeful co-worker, Aaron Delgato, sabotages his experiment and causes Miguel to accidentally splice his DNA with that of a spider's DNA.  He soon realizes that he has gained arachnid-like powers and then dons a spider-like Mexican [[Day of the Dead]] suit as his costume, which is made of a nigh-indestructible [[unstable molecules|unstable molecule]] fabric material.  As [[Spider-Man]], Miguel fought against the Alchemax Corporation's control over the city, and tried to bring down the corporation's CEO, Tyler Stone, whom Miguel later discovered to be his birth father.

Miguel's family tree was complicated.  His mother Conchata frequently disagreed with his "father", her husband George. He would beat her when she voiced that disagreement.  At one point Conchata cheated on her husband with Tyler Stone, and Miguel was born. Miguel went to the Alchemax Academy For Gifted Youngsters (Which was hinted at being the future of Xaviers school for gifted youngsters.) and studied alongside Xina Kwan, who later became his girlfriend, and Kron Stone, whom he did not know until later was his half-brother. Much later, [[Venom (comics)#Spider-Man 2099|Kron]], by then a petty crook, bonded with the Venom [[symbiote (comics)|symbiote]], which discovered him after he was nearly killed by the 2099-era [[Punisher (comics)|Punisher]], [[The Punisher 2099|Jake Gallows]]. As Venom, Kron tortured Miguel and Xina Kwan, and eventually murdered Miguel's one-time fiancée, Dana D'Angelo.  Miguel's other half brother, Gabriel "Gabe" O'Hara, grew up resentful of the attention shown Miguel by their parents. He moonlighted in virtual reality as a superhero named '''Firelight''', and at one time was accused of being a 2099 version of the [[Green Goblin]] (who later was revealed to be a [[shapeshifting|shapeshifter]] assuming Gabe's form).

Over the four-year-run of the series, Spider-Man 2099 encountered futuristic versions of modern Spider-Man villains, including the previously-mentioned [[Green Goblin|Goblin]] and [[Venom (comics)|Venom]], as well as the [[Vulture (comics)|Vulture]] and the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]]. He also battled new villains like Venture, a cyborg; Thanatos, the Rick Jones from an alternate timeline; Discord, a virtual reality archetype; and [[Flipside (comics)|Flipside]], a Spider-Man doppelgänger. He also met the other heroes of 2099; the hero [[Justice (New Universe)|Justice]] from the [[New Universe]], who was known in 2099 as the Net Prophet; and also, in a special edition entitled ''Spider-Man meets Spider-Man 2099'', his original web-slinging counterpart. This comic also introduced ''[[Spider-Man 2211]]'', yet another latter-day [[Spider-Man]] from further down the timestream. It also introduced the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin of 2211]], whose appearance clearly recalled that of Norman Osborn's Green Goblin persona in keeping with the recurrent 2099 theme of confusing distant history, characters, and events.

After battling the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]] on another world, [[Proteus (comics)|Proteus]] escapes to 2099, and takes the body of the [[Hulk 2099|Hulk]]. Spider-Man joins forces with the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]] to stop him. Proteus is too strong, and unmasks Spider-Man to the world. Spider-Man then convinces Proteus that coming to 2099 was a mistake and that he should move on.  Feeling guilty, and afraid of being hunted down after his identity is made public, Spider-Man leaves his world and joins the Exiles to continue fixing damaged realities.

The appearance of Proteus early in the year 2099 caused a [[Grandfather paradox#Parallel universes resolution|timeline divergence]] from the original Marvel 2099 [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]], and the new timeline is identified as [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Earth-6375]] in the ''All-New [[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]] A-Z'' #5.

==Alternate versions==
Another version of Spider-Man 2099 was one of the alternate Avengers seen briefly during The Destiny War.

In ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #439, the issue takes place 1,000 years (2998 based on the release date of the issue) in the future.  Two archaeologists stumble across relics belonging to Spider-Man (such as his webshooters).  They speculate on his career, and discuss the other heroes who were inspired by him, such as Spider-Girl, Spider-Man 2099, and [[Spider-Man 2211]].

In issue #26 of ''What The--?!'', a humor anthology title, the character [[Spider-Ham]] (an [[anthropomorphic]] pig who [[parody|parodied]] the original Spider-Man) was reworked for a parody of Spider-Man 2099 entitled "Spider-Ham 15.88".  A laboratory janitor named "Piguel O'Hara" accidentally falls into a vat of spider venom and gains spider-powers.  A short (and confusing) excursion as [[Spider-Ham#Post Cancellation|Spider-Ham 2099]] follows, including encounters with parody versions of [[The Punisher 2099]] and [[Ravage 2099]].

==Powers==
Spider-Man 2099's hybrid human/spider physiology gives him a wide array of powers. He has the proportionate strength, speed and agility of a spider, which allows him to lift many times his own body weight, perform complicated acrobatic and gymnastic maneuvers that would be impossible for even the most highly-trained athlete, and jump great distances. His durability was also increased to a point where in an issue he suffered a punctured lung, broken ribs, major abrasions and bruises, and made it to a hospital in time where a doctor told him he has amazing constitution for him to be alive. He also notably heals faster than a normal human, but does not have a healing factor (he would not have needed a doctor if he did). Notably absent from his suite of powers is a "Spider-Sense", probably due to the fact that it would no doubt be far more difficult to produce via genetic manipulation. Despite this fact, Spider-Man 2099 seems nearly as flexible, acrobatic, and evasive as his namesake. Though he claims to not have been in a fight since he was a child, Miguel quickly develops a effective fighting style that capitalizes on his unique abilities as well as his genius-level intelligence.
(While the exact levels of his abilities are less discussed and well-known than those of the contemporary [[Spider-Man]], it has been generally assumed that Miguel is physically on par with his predecessor at the time of the original series - who was quoted at the time as having reflexes 40 times above normal, the strength to lift at least 10 tons, and the ability to leap the width of a city block or almost 5 stories (60 feet) straight up. The fact that the "Spider Program" that produced Miguel's powers was designed to mimic the original Spider-Man's capabilities would seem to be inconclusive proof of these figures.)

[[Spinnerets]] in his forearms enable him to fire organic spider-webbing from the top of his wrists, usable in a wide variety of ways. Like his predecessor, Spider-Man 2099 can travel at high speeds swinging on "weblines" when necessary, and he can use his webbing to ensnare enemies. Retractable talons in his fingertips and toes enable him to climb walls or cut enemies. Though they are rather short (approximately an inch long), they are extremely sharp, and seem strong enough to resist breakage despite his enhanced strength - Miguel has shown capable of rending metal armour on numerous occasions. These talons acted instinctively at first, and it took practice to retract them properly (making short work of his bedsheets while sleeping). 

He possesses Venom glands and slightly enlarged, pointed canines (which are not entirely dissimilar to a vampire), which allows him to paralyze his foes should he choose to bite them. While the exact makeup of his venom has never been discussed, it seems powerful enough to affect such foes as Thanatos - and it differs from real spider venom in that it does not seem to act as a digestive agent in addition to its paralytic properties.
Compensating for his lack of a "Spider-Sense", his hearing exceeds the acuity of a normal human, as does his vision - he can see extremely well over both long distances ("telescopic" vision) and in low-light conditions. In addition to the generally enhanced properties of his vision, the flicker-fusion rate of his retinas is reduced to such an extent that he can easily perceive fast-moving objects that would appear to others as a blur. A side effect of his visual enhancements are the color of his eyes - they are generally drawn as having red irises, making sunglasses a regular part of Miguel's wardrobe. When trying to perform "damage control" with his girlfriend early on in the original series, Miguel told Dana that as a result of breaking his genetically-coded Rapture addiction, his eyes were now more sensitive to light and that his jaw hurt (allowing him to more easily hide his red eyes and pointed teeth).

His web cape, which he obtained from a Thorite (Worshiper of Thor), is made from the Lyte Byte material commonly used in the manufacturing of hang-gliders, and acts as an air foil, allowing  him to glide on air currents for a short period of time, as well as slow his rate of descent and control his direction in freefall. Coupled with his superhuman strength and agility, the Lite-Byte cloth allows him near-immunity to damage from falls - on numerous occasions, he has leapt from the top of tall buildings with no apparent ill effects upon landing.
