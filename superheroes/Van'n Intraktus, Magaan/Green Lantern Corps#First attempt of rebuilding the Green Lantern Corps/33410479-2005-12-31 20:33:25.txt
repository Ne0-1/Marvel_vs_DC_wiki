The '''Green Lantern Corps''' is a fictional, [[intergalactic]] police force of [[Green Lantern]]s that existed in the pages of [[DC Comics]], chosen to patrol the vast reaches of the Universe, fighting evil wherever it could be found.  It was founded by the [[Guardians of the Universe]] in the early stages of their existence, and it has lasted for over three billion years despite suffering rebellions, murder and collapses from within and without. 

==Publishing history==
===The "Lensman" connection===
Many believe the Green Lantern Corps was modeled after the ''[[Lensman]]'' [[science fiction]] series of [[E.E. Doc Smith|E.E. "Doc" Smith]].  There were many parallels between the two: both were intergalactic law enforcement agents chosen for their high moral character and willingness to do good, and empowered with an awesome weapon of alien design that also had safeguards against abuse and evil trickery. However, [[John Broome]], who wrote the Silver Age Green Lantern stories, and [[Julius Schwartz]], who edited those stores, have both denied any connection. Broome and Schwartz claimed to never have read the Smith stories, although Schwartz admitted that as a Science Fiction fan, he had of course heard of them.

However, as a tip of the hat to the series, writer Mike Barr created two new Corps members for his Green Lantern Corps mini series named Arisia and Eddore, after the planets of the super intelligent good and evil races (respectively) in the Lensman series.

Comic book writers were attracted to the concept of an intergalactic corps made up of Green Lanterns from various alien races.  An occasional backup series in the ''Green Lantern'' comic book series, ''Tales of the Green Lantern Corps,'' featured guest writers who often penned short stories about the idiosyncrasies of individual alien Green Lanterns, who might never be heard of again.

==Fictional history==
===The Guardians===
[[Image:Guardians_by_Igle.jpg|left|thumb|150px|The Guardians of the Universe'']]
In the early days of the Universe, natives of the overpopulated planet Maltus (sometimes spelled ''Malthus'' as a possible reference to famous overpopulation author [[Thomas Malthus]]) evolved into immortals of great power.  They subsequently settled the planet Oa and declared themselves the Guardians of the Universe and enemies of evil after one of their own, the renegade scientist [[Krona (DC Comics)|Krona]], performed a forbidden experiment that had terrible consequences for the Universe at large. 

Exactly what those consequences were have varied with different versions of the stories; originally, it was supposed to have unleashed Evil in the first place.  Later, it was attributed to have created the [[Antimatter]] Universe of [[Qward]].  Later still, it was used as the explanation for the existence of [[parallel universe]]s in the [[DC Universe]] (and the creation of the [[Monitor]]), which eventually led to the rearrangement of Time itself, as seen in the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]].  Finally, it has been stated that it accelerated [[entropy]], shortening the duration of the universe by a billion years. 

Some of the Guardians, however, disagreed on how to deal with the chaos that had been unleashed.  One group, calling itself the [[Controllers]], separated itself from the others and favored using more violent methods to achieve their ends (a later interpretation says they left over a disagreement on how to use the [[Manhunter (DC Comics race)|Manhunter]]s - see below).  They would later found the [[Darkstars]] organization.  The female Oans, feeling no need to involve themselves in the situation, also left, becoming later known as the [[Zamarons]].

===The Manhunter Failure===
To enforce their will and guard against [[Extraterrestrial life | alien]] menaces of all sorts, the Guardians had created a legion of robotic sentinels called the [[Manhunter (DC Comics race)|Manhunters]].  However, the Manhunters eventually came to resent their servitude and were also viewed as flawed due to their inability to recognize and/or feel fear.  They rebelled against the Guardians, eventually breaking away and forming their own robotic society where they pursued their own agenda (which often included interfering with, and foiling the plans of, the Guardians).

===The Birth of the Corps===
Chastened by the failure of the Manhunters, the Guardians decided that their newest force of soldiers for good would consist of living beings, ones who had free will and strong moral character.  To arm this new legion of celestial knights, the Guardians created the ''[[Power Ring]]s,'' rings of inconceivably-advanced technology that allowed their wearers to project green beams of energy  with which the bearer could conjure objects of any size or shape, limited only by his or her imagination and willpower.

Although the connection between the Guardian Oans and the origin of the Green Lantern symbol has yet to be clarified, it has been revealed that the lantern itself has its roots in the first life in the universe.  Allegedly, the first life in the galaxy emerged on an unnamed foggy world, and when they developed a police force - the first in the universe - the constabulary carried a lantern lit with a green chemical flame, hence a corp of Green Lanterns.  It is intimated that this ideal was adopted and spread throughout the galaxy as a symbol for law and justice and its ability to pierce confusion and uncertainty, eventually resulting in the formation of the Green Lantern Corps, which requisite power rings and lantern-shaped batteries along traditional lines. Initially consisting of only a few dozen agents at a time, the Corps radically increased its numbers approximately 1000 years ago. The Guardians sought to bring order to the planet known as [[Apokolips]]. Home to [[Darkseid]], a galactic tyrant, Apokolips was and is a stronghold of evil. Green Lantern [[Raker Qarrigat]] sought to remove Darkseid from power, only to be humbled by Darkseid's might. Raker returned to Oa, where he convinced the Guardians that taking Apokolips would require an army. Authorized to start a massive recruitment, Raker and his fellow Lanterns inducted thousands of new members, bringing total membership up to 3600.

===The Fall of the Corps===
[[Image:Gl_oath1.jpg|right|150px|thumb|The Extinguished Main Battery]]
The Green Lantern Corps patrolled the [[DC Comics|DC Universe]] for over three billion years.  In that vast length of time, some Green Lanterns rebelled and fell into evil.  A rogue Green Lantern, [[Universo]], was briefly shown to exist in the future epoch of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]], but multiple [[retcon]]s have long since eliminated this possible future. Two of the most important rebels were 1) [[Sinestro]], the rogue Green Lantern, and 2) [[Hal Jordan]], driven insane over the loss of his home, [[Coast City]].  The Green Lantern Corps ranks were decimated by Hal Jordan during his madness, its power source, the Main Battery extinguished, and Oa destroyed, removing the original power source for the rings.

After the fall of the Corps, other organizations tried to fill in the power vacuum left by the Guardians.   Two organizations had initial notable successes; the [[Darkstars]] and [[L.E.G.I.O.N]].  However neither ever achieved the power and reach of the Green Lantern Corps.

===The Corps' Rebirth===
Recently Oa was reconstructed by Hal Jordan's old sidekick Tom Kalmaku, and shortly thereafter [[Kyle Rayner]], the last remaining Green Lantern, resurrected the Guardians (as children) using the power of Jordan's own ring.  The resurrections did not stop there.  It was discovered that Hal Jordan had committed his crimes while possessed by the fear elemental [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]].  Once Parallax had been exorcised, the Guardians (no longer children due to rapid aging) re-imprisoned Parallax.  With that, the Guardians continued the re-construction and expansion of the Corps.  The new Corps,  under the training of [[Kilowog]], [[Kyle Rayner]], [[Guy Gardner]] and other veterans, was primarily filled by new recruits.  Only a handful of veteran Lanterns are back in the ranks.  Each sector will have 2 Lanterns assigned to protect it.

With 3600 sectors and two Green Lanterns per sector, it will be many years before the Corps regains its former strength. It presently lacks both the manpower and the political influence it once had due to its years-long absence from many sectors. This has left it currently unable to intervene in situations it might have before [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]] destroyed the old Corps, including conflicts such as the [[Rann-Thanagar War]]. The Guardians remain staunchly uninvolved in what they see as a conflict that could destabilize many sectors, but that has not stopped Kyle Rayner and Kilowog from helping refugees.

==Structure==
[[Image:GLC1.jpg|thumb|left| ''GREEN LANTERN CORPS: RECHARGE'' #1 (OF 5), Art by Patrick Gleason and Christian Alamy]]The Corps is an organization of 7200 Green Lanterns (the old Corps had 3600) who are chosen by the ring for being able to overcome great fear, with two assigned to sectors of space that require the protection of more than one Green Lantern(Earth, home to Hal Jordan and John Stewart, is in  Sector 2814). Heavily-populated Sectors like 2814, can have several Lanterns. While the primary Lanterns of Sector 2814 are Hal Jordan and John Stewart, there is also Kyle Rayner and Guy Gardner who call Earth home, but are stationed on OA, first as teachers, and then specially assigned to cases that are too difficult for the average GL.

Each member had a great deal of autonomy as to their methods in their jurisdiction, subject to review by the Guardians if they felt the Green Lantern in question has abused his/her assigned authority.  Also, the individual Lanterns were responsible for arranging their replacements if they were near retirement or death.  If the Lantern died before that obligation was met, the ring would find and seek another to be trained on its own. In rare circumstances, Guardians would personally go out into the field to recruit a replacement.

Each Green Lantern in the original corps upon recruitment would receive a power ring, a power battery shaped like a lantern with which the ring is recharged and a uniform.  The default uniform design for humanoids was a green section covering the torso and shoulders, black arms and leggings, green boots and a chest symbol of a stylized Green Lantern icon on a white circle.  Lanterns were allowed to customize their uniforms as long as the color scheme and the symbol was present.  Lanterns were also allowed the option of a [[secret identity]] as a security measure and it is implied that the Corps were instructed to honor that choice by taking care not to expose them.  Training in the use of the ring was optional and appropriate facilities and personnel were available on Oa upon request.  In addition, a senior Lantern can be assigned to coach a recruit in the field in their sector.

The New Green Lantern Corps being built by the Guardians is far more formal and structured than the old one that was destroyed by [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]]. Recruits, after being found by their power rings, are taken to Oa for training. Not all recruits will make it through training - indeed a great many of them might even fail, forcing the ring to find another Lantern. Lantern trainees have a simplified version of the old Green Lantern uniforms (with green covering more of the torso than in the DC Animated Universe Green Lantern designs) with the white circle on their chest blank, presumably until the Lantern insignia is added upon completion of their training.  Additionally, all power rings, not just Kyle Rayner's ring, now work on the colour yellow, provided the user can feel the fear behind the colour and overcome it.
 
Upon recruitment, a Green Lantern is expected to uphold certain principles of his/her/its duty.  These principles include:

# Protection of life and liberty with the assigned sector.
# Following the orders of the Guardians without question.
# Noninterference with a planet's culture, political structure or its population's collective will.
# Acting within local laws and obey the local authority within reason.  (Presumably, The Guardians' orders can overrule this when necessary).
# Taking no action against anyone or anything until they are proven to be a threat against life and liberty. 
# Refusing to use the equipment, resources or authority of The Corps for personal gain.
# Showing respect for and cooperating with other members of the Corps and the Guardians.
# Showing respect for life which includes restraint of force unless there is no reasonable alternative.
# Giving top priority to the greatest danger in the assigned sector.
# Upholding the honor of the Corps.

To enforce these principles, the Guardians closely monitored the activities of the Lanterns.  If they felt a violation of Corps regulations occurred, they would summon the offender to Oa and hold a trial in which the charges were read and the Lantern was allowed to explain his/her/its actions.  If the Guardians were not satisfied by the explanation, they had a number of disciplinary options which include:
* Probation
* Personal supervision by the Guardians on Oa
* Temporary exile from the Lantern's homeworld
* Ritual Trial of Endurance - a Lantern must attempt a dangerous passage through the Anti-Matter Universe.
* Expulsion from the Corps.

===Corps Oa headquarters===
The Corps headquarters was on the planet of [[Oa]], in the center of the universe.  The main features include a great hall with a raised dais for the Guardians to meet in conference as well as other formal functions.  There were also training facilities for desiring recruits and holding cells called Sciencells for particularly dangerous criminals.  The most prominent feature was the Central Power Battery, a giant size version of the Lantern's power batteries that channeled the energy of the Guardians and amplified it, to feed energy to the individual power batteries.  It was vital to maintain security on this device since major damage to it would preclude recharging the power rings -which required energy every 24 Earth hours- thus robbing the Corps of their primary weapons, the exception being Kyle Rayner's ring which can last longer than 24 hours.

===Weapons===
[[Image:GLWeapons.jpg|thumb|left| The Corps' Weapon]]

When recharging their weapons, some Corps members recite an oath.  This oath can differ from Corps member to member but the most popular seems to be:

''In brightest day, in darkest night,''

''no evil shall escape my sight!''

''Let those who worship evil's might,''

''beware my power... Green Lantern's light!''

a notably different version, created for a power ring holder from a sightless race, was:

''"In loudest din or hush profound,''

''my ears catch evil's slightest sound.'' 

''Let those who toll out evil's knell,''

''beware my power: The F-Sharp Bell!"''
