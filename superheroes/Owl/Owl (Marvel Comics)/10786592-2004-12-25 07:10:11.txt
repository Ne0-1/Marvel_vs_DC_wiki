'''The Owl''' is a [[supervillain]] who frequently menaces [[Daredevil (comics)|Daredevil]] and other heroes in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel Universe|universe]], notably [[Spider-Man]] and the [[The Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]].  The Owl wears a set of metal talons on each wrist and a cape designed to resemble an [[owl]]'s outstretched wings, and often uses various other bird-themed weapons and pieces of equipment (not unlike [[Batman]]'s foe [[The Penguin]]). Although the Owl was Daredevil's arch-nemesis for much of his early career, he has since faded into obscurity, thanks in part to the popularity of Daredevil's more serious enemies, primarily the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] and [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]].
