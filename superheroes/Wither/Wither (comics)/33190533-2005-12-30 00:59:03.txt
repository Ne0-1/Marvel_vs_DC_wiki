'''Wither''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] in the [[Marvel Universe]], one of the student body in the [[X-Men|Xavier Institute]], and a member of the [[Hellions]] squad therein.  His real name is Kevin Ford.

==Biography==

Kevin Ford developed his mutant powers at an unfortunate and unlucky time. Panicking as his clothes began to decay, his father tried to calm him down... and Kevin's power reduced him to dust.  He has always considered himself cursed by his gift. A talented artist, Kevin lived in a scrap yard for a while (killing the guard dog with his touch naturally) and turned unwanted scrap into beautiful art.

He was found and brought to the Institute, where he met and developed a crush on [[Wallflower (comics)|Laurie Collins]]. However, when he decayed the skin off the [[cyborg]] [[Donald Pierce]], [[Danielle Moonstar|Dani Moonstar]] was forced to  stop him by showing him his worst fear - killing Laurie. In the aftermath of this, and realising that using his power "felt right", he left the Institute.

Some months later, Dani, with the help of [[Emma Frost]] set out to bring him back to the school, to fill the sixth place on the formalised New Mutants squad, mentored by Dani. While he was still angry at Dani, Emma managed to persuade him to return, and he joined the New Mutants squad under the codename '''Wither'''. Clashing with [[Elixir (comics)|Elixir]], the current object of Laurie's affections who he'd last seen as one of Pierce's [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]], [[Mercury (comics)|Mercury]], the only person he could touch without killing, reached out to him, having developed a crush on him.  Shortly after he returned to the school he was arrested by the FBI for killing his father. While the Hellions tried to "rescue" him (Mercury coming in through a window to let him know), the New Mutants tried to stop them - fearing the consequences of involving the Institute in a fight with the FBI - until the X-Men arrived and ended the fight, taking them all back to the Institute before they were discovered. This was the final straw, however, and he swapped squads with [[Icarus (comics)|Icarus]] to become a Hellion.

Recently, he discovered Elixir's former relationship with [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]] and released it to the school, successfully ending Josh's relationship with Laurie.

==Powers==

Wither decays, and eventually disintegrates, organic matter by touch - a power which is involuntary (i.e. "stuck on"). With extended contact he would reduce almost anything organic - or anyone - to dust.
