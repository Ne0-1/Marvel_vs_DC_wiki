'''Gorilla Grodd''' is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]], primarily as an enemy of [[Flash (comics)|The Flash]]. The character was created by [[John Broome (writer)|John Broome]] and [[Carmine Infantino]], and first appeared in ''The Flash'' #106 (May 1959).<ref name=Guide>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=123}}</ref> He is an evil, super-intelligent gorilla who gained mental powers after being exposed to a strange meteorite's radiation.

Grodd makes his live appearance as a recurring character in CGI on the television series ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' voiced by [[David Sobolov]]. He also appeared on the [[Legends of Tomorrow (season 3)|third]] season of ''Legends of Tomorrow''.

In 2009, Gorilla Grodd was ranked as [[IGN]]'s 35th Greatest Comic Book Villain of all Time.

==Fictional character biography==
Gorilla Grodd is a hyper-intelligent telepathic [[gorilla]] able to [[mind control|control the minds]] of others. He was an average ape until an alien spacecraft ([[retcon]]ned from a radioactive meteor which also empowered Hector Hammond) crashed in Grodd's African home.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rovin |first1=Jeff |title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Cartoon Animals |date=1991 |publisher=Prentice Hall Press |isbn=0-13-275561-0 |accessdate=8 April 2020 |url=https://archive.org/details/illustratedencyc00rovi/page/110/mode/2up/ |page=111}}</ref> Grodd and his tribe of gorillas were imbued with super intelligence by the ship's pilot. Grodd and fellow gorilla [[Solovar]] also developed telepathic and [[psychokinesis|telekinetic]] powers. Led by the alien, the gorillas constructed the super-advanced [[Gorilla City]].<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |page=146}}</ref> The gorillas lived in peace until their home was discovered by explorers. Grodd forced one of the explorers to kill the alien and took over Gorilla City, planning to conquer the world next. Solovar telepathically contacted [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] to warn of the evil gorilla's plans, and Grodd was defeated. The villain manages to return again and again to plague the Flash and the hero's allies.<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation | last = Beatty | first = Scott | author-link = Scott Beatty | contribution = Gorilla Grodd | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page = 141 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York | year = 2008 |ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5 |oclc = 213309017}}</ref>

In his first Pre-''Crisis'' appearance, he met the Flash while searching for Solovar (who had been imprisoned) during a trip to the human world. Grodd probed Solovar's mind to find the secret of mind control so he could control Gorilla City, using its inhabitants to take over the world. Solovar breaks out of the cage and tells the Flash. The Flash defeats Grodd and temporarily removes his telepathy. When his power returns, he escapes and builds a machine to strip his fellow gorillas of their intelligence. The Flash finds out from Solovar where Grodd has escaped to and destroys the machine. Grodd is again imprisoned, but uses a burrowing machine he built earlier to escape. Assuming human form, he creates a drug to strengthen his abilities. After easily stopping the Flash, Grodd experiences a side effect that removes his new powers. The Flash arrests Grodd and takes him back to Gorilla City. Grodd fakes his death by transferring his mind into a man in Central City, but is caught and arrested. Later, he instigates the Flash's Rogues Gallery, breaking them out of jail to distract the Flash after transferring his mind to that of Freddy, a gorilla in a zoo. Thanks to Solovar, the Flash learns of Grodd's escape. Ironically, Grodd, despite using radiation to negate the Flash's speed, is defeated by the gorilla's mate when she hears him mention another gorilla. He and Freddy are restored to their normal bodies.

Grodd is recruited along with several other villains as one of the original members of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]]. In this series, Grodd defeats Kalibak, the son of [[Darkseid]], in a hand-to-hand grudge brawl, but is later defeated by [[Captain Comet]] who is able to repel Grodd's mental energy.<ref>''Secret Society of Super Villains'' #4, 1977</ref> During the hunt for a sorcerer's treasures, Grodd is able to fend off [[Wally West]] and escape him using the mentally-commanded Quadro-Mobile,<ref>''Secret Society of Super Villains'' #9, 1977</ref> then later knocks Captain Comet unconscious,<ref>''Secret Society of Super Villains'' #10, 1977</ref> and is shown to be able to hypnotize [[Star Sapphire (comics)|the new Star Sapphire]],<ref>''Secret Society of Super Villains'' #11, 1977</ref> as well as protect others from mental probing.

In a confrontation with [[Wally West]], Grodd increases most of the animals' brain power in [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]]. He hopes to endanger all the humans' lives, but this plan backfires because some of the pets are too loyal to their humans. Grodd's plans are defeated by the Flash, assisted by the [[Pied Piper (comics)|Pied Piper]], [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]] and [[Rex the Wonder Dog]].

Immortal villain [[Vandal Savage]] kidnaps Titans member [[Lilith (DC Comics)|Omen]] to form the perfect team of adversaries for the [[Teen Titans]]. Savage approaches Grodd, offering him membership in this new anti-Titans group known as Tartarus and promises of power and [[immortality]]. Grodd joins Tartarus on their mission to synthesize the immortal blood of the [[H.I.V.E.]] Mistress Addie Kane as Savage seeks to create a serum that will grant immortality. Their schemes are thwarted when the Titans intervene. [[Garth (comics)|Tempest]] later leads a rescue mission to save Omen from Savage. During the rescue attempt, Tartarus collapses upon itself due to each member having a different agenda, because Omen had purposely chosen members who would not work well together. When [[Siren (DC Comics)|Siren]] switches alliances during the battle and aids Tempest in escaping, the Tartarus members go their separate ways.

Grodd has made no fewer than eighteen attempts to eliminate all traces of humanity from the face of the Earth. In ''Son of Ambush Bug'' #5 (November 1986), he travels to the Late Cretaceous "''to wipe out all traces of human evolution from the time stream''" (despite the fact that the ancestors of humanity would be his own ancestors as well). His plans are shattered by the sudden appearance of [[Titano]] and [[Ambush Bug]] waking from a nightmare. Whether or not Grodd's plan is a failure is disputable.

In the final issue of ''[[Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew]]'', Grodd travels to Earth-C in an attempt to conquer, but is defeated by the efforts of the Zoo Crew (plus [[Beast Boy|Changeling]] of the Teen Titans).<ref>''Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew'' #20, November 1983</ref>

In the 1991 ''[[Angel and the Ape]]'' limited series, Grodd is revealed as the grandfather of Sam Simeon (Angel's partner). This is in conflict with ''[[Martian Manhunter]] Annual'' #2 (1999), which states that Simeon is Grodd's brother.

In the ''Justice League of America Wedding Special'', Gorilla Grodd is among the villains seen as members of the [[Injustice League#Injustice League Unlimited|Injustice League Unlimited]].

During the ''[[Final Night]]'', Grodd attempted to use a mystical talisman called the Heart of Darkness (normally effective only in eclipses) that brought out the 'inner beast' of humans, turning the population of the town of Leesburg into feral monsters, including [[Supergirl (Matrix)|Supergirl]]. However, Supergirl was eventually able to fight off Grodd's influence, allowing her to oppose Grodd until the sun was restored. Grodd is assumed killed when an icicle fell into him.

One of Grodd's widest-ranging schemes was to arrange Solovar's assassination and manipulate Gorilla City into war against humanity, with the aid of a "shadow cabinet" of prominent gorillas called Simian Scarlet. In the course of this, Grodd absorbs too much neural energy from his fellow apes, leaving him with the intelligence of a normal gorilla.<ref>''Martian Manhunter Annual'' #2, 1999</ref> He has since recovered, and a failed attempt to set up a base in Florida leads to his capture and incarceration in [[Iron Heights]].

Grodd had been trapped inside the human body of an overweight street bum. He was attacked by a gang known as the Vultures. One of them commented on how their member Iggo had the strength of a gorilla, which reminded Grodd of his true form. Suddenly changing back to his original shape and size, he quickly defeated the gang, making them believe that they are burning in molten lava by using his telepathic abilities. Reading the minds of the crooks, he saw that one of the former members of their gang was a friend of the Flash, and a plan began to form in his mind.

Grodd found another space rock, identical to the one that had given him his powers, and contacted [[Hector Hammond]], a human who had also gained similar powers. Grodd was able to take control of Gorilla City after increasing his evolutionary abilities but was defeated once more.

Grodd is also seen in the ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' arc "Public Enemies" controlling numerous villains and heroes in order to take down [[Superman]] and [[Batman]] for the prize of one billion dollars offered by then [[U.S. President]] [[Lex Luthor]]. Despite his use of foes such as [[Mongul]], [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]], [[Lady Shiva]], and [[Nightshade (DC Comics)|Nightshade]], Batman is able to deduce the mind behind the attacks and they quickly dispose of Grodd.<ref>''Superman/Batman'' #1&nbsp;– #7</ref>

He is responsible for [[Hunter Zolomon]]'s crippling, resulting in the man's transformation into the villainous Zoom after trying to change the event to never have happened. Hunter would often think about how Grodd used him as a plaything in that fight while talking this over with the Flash.<ref>''Flash'' vol. 2, #193 (February 2003)</ref>

In ''[[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]'', Grodd makes a deal with Grimm to get [[Blockbuster (DC Comics)|Blockbuster]] an ape heart.<ref>''Birds of Prey'' #23</ref>

In the ''JLA Classified'' story arc, Grodd and his forces attack the [[Ultramarine Corps]]. Grodd has most of the citizens they are protecting killed. He personally eats some of the humans. During the course of this incident, [[Squire (comics)#Beryl Hutchinson|Beryl]] informs the team that Grodd ranks number three on the latest "Global Most Wanted".<ref>''JLA Classified'' #1-3 (2004)</ref>

In the ''[[Salvation Run]]'' mini-series, Grodd teams up with the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] to gather their own faction of the exiled supervillains.<ref>''Salvation Run'' #3 (March 2008)</ref> He kills [[Monsieur Mallah]] and the [[Brain (comics)|Brain]], and was knocked off a cliff by the Joker.<ref>''Salvation Run'' #4 (April 2008)</ref> He is seen alive and attempting to deliver payback to the Joker.<ref>''Salvation Run'' #7 (July 2008)</ref>

In ''Justice League of America'', Grodd is shown among the members of [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]]'s new [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]] and placed in the Inner Circle.<ref>''Justice League of America'' #21</ref> In the ''[[Final Crisis]]'' storyline, Gorilla Grodd was among the high ranked superheroes and supervillains that were turned into Justifiers.<ref>''Final Crisis'' #4</ref> He is sent to apprehend [[Snapper Carr]] and Cheetah, but fails.<ref>''Final Crisis: Resist'' one-shot</ref>

===The New 52===
In the new continuity of [[The New 52]] (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), before Flash makes earthfall into the super ape's midst, Grodd II was crown prince of Gorilla City speaking with his father, King Grodd, about how the light that touched their fair city was destiny. Destiny which had once again tilted its hand and brought their culture to being, but Grodd rebuffs these claims stating their destiny was their own to command, and that they were destined for dominance.<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 4) #7 (March 2012)</ref> The Flash (Barry Allen) first encounters Gorilla Grodd after a trip through the Speed Force which strands him in their hidden community, all of which just shortly after Grodd has been newly crowned as gorilla king after killing his father and consuming his mind.<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 4) #8 (April 2012)</ref>

The Flash is hailed as a messenger spoken of in gorilla prophecy by all but Grodd who sees the interloper as a threat to his ascension and designs for world conquest. When told of the treachery planned by the Ape Elders from his most trusted general, Grodd led a personal execution detail in an attempt to kill Barry and assume the mantle of the Light Bringer. But The Flash foils Grodd's attempts by outmaneuvering him until King Grodd causes the caves containing Gorilla Cities history to collapse upon himself, knocking him unconscious, allowing the Flash to escape.<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 4) #9 (May 2012)</ref>

After having been unearthed by General Silverback while still buried beneath the rubble of the ruined cave, Grodd eventually recuperated after his previous battle with Flash. He found that he still had some followers among the ape army and would eventually slaughter most of the elders, saving one needed for his invasion plans.<ref name="The Flash 2013">''The Flash'' (vol. 4) #17 (April 2013)</ref> Grodd returns and attacks Central City with an army of gorilla soldiers searching for payback against The Messenger.<ref>''Flash Annual'' (vol. 4) #1</ref> After a while of waiting out the battle, Gorilla Grodd would make his way to one of Dr. Darwin Elias's labs which contain canisters of Flash's excess speed energy,<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 4) #13 (December 2012)</ref> consuming these batteries temporarily supercharges Grodd's own Speed Force evolved physiology enabling him enough speed and power to overwhelm the flash nearly killing him.<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 4) #16 (March 2013)</ref>

During the "[[Forever Evil]]" storyline, Gorilla Grodd returns to Central City during a ceremony commemorating Flash between the humans and gorillas at the time when [[Ultraman (comics)|Ultraman]] had caused an eclipse. Gorilla Grodd, brandishing several new powers courtesy of The Light, proceeds to take control of Central City as its king and renames it Grodd City.<ref name="Flash Vol. 4 #23.1">''Flash'' Vol. 4 #23.1</ref> Eventually growing bored with this, Grodd uses his heightened abilities to take off, the rest of his apes following him to parts unknown.

===DC Rebirth===
In "[[DC Rebirth]]," Grodd is the one who founded the terrorist organization called the [[Black Hole (DC Comics)|Black Hole]] and he is using technology that could contain the power of the Speed Force. Since he is defeated by the Flash with his plans of controlling the Speed Force foiled, he is been recruited by [[Lex Luthor]] who promised him incredible power to paralyze people's movements called "The Still Force" which was released due to the shattering of the [[Source Wall]].

==Powers and abilities==
Grodd's psionic abilities allow him to place other beings under his mental control and transfer his consciousness into other bodies. Grodd also has (on occasion) vast telekinetic abilities ranging from force beams, telekinetic transmutation of matter and lifting thousands of tons mentally. In recent issues he has shown the ability to absorb intelligence through the consumption of human brains. He possesses great superhuman strength far exceeding that of an ordinary gorilla. He is a scientific genius who has mastered Gorilla City's advanced technology and who has created many incredible inventions of his own. He also uses large laser guns.<ref name="dc-ency" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dccomics.com/dcu/heroes_and_villains/?hv=origin_stories/gorilla_grodd&p=2 |title=DCU &#124; Heroes and Villains |publisher=Dccomics.com |date=2010-04-21 |accessdate=2011-01-16}}</ref> His thought process still operates at a relatively human speed; the Flashes have shown some degree of immunity to his telepathic illusions by moving so fast that their thoughts process Grodd's illusions in slow motion. In one story, Grodd either gains or strengthens his already vast psychokinetic abilities via ingesting a pill he develops after evolving himself into a human, enabling him to control the forces of nature. But after he turns back, he loses this power as his brain is not evolved enough; in later stories, however, Grodd has been seen using both his psionic attributes openly without the need of accelerated evolution.

In the New 52 reboot of DC continuity, Grodd, like all the super apes of Gorilla City, gained their powers from [[Speed Force|The Light]]; the gorillas' identifying term for Flash's Speed Force, the very embodiment of which represents relative space and time. Being of noble blood King Grodd is tougher, stronger, quicker and far more physically and mentally dynamic than other members of his evolved species. He boasts enhanced gorilla strength, enough to easily rend flesh from bone, pick up and/or smash cars and injure Flash through his speed aura, being durable enough to resist supersonic punches from the Flash, rip his way out of barbed wire unharmed and even survive impacts from a charging mammoth affected by the speed force.<ref name="The Flash 2013" /><ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 4) #14 (January 2013)</ref> He has sharp enough reflexes to keep up with even the most nimble meta-humans with relative ease as he was able to grasp at Flash more than once while he was running, having intercepted many of his high-speed attacks more than once. Another facet to his physiology is that he, along with other apes like him, can assimilate both the knowledge and powers of enemies who they kill by devouring their brains, a process dubbed by their forefathers as "Cerecorbis". This process increases Grodd's intelligence, bestowing him with a super genius IQ on top of whatever memories his vanquished enemies had as well as any abilities they might have possessed.<ref>Aquaman (vol. 7) #37 (January 2015)</ref> Via direct ingestion of The Light's energies, he gains enhanced speed and further augmented dynamism, enabling him to not just effortlessly keep up with, but outright overpower Flash in a straightforward fight, although this augmentation was short-lived as the speed force batteries he drained to get his jump were a finite source, causing him to shrivel and weaken over time. Thanks to his time trapped within the force dimension, however, Grodd gained an even greater acceleration of his development; not only retaining his previous abilities of bolstered strength and super speed, but also accelerating his developmental process, granting him telepathy much like what his species' elders grow into with age, as well as telekinesis which is unique to him.<ref name="Flash Vol. 4 #23.1" />

For a brief time, Grodd's connection to the light had dimmed due to an infraction of clashing timelines, but he would again regain his abilities after having siphoned the lion's share of Barry Allen's speed force abilities after contracting a fatal illness.<ref name="Flash Vol. 5 #40"/> Establishing his connection to the Speed Force and strengthening his formidable psionic abilities once again.<ref name="Flash Vol. 5 #42-43"/> After joining Luthor's legion Grodd would come into all new powers thanks to acting as the guardian of The Turtles latest life incarnation.<ref name="Justice League Vol. 4 #2"/> Now acting as a crucible to channel the infant Turtles Still Force powers, Grodd can now use that same hidden energy to further bolster his telepathy as well as sap energy from other Speed Force conduits.

===Flashpoint===
In the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' timeline, Gorilla Grodd has succeeded in overthrowing Solovar and taken over Gorilla City. Gorilla Grodd began a campaign to control all of Africa. Despite his conquest being a great success, Gorilla Grodd feels unfulfilled since none of his enemies have been able to prove a challenge to him, and the war between Aquaman and Wonder Woman has overshadowed his actions, constantly frustrating him. He soon begins to feel bored by his accomplishments since they prove far too easy for him and often lets his enemies live, hoping for them to become greater challenges in the future. He also decides to begin a campaign to control Europe, knowing perfectly well that this action will make him a target for the Atlanteans and Amazons.<ref>''Flashpoint: Grodd of War'' one-shot (June 2011)</ref> Gorilla Grodd arrives at the scene to attack during the Atlantean/Amazon war.<ref>''Flashpoint'' #5 (August 2011)</ref>

* Gorilla Grodd appears in the TV series set in the [[Arrowverse]]:
** Gorilla Grodd appears on [[The CW]]'s ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', voiced by [[David Sobolov]]. This version was a test subject for [[General Wade Eiling]]'s experiments in developing psychic abilities for interrogation under [[S.T.A.R. Labs]]' supervision but the experiments ended when Eiling tortured Grodd. In [[The Flash (season 1)|Season One]], he gets exposed to [[Eobard Thawne]]'s particle accelerator explosion's energies, giving Grodd super-intelligence and telepathic powers. Thawne lets Grodd get revenge on Eiling and later distracts Team Flash, torturing [[Joe West (Arrowverse)|Joe West]] until being driven off by [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Barry Allen]] as the Flash. In [[The Flash (season 2)|Season Two]], Grodd returns to try to force [[Caitlin Snow (Arrowverse)|Caitlin Snow]] to create more gorillas like him. However, Grodd is distracted by [[Harrison Wells|Harry Wells]] to save Caitlin, and is banished by the Flash to [[Gorilla City]] in [[Earth-Two]]. In [[The Flash (season 3)|Season Three]], Grodd manipulates Team Flash into helping stage a coup of Gorilla City so that he can lead the gorillas in an invasion of Earth-1, but Team Flash is able to help [[Solovar]] retake command with the rest of the gorillas returning to Earth-2 while Grodd is sent to an [[A.R.G.U.S.]] prison on Earth-1. Grodd will return at some future date as [[XS (comics)|Nora West-Allen]] mentions having heard of a fight that will take place with Grodd and [[King Shark]]. This happens in the episode "King Shark vs. Gorilla Grodd" where Grodd returns and mind-controls Cisco Ramon and Caitlin Snow into stealing Tanya Lamden's telepathy crown in his plot to take control of the minds of Central City. Sacrificing his restored humanity, Shay Lamden of Earth-2 becomes King Shark again and fights Grodd, his more feral brain structure preventing Grodd from controlling King Shark's mind directly. With help from Flash and XS, King Shark defeats Grodd and removes the telepathy crown from him. Grodd is then placed in a medically-induced coma to keep him from using his powers. Grodd returns in an episode titled "Grodd Friended Me"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/dc/2020/02/07/the-flash-grodd-friended-me-synopsis-released/|title=The Flash: Grodd Friended Me Synopsis Released|last=Burlingame|first=Russ|date=February 7, 2020|website=Comic Book|access-date=February 8, 2020}}</ref> where he is still an induced coma when Barry is accidentally placed in his mind. While voicing his knowledge of the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|Crisis]], Grodd states that he found out that Gorilla City is now on Earth-Prime and wants to return to it. In order to get through the gatekeeper who happens to be a mental copy of Solovar, Grodd and Flash had to work together. Once that was done and Barry is back in his mind, Caitlin arranges for Grodd to be released on probation as Lyla places a tracking chip in him so that Flash will know where to find him if he goes back to doing bad things.
** Gorilla Grodd appears in season three of ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'', motion-captured by an uncredited [[Daniel Cudmore]] and voiced again by David Sobolov.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/legends-of-tomorrow/legends-of-tomorrow-season-3-s-65604.aspx|title='Legends of Tomorrow' Season 3 Spoilers: Damien Darhk's Resurrection, Gorilla Grodd and More|author=|date=August 3, 2017|website=BuddyTV|accessdate=August 4, 2017}}</ref> The character is an older version who is now an anachronism. In the episode "Welcome of the Jungle", he exists during the [[Vietnam War]] and used his powers to enslave both American and Viet-Cong soldiers to form his own 'kingdom'. He tried to take over the Waverider only for Martin Stein, Gideon and [[Isaac Newton]] to manipulate events that caused Grodd to fall towards the napalm fire caused by the air strike. He is saved upon being brought back to the present by [[Damien Darhk]] persuading him into working together. In the episode "Guest Starring John Noble", Mallus in Nora Darhk's body instructed Damien to send Grodd to the 1990s to target the college-age [[Barack Obama]]. This plot was thwarted when the [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]] imprisoned him in a jar. To save Nora, Damien released Grodd on Vixen's village following the African warlords' defeat. [[Commander Steel|Nathan Heywood]] (equipped with a totem) was able to send Grodd flying away from the village. Grodd is taken into custody off-screen by the Time Bureau after Mallus' death and returned to his cell in A.R.G.U.S.
* Grodd, unrelated to the Arrowverse's version, made a cameo appearance in the fourth episode of The CW's ''[[Legacies (TV series)|Legacies]]''. He is seen chasing after a character named M.G. through a dark forest before he wakes up, revealing that he was reading a Flash comic book featuring Grodd before he fell asleep.

====Animation====
* Gorilla Grodd appeared on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] animated series ''[[Challenge of the Super Friends]]'', voiced by [[Stanley Ralph Ross]]. He is one of the Flash's two villains (along with [[Captain Cold]]) that appear as members of [[Lex Luthor]]'s [[Legion of Doom]]. This version, though highly intelligent, never displays telepathic abilities. In "The Time Trap", he creates a method of time travel, which the Legion of Doom apparently uses other times. In "Revenge on Gorilla City", Grodd hatches a plot to take control of Gorilla City and use its citizens to conquer the world.
* Gorilla Grodd later appeared in the 1980s ''[[Super Friends (1980)|Super Friends]]'' version, voiced again by Stanley Ralph Ross. In the short episode "Two Gleeks Are Deadlier Than One", he and Giganta capture and replace Gleek with a robot duplicate in order to infiltrate the Super Friends and learn what they are planning. In "Revenge of Doom", Grodd was seen with the Legion of Doom when they got back together.
* Gorilla Grodd appears in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]. In the episode "Terror on Dinosaur Island!", he and his ape followers plot to devolve the human race with an E-Ray from their headquarters on Dinosaur Island. They ran into conflicts with [[Batman]] and [[Plastic Man]]. With Batman devolved into an ape, Plastic Man helps the ape Batman fight Grodd and his servants. When the E-Ray is activated, it evolved the humans back to their natural state as Batman put the E-Ray on reverse when Grodd was not looking. It even evolved Grodd to a human and ended up incarcerated at Iron Heights in the end, planning his revenge. Grodd was later shown (still in human form) in the episode "Day of the Dark Knight" escaping Iron Heights and attempting to attack Batman but stopped by the [[Green Arrow]]. The character has a heroic counterpart in a parallel universe in "Deep Cover for Batman!" which resembles Solovar; Batman almost punches the counterpart but stops short and explains 'You look like someone I know'. The original Grodd (now a gorilla again) joins [[Owlman (comics)|Owlman]], the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] and other villains in the episode "Game Over for Owlman!". Grodd is Batman's primary opponent once more in the episode "Last Bat on Earth" in which he travels to a post-apocalyptic future. There, he takes command of an army of intelligent apes and uses superior technology to defeat their opponents, a city of similarly evolved tigers; it is revealed that Grodd takes great offense to people calling him a monkey or a chimpanzee. Batman pursues Grodd to this time, enlisting [[Kamandi]]'s help in defeating Grodd. At the end, Grodd is trampled by his retreating forces and is taken back to the present in handcuffs with Batman. Grodd returns as the primary adversary of Batman, [[Detective Chimp]], [[B'wana Beast]] and [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]] in the episode "Gorillas in Our Midst" forming an alliance with [[Monsieur Mallah]] and [[Gorilla Boss]] to create the ape army G.A.S.P. (short for Gorillas and Apes Seizing Power) to take over the world. Grodd captures the undercover Detective Chimp and later captures Batman, revealing both a ploy to capture [[Gotham City]] and an obsession with Batman in the form of a utility belt, proclaiming he has had it for years, but just simply has not worn it. He and his gorilla army later invade Gotham and face off against B'wana Beast and Vixen, who his gorilla army captures and places in a zoo. They later recapture Batman and Detective Chimp when they return to Gotham and attempt to rescue Gotham, but was defeated when they use B'wana Beast's powers to both escape and to empower Batman with the form of a Bat-Griffin.
* Gorilla Grodd appears in ''[[Justice League Action]]'', voiced again by David Sobolov.

When the Justice League's bravo team arrives with [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]], Grodd witnesses Mister Mxyzptlk mix up their minds as well.

=====DC animated universe=====
[[File:Gorilla Grodd (DC Animated Universe).jpg|thumb|Gorilla Grodd as seen in ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]''.]]
Gorilla Grodd is featured in multiple animated series set in the [[DC animated universe]], voiced by [[Powers Boothe]].
* Gorilla Grodd appears in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' animated series. This version hates [[banana]]s which he resents being offered. Introduced in season one's "The Brave and the Bold", he is a fugitive from the secretive Gorilla City, a spurned would-be tyrant who vows vengeance on his fellow primates. Maintaining an e-mail relationship with scientist Dr. Sarah Corwin (voiced by [[Virginia Madsen]]), he comes to [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]] to cloak the metropolis in a similar shield as Gorilla City's. This provides him a hidden base from which to launch a nuclear assault against Gorilla City, while he controls Central City's populace with his mind-control helmet. The Flash, [[John Stewart (comics)|Green Lantern]] and Gorilla City's head of security Solovar rush to defeat Grodd himself while the [[Justice League]] stop the bombs. Grodd becomes incapacitated when he tries to use the mind-control helmet on the Flash, not knowing that the Flash had switched around various wires at high speed. Later in Gorilla City, Grodd is shown in a zoo-like prison cell, appearing as though he were brain damaged. As the League and Solovar depart from the area, the camera zooms in on Grodd's face in the episode's last few seconds as he comes to his senses and gets an angry look on his face as the banana in his hand breaks. Grodd returns in season two's "Secret Society", showcasing a different side to the villain. No longer focused on Gorilla City, Grodd becomes an opponent to the Justice League as a whole. With his loyal follower [[Giganta]], he recruits for a [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]] manipulating each member; [[Killer Frost]]'s simple enjoyment of murder, [[Sinestro]]'s hatred for all Green Lanterns, [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]]'s hatred for Superman, [[Shade (comics)|Shade]] being offered by Grodd to be a master criminal, and [[Clayface]]'s hatred for Batman and being promised by Grodd to find a way to be human again while keeping his shapeshifting abilities. It also turns out that Grodd's accident with his mind-control helmet has given him mental powers, which he utilizes in this story as a subtle type of tampering with the League's emotions. Having watched the League via secret cameras for weeks, Grodd manipulates the superhero group's feelings until his nemeses start lashing out at each other and end up walking away from the team. Having separated his nemeses, Grodd tries to capture each superhero and invades a football [[halftime show]] to try to do away with the superheroes publicly, but gets foiled when [[Martian Manhunter|J'onn J'onzz]] frees the others. Grodd's allies battle the League one last time but fails to beat them, and Grodd is subsequently defeated by Superman.
* Gorilla Grodd appears in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''. In season one's "Ultimen", Giganta teams up with [[Bizarro]] in an attempt to break Grodd out of prison, but was defeated by [[Wonder Woman]] and [[Apache Chief|Long Shadow]]; Grodd does not actually appear in the episode. In the final season, Grodd turns up as the leader of an [[Legion of Doom (Super Friends)|expended version]] of a Secret Society as a sort of [[cooperative|co-op]] for supervillains with each free to act on their own, but able to call in help should it be needed (for twenty-five percent of their spoils) against the expanded Justice League. After having the Secret Society seek out various valuable artifacts over the last season's course, Grodd reveals his master plan: to turn every human on the planet into an ape. The plan however is thwarted by the League. Unimpressed, Lex Luthor usurps Grodd's position as the Secret Society's new leader due to reclaiming the god-like power when merged with [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]]. Luthor keeps Grodd prisoner in the Secret Society's headquarters in the hopes that he will reveal how to reconstitute the living supercomputer's last remaining fragment. When Lex attempts to probe Grodd's mind, bad fortune leads to Lex switching minds with [[Wally West]] due a psychic resonance between Grodd and the Flash. When Luthor has the headquarters refit for space travel, promising the Secret Society a place of leadership in the new order with himself as absolute ruler, the spurned [[Tala (comics)|Tala]] eventually releases Grodd, arranging a mutiny within the supervillain group. Grodd and Luthor eventually finally find themselves alone together and engage in fisticuffs. Grodd attempts to use his mind-control ability on Lex, but Luthor had anticipated this and turns Grodd's own power back on himself, giving Luthor control of Grodd. After humiliating Grodd, Luthor forces him to step into an airlock. Grodd is released from Luthor's mental grip and then shot into space.

In addition to The Society, Grodd rules over Gorilla City after murdering Solovar (which is revealed by [[Doctor Fate]] and [[Atrocitus]] if either of them faces Grodd in battle) and leads a militant Gorilla Army. Grodd, his army, and the Society are confronted by Black Canary and Green Arrow. After they defeat both Catwoman and Bane and pacify Doctor Fate when Nabu tries to abduct Green Arrow and Black Canary, Grodd and his army appear, having captured Harley Quinn, before engaging either Black Canary or Green Arrow. Grodd is defeated and handcuffed but begins laughing as Brainiac's Skull Ship appears in the sky and abducts the hero couple. He is later revealed to be assisting Brainiac in collecting Earth. After the Society disbands from finding out the true nature of Brainiac's plans, Grodd goes on to confront Aquaman and Black Adam in Kahndaq with Green Arrow and Black Canary under his control to help Brainiac collect the power of the Rock of Eternity. Grodd reveals he intends to get close to Brainiac in order to learn his weaknesses and kill him at the right moment in order to take control of his Skull Ship and its technology. He also manages to take control of Blue Beetle whom he uses to trick Black Adam and Aquaman to lead him to the Rock of Eternity before he orders Blue Beetle to attack, though he is defeated. Grodd then confronts the pair but is defeated by the two and he is executed by Aquaman as payback for assisting in Brainiac's attack on Atlantis. In his single player ending, he kills Brainiac and steals his technology to enhance his telepathic power, enslaving the human race. He then begins a universal conquest using Brainiac's Skull Ship and technology. With Brainiac's Skull Ship he leads his enhanced Gorilla Army to conquer the universe as its new Emperor. Grodd has a habit of saying, "Kneel before Grodd," which is a reference to [[General Zod]].<ref>https://www.injustice.com/characters/gorilla-grodd</ref> In normal battles against The Flash, it may be stated, prior to fighting, that Grodd is his worst enemy (at least in the ''Injustice'' universe), as when Flash says that he would not wish something on his worst enemy, Grodd replies, "As yours, I'm disappointed." It is also hinted at various points in the game that Grodd's evil and possible insanity has driven him from a herbivorous lifestyle to a more carnivorous one, a drastic differentiation from the villain's usual characterizations, as he reveals to Blue Beetle (when he faces him in battle) that while most gorillas are herbivores, he is not, and during mid-battle clashes, when called out by Blue Beetle for threatening to eat humans' brains, he outright calls himself a "recreational carnivore."
