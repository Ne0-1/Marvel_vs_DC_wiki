==Fictional character biography==
Gorilla Grodd is a hyper-intelligent [[telepathy|telepathic]] [[gorilla]] with the power to [[mind control|control the minds]] of others. At one time he was nothing more than an average ape, but after an alien spacecraft ([[retcon]]ned from a radioactive meteor, the same one that empowered [[Hector Hammond]]) crashes in his African home, Grodd and his troupe are imbued with super-intelligence by the ship's pilot. Grodd and fellow gorilla [[Solovar]] also develop telepathic and [[psychokinesis|telekinetic]] powers. Taking the alien as their leader, the gorillas construct a super advanced home named [[Gorilla City]]. The gorillas live in peace until their home is discovered by prying explorers. Grodd forces one of the explorers to kill the alien, and takes over Gorilla City, planning to conquer the world next. Solovar telepathically contacts [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] to warn him of the evil gorilla's plans, and Grodd is defeated. The villain manages to return again and again to plague the Flash and his allies.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

In a confrontation with [[Wally West]], Grodd increases the brain power of most of the animals in [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]]. He hopes to endanger the lives of all the humans, but this plan backfires because some of the pets are too loyal.  Grodd's plans are defeated by the Flash with the assistance of the [[Pied Piper (comics)|Pied Piper]], [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]], and [[Rex the Wonder Dog]].

At one point, the immortal villain [[Vandal Savage]] kidnaps Titans member [[Lilith (DC Comics)|Omen]] and uses her to form the perfect team of adversaries for the [[Teen Titans]]. Savage approaches Grodd, offering him membership in this new anti-Titans group, Tartarus. Savage sweetens the offer with promises of power and [[immortality]]. Grodd joins Tartarus on their mission to synthesize the immortal blood of the [[H.I.V.E.]] Mistress, Addie Kane. Savage seeks to create a serum that will grant immortality. Their schemes are thwarted when the Titans intervene, and Tartarus retreats. [[Garth (comics)|Tempest]] later leads a rescue mission to save Omen from Savage. During the rescue attempt, Tartarus battles the Titans, but collapses upon itself due to each member having a different agenda. This is because Omen had purposely chosen members who would not work well together. When [[Siren (DC Comics)|Siren]] switches alliances during the battle and aids Tempest in escaping, the Tartarus members go their separate ways and the group disbands.

One of Grodd’s widest-ranging schemes was to arrange Solovar's assassination and manipulate Gorilla City into war against humanity, with the aid of a "shadow cabinet" of prominent gorillas called Simian Scarlet. In the course of this, Grodd absorbs too much neural energy from his fellow apes, leaving him with the intelligence of a normal gorilla<ref>''[[Martian Manhunter]] Annual'' #2, 1999</ref>. He has since recovered, and a failed attempt to set up a base in Florida leads to his capture and incarceration in [[Iron Heights]].

Grodd is also seen in the ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' arc "Public Enemies" (''Superman/Batman'' #1 &ndash; #7) controlling numerous villains and heroes in order to take down [[Superman]] and [[Batman]] for the prize of 1 billion dollars offered by then [[U.S. President]] [[Lex Luthor]]. Despite his use of foes such as [[Mongul]], [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]], [[Lady Shiva]], and [[Nightshade (comics)|Nightshade]], Superman and Batman are able to deduce the mind behind the attacks, and quickly dispose of Grodd.

He is responsible for crippling the Flash's friend Hunter Zolomon, resulting in his transformation into the villainous [[Zoom (comics)|Zoom]] when Hunter tries to change the event so it never happened. Hunter would often think about how Grodd used him as a plaything in that fight while talking it over with the Flash<ref>''Flash'' vol. 2, #193 (February 2003)</ref>.

Grodd attacks the International [[Ultramarine Corps]], ravaging. He ravaged the African city of Kinshasa, literally eating many hostages, so the Corps would take their floating city to it. Grodd grounds their city and neutralizes many of their members. During the course of this incident, [[Squire (comics)#Beryl Hutchinson|Beryl]] informs the team that Grodd ranks number three on the latest "Global Most Wanted". He has made no fewer than eighteen attempts to eliminate all traces of humanity from the face of the Earth.

One of the attempts occurs in ''Son of Ambush Bug'' #5 (November 1986). Grodd had traveled to the Late Cretaceous "''to wipe out all traces of human evolution from the time stream''" (despite the fact that, at this point in time, the ancestors of humanity would be his own ancestors as well). His plans are apparently shattered by a combination of the sudden appearance of [[Titano]], and Ambush Bug waking from a nightmare. Whether or not Grodd's plan is a failure or not is disputable: Ambush Bug awakes to "Anchor-Ape Clark Kong".

In the 1991 ''[[Angel and the Ape]]'' limited series, Grodd is revealed as the grandfather of Angel's partner Sam Simeon.  This is conflict with ''[[Martian Manhunter]] Annual'' #2 (1999), which states that Sam Simeon is Grodd’s brother.  

In the ''Justice League of America Wedding Special'', Gorilla Grodd is among the villains seen as members of the [[Injustice League#Injustice League Unlimited|Injustice League Unlimited]].

In ''JLA Classified'' #1-3, DC, 3-issue story arc, 2004, Grodd and his forces attack the [[Ultramarine Corps]]. Grodd has most of the citizens they are protecting killed. He personally eats some of the humans.

In ''[[Salvation Run]]'' #3, Grodd teams up with the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] to gather their own faction of the exiled supervillains. In #4, he kills [[Monsieur Mallah]] and [[Brain (comics)|The Brain]], only to be knocked off a cliff by the Joker. He is seen alive in the final issue, attempting to deliver payback to the Joker.

In ''Justice League of America'' #21, Grodd is shown among the members of [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]]'s new [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]] and placed in the Inner Circle. In ''[[Final Crisis]]'' #4, Gorilla Grodd was among the high-ranked superheroes and supervillains that were turned into [[Justifiers]]. In ''Final Crisis: Resist'', he is sent to apprehend [[Snapper Carr]] and Cheetah, but fails.

==Powers and abilities==
Grodd's psionic abilities allow him to place other beings under his mental control. Grodd can also project telekinetic force beams, telekinetically transmute matter, and transfer his consciousness into other bodies. He possesses great physical strength far exceeding that of an ordinary gorilla. He is a scientific genius who has mastered Gorilla City's advanced technology and who has created many incredible inventions of his own.<ref name="dc-ency"/><ref>http://www.dccomics.com/dcu/heroes_and_villains/?hv=origin_stories/gorilla_grodd&p=2</ref>

==Other versions==
===The Antimatter Universe Version===
Gorilla Grodd has a counterpart on the post-Crisis antimatter universe's Earth called General Grodd who is a member of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains#Justice Underground|Justice Underground]].  He is a freedom fighter from a militaristic ape nation.<ref> ''JLA Secret Files 2004'' </ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
====''Challenge of the Super Friends''====
On the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] animated series ''[[Challenge of the Super Friends]]'', Gorilla Grodd is one of two Flash villains (along with [[Captain Cold]]) that appear as members of [[Lex Luthor]]'s [[Legion of Doom (comics)|Legion of Doom]]. In one episode, Grodd hatches a plot to take control of Gorilla City and use its citizens to conquer the world. He later appeared in the [[Super Friends (1980)|Super Friends]] short episodes "Revenge of Doom", and "Two Gleeks Are Deadlier Than One". It should be noted that this version of Grodd, though highly intelligent, never displays telepathic abilities.<br>He was played by [[Stanley Ralph Ross]].

====''The Flash''====
Gorilla Grodd was mentioned in passing by the character Nightshade in the episode titled "''Deadly Nightshade''" of the live action [[The Flash (TV series)|''Flash'' TV series]] from the early 1990s. He was a crime boss in the 1950s, who worked out of Central City's Helltown, and adversary of Nightshade.

===DC animated universe===
[[Image:Cartoon grodd.jpg|thumb|Gorilla Grodd in "''The Justice League''".]]
Gorilla Grodd is a recurring villain in the [[DC Animated Universe]]. He is played by voice-actor [[Powers Boothe]] in ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' and reprised the role of Grodd in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''. Generally, he is referred to as just "Grodd", although Flash mentions him as "Gorilla Grodd" in the episode "''Comfort and Joy''"; [[Dr. Fate]] does the same in the episode "The Great Brain Robbery".

====''Justice League''====
In his first appearance, the two-part episode "The Brave and the Bold", Grodd is a fugitive from the secretive Gorilla City, a spurned would-be tyrant who vows vengeance on his fellow primates. Maintaining an e-mail relationship with [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]] scientist Dr. Sarah Corwin, he comes to Central City to cloak the metropolis in a similar shield as Gorilla City's. This provides him a hidden base from which to launch a nuclear assault against Gorilla City, while he controls the populace of Central City with his mind-control helmet. While the League hurries to stop the bombs, Flash, [[John Stewart (comics)|Green Lantern]], and [[Solovar]] (re-imagined as the head of Gorilla City Security rather than its ruler) rush to defeat Grodd himself. Grodd becomes incapacitated when he tries to use the mind-control helmet on Flash, not knowing that Flash had switched around various wires. Grodd's return in "Secret Society" showcases a different side of the villain. No longer focused on Gorilla City, Grodd becomes an opponent to the League as a whole. With his loyal follower [[Giganta]], he recruits [[Killer Frost]], [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]], [[Shade (comics)|Shade]], [[Sinestro]], and [[Clayface (Matt Hagen)|Clayface]] to make a sort of anti-League dubbed "[[Secret Society of Super Villains|the Secret Society]]". Revealed in this episode is that Grodd's accident with his mind-control helmet has given him mental powers, which he utilizes in this story as a subtle type of tampering with the League's emotions. Having watched the League via secret cameras for weeks, Grodd manipulates their feelings until the Leaguers start lashing out at each other and end up walking away from the team. Having separated them, Grodd tries to capture each Leaguer and invades a football halftime show to do away with the heroes publicly, only to be foiled by [[Martian Manhunter|J'onn J'onzz]], who frees his teammates. The Society battles the League one last time, but fail to beat them and subsequently, Grodd is defeated by [[Superman]]. Of note in these episodes is that Grodd's romantic preferences become clear: he has a taste for human females, like Corwin or the artificially-made-human Giganta.

====''Justice League Unlimited''====
In the first season ''Justice League Unlimited'' episode "Ultimen", Giganta teams up with [[Bizzaro]] in an attempt to break Grodd out of prison – only to be defeated by Wonder Woman and Long Shadow. (Grodd does not actually appear in the episode, however.) In the third season, Grodd turns up as the leader of an expanded Secret Society. As he describes it, the new Secret Society is a sort of [[cooperative|co-op]] for supervillains – each free to act on their own, but (for twenty percent of their spoils) able to call in help should they need it against the expanded League. After having the Secret Society seek out various valuable artifacts, Grodd reveals his master plan: to turn every human on the planet into an ape. The plan, however, is thwarted by the Justice League. Subsequently, an unimpressed [[Lex Luthor]], pulls his gun and says that "I wasn't going to do this for another few weeks but seriously, turning all of humanity into apes? That was your master plan?" He shoots Grodd and usurps his position as the new leader of the Secret Society. Obsessed with reclaiming the godlike power he briefly tasted when merged with the now-destroyed [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]], Luthor keeps Grodd prisoner in the Secret Society's headquarters in the hopes that he will reveal how to reconstitute the living supercomputer from the last remaining fragment. With the discovery that Brainiac had a base in deep space that was subsequently destroyed (see "Twilight") Luthor has the Secret Society refit the headquarters for space travel, promising them a place of leadership in the new order with himself as absolute ruler. Because of Luthor's heavy-handed leadership and romantic disinterest, the spurned [[Tala (comics)|Tala]] eventually releases Grodd, who then arranges a mutiny with many other villains. Luthor uses his intellect and resourcefulness to counter his adversaries' powers. In the final battle, Grodd and Luthor finally find themselves alone together, and engage in fisticuffs. Grodd thoroughly dominates the fight and, after pummeling Luthor into helplessness, attempts to use his mind-control ability on him. However, Luthor had anticipated this and wore a device that turns Grodd's power back on him, giving Luthor control of Grodd. Luthor forces him to step into an airlock after first humiliating him by making him bow down and acknowledge Luthor as his master. Grodd is released into space to his death, all the while screaming threats.

===''Batman: The Brave and the Bold''===
Gorilla Grodd appears in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "Terror on Dinosaur Island!" played by [[John DiMaggio]]. He and his ape followers plotted to devolve the human race with an E-Ray from their headquarters on Dinosaur Island. They ran into conflicts with [[Batman]] and [[Plastic Man]]. With Batman devolved to an ape, Plastic Man helps the Ape-Batman fight Gorilla Grodd and his servants. When the E-Ray is activated, it evolved the humans (Batman put the E-Ray on reverse when Gorilla Grodd wasn't looking) back to their natural state. It even evolved Gorilla Grodd to a human who ended up incarcerated at Iron Heights in the end planning his revenge.

He was later shown in "Day of the Dark Knight" escaping Iron Heights (still in human form) and attempting to attack Batman, but stopped by [[Green Arrow]]. Gorilla Grodd has an heroic counterpart in a parallel universe in "Deep Cover for Batman!".  This version resembles Solovar. Batman almost punches the counterpart but stops short and explains, "You look like someone I know." The original Grodd, now a gorilla again, joins [[Owlman (comics)|Owlman]] and other villains in "Game Over for Owlman!". Grodd and the [[Question (comics)|Question]] are caught by [[Libra (DC Comics)|Equinox]] in the teaser for "Mystery in Space!". Batman rescues Question, but leaves Grodd hanging by the flames.  He also makes a small appearance in "Legends of the Dark-Mite!".  He is summoned by [[Bat-Mite]] to prove Batman's mettle in combat, but apparently was reading.  He is quickly replaced by [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]].  Later, when the Mite decides to assume the role of Batman himself, Batman talks the Mite through an encounter with Grodd -- who is disposed of by slipping on a banana peel, a play off of JLU Grodd's oft-noted distaste for the fruit.

Grodd is Batman's primary opponent once more in the episode "The Last Bat on Earth!" in which he travels to a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] future. There, he takes command of an army of intelligent apes and uses superior technology to defeat their opponents, a city of similarly-evolved tigers. Batman pursues Grodd to this time, where he enlists [[Kamandi]]'s help in defeating Grodd. At the end, Grodd is trampled by his retreating forces, and is taken back to the present in handcuffs with Batman.
