'''Gorilla Grodd''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[DC Comics]], primarily as an opponent of [[The Flash]].

==History==
He is a hyper-intelligent [[telepathy|telepathic]] [[supervillain]] with the power to [[mind control|control the minds]] of others.  He is also, incidentally, a [[gorilla]]. At one time he was nothing more than an average ape, but after an alien spacecraft crashed in his African home, Grodd and his troops were imbued with super-intelligence by the ship's pilot. Grodd and fellow gorilla [[SOLOVAR|Solovar]] also developed telepathic and [[telekinetic]] powers. Taking the alien as their leader, the gorillas constructed a super advanced home named [[Gorilla City]]. The gorillas lived in peace until their home was discovered by prying explorers. Grodd forced one of the explorers to kill the alien, and took over Gorilla City, planning to take the world next. Solovar telepathically contacted [[The Flash|Barry Allen]] to warn him of the evil gorilla's plans, and Grodd was defeated. But the villain would return again and again to plague the Flash and his Allies.
 
At one point, the immortal villain [[Vandal Savage]] kidnapped Titans member [[Lilith (DC Comics)|Omen]] and used her to formulate the perfect team of adversaries for the [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]]. Savage approached Grodd, offering him membership in this new anti-Titans group, [[Tartarus (comics)|Tartarus]]. Savage sweetened the offer with promises of power and [[immortality]]. Grodd joined Tartarus on their mission to synthesize the immortal blood of the [[H.I.V.E.]] Mistress, Addie Kane. Savage sought to create a serum that would grant immortality. Their schemes were thwarted when the Titans intervened, and Tartarus retreated. [[Tempest (comics)|Tempest]] later led a rescue mission to save Omen from Savage.  During the rescue attempt, Tartarus battled the Titans, but collapsed upon itself due to each member having a different agenda. This was because Omen had purposely chosen members who wouldn't work well together when forced to formulate a team for Savage. Particularly, Siren switched alliances during the battle and aided Tempest in escaping. Following these events, Tartarus members went their separate ways and the group disbanded.

Grodd's psionic abilities allow him to place other beings under his mental control. Grodd can also project mental attack beams and transfer his consciousness into other bodies. Moreover, he possesses great physical strength far exceeding that of an ordinary gorilla. He is a scientific genius who has mastered Gorilla City's advanced technology and who has created many incredible inventions of his own.

One of Groddâ€™s widest-ranging schemes was to arrange Solovar's [[assassination]] and manipulate Gorilla City into war against humanity. In the course of this, Grodd absorbed too much neural energy from his fellow apes, leaving him with the intelligence of a normal gorilla (''[[Martian Manhunter]] Annual #2'', 1999). He has since recovered, and a failed attempt to set up a base in [[Florida]] led to his capture and incarceration in [[Iron Heights]].

He is responsible for crippling the Flash's friend Hunter Zolomon, resulting in his transformation into the villainous [[Zoom (comics)|Zoom]].

==Gorilla Grodd of Earth-3==
Gorilla Grodd has a counterpart on Earth-3, the Anti-Matter Earth, called General Grodd who is a member of the [[Justice Underground]]. He is a freedom fighter from a militaristic ape nation.

==Other Media==
Gorilla Grodd was a member of the [[Legion of Doom]] in the ''[[Superfriends]]'' cartoons where one plot of his was taking control of Gorilla City in one episode. He is voiced by the late [[Stanley Ralph Ross]].

Gorilla Grodd was featured in the Justice League 2-part episodes ''The Brave and the Bold'' and ''Secret Society''. In ''The Brave and the Bold,'' he got help from Dr. Sarah Corwin, a female scientist, and used a mind-control helmet to have some radioactive isotopes stolen to power an invention that made Central City invisible like Gorilla City and sent missiles to blow up Gorilla City. The Justice League managed to thwart his plan. 

In ''Secret Society,'' He and his follower [[Giganta]] recruited [[Killer Frost]], [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]], [[Shade (comics)|Shade]], and [[Sinestro]] to form the Secret Society to fight the Justice League. Before they did that, they raided [[Intergang|Morgan Edge's]] mansion to steal the canisters containing [[Clayface]] to add to their group. After defeating the Justice League once, they were finally defeated. In the third season of  ''[[Justice League Unlimited]],'' Gorilla Grodd is the leader of the Legion. Gorilla Grodd is voiced by [[Powers Boothe]].
