==Fictional character biography==
{{Plot|date=March 2015}}
Gorilla Grodd is a hyper-intelligent [[telepathy|telepathic]] [[gorilla]] able to [[mind control|control the minds]] of others. He was an average ape until an alien spacecraft ([[retcon]]ned from a radioactive meteor, which also empowered [[Hector Hammond]]) crashed in his African home. Grodd and his [[wiktionary:troupe|troupe]] were imbued with super intelligence by the ship's pilot. Grodd and fellow gorilla [[Solovar]] also developed telepathic and [[psychokinesis|telekinetic]] powers. Led by the alien, the gorillas constructed the super-advanced [[Gorilla City]]. The gorillas lived in peace until their home was discovered by explorers. Grodd forced one of the explorers to kill the alien and took over Gorilla City, planning to conquer the world next. Solovar telepathically contacted [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] to warn him of the evil gorilla's plans, and Grodd was defeated. The villain manages to return again and again to plague the Flash and his allies.<ref name="dc-ency" />

In his first Pre-Crisis appearance he met the Flash while searching for Solovar, who had been imprisoned, during a trip to the human world. Grodd probed Solovar's mind to find the secret of mind control so he could control Gorilla City using the inhabitants to take over the world. Solovar breaks out of his cage and tells the Flash. The Flash defeats Grodd and temporarily knocks the power of mind control from him. Using his restored power; he overcomes his guard taking over an underground winged race, attempted to use a machine to eliminate the intelligence of the other gorillas. Flash finds out from Solovar where Grodd has escaped and destroys the machine. The winged people are freed of his control. Grodd is imprisoned again. Heavily guarded, Grodd summons a burrowing machine which he uses to escape. Grodd transformed himself human and started a factory to create a pill that will give him vast mental powers. After easily stopping the Flash, Grodd unexpectedly turns into a gorilla again, where his brain is no longer evolved enough for his powers to work. He tries to get to the machine that turned him human, but Flash molds handcuffs for Grodd and takes him back to Gorilla City. Grodd devises a means of transporting his mind to another body while his original one dies, taking over a man in Central City, and is again arrested. Later he instigates the Flash's Rogues Gallery, breaking them out of jail to distract the Flash after transferring his mind to that of 'Freddy', a gorilla in a zoo. Thanks to Solovar, the Flash learned of Grodd's escape. Ironically, Grodd, despite using radiation to stop the Flash moving at super speed, is defeated by the gorilla's mate when she hears him mention another gorilla. He and Freddy are restored to their normal bodies.

In a confrontation with [[Wally West]], Grodd increases the brain power of most of the animals in [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]]. He hopes to endanger the lives of all the humans, but this plan backfires because some of the pets are too loyal to their humans. Grodd's plans are defeated by the Flash, assisted by the [[Pied Piper (comics)|Pied Piper]], [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]], and [[Rex the Wonder Dog]].

Immortal villain [[Vandal Savage]] kidnaps Titans member [[Lilith (DC Comics)|Omen]] using her to form the perfect team of adversaries for the [[Teen Titans]]. Savage approaches Grodd, offering him membership in this new anti-Titans group, Tartarus. Savage offers promises of power and [[immortality]]. Grodd joins Tartarus on their mission to synthesize the immortal blood of the [[H.I.V.E.]] Mistress, Addie Kane. Savage seeks to create a serum that will grant immortality. Their schemes are thwarted when the Titans intervene. [[Garth (comics)|Tempest]] later leads a rescue mission to save Omen from Savage. During the rescue attempt, Tartarus collapses upon itself due to each member having a different agenda, because Omen had purposely chosen members who would not work well together. When [[Siren (DC Comics)|Siren]] switches alliances during the battle and aids Tempest in escaping, the Tartarus members go their separate ways.

Grodd has made no fewer than eighteen attempts to eliminate all traces of humanity from the face of the earth. In ''Son of Ambush Bug'' #5 (November 1986). He traveled to the Late Cretaceous "''to wipe out all traces of human evolution from the time stream''" (despite the fact that, at this point in time, the ancestors of humanity would be his own ancestors as well). His plans are shattered by the sudden appearance of [[Titano]] and [[Ambush Bug]] waking from a nightmare. Whether or not Grodd's plan is a failure is disputable.

In the final issue of ''[[Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew]]'', Grodd travels to Earth-C in an attempt to conquer it, but is defeated by the efforts of the Zoo Crew (plus [[Beast Boy|Changeling]] of the Teen Titans).<ref>''Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew'' #20, November 1983</ref>

In the 1991 ''[[Angel and the Ape]]'' limited series, Grodd is revealed as the grandfather of Angel's partner, Sam Simeon. This is in conflict with ''[[Martian Manhunter]] Annual'' #2 (1999), which states that Sam Simeon is Grodd’s brother.

In the ''Justice League of America Wedding Special'', Gorilla Grodd is among the villains seen as members of the [[Injustice League#Injustice League Unlimited|Injustice League Unlimited]].

During the ''[[Final Night]]'', Grodd attempted to use a mystical talisman called the Heart of Darkness (normally effective only in eclipses) that brought out the 'inner beast' of humans, turning the population of the town of Leesburg into feral monsters, including [[Matrix (comics)|Supergirl]]. However, Supergirl was eventually able to fight off Grodd's influence,  allowing her to oppose Grodd until the sun was restored. Grodd is assumed killed when an icicle fell into him.

One of Grodd’s widest ranging schemes was to arrange [[Solovar]]'s assassination and manipulate Gorilla City into war against humanity, with the aid of a "shadow cabinet" of prominent gorillas called Simian Scarlet. In the course of this, Grodd absorbs too much neural energy from his fellow apes, leaving him with the intelligence of a normal gorilla.<ref>''[[Martian Manhunter]] Annual'' #2, 1999</ref> He has since recovered, and a failed attempt to set up a base in Florida leads to his capture and incarceration in [[Iron Heights]].

Grodd had been trapped inside the human body of an overweight street bum. He was attacked by a gang known as the Vultures. One of them commented on how their member Iggo had the strength of a gorilla, which reminded Grodd of his true form. Suddenly changing back to his original shape and size, he quickly defeated the gang, making them believe that they are burning in molten lava by using his telepathic abilities. Reading the minds of the crooks, he saw that one of the former members of their gang was a friend of the Flash, and a plan began to form in his mind.

Grodd found another space rock, identical to the one that had given him his powers, and contacted Hector Hammond, a human who had also gained similar powers. Grodd was able to take control of Gorilla City after increasing his evolution, but was defeated once more.

Grodd is also seen in the ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' arc "Public Enemies" (''Superman/Batman'' #1&nbsp;– #7) controlling numerous villains and heroes in order to take down [[Superman]] and [[Batman]] for the prize of one billion dollars offered by then [[U.S. President]] [[Lex Luthor]]. Despite his use of foes such as [[Mongul]], [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]], [[Lady Shiva]], and [[Nightshade (DC Comics)|Nightshade]], Batman is able to deduce the mind behind the attacks and they quickly dispose of Grodd.

He is responsible for crippling the Flash's friend Hunter Zolomon, resulting in his transformation into the villainous [[Zoom (comics)|Zoom]] when Hunter tries to change the event so it never happened. Hunter would often think about how Grodd used him as a plaything in that fight while talking it over with the Flash.<ref>''Flash'' vol. 2, #193 (February 2003)</ref>

In ''[[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]'' #23, Grodd makes a deal with Grimm to get [[Blockbuster (DC Comics)|Blockbuster]] an ape heart.<ref>''Birds of Prey'' #23</ref>

In ''JLA Classified'' #1-3, DC, 3-issue story arc, 2004, Grodd and his forces attack the [[Ultramarine Corps]]. Grodd has most of the citizens they are protecting killed. He personally eats some of the humans. During the course of this incident, [[Squire (comics)#Beryl Hutchinson|Beryl]] informs the team that Grodd ranks number three on the latest "Global Most Wanted".

In the ''[[Salvation Run]]'' mini-series, Grodd teams up with the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] to gather their own faction of the exiled supervillains.<ref>''Salvation Run'' #3 (March 2008)</ref> He kills [[Monsieur Mallah]] and the [[Brain (comics)|Brain]], and was knocked off a cliff by the Joker.<ref>''Salvation Run'' #4 (April 2008)</ref> He is seen alive and attempting to deliver payback to the Joker.<ref>''Salvation Run'' #7 (July 2008)</ref>

In ''Justice League of America'' #21, Grodd is shown among the members of [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]]'s new [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]] and placed in the Inner Circle. In ''[[Final Crisis]]'' storyline, Gorilla Grodd was among the high ranked superheroes and supervillains that were turned into [[Justifiers]].<ref>''Final Crisis'' #4</ref> He is sent to apprehend [[Snapper Carr]] and Cheetah, but fails.<ref>''Final Crisis: Resist'' one-shot</ref>

===The New 52===
In the new continuity of [[The New 52]] (a reboot of the DC Comics universe), before Flash makes earthfall into the super ape's midst, Grodd was crown prince of Gorilla City speaking with his father; King Grodd, about how the light that touched their fair city was destiny. Destiny which had once again tilted its hand and brought their culture to being, but Grodd rebuffs these claims stating their destiny was their own to command, and that they were destined for dominance.<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 4) #7 (March 2012)</ref> the Flash (Barry Allen) first encounters Gorilla Grodd after a trip through the Speed Force which strands him in their hidden community, all of which just shortly after Grodd has been newly crowned as gorilla king after killing his father & consuming his mind.<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 4) #8 (April 2012)</ref>

The Flash is hailed as a messenger spoken of in gorilla prophecy by all but Grodd who sees the interloper as a threat to his ascension and designs for world conquest. When told of the treachery planned by the Ape Elders from his most trusted general, Grodd led a personal execution detail in an attempt to kill Barry and assume the mantel of the Light bringer. But The Flash foils Grodd's attempts to by outmaneuvering him until King Grodd causes the caves containing Gorilla Cities history to collapse upon himself, knocking him unconscious, allowing the Flash to escape.<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 4) #9 (May 2012)</ref>

After having been unearthed by General Silverback while still buried beneath the rubble of the ruined cave, Grodd eventually recuperated after his previous battle with Flash. He found that he still had some followers among the ape army and would eventually slaughter most of the elders, saving one needed for his invasion plans.<ref name="The Flash 2013">''The Flash'' (vol. 4) #17 (April 2013)</ref> Grodd returns and attacks Central City with an army of gorilla soldiers searching for payback against The Messenger.<ref>''Flash Annual'' (vol. 4) #1</ref> After a while of waiting out the battle, Gorilla Grodd would make his way to one of Dr. Darwin Elias's labs which contain canisters of Flash's excess speed energy,<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 4) #13 (December 2012)</ref> consuming these batteries temporarily supercharges Grodd's own Speed Force evolved physiology enabling him enough speed and power to overwhelm the flash nearly killing him.<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 4) #16 (March 2013)</ref>

During the "[[Forever Evil]]" storyline, Gorilla Grodd returns to Central City during a ceremony commemorating Flash between the humans and gorillas at the time when [[Ultraman (comics)|Ultraman]] had caused an eclipse. Gorilla Grodd, brandishing several new powers courtesy of the light, proceeds to take control of Central City as its king and renames it Grodd City.<ref name="Flash Vol. 4 #23.1">''Flash'' Vol. 4 #23.1</ref> Eventually growing bored with this, Grodd uses his hightened abilities to take off, the rest of his apes following him to parts unknown.

==Powers and abilities==
Grodd's psionic abilities allow him to place other beings under his mental control and transfer his consciousness into other bodies. Grodd also has (on occasion) vast telekinetic abilities ranging from force beams, telekinetic transmutation of matter and lifting thousands of tons mentally. In recent issues he has shown the ability to absorb intelligence through the consumption of human brains. He possesses great superhuman strength far exceeding that of an ordinary gorilla. He is a scientific genius who has mastered Gorilla City's advanced technology and who has created many incredible inventions of his own. He also uses large laser guns.<ref name="dc-ency"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dccomics.com/dcu/heroes_and_villains/?hv=origin_stories/gorilla_grodd&p=2 |title=DCU &#124; Heroes and Villains |publisher=Dccomics.com |date=2010-04-21 |accessdate=2011-01-16}}</ref> His thought process still operates at a relatively human rate of speed; the Flashes have shown some degree of immunity to his telepathic illusions by moving so fast that their thoughts process Grodd's illusions in slow motion. In one story, Grodd either gains or strengthens his already vast psychokinetic abilities via ingesting a pill he develops after evolving himself into a human, enabling him to control the forces of nature such. But after he turns back, he loses this power as his brain is not evolved enough, in later stories however Grodd has been seen using both his psionic attributes openly without the need of accelerated evolution. He was able to engage [[Kalibak]] in hand-to-hand combat but was visibly not quite as strong as Kalibak.{{volume needed|date=November 2014|c=y}}

In the New 52 reboot of DC Continuity, Grodd like all the super apes of Gorilla City gained their powers from [[Speed Force|The Light]]; his people's coining term for Flash's speed force, the very embodiment of which represents relative space and time. Being of noble blood King Grodd is tougher, stronger, quicker and far more physically and/or mentally dynamic than other members of his evolved species. He boasts enhanced gorilla strength, enough to easily rend flesh from bone, pick up and/or smash cars and injuring Flash through his speed aura, being durable enough to resist supersonic punches from the Flash, rip his way out of barbed wire unharmed and even survive impacts from a charging mammoth affected by the speed force.<ref name="The Flash 2013"/><ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 4) #14 (January 2013)</ref> Has sharp enough reflexes to keep up with even the most nimble meta-humans with relative ease as he was able to grasp at Flash more than once while he was running, having intercepted many of his high-speed attacks more than once. Another facet to his physiology is that he along with other apes like him can assimilate both the knowledge and powers of enemies who they kill by devouring their brains, a process dubbed by their forefathers as "Cerecorbis". This process increases Grodd's intelligence bestowing him with a super genius IQ on top of whatever memories their vanquished enemies had as well as any abilities they might have possessed.<ref>Aquaman (vol. 7) #37 (January 2015)</ref> Via direct ingestion of The Light's energies he gains enhanced speed and further augmented dynamism not only enabling to effortlessly keep up with, but outright overpower Flash in a straight forward fight. Though this augmentation was short lived as the speed force batteries he drained to get his jump were a finite source causing him to shrivel & weaken over time. Thanks to his time trapped within the force dimension however, Grodd grained an even greater acceleration of his development. Not only retaining his previous abilities of bolstered strength and superspeed; but also accelerating his developmental process granting him telepathy much like what his species elders grow into with age over time, as well as telekinesis which is unique to him and him alone.<ref name="Flash Vol. 4 #23.1"/>

===Antimatter Universe===
Gorilla Grodd has a counterpart on the post-Crisis antimatter universe's Earth called General Grodd who is a member of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains#Justice Underground|Justice Underground]]. He is a freedom fighter from a militaristic ape nation.<ref>''JLA Secret Files 2004''</ref>

===Flashpoint===
In the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' timeline, Gorilla Grodd has succeeded in overthrowing Solovar and taken over Gorilla City. Gorilla Grodd began a campaign to control all of Africa. Despite his conquest being a great success, Gorilla Grodd feels unfulfilled since none of his enemies have been able to prove a challenge to him and the war between Aquaman and Wonder Woman has overshadowed his actions, constantly frustrating him. He soon begins to feel bored by his accomplishments since they prove far too easy for him and often lets his enemies live, hoping for them to become greater challenges in the future. He also decides to begin a campaign to control Europe, knowing perfectly well that this action will make him a target for the Atlanteans and Amazons.<ref>''Flashpoint: Grodd of War'' one-shot (June 2011)</ref> Gorilla Grodd arrives at the scene to attack during the Atlantean/Amazon war.<ref>''Flashpoint'' #5 (August 2011)</ref>

==In other media==

===Television===
* Gorilla Grodd appeared on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] animated series ''[[Challenge of the Super Friends]]'', voiced by [[Stanley Ralph Ross]]. He is one of the Flash's two villains (along with [[Captain Cold]]) that appear as members of [[Lex Luthor]]'s [[Legion of Doom]]. It should be noted that this version, though highly intelligent, never displays telepathic abilities. In "The Time Trap", he creates a method of time travel, which the Legion of Doom apparently uses other times. In "Revenge on Gorilla City", Grodd hatches a plot to take control of Gorilla City and use its citizens to conquer the world.
* Gorilla Grodd later appeared in ''[[Super Friends (1980)|Super Friends]]'', voiced again by Stanley Ralph Ross. In the short episode "Two Gleeks Are Deadlier Than One", he and Giganta capture Gleek and replace him with a robot duplicate in order to infiltrate the Super Friends and learn what they are planning. In "Revenge of Doom", Grodd was seen with the Legion of Doom when they got back together.
* Gorilla Grodd appears in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]. In the episode "Terror on Dinosaur Island!", he and his ape followers plotted to devolve the human race with an E-Ray from their headquarters on Dinosaur Island. They ran into conflicts with [[Batman]] and [[Plastic Man]]. With Batman devolved to an ape, Plastic Man helps the ape Batman fight Grodd and his servants. When the E-Ray is activated, it evolved the humans (Batman put the E-Ray on reverse when Grodd was not looking) back to their natural state. It even evolved Grodd to a human who ended up incarcerated at Iron Heights in the end, planning his revenge. He was later shown in "Day of the Dark Knight" escaping Iron Heights (still in human form) and attempting to attack Batman, but stopped by [[Green Arrow]]. Gorilla Grodd has a heroic counterpart in a parallel universe in "Deep Cover for Batman!" (which resembles Solovar). Batman almost punches the counterpart but stops short and explains "You look like someone I know". The original Grodd (now a gorilla again) joins [[Owlman (comics)|Owlman]], the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] and other villains in "Game Over for Owlman!". Grodd and the [[Question (comics)|Question]] are caught by [[Libra (DC Comics)|Equinox]] in the teaser for "Mystery in Space". Batman rescues Question, but leaves Grodd hanging by the flames. He also makes a small appearance in "Legends of the Dark-Mite". He is summoned by [[Bat-Mite]] to prove Batman's mettle in combat, but apparently was reading. He is quickly replaced by [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]]. Later, when Bat-Mite decides to assume the role of Batman himself, Batman talks Bat-Mite through an encounter with Grodd disposing of by slipping on a banana peel. Grodd is Batman's primary opponent once more in the episode "Last Bat on Earth" in which he travels to a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] future. There, he takes command of an army of intelligent apes and uses superior technology to defeat their opponents, a city of similarly-evolved tigers (It is revealed that Grodd takes great offense to people calling him a monkey or a chimpanzee). Batman pursues Grodd to this time, where he enlists [[Kamandi]]'s help in defeating Grodd. At the end, Grodd is trampled by his retreating forces, and is taken back to the present in handcuffs with Batman. Grodd later appears in the episode "Mayhem of the Music Meister" attempting to steal a new communications satellite alongside [[Clock King]] and [[Black Manta]]. They are confronted by Green Arrow, [[Aquaman]], and [[Black Canary]], but are forced to sing and dance due to the Music Meister's harmonious hypnotics. They are later saved and defeated once freed from the Music Meister's control, and are sent to [[Arkham Asylum]], where they later participate in the Drives Us Bats song, where it is revealed that he has a tire swing in his cell. Grodd appears briefly in the episode "Sidekicks Assemble" as a holographic opponent for [[Dick Grayson|Robin]], [[Roy Harper (comics)|Speedy]] and [[Garth (comics)|Aqualad]] to fight. Grodd returns as the primary adversary of Batman, [[Detective Chimp]], [[B'wana Beast]] and [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]] in the episode "Gorillas in Our Midst", forming an alliance with [[Monsieur Mallah]] and [[Gorilla Boss]] to create an ape army called G.A.S.P. (Gorillas and Apes Seizing Power) to take over the world. Gorilla Grodd captures an undercover Detective Chimp in their lair, and later captures Batman, revealing both a ploy to capture [[Gotham City]] and an obsession with Batman in the form of a utility belt, proclaiming he has had it for years, he just simply has not worn it. He and his gorilla army later invade Gotham and face off against B'wana Beast and Vixen, who his gorilla army captures and places in a zoo. They later recapture Batman and Detective Chimp when they return to Gotham and attempt to rescue Gotham, but was defeated when they use B'wana Beast's powers to both escape and to empower Batman with the form of a Bat-Griffin. He has a quick non-speaking appearance in "Requiem for a Scarlet Speedster". Batman and the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]] team up to take him down, indicating that Grodd was mainly an adversary for Flash before the latter's disappearance. Later, he appears in the last episode "Mitefall" to transform people into bananas and eat them. He is defeated by Batman and Aquaman.

[[File:Grodd (The Flash 2014 TV series).png|thumb|right|250px|Grodd in [[The CW]] television series ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'']]
* Gorilla Grodd appears on [[The CW]]'s ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', voiced by [[David Sobolov]] while the motion capture was provided by Simon Burnett (albeit uncredited). As seen in season one, he was a test subject for [[General Wade Eiling]]'s experiments in developing psychic abilities for interrogation, under [[S.T.A.R. Labs]]' supervision. But when Eiling tortures Grodd, [[Eobard Thawne]] (impersonating Harrison Wells) ends Grodd's experiments and planned to use the gorilla for his own ends. Five years later, Grodd was exposed to the energies from the particle accelerator explosion and escaped S.T.A.R. Labs; the pilot shows his cage being ripped open.<ref>''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' (2014) S01E01</ref> Taking refuge in Central City's sewers, Grodd's size increases and he develops psychic abilities in "Crazy for You", and Grodd has his chance for revenge in "Fallout" when the Reverse-Flash brings Eiling into the sewers for the gorilla to drag away. Grodd makes his official debut in "Grodd Lives". Thawne uses Grodd as a distraction against the S.T.A.R. Labs team, with the gorilla using Eiling to steal gold. During the robberies, the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]] experiences mental hallucinations caused by Grodd's telepathy. The team capture Eiling with Grodd speaking through his brainwashed captive to reveal himself. The team believes that finding Grodd could lead to Reverse-Flash. Flash, [[Joe West (The Flash)|Joe West]] and [[Vibe (comics)|Cisco Ramon]] go into the sewers and discover through writings on the walls that Grodd is evolving and becoming smarter. Grodd uses his powers to knock Flash out and kidnap Joe. He uses his powers to make Joe point a gun at himself, but doesn't fire it while showing how he dislikes guns and bananas. The team creates a headpiece to block out Grodd's mind attacks as Flash attempts a supersonic punch. Grodd, however, is able to block Flash's attack with his superior physical ability. When the headpiece becomes damaged, Grodd uses his mind powers on Flash again, but Flash is able to overcome it thanks to [[Iris West Allen|Iris West]]. Grodd leaps at Flash - who dodges the attack - and he gets hit by a train. At the end of the episode, Grodd is seen climbing a building, showing that he is alive and only getting stronger. Grodd reappears in season two. In "Gorilla Warfare", Grodd mind-controls scientists to steal various chemicals in the hopes of creating more gorillas with his level of intelligence. He later kidnaps [[Killer Frost|Caitlin Snow]] to help with his plan. The S.T.A.R. Labs team has [[Harrison Wells|Harry Wells]] (dressed as Reverse-Flash) trick Grodd into thinking that his "father" is still alive. The plan works long enough for Wells to rescue Caitlin. After Flash is fully recovered from an earlier fight against [[Hunter Zolomon|Zoom]], the S.T.A.R. Labs team lure Grodd to one of the dimensional breaches and send him to a [[Gorilla City|jungle sanctuary]] for gorillas that have been experimented on in [[Earth-Two|Earth-2]].
* Gorilla Grodd will appear in ''[[Justice League Action]]''.

====DC animated universe====
[[File:Gorilla Grodd (DC Animated Universe).jpg|thumb|Gorilla Grodd as seen in ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]''.]]
* Gorilla Grodd appears in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Powers Boothe]]. This version hates [[banana]]s and resents being offered them. Introduced in season one's "The Brave and the Bold", he is a fugitive from the secretive Gorilla City, a spurned would-be tyrant who vows vengeance on his fellow primates. Maintaining an e-mail relationship with scientist Dr. Sarah Corwin (voiced by [[Virginia Madsen]]), he comes to [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]] to cloak the metropolis in a similar shield as Gorilla City's. This provides him a hidden base from which to launch a nuclear assault against Gorilla City, while he controls Central City's populace with his mind-control helmet. The [[Wally West|Flash]], [[John Stewart (comics)|Green Lantern]] and Gorilla City's head of security [[Solovar]] rush to defeat Grodd himself while the [[Justice League]] stop the bombs. Grodd becomes incapacitated when he tries to use the mind-control helmet on Flash, not knowing that Flash had switched around various wires at high speed. Later in Gorilla City, Grodd is shown in a zoo-like prison cell, appearing as though he were brain damaged. As the League and Solovar depart from the area, the camera zooms in on Grodd's face in the episode's last few seconds as he comes to his senses and gets an angry look on his face. Grodd's return in season two's "Secret Society", showcasing a different side of the villain. No longer focused on Gorilla City, Grodd becomes an opponent to the Justice League as a whole. With his loyal follower [[Giganta]], he recruits for a [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]] manipulating each member; [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]]'s hatred for Superman, [[Shade (comics)|Shade]] being offered by Grodd to be a master criminal, [[Sinestro]]'s hatred for Green Lanterns, [[Killer Frost]]'s simple enjoyment of murder, and [[Clayface (Matt Hagen)|Clayface]] being promised by Grodd to find a way to be human again. This episode reveals that Grodd's accident with his mind-control helmet has given him mental powers, which he utilizes in this story as a subtle type of tampering with the League's emotions. Having watched the League via secret cameras for weeks, Grodd manipulates the League's feelings until his nemeses start lashing out at each other and end up walking away from the team. Having separated the nemeses, Grodd tries to capture each superhero and invades a football [[halftime show]] to try to do away with the superheroes publicly, but was foiled when [[Martian Manhunter|J'onn J'onzz]] frees the others. Grodd's allies battle the League one last time but fails to beat them, and Grodd is subsequently defeated by [[Superman]].
* Gorilla Grodd appears in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', voiced again by Powers Boothe. In the first season episode "Ultimen", Giganta teams up with [[Bizzaro]] in an attempt to break Grodd out of prison, but was defeated by [[Wonder Woman]] and [[Apache Chief|Long Shadow]]; Grodd does not actually appear in the episode. In the final season, Grodd turns up as the leader of an [[Legion of Doom (Super Friends)|expended Secret Society]], a sort of [[cooperative|co-op]] for supervillains with each free to act on their own, but able to call in help should they need it (for twenty-five percent of their spoils) against the expanded Justice League. After having the Secret Society seek out various valuable artifacts over the course of the season, Grodd reveals his master plan: to turn every human on the planet into an ape. The plan however is thwarted by the League. Unimpressed, [[Lex Luthor]] usurps Grodd's position as the Secret Society's new leader due to reclaiming his own god-like power when merged with [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]]. Luthor keeps Grodd prisoner in the Secret Society's headquarters in the hopes that he will reveal how to reconstitute Brainiac from the living supercomputer's last remaining fragment. When Lex attempts to probe Grodd's mind, bad fortune leads to Lex switching minds with the Flash due a psychic resonance between Grodd and Flash.
