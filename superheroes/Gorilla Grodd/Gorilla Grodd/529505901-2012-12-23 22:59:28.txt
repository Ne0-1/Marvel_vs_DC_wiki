==Fictional character biography==
Gorilla Grodd is a hyper-intelligent [[telepathy|telepathic]] [[gorilla]] with the power to [[mind control|control the minds]] of others. At one time, he was nothing more than an average ape, but after an alien spacecraft ([[retcon]]ned from a radioactive meteor, the same one that empowered [[Hector Hammond]]) crashes in his African home, Grodd and his [[wiktionary:troupe|troupe]] are imbued with super-intelligence by the ship's pilot. Grodd and fellow gorilla [[Solovar]] also develop telepathic and [[psychokinesis|telekinetic]] powers. Taking the alien as their leader, the gorillas construct a super advanced home named [[Gorilla City]]. The gorillas live in peace until their home is discovered by prying explorers. Grodd forces one of the explorers to kill the alien, and takes over Gorilla City, planning to conquer the world next. Solovar telepathically contacts [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] to warn him of the evil gorilla's plans, and Grodd is defeated. The villain manages to return again and again to plague the Flash and his allies.<ref name="dc-ency"/> Originally in his first Pre-Crisis appearance he first met the Flash while searching for Solovar, who had been imprisoned while on a trip to the human world. Grodd probed Solovar's mind to find the secret of mind control, so he could control Gorilla City and use the inhbitants to take over the World, but Solovar breaks out of his cage and tells the Flash, so the Flash defeats him and apparently knocks the power of mind control from his mind. But it is revealed he had not lost his power, he overcomes his guard and takes over an underground winged race by burrowing underground, trying to use a machine to take away the intelligence of the other Gorillas. But Flash finds out from Solovar where Grodd has escaped to and destroys the machine. The winged people are freed from his control and Grodd is imprisoned again. Grodd has four guards set to guard him, but summons a burrowing machine which he uses to escape. He transforms himself into a human, and starts a factory to create a pill that will give him vast mental powers. Grodd easily stops the Flash, but then unexpectedly turns into a Gorilla again, where his powers do not work as his brain is not evolved enough. He tries to get to the machine that turned him into a human, but Flash molds the metal into handcuffs for Grodd, then takes him back to Gorilla City. Grodd devises a means of transporting his mind to another body while his original one dies, and takes over a man in Central City, but is again arrested. Later he caused the first assembling of the Flash's Rogues Gallery, breaking them out of jail to distract the Flash after transferring his mind to that of 'Freddy', a Gorilla in a zoo. Thanks to Solovar the Flash found about Grodd's escape. Ironically Grodd, despite using radiations to stop the Flash moving at superspeed, is defeated by the Gorilla's mate when she hears him mention another Gorilla. He and Freddy are restored to their normal bodies.

In a confrontation with [[Wally West]], Grodd increases the brain power of most of the animals in [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]]. He hopes to endanger the lives of all the humans, but this plan backfires because some of the pets are too loyal to their humans. Grodd's plans are defeated by the Flash with the assistance of the [[Pied Piper (comics)|Pied Piper]], [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]], and [[Rex the Wonder Dog]].

At one point, the immortal villain [[Vandal Savage]] kidnaps Titans member [[Lilith (DC Comics)|Omen]] and uses her to form the perfect team of adversaries for the [[Teen Titans]]. Savage approaches Grodd, offering him membership in this new anti-Titans group, Tartarus. Savage sweetens the offer with promises of power and [[immortality]]. Grodd joins Tartarus on their mission to synthesize the immortal blood of the [[H.I.V.E.]] Mistress, Addie Kane. Savage seeks to create a serum that will grant immortality. Their schemes are thwarted when the Titans intervene, and Tartarus retreats. [[Garth (comics)|Tempest]] later leads a rescue mission to save Omen from Savage. During the rescue attempt, Tartarus battles the Titans, but collapses upon itself due to each member having a different agenda. This is because Omen had purposely chosen members who would not work well together. When [[Siren (DC Comics)|Siren]] switches alliances during the battle and aids Tempest in escaping, the Tartarus members go their separate ways and the group disbands.

He has made no fewer than eighteen attempts to eliminate all traces of humanity from the face of the Earth.

One of the attempts occurs in ''Son of Ambush Bug'' #5 (November 1986). Grodd had traveled to the Late Cretaceous "''to wipe out all traces of human evolution from the time stream''" (despite the fact that, at this point in time, the ancestors of humanity would be his own ancestors as well). His plans are apparently shattered by a combination of the sudden appearance of [[Titano]], and [[Ambush Bug]] waking from a nightmare. Whether or not Grodd's plan is a failure or not is disputable: Ambush Bug awakes to "Anchor-Ape Clark Kong".

In the final issue of ''[[Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew]]'', Grodd travels to Earth-C in an attempt to conquer it, but is defeated by the efforts of the Zoo Crew (plus [[Beast Boy|Changeling]] of the Teen Titans).<ref>''Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew'' #20, November 1983</ref>

In the 1991 ''[[Angel and the Ape]]'' limited series, Grodd is revealed as the grandfather of Angel's partner Sam Simeon.  This is conflict with ''[[Martian Manhunter]] Annual'' #2 (1999), which states that Sam Simeon is Grodd’s brother.

In the ''Justice League of America Wedding Special'', Gorilla Grodd is among the villains seen as members of the [[Injustice League#Injustice League Unlimited|Injustice League Unlimited]].

During the ''[[Final Night]]'', Grodd attempted to use a mystical talisman called the Heart of Darkness- normally effective only in eclipses- that brought out the 'inner beast' of humans, turning the population of the town of Leesburg into feral monsters, including [[Matrix (comics)|Supergirl]]. However, Supergirl was eventually able to fight off Grodd's influence thanks to some outside sources, allowing her to oppose Grodd until the sun was restored, Grodd being seemingly killed when an icicle fell into him.

One of Grodd’s widest-ranging schemes was to arrange [[Solovar]]'s assassination and manipulate Gorilla City into war against humanity, with the aid of a "shadow cabinet" of prominent gorillas called Simian Scarlet. In the course of this, Grodd absorbs too much neural energy from his fellow apes, leaving him with the intelligence of a normal gorilla.<ref>''[[Martian Manhunter]] Annual'' #2, 1999</ref> He has since recovered, and a failed attempt to set up a base in Florida leads to his capture and incarceration in [[Iron Heights]].

Grodd had been trapped inside the human body of an overweight street bum. He was attacked by a gang known as the Vultures. One of them commented on how their member Iggo had the strength of a gorilla, which reminded Grodd of his true form. Suddenly changing back to his original shape and size, he quickly defeated the gang, making them believe that they are burning in molten lava by using his force of mind power. Reading the minds of the crooks, he saw that one of the former members of their gang was a friend of the Flash, and a plan began to form in his mind.

Grodd found another space-rock, identical to the one that had given him his powers, and contacted Hector Hammond, a human who had also gained similar powers to him. Grodd was able to take control of Gorilla City after increasing his evolution, but was defeated once more.

Grodd is also seen in the ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' arc "Public Enemies" (''Superman/Batman'' #1&nbsp;– #7) controlling numerous villains and heroes in order to take down [[Superman]] and [[Batman]] for the prize of 1 billion dollars offered by then [[U.S. President]] [[Lex Luthor]]. Despite his use of foes such as [[Mongul]], [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]], [[Lady Shiva]], and [[Nightshade (comics)|Nightshade]], Superman and Batman are able to deduce the mind behind the attacks, and quickly dispose of Grodd.

He is responsible for crippling the Flash's friend Hunter Zolomon, resulting in his transformation into the villainous [[Zoom (comics)|Zoom]] when Hunter tries to change the event so it never happened. Hunter would often think about how Grodd used him as a plaything in that fight while talking it over with the Flash.<ref>''Flash'' vol. 2, #193 (February 2003)</ref>

In ''[[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]'' #23, Grodd makes a deal with [[Grimm (DC Comics)|Grimm]] to get [[Blockbuster (DC Comics)|Blockbuster]] an ape-heart.<ref>''Birds of Prey'' #23</ref>

In ''JLA Classified'' #1-3, DC, 3-issue story arc, 2004, Grodd and his forces attack the [[Ultramarine Corps]]. Grodd has most of the citizens they are protecting killed. He personally eats some of the humans. During the course of this incident, [[Squire (comics)#Beryl Hutchinson|Beryl]] informs the team that Grodd ranks number three on the latest "Global Most Wanted".

In ''[[Salvation Run]]'' #3, Grodd teams up with the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] to gather their own faction of the exiled supervillains. In #4, he kills [[Monsieur Mallah]] and [[Brain (comics)|The Brain]], only to be knocked off a cliff by the Joker. He is seen alive in the final issue, attempting to deliver payback to the Joker.

In ''Justice League of America'' #21, Grodd is shown among the members of [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]]'s new [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]] and placed in the Inner Circle. In ''[[Final Crisis]]'' #4, Gorilla Grodd was among the high-ranked superheroes and supervillains that were turned into [[Justifiers]]. In ''Final Crisis: Resist'', he is sent to apprehend [[Snapper Carr]] and Cheetah, but fails.

In the new continuity of ''[[The New 52]]'', the Flash (Barry Allen) first encounters Gorilla Grodd after a trip through the Speed Force which strands him in Gorilla City. <ref>''The Flash'' #8</ref> The Flash is hailed as a messenger spoken of in gorilla prophecy by all but Grodd, the newly crowned gorilla king. The Flash foils Grodd's attempts to kill him until Grodd causes a building to collapse upon himself, knocking him unconscious and allowing the Flash to escape.<ref>''The Flash'' #9</ref> <ref>''The Flash'' #10</ref> However Grodd returns and attacks Central City with a army of gorilla soldiers.<ref>''Flash Annual (Volume 4)'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Grodd's psionic abilities allow him to place other beings under his mental control. Grodd can also project telekinetic force beams, telekinetically transmute matter, and transfer his consciousness into other bodies. In recent issues he has shown the ability to absorb intelligence through the consumption of human brains. He possesses great superhuman strength far exceeding that of an ordinary gorilla. He is a scientific genius who has mastered Gorilla City's advanced technology and who has created many incredible inventions of his own. He also uses big laser guns.<ref name="dc-ency"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dccomics.com/dcu/heroes_and_villains/?hv=origin_stories/gorilla_grodd&p=2 |title=DCU &#124; Heroes and Villains |publisher=Dccomics.com |date=2010-04-21 |accessdate=2011-01-16}}</ref> However, his thought process still operates at a relatively human rate of speed; the Flashes have shown some degree of immunity to his telepathic illusions by moving so fast that their thoughts process Grodd's illusions in slow motion. In one story, he gains vast telekinetic powers from a pill he develops after evolving himself into a human, enabling him to control the forces of nature such as lifting thousands of tons mentally. But after he turns back he loses this power, as his brain is not evolved enough. He was able to engage Kalibak in hand-to-hand combat but was visibly not quite as strong as Kalibak.

==Other versions==
===Antimatter Universe===
Gorilla Grodd has a counterpart on the post-Crisis antimatter universe's Earth called General Grodd who is a member of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains#Justice Underground|Justice Underground]]. He is a freedom fighter from a militaristic ape nation.<ref>''JLA Secret Files 2004''</ref>

===Flashpoint===
In the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' timeline, Gorilla Grodd has succeeded in overthrowing Solovar and taken over Gorilla City. Gorilla Grodd began a campaign to control all of Africa. Despite his conquest to be a great success, Gorilla Grodd feels unfulfilled since none of his enemies have been able to prove a challenge to him and the war between Aquaman and Wonder Woman has over shadowed his actions constantly frustrating him. He soon began to feel bored by his accomplishments since they prove far too easy for him and often lets his enemies live hoping for them to become greater challenges in the future. He also decided to begin a campaign to control Europe, knowing perfectly well that this action will put him in under the Atlanteans and Amazons target.<ref>''Flashpoint: Grodd of War'' one-shot (June 2011)</ref> Gorilla Grodd arrives at the scene to attack in the Atlantean/Amazon war.<ref>''Flashpoint'' #5 (August 2011)</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
* On the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] animated series ''[[Challenge of the Super Friends]]'', Gorilla Grodd (voiced by [[Stanley Ralph Ross]]) is one of two Flash villains (along with [[Captain Cold]]) that appear as members of [[Lex Luthor]]'s [[Legion of Doom (comics)|Legion of Doom]]. It should be noted that this version of Grodd, though highly intelligent, never displays telepathic abilities. In ''The Time Trap,'' Grodd creates a method of time-travel, which the Legion of Doom apparently uses other times. In "Revenge on Gorilla City," Grodd hatches a plot to take control of Gorilla City and use its citizens to conquer the world.

* Gorilla Grodd later appeared in the ''[[Super Friends (1980)|''Super Friends]]'' short episodes "Two Gleeks Are Deadlier Than One" and "Revenge of Doom" again voiced by [[Stanley Ralph Ross]]. In "Two Gleeks are Deadlier Than One," he and Giganta capture Gleek and replace him with a robot duplicate in order to infiltrate the Super Friends and learn what they are planning. In "Revenge of Doom," Gorilla Grodd was seen with the Legion of Doom when they got back together.

* Gorilla Grodd was mentioned in passing by the character Nightshade in the episode titled "Deadly Nightshade" of the live action [[The Flash (TV series)|''Flash'' TV series]] from the early 1990s. He was a crime boss in the 1950s, who worked out of Central City's Helltown, and adversary of Nightshade. Also in the last episode the chief of police in Central City whose hatred of Flash is ironic because he wears of costume of a gorilla, it could speculate to be a reference to Gorilla Grodd.

[[Image:Cartoon grodd.jpg|thumb|Gorilla Grodd as seen in ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]''.]]
* Gorilla Grodd appears in ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' voiced by [[Powers Boothe]]. In his first appearance, the two-part episode "The Brave and the Bold", Grodd is a fugitive from the secretive Gorilla City, a spurned would-be tyrant who vows vengeance on his fellow primates. Maintaining an e-mail relationship with [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]] scientist Dr. Sarah Corwin, he comes to Central City to cloak the metropolis in a similar shield as Gorilla City's. This provides him a hidden base from which to launch a nuclear assault against Gorilla City, while he controls the populace of Central City with his mind-control helmet. While the League hurries to stop the bombs, Flash, [[John Stewart (comics)|Green Lantern]], and [[Solovar]] (re-imagined as the head of Gorilla City Security rather than its ruler) rush to defeat Grodd himself. Grodd becomes incapacitated when he tries to use the mind-control helmet on Flash, not knowing that Flash had switched around various wires at high speed. Later in Gorilla City, Grodd is shown in a zoo-like prison cell, appearing as though he were brain damaged. As the League and Solovar depart from the area in the last few seconds of the episode, the camera zooms in on Grodd's face as he comes to his senses and gets an angry look on his face.<br>Grodd's return in "Secret Society" showcases a different side of the villain. No longer focused on Gorilla City, Grodd becomes an opponent to the League as a whole. With his loyal follower [[Giganta]], he recruits [[Killer Frost]] (who wants to kill people), [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]] (who hated Superman), [[Shade (comics)|Shade]] (who Grodd offered to become a master criminal), [[Sinestro]] (who had a hatred for all Green Lanterns), and [[Clayface (Matt Hagen)|Clayface]] (who Grodd promised to help find a way to restore Clayface back to Matt Hagen) to make a sort of anti-League dubbed the "[[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]]". Revealed in this episode is that Grodd's accident with his mind-control helmet has given him mental powers, which he utilizes in this story as a subtle type of tampering with the League's emotions. Having watched the League via secret cameras for weeks, Grodd manipulates their feelings until the Leaguers start lashing out at each other and end up walking away from the team. Having separated them, Grodd tries to capture each Leaguer and invades a football halftime show to do away with the heroes publicly, only to be foiled by [[Martian Manhunter|J'onn J'onzz]], who frees his teammates after impersonating Clayface. The Society battles the League one last time, but fail to beat them and subsequently, Grodd is defeated by [[Superman]].

* In the first season ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "Ultimen", Giganta teams up with [[Bizzaro]] in an attempt to break Grodd out of prison&nbsp;– only to be defeated by Wonder Woman and Long Shadow, a member of the [[Ultimen]] (Grodd does not actually appear in the episode, however). In the second season, Grodd (voiced again by Powers Boothe) turns up as the leader of an expanded Secret Society (based more on the [[Legion of Doom (Super Friends)|Legion of Doom]]). As he describes it, the new Secret Society is a sort of [[cooperative|co-op]] for supervillains&nbsp;– each free to act on their own, but (for twenty-five percent of their spoils) able to call in help should they need it against the expanded League.<br>After having the Secret Society seek out various valuable artifacts over the course of the season, Grodd reveals his master plan: to turn every human on the planet into an ape. The plan, however, is thwarted by the Justice League, and an unimpressed [[Lex Luthor]] usurps Grodd's position as the new leader of the Secret Society. Obsessed with reclaiming the godlike power he briefly tasted when merged with the now-destroyed [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]], Luthor keeps Grodd prisoner in the Secret Society's headquarters in the hopes that he will reveal how to reconstitute the living supercomputer from the last remaining fragment.<br>When he attempts to probe Grodd's mind, bad fortune leads to Lex switching minds with the Flash, who has a psychic resonance to Grodd's mind due to once being under his control. With the discovery that Brainiac had a base in deep space that was subsequently destroyed (see "Twilight"), Luthor has the Secret Society refit the headquarters for space travel, promising them a place of leadership in the new order with himself as absolute ruler. Because of Luthor's heavy-handed leadership and romantic disinterest, the spurned [[Tala (comics)|Tala]] eventually releases Grodd, who then arranges a mutiny with many other villains. Grodd and Luthor eventually finally find themselves alone together, and engage in fisticuffs. Grodd attempts to use his mind-control ability on him. However, Luthor had anticipated this and turned Grodd's power back on him, giving Luthor control of Grodd. Luthor forces him to step into an airlock after first humiliating him. Grodd is released from Luthor's mental grip and then shot into space, all the while screaming threats of revenge. It is likely that he died in the vacuum of space.

* Gorilla Grodd first appears in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "Terror on Dinosaur Island!" voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]. He and his ape followers plotted to devolve the human race with an E-Ray from their headquarters on Dinosaur Island. They ran into conflicts with [[Batman]] and [[Plastic Man]]. With Batman devolved to an ape, Plastic Man helps the Ape-Batman fight Gorilla Grodd and his servants. When the E-Ray is activated, it evolved the humans (Batman put the E-Ray on reverse when Gorilla Grodd was not looking) back to their natural state. It even evolved Gorilla Grodd to a human who ended up incarcerated at Iron Heights in the end planning his revenge. He was later shown in "Day of the Dark Knight" escaping Iron Heights (still in human form) and attempting to attack Batman, but stopped by [[Green Arrow]]. Gorilla Grodd has a heroic counterpart in a parallel universe in "Deep Cover for Batman!". This version resembles Solovar. Batman almost punches the counterpart but stops short and explains "You look like someone I know." The original Grodd (now a gorilla again) joins [[Owlman (comics)|Owlman]] and other villains in "Game Over for Owlman!". Grodd and the [[Question (comics)|Question]] are caught by [[Libra (DC Comics)|Equinox]] in the teaser for "Mystery in Space". Batman rescues Question, but leaves Grodd hanging by the flames. He also makes a small appearance in "Legends of the Dark-Mite". He is summoned by [[Bat-Mite]] to prove Batman's mettle in combat, but apparently was reading. He is quickly replaced by [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]]. Later, when the Bat-Mite decides to assume the role of Batman himself, Batman talks the Mite through an encounter with Grodd (who is disposed of by slipping on a banana peel, a play off of JLU Grodd's oft-noted distaste for the fruit). Grodd is Batman's primary opponent once more in the episode "Last Bat on Earth" in which he travels to a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] future. There, he takes command of an army of intelligent apes and uses superior technology to defeat their opponents, a city of similarly-evolved tigers. Batman pursues Grodd to this time, where he enlists [[Kamandi]]'s help in defeating Grodd. At the end, Grodd is trampled by his retreating forces, and is taken back to the present in handcuffs with Batman. Grodd later appears in the episode "Mayhem of the Music Meister" attempting to steal new communications satellite alongside [[Clock King]] and [[Black Manta]]. They are confronted by Green Arrow, [[Aquaman]], and [[Black Canary]], but are forced to sing and dance due to the [[Music Meister]]'s harmonious hypnotics. They are later saved and defeated once freed from the Music Meister's control, and are sent to Arkham Asylum, where they later participate in the Drives Us Bats song, where it is revealed that he has a tire swing in his cell. Grodd appears briefly in the episode "Sidekicks Assemble" as a holographic opponent for [[Dick Grayson|Robin]], [[Roy Harper (comics)|Speedy]] and [[Garth (comics)|Aqualad]] to fight. Grodd returns as the primary adversary of Batman, [[Detective Chimp]], [[B'wana Beast]], and [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]] in the episode "Gorillas in Our Midst", forming an alliance with [[Monsieur Mallah]] and [[Gorilla Boss]] to create an ape army called G.A.S.P (short for Gorillas and Apes Seizing Power) to take over the world. Gorilla Grodd captures an undercover Detective Chimp in their lair, and later captures a rescuing Batman, revealing both a ploy to capture Gotham City and an obsession with Batman in the form of a utility belt, proclaiming he has had it for years, he just simply has not worn it. He and his gorilla army later invade Gotham and face off against B'wana Beast and Vixen, who his gorilla army captures and places in a zoo. They later recapture an escaped Batman and Detective Chimp when they return to Gotham City and attempt to rescue it, only to be defeated when they use B'wana Beast's powers to both escape, and to empower Batman with the form of a Bat-Griffin. He has a quick non-speaking appearance in "Requiem for a Scarlet Speedster". Batman and the Flash (Barry Allen) team up to take him down, indicating that Grodd was mainly an adversary for the Flash before the latter's disappearance. Later, he appears in the last episode "Mitefall", to transform people into bananas and eat them. He gets beaten by Batman and Aquaman.
