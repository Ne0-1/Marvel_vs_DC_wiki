'''Spider-Ham''' ('''Peter Porker''') is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is an [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[funny animal]] [[parody]] of [[Spider-Man]], and was created by [[Tom DeFalco]] and Mark Armstrong.

He first appeared in the one-shot humor [[comic book]] ''Marvel Tails Starring Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham'' (November [[1983 in comics|1983]]), which was then followed by an ongoing bi-monthly series, ''Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham'', under Marvel's [[Star Comics]] imprint. The character existed on Earth-8311, which was a universe populated by [[Anthropomorphic animal|anthropomorphic]] versions of the Marvel superheroes.<ref name="Time">{{cite news|title= Top 10 Oddest Marvel Characters|work= Time|date=2009-09-03|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2009/09/02/top-10-oddest-marvel-characters/slide/spider-ham/|accessdate=2010-03-04}}</ref> Spider-Ham made his feature film debut in ''[[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]]'' (2018), voiced by [[John Mulaney]].

==Fictional character biography==
Peter Porker was born a spider (simply named Peter). He resided in the basement lab of May Porker, a slightly goofy animal scientist who had created "the world's first atomic powered hairdryer", hoping that "the introduction of nuclear fusion into America's beauty salons" would "revolutionize the hair care industry".<ref name="Time"/> After dousing her head with water and activating the dryer, May Porker accidentally irradiated herself, and in a fit of delusion, bit Peter, who then found himself transformed into an anthropomorphic swine much like May Porker herself. Running from the Porker homestead disoriented, Peter soon came to realize that he still retained a spider's abilities:

<blockquote>''"This is astounding! Am I a spider with the limitations of a pig? Or a pig with the proportionate strength and agility of a spider? I've become something greater than either spider or pig... I've become a '''Spider-Ham!'''"'' - ''Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham'' #15 (May 1987)</blockquote>

After this startling series of events, Peter (who adopted the surname "Porker", that of his benefactor May Porker, who after the accident mentally attuned to a state in which she believed she was Peter's loving aunt) dedicated himself and his new-found abilities to fighting injustice and the occasional animal parody of established Marvel Comics villains. May Porker's scientific genius was transferred to Peter, giving him the know-how to devise his webspinner gauntlets to replace his lost natural ability. 

===Misadventures===
Porker, in his spider-themed alter-ego's first adventure teamed up with Captain Americat, as they attempted to foil the nefarious plot of "The Marauder", in a series of events that led to the creation of the Hulk-Bunny (''Marvel Tails'' #1, "If He Should Punch Me").

Several months later, Spider-Ham encountered his main nemesis and one of his only re-occurring enemies in the form of Ducktor Doom, a duck parody of Doctor Doom (''Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham'' #1, "The Mysterious Island of Ducktor Doom"). Spider-Ham would meet again with Doom when Porker would foil the would-be world conqueror's plot to create an army of living super vegetables (''Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham'' #6, "Salad Daze").

Other notable menaces Porker would face along the way include the Bull-Frog (a parody of the Marvel villain [[Man-Bull]]), the Buzzard (an opossum take on the Spider-Man adversary the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]]), Hogzilla (a swine counterpart to the more popular [[Godzilla]]), and the King-Pig (seemingly the swine equivalent of Marvel's mob-boss the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]).

Three characters, not parallels to anybody in the Spider-Man series, also begin in #1: J. Jeremiah Jackal, Jr. (J. Jonah Jackal's nephew), Bunson Bunny and Upton Adam Stray (a cat with shades), all junior trainees at the Daily Beagle. They acquire super-powers in #15, encouraging Spider-Ham in his already made decision to abandon his super-hero career, but they fumble their first mission, forcing Peter Porker to resume his alter-ego as Spider-Ham. Further misadventures of the Beagle Brigadeers were presented within the back-up stories in ''Marvel Tales''.

The series also included back-up stories featuring such characters as Deerdevil ([[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]), Goose Rider ([[Ghost Rider]]) and the Fantastic Fur (the [[Fantastic Four]]).

===Marvel Zombies===
When Spider-Ham accidentally travels to the ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'' universe, he is suddenly zombified by a group of zombies, namely [[Captain America]], [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]. It appears that he is directly shot in the head by an energy bullet by [[Ultron|Earth 616's Ultron]], effectively killing him but, in a zombie state, Spider-Ham turned into Ham-ibal Lecter. {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Spider-Verse===
During the ''[[Spider-Verse]]'' storyline which featured Spider-Men from various alternate realities, Spider-Ham became a member of the Spider-Army fighting against the Inheritors. He played a crucial role in the final confrontation when he switches places with Benjy Parker (the baby brother of [[Spider-Girl]] of [[Marvel Comics 2|Earth-982]]) - one of the three sacrifices needed for the Inheritors to destroy the Spider-Totems - allowing [[Uncle Ben#Spider-Verse|Ben Parker]] to get Benjy to safety.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #14</ref>

===''Secret Wars''===
During the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' event when all universes were destroyed and their remains formed a single planet called Battleworld, Spider-Ham found himself the only pig in the domain of the [[Battleworld]] called Arachnia and ended up as the captive of its [[Mayor]], [[Norman Osborn]]. He was rescued by [[Spider-Gwen]],<ref>''Secret Wars: Spider-Verse'' #1 (May 2015)</ref> and the two eventually discovered and teamed up with other spider-powered people ([[Spider-Man Noir]], [[Spider-Man: India]], [[Captain Britain Corps|Spider-UK]] and [[Anya Corazon]]), neither of whom remembered their previous encounter during the original ''Spider-Verse''.<ref>''Spider-Verse'' vol. 2 #2 (Jun. 2015)</ref>

===''Web Warriors''===
Following the conclusion of ''Secret Wars'' the team of six Spiders that formed during the event will rename itself and feature in a new ongoing series called ''Web Warriors'', a name that was coined by Peter Parker from the [[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|''Ultimate Spider-Man'' TV series]] during the original ''Spider-Verse''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2015/06/29/spider-gwen-stars-in-web-warriors-launched-by-mike-costa-and-david-baldeon-marveloctober/|title=Spider-Gwen Stars In Web Warriors Launched By Mike Costa And David Baldeon #MarvelOctober (UPDATE)|website=www.bleedingcool.com|accessdate=22 December 2018}}</ref>

Spider-Ham was first featured as star of the 1983 humorous one-shot ''Marvel Tails'', with a backup cast of other anthropomorphic funny-animal parodies of popular Marvel Comics characters, such as Captain AmeriCat (a cat version of [[Captain America]]), Hulk-Bunny (a rabbit version of [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]) and Goose Rider (a goose version of [[Ghost Rider]]).

Two years later, a solo series, titled ''Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham'' debuted under Marvel's Star Comics imprint. The series, published bi-monthly, lasted seventeen issues before its cancellation in 1987. With the cancellation of ''Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham'', the character became a backup feature in ''Marvel Tales'', a monthly reprint series showcasing Spider-Man's past adventures. Beginning with issue #201 ([[cover date]]d July 1987), these new Spider-Ham stories appeared in issues #201-212, 214-219, 223-230, 233, 236, 237, 239, 240, and 247 before ceasing altogether.

In issue #3 of ''[[What The--?!]]'' (cover dated October 1988), Porker meets with Raven the Hunter (a parody of Spider-Man's nemesis [[Kraven the Hunter]]) in a story that satirized the popular "[[Kraven's Last Hunt]]" storyline which had been featured a year earlier in Marvel's Spider-Man titles. Spider-Ham also makes appearances in issues #18, 20, 22, and 24 of ''What The--?!'' The 26th issue of ''What The--?!'' (cover dated fall 1993) features "Spider-Ham 15.88", a humorous take-off on Peter Parker's future counterpart, Miguel O'Hara a.k.a. ''[[Spider-Man 2099]]''. The "15.88" is not seen as a year, but rather a humorous take on the price of a ham (the cover states that it was marked down from the original price of $20.99).

[[Image:Spiderham12.PNG|left|Cover to ''Peter Porker, The Spectacular Spider-Ham'' #12, by Joe Albelo.|thumb]]

Spider-Ham has also appeared on the cover ''[[Wha...Huh?]]'' #1, and was referred to as a fictional character in the [[Earth-616]] Marvel Universe, in ''[[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]]'' #52.

''Spider-Man Family'' #1 (2005 one-shot) features a sixteen-page ''[[Spider-Girl]]'' story, in which May Parker ([[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]]'s daughter) watches a [[DVD]] showing a small portion of a fictional Spider-Ham animated series, discovering that it was created by one of Spider-Man's enemies, [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]]. Here, Spider-Ham appears to mostly be a parody of [[Batman]]. Also in the issue, there is a partial reprint of ''Marvel Tails'' #1.

Spider-Ham was selected by fans and retailers to be the focus of the final variant cover by Mike Wieringo to the ''[[Spider-Man: The Other]]'' crossover, ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #528.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20081211063549/http://www.newsarama.com/forums/showthread.php?threadid=53776</ref>

In January 2007, [[J. Michael Straczynski]] authored the ''[[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate]] [[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]] Spider-Ham'' [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]], featuring Spider-Ham's attempt to find his missing "thought balloons" against a Civil War parody. The story does not fit in with previously established Spider-Ham continuity.

Tom Defalco returned to Spider-Ham's world in 2009, in the pages of ''Amazing Spider-Man Family'' #4-5. He introduces Swiney-Girl, the daughter of Spider-Ham and counterpart of Defalco's other creation [[Spider-Girl]]. Once again, the story strays away from the established, albeit loose, continuity of the original Spider-Ham stories by altering the character's origin and supporting characters, most notably in establishing Peter Porker as a natural-born pig bitten by a radioactive spider (directly mirroring Spider-Man's origin) and altering his love interest (a counterpart of [[Mary Jane Watson]]) from a [[water buffalo]] to a [[crane (bird)|crane]].

He fights alongside the ''X-Babies'' in issue #4 (March 2010) of their four-issue miniseries from 2009-2010.

To mark the anniversary of ''Peter Porker, The Spectacular Spider-Ham'' #1, Marvel released the ''Spider-Ham 25th Anniversary Special'' in July 2010, with Tom Defalco writing both Spider-Ham and Swiney-Girl stories. These stories feature most of Spider-Ham's original cast and origin, but incorporates the Mary Crane Watsow character from ''Amazing Spider-Man Family'' rather than her original counterpart.

==Other characters==
Earth-8311 featured anthropomorphic parodies of a variety of other Marvel characters.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Spider-Ham is alluded to in the cartoon series ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicsalliance.com/2011/07/24/marvel-television-animation-comic-con/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402061057/http://www.comicsalliance.com/2011/07/24/marvel-television-animation-comic-con/ |archivedate=2012-04-02 |df= }}</ref> In "Flight of the Iron Spider", [[Iron Man]] shows Spider-Man a machine that could scatter any physical object's particles inside across parallel universes. Spider-Man briefly envisions himself being turned into Spider-Ham as a result. In "Run Pig Run", [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] (disguised as a [[hot dog]] [[vendor]]) gives Spider-Man an enchanted hot dog that turns him into Spider-Ham as payback. Just then, Asgard's finest hunters led by [[Executioner (comics)|Executioner]] arrive and chase after Spider-Ham as part of Asgardsreia. [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] comes to Spider-Ham's aid and guesses that Loki had done this to him. While running, Thor tells Spider-Ham that he must keep him alive until the hunt ends at sundown. Thor throws Spider-Ham and his hammer towards Midtown High School. Thor brings Spider-Ham to [[Phil Coulson]], [[Luke Cage|Power Man]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], [[White Tiger (Ava Ayala)|White Tiger]] and [[Nova (Sam Alexander)|Nova]] just as Executioner and the other hunters arrive. Spider-Ham even tries to reason with Executioner that he's not a real pig. [[Phil Coulson]] arrives where he and Thor hold off the hunters while the others get Spider-Ham out of there. While on the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier, [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]] helps to protect Spider-Ham when the wolves that the hunters ride on sprout wings and attack the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier. While Thor, Coulson, and Spider-Ham's team fight Executioner and the hunters, Spider-Ham ends up calling out Loki and fights him. Not wanting his friends to sacrifice themselves for him, Spider-Ham fights Executioner. Before Executioner can land the killing blow on Spider-Ham, the sun sets ending the hunt. Spider-Ham changes back to Spider-Man and punches Loki.
:* The actual Spider-Ham appears in the "Spider-Verse" episodes voiced by [[Benjamin Diskin]]. An alternate version of Spider-Man, Peter Porker got his powers from a spider that fell into [[Aunt May]]'s pancake batter that transferred the vitamins and powers to him, becoming Spider-Ham. He uses his powers for good and even joins with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], but decides to quit after [[J. Jonah Jameson|J. Jonah Jackal]] turns the public against him. In the episode "Spider-Verse" Pt. 2, he encounters [[Spider-Man]] (whom he mistook for a monkey) while relaxing by his mud pool. With encouragement from Spider-Man, he decides to become Spider-Ham once again and helps fight the [[Norman Osborn|Green Goblin]]. Although the Goblin still manages to get DNA from his chin, Spider-Ham is offered by Iron Mouse a spot on the Avengers team again which he accepts. In the episode "Spider-Verse" Pt. 4, Spider-Ham appears along [[Spider-Man 2099]], [[Spider-Girl]], [[Spider-Man Noir]], Spyder-Knight, and [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Miles Morales]] to help Spider-Man defeat the Spider-Goblin and [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]]. In the episode "Return to the Spider-Verse" Pt. 1, Spider-Ham ends up in Peter Parker's living room alongside Spyder-Knight and Miles Morales' mother Rio due to the effects of the shattered Siege Perilous.

===Film===

This version follows similar funny animal cartoon behavior as the ''[[Looney Tunes]]'', complete with giant mallet and falling anvil gags as the character bears a resemblance to [[Porky Pig]]. His origin remains the same and he seems to be aware of the fact that talking animals are not a normal thing in other universes. He uses his unique skill set to take down [[Scorpion (Marvel Comics)|Scorpion]] alongside Spider-Man Noir and Peni Parker. Before returning home to his own dimension he leaves his cartoon mallet with Miles as a keepsake.
