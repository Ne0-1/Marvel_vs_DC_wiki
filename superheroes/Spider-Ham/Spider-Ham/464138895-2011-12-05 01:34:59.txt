'''Spider-Ham''' ('''Peter Porker''') is a [[fictional character]], an [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[funny animal]] [[parody]] of [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Spider-Man]], created by [[Tom DeFalco]] and [[Mark Armstrong (comic creator)|Mark Armstrong]].

He first appeared in the one-shot humor [[comic book]] ''Marvel Tails Starring Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham'' #1, which was then followed by an ongoing bi-monthly series, ''Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham''. The series lasted 17 issues, all of which were published under Marvel's [[Star Comics]] imprint.<ref>{{cite news|title= Top 10 Oddest Marvel Characters|work= Time|date=2009-09-03|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1919715_1919722_1919728,00.html|accessdate=2010-03-04}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Peter Porker was born a spider (simply named Peter). He resided in the basement lab of May Porker, a slightly goofy animal scientist who had created "the world's first atomic powered hairdryer," hoping that "the introduction of nuclear fusion into America's beauty salons" would "revolutionize the hair care industry". After dousing her head with water and activating the dryer, May Porker accidentally irradiated herself, and in a fit of delusion, bit Peter, who then found himself transformed into an anthropomorphic swine much like May Porker herself. Running from the Porker homestead disoriented, Peter soon came to realize that he still retained a spider's abilities:

<blockquote>''"This is astounding! Am I a spider with the limitations of a pig? Or a pig with the proportionate strength and agility of a spider? I've become something greater than either spider or pig... I've become a '''Spider-Ham!'''"'' - Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham #15 (May 1987)</blockquote>

After this startling series of events, Peter (who adopted the surname "Porker", that of his benefactor May Porker, who after the accident mentally attuned to a state in which she believed she was Peter's loving aunt) dedicated himself and his new-found abilities to fighting injustice and the occasional animal parody of established Marvel Comics villains.

===Misadventures===
Porker, in his spider-themed alter-ego's first adventure teamed up with [[Captain America]]t, as they attempted to foil the nefarious plot of "The Marauder", in a series of events that led to the creation of the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]-Bunny (''Marvel Tails'' #1, "If He Should Punch Me").

Several months later, Spider-Ham encountered his main nemesis and one of his only re-occurring enemies in the form of Ducktor Doom, a duck parody of Doctor Doom (''Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham'' #1, "The Mysterious Island of Ducktor Doom"). Spider-Ham would meet again with Doom when Porker would foil the would-be world conqueror's plot to create an army of living super vegetables (''Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham'' #6, "Salad Daze").

Other notable menaces Porker would face along the way include The Bull-Frog (a parody of the Marvel villain [[Man-Bull]]), the Buzzard (an opossum take on the Spider-Man adversary The [[Vulture (comics)|Vulture]]), Hogzilla (a swine counterpart to the more popular [[Godzilla]]), and The King-Pig (seemingly the swine equivalent of Marvel's mob-boss The [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]).

The series also included back up strips featuring such characters as Deerdevil ([[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]), Goose Rider ([[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]]) and the Fantastic Fur (the [[Fantastic Four]]). Some of these back-ups were contradictory, presenting different anthropomorphic versions of characters in different stories, such as two [[Namor]] counterparts: the Sub-Merchandiser (a dog) and the Sub-Marsupial (possibly a wombat). (Note: the Asinine Torch (a donkey) that appeared in a story with the Sub-Marsupial and the Fantastic Fur's Simian Torch are not two variants of the Fantastic Four's [[Human Torch]]; since he was depicted as elderly in the 1980s, and referred to as an "old sparring partner" of the Sub-Marsupial's, he was obviously a counterpart to the [[Human Torch (android)|golden age Human Torch]].)

==Post-cancellation==
After the cancellation of his solo series, ''Marvel Tales'', a monthly reprint series which specialized in reprints of Spider-Man's past adventures began carrying Porker as a back-up feature in 1987, beginning with issue #201 ([[cover date]]d July 1987).

These adventures appeared sporadically, in issues #201-212, 214-219, 223-230, 233, 236, 237, 239, 240, and 247

Amongst other characters, the ''Marvel Tales'' stories introduced Frank Carple, the Punfisher (a parody of the [[Punisher]]).

Another notable appearance of the character was in the Marvel humor anthology title, ''[[What The--?!]]''  In issue #3 of that title (cover dated October 1988), Porker met with Raven the Hunter (a parody of Spider-Man's nemesis [[Kraven the Hunter]]) in a story that satirized the popular "Kraven's Last Hunt" storyline which had been featured a year earlier in Marvel's Spider-Man titles. Spider-Ham also makes appearances in issues #18, 20, 22, and 24 of ''What The--?!''
[[Image:Spiderham12.PNG|left|Cover to ''Peter Porker, The Spectacular Spider-Ham'' #12, by Joe Albelo.|thumb]]
Even Marvel's once-popular [[Marvel 2099|''2099'']] line of titles wasn't safe, as seen in the 26th issue of ''What The--?!'' (cover dated Fall 1993), which featured "Spider-Ham 15.88", a humorous take-off on Peter Parker's future counterpart, Miguel O'Hara a.k.a. ''[[Spider-Man 2099]]''. The "15.88" is not seen as a year, but rather a humorous take on the price of a ham.

Spider-Ham has also appeared on the cover ''[[Wha...Huh?]]'' #1, and was referred to, as a fictional character in the [[Earth-616]] Marvel Universe, in ''[[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]]'' #52.

''Spider-Man Family'' #1 (2005 one-shot) featured a sixteen-page ''[[Spider-Girl]]'' story, in which May Parker ([[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]]'s daughter) watches a [[DVD]] showing a small portion of a fictional Spider-Ham animated series, discovering that it was created by one of Spider-Man's enemies, [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]]. Here, Spider-Ham appears to mostly be a parody of [[Batman]]. Also in the issue, there is a partial reprint of ''Marvel Tails'' #1.

Spider-Ham was selected by fans and retailers to be the focus of the final variant cover by Mike Wieringo to the ''[[Spider-Man: The Other]]'' crossover, ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #528. [http://www.newsarama.com/forums/showthread.php?threadid=53776]

In January 2007, [[J. Michael Straczynski]] authored the ''[[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate]] [[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]] Spider-Ham'' [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]], featuring Spider-Ham's attempt to find his missing "thought balloons" against a Civil War parody. The story does not fit in with previously established Spider-Ham "continuity."

Tom Defalco returned to Spider-Ham's world in the pages of ''Amazing Spider-Man Family'' #4-5. He even introduces Swiney-Girl the daughter of Spider-Ham, and counterpart of Defalco's other creation [[Spider-Girl]]. Once again, the story strays away from the established, albeit loose, continuity of the original Spider-Ham stories by altering the character's origin and supporting characters, most notably in establishing Peter Porker as a natural-born pig bitten by a radioactive spider (directly mirroring Spider-Man's origin) and altering his love interest (a counterpart of [[Mary Jane Watson]]) from a [[water buffalo]] to a [[crane (bird)|crane]].

He also has fought along side the ''X-Babies'' in issue #4 (March 2010) of their 4 issues mini-series from 2009-2010.

To mark the anniversary of ''Peter Porker, The Spectacular Spider-Ham'' #1, Marvel released the ''Spider-Ham 25th Anniversary Special'' in July 2010, with Tom Defalco writing both Spider-Ham and Swiney-Girl stories.  These stories feature most of Spider-Ham's original cast and origin, but incorporates the Mary Crane Watsow character from ''Amazing Spider-Man Family'' rather than her original counterpart.

==Other characters==
Earth-8311 featured anthropomorphic parodies of a variety of other Marvel characters.
