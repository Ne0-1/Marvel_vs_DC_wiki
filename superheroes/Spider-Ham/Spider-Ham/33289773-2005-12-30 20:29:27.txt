|}} '''Spider-Ham''' (Peter Porker) is a [[fictional character]], an [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] funny animal [[parody]] of [[Marvel Comics]]' popular [[Spider-Man]] character, created by [[Tom DeFalco]] and [[Mark Armstrong]].

He first appeared in the one-shot humor [[comic book]] ''Marvel Tails Starring Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham'' #1, which was then followed by an ongoing bi-monthly series, ''Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham''. The series lasted 17 issues, all of which were published under Marvel's [[Star Comics]] imprint.

==Character biography==

Peter Porker was born a spider (simply named Peter).  Residing in the basement lab of May Porker, a slightly goofy animal scientist who had created "the world's first atomic powered hairdryer," hoping that "the introduction of nuclear fission into America's beauty salons" would "revolutionize the hair care industry". After dousing her head with water and activating the dryer, May Porker accidentally irradiated herself, and in a fit of delusion, bit Peter, who then found himself transformed into an anthropomorphic swine much like May Porker herself.  Running from the Porker homestead disoriented, Peter soon came to realize that he still retained a spider's abilities:

''"This is astounding! Am I a spider with the limitations of a pig? Or a pig with the proportionate strength and agility of a spider? I've become something greater than either spider or pig... I've become a '''Spider-Ham!'''"''- '''Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham''' #15 (May 1987)

[[Image:2752_4_001.jpg|left|thumb|]] After this startling series of events, Peter (who adopted the surname "Porker", that of his benefactor May Porker, whom after the accident reverted mentally to a state in which she believed she was Peter's loving aunt) dedicated himself and his new-found abilities to fighting injustice and the occasional animal parody of established Marvel Comics villains.

==Misadventures==
Porker, in his spider-themed alter-ego's first adventure teamed him with Capt. Americat, as they attempted to foil the nefarious plot of "The Marauder", in a series of events that led to the creation of the Hulk-Bunny (Marvel Tails #1, "If He Should Punch Me").

Several months later, Spider-Ham encountered one of his only re-occurring menaces in the form of Ducktor Doom (''Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham'' #1, "The Mysterious Island of Ducktor Doom").  Spider-Ham would meet again with Doom when Porker would foil the would-be world conqueror's plot to create an army of living super vegetables (''Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham'' #6, "Salad Daze").

Other notable menaces Porker would face along the way include The Bull-Frog (a funny animal parody of the Marvel villain Man-Bull), the Buzzard (a opossum take on the Spider-Man adversary The Vulture), Hogzilla (a swine counterpart to the more popular Gojira, or as he's known in the United States, Godzilla), and The King-Pig (seemingly the swine equivalent of Marvel's mob-boss The Kingpin).

==Publishing history== 
These adventures appeared sporadically, finally ending sometime around issue #222.

After the cancellation of his solo series, ''Marvel Tales'', a monthly reprint series which specialized in reprints of Spider-Man's past adventures began carrying Porker as a back-up feature in 1987, beginning with issue #201 (cover dated July 1987).

Another notable appearance of the character was in the Marvel humor anthology title, ''What The--?!''.  In issue #3 of that title (cover dated October 1988), Porker met with Raven the Hunter (an obvious parody of Spider-Man's nemesis [[Kraven the Hunter]]) in a story that satirized the popular "Kraven's Last Hunt" storyline which had been featured a year earlier in Marvel's Spider-Man titles.

Even Marvel's once-popular ''2099'' line of titles wasn't safe, as seen in the 26th issue of ''What The--?!'' (cover dated Fall 1993), which featured "Spider-Ham 15.88", a humorous take-off on Peter Parker's 22nd century counterpart, Miguel O'Hara aka ''Spider-Man 2099''. 

In the recently-released ''Spider-Man Family'' , there was a new sixteen-page ''[[Spider-Girl]]'' story, in which May Parker ([[Peter Parker]]'s daughter) watches a [[DVD]] showing a small portion of a pretend episode of Spider-Ham, discovering that it was created by one of Spider-Man's enemies. Also in the issue, there was a reprint of ''Marvel Tails'' #1.                        

Spider-Ham was recently selected by fans and retailers to be the focus of the final variant cover by Mike Wieringo to the ''[[Spider-Man: The Other]]'' crossover, ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #528. [http://www.newsarama.com/forums/showthread.php?s=ad3412363ea73b231edc23562d89ff04&threadid=53776]
