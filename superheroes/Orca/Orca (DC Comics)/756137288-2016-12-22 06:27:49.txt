'''Orca''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]].

==Publication history==
Orca first appeared in ''[[Batman]]'' #579 and was created by [[Larry Hama]] and [[Scott McDaniel]].

==Fictional character biography==
'''Grace Balin''' attends Gotham Gate college and quickly becomes fascinated with the ocean. She receives a Ph.D in [[marine biology]] and Bio-Medicine and takes a job at the Gotham Aquarium. She is a very charitable person who funds an after-school program involving the ocean for underprivileged youths. She also volunteers at a soup shelter and takes care of many homeless people. Dr. Balin is later involved in an accident that leaves her paralyzed, dependent on a wheelchair for mobility. She continues to work at the Gotham Aquarium until it is supposed to be closed for lack of funding.

Grace experiments with spinal cord tissue regeneration using [[Killer whale|Orca]] spinal cord tissue. The [[gene therapy]] studies and human experimentation that she was conducting is deemed controversial and results in her loss of funding. It is implied that Grace used a chemical formula that she derived from an Orca in the aquarium on herself and that this is what caused her to transform into Orca. She is able to easily switch between being Orca and her regular appearance as Dr. Balin, although she is apparently still paralyzed as Balin even if Orca is fully mobile.

Orca begins a crime spree in [[Gotham City]] by stealing a valuable diamond called the Flame of Persia from rogue millionaire Camille Baden-Smythe. After the theft, [[Batman]] becomes involved. Orca's dedication to what she perceives as justice conflicts with Batman's attempts to see that everyone is entitled to legal protection even if he dislikes them personally. Orca aims to sell the diamond and use the proceeds to help fund several projects for underprivileged people. After her attempt to sell the diamond back to Camille Baden-Smythe fails with the discovery that she had stolen the diamond originally, Orca attempts to kill her. Camille's security force shoots Orca several times, mortally wounding her. After an extensive underwater chase — Batman using an aquatic-equipped suit — she begins changing back into Dr. Balin in an underwater cavern, telling Batman that the only way that she can survive is if he gives her the rest of the chemical formula that turned her into Orca, and that this would permanently transform her into Orca. Although Camille tried to forbid Batman from giving her the formula, arguing that such an action would make Batman responsible for everyone she would subsequently kill, Batman states that they are all responsible for their own actions, as well as that he refuses to allow anyone to die. Having ingested the formula, Orca swims away, resolved to continue her current career. It is revealed that the jewel was then sold to its original owner and that the money was used to build a new recreation center near the aquarium as well as to "...gentrify a derelict waterfront tenement."  

Orca is not seen again until she appears as a prisoner in the Slab during the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]’s "Last Laugh" riots. She is able to escape during the riots with [[King Shark]].<ref>''Joker: Last Laugh'' #2</ref>

[[One Year Later]], Orca is found dead in the sewers under Gotham City. She appears to have been shot in the head by [[Two-Face|Harvey Dent's]] gun, although Batman is convinced Dent is not the true killer. He finds that her body has been partially eaten by [[Killer Croc]]. Orca's husband Terry was murdered by [[Tally Man (comics)|The Tally Man]] while he was being questioned about the disappearance of his wife by a private investigator, [[Jason Bard]]. During the investigation it is revealed that Orca was working for [[Penguin (comics)|The Penguin]] along with now deceased super-villains [[KGBeast]], [[Magpie (comics)|Magpie]], as well as [[Ventriloquist (comics)|The Ventriloquist]]. Someone had contracted Orca and other supervillains to turn on The Penguin and rob one of his storage facilities. Harvey Dent catches them and instructs them to stay loyal to Penguin and to get any information they could about him. Dent is the prime suspect in their murders, but it turns out that they were orchestrated by the [[Great White Shark (comics)|Great White Shark]], who plans on becoming the top crime boss in Gotham. He manages to accomplish two tasks at once, weakening the Penguin's forces and transforming Harvey Dent back into Two-Face.<ref>''Detective Comics'' #819</ref>

===DC Rebirth===
In the [[DC Rebirth]] reboot universe, Orca and her Death Cycle are mentioned by Cheshire and Copperhead as some of the many villains that have attempted to kill Batman for Two-Face. <ref> All-Star Batman #2 </ref> Her first appearance is in ''Nightwing'' #11, where she is a part of a criminal group in [[Bludhaven]] called the Whale's Enders and is ordered to kill Nightwing.<ref> Nightwing Vol 4. #11 </ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Orca has enhanced strength and endurance, although her strength has not been enhanced to the point where a trained fighter like Batman would have significant trouble with her on land. Her main advantage lies in her exceptional swimming abilities, allowing her to be at complete ease in water, able to swim under water for long periods without taking a breath, forcing Batman to use an aquatic costume to effectively confront her on equal terms.

==In other media==
Orca will appear in ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]''.
