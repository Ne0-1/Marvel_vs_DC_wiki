'''Kid Colt''' is the name of two [[fictional character|fictional characters]] in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel Universe|universe]] — a [[cowboy]] and a cowboy-based [[super-hero]]. 

==Kid Colt I==

'''KID COLT I''' (real name: Blaine Colt) was a [[United States|American]] [[Western (genre)|Old West]] [[cowboy]] character who starred in his own [[comic book]] series as well as several other titles. He is the longest-running cowboy star in American comic-book publishing, featured in stories for 31-year stretch from [[1948]]-[[1979]], though from [[1966]] most of the published stories were reprints. 

Kid Colt's earliest adventures were written and drawn by [[Pete Tumlinson]]. The venerable [[Jack Keller (comics)|Jack Keller]] began his long association with the character starting with ''Kid Colt, Outlaw'' #25 (March [[1953]]). Marvel editor [[Stan Lee]] would later be credited as writer. Cover artists included such notables as [[Joe Maneely]], [[John Severin]] and [[Russ Heath]] until the frequent Marvel cover team of penciller [[Jack Kirby]] and inker [[Dick Ayers]] took over for the bulk of them from [[1959]]-[[1965]].

Kid Colt and his horse Steel first appeared in ''Kid Colt'' #1 (August [[1948]]), from Marvel predecessor [[Timely Comics]]. Originally his cover logo was subtitled "''Hero of the West''" but by issue three this was changed to "''Outlaw''". His origin, as told in ''Kid Colt'' #11 (September [[1950]]), involved Colt being wrongly accused of murder and becoming a fugitive from the law, along the way engaging in heroic good acts in an effort to restore his reputation. This origin is similar to that of the [[Rawhide Kid]], another Western character from Marvel's [[1950s]] iteration, [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]].

Kid Colt appeared in numerous series through the decade including ''All Western Winners'', ''Two-Gun Western'' and ''Gunsmoke Western''. In the late [[1960s]] and early [[1970s]] he appeared in the reprint title ''Mighty Marvel Western'' with the [[Two-Gun Kid]] and the Rawhide Kid, and in the three-issue ''Giant-Size Kid Colt'' reprint series. His signtature series ended with #229 (April [[1979]]).

The character has appeared sporadically in [[Marvel universe]] [[superhero]] titles, usually in stories involving [[time travel]] between the current era and Western times. These have included ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' Vol. 1, #141-43 (1975), ''[[The Fantastic Four]]'' Vol. 3, #33-34 ([[2000]]) and ''[[Black Panther (comics)|The Black Panther]]'' Vol. 3, #46-47 ([[2002]]).

It was not until 2000, with the [[miniseries]] ''[[Blaze of Glory (comics)|Blaze of Glory]]'' by writer [[John Ostrander]] and artist [[Leonardo Manco]], that a series set primarily in the Western genre again featured Kid Colt. The gritty ''Blaze of Glory'' — which featured different-looking versions of Marvel Western charcters and [[retcon|retconned]] that the naively clean-cut Marvel Western stories of years past were merely [[dime novel]] fictions of their actual lives — killed off Kid Colt in the series' conclusion (#4, March 2000).

==Kid Colt II==

'''Kid Colt II''' (real name: Elric Freedom Whitemane) is a contemporary [[super-hero]] character and has appeared as a member of the modern version of the [[Young Allies]]. His first appearance was in ''[[Heroes Reborn]]: Young Allies'' #1 (2000). He was created by [[Fabian Nicieza]] and [[Mark Bagley]].

This character has superhuman abilities derived from [[Extra-terrestrial|alien]]  [[Kymellian]] [[DNA]] and he wears a cowboy based costume in homage to the original Kid Colt.
