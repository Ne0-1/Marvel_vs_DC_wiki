The '''Silver Surfer''' '''(Norrin Radd)''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. Created by [[Jack Kirby]] and [[Stan Lee]], the character [[first appearance|first appears]] in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #48 ([[1966#March|March 1966]]), the first of a three-issue arc fans and historians call "The Galactus Trilogy".<ref>Thomas, Roy, ''Stan Lee's Amazing Marvel Universe'' (Sterling Publishing, New York, 2006), "Moment 29: The Galactus Trilogy", pp. 112-115.

Originally a young [[astronomer]] of the planet [[Zenn-La]], in order to save his home-world from destruction by a fearsome [[cosmic entities (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entity]] known as [[Galactus]], Norrin Radd made a bargain with the being, pledging himself to serve as his [[Herald of Galactus|herald]].  Imbued in return with a tiny portion of Galactus' [[Power Cosmic]],<ref name="officalmarvelpage">{{cite web

Galactus also created for Radd a [[surfboard]]-like craft &mdash; modeled after a childhood fantasy of his &mdash;  on which he would travel at speeds beyond that of [[light]]. Known from then on as the Silver Surfer, Radd began to roam the [[cosmos]] searching for new planets for Galactus to consume.  When his travels finally took him to [[Earth]], the Surfer came face-to-face with the [[Fantastic Four]], a team of powerful superheroes that helped him to rediscover his nobility of spirit. Betraying Galactus, the Surfer saved Earth but was punished in return by being [[exile]]d there.<ref name="fantasticfour48">''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #48 (March 1966)</ref> 

==Publication history==   
The Silver Surfer entered the world of comics as an unplanned addition to a story about Galactus and the Fantastic Four In the mid-1960s, Lee and Kirby were using a three-part method for creating comics.  They would first brainstorm rough ideas together, then Kirby would work individually to draw the scenes, and Lee would finally add the dialog.<ref name="Markstein">{{cite web

Kirby explained that a god-like cosmic [[predation|predator]] of planets like Galactus should have some sort of [[herald]], and that he created the surfboard "because I'm tired of drawing spaceships!"<ref name="excerpt"/> <ref name="theultimatesilversurfer">Quoted in Lee, [[Ibid.]]</ref> Taken by the noble features of the new character, Lee not only overcame his initial skepticism but also began adding to characterization, and the Silver Surfer soon became a key part of the unfolding story. <ref name="Markstein"/> 

Following the Surfer's debut, Lee and Kirby were inundated with letters of appreciation from fans,{{Fact|date=June 2007}} and brought him back as a recurring guest in ''Fantastic Four'' #55-61, 72, 74-77 (ranging Oct. 1966 - Aug. 1968) and made his solo debut in the backup story of  ''Fantastic Four Annual'' #5 (Nov. 1967).

Lee enjoyed the character and decided to feature him in his own individual title in 1968.  [[John Buscema]] was penciller for the first 17 issues of the series, with Kirby returning for the eighteenth and final issue. The first seven issues, which included anthological "Tales of the Watcher" backup stories, were 72-page (with advertising), 25-cent "giants", as opposed to typical 36-page, 12-cent comics of the time. Thematically, the stories dealt with the Surfer's exile on Earth and the inhumanity of man as observed by this noble yet fallen hero. The ''Silver Surfer'' comic book series became known as one of Lee's most thoughtful and introspective works. Englehart writes that Buscema and Lee were "pouring their souls into the series".<ref name="silversurfer2v3backcover">Back cover of ''The Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #2 (Aug. 1987)</ref> 

Nonetheless, the series was soon canceled. There was one attempt to revive the character in a joint episode with Marvel's [[Namor|Sub-Mariner]].  In the episode, Silver Surfer and Sub-Mariner became entwined in a "turf battle" and the Sub-Mariner defeated Silver Surfer.  This episode was upsetting to many Silver Surfer fans. According to Engelhart, the [[graphic novel]] format was too expensive to maintain indefinitely and the larger panels used by Buscema meant that there was, proportionately, a lesser amount of story per page than in other comics.<ref name="silversurfer2v3backcover" /> Moreover, the monologues and tragic hero persona of the new Surfer soon became unpopular.<ref name="silversurfer2v3backcover" /> After this comic's cancellation, the Surfer continued to make sporadic appearances as a guest star or [[antagonist]] in such comic books as ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'', ''[[Defenders (comics)|The Defenders]]'', and ''Fantastic Four''. Lee remained partial to the Surfer and even personally requested that each Silver Surfer comic contain a "Stan Lee presents" announcement.{{Fact|date=August 2007}}<!--there is no antecedent for this link, and no link or link text appears in footnotes: <ref name="silversurfer3v3backcover" />-->

Lee and Kirby collaborated on a Silver Surfer graphic novel published in 1978. Then, after a 1982 [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]]{{Fact|date=June 2007}} by writer-artist [[John Byrne]], the Surfer appeared in his second solo, ongoing title in 1987. Here he escaped the confines of [[Earth]] and left for the spaceways.{{Fact|date=August 2007}}<!--there is no antecedent for this link, and no link or link text appears in footnotes: <ref name="silversurfer3v3backcover" />--> Originally written by [[Steve Englehart]] and illustrated by [[Marshall Rogers]], the series would later be written by [[Jim Starlin]] and illustrated by [[Ron Lim]]. Starlin in turn would be succeeded by [[Ron Marz]], with [[George PÃ©rez]] and [[J. M. DeMatteis]] also having brief stints at writing the series. Additional artists included [[Tom Grindberg]], [[Ron Garney]], and [[Jon J. Muth]], as well as periodic guest spots by the aforementioned [[John Buscema]]. Although the title experienced great initial success, and continued to be buoyed by tie-ins to "[[Infinity Gauntlet]]" and other company crossovers, this second ongoing series was canceled in 1998 after 146 issues.

''The Silver Surfer: Parable'', scripted by Lee and drawn by [[Jean Giraud|Moebius]], was serialized in two parts in 1988 and 1989.  Because of inconsistencies with other stories, it has been argued that these stories actually feature an alternate Silver Surfer from a parallel Earth.<ref>{{cite web

Following the miniseries, a new ongoing Silver Surfer series began in 2003, focusing on the character's alien nature and messianic allegory. It lasted 14 issues. The Surfer later appeared in an issue of ''[[Cable & Deadpool]]'' and has twice been reunited with the superhero group the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. Silver Surfer has initially appeared as a guest star in the 12-issue long Planet Hulk storyline (preceding Marvel's 2007 crossover [[World War Hulk]]), but was revealed to have a much more imporant role later on.

In 2006-2007, he starred in the four-issue miniseries ''[[Annihilation (comics)#Annihilation: Silver Surfer|Annihilation: Silver Surfer]]'' and co-starred in the miniseries  ''[[Annihilation (comics)#Annihilation: Heralds of Galactus|Heralds of Galactus]]'', both part of the "Annihilation" [[fictional crossover]].

Following Annihilation, Silver Surfer appeared in Dwayne McDuffie and Paul Pelletiere's take on the Fantastic Four's first post-Civil war crossover storyline, called Reconstruction: Silver Surfer. Silver Surfer acted as a herald of Galactus.

In 2007, the Silver Surfer starred in the out of continuity four-issue miniseries ''Silver Surfer: Requiem'' by JMS and Esad Ribic. The first issue was released May 30, 2007 to coincide with the character's first movie appearance. <ref name="ssrequiemign">{{cite web

==Fictional character biography==
===Herald of Galactus===
[[Image:Toss.pngâ|''The Silver Surfer'' vol. 1, #1 (Aug. 1968). Cover art by [[John Buscema]] and [[Joe Sinnott]].|thumb]]
The Silver Surfer was born Norrin Radd on the idyllic planet [[Zenn-La]].  His father is Jartan Radd, his mother Elmar Radd, and his half-brother Fennan Radd. All four are part of an ancient and significantly advanced civilization that has lost the will to strive or explore, leaving Norrin Radd restless and yearning for something more than the idle pleasure pursued by his fellows. Faced suddenly with the total destruction of his world by planet-consuming Galactus, Radd strikes a deal with the omnipotent space-god.  In return for the safety of Zenn-La and his lover, [[Shalla-Bal]], Radd pledges himself to serve as Galactus' [[Herald of Galactus|herald]] and to seek out other planets for the world devourer to feed on.  In striking this bargain, Radd also satisfies his long-held desire to adventure beyond the limiting world of his home. Accepting the young mortal's sacrifice, Galactus imbues him with a portion of the [[Power Cosmic]], transforming him into the Silver Surfer.<ref name="silversurfer1v1">''Silver Surfer #1'' (Aug. 1968)</ref> Radd proceeds to serve Galactus for an unspecified amount of time, unable to return to Zenn-La and Shalla-Bal. During this time, the Surfer tries to seek out uninhabited planets for the world-eater's attention, but as they became harder to find, Galactus tampers with the Surfer's conscience and removes this self-imposed restraint. Eventually, the Surfer arrives on Earth and, after deciding that the planet is ripe for Galactus' nourishment, summons his master.
<!-- In later versions of the story, it was explained that the Zenn-Lavians were an offshoot of the [[Kree]], a scientifically advanced, galaxy-spanning, alien race first created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in the [[Fantastic Four]]. Note: Please find references before putting this back. -->

Here the Surfer meets the [[Fantastic Four]]. Touched by their nobility, he chooses to rebel against Galactus and attempts to prevent his master from consuming the planet. Galactus is eventually driven off, but as punishment for this rebellion he confines the Surfer to the planet with an invisible barrier that affects only him.<ref name="fantasticfour50">''Fantastic Four'' #50 (May 1966)</ref>

===Exiled to Earth===
Stories immediately following the Surfer's exile to Earth depict him as a semi-divine being, immeasurably powerful yet lacking the most basic understanding of good or evil. A completely [[Amorality|amoral]] entity, he develops a sense of compassion through contact with the gentle [[Alicia Masters]], a blind sculptress capable of perceiving the Surfer's innate nobility.<ref name="fantasticfour48" /> This theme continues through a series of subplots wherein the Surfer encounters various negative human traits including [[jealousy]] (when [[Thing (comics)|The Thing]] is driven to rage by the Surfer's relationship with his girlfriend, Alicia), deception, evil, cruelty (de-powered and imprisoned by [[Doctor Doom]], then tortured by Doom's brutal henchmen), despair, hopelessness (languishing in a Latverian dungeon while Doom uses the Power Cosmic to conquer the world), and finally a thirst for revenge (destroying Doom's castle along with his sadistic captors when he finally escapes). At the same time, however, the Surfer continues to evolve as an individual, slowly groping his way to a knowledge of his own humanity.

[[Image:SilverSurfer3.jpg|thumb|left|''The Silver Surfer'' #3 (Dec. 1968). Cover art by Buscema and Sinnott, depicting [[Shalla-Bal]] (in left hand of demon [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]).]]
During his exile, the Surfer fights numerous villains, including but not limited to Doctor Doom and [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]. Doom is obsessed with stealing the Surfer's Power Cosmic and finally does so, only to lose it by colliding with Galactus' barrier.<ref name="fantasticfour72">''Fantastic Four'' #57 (Dec. 1966)</ref> The demonic [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] is equally persistent in trying to acquire the Surfer's soul by breaking his spirit, but Surfer's innate nobility thwarts him each time.<ref name="silversurfer3v1">''The Silver Surfer'' vol. 1, #3 (Dec. 1968)</ref>.

The Surfer's only ally during these trials is a physicist by the name of Al B. Harper, who eventually sacrifices himself to save the world from the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]].<ref name="silversurfer5v1">''The Silver Surfer'' vol. 1, #5 (April 1969)</ref> Angry at the general disregard shown by humans, the Surfer once goes so far as to declare war on humanity, but the [[Military of the United States|U.S. military]] strikes him down with an experimental power-draining "Sonic Shark" missile and forces him to resume his wanderings. 

Banding together with [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]] during these wanderings, the Surfer forms the "Titans Three," a group dedicated to battling evil on Earth.<ref name="submariner34">''Sub-Mariner'' #34-35 (Feb.-March 1971)</ref> Soon, [[Doctor Strange]] joins the group and it becomes "the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]." Surfer stays with them for a while, but his overwhelming desire to be free of Earth and his frequent collisions with Galactus' energy-draining barrier eventually drives him to leave the group.  

During this time in exile, the Surfer is reunited with Shalla-Bal on several occasions, but almost every time she appears as an unwilling pawn of his enemies, and he is invariably forced to let her go to save the planet.  During an Avengers-Defenders clash orchestrated by alien menaces [[Nebulon (comics)|Nebulon]] and Supernalia, the Surfer finally pierces Galactus' barrier with the aid of [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] and temporarily escapes Earth.  He discovers, though, that his home-world has been ravaged by Galactus and Shalla-Bal has been abducted by Mephisto and taken to Earth.  Even though it means trapping himself once more, the Surfer returns to Earth to defeat Mephisto.  Before being vanquished, Mephisto sends Shalla-Bal back to Zenn-La, but the Surfer manages to endow her with a portion of his Power Cosmic, which she uses to revitalize their ravaged home-world.<ref name="silversurfer1v2">''The Silver Surfer'' vol. 2, #1 (June 1978)</ref>

===Freedom from exile===
After all this time in exile, the Surfer finally manages to pierce Galactus' barrier once and for all by acting on the Thing's simple suggestion of trying to pass through without his surfboard.  He also manages to make peace with Galactus by rescuing his current herald, [[Nova (Frankie Raye)]], from the [[Skrull]]s, after which Galactus finally declares the Surfer's long exile ended.<ref name="silversurfer1v3">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #1 (July 1987)</ref> He immediately revisits his home-world, but Shalla-Bal, in his absence, had become empress of the rejuvenated Zenn-La and hence unable to renew their romance.<ref name="silversurfer2v3">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #2 (Aug. 1987)</ref> 

Embroiled in fresh hostilities between the interstellar [[Kree]] and Skrull empires, the Surfer also intervenes in a series of plots by the [[Elders of the Universe]], who plan to become supremely powerful by destroying Galactus and the universe with him. The Surfer thwarts this plot with the aid of his new love interest, [[Mantis (Marvel Comics)|Mantis]], the Earth-born cosmic heroine also known as the "Celestial Madonna". She seems to die in the process, and although she eventually returns, she never fully renews their romances.<ref name="silversurfer9v3">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #9 (March 1988)</ref> After this loss, a grief-stricken Surfer turns to Nova and romantic feelings begin to develop between them.<ref name="silversurfer14v3">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #14 (Aug 1988)</ref> The Surfer's influence gradually leads Nova to question the morality of her role as herald to Galactus.<ref name="silversurfer51v3">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #51 (July 1991)</ref> Eventually replaced by the far more ruthless [[Morg]], Nova dies in a conflict between the new herald and the Surfer and the other ex-heralds.<ref name="silversurfer75v3">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #75 (Dec. 1992)</ref>

[[Image:Silversurfervolume3.jpgâ|''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #1 (July 1987). Cover art by [[Marshall Rogers]] and [[Josef Rubinstein]].|thumb]]
The Surfer, during this period, repeatedly battles other space-born menaces, the chief of whom is [[Thanos]],<ref name="silversurfer34v3">''Silver Surfer'' #34 (Feb. 1990)</ref> a death-worshipping mutant of the race the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]] who wipes out half the life in the universe using the omnipotent [[Infinity Gauntlet]].<ref name="InfinityGauntlet1">''Infinity Gauntlet'' #1 (July 1991)</ref> The Surfer also finds interstellar allies in [[Adam Warlock]]'s [[Infinity Watch]], forms the short-lived "Star Masters" team, and begins attending occasional Defenders reunions.  During his travels, the Surfer also meets his long-lost half-brother, Fennan, to whom Shalla-Bal has become married.<ref name="silversurfer101v3">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #101 (Feb. 1995)</ref> 

In one of his adventures, the Surfer discovers the way in which Galactus tampered with his mind during his time as herald.<ref name="silversurfer48v3">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #48 (April 1991)</ref> Further aspects of his past life are also revealed, including the fact that he saw his mother's dead body after she slit her own wrists<ref name="silversurfer57v3">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #57 (Oct. 1991)</ref> and that his father, a prominent scientist, was accused of having plagiarized and shot himself in response to Norrin's disappointment.<ref name="silversurfer50v3">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #50 (June 1991)</ref> During the ''Infinity Gauntlet'' saga, the Surfer eventually confronts these memories and comes to forgive himself.<ref name="silversurfer58v3">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #58 (Nov. 1991)</ref> 

After saving a distant part of the universe from destruction at the hands of the Uni-Lord, a powerful god-like entity,<ref name="silversurfer111v3">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #111 (Dec. 1995)</ref> the Surfer returns home only to find that Zenn-La and its people have vanished.  Trying to determine what has happened, he comes to the horrible realization that his home-world was actually destroyed years ago, in the 1940s, by the mysterious, all powerful entity known as the Other. The Zenn-Lavian world and the people that he encountered on his return from exile were actually re-creations of the originals. Galactus, after finding Zenn-La ruined by the Other, recreated the planet and its inhabitants in every detail so that the Surfer would have a home to return to when he left his service.<ref name="silversurfer130v3">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #130 (Aug. 1997)</ref> So accurate was this new Zenn-La that the Surfer, [[Skrull]], [[Kree]], the demonic [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], and even the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]] never realized that it wasn't the original planet or people. Why the "new" Zenn-La dissolved was never made entirely clear by the comics, but it was likely the result of Galactus' temporary absence from the main universe due to being caught in the [[Ultimate Nullifier]]'s blast. Losing his capacity for emotion again, the Surfer returns to Earth, eventually regaining his personality during a time travel adventure and sharing a romance with [[Alicia Masters]].<ref name="silversurfer129v3">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #129 (June 1997)</ref> The two ultimately part as friends after many adventures together. 

After the Fantastic Four were resurrected in the aftermath of the [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught crisis]] and their return from the [[Heroes Reborn]] universe, the Surfer came to Earth to welcome them home, but ended up joining [[Spider-Man]] in his latest battle against [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]]. During this fight, the Carnage symbiote briefly managed to take over the Surfer, but the Surfer was able to expel the symbiote, trapping Carnage in an unbreakable prison where he would be forced to reflect upon his sins for all eternity <ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 1, #430 to #431</ref> (although he later escaped under as-yet-undisclosed circumstances). When a [[Gaea (Marvel Comics)|Gaea]]-powered curse from a dying [[Yandroth]] mystically forces Surfer, Namor, Hulk, and Strange to assemble in response to any and all threats to the Earth, the ongoing stress coupled with the curse's subtle emotional influence gradually drive the four senior Defenders mad, and they attempt to conquer the world as "[[The Order (comics)|the Order]]" in the belief that this is the most efficient way to protect the planet. Their fellow Defenders [[Patsy Walker|Hellcat]], [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Nighthawk]], [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]], and [[Clea]] team up with other heroes â including Ardina, a cosmic-powered woman they mystically create from a portion of the Surfer's own energy â to oppose the Order and return them to their senses, just in time to prevent the curse from rendering a resurrected Yandroth all-powerful.

In the 2003 ''Silver Surfer'' series, the Surfer works with the alien Annunaki race to gather and protect some of Earth's most extraordinarily gifted children.<ref name="silversurfer1v4">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 4, #1 (March 2004)</ref> In the end, one of these children, Ellie Waters, saves Earth from the godlike [[Marduk]] entity, preventing the apocalypse and reordering reality as if the Marduk crisis had never happened (though Ellie alone apparently retains her memories of these events).<ref name="silversurfer1v4">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 4, #12 (Oct. 2004)</ref> The Surfer then resumes his interstellar wanderings, but promises to be ready to aid his adopted home-world should Earth ever need him.

===Planet Hulk===
During his travels, Surfer was captured by a portal of the Planet Sakaar Empire. Left weakened and vulnerable by his trip through the portal, the Surfer was subdued and implanted with an obedience slug to ensure he remained loyal to them. Fighting as a gladiator (and believed to be the fabled 'Sakaarson' due to his appearance), the Surfer was finally forced to face the Hulk along with his [[Warbound]]. Through teamwork and distraction, the Hulk was eventually able to destroy the Surfer's obedience slug. The Hulk and several other slaves and gladiators were freed when the Surfer used the Power Cosmic to remove their own obedience slugs and give them a way out of the arena, although the Hulk declines the Surfer's offer to take him back to Earth.<ref>[[Greg Pak]], ''The Incredible Hulk'' #95</ref>

===Annihilation===
{{Main|Annihilation (comics)}}
He later joins other [[herald of Galactus|heralds of Galactus]] against the forces of the Annihilation Wave, and becomes Galactus' herald once more, to help save the universe from the despot [[Annihilus]], and two proemial gods called "Tenebrous, of The Darkness Between" and "Aegis, Lady of All Sorrows".<ref>''Annihilation: Silver Surfer'' #1-4 (June- Sept. 2006)</ref> The gods defeat and capture the duo, and give them to [[Annihilus]] and the alien mastermind [[Thanos]] for experimentation. Thanos learns of Annihilus' more nefarious goals and attempts to free Galactus, but before he can do so, Thanos is killed by [[Drax the Destroyer]]. When Drax discovers Thanos' plan, he frees the Surfer, who in turn frees Galactus. An enraged Galactus destroys half the Annihilation Wave, allowing a group called the United Front to defeat Annihilus.<ref>''[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]'' #1-6 (Oct. 2006 - March 2007)</ref> The Surfer tracks down Aegis and Tenebrous, and when completely outmatched, manoeuvres them into entering [[Antimatter#Antiuniverse|The Crunch]], the all-destroying border of the universe, whereupon he fully returns to his role as Galactus' herald, now partnered with [[Stardust (Marvel Comics)|Stardust]].<ref>''Annihilation: Heralds of Galactus'' #1-2 (April-May 2007)</ref>

When Galactus exiled the Surfer to Earth, his means of imprisonment was linked to the board.

===Ultimate Silver Surfer===
[[Image:UltimateSilversurferFF43.jpgâ|''[[Ultimate Fantastic Four]]'' #43 (Aug. 2007). Cover art by [[Pasqual Ferry]]|thumb]]

[[Warren Ellis]]'s [[Ultimate Galactus Trilogy]] originally suggested that [[The Ultimates]]' ally the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] was the herald of Galactus, a robotic probe that travels through space warning civilizations of the impending arrival of [[Galactus#Ultimate Gah Lak Tus|Gah Lak Tus]]. In the final mini-series of the trilogy, ''[[Ultimate Galactus Trilogy#Ultimate Extinction|Ultimate Extinction]]'', silvery humanoids began to appear, sent to trigger mass suicides in order to reduce the population's resistance. Suicide cults founded by the creatures began to appear all across the globe as Gah Lak Tus drew near. These silvery beings had the ability to grow wings, morph into an [[oval|ovoid]], or take an intermediary form, gliding on an oval surface. They also demonstrated the ability to manipulate large quantities of energy.  All these traits are reminiscent of the Surfer, but it was never specifically stated that they were his ''[[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate]]'' version.

In ''[[Ultimate Fantastic Four]]'' #42, the Silver Surfer makes his proper, named appearance in the Ultimate Universe. He is teleported to Earth after Reed mistakes him for a star that he is trying to harness. His appearance triggers planet-wide chaos and natural calamities. In #43, Reed comments that Gah Lak Tus seems to have modeled its drones on the Surfer, and the Surfer gives his name as Norin Radd. He also states that he will summon his "master", who will make the population of the Earth happier than they have ever been.<ref name="ultimateff43">''Ultimate Fantastic Four'' #43 (May 2007)</ref>

In #44, the Surfer's master is revealed to be Zenn-La's ruler, Revka Temerlune Edifex Scyros III, "the king without enemies", who uses mind-control to make the population of Earth worship him (before it takes effect on the Fantastic Four, the Human Torch calls him "[[Psycho-Man]]"). It is revealed that the Surfer has been exiled from Zenn-La for destroying the control that Psycho-Man had over Zenn-la, but because of finding Earth for his master to "save" he may return. After Psycho-Man gains domain over Earth, Silver Surfer rescues Mr. Fantastic, tells him his story, and asks him to save Earth. The Surfer then helps the Fantastic Four defeat other Surfer like assassins of Psycho-Man. With the Surfers beaten and the insane Psycho-Man reprogrammed, Silver Surfer wanders the space ways. 

Among his people, the Surfer is referred to as the Silver Searcher.

===Carnage Cosmic===
The Silver Surfer bonds with the [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]] [[symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] in two issues of ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', gaining the name "Carnage Cosmic".  He looks like the original Carnage from the [[Spider-Man]] comics, but still has the trademark surfboard of the Silver Surfer. In a ''[[What If (comics)|What If?]]'' storyline, the symbiote remained bonded to the Surfer, forcing Spider-Man and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] to battle him until [[Firestar]] was able to use her powers to disrupt the symbiote's control over the Surfer. Realizing that there was only one way to stop the Carnage symbiote, the Silver Surfer flew himself into the sun, destroying both himself and the symbiote <ref>''What If?'' vol. 2 #108</ref>.

===Exiles===
On Earth 552, Norrin Radd had been a great military scientist who accidentally destroyed his own world with his greatest invention. Determined to bring it back to existence, he approached Galactus, Restorer of Worlds, and became his herald in the hope that Galactus would resurrect his world in exchange for his service. However, Galactus had taken an oath to only revive those worlds destroyed by the Blight. An enraged Silver Surfer then turned against his master, destroying those who worshipped him and attempting to kill Galactus himself in order to steal the knowledge of world restoration. This led to the destruction of Earth, the coming of the Exiles, the deaths of the Shi'ar Imperial Guard Elite, and inevitably the Surfer's own destruction.<ref name="exiles87">{{cite web

===Marvel Zombies=== 
The Silver Surfer is a victim of the ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'' in that continuity. Instead of coming to Earth and meeting the Fantastic Four, he is attacked by a horde of zombies.  After fighting valiantly, he is killed by the Zombie Hulk, and his body is devoured by a few of the zombies (Hulk, Colonel America, Giant-Man, Iron Man, Luke Cage, Wolverine, and Spider-Man). His corpse grants the zombies his cosmic powers, which they use to kill all of the other zombie heroes and villains. Afterwards, they use the powers to kill and eat Galatctus before learning they can fly and survive in space, allowing them to prey on the rest of the universe.<ref name="marvelzombies5">''Marvel Zombies'' #5'' (April 2006)</ref>

===MC2===
During the finale of ''[[Last Planet Standing]]'', the Silver Surfer foils Galactus' plan to create a new Big Bang, merging with Galactus himself in the process to become a new being. Gaining control of Galactus' powers, the new entity undoes the damage done by the old Galactus.<ref name="lastplanetstanding5">''Last Planet Standing'' #5 (July 2006)</ref>

===The Keeper===
In the [[alternate history|alternate timeline]] of Earth-691, notably the [[Guardians of the Galaxy]] issues #24 and #25 story arc, Norrin Radd was featured as The Keeper. This new version of the Silver Surfer sans his surfboard had [[Quasar (comics)#Quantum bands|Quantum Bands]], which augmented his "Power Cosmic" and designated him as the Protector of the Universe, as with other bearers of the Bands before him. He works with the Guardians in an attempt to kill Galactus once and for all, his first attempt with Firelord and Dargo-Thor having failed.  Eventually, the Keeper realizes that, with his augmented power, he can supply Galactus with the energy he needs and end the Planet-Eater's consumption of worlds.  [[Eon (comics)|Eon]], cosmic being and creator of the Quantum Bands, reveals that this was the ultimate purpose of the Keeper becoming the Protector of the Universe, and he enters into a symbiotic partnership with Galactus, who accepts the Keeper as an equal; he is last seen leaving with Galactus, riding a silver surfboard once more.

===Earth X/Universe X/Paradise X===
In issue 11 and 12 of the ''[[Earth X]]'' series, Black Bolt calls upon Galactus to come destroy the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]] seed growing within Earth.  The Silver Surfer accompanies him along with his love Shalla-Bal, who had now been turned into a silver herald of Galactus as well.  He briefly helps Galactus fight an army brought together by a boy calling himself the [[Red Skull]].

[[Image:surfertoon.jpg|200px|thumb|The Silver Surfer from the ''[[Silver Surfer (TV series)|Silver Surfer animated series]]''.]]

The Surfer's first animated appearance was in "Galactus," an episode of the [[Hanna-Barbera]] [[1967]] ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' animated series, which closely followed the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] comic story.<ref name="1967cog">{{cite web

This series also adhered closely to the original comic book story, recounting Surfer and Galactus' coming to Earth in a two-part episode as well as Doctor Doom's theft of Surfer's powers.<ref name="1994cog">{{cite web

In 1998, the Surfer starred in a [[Silver Surfer (TV series)|solo animated series]] on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX Network]], voiced by Paul Essiembre.  Blending [[cel-shaded animation|cel]] and [[computer animation]], this series was rendered in the style of Surfer creator [[Jack Kirby]] but diverged from the comic in various ways. Although it accurately depicted the Surfer's origin on Zenn-La, the method by which he regained his emotions and memories was altered to not involve the Fantastic Four.  Further adventures included appearances by many characters from Marvel's "cosmic" stable, including [[Thanos]], the [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]], [[Ego the Living Planet]], Mentor, [[Drax the Destroyer]], [[Pip the Troll]], [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]], and the [[Kree]] and [[Skrull]] empires, their portrayals and roles often differing from their comic book incarnations. Possessed of an unusually serious tone compared to Marvel's other animated projects, with frequent maudlin musings by the Surfer and episode resolutions which were often downbeat, the series was canceled after only one season of thirteen episodes, ending on a cliffhanger. Eight further episodes for the next season were written but never animated.<ref name="ssscripts">{{cite web

{{main|Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer}}
[[Image:Surfermovie3.jpgâ|200px|thumb|left|The Silver Surfer in ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]'' (2007).]]  
The Silver Surfer made his film debut in [[20th Century Fox]]'s ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]],'' the sequel to the 2005 film ''[[Fantastic Four (film)|Fantastic Four]].'' [[Doug Jones (actor)|Doug Jones]] played the Surfer on set, and a computer simulation enhanced the reflective look of his prosthetics.<ref>{{cite news | author = Thomas J. McLean  | title = Fantastic 4: Weta Gives Rise to the Silver Surfer | publisher = VFXWorld | date = [[2007-06-21]] | url = http://www.vfxworld.com/?atype=articles&id=3325&page=1 | accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref> [[Laurence Fishburne]] provided the character's voice. Assured of the film's commercial success, 20th Century Fox hired [[J. Michael Straczynski]] to write the screenplay for a [[Fantastic Four film series#Future|spin-off film]]. Straczynski said his script is a sequel, but will also delve into the Surfer's origins.<ref>{{cite news | author = Chris Carle | title = SDCC 07: JMS Sheds Light on Silver Surfer Movie | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = [[2007-07-27]] | url = http://movies.ign.com/articles/808/808908p1.html | accessdate=2007-10-07}}</ref>

In this continuity, the Surfer's origins are highly similar to that of his comic-book incarnation, in that he agreed to become [[Galactus]]' herald in return for the safety of his home-world, Zenn-La, and the woman he loved, Shalla-Bal. The movie incarnation differs from his comics counterpart in that instead of having innate power (the [[Power Cosmic]]), his power comes from the surfboard itself, which also serves as a beacon for Galactus. In the end, the Surfer turns on Galactus after he witnesses [[Invisible Woman|Sue Storm]] die in Reed's arms. The Surfer brings Sue back to life and then goes off to destroy Galactus, appearing to implode when he does. At the end of the film, Surfer is floating aimlessly through space, with his board in the background. As he drifts off screen, his eyes open and his board drifts towards him.

In promotion for the film, the [[Franklin Mint]], a collectibles marketer, altered 40,000 [[50 State Quarters|California quarters]] by putting the Silver Surfer on the reverse.<ref>[http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/national/1110AP_Silver_Surfer_Coin.html Silver Surfer Coin]</ref> The [[United States Mint|U.S. Mint]], upon discovering this, informed the studio and the Franklin Mint that it is illegal to turn a coin into advertising media, and violators can face a fine.<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18873168/ Associated Press (May 29, 2007): "'Silver Surfer' coin steams U.S. Mint"]</ref>

===Video games===
*The ''[[Silver Surfer (video game)|Silver Surfer]]'' video game, developed by [[Software Creations (UK)|Software Creations]], Ltd., debuted on the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] in 1990. The game is notorious for its unforgiving and extremely steep difficulty.<ref name="ssvg">{{cite web

*He is a bonus character in the game ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'' voiced by [[Chris Cox (actor)|Chris Cox]]. He can be unlocked by completing all Comic Book Missions or by entering a cheat code.

*The Surfer most recently appeared in the  [[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer (video game)|video game adaptation]] of the movie, developed by [[Visual Concepts]] of 2K Sports. It was released in June 2007 to coincide with the film's release.<ref name="ff4rotssvgame">{{cite web

===Philately===
The [[United States Postal Service]] in November 2007, released a series of $0.41 stamps honoring Marvel comics. One stamp shows the Silver Surfer on his board and another the first eponymous issue.<ref>http://shop.usps.com/wcsstore/PostalStore/upload/images/600x600_461440.jpg</ref> Associated paraphernalia (e.g., first day covers) were also available.

===Cultural references===
Numerous films, songs, books and television shows have referenced the Silver Surfer since his 1960s debut. In the [[1983 in film|1983]] film ''[[Breathless (1983 film)|Breathless]]'', [[Richard Gere]]'s character was an avid fan of his comics. In [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s [[1992 in film|1992]] ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]'' a Silver Surfer poster is clearly seen in Mr. Orange's apartment. In Futurama Comics, Bender accidentally deactivates the autopilot of the planet express ship, causing the ship to fly out of control, knock the silver sufer off his board, then enter a space invaders video game style battle. In the [[1995 in film|1995]] film ''[[Crimson Tide (film)|Crimson Tide]]'', there was an argument over the alternate Surfer versions as drawn by Kirby and Moebius. He has also been mentioned in [[television program]]s such as ''[[Heroes (TV series)|Heroes]]''; ''[[Malibu, CA (TV series)|Malibu, CA]]''; ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'';<ref name="scrubsref">{{cite web

In one of Satriani's other albums, "Engines of Creation", there is a song called "The Power Cosmic" included on the track list. In the song, "Last of the New Wave Riders", from the album, [[Adventures in Utopia]] by [[Todd Rundgren]]'s band, [[Utopia (band)|Utopia]], the final line (bracketed as an aside) is "here comes that Silver Surfer now". UK Symphonic Black Metal band [[Bal-Sagoth]] featured "The Scourge of the Fourth Celestial Host", a track about the Silver Surfer, on their aptly titled ''The Power Cosmic'' album.
