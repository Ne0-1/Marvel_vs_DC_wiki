The '''Silver Surfer''' (or '''Norrin Radd''') is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]] created by [[Jack Kirby]]. The character [[first appearance|first appears]] in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #48 (March 1966), the first of a three-issue arc fans and historians call "The Galactus Trilogy".<ref>Thomas, Roy, ''Stan Lee's Amazing Marvel Universe'' (Sterling Publishing, New York, 2006), "Moment 29: The Galactus Trilogy", pp. 112-115.

Originally a young [[astronomer]] of the planet [[Zenn-La]], '''Norrin Radd''' made a bargain with a being, pledging himself to serve as his [[Herald of Galactus|herald]] in order to save his home-world from destruction by the fearsome [[cosmic entities (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entity]] known as [[Galactus]].

Galactus also created for Radd a [[surfboard]]-like craft &mdash; modeled after a childhood fantasy of his &mdash;  on which he would travel at speeds beyond that of [[light]]. Known from then on as the Silver Surfer, Radd began to roam the [[cosmos]] searching for new planets for Galactus to consume.  When his travels finally took him to [[Earth]], the Surfer came face-to-face with the [[Fantastic Four]], a team of powerful superheroes that helped him to rediscover his nobility of spirit. Betraying Galactus, the Surfer saved Earth but was punished in return by being [[exile]]d there.<ref name="fantasticfour48">''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #48 (March 1966)</ref> 

==Publication history==
===Early appearances===
The Silver Surfer debuted as an unplanned addition to the [[superhero]]-team comic ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #48 ([March 1966). The comic's writer-editor, [[Stan Lee]], and its [[penciler]] and co-plotter, [[Jack Kirby]], had by the mid-1960s developed using a three-collaborative technique known as the "[[Marvel Method]]": The two would discuss story ideas, Kirby would work from a brief synopsis to draw the individual scenes and plot details, and Lee would finally add the dialog and captions. When Kirby turned in his pencil art for the story, he included a new character he and Lee had not discussed.<ref name="Markstein">{{cite web

''Kirby: King of Comics'' ([[Harry N. Abrams]], New York, 2008), p. 141</ref> After Kirby explained that the story's agreed-upon [[antagonist]], a god-like cosmic [[predation|predator]] of planets named [[Galactus]] should have some sort of [[herald]], and that he created the surfboard "because I'm tired of drawing spaceships!"<ref name="theultimatesilversurfer">Quoted in Lee, ''The Ultimate Silver Surfer''</ref> and Lee, taken by the noble features of the new character, who turned on his master to help defend Earth, overcame his initial skepticism and began adding characterization. The Silver Surfer soon became a key part of the unfolding story.<ref name="Markstein"/> 

Following the Surfer's debut, Lee and Kirby brought him back as a recurring guest in ''Fantastic Four'' #55-61, 72, 74-77 (ranging Oct. 1966 - Aug. 1968), and the character his solo debut in the backup story of  ''Fantastic Four Annual'' #5 (Nov. 1967).
[[Image:SilverSurferGN.jpg|thumb|left|''The Silver Surfer'' (1978), one of the first [[graphic novel]]s. Cover art by [[Earl Norem]].]]

The following year, Lee launched the solo title ''The Silver Surfer''. [[John Buscema]] was penciller for the first 17 issues of the series, with Kirby returning for the 18th and final issue. The first seven issues, which included anthological "Tales of the Watcher" backup stories, were 72-page (with advertising), 25-cent "giants", as opposed to the typical 36-page, 12-cent comics of the time. Thematically, the stories dealt with the Surfer's exile on Earth and the inhumanity of man as observed by this noble yet fallen hero. Though short-lived, the series became known as one of Lee's most thoughtful and introspective works.<ref name="silversurfer2v3backcover">Marvel Comics writer [[Steve Englehart]], for example, in his back-cover text for ''The Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #2 (Aug. 1987), wrote that Buscema and Lee were "pouring their souls into the series".</ref>

Following his series' cancellation, the Surfer made sporadic appearances as a guest star or [[antagonist]] in such comic books as ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'', ''[[Defenders (comics)|The Defenders]]'', and ''Fantastic Four''. Lee remained partial to the Surfer, and with Kirby collaborated on a seminal 1978 [[graphic novel]] starring the character.

===Subsequent series===
After a 1982 [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] by writer-artist [[John Byrne]], the Surfer appeared in his second solo, ongoing title in 1987. Here he escaped the confines of Earth and left for the spaceways. Originally written by [[Steve Englehart]] and illustrated by [[Marshall Rogers]], the series would later be written by [[Jim Starlin]] and illustrated by [[Ron Lim]]. Starlin in turn would be succeeded by [[Ron Marz]], with [[George Pérez]] and [[J. M. DeMatteis]] also having brief writing stints. Additional artists included [[Tom Grindberg]], [[Ron Garney]], and [[Jon J. Muth]], as well as periodic guest spots by the aforementioned [[John Buscema]]. Although the title experienced great initial success, and continued to be buoyed by tie-ins to "[[Infinity Gauntlet]]" and other company crossovers, this second ongoing series was canceled in 1998 after 146 issues.  It was followed in 1999 by the two issue mini-series, Silver Surfer: Loftier Than Mortals.

''The Silver Surfer: Parable'', scripted by Lee and drawn by [[Jean Giraud|Moebius]], was serialized in two parts in 1988 and 1989.  Because of inconsistencies with other stories, it has been argued that these stories actually feature an alternate Silver Surfer from a parallel Earth.<ref>{{cite web

===The 2000s===
A new ongoing Silver Surfer series began in 2003, focusing on the character's alien nature and messianic allegory. It lasted 14 issues. The Surfer later appeared in an issue of ''[[Cable & Deadpool]]'' and has twice been reunited with the superhero group the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. In 2006-2007, he starred in the four-issue miniseries ''[[Annihilation (comics)#Annihilation: Silver Surfer|Annihilation: Silver Surfer]]'' and co-starred in the miniseries  ''[[Annihilation (comics)#Annihilation: Heralds of Galactus|Heralds of Galactus]]'', both part of the "Annihilation" [[fictional crossover]].

In 2007, the Silver Surfer starred in a four-issue miniseries ''[[Silver Surfer: Requiem]]'' by writer [[J. Michael Straczynski]] and artist [[Esad Ribic]]. The first issue was released May 30, 2007 to coincide with the character's first movie appearance.<ref name="ssrequiemign">{{cite web

==Fictional character biography==
===Herald of Galactus===
[[Image:Toss.png‎|thumb|''The Silver Surfer''  #1 (Aug. 1968). Cover art by [[John Buscema]] and [[Joe Sinnott]].]]
The Silver Surfer was born Norrin Radd on the idyllic planet [[Zenn-La]] (in the [[Deneb]] System in the [[Milky Way]] [[galaxy]]).  His father is Jartan Radd, his mother Elmar Radd, and his half-brother Fennan Radd. All four are part of an ancient and significantly advanced civilization that has lost the will to strive or explore, leaving the young scholar Norrin Radd restless and yearning for something more than the idle pleasure pursued by his fellows. Faced suddenly with the total destruction of his world by planet-consuming [[Galactus]], Radd strikes a deal with the seemingly omnipotent space-god.  In return for the safety of Zenn-La and his lover, [[Shalla-Bal]], Radd pledges himself to serve as Galactus' [[Herald of Galactus|herald]] and to seek out other planets for the world devourer to feed on.  In striking this bargain, Radd also satisfies his long-held desire to adventure beyond the limiting world of his home. Accepting the young mortal's sacrifice, Galactus imbues him with a portion of the [[Power Cosmic]], transforming him into the Silver Surfer.<ref name="silversurfer1v1">''Silver Surfer #1'' (Aug. 1968)</ref> Radd proceeds to serve Galactus for an unspecified amount of time, unable to return to Zenn-La and Shalla-Bal. During this time, the Surfer tries to seek out uninhabited planets for the world-eater's attention, but as they became harder to find, Galactus tampers with the Surfer's conscience and removes this self-imposed restraint. Eventually, the Surfer arrives on Earth and, after deciding that the planet is ripe for Galactus' nourishment, summons his master.
<!-- In later versions of the story, it was explained that the Zenn-Lavians were an offshoot of the [[Kree]], a scientifically advanced, galaxy-spanning, alien race first created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in the [[Fantastic Four]]. Note: Please find references before putting this back. -->

Here the Surfer meets the [[Fantastic Four]], and [[Alicia Masters]]. Touched by their nobility, he chooses to rebel against Galactus and battled him in an attempt to prevent his master from consuming the planet. Galactus is eventually driven off, but as punishment for this rebellion he confines the Surfer to the planet with an invisible barrier that affects only him.<ref name="fantasticfour50">''Fantastic Four'' #48-50 (March-May 1966)</ref>

===Exiled to Earth===
Stories immediately following the Surfer's exile to Earth depict him as a semi-divine being, immeasurably powerful yet lacking the most basic understanding of good or evil. A completely [[Amorality|amoral]] entity, he develops a sense of compassion through contact with the gentle Alicia Masters, a blind sculptress capable of perceiving the Surfer's innate nobility.<ref name="fantasticfour48" /> This theme continues through a series of subplots wherein the Surfer encounters various negative human traits including [[jealousy]] (when [[Thing (comics)|The Thing]] is driven to rage by the Surfer's relationship with his girlfriend, Alicia), deception, evil, cruelty (de-powered and imprisoned by [[Doctor Doom]], then tortured by Doom's brutal henchmen), despair, hopelessness (languishing in a Latverian dungeon while Doom uses the Power Cosmic to conquer the world), and finally a thirst for revenge (destroying Doom's castle along with his sadistic captors when he finally escapes). At the same time, however, the Surfer continues to evolve as an individual, slowly groping his way to a knowledge of his own humanity.

[[Image:SilverSurfer3.jpg|199px|thumb|left|''The Silver Surfer'' #3 (Dec. 1968). Cover art by Buscema and Sinnott, depicting [[Shalla-Bal]] (in left hand of demon [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]).]]
During his exile, the Surfer fights numerous villains, including but not limited to Doctor Doom and [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]. Doom is obsessed with stealing the Surfer's Power Cosmic and finally does so, using it to defeat the Fantastic Four, only to lose it by colliding with Galactus' barrier.<ref name="fantasticfour72">''Fantastic Four'' #57 (Dec. 1966)</ref> Angry at the general disregard shown by humans, the Surfer attempts to bring about world peace by giving mankind a common enemy in himself, going so far as to declare war on humanity. He battles the Fantastic Four, but the [[Military of the United States|U.S. military]] strikes him down with an experimental power-draining "Sonic Shark" missile and forces him to resume his wanderings. <ref>''Fantastic Four'' #72</ref> The Surfer enters a "micro-world", pursued by the Fantastic Four, and locates a planet for Galactus to consume instead of Earth; he then resumes his exile.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #74-77</ref> The demonic [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] is persistent in trying to acquire the Surfer's soul by breaking his spirit, but Surfer's innate nobility thwarts him each time. The Surfer also does battle with [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] during his first encounter with Mephisto.<ref name="silversurfer3v1">''The Silver Surfer'' #3 (Dec. 1968)</ref> The Surfer's only ally during these trials is a physicist by the name of Al B. Harper, who eventually sacrifices himself to save the world from the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]].<ref name="silversurfer5v1">''The Silver Surfer'' #5 (April 1969)</ref> 

Banding together with [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]] during these wanderings, the Surfer forms the "Titans Three," a group dedicated to battling evil on Earth.<ref name="submariner34">''Sub-Mariner'' #34-35 (Feb.-March 1971)</ref> Soon, [[Doctor Strange]] joins the group and it becomes "the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]." Surfer stays with them for a while, but his overwhelming desire to be free of Earth and his frequent collisions with Galactus' energy-draining barrier eventually drives him to leave the group.  He has other encounters at this time, including being duped by Doctor Doom into turning against the Fantastic Four,<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #155-157 (February-April 1975)</ref> and encounters [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]].<ref>''Tomb of Dracula'' #50 (November 1976)</ref>

During this time in exile, the Surfer is reunited with Shalla-Bal on several occasions, but almost every time she appears as an unwilling pawn of his enemies, and he is invariably forced to let her go to save the planet.  During an Avengers-Defenders clash orchestrated by alien menaces [[Nebulon (comics)|Nebulon]] and Supernalia, the Surfer finally pierces Galactus' barrier with the aid of [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] and temporarily escapes Earth.  He discovers, though, that his home-world has been ravaged by Galactus and Shalla-Bal has been abducted by Mephisto and taken to Earth.  Even though it means trapping himself once more, the Surfer returns to Earth to battle and defeat Mephisto.  Before being vanquished, Mephisto sends Shalla-Bal back to Zenn-La, but the Surfer manages to endow her with a portion of his Power Cosmic, which she uses to revitalize the plant life of their ravaged home-world.<ref name="silversurfer1v2">''The Silver Surfer'' vol. 2, #1 (June 1978)</ref>

Alongside the Defenders once more, the Surfer journeys to the [[Earth-712|parallel Earth]] of the Squadron Supreme]], where he battles [[Null, the Living Darkness]] and the [[Overmind (comics)|Over-Mind]].<ref>''Defenders'' #112-114 (October-December 1982)</ref> The Surfer then aids the Fantastic Four against Galactus' latest herald, [[Terrax]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #260 (November 1983)</ref> The Surfer also helps the [[Molecule Man]] restore the damage done to Earth by the [[Beyonder]].<ref>''Avengers'' #266 (April 1986)</ref>

===Freedom From Exile===

After all this time in exile, the Surfer finally manages to pierce Galactus' barrier once and for all by acting on the Thing's simple suggestion of trying to pass through without his surfboard.  He also manages to make peace with Galactus by rescuing his current herald, [[Nova (Frankie Raye)]], from the [[Skrull]]s and encounters the [[Champion of the Universe|Champion]], after which Galactus finally declares the Surfer's long exile ended.<ref name="silversurfer1v3">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #1 (July 1987)</ref> He immediately revisits his home-world, but Shalla-Bal, in his absence, had become empress of the rejuvenated Zenn-La and hence unable to renew their romance.<ref name="silversurfer2v3">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #2 (Aug. 1987)</ref> 

Embroiled in fresh hostilities between the interstellar [[Kree]] and Skrull empires, the Surfer also intervenes in a series of plots by the [[Elders of the Universe]], who plan to become supremely powerful by destroying Galactus and the universe with him. The Surfer thwarts this plot with the aid of his new love interest, [[Mantis (Marvel Comics)|Mantis]], the Earth-born cosmic heroine also known as the "Celestial Madonna".<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 3 #4 (October 1987)</ref> She seems to die in the process, and although she eventually returns, she never fully renews their romances.<ref name="silversurfer9v3">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #9 (March 1988)</ref> After this loss, a grief-stricken Surfer turns to Nova and romantic feelings begin to develop between them.<ref name="silversurfer14v3">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #14 (Aug 1988)</ref> The Surfer's influence gradually leads Nova to question the morality of her role as herald to Galactus.<ref name="silversurfer51v3">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #51 (July 1991)</ref> Eventually replaced by the far more ruthless [[Morg]], Nova dies in a conflict between the new herald and the Surfer and the other ex-heralds.<ref name="silversurfer75v3">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #75 (Dec. 1992)</ref>

[[Image:Silversurfervolume3.jpg‎|199px|''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #1 (July 1987). Cover art by [[Marshall Rogers]] and [[Josef Rubinstein]].|thumb]]
The Surfer, during this period, first encounters [[Thanos]], a death-worshipping mutant of the race the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]],<ref name="silversurfer34v3">''Silver Surfer'' #34 (Feb. 1990)</ref> and first meets [[Adam Warlock]].<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 3 #46 (February 1991)</ref> The Surfer repeatedly battles other space-born menaces, the chief of whom is Thanos, who wipes out half the life in the universe using the omnipotent [[Infinity Gauntlet]].<ref name="InfinityGauntlet1">''Infinity Gauntlet'' #1 (July 1991)</ref> The Surfer also finds interstellar allies in Adam Warlock's [[Infinity Watch]], forms the short-lived "Star Masters" team, and begins attending occasional Defenders reunions.  During his travels, the Surfer also meets his long-lost half-brother, Fennan Radd, to whom Shalla-Bal has become married.<ref name="silversurfer101v3">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #101 (Feb. 1995)</ref> 

In one of his adventures, the Surfer discovers the way in which Galactus tampered with his mind and soul during his time as herald.<ref name="silversurfer48v3">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #48 (April 1991)</ref> Further aspects of his past life are also revealed, including the fact that he saw his mother's dead body after she slit her own wrists<ref name="silversurfer57v3">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #57 (Oct. 1991)</ref> and that his father, a prominent scientist, was accused of having plagiarized and shot himself in response to Norrin's disappointment.<ref name="silversurfer50v3">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #50 (June 1991)</ref> During the ''Infinity Gauntlet'' saga, the Surfer eventually confronts these memories and comes to forgive himself.<ref name="silversurfer58v3">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #58 (Nov. 1991)</ref> 

The Surfer eventually returns home to Zenn-La to find that the planet has vanished, and learns it was actually destroyed in the 1940s (Earth time) by the entity known as the Other. Zenn-La and its people which the Surfer repeatedly encountered since leaving Galactus' service were actually reproductions, created by Galactus so that the Surfer would have a home to return to.<ref name="silversurfer130v3">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #130 (Aug. 1997)</ref>  Losing his capacity for emotion again, the Surfer returns to Earth. He later regains his personality during a time-travel adventure and sharing a romance with Alicia Masters.<ref name="silversurfer129v3">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #129 (June 1997)</ref> The two ultimately part as friends after many adventures together. 

After the Fantastic Four were resurrected in the aftermath of the [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught crisis]] and their return from the [[Heroes Reborn]] universe, the Surfer came to Earth to welcome them home, but ended up joining [[Spider-Man]] in his latest battle against [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]]. During this fight, the Carnage symbiote briefly managed to take over the Surfer, but the Surfer was able to expel the symbiote, trapping Carnage in an unbreakable prison where he would be forced to reflect upon his sins for all eternity <ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #430 to #431</ref> (although he later escaped under as-yet-undisclosed circumstances).  The return of the heroes caused the shattering of the [[Nexus of All Realities]]<ref>''Man-Thing'' vol. 3 #2</ref>, and one of the fragments landed on a dead world and started bringing it to life.  The Surfer fought [[Man-Thing]], possessed by the spirit of K'Ad-mon of the Fallen Stars, in order to save the newly formed world, but was defeated, and the Nexus piece was reclaimed by Man-Thing. <ref>''Strange Tales'' vol. 4 #1</ref> 

When a [[Gaea (Marvel Comics)|Gaea]]-powered curse from a dying [[Yandroth]] mystically forces Surfer, Namor, Hulk, and Strange to assemble in response to any and all threats to the Earth, the ongoing stress coupled with the curse's subtle emotional influence gradually drive the four senior Defenders mad, and they attempt to conquer the world as "[[The Order (comics)|the Order]]" in the belief that this is the most efficient way to protect the planet. Their fellow Defenders [[Patsy Walker|Hellcat]], [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Nighthawk]], [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]], and [[Clea]] team up with other heroes – including Ardina, a cosmic-powered woman they mystically create from a portion of the Surfer's own energy – to oppose the Order and return them to their senses, just in time to prevent the curse from rendering a resurrected Yandroth all-powerful.{{issue}}

In the 2003 ''Silver Surfer'' series, the Surfer works with the alien Annunaki race to gather and protect some of Earth's most extraordinarily gifted children.<ref name="silversurfer1v4">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 4, #1 (March 2004)</ref> In the end, one of these children, Ellie Waters, saves Earth from the godlike [[Marduk]] entity, preventing the apocalypse and reordering reality as if the Marduk crisis had never happened (though Ellie alone apparently retains her memories of these events).<ref name="silversurfer1v4">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 4, #12 (Oct. 2004)</ref> The Surfer then resumes his interstellar wanderings, but promises to be ready to aid his adopted home-world should Earth ever need him.

===Planet Hulk/Silver Savage===
During his travels, Surfer was captured by a portal of the Planet Sakaar Empire. Left weakened and vulnerable by his trip through the portal, the Surfer was subdued and implanted with an obedience disk to ensure he remained loyal to them. Fighting as a gladiator (and believed to be the fabled 'Sakaarson' due to his appearance), the Surfer was finally forced to face the Hulk along with his [[Warbound]]. Through teamwork and distraction, the Hulk was eventually able to destroy the Surfer's obedience disk. The Hulk and several other slaves and gladiators were freed when the Surfer used the Power Cosmic to remove their own obedience disks and give them a way out of the arena, although the Hulk declines the Surfer's offer to take him back to Earth.<ref>[[Greg Pak]], ''The Incredible Hulk'' #95</ref>

===Annihilation===
{{Main|Annihilation (comics)}}
He later joins other [[herald of Galactus|heralds of Galactus]] against the forces of the Annihilation Wave, and becomes Galactus' herald once more, to help save the universe from the despot [[Annihilus]], and two proemial beings called "Tenebrous, of The Darkness Between" and "[[Aegis (Lady of All Sorrows)|Aegis, Lady of All Sorrows]]".<ref>''Annihilation: Silver Surfer'' #1-4 (June- Sept. 2006)</ref> They defeat and capture the duo, and give them to [[Annihilus]] and the alien mastermind [[Thanos]] for experimentation. Thanos learns of Annihilus' more nefarious goals and attempts to free Galactus, but before he can do so, Thanos is killed by [[Drax the Destroyer]]. When Drax discovers Thanos' plan, he frees the Surfer, who in turn frees Galactus. An enraged Galactus destroys more than half the Annihilation Wave, allowing a group called the United Front to defeat Annihilus.<ref>''[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]'' #1-6 (Oct. 2006 - March 2007)</ref> The Surfer tracks down Aegis and Tenebrous, and when completely outmatched, maneuvers them into entering [[Antimatter#Antiuniverse|The Crunch]], the all-destroying border of the universe, whereupon he fully returns to his role as Galactus' herald, now partnered with [[Stardust (Marvel Comics)|Stardust]].<ref>''Annihilation: Heralds of Galactus'' #1-2 (April-May 2007)</ref>. During this time he was empowered further by Galactus <ref>Annihilation: Silver Surfer #1-4 (June-Sept 2006)</ref>, making him the most powerful [[Herald of Galactus]].

The Silver Surfer wields the [[Power Cosmic]], giving him superhuman strength and stamina and making him virtually indestructible for practical purposes; he can still be injured or even killed by beings who equal or exceed his own power-level, such as [[Morg]] or [[Thanos]]. The Power Cosmic absorbs and allows him to manipulate the universe's cosmic energy for a variety of effects.

When Galactus exiled the Surfer to Earth, his means of imprisonment was linked to the board.  When Surfer and the [[Fantastic Four]] realized this, Surfer put it to the test by leaving the board planet-side and entering space in the Four's spacecraft. Once he was free of Earth, the Surfer remotely converted the board to energy, recalled it to him, and reformed it in space.<ref name="silversurfer1v3" />

Norrin Radd also possesses some knowledge of the advanced alien technology of the planet Zenn-La.

===Ultimate Silver Surfer===
[[Image:UltimateSilversurferFF43.jpg‎|200px|''[[Ultimate Fantastic Four]]'' #43 (Aug. 2007). Cover art by [[Pasqual Ferry]]|thumb]]

[[Warren Ellis]]'s [[Ultimate Galactus Trilogy]] originally suggested that [[The Ultimates]]' ally the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] was the herald of Galactus, a robotic probe that travels through space warning civilizations of the impending arrival of [[Galactus#Ultimate Gah Lak Tus|Gah Lak Tus]]. In the final mini-series of the trilogy, ''[[Ultimate Galactus Trilogy#Ultimate Extinction|Ultimate Extinction]]'', silvery humanoids began to appear, sent to trigger mass suicides in order to reduce the population's resistance. Suicide cults founded by the creatures began to appear all across the globe as Gah Lak Tus drew near. These silvery beings had the ability to grow wings, morph into an [[oval|ovoid]], form spikes like the [[T-1000]] or take an intermediary form, gliding on an oval surface. They also demonstrated the ability to manipulate large quantities of energy.  All these traits are reminiscent of the Surfer, but their official name is the Silver Men or Silver Wings{{Fact|date=March 2008}}.

In ''[[Ultimate Fantastic Four]]'' #42, another Ultimate incarnation of the Silver Surfer appears, called the '''Silver Searcher'''. He is teleported to Earth after Reed mistakes him for a star that he is trying to harness. His appearance triggers planet-wide chaos and natural calamities. In #43, Reed comments that Gah Lak Tus seems to have modeled its drones on this surfer, and he gives his name as Norin Radd. The Searcher states that he will summon his "master", who will make the population of the Earth happier than they have ever been.<ref name="ultimateff43">''Ultimate Fantastic Four'' #43 (May 2007)</ref>

In #44, the Surfer's master is revealed to be Zenn-La's ruler, Revka Temerlune Edifex Scyros III, "the king without enemies", who uses mind-control to make the population of Earth worship him (before it takes effect on the Fantastic Four, the Human Torch calls him "[[Psycho-Man]]"). It is revealed that the Surfer has been exiled from Zenn-La for destroying the control that Psycho-Man had over Zenn-la, but because of finding Earth for his master to "save" he may return. After Psycho-Man gains domain over Earth, the Silver Surfer, temporarily imprisoned in his own 'memorial' statue, rescues Mr. Fantastic, tells him his story, and asks him to save Earth. The Surfer then helps the Fantastic Four defeat other Surfer-like assassins of Psycho-Man. With the Surfers beaten and the insane Psycho-Man reprogrammed to experience the unthinking happiness he had imposed on others, Silver Surfer wanders the space ways.

In [[Ultimate X-Men]], [[Jean Grey#Ultimate Jean Grey/Marvel Girl|Jean Grey]] as [[Phoenix (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Phoenix]] travels through space and is stopped by what is named as "A Silver Surfer". He informs Phoenix that the [[Watcher (comics)|The Watchers]] disapprove of the problems her flight across the universe is causing and briefly battles her before asking what she is looking for. <ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #96 (July 2008)</ref>

===Carnage Cosmic===
The Silver Surfer bonds with the [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]] [[symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] in two issues of ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', gaining the name "[[Carnage Cosmic]]".  He looks like the original Carnage from the [[Spider-Man]] comics, but still has the trademark surfboard of the Silver Surfer. In the first issue, the Carnage Symbiote leaves Cletus Kasady, seeing the Surfer as an even more powerful being by comparison. After the symbiote completes merging to the Surfer, he immediately rampages as a side effect to the two entities conflicting with each other. The Carnage Cosmic then flies off into outer space. Cletus Kasady, "symbiote-less," is taken to the hospital for the immense pain he suffers as a result of the separation (this is revealed to be the result of an advanced case of stomach cancer the symbiote had been guarding him from).{{issue}} As Carnage Cosmic drifts along in space, the symbiote recants memories from Kasady and itself to Norrin Radd (the Surfer's former self). Radd sees how the symbiote remembers the Surfer summoning his master, Galactus, to the planet to consume it. Then the Surfer is shown memories of Kasady's abusive youth. The Surfer breaks free realizing what he must do. He returns to Earth as the Carnage Cosmic. After a brief roof-top battle with Spider-Man, the mismatched pair searches the city finding Kasady in the hospital, still screaming in pain. Upon immediately seeing Kasady, the symbiote re-bonds with Kasady, but to ensure Carnage will never hurt any one else again, The Surfer encases Carnage in an unbreakable shell of ethereal energy. <ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 1 #431</ref>.

In a ''[[What If (comics)|What If?]]'' storyline, the symbiote remained bonded to the Surfer, forcing Spider-Man and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] to battle him until [[Firestar]] was able to use her powers to disrupt the symbiote's control over the Surfer. After his powers were used to destroy dozens of New York City blocks and realizing that there was only one way to stop the symbiote, the Silver Surfer flew himself into the sun, destroying both himself and the creature.<ref>''What If?'' vol. 2 #108</ref>.

===Exiles===
On Earth 552, Norrin Radd had been a great military scientist who accidentally destroyed his own world with his greatest invention. Determined to bring it back to existence, he approached Galactus, Restorer of Worlds, and became his herald in the hope that Galactus would resurrect his world in exchange for his service. However, Galactus had taken an oath to only revive those worlds destroyed by the Blight. An enraged Silver Surfer then turned against his master, destroying those who worshiped him and attempting to kill Galactus himself in order to steal the knowledge of world restoration. This led to the destruction of Earth, the coming of the Exiles, the deaths of the Shi'ar Imperial Elite Guard, and inevitably the Surfer's own destruction at the claws of a cosmically empowered Sabretooth.<ref name="exiles87">{{cite web

===Marvel Zombies=== 
The Silver Surfer is a victim of the ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'' in that continuity. Instead of coming to Earth and meeting the Fantastic Four, he is attacked by a horde of zombies.  After fighting valiantly, he is killed by the Zombie Hulk, and his body is devoured by a few of the zombies (Hulk, Colonel America, Giant-Man, Iron Man, Luke Cage, Wolverine, and Spider-Man). His corpse grants the zombies his cosmic powers, which they use to kill all of the other zombie heroes and villains. Afterwards, they use the powers to kill and eat Galactus before learning they can fly and survive in space, allowing them to prey on the rest of the universe.<ref name="marvelzombies5">''Marvel Zombies'' #5'' (April 2006)</ref>

===MC2===
During the finale of ''[[Last Planet Standing]]'', the Silver Surfer foils Galactus' plan to create a new Big Bang, merging with Galactus himself in the process to become a new being. Gaining control of Galactus' powers, the new entity undoes the damage done by the old Galactus.<ref name="lastplanetstanding5">''Last Planet Standing'' #5 (July 2006)</ref>

===The Keeper===
In the [[alternate history|alternate timeline]] of Earth-691, notably the [[Guardians of the Galaxy]] issues #24 and #25 story arc, Norrin Radd was featured as The Keeper. This new version of the Silver Surfer sans his surfboard had [[Quasar (comics)#Quantum bands|Quantum Bands]], which augmented his "Power Cosmic" and designated him as the Protector of the Universe, as with other bearers of the Bands before him. He works with the Guardians in an attempt to kill Galactus once and for all, his first attempt with Firelord and Dargo-Thor having failed.  Eventually, the Keeper realizes that, with his augmented power, he can supply Galactus with the energy he needs and end the Planet-Eater's consumption of worlds.  [[Eon (comics)|Eon]], cosmic being and creator of the Quantum Bands, reveals that this was the ultimate purpose of the Keeper becoming the Protector of the Universe, and he enters into a symbiotic partnership with Galactus, who accepts the Keeper as an equal; he is last seen leaving with Galactus, riding a silver surfboard once more.

===Earth X/Universe X/Paradise X===
In issue 11 and 12 of the ''[[Earth X]]'' series, Black Bolt calls upon Galactus to come destroy the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]] seed growing within Earth.  The Silver Surfer accompanies him along with his love Shalla-Bal, who had now been turned into a silver herald of Galactus as well.

===Elseworlds===
In Silver Surfer/Green Lantern, the Silver Surfer confronts Cyborg Superman over the destruction of a planet and is met by Parallax. Parallax beats the Cyborg, but the Silver Surfer lets him go and tries to sympathize with Parallax. The two return to Earth to find Kyle Rayner with Thanos, leading them to believe they formed an alliance. Kyle convinces the Surfer to help him stop Parallax and Thanos from destroying the universe and that he was duped into giving Thanos Oa's power. The Surfer was similarly gave most of his power to Parallax to reform the destroyed planet. Kyle channels the power from the two villains into the Silver Surfer, who opens a portal and sucks the two inside.

===Amalgam Comics===
In this universe, where a part of the Marvel multiverse was fused with part of the DC multiverse, the Silver Surfer is fused with [[Black Racer]] of the New Gods to become the [[Silver Racer]] (with the former's silver coating and the latter's cosmic skis). In one story, ''Dr. Doomsday'' (Dr. Doom + Doomsday) stole the Racer's cosmic skis and went on a rampage, only to be beat by the ''Challengers of the Fantastic'' (Fantastic Four + Challengers of the Unknown).{{issue}}

===Television===
{{main|Silver Surfer (TV series)}}
[[Image:surfertoon.jpg|200px|thumb|The Silver Surfer from the ''[[Silver Surfer (TV series)|Silver Surfer animated series]]''.]]

The Surfer's first animated appearance was in "Galactus," an episode of the [[Hanna-Barbera]] 1967 ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' animated series, which closely followed the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] comic story.<ref name="1967cog">{{cite web

He also made several appearances in the [[Fantastic Four (1994 TV series)|1994 version]] of the animated series (that was part of [[The Marvel Action Hour]]) voiced by [[Robin Sachs]] in the first season, then [[Edward Albert]] in the last episode of the second. This series also adhered closely to the original comic book story, recounting Surfer and Galactus' coming to Earth in a two-part episode as well as Doctor Doom's theft of Surfer's powers.<ref name="1994cog">{{cite web

In 1998, the Surfer starred in a [[Silver Surfer (TV series)|solo animated series]] on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX Network]], voiced by Paul Essiembre.  Blending [[cel-shaded animation|cel]] and [[computer animation]], this series was rendered in the style of Surfer creator [[Jack Kirby]] but diverged from the comic in various ways. Although it accurately depicted the Surfer's origin on Zenn-La, the method by which he regained his emotions and memories was altered to not involve the Fantastic Four.  Further adventures included appearances by many characters from Marvel's "cosmic" stable, including [[Thanos]], the [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]], [[Ego the Living Planet]], Mentor, [[Drax the Destroyer]], [[Pip the Troll]], [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]], and the [[Kree]] and [[Skrull]] empires, their portrayals and roles often differing from their comic book incarnations. Possessed of an unusually serious tone compared to Marvel's other animated projects, with frequent maudlin musings by the Surfer and episode resolutions which were often downbeat. It received good rating, but was canceled after only one season of thirteen episodes due to politics between [[Toy Biz]] and [[Saban Entertainment]]. The series ending on a cliffhanger. Eight further episodes for the next season were written but never animated. The Comic Book of the Silver Surfer also appeared in an episode of [[List of Heroes episodes#Season 1: 2006-2007|Heroes Season 1]].<ref name="ssscripts">{{cite web

===Film===
{{main|Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer|Fantastic Four (film series)#Silver Surfer spin-off}}
[[Image:Surfermovie3.jpg‎|200px|thumb|left|The Silver Surfer in ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]'' (2007).]]
A ''Silver Surfer'' film had been long in development since the 1980s. The Silver Surfer made his film debut in [[20th Century Fox]]'s ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]],'' the sequel to the 2005 film ''[[Fantastic Four (film)|Fantastic Four]].'' [[Doug Jones (actor)|Doug Jones]] played the Surfer on set, and a computer simulation enhanced the reflective look of his prosthetics.<ref>{{cite news | author = Thomas J. McLean  | title = Fantastic 4: Weta Gives Rise to the Silver Surfer | publisher = VFXWorld | date = [[2007-06-21]] | url = http://www.vfxworld.com/?atype=articles&id=3325&page=1 | accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref> [[Laurence Fishburne]] provided the character's voice. Assured of the film's commercial success, 20th Century Fox hired [[J. Michael Straczynski]] to write the screenplay for a [[Fantastic Four film series#Future|spin-off film]]. Straczynski said his script is a sequel, but will also delve into the Surfer's origins.<ref>{{cite news | author = Chris Carle | title = SDCC 07: JMS Sheds Light on Silver Surfer Movie | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = [[2007-07-27]] | url = http://movies.ign.com/articles/808/808908p1.html | accessdate=2007-10-07}}</ref> Recently, he said it may not happen. <ref>[http://www.beyondhollywood.com/straczynski-talks-silver-surfer-it-probably-aint-gonna-happen/ Straczynski Talks Silver Surfer: It Probably Ain’t Gonna Happen | BeyondHollywood.com | Asian, Foreign, Horror, and Genre Movie Reviews and News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In this continuity, the Surfer's origins are highly similar to that of his comic-book incarnation, in that he agreed to become [[Galactus]]' herald in return for the safety of his home-world and the woman he loved. The movie incarnation differs from his comics counterpart in that instead of having innate power (the [[Power Cosmic]]), his power comes from the surfboard itself, which also serves as a beacon for Galactus. After [[Doctor Doom]] renders him unconscious, he steals the board. The Fantastic Four free the Surfer from imprisonment to help them defeat Doom. Doom throws a cosmic spear at the Surfer to kill him, but [[Invisible Woman|Sue Storm]] steps in and saves him. She tries to use her force fields to block the spear, but it passes through the field and impales Sue. The Surfer then decides to follow his heart and turn on Galactus after he witnesses Sue dying in Reed's arms. Upon reuniting with the board, the Surfer brings Sue back to life and then goes off to destroy Galactus, appearing to implode when he does. At the end of the film, Surfer is floating aimlessly through space, with his board in the background. As he drifts off screen, his eyes open and his board flies towards him.

In promotion for the film, the [[Franklin Mint]], a collectibles marketer, altered 40,000 [[50 State Quarters|California quarters]] by putting the Silver Surfer on the reverse.<ref>[http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/national/1110AP_Silver_Surfer_Coin.html Silver Surfer Coin]</ref> The [[United States Mint]], upon discovering this, informed the studio and the Franklin Mint that it is illegal to turn a coin into advertising media, and violators can face a fine.<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18873168/ Associated Press (May 29, 2007): "'Silver Surfer' coin steams U.S. Mint"]</ref>

===Video Games===
* The ''[[Silver Surfer (video game)|Silver Surfer]]'' video game, developed by [[Software Creations (UK)|Software Creations]], Ltd., debuted on the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] in 1990. The game is notorious for its unforgiving and extremely steep difficulty.<ref name="ssvg">{{cite web

* He is a bonus character in the game ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'' voiced by [[Chris Cox (actor)|Chris Cox]]. He can be unlocked by completing all Comic Book Missions or by entering a cheat code. His optional costumes (all identical) are Power Surge, Silver Age, Vitality, and Heavy Damage.<ref name="ssmua">{{cite web

* The Surfer most recently appeared in the [[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer (video game)|video game adaptation]] of the movie, developed by [[Visual Concepts]] of 2K Sports. It was released in June 2007 to coincide with the film's release to dismal reviews.<ref name="ff4rotssvgame">{{cite web

He also makes a brief cameo in the original Spider-Man videogame. If the player has Debug mode on during the helicopter chase scene, then there will be a blimp with Spiderman on it to jump to instead of going through the whole level. This leads to a brief bonus level where Spider-Man is standing on the blimp, and must avoid the helicopter's machine guns till the level ends. In the beginning of said level, the Silver Surfer is seen flying by.

===Stamps===
The [[United States Postal Service]] in November 2007, released a series of $0.41 stamps honoring Marvel comics. One stamp shows the Silver Surfer on his board and another shows the first eponymous issue.<ref>http://shop.usps.com/wcsstore/PostalStore/upload/images/600x600_461440.jpg</ref> Associated paraphernalia (e.g., first day covers) were also available.

===Cultural References===
Numerous films, songs, books and television shows have referenced the Silver Surfer since his 1960s debut. In the [[1983 in film|1983]] film ''[[Breathless (1983 film)|Breathless]]'', [[Richard Gere]]'s character was an avid fan of his comics. In [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s [[1992 in film|1992]] ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]'' a Silver Surfer poster is clearly seen in Mr. Orange's apartment. In [[Futurama Comics]], [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]] accidentally deactivates the autopilot of the Planet Express ship, causing the ship to fly out of control, knock the Silver Surfer off his board, then enter a [[Space Invaders]] video game style battle. In the [[1995 in film|1995]] film ''[[Crimson Tide (film)|Crimson Tide]]'', two submarine crew members argue over the merits of the alternate Silver Surfer versions as drawn by Kirby and Moebius<ref>{{cite web

Musician [[Joe Satriani]] included the character on the cover of his [[1987 in music|1987]] album, ''[[Surfing with the Alien]]''. The following year a planet was named Satriani after him on ''Silver Surfer vol. 3, #13''. In one of his subsequent albums, ''[[Flying in a Blue Dream]]'', there is a track titled "Back to Shalla-Bal." Satriani's [[2000 in music|2000]] album, ''[[Engines of Creation (album)|Engines of Creation]]'', also includes a song called "The Power Cosmic." In the song, "Last of the New Wave Riders," from [[Utopia (band)|Utopia]]'s ''[[Adventures in Utopia]]'', the final line (bracketed as an aside) is "here comes that Silver Surfer now." [[symphonic metal|Symphonic]] [[black metal]] band [[Bal-Sagoth]] featured "The Scourge of the Fourth Celestial Host," a track about the Silver Surfer, on their aptly titled album, ''[[The Power Cosmic]]''. On the solo album, ''Accident of Birth'', from [[Iron Maiden (band)|Iron Maiden]] front man [[Bruce Dickinson]], in the song "Darkside of Aquarius", the song ends with the line, 'From the starlite sky, on a silver sea. A lonely Silver Surfer comes to push the wheel for me.'

The [[Blue Man Group]] have also cited the Silver Surfer as part of the inspiration for their image, as he is one of the few bald superheroes in existence while presenting a clear image of power.{{fact|date=November 2008}}
