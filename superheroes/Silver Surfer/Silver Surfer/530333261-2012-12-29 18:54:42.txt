The '''Silver Surfer''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]] created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]]. The character [[first appearance|first appears]] in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #48 (March 1966), the first of a three-issue arc that fans call "[[The Galactus Trilogy]]".<ref>Thomas, Roy, ''Stan Lee's Amazing Marvel Universe'' (Sterling Publishing, New York, 2006), "Moment 29: The Galactus Trilogy", pp. 112-115.

Originally, '''Norrin Radd''', a young [[astronomer]] of the planet [[Zenn-La]], made a bargain with the cosmic entity [[Galactus]], pledging to serve as his [[herald]] in order to save his homeworld from destruction.

Galactus also created for Radd a [[surfboard]]-like craft — modeled after a childhood fantasy of his —  on which he would travel at speeds beyond that of [[light]]. Known from then on as the Silver Surfer, Radd began to roam the [[cosmos]] searching for new planets for Galactus to consume.  When his travels finally took him to [[Earth]], the Surfer came face-to-face with the [[Fantastic Four]], a team of powerful superheroes that helped him to rediscover his nobility of spirit. Betraying Galactus, the Surfer saved Earth but was punished in return by being [[exile]]d there.<ref name="fantasticfour48">''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #48 (March 1966)</ref> In 2011, [[IGN]] ranked Silver Surfer 41st in its "Top 100 Comic Heroes" list.

==Publication history==
===Early appearances===
The Silver Surfer debuted as an unplanned addition to the [[superhero]]-team comic ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #48 (March 1966). The comic's writer-editor, [[Stan Lee]], and its [[penciller]] and co-plotter, [[Jack Kirby]], had by the mid-1960s developed a collaborative technique known as the "[[Marvel Method]]": the two would discuss story ideas, Kirby would work from a brief synopsis to draw the individual scenes and plot details, and Lee would finally add the dialog and captions. When Kirby turned in his pencil art for the story, he included a new character he and Lee had not discussed.<ref name="Markstein">{{cite web

''Kirby: King of Comics'' ([[Harry N. Abrams]], New York, 2008), p. 141</ref> Kirby explained that the story's agreed-upon [[antagonist]], a god-like cosmic [[predation|predator]] of planets named [[Galactus]], should have some sort of [[herald]], and that he created the surfboard "because I'm tired of drawing spaceships!"<ref name="theultimatesilversurfer">Quoted in Lee, ''The Ultimate Silver Surfer''</ref> Taken by the noble features of the new character, who turned on his master to help defend Earth, Lee overcame his initial skepticism and began adding characterization. The Silver Surfer soon became a key part of the unfolding story.<ref name="Markstein"/>

Following the Surfer's debut, Lee and Kirby brought him back as a recurring guest in ''Fantastic Four'' #55-61, 72, and 74-77 (ranging Oct. 1966 - Aug. 1968). The character made his solo debut in the backup story of  ''Fantastic Four Annual'' #5 (Nov. 1967).

The following year, Lee launched the solo title ''The Silver Surfer''. [[John Buscema]] was penciller for the first 17 issues of the series, with Kirby returning for the 18th and final issue. The first seven issues, which included anthological "Tales of the Watcher" backup stories, were 72-page (with advertising), 25-cent "giants", as opposed to the typical 36-page, 12-cent comics of the time. Thematically, the stories dealt with the Surfer's exile on Earth and the inhumanity of man as observed by this noble yet fallen hero. Though short-lived, the series became known as one of Lee's most thoughtful and introspective works.<ref name="silversurfer2v3backcover">Marvel Comics writer [[Steve Englehart]], for example, in his back-cover text for ''The Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #2 (Aug. 1987), wrote that Buscema and Lee were "pouring their souls into the series".</ref>

Following his series' cancellation, the Surfer made sporadic appearances as a guest star or [[antagonist]] in such comic books as ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'', ''[[Defenders (comics)|The Defenders]]'', and ''Fantastic Four''. Lee remained partial to the Surfer, and with Kirby collaborated on a seminal 1978 [[graphic novel]] starring the character, the only original story featured in the [[Marvel Fireside Books]] series.

===Subsequent series===
{{unreferenced|section|date=February 2012}}
After a 1982 [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] by writer-artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] (with scripting by Stan Lee), the Surfer appeared in his second solo, ongoing [[Silver Surfer, volume 3|title]] in 1987.

Initially written by [[Steve Englehart]], the series was to be set on Earth and one issue was completed under this premise before Marvel agreed to let Englehart remove the long-standing restriction regarding Silver Surfer being imprisoned on Earth. This first issue was shelved and a brand new first issue was written, to set up this plot twist; the original first issue would ultimately be reprinted in Marvel Fanfare #51. 

Englehart introduced many villains for Silver Surfer, as well as featured space politics involving Surfer's homeworld Zenn-La, which was caught in the middle of a renewed Kree-Skrull War. However, issues regarding Englehart wanting to use his Avengers character Mantis as Silver Surfer's companion, as well as editorial refusing to let him use Thanos or other concepts conceived by Jim Starlin, led Englehart to leave the book with issue #31. Ironically, Jim Starlin would take over as writer with issue #34 after several fill-in issues and incorporate Thanos, Adam Warlock, and Drax the Destroyer into the series.  

Under Starlin and later Ron Marz, the series would receive acclaim and sales boost due to Silver Surfer's involvement with Starlin's Infinity Trilogy, with [[George Pérez]] and [[J. M. DeMatteis]] also having brief writing stints on the series as well. Additional artists included [[Tom Grindberg]], [[Ron Garney]], and [[Jon J. Muth]], as well as periodic guest spots by the aforementioned [[John Buscema]]. The title experienced great initial success which allowed Marvel to push the character into other media, including a 1990 video game, 1992 trading card set, and 1998 animated series, as well as spinning off a variety of other comics series including ''Cosmic Powers'', ''Cosmic Powers Unlimited'', ''Captain Marvel'' vol. 2, and ''Star Masters''. It ran 146 issues, through 1998. The next year it was followed by the two-issue miniseries, ''Silver Surfer: Loftier Than Mortals''.

A two-issue ''Silver Surfer'' miniseries (later collected as ''Silver Surfer: Parable''), scripted by Lee and drawn by [[Jean Giraud|Moebius]], was published through Marvel's [[Epic Comics]] imprint in 1988 and 1989.  Because of inconsistencies with other stories, it has been argued that these stories actually feature an alternate Silver Surfer from a parallel Earth.<ref>{{cite web

===2000s===
A new ongoing Silver Surfer series began in 2003, focusing on the character's alien nature and messianic allegory. It lasted 14 issues. The Surfer later appeared in an issue of ''[[Cable & Deadpool]]'' and has been reunited three times with the superhero group the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. In 2006-2007, he starred in the four-issue miniseries ''[[Annihilation (comics)#Annihilation: Silver Surfer|Annihilation: Silver Surfer]]'' and co-starred in the miniseries  ''[[Annihilation (comics)#Annihilation: Heralds of Galactus|Heralds of Galactus]]'', both part of the ''[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]'' [[fictional crossover]].

In 2007, the Silver Surfer starred in a four-issue miniseries ''Silver Surfer: Requiem'' by writer [[J. Michael Straczynski]] and artist Esad Ribic. The first issue was released May 30, 2007 to coincide with the character's first movie appearance.<ref name="ssrequiemign">{{cite web

Norrin Radd is from the utopian planet [[Zenn-La]], in the [[Deneb]] star system of the [[Milky Way]] [[galaxy]].  He is the son of Jartan and Elmar Radd, and he has a half-brother, Fennan Radd.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol 3 #50</ref><ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol 3 #56</ref><ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol 3 #104</ref> Zenn-La's ancient and significantly advanced civilization has lost the will to strive or explore, leaving the young scholar Norrin Radd restless and yearning for adventure. Facing the destruction of his world by planet-consuming [[Galactus]], Radd bargains with the cosmic being. In return for the safety of Zenn-La and his lover, [[Shalla-Bal]], Radd pledges to seek out planets for the world devourer to consume as his [[Herald of Galactus|herald]].

Radd serves Galactus for an unspecified amount of time. Eventually, the Surfer summons his master to Earth. Here the Surfer meets the [[Fantastic Four]] and [[Alicia Masters]]. Touched by their nobility, he rebels against Galactus, who is eventually driven off. Before he leaves, he confines the Surfer to Earth with an invisible barrier that affects only him.<ref name="fantasticfour50">''Fantastic Four'' #48-50 (March–May 1966)</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Brian |last=Cronin |url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/02/19/a-year-of-cool-comics-day-50/ |title=A Year of Cool Comics – Day 50 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] CSBG Archive |date=February 19, 2010|accessdate=September 29, 2010 }}</ref>

During his exile, the Surfer fights numerous villains, including Doctor Doom, who wants his Power Cosmic, and [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], who wants his soul. The Surfer's only ally during these trials is a physicist by the name of Al B. Harper, who eventually sacrifices himself to save the world from the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]].<ref name="silversurfer5v1">''The Silver Surfer'' #5 (April 1969)</ref>

Banding together with the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]] during these wanderings, the Surfer forms the "Titans Three," a group dedicated to battling evil on Earth.<ref name="submariner34">''Sub-Mariner'' #34-35 (Feb.-March 1971)</ref> Soon, [[Doctor Strange]] joins the group and it becomes "The [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]." Surfer stays with them for a while, but his overwhelming desire to be free of Earth and his frequent collisions with Galactus' energy-draining barrier eventually drives him to leave the group.

The Surfer finally pierces Galactus' barrier with the aid of [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] and temporarily escapes Earth. He discovers, though, that his homeworld has been ravaged by Galactus and Shalla-Bal has been abducted by Mephisto and taken to Earth. Even though it means trapping himself once more, the Surfer returns to Earth to battle and defeat Mephisto. Before being vanquished, Mephisto sends Shalla-Bal back to Zenn-La, but the Surfer manages to endow her with a portion of his Power Cosmic, which she uses to revitalize the plant life of their ravaged homeworld.<ref name="silversurfer1v2">''The Silver Surfer'' vol. 2, #1 (June 1978)</ref>

After the Surfer aids the Fantastic Four against Galactus' latest herald, [[Terrax]],<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #260 (November 1983)</ref> Surfer finally manages to pierce Galactus' barrier by acting on the Thing's suggestion of trying to pass through on a spaceship instead of via his own power on his surfboard.  He also manages to make peace with Galactus by rescuing his current herald, [[Nova (Frankie Raye)]], from the [[Skrull]]s and encounters the [[Champion of the Universe|Champion]], after which Galactus finally declares the Surfer's long exile ended.<ref name="silversurfer1v3">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #1 (July 1987)</ref> He immediately revisits his homeworld, but Shalla-Bal, in his absence, had become empress of the rejuvenated Zenn-La and hence unable to renew their romance.<ref name="silversurfer2v3">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #2 (Aug. 1987)</ref>

Embroiled in fresh hostilities between the interstellar [[Kree]] and Skrull empires, the Surfer also intervenes in a series of plots by the [[Elders of the Universe]], who plan to become supremely powerful by destroying Galactus and the universe with him. The Surfer thwarts this plot with the aid of his new love interest, [[Mantis (Marvel Comics)|Mantis]], the Earth-born cosmic heroine also known as the "Celestial Madonna".<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 3 #4 (October 1987)</ref> She seems to die in the process, and although she eventually returns, she never fully renews their romances.<ref name="silversurfer9v3">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #9 (March 1988)</ref> After this loss, a grief-stricken Surfer turns to Nova and romantic feelings begin to develop between them.<ref name="silversurfer14v3">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #14 (Aug 1988)</ref> The Surfer's influence gradually leads Nova to question the morality of her role as herald to Galactus.<ref name="silversurfer51v3">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #51 (July 1991)</ref> Eventually replaced by the far more ruthless [[Morg]], Nova dies in a conflict between the new herald and the Surfer and the other ex-heralds.<ref name="silversurfer75v3">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #75 (Dec. 1992)</ref>

The Surfer repeatedly battles space-born menaces, the chief of whom is Thanos, who attempts to kill half the life in the universe using the omnipotent [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Gauntlet]].<ref name="InfinityGauntlet1">''Infinity Gauntlet'' #1 (July 1991)</ref> Through Thanos, the Surfer learns how Galactus had altered his soul. He convinces Galactus to restore it,<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol 3 #48 (Feb 1991)</ref> but once Galactus has done so, the Surfer is overcome with grief until he is able to forgive himself.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol 3 #58 (Nov 1991)</ref> The Surfer finds interstellar allies in [[Adam Warlock]]'s [[Infinity Watch]] and the "Star Masters" team, and he begins attending occasional Defenders reunions.

The Surfer returns home to Zenn-La to find that the planet has vanished, and learns it was actually destroyed in the 1940s (Earth time) by the entity known as the Other. Zenn-La and its people which the Surfer repeatedly encountered since leaving Galactus' service were actually reproductions, created by Galactus so that the Surfer would have a home to return to.<ref name="silversurfer130v3">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #130 (Aug. 1997)</ref>  Losing his capacity for emotion again, the Surfer returns to Earth. He later regains his personality during a time-travel adventure and sharing a romance with Alicia Masters.<ref name="silversurfer129v3">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #129 (June 1997)</ref> The two ultimately part as friends after many adventures together.

Later, the Surfer works with the alien Annunaki race to gather and protect some of Earth's most extraordinarily gifted children.<ref name="silversurfer1v4">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 4, #1 (March 2004)</ref> In the end, one of these children, Ellie Waters, saves Earth from the godlike [[Marduk]] entity, preventing the apocalypse and reordering reality as if the Marduk crisis had never happened (though Ellie alone apparently retains her memories of these events).<ref name="silversurfer1v4">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 4, #12 (Oct. 2004)</ref> The Surfer resumes his interstellar wanderings, but promises to be ready to aid his adopted homeworld should Earth ever need him.

During his travels, the Surfer is captured by a portal of the Planet Sakaar Empire. Left weakened and vulnerable by his trip through the portal, the Surfer is subdued and implanted with an obedience disk to ensure he remains loyal to them. Fighting as a gladiator (and believed to be the fabled 'Sakaarson' due to his appearance), the Surfer is finally forced to face the Hulk along with his [[Warbound]]. Through teamwork and distraction, the Hulk is eventually able to destroy the Surfer's obedience disk. The Hulk and several other slaves and gladiators are freed when the Surfer uses the Power Cosmic to remove their own obedience disks and give them a way out of the arena, although the Hulk declines the Surfer's offer to take him back to Earth.<ref>[[Greg Pak]], ''The Incredible Hulk'' #95</ref>

During the ''[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]'' war, the Silver Surfer again becomes Galactus' herald to help save the universe from the despot [[Annihilus]].<ref>''Annihilation: Silver Surfer'' #1-4 (June- Sept. 2006)</ref> Annihilus captures them<ref>''Annihilation'' #1 (Oct 2006)</ref> and gives them to [[Thanos]] for experimentation. [[Drax the Destroyer]] frees the Surfer, who in turn frees Galactus. An enraged Galactus destroys more than half the Annihilation Wave, and Annihilus is defeated.<ref>''[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]'' #6 (March 2007)</ref> Later, the Surfer is joined as herald by [[Stardust (Marvel Comics)|Stardust]], a former herald the Surfer had replaced.<ref>''Annihilation: Silver Surfer'' #4 (Sept 2006)</ref><ref>''Annihilation: Heralds of Galactus'' #2 (Feb 2007)</ref>

The Surfer leads the world devourer to the populated planet Orbucen, which brings him into conflict with [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Richard Rider]]. He delays the planetary destruction to give the inhabitants more time to evacuate.<ref>''Nova'' Vol 4, #13-15</ref>

The Silver Surfer returns to Sakaar in a plan to feed Galactus with the unique "Old Power" which he claims would sate his master's hunger for thousands of years, sparing many other inhabited worlds. He is opposed by the Hulk's son [[Skaar]], and is enslaved by an obedience disc. The conflict is ended when Skaar's mother [[Caiera]] sacrifices her soul and Old Power as sustenance for Galactus.<ref>''Skaar: Son of Hulk'' #7-10</ref> Unfortunately, Galactus now seems addicted to the Old Power and has begun searching for other planets containing it to sate himself.<ref>''Son of Hulk'' #12-13</ref>

After an encounter with the [[High Evolutionary]],<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol 6 #1-5 (Feb-June 2011)</ref> the Silver Surfer and Galactus battled [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardians]]. The battle ended when the Silver Surfer chose to leave his post as herald and guard an Asgardian artifact. Galactus "tethers" him to Asgard's location in [[Oklahoma]], resulting in his powers waning the further he travels from Asgard, and grants him the ability to return to human form.<ref>''The Mighty Thor'' #1-6 (May - Sept 2011)</ref>

During the [[Fear Itself (comics)|war with the Serpent]], Silver Surfer aids Doctor Strange, Namor, [[Loa (comics)|Loa]], and [[She-Hulk (Lyra)|Lyra]] in the liberation of New Atlantis from Attuma (in the form of Nerkodd: Breaker of Oceans).<ref>''Fear Itself: The Deep'' #1</ref> He subsequently aided Loki in 'reactivating' Mjolnir so that it could restore the deceased Thor's memory in time to allow him to return to life.<ref>''The Mighty Thor'' #10</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Silver Surfer wields the [[Power Cosmic]], granting him superhuman strength, endurance, senses and the ability to absorb and manipulate the universe's ambient energy. The Surfer can navigate through interstellar space<ref name="silversurfernovacorpsfiles"/> and hyperspace, which he can enter to exceed the speed of light when flying on his board,<ref name="silversurfernovacorpsfiles">''Annihilation: The Nova Corps Files'' #1 (Oct. 2006)</ref> and has even proven capable of time travel on several occasions, even able to make others time-travel with him.<ref name="silversurferv106">''The Silver Surfer''  #6 (June 1969)</ref>

The Surfer sustains himself by converting matter into energy; does not require food, water, air, or sleep (although he occasionally enters a sleep-like meditation in order to dream); and can survive within nearly any known natural environment, including deep space, hyperspace, and even within [[black hole]]s<ref>''Galactus the Devourer'' #1-6</ref> and [[Star#Structure|stars]].<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3 #37 (May 1990)</ref> The Surfer project energy in various forms for offensive and defensive use, including  bolts of cosmic force powerful enough to destroy entire planets,<ref name="ASS4"/><ref>''Silver Surfer Annual'' #7 (1994)</ref> and create black holes.<ref name="ASS4">''Annihilation: Silver Surfer'' #4 (July 2006)</ref> He can utilize the Power Cosmic to augment his superhuman strength to indeterminate levels.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #55 (Oct. 1966)</ref> The Surfer can heal living organisms, though he cannot raise the dead,<ref name="silversurfernovacorpsfiles" /> and he has proven capable of revitalizing and evolving organic life on a planet-wide scale.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3 #104 (May 1995)</ref> He can cast illusions,<ref name="silversurfer33v3">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #33 (Jan. 1990)</ref> create interdimensional portals and microverses,<ref name="silversurfer33v3" /> phase through solid matter, <ref name="silversurfernovacorpsfiles" /> and exercise some level of control over the [[Astral Plane]].<ref name="In Thy Name">''Silver Surfer: In Thy Name'' #4</ref>

His senses enable him to detect objects and concentrations of energy light years away and to perceive matter and energy in subatomic detail, including life energies of living beings.<ref name="Marvel Encyclopedia">''The Marvel Encyclopedia'' (Marvel Comics, 2002)</ref> The Surfer can even see through time, and with concentration he can achieve limited perception of past and future events in his general vicinity.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #260</ref> He has demonstrated telepathic ability, including mind-reading on occasion,<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #93 (Jul. 1967)</ref> and has proven to be able to influence human emotion and sensation.<ref name="silversurfernovacorpsfiles" />

The Surfer's board is composed of a nearly impervious, cosmically powered silvery material that is similar to his own skin. The board is mentally linked to the Surfer and moves in response to his mental commands even when he is not in physical contact with it.<ref name="marvelencyclopedia">''The Marvel Encyclopedia'' #1 October 2002, Marvel Comics</ref> The board is nearly indestructible, but on those rare occasions when it has been damaged or destroyed, the Surfer has proven able to repair it, or even recreate it, with little effort.<ref name="silversurfer1v3" /> The Surfer can attack opponents remotely by directing the board against them, and the board is capable of absorbing and imprisoning other beings, at least temporarily.<ref name="silversurfer122v3">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #122 (Nov. 1996)</ref>

When Galactus exiled the Surfer to Earth, his means of imprisonment was linked to the board. When the Surfer and the [[Fantastic Four]] realized this, the Surfer put it to the test by leaving the board planet-side and entering space in the Four's spacecraft. Once he was free of Earth, the Surfer remotely converted the board to energy, recalled it to him, and reformed it in space.<ref name="silversurfer1v3" />

Norrin Radd also possesses some knowledge of the advanced alien technology of the planet Zenn-La.

===Ultimate Marvel===
[[Warren Ellis]]' [[Ultimate Galactus Trilogy]] originally suggested that the [[Ultimates]]' ally the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] was the herald of Galactus, a robotic probe that travels through space warning civilizations of the impending arrival of [[Gah Lak Tus]]. In the final miniseries of the trilogy, ''[[Ultimate Extinction]]'', silvery humanoids began to appear, sent to trigger mass suicides in order to reduce the population's resistance. Suicide cults founded by the creatures began to appear all across the globe as Gah Lak Tus drew near. These silvery beings had the ability to grow wings; morph into an [[oval|ovoid]]; form spikes; or take an intermediary form, gliding on an oval surface. They also demonstrated the ability to manipulate large quantities of energy.

In ''[[Ultimate Fantastic Four]]'' #42, another Ultimate incarnation of the Silver Surfer appears, called the '''Silver Searcher'''. He is teleported to Earth after Reed mistakes him for a star that he is trying to harness. His appearance triggers planet-wide chaos and natural calamities. In #43, [[Ultimate Mister Fantastic|Reed]] comments that Gah Lak Tus seems to have modeled its drones on this surfer, and he gives his name as Norin Radd. The Searcher states that he will summon his "master", who will make the population of the Earth happier than they have ever been.<ref name="ultimateff43">''Ultimate Fantastic Four'' #43 (May 2007)</ref>

In #44, the Surfer's master is revealed to be Zenn-La's ruler, Revka Temerlune Edifex Scyros III, "the king without enemies", who uses mind-control to make the population of Earth worship him (before it takes effect on the Fantastic Four, the [[Human Torch]] calls him "[[Psycho-Man]]"). It is revealed that the Surfer has been exiled from Zenn-La for destroying the control that Psycho-Man had over Zenn-La, but because of finding Earth for his master to "save" he may return. After Psycho-Man gains domain over Earth, the Silver Surfer, temporarily imprisoned in his own 'memorial' statue, rescues Mr. Fantastic, tells him his story, and asks him to save Earth. The Surfer then helps the Fantastic Four defeat other Surfer-like assassins of Psycho-Man. With the Surfers beaten and the insane Psycho-Man reprogrammed to experience the unthinking happiness he had imposed on others, Silver Surfer wanders the space ways.

In [[Ultimate X-Men]], [[Jean Grey#Ultimate Jean Grey/Marvel Girl|Jean Grey]] as [[Phoenix God|Phoenix]] travels through space and is stopped by what is named as "A Silver Surfer". He informs Phoenix that the [[Watcher (comics)|Watchers]] disapprove of the problems her flight across the universe is causing and briefly battles her before asking what she is looking for.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #96 (July 2008)</ref>

===Exiles===
On Earth 552, Norrin Radd had been a great military scientist who accidentally destroyed his own world with his greatest invention. Determined to bring it back to existence, he approached [[Galactus#Exiles|Galactus]], Restorer of Worlds, and became his herald in the hope that Galactus would resurrect his world in exchange for his service. However, Galactus had taken an oath to only revive those worlds destroyed by the Blight. An enraged Silver Surfer then turned against his master, destroying those who worshiped him and attempting to kill Galactus himself in order to steal the knowledge of world restoration. This led to the destruction of Earth, the coming of the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]], the deaths of the [[Shi'ar]] [[Imperial Guard (comics)|Imperial Elite Guard]], and inevitably the Surfer's own destruction at the claws of a cosmically empowered [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]].<ref name="exiles87">{{cite web

===Marvel Zombies===
The Silver Surfer remains uninfected in the ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'' on [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Earth-2149]]. Instead of coming to Earth and meeting the Fantastic Four, he is attacked by a horde of zombies.  After fighting valiantly, he is killed by the [[Alternative versions of the Hulk#Marvel Zombies|Hulk]], and his body is devoured by a few of the zombies (Hulk, [[Colonel America]], [[Henry Pym|Giant-Man]], [[Iron Man]], [[Luke Cage]], [[Alternative versions of Wolverine#Marvel Zombies|Wolverine]], and [[Alternative versions of Spider-Man#Marvel Zombies|Spider-Man]]). His corpse grants the zombies a portion each of his cosmic powers, which they use to kill all of the other zombie heroes and villains whom they consider "competition" for what's left of the living. Afterwards, Pym creates a machine that concentrates the Cosmic powers they all share to create a massive blast that kills [[Galactus#Marvel Zombies|Galactus]], at which point they eat him. Now imbued with the power of Galactus himself (and realizing they can now fly and survive in space), they adopt his role, traveling the universe and picking worlds clean of life.<ref name="marvelzombies5">''Marvel Zombies'' #5'' (April 2006)</ref>

===MC2===
During the finale of ''[[Last Planet Standing]]'', the Silver Surfer foils Galactus' plan to create a new Big Bang, merging with Galactus himself in the process to become a new being. Gaining control of Galactus' powers, the new entity undoes the damage done by the old Galactus.<ref name="lastplanetstanding5">''Last Planet Standing'' #5 (July 2006)</ref>

===The Keeper===
In the [[alternate history|alternate timeline]] of Earth-691, notably the [[Guardians of the Galaxy]] issues #24 and #25 story arc, Norrin Radd was featured as The Keeper. This new version of the Silver Surfer sans his surfboard had [[Quantum bands|Quantum Bands]], which augmented his "Power Cosmic" and designated him as the Protector of the Universe, as with other bearers of the Bands before him. He works with the Guardians in an attempt to kill Galactus once and for all, his first attempt with [[Firelord (comics)|Firelord]] and Dargo-Thor having failed.  Eventually, the Keeper realizes that, with his augmented power, he can supply Galactus with the energy he needs and end the Planet-Eater's consumption of worlds.  [[Eon (comics)|Eon]], cosmic being and creator of the Quantum Bands, reveals that this was the ultimate purpose of the Keeper becoming the Protector of the Universe, and he enters into a symbiotic partnership with Galactus, who accepts the Keeper as an equal; he is last seen leaving with Galactus, riding a silver surfboard once more.

===Earth X/Universe X/Paradise X===
In issue 11 and 12 of the ''[[Earth X]]'' series, [[Black Bolt]] calls upon [[Galactus#Earth X|Galactus]] to come destroy the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]] seed growing within Earth.  The Silver Surfer accompanies him along with his love Shalla-Bal, who had now been turned into a silver herald of Galactus as well.

===Elseworlds===
In ''Green Lantern/Silver Surfer'', the Silver Surfer confronts [[Hank Henshaw|Cyborg Superman]] over the destruction of a planet and is met by [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]]. Parallax beats the Cyborg, but the Silver Surfer lets him go and tries to sympathize with Parallax. The two return to Earth to find [[Kyle Rayner]] with Thanos, leading them to believe they formed an alliance when in reality Thanos tricked Kyle. Kyle convinces the Surfer to help him stop Parallax and Thanos from destroying the universe and that he was duped into giving Thanos Oa's power. The Surfer similarly gave most of his power to Parallax to reform the destroyed planet, forcing Kyle to use his ring to drain both villains of their enhanced powers before they can destroy everything. Unable to contain the power himself, Kyle channels the power from the two villains into the Silver Surfer, who opens a portal and sucks the two inside.<ref>''Green Lantern/Silver Surfer'' one-shot</ref>

===Carnage Cosmic===
In the main Marvel continuity, the Silver Surfer bonds with the [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]] [[symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] in two issues of ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', gaining the name "Carnage Cosmic."  He looks like the original Carnage from the [[Spider-Man]] comics, but still has the trademark surfboard of the Silver Surfer. In the first issue, the Carnage Symbiote leaves Cletus Kasady, to seek revenge for the destruction of its homeworld the only way it knows how, by using the Surfer as its new host. After the symbiote completes merging to the Surfer, he immediately rampages as a side effect to the two entities conflicting with each other. The Carnage Cosmic then flies off into outer space. Cletus Kasady, "symbiote-less," is taken to the hospital for the immense pain he suffers as a result of the separation (this is revealed to be the result of an advanced case of stomach cancer the symbiote had been guarding him from).<ref name="ReferenceA">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 1 #431</ref> As Carnage Cosmic  drifts along in space, the symbiote recants memories from Kasady and itself to Norrin Radd (the Surfer's former self). Radd sees how the symbiote remembers the Surfer summoning his master, Galactus, to the planet to consume it. Then the Surfer is shown memories of Kasady's abusive youth. The Surfer breaks free realizing what he must do. He returns to Earth as the Cosmic Carnage. After a brief roof-top battle with Spider-Man, the mismatched pair searches the city finding Kasady in the hospital, still screaming in pain. Upon immediately seeing Kasady, the symbiote re-bonds with Kasady, but to ensure Carnage will never hurt any one else again, The Surfer encases Carnage in an unbreakable shell of ethereal energy.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===What If===
Silver Surfer was featured in different issues of ''[[What If (comics)|What If?]]''

* An issue of "What If?" revolving around ''[[Atlantis Attacks]]'' had Silver Surfer and Quasar as the survivors of an attack by [[Father Set|Set]]. With the help of Thor (who is horribly burned and placed in stasis to keep him alive), Silver Surfer and Quasar destroy two of Set's heads before Quasar (empowered by the Uni-Power) sacrifices his freedom to exile himself and Set inside Doctor Strange's Eye of Agamotto. Silver Surfer gives the Eye of Agamotto to Uatu the Watcher for safe keeping as Set's children are born.<ref>''What If?'' Vol. 2 #25</ref>

* One issue of "What If?" revolved around the Cosmic Carnage where the Carnage symbiote remained bonded to the Surfer, forcing Spider-Man and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] to battle him until [[Firestar]] was able to use her powers to disrupt the symbiote's control over the Surfer. After his powers were used to destroy dozens of New York City blocks and realizing that there was only one way to stop the symbiote, the Silver Surfer flew himself into the sun, seemingly destroying both himself and the creature.<ref>''What If?'' vol. 2 #108</ref>

This persona takes control of the Surfer and serves as the main villain of the second half of Season 2.

===Film===

[[File:Silver Surfer in Fantastic Four 2.jpg|thumb|The Silver Surfer in ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]'' (2007)]]
* In the 1983 film ''[[Breathless (1983 film)|Breathless]]'', Jesse Lujack ([[Richard Gere]]) is a drifter in Las Vegas, obsessed with the Silver Surfer, the rock and roll music of [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] and Monica Poiccard ([[Valérie Kaprisky]]), a UCLA architecture undergraduate whom he knows only from a weekend fling in Vegas. The Silver Surfer was the primary inspiration for Lujack's strong sense of love, loyalty, identity, free-spirit, and self-determinism at all costs, even to the point of self-destruction.

* In 1991, [[Erik Fleming (director)|Erik Fleming]] and [[Steven Robiner]], two film students from the [[USC School of Cinematic Arts]], approached [[Marvel Studios]] and producer [[Bernd Eichinger]] to ask permission to make a short film featuring the Silver Surfer as a proof of concept for the use of CGI in creating a realistic silver coloured human figure.<ref name="Silver Surfer short">{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=4217 |title= Saga of the Silver Surfer (Film): Making of "The Silver Surfer|author=  Beau Yarbrough|date=15 March 2000 |work= |publisher=Comic Book Resources |accessdate=1 March 2011}}</ref> This short film, completed in 1992, not long after the release of ''[[Terminator 2: Judgement Day]]'' that featured a similarly rendered character, led to significant interest from major studios in a feature length Silver Surfer project.<ref name="Silver Surfer short"/>

Also, if the Surfer is separated from his board, he becomes weaker; in addition, the board also serves as a beacon for Galactus.

===Video games===
* The ''[[Silver Surfer (video game)|Silver Surfer]]'' video game, developed by [[Software Creations (UK)|Software Creations]], Ltd., debuted on the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] in 1990. The game is notorious for its unforgiving and extremely steep difficulty.<ref name="ssvg">{{cite web
