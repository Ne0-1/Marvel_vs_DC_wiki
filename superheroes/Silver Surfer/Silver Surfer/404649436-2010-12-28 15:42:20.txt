The '''Silver Surfer''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]] created by [[Jack Kirby]]. The character [[first appearance|first appears]] in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #48 (March 1966), the first of a three-issue arc that fans call "[[The Galactus Trilogy]]".<ref>Thomas, Roy, ''Stan Lee's Amazing Marvel Universe'' (Sterling Publishing, New York, 2006), "Moment 29: The Galactus Trilogy", pp. 112-115.

Originally,  '''Norrin Radd''', a young [[astronomer]] of the planet [[Zenn-La]], made a bargain with the cosmic entity [[Galactus]], pledging to serve as his herald in order to save his homeworld from destruction.

Galactus also created for Radd a [[surfboard]]-like craft — modeled after a childhood fantasy of his —  on which he would travel at speeds beyond that of [[light]]. Known from then on as the Silver Surfer, Radd began to roam the [[cosmos]] searching for new planets for Galactus to consume.  When his travels finally took him to [[Earth]], the Surfer came face-to-face with the [[Fantastic Four]], a team of powerful superheroes that helped him to rediscover his nobility of spirit. Betraying Galactus, the Surfer saved Earth but was punished in return by being [[exile]]d there.<ref name="fantasticfour48">''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #48 (March 1966)</ref>

==Publication history==
===Early appearances===
The Silver Surfer debuted as an unplanned addition to the [[superhero]]-team comic ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #48 (March 1966). The comic's writer-editor, [[Stan Lee]], and its [[penciller]] and co-plotter, [[Jack Kirby]], had by the mid-1960s developed using a collaborative technique known as the "[[Marvel Method]]": the two would discuss story ideas, Kirby would work from a brief synopsis to draw the individual scenes and plot details, and Lee would finally add the dialog and captions. When Kirby turned in his pencil art for the story, he included a new character he and Lee had not discussed.<ref name="Markstein">{{cite web

''Kirby: King of Comics'' ([[Harry N. Abrams]], New York, 2008), p. 141</ref> Kirby explained that the story's agreed-upon [[antagonist]], a god-like cosmic [[predation|predator]] of planets named [[Galactus]], should have some sort of [[herald]], and that he created the surfboard "because I'm tired of drawing spaceships!"<ref name="theultimatesilversurfer">Quoted in Lee, ''The Ultimate Silver Surfer''</ref> Taken by the noble features of the new character, who turned on his master to help defend Earth, Lee overcame his initial skepticism and began adding characterization. The Silver Surfer soon became a key part of the unfolding story.<ref name="Markstein"/>

Following the Surfer's debut, Lee and Kirby brought him back as a recurring guest in ''Fantastic Four'' #55-61, 72, and 74-77 (ranging Oct. 1966 - Aug. 1968). The character made his solo debut in the backup story of  ''Fantastic Four Annual'' #5 (Nov. 1967).

The following year, Lee launched the solo title ''The Silver Surfer''. [[John Buscema]] was penciller for the first 17 issues of the series, with Kirby returning for the 18th and final issue. The first seven issues, which included anthological "Tales of the Watcher" backup stories, were 72-page (with advertising), 25-cent "giants", as opposed to the typical 36-page, 12-cent comics of the time. Thematically, the stories dealt with the Surfer's exile on Earth and the inhumanity of man as observed by this noble yet fallen hero. Though short-lived, the series became known as one of Lee's most thoughtful and introspective works.<ref name="silversurfer2v3backcover">Marvel Comics writer [[Steve Englehart]], for example, in his back-cover text for ''The Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #2 (Aug. 1987), wrote that Buscema and Lee were "pouring their souls into the series".</ref>

Following his series' cancellation, the Surfer made sporadic appearances as a guest star or [[antagonist]] in such comic books as ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'', ''[[Defenders (comics)|The Defenders]]'', and ''Fantastic Four''. Lee remained partial to the Surfer, and with Kirby collaborated on a seminal 1978 [[graphic novel]] starring the character.

===Subsequent series===
After a 1982 [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] by writer-artist [[John Byrne]], the Surfer appeared in his second solo, ongoing [[Silver Surfer, volume 3|title]] in 1987. Here he escaped the confines of Earth and left for the spaceways. Originally written by [[Steve Englehart]] and illustrated by [[Marshall Rogers]], the series would later be written by [[Jim Starlin]] and illustrated by [[Ron Lim]]. Starlin in turn would be succeeded by [[Ron Marz]], with [[George Pérez]] and [[J. M. DeMatteis]] also having brief writing stints. Additional artists included [[Tom Grindberg]], [[Ron Garney]], and [[Jon J. Muth]], as well as periodic guest spots by the aforementioned [[John Buscema]]. Although the title experienced great initial success, and continued to be buoyed by tie-ins to "[[The Infinity Gauntlet]]" and other company crossovers, this second ongoing series was canceled in 1998 after 146 issues.  It was followed in 1999 by the two issue miniseries, ''Silver Surfer: Loftier Than Mortals''.

''The Silver Surfer: Parable'', scripted by Lee and drawn by [[Jean Giraud|Moebius]], was serialized in two parts in 1988 and 1989.  Because of inconsistencies with other stories, it has been argued {{By whom|date=April 2010}} that these stories actually feature an alternate Silver Surfer from a parallel Earth.<ref>{{cite web

===2000s===
A new ongoing Silver Surfer series began in 2003, focusing on the character's alien nature and messianic allegory. It lasted 14 issues. The Surfer later appeared in an issue of ''[[Cable & Deadpool]]'' and has twice been reunited with the superhero group the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. In 2006-2007, he starred in the four-issue miniseries ''[[Annihilation (comics)#Annihilation: Silver Surfer|Annihilation: Silver Surfer]]'' and co-starred in the miniseries  ''[[Annihilation (comics)#Annihilation: Heralds of Galactus|Heralds of Galactus]]'', both part of the "Annihilation" [[fictional crossover]].

In 2007, the Silver Surfer starred in a four-issue miniseries ''Silver Surfer: Requiem'' by writer [[J. Michael Straczynski]] and artist Esad Ribic. The first issue was released May 30, 2007 to coincide with the character's first movie appearance.<ref name="ssrequiemign">{{cite web

==Fictional character biography==
===Herald of Galactus===
The Silver Surfer was born Norrin Radd on the idyllic planet [[Zenn-La]] (in the [[Deneb]] System in the [[Milky Way]] [[galaxy]]).  His father is Jartan Radd, his mother Elmar Radd, and his half-brother Fennan Radd (Fennan the son of a woman Jartran was involved with after Elmar's suicide). All four are part of an ancient and significantly advanced civilization that has lost the will to strive or explore, leaving the young scholar Norrin Radd restless and yearning for something more than the idle pleasure pursued by his fellows. Faced suddenly with the total destruction of his world by planet-consuming [[Galactus]], Radd strikes a deal with the seemingly omnipotent space-god.  In return for the safety of Zenn-La and his lover, [[Shalla-Bal]], Radd pledges himself to serve as Galactus' [[Herald of Galactus|herald]] and to seek out other planets for the world devourer to feed on.  In striking this bargain, Radd also satisfies his long-held desire to adventure beyond the limiting world of his home. Accepting the young mortal's sacrifice, Galactus imbues him with a portion of the [[Power Cosmic]], transforming him into the Silver Surfer.<ref name="silversurfer1v1">''Silver Surfer #1'' (Aug. 1968)</ref>

Radd proceeds to serve Galactus for an unspecified amount of time—possibly as long as several millennia—unable to return to Zenn-La and Shalla-Bal. During this time, the Surfer initially tries to seek out uninhabited planets for the world-eater's attention, but as they became harder to find, Galactus tampers with the Surfer's conscience and removes this self-imposed restraint. Eventually, the Surfer arrives on Earth and, after deciding that the planet is ripe for Galactus' nourishment, summons his master. Here the Surfer meets the [[Fantastic Four]], and [[Alicia Masters]]. He is knocked off the roof by the Thing, but found by Alicia. Touched by their nobility, he chooses to rebel against Galactus and battled him in an attempt to prevent his master from consuming the planet. Galactus is eventually driven off, but as punishment for this rebellion he confines the Surfer to the planet with an invisible barrier that affects only him.<ref name="fantasticfour50">''Fantastic Four'' #48-50 (March–May 1966)</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Brian |last=Cronin |url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/02/19/a-year-of-cool-comics-day-50/ |title=A Year of Cool Comics – Day 50 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] CSBG Archive |date=February 19, 2010|accessdate=September 29, 2010 }}</ref>

===Exiled to Earth===
Stories immediately following the Surfer's exile to Earth depict him as a semi-divine being, immeasurably powerful yet lacking the most basic understanding of good or evil. A completely [[amoralism|amoral]] entity, he develops a sense of compassion through contact with the gentle Alicia Masters, a blind sculptress capable of perceiving the Surfer's innate nobility.<ref name="fantasticfour48" /> This theme continues through a series of subplots wherein the Surfer encounters various negative human traits including [[jealousy]] (when [[Thing (comics)|The Thing]] is driven to rage by the Surfer's relationship with his girlfriend, Alicia), deception, evil, cruelty (de-powered and imprisoned by [[Doctor Doom]], then tortured by Doom's brutal henchmen), despair, hopelessness (languishing in a [[Latveria]]n dungeon while Doom uses the Power Cosmic to conquer the world), and finally a thirst for revenge (destroying Doom's castle along with his sadistic captors when he finally escapes). At the same time, however, the Surfer continues to evolve as an individual.

During his exile, the Surfer fights numerous villains, including but not limited to Doctor Doom and [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]. Doom is obsessed with stealing the Surfer's Power Cosmic and finally does so by distracting the Surfer with a vision of space, then depowering him, using it to defeat the Fantastic Four, only to lose it by colliding with Galactus' barrier.<ref name="fantasticfour72">''Fantastic Four'' #57 (Dec. 1966)</ref> Angry at the general disregard shown by humans, the Surfer attempts to bring about world peace by giving mankind a common enemy in himself, going so far as to declare war on humanity. He battles the Fantastic Four, but the [[United States armed forces|U.S. military]] strikes him down with an experimental power-draining "Sonic Shark" missile and forces him to resume his wanderings.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #72</ref> The Surfer enters a "micro-world", pursued by the Fantastic Four, and locates a planet for Galactus to consume instead of Earth; he then resumes his exile.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #74-77</ref> The demonic [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] is persistent in trying to acquire the Surfer's soul by breaking his spirit, but Surfer's innate nobility thwarts him each time. The Surfer also battles with [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] during his first encounter with Mephisto.<ref name="silversurfer3v1">''The Silver Surfer'' #3 (Dec. 1968)</ref> The Surfer's only ally during these trials is a physicist by the name of Al B. Harper, who eventually sacrifices himself to save the world from the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]].<ref name="silversurfer5v1">''The Silver Surfer'' #5 (April 1969)</ref>

Banding together with [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]] during these wanderings, the Surfer forms the "Titans Three," a group dedicated to battling evil on Earth.<ref name="submariner34">''Sub-Mariner'' #34-35 (Feb.-March 1971)</ref> Soon, [[Doctor Strange]] joins the group and it becomes "the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]." Surfer stays with them for a while, but his overwhelming desire to be free of Earth and his frequent collisions with Galactus' energy-draining barrier eventually drives him to leave the group.  He has other encounters at this time, including being duped by Doctor Doom into turning against the Fantastic Four,<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #155-157 (February–April 1975)</ref> and encounters [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]].<ref>''Tomb of Dracula'' #50 (November 1976)</ref>

During this time in exile, the Surfer is reunited with Shalla-Bal on several occasions, but almost every time she appears as an unwilling pawn of his enemies, and he is invariably forced to let her go to save the planet. The Surfer finally pierces Galactus' barrier with the aid of [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] and temporarily escapes Earth.  He discovers, though, that his homeworld has been ravaged by Galactus and Shalla-Bal has been abducted by Mephisto and taken to Earth.  Even though it means trapping himself once more, the Surfer returns to Earth to battle and defeat Mephisto.  Before being vanquished, Mephisto sends Shalla-Bal back to Zenn-La, but the Surfer manages to endow her with a portion of his Power Cosmic, which she uses to revitalize the plant life of their ravaged homeworld.<ref name="silversurfer1v2">''The Silver Surfer'' vol. 2, #1 (June 1978)</ref>

Alongside the Defenders once more, the Surfer journeys to the [[Earth-712|parallel Earth]] of the [[Squadron Supreme]], where he battles [[Null, the Living Darkness]] and the [[Overmind (comics)|Over-Mind]].<ref>''Defenders'' #112-114 (October–December 1982)</ref> The Surfer then aids the Fantastic Four against Galactus' latest herald, [[Terrax]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #260 (November 1983)</ref> The Surfer also helps the [[Molecule Man]] restore the damage done to Earth by the [[Beyonder]].<ref>''Avengers'' #266 (April 1986)</ref>

===Freedom from Exile===
After all this time in exile, the Surfer finally manages to pierce Galactus' barrier once and for all by acting on the Thing's simple suggestion of trying to pass through on a spaceship instead of via his own power on his surfboard.  He also manages to make peace with Galactus by rescuing his current herald, [[Nova (Frankie Raye)]], from the [[Skrull]]s and encounters the [[Champion of the Universe|Champion]], after which Galactus finally declares the Surfer's long exile ended.<ref name="silversurfer1v3">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #1 (July 1987)</ref> He immediately revisits his homeworld, but Shalla-Bal, in his absence, had become empress of the rejuvenated Zenn-La and hence unable to renew their romance.<ref name="silversurfer2v3">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #2 (Aug. 1987)</ref>

Embroiled in fresh hostilities between the interstellar [[Kree]] and Skrull empires, the Surfer also intervenes in a series of plots by the [[Elders of the Universe]], who plan to become supremely powerful by destroying Galactus and the universe with him. The Surfer thwarts this plot with the aid of his new love interest, [[Mantis (Marvel Comics)|Mantis]], the Earth-born cosmic heroine also known as the "Celestial Madonna".<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 3 #4 (October 1987)</ref> She seems to die in the process, and although she eventually returns, she never fully renews their romances.<ref name="silversurfer9v3">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #9 (March 1988)</ref> After this loss, a grief-stricken Surfer turns to Nova and romantic feelings begin to develop between them.<ref name="silversurfer14v3">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #14 (Aug 1988)</ref> The Surfer's influence gradually leads Nova to question the morality of her role as herald to Galactus.<ref name="silversurfer51v3">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #51 (July 1991)</ref> Eventually replaced by the far more ruthless [[Morg]], Nova dies in a conflict between the new herald and the Surfer and the other ex-heralds.<ref name="silversurfer75v3">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #75 (Dec. 1992)</ref>

The Surfer, during this period, first encounters [[Thanos]], a death-worshipping mutant of the race the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]],<ref name="silversurfer34v3">''Silver Surfer'' #34 (Feb. 1990)</ref> and first meets [[Adam Warlock]].<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 3 #46 (February 1991)</ref> The Surfer repeatedly battles other space-born menaces, the chief of whom is Thanos, who wipes out half the life in the universe using the omnipotent [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Gauntlet]].<ref name="InfinityGauntlet1">''Infinity Gauntlet'' #1 (July 1991)</ref> The Surfer also finds interstellar allies in Adam Warlock's [[Infinity Watch]], forms the short-lived "Star Masters" team, and begins attending occasional Defenders reunions.  During his travels, the Surfer also meets his long-lost half-brother, Fennan Radd, to whom Shalla-Bal has become married.<ref name="silversurfer101v3">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #101 (Feb. 1995)</ref>

In one of his adventures, the Surfer discovers the way in which Galactus tampered with his mind and soul during his time as herald.<ref name="silversurfer48v3">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #48 (April 1991)</ref> Further aspects of his past life are also revealed, including the fact that he saw his mother's dead body after she slit her own wrists<ref name="silversurfer57v3">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #57 (Oct. 1991)</ref> and that his father, a prominent scientist, was accused of having plagiarized and shot himself in response to Norrin's disappointment.<ref name="silversurfer50v3">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #50 (June 1991)</ref> During the ''Infinity Gauntlet'' saga, the Surfer eventually confronts these memories and comes to forgive himself.<ref name="silversurfer58v3">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #58 (Nov. 1991)</ref>

The Surfer eventually returns home to Zenn-La to find that the planet has vanished, and learns it was actually destroyed in the 1940s (Earth time) by the entity known as the Other. Zenn-La and its people which the Surfer repeatedly encountered since leaving Galactus' service were actually reproductions, created by Galactus so that the Surfer would have a home to return to.<ref name="silversurfer130v3">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #130 (Aug. 1997)</ref>  Losing his capacity for emotion again, the Surfer returns to Earth. He later regains his personality during a time-travel adventure and sharing a romance with Alicia Masters.<ref name="silversurfer129v3">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #129 (June 1997)</ref> The two ultimately part as friends after many adventures together.

After the Fantastic Four are resurrected in the aftermath of the [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught crisis]] and their return from the [[Heroes Reborn]] universe, the Surfer comes to Earth to welcome them home, but ends up joining [[Spider-Man]] in his latest battle against [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]]. During this fight, the Carnage symbiote briefly manages to take over the Surfer, but the Surfer is able to expel the symbiote, trapping Carnage in an unbreakable prison where he is forced to reflect upon his sins for all eternity<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #430 to #431</ref> (although he later escapes under as-yet-undisclosed circumstances).  The return of the heroes causes the shattering of the Nexus of All Realities,<ref>''Man-Thing'' vol. 3 #2</ref> and one of the fragments lands on a dead world and starts bringing it to life.  The Surfer fights [[Man-Thing]], possessed by the spirit of K'Ad-mon of the Fallen Stars, in order to save the newly formed world, but is defeated, and the Nexus piece is reclaimed by Man-Thing.<ref>''Strange Tales'' vol. 4 #1</ref>

When a [[Gaea (Marvel Comics)|Gaea]]-powered curse from a dying [[Yandroth]] mystically forces Surfer, Namor, Hulk, and Strange to assemble in response to any and all threats to the Earth, the ongoing stress coupled with the curse's subtle emotional influence gradually drive the four senior Defenders mad, and they attempt to conquer the world as "[[The Order (comics)|the Order]]" in the belief that this is the most efficient way to protect the planet. Their fellow Defenders [[Patsy Walker|Hellcat]], [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Nighthawk]], [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]], and [[Clea]] team up with other heroes–including Ardina, a cosmic-powered woman they mystically create from a portion of the Surfer's own energy–to oppose the Order and return them to their senses, just in time to prevent the curse from rendering a resurrected Yandroth all-powerful.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

In the 2003 ''Silver Surfer'' series, the Surfer works with the alien Annunaki race to gather and protect some of Earth's most extraordinarily gifted children.<ref name="silversurfer1v4">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 4, #1 (March 2004)</ref> In the end, one of these children, Ellie Waters, saves Earth from the godlike [[Marduk]] entity, preventing the apocalypse and reordering reality as if the Marduk crisis had never happened (though Ellie alone apparently retains her memories of these events).<ref name="silversurfer1v4">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 4, #12 (Oct. 2004)</ref> The Surfer then resumes his interstellar wanderings, but promises to be ready to aid his adopted homeworld should Earth ever need him.

===Planet Hulk/Silver Savage===
During his travels, Surfer is captured by a portal of the Planet Sakaar Empire. Left weakened and vulnerable by his trip through the portal, the Surfer is subdued and implanted with an obedience disk to ensure he remains loyal to them. Fighting as a gladiator (and believed to be the fabled 'Sakaarson' due to his appearance), the Surfer is finally forced to face the Hulk along with his [[Warbound]]. Through teamwork and distraction, the Hulk is eventually able to destroy the Surfer's obedience disk. The Hulk and several other slaves and gladiators are freed when the Surfer uses the Power Cosmic to remove their own obedience disks and give them a way out of the arena, although the Hulk declines the Surfer's offer to take him back to Earth.<ref>[[Greg Pak]], ''The Incredible Hulk'' #95</ref>

===Annihilation===
{{Main|Annihilation (comics)}}
He later joins other [[herald of Galactus|heralds of Galactus]] against the forces of the Annihilation Wave, and becomes Galactus' herald once more, to help save the universe from the despot [[Annihilus]], and two proemial beings called "Tenebrous, of The Darkness Between" and "[[Aegis (Lady of All Sorrows)|Aegis, Lady of All Sorrows]]".<ref>''Annihilation: Silver Surfer'' #1-4 (June- Sept. 2006)</ref> They defeat and capture the duo, and give them to [[Annihilus]] and the alien mastermind [[Thanos]] for experimentation. Thanos learns of Annihilus' more nefarious goals and attempts to free Galactus, but before he can do so, Thanos is killed by [[Drax the Destroyer]]. When Drax discovers Thanos' plan, he frees the Surfer, who in turn frees Galactus. An enraged Galactus destroys more than half the Annihilation Wave, allowing a group called the United Front to defeat Annihilus.<ref>''[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]'' #1-6 (Oct. 2006 - March 2007)</ref> The Surfer tracks down Aegis and Tenebrous, and when completely outmatched, maneuvers them into entering [[Antimatter#Antiuniverse|The Crunch]], the all-destroying border of the universe, whereupon he fully returns to his role as Galactus' herald, now partnered with [[Stardust (Marvel Comics)|Stardust]].<ref>''Annihilation: Heralds of Galactus'' #1-2 (April–May 2007)</ref> During this time he was empowered further by Galactus.<ref>Annihilation: Silver Surfer #1-4 (June-Sept 2006)</ref>

The Silver Surfer does not participate in the events of [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] due to the fact it takes place roughly the same time as the Annihilation Wave, and the Surfer was occupied with battling the forces of Annihilus during the time the war takes place. However, the U.S. government cannot require him to register, due to the fact he is not even from the planet and thus is beyond their jurisdiction.

===Post-Annihilation===

After the Annihilation event, the Silver Surfer returns to his function as a herald of [[Galactus]], and leads the world devourer to the populated planet Orbucen, which brings him into conflict with [[Nova (comics)|Richard Rider]], at this point the only active Nova Centurion after the Annihilation War. However the Surfer delays the planetary destruction to give the inhabitants more time to evacuate.

Shortly afterwards the Silver Surfer returns to Sakaar, in a plan to feed Galactus with the unique "Old Power" which he claims would sate his master's hunger for thousands of years, and spare many other inhabited worlds in the meantime. He is opposed by the Hulk's son [[Skaar]], and is enslaved by an obedience disc. The conflict is ended when Skaar's mother [[Caiera]] sacrifices her soul and Old Power as sustenance for Galactus.<ref>''Skaar: Son of Hulk'' #7-10</ref>  Unfortunately, Galactus now seems addicted to the Old Power and has begun searching for other planets containing it to sate himself.<ref>''Son of Hulk'' #12-13</ref>

Simultaneously the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]] enlists a much earlier version of the Surfer to reunite with the other three original Defenders, Doctor Strange, Namor, and the Hulk, in a contest against the combined forces of [[Terrax]], [[Baron Mordo]], [[Tiger Shark (Marvel Comics)|Tiger Shark]], and the [[Red Hulk]], named the "Offenders". As a prize the Grandmaster offers his champions to restore their dead or otherwise lost love interests. The Surfer and Terrax are teleported by the Grandmaster to the [[Microverse]] to battle, and are temporarily killed by the [[Red Hulk]], before being restored to their proper time periods.<ref>''Hulk'' #10-12 (2009)</ref>

"Here's where the plucking from time really gives Terrax the advantage," warns [Marvel Comics writer] [[Jeph Loeb|Loeb]]. "Norrin Radd has been the Silver Surfer for about an hour when this story takes place.

[Marvel Comics editor] Bill Rosemann has stated that he considers the Silver Surfer as "the last jewel in the cosmic crown that needs to explode," and that the trick with the Surfer, who he referred to as a "great character", was to figure out "What would make him work as an ongoing hero. We don't want to rush it."<ref>{{cite web|last=George |first=Richard |url=http://uk.comics.ign.com/articles/951/951877p1.html |title=NYCC 09: Marvel's War of Kings panel |publisher=Uk.comics.ign.com |date=2009-02-06 |accessdate=2009-08-30}}</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Silver Surfer wields the [[Power Cosmic]], granting him superhuman strength, stamina, durability, senses and the ability to absorb and manipulate the universe's ambient energy for a variety of effects.  The Surfer can navigate through interstellar space, dimensional barriers, and hyperspace, which he can enter to exceed the speed of light when flying on his board,<ref name="silversurfernovacorpsfiles">''Annihilation: The Nova Corps Files'' #1 (Oct. 2006)</ref>  and has even proven capable of time travel on several occasions.<ref name="silversurferv106">''The Silver Surfer''  #6 (June 1969)</ref>

The Surfer sustains himself by converting matter into energy; does not require food, water, air, or sleep (although he occasionally enters a sleep like meditation in order to dream); and can survive within nearly any known natural environment, including deep space, hyperspace, and even within [[black hole]]s<ref>''Galactus the Devourer #1-6''</ref> and [[Star#Structure|stars]].<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3 #37 (May 1990)</ref> The Surfer can analyze and manipulate matter and energy, and molecularly restructure or animate matter at will, even transmuting elements or creating objects. He can also project energy in various forms for offensive and defensive use, including the erection of force shields, and bolts of cosmic force powerful enough to destroy entire planets <ref>''Annihilation: Silver Surfer'' #4 (July 2006)</ref><ref>''Silver Surfer Annual'' #7 (1994)</ref> or create black holes.  He can utilize the Power Cosmic to augment his superhuman strength to indeterminate levels.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #55 (Oct. 1966)</ref>  The Surfer can heal living organisms, though he cannot raise the dead,<ref name="silversurfernovacorpsfiles" /> and he has proven capable of revitalizing and evolving organic life on a planet-wide scale.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3 #104 (May 1995)</ref> He can alter the size of himself or of other matter, cast illusions,<ref name="silversurfer33v3">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #33 (Jan. 1990)</ref> and phase through solid matter.<ref name="silversurfernovacorpsfiles" />

His senses enable him to detect objects and concentrations of energy light years away and to perceive matter and energy in subatomic detail, including life energies of living beings.<ref name="Marvel Encyclopedia">''The Marvel Encyclopedia'' (Marvel Comics, 2002)</ref> The Surfer can even see through time, and with concentration he can achieve limited perception of past and future events in his general vicinity.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #260</ref> He has demonstrated telepathic ability, including mind-reading on occasion,<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #93 (Jul. 1967)</ref> and has proven to be able to influence human emotion and sensation.<ref name="silversurfernovacorpsfiles" />

The Surfer's board is composed of a nearly impervious, cosmically powered silvery material that is similar to his own skin.  The board is mentally linked to the Surfer and moves in response to his mental commands even when he is not in physical contact with it.<ref name="marvelencyclopedia">''The Marvel Encyclopedia (Original One-shot)'', October 2002, Marvel Comics</ref> The board is nearly indestructible, but on those rare occasions when it is damaged or destroyed, the Surfer is able to repair or even recreate it with little effort.<ref name="silversurfer1v3" /> The Surfer can attack opponents remotely by directing the board against them, and the board is capable of absorbing and imprisoning other beings, at least temporarily.<ref name="silversurfer122v3">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #122 (Nov. 1996)</ref>

When Galactus exiled the Surfer to Earth, his means of imprisonment was linked to the board.  When Surfer and the [[Fantastic Four]] realized this, Surfer put it to the test by leaving the board planet-side and entering space in the Four's spacecraft. Once he was free of Earth, the Surfer remotely converted the board to energy, recalled it to him, and reformed it in space.<ref name="silversurfer1v3" />

Norrin Radd also possesses some knowledge of the advanced alien technology of the planet Zenn-La.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Silver Surfer===
[[Warren Ellis]]' [[Ultimate Galactus Trilogy]] originally suggested that the [[Ultimates]]' ally the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] was the herald of Galactus, a robotic probe that travels through space warning civilizations of the impending arrival of [[Gah Lak Tus]]. In the final miniseries of the trilogy, ''[[Ultimate Extinction]]'', silvery humanoids began to appear, sent to trigger mass suicides in order to reduce the population's resistance. Suicide cults founded by the creatures began to appear all across the globe as Gah Lak Tus drew near. These silvery beings had the ability to grow wings; morph into an [[oval|ovoid]]; form spikes; or take an intermediary form, gliding on an oval surface. They also demonstrated the ability to manipulate large quantities of energy.  All these traits are reminiscent of the Surfer, but their official name is the Silver Men or Silver Wings{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}.

In ''[[Ultimate Fantastic Four]]'' #42, another Ultimate incarnation of the Silver Surfer appears, called the '''Silver Searcher'''. He is teleported to Earth after Reed mistakes him for a star that he is trying to harness. His appearance triggers planet-wide chaos and natural calamities. In #43, [[Ultimate Mister Fantastic|Reed]] comments that Gah Lak Tus seems to have modeled its drones on this surfer, and he gives his name as Norin Radd. The Searcher states that he will summon his "master", who will make the population of the Earth happier than they have ever been.<ref name="ultimateff43">''Ultimate Fantastic Four'' #43 (May 2007)</ref>

In #44, the Surfer's master is revealed to be Zenn-La's ruler, Revka Temerlune Edifex Scyros III, "the king without enemies", who uses mind-control to make the population of Earth worship him (before it takes effect on the Fantastic Four, the [[Human Torch]] calls him "[[Psycho-Man]]"). It is revealed that the Surfer has been exiled from Zenn-La for destroying the control that Psycho-Man had over Zenn-La, but because of finding Earth for his master to "save" he may return. After Psycho-Man gains domain over Earth, the Silver Surfer, temporarily imprisoned in his own 'memorial' statue, rescues Mr. Fantastic, tells him his story, and asks him to save Earth. The Surfer then helps the Fantastic Four defeat other Surfer-like assassins of Psycho-Man. With the Surfers beaten and the insane Psycho-Man reprogrammed to experience the unthinking happiness he had imposed on others, Silver Surfer wanders the space ways.

In [[Ultimate X-Men]], [[Jean Grey#Ultimate Jean Grey/Marvel Girl|Jean Grey]] as [[Phoenix God|Phoenix]] travels through space and is stopped by what is named as "A Silver Surfer". He informs Phoenix that the [[Watcher (comics)|Watchers]] disapprove of the problems her flight across the universe is causing and briefly battles her before asking what she is looking for.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #96 (July 2008)</ref>

===Cosmic Carnage===
The Silver Surfer bonds with the [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]] [[symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] in two issues of ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (comic book)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', gaining the name "Cosmic Carnage ".  He looks like the original Carnage from the [[Spider-Man]] comics, but still has the trademark surfboard of the Silver Surfer. In the first issue, the Carnage Symbiote leaves Cletus Kasady, to seek revenge for the destruction of its homeworld the only way it knows how, by using the Surfer as its new host. After the symbiote completes merging to the Surfer, he immediately rampages as a side effect to the two entities conflicting with each other. The Carnage Cosmic then flies off into outer space. Cletus Kasady, "symbiote-less," is taken to the hospital for the immense pain he suffers as a result of the separation (this is revealed to be the result of an advanced case of stomach cancer the symbiote had been guarding him from).<ref name="ReferenceA">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 1 #431</ref> As Cosmic Carnage  drifts along in space, the symbiote recants memories from Kasady and itself to Norrin Radd (the Surfer's former self). Radd sees how the symbiote remembers the Surfer summoning his master, Galactus, to the planet to consume it. Then the Surfer is shown memories of Kasady's abusive youth. The Surfer breaks free realizing what he must do. He returns to Earth as the Cosmic Carnage . After a brief roof-top battle with Spider-Man, the mismatched pair searches the city finding Kasady in the hospital, still screaming in pain. Upon immediately seeing Kasady, the symbiote re-bonds with Kasady, but to ensure Carnage will never hurt any one else again, The Surfer encases Carnage in an unbreakable shell of ethereal energy.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

In a ''[[What If (comics)|What If?]]'' storyline, the symbiote remained bonded to the Surfer, forcing Spider-Man and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] to battle him until [[Firestar]] was able to use her powers to disrupt the symbiote's control over the Surfer. After his powers were used to destroy dozens of New York City blocks and realizing that there was only one way to stop the symbiote, the Silver Surfer flew himself into the sun, seemingly destroying both himself and the creature.<ref>''What If?'' vol. 2 #108</ref>

===Exiles===
On Earth 552, Norrin Radd had been a great military scientist who accidentally destroyed his own world with his greatest invention. Determined to bring it back to existence, he approached [[Galactus#Exiles|Galactus]], Restorer of Worlds, and became his herald in the hope that Galactus would resurrect his world in exchange for his service. However, Galactus had taken an oath to only revive those worlds destroyed by the Blight. An enraged Silver Surfer then turned against his master, destroying those who worshiped him and attempting to kill Galactus himself in order to steal the knowledge of world restoration. This led to the destruction of Earth, the coming of the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]], the deaths of the [[Shi'ar]] [[Imperial Guard (comics)|Imperial Elite Guard]], and inevitably the Surfer's own destruction at the claws of a cosmically empowered [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]].<ref name="exiles87">{{cite web

===Marvel Zombies===
The Silver Surfer is a victim of the ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'' on [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Earth-2149]]. Instead of coming to Earth and meeting the Fantastic Four, he is attacked by a horde of zombies.  After fighting valiantly, he is killed by the [[Alternate versions of the Hulk#Marvel Zombies|Hulk]], and his body is devoured by a few of the zombies (Hulk, [[Alternate versions of Captain America#Marvel Zombies|Colonel America]], [[Henry Pym|Giant-Man]], [[Iron Man]], [[Luke Cage]], [[Alternate versions of Wolverine#Marvel Zombies|Wolverine]], and [[Alternate versions of Spider-Man#Marvel Zombies|Spider-Man]]). His corpse grants the zombies a portion each of his cosmic powers, which they use to kill all of the other zombie heroes and villains whom they consider "competition" for what's left of the living. Afterwards, Pym creates a machine that concentrates the Cosmic powers they all share to create a massive blast that kills [[Galactus#Marvel Zombies|Galactus]], at which point they eat him. Now imbued with the Silver Surfer's powers (and realizing they can now fly and survive in space), They travel through the cosmos preying on the rest of the universe, picking it clean.<ref name="marvelzombies5">''Marvel Zombies'' #5'' (April 2006)</ref>

===MC2===
During the finale of ''[[Last Planet Standing]]'', the Silver Surfer foils Galactus' plan to create a new Big Bang, merging with Galactus himself in the process to become a new being. Gaining control of Galactus' powers, the new entity undoes the damage done by the old Galactus.<ref name="lastplanetstanding5">''Last Planet Standing'' #5 (July 2006)</ref>

===The Keeper===
In the [[alternate history|alternate timeline]] of Earth-691, notably the [[Guardians of the Galaxy]] issues #24 and #25 story arc, Norrin Radd was featured as The Keeper. This new version of the Silver Surfer sans his surfboard had [[Quantum bands|Quantum Bands]], which augmented his "Power Cosmic" and designated him as the Protector of the Universe, as with other bearers of the Bands before him. He works with the Guardians in an attempt to kill Galactus once and for all, his first attempt with [[Firelord (comics)|Firelord]] and Dargo-Thor having failed.  Eventually, the Keeper realizes that, with his augmented power, he can supply Galactus with the energy he needs and end the Planet-Eater's consumption of worlds.  [[Eon (comics)|Eon]], cosmic being and creator of the Quantum Bands, reveals that this was the ultimate purpose of the Keeper becoming the Protector of the Universe, and he enters into a symbiotic partnership with Galactus, who accepts the Keeper as an equal; he is last seen leaving with Galactus, riding a silver surfboard once more.

===Earth X/Universe X/Paradise X===
In issue 11 and 12 of the ''[[Earth X]]'' series, [[Black Bolt]] calls upon [[Galactus#Earth X|Galactus]] to come destroy the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]] seed growing within Earth.  The Silver Surfer accompanies him along with his love Shalla-Bal, who had now been turned into a silver herald of Galactus as well.

===Elseworlds===
In ''Green Lantern/Silver Surfer'', the Silver Surfer confronts [[Hank Henshaw|Cyborg Superman]] over the destruction of a planet and is met by [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]]. Parallax beats the Cyborg, but the Silver Surfer lets him go and tries to sympathize with Parallax. The two return to Earth to find [[Kyle Rayner]] with Thanos, leading them to believe they formed an alliance. Kyle convinces the Surfer to help him stop Parallax and Thanos from destroying the universe and that he was duped into giving Thanos Oa's power. The Surfer was similarly gave most of his power to Parallax to reform the destroyed planet. Kyle channels the power from the two villains into the Silver Surfer, who opens a portal and sucks the two inside.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

[[Image:surfertoon.jpg|thumb|upright|The Silver Surfer from the animated series ''[[Silver Surfer (TV series)|Silver Surfer]]''.]]
* In 1998, the Surfer starred in a [[Silver Surfer (TV series)|solo animated series]] on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Network]] voiced by Paul Essiembre. Blending [[cel-shaded animation|cel]] and [[computer animation]], this series was rendered in the style of Surfer creator [[Jack Kirby]], and faithfully incorporated much of the comic book history. Further adventures included appearances by many characters from Marvel's "cosmic" stable, including [[Thanos]], the [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]], [[Ego the Living Planet]], Mentor, [[Drax the Destroyer]], [[Pip the Troll]], [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]], and the [[Kree]] and [[Skrull]] empires, their roles sometimes differing from their comic book incarnations but often adhering closely. It received good ratings, but was canceled after only one season of thirteen episodes due to politics between [[Marvel Toys|Toy Biz]] and [[Saban Entertainment]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} The series ended on a cliffhanger. Eight further episodes for the next season were written but never animated.

* The Silver Surfer comic book also appeared in an episode of [[Volume One: Genesis|''Heroes'' Season 1]].<ref name="ssscripts">{{cite web

* Silver Surfer appears in ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]'' voiced by [[Mikey Kelley]]. This version of him has a literal "surfer dude" accent, and is much more kid friendly, but the third episode develops more on his personality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0907/28/voices.htm |title=Comics Continuum |publisher=Comics Continuum |date=2009-07-28 |accessdate=2010-12-26}}</ref> The episode "Invader from the Dark Dimension" reveals that he is a horrible cook (due in large to a lack of [[taste buds]]), so much so that even Dr. Doom fears his meals. His teammates have trouble living with him due to his strange personality; such as reversing gravity so that everyone can have breakfast upside down on the ceiling. In the episode "The Last Exit Before Doomsday" he makes the first reference to his past working for Galactus, after the appearance of Stardust another one of his heralds. In the show he describes Galactus not as eating planets whole but rather "Taking several bites and chewing thoroughly". In "This Al Dente Earth," Silver Surfer persuades Galactus to spare Earth promising to find planets with non-intelligent life for Galactus to feast upon. Upon leaving the Super Hero Squad, Silver Surfer takes the possession of the Infinity Sword (which he revealed that it can only be wielded by someone who wields the Infinity Gauntlet) and leaves with Galactus to find planets with non-intelligent life.

The movie incarnation differs from his comics counterpart in that instead of having innate power (the [[Power Cosmic]]), his power comes from the surfboard itself, which also serves as a beacon for Galactus.

===Video games===
* The ''[[Silver Surfer (video game)|Silver Surfer]]'' video game, developed by [[Software Creations (UK)|Software Creations]], Ltd., debuted on the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] in 1990. The game is notorious for its unforgiving and extremely steep difficulty.<ref name="ssvg">{{cite web

* Silver Surfer makes a cameo in the original ''[[Spider-Man (2000 video game)|Spider-Man]]'' videogame. If the player has Debug mode on during the helicopter chase scene, then there will be a blimp with Spider-Man on it to jump to instead of going through the whole level.

In the beginning of said level, the Silver Surfer is seen flying by.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

* He is a bonus character in the game ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'' voiced by [[Chris Cox (actor)|Chris Cox]].

===Cultural references===
{{trivia | date = September 2010}}
Numerous films, songs, books, and television shows have referenced the Silver Surfer since his 1960s debut. In the [[1983 in film|1983]] film ''[[Breathless (1983 film)|Breathless]]'', [[Richard Gere]]'s character was an avid fan of his comics. In [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s [[1992 in film|1992]] ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]'' a Silver Surfer poster is clearly seen in Mr. Orange's apartment. The musical group [[Swollen Members]] are fans of the comics and on the album cover of ''Blackout'' he is seen. In [[Futurama Comics]], [[Bender Bending Rodríguez|Bender]] accidentally deactivates the autopilot of the Planet Express ship, causing the ship to fly out of control, knock the Silver Surfer off his board, then enter a [[Space Invaders]] video game style battle. In the [[1995 in film|1995]] film ''[[Crimson Tide (film)|Crimson Tide]]'', two submarine crew members argue over the merits of the alternate Silver Surfer versions as drawn by Kirby and Moebius.
