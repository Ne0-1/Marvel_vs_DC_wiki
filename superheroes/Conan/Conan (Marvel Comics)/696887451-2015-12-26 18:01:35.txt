'''Conan''' is a [[fiction]]al [[Character (arts)|character]] based on [[Robert E. Howard]]'s [[Conan the Barbarian]]. He was introduced to the comic book world in [[1970 in comics|1970]] with ''[[Conan the Barbarian (comics)|Conan the Barbarian]]'', written by [[Roy Thomas]], illustrated by [[Barry Windsor-Smith|Barry Smith]] and published by [[Marvel Comics]].

The highly successful ''Conan the Barbarian'' series spawned the more adult, black-and-white ''[[Savage Sword of Conan]]'' in 1974 (published as part of [[List of magazines released by Marvel Comics in the 1970s|Marvel's line of black-and-white magazines]]). Written by Thomas with most art by [[John Buscema]] or [[Alfredo Alcala]], ''Savage Sword of Conan'' soon became one of the most popular comic series of the 1970s and is now considered a cult classic.

The Marvel Conan stories were also adapted as a newspaper [[comic strip]] which appeared daily and Sunday from September 4, 1978, to April 12, 1981. Originally written by Thomas and illustrated by Buscema, the strip was continued by several different Marvel artists and writers.

Marvel ceased publishing all Conan titles in 2000. In 2003, [[Dark Horse Comics]] acquired the license to publish the character.
