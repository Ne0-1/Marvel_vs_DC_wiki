'''Centurious''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]].

Centurious was a servant of [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] and an enemy of [[Zarathos]].  In combating Zarathos, he became a regular foe of the first [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]].

==Fictional character biography==
In prehistoric times, the man who would come to be known as Centurious was the prince of an [[Amerindian]] tribe. He bargained his soul to [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] in order to combat the [[Demons (Marvel Comics)|demon]] [[Zarathos]] and save the woman he loved, becoming a soulless immortal in the process.<ref>revealed in ''Ghost Rider'' Vol. 2 #77</ref> He lived many lifetimes and learned many things over the following centuries. In Ancient Egypt, he studied the mystic arts, and acquired the Crystal of Souls.<ref>revealed in ''Ghost Rider'' Vol. 2 #80</ref> He had many occupations, aliases, and wives in the years to come, including that of the owner of a Louisiana plantation.

In modern times, he first encountered and battled Johnny Blaze, the [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]].<ref>''Ghost Rider'' Vol. 2 #74</ref> He used Reverend Dombue to control the town of Holly.  Centurious battled the Ghost Rider again, trapping Johnny Blaze in the soul crystal.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' Vol. 2 #80</ref> The soul crystal was shattered by the Ghost Rider, which freed John Blaze's soul from the soul crystal. Centurious and Zarathos were then trapped within the soul crystal, battling each other.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' Vol. 2 #81</ref>

Years later, Centurious was revealed to have granted supernatural powers to Reverend Styge, the third [[Sin-Eater (comics)#Other Sin-Eaters|Sin-Eater]]. Centurious disciplined Styge after his defeat by the second [[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Ghost Rider]], Daniel Ketch.<ref>''Ghost Rider'' Vol. 3 #18</ref> Centurious set [[Steel Wind (comics)|Steel Wind]] and [[Steel Vengeance]] against the new Ghost Rider and John Blaze.<ref>''Spirits of Vengeance'' #7</ref> [[Hag and Troll|Hag, Troll]], and [[Deathwatch (comics)|Deathwatch]] were turned over to Centurious by Steel Wind and Steel Vengeance.<ref>''Spirits of Vengeance'' #9</ref> He then set the [[Firm (comics)|Firm]] against Ghost Rider and [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]].  Centurious killed his minion Mr. Stern for disobeying orders, and captured [[Heart Attack (comics)|Heart Attack]]. His identity as the head of the Firm was revealed,<ref>''Ghost Rider'' Vol. 3 #37</ref> as was his face finally revealed.<ref>''Spirits of Vengeance'' #10</ref> He again battled Ghost Rider, and formed an alliance with the [[Lilin (comics)|Lilin]].<ref>''Spirits of Vengeance'' #11</ref>

After Centurious almost killed Dan Ketch's mother, Dan was enraged and turned into Ghost Rider. He battled Centurious and out of nowhere, a spirit-like body comes out of Centurious' chest. This spirit was Zarathos and it was revealed that Zarathos had been hiding inside Centurious all along. Zarathos was also the reason why Centurious had become very powerful. He lost a great amount of power after Zarathos left his body, but he still retained his former power. Lilith manipulated Zarathos by convincing him he was her son, and he joined her. Then Lilith declares that Centurious is useless and that she no longer needs him, now that she has Zarathos. Centurious is enraged and attacks Lilith. However Pilgrim, Lilith's son, uses his claws and slices his chest, greviously wounding him. Pilgrim wants him to suffer and waits for his other brother, Outcast, to finish Centurious off. Before that happens, Centurious attacks Lilith yet again, and Zarathos uses his energy to hurl Centurious in the sky. Everyone thinks he is dead after that.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

In later issues, it was revealed that he wasn't dead. He was still recovering from the wounds he had received by the Lilin and Zarathos. John Blaze finds out that he's alive with the use of his psychic friend, Claire, and goes after Centurious, as does Steel Wind, when Blaze tells him he's alive. He searches for him in the sewers and is captured by Centurious' demons. Blaze tries to attack with his knife but Centurious kicks it off and takes his gun from him too. Steel Wind returns just before Centurious can kill Blaze. He asks him if he would like to do it instead. Steel Wind betrays Centurious and attacks him and his demons instead. He states that Zarathos may have taken his soul, but he took his humanity and killed his brother, Steel Vengeance. Before he can kill him, Blaze intervenes and says that if he kills him, then he'll give her last piece of humanity to him, thus making him an emotionless cold killer. He agrees, thanks Blaze and rides off. Blaze, however, can never forgive Centurious. He takes his gun and shoots Centurious in the head, seemingly killing him.<ref>Blaze #13</ref>

===Siege===
Centurious had in fact survived Blaze's wrath.  During the [[Siege (comics)|Siege]] of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], Centurious was seen along with other Ghost Rider villains, [[Deathwatch (comics)|Deathwatch]], [[Blackout (comics)#Half-demon|Blackout]], and [[Scarecrow (Marvel Comics)|Scarecrow]] as members of The [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s crime syndicate.<ref>''New Avengers'' #64</ref> His current status is unknown.

==Unresolved Plot==
{{Original research|section|date=June 2010}}
Centurious, like Ghost Rider, has left readers with various dangling character issues. His origin although explained in his first appearance has been contradicted or expanded upon. There are still some questions that remain unanswered. When Ghost Rider (Danny Ketch) removed Centurious' mask Ghost Rider immediately says he looks like someone familiar. Who he resembles has never been revealed. One theory circulating amongst fans is either  Centurious may have lied about his origins, or like Ghost Rider does not fully remember the events of his past. This still leaves the question of who was Centurious and why did Ghost Rider seem to recognize him? Although never revealed there are hints that Centurious may have been [[Pastor Kale]] the father of [[Noble Kale]] who would become a Ghost Rider entity. When last seen Pastor Kale had survived the events of the 17th century well into the 21st.<ref>Ghost Rider #-1</ref> His immortality is never explained but like Centurious this is their common denominator. Until the story line revolving Centurious is ironed out, fans are left to speculate

==Powers and abilities==
Centurious was conferred with immortality upon selling his soul to [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]].  Over his long life, he has become an adept practitioner of the mystic arts.  He has the ability to manipulate the forces of magic to magically enhance his strength, durability, and stamina, to control the natural elements of earth, air, fire, and water, for the abilities of [[telekinesis]], [[levitation (paranormal)|levitation]], illusion-casting, and mental control of some lower animals and of humans under certain circumstances.

Centurious once used the Crystal of Souls, a power source for his abilities that imprisoned the souls of his victims.

Centurious is proficient in various hand-to-hand combat techniques learned over many ages, but prefers not to engage in physical combat.
