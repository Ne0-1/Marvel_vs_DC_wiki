'''The Enchantress''' is a [[DC Comics]] character who has been both a [[superhero|superheroine]] and [[supervillain]]ess. She first appeared in [[DC Comics#The Golden Age|National Comics]] (now DC Comics) flagship science fiction anthology title ''[[Strange Adventures]]'' #187 (April 1966), and was created by writer [[Bob Haney]] and artist [[Howard Purcell]].

More recently she is usually called simply '''Enchantress'''

== Publication history ==

The Enchantress ('The Switcheroo-Witcheroo' as she was bannered on the cover) first appeared in the 9-page lead story in ''Strange Adventures'' #187 (April 1966), followed by two further 8-page appearances in the same title: ''Strange Adventures'' #191 (August 1966) and #200 (May 1967), all written by Bob Haney and drawn by co-creator Howard Purcell. The first two stories were reprinted in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' #417 (March 1972) and #419 (May 1972), her only appearances in the 1970s. Following this, the Enchantress appeared in two linked [[Supergirl]] tales in [[Superman Family]] #204 - 205 (November/December 1980 - January/February 1981), and in a two-part story featuring The Forgotten Villains in the Superman team-up title ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' #77 - 78 (January - February 1985). She was one of the super-characters in ''[[Legends_(comics)|Legends]]'' #3 (January 1987) and ''Legends'' #6 (April 1987), followed by the origin of the [[Suicide Squad]] in ''[[Secret Origins]]'' vol 2 #14 (May 1987) and the immediately following ''Suicide Squad'' series issues #1 - 8 (May 1987 - December 1987) and #12 - 16 (April 1988 - August 1988), written by [[John Ostrander]] and [[Len Wein]]; and ''[[The Spectre]]'' vol 2 #11 (February 1988). 

After being ignored for eleven years, she eventually returned in ''[[Green Lantern]]'' vol 3 #118 (November 1999) and ''[[Day of Judgment (comics)|Day of Judgment]]'' #1 - 5 (all November 1999), written by [[Geoff Johns]] with art by Matt Smith and Steve Mitchell. She next guested in another DC Comics miniseries ''JLA: Black Baptism'' #1 - 4 (May - August 2001) by Sean Smith (writer) and Ruben Diaz (art) after which Enchantress disappeared again until the ''[[Day of Vengeance]]'' miniseries #1 - 5 (June 2005 - November 2005) by [[Bill Willingham]], who also used her character through the first 16 issues (July 2006 - October 2007) of the [[Shadowpact]] series that followed directly on from ''Day of Vengeance''. [[Matthew Sturges]] took up the reins from issue #17 - 25 (November 2007 - July 2008). During that time she also made appearances in the major DC Comics cross-over series ''Countdown'', #28 (October 17th 2007) and #28 (October 24th 2007), the associated ''Countdown to Mystery'' #1 (November 2007), and one issue of ''[[Captain_Marvel_Jr.|Trials of Shazam!]]'', #11 (March 2008). 

Since the cancellation of ''Shadowpact'', Enchantress has continued to make minor appearances in the DC Universe, including ''DC Universe Holiday Special'' (2008), and the miniseries ''[[Reign in Hell]]'' #2 - 8 (September 2008 - April 2009). She has most recently appeared in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #885 (March 2010), part of a new cycle of stories by [[James_Robinson_(comics)|James Robinson]] which leads up to DC Comics Summer 2010 event '[[War of the Supermen]]'.

However, in her next appearance, the Enchantress is a misguided character fighting Supergirl, who prevents her gaining omnipotent magical power and cancelling all other superpowers on Earth, twice.<ref>"The Earthquake Enchantment" in ''Superman Family'' #204 (November/December 1980)</ref><ref>"Magic Over Miami" in ''Superman Family'' #205 (January/February 1981)</ref><ref>'note: after the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' event, this was [[retcon|retconned]] to have been [[Power Girl]] instead of Supergirl, as Supergirl had been removed from DC continuity''</ref> Her villainous side takes over after this, and the Enchantress then continues her career as a member of The Forgotten Villains;<ref>""Triad of Terror" in ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' #77 (January 1985) and "The Triad" in ''DC Comics Presents'' #78 (February 1985)</ref> and part of the army of supervillains during the '[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]' event.<ref>''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' #12 (March 1986)</ref> 

=== ''Suicide Squad'' ===
{{main|Suicide Squad}}

She is next recruited into the newly formed 'Task Force X', soon to be known as the '[[Suicide Squad]]', on the offer that they could keep her villainous side in check. In her first mission she uses massive magical energy to defeat [[Brimstone_(comics)|Brimstone]], which sends her over the edge and she becomes temporarily truly villainous.<ref>"Send For the Suicide Squad!" in ''[[Legends (comics)|Legends]]'' #3 (January, 1987)</ref> During her tenure with the Suicide Squad, June Moon's control over her Enchantress side becomes weaker, and she wrecks at least one mission because of this;<ref>"The Flight of the Firebird" in ''Suicide Squad'' #5 (September 1987), "Hitting the Fan" in ''Suicide Squad'' #6 (October 1987) and "Thrown to the Wolves" in ''Suicide Squad'' #8 (November 1987</ref> teammate [[Deadshot]] is tasked with taking her out should she get beyond control. Eventually [[Madame Xanadu]] diagnoses that June's loss of control is because she began using her powers before she could control them, and the only way to counteract this is not to use them until her aura, which protects her from the evil influences in magic, regains its power. Madame Xanadu gives June a necklace that she cannot remove, which together with a ring to be held by someone else creates a feedback loop preventing the Enchantress from using magic for evil as a temporary measure.<ref>"Personal Files" in ''Suicide Squad'' #8 (December 1987)</ref><ref>"Blood and Snow part 2" in ''Suicide Squad'' #12 (April 1988</ref> June then discovers that her Enchantress persona is in fact a separate evil entity from another dimension fused with her, not simply a manifestation of magic. This entity is ripped from her by a demon called the Incubus, <ref>"Devil to Pay" in ''Suicide Squad'' #15 (July 1988)</ref> and shortly afterward June disappears from the Suicide Squad for unknown reasons. Nothing else is heard of June Moon or the Enchantress for eleven years.

=== ''Day of Judgment'' ===
{{main|Day of Judgment (comics)}}

Eleven years later, after a storm caused by war in [[Hell_(DC_Comics)|Hell]], June breaks free from the Ostrander Mental Institute in New Jersey,<ref>note: a reference to ''Suicide Squad'' writer John Ostrander''</ref> where she has been for an indeterminate time.<ref>"The Summoning" in ''Day of Judgment'' #1 (February 1999)</ref><ref>''note: which presents some continuity issues: according to the "Day of Judgment Timeline" - a text piece in 'Day Of Judgment: Secret Files and Origins' (1999) June Moon/The Enchantress was left imprisoned in the Nightshade Dimension three years prior, which concatenates accepted DC history for the Suicide Squad. The piece also explains her appearance on Earth in ''Day of Judgment'' as 'she is later freed under mysterious and unrevealed circumstances'.'' 
''A further continuity complication occurs with "Millenium Then" in '[[Resurrection Man]]' #25 (July 1999) where the Enchantress is shown as part of The Forgotten Villains - although as this takes place in the distant past and she shows her earlier more darkly evil side, could be explained by her being plucked from an earlier time''</ref> Refusing to join with the superheroes fighting a demon invasion on Earth and in Hell, the newly freed Enchantress is possessed by [[Deadman]] to manipulate her into helping the fight in Hell.<ref>"Lost Souls" in ''Day of Judgment'' #2 (November 1999)</ref> Once there, June's Enchantress persona is murdered by [[Sebastian Faust|Faust]] as a purely evil act, the only way to reignite the fires of [[Hell]].<ref>"The End of the World As We Know It" in ''Day of Judgment'' #4 (November 1999)</ref>

=== ''JLA: Black Baptism'' ===

June Moon is left in a semi-catatonic state after the removal of her Enchantress persona, and is committed to 'Elysium Fields Sanitarium' outside [[Detroit]].<ref>"Trials in Darkness" in ''JLA: Black Baptism'' Book 2 (June 2001)</ref> Faust removes her from the sanitarium, and reunites her with her Enchantress persona - who had not been killed by him and has been masquerading as 'Anita Souleata', a [[succubus]] working with a group of [[Mafia]]-styled demons to create a gateway to Hell and resurrect Hermes Trismegestus (a mad sorceror who wanted to destroy life on Earth). When June and the Enchantress are re-combined, a new entity called Soulsinger is temporarily created, which fades away shortly after, leaving Enchantress behind - once again a separate entity, but cut off from her powers. June Moon is taken to be looked after by [[Doctor Occult]].<ref>"Final Sacrament" in ''JLA: Black Baptism'' Book 4 (August 2001)</ref>

=== ''Day of Vengeance'' ===
{{main|Day of Vengeance}}

[[Ragman]] digs Enchantress out from under a destroyed forest after the Spectre, bent on killing all magical beings and places on Earth, kills nearly 700 sorcerors, only breaking off when attacked.<ref>"One Last Drink at the Edge of Time" in ''Day of Vengeance'' #1 (June 2005)</ref> Enchantress slowly seduces the Spectre mentally from the safety of the pocket-dimensional '[[Oblivion Bar]]', where many magical entities have gone to escape him. She then leaves to challenge the Spectre on Earth, having first created a gun that can kill her should she turn evil again, and offering it to Ragman.<ref>"Some Enchantress Evening" in ''Day of Vengeance" #2 (July 2005)</ref> However, when she overloads again while channeling power from nearly everyone on Earth with magic capabilities to Captain Marvel so that he can defeat the Spectre,<ref>"A Hot Night in Budapest" in ''Day of Vengeance'' #3 (August 2005)</ref> she is put out of action by a punch from [[Blue Devil]] instead.<ref>"Monkey Business" in ''Day of Vengeance'' #4 (September 2005)</ref> Recovering quickly enough to devise a plan to lure the Spectre into a trap,<ref>"The Particle Theory of Darkness" in ''Day of Vengeance'' #5 (October 2005)</ref> Enchantress helps with the reconstruction of the Rock of Eternity in [[Gotham_City|Gotham]], after facing Doctor Occult, who has been possessed by the spirit of Envy.<ref>"The Ninth Age of Magic" in ''Day Of Vengeance: Infinite Crisis Special #1 (March 2006)</ref>

During the 'Day of Vengeance', Enchantress, Ragman, Blue Devil, and a number of other magical entities form the super-team 'Shadowpact'. 

=== ''Shadowpact'' ===
{{main|Shadowpact}}

Shadowpact are summoned by the [[Phantom Stranger]] when the town of Riverrock, [[Wyoming]] is entrapped in a giant bubble of blood and endangered by 'The Pentacle', a team of supervillains,<ref>"Death in a Small Town" in ''Shadowpact'' #1 (July 2006)</ref> whose goal is to sacrifice the townspeople in order to summon the Sun King, an ancient rogue god from another dimension. Thirty-seven people perish before Shadowpact manage to defeat them; Enchantress is able to tap into the magical powers of Strega, one of The Pentacle and destroy the bubble from within. She also kills one of The Pentacle, White Bunny, on the spur of the moment after he leaves them and frees Shadowpact.<ref>"The Short Year of Living Dangerously" in ''Shadowpact #3 (September 2006)</ref> Due to unexpected side effects of the magic spells needed to defeat the villains, the outside world believe that Shadowpact has been dead for a year, and they are honored with a team statue set inside a park in [[Metropolis_(comics)|Metropolis]].<ref>"One Year Later" in ''Shadowpact #5 (November 2006)</ref>

Enchantress then helps Ragman defeat an assassin sent to kill him, in the course of which they are attacked by the [[Wild Hunt]] of legend and temporarily transformed into mystical hellhounds.<ref>"The Wild Hunt" in ''Shadowpact'' #6 (December 2006)</ref> Shortly after, her spells are all that save [[Nightmaster|Jim Rook, Nightmaster]], after he is stabbed by his own sword fighting [[Etrigan the Demon]]; staying at his side for days without sleep and keeping him alive by trading a day of her life for a day of his until he heals himself by the power of his sword.<ref>''Shadowpact'' #9 - 11 (March - May 2007)</ref> After Shadowpact are seconded to [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]] to infiltrate [[Kobra_(comics)|Kobra's]] organization,<ref>''Checkmate'' vol 2 #9 - 10 (February - March 2008)</ref> she then helps foil Doctor Gotham's plan to destroy [[Chicago]] by entering his inter-dimensional cloak and destroying most of the thousands of magical artifacts contained within.<ref>"Down in the Zero" in ''Shadowpact'' #16 (October 2007)</ref> She takes an apprentice, Laura Fell, the Warlock's Daughter<ref>"Proteges" in ''Shadowpact'' #17 (November 2007)</ref> before they both unwittingly almost allow a race of mindless creatures 'The Unbound' to reach Earth while creating a portal to the Land of Nightshades, where Nightmaster, [[Nightshade (comics)|Nightshade]], and Ragman are trapped. She frees her colleagues and the inhabitants of the Nightshades Dimension by creating a magical virus to combat the mage-created virus that created The Unbound - mixing a possessed creatures' soul with the essence of Nightmaster's virtues. When Nightmaster decides to stay in the Nightshade Dimension, Enchantress kisses him.<ref>''Shadowpact'' #18 - 22 (December 2007 - April 2008)</ref><ref>''note: a minor theme from earlier is that Enchantress hates men. On one occasion Ragman kisses her and she recoils ('Day of Vengeance' #1), and the same happens with Blue Devil ('Day of Vengeance' #3). It is later hinted that she may have been abused, although this may have been a demonic-induced torture. This vignette could be an indication that her feelings may have simply been altered by the removal of the evil Enchantress persona''</ref> On returning to Earth, she participates in the final battle against the Sun King.<ref>''Shadowpact'' #23 - 25 (May 2008 - July 2008)</ref>

Shadowpact, including Enchantress have most recently been seen helping [[Captain Atom]] return to Mirabai's dimension - where General [[Sam Lane]] ([[Lois Lane|Lois Lane's]] father) has moved the main base of his secret anti-[[Kryptonian]] 'Project 7734'.<ref>"Captain Atom part 7" in ''Action Comics'' #885 (March 2010)</ref>

== Powers and abilities ==

Enchantress is a powerful sorceress.  She appears to possess the ability to manipulate magical energy for any number of effects, from healing to teleportation, and can directly affect any non-living objects with her magic. She can also walk through walls.

A unique aspect of her power is her sensitivity to magic.  She was able to link to the essence of [[Eclipso]] in the ''Day of Vengeance'' storyline, using the connection to speak Eclipso's thoughts to the rest of the group, and has also mystically tracked the Spectre by divining his magical trail. She has also been seen to remotely access another magic-user's power, as she did when she channeled the power of almost all magical beings on Earth through her to Captain Marvel to aid him in his battle with the Spectre, and again with Strega of The Pentacle.

Enchantress always has a roll of duct tape on her person. After using it to tie up and gag a prisoner, she is asked by Nightmaster why she carries it, to which she confusedly replies, '' 'What -- don't you?' ''<ref>"Come Together" in ''Shadowpact'' #22 (April 2008)</ref> 

After the ''Strange Adventures'' run, the evil Enchantress side manifested whenever June Moon changed. Later, her evil side manifested only when was under great magical stress which overloaded her, and she returned to normal once the overload subsided. This is no longer the case since the 'Soulsinger' identity separated the evil Enchantress entity without her powers before dissipating, leaving June Moon with the Enchantress power but not the evil personality.

She has possession of Nightwitch's 'Herne-Ramsgate Cauldron', which allows her to find almost every magical creature in the DC Universe.<ref>"Reversals" in ''Shadowpact'' #19 (January 2008)</ref>
