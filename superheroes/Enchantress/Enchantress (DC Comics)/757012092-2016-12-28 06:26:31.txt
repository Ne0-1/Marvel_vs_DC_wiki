'''Enchantress''', also known as '''June Moone''', is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic books]] published by [[DC Comics]]. The character was created by writer [[Bob Haney]] and artist [[Howard Purcell]], and first appeared in ''[[Strange Adventures]]'' #187 (April 1966). The character has periodically been depicted as taking the role of an [[antihero]].

The Enchantress made her live-action cinematic debut in the 2016 film ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'', portrayed by [[Cara Delevingne]].

She next guest starred in another DC Comics miniseries ''JLA: Black Baptism'' #1&ndash;4 (May&ndash;August 2001) by Sean Smith (writer) and Ruben Diaz (art) after which Enchantress disappeared again until the ''[[Day of Vengeance]]'' miniseries #1&ndash;5 (June 2005&ndash;November 2005) by [[Bill Willingham]], who also used her character through the first 16 issues (July 2006 - October 2007) of the ''[[Shadowpact]]'' series that followed directly on from ''Day of Vengeance''.

Since the cancellation of ''Shadowpact'', the Enchantress has continued to make minor appearances in the DC Universe, including ''DC Universe Holiday Special'' (2008), and the miniseries ''[[Reign in Hell]]'' #2&ndash;8 (September 2008&ndash;April 2009). She appeared in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #885 (March 2010), part of a new cycle of stories by [[James Robinson (writer)|James Robinson]] which lead up to the DC Comics summer 2010 event '[[War of the Supermen]]'.

Their first enemy was Enchantress gone mad.

She is next recruited into the newly formed 'Task Force X', soon to be known as the '[[Suicide Squad]]', on the offer that she could keep their villainous side in check. In her first mission, she uses massive magical energy to defeat [[Brimstone (comics)|Brimstone]], which sends her over the edge and she becomes temporarily truly villainous.<ref name="Legends3" /> During her tenure with the Suicide Squad, June Moone's control over her Enchantress side becomes weaker, and she destroys at least one mission because of this;<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Ostrander, John|penciller= McDonnell, Luke|inker= Lewis, Bob|story= The Flight of the Firebird|title= [[Suicide Squad]]|issue= 5|date= September 1987}}<br/>{{cite comic|writer= Ostrander, John|penciller= McDonnell, Luke|inker= Lewis, Bob|story= Hitting the Fan|title= Suicide Squad|issue= 6|date= October 1987}}<br/>{{cite comic|writer= Ostrander, John|penciller= McDonnell, Luke|inker= Lewis, Bob|story= Thrown to the Wolves|title= Suicide Squad|issue= 7|date= November 1987}}</ref> teammate [[Deadshot]] is tasked with taking her out should she get beyond control. Eventually, [[Madame Xanadu]] diagnoses that June's loss of control is because she began using her powers before she could control them, and the only way to counteract this is not to use them until her aura, which protects her from the evil influences in magic, regains its power. Madame Xanadu gives June a necklace that she cannot remove, which together with a ring to be held by someone else creates a feedback loop preventing the Enchantress from using magic for evil as a temporary measure. She also raises an army to destroy the town and perform terror attacks as stated in the first mission.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Ostrander, John|penciller= McDonnell, Luke|inker= Lewis, Bob|story= Personal Files|title= Suicide Squad|issue= 8|date= December 1987}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic|writer= Ostrander, John|penciller= McDonnell, Luke|inker= Lewis, Bob|story= Blood and Snow, Part Two|title= Suicide Squad|issue= 12|date= April 1988}}</ref> June then discovers that her Enchantress persona is in fact a separate evil entity from another dimension fused with her, not simply a manifestation of magic.

The piece also explains her appearance on Earth in ''Day of Judgment'' as "she is later freed under mysterious and unrevealed circumstances". A further continuity complication occurs with "Millenium Then" in ''[[Resurrection Man (comics)|Resurrection Man]]'' #25 (July 1999) where the Enchantress is shown as part of the Forgotten Villains – although as this takes place in the distant past and she shows her earlier more darkly evil side, could be explained by her being plucked from an earlier time.|group=Note|name=note6}} Refusing to join with the superheroes fighting a demon invasion on Earth and in Hell, the newly freed Enchantress is possessed by [[Deadman]] to manipulate her into helping the fight in Hell.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Johns, Geoff|penciller= Smith, Matt|inker= Mitchell, Steve|story= Lost Souls|title= Day of Judgment|issue= 2|date= November 1999}}</ref> Once there, June's Enchantress persona is murdered by [[Sebastian Faust|Faust]] as a purely evil act, the only way to reignite the fires of [[Hell]].<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Johns, Geoff|penciller= Smith, Matt|inker= Mitchell, Steve|story= The End of the World as We Know It|title= Day of Judgment|issue= 4|date= November 1999}}</ref>

When June and the Enchantress are re-combined, a new entity called Soulsinger is temporarily created, which fades away shortly after, leaving Enchantress behind – once again a separate entity, but cut off from her powers. June Moone is taken to be looked after by [[Doctor Occult]].<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Diaz, Ruben; Smith, Sean|penciller= Saiz, Jesus|inker= Champagne, Keith|story= Final Sacrament|title= JLA: Black Baptism|issue= 4|date= August 2001}}</ref>

===The New 52===

In 2011 DC Comics canceled all their titles and relaunched 52 new comics as part of [[The New 52]]. One of these was ''[[Justice League Dark]]'' which features a number of supernatural themed heroes including [[Shade, the Changing Man]], [[Zatanna]], [[John Constantine]], and [[Madame Xanadu]] coming together to fight an insane Enchantress who has become separated from June Moone.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= [[Peter Milligan|Milligan, Peter]]|penciller= [[Mikel Janin|Janin, Mikel]]|inker= Janin, Mikel|story= In The Dark Part One: Imaginary Women|title= [[Justice League Dark]]|issue= 1|date= November 2011}}</ref> John Constantine deduces that Madame Xanadu said an incantation that separated June Moone from Enchantress and read an incantation that reversed the spell.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Milligan, Peter|penciller= Janin, Mikel|inker= Janin, Mikel|story= In The Dark Part Two: Dark Matter|title= Justice League Dark|issue= 2|date= December 2011}}<br/>{{cite comic|writer= Milligan, Peter|penciller= Janin, Mikel|inker= Janin, Mikel|story= In The Dark Part Three: Shibboleths and Alcohol|title= Justice League Dark|issue= 3|date= January 2012}}<br/>{{cite comic|writer= Milligan, Peter|penciller= Janin, Mikel|inker= Janin, Mikel|story= In the Dark, Part Four: By the Light of the Moone|title= Justice League Dark|issue= 4|date= February 2012}}<br/>{{cite comic|writer= Milligan, Peter|penciller= Janin, Mikel|inker= Janin, Mikel|story= In The Dark, Finale: There Was a Crooked Man|title= Justice League Dark|issue= 5|date= March 2012}}</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Enchantress is a powerful sorceress. She appears to possess the ability to manipulate magical energy for any number of effects, from healing to teleportation, and can directly affect any non-living objects with her magic. She can also walk through walls.

A unique aspect of her power is her sensitivity to magic. She was able to link to the essence of [[Eclipso]] in the ''Day of Vengeance'' story line, using the connection to speak Eclipso's thoughts to the rest of the group, and has also mystically tracked the Spectre by divining his magical trail. She has also been seen to remotely access another magic-user's power, as she did when she channeled the power of almost all magical beings on Earth through her to Captain Marvel to aid him in his battle with the Spectre, and again with Strega of The Pentacle, though all of the magicians she came into contact with allowed her to tap into them.

After the ''Strange Adventures'' run, the evil Enchantress side manifested whenever June Moone changed. Later, her evil side manifested only when was under great magical stress which overloaded her, and she returned to normal once the overload subsided. This is no longer the case since the 'Soulsinger' identity separated the evil Enchantress entity without her powers before dissipating, leaving June Moone with the Enchantress power but not the evil personality.

She has possession of Nightwitch's 'Herne-Ramsgate Cauldron', which allows her to find almost every magical creature in the DC Universe.<ref>{{cite comic|writer= Sturges, Matthew|penciller= [[Phil Winslade|Winslade, Phil]]|inker= Winslade, Phil|story= Darkness and Light, Part Three: Reversals|title= Shadowpact|issue= 19|date= January 2008}}</ref>

In the New 52 the Enchantress displayed a wide variety of magical powers, but due to being separated from June Moon, they appeared at random and manifested across the planet in different guises, such as animating the Sphinx in Giza and making it attack tourists, and creating dozens of June Moon doubles wandering around on the freeway. Her defences were formidable, easily seeing off Superman, Wonder Woman and Cyborg with a storm of old human teeth and later beating Zatanna off with a host of zombies. When June was finally brought to the Enchantress' location, she manifested as a colossal monster made up of the bodies of hundreds of June Moones.{{issue needed|date=December 2016}}
