'''The Enchantress''' is a [[DC Comics]] character who has been both [[supervillain]] and [[superhero]] depending on the situation.

== Character Biography ==

=== Origins ===
The Enchantress first appeared in ''[[Strange Adventures]]'' #187 (April 1966), in which an unknown magical being empowered '''June Moone''' to fight evil. {Her surname in comics has been spelled both ''Moon'' and ''Moone'', but it was originally ''Moone''.} Her appearance changed from blond-haired June to black-haired Enchantress.  This would be a the first story in a brief continuing series about the "Switcheroo-witcheroo". Her next stories in ''Strange Adventures'' would be in #191 and #200.

Her origin was in substance derivative of the Golden-Age Captain Marvel published by Fawcett Comics; like him, she was summoned to a hidden chamber by a mystical being who gave her the power to become a super-powered being with a different physical appearance by saying a magic word.

=== Change of Role ===
Despite her original heroic charge she has appeared in stories as a villain instead of a hero, beginning with the next story arc she appeared in after the ''Strange Adventures'' series. This was a [[Supergirl]] strip in ''Superman Family'' #204-205 (1980/81) although after the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' storyline, the villainous Enchantress was [[retconned]] to have encountered [[Power Girl]] instead of Supergirl.

The Enchantress continued in the mode of a minor villainess in her next appearances: as a member of the [[Forgotten Villains]] (''DC Comics Presents'' #77-78 (1985)); among the villain army in ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' #12 (March 1986); and as a recruit for the [[Suicide Squad]]. During her tenure with the last, her origins and powers became tied to those of her then teammate [[Nightshade (comics)|Nightshade]].

Her next major appearance in the DC Universe was during the ''Day of Judgement'' event (November 1999). In this story her personality had changed, making her less a villain, but still a far cry from being a hero. During the course of the story, the Enchantress portion of June Moone was murdered by [[Sebastian Faust|Faust]] to re-ignite the fires of Hell. This left June in a passive, but not quite catatonic state.

June next showed up in ''JLA: Black Baptism'' (2001), with Faust removing her from a sanitarium. This series also introduced the character Anita Soulfeeda, a succubus working with a group of Mafia-styled demons to resurrect Hermes Trismegestus. In the final act, Anita is revealed to be the Enchantress portion of Juneâ€™s soul. When they are reconnected, a new entity called Soulsinger is created. At the end of the story, the Soulsinger entity fades, leaving Enchantress behind, but once again cut off from her powers.

=== Shadowpact ===
Most recently, as part of the build-up to ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', she and other members of the [[Sentinels of Magic]] joined the [[Shadowpact]] to combat a [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] gone mad in ''[[Day of Vengeance]]''.  They have continued to operate together since then. (The Enchantress began wearing a new costume as of ''Shadowpact'' #1.)
