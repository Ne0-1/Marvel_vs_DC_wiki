The '''Enchantress''' is the name of two [[fictional character]]s in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], the first of which is a powerful [[magician (fantasy)|sorceress]] named '''Amora''' and is one of the most notable antagonists of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=April 2010}}
Amora's first appearance in the Marvel Universe took place in ''Journey Into Mystery'' #103, while the second Enchantress, named '''Sylvie''', appeared in ''Dark Reign Young Avengers'' #1.

==Fictional character biography==
===Amora===
The Enchantress' parentage is unknown, though it is known she was born in [[Asgard (Marvel Comics)|Asgard]] and has a sister by the name of [[Lorelei (Asgardian)|Lorelei]]. Amora began learning magic as an apprentice of [[Karnilla]], Queen of the Norns but was eventually banished. She continued learning magic on her own, notably by seducing others well versed in magic and learning their secrets. In time, Amora became one of the more powerful magic-wielders in Asgard, with her magical arsenal focused on (but not limited to) charming and mind-controlling people. Her by-now well-renowned beauty did not hinder in this.

In her first appearance, she attempted to eliminate Thor's love interest in order to have the thunder god for herself. From her first appearance, she was assisted by a powerful minion — Skurge, the [[Executioner (comics)|Executioner]]. The Executioner loved the Enchantress, but she merely kept stringing him along with her feminine wiles, using him as her muscle. She aided [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] by attempting to seduce Thor in his Don Blake identity, and by sending the Executioner to kill [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]], but despite exiling her to another dimension Thor was able to bring her back.<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #103</ref>

The Enchantress and the Executioner were exiled to Earth by [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]]. They became members of [[Baron Zemo#Baron Heinrich Zemo|Baron Zemo]]'s original [[Masters of Evil]], the opposite number to the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], a superhero team whom Thor had joined. She hypnotizes Thor into attacking the other Avengers, making him believe they are enemies of humanity, but Iron Man wakes him from his trance. She also recruited [[Wonder Man]] into the Master's of Evil. She also met [[Immortus]], who helped Zemo attack the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' #7, 9-10</ref> She also joined in the Masters of Evil's final assault against the Avengers, but managed to escape in the end with the Executioner.<ref>''Avengers'' #15-16</ref> As a member of the Masters of Evil, the Enchantress (and Executioner) repeatedly faced the Avengers. She was especially affronted by the mortal [[Scarlet Witch]]'s attempts to subvert her divine spells, though nevertheless occasionally challenged by Wanda's mutant gifts.

[[Image:Enchantress.jpg|left|thumb|Art by [[Alan Davis]].]]
With the Executioner, she menaced Jane Foster again at Loki's behest.<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #116-117</ref>

The Enchantress has notably been the one to give some other superhumans their powers. For example, she used the deceased Zemo's equipment to make [[Erik Josten]] into the original Power Man, who aided her in battling the Avengers. Her illusions and traps turned the city against the Avengers, forcing them to disband, but Captain America used a taped confession to reveal they were responsible after which she used her spells to teleport away.<ref>''Avengers'' #21-22</ref> (Josten is these days well known as Atlas of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]). Amora also used her magics to make Samantha Parrington and later, Barbara Norris into the [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]] in the early adventures of the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].<ref>''Defenders'' #4<!--I think, could someone verify?--></ref>

Amora posed as the Valkyrie, and formed the [[Lady Liberators (comics)|Lady Liberators]]. She duped [[Arkon]] into fighting the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' #83-84</ref> With the Executioner, she battled the Defenders and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]].<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #7; ''Defenders'' #20</ref>

With the Executioner, Amora attempted to conquer Asgard. She therefore served as Loki's lieutenant in his brief rule of Asgard.<ref>''Thor'' #258-261, 263-265</ref>

In the [[Secret Wars]], where she had been placed on the villains' side, she spurned the idea of fighting a gladiatorial game for the amusement of a higher being, and proposed to Thor that the two of them simply join their forces to leave both the heroes and villains behind, and go back home to Asgard.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

Amora's sister Lorelei appeared, and it was established that the two sisters had somewhat of a strained relationship, rooted in rivalry. More than a little friction was between the pair, not the least due to competition over which one of them would manage to seduce Thor.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

The Enchantress joined the Asgardian gods and heroes on their side, in final battle against the world-ender [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]]. Motivated, naturally, by enlightened self-interest, as if Surtur would end the world, Amora would perish too.<ref>''Thor'' #350, 352-353</ref>

[[Image:EnchantScarletvision9.png|200px|Another regular foe of Amora's was the Scarlet Witch, as seen here in: ''The Vision and the Scarlet Witch'' (Vol. 2) #9. Cover art by Richard Howell and [[P. Craig Russell]].|thumb|right]]
Soon after the Surtur War, Thor led a number of Asgardian heroes to [[Hel (realm)|Hel]], the death goddess [[Hela (Marvel Comics)|Hela]]'s realm. The Executioner bid Thor to join the expedition, for reasons he did not reveal others. In truth, he had seen the Enchantress dallying with Heimdall, and heartbroken, Skurge wished to lose himself in a noble cause — such as led by Thor, to rescue lost souls from Hela. He perhaps got more than he bargained for — yet perhaps as much as he wished — when Thor's forces, after accomplishing their mission, needed to retreat from Hel. One man was needed to hold the bridge Gjallerbru, and the Executioner, knowing there was no more Amora for him, chose to be that man, giving his life so the others might flee. When Amora heard the news, to everyone's surprise she was truly grief-stricken.<ref>''Thor'' #371</ref>

After Skurge's death, Amora continued her regular hi-jinks, occasionally helping Asgard, occasionally opposing them. She aided Asgard, for one, against [[Seth (Marvel Comics)|Seth]]'s legions.<ref>''Thor'' #393-398-400</ref>

Lorelei later perished as Amora refused to give her life for her sister's, the deceased Skurge (in Valhalla) rejected the Enchantress, and Amora went on to empower the Earthman Brute Benhurst into a short-lived new Executioner to serve as her minion in Skurge's stead.<ref>''Thor'' #402-403</ref>  Amora also vexed the Avenger known as [[Wonder Man]], and assisted Thor and the [[Warriors Three]] in their quest to return [[Odin]] to the throne of Asgard. During this time, an attraction between Amora and Asgard's guardian [[Heimdall (Marvel Comics)|Heimdall]] was explored. Amora even battles the powerful entity [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]] on behalf of both of them as Heimdall, at the time, was unable to protect himself. She ultimately rejects him when she realized he wanted to be married and she did not.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

In the ''[[Acts of Vengeance]]'', Amora and Skruge joined forces and attacked [[Doctor Strange]] only to be bested by [[Clea]] when she flies to his aid.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Later, Thor had been spurned by his father Odin, exiled to Earth and depowered. In this vulnerable state, Thor ended up forming a willing liaison with Amora, with the two of them living out of a loft in [[New York City]] as lovers. This status quo would remain until Thor would go missing during [[Heroes Reborn]] and presumed dead.<ref>''Thor'' #491-494</ref>

During Ragnarök, Amora is present with the other Asgardian deities and dwarves when Eitri and his brothers are sealed into a tomb they carved due to the Mjolnir mold destroying them, albeit accidentally. When Surtur's forging of new Mjolnirs creates chaos, Thor attempts to fly to the skies to discern the source, but is at once struck down by a blast from a Mjolnir duplicate of Loki's; Amora is slain by the same blast, one of the first victims of Loki during this event, neither her magic nor her inherent durability capable of shielding her. Heimdall falls soon afterward; Amora is not seen again, yet seemingly in one of the realms of death, unable to use her magic to assist her once-lover.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

After Ragnarök, when Thor, Asgard and the other Asgardians return, Thor is manipulated by Loki into inadvertently awakening some of Thor's enemies, among them Amora, though when last she was seen, she was the victim, falling by Loki's hands and mourned by Thor and the other Asgardians alike. She doesn't return to Asgard yet, but instead goes to attack the world tree, [[Yggdrasil]], in order to resurrect Skurge and release him from Valhalla. Amora is ultimately thwarted after Thor, Loki, and Balder convince her that she is dishonoring his memory with her actions.<ref>''Thor: God-Sized Special'' #1</ref>

A member of the Young Masters surfaces having modeled herself on Amora the Enchantress and has takes on her fellow teammate [[Melter#Melter_II|Melter II]] as her lover.<ref>http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=21439</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/020920-Brooks-Young-Masters.html |title=Mark Brooks: Designing the Young Masters |accessdate=2009-02-20 |author =Vaneta Rogers |publisher=newsarama.com |date=2009-02-20 }}</ref> The new Enchantress is revealed to be an adolescent who had been given powers by Loki so that he could use her in his schemes.<ref name="Dark Reign: Young Avengers #4">''Dark Reign: Young Avengers'' #4</ref> However, she truly believes that she is an Asgardian that had been exiled from her native Asgard and sent to live in New York where she joined the Young Masters. She admits to the first team of Young Avengers that she is Sylvie Lushton from Broxton Oklahoma, who suddenly gained magic powers.<ref name="Dark Reign: Young Avengers #3">''Dark Reign: Young Avengers'' #3</ref> Sylvie seems to have powers and abilities similar to that of the original Enchantress, despite looking far younger, and speaking with a noticeable [[lisp]].<ref>''Dark Reign: Young Avengers'' #1</ref> Sylvie has a strong desire to become a Young Avenger and even used her magic to change her teammates' minds so that they would want to as well.<ref>''Dark Reign: Young Avengers'' #2</ref>

After a series of try-outs, Sylvie is initially accepted as a new addition to the Young Avengers. However, as a plan to end Sylvie's future with the Young Avengers, her teammates Big Zero and Egghead II download the results of an analysis they had run on her into [[Vision (comics)|Vision]]'s cybernetic mind. The analysis verifies that Sylvie is an unwitting trap for the Young Avengers' magical defense systems created by Loki and [[Wiccan (comics)|Wiccan]] immediately has her banned from the Young Avengers' hideout. A distraught and confused Sylvie then asks her teammates to avenge her, eventually resulting in a confrontation between the two teams and [[Norman Osborn]]'s team of [[Dark Avengers]].<ref name="Dark Reign: Young Avengers #4"/> During the conflict, Wiccan reveals to her that she was given magical powers by Loki. However, he states that the team still wants her, but that her hasty banning was only to quickly remove her from the premises so that he could alter the magical defenses to compensate for Loki's traps. Convinced by Wiccan that being Avenger is about who one chooses to be despite one's origins, she, Coat of Arms, and Wiccan manage to magically remove [[The Sentry (comics)|The Sentry]] from the battlefield and turn the tide of the fight against the Young Masters and the Dark Avengers. Melter requests a quick escape so that they can have more time to decide what they will choose to do as either superheroes or supervillains, and Sylvie complies, teleporting the Young Masters away.<ref>''Dark Reign; Young Avengers'' #5</ref>

==Connection to Norse mythology==
Unlike many of Marvel's [[Asgardians (comics)|Asgardians]], Amora is not actually based on a goddess from Norse mythology.<ref name="Gods in Comics">{{Cite web|title=How Pagan Gods Exist in a World that Forgot Them |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20021118031215/http://www.gettysburg.edu/academics/english/vikingstudies/davidsen/researchdocument.html |publisher=[[Gettysburg College]] |accessdate=2009-12-21 |last=Davidsen |first=Keith J. |date=2002-11-18}}</ref> However in the limited series ''Thor: Ages of Thunder'' the Enchantress is said to have been referred to by many names throughout history including; [[Freyja]], [[Gefjon|Gefn]] and [[Iðunn|Iduna]], and is linked to many of the myths associated with these goddesses (i.e. as keeper of the [[Golden apple#Norse mythology|golden apples]]).<ref>''Thor: Ages of Thunder'' #1</ref> However, characters based on some of these goddesses ([[Freya (Marvel Comics)|Freya]]<ref>''Marvel Super Heroes'' vol. 2, #15 (1993)</ref> and [[Idunn (Marvel Comics)|Idunn]]<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'', #114 (Mar 1965)</ref>) already exist in the [[Marvel Universe]].

==Powers and abilities==
The Enchantress is a member of the race of superhumans known as [[Asgardians (Marvel Comics)|Asgardians]], and as such possesses superhuman strength, speed, stamina, and durability but prefers to avoid physical conflicts. She possesses an innate capacity to manipulate ambient magical energy, honed through practice for a variety of effects, including projecting magical power bolts, interdimensional teleportation of multiple Asgardians and non-Asgardians, protective energy shields, illusions, levitation, conjuring, transmutation, telekinesis, time-disruption, mind switching, and mind control. She has used her sorcery to enhance her natural beauty and allure, and to enchant her lips so that she by kissing virtually any man she can make him her slave for about a week, unless she renews the treatment. She can also use her magic to heal any of her injuries rapidly, and possesses limited mystical senses. A prolonged absence from [[Asgard (Marvel Comics)|Asgard]] tends to diminish her powers although they never fade completely. The Enchantress’s has been described as one of the most powerful sorceresses in Asgard, second only to [[Karnilla]],<ref>''New Mutants Special Edition''; ''X-Men Annual'' #9; ''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Deluxe Edition'' #4</ref> although their every direct confrontation has ended in a stalemate until interrupted.<ref>''The mighty Thor'' v.1, #260, #450, #455</ref> However, Amora's sister [[Lorelei (Asgardian)|Lorelei]] was later also enhanced beyond her own abilities.<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #509-511 (May-Aug. 1997); ''Defenders'' vol.2, #4 (2001)</ref> The Enchantress has a gifted intellect, and possesses extensive knowledge of Asgardian mystic and amatory arts. On occasion, the Enchantress employs various mystical artifacts, potions, and power objects, such as the crystalline gem in which she entrapped [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Brunnhilde the Valkyrie]]'s soul, and the potion she used to increase her hypnotic power over Thor in ''Avengers'' #7. It has been shown that Enchantress is unable to access her spells when her hands are bound and her mouth is gagged.<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #504 (1996)</ref>

Initially unbeknownst to her, Enchantress II's powers are given to her by Loki. Wiccan states that she may not fully understand how powerful she truly is. Her powers and abilities appear similar to those of the original Enchantress. She is able to teleport many people instantly, maintain a secret fortress with her magic, and transform objects and people into whatever she desires, such as turning several henchmen into frogs. She also demonstrated power enough to stop both the Young Avengers and Young Masters during their battle and separate them.<ref name="Dark Reign: Young Avengers #3"/>
