The '''Enchantress''' ('''Amora''') is a [[fictional character|character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. A powerful [[sorceress]], she is one of the most notable antagonists of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. Unlike many of Marvel's [[Asgardians (comics)|Asgardians]], she is not an actual goddess from mythology. Some theorize, however, that she is based on the Norse goddess [[Freyja]][http://web.archive.org/web/20021118031215/http://www.gettysburg.edu/academics/english/vikingstudies/davidsen/researchdocument.html].

The Enchantress' first appearance in the [[Marvel Universe]] took place in ''Journey Into Mystery'' #103.

==Fictional character biography==
The Enchantress' parentage is unknown, though it is known she has a sister by the name of [[Lorelei (Asgardian)|Lorelei]]. Amora began learning magic as an apprentice of [[Karnilla]], Queen of the Norns but was eventually banished. She continued learning magic on her own, notably by seducing others well versed in magic and learning their secrets. In time, Amora became one of the more powerful magic-wielders in Asgard, with her magical arsenal focused on (but not limited to) charming and mind-controlling people. Her by now well renowned beauty did not hinder in this.

In her first appearance, she attempted to eliminate Thor's love interest in order to have the thunder god for herself.<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #103</ref> From her first appearance, she was assisted by a powerful minion &mdash; Skurge, [[Executioner (comics)|the Executioner]]. The Executioner loved the Enchantress, but she merely kept stringing him along with her feminine wiles, using him as her muscle.

Amora's main motivation was to make Thor fall in love with her. As such, she was mainly an antagonist to him. However, she branched out elsewhere as well when her opportunistic motives would so entice. Most notably, she became a member of [[Baron Zemo]]'s [[Masters of Evil]], the opposite number to the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], a superhero team whom Thor had joined. As a member of the Masters of Evil, the Enchantress (and Executioner) repeatedly faced [[Avengers (comics)|the Avengers]]. She was especially affronted by the mortal [[Scarlet Witch]]'s attempts to subvert her divine spells, though nevertheless occasionally challenged by Wanda's mutant gifts.

The Enchantress has notably been the one to give some other superhumans their powers. For example, she used the deceased Zemo's equipment to make [[Erik Josten]] into the original Power Man in ''Avengers'' #21 &mdash; Josten is these days well known as Atlas of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]. Amora also used her magics to make Barbara Norris into the [[Valkyrie (comics)|Valkyrie]] in the early adventures of the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. Without Amora, both might never have become superhumans.

Amora remained an antagonist for many years, exhibiting a capricious nature that was quick to toy with mortals with little concern to them. Seductive, manipulative and caring only about herself, she was the ultimate femme fatale in the Marvel Universe. Vanity was of great concern to her, few things were more important to Amora than maintaining her external veneer of beauty that made her worthy of the name Enchantress.

In the [[1980s]] a gradual move towards a more moderate mindset began to emerge. In the [[Secret Wars]], where she had been placed on the villains' side, she spurned the idea of fighting a gladiatorial game for the amusement of a higher being, and proposed to Thor that the two of them simply join their forces to leave both the heroes and villains behind, and go back home to Asgard. Further, during [[Walt Simonson]]'s run on ''Thor'', the Enchantress joined the Asgardian gods and heroes on their side, in final battle against the world-ender [[Surtur (comics)|Surtur]]. Motivated, naturally, by enlightened self-interest, as if Surtur would end the world, Amora would perish too.

In the Acts of Vengeance, Enchantress attacked Dr. Strange.

It was during Simonson's run as well that we were introduced to Amora's sister Lorelei, and it was established that the two sisters had somewhat of a strained relationship, rooted in rivalry. More than a little friction was between the pair, not the least due to competition over which one of them would manage to seduce Thor.

Soon after the Surtur War, Thor led a number of Asgardian heroes to [[Hel (realm)|Hel]], the death goddess [[Hela (Marvel Comics)|Hela]]'s realm. The Executioner bid Thor to join the expedition, for reasons he did not reveal others. In truth, he had seen the Enchantress dallying with Heimdall, and heartbroken, Skurge wished to lose himself in a noble cause &mdash; such as led by Thor, to rescue lost souls from Hela. He perhaps got more than he bargained for &mdash; yet perhaps as much as he wished &mdash; when Thor's forces, after accomplishing their mission, needed to retreat from Hel. One man was needed to hold the bridge Gjallerbru, and the Executioner, knowing there was no more Amora for him, chose to be that man, giving his life so the others might flee.  When Amora heard the news, to everyone's surprise she was truly grief-stricken.

After Skurge's death, Amora continued her regular hijinks, occasionally helping Asgard, occasionally opposing them. The next significant Amora storyline came when [[Tom DeFalco]] came on board ''Thor'' in #402-403 &mdash; Lorelei perished as Amora refused to give her life for her sister's, the deceased Skurge (in Valhalla) rejected the Enchantress, and Amora went on to empower the Earthman Brute Benhurst into a short-lived new Executioner to serve as her minion in Skurge's stead.  Amora also vexed the Avenger known as [[Wonder Man]], and assisted Thor and the [[Warriors Three]] in their quest to return [[Odin]] to the throne of Asgard.  During this time, an attraction between Amora and Asgard's guardian [[Heimdall]] was explored. Amora even battles the powerful entity [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]] on behalf of both of them as Heimdall, at the time, was unable to protect himself. She ultimately rejects him when she realized he wanted to be married and she did not.

For most of the four hundreds of Thor's solo title, Amora lay fairly low, but towards the end of that period, [[Warren Ellis]] came on board as writer, with a story called ''Worldengine'' in ''Thor'' #491-494. In it, Thor had been spurned by his father Odin, exiled to Earth and depowered. In this vulnerable state, Thor ended up forming a willing liaison with Amora, with the two of them living out of a loft in [[New York City]] as lovers. This status quo would remain until Thor would go missing during [[Heroes Reborn]] and presumed dead.

When Thor returned in a new title written by [[Dan Jurgens]], Asgard was in shambles and its gods missing. This was resolved within the title's first year, and Asgard returned to its former glory. Amora played no significant part, until the death of Odin (#40 of the new series), and Thor's assumption of the Odinpower. Amora inveigled herself into the good graces of Thor, the new ruler of Asgard, and became his consort. She remained thus until [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] brought about [[Ragnar√∂k]], in which all of Asgard appeared to die. The new Thor title concluded with this (#85, October 2004).

Recently, it has been confirmed that a new Thor book will start in 2007, written by [[J. Michael Straczynski]].  What role Enchantress would have, if any in it, is unknown at this time. However, as of Issue #5, it appears she has returned.

==Other versions==
===Heroes Reborn===
An alternate version of Enchantress appears in the [[Heroes Reborn]] universe.

===Marvel Zombies===
An Earth-2149 Enchantress becomes a zombie in [[Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness]] as part of [[Marvel Zombies]] miniseries. She is imprisoned in the castle of Dr. Doom so that she does not contaminate the people. She portrays herself as a non-zombie to attract the attention of Ash so that she can be freed. Upon her release, she infects [[Dazzler]], who was trying to show Ash what was going on. [[Doctor Doom]], understanding both women were beyond hope, kills them both.

===Rule of Thor===
In an alternate future, where Thor conquers Earth seemingly for its own good, Enchantress marries Thor and they produce a child, [[Magni]]. This Enchantress and the entire future is nuetralized when Thor realizes he has been acting without honor and travels back in time to warn his past self.

==Appearances in another media==
===Video games===
Enchantress appears a main antagonist in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'' voiced by [[Gabrielle Carteris]]. She is one of [[Doctor Doom]]'s lieutenants in his [[Masters of Evil]]. She and Executioner battle the heroes after [[Tyr (Marvel Comics)|Tyr]] and [[Heimdall (Marvel Comics)|Heimdall]] are freed and before [[Balder (Marvel Comics)|Balder]] is freed. In battle, she uses her bodyguard Executioner to take care of the physical work, while she casts spells on the player's team of heroes to stop them attacking her. She has special dialogue with Thor and there was a dialogue in there where she asked Executioner if he was jealous of her love to Thor.
