The '''Enchantress''' ('''Amora''') is a [[fictional character|character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. A powerful [[sorceress]], she is one of the most notable antagonists of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. Unlike many of Marvel's [[Asgardians (comics)|Asgardians]], she is not an actual goddess from mythology. Some theorize, however, that she is based on the Norse goddess [[Freyja]][http://web.archive.org/web/20021118031215/http://www.gettysburg.edu/academics/english/vikingstudies/davidsen/researchdocument.html]. The current Thor series notes the Enchantress was once known as the goddess [[Iðunn]] who picked the golden apples for the other Asgardians, among other names.{{Fact|date=July 2008}}

The Enchantress' first appearance in the [[Marvel Universe]] took place in ''Journey Into Mystery'' #103.

==Publication history==
Amora's main motivation was to make Thor fall in love with her. As such, she was mainly an antagonist to him. However, she branched out elsewhere as well when her opportunistic motives would so entice. 

Amora remained an antagonist for many years, exhibiting a capricious nature that was quick to toy with mortals with little concern for them. Seductive, manipulative and caring only about herself, she was the ultimate femme fatale in the Marvel Universe. Vanity was of great concern to her, few things were more important to Amora than maintaining her external veneer of beauty that made her worthy of the name Enchantress.

In the 1980s a gradual move towards a more moderate mindset began to emerge, during [[Walt Simonson]]'s run on ''Thor''. It was during Simonson's run that readers were introduced to Amora's sister Lorelei.

A significant Amora storyline came when [[Tom DeFalco]] came on board ''Thor'' in #402-403, when Lorelei perished.

For most of the four hundreds of Thor's solo title, Amora lay fairly low, but towards the end of that period, [[Warren Ellis]] came on board as writer, with a story called ''Worldengine'' in ''Thor'' #491-494.

When Thor returned in a new title written by [[Dan Jurgens]], Asgard was in shambles and its gods missing. This was resolved within the title's first year, and Asgard returned to its former glory. Amora played no significant part, until the death of Odin (#40 of the new series), and Thor's assumption of the Odinpower. Amora inveigled herself into the good graces of Thor, the new ruler of Asgard, and became his consort. She remained thus until [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] brought about [[Ragnarök]], in which all of Asgard appeared to die. The new Thor title concluded with this (#85, October 2004).

A new Thor book started in 2007, written by [[J. Michael Straczynski]].  What role Enchantress will have, if any in it, is unknown at this time.

==Fictional character biography==
[[Image:Enchantress.jpg|left|thumb|Art by [[Alan Davis]].]]
The Enchantress' parentage is unknown, though it is known she was born in [[Asgard (Marvel Comics)|Asgard]] and has a sister by the name of [[Lorelei (Asgardian)|Lorelei]]. Amora began learning magic as an apprentice of [[Karnilla]], Queen of the Norns but was eventually banished. She continued learning magic on her own, notably by seducing others well versed in magic and learning their secrets. In time, Amora became one of the more powerful magic-wielders in Asgard, with her magical arsenal focused on (but not limited to) charming and mind-controlling people. Her by-now well-renowned beauty did not hinder in this.

In her first appearance, she attempted to eliminate Thor's love interest in order to have the thunder god for herself. From her first appearance, she was assisted by a powerful minion — Skurge, the [[Executioner (comics)|Executioner]]. The Executioner loved the Enchantress, but she merely kept stringing him along with her feminine wiles, using him as her muscle. She aided [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] by attempting to seduce Thor in his Don Blake identity, and be sending the Executioner to kill [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]].<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #103</ref>

The Enchantress and the Executioner were exiled to Earth by [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]].  They became members of [[Baron Zemo#Baron Heinrich Zemo|Baron Zemo]]'s original [[Masters of Evil]], the opposite number to the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], a superhero team whom Thor had joined. She also recruited [[Wonder Man]] into the Master's of Evil.  She also met [[Immortus]], who helped Zemo attack the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' #7, 9-10</ref> She also joined in the Masters of Evil's final assault against the Avengers, but managed to escape in the end.<ref>''Avengers'' #15-16</ref> As a member of the Masters of Evil, the Enchantress (and Executioner) repeatedly faced the Avengers. She was especially affronted by the mortal [[Scarlet Witch]]'s attempts to subvert her divine spells, though nevertheless occasionally challenged by Wanda's mutant gifts.

With the Executioner, she menaced Jane Foster again at Loki's behest.<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #116-117</ref>

The Enchantress has notably been the one to give some other superhumans their powers. For example, she used the deceased Zemo's equipment to make [[Erik Josten]] into the original Power Man, who aided her in battling the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' #21-22</ref> (Josten is these days well known as Atlas of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]). Amora also used her magics to make Barbara Norris into the [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]] in the early adventures of the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].<ref>''Defenders'' #4<!--I think, could someone verify?--></ref>

Amora posed as the Valkyrie, and formed the [[Lady Liberators (comics)|Lady Liberators]]. She duped [[Arkon]] into fighting the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' #83-84</ref> With the Executioner, she battled the Defenders and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]].<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #7; ''Defenders'' #20</ref>

With the Executioner, Amora attempted to conquer Asgard.  She therefore served as Loki's lieutenant in his brief rule of Asgard.<ref>''Thor'' #258-261, 263-265</ref>

In the [[Secret Wars]], where she had been placed on the villains' side, she spurned the idea of fighting a gladiatorial game for the amusement of a higher being, and proposed to Thor that the two of them simply join their forces to leave both the heroes and villains behind, and go back home to Asgard.

Amora's sister Lorelei appeared, and it was established that the two sisters had somewhat of a strained relationship, rooted in rivalry. More than a little friction was between the pair, not the least due to competition over which one of them would manage to seduce Thor.

The Enchantress joined the Asgardian gods and heroes on their side, in final battle against the world-ender [[Surtur (comics)|Surtur]]. Motivated, naturally, by enlightened self-interest, as if Surtur would end the world, Amora would perish too.<ref>''Thor'' #350, 352-353</ref>

[[Image:EnchantScarletvision9.png|200px|Another regular foe of Amora's was the Scarlet Witch, as seen here in: ''The Vision and the Scarlet Witch'' (Vol. 2) #9. Cover art by Richard Howell and [[P. Craig Russell]].|thumb|right]]
Soon after the Surtur War, Thor led a number of Asgardian heroes to [[Hel (realm)|Hel]], the death goddess [[Hela (Marvel Comics)|Hela]]'s realm. The Executioner bid Thor to join the expedition, for reasons he did not reveal others. In truth, he had seen the Enchantress dallying with Heimdall, and heartbroken, Skurge wished to lose himself in a noble cause — such as led by Thor, to rescue lost souls from Hela. He perhaps got more than he bargained for — yet perhaps as much as he wished — when Thor's forces, after accomplishing their mission, needed to retreat from Hel. One man was needed to hold the bridge Gjallerbru, and the Executioner, knowing there was no more Amora for him, chose to be that man, giving his life so the others might flee.  When Amora heard the news, to everyone's surprise she was truly grief-stricken.

After Skurge's death, Amora continued her regular hi-jinks, occasionally helping Asgard, occasionally opposing them. She aided Asgard, for one, against [[Seth (Marvel Comics)|Seth]]'s legions.<ref>''Thor'' #393-398-400</ref>

Lorelei later perished as Amora refused to give her life for her sister's, the deceased Skurge (in Valhalla) rejected the Enchantress, and Amora went on to empower the Earthman Brute Benhurst into a short-lived new Executioner to serve as her minion in Skurge's stead.<ref>''Thor'' #402-403</ref>  Amora also vexed the Avenger known as [[Wonder Man]], and assisted Thor and the [[Warriors Three]] in their quest to return [[Odin]] to the throne of Asgard.  During this time, an attraction between Amora and Asgard's guardian [[Heimdall (Marvel Comics)|Heimdall]] was explored. Amora even battles the powerful entity [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]] on behalf of both of them as Heimdall, at the time, was unable to protect himself. She ultimately rejects him when she realized he wanted to be married and she did not.

In the [[Acts of Vengeance]], Enchantress attacked [[Doctor Strange]].

Later, Thor had been spurned by his father Odin, exiled to Earth and depowered. In this vulnerable state, Thor ended up forming a willing liaison with Amora, with the two of them living out of a loft in [[New York City]] as lovers. This status quo would remain until Thor would go missing during [[Heroes Reborn]] and presumed dead.<ref>''Thor'' #491-494</ref>

After Ragnarök, when Thor, Asgard and the other Asgardians return, Thor is manipulated by Loki into inadvertently awakening some of Thor's enemies, among them Amora. She doesn't return to Asgard yet, but she's seen on a skyscraper roof, waiting for the right moment to make her move.

==Powers and abilities==
The Enchantress is a member of the races of superhumans known as [[Asgardians (Marvel Comics)|Asgardians]], and as such possesses superhuman strength, speed, stamina, and durability. She possesses an innate capacity to manipulate ambient magical energy, honed through practice for a variety of effects, including projecting magical power bolts. She has used her sorcery to enhance her natural beauty and allure, and to enchant her lips so that she by kissing virtually any man she can make him her slave for about a week, unless she renews the treatment. She can also use her magic to heal any of her injuries rapidly. She also possesses limited mystical senses. A prolonged absence from [[Asgard (Marvel Comics)|Asgard]] tends to diminish her powers although they never fade completely.

The Enchantress has a gifted intellect, and possesses extensive knowledge of Asgardian mystic and amatory arts. She has received extensive training in sorcery by [[Karnilla]] and various Asgardian mages and wizards.

On occasion, the Enchantress employs various mystical artifacts, potions, and power objects, such as the crystalline gem in which she entrapped [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Brunnhilde the Valkyrie]]'s soul.

==Other versions==
===Heroes Reborn===
An alternate version of Enchantress appears in the [[Heroes Reborn]] universe.

She is imprisoned in the castle of Dr. Doom so that she does not contaminate the people. She portrays herself as a non-zombie to attract the attention of Ash so that she can be freed. Upon her release, she infects [[Dazzler]], who was trying to show Ash what was going on. [[Doctor Doom]], understanding Dazzler and Enchantress were beyond hope, kills them both.

===Rule of Thor===
In an alternate future, where Thor conquers Earth seemingly for its own good, Enchantress marries Thor and they produce a child, [[Magni (Marvel Comics)|Magni]]. This Enchantress and the entire future is neutralized when Thor realizes he has been acting without honor and travels back in time to warn his past self.
