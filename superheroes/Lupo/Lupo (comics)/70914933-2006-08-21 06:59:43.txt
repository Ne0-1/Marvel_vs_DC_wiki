'''Lupo''' is a [[fictional character]], a mutate in the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe. His first appearance was in ''Uncanny X-Men #62''. 

Lupo is a Mutate, a human that was changed by [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], that lived in the [[Savage Land]], a tropical preserve hidden in [[Antarctica]]. He's fought both the [[X-men]], [[Ka-Zar]] and [[Spider-Man]]. Lupo was one of Magneto's first [[Savage Land Mutates]], and has been involved in all the Mutates' subsequent activities. Presumably, Lupo remains with the Mutates in the Savage Land.
