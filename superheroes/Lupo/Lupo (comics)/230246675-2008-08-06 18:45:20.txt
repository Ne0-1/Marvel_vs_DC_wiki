He was artificially mutated into a meta-human by [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] and was one of Magneto's first [[Savage Land Mutates]]. Together with the other Savage Land Mutates, he served Magneto in battling the [[X-Men]] and [[Ka-Zar#Ka-Zar (Kevin Plunder)|Ka-Zar]].

Under Brainchild's orders, Barbarus and the Savage Land Mutates fought [[Spider-Man]], Ka-Zar, and [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] in the Savage Land.<ref>''Marvel Fanfare'' #1-2</ref> He then served [[Sauron (comics)|Sauron]] and [[Zaladane]] in their attempt to take over the Savage Land.<ref>''Marvel Fanfare'' #3-4</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Thanks to his artificially induced mutation, Lupo has augmented strength, speed, agility, endurance, and reflexes. He has hyper keen senses, razor edged talons, and has the psionic ability to command animal life, especially dogs and wolves, through high-pitched yelps. Lupo also later gained the appearance of a werewolf-like creature.

Lupo is a fair hand-to-hand combatant, having been trained in the combat skills of his former tribe, the Swamp Men.
