'''Lupo''' is a [[fictional character]], a mutate in the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe. His first appearance was in ''Uncanny X-Men #62''. 

Lupo is a Mutate, a human that was changed into a metahuman by [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], that lived in the [[Savage Land]], a tropical preserve hidden in [[Antarctica]]. He's fought the [[X-Men]], [[Ka-Zar]] and [[Spider-Man]]. Lupo was one of Magneto's first [[Savage Land Mutates]], and has been involved in all the Mutates' subsequent activities. Presumably, Lupo remains with the Mutates in the Savage Land. 

==Powers==

Lupo has augmented strength, speed, agility, endurance, and reflexes. He has hyper keen senses, razor edged talons and can command animal life, especially dogs, through high-pitched yelps. Lupo also later gained the appearance of a werewolf-like creature.
