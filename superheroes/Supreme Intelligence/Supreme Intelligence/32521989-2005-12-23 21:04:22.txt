The '''Supreme Intelligence''' is a fictional organic computer featured in several [[Marvel Comics]] stories.

==History==

The Supreme Intelligence, also known as Supremor, was created more than a million years ago by the extraterrestrial race known as the [[Kree]] to help them create a [[Cosmic Cube]] like the one that their enemies, the [[Skrull]]s, had once created. It is composed of the brains of the greatest Kree minds (thinkers, generals, philosophers, scientists and so on), removed upon their deaths and assimilated by the computer.

Eventually the Intelligence developed a mind of its own and refused to create the cube knowing the dangers that could be wrought by an evolved Cosmic Cube, which was what destroyed the Skrull Empire.

Despite this, it was allowed to continue to exist to serve the Kree with its wisdom. Its influence eventually grew to the point where it replaced the Kree government, although it has occasionally been deposed for periods of time. Most of the Kree are fanatically devoted to it, and its worship is an organized religion.

The Supremor realized long ago that the Kree were at an [[evolution|evolutionary]] dead-end. Its main concern became to find a way to jump-start its race's evolution. Its manipulations of the human [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] and the Kree hero [[Captain Marvel]] were part of this process, specially since it was aware of the evolutionary potential of the human race, especially the Destiny Force, which it helped awaken in Rick Jones.

During the [[Operation: Galactic Storm]] crossover the Supremor secretly arranged to have a "[[Nega-Bomb]]", a device producing a special kind of radiation gathered from the Negative Zone, detonated in the Kree Galaxy, hoping its energies would reactivate the Kree's genetic potential. But in the process, billions of Kree were killed. This led a group of [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] to decide to execute it for genocide, against the wishes of the rest of the team (''Avengers'' #347; [[May]], [[1992]]).

However Supremor wasn't truly killed, prior to the death of its host computer, it beamed itself to an awaiting starship hidden from the conflict between the Kree and Shi'ar. This ship later was damaged and found by SHIELD, who captured the small computer Supremor was now residing in. SHIELD kept the Supreme Intelligence on the Earth's moon for study, as Supremor bided its time.

The Kree Empire fell after the Kree-Shi'ar War, with the Kree Empire placed under the rule of the Shi'ar Imperium, ruled by Deathbird. The Kree Star Force was her enforcers, now turned into a branch of the Imperial Guard. The Supremor android on the Star Force acted as the Supreme Intelligence's spy into the workings of the remaining Kree Empire.

The Supreme Intelligence soon escaped after it possessed the minds of some SHIELD scientists and had its body taken to Manhattan, where it planned to explode another Nega-Bomb, this time in the sewers of Manhattan. The Supremor witnessed the first Kree mutation when it encountered the Kree Imperial Guard, Commando, who underwent his mutation when he sought to destroy the computer housing the Supreme Intelligence, however it was this act that freed Supremor, allowing it to return to the depths of space.

Supremor eventually reached the Kree Empire and had a new housing constructed for it, as it soon managed to obtain the Forever Crystal, a very powerful mystical artifact, from [[Kang]] (as seen in the [[Avengers Forever]] miniseries) and used it to advance the Kree's evolution, creating a supposedly new race, the Ruul. Through them, it manipulated the Intergalactic Council into turning against the Earth, but its plans were stopped by the Avengers (as seen in the [[Maximum Security]] miniseries.)

Later on the Intelligence got its wish for more genetic stock for the Kree, when some of the Inhuman tribes reunited with the regrowing Kree Empire. Combined with the Ruul and the mutated Kree, the Kree Empire would soon rise again after throwing off the shackles of the Shi'ar Empire.

==Powers==

Despite being basically immobile, the Intelligence possesses all known psionic powers, such as telepathy, telekinesis, cosmic awareness, sensory link, postcognition, precognition and etc.. 

Supremor is also capable of manipulating energy and matter, as well as create up to three android servitors that act as its eyes and ears when away from itself. These androids, called Supremor also, possess some degree of independence when created, but are totally loyal to Supremor.

It often projects a mental images of itself across space, Cyberspace and even into the Astral Plane, usually in the form of a green-skinned humanoid with tentacle-like hair to communicate with its agents scattered across the cosmos. It has even assumed the form of an orange-dragon with a green-skinned octopus as its head, called the Multitude.

Its power was only further enhanced when it later merged with an inert Cosmic Cube, which now serves as its true housing, kept in a separate room from the organic computer facade it created to fool would-be assassins. Upon assuming its new housing, Supremor was now able to control reality within a limited distance of itself, as well as able to open up portals between dimensions, most notably the Astral Plane and the dimension of Death.
