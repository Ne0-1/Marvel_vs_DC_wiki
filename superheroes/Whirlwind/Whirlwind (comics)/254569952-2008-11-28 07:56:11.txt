==Fictional character biography==
'''David Cannon''' is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], who after discovering at an early age that he could move at great speeds turns to a life of crime. This eventually brings Cannon, using his first alias the [[Human Top]], into conflict with [[Giant-Man]] and the Wasp on several occasions. <ref>''Tales To Astonish'' #50 - 52 + 55 & ''Avengers'' #46</ref> Defeated each time, Cannon then adopts the alias of Whirlwind, and after joining the supervillain group the [[Masters of Evil]] battles the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] on a periodic basis.<ref>''Avengers'' #83 + 139</ref>

Cannon later takes on the identity of "Charles Matthews",<ref>''Marvel Feature'' #6 Nov. 1972</ref> the chauffeur of [[Wasp (comics)|Janet Van Dyne]], first with the intent of robbing her, later with the intent of [[flirting|hitting on her]]. In the role of Charles, he pines for Janet, making advances towards her when Henry Pym is presumed to be dead during his run in ''[[Marvel Feature]]''.<ref>''Marvel Feature'' #5-6 Sept-Nov 1972</ref> Charles is later fired for trying to embezzle Janet's money,<ref>''Marvel Feature'' #9 May 1973</ref> and Hank finally discovers that Charles is Whirlwind later on in the series.<ref>''Avengers'' vol.1, #139 Sept. 1975</ref>

During one battle, master villain [[Count Nefaria]] temporarily amplifies the abilities of Whirlwind and super-powered team-mates [[Erik Josten|Power Man]] and the [[Living Laser]] before sending them against the Avengers. The effect, however, is temporary and their combined abilities are drained by Nefaria, who is subsequently defeated by the Avengers. <ref>''Avengers'' #164 - 166</ref> Whirlwind later upgrades his costume when joining a new version of the Masters of Evil formed by Baron Zemo. <ref>''Avengers'' #270 - 277</ref> Whirlwind also shows signs of an obsession with the Wasp, as he forces prostitutes to dress in her past costumes and then assaults them. <ref>''Avengers'' vol.3, #71</ref>

Whirlwind is later incapacitated when accidentally caught in a deluge of paste from a weapon of the criminal the [[Trapster]], <ref>''[[Daughters of the Dragon]]'' #3 (2006)</ref> although eventually makes a full recovery and is forced to join Baron Zemo's team of [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]. <ref>''Thunderbolts'' vol. 2, #104</ref> After leaving them, he gathered a group of villain together and tried to extort money from the new Thunderbolts director [[Norman Osborn]], but was viciously beaten by Osborn and is now forced to secretly work for him. <ref>''Thunderbolts: Reason in Madness''</ref>
