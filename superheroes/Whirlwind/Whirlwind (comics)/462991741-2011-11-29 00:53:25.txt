==Fictional character biography==
'''David Cannon''' is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], who after discovering at an early age that he could move at great speeds turns to a life of crime. This eventually brings Cannon, using his first alias the [[Human Top]] and pursuing his career as a jewel thief, into conflict with [[Giant-Man]] and the Wasp on several occasions.<ref>''Tales To Astonish'' #50 - 52 + 55</ref> Defeated each time, Cannon then redesigns his costume and adopts the alias of Whirlwind, and adopts the identity of "Charles Matthews", chauffeur of [[Wasp (comics)|Janet Van Dyne]].<ref>''Avengers'' #46</ref> Whirlwind joined the supervillain group the second [[Masters of Evil]], and participated in a plot to destroy the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>''Avengers'' #54</ref> He joined the third Masters of Evil, and participated in a Vermont battle against the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' #83</ref> With [[Batroc the Leaper|Batroc]] and [[Porcupine (comics)|Porcupine]], he went on a mission for the [[Red Skull]].<ref>''Captain America'' #130</ref>

Cannon continues with the identity of "Charles Matthews",<ref>''Marvel Feature'' #6 Nov. 1972</ref> the chauffeur of [[Wasp (comics)|Janet Van Dyne]], first with the intent of robbing her, later with the intent of [[flirting|hitting on her]]. In the role of Charles, he pines for Janet, making advances towards her when Henry Pym is presumed to be dead during his run in ''[[Marvel Feature]]''.<ref>''Marvel Feature'' #5-6 Sept-Nov 1972</ref> Charles is later fired for trying to embezzle Janet's money,<ref>''Marvel Feature'' #9 May 1973</ref> and Hank finally discovers that Charles is Whirlwind later on in the series, forcing Whirlwind to abandon the identity.<ref>''Avengers'' vol.1, #139 Sept. 1975</ref>

Whirlwind is then employed by master villain [[Count Nefaria]], and joined his [[Lethal Legion]]. Nefaria temporarily amplifies the abilities of Whirlwind and super-powered team-mates [[Erik Josten|Power Man]] and the [[Living Laser]] before sending them against the Avengers. The effect, however, is temporary and their combined abilities are drained by Nefaria, who is subsequently defeated by the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' #164 - 166</ref> Whirlwind joined the third Masters of Evil in a plan to destroy the Avengers, but caused the defeat of the Masters by attacking prematurely.<ref>''Avengers'' #222</ref> Whirlwind later upgrades his costume when joining a new version of the Masters of Evil formed by Baron Zemo.<ref>''Avengers'' #270 - 277</ref> Whirlwind partnered with the [[Trapster]], obtained a new battle armor and weapons from the [[Tinkerer]], and battled [[Captain America]] in an attempt to bolster his criminal reputation.<ref>''Captain America'' #324</ref> He then partnered with the [[Tiger Shark (Marvel Comics)|Tiger Shark]], traveled to San Francisco to steal an experimental "psycho-circuit", and battled the [[West Coast Avengers]].<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #16</ref> Whirlwind also shows signs of an obsession with the Wasp, as he forces prostitutes to dress in her past costumes and then assaults them.<ref>''Avengers'' vol.3, #71</ref>

Whirlwind and Trapster end up fighting, due to a bounty placed on the former by the up and coming criminal mastermind Ricadonna. Trapster glues Whirlwind to the floor just at the start of his spin. He continues twirling, breaking many of his bones, including his spine.<ref>''[[Daughters of the Dragon]]'' #3 (2006)</ref> He makes a full recovery and is forced to join Baron Zemo's team of [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' vol. 2, #104</ref> After leaving them, he gathered a group of villain together and tried to extort money from the new Thunderbolts director [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]], but was viciously beaten by Osborn and is now forced to work for him secretly.<ref>''Thunderbolts: Reason in Madness''</ref> In ''Dark Reign: Zodiac'', Cannon is shown as a mole for Zodiac, working as Norman Osborn's chauffeur.<ref>''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]: Zodiac''</ref>

Whirlwind later attacks Hank Pym blaming him for Janet's death during the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' and outraged by his taking her codename. He is defeated by the [[Avengers Academy]] student [[Striker (comics)|Striker]]. In a conversation between Striker and his mother, it is revealed that she hired Whirlwind to stage the attack to gain publicity for Striker.<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #5</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Whirlwind is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who possesses the ability to rotate his body around its lengthwise axis at great speeds, without impairing his ability to see, speak, or interact with his environment (for instance, pick up objects or change clothes). Although he can rotate at subsonic speeds he can only travel in a straight line for a limited time, or fly like a helicopter for an even shorter length of time. He possesses superhuman agility, reflexes, coordination, and balance, and often uses himself as a human battering ram. Whirlwind has the ability to focus air currents generated by his rotation into a jet stream powerful enough to blast a hole through a brick wall, as well as create a windscreen able to deflect matter as massive as a falling boulder. He also has the ability to create small tornadoes.

Whirlwind wears full body armor. Since upgrading his armor, Whirlwind has added to his offensive capabilities via the use of two {{convert|10|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} hardened tool-steel sawblades mounted on metal wrist bracelets, which are driven by two DC servo-motors each and activated by palm switches. He also uses thrown [[shuriken]] and razor sharp jacks, whose damaging potential is greatly increased by the velocity of his whirling powers.

==Other versions==
