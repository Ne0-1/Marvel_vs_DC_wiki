==Fictional character biography==
'''David Cannon''' is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], who after discovering at an early age that he could move at great speeds turns to a life of crime. Cannon later takes a position as the chauffeur of Janet Van Dyne - the superheroine the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] - with the intent of robbing her. This eventually brings Cannon, using his first alias the [[Human Top]], into conflict with [[Giant-Man]] and the Wasp on several occasions. <ref>''Tales To Astonish'' vol. 1, #50 - 52 + 55 & ''Avengers'' vol. 1,  #46</ref> Defeated each time, Cannon then adopts the alias of Whirlwind, and after joining the supervillain group the [[Masters of Evil]] battles the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] on a periodic basis. <ref>''Avengers'' vol. 1, #83 + 139</ref> On one occasion master villain [[Count Nefaria]] temporarily amplifies the abilities of Whirlwind and super-powered team-mates [[Power Man]] and the [[Living Laser]] before sending them against the Avengers. The effect, however, is temporary and their combined abilities are drained by Nefaria, who is subsequently defeated by the Avengers. <ref>''Avengers'' vol. 1, #164 - 166</ref> Whirlwind later upgrades his costume when joining a new version of the Masters of Evil formed by Baron Zemo. <ref>''Avengers'' vol. 1, #270 - 277</ref>
