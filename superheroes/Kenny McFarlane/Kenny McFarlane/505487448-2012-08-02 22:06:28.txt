'''Kenny McFarlane''', (a.k.a. '''King Kong''', or '''Kong'''), is a fictional character in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics|Marvel Comics']], in Marvel's [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Universe]]. Created by [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and [[Mark Bagley]], he appears in the pages of ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''. Kenny is one of the few characters not based on a counterpart from Marvel's main [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]], being an original Ultimate Marvel invention to the comics.

==Fictional character biography==
Obese, yet strong, Kenny is the best friend of [[Flash Thompson#Ultimate Flash Thompson|Flash Thompson]]. He is friends with [[Liz Allan#Ultimate Liz Allan|Liz Allan]].

Kenny attends Midtown High School where he plays basketball for the school team.  There, he can regularly be found cooperating with Flash bullying [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Peter Parker]]. However, without Flash in the vicinity, he shows a more likeable side and is often shown being friendly and open to Peter, even letting Peter stay at his house after Peter had a fight with his [[Uncle Ben]].

When Peter Parker is bitten by the genetically enhanced spider that gave him his powers, Kenny crushes the spider under his sneakers, killing it. Later, noticing changes in Peter's physical strength and abilities, and recalling the spider bite, he deduces that Peter Parker is Spider-Man.  Flash and Liz refuse to believe him and demand he prove it by kicking Peter from behind.  Peter's [[Spider-Man's powers and equipment|spider sense]] warns him that the kick is coming, and he willingly takes the abuse rather than reveal his abilities, which appears to dissuade Kenny.  This confrontation is observed by new-student [[Gwen Stacy]], who sticks up for Peter by pulling a knife on Kong.

Kenny still has a fascination with Spider-Man, even to the point of hero worship.  Upon hearing about the upcoming ''Spider-Man'' movie, Kenny enters a casting call for extras. His only line was "Look in the sky, it's Spider-Man!" With the film's success, he achieved some fame in his school.

When Kenny and Peter share detention, Peter tells Kenny that Flash only hangs out with him solely out of a sense of superiority and treats him badly. Whether or not Kenny takes Peter's words to heart, he later has a particularly violent confrontation with Flash after the latter begins ridiculing new student [[Alternative versions of Kitty Pryde#Ultimate Shadowcat|Kitty Pryde]] for being a mutant; Kenny slams Flash into a locker and furiously forces him to apologize, claiming he is "sick of [Flash's] racist crap".  Frightened, Flash leaves the scene and Peter and MJ introduce Kitty to Kenny, and the pair walk away in conversation. He is later seen at Kitty's house, and Kitty later tells Peter that she is thinking of dating him.

Later, when Liz Allan's mutant abilities manifest at a party, Kenny tells Peter to go help her; he still knew that Peter was Spider-Man all along but had kept the knowledge to himself.

When Kitty Pride was singled out by federal troops for being a mutant after the events of ''Ultimatum'', Kenny was one of the few classmates to stick up for her, physically assaulting an agent to buy her time to escape.  Kitty phased herself and Kenny through the floor and into the sewers, and they resume their relationship. Later, Kitty tells Peter that Kenny's mother took him out of the state and hasn't been seen since.

==Character's name==
Writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] did not name Kenny consistently during his run on ''Ultimate Spider-Man''. In the first scenes, he is called by his nickname of King Kong (lately it's just been "Kong", or his real name). In the first issue, his last name was hinted to be Harlan, and in issue #15, his mother called him Clifford, while in Ultimate Marvel Team-Up around the same time, in a story also written by Brian Michael Bendis, a teacher calls him Kenny.  As a result of this information, in the "Official Handbook of the Ultimate Marvel Universe", he was referred to as "Kong Harlan, aka Clifford Kenneth Harlan." However in issue Ultimate Spider-Man #82, his name was finally revealed to be Kenny McFarlane.   He now refers to himself as Kenny McFarlane, and in an interview with Bendis,<ref>[http://www.wordballoon.com/BENDIS.html Page Title<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> it is confirmed that this is his real name.
