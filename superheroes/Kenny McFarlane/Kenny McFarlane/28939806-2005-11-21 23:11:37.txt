'''Kenny McFarlane''', (a.k.a. '''King Kong''', or '''Kong'''), is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe. He is the obese, but strong best friend of [[Flash Thompson]] in the series [[Ultimate Spider-Man]] and goes to [[Midtown High School]].

Kenny likes to double-team with Flash to torture [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Peter Parker]]. However, when Flash is not in his vicinity, he has shown a much more likeable streak. In addition, he is shown to like [[basketball]]. 

When Peter Parker was bit by the genetically enhanced spider that gave him his powers, Kenny killed it by crushing it under his sneakers. He actually found out that Peter Parker was Spider-Man, but dismissed it when he managed to kick Peter in the buttocks at school recess (Peter saw the kick coming, but instead of ducking away with superhuman agility and exposing his secret identity, he chose to take the abuse and play the victim).

Kenny entered a [[casting]] to be an extra on the (fictional) ''Spider-Man'' movie, featured in the "Hollywood" arc (#54-59). His words were "look in the sky, it's Spider-Man!". Since the film was a blockbuster, he achieved instant fame in his school.

===Name===
Writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] did not name Kenny consistently during his run on "Ultimate Spider-Man". In the first issues, he is called by his surname of "King Kong". Later on, his last name was hinted to be "Kung", and in Issue #15, his mother called him "Clifford", so fandom believed his real name was "Clifford Kung". But in USM #82, his name was finally revealed to be "Kenny McFarlane". However, in the "Official Handbook of the Ultimate Marvel Universe", he was referred to as "Kong Harlan", aka "Clifford Kenneth Harlan", which would be a direct contradiciton. But as he refers to himself as "Kenny McFarlane", fandom believes that that name is canonical.
