==Fictional character biography==

In Ann Weying's first appearance, she is a brunette with glasses. In later appearances, she loses the glasses and goes blonde. 

Ann was a successful [[lawyer]], and [[Eddie Brock]]'s ex-wife. Weying assisted [[Spider-Man]] by sharing some of Eddie's history. Later, she followed Spider-Man to the amusement park where Venom had Peter Parker's (fake) parents. She confronted her insane ex-husband, and managed to convince Eddie to give up this [[Feud|vendetta]]. Later, [[Sin-Eater (comics)|Sin-Eater]] shot Ann who became She-Venom when the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] symbiote temporarily bonded with her to save her life.<ref>''Venom: Sinner Takes All'' #2</ref> She-Venom then lashed out against the men who had hurt her with such [[violence]] that Eddie became afraid for her and compelled the symbiote back. Ann retched upon seeing the pile of bodies she had left behind; claiming that the symbiote made her kill, but Eddie told her that the symbiote wouldn't force its host to do something they did not want to.<ref>''Venom: Sinner Takes All'' #3</ref> Later, the police incarcerated Ann on a false charge (unrelated to Ann's rampage above) in order to trap Venom. Ann used her one phone call to warn Eddie and to promise not to come. Eddie agreed not to rescue her himself, and instead sent the symbiote through the phone lines to her.<ref>''Venom: Along Came A Spider'' #2</ref> After it bonded with her, She-Venom was able to break herself out of prison, heading to the amusement park where she and Spider-Man had confronted Venom, only to intercept a raid on a gang of drug dealers.<ref>''Venom: Along Came A Spider'' #3</ref> During the fight, Eddie was badly injured by a flamethrower, prompting Anne to release the symbiote to heal him, but left Eddie in disgust at his dependence on the symbiote.<ref>''Venom: Along Came A Spider'' #4</ref> 

Weying committed [[suicide]] after spotting Spider-Man webslinging in an older black costume at a time when the regular red and blue suit had been stolen. Ann, still reeling from the experience of bonding with the symbiote months earlier and unable to deal with Eddie's return into her life—coupled with Brock's transformation directly in front of her as Venom ran off to kill Spider-Man—sent her over the edge, and she leapt from her high rise apartment to her death.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #19</ref> Her death is later confirmed when her tombstone is shown.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #22 (October 2000)</ref>

Six months later, Anne has a relationship with Dr. Dan Lewis but reluctantly helps Eddie, learning about the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] symbiote in the process. Anne is later approached by Venom (via [[War Dog|Gemini the dog]]) as a host (a nod to She-Venom in the comics) and kills [[Roland Treece]] in the process of saving Brock. Anne kisses Eddie, transferring the Venom symbiote back to Brock. As Riot overpowers Venom, Anne uses the Life Foundation's high frequency volume controls on a loudspeaker which results in both hosts being separated from their respective symbiotes. In the end, Anne is in good terms with Eddie as both share their experiences with the Venom symbiote.
