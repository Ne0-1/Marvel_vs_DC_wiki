'''Mary Jane Watson''' is a [[fictional character]] in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Spider-Man]] series, the sweetheart of series protagonist Peter Parker (Spider-Man), whom she affectionately refers to as "Tiger". She herself often goes by the nickname "MJ".

In the original comic book series, Mary Jane was Peter's third significant sweetheart, after [[Betty Brant]] and [[Gwen Stacy]], but many adaptations and spin-offs skip those two.

Mary Jane was originally an [[unseen character]]; the early issues of ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' featured a running joke about Peter dodging his [[Aunt May]]'s attempts to set him up with "that nice Watson girl next door", whom Peter had not yet met and assumed would not be his type because his aunt liked her.

In the 2002 film ''[[Spider-Man (movie)|Spider-Man]]'', the character of Mary Jane was played by [[Kirsten Dunst]].
