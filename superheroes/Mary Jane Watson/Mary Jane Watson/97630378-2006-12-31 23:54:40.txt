'''''Mary Jane Watson''''' is a love interest for Peter Parker (Spider Man) and a [[supporting character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Spider-Man]] series. Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[John Romita, Sr.]], after a few partial appearences and references, she finally first fully appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #42 ([[1966#November|November 1966]]).

A gorgeous, [[Eye color|green-eyed]] [[red hair|redhead]], she has been the primary romantic interest of Spider-Manâ€™s [[alter ego]] Peter Parker for the last twenty years, although she initially competed against others for his affection, most prominently with [[Gwen Stacy]] and the [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]].

Today, Mary Jane is considered an important part of the Spider-Man mythos and has been featured in most other media adaptations of the character. She has even been the main character of some comics and [[novel]]s aimed at young, female readers. [[Kirsten Dunst]] portrayed her in the recent film series.

==In mainstream Marvel continuity==
===Biography===
In the primary [[Earth 616]] [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]], Mary Jane Watson was Peter's fourth love interest, after Liz Allan, Betty Brant, and Gwen Stacy.

Mary Jane's early life was for many years unknown. It was first explored in ''Amazing Spider-Man''' #259 and finally established by [[Gerry Conway]]'s graphic novel ''The Amazing Spider-Man: Parallel Lives'' (January 1990).  MJ came from a severely troubled family.  Her father, a professor and frustrated writer, took it out on his family in the form of [[spousal abuse|spousal]] and [[child abuse]].  To cope with her hellish family life, Mary Jane kept up a facade as a superficial party girl to avoid the embarrassment, which may have cast her as a forerunner to the archetype of a wily, feisty red head.  Her parents eventually divorced.  Mary Jane and her sister lived with her mother but often stayed with relatives.  Her favorite was her Aunt Anna, who lived next door to the Parkers.  At first, she was unimpressed by Peter, a bookish [[nerd]].  That opinion changed dramatically on the night of [[Uncle Ben|Ben Parker]]'s murder, and Mary Jane saw Peter become Spider-Man for the first time.  For years, MJ kept that knowledge to herself that the boy had an intriguing and exciting secret pastime.

[[Image:mjface.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Mary Jane's face is shown for the first time.  Art by John Romita Sr from ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #42.]]Mary Jane's name was first mentioned in ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' (Vol. 1) #15 (August 1964), but she was originally an [[unseen character]].  The early issues of ''Amazing Spider-Man'' featured a running joke about Peter dodging his [[Aunt May]]'s attempts to set him up with "that nice Watson girl next door", whom Peter had not yet met and assumed would not be his type, since his aunt liked her. (In the ''Parallel Lives'' graphic novel an identical scenario is shown between Mary Jane and ''her'' Aunt Anna.)  Mary Jane made her first actual appearance in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' (Vol. 1) #25 (June 1965); however, in that issue, her face was obscured.  It is not until ''Amazing Spider-Man'' (Vol. 1) #42 (November 1966) that her face is actually seen.  In that issue, on the last page, Peter finally met her, and he was stunned by her beauty even as she spoke the now-famous line: "Face it, Tiger... you just hit the jackpot!" (see the [[#Quotation|quotations]] section below for more information).
[[Image:Asmannual21.jpg|right|thumb|175px|Mary Jane gets married to Peter. Cover to ''[[The Wedding! (Spider-Man)|Amazing Spider-Man (Vol. 1) Annual #21'']].  Art by John Romita Sr.]]
Peter began to date her, much to the annoyance of Gwen Stacy.  However, her apparent superficiality proved to be an irritation to Peter that her rival did not share.  When the [[Green Goblin]] murdered Gwen, MJ stayed with Peter during his mourning, and he became more interested in her as he recovered.  At one point, Peter proposed to her but she turned him down, not wishing to be tied down.  She left New York for several years and Peter saw other women as his adventures continued.

MJ eventually returned and her behavior showed a marked change with her abandonment of her false front.  She admitted her knowledge of Peter's [[secret identity]] in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' (Vol. 1) #258, and Peter found a new respect for her with her newly discovered maturity, making her his confidante. In actuality, she knew of Peter's double life almost from the start as she had seen him as Spider-Man exiting from Peter's bedroom window on the night his Uncle Ben was murdered. (as told in the Parallel Lives Graphic Novel).

In spite of Peter and Mary Jane's mutual worry that they were marrying too early, Peter's concern for MJ's safety, and Mary Jane's unwillingness to give up her "party girl" lifestyle, they married in ''Amazing Spider-Man (Vol. 1) Annual'' #21 (1987).  She [[Double-barrelled name|attached]] Peter's surname to her own, making her '''Mary Jane Watson-Parker'''.  Spider-Man wore his black costume around this time, but after Mary Jane was attacked and frightened by [[Venom (comics)|Venom]], she convinced him to change back to his old costume in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' (Vol. 1) #300 (May 1988). 

Mary Jane continued to model after her marriage, but was stalked by her wealthy landlord, Jonathan Caesar.  When she rejected his advances, he had her blacklisted as a model.  She got a role on the soap opera "Secret Hospital," but was unhappy with her character's air-headed and mean personality.  Although she successfully petitioned her boss to adjust her character's personality, a deranged fan tried to kill Mary Jane out of hatred for the actions of her soap opera character.  Mary Jane quit her job out of fear for her own safety.

Due to this stress, the recent death of [[Harry Osborn]], and the seeming return of her husband's parents, Mary Jane began smoking (a habit she had quit in high school), only increasing the tension between her and Peter.  When his parents were discovered to be fakes, Peter was unable to cope with the knowledge and disappeared for a time.  Mary Jane visited her sister Gayle and her father for the first time in years, and finally reconciled with them.  Meanwhile, Peter overcame his problems on his own.  When she and Peter reunited, both were happier than they had been in a long time.

Shortly afterward, Peter's clone [[Ben Reilly]] returned, marking the beginning of the [[Clone Saga]].  Mary Jane discovered that she was pregnant.  While she experienced some complications in her pregnancy, Reilly's scientist friend [[Seward Trainer]] helped her.  Peter and Ben were told by Trainer that Ben was the real Peter Parker, and Peter was the clone (which later proved to be a lie).  Peter, acting on hypnotic suggestion by the [[Jackal (comics)|Jackal]], attempted to kill Mary Jane, but was prevented by Ben Reilly (as the Scarlet Spider), his teammates the [[New Warriors]], and [[Kaine]].  Later, while arguing with Ben, Peter accidentally struck Mary Jane.  After this, he decided to quit as Spider-Man, because the stress of his double life was endangering his wife and unborn child.

Peter and Mary Jane left New York and moved to Portland, Oregon.  While there, he lost his powers in a lab accident.  They lived there peacefully for several months, adapting happily to normal life.  However, they missed New York City and their friends, and moved back.  Peter became unexpectedly ill and nearly died, but instead regained his powers.  During the [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] crisis, Mary Jane was scanned by a [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] robot, who detected genetic abnormalities in her fetus.

Soon afterward, when Mary Jane's baby was already past due, she was poisoned by [[Alison Mongraine]], an agent of the [[Green Goblin]].  Mary Jane's baby was stillborn (or seemed to be, as Mongraine apparently took the sedated infant away with her.  The baby has not been seen since in the normal continuity, but see [[#Spider-Girl|below]]).  Ben Reilly died at the Green Goblin's hands the same night.

After this tragic turn of events, Mary Jane begged Peter to quit being Spider-Man.  He was happy to do so for several months, but soon felt the tug of his great power and great responsibility to be a hero. Mary Jane returned to college and majored in [[psychology]], but eventually became bored and decided to return to modelling, where she reached new heights of success.  Peter became Spider-Man again behind Mary Jane's back, which put strain on their marriage yet again.  At the same time, she began receiving lewd and threatening phone calls from an anonymous stalker.

Mary Jane was flying across America when her airplane exploded in midair.  Peter was shocked and went into deep denial over her death.  Although he was set up with several other women, and his friends encouraged him to move on, he was unable to believe she was dead.

He was proven right when her mysterious stalker, an unnamed, telepathic mutant, made himself known.  This stalker had telepathically connected to Peter in some way, and wanted to take over his life.  He kidnapped Mary Jane as part of his plan and held her hostage for several months.  The stalker, however, killed himself after finally gleaning enough of Peter's personality and morality to discover that he had done terrible things.  Peter and Mary Jane were reunited.

However, the stress of her captivity drove Mary Jane away.  She moved to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and immersed herself in acting -- starring as the doomed love interest in the film "Lobster-Man."  Although she missed Peter terribly, after he failed to meet her flight, she refused to talk to him.  However, when the villainess [[Shathra]] claimed to have had an affair with Spider-Man, Peter's first act was to call Mary Jane and assure her it was a lie.  After he defeated Shathra, Mary Jane and Peter ended their separation.

When Peter and Mary Jane's apartment and Aunt May's house were burned down by Charlie Weiderman, and Spider-Man joined the [[Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]], Mary Jane and Aunt May accompanied him to live in [[Stark Tower]].  Mary Jane immediately felt at home with the New Avengers and was happy to finally be part of Spider-Man's "world."

With a bit of strain at first, a jealous Peter swore to himself that he would find a new home for his family, but when his initial jealousy subsided, the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] events forced him to stage a secret transfer of Mary Jane out of Stark Mansion, feeling that with the loss of his [[secret identity]] and his doubts about Tony Stark's ideas, Mary Jane has become an hostage in a luxurious house.

MJ remains supportive about the whole ordeal.

===Controversies===
{{npov}}
According to Stan Lee, Mary Jane was originally intended to be simply a rival for Gwen Stacy for the affections of Peter Parker. Lee had always intended for Gwen Stacy to be Spider-Man's one true love, but fans vocally supported the feisty Mary Jane over the non-offensive Gwen Stacy. The pairing of Mary Jane and Peter Parker has become one of the true classic romances of the comic medium and the couple are considered to be one of the superhero genre's most beloved "super-couples".

However, many professional writers, artists, and editors (including artist [[Alex Ross]], and former Editor-In-Chief [[Bob Harras]]) at Marvel dislike the pairing and the Mary Jane character.  Some feel that Mary Jane, as a highly attractive [[model (person)|model]], should never be attracted to an [[everyman]] character like Peter Parker.  Current Marvel Editor-In-Chief [[Joe Quesada]] has said that he feels the marriage ages the characters, making them less appealing to young readers, and lessens the dramatic, "[[soap opera]]" possibilities.   However, Quesada did admit that "divorcing or widowing, or annulling the marriage [...] would only be worse." [http://www.newsarama.com/JoeFridays/JoeFridays48.html]

Fans of the pairing point out that their relationship evolved naturally and realistically, the characters seemed older after decades of stories anyway, and that Mary Jane was aware of Peter's heroic identity (explaining her initial attraction to [[Spider-man|Peter Parker]]).  Mary Jane remains a popular character, even spinning off into her own [[Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane|comic series]], and some feel that she is used unfairly as a [[scapegoat]] for other problems.

===Skills and equipment===
Mary Jane has no special powers, but due to her relationship with Spider-Man and her job as an actress and model, she has found herself in danger many times. Having learned of the risk at the expense of her friend, [[Gwen Stacy|Gwen Stacy's]] life she is unwilling to be completely dependent on others for her safety.

Mary Jane has some training in self-defense with teachers including [[Captain America]].  She has been able to fend off attackers of normal strength and skill, including the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] using a [[baseball bat]], one obsessive stalker using a can of hair spray and a heavy purse, and another using a [[cue stick]].  On another occasion, she knocked out a kidnapper with a lamp and electrified his bodyguards with it.  Furthermore, there were several occasions in which she saved Spider-Man's life from his super-powered enemies: she distracted [[Alistair Smythe]] and his [[Spider-Slayer]] with a baseball bat, and set fire to [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]]'s cape. Recently, she managed to defeat [[Swarm (comics)|Swarm]], a supervillain even her husband had trouble defeating, by using sprinklers. Mary Jane rarely plays the helpless [[damsel in distress]].

Mary Jane also carries a gun (although Peter dislikes the idea) which she uses against the [[Green Goblin]] in ''[[Sensational Spider-Man (vol. 2)|Marvel Knights Spider-Man]]'' #12.  After Peter developed organic webshooters, he modified his original [[Spider-Man's powers and equipment#Web-shooters|webshooters]] into bracelets that she could wear discreetly, giving her an additional defensive weapon.  She also carries a modified [[Spider-Man's powers and equipment#Spider-tracers|spider-tracer]] with an amplified signal that can be traced over long distances.

Mary Jane has used her fashion design and sewing skills on many occasions to make and repair Spider-Man's costumes.  She also designed the [[Hornet (comics)|Hornet]], [[Prodigy (comics)|Prodigy]], and [[Ricochet (comics)|Ricochet]] costumes.  She is usually the person who provides [[first aid]] when Peter is injured.

On one occasion, she was possessed by [[Red Sonja]] and battled [[Kulan Gath]], but she has no memory of those events (''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' vol. 1 #79).  On another occasion, she borrowed [[Iron Man]]'s old armor temporarily.

==Alternate versions==
===House of M===
In the '''[[House of M]]''' storyline and universe (in which [[Avengers (comics)|Avenger]] [[Scarlet Witch]] finally snapped and began changing reality), Mary Jane is a world-famous actress, and she is one of the few humans that the mutant population likes. She co-starred in movies with Spider-Man (who has led the mutant population to believe that he is a mutant, when in fact he isn't). In her latest movie, she plays Spider-Man's real-life wife, Gwen Stacy.

===''Spider-Girl''===
{{Main|Spider-Girl}}
In the [[MC2]] continuity, Mary Jane was reunited with her baby daughter by [[Kaine]], who found the child living with Alison Mongraine, the con artist who had kidnapped the baby on instruction from the [[Green Goblin]].  Baby May grew to become May "Mayday" Parker, aka [[Spider-Girl]].  Alison Mongraine became quite attached to the baby while she was in her care.  Though she was thought to have been killed by Kaine, she returns years later to make contact with May.  May and Mary Jane forgive Alison, who sincerely regrets her crime and loves the girl like her own child.

After a complicated pregnancy, Mary Jane also gives birth to a baby son, [[Benjamin Richard Parker|Benjamin]].  She is a respected fashion designer and businesswoman, and secretly starts a store based on Spider-Girl related merchandise to pay for May's and Ben's educations.

===''Ultimate Marvel''===

[[Image:Ultimate_mj.png|thumb|150px|Ultimate Mary Jane.]]

The ''[[Ultimate Marvel]]'' continuity version of Mary Jane first appears in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' #1 by [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and [[Mark Bagley]].  She attends Midtown High School with Peter Parker and Liz Allen.  Though originally known as "Mary" to her friends, she later picks up the "MJ" nickname. Unlike the original MJ, Ultimate Mary Jane is a brilliant student and expresses her true feelings instead of masquerading as a party girl.  She and Peter begin dating, and, in ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #13, she becomes the second person to learn of Peter's secret identity and the first Peter reveals it to.  She sews Peter's spare Spider-Man costumes, once calling herself the [[Betsy Ross]] of superheroes.  Although Peter and MJ love each other very much, Peter's Spider-Man identity proves a heavy burden on their relationship.  The relationship is complicated when [[Gwen Stacy#Ultimate Marvel|Gwen Stacy]] enters their lives.

Later, Peter began to fear for Mary Jane's safety more than ever when the [[Green Goblin#Ultimate Green Goblin|Green Goblin]] kidnapped her in a twisted attempt to gain Peter's allegiance and flung her off the Queensboro bridge. MJ survived, but was left traumatized.  In "Hobgoblin" (#72-78), it was said Harry and Mary Jane had engaged in a brief romance around the same day Peter was bitten. Then, long after his father is gunned down as the Green Goblin, Harry tells her that Peter "killed his father".  Recently, Peter ended the relationship after realizing his life as a superhero will always endanger her.  Shortly thereafter, Mary Jane went out with a character named Mark Raxton.  After one date, however, she planned to prove herself to Peter and to get him back.  When Raxton asked what was so special about Parker, she simply replied "everything." Presently, she has shown difficulty in moving on from Peter and in dealing with the state of their friendship, especially now that Peter has recently dated [[Shadowcat|Kitty Pryde]]. However, Peter has shown an interest in reconciling their differences, and becoming, if not a couple, friends again.

At one time, MJ had expressed her wish to become an actress, but now dreams of being a 'Teacher who Cares'.

[[Image:Ultimate_MJ_Goblin.jpg|thumb|left|Mary Jane, transformed by OZ. Art by [[Mark Bagley]].]]

As part of the '[[Clone Saga]]' arc of Ultimate Spider-Man, MJ has been kidnapped from her bedroom by a clone of Peter Parker who is determined to give her powers so that she is no longer in danger. She undergoes an unknown surgery by the clone, who tells her 'It's a whole new you'. He reveales that he has injected her with an unquantified amount of OZ, the drug responsible for the creation of the Ultimate [[Green Goblin#Ultimate Green Goblin|Green Goblin]] and [[Harry Osborn#Ultimate Harry Osborn|Hobgoblin]]. Upon learning this, she becomes upset and transforms into a huge, horned red goblin-type creature, (Refered to by Bendis as Ultimate [[Demogoblin]]) However, when the Real Peter Parker and Spider-Woman turn up, she calms down and resumes her original form, just in time for Peter (her ex) to slug his evil clone unconscious.

===''Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane''===
{{main|Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane}}
In ''Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane'', a comic book series set outside the regular [[Earth-616|Marvel continuity]], Mary Jane is still a teenager and the book is primarily a [[teen drama]] rather than a [[superhero]] comic book, although it takes place in a superhero universe with Spider-Man playing a prominent role.  In this continuity, Mary Jane is reguarded as the most popular girl at Midtown high (her high school in Queens, NY) and was even voted homecoming queen. She had a brief infatuation with Spider-man until she went on a date with him and realized that she would much rather be with Peter Parker. The ongoing series was preceded by two four-issue [[limited series]], ''[[Mary Jane (comic)|Mary Jane]]'' and ''[[Mary Jane: Homecoming]]''.

[[Image:Exs034.jpg|right|120px|thumb|Mary Jane as Spider-Woman in the cover for Exiles #34, by Tony Harris & Tom Feister.]]



===Spider-Man: Reign===
In the upcoming limited series, [[Spider-Man: Reign]], Mary Jane will appear. The series is an alternate future where she has died.

===As Spider-Woman in ''Exiles''===
In the ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]'' arcs "Legacy", "A Second Farewell" and a cameo in "Destroy All Monsters", an alternate reality counterpart to Mary Jane Watson  was shown. This Mary Jane is [[Spider-Woman]], a member of the Avengers. Mary Jane is a [[lesbian]] who fell in love with the reality-hopping Mariko Yashida, the ill-fated Exiles member Sunfire. For more information, read the article for [[Sunfire (Exiles)|Sunfire]].

[[Image:MJspiderwoman.jpg|left|120px|thumb|MJ as Spider-Woman (with Peter). Cover to New Mangaverse #1. Art by Tommy Ohtsuka.]]

===As Spider-Woman in ''Marvel Mangaverse''===
In the ''[[Marvel Mangaverse]]'' reality, Mary Jane Watson is [[Spider-Woman]]. She is a new initiate into the Spider-clan (of [[ninjas]]), with her boyfriend (Peter Parker) showing her the ropes.

===As the Insect Queen in Amalgam===
In the [[Amalgam Comics]]' reality, Mary Jane Watson is the [[Insect Queen (Amalgam Comics)|Insect Queen]], and the fiance of [[Spider-Boy]]. She has the power to mimic the physical abilities of any insect or arachnid.

==In film==
In both films to date, the character of Mary Jane Watson was played by [[Kirsten Dunst]].
{{spoiler}}
[[Image:Mary Jane, Spider-Man 2002.jpg|right|150px|thumb|[[Kirsten Dunst]] as Mary Jane Watson.]]
===''Spider-Man''===
In 2002's ''[[Spider-Man (film)|Spider-Man]]'', Mary Jane is Peter Parker's [[high school]] [[crush]] and only sweetheart.  At the time, she was dating the high school bully, [[Flash Thompson]].  Flash figures into the comic storyline in more detail, but his initial purpose is the same - to cause Peter to begin to stand up for himself and gain some measure of self confidence.  Flash and MJ break up at their high school grad ceremony.  Parker's friend, Harry Osborn, is her first boyfriend after leaving high school, but she manages to fall in love with Parker and his alter-ego, Spider-Man.  Mary Jane begins to grow more distant from Harry, denying his advances. After Harry sees Peter and MJ holding hands, he gets angry and breaks up with her.

The Green Goblin, who is Harry's father [[Norman Osborn]]'s alter ego, kidnaps her and holds her over the [[Queensboro Bridge]].  He tells Spider-Man that he must choose between her and a group of children caught in the [[Roosevelt Island]] tram car.  Spider-Man manages to save both Mary Jane and the children. (In the comic book, it was [[Gwen Stacy]] who was held over a bridge, and Spider-Man's attempt to save her failed.)

The Green Goblin announces plans to [[torture]] and kill Mary Jane to Spider-Man during the climax, but he dies before having the chance to act upon his threat.

Peter shies away from Mary Jane at the end of the film as he is afraid for her safety, and thus does not want to get involved with her.

===''Spider-Man 2''===
In 2004's ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'', Mary Jane's hair is now a more realistic shade of red (not the bright red from the comics.) She wants to start a relationship with Peter Parker.  Peter backs away from a relationship with her even though he wants one because he fears for her safety.  In her frustration Mary Jane goes on to have a relationship with [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]], the astronaut son of Daily Bugle publisher [[J. Jonah Jameson]].

The movie hints that she is doing this in the hope of making Peter jealous.  Peter decides that being Spider-Man is not what he wants and comes back to Mary Jane so that he could start a relationship with her.  Mary Jane pushes him away this time because she is getting married to John Jameson, but secretly does want a relationship with Peter.  After kissing the astronaut, in a manner that is reminiscent of the upside-down kiss between Mary Jane and Spider-Man from the first Spider-Man movie, she finds that she may really want a relationship with Peter Parker.

She meets Peter in a coffee shop where she asks for a kiss to confirm her beliefs.  Just before Peter can kiss her [[Doctor Octopus]] snatches her and runs away.  Doctor Octopus takes her to an abandoned pier where Spider-Man confronts him.  Spider-Man pulls his mask off in hopes of getting Doctor Octopus to come back to his senses, and Mary Jane realizes that Spider-Man and Peter Parker are one and the same.

Mary Jane runs away from her wedding with John Jameson and comes to Peter's door where she tells him that she is grown up enough to make her own decisions and she loves him and will take him as Spider-Man knowing the danger it poses to her life.

===''Spider-Man 3''===
Mary Jane returns in ''[[Spider-Man 3]]''. Both she and [[Harry Osborn]] now know Peter's true identity. It's revealed that Peter is intending to ask Mary Jane to marry him. It is shown in the trailer, that she tries to help Peter confront the symbiote suit as it begins to take control of him. She also begins a rivalry with [[Gwen Stacy]] for Peter's affections.

==In TV shows and cartoons==
[[Image:Spidermanep50.jpg|thumb|right|Animated Mary Jane in [[Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]]]
In the ''[[Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'', Mary Jane Watson first meets a 19-year-old Peter Parker in "The Return of the Spider-Slayers" (Season #1 Ep #4).  Mary Jane supplants [[Debra Whitman]] and [[Black Cat (comics)|Felicia Hardy]] as his primary love interest. She was played by [[Sara Ballantine]].  She is last seen in Season #3 Episode 41, "Turning Point," in which the Green Goblin discovers Spider-Man's true identity.  In a nod to [[The Night Gwen Stacy Died]], he takes her to the George Washington Bridge.  Spider-Man tries to save her, but she falls into a dimensional portal created by his stolen [[time dilation]] accelerator (due to the show's censorship no one in the show could die, she was forced into limbo and Spider-Man didn't know about her falling into limbo).  In Season 4, a clone of Mary Jane created by [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Miles Warren]] appears, and after the death of Mysterio at the end of the ninth episode of Season 4, Spider-Man revealed he was Peter to her and MJ and Peter marry in the first episode of Season 5.  Later, her true nature is revealed and she (and a clone of [[Hydro-Man]]) dissolve due to their unstable cellular structure.  By the series finale, after Spider-Man saved all reality from the villain known as Spider-Carnage, Spider-Man's mystic advisor, Madame Web, promised they would find the real Mary Jane (as she promised when she took Spider-Man from Earth after the Mary Jane clone died before the Secret War, which was a test to see if Spider-Man could stop Spider-Carnage).

The "true" Mary Jane is never seen again in this series, but is shown to have been reunited with and married to Peter in the sequel, [[Spider-Man Unlimited]].  [[Jennifer Hale]] provided her voice. It was never revealed how she returned (supposedly, the writers left this for the next season, which was never made).  However, producer of the previous show, John Semper, revealed if he continued the show, Mary Jane would have been found in a Colonial England.

Mary Jane also appeared in MTV's ''[[Spider-Man: The New Animated Series]]'' (where she was voiced by [[Lisa Loeb]]), taking place shortly after the events of the first live-action movie.  In ''Mind Games: Part 1'', like in the movie, Mary Jane discovers that Spider-Man is Peter Parker, but it was revealed to be a dream sequence.

In the Tokusatsu version of [[Spider-Man (tokusatsu)|Spider-Man]], Mary Jane Watson was called Hitomi Sakuma (played by [[Rika Miura]]).

Although she did not appear in ''[[Spider-Man and his Amazing Friends]]'' the character [[Firestar]], a female version of the [[Human Torch]], resembles Mary Jane in appearance. Also, like Mary Jane, Firestar, with the alternate identity of Angelica Jones, is a college student and classmate of Peter Parker.

==In literature==
[[Image:Maryjanenovel.jpg|thumb|''Mary Jane: A Novel''.]] Romance novelist [[Judith O'Brien]] wrote two novels featuring a teenage Mary-Jane. It featured illustrations by Mike Mayhew. It doesn't fit into any of the comics' continuity, although it claims to be 'inspired' by ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''.

The first novel is a basic retelling of the origin story from Mary-Jane's point of view. She is depicted as a shy, insecure girl who knew Peter Parker from elementary school. She deals with such teen topics like anorexia and peer pressure. 

At a field trip to Osborn Industries, Peter is bitten by a spider, which grants him powers. It is later revealed that Norman Osborn had injected a super drug known as OZ into the spider, which he later uses as a sports drink which he sells to Mary Jane's classmates. (The use of OZ is the only real connection to ''Ultimate'', but even that is drastically different from the way its portrayed in the original comics.)

As Peter suits up to become Spider-Man (his origin with Uncle Ben is made apparent but off screen), Mary Jane sets out to expose Norman with the help of Peter.

The novel was successful with teenage girls who weren't familiar with the comics, but was met with criticism from the core fans due to what they considered mischaracterization of some of the characters (most notably Harry Osborn, who is portrayed as somewhat of a punk who manipulates Peter into doing his homework while treating him horribly) and its fooling around with continuity.

A sequel, ''Mary Jane 2'' was later published. This one dealt with the continuing relationship of Peter and Mary Jane, and the emergence of new girl [[Gwen Stacy]]. In this continuity, Gwen is an 'ugly duckling' who Mary-Jane gives a 'makeover'. However, Gwen soon has feelings for Peter. 

Harry Osborn reappears and is made more sympathetic than he was in the previous novel; with his father in jail, he is now poor and has to live without a life of luxury.

==Action figures and dolls==
*An action figure of Mary Jane was released based on her appearance in ''[[Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]''.  <!-- I believe this was part of a two-pack with Spider-Man.  I think there was a variant "holiday" version as well. -->
*A 6-inch scale action figure and a 12-inch scale doll of Mary Jane were released to coincide with the 2002 [[Spider-Man (film)|Spider-Man film]].  Both were based on the likeness of [[Kirsten Dunst]] and wore the Asian-inspired red dress she wore in the film.  These figures were released by [[Toy Biz]].
*A [[Barbie]] version of Mary Jane was released by [[Mattel]] in 2005.  The doll's clothing was based on the wedding gown she wore in ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]] Annual'' #21, 1987.
*Mary Jane was included in a two-pack with Peter Parker in [[Art Asylum]]'s [[Minimates]] small-scale figure series.  This set was a [[Fan convention|convention]] exclusive.
*[[Art Asylum]] produced a full-body statuette of Mary Jane based on her appearance in the early 1970s, identical except for its paint application to a simultaneously-released statue of [[Gwen Stacy]].
*[[Moore Collectibles]] produced an 8-inch [[bust (sculpture)|bust]] (actually from the knees up, nearly a full statue) of Mary Jane based on her first full appearance.

==Video game appearances==

Mary Jane appears in almost every Spider-Man [[video game]], but almost exclusively as a victim of kidnapping who must be saved.

*In the [[Spider-Man (video game)|Spider-Man game]] for Playstation, Venom believes Spider-Man stole something (it is later revealed that a Mysterio was the thief) and kidnapps Mary Jane in attempt to get revenge. She is held in the sewers and must be rescued by Spider-Man.

*In [[Spider-Man: Mysterio's Menace]], Mary Jane forgets to purchase a fish bowl for her fish and asks Peter to retrieve one for her at the beginning of the game. In the end Peter manages to obtain one for her and says "You'll never know the trouble I went through for this."

*In the video game ''[[Spider-Man: The Movie]]'', Mary Jane appears several times as a [[damsel in distress]]. The first classic refference to MJ given is on the first level where if the player chooses to run around the city and search certain building roofs, they will find a purse. Peter will remark "hey, someone left a purse up here." giving credit to those classic games in which spidey's goal is to retreive Mary Janes' purse.However, if  the player goes and talks to the thug with information on uncle Bens' killer, then goes back to a different rooftop, they will find a lady (not Mj) being assulted by two thugs. If you save her, she will ask you to get her her purse. By doing this, the player gets that levels secret unlocked and 700 points.The player saves her at the World Unity Festival, and she kisses Spider-Man, beginning the romantic relationship between the pair throughout the game. In another level, Mary Jane is kidnapped by the [[Green Goblin]]. The final battle begins with the player having to save Mary Jane from a platform on the bridge, which is on fire. After the player defeats the Green Goblin, Spider-Man is about to tell her his secret identity and she interupts him and tells him that "she knows" before kissing him. It is never revealed just what MJ "knows", but it appears to be that she knows his secret identity, although this contradicts the sequel.

*MJ appears in ''[[Spider-Man 2 (video game)|Spider-Man 2]]'', voiced by [[Kirsten Dunst]]. In this game, she is unaware of Peter's being Spider-Man.

*In the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' video game, Mary Jane's Ultimate version appears several times in the game, helping the player to research and discover information on the villains the player must fight. The game ends with her talking to the player. In the [[Nintendo DS]] version of the game, the player must save an unnamed character who has Mary Jane's clothing and hair colour.

*Mary Jane will appear in [[Spider-Man: Battle for New York]]. Although, it is currently unknown what role she will play. <ref>http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/734/734911p1.html</ref>

==Quotation==
"Face it, Tiger... you just hit the jackpot!"&mdash;her first words to Peter Parker, initially appearing in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' (Vol. 1) #42 (November 1966), are by far her most famous words, and indeed, one of the most famous quotations in the Marvel Universe, duplicated in nearly every continuity in which Mary Jane appears.  A non-exhaustive list of comic books and media the quotation appears in:
* ''Amazing Spider-Man: Parallel Lives'' (January 1990)
* ''[[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]]'' #6 (June 1997) &mdash; [[Typhoid Mary (comics)|Typhoid Mary]] parodies the quotation
*''Spider-Man: Blue'' #2 (August 2002)
*''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #13 (November 2001)
*''Spider-Boy'' #1 by [[Insect Queen (Amalgam Comics)|Mary Jane Watson (Insect Queen)]] 
*''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'' #105 (reprinted as ''[[Spider-Girl]]'' #0): delivered by MJ's and Peter's daughter May (aka Spider-Girl) in the alternate [[MC2]] universe
*In ''[[Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'', the quote was also recited by Mary Jane, when she first appeared in the episode ''Return of the Spider Slayers''.
*Although not fully said, in the [[Spider-Man (movie)|Spider-Man movie]], Mary Jane says to Peter, "See you later, Tiger."
*In addition, the line is also said in ''[[Clerks II]]'' by Dante's fiance when they discuss his coming new life.
