'''[[Lady]] Elaine Marsh-Morton''', a.k.a. “Lady Vic” is a [[fictional character]] in the [[DC Comics]] universe. She is an [[England|English]] noblewoman who works secretly as an [[assassin]], [[bounty hunter]], and [[mercenary]].  She is employed on a semi-regular basis by [[Blockbuster (comics)|Roland Desmond]], a.k.a. Blockbuster, and appears most frequently as an antagonist of Nightwing ([[Dick Grayson]]).

Her sobriquet “Lady Vic” is short for "Lady Victim," referring to any of her possible targets.

==Fictional character biography==
Lady Elaine is descended from a long line of British soldiers and mercenaries, and a genuine English aristocrat.  The money she earns from her secret career helps prevent foreclosure on her impoverished family estate.

She first appeared in ''Nightwing #4''; having completed an assignment for [[Blüdhaven]] gang boss Antonio “Angel” Marin, she returned to Blüdhaven to collect her fee, and was upset to find Marin missing.  She tracked down Marin’s lawyer, and threatened to kill his young daughter if she wasn’t paid – a threat she definitely would have carried out, if Nightwing had not intervened.  [[Torque (comics)|Dudley Soames]] informed her that Marin had been replaced by Blockbuster, and offered to pay her fee, with a retainer to continue working for him.  Since then, she has clashed repeatedly with Nightwing.

Elaine was one of several of Blockbuster’s hirelings tasked with tracking down [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]]. When Blockbuster was dying of heart failure, Elaine was the one entrusted with locating [[Gorilla City]] in [[Africa]], and finding him a replacement heart.

Lady Vic is later sent to eliminate [[Tarantula (DC Comics)|Tarantula]], Blockbuster's latest ally, when Blockbuster learns Tarantula had disobeyed his orders.  Tarantula defeats Lady Vic, shooting her in the stomach (Nightwing 95).

===[[One Year Later]]===

Lady Vic is hired by [[Doctor Psycho]] and [[Cheshire (comics)|Cheshire]] in an attempt to destroy the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]]. Together with [[Double Dare (comics)|Double Dare]] she faces [[Deadshot]] in a park with his wife and child, who run away once the attackers appear.  Unarmed, Deadshot is easily defeated by Double Dare, and is about to be executed by Lady Vic when his wife throws him a gun, allowing him to get the upper hand.  Deadshot considers killing his would-be assassins but allows them to escape, not wanting to shoot them in front of his daughter.

When not on a job, she rests easy in the company of her hulking manservant, Bivens.  Her drink of choice is [[Darjeeling tea]]. More recently, she was seen among the new [[Injustice League]] and is one of the villains featured in ''[[Salvation Run]]''. She also appears in Secret Six #4 (February, 2008).

==Powers and Abilities==

Elaine is a highly skilled martial artist and athlete, and equally skilled with firearms. She has a sentimental preference for a collection of antique weapons handed down by her ancestors, souvenirs of their [[Colonialism|colonial]] exploits: a matched pair of [[Katar|Bundi daggers]], a [[Japan]]ese [[katana]], a [[Thuggee]] strangling cloth, a [[Maasai]] javelin, and a [[Webley revolver]].

Of the mercenaries regularly employed by Blockbuster, Elaine is one of the most skilled, certainly more skilled than [[Brutale (comics)|Brutale]], [[Stallion (comics)|Stallion]], or [[Electrocutioner]], though not on the level of opponents such as Nightwing or [[Batman]].  When Blockbuster decided to test [[Shrike (comics)#Boone|Shrike]]’s abilities by pitting him against all of his regular assassins at once, Elaine lasted the longest, and was the only one to actually inflict a wound on him before being knocked out.

Lady Vic also has qualities of determination and ruthlessness that set her apart from the others.  Possibly this is because she desperately needs the money she earns, for the sake of her family’s continued standing and honor. As mentioned above, she was more than willing to kill a young girl to get paid; during the ''Hunt for [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]]'' storyline, when [[Black Canary (comics)|Black Canary]] escaped from a plane in which she was being held prisoner, Lady Vic astonished her by leaping into the sky after her, without a parachute.
