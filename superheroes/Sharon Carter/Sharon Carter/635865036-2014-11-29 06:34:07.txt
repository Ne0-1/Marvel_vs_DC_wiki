'''Sharon Carter''', alias '''Agent 13''', is a [[fictional character]], a [[secret agent]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. She is an ex-field [[wiktionary:agent|agent]] of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] under [[Nick Fury]] and the girlfriend of [[Captain America]].

In original continuity, Sharon was said to be the younger sister of [[Peggy Carter]], the wartime [[Romantic interest|love interest]] of Captain America, but she was later [[retcon]]ned as Peggy's niece because of the [[floating timeline|unaging nature]] of [[comic book]] characters. She was portrayed by [[Emily VanCamp]] in the film ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]''.

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=March 2013}}
Created by [[Stan Lee]], [[Jack Kirby]], and [[Dick Ayers]], Sharon first appeared in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #75 (March 1966).

Carter was apparently killed in ''Captain America'' #233. The character was revived in ''Captain America'' #444 by [[Mark Waid]], who commented, "The reason she works so well with Cap is because she's a complete cynic and he's a complete idealist."<ref>{{cite news | last = Senreich | first= Matthew | date = August 1997 | title = The Wizard Q&A: Mark Waid & Ron Garney | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] | issue = 72 | pages = 68–72}}</ref>

Sharon Carter appeared as a supporting character in the 2010-2013 ''Secret Avengers'' series, from issue #1 (July 2010) through issue #21 (March 2012).

==Fictional character biography==
Sharon was born in [[Richmond, Virginia]], the daughter of two wealthy [[Virginia]]ns, Harrison and Amanda Carter. She grew up with the stories of her aunt ([[Peggy Carter|Margaret "Peggy" Carter]]) who was a [[freedom fighter]] with the [[French Resistance]] during [[World War II]]. Inspired by her aunt's adventures, Sharon joined the international security agency S.H.I.E.L.D., and was assigned the code name "Agent 13". By this time, Steve Rogers, the patriotic hero known as [[Captain America]], had been revived from [[suspended animation]], and during one of Sharon's earliest missions, he came to her aid when she came under attack by a [[mercenary]] known as [[Batroc the Leaper]]. The two of them crossed paths again and again, teaming up on several missions against [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]], [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]], [[Red Skull]], and many others.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

Over time, Sharon and Rogers eventually fall in love; the dangerous nature of Sharon's work constantly puts a strain on their relationship, with Rogers wanting Sharon to give up her life as a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.<ref>{{cite book |title=Heroes of film, comics and American culture|last=Detora|first=Lisa|year= 2009|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-3827-3|page=113}}</ref>

While working as a S.H.I.E.L.D. liaison with the [[New York Police Department]], Sharon investigated and infiltrated a [[white supremacy|white supremacist]] terrorist organization known as the [[National Force]]. During one of the National Force's battles with street criminals in [[Harlem]], the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] was sent in to put an end to it. Under the effects of a mind-altering gas, Sharon apparently activated a self-destruct device in her National Force uniform and committed suicide. Rogers was shown the event on videotape.<ref name="captainamerica237">''Captain America'' #237, Sept. 1979</ref>

It was later revealed that her death had been faked so that Sharon could be free to go on a top secret mission for S.H.I.E.L.D. The mission did not go well, and [[Nick Fury]], S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Executive Director, believed her to have been killed in action. Captain America was therefore not informed of the true circumstances of her "death".{{issue|date=March 2013}}

===Return===
Sharon was not dead, but had been left behind in enemy territory, a captive of the dictator Tap-Kwai. Escaping, she spent several years working as a mercenary, until she came across a group of [[Neo-Nazi]] extremists known as the Kubecult. Learning that they were planning to use the [[Cosmic Cube]] to return [[Adolf Hitler]] to life, Sharon joined forces with the villainous [[Red Skull]] to stop them, but they also needed Captain America.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

At this point, Rogers was suffering health problems: the Super-Soldier serum that gave him his abilities was breaking down and had placed him in a coma. As the Red Skull was currently occupying a cloned body of Rogers himself, a transfusion of the Skull's blood&mdash;with an uncontaminated Super-Soldier formula&mdash;was able to restore and revive Rogers. Rogers was shocked to find Sharon alive, and over the course of the mission to topple the cult discovered that her years out in the cold had given her a more ruthless, grimmer personality.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

The two of them did not renew their relationship, but a certain amount of romantic tension continues to exist between them when she rejoins S.H.I.E.L.D. She teases him about his naivete, such as letting a family of squatters stay in his apartment (they had moved in when he was missing, he did not wish to kick them out). The two battle such foes as [[Count Nefaria]]. Sharon assists Captain America in battling the cosmic powered [[Red Skull]]. The Skull was in control of a [[cosmic cube]], which could do whatever he wished, as long as he concentrated on it. Sharon and Captain America argue many times about killing the Skull, Sharon urging him to use his energy-based shield, a device which Sharon had given him. Sharon would try to kill the Red Skull, and fail. The Red Skull was soon defeated through trickery. The energy shield was lost in the time-stream.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

Soon afterwards, Sharon assists Captain America in several cases of [[patriotic]] Americans going on violent rampages. The supernatural entity [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]] had found a way to influence this dimension through the '[[American dream]]'. Sharon and Cap would battle many patriotic people, including a temporarily insane U.S. Agent. Ultimately, Sharon has to face down an affected Captain America.<ref>These events took place in ''Captain America'' Volume 3, issues 9&ndash;12 (1998), reprinted in the hardcover "Captain America: American Nightmare".</ref>

===21st Century===
Sharon served a brief term as Executive Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., during the absence of Nick Fury. She then became a field agent once more, reporting directly to The Head of Special Internal Operations - Director Jacob Strzeszewski ([[Agent 10]]), and then to the new Sub Executive Director [[Maria Hill]] as a liaison officer specifically assigned to support and report on Captain America's activities. While investigating the whereabouts of Jack Monroe, she was abducted by the [[Bucky#Winter Soldier|Winter Soldier]], and used as bait to lure Captain America to a trap set by General [[Aleksander Lukin]]. She and Captain America later resumed their relationship while on a field mission investigating the activities of the [[Bucky#Winter Soldier|Winter Soldier]].{{issue|date=March 2013}}

Sharon was initially a supporter of the [[Civil War (comics)|Superhuman Registration Act]]. She was averse to actually aiding in the capture of her lover, Captain America, who is the leader of the "Secret Avengers" opposed to the Act. At the same time, it was also revealed that she is in some way an unknowing pawn of the [[Red Skull]] and his associate [[Doctor Faustus (comics)|Doctor Faustus]]. She later fell into contact with [[Nick Fury]]'s underground organization, even as she was reassigned to the S.H.I.E.L.D. task force charged with locating Fury. She also switched her allegiance to Captain America, citing the death of [[Bill Foster (comics)|Goliath]] as the primary reason; it is unclear how much of this results from Faustus' influence.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

In a follow-up in ''Captain America'' #25, Steve Rogers is shot in the shoulder by a sniper on his way up the steps to the Federal Court. In the ensuing crowd chaos, he is shot three times in the abdomen with a pistol, and later appears to die of his injuries. It is later revealed that the plan was orchestrated by the Red Skull; the sniper was [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]], and Sharon Carter, under a hypnotic suggestion by [[Doctor Faustus (comics)|Dr. Faustus]], was the person who had shot Rogers in the abdomen.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

It has been revealed that she is still under the influence of Doctor Faustus, who uses her to disable Black Widow and Falcon, before having her join the Red Skull's organization as a minion. It has also been revealed that she is apparently pregnant with Rogers' child. During several attempts to escape the Red Skull's control over her, she loses her baby in the process during a fight between her and Sin. Later dialogue suggests that she, not Sin, stabbed her womb, and caused the miscarriage. She says that she did it to keep the Red Skull from getting his hands on anything of hers. Later Doctor Faustus made her forget ever being pregnant, and he also gave her the tools for her rescue. Sharon frees herself, and kills [[Aleksander Lukin]] (narrowly missing killing the Red Skull himself), before being found by [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] and the Falcon. Iron Man and Falcon decide to tell her about her pregnancy at a later date, after sufficient recovery time.<ref>''Captain America #41-42''</ref> As a result, Sharon decided to leave S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref>''Captain America #43''</ref>

Sharon Carter was later featured in the storyline ''[[Captain America: Reborn]]'' where she found out how she killed Captain America and planned to figure out a way to revive him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/reborn |title=Marvel Presents Captain America Reborn! |publisher=Marvel.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-10}}</ref> Unfortunately, Norman Osborn planned on the same thing, so that he could complete the Red Skull's plan to transfer his consciousness into Steve's body and have him lead his Avengers to increase his popularity. He had already framed Sharon as an accomplice in Rogers' murder and threatened to kill the second Captain America if she didn't turn herself in.<ref>''Captain America: Reborn'' #2</ref> She did and was brought to Latveria, where the same machine she was attached to brought Rogers' back, but with the Red Skull controlling his body; Mr. Fantastic determined that Sharon had chronal tracers in her blood meant to pull Steve to her.<ref>''Captain America: Reborn'' #3-4</ref> Turning herself in to Norman Osborn in order to save the life of Bucky (who, unbeknownst to her, had already escaped), she is handed over to the Skull and Dr. Doom, who use her to retrieve Steve, with the Skull's mind in control. Sharon ultimately escapes, with the help of [[Henry Pym]], and uses the Red Skull's own ship to blow him up. Reconciling with Steve (who was able to assert control over himself), they take some time off at her Virginia estate.<ref>''Captain America: Reborn'' #5-6</ref>

Sharon had been a member of an Avengers team, the [[Secret Avengers]], in [[Ed Brubaker]]'s series of the same name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=25808 |title=C2E2: Cup O' Joe |publisher=Comic Book Resources |date= |accessdate=2011-01-10}}</ref>

Sharon has apparently sacrificed herself to stop Arnim Zola's massive flying fortress from invading Earth.<ref>''Captain America'' Vol. 7 #10</ref> However, revealed that Sharon was in fact alive in Zola's captivity was found by Falcon and Jet Black.<ref>''Captain America'' Vol. 7 #23</ref>

===Ultimate Sharon Carter===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] continuity, Carter is also an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., but is much closer to the environment of [[Ultimate Spider-Man]]. She often appears as one half of a wise-cracking team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, the other half of whom is the Ultimate [[Jimmy Woo]].<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #11-14</ref> She can display humor at times, but mostly keeps her mouth shut in public. As seen in ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #46, she is a practicing [[Christian]] and has a strong set of morals, most of which point to not wanting S.H.I.E.L.D. to take individuals such as [[Otto Octavius]] and 'lock them away for poking', but to destroy them.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #46</ref> Carter and Woo survived the Super-Villains escape that occurred in [[Ultimate Six]]; Carter is seen next in the [[Silver Sable#Ultimate Marvel|Silver Sable]] arc and Woo in the [[Hobgoblin (comics)#Ultimate Hobgoblin|Hobgoblin]] arc. Carter was later involved with the [[Clone Saga]] arc telling the people that were evacuated from Peter Parker's neighborhood that all was well, and Agent Woo was later seen in the Death of a Goblin arc, letting [[Carol Danvers]] know the Goblin's most recent murder.{{issue|date=March 2013}}
