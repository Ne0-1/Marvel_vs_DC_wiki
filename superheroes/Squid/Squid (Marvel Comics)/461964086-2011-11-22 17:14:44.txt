After his mother died, Don Callahan had a hard time relating to his father "Big Mike" Callahan. He eventually fell into the wrong crowd and ended up transformed into a mouthless squid-like creature. In his first outing as a supervillain, Squid and his girlfriend [[Ms. Fortune]] battled [[Spider-Man]] on a rooftop. Spider-Man defeated them.<ref>Peter Parker: Spider-Man II#16</ref>

After their failure, the ones responsible for Squid's creation attacked him and Ms. Fortune (who barely survived). She broke up with Squid.  Squid was later hired by an unnamed Upper West Side crime boss to eliminate the local businessmen that won't sell their properties to him. Squid later dragged a cigar store owner named "Old Man" Frenzetti into the sewers and later killed him. He later confronted his father at a bar and then stormed out as Peter Parker entered. Squid later came up through the sink pipes of Miguel Vargas' coffee shop in an attempt to kill him. Miguel escaped as Mike Callahan attacked him with a baseball bat. Squid broke the bat, but was blindsided by Spider-Man. Both Spider-Man and Mike managed to calm Squid down with Mike telling his son his apology for the way he treated him. After a long talk in the night, Squid was presumably taken away by the police.<ref>Amazing Spider-Man II #26</ref>

During the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' storyline, Squid was among the villains recruited into [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]]'s unnamed supervillain army to take advantage of the Civil War. Unfortunately, [[Iron Man]] and a number of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Agents raided their headquarters.<ref>Civil War: War Crimes</ref>

Squid was among the villains recruited into [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s unnamed crime syndicate.<ref>New Avengers #35</ref>

He's recently appeared in ''[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day|Brand New Day]]'' as one of the villains (consisting of [[Coachwhip (comics)|Coachwhip]], [[Discus (comics)|Discus]], [[Doctor Nemesis]], the [[Enforcers (comics)|Enforcers]], [[Fer-de-Lance (comics)|Fer-de-Lance]], [[Hydro-Man]], [[Poundcakes]], [[Powderkeg]], [[Puff Adder (comics)|Puff Adder]], [[Rattler (comics)|Rattler]], [[Rock Python]], [[Scorpia (comics)|Scorpia]], [[Stiletto (comics)|Stiletto]], and [[Trapster]]) in the [[Bar With No Name]] watching a fight between Spider-Man and the "Basher" on [[YouTube]]. He was among those that placed their bet with the Bookie.<ref>Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 1 #562</ref> When the real Spider-Man arrived after the Spider-Man that fought Basher was actually [[Screwball (comics)|Screwball]] in disguise, Squid was among the villains that fought Spider-Man until the bartender Deke broke up the battle telling them that the Bar With No Name is a sanctuary for those on the run from the law.<ref>Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 1 #563</ref>

During the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline, Squid is one among many supervillains who joined the Hood's crime syndicate in attacking the invading [[Skrull]] force.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #7-8</ref>

During the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline, Squid is seen assisting some of [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s operatives in a raid; he and [[Man-Fish]] go into the water to get to secure a valued ship.<ref>''Dark Reign: The Hood'' #4</ref> He is seen relaxing in a lounge area inside one of the Hood's facilities.<ref>"The Punisher" #3 (2009)</ref> Squid accompanies Hood when his Crime Syndicate attacks [[Mister Negative]] and his gang.<ref>''Dark Reign: Mister Negative'' #1</ref> He alongside [[Answer (comics)|Answer]], [[Lightmaster]], [[Scorcher (comics)|Scorcher]], [[Speed Demon (comics)|Speed Demon]], [[Spot (comics)|Spot]], and [[White Rabbit (comics)|White Rabbit]] are knocked down by Spider-Man (who was corrupted to Mister Negative's side). The Squid also attacks one of Mister Negative's criminal operations, a brothel.<ref>Dark Reign: Mister Negative #2 (2009)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The third Squid can shift between his human form and his mouthless squid-like form. In his squid-like form, he possesses extendable tentacles that restrain a human with Class 10 strength. Squid can also emit foul-smelling ink from his hands. He later had an ability to emit ink constantly from his entire body. Seeing how he can fit through pipes, Squid is presumably boneless in this form.
