'''Powderkeg''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] supervillain who first appeared in Captain Marvel Special #1

==Fictional character biography==
Little is known about the man who became Powderkeg. He was a mercenary hired to steal high-tech circuitry for Brazilian crime lord [[Kristina Ramos]]. He ran afoul of Captain Marvel II ([[Monica Rambeau]]) who had thought she lost her powers after stopping a mutated Marrina. She encounters Powderkeg and used her new powers to defeat him.

Powderkeg fights the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] during a failed mass prison escape occurring at the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]] ("Venom Deathrap: The Vault"). During the incident, he follows the leader of the breakout, Venom. Teamed with [[Mentallo]] and [[Vermin (comics)|Vermin]], they temporarily defeat [[Iron Man]] and [[Hank Pym]]. The entire breakout is soon neutralized by technological means, with energy pumped through Mentallo.

Powderkeg is later recruited by [[Doctor Octopus]] to join his incarnation of the [[Masters of Evil]] during the ''[[Infinity War]]''. The Masters of Evil confront the [[Guardians of the Galaxy]] in the [[Avengers Mansion]]. Everyone becomes embroiled in a fight against evil doubles of both teams. Magus, the villain behind the Infinity War, had recruited an army of super-powered doubles to defeat and absorb Earth's superpowered resistance.

Both groups work together to survive the assault. The doubles only stop apperearing with other forces stop the Magus. Doctor Octopus wants to continue his assault on the Mansion and on the Guardians. Powderkeg and his other allies are displeased with this, unwilling to turn on those who they had literally fought back to back with just minutes ago. The Masters turn on Octopus, pursuing him out of the Mansion.

At some point, Powderkeg is finally captured and imprisoned, where he would later team up with a number of other villains against the [[She-Hulk]], although they are defeated. 

He's recently appeared in ''[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day|Brand New Day]]'' as one of the patrons of a bar catering to villains.

==Powers and abilities==
Powderkeg is superhumanly strong and highly resistant to injury.  Further, he sweats a nitroglycerin like compound which can detonate on impact, lending explosive force to his punches.
