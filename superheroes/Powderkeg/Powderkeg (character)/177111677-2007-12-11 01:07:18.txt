'''Powderkeg''' is the name of a [[Marvel Comics]] supervillain who first appeared in Captain Marvel Special #1

==Fictional character biography==
Nothing is known about the man who became Powderkeg. He was a mercenary hired to steal high-tech circuitry for Brazilian crime lord [[Kristina Ramos]]. He ran afoul of Captain Marvel II ([[Monica Rambeau]]) who thought she lost her powers after stopping a mutated Marrina. She encountered Powderkeg and used her new powers to defeat him.

Powderkeg later fought the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] during a failed mass prison escape occurring at the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]].

Powderkeg was later recruited by [[Doctor Octopus]] to join his incantation of the [[Masters of Evil]] during the ''[[Infinity War]]''. Powderkeg was among the villains that turned on Doctor Octopus.

==Powers and abilities==
Powderkeg is superhumanly strong and highly resistant to injury.  Further, he sweats a nitroglycerine like compound which can detonate on impact, lending explosive force to his punches.
