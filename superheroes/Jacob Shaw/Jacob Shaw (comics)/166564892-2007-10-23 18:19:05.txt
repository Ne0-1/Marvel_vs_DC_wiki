== Biography ==

Jacob Shaw was the ambitious son of Cornelius Shaw, Brigadier General in the British Army, and the younger brother of Lieutenant [[Esau Shaw]].

One night Jacob met [[Mister Sinister]], who for reasons unknown granted him the power of shapeshifting. With this new powers, Jacob took the form of Pierce and murdered Esau, hoping that with Esau dead, the Hellfire Club would seek Jacob to take his father's place. However, Jacob was never invited into the Hellfire Club, as Montgomery Falsworth ([[Union Jack (comics)|Union Jack]]) arrested Waltham Pierce on the grounds of treason and murder. Shaw, who had approached Pierce disguised as a seductive woman and was in bed with Pierce and another woman when Union Jack appeared, attacked both Pierce and Union Jack with a gun and escaped into the snow. As he fled he assumed his true form, which Union Jack managed to recognize.

Eventually, Jacob Shaw fled to [[Pennsylvania]], in the [[United States]], where his son Sebastian was born. In his old age, Jacob contracted an incurable blood disease due the alteration of his genetic code. He died just when Sebastian had obtained a scolarship to study engineering.
