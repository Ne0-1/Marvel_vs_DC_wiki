'''Bloodhawk''' ('''Lemuel''') is a [[fictional character]] owned by [[Marvel Comics]], who was featured in ''[[X-Men 2099]]'', one of the tites of Marvel's [[Marvel 2099]] [[imprint]]. He sees himself as the lone protector of the desert he resides in, attacking all those he perceives as threats.

==Fictional character biography==
'''Lemuel''' had been captured by the powerful Synge Casino. The X-Men then dispatch [[Krystalin]] and [[Meanstreak (comics)|Meanstreak]] to free him and invite him to join the team. Bloodhawk refuses the offer and chooses to work alone, but on occasion joined the X-Men in several battles.

Bloodhawk helps the X-Men fight the Synge Casino and their henchman [[Junkpile]], but refuses [[Xi'an (comics)|Xi'an's]] offer to join the X-Men. Later on, Bloodhawk is captured by [[La Lunatica]] and the [[Theatre of Pain (comics)|Theatre of Pain]], who intendeds to torture Bloodhawk and sell the sensations. During this it is revealed Bloodhawk's family had died by the time he was fourteen and he had lived on his own. His powers manifest while being tortured by a masked group of men, who also had been torturing a wolf nearby. His newfound powers allow him to escape these bonds but it takes the assistance of the X-Men of 2099 (Meanstreak, Krystalin, and [[Skullfire]]) to escape his current predicament. Skullfire's power manifestations rescue Bloodhawk this time.

Shortly after, Bloodhawk accompanied the three X-Men to [[New York]], where Meanstreak was looking for an old associate of his: [[Halloween Jack (comics)|Jordan Boone]]. Bloodhawk does not enjoy the city at all, it is too built up. The team confronts '''Alchemax''' security, which were on the lookout for Boone and Meanstreak. Alchemax is a powerful corporation is essentially a law unto themselves. When they find Boone, Bloodhawk and the X-Men learn that he had been transformed into [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] by Alchemax. During this time Bloodhawk joins alongside other heroes of 2099 ([[Spider-Man 2099|SpiderMan]], [[Doom 2099|Doom]], [[Ravage 2099|Ravage]], and the [[Punisher 2099|Punisher]]) to fight the new Asgard (known as the ''Fall of the Hammer'' crossover).

After traveling back to the desert, Bloodhawk parts ways with the X-Men and eventually went to the [[Savage Land]] to protect the creatures from Alchemax. There he meets Doom again, but did not recognize him because he had lost his armor. Bloodhawk destroys Alchemax's equipment in the Savage Land and goes home.

When Bloodhawk returns to the desert he discovers large footprints in the sand. They were created by the "Monstrobot", a giant robot created as a weapon by a scientist named Dr. Ryuteki. His daughter, Jade Ryuteki, helps Bloodhawk shut down the Monstrobot with her knowledge of the machine.

Not soon after Bloodhawk saved the desert from the Monstrobot, he happened by chance to run into Meanstreak and Krystalin, who were on their way to help the other X-Men fight the Theatre of Pain. Remembering the torture that the Theatre did to him in the past, he assisted the X-Men once again in fighting the Theatre of Pain, but again did not accept the offer to join them.

The X-Men were next given the option to be the police force for a new city/state, Halo City, where everyone was treated equal, human or mutant. When former X-Man Edward van Beethoven ([[Metalhead (comics)|Metalhead]]) and his girlfriend (Rosa Vasquez) were attacked on their way to Halo City, Bloodhawk intervened, though with Metalhead's invulnerability it wasn't really needed. Bloodhawk guards the couple and Rosa's infant son on the way to Halo City, and stays there for a time. However, the [[polar ice cap| polar ice caps]] were being melted by the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]] and Halo City started to flood. It's at this time that Rosa's son was kidnapped by Vulcan the Bloodsmith and turned into an adult. Bloodhawk once again lent his assistance to the X-Men to stop Vulcan and rescue Rosa's son, but could not stop the flooding of the city. 

===Savage Land===

After that, he travels with the X-Men to the only inhabitable place left on Earth: the Savage Land, where a large city already exists.

Bloodhawk, along with [[Nostromo (comics)|Nostromo]], [[Willow (comics)|Willow]], [[La Lunatica]], Jade Ryuteki, Mr. Hodge and a scientist named Mr. Winn form part of an exploration team into the jungles. They find an alien spacecraft and the team must deal with it changing Willow into a strange, new form. Willow is calmed but Nostromo changes into a [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]] form, along with the traitorous Winn. [[Doom 2099|President Doom]]'s operatives arrive to bring the boy to Doom. Mr. Winn turns out to be Phalanx and slays all of Doom's men. The heroes end up the last people standing as Winn teleports away with Nostromo. 

They escape back to the 'Last Refuge'. On the outskirts of the city, the expedition is confronted with another Phalanx warrior, threatening to assimilate them all.

==Powers and abilities==
Bloodhawk possesses mutant powers that allow him to transmorph into his recognizable red form with [[bat]]-like wings. In this state, Bloodhawk gains several powers: regeneration, heightened senses, flight, razor-sharp claws and teeth and is impervious to radiation.
