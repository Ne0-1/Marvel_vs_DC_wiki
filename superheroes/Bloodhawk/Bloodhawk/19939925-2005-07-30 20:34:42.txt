'''Bloodhawk''', whose real name is Lemuel Krug, is a fictional character from the [[Marvel 2099]] universe. He possesses mutant powers that allow him to transmorph into his recognizable red form with hawk-like wings. In this state, Bloodhawk gains several powers: such as regeneration, heightened senses, flight, and razor-sharp claws. He sees himself as a lone defender of the desert from whoever may threaten it.

Bloodhawk made his first appearance in the first issue of X-Men 2099 where he has been captured by the Synge Casino. The X-Men then dispatch Krystalin and Meanstreak to free him and invite him to join the team. Bloodhawk refuses the offer and chooses to work alone.
