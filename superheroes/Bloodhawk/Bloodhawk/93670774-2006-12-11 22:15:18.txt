'''Bloodhawk (Lemuel)''' is a fictional character from the [[Marvel 2099]] universe. He first appeared in ''[[X-Men 2099]]''.  He sees himself as the lone protector of the desert he resides in, attacking all those he perceives as threats.

==Fictional character biography==
'''Lemuel''' had been captured by the Synge Casino. The X-Men then dispatch [[Krystalin]] and [[Meanstreak (comics)|Meanstreak]] to free him and invite him to join the team. Bloodhawk refuses the offer and chooses to work alone, but on occasion joined the X-Men in several battles.

Bloodhawk helped the X-Men fight the Synge Casino and their henchman [[Junkpile]], but refused [[Xi'an (comics)|Xi'an's]] offer to join the X-Men. Later on, Bloodhawk was captured and tortured by [[La Lunatica]] and the [[Theatre of Pain (comics)|Theatre of Pain]]. With the assistance of the X-Men of 2099 (Meanstreak, Krystalin, and [[Skullfire]]) they were able to free La Lunatica of their control. Shortly after, Bloodhawk accompanied the three X-Men to [[New York]], where Meanstreak was looking for an old associate of his: [[Halloween Jack (comics)|Jordan Boone]]. When they found him, Bloodhawk and the X-Men learned that he had been transformed into [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] by the evil corporation '''Alchemax'''. During this time Bloodhawk joined along side other heroes of 2099 ([[Spider-Man 2099]], [[Doom 2099]], Ravage 2099, and the Punisher 2099) to fight the new Asgard (known as the ''Fall of the Hammer'' crossover).

After traveling back to the desert, Bloodhawk parted ways with the X-Men and eventually went to the [[Savage Land]] to protect the creatures from Alchemax. There he meets Doom 2099 again, but did not recognize him because he had lost his armor. Bloodhawk destroyed Alchemax's equipment in the Savage Land and goes home.

When Bloodhawk returned to the desert he discovers large footprints in the sand. They were created by the "Monstrobot", a giant robot created as a weapon by a scientist named Dr. Ryuteki. His daughter, Jade Ryuteki, helped Bloodhawk shut down the Monstrobot with her knowledge of the machine.

Not soon after Bloodhawk saved the desert from the Monstrobot, he happened by chance to run into Meanstreak and Krystalin, who were on their way to help the other X-Men fight the Theatre of Pain. Remembering the torture that the Theatre did to him in the past, he assisted the X-Men once again in fighting the Theatre of Pain, but again did not accept the offer to join them.

The X-Men were next given the option to be the police force for a new city/state, Halo City, where everyone was treated equal, human or mutant. When former X-Man Edward van Beethoven ([[Metalhead (comics)|Metalhead]]) and his girlfriend (Rosa Vasquez) were attacked on their way to Halo City, Bloodhawk intervened, though with Metalhead's invulnerability it wasn't really needed. Bloodhawk guarded the couple and Rosa's infant son on the way to Halo City, and stayed there for a time. However, the [[polar ice cap| polar ice caps]] were being melted by the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]] and Halo City started to flood. Its at this time that Rosa's son was kidnapped by Vulcan the Bloodsmith and turned into an adult. Bloodhawk once again lent his assistance to the X-Men to stop Vulcan and rescue Rosa's son, but could not stop the flooding of the city. After that, he traveled with the X-Men to the only inhabitable place left on Earth: the Savage Land.

==Powers and abilities==
Bloodhawk possesses mutant powers that allow him to transmorph into his recognizable red form with [[hawk]]-like wings. In this state, Bloodhawk gains several powers: regeneration, heightened senses, flight, razor-sharp claws and teeth and is impervious to radiation.
