'''3-D Man''' ('''Charles & Hal Chandler''') is a fictional [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]]. Although his adventures take place in the 1950s, the character was created by [[Roy Thomas]] in the 1970s in the anthology series ''[[Marvel Premiere]]''. The character was writer Thomas's homage to the [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]] character [[Captain 3-D]]{{Fact|date=February 2009}}, and was intended by Thomas as a commentary on contemporary societal themes using 1950s [[Analogue (literature)|analogue]]s.<ref name="Thomas intro">Thomas, Roy.

==Fictional character biography==
Brothers Chuck and Hal Chandler were born in [[Los Angeles, California]]. As a test pilot for NASA in 1958,<ref name="Thomas intro" /> Chuck was piloting the experimental XF-13 rocket plane when he was captured by [[Skrull]] invaders. They attempted to interrogate him, but Chuck escaped, damaging the Skrulls' warp drive in the process. The Skrull saucer exploded as Chuck flew away, exposing him to strange radiation. He crashed the XF-13 in the Mojave Desert, and when his younger, crippled brother Hal attempted to rescue him, Chuck disappeared, believed to have been killed. Hal, a research scientist, discovered that Chuck's image had been imprinted on the lenses of his glasses, and that Chuck had been transformed into a two-dimensional being. When Hal wore the glasses and concentrated, he triggered a dimensional shift that caused Chuck to materialize into a three-dimensional existence; in his new form Chuck wore a green and red bodysuit, and his normal strength, speed, and stamina had been tripled.  As the costumed 3-D Man, Chuck fought another group of Skrull agents.<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #35</ref> He battled more Skrull infiltrators,<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #36</ref> and then battled the Cold Warrior.<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #37</ref>

On at least one occasion, Hal's mind occupied the body of the 3-D Man,{{Issue|date=May 2009}} and there is evidence that 3-D Man's mind is actually a combination of Hal's and Chuck's, with Chuck's psyche usually dominant.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

At some point after his 1950s adventures Hal Chandler decided to stop functioning as 3-D Man and left his brother floating around in another dimension. Hal married Peggy Clark, and they had two children, Chuck Chandler II and Hal Chandler, Jr. Hal later encountered a down-on-his-luck Bruce Banner and, afraid that the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] might show up, used the glasses to summon 3-D Man once more.  After this encounter, 3-D Man returned into his brother's glasses, determined never to return.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' #251 (Marvel Comics, Sept. 1980).</ref> However, alongside many other costumed heroes, he was summoned briefly by the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]].<ref>''Marvel Super-Hero Contest of the Champions'' #1</ref>

With the aid of the Avengers, Hal and Chuck were separated and managed to reunite with Peggy, an old lady friend.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

===The Initiative and Triathlon===
{{main|Delroy Garrett}}
Events regarding the former [[Avengers (comics)|Avenger]] Triathlon have shown how Chandler's powers were involved with the [[Triune Understanding]]. After undergoing and completing [[Avengers: The Initiative|Initiative]] training at [[Camp Hammond]], disgraced former Olympic athlete Delroy Garrett was imbued with the powers of 3-D Man.<ref>''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' vol. 3, #8 (Marvel Comics, Sept. 1998).</ref> As Triathlon, Garrett plays an important role in Marvel's [[Secret Invasion]].

==Powers and abilities==
The Chandler brothers received their superhuman abilities through exposure to a unknown radiation in the explosion of a [[Skrull]] starship. Hal Chandler could, by concentrating on the image of his brother Chuck imprinted on his glasses, summon a super-powered version of his brother: 3-D Man. Chuck had a telepathic link with Hal, who would lose consciousness and become comatose when the 3-D Man is active; the 3-D Man's consciousness is apparently a synthesis of Chuck and Hal's mind's, with Chuck's usually dominant. 3-D Man, in turn, could only remain in a three-dimensional reality for three hours at a time before Hal would wake up, causing 3-D Man to subsequently disappear and return to his two-dimensional existence. The 3-D Man wore a specially designed NASA flight suit (circa late 1950s), altered in appearance and bonded to his skin.

In the character's concept as one being sharing two consciousnesses, he is similar to characters such as the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]], Captain Marvel (both the [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Fawcett/DC]] and [[Mar-Vell|Marvel]] versions), and [[Miracleman]].

As 3-D Man, Chuck Chandler possessed approximately three times the physical capabilities of a "peak" human male. As his name suggests, 3-D Man is three times as strong, fast, and durable as a prime physical specimen, such as [[Captain America]]. The sensory acuity of each of his five senses is three times more powerful than the peak capabilities of a normal human being.  It is possible that his vision is so enhanced that he can see outside the visible portion of the light spectrum (e.g. [[infrared]]), and that he can hear frequencies that a normal human being could not. 

In addition, 3-D Man had the limited quasi-telepathic ability to perceive the distinctive aura of the [[Skrull]] race, even when a Skrull has assumed another form.

Chuck was an expert pilot and a talented football player.  Hal is an experienced scientific researcher. Hal is astigmatic, and requires special glasses; a poliomyelitis victim as a child, he now requires crutches to walk.

==Other versions==
===What if...?===
In [[What If (comics)|''What If'']] vol. 1, #9, FBI agent [[Jimmy Woo]] brought the 3-D Man together with several other heroes, including [[Gorilla-Man#Gorilla-Man (Ken Hale)|Gorilla-Man]], [[M-11 (comics)|Human Robot]], [[Marvel Boy (Robert Grayson)|Marvel Boy]], and [[Venus (Marvel Comics)|Venus]], to form the [[Avengers (comics)#1950s Avengers|1950s Avengers]]. These heroes battled the [[Yellow Claw]] and his superhuman minions, but the team was asked to disband by President Dwight D. Eisenhower.<ref>''What If'' Vol. 1 #9</ref> While the events of ''[[Avengers Forever]]'' have erased that adventure,<ref>''Avengers Forever'' #4</ref> a similar mission involving those characters (minus 3-D Man) did take place in the 1950s, as shown in the 2006 miniseries ''[[Agents of Atlas]]''.{{Issue|date=May 2009}} Writer [[Jeff Parker (comics)|Jeff Parker]] has explained that he didn't use 3-D Man in ''Agents of Atlas'', in part due to his being a 1970s retcon, not an original [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]] character.<ref>[http://www.brokenfrontier.com/lowdown/details.php?id=432 Jeff Parker interview at BrokenFrontier.com.]</ref>
