'''3-D Man''' is the name of two fictional [[superhero]]es appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The first superhero to use the name 3-D Man is a composite of two brothers, Charles & Hal Chandler, and the second is [[Delroy Garrett]]. The first 3-D Man appeared in ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #35, created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Jim Craig (comics)|Jim Craig]].

==Publication history==
The character was writer [[Roy Thomas]]' homage to the [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]] character [[Captain 3-D]], and was intended by Thomas as a commentary on contemporary societal themes using 1950s [[Analogue (literature)|analogue]]s.<ref name="Thomas intro">Thomas, Roy. "Three Dimensions in Four Colors," "First Class Mail," ''Marvel Premiere Featuring 3-D Man'' #36 (Marvel Comics, June 1977).</ref> According to the character's artist co-creator Jim Craig, Thomas had initially told him 3-D Man was going to debut in his own magazine-format series in actual [[stereoscopic 3D]], but after further researching the cost informed him that the budget would not cover it.<ref name="back71">{{cite journal |last=Brennaman|first=Chris |title=Marvel Premiere|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=71|pages=26-27|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]] |date=April 2014|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> The character instead debuted in a three-issue run of the anthology series ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'', issues #35-37. These comics, the first issue in particular, have a number of graphical elements clearly intended for their originally planned 3-D presentation.<ref name="back71"/> Because 3-D Man's adventures take place in the 1950s, Craig had to spend extensive time at a library doing research for the story's setting.<ref name="back71"/>

The character also appeared in ''Incredible Hulk'' #251–252, ''[[Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions|Contest of Champions]]'' #1, and ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'' #9. 3-D Man did not appear again for many years, until he was reintroduced in ''[[Avengers Forever]]'' #4 and appeared in ''Avengers'' #50–55 and the 2008 ''Secret Invasion: Skrulls'' one-shot.

Brothers Chuck and Hal Chandler were born in [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]]. As a test pilot for [[NASA]] in 1958,<ref name="Thomas intro" /> Chuck was piloting the experimental XF-13 rocket plane when he was captured by [[Skrull]] invaders. They attempted to interrogate him, but Chuck escaped, damaging the Skrulls' warp drive in the process. The Skrull saucer exploded as Chuck flew away, exposing him to strange radiation. He crashed the XF-13 in the Mojave Desert, and when his younger, crippled brother Hal attempted to rescue him, Chuck disappeared, believed to have been killed. Hal, a research scientist, discovered that Chuck's image had been imprinted on the lenses of his glasses, and that Chuck had been transformed into a two-dimensional being. When Hal wore the glasses and concentrated, he triggered a dimensional shift that caused Chuck to materialize into a three-dimensional existence. In his new form Chuck wore a green and red bodysuit, and his normal strength, speed, and durability had been tripled. As the costumed 3-D Man, Chuck fought another group of Skrull agents.<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #35</ref> He battled more Skrull infiltrators,<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #36</ref> and then battled the Cold Warrior.<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #37</ref>

At some point after his 1950s adventures Hal Chandler decided to stop functioning as 3-D Man and left his brother floating around in another dimension. Hal married Peggy Clark, and they had two children, Chuck Chandler II and Hal Chandler, Jr. Hal later encountered a down-on-his-luck Bruce Banner and, afraid that the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] might show up, used the glasses to summon 3-D Man once more. After this encounter, 3-D Man returned into his brother's glasses, determined never to return.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' #251 (Marvel Comics, Sept. 1980).</ref> However, alongside many other costumed heroes, he was summoned briefly by the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]].<ref>''Marvel Super-Hero Contest of the Champions'' #1</ref>

===Triathlon and The Initiative===
{{Main|Delroy Garrett}}
Events involving the former [[Avengers (comics)|Avenger]] Triathlon have revealed the true origins of 3-D Man's powers—one of a trio of pyramid-shaped "fragments of light", apparently created by the universe itself to counterbalance the emergence of an otherdimensional fragment of pure evil into Earth's dimension. The Skrull ship that had captured Chuck Chandler had also found one of the light pyramids, and the ship's explosion infused Chuck with the pyramid's power.<ref name="AV50">''Avengers'' vol. 3 #50, March 2002</ref>

The Chandler brothers' powers were stolen by Jonathan Tremont, founder of the [[Triune Understanding]], who used Hal's connection to what Tremont termed the "tri-power" to track down a second light pyramid before attacking and capturing Hal.<ref name="AV50"/> Tremont and the Understanding then drained the tri-power from a captive Hal and empowered Triune member and disgraced former Olympic athlete Delroy Garrett, dubbing him "Triathlon".<ref>''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' vol. 3, #8 (Marvel Comics, Sept. 1998)</ref> Though initially unaware of his powers' source, Triathlon later discovered both the truth and the third light pyramid, and during the events of the [[Kang Dynasty|Kang War]], used the combined might of all three "tri-powers" to defeat both Tremont and the otherdimensional evil, release Hal and Chuck from captivity, and restore Chuck to a separate human form, with Garret retaining the powers of 3-D Man.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3 #55, August 2002</ref>

After Garrett underwent and completed [[Fifty State Initiative|Initiative]] training at [[Camp Hammond (comics)|Camp Hammond]], he officially took on the identity of 3-D Man with the Chandlers' blessing, including Chuck passing on his original costume and goggles. Donning the goggles awakened one of the original 3-D Man's powers in Garrett: the ability to perceive Skrulls in their true form, even when in shapeshifting disguise.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #14, August 2008</ref> With these goggles, Garrett played an important role in Marvel's [[Secret Invasion]], outing several Skrull infiltrators placed within the Initiative. Garrett managed to maintain this new ability even after the goggles were destroyed in combat.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #14–19, August 2008 – December 2009</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Chandler brothers received their superhuman abilities through exposure to an unknown radiation in the explosion of a [[Skrull]] starship. Hal Chandler could, by concentrating on the image of his brother Chuck imprinted on his glasses, summon a super-powered version of his brother: 3-D Man. Chuck had a telepathic link with Hal, who would lose consciousness and become comatose when the 3-D Man is active. The 3-D Man's consciousness is apparently a synthesis of Chuck and Hal's minds, with Chuck's usually dominant. 3-D Man, in turn, could only remain in a three-dimensional reality for three hours at a time before Hal would wake up, causing 3-D Man to subsequently disappear and return to his two-dimensional existence. The 3-D Man wore a specially designed NASA flight suit (circa late 1950s), altered in appearance and bonded to his skin.

As 3-D Man, Chuck Chandler possessed approximately three times the physical capabilities of an extremely physically fit but otherwise normal human male. As his name suggests, 3-D Man is three times as strong, fast, and durable as military pilot Chuck Chandler. The sensory acuity of each of his five senses is three times more powerful than the maximum capabilities of a normal human being.

In addition, 3-D Man had the limited quasi-telepathic ability to perceive the distinctive aura of the [[Skrull]] race, even when a Skrull has assumed another form.

Chuck was an expert pilot and a talented football player. Hal is an experienced scientific researcher. Hal is astigmatic, and requires special glasses. A [[poliomyelitis]] victim as a child, he now requires crutches to walk.

==Other versions==
===What if...?===
In [[What If (comics)|''What If'']] vol. 1, #9, FBI agent [[Jimmy Woo]] brought the 3-D Man together with several other heroes, including [[Gorilla-Man#Gorilla-Man (Ken Hale)|Gorilla-Man]], [[M-11 (comics)|Human Robot]], [[Marvel Boy (Robert Grayson)|Marvel Boy]], and [[Venus (Marvel Comics)|Venus]], to form the [[Avengers (comics)#1950s Avengers|1950s Avengers]]. These heroes battled the [[Yellow Claw (comics)|Yellow Claw]] and his superhuman minions, but the team was asked to disband by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]].<ref>''What If'' Vol. 1 #9</ref> While the events of ''[[Avengers Forever]]'' have erased that adventure,<ref>''Avengers Forever'' #4</ref> a similar mission involving those characters (minus 3-D Man) did take place in the 1950s, as shown in the 2006 miniseries ''[[Agents of Atlas]]''.<ref>''Agents of Atlas'' #1–6 (Oct. 2006 – March 2007)</ref> Writer [[Jeff Parker (comics)|Jeff Parker]] has explained that he didn't use 3-D Man in ''Agents of Atlas'', in part due to his being a 1970s retcon, not an original [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]] character.<ref>[http://www.brokenfrontier.com/lowdown/details.php?id=432 Jeff Parker interview at BrokenFrontier.com.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221110526/http://www.brokenfrontier.com/lowdown/details.php?id=432 |date=December 21, 2008 }}</ref>
