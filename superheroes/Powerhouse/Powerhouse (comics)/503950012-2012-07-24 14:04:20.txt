Powerhouse is a member of Xandarian alien race, with superhuman strength and the ability to absorb energy from any source to temporarily enhance his physical strength fiftyfold, absorb the energy from a weapon used against him and redirect it against an assailant, and even create a psionic link with an opponent with whom he is in physical contact so as to control his opponent's use of his or her own powers.

Davan was a member of the Syfon division of the [[Nova Corps]], Xandar's superhuman military.  He was sent into space to perform surveillance on the starship of [[Zorr]], the interstellar warlord who went on to shatter Xandar.  Before Davan could report on Zorr's activities, his ship was hit by a meteor shower and careened off-course, eventually crossing the space of galaxies and landing in a body of water on Earth.  Davan's ship was found by the [[Avian (Marvel Comics)|Avian]] criminal [[Condor (comics)|Condor]], who brainwashed Davan into serving him.{{Issue|date=May 2010}}  Eventually Davan regained his memory and returned to Xandar, serving in the [[Champions of Xandar]].{{Issue|date=May 2010}}

Her first appearance was in ''Spider-Man '' #15 (1991).

At some point, under uncertain circumstances, Powerhouse developed mutant powers and a strong hatred for humanity.

[[Beast (comics)|Beast]] was giving a lecture at ESU on genetics and Powerhouse decided to show up and send her anti-human message there. Simultaneously, a mutant hater called Masterblaster decided to make his presence and opinions felt at the same lecture. Though it is unclear whether one of them influenced the other's actions at the lecture, Masterblaster came to attack Beast, and Powerhouse attacked humans there and the Beast came to their aid and fought Powerhouse. They fought back and forth, with Powerhouse having the upper hand until [[Spider-Man]] showed up. While Spider-Man kept Powerhouse busy, Beast knocked out Masterblaster and the two proceeded to team up on Powerhouse, and defeated her, knocking her out. She was presumably taken into police custody.{{Issue|date=May 2010}}

[[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] and [[Warbird (comics)|Warbird]] saw a news report of Powerhouse attacking the area around the U.N. building, where an international debate on human-mutant relations was to happen. She was attacking everything in sight as a symbol of the way humans' attitude towards mutants was. Before long, Wolverine and Warbird joined the fight, and Wolverine was flown into the air and landed on top of Powerhouse so they could fight. However, Powerhouse started draining Wolverine's energy and Warbird was doing more harm than good because she was drunk and being very reckless with her energy blasts. Eventually, Powerhouse knocked out Warbird. Without the drunk Warbird to get in his way, Wolverine managed to defeat Powerhouse.{{Issue|date=May 2010}}

Powerhouse joined with Masterblaster in robbing a local bank, but were interrupted by Spider-Man, who defeated the duo. One of the men present at the bank at the time of the hold-up became infatuated with Powerhouse, and subsequently visited her in prison, which he intended to continue to do every two weeks for the next seven years, as she served her sentence.{{Issue|date=May 2010}}

Powerhouse may have lost her mutant powers after the [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].

===Powers and abilities===
Powerhouse has the ability to drain energy of other living things to increase her own power. She can absorb energy through contact with a victim, even brief contact like a punch. She has demonstrated the ability to fly, shoot destructive energy blasts, and superhuman strength to an unknown degree. However, it is unknown if she has any of these powers unless she has absorbed sufficient amounts of energy or whether they are independent within her. It is also unknown if she requires this energy to survive and if so, how often she needs to feed.

== Powerhouse (Alex Power) ==
First appeared in ''[[Power Pack]]'' (vol.1) #1, he is a child (twelve years old at the beginning of the first ''Power Pack'' series) with superhuman abilities gained (along with his brother [[Jack Power|Jack]] and his two sisters, [[Julie Power|Julie]] and [[Katie Power|Katie]]) from a dying [[Kymellian]].

Originally known as ''Gee'' and possessing the ability to manipulate gravity, he was the unofficial leader of Power Pack (being the oldest Power sibling), and later a member of the  [[New Warriors]].  As a Warrior, he claimed the powers of his siblings for his own, and changed his name to a play on the team's name, ''Powerpax'', to reflect this.  Later, feeling guilty over co-opting his siblings' abilities, he tried to distance himself from them by taking the name ''Powerhouse''.  After leaving the Warriors, Alex returned the other powers to his siblings and rejoined Power Pack, taking the new name of ''Zero-G''.
