'''Chronos''' is a [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]] who takes his name from the [[Chronos|Greek personification of Time]] and has the ability to [[time travel]] and manipulate history.

==History==
Considered by some to be the arch-[[nemesis]] of the [[Atom (comics)|Atom]] (Ray Palmer), Chronos started his career as petty thief '''David Clinton''' who attributed his consistent incarceration to his timing, or lack there of. To improve his timing he studied the [[rhythm]] of [[time]] pieces and by practise he learnt to [[synchronise]] each of his actions with the beat of the prison clock. By the end of his sentence he had developed an extraordinary sense of timing which he resolved to use to further his [[criminal]] career. He then adopted the colourful costume and alter ego of Chronos, the Time Thief. Clinton had acquired an unhealthy fascination with time and he developed a series of [[gimmick]] [[weapons]] and [[deathtrap]]s based on time pieces (clocks with blades as hands, flying sun dials).

Chronos made his debut in Ivy Town, but was defeated by the Atom. He next tried to steal a collection of historic [[Hungary|Hungarian]] clocks, but was again defeated. The Atom has since thwarted all of Chronos plans. Each appearance or new crime prompted an evolution in Chronos's weaponry. His study of time led to more intricate and revolutionary inventions -- [[lenses]] that prevent people from seeing certain events (e.g. his getaway vehicle or another specific object), circuitry embedded in his costume that could control the local flow of time (freezing people in time or altering his own perception of time), and ultimately a fully functional [[time machine]] (before it and the designs were destroyed). One story suggested that Chronos may have been receiving help from a [[future]] version of himself, but it is unknown at what relative time frame that Chronos came from.

Chronos eventually stopped stealing for his own gain and began stealing to finance his time [[research]]. The Atom had always thwarted Chronos, but he had decided to turn his back on [[humanity]] and had retreated to a [[peace]]ful seclusion with a group a six-inch tall [[aliens]] in the [[Amazon]]ian [[jungle]]. Chronos had more success without the Atom, but he brought himself to the attention of the [[Blue Beetle]] (Ted Kord) when he tried to blackmail one of the [[employee]]s of Kord Inc. He also fought the Beetle during [[Darkseid]]'s anti-hero riots. During one struggle against the Beetle, Chronos was hurled 100 million years into the past where he encountered a time-lost [[Captain Atom]].

Upon his return to the present Chronos was able to use his [[technology]] to manipulate the money markets to amass a fortune, but old habits die hard, and Chronos's illegal [[endeavour]]s were discovered and he was returned to prison. He was freed by the [[Calendar Man]] to work with the [[Time Foes]], but was captured by the [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]]. Out of desperation and humiliation, Chronos took a drastic chance -- he accepted an offer from the demon [[Neron]] and exchanged his [[soul]] for the metahuman ability to travel through time. However [[bargain]]s with Neron are never fair and Chronos found that each journey through the [[timestream]] accelerated his ageing. A man who should have been a [[healthy]] adult became an aged senior [[citizen]].  Clinton's efforts to bypass this flaw - passing his artificial age onto youths and intercepting other time travellers in an attempt to acquire their technology - brought him briefly into conflict with the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]], in a somewhat confusing and often non-linear sequence of events.  

All the [[experiment]]s and Neron's "gift" had taken a toll on Clinton's body and be began to loose touch with any sense of the "now." He had trouble staying localised in time and appeared to fade away into nothingness. His disappearance was enough for him to be declared dead and speculation has suggested that he may have slipped into "The Void" of time. A funeral of sorts was held and his research was passed on to the second Chronos (Walker Gabriel).

Time travel being what it is, David Clinton's legal death has not meant the end of his presence in the DC universe; he has made several appearances since, such as during the [[Identity Crisis (comics)|Identity Crisis]], when he claimed to have travelled forward from a point in time shortly before his final disappearance.  This [[foreknowledge]] of his own (suspected) demise led to a somewhat subdued, even morose, demeanor.

==Other Media==
A version of the character has appeared in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' [[animated series]], in the two-part episode "The Once and Future Thing", voiced by [[Peter MacNicol]]. In this incarnation, David Clinton is a man from the future (or rather, from the time of [[Batman Beyond]]). He was a small, meek physics professor/scientist whose peers shunned him for his claims of being able to construct a time-traveling device, but he eventually did so. Being aware of the problems of time paradoxes, he tried not to use his device to do anything that would adversely affect the timestream, and began making a collection of items lifted out of the past at the points when they would no longer be missed. However, his wife Enid began to harangue him incessantly about a myriad of things, and he eventually escaped into time to get away from her. After failing to try and steal Batman's utility belt, he attracted the attention of [[Batman]], [[Wonder Woman]], and [[John Stewart (comics)|Green Lantern]], accidentally pulling them into the Old West (they arrive six months after Clinton). Clinton's time belt was stolen by a local villain named Tobias Manning, and he gets thrown into a jail cell for those six months. Once the League shows up, Clinton persuaded them to help him get the time belt back.

Once they did, though, Clinton went back into the future. He decided to throw caution to the wind and do whatever he wanted with time travel, making himself, in his own words, "the undisputed master of space and time", and adopts the name Lord Chronos. He did this all to impress Enid, who still never respected him and merely acted nice to him out of fear. The three Leaguers followed him to the Beyond timeline, now bizarrely altered (with the Titanic and the Leaning Tower of Pisa alongside Gotham's architecture, amongst other things), only to find that Clinton's actions have started making time collapse and people disappear (like Wonder Woman). Batman, GL, and the last remaining roster of the JLU ([[Warhawk (Justice League Unlimited)|Warhawk]], [[Static (superhero)|Static]], and the Batmen: old Bruce Wayne and new Terry McGinnis) get Enid to tell them where Clinton is - in the jail from the Old West that Clinton brought to the future, where he sleeps every night. (Presumably, this is because his six months in the jail cell were a vacation away from his nagging wife, and thusly worlds more comfortable to him.) As time starts dying around them, Batman and GL follow Clinton into another time wormhole, where Clinton seems to be heading for the beginning of time itself. The heroes catch up with him, though, and Batman inserts a disc into the belt that reverses everything that happened. Clinton is caught in a time loop based around his wife yelling at him and him starting up the belt to get away from her, which we can only assume will repeat until the end of time.
