:''For other uses of the term "Fury", see [[Fury]].''

'''Fury''' is the name of two [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]]ines.

==Original Fury history==
The first Fury was '''Hippolyta "Lyta" Trevor''', the daughter of the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] [[Wonder Woman]] and [[Steve Trevor]]; as a result of this lineage, Lyta had all her mother's powers. She was introduced in ''Wonder Woman'' (volume 1) #200. Like all Golden Age related characters at the time, Lyta was stated to live on the parallel world of "[[Earth-Two]]."

Lyta later adopted the identity of the Fury, named after the [[Furies]] of [[mythology]], and was one of the founding members of [[Infinity Inc.]], in the book of the same name written by [[Roy Thomas]]. She also began a relationship with her teammate Hector Hall, the [[Silver Scarab]], which led to their engagement. Shortly after their decision to marry, Hector was possessed by an enemy of his father, [[Hawkman]], and killed.

==Modern Fury history==
Following the [[1985]] miniseries ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', the Golden Age Wonder Woman retroactively no longer existed. Lyta was now the daughter of '''Helena Kosmatos''', the Golden Age Fury (a Greek superheroine and member of the [[All-Star Squadron]]) and had been raised by Joan Trevor (nee Dale), the [[Quality Comics]] superheroine [[Miss America (DC Comics)|Miss America]] and her husband, Derek. Apart from this her history was relatively unchanged.

Helena (a new character created to replace the Golden Age Wonder Woman as Lyta's biological mother) began appearing in Thomas' ''[[Young All-Stars]]'', a book set in [[World War II]], and her backstory was revealed in an issue of ''[[Secret Origins]]''. She was a Greek national who had learned her brother was co-operating with Italian [[Fascism|Fascists]]. [[Tisiphone]], one of the [[Eumenides]] or Furies, gave her a suit of magic [[armor]], which increased her strength, speed and stamina. When angered, she became an [[avatar]] of Tisiphone, and in this state she killed her brother. This made her a highly unpredictable heroine. She was later briefly released from this [[possession]], and retained the other powers, but as seen in [[Infinite Crisis]] #2, she is once again acting as Tisiphone's avatar.

At one point the [[Amazon]] [[Queen Hippolyta (comics)|Queen Hippolyta]] took over the role of [[Wonder Woman]] and traveled back in time to aid the [[Justice Society of America|JSA]] against the nazis. During this time Helena began to look to Hippolyta as a mother figure and began a strange fixation that she was indeed the daughter of the Amazon Queen, dispite the knowledge that her true parents were killed in the war. When Queen Hippolyta returned to her own time Helena's fixation began to get more and more bizzare. She sought out a magical means to gain eternal youth in order to be with Queen Hippolyta in the future. After this was done she met Hippolyta's true daughter Diana and took an immidiate disliking to her. By this point Helena's mental state was near collapse as she began to act on irrational thoughts. Not wanting her to be on her own in the world, Diana took her to [[Themyscira]] to be placed in Queen Hippolyta's care. Helena liked this arrangement very much and stayed on the island as an honorary Amazon. And though they are not physically related, Hippolyta began to refer to Helena as a daughter in order to help her sort out her fragile psyche. After Hippolyta's death during the Our Worlds At War saga, Helena went into mourning and much of her mental imbalance went away. Still a resident of Themyscira, she serves the island's present rulers [[Artemis of Bana-Mighdall|Artemis]] and Phillipus as a trusted aid.

Meanwhile, in the [[1980]]s, Lyta Trevor had learned she was pregnant with Hector's child, and was being visited by a mysterious costumed figure at night. This turned out to be Hector, who, after his death, had been chosen as the Guardian of Dreams, [[The Sandman (DC Comics Silver Age)|the Sandman]]. Hector and Lyta got married and she joined him in the Dream Dimension, together with his sidekicks Brute and Glob.

In [[Neil Gaiman]]'s ''[[The Sandman (DC Comics Modern Age)|The Sandman]]'', it was revealed that the Dream Dimension was a pocket of [[Dreaming (comics)|the Dreaming]] that Brute and Glob had shut off during [[Dream (DC Comics)|Morpheus]]' imprisonment, intending to create their own King of Dreams. Upon Morpheus' return, Hector's soul was released and Lyta was sent back to Earth, where she gave birth to their son, [[Daniel (DC Comics)|Daniel]]. Morpheus visited the child, and informed Lyta that he was destined to be in the Dreaming. When Daniel later mysteriously disappeared, Lyta lost her mind and sought to destroy Morpheus, aided by the mythical [[Erinyes|Furies]]. Ironically, it was this that began the chain of events which lead to Daniel becoming the new Lord of the Dreaming.

Lyta's story continued in the graphic novel ''Sandman Presents: The Furies''. Following this she appeared in ''[[Justice Society of America|JSA]]'', she was reunited with Hector, now reincarnated as [[Doctor Fate]]. Evidently at some point between the graphic novel and her return in JSA, the evil wizard [[Mordru]] had captured Lyta and imprisoned her in Dr. Fate's amulet. Once freed, she rejoined her husband and later regained her true memories about their son Daniel.

Recently, [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] has been destorying magic throughout the DC Universe. He banished Dr. Fate and Lyta to a freezing mountain, later identified as part of hell. In JSA #80, Lyta recalls being visited by her son Daniel in a dream, where he offers to bring Lyta and Hector to The Dreaming for all eternity, but they can never return to Earth. Seeing that Hector is unconscious and near-dying, Lyta takes Daniel up on his offer. Daniel appears through a mystic doorway, and Lyta carries the unconscious Hector through it.  In the next panel we see the bodies of both Lyta and Hector, unconscious in the snow, presumably dead, signifying that their spirits are now in the Dreaming.

==Other media==
A character loosely based on the Fury appears as a villainess named Aresia in the [[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]] [[animation|animated]] series.
