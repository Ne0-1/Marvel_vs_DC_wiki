'''Fury''' is the name of two [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]]ines with a rather convoluted history.

{{msg:spoilers}}

The first Fury was '''Hippolyta "Lyta" Trevor''', the daughter of the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] [[Wonder Woman]] and Steve Trevor, who had all her mother's powers. She was introduced in ''Wonder Woman'' (volume 1) #200. Like all Golden Age related characters, she was stated to live on "Earth-2". 

She later adopted the identity of the Fury, named after the [[Furies]] of [[mythology]] and was one of the founding members of [[Infinity Inc.]], in the book of the same name, written by [[Roy Thomas]]. She also began a relationship with her team-mate, Hector Hall, the [[Silver Scarab]] and they got engaged. However, shortly after that he was possessed by an enemy of his father, [[Hawkman]], and killed.

Following the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]], the Golden Age Wonder Woman no longer existed. Lyta was now the daughter of '''Helena Kosmatos, the Golden Age Fury''', a Greek superheroine, and member of the [[All-Star Squadron]], and had been raised by Joan Trevor (nee Dale), the [[Quality Comics]] superheroine [[Miss America (comics)|Miss America]] and her husband, Derek. Apart from this her history was relatively unchanged.

Helena (an entirely new character) began appearing in Thomas' ''[[Young All-Stars]]'', a book set in [[World War II]], and her backstory was revealed in an issue of ''[[Secret Origins]]''. She was a Greek national who had learnt her brother was co-operating with Italian [[Fascism|Fascists]]. [[Tisiphone]], one of the [[Eumenides]] or Furies, gave her a suit of magic [[armour]], which increased her strength, speed and stamina. When angered, she became an [[avatar]] of Tisiphone, and in this state she killed her brother. This made her a highly unpredictable heroine. She was later released from this [[possession]], but retained the other powers.

Meanwhile, in the [[1980]]s, Lyta Trevor had learnt she was pregnant with Hector's child, and was being visited by a mysterious costumed figure at night. This turned out to be Hector, who, after his death, had been chosen as the Guardian of Dreams, [[The Sandman (DC Comics Silver Age)|the Sandman]]. Hector and Lyta got married and she joined him in the Dream Dimension, together with his sidekicks Brute and Glob.

In [[Neil Gaiman]]'s ''[[The Sandman (DC Comics Modern Age)|The Sandman]]'', it was revealed that the Dream Dimension was a pocket of [[the Dreaming]] that Brute and Glob had shut off during [[Dream (Sandman)|Morpheus]]' imprisonment, intending to create their own King of Dreams. Upon Morpheus' return, Hector's soul was released and Lyta was sent back to Earth, where she gave birth to their son, [[Daniel (Sandman)|Daniel]]. Morpheus visited the child, and informed Lyta that he was destined to be in the Dreaming. When Daniel later mysteriously disappeared, Lyta lost her mind and sought to destroy Morpheus, aided by the mythical [[Erinyes|Furies]]. Ironically, it was this that began the chain of events which lead to Daniel becoming the new Lord of the Dreaming.

Hippolyta's story continued in the mini-series ''Sandman Presents: The Furies''. Following this she appeared in ''[[Justice Society of America|J.S.A.]]'', where she was reunited with Hector, now reincarnated as [[Doctor Fate]].
