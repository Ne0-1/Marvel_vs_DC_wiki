The '''Fury''' is a [[fictional character]] created by writer [[Alan Moore]] and illustrator [[Alan Davis]] for the [[Marvel Comics]] [[comic book]] ''[[Captain Britain]]''. 

==Character biography==
The Fury is a deadly "cybiote" (presumably an [[android]] or [[cyborg]]) built by the reality-manipulating psychic [[Mad Jim Jaspers]] of the parallel timeline of Earth-238 in order to destroy all [[superhuman]]s but himself.  It is physically powerful, capable of generating lethal energy blasts and of adapting and regenerating its mechanical body.  Like most of Jim Jaspers' other homicidal agents, the Fury was named for a minor character in ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'':

:''Fury said to a mouse, That he met in the house, "Let us both go to law: I will prosecute you.  &mdash;Come, I'll take no denial; We must have a trial: For really this morning I've nothing to do."  Said the mouse to the cur, "Such a trial, dear Sir, With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath."  "I'll be judge, I'll be jury," said cunning old Fury: "I'll try the whole cause, and condemn you to death."''

The Fury slew all of Earth-238's [[superhero]]es, with the exception of [[Captain UK]], who fled to another world at the moment that the Fury killed her husband Rick.  Most of the Fury's victims on Earth-238 were based on [[Britain|British]] comic book characters from the 1950s-1970s.  After succeeding in its mission, the Fury was deactivated until Captain Britain and his elflike sidekick [[Jackdaw (comics)|Jackdaw]] were sent to Earth-238 by the Captain's mythic mentor [[Merlyn (Marvel Comics)|Merlyn]].  Jaspers had his agents, the Status Crew, reactivate the Fury and send it to kill the hero.  The Fury murdered Jackdaw, and then killed Captain Britain himself.

The Captain was retrieved by Merlyn and revived in the alien magician's home dimension, Otherworld.  The Fury detected that its prey again lived, and began to adapt itself to interdimensional travel in order to hunt him down.  Meanwhile, the temporal overseer Mandragon destroyed Earth-238 in order to kill Jaspers; the Fury only barely escaped to Captain Britain's native world, [[Earth-616]].  There, the Fury killed several more of Captain Britain's allies, finally confronting Earth-616's counterpart of Mad Jim Jaspers, who was beginning to organize a program against his own world's superhumans.  The Fury determined that this Jaspers was not its creator and therefore was not exempt from its directive to kill superhumans.  The two fought, but the Fury won when it transported the pair to the empty void that had been Earth-238.  Jaspers was unable to use his powers of reality manipulation in a universe where reality had been destroyed, and the Fury swiftly lobotomized him.  The weakened Fury returned to Earth-616, where it was ambushed and torn apart by Captain UK, sustaining more damage in the process than it could regenerate.

The Fury reappeared years later in several issues of ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' (Issues #444-447) that were written by Captain Britain co-creator [[Chris Claremont]] and illustrated by Fury co-creator Alan Davis.  The Fury, having regenerated (but not up to its previous power levels due to the severity of the damage inflicted by Captain UK), destroyed Captain Britain's home and beat the visiting [[X-Men]] unconscious.  It took control of [[Sage (comics)|Sage]], an X-Men member, who possessed a "computer brain", and had her attack her teammates, but its control over her was severed by an electrical field created by [[Storm (comics)|Storm]].  The Fury was again destroyed when [[Rachel Summers]] created an artificial [[black hole]] inside its body, collapsing it into a singularity.

In ''Uncanny X-Men'' #462, James Jaspers was seemlingly resurrected in Otherworld and appeared to have merged with the Fury, probably because the Fury was accidentally sucked into a dimension in which some aspect of Jaspers had remained since his apparent death at the Fury's hand. After all, it was said that even destroying the entire universe wouldn't fully kill Jaspers, which might imply that some metaphysical aspect of him could survive his physical death, so this could explain  Jaspers merging with the Fury.

==Powers and abilities==
The Fury seemed to be harder and harder to defeat every time Captain Britain and the X-Men confronted it. The Fury was described as "the supreme killing machine" and usually defeated its super-powered quarries with energy blasts that it could fire from its left arm. The Fury could also fire poisonous, barbed darts. The Fury carried detailed files on all known super humans, and its sophisticated array of sensors was powerful enough to recognize when it has killed all super humans present in the universe. The Fury possessed limited teleportation abilities, but it should be noted that when it decided to continue its campaign against super human it acquired the ability to cross dimensions. Trans-dimensional travel nearly destroys the Fury, and it usually needs to acquire raw "genetic material" to rebuild itself. The Fury can kill regular humans and use their bodies for this purpose, although killing non-super humans appears to not be a primary function of the Fury. The Fury's dart weapon is tipped with a powerful mutagenic, possibly to ready the body for absorption. The Fury kills a host body with its attached barb and drags the body closer to itself. Sid, a hapless drifter, managed to escape the Fury shortly after it warped to Captain Britainâ€™s dimension, but he was grazed by one of the Fury's darts. The powerful toxin turned him into a grotesque monster that terrorized London until Captain Britain and the British Army killed him. It is unknown how Mad Jim Jaspers acquired the technical proficiency to make a complex construct like the Fury, although it is possible that he used his reality warping powers to give him access to the technology.
