'''The Pride''' debuted in  ''[[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]] #1'', and were created by Brian K. Vaughan and Adrian Alphona. 

They were [[Runaways_%28comics%29|The Runaways]] parents, a group of [[archetypical]] [[supervillains]] who kept their illicit activities secret from their children. 

== Origin ==
The Pride was called together in [[1984]] by the [[Gibborim]]. The six members of the Pride who served them best would be allowed to rule over the paradise that Earth would become once the Gibborim achieved their goal. The remaining six members would perish with the rest of the human race. For 25 years the Gibborim had given The Pride wealth and power over the entire "city of angels".

Every year, the Pride gathered at the Wilder residence, ostensibly for an annual charity fundraiser, while in reality, they would perform the "Rite of Blood," a ritual sacrifice of an innocent victim; the spirit of the victim would then be fed to the Gibborim in the subsequent "Rite of Thunder." After Janet Stein became pregnant, the Pride agreed to end its struggle against one another.  Each couple would instead ensure their child would receive one of the six places in the coming paradise.

== Recent Activities ==
17 years later, the Pride's children see "The Rite of Blood" and run away.  With the help of LAPD Lieutenant Flores, their parents frame their children for the [[murder]] of the innocent girl who served as their most recent sacrifice. A note left at the Deans' house reveals that one of the Runaways is secretly loyal to the Pride. Due to an attack on their children by the [[vampire]] Topher, the Pride tracked down and killed Topher's lackeys.  In the process, the Pride learns that their children have defeated the vampire themselves. A mole tips off the Pride to their children's involvement with [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]].

During a ceremony at the "Rite of Thunder", Alex Wilder manipulates his teammates into defeat and reveals himself as the mole. He learned of the Pride a year ago; he also discovered the Deans' and Hayes' betrayal.  Molly Hayes' and Karolina Dean's parents plotted to betray the rest of the Pride and divide the Gibborim's reward between their two families.  Alex manipulated the Runaways as a way to save his parents and rule paradise with Nico Minoru.  Molly destroys the "Sacrificial Offering", the Gibborim destroy Alex, and the Pride's undersea lair collapses. In issue 17 of [[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]], all members of The Pride are apparently killed by the Gibborim.

At the end of the first arc of the second series, however, a figure who had impersonated [[Chamber (comics)|Chamber]], is implied to be a resurrected Alex Wilder, and has formed a new Pride using some of the original team's tools.

== Members ==

#'''Geoffrey''' and '''Catherine Wilder''', crime bosses who posed as business people. They handled [[drugs]] and [[gambling]] in [[Los Angeles]], and had high-ranking [[judges]] and [[police officers]] on the Pride's payroll. Parents of [[Alex Wilder]].
#'''Dale''' and '''Stacey Yorkes''', [[Time travel|time travelers]] who posed as [[antique]] dealers. The two, using the 4-D porico, traveled back to the 87th century to commission Gertrude's genetically engineered [[deinonychus]] (which Gertrude dubbed ''Old Lace''). They believed the Gibborim would make a better world, one that wasn't full of [[superheroes]]. Parents of [[Gertrude Yorkes]].
#'''Frank''' and '''Leslie Dean''', alien  exiles their race's homeworld "Majesdane" who posed as Hollywood actors and [[New Age]] enthusiasts. Took their last name from [[James Dean]]. The Deans are intergalactic arms traders to the [[Skrull]]s. The Deans originally didn't want to have a child, but conceded when they realized it would be a good [[publicity stunt]]. Their daughter, Karolina, had powers which were inhibited for most of her life thanks to a med alert bracelet forged from a strange metal. Her parents, wishing to give her a "normal" life, lied about her having a deadly allergy and instructed her to never take the bracelet off.  Conspired with the Hayes to dispose of all human members of the Pride in order to ensure immortality for their families. Parents of [[Karolina Dean]].
#'''Victor''' and '''Janet Stein''', [[mad scientists]] who supposedly made a fortune from creating a tool that removes the annoying plastic wrapping easily from a CD. They also made "weaponized" gloves called Fistigons, multi-spectral goggles, the transport ship ''The Leapfrog'', and all-steel weapons for their son, Chase.  Victor was shown to be an abusive father who would hit Chase for "talking back" and getting "straight Cs" in school. Parents of [[Chase Stein]].
#'''Gene''' and '''Alice Hayes''', telepathic [[mutant (fictional)|mutants]] who posed as a doctor and a speech therapist. Conspired with the Deans to get rid of all human members of the Pride in order to ensure immortality for their families. Their identical power signatures and an offhand comment about their "pureblood" marriage led to speculation that their union was actually [[incestuous]]. The two can telepathically remove all memory and [[Sedation|sedate]] people. Parents of [[Molly Hayes]]. 
#'''Robert''' and '''Tina Minoru''', dark wizards who posed as an average, church-going, [[middle-class]] couple. They were first abducted by the Gibborim on their [[wedding]] day. Parents of [[Nico Minoru]].
