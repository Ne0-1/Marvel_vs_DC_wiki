Werner briefly takes over [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] during one of his father's supposed deaths.{{Issue|date=January 2010}} Later Wolfgang returns from the dead via the death spore virus.{{Issue|date=January 2010}} Werner uses his influence to try to gain part of the territory of the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] after he fell from power. The conference that would divide up the Kingpin's territory is set in Las Vegas.<ref>''Daredevil #307</ref>

At first, Werner's forces detain two spies, who were in reality [[Microchip (comics)|Microchip]] and [[Mickey Fondozzi]], two associates of the [[Punisher]]. They claim to be Four and Eight, members of the organization called the [[Secret Empire]], one of Werner's fellow conference attendees. Werner did not want to risk a rift with the Empire, he thus declines to kill them. Via a spy, the Empire learns of the two prisoners. Coincidentally, the real Four and Eight had not shown up for the Kingpin division meeting. The Secret Empire became convinced Four and Eight had turned traitor. They send Chainsaw and his Praetorians, a motorcycle gang, to attack the entire group.<ref>''Punisher: War Journel'' #45-46</ref>

Werner survives the attack. He attends a later meeting of the criminal organizations, assisted by a brown-haired man. This assistant is really his father Baron Strucker. The meeting descends into violence, part of it resulting from Werner's siblings not believing he was a descendent from the Baron. After the meeting breaks up, the Baron slays Werner via the Death Spore virus and steps into power once again.<ref>''Daredevil'' #307-309; ''Nomad'' #4-6; ''Punisher War Journal'' #46-48</ref> Werner's corpse is found by a super-powered vigilante named [[Terror Inc.|Terror]].

During that time, Werner von Strucker poses as Alexander Braun where he developed a party lifestyle. Following his father's death at the hands of [[Ultron]] in ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'', Werner was captured by [[List of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. characters#Grant Ward|Grant Ward]] to gain access to his bank account, before eventually being informed about his father's involvement with Hydra and offered the chance to continue his legacy. Ward uses Strucker to confront Andrew Garner, but cannot kill him after Garner transforms into the Inhuman [[Lash (comics)|Lash]] and kills the Hydra operatives with him. For not killing him and being tipped off where Strucker is by Gideon Malick, Ward has Kebo beat Strucker until he is left in a comatose state. Eventually S.H.I.E.L.D. acquires Strucker's body, whose condition had gone from comatose to vegetative, in order for [[Phil Coulson]] to use the Theta Brain-Wave Frequency Machine on him in order to get information regarding the location of Gideon Malick. With Lincoln Campbell shocking parts of his brain, Werner told Coulson what he knows and even mentioned how Malick betrayed him.
