[[Werner von Strucker]] is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe.

==Fictional character biography==
Werner von Strucker is the oldest son of [[Baron Strucker|Baron Wolfgang von Strucker]] and the half-brother of twins [[Fenris (comics)|Andrea]] and [[Andreas von Strucker]].

Werner briefly took over [[HYDRA]] during one of his father's supposed deaths. Later Wolfgang would return from the dead via the death spore virus. Werner would use his influence to try to gain part of the territory of the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] after the man fell from power. The conference was set in Las Vegas, where things did not go well.

At first, he did detain two spies, who were in reality [[Microchip (comics)|Microchip]] and [[Mickey Fondozzi]], two associates of the [[Punisher]]. They claimed to be Four and Eight, members of the [[Secret Empire]]. Werner did not want to risk a rift with the Empire, thus declined to kill them. Via a spy, the Empire learned of the two prisoners. Coincidentally, the real Four and Eight had not shown up for the Kingpin division meeting. The Secret Empire became convinced the two had turned traitor and sent Chainsaw and his Praetorians, a motorcycle gang, to attack the entire group.

Werner survived the attack, to attend a later meeting, along with a brown-haired assistant. This assistant was really his father, Baron Von Strucker. This particular meeting degenerated into violence yet again, with Werner's siblings not believing he was related. Later, while alone, Werner was slain by his father so as to regain power in HYDRA.

Werner's corpse was found by a super-powered vigilante named '[[Terror Inc.|Terror]]', who stole one of his eyes in order to gain information about the conference.

==Other Media==
Werner made an appearance in the 1998 film [[Nick Fury: Agent of Shield]]. The role was played by [[Scott Heindl]].
