==Powers and abilities==
Lancaster Sneed is a master of various martial arts, especially karate. He was trained in armed and unarmed combat by British military intelligence. He is an expert on electrical devices, and skilled in demolitions work. His body was surgically rebuilt using metal plates, enhancing his strength, speed, stamina, durability, agility and reflexes, but not to superhuman levels. He wears a stolen exoskeleton body armor suit giving him enhanced strength; the suit is equipped with an apparatus generating electrical shocks on contact.

The suit is later water-proofed to prevent shorting out on contact with water.<ref>''Union Jack'' (2006-07) #2</ref>
