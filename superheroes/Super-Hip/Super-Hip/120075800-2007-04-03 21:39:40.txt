'''Super-Hip''' is a fictional character that appeared in [[comic books]] published by [[DC Comics]].  He first appeared in ''The [[Adventures of Bob Hope]]'' #95 (October-November 1965), in a story written by [[Arnold Drake]] and drawn by [[Bob Oksner]].

==Fictional character biography==
Tadwallader Jutefruce is the meek and nerdy nephew of [[Bob Hope]], and a student at [[Benedict Arnold]] High School (a school populated by [[Universal Horror]]-style monsters).  Whenever he gets angry, mild-mannered Tadwallader turns into the super-powered Super-Hip.  Super-Hip's outfit resembles a 1960s [[Carnaby Street]] [[Mod (lifestyle)|Mod]], complete with ruffled shirt, velvet jacket, and [[Chelsea Boot|Chelsea boots]] (with winged ankles, similar to the [[Sub-Mariner]]).  He also magically acquires an [[acoustic guitar]].  Tadwallader has no memory of his time as a superhero; the only one that knows of his secret identity is his pet dog, Harvard Harvard.  Super-Hip's "battle-cry" was "Blech to [[Lawrence Welk]]!"

Super-Hip appeared regularly in ''The Adventures of Bob Hope'' from issue #95 until the title's final issue, #109 (February/March 1968).  Super-Hip's sole non-Bob Hope appearance was in ''[[Doom Patrol]]'' vol. 1, #104 (June 1966), as a guest at the wedding of [[Elasti-Girl]] and [[Mento (comics)|Mento]].  The story was scripted by Arnold Drake.
