'''Baron Brimstone''' is the name of a [[Marvel Comics]] supervillain.

==History==
Baron Brimstone had successfully stole the Sol-Mac from the Chem-Solar Corporation with the intention of mass producing it as a weapon and selling it to various figures in the "criminal underworld." The security at Chem-Solar and [[Machine Man]] were unable to stop him in stealing the Sol-Mac. Baron Brimstone later organized a meeting with non-Maggia affiltrated criminals to recruit them into his Satan Squad. Duke Dawson, one of the assembled criminals, took the exception of Brimstone's leadership and met with Delmar Insurance agent Pamela Quinn which resulted in Baron Brimstone sending his lieutenants [[Snake Marston (comics)|"Snake" Marston]] and "Hammer" Harrison to bring her to Brimstone for interrogation. When Machine Man tracked them and found the Satan Squad's hideout, he rescued Quinn, and handed Baron Brimstone to the Police.

While at a Maximum Security unit on Ryker's Island, Baron Brimstone hypnotized a guard into freeing him and he escaped after releasing [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] and plotted his revenge on Machine Man. They appeared at Delmar Insurance to kidnap Pamela Quinn only to be thwarted by Machine Man and [[Spider-Man]] after which Baron Brimstone escaped.

Baron Brimstone later robbed a casino on the French Riviera where the Caribbean-based casino owners hired [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]] to bring him to justice. During that time, Paladin had help from the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] in fighting and defeating him.

[[Doctor Doom]] later used his Aggression Enhancer on Baron Brimstone as well as [[Armadillo (comics)|Armadillo]], [[Man-Ape]], [[Orka (comics)|Orka]], [[Stilt-Man]], and [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]] into attacking the Fantastic Four at their hearing, but they were defeated and taken into police custody.
