The '''White Rabbit''' (Real name unknown, although she took the last name Dodson upon marriage) is a minor comedic [[supervillain]] published by [[Marvel Comics]].

Her costume, weapons and speech are all based on rabbits and/or Lewis Carrol books. She is independently wealthy through her inheritance from her late husband (whom she assures died happy).  

==History==
She is largely considered to be one of [[Spider-Man]]'s most minor annoyances out of his rogue's gallery, likely second only to her onetime partner, the [[Walrus (comics)|Walrus]]. Spider-man normally encounters her along with her seeming arch-foe, the Fabulous [[Frog-Man]] in super-human battles that are often more funny than deadly. In her most recent endeavor, she was so hard pressed to find other villains willing to ally themselves with her that she was forced to hire actors to play the Mad Hatter (not the [[Batman]] villain) and the Dormouse.
