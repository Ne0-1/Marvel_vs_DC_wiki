The '''White Rabbit''' ('''Lorina Dodson''') is a [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics Universe]] and a classic [[Spider-Man]] enemy.  She first appeared in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #131 in July, 1983, and was created by [[J.M. DeMatteis]].

==Fictional character biography==
Born from a wealthy family, the girl who would become the White Rabbit grew up in a safe, secure environment and was showered with all the material possessions she desired.  However, she was bored, and only found entertainment from old novels, such as [[Alice in Wonderland]], her favorite.  As she grew older, her family married her off to an older gentleman named Lewis Dodson.  She eventually had him killed, and used her inheritance to buy various gadgets so that she could experience a life full of danger and excitement.

She became the '''White Rabbit''', an eccentric female costumed criminal.  While the White Rabbit is clearly insane, she is quite articulate and has a great knowledge of literature.  She spent her first days as a criminal robbing various fast food joints, most notably "Kwikkee Burgers."  She and her gang were eventually confronted by the [[Frog-Man]], who was able to defeat her hired help only with [[Spider-Man]]'s aid.  The White Rabbit escaped, but struck later at a book fair, where she found the two super heroes once again.  The White Rabbit, witnessing her men getting defeated, fled using her jet-boots, but they began to malfunction, allowing Frog-Man to knock her into a building.

Much later, she resurfaced, plotting to get her revenge on Frog-Man.  She allied herself with the [[Walrus (comics)|Walrus]], but they were defeated by Spider-Man, Frog-Man, and Frog-Man's father, [[Leap-Frog (comics)|Leap-Frog]].  Ditching the Walrus, she popped up again later with two new villains, Mad Hatter and Dormouse, though they were both actually hired actors, as no other supervillains would work with the White Rabbit.  She formed a new plan by capturing [[Grizzly (comics)|Grizzly]] and [[Gibbon (comics)|Gibbon]] and ransoming them for one billion dollars in gold.  She also created several genetically-altered rabbits, who were ready to eat Grizzly and Gibbon.  The Mayor, however, only offered the White Rabbit $2.50, which caused her to raise the ransom to five billion dollars, but Spider-Man, under the alias of the Bombastic Bag-Man, infiltrated the White Rabbit's hideout and battled her giant robot.  She was then knocked out by Grizzly; he and his partner had escaped, remembering Gibbon's natural affinity with the Animal Kingdom and thus taming the GM Rabbits.

Most recently, the White Rabbit, her outfit modified, became romantically involved with [[Arcade (comics)|Arcade]], a man with a dedication for drama and who controls 'Murderworlds', where people are killed off in carnivalesque ways. They go after two veteran superheros, [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] and the [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]].

The two heroes manage to defeat Arcade and the White Rabbit. They are dropped off into the [[Savage Land]], a pre-historic land hidden deep in the Antarctic. The White Rabbit became queen of a group of tribal warriors.
