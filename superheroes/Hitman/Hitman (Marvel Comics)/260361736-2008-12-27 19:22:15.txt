==Fictional character biography==
Burt Kenyon was a Vietnam veteran serving in the same company as Frank Castle, who would later become the [[Punisher]].

As the Hitman, Kenyon was a costumed mercenary assassin. He was hired by the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] as their version of the Punisher. The [[Vulture (comics)|Vulture]] had rejected the Maggia's offer before they hired the Hitman, so the Hitman was sent to humiliate the Vulture by killing [[Spider-Man]] before the Vulture could. The two villains fought over Spider-Man, allowing Spider-Man the chance to escape. The Hitman had placed tracers on both the Vulture and Spider-Man, and he continued to harass and attack them both. While Spider-Man feigned weakness, the Hitman coerced the Vulture into attacking Spider-Man, but Spider-Man turned so that the Hitman shot the Vulture's power pack instead of Spider-Man. The Hitman fled and Spider-Man gave the tracer to the Punisher to give him the opportunity to track the Hitman down.

The Hitman was hired by a terrorist group called the People's Liberation Front (PLF) to kidnap and kill [[J. Jonah Jameson]] for editorials written about the group.  While looking for the Hitman, the Punisher found himself battling the PLF.  As the Hitman confronted Jameson in his office, he attracted the attention of the Punisher and Spider-Man.  The Hitman escaped to the roof with Jameson as he fought Spider-Man, but Spider-Man followed him.  Hitman managed to escape in his mini-copter despite the Punisher's efforts to shoot Hitman.  One of Spider-Man's spider-tracers allowed them to track the Hitman to the Statue of Liberty, where the PLF planned to blow up the statue with Jameson inside.  The Punisher and Spider-Man arrived to stop the PLF, and confronted the Hitman.  Spider-Man managed to pull Jameson away from the Hitman, and the Punisher shot Hitman, who fell to his death.<ref>Amazing Spider-Man #175</ref>
