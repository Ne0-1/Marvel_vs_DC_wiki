'''Zatanna Zatara''' is a fictional character in the [[DC Comics]] [[fictional universe|universe]]. Created by writer [[Gardner Fox]] and artist [[Murphy Anderson]], Zatanna first appeared in ''[[Hawkman]]'' vol. 1 #4 (October–November 1964). The character, both a [[stage magician]] and a real [[Magician (fantasy)|magician]] like her father [[Zatara|Giovanni "John" Zatara]], is known for her involvement with the [[Justice League]], her [[retcon]]ned childhood association with [[Batman]], and her crossing of the [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] line with characters such as romantic partner [[John Constantine]] and protegé [[Timothy Hunter]].

==Fictional character biography==
Zatanna is the daughter of [[magic (paranormal)|magician]] [[Zatara|Giovanni Zatara]] (who appeared in [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] comic books) and Sindella, a member of the mystical ''[[Homo Magi|Homo magi]]'' race. Her younger cousin, the teenager [[Zachary Zatara]], is also a magician in the DCU.

Zatanna makes her living as a stage [[illusionist]] prior to discovering her magical abilities while investigating the disappearance of her father. Zatanna's search for her father was the subject of a storyline which was featured in several titles edited by [[Julius Schwartz]] and in it, Zatanna interacts with [[Batman]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] (in disguise as a witch and under the control of the villain [[Outsider (comic book villain)|The Outsider]]), [[Hawkman]] and [[Hawkwoman]] (''Hawkman'' Vol. 1, #4, Nov. 1964), [[Atom (comics)|the Atom]] (''The Atom''#19, May 1965), [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]] (''Green Lantern''Vol. 2, #42, Jan. 1966) and [[Elongated Man]] (''Detective Comics'' #355, Sept. 1966).  The series culminated in ''[[Justice League|Justice League of America]]'' #51 (Feb. 1967). This Justice League adventure took place during the Batman television craze where Batman was featured prominently on the cover. The premise that the witch in ''Detective'' #336 was Zatanna was perceived by many fans at the time as an attempt to get Batman participating in this issue of ''Justice League of America'' no matter how vague the connection to Zatanna's quest was.

Zatanna assists the Justice League of America on a number of cases before being elected to membership in ''Justice League of America'' #161 (Dec. 1978). During her tenure with the group, her power level diminishes, so that she can only control the [[Classical elements|four elements]] of earth, air, fire, and water; this limitation is reversed in ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' #277 (Mar. 1982).

[[Image:Zatannalight.PNG|left|Zatanna [[mind-wiping]] Doctor Light. Art by Brian Bolland.|thumb]]
In the 2004 limited series ''[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]]'', Zatanna is a member of the Justice League at the time the villain [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Dr. Light]] brutally attacks and [[rape]]s the [[Elongated Man]]'s wife, [[Sue Dibny]]. When apprehended, he threatens the JLA members' families. Although Zatanna is prepared to erase Light's memories of the incident (as she had done to other villains with dangerous knowledge to the League), tampering with Light's mind sparks a debate among the League members: should the villain's personality be transformed in order to prevent him from repeating his crime? Zatanna, Hawkman, and The [[Atom (Ray Palmer)]] vote for such action, while [[Green Arrow]], [[Black Canary]], and Green Lantern ([[Hal Jordan]]) vote against. The [[Flash (Barry Allen)]] breaks the tie. Zatanna [[mind-wipe]]s Light, and the process results in his intellectual abilities being lowered. In the midst of the process, Batman appears and tries to stop it. Zatanna freezes him, and the members vote unanimously to erase Batman's memories of the incident as well.

Her working relationship to Batman sours after he discovers the alteration to his memory. When Zatanna helps Batman with reconnaissance at one of [[Ra's al Ghul]]'s [[Lazarus Pit]]s, she asks him why he came to her. "I needed someone I could trust," Batman says. "But I had to settle for you." However, after ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', their relationship appears to have warmed; in ''Detective Comics'' #824 he calls her for information on a card-counter involved in scamming [[Penguin (comics)|the Penguin]]. He makes no mention of their conflict, and casually calls her by her nickname, "Zee".

[[Catwoman]] discovers that Zatanna's [[mind-wipe]] of Dr. Light in ''Identity Crisis'' is not an isolated occurrence; Catwoman's journey from villain to hero and her resulting efforts to lead a moral life are [[retcon]]ned as being the result of Zatanna's mental intervention. Catwoman comes to distrust her memories, motives, and the choices she has made since that incident. In retaliation, Catwoman covers Zatanna's mouth with a piece of [[duct tape]] and shoves her out a window.

A 2005 four-issue ''Zatanna'' limited series was published as part of [[Grant Morrison]]'s ''[[Seven Soldiers of Victory]]'' event. In it, at a [[support group]] for [[superhero]]es, she recounts a failed magical ritual to search for her father's tomes, during which one of her past spells summons a [[shapeshifting|shapeshifter]] named Gwydion, who kills her companions. This [[Psychological trauma|trauma]], combined with her guilt from her former [[mind-wipe]]s, robs her of her powers. With the help of her new apprentice, [[Sheeda#Sheeda characters|Misty Kilgore]], she captures Gwydion to use as her own. She eventually regains her confidence and powers, and uses them to defeat Zor, a rogue Time Tailor who released the Sheeda as a [[wiktionary:plague|plague]] to infect and degrade the entire [[universe]]. As a reward, the other Time Tailors allow her one last meeting with her father, who reveals that his books were written in her, his "greatest spell and gift to the world." In the final battle against the Sheeda, Zatanna casts a spell to move time and space, retroactively positioning the Seven Soldiers to overthrow the Sheeda.

In ''Detective Comics'' #833 (August 2007), it is stated that Zatanna's father was a friend of [[Thomas Wayne]].  Zatara trained Bruce Wayne in the art of escape; and Bruce and Zatanna were childhood friends (although Batman believes that he has never met in her ''Justice League of America'' #51, and her only memory of meeting him is while she was disguised). Bruce helps Zatanna investigate the death of one of her former assistants; all clues point to a performer named Ivar Loxias.  However, Loxias is revealed to be the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] in disguise; he shoots Zatanna in the throat and incapacitates Batman.  Zatanna is able to heal herself by writing a curing spell in her own blood, and she is instrumental in foiling the Joker's scheme.  Bruce puts Zatanna's betrayal behind him, allowing the two to renew their friendship.

On the "Roll Call" of ''Justice League of America'' #22, Zatanna is listed as a part of the team. Called upon to help with [[Red Tornado (comics)|Red Tornado]]'s restoration in his android form, she aids the League when they are attacked by a new, powerful iteration of [[Amazo]]. During the battle, Zatanna has her mouth magically removed, and once again uses her blood to write out spells and restore it.<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #23 (July 2008)</ref> However, she is silenced again after Amazo uses his [[Power ring (DC Comics)|power ring]] to create a gag for her mouth, rendering her useless for much of the fight. After Wonder Woman throws off Amazo's concentration and causes the gag to vanish, Zatanna defeats Amazo once and for all by using Red Tornado's soul. Following this battle, Zatanna rejoins the team.<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #24 (August 2008)</ref>

Shortly before the [[Batman R.I.P.|mysterious disappearance of Batman]] and the ''[[Final Crisis]]'' events Zatanna is stalked and targeted by [[Hush (comics)|Hush]], wanting to get his vengeance over Bruce Wayne using the people he loves most: Zatanna herself and [[Catwoman (comics)|Selina Kyle]]. Zatanna escapes Hush's wrath, and is able to provide help and relief to the wounded Catwoman.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Zatanna  later accompanies [[Firestorm (Jason Rusch)|Firestorm]], [[Black Lightning]], and Batman to Metropolis after they come to believe [[Kimiyo Hoshi]] has been kidnapped by agents of the covert metahuman team known as the [[Shadow Cabinet (comics)|Shadow Cabinet]].<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #27 (November 2008)</ref><ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #28 (December 2008)</ref> After a brief conflict, Zatanna and the others are informed by teenaged superheroine [[Rocket (comics)|Rocket]] that Kimiyo's perceived abduction was actually a misunderstanding caused by the Shadow Cabinet's mission to seek out her help in dealing with the cosmic vampire known as [[Starbreaker (comics)|Starbreaker]].<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #29 (January 2009)</ref><ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #30 (February 2009)</ref> With assistance from [[Hardware (comics)|Hardware]] and [[Icon (comics)|Icon]], Zatanna and her comrades are able to defeat Starbreaker in a massive battle in the [[Himalayas]].<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #32 (July 2009)</ref><ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #33 (August 2009)</ref><ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #34 (June 2009)</ref>

In ''Gotham City Sirens'' Zatanna is visited and violently restrained by [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], who interacts via a tree and asks her if her encounter with [[Catwoman]] changed Selina in any way.<ref>''Gotham City Sirens'' (2009)</ref>

Zatanna takes a leave of absence from the JLA, only to reappear during a battle with [[Despero]]. Once Despero is defeated, Zatanna informs the League of the apocalyptic events of the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' taking place across the globe.<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #38 (October 2009)</ref> After taking the team to the [[Hall of Justice]] to find Firestorm, she is forced to fight the undead form of her father, continually pitting the black magic he wields against her own;<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #39 (November 2009)</ref> it is implied she was successful in banishing the Black Lantern, but was left psychologically crushed from having to kill her father again (in a fashion).<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #40 (December 2009)</ref> In the aftermath of Blackest Night, Kimiyo mentions that Zatanna is one of the members who has left the team.<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #41</ref>

In May 2010 Zatanna began starring in her own solo series, written by [[Paul Dini]] and with art from [[Stephane Roux]]. Now no longer an active member of the JLA, Zatanna is asked by officer Dale Colton to help her solve a murder case at a restaurant frequented by mobsters. Zatanna informs Dale that the murderer was a powerful sorcerer known as Brother Night, who rules the supernatural crime scene in San Francisco. After Zatanna shows up at Night's demonic nightclub and threatens him, he responds by calling upon a powerful demon for help in taking her down.<ref>''Zatanna'' #1</ref> Aside from Brother Night, Zatanna also faces other threats, such as Oscar Hample, a man who tried to murder her when she was a child and was turned into a puppet by her father.<ref>''Zatanna'' #8-11</ref> She is also kidnapped by a new villain named Siphon, who tries to steal her abilities. Using Zatanna's cellphone, [[Power Girl]] finds her and removes the duct tape form Zatanna's mouth, and together the two heroines defeat Siphon.<ref>''Power Girl'' #22-23</ref> Zatanna's series ended with issue #16.

===The New 52===
Following the events of ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'', Zatanna was made into one of the main characters in [[Peter Milligan]]'s ''[[Justice League Dark]]'' series. She also sports a new costume, though she still wears her classic magician's outfit during shows. In the first issue, she learns that Superman, Wonder Woman and [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] have been defeated by the [[Enchantress (DC Comics)|Enchantress]] and volunteers her services to the League. Batman offers to help her fight Enchantress, but Zatanna uses her powers to tie him up, reasoning that Batman is too valuable to the world to die in battle.<ref>''Justice League Dark'' #1 (September 2011)</ref>

==Relationships==
Zatanna has had various romantic relationships with fellow DC characters, including [[John Constantine]] (with whom she practiced [[tantra]]) and [[Doctor Thirteen]].<ref>''Seven Soldiers:  Zatanna'' #1</ref>  Zatanna also had a brief flirtational relationship with her fellow Justice Leaguer [[Flash (Barry Allen)|the Flash (Barry Allen)]] shortly after the death of his wife Iris.<br>She also (currently) has a strong friendship with Batman due to their shared (retconned) pasts. In ''Detective Comics'' #843 and #844, Zatanna and Bruce briefly discuss the possibility of having a more meaningful relationship. Both later concede that Bruce is too devoted to his cause as Batman to give her the relationship she wishes for, but the pair reaffirm their bond as close friends.<br>Catwoman, however, appears to consider Zatanna a more dangerous contender for Bruce's attentions than Jezebel Jet (his fiancée at the time).<ref>''Detective Comics'' #845</ref> A [[pep talk]] between the two women confirms how Zatanna really meant, during the fateful discussion with Bruce, to explore the possibility of a true romance, but turned out quietly resigned to the role of best friend and confidante. Claiming to act on Bruce's best interest, she pushes Selina into confessing her feelings to Bruce, thus ''stealing'' him from [[Jezebel Jet]] before it's too late.<ref name="Detective Comics #847 2008" />

==Powers and abilities==
Zatanna is a powerful sorceress whose abilities are apparently [[gene]]tic.  As a tribute to her father and as a focal point, she usually casts spells by speaking verbal commands backwards. She has also proven capable on many occasions of casting spells by speaking normally, and, in rarer occasions, the ability to use magic for simple tasks without speaking. Like [[Black Canary]], Zatanna's reliance on her voice often led to her being bound and gagged by villains in Silver Age stories, thus rendering her 'powerless'. On very rare occasions, Zatanna has cast spells by writing them in her own blood rather than speaking them aloud. It's used as a last resort, only to heal from severe physical damage preventing her to speak, like having her [[larynx]] mangled by a bullet, or her mouth magically erased by her own powers. The only magic command issued in both cases, ''Heal me'', had to be spelled backwards, as she were speaking (''laeH em'').

Overuse of her magical powers can deplete them to the point that further use of them starts to put a considerable strain on her physical well-being: as with other magical users, the only way to restore her waning powers is an extended period of rest.

Even if not as precisely as [[Madame Xanadu]], Zatanna has proven herself able to call upon [[tarot]] reading for insight or divination.<ref name="Detective Comics #847 2008">{{cite comic |title=[[Detective Comics]] |volume=1 |issue=847 |year=2008 |publisher=[[DC Comics]] |location=[[New York City|New York, NY]]}}</ref>  Apparently, such a task does not require verbal incantations, spoken or written, at all, nor is it tied to a specific tarot deck.

The limits of her powers have never been clearly established. She is often depicted working alongside the most powerful magic-users on Earth, including [[Doctor Fate]], [[Madame Xanadu]], and [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]].  She has used her powers to command elemental forces, heal, transmute and transmogrify objects, manipulate minds, and attack her opponents with energy blasts. She has resurrected the city of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] from ruin,  merged [[Aquaman]]'s spirit with the entire ocean in the finale of the "Obsidian Age" story arc{{Issue|date=April 2009}}, and manipulated time and space. During a portion of her initial tenure with the Justice League, her powers were more limited, consisting in the manipulation of fire, air, water, and earth. Furthermore, her powers seems tied to her self-confidence, as the long series of blunders described in ''Seven Soldiers'' left her both emotionally and psychologically shattered, powerless, until she was able to restore her lost confidence.

Zatanna is a skilled illusionist, showgirl and stage magician even without resorting to her innate magical powers. In fact she considers part of her "training" exercising [[sleight of hand]] tricks, and she claims to have invented a variation of the [[Three-card Monte|three card shuffle game]] called the "Zatara shuffle", in which she's so fast and precise that, even without resorting to cheating, only skilled gamblers like Selina Kyle are able to follow the movements of her hands.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Zatanna first appears in a ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' episode "Zatanna" voiced by [[Julie Brown]]. She appears as an illusionist with no apparent magic powers. She developed a close relationship with Bruce Wayne (who was using the alias "John Smith") during the years in which Bruce was traveling the globe learning skills that later serve him as Batman. Zatanna later comes to [[Gotham City]] with her magic show, but finds herself being framed by a criminal magic debunker named Montague Kane. Her efforts to restore her name and stop the villain put her side-by-side with the Batman. During the course of the episode, Batman reveals his identity as "John Smith" to Zatanna.

* Zatanna makes two appearances in the ''[[Gotham Girls]]'' flash animation episodes, voiced by Stacie Randall. In "A Little Night Magic", Zatanna walks home on her own after doing a magic show and has some adventures on the way: She turns a robber's gun into a snake, splits a truck in half when it almost runs her over, and turns some street thugs into toads after they take her hat. In "Hold the Tiger", Zatanna stops Catwoman from stealing the Cat's Eye Opals from a jewelry store. Zatanna does not arrest Catwoman but instead asks Catwoman for help in finding her [[white tiger]].

* Zatanna made a short appearance in ''[[Batman Beyond]]'' episode "Out of the Past" (season three, episode five) in a collection of pictures that Bruce is looking at on his computer of past loves, alongside Lois Lane, Selina Kyle/Catwoman and Barbara Gordon.

[[Image:Zatanna.JPG|175px|thumb|right|Zatanna as seen in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "This Little Piggy".]]
* Zatanna appears in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "This Little Piggy" voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]]. She helps Batman search for the villainess [[Circe (comics)|Circe]] (who has turned [[Wonder Woman]] into a pig). Zatanna is apparently aware of Batman's true identity since her last appearance ("Bruce! I haven't seen you for so long...") and knows him well enough to perceive his romantic relationship with Wonder Woman. In her ''JLU'' depictions, her spells are often cast backwards, but almost equally often cast without words, and on one occasion, speaking normally. She also appeared in the episode "The Balance" (voiced by an uncredited [[Juliet Landau]]) amongst the magic-based superheroes affected by the disturbance in the magical balance. In "Destroyer", Zatanna appears as one of many Justice League Members called to help fight the invading [[Apokolips|Apokoliptan]] forces. DCAU writer [[Paul Dini]] wrote both of Zatanna's former and latter appearances described above. In 1998, [[Alan Burnett]] told ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard Magazine]]'' "Paul Dini wanted to use Zatanna because he’s secretly in love with her. It’s something we try not to talk about too much." 

[[Image:ZatannaCM.jpg|175px|thumb|right|Teenage Zatanna in ''Cartoon Monsoon'']]
* Two episodes of a Cartoon Monsoon contest entry feature Zatanna as a teenage hero who is a cross between ''[[Sabrina, the Teenage Witch]]'' and ''[[Buffy Summers|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''. This saw her match wits with [[Klarion the Witch Boy]], and also featured her father (referred to only as "Zatara") as well as the new character of Zatanna's older, non-magic-wielding brother (named "Damon" in the second episode).

[[Image:Serinda Swan as Zatanna Zatara.jpg|150px|thumb|right|[[Serinda Swan]] as Zatanna Zatara on ''Smallville''.]]
* Zatanna is a recurring character in the final three seasons of ''Smallville'', portrayed by actress [[Serinda Swan]]. The character first appeared late in [[Smallville (season 8)|season eight]], in the episode "Hex".<ref>http://www.kryptonsite.com/</ref> She is described as the daughter of the deceased [[John Zatara]], "the world's greatest magician". Zatanna is introduced at the Ace of Clubs, the scene of [[Chloe Sullivan]] ([[Allison Mack]])'s birthday party. To enliven things, Zatanna uses magic to make characters' inner desires come true &mdash; Chloe is physically transformed to resemble her cousin, [[Lois Lane]] ([[Erica Durance]]), for example, and [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark]] ([[Tom Welling]]) becomes "normal". Zatanna later approaches [[Green Arrow|Oliver Queen]] ([[Justin Hartley]]) and offers him a deal: she will grant him a wish if he returns her father's magical book to her. Once she acquires the Book of Zatara from Green Arrow, whom she recognizes as Oliver, she reveals her aim is to use it to resurrect her father. Because Clark is vulnerable to magic, and Oliver lacks the power to stop her, Zatanna has to realize for herself that her father sacrificed himself so she could live. She later goes to Oliver to explain herself, and decides to help him if he encounters any supernatural foes along the way by leaving him her phone number. Swan reprises the role in the [[Smallville (season 9)|ninth season]] of ''Smallville'' in the episode titled "Warrior". In [[Smallville (season 10)|season ten]] episodes which feature the government attempting to hunt down the [[Justice League (Smallville)|Justice League]], Zatanna's picture is shown among their targets. Although not portrayed by Swan, an actor in costume represents Zatanna in the episode "Icarus". In the episode "Fortune", Zatanna is used as a plot device; the episode establishes her as having sent an enchanted bottle of wine to Clark and Lois on the night of their engagement party, which sets the events of that episode in motion.

* Zatanna appears in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' in the teaser of "Chill of the Night!". Jennifer Hale reprises her role of Zatanna from ''Justice League Unlimited''. She and Batman stop [[Abra Kadabra (comics)|Abra Kadabra]] from robbing a museum exhibit displaying the history of magicians. While Batman holds back the mind control slaves, Zatanna battles Kadabra, and traps him in her hat. She later pulls out a tiny bird cage with Kadabra in it, winning the magic battle. Though she relies primarily on vocal spells, she is also shown to be able to effectively wield Kadabra's magic wand after he binds her mouth closed. This version of Zatanna wears a slightly modified version of her original outfit, with her trademark [[fishnet]]s replaced by purple [[tights]].

[[Image:ZeeYJ.jpg|175px|thumb|right|Zatanna in ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]''.]]
* Zatanna appears in the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' episode "Humanity",<ref>http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/news.php?action=fullnews&id=1134</ref> voiced by [[Lacey Chabert]]. In this incarnation, she is around 14 years old <ref>http://www.s8.org/gargoyles/askgreg/search.php?qid=13754</ref>. Zatara initially brings Zatanna to Mount Justice in [[Happy Harbor]] to meet the team, and asks the kids give Zatanna a tour of Mount Justice. They pretend to go along with that request, quickly use [[Miss Martian]]'s ship to leave the cave and track down [[Red Tornado]]. When heading to Yellowstone National Park, Zatanna mentions that her magic is not at the same level as her father. Upon arrival, [[Aqualad (Jackson Hyde)|Aqualad]] tells Zatanna to stay behind, but ultimately allows her to join them anyway. When fighting Red Tornado, Zatanna tries to use her magic on him only to be knocked out by Red Tornado alongside the team. When Red Volcano activates the volcano, Zatanna uses her magic to give the illusion of Kid Flash multiplies. Zatara was displeased that his daughter went on a mission with the team. It can also be noted that Robin seems to have an interest in her. She briefly appears alongside [[Red Arrow (comics)|Red Arrow]], [[Rocket (comics)|Rocket]], [[Garth (comics)|Garth]] and [[Aquagirl|Tula]] in "Failsafe" as part of a training simulation. She returns in the episode "Secrets", where she and [[Artemis Crock#In other media|Artemis]] head to [[Manhattan]] on Halloween night. They are ambushed and eventually kidnapped by [[Harm (comics)|Harm]], a psychotic teenager wielding the mystical sword of [[Beowulf]]. While Harm interrogates Artemis, the ghost of his murdered sister, [[Secret (comics)|Secret]], removes the tape from Zatanna's mouth and allows her to rescue Artemis. Together, the three girls defeat Harm and allow Secret's spirit to move on to the afterlife. Afterwards, Zatanna promises to erect a proper grave for Secret, who had previously been buried in Harm's backyard.

===Film===
* In 2005 screenwriter Hadley Davis (''[[Ice Princess]]'') announced that she had written an action-comedy featuring a teenaged version of Zatanna. Nothing further was ever heard about this project, and it is presumed to have been abandoned.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/?category=0&id=30663 |title=Davis Conjures ''Zatanna'' |work=[[Sci Fi Wire]] |publisher=[[NBC Universal]] |date=23 March 2005}}{{Dead link|date=February 2011}}</ref>
