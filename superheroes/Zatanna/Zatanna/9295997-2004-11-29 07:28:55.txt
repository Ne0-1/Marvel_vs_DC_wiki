'''Zatanna''' is a [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]].

She is a [[wizard]], the daughter of the wizard superhero, [[Zatara]] and shares the family's inherit ability to cast powerful spells by giving mystical commands that are spelled backwards.

She was a stage [[illusionist]] before she discovered her true magic powers when investigating the disappearance of her father.  The story of this search was the subject of the first major [[comic book]] [[crossover]] [[story arc]] as she meets various superheroes like [[Batman]], [[Hawkman]] and [[Hawkwoman]] and [[Green Lantern]].

She later joined the [[Justice League of America]] in a tenure where her powers were limited to magic relating to the elements.  After her departure from the team, she regained her full power and she continues her stage career with the additional calling as a sentinel against mystical threats.

===Other Media Depiction===
The character first appeared in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' where she was depicted as simply being an illusionist with no apparent magic powers who was a close friend of [[Bruce Wayne]] when he was trained by her and father.

Since then, further depictions both on online [[Flash animation]] shorts and in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' have had her with her powers.  In addition, there were also two episodes of a ''[[Cartoon Monsoon]]'' contest entry where Zatanna was a teenage hero who was more like a cross of ''[[Sabrina The Teenage Witch]]'' and ''[[Buffy The Vampire Slayer]]''.
