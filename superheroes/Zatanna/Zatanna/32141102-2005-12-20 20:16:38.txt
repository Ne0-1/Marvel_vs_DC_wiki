'''Zatanna''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]]ine in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]].

She is a [[wizard]], the daughter of two other wizards, and shares the family's inherent ability to cast powerful spells; like her father, [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] [[magician]] [[Zatara|John Zatara]], she does this by describing the desired effect in backwards speech (e.g., ''sdrawkcab hceeps'').

==Character biography==

Zatanna has one of the most unusual backgrounds in comics. Zatara himself was a descendant of [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (who happened to be a secret magician in the DC universe), the [[Freemason]] [[Cagliostro]], [[Alchemist]] [[Nicholas Flamel]], and [[Nostradamus]]. In addition, her uncle is Alchemist [[Fulcanelli|Evan Fulcanelli]]. Her mother is [[Sindella]], a member of the [[Homo Magi]] race, who have been suggested to come from [[Atlantis]]. (It has been implied that Zatanna is descended from [[Arion|King Arion of Atlantis]].)

===First Appearance===

She was a stage [[illusionist]] before she discovered her true magic powers when investigating the disappearance of her father.  The story of this search was the subject of the first major [[comic book]] [[crossover]] [[story arc]] as she meets various superheroes like [[Batman]], [[Hawkman]] and [[Hawkwoman]] and [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]].

===Justice League member===
She assisted the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]] on a number of cases before finally being elected to membership in ''Justice League of America'' #161.  During her tenure with that group, her power level was briefly reduced to having control of the four elements of [[Empedocles]] (earth, air, fire, and water); this limitation was reversed in ''World's Finest Comics'' #277.  

While she was a member of the group, the villan [[Doctor Light (DC Comics supervillain)|Dr. Light]] brutally raped the [[Elongated Man]]'s wife [[Sue Dibny]] and threatned to after the other JLA's members as well. After erasing Light's memories of the event, the JLA decided to also tamper with his mind so he wouldn't pose a threat to their loved ones anymore. Zatanna used her magic to do so, accidentally lowering his intellect as a result. She also had to erase [[Batman]]'s memories of the event, after he tried to stop them altering Light. This was all revealed in the 2004 miniseries ''[[Identity Crisis (comics)|Identity Crisis]]''. 

After her departure from the team, she regained her full power and she continues her stage career with the additional calling as a sentinel against mystical threats.

In 2005 Zatanna is one of the main 7 in Grant Morrison's 30-issue mini-series ''[[Seven Soldiers of Victory]]'' Here, it was revealed that the reaction of her peers to the mindwipes was so extreme as to make her lose her self-confidence, and with it, her magic. However, with the help of [[Etta Candy]] and the news of an impending apocalyptic battle, she regains her powers.

===Vertigo===

Zatanna also appears in DC's [[Vertigo (comics)|Vertigo]] imprint.  She appears several times in ''[[The Books of Magic]]'', typically to counsel Timothy Hunter, the main character. In [[Hellblazer]] she was the [[Tantric Buddhism|tantric]] partner of [[John Constantine]] at one point in the past. An alternate version of Zatanna with blonde hair was seen in ''[[Books of Magick: Life During Wartime]]''. The world depicted there is populated by both humans(known there as the Bred) and by races of the [[Faerie]] (known as the Born). A war is going on between the the Born ruling elite and a coalition of Born and Bred who intend to overthrow the current dictatorial regime. The version of Zatanna that exist on this world fights for this Coalition.

==Depictions in other media==

The animated version of Zatanna first appeared in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' (voiced by [[Julie Brown]]) where she was depicted as simply being an illusionist with no apparent magic powers. She developed a close friendship with [[Bruce Wayne]] during the years in which Bruce was travelling the globe, learning skills that would later serve him as Batman. He came to Zatara as "John Smith" to learn to be an escape artist, but also found his young daughter growing attracted to him. Later in life, she came to [[Gotham City|Gotham]] with her magic show, but found herself being framed by a cynical and criminal magic debunker, Montague Kane. Her efforts to restore her name and stop Kane put her side-by-side with the Batman, whom she ended up recognizing as "John Smith".

Since then, further depictions both on online [[Flash animation]] shorts and in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' (voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]]) have shown her with powers. Somewhere between ''Batman'' and ''JLU'', she gained both significant magical powers and knowledge of the real secret identity of Batman. This granted her membership to the expanded 57-member superhero group, which helped Batman when Circe transformed [[Wonder Woman]] into a pig. Zatanna led Batman on a chase of the goddess, culminating in Batman having to sing "Am I Blue?" (thus exposing a hidden part of himself) to get Circe to reverse the spell. 

[[DCAU]] fan-favorite writer [[Paul Dini]] wrote both of Zatanna's major appearances as chronicled above, and apparently likes the character quite a lot. (In 1998, Alan Burnett told [[Wizard Magazine]]: "Paul Dini wanted to use Zatanna because he’s secretly in love with her.  It’s something we try not to talk about too much.") Paul recently married magician [http://www.mistylee.com Misty Lee], who has been cited by Zatanna fans as a real-life version of the character, so the last laugh may indeed be his.

In addition, there were also two episodes of a ''[[Cartoon Monsoon]]'' contest entry where Zatanna was a teenage hero who was more like a cross between ''[[Sabrina The Teenage Witch]]'' and ''[[Buffy The Vampire Slayer]]''.
