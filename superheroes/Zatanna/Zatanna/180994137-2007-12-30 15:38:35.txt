'''Zatanna Zatara''' is a fictional character in the [[DC Comics]] [[fictional universe|universe]]. Created by writer [[Gardner Fox]] and artist [[Murphy Anderson]], Zatanna first appeared in ''[[Hawkman]]'' vol. 1 #4 ([[October]]-[[November]] [[1964]]).

==Fictional character biography==
Zatanna is the daughter of magician [[Zatara|John Zatara]] (who appeared in [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] comic books) and Sindella, a member of the mystical “[[Homo Magi]]” race. Zatanna is a direct descendant of the artist [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (who was a magician in the [[DC universe]]), and is related to [[Nostradamus]]; [[Alessandro Cagliostro]]; [[Alchemy|alchemists]] [[Nicolas Flamel]] and [[Fulcanelli|Evan Fulcanelli]]; and [[Arion (comics)|King Arion of Atlantis]]. Her younger cousin, the teenager [[Zachary Zatara]], is also a magician in the DCU.

Zatanna makes her living as a stage illusionist prior to discovering her magical abilities while investigating the disappearance of her father. Zatanna's search for her father was the subject of the first major comic book [[fictional crossover|crossover]] in 1964, and in it, Zatanna interacts with [[Batman]] and [[Robin]], [[Hawkman]] and [[Hawkwoman]], [[the Atom]], [[Elongated Man]], and [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]].

Zatanna assists the [[Justice League of America]] on a number of cases before being elected to membership in ''Justice League of America'' #161. During her tenure with the group, her power level diminishes, so that she can only control the four elements of earth, air, fire, and water; this limitation is reversed in ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' #277.

In the 1993 [[limited series]] ''Zatanna: Come Together'', Zatanna worries about her lack of focus in using magic. She decides that her father's style of magic is wrong for her, and explores her mother's mystical heritage.

In the 2004 limited series ''[[Identity Crisis (comics)|Identity Crisis]],'' Zatanna is a member of the Justice League at the time the villain [[Doctor Light (DC Comics supervillain)|Dr. Light]] brutally attacks and [[rape]]s the [[Elongated Man]]'s wife, [[Sue Dibny]]. When apprehended, he threatens the JLA members' families. Although Zatanna is prepared to erase Light's memories of the incident (as she had done to other villains with dangerous knowledge to the League), tampering with Light's mind sparks a debate among the League members: should the villain's personality be transformed in order to prevent him from repeating his crime? Zatanna, Hawkman, and The Atom ([[Ray Palmer]]) vote for such action, while [[Green Arrow]], [[Black Canary]], and Green Lantern ([[Hal Jordan]]) vote against. The Flash ([[Barry Allen]]) breaks the tie. Zatanna mind-wipes Light, and the process results in his intellectual abilities being lowered. In the midst of the process, Batman appears and tries to stop it. Zatanna freezes him, and the members vote to erase Batman's memories of the incident as well.

Her relationship to Batman sours after he discovers the alteration to his memory. When Zatanna helps Batman with reconnaissance at one of [[Ra's al Ghul]]'s [[Lazarus Pit]]s, she asks him why he came to her. "I needed someone I can trust," Batman says. "But I had to settle for you." However, after [[Infinite Crisis]], their relationship appears to have warmed; in ''Detective Comics #824'' he calls her for information on a card-counter involved in scamming [[Penguin (comics)|the Penguin]]. He makes no mention of their conflict, and casually calls her by her nickname, "Zee".

After departing from the League, Zatanna continues to appear on stage and to defend against mystical threats, joining the [[Sentinels of Magic]].

Zatanna's mind-wipe of Dr. Light in ''Identity Crisis'' is not an isolated occurrence. [[Catwoman]] discovers that her journey from villain to hero and her resulting efforts to lead a moral life are the result of Zatanna's mental intervention. Catwoman comes to distrust her memories, motives, and the choices she has made since that incident.

A 2005 four-issue ''Zatanna'' limited series was published as part of [[Grant Morrison]]'s ''[[Seven Soldiers of Victory]]'' event. In it, at a [[support group]] for [[superhero]]es, she recounts a failed magical ritual to search for her father's tomes, during which one of her past spells summons a [[shapeshifter]] named Gwydion, who kills her companions. This [[Psychological trauma|trauma]], combined with her guilt from her former mind-wipes, robs her of her powers. With the help of her new apprentice, [[Sheeda#Sheeda Characters|Misty Kilgore]], she captures Gwydion to use as her own. She eventually regains her confidence and powers, and uses them to defeat Zor, a rogue Time Tailor who released the Sheeda as a [[plague]] to infect and degrade the entire [[universe]]. As a reward, the other Time Tailors allow her one last meeting with her father, who reveals that his books were written in her, his "greatest spell and gift to the world". In the final battle against the Sheeda, Zatanna casts a spell to move time and space, retroactively positioning the Seven Soldiers to overthrow the Sheeda.

Zatanna is currently a reserve member of the Justice League, aiding them from time to time when her magical expertise is needed. She declines an offer for full membership, stating her need to take a break from heroics. She is still a regular guardian against mystical threats.

In ''Detective Comics'' #833, it is revealed that Zatanna's father was a friend of [[Thomas Wayne]].  Zatara trained Bruce Wayne in the art of escape; and Bruce and Zatanna were childhood friends. Bruce helps Zatanna investigate the death of one of her former assistants; all clues point to a performer named Ivar Loxias.  However, Loxias is revealed to be the [[The Joker (comics)|Joker]] in disguise; he shoots Zatanna in the throat and incapacitates Batman.  Zatanna is able to heal herself by writing a curing spell in her own blood, and she is instrumental in foiling the Joker's scheme.  Bruce puts Zatanna's betrayal behind him, allowing the two to renew their friendship.

Zatanna helps [[Catwoman]], to whom she owes a favor, mind-wiping [[Angle Man]] and [[Film Freak]], who had been subdued by Selina after the two discovered her secret identity and threatened her child. 

Following the flooding of Earth-26, the [[Zoo Crew]] and other humanoid animal refugees escape, transformed into their animal counterparts and unable to speak, even though they retain their human-level intelligence.  Zatanna encounters the group and takes [[Captain Carrot]] as a pet for use in her magic act, unaware of his true identity.

==Alternate versions==
*An alternate version of Zatanna with blonde hair is seen in the 2004/2005 series ''[[Books of Magick: Life During Wartime]]''. In the series, Zatanna fights for a coalition of humans and [[faerie]]s against the [[dictator]]ial class of faerie-ruling elites.
*Annataz Arataz, Zatanna's evil [[Earth-3]] counterpart, assists [[Superman Prime]] to detain and torment [[Mr. Mxyzptlk]] in ''Countdown to Final Crisis'' #23.  The imp refuses to provide Prime with information, and Annataz restores his powers.  Reflecting upon her own prior cruel actions, she allows herself to be killed by the enraged villain. Her spells are recited "upside-down", rather than backwards.

==Powers and abilities==
Zatanna is a powerful sorceress whose abilities are apparently [[gene]]tic.  As a tribute to her father and as a focal point, she usually casts spells by speaking verbal commands backwards.  However, she has demonstrated the ability to use magic for simple tasks without speaking.  Not unlike [[Black Canary]], Zatanna's reliance on her voice often led to her being bound and gagged by villains in Silver Age stories, thus rendering her 'powerless.'  On very rare occasions, Zatanna has cast spells by writing them in her own blood rather than speaking them aloud.

The limits of her powers have never been clearly established.  She has been called the most powerful member of the Justice League, and is often depicted working alongside the most powerful magic-users on Earth, including [[Doctor Fate]], [[Madame Xanadu]], and [[Captain Marvel]].  She has used her powers to command elemental forces, heal, transmute and transmogrify objects, manipulate minds, and attack her opponents with energy blasts. She has resurrected the city of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] from ruin, merged [[Aquaman]]'s spirit with the entire ocean, and manipulated time and space.  During her initial tenure with the Justice League, her powers were more limited, consisting in the manipulation of fire, air, water and earth.

Zatanna owns a mansion called Shadowcrest, in which she keeps a vast library of magical knowledge, as well as an arsenal of powerful relics, enough to do "just about anything you'd want to do."  Shadowcrest seems to exist in a completely different dimension, although it is initially located outside of Gotham.

==Depictions in other media==
===Animation===
[[Image:Zatanna.JPG|thumb|left|Zatanna, as depicted in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'']]
Zatanna first appears in a ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' [[Zatanna (Batman: The Animated Series)|episode]] (voiced by [[Julie Brown]]) as an illusionist with no apparent magic powers. She developed a close relationship with Bruce Wayne (who was using the alias "John Smith") during the years in which Wayne was travelling the globe, learning skills that later serve him as Batman. Zatanna later comes to [[Gotham City]] with her magic show, but finds herself being framed by a criminal magic debunker. Her efforts to restore her name and stop the villain put her side-by-side with the Batman, whom she recognizes as "John Smith".

Further [[DC Animated Universe]] depictions, both in online [[Flash animation]] shorts and ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episodes, show her trademark magic. She appears in the episode "[[This Little Piggy (Justice League Unlimited episode)|This Little Piggy]]", (this time voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]]), where she helps Batman search for the villainess Circe, who has turned [[Wonder Woman]] into a pig, Zatanna is apparently aware of Batman's true identity ("Bruce!...I haven't seen you for so long...") and knows him well enough to perceive his romantic relationship to Wonder Woman (whose secret identity she also knows). She seems to be very good friends with Batman, as they often banter ("Don't get snippy with me!") In her JLU depictions, her spells are often cast backwards, but almost equally often cast without words, or on one occasion, speaking normally.

DCAU writer [[Paul Dini]] wrote both of Zatanna's major appearances described above, and apparently likes the character quite a lot. In 1998, [[Alan Burnett]] told ''[[Wizard Magazine]]'' "Paul Dini wanted to use Zatanna because he’s secretly in love with her. It’s something we try not to talk about too much." Dini later married magician [[Misty Lee]].

In her last appearance in the DCAU, on the ''Justice League Unlimited'' series finale, ''Destroyer'', Zatanna appears in a non-speaking role as one of many League Members called to help fight the invading [[Apokolips|Apokoliptan]] forces. She transforms an entire flock of [[Parademons]] into doves, then transmutes them into explosive energy, and destroys several Apokoliptan battleships with them.

[[Image:ZatannaCM.jpg|thumb|right|Zatanna on ''[[Cartoon Monsoon]]'']]
Zatanna makes two appearances in the ''[[Gotham Girls]]'' flash animation episodes. In "A Little Night Magic", Zatanna walks home on her own after doing a magic show and has some adventures on the way: She turns a robber's gun into a snake, splits a truck in half when it almost runs her over, and turns some street thugs into toads after they take her hat. In "Hold the Tiger", Zatanna stops Catwoman from stealing the Cat's Eye Opals from a jewelry store. Zatanna doesn't arrest Catwoman but instead asks Catwoman for help in finding her [[white tiger]].

Two episodes of a ''[[Cartoon Monsoon]]'' contest entry feature Zatanna as a teenage hero who is a cross between ''[[Sabrina, the Teenage Witch]]'' and ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''. This saw her match wits with [[Klarion the Witch Boy]], and also featured her father (referred to only as "Zatara") as well as the new character of Zatanna's older, non-magic-wielding brother (named "Damon" in promotional literature, though his name was only mentioned once in the second episode).

===Film===
In 2005 screenwriter [[Hadley Davis]] (''[[Ice Princess]]'') announced that she had written an action-comedy featuring a teenaged version of Zatanna. Nothing further was ever heard about this project, and it is presumed to have been abandoned. <ref>http://www.comicbookmovie.com/news/articles/1796.asp</ref>

===Parodies/Homages===
Zatanna was spoofed in the ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'' episode "Just-Us League of Supertoons" as [[Fifi Le Fume]]'s alter-ego, Scentanna, the ''Mystical Maiden of Musk''.

Zatanna was also spoofed in the ''[[Fairly Oddparents]]'' episode, "The Masked Magician", where [[Timmy Turner]] had an alter-ego of the same name.

===Video games===
Zatanna is a playable character in the console videogame ''[[Justice League Heroes]]'', voiced by [[Kari Wahlgren]].
