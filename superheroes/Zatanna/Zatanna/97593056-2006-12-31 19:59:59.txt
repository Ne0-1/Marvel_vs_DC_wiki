'''Zatanna Zatara''' is a [[fictional]] [[Wizard (fantasy)|wizard]] and a [[superhero]]ine in the DC universe.  She is a longtime member of the [[Justice League]]. Created by writer [[Gardner Fox]] and artist [[Murphy Anderson]], Zatanna first appeared in ''[[Hawkman]]'' #4 (October-November 1964). Her last name is rarely mentioned; she is generally referred to simply as '''Zatanna''', while other supeheroes often refer to her as '''Zee''' or '''Z'''.

Zatanna is the daughter of [[magic (paranormal)|magician]] [[Zatara|John Zatara]] (who appears in [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] comic books) and Sindella, a member of the mystical “[[Homo Magi]]” race. 

Zatanna usually dresses in the garb of a female [[magic (illusion)|illusionist]], with tuxedo jacket, white vest and gloves, [[top hat]], [[leotard]] and [[fishnet]] stockings.  After becoming a full member of the Justice League, she appeared for some time in a more traditionally super-heroic red-and-blue spandex costume (possibly since fishnet stockings are also the trademark of the more well-known JLA member [[Black Canary]]), but has more recently returned to the tuxedo and fishnets, possibly in tribute to her late father's memory.

She has inherited her family's ability to cast powerful spells. Like her father, Zatanna does this by describing the desired effect in backwards speech (e.g., ''sdrawkcab hceeps'' or ''hceeps sdrawkcab''), similar to [[Rechtub klat]], the backwards slang of Australian butchers.  Though historically her spells are constructed with only the spelling reversed but with the words in the correct order (''Ym tfarcrevoh si lluf fo slee!''), some writers have been known to reverse both spelling and words (''Slee fo lluf si tfarcrevoh ym!'').  (Translation: My hovercraft is full of eels!)

Rarely a headlining character, Zatanna is a prominent consultant on paranormal matters for DC superheroes, and has been a longtime member of the Justice League.  (Her immense power worries some Leaguers, though she has always been featured as a superheroine and never as a supervillainess.)  She has been featured in the [[animated series]] ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' and the [[Flash animation]] series ''[[Gotham Girls]].''

==Character biography==
===Origins===
Zatanna made her living as a stage [[illusionist]] prior to discovering her magical abilities while investigating the disappearance of her father.  Zatanna's search for her father was the subject of the first major comic book [[fictional crossover|crossover]] in 1964, and in it, Zatanna interacts with [[Batman]], [[Hawkman]] and [[Hawkwoman]], and [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]].

===Justice League member===
Zatanna assisted the Justice League of America on a number of cases before being elected to membership in ''Justice League of America'' #161.  During her tenure with the group, her power level diminished briefly, so that she could only control the four elements of [[Empedocles]] (earth, air, fire, and water); this limitation was reversed in ''World's Finest Comics'' #277.  

===Come Together===
In the 1993 [[limited series]] ''Zatanna: Come Together'', Zatanna is worried about her lack of focus in using her  magic. She decides that her father's style of magic is wrong for her, and explores her mother's mystical heritage.

===Identity Crisis===
[[Image:Identitycrisis2.PNG|Zatanna and the other JLA members responsible for the mindwiping of Dr. Light. Cover art for ''Identity Crisis'' #2, by Michael Turner.|thumb]]
The 2004 limited series ''[[Identity Crisis (comics)|Identity Crisis]]'' reveals that while Zatanna was a member of the Justice League, the villain [[Doctor Light (DC Comics supervillain)|Dr. Light]] brutally [[rape|raped]] the [[Elongated Man]]'s wife [[Sue Dibny]] and, when captured, went so far as to threaten the other JLA members' family members as well. The JLAers present voted to have Zatanna erase Light's memory of the rape as she had erased the memories of other villains in the past; however, it was also agreed that she should tamper with Light's mind so that he wouldn't pose a threat to their loved ones. Zatanna used her magic on Light, accidentally lowering his intellect as a result.  In the midst of this spell, Batman appeared and tried to stop the group; consequently, Zatanna erased [[Batman]]'s memories of the event as well. 

Batman and Zatanna's relationship does not improve after he finds out about the alteration to his memory. When Zatanna helps Batman with reconnaissance at a [[Lazarus Pit]], she asks him why he came to her. "I needed someone I can trust," Batman says. "I had to settle for you." By ''Detective Comics'' #824, however, their relationship appears to have warmed; calling Zatanna for information on a card-counter involved in scamming the Penguin, Batman makes no mention of this incident and refers to her with the informal 'Zee'.

After departing from the team, Zatanna regains her full power and continues her stage career with the additional calling as a [[Sentinels of Magic|sentinel against mystical threats]].

===Catwoman===
Zatanna's mind-wipe of Dr. Light in ''Identity Crisis'' was not an isolated occurrence.  Selina Kyle ([[Catwoman]]) learns to her dismay that her journey from villain to hero, and the steps she has recently taken to lead a moral life, were in fact the result of Zatanna's mental intervention. Selina comes to distrust her memories, motives, and the choices she has made since that incident.  Zatanna appears in several issues of ''Catwoman'' and, at Selina's behest, mind-wipes Film Freak and Angle Man, two villains who had deduced Catwoman's secret identity.

===Seven Soldiers===
[[Image:Zatanna7s.jpg|thumb|left|125px|''Zatanna'' #1]]
A 2005 four-issue ''Zatanna'' limited series was published as part of [[Grant Morrison]]'s ''[[Seven Soldiers of Victory]]'' event. ''Zatanna'' reveals that the reaction of her peers to the mindwipes, as well as the inadvertent deaths of several people in a failed magic ritual she conducted, were so extreme that she lost her self-confidence and magical abilities. With the help of her new apprentice [[Sheeda#Sheeda Characters|Misty Kilgore]] and the news of an impending apocalyptic battle, she regains her powers. Her continued solicited appearances imply that she will be one of the Seven Soldiers to survive. Zatanna's costume in this series is more overtly sexual than that worn elsewhere, consisting of a bustier, garter belt and nylons.

===Vertigo===
Zatanna also appears in DC's [[Vertigo (comics)|Vertigo]] imprint.  She appears several times in ''[[The Books of Magic]]'', typically to counsel Timothy Hunter, the main character. In ''[[Hellblazer]]'' she was the [[Tantric Buddhism|tantric]] partner of [[John Constantine]] at one point in the past.  She was one of the guests at Constantine's 1999/2000 [[New Year's Eve]] party in [[Tom Peyer]]'s ''[[Totems]]''.

An alternate version of Zatanna with blonde hair is seen in ''[[Books of Magick: Life During Wartime]]''. In the series, Zatanna fights for a coalition of human and faeries against the dictatorial class of faerie ruling elite.

==Possible relatives==
In addition to John Zatara and Sindella, it is implied that Zatanna was a direct relative of the artist [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (who was secretly a magician in the [[DC universe]]); [[Nostradamus]];  [[Alessandro Cagliostro]]; [[Alchemy|alchemists]] [[Nicholas Flamel]] and [[Fulcanelli|Evan Fulcanelli]]; and [[Arion (comics)|King Arion of Atlantis]]. She also has a younger cousin, the teenage magician [[Zachary Zatara]].

==Depictions in other media==
===Animation===
[[Image:Zatanna.JPG|thumb|left|Zatanna, as depicted in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'']]
Zatanna first appears in a ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' [[Zatanna (Batman: The Animated Series)|episode]] (voiced by [[Julie Brown]]) as an illusionist with no apparent magic powers. She developed a close relationship with [[Bruce Wayne]] during the years in which Wayne was travelling the globe, learning skills that later serve him as Batman. Wayne came to [[Zatara]] as "John Smith" to learn to be an escape artist but also found his young daughter to be growing attracted to him. Zatanna later comes to [[Gotham City|Gotham]] with her magic show, but finds herself being framed by a criminal magic debunker. Her efforts to restore her name and stop the villain put her side-by-side with the Batman, whom she recognizes as John Smith.

Further [[DC Animated Universe]] depictions, both on online [[Flash animation]] shorts and ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' (voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]]) episodes, show her with real magical abilities. In ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', Zatanna is aware of Batman's secret identity (she greets him with "Bruce!...I haven't seen for so long...") and knows that he has romantic feelings for [[Wonder Woman]] (she tells him, "No, ''you and I'' are just good friends. There's something more between you and Diana"). Her costume pretty much resembles that of the comics. However, like [[Black Canary]], the signature fishnet stockings were eschewed as it was difficult to animate them using computer graphics. A member of the expanded Justice League team, her most prominent ''JLU'' episode is "This Little Piggy", in which she helps Batman recover Wonder Woman after the latter is turned into a pig by [[Circe (comics)|Circe]]. The episode culminates with Batman singing "[[Am I Blue?]]" as Circe and Zatanna swoon over his rich singing voice. The original ending of ''This Little Piggy'' reveals that Zatanna lost no time in gossiping with her fellow Leaguers: she shows them images in her crystal ball of Batman singing[http://jl.toonzone.net/episode31/episode31.htm]. In the revised ending, Wonder Woman teases Batman by starting to hum "Am I Blue?", leaving viewers to speculate as to whether Zatanna had told her about it.

[[DCAU]] writer [[Paul Dini]] wrote both of Zatanna's major appearances described above, and apparently likes the character quite a lot. (In 1998, Alan Burnett told [[Wizard Magazine]]: "Paul Dini wanted to use Zatanna because he’s secretly in love with her. It’s something we try not to talk about too much.") Dini later married magician [[Misty Lee]].

[[Image:ZatannaCM.jpg|thumb|right|Zatanna on ''[[Cartoon Monsoon]]'']]
Zatanna makes two appearances in the ''[[Gotham Girls]]'' flash animation episodes. In "A Little Night Magic", Zatanna walks home on her own after doing a magic show and has some adventures on the way: She turns a robber's gun into a snake, splits a truck in half when it almost runs her over, and turns some street thugs into toads after they take her hat. In "Hold the Tiger", Zatanna stops [[Catwoman]] from stealing the Cat's Eye Opals from a jewelry store. Zatanna doesn't arrest Catwoman but instead asks Catwoman for help in finding her [[white tiger]].

Two episodes of a ''[[Cartoon Monsoon]]'' contest entry feature Zatanna as a teenage hero who is a cross between ''[[Sabrina The Teenage Witch]]'' and ''[[Buffy The Vampire Slayer]]''.

===Parodies===
Zatanna was spoofed in the ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'' episode "Just-Us League of Supertoons" (a spoof of the Justice League of America) as [[Fifi Le Fume]]'s alter-ego, Scentanna, the ''Mystical Maiden of Musk''. Interestingly, Scentanna's costume bears a striking resemblance to Zatanna's costume for when she joined the Justice League.

Zatanna was also spoofed, [[transexual|transexually]], in the ''[[Fairly Oddparents]]'' episode, "The Masked Magician", where [[Timmy Turner]] had an alter-ego of the same name.

===Video Games===
Zatanna appears in the console videogame [[Justice League Heroes]], voiced by [[Kari Wahlgren]].
