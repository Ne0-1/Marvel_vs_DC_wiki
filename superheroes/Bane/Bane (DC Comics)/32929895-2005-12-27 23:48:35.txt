'''Bane''' is the [[DC Comics]] [[villain]] best known for breaking [[Batman]]'s back.

Bane first appeared in ''Batman: Vengeance of Bane #1'' (1993). The "Knightfall" story arc ran through ''Batman'' #491-500, ''Detective Comics'' #659-666, and ''Showcase'' '93 #7-8, with tie-ins appearing in several other titles published during that time.

Bane possesses peak human strength, enhanced by his use of the drug "Venom." He is also quite intelligent (having deduced Batman's [[secret identity]]) and devious (he crafted the escape from [[Arkham Asylum]] of all of Batman's enemies).

==History==
Born to serve the [[life sentence]] of his father, Bane's childhood and early adult life were spent behind the walls of Peña Duro, an infamous prison located in Santa Prisca (claimed to be Cuba in Batman: The Animated Series). There, he read as many books as he could get his hands on, and built up his body in the prison's [[gymnasium]]. He committed his first murder at the age of eight. He became a test subject for a mysterious drug known as Venom, which had killed its other subjects. It nearly killed him at first, but he survived and found its effects enhanced his physical strength.

{{spoiler}}
Years later, Bane escaped Peña Duro, along with several accomplices (his friends Trogg, Zombie and Bird). His ambitions turned to destroying Batman, whom he had heard tales of while serving his sentence. Bane was convinced that the demonic bat that haunted his dreams since childhood was a representation of the Batman.

Bane destroyed the walls of Arkham Asylum, allowing its deranged inmates to escape into [[Gotham City]], where Batman spent three months rounding them up, running himself to exhaustion, and then returned to [[Wayne Manor]], where Bane awaited him. He fought Batman, defeated him, and delivered the ''coup de grace'': he broke Batman's back and threw him to the streets of Gotham.

While Bane established himself as ruler of Gotham's criminal underworld, Bruce Wayne passed the mantle of Batman to Jean-Paul Valley ([[Azrael (comics)|Azrael]]). As Batman, Jean-Paul grew increasingly violent, allowing the villain known as Abattoir to fall to his death, and refused to recognize [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] as his partner. "AzBat" (as comics fans refer to him) fought and defeated Bane at the end of the "Knightfall" arc.

After Bruce Wayne recovered, he once again became Batman by winning the title back from Jean-Paul. Batman would finally get his rematch with Bane in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #701 where Batman was able to defeat Bane during the famous "Legacy" arc. Since then, whenever Batman (Bruce Wayne) and Bane square off in battle, their fights usually end in a draw.

==In other media==
While Bane is one of the more popular villains in the comic continuity, he hasn't enjoyed as much visibility on television or the silver screen.

Bane has appeared as a villain on ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' and its [[spinoff]]s (voiced by [[Henry Silva]] in all appearances but the [[direct-to-video]] ''[[Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman|Mystery of the Batwoman]]'', in which he was voiced by [[Hector Elizondo]]), but in those depictions never achieved what his comics counterpart could: the defeat of Batman. The producers were reluctant to utilize him (along with [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] in the ''[[Superman: The Animated Series|Superman Animated Series]]'') because they felt that their comics incarnations were both gimmick characters. This explains his singular appearance in ''Batman: TAS'' and his small role in ''[[Batman: Gotham Knights]]''.

Bane first appeared in ''Batman: The Animated Series'' as a muscular thug hired by the mobster [[Rupert Thorne]] to eliminate Batman, and in turn by Thorne's moll to eliminate Thorne afterward. He ends up fighting Batman onboard the boat (where Robin had been kidnapped and tied up), but before he can break his back as he did in the comics, Batman thrusts a crumpled [[batarang]] into the controls that inject Bane with Venom.  This causes a rapid and uncontrollable feed into Bane's body before Batman pulls out the tube, stopping a fatal overdose of the drug; this becomes a recurring theme in Bane's defeats when he does appear in the series.

Bane notably appeared in two episodes of the ''Batman/Superman Adventures''. In the first one, ''Knight Time'', Bruce Wayne had been [[brainwashing|brainwashed]] by [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]] and in order to find him, Robin enlisted the help of [[Superman]].  To prevent anyone from determining Batman's secret identity by seeing the connection between the simultaneous disappearance of Bruce Wayne and Batman, Robin had Superman dress in Batman's suit and impersonate his voice. During the episode, they ambushed a meeting between Bane, [[Mad Hatter (comics)|Mad Hatter]], and [[The Riddler]], and Bane was quite surprised when "Batman" easily overpowered him. The second one, ''Over the Edge'', chronicled a dream story in which Batgirl was killed by the [[Scarecrow (comics)|Scarecrow]] and Commissioner Gordon lashes out at Batman in grief, starting a war between the vigilante and the police. Gordon even goes to the lengths of contracting Bane to take Batman down. Bane, consummate criminal that he is, ends up deciding to restructure the deal once he's free, preferring to kill the Batman rather than capture him.

In ''[[Batman Beyond]]'', the effects of Venom appear to have taken their toll. By this time, Bane has become wheelchair-bound and almost in a vegetative stupor, needing the Venom which has ravaged his body just to stay alive.

In the 1997 movie ''[[Batman and Robin (1997 movie)|Batman and Robin]]'', Bane was played by the late wrestler [[Jeep Swenson]] (1957-1997). He was again a convict from a prison, but this time he was turned into Bane by a [[mad scientist]] who injected him with Venom.  Rather than being the devious, intelligent villain of the comics, he was a mindless thug who served as the [[sidekick]] of [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], one of the main villains of the film. His defeat came when his Venom tube was pulled out of his head. This depiction of the character was one of many aspects of the film which received harsh criticism from fans and critics alike, with many fans wondering why Bane was even included in the story at all, as they think that the character serves little purpose in the film.

In ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', a newer animated series, Bane also appeared as a hitman and professional thief. In this rendition, he was even more monstrous in size and, to defeat him, Batman had to utilize a prototype [[robot]] called the "Bat-Bot".

In the video game called ''Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu'', Bane appears in the [[Batcave]], and battles Batman.
