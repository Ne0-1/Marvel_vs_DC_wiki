'''Bane''' is a [[fictional character]], associated with [[DC Comics]]' [[Batman]]. Created by writers [[Chuck Dixon]] and [[Doug Moench]] and artist [[Graham Nolan]], he first appeared in ''Batman: Vengeance of Bane #1'' ([[1993#January|January 1993]]). 

==Character overview==
Originally intended as a "dark mirror" of the highly disciplined and multi-skilled [[pulp magazines|pulp]] hero, [[Doc Savage]]<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/liveonline/03/regular/style/comics/r_style_comics051603.htm Washington Post May 2003 interview with Graham Nolan. "Actually, Chuck Dixon came up the idea for an evil 'Doc Savage' and I designed the character. "]</ref>, Bane not only survives but is mentally and physically strengthened by a childhood in a hellish prison on the corrupt [[island nation]] of [[Santa Prisca (DC Comics)|Santa Prisca]]. He develops [[superhuman]] strength through a forced experiment involving the drug [[List of comic book drugs#Venom|Venom]]. Although his dependency on Venom is an immense weakness, Bane has been one of Batman's most intelligent and physically powerful foes. He is best known for breaking Batman's  back in the "[[KnightSaga#Knightfall|Knightfall]]" story arc.

Although primarily a [[supervillain|villain]], Bane is a complex character and has worked to take down drug lords. Despite their history, he’s sometimes had Batman's financial backing and direct assistance.

Bane has appeared in some other media adaptations of Batman, including ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]],'' its sequels and spin-offs and its successor ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]].'' [[Professional wrestling|Pro-wrestler]] [[Robert Swenson|Jeep Swenson]] played him in the [[1997 in film|1997]] film ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]].'' In most of these adaptations, he is more simplistic and thug-like than his [[comic book]] counterpart.

==Publication history==
[[Chuck Dixon]], [[Doug Moench]], and [[Graham Nolan]] created the character for the [[Batman: Knightfall|Knightfall]] storyline, although it is unclear what elements were introduced by each of the two writers (Dixon and Moench). Dixon wrote the character's first appearance (''Vengeance of Bane''), with art by Graham Nolan. It is also unclear how much input was provided by [[Dennis O'Neil|Denny O'Neil]] (veteran writer of the Batman books, then Group Editor for the Batman family of books, and author of the novel adaption of ''Knightfall'').  O'Neil had previously created Bane's hellish birthplace of Santa Prisca in [[Question (comics)|The Question]] and the drug [[List of comic book drugs#Venom|Venom]] in the storyline of the same name (published in the pages of Legends of the Dark Knight #16-20, and later reprinted as a graphic novel).  In the pages of ''[[Azrael (comics)|Azrael]]'', O'Neil introduced Bane's perception of Venom as both an [[addiction]] and the weakness responsible for his earlier defeats. The link between Bane and King Snake was introduced by writer Scott Beatty.

==Fictional character biography==
===Background===
The origin of Bane has simmilarities with another fictional character, the [[Alexandre Dumas]]'s [[Count of Monte Cristo]]. Born to serve the [[Life imprisonment|life sentence]] of his father, Bane's childhood and early adult life are spent behind the walls of [[Peña Duro]], an infamous prison located in [[Santa Prisca (DC Comics)|Santa Prisca]]. Though imprisoned, his natural abilities allow him to develop extraordinary skills within the prison's walls. He reads as many books as he can get his hands on, builds up his body in the prison's [[gymnasium]], and learns to fight in the merciless school of prison life. Despite his circumstances, he appears to have found teachers of various sorts during his incarceration, ranging from hardened convicts to an elderly [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priest, under whose tutelage he apparently receives a classical education. Bane murders this priest upon his return to Santa Prisca years later. However, he commits his first murder at the age of eight, stabbing a criminal who wanted to use him to gain information about the prison.

During his years in prison, Bane carries a teddy bear he calls Osito ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "little bear"), whom he considers his only friend. It is revealed that Osito has a hole in his back to hold a knife that Bane uses against anyone who [[bullying|bullies]] him (this is spoofed in Italian superhero parody [[Rat-Man (comics)|Rat-Man]] by [[Leo Ortolani]] where the titular bumbling and goofy superhero has constant and heated discussions with a stuffed teddy called Piccettino, whose voice only he can hear). 

Bane ultimately establishes himself as the "king" of [[Peña Duro]] prison. The prison's controllers take note and, eventually, force him to become a test subject for a mysterious drug known as Venom, which had killed all other subjects. It nearly kills him at first, but he survives and finds its effects enhance his physical strength, although he needs to take it every 12 hours (via a system of cables pumped directly into his brain) or he would suffer debilitating [[Adverse drug reaction|side-effect]]s.

===The Man who broke the Bat===
[[Image:Bane-breaks-Batman-497pg21.png|thumb|Bane breaks [[Batman]]'s back in a [[Comics vocabulary#Splash page|splash page]] from ''Batman'' #497 (July 1993). Art by [[Jim Aparo]].]]
Years later, Bane escapes Peña Duro, along with several accomplices (his friends Trogg, Zombie and Bird, all of whom are named after 1960s rock bands: [[The Troggs]], [[The Zombies]], and [[The Birds (band)|The Byrds]], and were designed to mimic three of Doc Savage's assistants [[Andrew Blodgett Mayfair|Monk]], [[Theodore Marley Brooks|Ham]], and [[John Renwick|Renny]]). His ambition turns to destroying Batman, whom he had heard tales of while serving his sentence. He is fascinated with [[Gotham City]] as, like the prison, it is a place where fear ruled: in this case, fear of Batman. Bane is convinced that the demonic bat that haunted his dreams since childhood is a representation of the Batman.

Aware that a direct assault on Batman would be foolish, Bane destroys the walls of [[Arkham Asylum]], allowing its deranged inmates to escape into Gotham City, where Batman spends three months rounding them up. Running himself to exhaustion, Batman returns to [[Wayne Manor]], where Bane awaits him. He fights Batman in the [[Batcave]], defeats him, and delivers the ''[[coup de grâce]]'': he breaks Batman's back and leaves him paraplegic, thereby having been the only man to have "Broken the Bat".

====Downfall====
While Bane establishes himself as ruler of Gotham's criminal underworld, Bruce Wayne passes the mantle of Batman to Jean-Paul Valley, also known as [[Azrael (comics)|Azrael]]. As Batman, Jean-Paul grows increasingly violent, allowing the villain [[Abattoir (comics)|Abattoir]] to fall to his death. Jean-Paul also refuses to recognize [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Robin]] as his partner. Utilizing a sophisticated combat suit in place of the traditional Batman uniform, he fights and defeats Bane at the end of the "Knightfall" arc, severing the tubes that pump the Venom into Bane's bloodstream, causing severe withdrawal. Valley then gives the weakened Bane a vicious beating, leaving him alive but broken.

=== Legacy ===
Following the events of "Knightfall", Bane recovers from his Venom addiction while serving time in prison, as seen in ''Vengeance of Bane II: The Redemption'' (1995).  He eventually escapes from prison and returns to Gotham, where he fights alongside Batman to take out a criminal ring that is distributing a Venom derivative to street-level thugs.  Following a victory over the criminals, Bane proclaims that he is "innocent" of his past crimes and urges Batman to stop hunting him.  He then leaves Gotham (without fighting Batman) to begin a search for his father.

Bane's search brings him back to Santa Prisca (shown in the ''Bane of the Demon'' miniseries published in 1998).  In search of leads, Bane questions the Jesuit priest who had taught him while he was in Peña Duro.  The priest explains that there were four men who could possibly have been his father: a Santa Priscan [[revolutionary]], an [[United States|American]] doctor, an [[English people|English]] [[mercenary]], and a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] banker.  While searching for the Swiss in [[Rome]], Bane encounters [[Ra's al Ghul]]'s daughter [[Talia al Ghul|Talia]].  Talia introduces Bane to her father, and eventually Bane impresses Ra's so much that he chooses Bane as his heir (an "honor" he had previously imparted on Batman).

Ra's al Ghul and Bane then launch a [[plague]] attack on Gotham in the "Legacy" storyline.  Bruce Wayne, again costumed as Batman, gets his rematch with Bane in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #701 (September 1996) and finally defeats him in single combat. Since then, whenever Batman and Bane square off in battle, their fights usually end in a draw. 

Following the "Legacy" storyline, Bane appears in a one-shot publication called ''Batman: Bane'' (1997) and fights Azrael in the "Angel and the Bane" storyline in "Azrael" #36-40 (December 1997 - April 1998).  He then surfaces in the story arc "[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]", serving as an enforcer for [[Lex Luthor]].  Following a fallout with Ra's al Ghul, Bane later embarks on a campaign to destroy [[Lazarus Pit]]s around the world, and in the process, encounters [[Black Canary]] in ''[[Birds of Prey (comic)|Birds of Prey]]'' #26 (February 2001).

===Veritas Liberat===
According to the Jesuit priest that Bane speaks with in "Bane of the Demon" #1, there is a possibility that Bane's biological father is an American doctor.  In researching this issue, Bane comes to the conclusion that he and Batman share Dr. [[Thomas Wayne]] as their biological father, with Dr. Wayne having apparently become close to Bane's mother during his time in Santa Prisca.  Bane alerts Batman to this possibility, and during the time that the [[DNA]] tests are being performed, stays at [[Wayne Manor]] and fights alongside Batman on the streets of Gotham in the "Tabula Rasa" storyline (''[[Gotham Knights]]'' #33-36, November 2002 - February 2003).  Ultimately, it is revealed that Dr. Wayne is not Bane's father, and Bane leaves Gotham peacefully (and with Batman's blessing and financial backing) to pursue leads in the snowy mountains of [[Kanchenjunga]].

Bane eventually finds his father, the unscrupulous [[King Snake]], in the "Veritas Liberat" storyline (''Gotham Knights'' #47-49, January - March 2004).  Bane, with Batman looking on, helps foil King Snake's plans to unleash a powerful weapon upon the world. Bane saves Batman from being shot by King Snake, but is mortally wounded in the process.  Batman then saves Bane by bathing him in a [[Lazarus Pit]], and leaves him with a clean slate and a new opportunity at life.

=== ''Infinite Crisis'' & ''One Year Later'' ===
In ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #7, Bane is shown fighting alongside the villains during the [[Battle of Metropolis]].  During the battle, he breaks the back of the hero [[Judomaster]], killing him. No reason was given for his actions in #7, though in ''Infinite Crisis'''s collected edition, one of the many changes made to the original series was Bane saying "I finally know who I am. I am ''Bane''. I ''break'' people." while breaking Judomaster's back. 

Bane resurfaces in the [[One Year Later]] continuity in ''JSA Classified'' #17-18 searching for the [[Hourman|Hourmen]] (Rex and Rick Tyler), asking them for help. To win their trust, he tells them how, prior to the Battle of Metropolis, he returned to his homeland to put an end to the drug lords' government, in the process discovering that a new, more addicting strain of Venom had been created.  In his furious carelessness to wipe out the drug trade, he was captured, and reimplanted with the cranial tubes, hooked to the new Venom, but now unable to shake off his addiction without dying from the withdrawal.  Bane was forced to work as an enforcer for the drug cartel, unable to escape.  Believing that Bane sought Rex Tyler's expertise in [[chemistry]], Rick lets him approach his father, only to discover that the story is a ruse.  Bane, who had never truly been addicted to Venom, had in fact wiped out the drug lords, and destroyed every research note on Venom. He discovered in the process both strains of Venom derived from Rex Tyler's early research on Miraclo.  He discovers from the Tylers that no written notes exist of Rex's work, captures Rex and steals Rick's equipment, planning to kill Rex and force Rick to take the last of the new Venom, living forever as an addict. Rick and Rex eventually subdue Bane, burying the mercenary in the rubble of the very same Santa Priscan [[prison|penitentiary]] where his story began.

Eventually Bane resurfaces in Santa Prisca, leading the country to [[democracy|democratic]] elections. Upon discovering that the elections were rigged by [[Rainbow Raiders|Computron]], he uses his influence to enforce [[martial law]], plunging the country into a [[civil war]]. Computron offers information to [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]] on who ordered him to rig the elections in exchange for their help in escaping the country. [[Fire (DC Comics)|Fire]] and Judomaster's son, [[Thomas Jagger]], are sent on the mission, with Jagger debating whether or not to seek revenge for his father's murder.  He fights Bane in order to allow Fire to escape, defeating him easily, but chooses not to kill him.

As appearing in [[Outsiders (comics)|''Outsiders'']] #50, Bane has joined the [[Suicide Squad]].

In ''[[Salvation Run]]'' #2, Bane was tricked by his fellow squad members, and sent to the prison planet.

==Powers and abilities==
Bane possesses [[Olympic Games|Olympic]]-level strength that appears to be greater than Batman's.  During the ''Knightfall'' storyline, when he uses the "[[List of comic book drugs#Venom|Venom]]" drug, his strength level is artificially increased to superhuman levels. Even without Venom, his [[physiology]] appears superior to other normal human characters with strength such as Batman.

Bane is also highly intelligent; in "''Bane of the Demon''", Ra's al Ghul says that Bane "has a mind equal to the greatest he has known". In prison he teaches himself various scientific disciplines equal to the level of understanding of leading experts in those fields. He teaches himself six active languages and at least two additional arcane and [[dead language|dead ones]]. The "Bane of the Demon" storyline reveals that he has a [[Eidetic memory|photographic memory]]. Within one year he is able to deduce Batman's [[secret identity]]. He is also highly devious (he crafts the escape from Arkham Asylum of all of Batman's enemies), and a superb strategist and tactician. In prison, Bane also invents his own form of [[calisthenics]], [[meditation]], and a unique fighting style.

==In other media==
===Batman: The Animated Series===
{{main|Batman: The Animated Series}}
[[Image:Bane tnb.gif|right|frame|thumb|Bane from ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]''.]]
Bane has appeared as a villain on ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' and its [[spin-off]]s (voiced by [[Henry Silva]] in all appearances but the [[direct-to-video]] ''[[Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman|Mystery of the Batwoman]]'', in which he was voiced by [[Hector Elizondo]]). In these depictions, Bane never achieves what his comics counterpart does: the defeat of Batman. The producers were reluctant to utilize him (along with [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] in the ''[[Superman: The Animated Series|Superman Animated Series]]'') because they felt that their comics incarnations were both too [[gimmick]]y. {{Fact|date=July 2007}}

Bane [[Bane (The Adventures of Batman & Robin)|first appears]] in ''Batman: The Animated Series'' as a muscular assassin hired by the mobster [[Rupert Thorne]] to eliminate Batman, and in turn by Thorne's [[moll]] to eliminate Thorne afterward. Bane fights Batman onboard the boat where [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] is kidnapped and bound, and nearly defeats him; before Bane can break Batman's back, however, Batman thrusts a crumpled [[batarang]] into the controls that inject Bane with Venom. This causes a rapid and uncontrollable feed into Bane's body before Batman pulls out the tube, stopping a fatal [[overdose]] of the drug, but leaving him thoroughly beaten.

Bane appears in two episodes of ''[[The New Batman/Superman Adventures]]''. In the first one, "Knight Time", Bruce Wayne is [[brainwashing|brainwashed]] by [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]], and in order to find him, Robin teams up with [[Superman]]. To prevent anyone from determining Batman's secret identity by seeing the connection between the simultaneous disappearance of Bruce Wayne and Batman, Superman dresses in Batman's suit and impersonates his voice. During the episode, they ambush a meeting between Bane, [[Mad Hatter (comics)|Mad Hatter]], and [[Riddler|The Riddler]]. Bane attacks "Batman", shocked and surprised that he can't hurt him at all.  Superman smiles and beats him into unconsciousness.

The second episode, "[[Over the Edge (The New Batman Adventures)|Over the Edge]]", chronicles a dream story in which [[Barbara Gordon|Batgirl]] is killed by the [[Scarecrow (comics)|Scarecrow]]. Barbara's father, [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner James Gordon]], lashes out at Batman in grief, starting a war between the [[vigilante]] and the police. Gordon even goes to the lengths of contracting Bane to capture Batman. Bane restructures the deal once he is freed, preferring to kill Batman rather than capture him. After a long, brutal fight, Bane dies when Batman electrocutes him by tying his Venom tube to a broken [[Bat-Signal]] - but with his last ounce of strength, he rolls it at both Batman and Gordon, knocking them both off the building before Batgirl wakes up. 

Bane later appears in the animated movie ''[[Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman|Mystery of the Batwoman]]'' in which [[Penguin (comics)|The Penguin]] hires him as an enforcer during an [[weapon|arms]] deal. Although Rupert Thorne appears as one of Penguin's partners in this movie, there is no reference to their previous meeting. At the end of the movie, Bane falls to his apparent death into a pit of fire after a fight with Batman, although his appearance in ''[[Batman Beyond]]'' makes it clear that he survived the fall.

===Batman Beyond===
{{main|Batman Beyond}}
Bane reappears in the ''[[Batman Beyond]]'' episode "The Winning Edge", which is set 40 years later. The effects of long-term Venom use appear to have taken their toll; his body and mind ravaged, he sits in a vegetative stupor with only constant injections of the drug keeping him alive. Bane's caretaker sells Venom as a [[doping (sport)|performance enhancer]]/[[recreational drug use|recreational drug]] used by teenagers in the form of patches known as "slappers." The caretaker later enters a catatonic state from an overdose of Venom during a fight with [[Terry McGinnis]], Bruce Wayne's successor as Batman. McGinnis hits a box of the slappers, which fall on the caretaker and sticks to his body, pumping him with even greater amounts until he collapses.

===Batman and Robin (1997)===
{{main|Batman & Robin (film)}}
[[Image:RobertSwenson-Bane.JPG|right|thumb|300px|Bane, as he appeared in ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman and Robin]]''.]]
In the 1997 movie ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman and Robin]]'', Bane was portrayed by wrestler [[Robert Swenson|Jeep Swenson]]. Unlike his comics counterpart, this incarnation has a real name, Antonio Diego. He is again a convict, but this time he is turned into Bane by [[Floronic Man|Dr. Jason Woodrue]], who pumps his body with a recipe of steroids and venom, by drilling three holes into Antonio's skull, and interconnecting them with hoses, feeding into a leather mask. At the climax of the scene, Antonio can be heard screaming loudly through the mask, as he begins to change and grows into his sagging costume, and becomes what Woodrow names as Bane.

Rather than being the devious, intelligent villain of the comics, this version is an inarticulate thug who serves as the [[lackey (manservant)|lackey]] of [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], one of the main villains of the film. Bane is barely even capable of speech and uses growls, roars, and snarls for most of his communication. He retains the comics version's inhuman strength, easily beating up several thugs, policemen and even holding his own against Batman and Robin in hand-to-hand combat.

In the film's [[climax (narrative)|climax]], Robin and [[Batgirl]] kick out Bane's venom tube as their monstrous assailant attempts to strangle them. As the Venom leaves his body, he shrinks back to his original size. Like the two other main villains in the film, he does not die.

This depiction of the character was one of many aspects of the film which received harsh criticism from fans and critics alike.

===''The Batman''===
{{main|The Batman (TV series)}}
[[Image:Bane TB Traction.jpg|left|200px|thumb|'''Bane''' towering over [[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]].]]
In ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', Bane appears as a [[hitman]] and professional thief voiced by [[Joaquim de Almeida]] ("Traction") and [[Ron Perlman]] ("Team Penguin"). In this rendition, he is even more monstrous in size and strength, and injures Batman in the first encounter. To defeat him, Batman uses the Bat-Bot, a [[prototype]] [[robot]].

Bane's [[steroid]] injection unit is a system of tubes which stretch around his body, activated by a dial on his hand. However, the steroid venom and his tubing system is perhaps a weakness, since on several occasions he is defeated when they are electrocuted. In the episode "Traction", Batman rams an exposed electrical wire into Bane's Venom applier. After the resulting electrocution, Bane collapses under the strain. In "Team Penguin", Batman's electrocution of his tubes causes a chain reaction which shocks him senseless. He later gets an invitation to join this version's [[Injustice Gang]], but is taken down by Batman and Robin before considering the offer.

He later made minor appearances in the fourth season of the show, in the episodes ''Rumors'' and ''The Joining, Part 2.''

===Video games===
Bane's first [[video game]] appearance is in the video game adaptation of ''Batman and Robin''. Bane also appears in ''[[Batman: Chaos in Gotham]]'' and ''[[Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu]]''. In the latter game, Bane appears in the Batcave and battles Batman. ''Rise of Sin Tzu'' also features Hector Elizondo's first time voicing Bane, as it was released a month before ''Mystery of the Batwoman''. Also in ''Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu'', Bane may do a similar move to the hero that he did when he broke Batman's back.

===Toys===
Kenner released different versions of Bane for each of its ''Batman The Animated Series'', ''Batman & Robin The Movie'', and ''Legends Of The Dark Knight'' action figure lines.

D.C. Direct has released two Bane figures.  One as the character appeared in the ''Batman'' "Knightfall" comic series as well as in the "Secret Files & Origins" series. Each came packaged with a figure stand specific to that particular series, with no other accessories. 

Mattel has included two versions of Bane in their D.C. Superheroes line of action figures.  Both versions share the same mold and only vary in paint applications.  The first version is set apart by black pants while the second (2007) version has pants decorated with a camouflage pattern.  Both versions of this figure came with a small "Osito" accessory, although many of the first version seem to have been shipped to stores without.

In 2007, LEGO released a Bane mini-figure in a Bat-Tank building set, alongside a Riddler mini-figure.
