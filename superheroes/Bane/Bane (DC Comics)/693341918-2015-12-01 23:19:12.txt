'''Bane''' is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]], commonly as an adversary of the [[superhero]] [[Batman]].  The character's origin was in ''Batman: Vengeance of Bane'' #1 (January 1993), and was created by [[Chuck Dixon]], [[Doug Moench]], and [[Graham Nolan]].

Known for his mix of brute strength and exceptional intelligence, the character is often credited as being the only villain to have "Broken the Bat", making him one of Batman's most physically and intellectually powerful foes. [[IGN]]'s list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time ranked Bane as #34.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/34.html |title=Bane is Number 34 |publisher=Comics.ign.com |accessdate=December 29, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101213183349/http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/34.html| archivedate= 13 December 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Bane was portrayed by [[Robert Swenson]] in the [[1997 in film|1997 film]] ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'', and by [[Tom Hardy]] as the main antagonist in the [[2012 in film|2012 film]] ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]''.

==Publication history==
[[File:Bane (concept art).jpg|thumb|left|250px|Bane, concept art by [[Graham Nolan]].]]
[[Chuck Dixon]], [[Graham Nolan]], and [[Doug Moench]] created the character for the ''[[Batman: Knightfall|Knightfall]]'' storyline, although it is unsure what elements were introduced by each of the two writers (Dixon and Moench). Dixon wrote the character's first appearance (''Vengeance of Bane''),<ref name="UGO - Bane">{{cite web|url=http://batman.ugo.com/roguesgallery/bane/default.asp|title=UGO's World of Batman - Rogues Gallery - Bane|accessdate=May 10, 2005|publisher=[[UGO]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205171225/http://batman.ugo.com/roguesgallery/bane/default.asp|archivedate=2008-02-05 }}{{dead link|date=December 2011}}</ref> with art by Graham Nolan. It is also unclear how much input was provided by [[Dennis O'Neil|Denny O'Neil]] (veteran writer of the ''Batman'' books, then Group Editor for the ''Batman'' family of books, and author of the novel adaptation of ''Knightfall''). O'Neil had previously created Bane's hellish birthplace of Santa Prisca in ''[[Question (comics)|The Question]]'' and the drug [[Venom (DC Comics)|Venom]] in the storyline of the same name (published in the pages of ''Legends of the Dark Knight'' #16-20, and later reprinted as a trade paperback).<ref name="UGO - Bane"/><ref name="WP - Bane">{{cite web|first=Suzanne|last=Tobin|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/liveonline/03/regular/style/comics/r_style_comics051603.htm|title=Comics: Meet the Artist|quote=Actually, Chuck Dixon came up the idea for an evil 'Doc Savage' and I designed the character|accessdate=May 10, 2008|date=May 16, 2003|work=Washington Post}}</ref> In the pages of ''[[Azrael (comics)|Azrael]]'', O'Neil introduced Bane's perception of Venom as both an [[Behavioral addiction|addiction]] and the weakness responsible for his earlier defeats.

==Fictional character biography==

==="Vengeance of Bane"===
Bane's origin story is established in the story "Knightfall". He was born in the fictional [[Santa Prisca (DC Comics)|Caribbean Republic of Santa Prisca]], in a prison called Peña Duro. His father, Edmund Dorrance (better known as [[King Snake]]), had been a revolutionary who had escaped Santa Prisca's court system. The corrupt government, however, decreed that his young son would serve out the man's life sentence, and thus Bane's childhood and early adult life were spent in the immoral penitentiary environment.<ref name="UGO - Bane"/><ref name="Broken"/>

Though he was imprisoned, his natural abilities allowed him to develop extraordinary skills within the prison's walls.  He read as many books as he could get his hands on, spent most of his spare time body building in the prison's [[gym]], and learned to fight in the merciless school of prison life.  Because of the cultural and supposed geographical location of Santa Prisca, Bane knew how to speak English, Spanish, Portuguese and Latin.  Despite his circumstances, he found teachers of various sorts during his incarceration, ranging from hardened convicts to an elderly [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priest, under whose tutelage he apparently received a [[Classical education movement|classical education]].  Bane murdered this priest upon his return to Santa Prisca years later.  He committed his first murder at the age of eight, stabbing a criminal who wanted to use him to gain information about the prison.<ref name="Broken"/>  During his years in prison, Bane carried a teddy bear he called Osito ("Little bear" in Spanish), whom he considered his only friend.<ref name="dc-ency"/>  It is revealed that Osito has a hole in his back to hold a knife that Bane used to defend himself.<ref>{{cite book| last = Greenberger| first = Robert| authorlink = Robert Greenberger| title = The Essential Batman Encyclopedia| publisher = [[Del Rey Books]] | year = 2008| pages = 16–17}}</ref>

Bane is tortured by a monstrous, terrifying bat creature that appears in his dreams, thus giving him [[Fear of bats|chiroptophobia]] (fear of bats). He ultimately established himself as the "king" of Peña Duro prison and became known as Bane.  The prison's controllers took note and eventually forced him to become a test subject for a mysterious drug known as [[Venom (DC Comics)|Venom]],<ref name="Broken"/> which had killed all other subjects; the drug was administered by a doctor who bore a passing resemblance to another Batman foe, [[Hugo Strange]].  Later, in ''Vengeance of Bane II'' the very same doctor encountered Bane again in [[Gotham City]] and it is confirmed that it is not Hugo Strange, who, at that point in Batman continuity, was a crazed psychologist and not a surgeon.<ref name="Broken"/>  The Peña Duro prison Venom experiment nearly killed Bane at first, but he survived and found that the drug vastly increases his physical strength, although he needs to take it every 12 hours (via a system of tubes pumped directly into his brain) or he will suffer debilitating [[Adverse drug reaction|side-effect]]s.<ref name="UGO - Bane"/><ref name="Broken"/>

During the ''[[Knightfall]]'' storyline, Bane escaped Peña Duro, along with several accomplices based on the [[Doc Savage#Doc Savage's aides|Fabulous Five]] (his minions Trogg, Zombie and Bird, all of whom are named after 1960s rock bands &mdash; [[The Troggs]], [[The Zombies]] and [[The Byrds]] &mdash; and were designed to mimic three of Doc Savage's assistants [[Andrew Blodgett Mayfair|Monk]], [[Theodore Marley Brooks|Ham]], and [[John Renwick|Renny]]).<ref name="UGO - Bane"/><ref name="Broken"/>  His ambition turned to destroying Batman, about whom he had heard stories from an inmate. Gotham fascinated Bane because, like Peña Duro, fear rules Gotham - but it is the fear of the Batman.  Bane was convinced that Batman was a personification of the demonic bat which had haunted his dreams since childhood.  Therefore, Bane believed fate placed Batman on a collision course with him.<ref name="UGO - Bane"/><ref name="Broken"/>

Aware that a direct assault on Batman would be foolish, Bane instead destroyed the walls of [[Arkham Asylum]]—allowing its deranged inmates (including the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]], [[Two-Face]], the [[Riddler]], the [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]], the [[Mad Hatter (comics)|Mad Hatter]], the [[Ventriloquist (comics)|Ventriloquist]], [[Firefly (DC Comics)|Firefly]], [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], [[Cornelius Stirk]], [[Film Freak]] and [[Victor Zsasz]]) to escape into Gotham City. Consequently, Batman was forced to recapture the escapees, a mission that took him three months. Exhausted, Batman returned to his home in the [[Batcave]] then went up to [[Wayne Manor]] as [[Bruce Wayne]], where he found Bane waiting for him (who had previously figured out his [[secret identity]]). Bane attacked Bruce, first in Wayne Manor but then the two tumbled down into the Batcave below, where Bane continued his assault on Bruce Wayne, toying with him throughout. Bane delivered the final blow by raising Bruce up and throwing him down upon his knee, breaking his back and he left him a [[paraplegic]]. Bane thus becomes the only man to have "Broken the Bat".<ref name="UGO - Bane"/><ref name="Broken"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://secretearths.blogspot.com/2011/09/bane-versus-batman.html |title=Bane vs Batman: Batman #497 |publisher=Secret Wars on Infinite Earths |accessdate=September 6, 2011}}</ref> This iconic moment is incorporated in ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'', [[Robot Chicken DC Comics Special|Robot Chicken's ''DC Comics Special'']] and alluded to numerous times in the [[DCAU]] cartoons.<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1690203/dark-knight-rises-ending-christian-bale.jhtml 'Dark Knight Rises' Star Christian Bale Breaks Down Batman's End]</ref><ref>[http://www.carrollconews.com/blogs/thrash/entry/48720 MOVIE REVIEW: "THE DARK KNIGHT RISES" beyond expectations]</ref><ref>http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/58757/has-colorado-incident-shot-down-caped-crusader-franchise</ref>

While Bane established himself as the new ruler of Gotham's criminal underworld, Bruce Wayne passed the mantle of Batman to Jean-Paul Valley, also known as [[Azrael (comics)|Azrael]]. As the "new" Batman, however, Jean-Paul grew increasingly violent and ruthless; he believed that the only way to defeat criminals is to go to their level. Valley also refused to recognize [[Tim Drake]]/Robin as his partner. Despite Bruce Wayne's strict orders that Valley avoid Bane, he disregarded those commands and boldly attempted to confront Bane in his home; with the villain then living in luxury high above Gotham in a penthouse suite. Valley had by then added a set of high-tech, heavy metal gauntlets to the Batsuit, and used them to shoot sharp projectiles at Bane. But Bane was able to get the upper hand in the fight after using Venom and taunting Valley, making him angry enough to rush him. Despite besting Valley, Bane sustained deep lacerations in the battle and lost a great deal of blood. Unable to go to a hospital, Bane increased his Venom intake to temporarily block the pain and buy himself time to defeat the new Batman. Humiliated, Valley returned to the Batcave where he built an advanced combat suit of metal, in place of the traditional Batsuit, with many chambers within the suit that fire razor-sharp weapons. Reduced to little more than a wounded animal fleeing for survival, Bane was no match against the "new" Batman and was overwhelmed by him. Bane was finally defeated when Valley severed the tubes that pump Venom into his bloodstream, causing severe [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]]. Commissioner [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]], [[Harvey Bullock (comics)|Harvey Bullock]], and the Tim Drake Robin watched in horror as this new Batman tortured a defeated Bane, who begs Valley to kill him. Valley denied his innate urge to kill Bane, however, and left him to be arrested.<ref name="UGO - Bane"/><ref name="Broken"/>

Bane became an Arkham Asylum inmate and plotted his escape and revenge on Batman and his allies. Jean-Paul Valley lost the mantle of the Bat whilst Bruce Wayne is fully recovered.

===Legacy===
Further following the events of ''Knightfall'', Bane recovers from his Venom addiction while serving time in Blackgate Prison, as seen in ''Vengeance of Bane II: The Redemption'' (1995).  He eventually escapes from prison and returns to Gotham, where he fights alongside Batman to take out a criminal ring that is distributing a Venom derivative to street-level thugs.  Following a victory over the criminals (and the revelation that behind it is the same doctor that performed the surgery on Bane years earlier in Peña Dura), Bane proclaims that he is "innocent" of his past crimes and urges Batman to stop hunting him.  He then leaves Gotham (without fighting Batman) to begin a search for his dead father.<ref>{{Cite comic

According to the Jesuit priest, with whom Bane speaks, there is a possibility that Bane's biological father is an American doctor.<ref name="Demon"/>  In researching this issue, Bane comes to the conclusion that he and Batman share Dr. [[Thomas Wayne]] as their biological father, with Dr. Wayne allegedly becoming close to Bane's mother during his time in Santa Prisca.  Bane alerts Batman to this possibility and during the time that the [[DNA]] tests are being performed, stays at [[Wayne Manor]] and fights alongside Batman on the streets of Gotham in the "Tabula Rasa" storyline.  Ultimately, it is revealed that Dr. Wayne is not Bane's father, and Bane leaves Gotham peacefully (and with Batman's blessing and financial backing) to pursue leads in the snowy mountains of [[Kangchenjunga]].<ref>{{Cite comic

===''Infinite Crisis'' & ''One Year Later''===
In ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #7, Bane fights alongside the villains during the Battle of Metropolis.  During the battle, he breaks the back of the hero [[Judomaster]], killing him.  No reason was given for his actions in #7, though in ''Infinite Crisis''' collected edition, one of the many changes made to the original series was Bane saying "I finally know who I am.  I am 'Bane'.  I 'break' people." while breaking Judomaster's back.<ref>{{cite web |first=Ray |last=Tate |url=http://www.comicsbulletin.com/reviews/11468883691605.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081206065518/http://www.comicsbulletin.com/reviews/11468883691605.htm |archivedate=December 6, 2008 |title=''Infinite Crisis'' #7 Review - Line of Fire Reviews|accessdate=May 22, 2008 |date=May 5, 2006 |publisher=[[Comics Bulletin]]}}</ref>

Bane resurfaces in the ''[[One Year Later]]'' continuity of ''JSA Classified'' #17-18 searching for the [[Hourman|Hourmen]] (Rex and Rick Tyler), asking them for help.  To win their trust, he tells them how, prior to the Battle of Metropolis, he returned to his homeland to put an end to the drug lords' government and in the process discovered that a new, more addictive strain of Venom had been created.  In his furious carelessness to wipe out the drug trade, he was captured, and re implanted with the cranial tubes, hooked to the new Venom, and now unable to shake off his addiction without dying from the withdrawal.  Bane was forced to work as an enforcer for the drug cartel, unable to escape.  Believing that Bane sought Rex Tyler's expertise in [[chemistry]], Rick lets him approach his father, only to discover that the story is a ruse.  Bane, who had never truly been addicted to Venom, had in fact wiped out the drug lords, and destroyed every research note on Venom.  He discovered in the process both strains of Venom derived from Rex Tyler's early research on Miraclo.  He discovers from the Tylers that no written notes exist of Rex' work, captures Rex, and steals Rick's equipment, planning to kill Rex and force Rick to take the last of the new Venom, living forever as an addict.  Rick manipulates Bane into using Miraclo and demolishing the building as he and his father escape, burying the mercenary in the rubble of the very same Santa Priscan penitentiary where his story began.<ref>{{Cite comic

''Superman/Batman'' #53-#56 reveals Bane is trading his Venom supplies with drug lords around the globe. One of his shipments includes a trip to Gotham. Batman, who was temporarily endowed with [[Superman]]'s powers, responded by attacking Bane at his home. Not only was the Dark Knight able to easily defeat the villain, the hero nearly killed him with his far superior strength. Bane survived his injuries due to the enhanced stamina from his Venom supplies.

===Secret Six===
Since September 2008, Bane has appeared as a regular character in the ongoing [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]] series. In the first issue, Bane is depicted as a [[Stoicism|stoic]] [[devil's advocate]] for the group, offering alternative points of view for both [[Deadshot]] and [[Catman (comics)|Catman]] on the subject of love.<ref>''Secret Six'' (vol. 3) #1 (November 2008)</ref> He is later shown to have an almost father like concern for [[Scandal (comics)|Scandal Savage]]'s well-being.<ref>''Secret Six'' (vol. 3) #3 (January 2009)</ref> Although this is largely played for laughs in the early issues, the first arc's final issue displays the depth of Bane's affection.  When the Six are attacked by an army of supervillains, a wounded (and seemingly dying) Bane's concern for Scandal results in temporarily breaking his vow to never take Venom again in order to save her.<ref>''Secret Six'' (vol. 3) #7 (May 2009)</ref> Bane is later shown to have recovered from his ordeal, appearing in Gotham City with Cat-Man and [[Rag Doll (Peter Merkel, Jr.)|Ragdoll]] in an attempt to stem some of the chaos caused by the apparent death of Batman. During the team's several escapades, Bane reveals both a deep respect for his onetime adversary and a painful yearning to assume the mantle of Batman, telling a trio of rescued citizens to tell people that it was the Batman who saved them.  Bane ultimately gives his blessing to [[Dick Grayson]], praying that "God help him."<ref>''Secret Six'' (vol. 3) #9 (July 2009)</ref> Following a near-disastrous mission, Bane assumes leadership over the Six.

The team kidnaps the [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]], who Bane pumps for information about Batman's partners.<ref>''Secret Six'' (vol. 3) #35 (September 2011)</ref> In the final issue of the series, Bane ultimately decides on [[Red Robin (Tim Drake)|Red Robin]], [[Azrael (comics)#Michael Lane|Azrael]] and [[Stephanie Brown (comics)|Batgirl]] as his victims. Before the Six can make their move, Penguin betrays their location, resulting in a massive army of superheroes ranging from [[Green Lantern (John Stewart)|Green Lantern]], Batman and the [[List of Superman supporting characters|Superman family]] to the [[Justice League]], [[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]], and [[Booster Gold]] converging on Gotham. The Secret Six stage a desperate last stand, but are quickly defeated. With the fates of the other Secret Six members left ambiguous, Bane is last shown being driven away in a Gotham police van.

Later, after Batman defeats Bane, a mysterious figure confronts the villain and informs him that the Court of Owls had undermined his plans. Bane returns to Santa Prisca to lead his army against them.

While there, he comes across where the Talons are stored hoping to make them in to his weapons.

With the help of Cobb, Bane is able to injure the Talons enough to activate their regenerative powers to remove the mind-control technology.<ref>''Forever Evil: Arkham War'' #5</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Bane is highly intelligent; in ''Bane of the Demon'', [[Ra's al Ghul]] says that Bane "has a mind equal to the greatest he has known" (although he dismisses Bane's intellect as the cunning of an animal rather than the cultured, trained intellect of Batman). His strength gives him more ways to go against Batman. Bane has shown to be capable of lifting 15 tons. <ref name="Demon"/> In prison, he taught himself various scientific disciplines equal to the level of understanding of leading experts in those fields.<ref name="Broken"/> He knows six active languages and at least two additional arcane and [[language death|dead ones]]. Among these are Spanish, English, [[Persian language|Persian]], and [[Latin]].<ref name="Demon"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Batman and Robin|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwgz-smPCcs}}</ref> The ''Bane of the Demon'' storyline reveals that he has an eidetic memory. Within one year, he is able to deduce Batman's [[secret identity]].<ref name="Demon"/>

He is also highly devious and a superb strategist and tactician.<ref name="Broken">{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Dennis O'Neil|O'Neill, Dennis]], [[Bob Kane|Kane, Bob]] | Artist = Various others | Story = Broken Bat | Title = [[Batman: Knightfall]] | Date = 1993 | Publisher = [[DC Comics]] | Panel =  | ID = 1563891425 }}</ref> In prison, Bane also invented his own form of [[calisthenics]], [[meditation]], and a fighting style that he uses against other well-known martial arts fighters within the DC Universe. Bane creator Chuck Dixon's early tales portray Bane as a very calm, centered warrior akin to [[Bruce Lee]]; in as much that he draws strength through calm meditation, and the spiritual energy of the "very rock of Peña Dura". Dixon imbued Bane with an almost supernatural quality when he explained that Bane triumphed in all of his prison fights by employing these abilities, while his opponents had only rage and greed to propel them. Multiple scenes in "Vengeance of Bane" explore this aspect when it explains that Bane's mastery of meditation techniques "made time and space playthings to him." A subsequent scene that reinforces this ability comes when Bird first comes to Bane for help, because he heard from other inmates that Bane has "magic... the kind that allows him to travel beyond the prison walls."<ref name="Demon"/> Usage of Venom enhances his physical abilities, including his strength and healing process, to [[superhuman]] levels.<ref name="dc-ency">{{Cite book  | last = Wallace  | first = Dan | author-link =  | contribution = Bane | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | page = 36  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = London  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicvine.com/bane/29-6129/ |title=Bane (comic book character) |publisher=Comicvine.com |accessdate=December 29, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101225025609/http://www.comicvine.com/bane/29-6129/| archivedate= 25 December 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://comicbookdb.com/character.php?ID=525 |title=Bane |publisher=Comic Book DB |accessdate=December 29, 2010}}</ref>

Although Bane had sworn off using Venom in ''Vengeance of Bane II'' in 1995, and his character is actually written as having kept that promise to himself, it is still not uncommon for artists to draw Bane as still wearing the tube leading from his old wrist device to the back of his head, as well as almost all media adaptations of the character show him actively using the Venom compound. Writer Gail Simone explained these lapses in the continuity of Bane's appearance in an issue of ''Secret Six'', in which [[Deadshot (comics)|Deadshot]] remarked that Bane merely kept his old Venom equipment with him out of habit, even though Bane states that he would sooner die than use it again.<ref>''Secret Six'' vol. 3 #6 (April 2009)</ref>

==Other versions==
In the ''[[Amalgam Comics|Amalgam universe]]'', Bane was combined with [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Nuke (Marvel Comics)|Nuke]] as [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]]'s '''Bane Simpson''',<ref>''Bruce Wayne: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #1</ref> Another version of Bane was merged with [[Punisher]] called the '''Banisher''' appeared. He's described as a "gun-toting, drugged up anti-hero who broke Bruce Wayne's back."<ref>''Challengers of the Fantastic'' #1</ref>

In the ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'' reality, Bane and [[Two-Face]] are mentioned by an aged Bruce Wayne to [[Superman (Kingdom Come)|Superman]] that they broke into [[Wayne Manor]] and destroyed it, after Batman's identity was exposed, leaving only the [[Batcave]] intact.<ref>''Kingdom Come'' #1</ref>

Bane appeared in numerous ''[[Elseworlds]]'' including ''[[Batman: Nosferatu]]'' as a low-level criminal,<ref>''Batman: Nosferatu''</ref> a dead Bane appears in a brief cameo in ''JLA: Riddle of the Beast'', killed by [[Green Arrow]].<ref>''JLA: Riddle of the Beast''</ref>

Bane appears in ''[[Smallville]]'' comic ''Smallville Season Eleven''. One night in Gotham, Batman drops into a building, shocking three men playing cards with his sudden appearance. They claim to have done nothing wrong until Bane kicks in the door, saying that Batman is after him. After a brief fight Bane gains the upper hand and is about to break Batman until the cape crusader calls in the [[Batmobile]] for backup and kooks Bane down. Just then Nightwing appears and they finish off Bane together. Later, [[Commissioner Gordon]] questions Batman for the whereabouts of Bane and Batman tells him that he can be found in a warehouse, depowered. In Gotham City, the yellow rings of Parallax head to [[Arkham Asylum]]. There, Batman and [[Nightwing]] are doing their best to contain the newly powered inmates of Arkham, including Bane, who have already been transformed into Yellow Lanterns. Luckily, [[Superman]] arrives just in time to offer assistance to Batman and Nightwing. Superman tries to control the situation but his inexperience with his power ring doesn't help at all, so Bane and [[Firefly (DC Comics)|Firefly]] attack him, while he is protecting the doctors. After been attacked by Bane, [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] and [[Mr. Freeze]], Batman tells Superman that the ring is not doing either of them any bit of good. After this, the Yellow Lanterns stand still and kneel before him. Parallax suddenly appears behind Superman, having John Stewart under his control. Emil Hamilton succeeds into finding a way to reboot the rings so when he does all the Yellow Lanterns, including Bane, are released from the influence of fear and lose their powers with the rings turning black. After their rings get rebooted and they lose their powers, the inmates of Arkham fall from the sky unable to do anything to escape from their eventual death but fortunately Superman manages to save them all. After Parallax's defeat, all the now depowered criminals return to Arkham Asylum.
