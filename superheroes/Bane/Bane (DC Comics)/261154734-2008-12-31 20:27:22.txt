'''Bane''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] that appears in [[comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. The character first appeared in ''Batman: Vengeance of Bane'' #1 (January 1993), and was created by [[Chuck Dixon]], [[Doug Moench]], and [[Graham Nolan]]. Originally intended as a "dark mirror" of the highly disciplined and multi-skilled [[Pulp magazine|pulp]] hero [[Doc Savage]],<ref name="WP - Bane">{{cite web|first=Suzanne|last=Tobin|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/liveonline/03/regular/style/comics/r_style_comics051603.htm|title=Comics: Meet the Artist|quote=Actually, Chuck Dixon came up the idea for an evil 'Doc Savage' and I designed the character|accessdate=2008-05-10|date=2003-05-16|work=''[[Washington Post]]''}}</ref> Bane (real name unknown) spends his childhood in a hellish prison on the corrupt [[Island country|island nation]] of [[Santa Prisca (DC Comics)|Santa Prisca]]<ref name="UGO - Bane"/> where he develops [[superhuman strength]] through a forced experiment involving the drug [[List of comic book drugs#Venom|Venom]].<ref name="Broken"/> Although his dependency on Venom is an immense weakness, Bane has been one of Batman's most intelligent and physically powerful foes.<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation  | last = Wallace  | first = Dan | author-link =  | contribution = Bane | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 36  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = London  | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5}}</ref>  He is best known for breaking Batman's back in the "''[[Batman: Knightfall#Knightfall|Knightfall]]''" story arc.<ref name="Broken">{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Dennis O'Neill|O'Neill, Dennis]], [[Bob Kane|Kane, Bob]] | Artist = Various others | Story = ''Broken Bat'' | Title = ''Batman: Knightfall'' | Volume =  | Issue =  | Date = 1993 | Publisher = [[DC Comics]] | Page =  | Panel =  | ID = 1563891425 }}</ref> While primarily a [[supervillain|villain]], Bane is a complex character and has worked to take down drug lords.

==Publication history==
[[Chuck Dixon]], [[Doug Moench]], and [[Graham Nolan]] created the character for the ''[[Batman: Knightfall|Knightfall]]'' storyline, although it is unclear what elements were introduced by each of the two writers (Dixon and Moench). Dixon wrote the character's first appearance (''Vengeance of Bane''),<ref name="UGO - Bane">{{cite web|url=http://batman.ugo.com/roguesgallery/bane/|title=UGO's World of Batman - Rogues Gallery - Bane|accessdate=2005-05-10|publisher=[[UGO]]}}</ref> with art by Graham Nolan. It is also unclear how much input was provided by [[Dennis O'Neil|Denny O'Neil]] (veteran writer of the ''Batman'' books, then Group Editor for the ''Batman'' family of books, and author of the novel adaptation of ''Knightfall'').<ref name="WP - Bane"/><ref name="UGO - Bane"/> O'Neil had previously created Bane's hellish birthplace of Santa Prisca in ''[[Question (comics)|The Question]]'' and the drug [[List of comic book drugs#Venom|Venom]] in the storyline of the same name (published in the pages of ''Legends of the Dark Knight'' #16-20, and later reprinted as a trade paperback).<ref name="WP - Bane"/><ref name="UGO - Bane"/> In the pages of ''[[Azrael (comics)|Azrael]]'', O'Neil introduced Bane's perception of Venom as both an [[addiction]] and the weakness responsible for his earlier defeats. The link between Bane and King Snake was introduced by writer Scott Beatty.<ref name="Broken"/>

==Fictional character biography==
The origin of Bane has similarities with another [[fictional character]], [[Alexandre Dumas, père|Alexandre Dumas]]' [[Edmond Dantès]]. Born to serve the [[Life imprisonment|life sentence]] of his father, Bane's childhood and early adult life are spent behind the walls of Peña Duro, an infamous prison located in [[Santa Prisca (DC Comics)|Santa Prisca]].<ref name="Broken"/><ref name="UGO - Bane"/> Though imprisoned, his natural abilities allow him to develop extraordinary skills within the prison's walls. He reads as many books as he can get his hands on, builds up his body in the prison's [[gym]], and learns to fight in the merciless school of prison life. Despite his circumstances, he appears to have found teachers of various sorts during his incarceration, ranging from hardened convicts to an elderly [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priest, under whose tutelage he apparently receives a classical education. Bane murders this priest upon his return to Santa Prisca years later. However, he commits his first murder at the age of eight, stabbing a criminal who wanted to use him to gain information about the prison.<ref name="Broken"/>

During his years in prison, Bane carries a teddy bear he calls Osito ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "little bear"), whom he considers his only friend.<ref name="dc-ency"/>  It is revealed that Osito has a hole in his back to hold a knife that Bane uses against anyone who [[bullying|bullies]] him.<ref name="Broken"/><ref name="UGO - Bane"/>

Bane ultimately establishes himself as the "king" of Peña Duro prison. The prison's controllers take note and, eventually, force him to become a test subject for a mysterious drug known as Venom, which had killed all other subjects. It nearly kills him at first, but he survives and finds its effects enhance his physical strength, although he needs to take it every 12 hours (via a system of cables pumped directly into his brain) or he would suffer debilitating [[Adverse drug reaction|side-effect]]s.<ref name="Broken"/><ref name="UGO - Bane"/>

===The Man who Broke the Bat===
[[Image:Bane-breaks-Batman-497pg21.png|175px|thumb|Bane breaks [[Batman]]'s back in a [[Comics vocabulary#Splash page|splash page]] from ''Batman'' #497 (July 1993). Art by [[Jim Aparo]].]]
Years later, Bane escapes Peña Duro, along with several accomplices based on the [[Doc Savage#The Fabulous Five and Pat|Fabulous Five]] (his friends Trogg, Zombie, and Bird, all of whom are named after 1960s rock bands: [[The Troggs]], [[The Zombies]], and [[The Birds (band)|The Byrds]], and were designed to mimic three of Doc Savage's assistants [[Andrew Blodgett Mayfair|Monk]], [[Theodore Marley Brooks|Ham]], and [[John Renwick|Renny]]).<ref name="Broken"/><ref name="UGO - Bane"/> His ambition turns to destroying Batman, whom he had heard tales of while serving his sentence. He is fascinated with [[Gotham City]] as, like the prison, it is a place where fear ruled: in this case, fear of Batman. Bane is convinced that the demonic bat that haunted his dreams since childhood is a representation of the Batman.<ref name="Broken"/><ref name="UGO - Bane"/>

Aware that a direct assault on Batman would be foolish, Bane destroys the walls of [[Arkham Asylum]], allowing its deranged inmates (including the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]], the [[Scarecrow (comics)|Scarecrow]], the [[Mad Hatter (comics)|Mad Hatter]], [[Ventriloquist (comics)|The Ventriloquist]], [[Firefly (comics)|Firefly]], [[Cavalier (comics)|Cavalier]], and [[Zsasz]]) to escape into Gotham City, where Batman spends three months rounding them up. Running himself to exhaustion, Batman returns to [[Wayne Manor]], where Bane awaits him. He fights Batman in the [[Batcave]], defeats him, and delivers the ''[[coup de grâce]]'': He breaks Batman's back and leaves him paraplegic, thereby having been the only man to have "Broken the Bat".<ref name="Broken"/><ref name="UGO - Bane"/>

While Bane establishes himself as ruler of Gotham's criminal underworld, Bruce Wayne passes the mantle of Batman to Jean-Paul Valley, also known as [[Azrael (comics)|Azrael]]. As Batman, Jean-Paul grows increasingly violent, allowing the villain [[Abattoir (comics)|Abattoir]] to fall to his death. Jean-Paul also refuses to recognize [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Robin]] as his partner. Utilizing a sophisticated combat suit in place of the traditional Batman uniform, he fights and defeats Bane at the end of the "''Knightfall''" arc, severing the tubes that pump the Venom into Bane's bloodstream, causing severe [[withdrawal]]. Valley then gives the weakened Bane a vicious beating, leaving him alive but broken.<ref name="Broken"/><ref name="UGO - Bane"/>

=== After the Fall ===
After losing to the Jean Paul Valley Batman, Bane was apprehended and taken to serve in Blackgate Prison for his various crimes up to and including multiple counts of manslaughter. Bane is seen in a paralyzed, catatonic state in [[Catwoman]] #4 (1993), reliving his loss to Jean Paul Valley at the same time he is coping with the severe withdrawal of the highly addictive Venom drug. Meanwhile, while Catwoman herself ventures to Santa Prisca it is revealed that the current El Jefe Del Pais of [[Santa Prisca]] is, in fact, the father of Bane. He explains that when he was a poor man who fought to improve the country's people he became very unpopular with the then-El Jefe Del Pais, who cast his pregnant wife into Peña Duro where she would then give birth to Bane. Catwoman's sometime-associate Leopold visited Bane in his cell, telling him a made-up story Catwoman told him to recite to him, that his father was someone else entirely (the character Quincy Lord), that Quincy laughed at the idea of his son being in prison. Bane, even in his catatonic, vegetative state, reached forth and snapped Leopold's neck with a single hand. Bane never learned the truth of his true father that Catwoman was privy to. Later, in [[Robin]] #8 (1994), simultaneously when Bruce Wayne reclaims the mantle and costume of Batman, a still catatonic Bane is haunted by a sudden vision of bats. Bane whispers that he knows he's back.

=== Legacy ===
Further following the events of "''Knightfall''", Bane recovers from his Venom addiction while serving time in Blackgate Prison, as seen in ''Vengeance of Bane II: The Redemption'' (1995). He eventually escapes from prison and returns to Gotham, where he fights alongside Batman to take out a criminal ring that is distributing a Venom derivative to street-level thugs. Following a victory over the criminals (and the revelation that behind it is the same doctor that performed the same surgery on Bane years earlier in Santa Prisca), Bane proclaims that he is "innocent" of his past crimes and urges Batman to stop hunting him. He then leaves Gotham (without fighting Batman) to begin a search for his father.<ref>{{Cite comic

The priest explains that there were four men who could possibly have been his father: a Santa Priscan [[revolutionary]], an [[United States|American]] doctor, an [[English people|English]] [[mercenary]], and a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] banker. While searching for the Swiss in [[Rome]], Bane encounters [[Ra's al Ghul]]'s daughter [[Talia al Ghul|Talia]]. Talia introduces Bane to her father, and eventually Bane impresses Ra's so much that he chooses Bane as his heir (an "honor" he had previously imparted on Batman).<ref name="Demon"/>

Following a fallout with Ra's al Ghul, Bane later embarks on a campaign to destroy [[Lazarus Pit]]s around the world, and in the process, encounters [[Black Canary]] in ''[[Birds of Prey (comic book)|Birds of Prey]]'' #26 (February 2001).<ref>{{Cite comic

===Veritas Liberat===
According to the Jesuit priest that Bane speaks with in "''Bane of the Demon''" #1, there is a possibility that Bane's biological father is an American doctor.<ref name="Demon"/> In researching this issue, Bane comes to the conclusion that he and Batman share Dr. [[Thomas Wayne]] as their biological father, with Dr. Wayne having apparently become close to Bane's mother during his time in Santa Prisca. Bane alerts Batman to this possibility, and during the time that the [[DNA]] tests are being performed, stays at [[Wayne Manor]] and fights alongside Batman on the streets of Gotham in the "''Tabula Rasa''" storyline (''[[Gotham Knights]]'' #33-36, November 2002 - February 2003). Ultimately, it is revealed that Dr. Wayne is not Bane's father, and Bane leaves Gotham peacefully (and with Batman's blessing and financial backing) to pursue leads in the snowy mountains of [[Kangchenjunga]].<ref>{{Cite comic

Bane eventually finds his father, who turns out to not be the El Jefe Del Pais of Santa Prisca (''Catwoman'' #4, November 1993) at all but rather the unscrupulous [[King Snake]], in the "''Veritas Liberat''" storyline (''Gotham Knights'' #47-49, January - March 2004). Bane, with Batman looking on, helps foil King Snake's plans to unleash a powerful weapon upon the world. Bane saves Batman from being shot by King Snake, but is mortally wounded in the process. Batman then saves Bane by bathing him in a [[Lazarus Pit]], and leaves him with a clean slate and a new opportunity at life.<ref>{{Cite comic

=== ''Infinite Crisis'' & ''One Year Later'' ===
In ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #7, Bane is shown fighting alongside the villains during the Battle of Metropolis.  During the battle, he breaks the back of the hero [[Judomaster]], killing him. No reason was given for his actions in #7, though in ''Infinite Crisis'''s collected edition, one of the many changes made to the original series was Bane saying "I finally know who I am. I am ''Bane''. I ''break'' people." while breaking Judomaster's back.<ref>{{cite web|first=Ray|last=Tate|url=http://www.comicsbulletin.com/reviews/11468883691605.htm|title=''Infinite Crisis'' #7 Review - Line of Fire Reviews|accessdate=2008-05-22|date=2006-05-05|publisher=Comics Bulletin}}</ref>

Bane resurfaces in the ''[[One Year Later]]'' continuity in ''JSA Classified'' #17-18 searching for the [[Hourman|Hourmen]] (Rex and Rick Tyler), asking them for help. To win their trust, he tells them how, prior to the Battle of Metropolis, he returned to his homeland to put an end to the drug lords' government, in the process discovering that a new, more addicting strain of Venom had been created.  In his furious carelessness to wipe out the drug trade, he was captured, and reimplanted with the cranial tubes, hooked to the new Venom, but now unable to shake off his addiction without dying from the withdrawal.  Bane was forced to work as an enforcer for the drug cartel, unable to escape.  Believing that Bane sought Rex Tyler's expertise in [[chemistry]], Rick lets him approach his father, only to discover that the story is a ruse.  Bane, who had never truly been addicted to Venom, had in fact wiped out the drug lords, and destroyed every research note on Venom. He discovered in the process both strains of Venom derived from Rex Tyler's early research on Miraclo. He discovers from the Tylers that no written notes exist of Rex's work, captures Rex, and steals Rick's equipment, planning to kill Rex and force Rick to take the last of the new Venom, living forever as an addict. Rick manipulates Bane into using Miraclo and demolishing the building as he and his father escape, burying the mercenary in the rubble of the very same Santa Priscan penitentiary where his story began.<ref>{{Cite comic

Eventually Bane resurfaces in Santa Prisca, leading the country to [[democracy|democratic]] elections.

[[Fire (comics)|Fire]] and Judomaster's son, [[Thomas Jagger]], are sent on the mission, with Jagger debating whether or not to seek revenge for his father's murder.

It has been revealed that Bane will join the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]] in their new ongoing series starting in September 2008. In the first issue Bane is depicted as a stoic devil's advocate for the group, offering alternative points of view for both [[Deadshot]] and [[Catman (comics)|Catman]] on the subject of love.<ref>''Secret Six'' #1</ref> He is later shown to have an almost father-like concern for [[Scandal (comics)|Scandal Savage]]'s well-being.<ref>''Secret Six'' #3</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Bane is highly intelligent; in "''Bane of the Demon''", Ra's al Ghul says that Bane "has a mind equal to the greatest he has known."<ref name="Demon"/> In prison, he taught himself various scientific disciplines equal to the level of understanding of leading experts in those fields.<ref name="Broken"/> He knows six active languages and at least two additional arcane and [[extinct language|dead ones]], those mentioned are Spanish, English, [[Urdu]], Farsi, and [[Latin]].<ref name="Demon"/> The "''Bane of the Demon''" storyline reveals that he has a [[Eidetic memory|photographic memory]]. Within one year, he is able to deduce Batman's [[secret identity]].<ref name="Demon"/> He is also highly devious and a superb strategist and tactician. In prison, Bane also invented his own form of [[calisthenics]], [[meditation]], and a unique fighting style.<ref name="Demon"/> Usage of Venom enhances his physical abilities and healing process to superhuman levels. However, it is shown that Bane is physically superior to Batman, even when not using Venom.{{Fact|date=December 2008}}

==In other media==
===Television===
Bane appears in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' (1992-95; episode ''Bane''), its successor ''[[The New Batman/Superman Adventures]]'' (1997-99; episodes ''Knight Time'' and ''Over the Edge''), voiced by [[Henry Silva]], and the ''[[Batman Beyond]]'' (1999-2001) episode "''The Winning Edge''". In his first appearance, he's hired by [[Rupert Thorne]] to kill Batman. He wounds [[Killer Croc]], destroys the [[Batmobile]], and kidnaps [[Dick Grayson]]. His origin is that of a prisoner who volunteers for (Project [[Gilgamesh]]) a super soldier experiment in the [[Amazon]]. Thorne's moll also says that Batman is Bane's favorite topic, and has studied him thoroughly. In these depictions, Bane never defeats Batman (although he does come close to severely wounding him on a few occasions). In ''[[Batman Beyond]]'', his dependency on Venom came to a point that all it can do for him is keep him alive, but he's too weak to prepare the drug himself, so he had no choice but teach someone the recipe. This someone eventually decides to mass-produce Venom in the form of stickers known as "Slappers" and sell it to teenagers. The producers were reluctant to utilize him (along with [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] in the ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'') because they felt that their comics incarnations were both too [[gimmick]]y.<ref name="BTAS"/> 

A more monstrous version of Bane is depicted in ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' (2004-08), voiced by [[Joaquim de Almeida]] in "''Traction''" and [[Ron Perlman]] in "''Team Penguin''".<ref name="Traction">{{cite web|first=Adam|last=Beechen|url=http://www.tv.com/the-batman/traction/episode/357600/recap.html|title=''The Batman: Traction'' Recap|accessdate=2008-05-11|date=2004-09-25|publisher=TV.com}}</ref><ref name="Team">{{cite web|first=Joseph|last=Kuhr|url=http://www.tv.com/the-batman/team-penguin/episode/864504/recap.html|title=''The Batman: Team Penguin'' Recap|accessdate=2008-05-11|date=2006-09-30|publisher=TV.com}}</ref>
First, he appears as an assassian hired by Gotham mob bosses to kill Batman. He is said to have volunteered for enhancement in a lab deep in the Amazon.

===Film===
[[Image:RobertSwenson-Bane.JPG|right|thumb|175px|[[Robert Swenson]] as Bane in ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman and Robin]]'' (1997).]]

Bane appears in the [[live-action]]  movie ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman and Robin]]'' (1997). Unlike his comics counterpart, this incarnation has a real name, '''Antonio Diego''' (played by Michael Reid MacKay), and turned into the muscular Bane (portrayed by [[Robert Swenson]]) by [[Floronic Man|Dr. Jason Woodrue]]. Rather than being the devious, intelligent villain of the comics, this version is an inarticulate thug who serves as the [[lackey]] of [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], one of the main villains of the film. Bane is barely even capable of speech and uses growls, roars, and snarls for most of his communication. Despite this, he is still muscular, wears a slight variation of his classic mask, and is still superhumanly strong. This depiction of the character was one of many aspects of the film which received harsh criticism from fans and critics alike.<ref name="DVD review">{{cite web|first=Dustin|last=McNeill|url=http://www.dvdactive.com/reviews/dvd/batman-and-robin.html|title=''Batman & Robin'' (US - DVD R1) in Reviews|quote=The only one I can recommend watching is the biography on Bane.

Like all characters who have super strength in the game, he can grab opponents and attack them. He breaks an opponents back when doing, and is the only super strength character who can grab Batman, obviously as a reference to the incident when Bane broke Batman´s back, which is also referred to in the Trivia in the game. The Xbox 360 version even awards an achievement for doing so. Bane is the only villain in who is involved in the story of the game who never fights Batman: in the hero storyline, he only appears in the opening and ending cutscenes of episode 2. However, Bane is, like most villains, playable in the villain-side story. Here is is revealed that he was abandoned by Penguin after completing his part of the job and left to the police, which explains his abscence from the hero story. Bane is also set to appear in the upcoming video game ''[[DC Universe Online]]''.
