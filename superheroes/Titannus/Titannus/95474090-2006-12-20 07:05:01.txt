'''Titannus''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He first appeared in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' (vol. 3) #2, and was created by [[Robert Kirkman]] and [[Scott Kolins]].

==Character history==
Originally, Titannus was a [[Skrull]] who, lacking shape-shifting abilities, became one of the subjects of the [[Super-Skrull]] project, giving him enhanced strength and a healing factor that would allow him to recover from any wound.  Leaving his world, he eventually arrived on the planet Trellion, where he was brainwashed by the inhabitants to act as their agent.  Believing that he was fleeing an oppressive ruler, he escaped with the woman he loved (against her will) and traveled to planet Earth in an attempt to seek the aid of the heroes so they could revolt against Trellion. 

His spacecraft crash landing in Japan, Titannus observed the heroes of Earth for several months and attempted to 'gain their attention' by destroying [[Tokyo]], defeating the premier superhero of Japan, [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]] and killing countless soldiers of the Japanese army.

Sensing the disturbance, [[Doctor Strange]] assembled a new team of [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] to oppose the alien, consisting of [[Spider-Man]], the [[Incredible Hulk]], [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], [[She-Hulk]], [[Ms. Marvel]] and [[Nova (comics)|Nova]]. Titannus attempted to win them over to his side by recounting the story he had been brainwashed with and claiming that he had merely lost his temper when attacled by Sunfire, but Doctor Strange sensed little truth in Titannus' words, and Spider-Man stated that they did ''not'' help someone who blew up a city just because he had a sob story to tell them.  Despite their best efforts, however, the gathered heroes were unable to stop Titannus, who displayed enough power to defeat even the Hulk with ease by absorbing the gamma radiation that powered the behemoth.  When Titannus' beloved was woken up by Strange and Nova, the truth was revealed and Titannus, having been so dependent on his love for her, was driven to suicide by her rejection, apparently killing himself by crushing his own head.

However, his healing factor was so advanced that it allowed him to grow a new head, although he appeared to suffer from total [[amnesia]], possibly because of his development of a completely new brain.  Later, some insane scientists from [[Tokyo]] took control over Titannus and ordered him to attack the [[U.S.A.]]  Again some superheroes had to assemble to subdue the monster.  Titannus was defeated and taken in by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], when Doctor Strange found the location of the people who controlled him.

==Alternate timeline version==

In a reality where the Avengers never disbanded, the [[Vision (comics)|Vision]] detected Titannus' ship upon its arrival.  After making contact with Titannus, the Avengers came with him to Trellion, sympathising with him because of his 'false' story, only to be attacked by Titannus and the natives of the planet upon their arrival.

The [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] was killed instantly, [[Giant-Man]] was announced missing in action, and [[Captain America]] was executed to break their spirits.  It took five years for the reserve Avengers to rescue the team, and another five before the Trellions were convinced to leave Earth alone.  In this world, [[Reed Richards]] presumably made an unknown fatal mistake that led to the deaths of many, and the [[Iron Man]] of this timeline took on the familiar trappings of [[Doctor Doom]].  During the first story arc of the third ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' series, this twisted version of Tony Stark has come to Earth 616, the primary Earth of the Marvel Universe, and now goes by the name of [[Iron Maniac]].

==In other media==

Titannus appears as a villain in the video game ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]''. In the game's [[storyline]], The player and their team meet Titannus while attempting to save the Skrull world from [[Galactus]]. Titannus says that he was forced into the Super Skrull program against his will. He has come to a skrull [[laboratory]] looking for "vengeance" against all Skrull kind and tells the heroes not to bother saving the Skrulls. The heroes recommend he not blame all Skrulls for what the scientists did to him, but a he disagrees. A battle ensues, and in combat, Titannus constantly insists that the heroes "are not worth to battle [him]".
