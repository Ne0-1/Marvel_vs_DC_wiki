'''Tag''' ('''Brian Cruz''') is a mutant appearing in comic books published by Marvel Comics. He first appeared in New Mutants, vol. 2 #7 and was a member of the student body of the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]] and the Hellions squad therein.

==Biography==
Brian Cruz came to Emma Frost's squad after the X-Mansion was rebuilt. He joined up with the [[Hellions (comics)|Hellions]] and took on the codename "Tag."{{Issue|date=April 2010}} He never questioned Hellion and went along with his plans.

Tag is featured in the ''New X-Men: Hellions'' series that debuted in October 2005. While vacationing in Hellion's parents' home, the entire squad stumbles upon the secret of the Kingmaker. In a seemingly magical ritual, Tag and the others say their full name into the phone after guarding a number hidden in a safe. A man called the Kingmaker appears shortly afterwards and convinces the squad that he can grant them their heart's desires in exchange for a later favor. Tag becomes the business manager for his friends; this is his wish as arranged by their new ally. Brian simply did not want to lose his friends after they became famous. However, the favor turns out to be the theft of a biological weapon. Before they realize the immoral implications, the group fights [[Diamondback (comics)|Diamondback]] and [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]]. Then they rebel. Despite the Kingmaker being physically formidiable (he can shake off Tag's powers) the Hellions retrieve and destroy the weapon. <ref>''New X-Men: Hellions'' #1–6 (2005–2006)</ref>

After most of the world's mutants lost their powers during the [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]], Emma Frost decided it would be best if non-powered students left the school.{{issue|date=December 2012}} While some left early, Tag stuck around the mansion as long as possible. After he and several other mutants (including [[Dryad (comics)|Dryad]] and [[Network (comics)|Network]]) said goodbye to their friends, they climbed on a bus out of Xavier's. However, the bus was destroyed by a missile launched by [[William Stryker]]'s [[Purifiers]]. Tag and the others that were in the bus were killed.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

==Powers and abilities==
Tag could "tag" other people, originally causing them to emit a psionic signal compelling others to run away from the tagged subject.  In the ''Hellions'' mini-series he further developed his abilities to cause people to flock to a tagged individual as well. He then finds he can do this to inanimate objects as well. His powers can be resisted by those with mental training; they also have range limits. 

==Other versions==
===House of M===
Tag appeared in the House of M and had an unrequited crush on [[Quentin Quire]]. When Quire committed suicide, Cruz doubted it and started investigating his friends death. Cruz ends up saving [[Cypher (comics)|Douglas Ramsey]] and [[Karma (comics)|Shan Coy Manh]] from [[Sean Garrison (comics)|Sean Garrison]] by "tagging" him, making him run away from himself, which he accomplishes by jumping out of the window to his death. <ref>"New X-Men: Academy X" #16–19 (Feb. 2006)</ref>
