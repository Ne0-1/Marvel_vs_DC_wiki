'''Tag''' ('''Brian Cruz''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] in the [[Marvel Universe]], one of the student body in the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]], and a member of the [[Hellions]] squad therein. He first appeared in ''[[New Mutants]]'' vol. 2 #7.

==Fictional character biography==
Brian Cruz came to [[Emma Frost]]'s squad after the [[X-Mansion]] was rebuilt. He joined up with the [[Hellions (comics)|Hellions]] and took on the codename "Tag." He never questioned [[Hellion]] and went along with the plan.

After most of the world's mutants lost their powers during the [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]], Emma Frost decided it would be best if non-powered students left the school. While some left early, Tag stuck around the mansion as long as possible. After he and several other mutants (including [[Dryad (comics)|Dryad]] and [[Network (comics)|Network]]) said goodbye to their friends, they climbed on a bus out of Xavier's. Unfortunately, the bus was destroyed by a missile launched by [[William Stryker]]'s [[Purifiers]]. Tag and the others that were in the bus were killed.

==Powers and abilities==
Tag could "tag" other people, originally causing them to emit a psionic signal compelling others to run away from the tagged subject.  In the ''Hellions'' mini-series he further developed his abilities to cause people to flock to a tagged individual as well. His powers were removed during the 2005 miniseries "[[House of M]]", in which Brian and several other mutants were turned into "baseline" humans.

==Other versions==
===House of M===
Tag appeared in the House of M and was trying to be a good friend of [[Quentin Quire]]. When Quire committed suicide, Cruz doubted it and started investigating his friends death. Cruz ends up saving [[Cypher (comics)|Douglas Ramsey]] and [[Karma (comics)|Shan Coy Manh]] from [[Sean Garrison (comics)|Sean Garrison]] by "tagging" him.
