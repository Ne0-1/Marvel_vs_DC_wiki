'''Tag''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[Puerto Rico| Puerto Rican]] [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] in the [[Marvel Universe]], one of the student body in the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]], and a member of the [[Hellions]] squad therein. His real name is Brian Cruz, and he first appeared in ''New Mutants'' (volume 2) #7.

After most of the world's mutants lost their powers in "House of M", headmistress [[Emma Frost]] decided it would be best if non-powered students left the school.  While some left early, Tag stuck around the mansion as long as possible.  After he and several other mutants (including [[Dryad (comics)|Dryad]] and [[Network (comics)|Network]]) said goodbye to their friends, they climbed on a bus out of Xavier's.  Unfortunately the bus was destroyed by a missile launched by [[William Stryker|William Stryker's]] Purifiers.  Tag and the others that were in the bus were killed.

==Powers==

Tag could "tag" other people, originally causing them to emit a psionic signal compelling others to run away from the tagged subject.  In the ''Hellions'' mini-series he further developed his abilities to cause people to flock to a tagged individual as well. His powers were removed during the 2005 miniseries "House of M", in which Brian and several other mutants were turned into "baseline" humans.
