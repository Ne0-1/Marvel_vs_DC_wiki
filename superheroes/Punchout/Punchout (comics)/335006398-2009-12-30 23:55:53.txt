'''Punchout''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe. Her first appearance was in ''Uncanny X-Men #235''.

The super-strong mutant known only as Punchout was a member of the super-powered [[Press Gang (comics)|Press Gang]], law enforcers, from the island nation of [[Genosha]].

After repeated disruptions to the Genoshan government, the island fell into a civil war. Punchout stayed with a small group of Press Gang members, fighting against the rebels. In one battle, she was knocked down by [[Jennifer Ransome]].

With the genocide of the entire Genoshan population by [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] controlled by [[Cassandra Nova]], Punchout's final fate is unknown. It is unknown if she retained or lost her mutant powers during the [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].

==Powers and abilities==
She has superhuman strength and stamina, high resistance to physical injury and temperature extremes.
