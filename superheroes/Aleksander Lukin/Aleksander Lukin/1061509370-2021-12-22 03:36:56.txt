==Fictional character biography==
Aleksander Lukin was born in the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] village of Kronas some time in the late 1930s. His village was used as the [[Red Skull]]'s base of operations during the [[Second World War]].<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 5 #1</ref> Soviet troops attempt to retake the town, assisted by the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]]' [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]] superhero team which include Captain America; Aleksander's mother was killed during the battle's course. The Soviet forces' leader Vasily Karpov takes the orphaned Lukin under as a protege.<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 5 #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> 

In the ensuing decades, Lukin became an important figure in the Soviet military and the [[KGB]], rising to the General rank.<ref name="Cap6">''Captain America'' vol. 5 #6.

Marvel Comics.</ref> Five years after later, the Red Skull finally recovers the reality-altering [[Cosmic Cube]], only to be assassinated by the [[Bucky Barnes|Winter Soldier]] on Lukin's orders. However, the Red Skull used the Cosmic Cube to transfer his own mind right before death into Lukin's body, leaving the two men stuck together "like rats in a cage".<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 5 #12-15. Marvel Comics.</ref> Lukin uses the Cosmic Cube to enrich his legitimate business front Kronas Corporation. But when, in a fit of rage, the Cosmic Cube harms one of his friends, Lukin has the Cosmic Cube sent away. After the Winter Soldier destroys the Cosmic Cube and regains his own memories, Lukin and the Red Skull have worked uneasily together against their common foe Captain America, even as the Red Skull wages a campaign for control of Lukin's body; Lukin vows to kill himself before allowing that to happen.<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 5 #18. Marvel Comics.</ref> Upon the Winter Soldier's discovery of Lukin's connection with the Red Skull, the two fake 'their' death to continue to operate from the shadows.<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 5 #25. Marvel Comics.</ref> With his former enforcer as Captain America, the pair contrive to abduct [[Sharon Carter]] to attach to a machine that will bring back the time-displaced [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]], however, their captive rebels and destroys the machine. [[Arnim Zola]]'s last-ditch maneuver transfers the Red Skull's consciousness into a robot with Lukin free at last before being gunned down by Carter only a few seconds afterwards.<ref>''Captain America'' Vol. 5 #42. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Lukin is later brought back from the dead by his wife Alexa Lukin, with the help of [[Grigori Rasputin|Rasputin]] and [[Selene (comics)|Selene]]. The Lukins join the Power Elite.
