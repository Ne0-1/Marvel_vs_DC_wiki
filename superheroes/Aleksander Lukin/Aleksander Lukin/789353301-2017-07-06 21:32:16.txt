==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=December 2012}}
He first appeared in ''[[Captain America]]'' vol. 5 #1, and was created by [[Ed Brubaker]] and [[Steve Epting]]. The character serves as the main [[antagonist]] of the Winter Soldier storyline.

==Fictional character biography==
Born in the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] village of Kronas some time in the late 1930s, Lukin's village is used by the [[Red Skull]] as a base of operations during the [[Second World War]].<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 5 #1</ref> Soviet troops attempt to retake the town, assisted by the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]]' [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]] superhero team which include [[Captain America]] and [[Bucky Barnes]]. Lukin's mother is killed in the course of the battle. The Soviet forces' leader [[List of Marvel Comics characters: K#Vasily Karpov|Vasily Karpov]] takes the orphaned Lukin under his wing.<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 5 #5</ref>

In the ensuing decades, Lukin became an important figure in the Soviet military and the [[KGB]], rising to the rank of General.<ref name="Cap6">''Captain America'' vol. 5 #6</ref> After his mentor's passing away, Lukin is left in custody of a large cache of special projects developed over the decades, including the Winter Soldier.<ref name="Cap6"/> He sells some of these devices to the highest bidders to raise funds. In one instance, he sells weapons to the Red Skull himself, but refuses to part with Winter Soldier for anything less than the reality-altering [[Cosmic Cube]] (which the Red Skull was not in possession of and would not give up in any case).<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 5 #9</ref>

Five years after that meeting, the Red Skull finally recovers the Cosmic Cube, only to be assassinated by the Winter Soldier on Lukin's orders. However, the Red Skull used the Cosmic Cube to transfer his own mind right before death into Lukin's body, leaving the two men stuck together "like rats in a cage".<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 5 #12-15</ref>

Lukin uses the cube to enrich his legitimate business front Kronas Corporation. Unfortunately, in a fit of rage, the Cosmic Cube harms one of Lukin's friends. Lukin has the Cosmic Cube sent away. After the Winter Soldier destroys the Cosmic Cube and regains his own memories, Lukin and the Red Skull have worked uneasily together against their common foe Captain America, even as the Red Skull wages a campaign for control of Lukin's body; Lukin vows to kill himself before allowing that to happen.<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 5 #18</ref>

Upon the Winter Soldier's discovery of Lukin's connection with the Red Skull, the Red Skull and Lukin fake 'their' death, and continue to operate from the shadows.<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 5 #25</ref> The pair contrive to abduct [[Sharon Carter]], attaching Carter to a machine that will bring back the time-displaced Steve Rogers. Carter rebels, however, and destroys the machine. In a last-ditch maneuver, [[Arnim Zola]] transfers the Red Skull's consciousness into a robot while Lukin is free at last but only for a few seconds before being gunned down by Carter.<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 5 #42</ref>
