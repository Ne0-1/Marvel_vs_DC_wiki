'''Mister Jip''' is an evil [[fictional]] character belonging to the [[Marvel Comics]] universe, possessing a grotesque appearance and various mystical powers. He almost exclusively appeared as a villain to [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]], first in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' volume 3 and later in their own series with one appearance in an [[X-Men]] [[Annual publication|annual]].

==Character biography==
The man, who would become known Mister Jip, was born centuries ago, somewhere in Asia. He roamed the world in the pursuit of knowledge and went to Tibet to find the legendary city of Kamar-Taj. Though the city was in ruins, Jip encountered the [[Ancient One]] and became his student. As his student, Jip was instructed in the arts of benevolent magic, but unknown to his master, he sought out books of dark magic and practiced forbidden rituals to increase his own power. When the Ancient One discovered this, he cast Jip out. These days Jip likes to think that he still did some good, as it was his example that allowed the Ancient One to recognise the signs of [[Baron Mordo]]'s betrayal centuries later.

Out on his own, Jip wanted to increase his knowledge of the dark arts even further. To do so he started to extend his life at the costs of others, but these dark arts twisted and corrupted his own body into a monstrous shape. Despite his desire to dominate the world, Jip stayed hidden over the centuries and rarely revealed himself to others. 

He appeared to [[Cloak (comics)|Cloak]], disguised as a store clerk. Cloak had become powerless and felt that without his powers his partner [[Dagger (comics)|Dagger]] wouldn't be interested in him anymore. Jip returned his powers in exchange for a price, which would later turn out to be Cloak's body as his new host. Dagger was shocked that Cloak would give up his chance at a normal life and left him, but returned in time to stop Jip from taking over Cloak's body. Jip would fight and manipulate Cloak and Dagger over the next few months, often acting through his minions Day and Night, who had powers similar to Cloak and Dagger, while at other times he would act to protect them. 

Jip also used the X-men as his agents once during the events of ''[[Atlantis Attacks]]''.

==Powers and abilities==
Mister Jip has enormous magical abilities, especially in the realm of black magic. He can create illusions, observe other places by [[scrying]] and summon mindless minions to perform simple tasks, like a flying creature that he uses as his spy. He uses a large part of these powers to hide himself from more powerful mages like [[Doctor Strange]].
Jip can grant powers to others, but always asks a price in return. 
His most important ability is the ability to take over a host body, adding his victim's life span to his own. To do this, he has to initiate a process where he removes the ties between his victim's body and soul and absorb the body into his own. 
This ability has several limitations though: 
* the victim must lack an "inner light" that can repel Jip. This usually means that his victims are evil men, but it can also mean that they have a link to supernatural darkness like Cloak has. 
* the victim must be unaware of the existence and intentions of Mister Jip.
* Mister Jip and the victim must be in constant physical contact during the whole process.
After the process is completed, Jip can take on the appearance of any of his former hosts, though probably only for a short time.
