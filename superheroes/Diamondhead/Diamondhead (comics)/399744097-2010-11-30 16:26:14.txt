==Fictional character biography==

===Civil War/Initiative===
In the aftermath of the [[Civil War (comics)|Stamford incident]], all the identities of the [[New Warriors]] were publicly leaked.{{Issue|date=November 2009}} Diamondhead used this information to locate Nova's parents' house at Long Island, patiently waiting around town until his nemesis returned from outer space, so that he could exact his revenge for all the years he spent in prison. Eventually, when Nova returned to Earth after [[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]], Diamondhead attacked him. However, he was unaware that Nova was empowered by the whole Nova Force, allowing him to easily shatter Diamondhead's right hand with a gravimetric pulse before turning him to the police.<ref>''Nova'' #2 (July 2007)</ref>
