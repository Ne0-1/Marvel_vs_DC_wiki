'''Candra''', sometimes called '''Kandra''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|Mutant]] [[supervillain]] appearing in [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].

She is a member of the [[Externals]] and has exhibited immensely powerful telekinetic abilities in addition to her being [[immortality|immortal]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===  
Candra is an immortal, so her exact origin is unknown. Her story picks up when she had a deal with the Thieves' and Assassins' Guild of [[New Orleans]], in which she provided them with power in exchange for monetary tributes. This deal was broken by [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]], whom she encountered when he journeyed back to the past to stop the Thieves' Guild from giving her the secrets of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. Candra was also behind [[Belladonna (comics)|Belladonna's]] abduction of Cody, the boy sent into a coma by [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue's]] first kiss, in an attempt to torture Gambit by trapping Rogue and having her killed. Fortunately, Rogue survived the attempt.  


===Demise===

Candra never joined with the other Externals, and preferred to play the power broker alone. To that end, years ago she placed the sum total of her power into a gem, which a young [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] stole. Recently, when Storm's teacher Achmed-el-Gibar died, Candra convinced the young thief [[Jamil (comics)|Jamil]], who seemed to be a powerful mutant, to join her, promising him even greater power. However, when Candra used Jamil to lure Storm to her and reacquire her Heart (the power gem), it was discovered that Jamil was only a psychic projection of [[Karima (comics)|Karima]], another young thief, who was the true mutant. Cyclops destroyed Candra's Heart, and it appears that Candra may have died as a result.

== Powers and abilities ==

Candra's mutant ability is telekinesis, the ability to move objects with the mind.

Candra can use this ability at a molecular level and often uses it to activate latent mutant genes in an individual, granting them active mutant powers. She has also implied that, once given, she can also take these abilities away, presumably by returning the appropriate genes to their latent states. She also uses this ability to heal herself and, apparently, to stave off the aging process.

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===

In the Age Of Apocalypse reality Candra was one of the accomplices to [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]], and held the title "Herald of Apocalypse". She was also one of his first [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Horsemen]], and was chosen to lead the other Horsemen after [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] refused to use nuclear weapons to attack North America.

She is not seen after the attack on Cape Citadel (X-Men Chronicles #1), but we learn that she was killed by [[Holocaust (comics)|Holocaust]] after working with the Assassins Guild (from ''Gambit and the X-Ternals'' #1).

== In other media ==
===Television===
*A character based on Candra is featured in the ''[[X-Men: The Animated Series|X-Men animated series]]'' episode ''[[X-Ternally Yours]]''. In it, she has the same connection to the Thieves and Assassins as in the comics, offering them great power and protection in exchange for decennial [[tithing]]s, with those who broke the tithe punished greatly. She is not as inherently evil as her comics counterpart, more focused on the tithe and ensuring its sanctity than any real criminal behavior. She eventually turns on the Assassins, after they threaten the tithe by kidnapping the Thieves' "chosen one" Bobby (Gambit's brother), and replacing their tithe with an empty box. Rather than the Candra shown in the comics, the character is referred to as The Spirit or The External. Another difference is that instead of a caucasian mutant, The X-Ternal is African-American in appearance and not necessarily human.
