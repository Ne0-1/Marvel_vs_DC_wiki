==Fictional character biography==

===Origin===
[[Image:Candra death.JPG|left|150px|thumb|Candra Dies, Art by Cedric Nocon]]
Candra's exact origin is unknown. Her story picks up when she had a deal with the Thieves' and Assassins' Guild of [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], in which she provided them with abnormally long life in exchange for monetary tributes and information.<ref>''Gambit'' vol. 3  issue 13 (2000)</ref>  This deal was broken by [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]], whom she encountered when he journeyed back to the past to stop the Thieves' Guild from giving her the secrets of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]].<ref>''Gambit'' vol. 3  issue 12 (2000)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Candra's mutant ability is [[psychokinesis|telekinesis]], the ability to move objects with the mind.

Candra can use this ability at a molecular level and often uses it to activate latent mutant genes in an individual, granting them active mutant powers. She has also implied that, once given, she can also take these abilities away, presumably by returning the appropriate genes to their latent states. She also uses this ability to heal herself and, apparently, to stave off the aging process.

==Other versions==

===Age of Apocalypse===
[[Image:Candra AOA.JPG|right|150px|thumb|Candra, Herald of Apocalypse, Art by Terry Dodson]]
Candra was one of the accomplices to [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] in the [[Age of Apocalypse]] reality, and held the title "Herald of Apocalypse".<ref>''X-Men Chronicles'' 01 (1995)</ref> She was also one of his first [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Horsemen]], and was chosen to lead the other Horsemen after [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] refused to use nuclear weapons to attack North America.<ref>''X-Men Chronicles'' 01 (1995)</ref>

She is not seen after the attack on Cape Citadel,<ref>''X-Men Chronicles'' 01 (1995)</ref> but it is later revealed that she was killed by [[Holocaust (comics)|Holocaust]] after working with the Assassins Guild.<ref>''Gambit and the X-Ternals'' #1</ref>

== In other media ==

===Television===
*A character based on Candra is featured in the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' [[List of animated television series|animated series]] episode'' [[X-Ternally Yours]]''. In it, she has the same connection to the Thieves and Assassins as in the comics, offering them great power and protection in exchange for decennial [[tithe|tithing]]s, with those who broke the tithe punished greatly. She is not as inherently evil as her comics counterpart, more focused on the tithe and ensuring its sanctity than any real criminal behavior. She eventually turns on the Assassins, after they threaten the tithe by kidnapping the Thieves' "chosen one" Bobby (Gambit's brother), and replacing their tithe with an empty box. Her name is never given, the character is referred to only as The Spirit or The X-Ternal. Another difference is that instead of a being caucasian, The X-Ternal is African-American.
