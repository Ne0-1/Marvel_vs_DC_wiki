While attempting the kidnapping, they murdered [[Sharon Friedlander]], a former staff member at [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]]'s [[X-Mansion|School for Gifted Youngsters]]. In the moment before she died, Sharon managed to send a [[psionic]] cry for help to Xavier. Based upon this, Xavier sent a squad of X-Men to investigate.
