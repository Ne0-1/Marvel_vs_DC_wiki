==Character biography==
In their first mission with the [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]], they were sent along with [[Cargill (comics)|Cargill]] and Carmella Unuscione to kidnap a young mutant. While attempting the kidnapping, they murdered [[Sharon Friedlander]], a former staff member at [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]]'s [[X-Mansion|School for Gifted Youngsters]]. In the moment before she died, Sharon managed to send a [[psionic]] cry for help to Xavier. Based upon this, Xavier sent a squad of X-Men to investigate. During the battle between the Acolytes and the X-Men, Eric was shot and killed by [[Tom Corsi]], another former staff member from Xavier's school. After discovering the mutant they were sent to kidnap had [[Down's Syndrome]], the Acolytes abandoned their mission.

Despite losing their brother, Harlan and Sven continued to serve with the Acolytes. During the destruction of [[Avalon (comics)|Avalon]] by [[Holocaust (comics)|Holocaust]], the twins were among the Acolytes who evacuated to Earth with the X-Man [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]]. They crash landed in the [[Australian Outback]], where they managed to get to the X-Men's former base of operations. Once help arrived, they turned themselves over to the authorities.

They were able to escape prison and rejoined the Acolytes under the leadership of [[Fabian Cortez]]. These Acolytes were involved in attacks on Wundagore mountain. Some time later, they were involved in an attack on the [[X-Mansion]] with a group of Acolytes. At the end of the battle, they asked for sanctuary with Xavier; they were denied. They eventually rejoined the Acolytes under [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]'s command, when he was give leadership over [[Genosha]]. The possibility that they died in the [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinel]] attack on Genosha is very high.
