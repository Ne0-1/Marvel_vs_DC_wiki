'''Gabriel "Gabe" Jones''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[comic book]] character in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel universe|universe]]. Created by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist and co-plotter [[Jack Kirby]], he made his [[first appearance]] in the [[World War II]] [[war comics]] series ''[[Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos]]'' #1 (May 1963).

==Publication history==
Gabe Jones appeared as a regular cast-member in virtually every issue and annual of ''Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos.'' In present-day stories, initially in the feature "Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D." in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' Vol. 1, he appears as an agent of that fictional [[espionage]] organization &mdash; inexplicably aged very little, like fellow WWII vet and agent [[Dum Dum Dugan]], despite a [[retcon]] explanation for agency head [[Nick Fury]]'s youthfulness. As a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, Jones has appeared in issues of ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'', ''[[Iron Man]]'', ''[[Captain America]]'', ''[[The Incredible Hulk]]'', the series ''Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' Vols. 1 and 2, and the 1988 miniseries ''Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D.''

==Fictional character biography==
'''Gabriel "Gabe" Jones''' was born in [[New York City]].  He is an original member of the fictional, elite Howling Commandos combat squad of World War II, and the first [[African-American]] to serve in an integrated unit. (The [[U.S. Armed Forces]], in real life, were not integrated until after the war, by executive order of President [[Harry S Truman]].) He is one of the close confidantes of [[Nick Fury]], his sergeant and later the head of the international [[espionage]] organization [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], which Jones joined at some unspecified point after the war. He also served under Fury in reunion misses during the [[Korean Police Action]] and the [[Vietnam War]].

Jones retired from S.H.I.E.L.D. after the events of the ''Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D.'' six-issue miniseries (1988), but returned to help train a new corps of recruits, who were then killed by the [[terrorist]] organization [[HYDRA]], S.H.I.E.L.D.'s primary nemesis.
He also appeared in ''Civil War, New Avengers'', as he leads a cape-killer unit sent to arrest [[Luke Cage]] but is defeated by the arrival of [[Captain America]], Falcon and Daredevil.

==In other media==
Jones appeared in the 1996 animated series ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1996 animated series)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' as a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent working with General [[Thunderbolt Ross]]' "[[Hulkbusters]]" team. He was voiced by actor [[Thom Barry]]. He also appeared in the [[Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. (film)|Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.]] TV-movie as S.H.I.E.L.D.'s top scientist. He was played by [[Ron Canada]].

==Other versions==

===[[Earth X]]===
In this alternate future, Jones has a cameo as one of the dozens of deceased heroes attempting to stop the plans of [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] and [[Thanos]].
