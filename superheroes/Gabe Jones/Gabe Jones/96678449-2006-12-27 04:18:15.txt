==Publication history==
Gabe Jones appeared as a regular cast-member in virtually every issue and annual of ''Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos.''

==Fictional character biography==
'''Gabriel "Gabe" Jones''' is an original member of the fictional, elite Howling Commandos combat squad of World War II, and the first [[African-American]] to serve in an integrated unit. (The [[U.S. Armed Forces]], in real life, were not integrated until after the war, by exeuctive order of President [[Harry S Truman]].) He is one of the close confidantes of [[Nick Fury]], his sergeant and later the head of the international [[espionage]] organization [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], which Jones joined at some unspecified point after the war. He also served under Fury in reunion misses during the [[Korean Police Action]] and the [[Vietnam War]].

Jones retired from S.H.I.E.L.D. after the events of the ''Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D.'' six-issue miniseries (1988), but returned to help train a new corps of recruits, who were then killed by the [[terrorist]] organization [[HYDRA]], S.H.I.E.L.D.'s primary nemesis.

==Trivia==
*Jones is a skilled musician, specializing in the [[trumpet]].
==Other media==
Jones appeared in the 1996 animated series ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1996 animated series)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' as a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent working with General [[Thunderbolt Ross]]' "Hulkbusters" team.
