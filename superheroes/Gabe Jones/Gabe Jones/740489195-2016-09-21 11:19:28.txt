==Publication history==
Gabe Jones appeared as a regular cast-member in virtually every issue and annual of ''Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos.'' In present-day stories, initially in the feature "[[Nick Fury|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]" in ''[[Strange Tales]]'', he appears as an agent of that fictional [[espionage]] organization &mdash; inexplicably aged very little, like fellow World War II vet and agent [[Dum Dum Dugan]], despite a [[retcon]] explanation for agency head [[Nick Fury]]'s youthfulness. As a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent, Jones has appeared in issues of ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'', ''[[Iron Man]]'', ''[[Captain America]]'', ''[[The Incredible Hulk]]'', ''[[Godzilla (comics)#Marvel Comics|Godzilla]]'', the first two volumes of ''Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'', and the 1988 miniseries ''Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D.''

Although colorist Stan Goldberg knew that Jones was African American, the company that made the engraving plates for ''Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos'' #1 thought a mistake had been made and colored him the same color as the rest of the Howling Commandos.<ref>{{cite book |title=Stan Lee's Amazing Marvel Universe |last=Lee |first=Stan |author2=Roy Thomas |year=2006 |publisher=Sterling Publishing |location=New York, New York |isbn=978-1-4027-4225-5 |page = 54 }}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
'''Gabriel "Gabe" Jones''' was born in [[New York City]].  He is an original member of the fictional, elite Howling Commandos combat squad of World War II, and the first [[African-American]] to serve in an integrated unit. (The [[U.S. Armed Forces]], in real life, were not integrated until 1948, by executive order of President [[Harry S Truman]].) He is one of the close confidantes of [[Nick Fury]], his sergeant. He also served under Fury in reunion missions during the [[Korean War]] and the [[Vietnam War]].

Fury later became the head of the international [[espionage]] organization [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], which Jones joined at some unspecified point after the World War II.

In 1959, he is shown working with Dugan and Fury, hunting down and executing Nazis.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 2 #9 (February. 2011)</ref> Later in the same year, Gabe assisted Nicholas Fury and Dugan in creating the first team of Avengers. They successfully stopped a Nazi splinter group from gaining a version of the Super-Soldier formula. This team includes, but is not limited to, Sabretooth, Kraven the Hunter and Ulysses Bloodstone.<ref name="New Avengers">''New Avengers'' (vol. 2) #10, May 2011</ref>

Jones retired from S.H.I.E.L.D. after the events of the ''Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D.'' six-issue miniseries (1988), but returned to help train a new corps of recruits.<ref>''Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' Vol.2 #7</ref> This new class is slain by the [[terrorist]] organization [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]], S.H.I.E.L.D.'s primary nemesis.<ref>''Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' Vol.2 #25</ref>

Gabe spends time trying to bring down the evil [[Secret Empire]] from within.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia|last=DeFalco|first=Tom|year= 2006|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|isbn=978-0-7566-2358-6|page=151}}</ref> Following the events of [[Secret Invasion]] both he and [[Dum Dum Dugan]] quit S.H.I.E.L.D. and recreate the Howling Commandos with ex-S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.<ref>''Secret Warriors'' #4</ref>

Gabriel Jones is seen commanding the murder scene investigation of his old friend [[Clay Quartermain]].<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 2, #4 (June 2008)</ref>

Jones and fellow Commando [[Eric Koenig]] are later killed by [[Gorgon (Tomi Shishido)|Gorgon]] during a battle with HYDRA, while both were fighting a holding action against enemy forces in order to give time for allies to retreat.<ref>''Secret Warriors'' #19 (August 2010)</ref>
