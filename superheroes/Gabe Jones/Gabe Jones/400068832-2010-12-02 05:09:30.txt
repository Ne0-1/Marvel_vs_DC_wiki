'''Gabriel "Gabe" Jones''' is a [[fictional character]] in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[shared universe]], the [[Marvel Universe]].

Fury and his Howling Commandos]]'' #1 (May 1963).

Although colorist Stan Goldberg knew that Jones was African American, the company that made the engraving plates for ''Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos'' #1 thought a mistake had been made and colored him the same color as the rest of the Howling Commandoes.<ref>{{cite book |title=Stan Lee's Amazing Marvel Universe |last=Lee |first=Stan |coauthor=Roy Thomas |year=2006 |publisher=Sterling Publishing |location=New York, New York |isbn=978-1402742255 |page = 54 }}</ref>

==Publication history==
Gabe Jones appeared as a regular cast-member in virtually every issue and annual of ''Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos.'' In present-day stories, initially in the feature "Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D." in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' Vol. 1, he appears as an agent of that fictional [[espionage]] organization &mdash; inexplicably aged very little, like fellow WWII vet and agent [[Dum Dum Dugan]], despite a [[retcon]] explanation for agency head [[Nick Fury]]'s youthfulness. As a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, Jones has appeared in issues of ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'', ''[[Iron Man]]'', ''[[Captain America]]'', ''[[The Incredible Hulk]]'', the first two volumes of ''Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'', and the 1988 miniseries ''Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D.''

==Fictional character biography==
'''Gabriel "Gabe" Jones''' was born in [[New York City]].  He is an original member of the fictional, elite Howling Commandos combat squad of World War II, and the first [[African-American]] to serve in an integrated unit. (The [[U.S. Armed Forces]], in real life, were not integrated until 1948, by executive order of President [[Harry S Truman]].) He is one of the close confidantes of [[Nick Fury]], his sergeant and later the head of the international [[espionage]] organization [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], which Jones joined at some unspecified point after the war. He also served under Fury in reunion missions during the [[Korean War]] and the [[Vietnam War]].

Jones retired from S.H.I.E.L.D. after the events of the ''Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D.'' six-issue miniseries (1988), but returned to help train a new corps of recruits.{{Issue|date=June 2009}} This new class is slain by the [[terrorist]] organization [[HYDRA]], S.H.I.E.L.D.'s primary nemesis.{{Issue|date=June 2009}} Following the events of [[Secret Invasion]] both he and [[Dum Dum Dugan]] quit S.H.I.E.L.D. and recreate the Howling Commandos with ex S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.<ref>''Secret Warriors'' #4</ref> He is later killed by [[Gorgon (Tomi Shishido)|Gorgon]] during a battle with HYDRA.<ref>''Secret Warriors'' #19</ref>
