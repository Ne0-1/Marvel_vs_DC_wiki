'''Rage''' ('''Elvin Daryl Halliday''', sometimes misspelled '''"Holliday"''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[comic book]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He is [[African American]]. Rage was created by [[Larry Hama]] and [[Paul Ryan (comics)|Paul Ryan]] in ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' vol. 1 #326 (November 1990). Rage has been a member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and the [[New Warriors]].

==Publication history==
Rage has appeared in the pages of ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'', ''[[New Warriors]]'', ''[[Night Thrasher (Dwayne Taylor)|Night Thrasher]]'', and ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
At age 13, Elvin Haliday was exposed to toxic waste while hiding from a group of bullies. Returning to his grandmother's home, Elvin was nursed back to health. The chemicals caused Elvin to grow in strength and invulnerability, until he appeared to be a muscular man in his mid-30's. Encouraged by his grandmother to use his new found abilities for good, Elvin adopted a costume and name: '''Rage'''.

===Avengers===
Soon after his transformation, Rage confronted the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] demanding to be made a member. He scolded [[Captain America]] for the team's lack of any black members. Rage left after a brief scuffle, but ended up assisting the Avengers in their next mission. After the team was reorganized under a new [[United Nations]] charter, Rage was invited to join as a probationary member.

After racial tensions escalated due to the machinations of the [[Hate-Monger]], Rage and the [[New Warriors]] battled the [[Sons of the Serpent]]. The Avengers joined the fray, and [[Captain America]] was ultimately able to calm the situation and forced the Hate-Monger to retreat. During the battle, though, it came out that Rage was, in fact, only a teenager. Because of this, Cap told Rage that he could not be an Avenger, but could continue as a trainee if he wished.

===New Warriors===
Rage was dejected with the demotion. He soon helped the New Warriors steal one of the Avengers' [[List of vehicles in Marvel Comics#Quinjet|Quinjet]]s for a mission to [[Cambodia]]. This Quinjet ended up being stolen by the Folding Circle, the very villains the New Warriors had gone off to fight. He was ultimately fired from the Avengers complete with a parting punch in the jaw from [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] himself. About an hour later, he joined the New Warriors as a full member.

During his time with the New Warriors, Elvin's grandmother was killed by a street gang called the Poison Memories, bent on revenge against the team, leaving him an orphan. [[Andrew Chord]], the legal guardian of his teammate [[Night Thrasher (Dwayne Taylor)|Night Thrasher]], became Elvin's legal guardian. For some time, Rage was in legal trouble with the authorities, as he had been accused of murdering Kimeiko Ashu, the leader of the Poison Memories. He was ultimately cleared of all charges with the assistance of Night Thrasher, who later took him to Paris for a memorial service for his grandmother.

Rage was part of the attacking force that traveled to a duplicate Earth on the far side of the moon during the [[Infinity Crusade]]. He teamed up with the X-Men member [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and they were the closest to get to the villain's cathedral headquarters. Unfortunately Rage was swiftly dropped with a nerve pinch by [[Gamora]] and was out for the rest of the battle.

Later, Rage and Night Thrasher were voted out of the New Warriors after they had been absent during the team's battle with the paramilitary group, Undertow, who enslaved teammate [[Namorita]]. After their expulsion from the New Warriors, for a short time, Rage and Night Thrasher acted as mentors to their former foes, [[Psionex]].

Rage and Night Thrasher took it upon themselves to free Namorita from Undertow. After doing so, all three soon returned to the New Warriors. Soon, though, the team began to drift apart and Night Thrasher formally disbanded them.

===Reserve Avenger===
After the New Warriors broke up, Elvin left for boarding school. [[Robbie Baldwin|Speedball]] contacted him to join a new version of the team, but Elvin turned him down, preferring to concentrate on his studies.

Elvin remained inactive as an adventurer and only returned a couple of times when called on as a reserve Avenger. First, he assisted the team against [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fay]] after the heroes returned from the [[Heroes Reborn]] universe. More recently, he assisted them during the [[Avengers Disassembled]] situation.

==="Civil War"===
Rage and former teammate [[Vance Astrovik|Justice]] learn that people are hunting down former New Warriors members because of the deaths<ref>''[[She-Hulk]]'' vol. 2, #8 (July, 2006)</ref> caused by [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]]<ref>''Civil War'' #1</ref>. They both seek out the legal services of [[She-Hulk|Jennifer Walters]] in protecting the allies of the New Warriors. They eventually discover that former New Warriors member [[Hindsight (comics)|Carlton Lafroyge]] (Hindsight Lad) was responsible for the persecution and exposure of their teammates. Hindsight had been operating a website outing the identities of the twenty or so remaining Warriors; he was also operating a [[dead pool]]. When [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]] arrives, he arrests Hindsight. Rage remains on the scene until Jameson asks She-Hulk to marry him. Both Rage and Justice decided to side with Captain America during the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]], and refused to go along with the proposed [[Registration acts (comics)#2006 Superhuman Registration Act|Superhuman Registration Act]]. Rage is seen escaping from the containment van that held those that refused to comply with the Act<ref>''Amazing [[Spider-Man]]'' #534</ref><ref>''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #539</ref>.

===The Initiative===
Sometime later, Rage is seen onboard a bus of new recruits arriving at [[Camp Hammond]]<ref>[[Avengers: The Initiative]] #1</ref>. During his time in the Initiative program, Rage is subjected to constant verbal abuse by [[Gauntlet (comics)|Gauntlet]] about his former teammates, the New Warriors, due to the Stamford tragedy. Rage is among the recruits helping people get to safety during [[World War Hulk]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #4</ref> After witnessing the battle between the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and [[Iron Man]], Rage orders the recruits to follow him and help battle the green gamma monster. However, they only see Hulk and his [[Warbound]] with the defeated Avengers lying at their feet. The recruits are defeated and imprisoned at [[Madison Square Garden]] and fitted with obedience disks to prevent their escape. They are subsequently rescued by the [[Avengers: The Initiative#Shadow Initiative|Shadow Initiative]]. <ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #5</ref> The recruits (except for [[Komodo (comics)|Komodo]], who had obeyed orders not to engage the Hulk) are then subjected to even more verbal abuse and more intense training by Gauntlet as punishment for breaking ranks. Shortly thereafter, Gauntlet is found beaten nearly to death with a New Warriors "NW" scrawled across his chest in his own blood.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative''#6</ref> All former New Warriors members and associates on base are detained for questioning. During the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] investigation, Rage reveals that he had an altercation with Gauntlet the day before the assault and that Gauntlet was about to recommend washing him out of the program and that his powers be removed until he turns 18.

Rage later quits the Initiative along with other New Warriors-associated cadets (Justice, [[Debrii]], [[Slapstick (comics)|Slapstick]], and the remaining [[Michael Van Patrick#Scarlet Spiders|Scarlet Spiders]]) to form Counter Force.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #12</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Elvin's exposure to the radioactive waste gave him superhuman strength and resistance to physical injury. He becomes exponentially stronger with applied force, such as hitting.  Although it is not consistently portrayed in the comics, it appears that at times, Rage has the ability to fly{{issue}}. In his first appearance, Rage was shown outrunning a speeding subway train, but this ability has never been used since.

==Other versions==
===House of M===
Rage appears as a member of the House of M's version of the [[Wolfpack (Marvel Comics)|Wolfpack]] alongside [[Robbie Baldwin|Speedball]], [[Turbo (comics)|Turbo]], [[Alex Power|Zero-G]], [[Darkhawk]], and [[Julie Power|Lightspeed]].<ref>''House of M: Avengers'' #3 & #4</ref>
