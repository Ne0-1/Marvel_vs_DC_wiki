==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
Elvin Daryl Haliday was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]]. At age 13, he was exposed to toxic waste while hiding from a group of bullies. Returning to his grandmother's home, Elvin was nursed back to health. The chemicals caused Elvin to grow in strength and invulnerability, until he appeared to be a muscular man in his mid-30's. Encouraged by his grandmother to use his new found abilities for good, Elvin adopted a costume and name: '''Rage'''.

===Avengers===
Soon after his transformation, Rage confronted the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] demanding to be made a member. He scolded [[Captain America]] for the team's lack of any black members. Rage left after a brief scuffle, but ended up assisting the Avengers in their next mission against L.D.50; alongside the Avengers, he battled other-dimensional alien prisoners.<ref>''Avengers'' #326-328</ref> After the team was reorganized under a new [[United Nations]] charter, Rage was invited to join as a probationary member alongside the [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]]. Alongside the Avengers, he battled [[Ngh]] and the [[Tetrarchs of Entropy]].<ref>''Avengers'' #329-331</ref>

Alongside the Sandman, Rage was shown being trained by Captain America.<ref>''Captain America'' #385</ref> Alongside the Avengers, he battled [[Doctor Doom]], and discovered that this Doom was actually a robot duplicate.<ref name="Avengers #329">''Avengers'' #329</ref> Alongside the Avengers, he battled the [[Brethren (comics)|Brethren]] and the [[Collector (comics)|Collector]].<ref>''Avengers'' #334-339</ref> Alongside the Avengers and [[Mole Man]], he battled Brutus and [[Grotesk (comics)|Grotesk]].<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #20; ''Avengers West Coast Annual'' #6</ref>

After racial tensions escalated due to the machinations of the energy vampire called the [[Hate-Monger#Other versions|Hate-Monger]], Rage and the [[New Warriors]] battled the [[Sons of the Serpent]]. The Avengers joined the fray, and [[Captain America]] was ultimately able to calm the situation and forced the Hate-Monger to retreat. During the battle, though, it came out that Rage was, in fact, only a teenager. Because of this, Cap told Rage that he could not be an Avenger, but could continue as a trainee if he wished.<ref name="Avengers #329"/>

===New Warriors===
Rage was dejected with the demotion. He soon helped the New Warriors and [[Darkhawk]] steal one of the Avengers' [[List of vehicles in Marvel Comics#Quinjet|Quinjet]]s for a mission to [[Cambodia]] to battle Tai and the [[Folding Circle]]. This Quinjet ended up being stolen by the Folding Circle, the very villains the New Warriors had gone off to fight.<ref>''New Warriors'' #22-25</ref> He was ultimately fired from the Avengers complete with a parting punch in the jaw from [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] himself. About an hour later, he joined the New Warriors as a full member, and was given a new costume.<ref>''New Warriors'' #26</ref>

Alongside [[Robbie Baldwin|Speedball]], Rage battled an evil duplicate, and defeated it by absorbing it into himself.<ref>''New Warriors'' #27</ref> Alongside the New Warriors, he battled [[Force of Nature (comics)|Force of Nature]] and the Trans-Saballian army.<ref>''New Warriors'' #29-30</ref> Alongside the New Warriors, [[Spider-Man]], [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]], and [[Doctor Strange]], he battled Darkforce.<ref>''New Warriors'' #32-34; ''New Warriors Annual'' #3</ref>

During his time with the New Warriors, Elvin's grandmother Edna Staples was killed right before his eyes by a street gang called the Poison Memories, bent on revenge against the team, leaving him an orphan. He donned a new costume after that, complete with a metal helmet.<ref>''New Warriors'' #37</ref> [[Andrew Chord]], the legal guardian of his teammate [[Night Thrasher (Dwayne Taylor)|Night Thrasher]], became Elvin's legal guardian.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} For some time, Rage was in legal trouble with the authorities, as he had been accused of murdering Kimeiko Ashu, the leader of the Poison Memories.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} He was ultimately cleared of all charges with the assistance of Night Thrasher,{{Issue|date=April 2009}} who later took him to Paris for a memorial service for his grandmother.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Rage was part of the attacking force that traveled to a duplicate Earth on the far side of the moon during the [[Infinity Crusade]]. He teamed up with the X-Men member [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and they were the closest to get to the villain's cathedral headquarters. Rage was swiftly dropped with a nerve pinch by [[Gamora]] and was out for the rest of the battle.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Later, Rage and Night Thrasher were voted out of the New Warriors after they had been absent during the team's battle with the paramilitary group, Undertow, who enslaved teammate [[Namorita]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}} After their expulsion from the New Warriors, for a short time, Rage and Night Thrasher acted as mentors to their former foes, [[Psionex]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Rage and Night Thrasher took it upon themselves to free Namorita from Undertow.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} After doing so, all three soon returned to the New Warriors.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Soon, though, the team began to drift apart and Night Thrasher formally disbanded them.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

===Reserve Avenger===
After the New Warriors broke up, Elvin left for boarding school.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} [[Robbie Baldwin|Speedball]] contacted him to join a new version of the team, but Elvin turned him down, preferring to concentrate on his studies.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Elvin remained inactive as an adventurer and only returned a couple of times when called on as a reserve Avenger. First, he assisted the team against [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fay]] after the heroes returned from the [[Heroes Reborn]] universe.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} He later assisted them during the [[Avengers Disassembled]] situation.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

==="Civil War"===
Rage and former teammate [[Vance Astrovik|Justice]] learn that people are hunting down former New Warriors members because of the deaths<ref>''[[She-Hulk]]'' vol. 2, #8 (July, 2006)</ref> caused by [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]].<ref>''Civil War'' #1</ref> They both seek out the legal services of [[She-Hulk|Jennifer Walters]] in protecting the allies of the New Warriors. They eventually discover that former New Warriors member [[Hindsight (comics)|Carlton Lafroyge]] (Hindsight Lad) was responsible for the persecution and exposure of their teammates. Hindsight had been operating a website outing the identities of the twenty or so remaining Warriors; he was also operating a [[dead pool]]. When [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]] arrives, he arrests Hindsight. Rage remains on the scene until Jameson asks She-Hulk to marry him. Both Rage and Justice decided to side with Captain America during the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]], and refused to go along with the proposed [[Registration acts (comics)#2006 Superhuman Registration Act|Superhuman Registration Act]]. Rage is seen escaping from the containment van that held those that refused to comply with the Act<ref>''Amazing [[Spider-Man]]'' #534</ref><ref>''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #539</ref>.

===The Initiative===
Sometime later, Rage is seen onboard a bus of new recruits arriving at [[Camp Hammond]]<ref>[[Avengers: The Initiative]] #1</ref>. During his time in the Initiative program, Rage is subjected to constant verbal abuse by [[Gauntlet (comics)|Gauntlet]] about his former teammates, the New Warriors, due to the Stamford tragedy. Rage is among the recruits helping people get to safety during [[World War Hulk]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #4</ref> After witnessing the battle between the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and [[Iron Man]], Rage orders the recruits to follow him and help battle the green gamma monster. However, they only see Hulk and his [[Warbound]] with the defeated Avengers lying at their feet. The recruits are defeated and imprisoned at [[Madison Square Garden]] and fitted with obedience disks to prevent their escape. They are subsequently rescued by the [[Avengers: The Initiative#Shadow Initiative|Shadow Initiative]]. <ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #5</ref> The recruits (except for [[Komodo (comics)|Komodo]], who had obeyed orders not to engage the Hulk) are then subjected to even more verbal abuse and more intense training by Gauntlet as punishment for breaking ranks. Shortly thereafter, Gauntlet is found beaten nearly to death with a New Warriors "NW" scrawled across his chest in his own blood.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative''#6</ref> All former New Warriors members and associates on base are detained for questioning. During the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] investigation, Rage reveals that he had an altercation with Gauntlet the day before the assault and that Gauntlet was about to recommend washing him out of the program and that his powers be removed until he turns 18.

Rage later quits the Initiative along with other New Warriors-associated cadets (Justice, [[Debrii]], [[Slapstick (comics)|Slapstick]], and the remaining [[Michael Van Patrick#Scarlet Spiders|Scarlet Spiders]]) to form Counter Force.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #12</ref> He later returned to Camp Hammond with the team, now calling themselves the New Warriors again,<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #21</ref> and battled [[Ragnarok (comics)|Ragnarok]], the clone of Thor.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #22</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Elvin's exposure to unknown biochemical radioactive wastes gave him superhuman strength, speed, stamina, durability, and resistance to physical injury. He becomes exponentially stronger with applied force, such as hitting.  He is able to use his enhanced strength to leap great distances. In his first appearance, Rage was shown outrunning a speeding subway train, but this ability has not been used again.

Rage possesses basic street-fighting skills, and has received some combat training from [[Captain America]] and [[Night Thrasher (Dwayne Taylor)|Night Thrasher]].

Rage usually wears a costume of synthetic stretch fabric and body armor, and formerly wore a helmet of unspecified material, all of which he designed for himself.

Rage appears as a member of the House of M's version of the [[Wolfpack (Marvel Comics)|Wolfpack]] alongside [[Robbie Baldwin|Speedball]], [[Turbo (comics)|Turbo]], [[Alex Power|Zero-G]], [[Darkhawk]], and [[Julie Power|Lightspeed]].<ref>''House of M: Avengers'' #3 & #4</ref>
