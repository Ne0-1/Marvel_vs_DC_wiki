'''Rage''' (Elvin Haliday, sometimes "Holiday") is a [[fictional character]], a [[comic book]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He is [[African American]]. Rage was created by [[Larry Hama]] and [[Paul Ryan]] in ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' #326 (November 1990). Rage has been a member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and the [[New Warriors]].

==Publication history==
Rage has appeared in the pages of ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'', ''[[New Warriors]]'', and ''[[Night Thrasher]]''.

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
At age 13, Elvin Haliday was exposed to toxic waste while hiding from a group of bullies. Returning to his grandmother's home, Elvin was nursed back to health. The chemicals caused Elvin to grow in strength and invulnerability, until he appeared to be a muscular man in his mid-30's. Encouraged by his grandmother to use his new found abilities for good, Elvin adopted a costume and name: '''Rage'''.

===Avengers===
Soon after his transformation, Rage confronted the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] demanding to be made a member. He scolded [[Captain America]] for the team's lack of any black members. Rage left after a brief scuffle. But Rage ended up assisting the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in their next mission. After the team was reorganized under a new [[United Nations]] charter, Rage was invited to join as a probationary member.

After racial tensions escalated due to the machinations of the [[Hate-Monger]], Rage and the [[New Warriors]] battled the [[Sons of the Serpent]]. The [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] joined the fray, but [[Captain America]] was ultimately able to calm the situation and forced the [[Hate-Monger]] to retreat. During the battle, though, it came out that Rage was, in fact, only a teenager. Because of this, Cap told Rage that he could not be an [[Avengers (comics)|Avenger]], but could continue as a trainee if he wished.

===New Warriors===
Rage was dejected with the demotion. He soon helped the [[New Warriors]] steal one of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers']] [[Quinjet]]s for one of their mission and was ultimately fired from the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] for that indiscretion. He soon joined the [[New Warriors]] as a full member.

During his time with the [[New Warriors]] Elvin's grandmother was killed by a street gang, leaving him an orphan. [[Andrew Chord]], the legal guardian of his teammate [[Night Thrasher]], became Elvin's legal guardian.

Later, Rage and [[Night Thrasher]] were voted out of the [[New Warriors]] after they had been absent during the team's battle with the paramilitary group, Undertow, who enslaved teammate [[Namorita]]. After their expulsion from the [[New Warriors]], for a short time, Rage and [[Night Thrasher]] acted as mentors to their former foes, [[Psionex]].

Rage and [[Night Thrasher]] took it upon themselves to free [[Namorita]] from Undertow. After doing so, all three were soon back with the [[New Warriors]]. Soon, though, the team began to drift apart and [[Night Thrasher]] formally disbanded them.

===Reserve Avenger===
After the [[New Warriors]] broke up, Elvin left for boarding school. [[Speedball]] contacted him to join a new version of the team, but Elvin turned him down, preferring to concentrate on his studies.

Elvin remained inactive as an adventurer and only returned a couple of times when called on as a reserve [[Avengers (comics)|Avenger]]. First, he assisted the team against [[Morgan le Fay]] after the heroes returned from the [[Heroes Reborn]] universe. More recently, he assisted them during the [[Avengers Disassembled]] situation.

==="Civil War"===
{{main|Civil War (comics)}}
In ''[[She-Hulk]]'' (2nd series) #8 (July, 2006), Rage and former teammate [[Justice (comics)|Justice]] learned that people were hunting down former New Warriors members because of the deaths caused by [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]] in ''Civil War'' #1. They both sought out the legal services of Jennifer Walters (She-Hulk) in protecting the allies of the New Warriors. They eventually discovered that former New Warriors member Carlton Lafroyge, aka [[Hindsight Lad]] was responsible for the persecution and exposure of their teammates. Hindsight operated a website outing the identities of the twenty or so remaining Warriors; he was also operating a [[death pool]]. When [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]] arrived, he arrested Hindsight Lad and Rage remained on the scene until Jameson asked She-Hulk to marry him. Both Rage and Justice have apparently decided to side with [[Captain America]], and have refused to go along with the proposed super-human registration act. In both ''Amazing [[Spider-Man]]'' #534 and ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #539, Rage was seen escaping from the containment van that held those that refused to comply with the Superhuman Registration Act.

==Powers and abilities==
Elvin's exposure to the radioactive waste gave him superhuman strength and resistance to physical injury. He becomes exponentially stronger with applied force, such as hitting.  Although it is not consistently portrayed in the comics, it appears that at times, Rage has the ability to fly. In his first appearance, Rage was shown outrunning a speeding subway train, but this ability has never been used since.
