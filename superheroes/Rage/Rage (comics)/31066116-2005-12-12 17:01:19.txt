Rage (Elvin Daryl Haliday) is a [[fictional character]]. He started his [[superhero]] career as an [[Avenger]], but was kicked out when they discovered he was only 13 years old. He then joined up with the [[New Warriors]] and has been under the watchful eye of his mentor/guardian [[Night Thrasher]]. Sometime between New Warriors vol. 1 and 2, he broke away from Night Thrasher and the New Warriors, and now attends a boarding school for boys.

His massive body provides him with super strength and resistance to physical injury. While he is extremely strong while simply lifting or pressing objects, he becomes exponentially stronger with applied force, such as hitting.
