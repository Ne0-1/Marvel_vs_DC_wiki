The 1994 [[Iron Man (animated series)|''Iron Man'' animated series]] was part of the ''Marvel Action Hour'', which packaged several animated versions of Marvel series with two half-hour episodes from different series.

Hypnotia has what has been described as [[telepathic]] [[hypnosis]]. Though being of normal human physical capacity, her mental abilities are quite powerful. In the show, her power is a series of concetric (usually yellow) rings coming from her forehead, hands, eyes, etc. This power effectively and almost immediately mesmerizes her victims, and leaves them obedient to her will. In some cases, such as with animals, evidence of her power can be seen with yellow swirls within an animals eyes. The limits to her power have not been seen yet, though she has displayed how potent her power is when hypnotizing an entire group of villagers in seconds claiming "My spell has secured the villagers for 24 hours." She can even leave her power on previously made recordings. In Episode 7, ''Origin of the Mandarin'', after the brief Mandarin biography, Hypnotia extended her power though the projection device in what she called 'Delay Action Hypnotism', entrancing anyone who happened to be watching.
