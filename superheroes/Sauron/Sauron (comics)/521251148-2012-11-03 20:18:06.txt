'''Sauron''' is a [[comic book]] [[Character (arts)|character]], a [[supervillain]] in [[Marvel Comics]]' main [[Shared universe|shared]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. An enemy of the [[X-Men]], the character was created by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and artist [[Neal Adams]]. He first fully appeared as Sauron in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' #60 (September 1969).

Sauron is the [[alter ego]] of '''Karl Lykos,''' sharing a [[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde|Jekyll and Hyde]] relationship with the [[physician]]. He is an [[energy vampire]] who resembles a [[humanoid]] ''[[Pteranodon]]'' after feeding. He often inhabits the hidden prehistoric jungle of the [[Savage Land]].

==Creation and conception==
He was created in response to the [[Comics Code Authority]]'s prohibition on the use of [[werewolf|werewolves]]: instead of becoming a werewolf, '''Karl Lykos''' (whose name is a deliberate reference to [[lycanthropy]]) becomes a were-[[pteranodon]].<ref>[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article6892313.ece?token=null&offset=60&page=6 Timesonline.co.uk article]</ref> In this form, he is an [[energy vampire]] who often inhabits the hidden prehistoric jungle of the [[Savage Land]].

==Fictional character biography==
Karl Lykos was the son of an explorer's guide. As a teenager, he accompanied his father to [[Tierra del Fuego]] as the elder Lykos guided a wealthy client named Mr. Anderssen and Anderssen's young daughter, Tanya. While defending Tanya from mutant pterodactyls, Karl was bitten by one of the creatures. During his recovery, he discovered that he could now drain the life-force of other organisms. He found himself repeatedly tempted to use his new power, feeling that he needed to drain life energy from other humans or animals to survive.<ref name="X-Men' 1969">revealed in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' vol. 1 #60 (September 1969)</ref>

When Karl's father died, Mr. Anderssen took Karl into his home in thanks for rescuing Tanya. As the years passed, Karl and Tanya fell in love. But Tanya's wealthy father would not allow her to date Karl because of his lack of wealth. In an effort to win Mr. Anderssen's support, Karl went to medical school and became a physician, geneticist, and hypnotherapist. He treated patients through hypnosis, but secretly robbed them of energy at the same time.<ref name="X-Men' 1969"/>

Dr. Lykos became a colleague of [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]], and first encountered the X-Men when they sought treatment for [[Havok (comics)|Havok]]. When Lykos absorbed energy from Havok, there was a horrible side-effect: he transformed into a vampiric, pterodactyl-like monster with human intelligence and superhuman hypnotic powers. He named himself Sauron, after [[Sauron|J.R.R. Tolkien's villain]] (also reminiscent of the word ''saurus'', [[Latin]] for lizard),<ref>''X-Men'' #60 (September 1969)</ref> and battled the X-Men, as a would-be conqueror.<ref name="X-Men #61 October 1969">''X-Men'' #61 (October 1969)</ref> When he realized that his transformation would threaten Tanya, he fled to [[Tierra del Fuego]]. Without energy to absorb, Sauron turned back into Karl. When Tanya tracked him down, Karl threw himself off a cliff to avoid harming her.<ref name="X-Men #61 October 1969"/>

Presumed dead, Karl actually survived, merely unconscious on a ledge below. He journeyed to the [[Savage Land]] and survived in human form by only draining less developed animals. He befriended [[Ka-Zar]] and used his medical skills over many months to care for Ka-Zar's allies. But when several X-Men were stranded in the Savage Land, Lykos was overwhelmed with the desire to absorb the powerful life energy of mutants. He transformed into Sauron once again after absorbing [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]]'s energy.<ref>''X-Men'' #114 (October 1978)</ref> He reverted back to human form during a battle with the X-Men, and Ka-Zar explained that Lykos was an ally.<ref>''X-Men'' #115 (November 1978)</ref>

A notable appearance was in the first story arc of the series ''[[Marvel Fanfare]]'' (1982), written by Chris Claremont. In that story, Tanya learned that Karl had survived the leap from the cliff. She joined [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] and [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] on a journey to find Karl in the Savage Land. They found Karl, however Angel, Spider-Man and Tanya were all mutated into animal-like forms—Spider-Man becoming the Man-Spider, while Tanya reverted to a Neanderthal form and Angel became part bird—as a result of the [[Savage Land Mutates]]' use of a Genetic Transformer on them. The destruction of the machine forced Lykos to drain energy from the three in an attempt to restore their true forms. Although his gambit succeeded, he subsequently reverted to his Sauron form and joined the Mutates and [[Zaladane]]. The X-Men traveled to the Savage Land, and Sauron helped to capture them. However, the X-Men escaped and defeated Sauron and the Mutates. They brought Lykos back to the United States, and at the [[X-Mansion]] Professor X seemingly cured Lykos of his condition. Karl and Tanya decided to resume their relationship and a normal life.<ref>''Marvel Fanfare'' #2-4</ref>

However, Lykos was again transformed into Sauron when the [[Toad (comics)|Toad]] used a machine to drain Tanya Andersson's life force into Lykos. Sauron then joined the Toad's [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], despite the fact that he is not actually a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] himself. Alongside them, he battled [[X-Force]], and slew [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]], who later revived. Sauron was apparently shot dead by [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], and his body was thrown by Cable to the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]].<ref>''X-Force'' #5-11 (December 1991-June 1992)</ref> Sauron was later revealed to have survived the gunshot wound, and battled [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #82</ref> Sauron went on to menace the X-Men and other heroes on a number of occasions.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Sauron became a prisoner of the Weapon X program jumpstarted by director [[Malcolm Colcord]]. Being held there against his will, Sauron started up a revolution with fellow agent [[Brent Jackson]] and dethroned Colcord as director, giving that position to Jackson. Sauron in return became a more powerful villain on the team, but vanished after Weapon X rival [[Sublime (Marvel Comics)|John Sublime]] launched an attack on Weapon X, and the group had to go underground.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

After being imprisoned in the Raft for refusing to participate in any more Weapon X assignments, Sauron escaped during a jailbreak concocted by the Skrulls. For a time the Avengers believed he and the Mutates were responsible for the breakout, and pursued him to the Savage Land.<ref>''[[Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' #5</ref> Sauron and his allies there briefly held the new team of Avengers hostage, but the team freed itself thanks to [[Iron Man]]'s voice-activated armor, and were about to interrogate him, when he was shot through the head by the second [[Black Widow (Yelena Belova)|Black Widow]]. Fortunately for Sauron, he had absorbed [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]'s regenerative healing factor and recovered from his injury, just in time to be soundly defeated by the New Avengers. He was taken back into custody, but not before returning the favor to Black Widow by burning her with his fiery breath. Sauron was placed in [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody and [[Maria Hill]] plans to return him to [[Weapon X]].<ref name="NE6">''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' #6</ref>

In the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline, Sauron allied with Ka-Zar, [[Shanna the She-Devil]], [[Zabu]], and the natives when the Skrulls were invading the Savage Land.<ref>New Avengers #41</ref> Following the "Secret Invasion", Sauron was among the villains analyzed by [[Quasimodo (comics)|Quasimodo]] for [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]].<ref>''Dark Reign Files''</ref>

Sauron later had a fight with Wolverine.<ref>''Rampaging Wolverine'' #1</ref>

Amphibius later tells Sauron and the other Savage Land Mutates that Magneto's Asteroid M has risen from the sea, but they didn't want to go find him. Worm took control of Barbarus, Lupo, and Sauron and commandeered a ship to go find Magneto. When threatened by the Japanese military, Sauron attacked an armored car causing an international incident. Cannonball, Sunspot, and Warlock investigated and found the Savage Land Mutates on the deck of the ship. Cannonball fought Sauron in the skies while Karma discovered that the Savage Land Mutates were immune to her powers of psychic persuasion. Cannonball managed to defeat Sauron while the other New Mutants defeated the Savage Land Mutates. Upon learning why the Savage Land Mutates were on the ship, Karma told Worm, Sauron, Barbarus, and Lupo that they were in charge of Asteroid M and Magneto. Worm then orders the Savage Land Mutates to return to the Savage Land.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 4 #10</ref>

Upon becoming the new leader of the Japanese underworld, Sabretooth held a party that Sauron attended with other enemies of Wolverine. Wolverine arrived and beat them up.<ref>''Wolverine'' #304</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
In human form Karl Lykos is a normal human, although an accomplished medical doctor, geneticist, and psychotherapist employing hypnotism; he possesses an M.D. and Ph. D.s in genetics and psychology.

As the result of mutation through infection with a genetic virus by mutant pteranodons, Lykos gained the ability to absorb the life forces of other living things into his body. When Lykos absorbs the energies of superhuman mutants, he transforms into Sauron, and gains a portion of that mutant's powers temporarily. Lykos' Sauron form resembles a large crested pteranodon, extinct except in the Savage Land. Unlike true pteranodons, Sauron has a toothed beak and red eyes and a basically humanoid build, with legs as long as a human being's. Sauron has a wingspread of twelve feet, and razor-sharp claws on his hands and feet. In Sauron form he has superhuman strength and durability and is capable of flight. Sauron has to absorb the life energies from living victims to sustain his life; he would revert to human form if he didn't regularly absorb the life force from superhuman beings. The Toad's technology could transform Lykos into Sauron by draining life energy from Tayna Andersson, who is apparently not superhuman.

Lykos also has a powerful hypnotic ability that requires direct eye contact to complete. He frequently uses his hypnotic power to give his victims terrifying delusions that allies have become monsters. He can also mentally enslave people to do his bidding, although his control is not perfect, as [[Portal (comics)|Portal]] is resistant to his commands.

Due to manipulation by the Weapon X program, Sauron can expel the life force energy in concussive bursts from his hands.<ref>''New Avengers: Most Wanted Files'' (2005)</ref>

At some point prior to his New Avengers appearances, he acquires an additional ability to breathe fire, which he uses to burn the second Black Widow in revenge for shooting him.<ref name="NE6" />

==Other versions==
===''Age of Apocalypse''===
In ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'', Sauron, redubbed '''Soaron''' is a more heroic figure, though he is extremely bad-tempered and reclusive, and he is never seen in human form. He is a member of [[Forge (comics)|Forge]]'s group of Outcasts alongside Forge, [[Toad (comics)|Toad]], [[Sunder (comics)|Brute]], [[Siryn|Sonique]], [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]] and [[Nate Grey]]. The group traveled the countryside posing as a circus troupe, protected by Mastermind's illusions, in order to keep attention away from them while Forge trained Nate. Soaron would often make sarcastic remarks about the situations the group found themselves in, and constantly referred to Nate as a "whelp". In a mission where the group rescued a large number of humans from a prison train, one of Soaron's wings was seared off, grounding him. He bitterly remarked about this to Forge later, demanding to know if his wing was enough reason to avoid suicidal missions.<ref>''X-Man'' #1</ref> When [[Domino (comics)|Domino]] and her team attacked the group, Soaron was noticeably absent, but after Nate went to challenge [[Mister Sinister]], who had been hiding with the team attempting to manipulate Nate, Soaron and Sonique, the only survivors, arrived on the scene to save the young mutant. Nate accepted that he must challenge Apocalypse, and told Soaron to look after Sonique. Soaron replied by somewhat fondly advising him, "don't concern yourself with us, just worry about yourself, whelp."<ref>''X-Man'' #3</ref>

When the Age of Apocalypse was revisited, Soaron appeared along with Sonique, [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]], [[Blob (comics)|Blob]], and a revived [[Jean Grey]] as a member of Sinister's team known as the [[Sinister Six]], a group meant to aid Sinister in destroying the X-Men.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Sinister found both Soaron and Sonique, and with Jean Grey's assistance, brainwashed them into becoming members of his new team - the Sinister Six. When the Sinister Six met the X-Men in battle, Soaron failed in his attempt to kill [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. At the last moment, [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] prevented his father's death by sacrificing himself. Enraged at the sight of his dead son, Magneto used his powers to thrust the [[Silver Samurai]]'s sword straight through Soaron.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

===''House of M''===
In ''[[House of M]]'', Sauron became a member of Magneto's palace guard on Genosha. He takes part in the battle against the heroes whose memories have been restored.<ref>''House of M'' #7</ref>

===Power Pack (Marvel Adventures)===
In the mini-series ''Wolverine and [[Power Pack#Marvel Adventures|Power Pack]]'', Sauron was the first villain faced by Logan and the Power children. The kids would have succumbed to Sauron's mind control without Wolverine's assistance.<ref>''Wolverine and Power Pack'' #1</ref>
