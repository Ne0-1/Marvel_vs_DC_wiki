'''Sauron''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  He is an energy [[vampire]] who resembles a [[humanoid]] [[pterodactyl]]. The character first appeared in ''X-Men'' (Vol.1) #59, but only in human form. In the following issue he appeared as Sauron. 

==Character biography==
Sauron was originally [[psychiatrist]] Karl Lykos before being bitten by a mutant pterodactyl.  He was transformed into a vampiric dinosaur-like creature, and named himself Sauron, after [[Sauron|J.R.R. Tolkien's villain]] (also reminiscent of the word saurus, latin for lizard).  He menaced the [[X-Men]] and [[Ka-Zar]] numerous times (even when he was with the [[Savage Land Mutates]]), and at one point joined the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], despite the fact that he is not actually a [[Mutant (fictional)|mutant]] himself.

He recently appeared in ''[[Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' #5, in which he held the team hostage when they came to the [[Savage Land]]. The team then freed itself, and were about to interrogate him, when he was shot through the nose by nearby villains. Fortunately, for Lykos he has absorbed Wolverine's regenerative healing factor and recovered from his injuries, just in time to be soundly defeated by the New Avengers and taken back into custody but not before returning the favor to Black Widow by burning her with his flame breath.

A notable appearance was in the premiere title, Marvel Fanfare (1982), written by Chris Claremont, spanning issues one and two, in which [[Archangel (comics)|Angel]] became a giant bird and [[Spider-Man]] became Man-Spider.

==Powers and abilities==
In human form Karl Lykos is fairly typical, but in pterodactyl form he is superhumanly strong and possesses the ability to fly at a natural winged flight limit. He also has the ability to absorb the life forces of other living things to sustain himself and if he absorbs the life force of a mutant he will absorb a fraction of their powers temporarilly. He also has Fire-Breath in which he used to burn the second Black Widow when she shot him in the head.


==Apearance in other Media==
Sauron became a major villian in the [[X-men animated series]] after they first visited the Savage Land.
