'''Sauron''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  He is an energy [[vampire]] who resembles a [[humanoid]] [[pterodactyl]].

Sauron was originally [[psychiatrist]] Karl Lykos before being bitten by a mutant pterodactyl.  He was transformed into a vampiric dinosaur-like creature, and named himself Sauron, after [[Sauron|J.R.R. Tolkien's villain]].  He menaced the [[X-Men]] and [[Ka-Zar]] numerous times, and at one point joined the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], despite the fact that he is not actually a [[mutant]] himself.
