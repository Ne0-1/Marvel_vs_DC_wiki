'''Sauron''' is a [[comic book]] [[Character (arts)|character]], a [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], appearing as an enemy of the [[X-Men]]. Created by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and artist [[Neal Adams]], he first fully appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' #60 ([[1969#September|September 1969]]).

Sauron is the [[alter ego]] of '''Karl Lykos,''' sharing a [[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]] relationship with the [[physician]]. He is an [[energy vampire]] who resembles a [[humanoid]] [[Pterosaur|pteranodon]] after feeding. He often inhabits the hidden prehistoric jungle the [[Savage Land]]. 

==Fictional character biography==
Karl Lykos was the son of an explorer's guide. As a teenager, he accompanied his father to [[Tierra del Fuego]] as the elder Lykos guided a wealthy client named Mr. Anderssen and Anderssen's young daughter, Tanya. While defending Tanya from mutant pterodactyls, Karl was bitten by one of the creatures. During his recovery, he discovered that he could now drain the life-force of other organisms. He found himself repeatedly tempted to use his new power, feeling that he needed to drain life energy from other humans or animals to survive.<ref>''X-Men'' #60 (September 1969)</ref>

When Karl's father died, Mr. Anderssen took Karl into his home in thanks for rescuing Tanya. As the years passed, Karl and Tanya fell in love. But Tanya's wealthy father would not allow her to date Karl because of his lack of wealth. In an effort to win Mr. Anderssen's support, Karl went to medical school and became a physician. He treated patients through hypnosis, but secretly robbed them of energy at the same time.<ref>''X-Men'' #60 (September 1969)</ref>  

Dr. Lykos became a colleague of [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]], and first encountered the X-Men when they sought treatment for [[Havok (X-Men)|Havok]]. When Lykos absorbed energy from Havok, there was a horrible side-effect: he transformed into a vampiric, pterodactyl-like monster with human intelligence and superhuman hypnotic powers. He named himself Sauron, after [[Sauron|J.R.R. Tolkien's villain]] (also reminiscent of the word ''saurus'', [[Latin]] for lizard),<ref>''X-Men'' #60 (September 1969)</ref> and battled the X-Men.<ref>''X-Men'' #61 (October 1969)</ref> But when he realized that his transformation would threaten Tanya, he fled to [[Tierra del Fuego]]. Without energy to absorb, Sauron turned back into Karl. When Tanya tracked him down, Karl threw himself off a cliff to avoid harming her.<ref>''X-Men'' #61 (October 1969)</ref>

Presumed dead, Karl actually survived, merely unconscious on a ledge below. He journeyed to the [[Savage Land]] and survived in human form by only draining less developed animals. He befriended [[Ka-Zar]] and used his medical skills over many months to care for Ka-Zar's allies. But when several X-Men were stranded in the Savage Land, Lykos was overwhelmed with the desire to absorb the powerful life energy of mutants. He transformed into Sauron once again after absorbing [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]]'s energy. He reverted back to human form during a battle with the X-Men, and Ka-Zar explained that Lykos was an ally.<ref>''X-Men'' #115 (November 1978)</ref>

A notable appearance was in the first story arc of the series ''[[Marvel Fanfare]]'' (1982), written by Chris Claremont. In that story, Tanya learned that Karl had survived the leap from the cliff. She joined [[Angel (Marvel Comics)|Angel]] and [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] on a journey to find Karl in the Savage Land. Unfortunately, he had reverted to his Sauron form and joined the [[Savage Land Mutates]]. The X-Men traveled to the Savage Land and defeated Sauron and the Mutates. They brought Lykos back to the United States, and at the [[X-Mansion]] Professor X seemingly cured Lykos of his condition. Karl and Tanya decided to resume their relationship and a normal life. 

Unfortunately, Lykos was again transformed into Sauron and joined the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], despite the fact that he is not actually a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] himself.<ref>''X-Force'' #5 (December 1991)</ref> Sauron went on to menace the X-Men and other heroes on a number of occasions.

Sauron became a prisoner of the recent Weapon X program jumpstarted by director [[Malcolm Colcord]]. Being held there against his will, Sauron started up a revolution with fellow agent [[Brent Jackson]] and dethroned Colcord as director, giving that position to Jackson. Sauron in return became a more powerful villain on the team, but vanished after Weapon X rival [[Sublime (comics)|John Sublime]] launched an attack on Weapon X, and the group had to go underground.

Sauron held the new team of Avengers hostage when they came to the [[Savage Land]]<ref>''[[Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' #5</ref>; his colleagues had recently hired [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] to break him out of the supervillain prison he'd been sent to, and the New Avengers had gone to the Savage Land to confront him about the forty-one other escapees. The team freed itself thanks to [[Iron Man]]'s voice-activated armour, and were about to interrogate him, when he was shot through the head by the second [[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)#Yelena Belova|Black Widow]]. Fortunately for Sauron, he had absorbed [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]'s regenerative healing factor and recovered from his injury, just in time to be soundly defeated by the New Avengers. He was taken back into custody, but not before returning the favor to Black Widow by burning her with his fiery breath. Sauron was placed in [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody and [[Maria Hill]] plans to return him to Weapon X.

In the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline, Sauron allied with Ka-Zar, [[Shanna the She-Devil]], [[Zabu]], and the natives when the Skrulls were invading the Savage Land.<ref>New Avengers #41</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
In human form Karl Lykos is fairly typical, except he keeps his ability to absorb the life forces of other living things to sustain himself. This often triggers his transformation into his pterodactyl form. If he absorbs the life force of a mutant he will absorb a portion of their powers temporarily. Due to manipulation by the Weapon X program, Sauron can expel the life force energy in concussive bursts from his hands. 

In pterodactyl form he is superhumanly strong  and is capable of flight. In battle, Sauron has several additional weapons: a lethal beak and sharp talons on his hands and feet. 

At some point prior to his New Avengers appearances, he acquires an additional ability to breathe fire, which he uses to burn the second Black Widow in revenge for shooting him. 

He also has a powerful hypnotic ability that requires direct eye contact to complete. He frequently uses his hypnotic power to give his victims terrifying delusions that allies have become monsters.  He can also mentally enslave people to do his bidding, although his control is not perfect, as [[Portal (comics)|Portal]] is resistant to his commands.

==Other versions==
==="Age of Apocalypse"===
In "[[Age of Apocalypse]]", Sauron, redubbed '''Soaron''' is a more heroic figure, though he is extremely bad-tempered and reclusive, and he is never seen in human form. He is a member of [[Forge (comics)|Forge's]] group of Outcasts alongside Forge, [[Toad (comics)|Toad]], [[Sunder (comics)|Brute]], [[Siryn|Sonique]], [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]] and [[Nate Grey]]. The group traveled the countryside posing as a circus troupe, protected by Mastermind's illusions, in order to keep attention away from them while Forge trained Nate. Soaron would often make sarcastic remarks about the situations the group found themselves in, and constantly referred to Nate as a "whelp". In a mission where the group rescued a large number of humans from a prison train, one of Soaron's wings was seared off, grounding him. He bitterly remarked about this to Forge later, demanding to know if his wing was enough reason to avoid suicidal missions. When [[Domino (comics)|Domino]] and her team attacked the group, Soaron was noticeably absent, but after Nate went to challenge [[Mister Sinister]], who had been hiding with the team attempting to manipulate Nate, Soaron and Sonique, the only survivors, arrived on the scene to save the young mutant. Nate accepted that he must challenge Apocalypse, and told Soaron to look after Sonique. Soaron replied by somewhat fondly advising him, "don't concern yourself with us, just worry about yourself, whelp."{{issue}}

When the Age of Apocalypse was revisited, Soaron appeared along Sonique, [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]], [[Blob (comics)|Blob]], and a revived [[Jean Grey]] as a member of Sinister's team known as the [[Sinister Six]], a group meant to aid Sinister in destroying the X-Men.{{issue}}

Sinister found both Soaron and Sonique, and forced Jean Grey to brainwash them into becoming members of his team. When the Sinister Six met the X-Men in battle, Soaron failed in an attempt to kill [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. At the last moment, [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] prevented his father's death by sacrificing himself. Enraged at the sight of his dead son, Magneto used his powers to thrust the [[Silver Samurai]]'s sword straight through Soaron.{{issue}}

===''House of M''===
In ''[[House of M]]'', Sauron became a member of Magneto's palace guard on Genosha. He takes part in the battle against the heroes whose memories have been restored.{{issue}}

===Power Pack (Marvel Adventures)===
In the mini-series ''Wolverine and [[Power Pack#Marvel Adventures|Power Pack]]'', Sauron was the first villain faced by Logan and the Power children. The kids would have succumbed to Sauron's mind control without Wolverine's assistance.<ref>''Wolverine and Power Pack'' #1</ref>
