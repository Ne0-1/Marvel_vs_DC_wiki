'''Killer Shrike''' ('''Simon Maddicks''') is a fictional character, a [[Marvel Comics]] supervillain.  He first appeared in ''[[Rampaging Hulk]]'' #1 (January 1977) and was created by [[John Warner (comics)|John Warner]] and [[John Buscema]]

==Fictional character biography==
'''Simon Maddicks''' was born in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]]. He began his career as a soldier in the United States Army. However, after that, not even Maddicks recalls much about his own past for some reason. When he was selected to be a special agent of the [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon Oil Company]], Maddicks became a mercenary and professional criminal, more specifically a special agent in covert operations. He was sent to the Mutagenics Laboratory of the Brand Corporation, where he underwent extensive conditioning which increased his human abilities. He also underwent surgery which implanted a miniature anti-gravity generator in his spine. Roxxon later gave Maddicks his super-villain costume and the codename "Killer Shrike".

For his first mission, Roxxon sent him to infiltrate the subversive organization called the [[Conspiracy (comics)|Conspiracy]], which Roxxon learned about through major purchases of technology from the Brand Corporation. The Conspiracy sent Killer Shrike to capture a monster known as Goram. Unfortunately for Killer Shrike, the plan was thwarted by the super-hero known as [[Ulysses Bloodstone]] who short-circuited the villain's electrical weapons, badly injuring him. Feeling sorry for Killer Shrike's condition, Bloodstone's agents sent the villain to a New York hospital, where he lay comatose for several weeks.<ref>''Rampaging Hulk'' #1-2</ref>

Upon awakening from the coma, Maddicks was contacted once again by Brand scientists, led by Dr. Stephen Weems. Weems, better known as the villain [[Modular Man]], sought revenge against his enemies [[Spider-Man]] and [[Beast (comics)|Beast]]. In return, the Modular Man promised Shrike information about his past.<ref>''Rampaging Hulk'' #4-5</ref> In battle with Spider-Man and the Beast, Weems was killed before he could uphold his end of the bargain.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #90</ref> Shrike escaped and was soon contacted by agents of the Brand Corporation. They helped restore his memory, and assigned him to undercover work as bodyguard to Brand president James Melvin. His costume became controlled by the [[Will O' The Wisp (comics)|Will-o'-the-Wisp]], and he was forced to abduct Dr. Marla Madison to reconstitute the immaterial Wisp. In the end, he was defeated by [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #57</ref> With Brand's public dissolution, Killer Shrike became a free agent.

With other superhuman adventurers and criminals, Killer Shrike was later captured and imprisoned by the [[Locksmith (comics)|Locksmith]]. He was freed by [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]].<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #50</ref> He later robbed a bank, but was defeated by Spider-Man.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #102</ref> He then attempted a theft of a power booster from the [[Tinkerer]] after commissioning him to build it for him, but was again defeated both by Spider-Man and a failsafe function the Tinkerer installs in his products to deal with such situations.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #310</ref>

During the events of the "[[Acts of Vengeance]]," Killer Shrike attacked [[Moon Knight]], alongside the second [[Ringer (comics)#Keith Kraft|Ringer]] and [[Coachwhip (comics)|Coachwhip]]. He shot down the [[List of vehicles in Marvel Comics#Moon Knight's Helicopter|Mooncopter]], seriously injuring Moon Knight's pilot Frenchie and then escaped.<ref>''Moon Knight'' Vol. 3 #10</ref> Killer Shrike was later hired by Surge, and battled the [[She-Hulk]] alongside [[Grey Gargoyle]] and [[Dragon Man]] but was defeated.<ref>''Sensational She-Hulk'' #27</ref> 

Ever since, Killer Shrike was most often seen getting beaten up by several super-heroes, most often the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]. Killer Shrike was briefly a member of the Cardinal's team of flying super villains known as Air Force. Killer Shrike was oddly absent when the team was blackmailed by [[Night Thrasher]] into providing relief for Rwandan refugees. In ''New Warriors'' #54 Killer Shrike appears to have been murdered by the Soldiers of Misfortune. This was probably an art error as Oriole not Killer Shrike was with the team when blackmailed by Night Thrasher.

In the [[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]] miniseries, Killer Shrike's powers got updated by the Tinkerer. Unfortunately, this still wasn't enough for Maddicks to gain a victory, as he was soon afterward defeated by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], and apprehended by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]].

Killer Shrike was later apprehended by [[Baron Zemo]] and forced to join the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], for so far unclear reasons.

Killer Shrike later made a cameo at the Bar With No Name.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #589</ref>

Killer Shrike was beat up by Moon Knight and killed in the hospital by the [[Black Spectre#Black Spectre (Carson Knowles)|Black Spectre]].{{Issue|date=December 2009}}

==Powers and abilities==
Extensive conditioning and surgery by Brand Corporation scientists enhanced Simon Maddicks's strength and other physical abilities. He is capable of flight by means of a surgically-implanted anti-gravity generator at the base of his spine, activated by a neural link. Besides that, he has extensive training and experience in hand-to-hand combat and martial arts, and proficiency with hand weapons including guns and knives.

Killer Shrike wears body armor, an armored suit made of an insulated steel alloy mesh capable of protecting him from flight turbulence and small caliber weapons fire. His major weapons system is the twin power-blasters worn on his wrists, with titanium talons capable of slashing flesh, wood, cinderblock, and light metals, and of discharging high-frequency electrical bolts.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Killer Shrike===
The Ultimate form of Killer Shrike made a cameo in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' #72, trying to rob [[Roxxon Energy Corporation]] Industries of their supply of Adamantium - but was apprehended by Spider-Man. This version was a deranged, desperate man who seemed to almost [[froth]] at the mouth; Spider-Man himself referred to him as 'Steroid-Boy with a Laser Tag Fetish'. It was later revealed that he was an employee of the Ultimate [[Tinkerer]] hired specifically to bother Donald Roxxon as vengeance for firing him.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Killer Shrike appears in the ''[[Iron Man: Armored Adventures]]'' episode "Secrets and Lies" voiced by [[Ty Olsson]]. In this version, he appears as an enforcer for the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] with his anti-gravity generator on his wrist-blasters. Along with [[Unicorn (comics)|Unicorn]], he kidnaps [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]], [[Pepper Potts]], and [[Mandarin (comics)|Gene Khan]] in order to send a message to Zhang Tong (Khan's stepfather) and the rival Tong organization. However, Rhodey brings the Iron Man armor to Tony to escape. At the end of the episode, he and Unicorn are held captive and tortured by Gene as the Mandarin. The Mandarin later returned Unicorn and Killer Shrike to the Maggia in the episode "Pepper, Interrupted". Killer Shrike (alongside Unicorn) next appeared in the episode "Don't Worry, Be Happy" where they break into a Tong vault using explosives supplied by Mr. Fix. However, the bombs were designed to annihilate the entire city, not the vault. A battle ensued between Killer Shrike, Unicorn, the Tong, the Mandarin, and [[Happy Hogan]] (who was wearing the Iron Man suit at the time). Killer Shrike and Unicorn eventually fled the battle, rather than risk death by explosion. Killer Shrike and Unicorn appear again in the season 2 episode "The Invincible Iron Man Part 1: Disassembled" with some other members of the Maggia near the end of a heist but [[War Machine]] shows up and defeated them, leaving them for the police.
