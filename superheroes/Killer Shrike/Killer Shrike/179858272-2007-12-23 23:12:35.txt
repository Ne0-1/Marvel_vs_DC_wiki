'''Killer Shrike''' is a fictional character, a [[Marvel Comics]] supervillain. 

==Fictional character biography==
'''Simon Maddicks''' was born in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]]. He started out his life in the United States military. However, after that, not even Maddicks recalls much about his own past for some reason. When he was selected by the [[Roxxon Oil Company]], Maddicks became a mercenary, more specifically a special agent in covert operations. He was sent to the Mutagenics Laboratory of the Brand Corporation, where he underwent extensive conditioning which increased his human abilities. He also underwent surgery which implanted a miniature anti-gravity generator in his spine. Roxxon later gave Maddicks his super-villain costume and the codename "Killer Shrike".

For his first mission, he was sent to infiltrate the subversive organization called the [[Conspiracy (comics)|Conspiracy]], which Roxxon learned about through major purchases of technology from the Brand Corporation. The Conspiracy sent Killer Shrike to capture a monster known as Goram. Unfortunately for Killer Shrike, the plan was thwarted by the super-hero known as [[Ulysses Bloodstone]] who short-circuited the villain's electrical weapons, badly injuring him.

Feeling sorry for Killer Shrike's condition, Bloodstone's agents sent the villain to a New York hospital, where he lay comatose for several weeks. Upon awakening, Maddicks was contacted once again by Brand scientists, led by Dr. Stephen Weems. Weems, better known as the villain [[Modular Man]], sought revenge against his enemies [[Spider-Man]] and [[Beast (comics)|Beast]]. In return, the Modular Man promised Shrike information about his past.

During the Acts of Vengeance, Killer Shrike attacked Moon Knight, but was defeated.

In battle with Spider-Man and the Beast, Weems was killed before he could uphold his end of the bargain. Shrike escaped and was soon contacted by agents of the Brand Corporation. They helped restore his memory, and assigned him to undercover work as bodyguard to Brand president James Melvin. With Brand's public dissolution, Killer Shrike became a free agent.

Ever since, Killer Shrike was most often seen getting beaten up by several super-heroes, most often [[the Hulk]]. Killer Shrike was briefly a member of the Cardinal's team of flying super villains known as Air Force. Killer Shrike was oddly absent when the team was blackmailed by [[Night Thrasher]] into providing relief for Rwandan refugees. In New Warriors #54 Killer Shrike appears to have been murdered by the Soldiers of Misfortune. This was probably an art error as Oriole not Killer Shrike was with the team when blackmailed by Night Thrasher.

In the recent [[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]] miniseries, Killer Shrike's powers got updated by the Tinkerer. Unfortunately, this still wasn't enough for Maddicks to gain a victory, as he was soon afterward defeated by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], and apprehended by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]].

===Civil War===

Killer Shrike was later apprehended by [[Baron Zemo]] and forced to join the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], for so far unclear reasons.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Killer Shrike===
The Ultimate form of Killer Shrike made a cameo in  [[Ultimate Spider-Man]], issue 72, trying to rob [[Roxxon]] Industries of their supply of Adamantium - but was apprehended by Spider-Man. This version was a deranged, desperate man who seemed to almost [[froth]] at the mouth; Spider-Man himself referred to him as 'Steroid-Boy with a Laser Tag Fetish'. It was later revealed that he was an employee of the Ultimate [[Tinkerer]], hired specifically to bother Roxxon as vengeance for firing him.
