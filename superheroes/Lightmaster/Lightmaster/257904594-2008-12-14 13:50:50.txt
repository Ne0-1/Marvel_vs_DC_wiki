'''Lightmaster''' (real name Dr. '''Edward Lansky''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].

==Fictional character biography==
Edward Lansky was born in [[New York City]].  He was a physics professor and vice-chancellor of [[Empire State University]] who turned to crime and became a criminal mastermind as a way to prevent budget cuts for higher education that would have negatively affected the university.<ref name="mnyc">{{cite book  | last = Sanderson  | first = Peter  | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City  | publisher = [[Pocket Books]]  | date = 2007  | location = New York City  | pages = 30–33  | url =   | doi =   | id =   | isbn = 1-14653-141-6}}</ref>  As the Lightmaster, Lansky employed [[Kraven the Hunter]] and the [[Tarantula (Marvel Comics)|Tarantula]] to help him kidnap several government officials of the city of New York who had initiated the budget cuts.  The three were defeated by [[Spider-Man]], who foiled the plot. Spider-Man ran a current of electricity through the Lightmaster's body suit.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #3</ref>

However, Spider-Man had inadvertently caused Lightmaster to become a being of unstable energy, dependent on constant exposure to light just to survive.  Seeking revenge on Spider-Man, Lightmaster accidentally causes a [[power outage|blackout]] in New York City, causing his own unstable body to dissipate into what he called a "light dimension."<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #20</ref>  Lightmaster attempted to harness the powers of the mutant [[Dazzler]]'s powerful light source as a means to regain his physical form on Earth. However, he was driven back to his non-physical existence by Dazzler and Spider-Man.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #203</ref> He again attempted to regain his physical form, this time by harnessing [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]]'s [[Quasar (comics)#Quantum Bands|quantum bands]] and taking over Quasar's body.  On this latter occasion, Lightmaster succeeded in returning himself to a normal physical existence, despite Spider-Man's interference.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #113</ref>

Lightmaster was later released into the custody of [[Genetech]], who conducted experiments on him that made him more powerful, yet unstable. He was defeated by [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]] and taken back into custody by the Light Brigade.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #26; ''Spectacular Spider-Man Annual'' #12; ''Web of Spider-Man Annual'' #8</ref>

In a fight with [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], he had been hired by the "One World Church" to distribute the Façade Virus, which the OWC intended to use to turn everyone blue and thus eliminate racial divides. Cable subverted his control and instead turned everyone pink for two days, before publicly disabling the virus.<ref>''Cable and Deadpool'' #4-5</ref>

Lightmaster was present at the Bar With No Name in New York when lawyer Mallory Book confronted the present villains because nobody wanted to hire her anymore since her affair with [[Awesome Android|Awesome Andy]]. [[Two-Gun Kid]] beat everyone up when Batroc treated Mallory badly.<ref>''[[She-Hulk]]'' II #17</ref>

He recently appeared in ''[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day|Brand New Day]]'' as one of the villains in the bar.

In [[Secret Invasion]], Lightmaster appears as member of [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s crime syndicate and attacked a [[Skrull]] force.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #6</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Dr. Edward Lansky created a unique special body suit with a padded inner lining, a [[powered exoskeleton|power armor]] suit which utilized "gravity-pump circuitry" to allow him to manipulate photons for a variety of effects.  With it, he could fly; emit blinding flashes of light; create semi-solid, low-mass constructs (similar to those a [[Green Lantern]] might make with their [[Power ring (weapon)|Power Ring]]); create concussive beams of force; or create ''ersatz'' [[brass knuckles]] to increase the power of his punches.  The suit could absorb fairly large amounts of electrical energy without damaging the wearer. A sufficient amount of energy caused the circuitry to overload and converted the mass of Lansky's body into unstable "living energy."

Dr. Lansky is a genius in the field of physics with a gifted intellect, and has a Ph.D. in physics.
