'''Lightmaster''' (real name Dr. Edward Lansky) is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].

He has fought [[Spider-Man]], [[Cloak and Dagger]] and, most recently, [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]. In his fight with Cable, he had been hired by the "One World Church" to distribute the Fa√ßade Virus, which the OWC intended to use to turn everyone blue and thus eliminate racial divides. Cable subverted his control and instead turned everyone pink for two days, before publically disabling the virus.
