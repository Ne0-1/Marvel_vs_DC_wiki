==Fictional character biography==
===Raymond Bloch===
Nothing is known about Ox's history before founding the [[Enforcers (comics)|Enforcers]] (alongside [[Fancy Dan]] and [[Montana (comics)|Montana]]), although he was born in [[Seaside Heights, New Jersey]].  Ox is a burly strongman possessed of superhuman strength.

Ox eventually falls under the control of [[Mister Fear]], who partners him with the criminal [[Eel (comics)|Eel]] as '''The Fellowship of Fear''', as he is released earlier then the other Enforcers. Fear attempts to use his enthralled minions to destroy [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], but all three are defeated.<ref>Daredevil #6</ref>

Ox became fatally-afflicted with radiation poisoning during his criminal machinations.  He breaks out of prison with a reclusive scientist named Dr. Karl Stragg, who used a mind-transfer device to "swap bodies" with the villain, craving control of Ox's strength.  This "new" Ox dies in combat with Daredevil when he fell to his death.<ref>Daredevil #15</ref>

Meanwhile, the original Ox sought to build a new life in his new body (that of the scientist). This hope for redemption proves short-lived, however. While acting as a test subject for radioactive isotopes, the scientist's body mutates into an unstable duplicate of Ox's original frame. Ox goes on a rampage, soon succumbing to the radiation's lethal effects. He explodes in battle with Daredevil.<ref>Daredevil #86</ref>

===Ronald Bloch===
Years later, a second Ox, (Ronald, twin brother to the original), is paired with the remaining Enforcers.<ref>Spectacular Spider-Man #19</ref>  Comments and actions taken by this Ox suggest he may be, in fact, one of the two versions of the original, somehow having survived his battles with Daredevil.

Ox was later seen working as a tough for various underworld figures, such as the current Mr. Fear, the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]], and the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]].  While collecting a gambling debt on behalf of a criminal called 'Fat Teddy', he is confronted by [[Spider-Man]].<ref>"Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man" #2</ref> The hero stops the mugging, but then experiences the delusion that Ox is the more powerful, stronger villain called [[Morlun]]. Spider-Man, already afflicted by illness and the belief he doomed to die, beats upon Ox until stopped by an enraged Daredevil. Ox is left in a pool of blood and Daredevil makes sure the man receives medical attention.

===Civil War===
{{main|Civil War (comics)}}
During the Civil War event, Ox is arrested by [[Baron Zemo]] and is forced to either join Zemo's team of [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], or go to jail. Ox chooses to join. He, [[Cobra (comics)|King Cobra]] and [[Unicorn (comics)|Unicorn]], fellow villains, attack the Thunderbolts member [[Andreas Strucker|Swordsman]] as part of a training mission. All three are swiftly defeated.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #104</ref>

Later, Ox and the other Enforcers came back together to work for [[Mister Fear]], which pitted them directly against [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]. After Mister Fear's arrest, the Enforcers are taken in by the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s organization.

===Brand New Day===
Following the events of [[Spider-Man: Brand New Day]], Ox and the Enforcers are patrons at the Bar with No Name. they take bets with a person calling himself "The Bookie", over whether Spider-Man will show up to battle "Basher", an unknown villain who claimed to have fought the hero in the past. Spider-Man shows up, but is revealed to be a fake when the real web-head arrives. The Enforcers decide to get revenge for The Bookie's deception, capturing him. The Bookie's father calls Spider-Man for assistance, and he agrees to help. Spider-Man defeats Fancy Dan and Montana, and saves Ox from being flattened by a falling rollercoaster. Grateful for the save, Ox agrees to come along quietly.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #563</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Ox has tremendous strength and resistance to injury.

==Other characters named "Ox"==
Another character bearing the name of Ox, appeared in ''[[Alpha Flight]]'' Vol.1 66 as a member of [[China Force]]. Nothing has been revealed about the origins of this villain. He, along with other super human agents, formed China Force—the official superhuman team of China. The team was intended to be China’s first line of defense against the U.S. and U.S.S.R’s numerous super humans. However, China Force saw little action and split up under unexplained circumstances. The group was later reformed and sent to retrieve the [[Jade Dragon]] from Canada.

This Ox has enhanced strength, agility, endurance and wears a suit of armor that provides him with some protection from physical attack.

==Other versions==
===Marvel Noir===
In the ''[[Marvel Noir]]'' series, Ox, along with the other Enforces are muscle for [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]].<ref>''Spider-Man Noir'' #1</ref>

===House of M===
In the ''[[House of M]]'' series, Ox is one of Rhino's friends who helped him attack and detain the Green Goblin for ruining the best chance at a good life Rhino ever had.<ref>''Spider-Man: House of M'' #3</ref>

===Ultimate Ox===
Alongside the other Enforcers, Ox (named '''Bruno Sanchez''' in this continuity) also appeared in the [[Ultimate Universe]], first in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' #10. Ultimate Ox is an exceptionally tall and strong bald African-American. There, he worked for the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] until he was arrested. Upon the Kingpin's release from jail, Ox was rehired. Once in jail Ox was revealed not to be that evil, just misguided.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

==In other media==
===Television===
* Ox appeared in the 1967 ''[[Spider-Man (1967 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' TV series. He and [[Montana (comics)|Montana]] were hired by the Plotter to steal blueprints for him. He is portrayed as stupid and greedy.

* Ox appeared alongside the other [[Enforcers (comics)|Enforcers]] in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' voiced by [[Danny Trejo]] (though [[Clancy Brown]] did a few grunts as the character in the first episode). He is a large man with a [[black]] handlebar [[mustache]], which Spider-Man yanks with his webbing. He then leaves the big man suspended from a high building, a thin sheath of web wrapped about his fists, recommending sardonically that he "wouldn't recommend" breaking it, though he easily can. Ox alongside the other villains escape from Ryker's Island. He and Fancy Dan flee with Hammerhead and Montana as Shocker assists the other villains. In the Season 2 episode "Probable Cause" Ox is given a power suit that increases his strength. Alongside Shocker and Ricochet, the three stage several robberies fighting Spider-Man along the way. He was the only member of the New Enforcers to keep his original name. In the end, The Enforcers are all captured and arrested. In the episode "Opening Night," Ox (alongside Montana and Fancy Dan) are shown as inmates at the Vault at the time when Spider-Man tests out its security system. He is freed alongside the other inmates and joins the Enforcers in helping Silvermane take down Spider-Man. He seems to [[break the fourth wall]], due to the fact that he was humming the theme song during a time where they have to use the elevator in the Vault. His comrades look at him, Shocker being the most annoyed, and he replies, ''"It's catchy."''

===Video games===
* In ''[[Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions]]'', the Noir version of Ox is mentioned to be the stupidest of the Enforcers.
