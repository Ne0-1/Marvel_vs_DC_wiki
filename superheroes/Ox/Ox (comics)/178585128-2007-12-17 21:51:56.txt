'''Ox''' is a fictional [[Marvel Comics]] supervillain, he first appeared in ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #10 (Mar 1964) and he usually works for the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]], [[Mister Fear]] or [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]].

== Fictional character biography ==
Nothing is known about Ox's history before joining [[Enforcers (comics)|the Enforcers]], although he was born in [[Seaside Heights, New Jersey]].  A burly strongman possessed of [[Thing (comics)|Thing]]-like{{Fact|date=February 2007}} strength, Ox filled the brute requirement of the criminal trio.

Ox would eventually fall under the control of [[Mister Fear]], who would team him with the criminal [[Eel (comics)|Eel]] as '''The Fellowship of Fear'''.  Fear attempted to use his enthralled minions to destroy [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], but all three were defeated.

Ox became fatally-afflicted with radiation poisoning during his criminal machinations.  A reclusive scientist named Dr. Karl Stragg used a mind-transfer device to "swap bodies" with the villain, craving control of Ox's strength.  This "new" Ox died in combat with Daredevil<ref>Daredevil #15</ref>, the original seeking to build a new life in his new body (that of the scientist).

This hope for redemption proved short-lived, however, as the scientist's body mutated into an unstable duplicate of Ox's original frame (presumably the mind transfer also carried the mysterious radiation that had killed his first body, that radiation creating the mutation effect).  Ox rampaged and exploded in battle with Daredevil.<ref>Daredevil #86</ref>

Years later, a second Ox, (Ronald, twin brother to the original), was paired with the remaining Enforcers.<ref>Spectacular Spider-Man #19</ref>  Comments and actions taken by this Ox suggest he may be, in fact, one of the two versions of the original, somehow survived his bizarre battles with Daredevil.

Ox has recently been seen working as a tough for various underworld figures, such as the current Mr. Fear, the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]], and the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]].  While collecting a debt from a thug, [[Spider-Man]] savagely beat Ox into submission, Spidey was suffering from delusions at the time as he was dying of a withering illness (as detailed in "The Other" storyline).

=== Civil War ===
{{main|Civil War (comics)}}
During the Civil War event, Ox was arrested by [[Baron Zemo]] and was forced to either join Zemo's team of [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], or go to jail.  Ox chose to join.  He has already received personal training from [[Andreas Strucker|Swordsman]] to help improve his teamwork.

== Powers and abilities ==
Ox has tremendous strength and large resistance to injury.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Ox===
Alongside the other Enforcers, Ox (named Bruno Sanchez in this continuity) also appeared in the [[Ultimate Universe]], first in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' #10.  There, he worked for the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] until he was arrested. Upon the Kingpin's release from jail, Ox was rehired. Once in jail Ox was revealed not to be that evil, just misguided.

==Other Media==
* Ox appeared in the 1967 [[Spider-Man (1967 TV series)|Spider-Man]] TV series. He and [[Montana (comics)|Montana]] were hired by the Plotter to steal blueprints for him.
