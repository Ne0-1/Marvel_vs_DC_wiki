==Fictional character biography==
===Pre-Crisis===
Xotar was one of the first villains ever faced by the [[Justice League of America]]. He was a highly intelligent supervillain from the year 11,960. After obtaining the diary of [[Snapper Carr]], he learned that he successfully destroyed the Justice League after travelling to the past using one of his four most powerful weapons. The diary was damaged however so he had to fight the Justice League in small groups until he could determine which weapon defeated them. His first battle was against the Flash at a missile base. Xotar used a shrink ray which he called a microscopitor. Flash used his size to sneak inside the giant robot body Xotar used, destroyed the microscopitor and returned to normal size. Xotar then attacked the Panama Canal and battled Aquaman and the Martian Manhunter. Xotar used his de-evoluionizer and appeared to destroy the Martian Manhunter, though he actually turned invisible and destroyed the de-evolutionizer as Aquaman distracted him. He then battled Wonder Woman, Batman, and Green Lantern at Mount Rushmore. Xotar used his Magneto-Bubble weapon, which traps people in magnetic bubbles that are pulled towards the sun. Green Lantern managed to break the bubbles with his power ring, and Wonder Woman snatched the machine with her lasso. He then battled all the Justice Leaguers with his Illusion-Maker weapon that would trick them into destroying each other. Superman's special vision allowed him to see past it and destroy the fourth weapon. Xotar was then taken back to the future and turned over to the law enforcement. As it turned out the diary Xotar read actually told of his defeat, but was so damaged it looked like it said he won the fight.<ref>''Brave and the Bold #29'' (May 1960)</ref>

Later Superman, Green Lantern and Wonder Woman are visiting a carnival when stumble upon a plot by Xotar, whose race plans are to conquer the Earth, however they set up their cosmic carnival in order to stop the Justice League. Taking the three heroes prisoner, and using their advanced technology to make two of their members look like Green Lantern and Flash, the aliens hope to trap the rest of the Justice League. However, while trying to trick Aquaman in the same trap, the captured League members manage to break free, and although their physical forms are distorted by a cosmic fun-house mirror, they manage to stop the impostors and their plot to take over the Earth.<ref>''Justice League of America (Vol 1) #7'' November 1961</ref>

===Post-Crisis===
When Guy Gardner, Booster Gold and Blue Beetle decide to restart the [[Justice League]], their first meeting is attacked by the Weapons Master. With a veritable arsenal of futuristic weaponry at his command, he quickly takes down all combatants and even Superman and Maxima intervention was useless. With the League defeated, the Weapons Master claims his price – Guy Gardner's power ring. As he turns to leave, he finds a new hero ready to face him – [[Martian Manhunter|Bloodwynd]]. Bloodwynd channels the spirits of the dead to fight the Weapons Master. Unable to counter Bloodwynd's magic, the Weapons Master abducts the five fallen heroes and disappears.<ref>''Justice League America (Vol 1)'' #60 April, 1992</ref> But the league eventually defeats him.<ref>''Justice League America (Vol 1)'' #61 April, 1992</ref> The character also had set his target towards Superman but was again arrested.<ref>''Action Comics Vol 1'' #818</ref> He also battled the Legionnaries and the [[Creature Commandos]].<ref>''Legionnaires Vol 1'' #68</ref>
