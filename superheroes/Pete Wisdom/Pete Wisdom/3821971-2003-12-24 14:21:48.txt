Wisdom is a former Secret Service agent with the ability to throw 'knives' of energy from his fingertips.  He was involved with [[Shadowcat|Kitty Pryde]] for a while, but she eventually ended the relationship.  Wisdom is rarely seen in anything other than a scruffy suit or without a cigarette in hand and has a somewhat antagonistic (though friendly) relationship with the other team members, particularly Lockheed, who was jealous of his relationship with Kitty.
