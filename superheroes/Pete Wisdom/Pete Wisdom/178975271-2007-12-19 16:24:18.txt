'''Peter Paul Winston "Pete" Wisdom''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]]  [[Spy|secret agent]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[comic book]] [[Marvel Multiverse|multiverse]], created by writer [[Warren Ellis]]. Wisdom is a former British Secret Service agent with the [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] ability to throw "blades" of energy ("hot knives") from his fingertips.
==Publication history==
Pete Wisdom was initially created by Ellis and drawn by Ben Dilworth, in a pitch for "Electric Angel" for publisher [[Trident Comics]]. Wisdom was an angry young Essex man, with the power to summon electricity. Ellis said at Toronto Comicon 2005 that the character is based on Jack Regan from ''[[The Sweeney]]''. <ref>http://www.thecomicbooks.com/Audio/ , bottom of the page, "Warren Ellis on Excalibur"</ref>

Later, at Marvel, Wisdom formally debuted first appearance was as an agent for the British covert organization Black Air in ''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' vol. 1, #86(February, 1995).  thereafter he left Black Air and joined the [[X-Men]]-related Excalibur team, later appearing also in the series  ''[[X-Force]]''.  He is rarely seen in anything other than a scruffy suit (sometimes under a trenchcoat) or without a cigarette or a bottle of liquor in hand.

Wisdom was romantically involved with [[Shadowcat|Kitty Pryde]] for a while, a relationship controversial in [[fandom]] for its implied sexuality.  (The Warren Ellis script which introduced the relationship between the two was far more explicit than what made it to press:  Originally, the last panel in the issue in question was to have Shadowcat and Wisdom in bed together.  After initially approving the scene, Marvel's editors got cold feet and the panel instead showed the couple exchanging a kiss in silhouette.  Some later small touches that Ellis was able to include were Pete's reference to Kitty's feet being "like plates of ice" in bed, and an illustration of Kitty's bedroom with one of Pete's ties hanging on a bedpost.)  The controversy of their relationship stems primarily from their disparate ages: Wisdom is said to be ten years older than Pryde (due to the vague nature of times passage in comic universes, Ellis chose to portray her as being in her early twenties, though other writers felt that she was still in her mid-to-late teens).  The pair starred in the ''Pryde and Wisdom'' three-issue [[miniseries]], which was also written by Ellis; this series also introduced Wisdom's sister Romany, as well as his father Harold, a retired [[Scotland Yard]] inspector.  He had a somewhat antagonistic (though ultimately friendly) relationship with the other team members, particularly [[Lockheed (comics)|Lockheed]], who was jealous of his relationship with Kitty.  His relationship with Pryde eventually ended, and Wisdom left the team in issue 120.

Soon after, Warren Ellis became the 'plotmaster' of ''X-Force'' - [[Ian Edginton]] was the actual scripter, as part of the [[Counter-X]] rebranding of several second-tier X-titles (the others being ''[[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]]'' and ''[[X-Man]]''.  Wisdom would fake his own death and resurface some time later to a shocked X-Force.

He next appeared in New Excalibur scripted by [[Chris Claremont]].  Originally, the series' mandate was to explore the fallout from ''[[House of M]]'' in Britain. The series has since gone far beyond that including stories concerning the Dark X-Men, [[Black Tom Cassidy]] and even a slowly blossoming relationship between Wisdom and [[Sage (comics)|Sage]].

==Fictional character biography==
What is known about Pete Wisdom is that his father blamed him for his mother's death and that he has a sister, [[Romany Wisdom (Marvel Comics)|Romany]], who is an ally of [[Union Jack (Joseph Chapman)|Union Jack]].  He was also a member of the co-op agency, [[Black Air]] where he alluded to have being in a relationship with [[Michelle Scicluna]].

After teaming with Kitty Pryde, he later leaves Black Air and joins Excalibur where they start a relationship, regardless of the age difference.

After Excalibur dissolved, he was briefly affiliated with [[X-Force]]<ref>''X-Force'' vol. 1, #94-95</ref>, where he requested X-Force's aid in recovering a cybernetic brain from [[Genosha]], fighting [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] in the process.  Wisdom would later appear as the new leader of the team beginning in issue 102.  He acted as a mentor and showed the team members how to use their mutant powers in new ways.  At the end of the first major story arc in issue 105, in which Romany Wisdom returned as a villain, Pete Wisdom was apparently murdered.  He appeared in flashbacks in the next arc, these flashbacks taking place between issues 101 and 102.  In issue 115 the remainder of X-Force (with the exception of [[Domino (comics)|Domino]]) were apparently killed, while Wisdom was revealed to still be alive.  (Later, the rest of the X-Force team were revealed to have survived as well.) Wisdom's survival is apparently not known to any members of X-Force or Excalibur, and possibly the only person to know that he is alive is [[Alistaire Stuart]], head of the British Intelligence organization "The Department".

He is later ordered by MI-13 to find and team with [[Captain Britain]].  He then joins [[Excalibur (comics)#New Excalibur (2005)|New Excalibur]] and a relationship begins to blossom between him and [[Sage (comics)|Sage]].

==Powers and abilities==
Peter Wisdom has the power to absorb ambient heat and solar radiation, and release the absorbed energy from his fingertips as "hot knives" of pure thermal energy, said to be as "hot as the surface of the sun". He can leap from high distances and use the thermal energy to slow his descent. He can fire his hot knives as projectiles, or leave them attached to his fingertips like claws for close physical combat.  He also has years of experience in espionage from working for Black Air.
