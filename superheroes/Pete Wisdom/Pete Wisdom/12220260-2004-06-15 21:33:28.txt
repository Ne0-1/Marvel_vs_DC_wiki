'''Peter "Pete" Wisdom''' is a [[comic book]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. Wisdom is a former Secret Service agent with the ability to throw 'knives' of energy from his fingertips.  He was briefly a member of [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]].  He was involved with [[Shadowcat|Kitty Pryde]] for a while, but she eventually ended the relationship and he left the team.  Wisdom is rarely seen in anything other than a scruffy suit or without a cigarette in hand and has a somewhat antagonistic (though friendly) relationship with the other team members, particularly [[Lockheed (comics)|Lockheed]], who was jealous of his relationship with Kitty.  After Excalibur dissolved, he was briefly affiliated with [[X-Force]].
