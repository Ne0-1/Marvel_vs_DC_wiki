'''Peter Paul Winston "Pete" Wisdom''' is a [[fictional character]], a  [[Spy|secret agent]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[comic book]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]] created by British comic writer [[Warren Ellis]]. Wisdom is a former British Secret Service agent with the [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] ability to throw 'blades' of energy ("hot knives") from his fingertips (one online critic pointed out that "hotknife" was a slang term for drug paraphernalia).

Wisdom was briefly a member of the [[X-Men]] splinter teams (and [[spinoff]] titles) [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] and [[X-Force]].  He is rarely seen in anything other than a scruffy suit (sometimes under a trenchcoat) or without a cigarette or a bottle of liquor in hand. Wisdom is said to be a derivative of [[DC Comics]]' [[Vertigo (comics)|Vertigo]] character, [[John Constantine]] (whom writer [[Warren Ellis]] later wrote during a brief and troubled stint on ''[[Hellblazer]]''), though Ellis himself has denied this and said Wisdom is based on Jack Regan from [[The Sweeney]].

==Character history==
Pete Wisdom was initially created by Ellis and drawn by Ben Dilworth, in a pitch for "Electric Angel" for publisher Trident Comics. Wisdom was an angry young Essex man, with the power to summon electricity.

Pete Wisdom next appeared early on Warren Ellis' two-year run on ''Excalibur'' (issues 83 through 103).  His first appearance was as an agent for the British covert organization Black Air in ''Excalibur'' (vol.1) #86.  Soon thereafter he left Black Air and joined the Excalibur team.  

===Kitty Pryde===
Wisdom was romantically involved with [[Shadowcat|Kitty Pryde]] for a while, a relationship controversial in [[fandom]] for its implied sexuality.  (The Warren Ellis script which introduced the relationship between the two was far more explicit than what made it to press:  Originally, the last panel in the issue in question was to have Shadowcat and Wisdom in bed together.  After initially approving the scene, Marvel's editors got cold feet and the panel instead showed the couple exchanging a kiss in silhouette.  Some later small touches that Ellis was able to include were Pete's reference to Kitty's feet being "like plates of ice" in bed, and an illustration of Kitty's bedroom with one of Pete's ties hanging on a bedpost.)  The controversy of their relationship stems primarily from their disparate ages: Wisdom is said to be ten years older than Pryde (due to the vague nature of times passage in comic universes, Ellis chose to portray her as being in her early twenties, though other writers felt that she was still in her mid-to-late teens).  The pair starred in the ''Pryde and Wisdom'' three-issue [[miniseries]], which was also written by Ellis; this series also introduced Wisdom's sister Romany, as well as his father Harold, a retired [[Scotland Yard]] inspector.  He had a somewhat antagonistic (though ultimately friendly) relationship with the other team members, particularly [[Lockheed (comics)|Lockheed]], who was jealous of his relationship with Kitty.  His relationship with Pryde eventually ended, and Wisdom left the team in issue 120.

===X-Force===
After Excalibur dissolved, he was briefly affiliated with [[X-Force]].  His first appearance in this comic occurred in ''X-Force'' volume 1, issues 94 and 95, where he requested X-force's aid in recovering a cybernetic brain from [[Genosha]], fighting [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] in the process.  Soon after, Warren Ellis became the 'plotmaster' of ''X-Force'' - [[Ian Edginton]] was the actual scripter, as part of the [[Counter-X]] rebranding of several second-tier X-titles (the others being ''[[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]]'' and ''[[X-Man]]'') -  and Wisdom appeared as the new leader of the team beginning in issue 102.  He acted as a mentor and showed the team members how to use their mutant powers in new ways.  At the end of the first major story arc in issue 105, in which Romany Wisdom returned as a villain, Pete Wisdom was apparently murdered.  He appeared in flashbacks in the next arc, these flashbacks taking place between issues 101 and 102.  In issue 115 the remainder of X-Force (with the exception of [[Domino (comics)|Domino]]) were apparently killed, while Wisdom was revealed to still be alive.  (Later, the rest of the X-Force team were revealed to have survived as well.) Wisdom's survival is apparently not known to any members of X-Force or Excalibur, and possibly the only person to know that he is alive is Alistaire Stuart, head of the British Intelligence organization "The Department". 

===New Excalibur===
However, more recently, Wisdom, now affiliated with MI-13 (the British Intelligence agency tasked with protecting the country from anything superhumsn, mutant, magical or otherwise 'unusual'), has helped bring together the latest version of [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]], alongside [[Captain Britain]], [[Dazzler]], [[Nocturne (comics)|Nocturne]], [[Sage (comics)|Sage]] and the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]], in a new series scripted by [[Chris Claremont]]. 

Originally, the series' mandate was to explore the fallout from ''[[House of M]]'' in Britain. The series has since gone far beyond that including stories concerning the Dark X-Men, [[Black Tom Cassidy]] and even a slowly blossoming relationship between Wisdom and [[Sage (comics)|Sage]].

===MAX===
In November 2006,Pete Wisdom returned in a six-issue [[limited series]] titled ''Wisdom'' under the [[MAX Comics|MAX]] comics imprint. The series was written by British author [[Paul Cornell]] and drawn by [[Trevor Hairsine]]. It features Wisdom Leading a team of British superhumans on a mission to the [[otherworld]]. The Team Included:

Captain Midlands: an aged northern Analogue of [[Captain America]]

Tink: [[Fairy]] Dissident

John The Skrull: A Skrull duplicate of what appears to be [[John Lennon]]

Maureen Raven: [[Clairsentient]]

Wisdom also seems to have a slight resemblance to [[John Cooper Clarke]].

==Powers and abilities==
Peter Wisdom has the power to absorb ambient heat and solar radiation, and release the absorbed energy from his fingertips as "hot knives" of pure thermal energy, said to be as "hot as the surface of the sun". He can fire his hot knives as projectiles, or leave them attached to his fingertips like claws for close physical combat.  He also has years of experience in espionage from working for Black Air.
