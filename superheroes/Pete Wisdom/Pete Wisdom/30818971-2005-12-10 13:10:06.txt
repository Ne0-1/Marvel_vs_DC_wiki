'''Peter "Pete" Wisdom''' is a [[fictional character]], a  [[Spy|secret agent]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[comic book]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. Wisdom is a former British Secret Service agent with the [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] ability to throw 'blades' of energy ("hot knives") from his fingertips (one online critic pointed out that "hotknife" was a slang term for drug paraphernalia; this is presumed to have been deliberate on Warren Ellis's part). 

Wisdom was briefly a member of the [[X-Men]] splinter teams (and [[spinoff]] titles) [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] and [[X-Force]].  He is rarely seen in anything other than a scruffy suit (sometimes under a trenchcoat) or without a cigarette or a bottle of liquor in hand. Wisdom is said to be a derivative of [[DC Comics]]' [[Vertigo]] character, [[John Constantine]] (whom writer [[Warren Ellis]] later wrote during a brief and troubled stint on ''[[Hellblazer]]'').
==Character history==
Pete Wisdom was initially created by Ellis early on in his two-year run on ''Excalibur'' (issues 83 through 103).  His first appearance was as an agent for the British covert organization Black Air in ''Excalibur'' (vol.1) #86.  Soon therafter he left Black Air and joined the Excalibur team.  

===Kitty Pryde===
Wisdom was romantically involved with [[Shadowcat|Kitty Pryde]] for a while, a relationship controversial in [[fandom]] for its implied sexuality.  (The Warren Ellis script which introduced the relationship between the two was far more explicit:  Originally, the last panel in the issue in question was to have Shadowcat and Wisdom in bed together.  After initially approving the scene, Marvel's editors got cold feet and the panel instead showed the couple exchanging a kiss in silhouette.)  The controversy of their relationship stems primarily from their disparate ages: Wisdom is said to be at least ten years older than Pryde (although Ellis chose to portray her as being in her early twenties, other writers felt that she was still in her late teens).  The pair starred in the ''Pryde and Wisdom'' three-issue [[miniseries]], which was also written by Ellis; this series also introduced Wisdom's sister Romany, as well as his father.  He had a somewhat antagonistic (though ultimately friendly) relationship with the other team members, particularly [[Lockheed (comics)|Lockheed]], who was jealous of his relationship with Kitty.  His relationship with Pryde eventually ended, and Wisdom left the team in issue 120.
===X-Force===
After Excalibur dissolved, he was briefly affiliated with [[X-Force]].  His first appearance in this comic occurred in ''X-Force'' volume 1, issues 94 and 95, where he requested X-force's aid in recovering a cybernetic brain from [[Genosha]], fighting [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] in the process.  Soon after, Warren Ellis became the 'plotmaster' of ''X-Force'' - [[Ian Edginton]] was the actual scripter, as part of the [[Counter-X]] rebranding of several second-tier X-titles (the others being ''[[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]]'' and ''[[X-Man]]'') -  and Wisdom appeared as the new leader of the team beginning in issue 102.  He acted as a mentor and showed the team members how to use their mutant powers in new ways.  At the end of the first major story arc in issue 105, in which Romany Wisdom returned as a villain, Pete Wisdom was apparently murdered.  He appeared in flashbacks in the next arc, these flashbacks taking place between issues 101 and 102.  In issue 115 the remainder of X-Force (with the exception of [[Domino (comics)|Domino]]) were apparently killed, while Wisdom was revealed to still be alive.  (Later, the rest of the X-Force team were revealed to have survived as well.) Wisdom's survival is apparently not known to any members of X-Force or Excalibur, and possibly the only person to know that he is alive is Alistaire Stuart, head of the British Intelligence organization "The Department". 
===New Excalibur===
However, Wisdom is slated to be a member of ''New Excalibur'', alongside [[Captain Britain]] and the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]], in a new series to be scripted by [[Chris Claremont]]. The series' mandate will be to explore the fallout from ''[[House of M]]''; it is as yet unrevealed as to what Wisdom's role in the series will entail.
