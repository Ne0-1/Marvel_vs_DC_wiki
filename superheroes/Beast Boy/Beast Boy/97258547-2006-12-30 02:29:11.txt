'''Beast Boy (Garfield Mark "Gar" Logan)''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]], a [[shapeshifting]] [[superhero]] who is a member of the [[Doom Patrol]] and former member of the [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]]. Created by [[Arnold Drake]] and [[Bob Brown (comics)|Bob Brown]], he first appeared in ''The Doom Patrol'' #99 (November 1965).

==Character biography== 
===Character history===
As a child, Garfield contracted a rare illness called Sakutia and was cured by a [[blood plasma|serum]] extracted from a green [[monkey]]. This serum had the unintended effect of turning his skin and hair green and gave him the ability to morph into any animal of his choice. The colors and appearance of these animals changed depending on the artist using the character at the time.

Before becoming a Teen Titan or part of the Doom Patrol, Garfield was placed in custody of Nicholas Galtry, the attorney for his parents' estate. While the young Logan was in [[Africa]], Galtry had [[embezzle]]d funds from Gar's inheritance. When Gar was found, Galtry plotted to kill the boy and have all the wealth for himself.

Originally and currently known as '''Beast Boy''', he was adopted by [[Elasti-Girl]] and [[Steve Dayton|Mento]], members of the [[Doom Patrol]]. He later joined the West Coast team of the [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]] (known as Titans West), and was part of the New Teen Titans assembled by [[Raven (comics)|Raven]]. It was at this time that he took the name '''Changeling'''. He remained with various incarnations of the team, forming a close friendship with [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]].

He later began using the name Beast Boy again, under which he got his own [[mini-series]] ''Beast Boy''. Following a failed attempt to recreate "Titans West" as "Titans L.A.,", as recounted in ''Titans Secret Files'' #2 (October 2000), he rejoined the main team.

He has also worked as an [[actor]], playing the role of an [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|alien]] in the [[TV series]] ''Space Trek 2022'' (which, even in the fictional setting, was a thinly disguised [[pastiche]] of ''[[Star Trek]]'' and ''[[Space: 1999]]'', and was cancelled following threats of legal action on the grounds of [[plagiarism]]).

Beast Boy's character is often used as [[comic relief]]. However, this is only a facade, he uses humor to hide a deep inner pain. Beast Boy has suffered many hardships in his life (both his real parents have died, and his foster mother, whom Garfield became very close to, died in battle along with virtually all of the other ''[[Doom Patrol]]'' members with whom he was part of the team and his foster father was driven mad by a helmet he used to fight enemies). During his time with The New Teen Titans, Gar fell in love with [[Terra (comics)|Terra]], a young girl with [[-kinesis#Geokinesis|geokinetic]] powers and fellow Teen Titans member, who turned out to be a spy working for [[Deathstroke]] or Slade. Despite all his hardships, Garfield is friendly and upbeat.

His best friend is [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] (also a member of the [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]]). He is also close to [[Bette Kane]], a former Titan who helped clear his name from the crimes committed by [[Gemini (DC Comics)|an impostor]] on an adventure in Los Angeles.

In one occasion, he gained an arch enemy in the [[Zookeeper (comics)|Zookeeper]].

==="One Year Later"===
{{main|One Year Later}}
{{Spoiler}}
While the events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' unfolds, details of Beast Boy's life "One Year Later" are revealed in the current Teen Titans comic book. 

''[[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]]'' vol. 3, #34 (May 2006) shows us scenes from the year between the conclusion of Infinite Crisis and [[One Year Later]], from the damaged Cyborg's POV. Garfield led the [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]], before quitting the team following the break-up of himself and Raven. He then joined his original team, the [[Doom Patrol]], citing that the team needed his help and that [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] could handle leadership. He was also feeling uneasy about remaining in a team without his best friend Cyborg.

Soon after Cyborg awoke, Beast Boy and the rest of the Doom Patrol helped the Titans fight off the Brotherhood of Evil, who had managed to clone Brain.  The clone was a failure, and Mallah ended up tearing Brain's head off so that he could preserve his master's brain.

After returning, Beast Boy was infuriated to discover that the Chief had been manipulating them and trying to do the same to [[Kid Devil]].  Gar and his parents stood up to the Chief and made him step down as the Doom Patrol's leader.  Gar stayed on his old team saying that they still needed him.

His costume post-''Infinite Crisis'' resembles the one he wore in the animated series.

===Personal life===
Garfield Logan's life has been shaped by tragedy. His parents died in a boating accident when he was no more than 10 years old. To this day, he still believes he could have prevented this event. After he was saved from two kidnappers that tried to use his powers to help them in their crimes, he was left under the care of his despised guardian, Nicholas Galtry.

Galtry wasn't happy that Garfield was alive and plotted to kill the boy in order to claim his inheritance. The various villains he hired to kill young Logan were impeded by the [[Doom Patrol]]. His hopes of gaining Garfield's money were finally dashed when [[Elasti-Girl|Rita]] and [[Steve Dayton]] adopted Garfield.

In his days with the Doom Patrol, Garfield held a romantic relationship with a girl from his high-school named Jillain Jackson. After he saved her from Galtry (who was using the alias "Arsenal"), the relationship dissolved. Beast Boy was the only survivor of the Doom Patrol, a loss which deeply affected him.  Since then, they have all returned to life, but this began his habit of his making jokes to cover up his fear that those he cares about will die.

Garfield felt insecure and inadequate as a [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titan]]. He hid his insecurity by constantly cracking jokes which even he described as "stale" and humorously flirting with the female members of the team. He even suggested that [[Raven (comics)|Raven]] reformed the Titans just to meet him (something none of the other Titans would ever believe). However, it is a mystery exactly why Raven chose to recruit Garfield into the New Teen Titans.

Logan developed a more serious interest in [[Terra (comics)|Tara Markov]]. He was heartbroken to discover that she was a traitor working for [[Deathstroke]] and hated the Teen Titans. Even after her death, he refused to believe for a long time that she was a traitor and blamed Deathstroke for corrupting her and using her. He, however, came to grips with her true colors when it was revealed that she killed King Tawaba. Despite this, he blamed her betrayal on Deathstroke until he disclosed the real details of his relationship with her to him. This added to his fears of losing those he is close to. However, he and Deathstroke parted on peaceful terms after this, and strangely enough over the course of time(specifically during the ''Titans Hunt'' and ''Total Chaos'' story arcs), even developed a friendship between them. 
After Terra's betrayal and death, Jill returned to Garfield's life to ease his pain. Unfortunately, the relationship dissolved just as it did before. Jackson's fate remains unknown. Logan also had a short-lived relationship with [[Bette Kane|Flamebird]] when he led the also short-lived Titans L.A.

Upon returning to the Titans under [[Cyborg (comics)|Vic Stone's]] leadership, he began flirting with his female teammates again. His flirts became minimal, however, when [[Raven (comics)|Raven]] was revived and rejoined the team. He did, however, flirt with Raven occasionally. In ''Teen Titans'' vol. 3, #30, Raven kissed Beast Boy without explanation. It was revealed in the following issue that Raven kissed him because it was "just what she wanted to do". She had been developing feelings for him since her recent rebirth. Despite fan speculations that this affair was influenced by the Shipper fan community, writer [[Geoff Johns]] has gone on record to note that he had long been preparing these two slowly to have a relationship before the animated series even began. However, Robin revealed in Teen Titans #34 that the two have broken up, though no reason why was given, and both left the team as a result. Interviews with Geoff Johns indicated the relationship would be explored again during and after "OYL".

==Powers and abilities==
As a shape shifter, Beast Boy has the ability to morph into any animal that he has seen himself or has seen in an illustration (as is the case when he shapeshifts into an animal such as an extinct [[dinosaur]]).  These transformations take only a second and Beast Boy has demonstrated that he is capable of rapidly changing his form with little or no effort expended.  His power enables him to completely alter his body mass, being able to take the shape of animals far larger and heavier than himself, such as an [[elephant]], a [[hippopotamus]], or a [[Tyrannosaurus Rex]] (though until recent stories, such larger forms would physically exhaust him), or smaller and lighter animals such as [[mice]] and insects. His power also enables him to radically alter his body structure and take forms of animals without limbs, like [[snakes]], or those without skeletons like a [[jellyfish]]. While as a animal, he gains all the physical abilities and characteristics of said animal, such as great strength (a [[gorilla]]), speed (a [[cheeta]]), and durability (a [[turtle]]), and abilities such as flight (various [[birds]]), and aquatic breathing (various [[fish]]). He can even gain the specific poison produced by specific snakes. While in animal form, Beast Boy retains his human intellect, memories, and the ability to speak. No matter what form he takes, his skin, hair, and his eyes, will remain green, making most of his animal forms easy to pick out from real animals of that species.

When Raven implanted Garfield with an evil seed of her father Trigon, he began to transform into more demon-like creatures. Eventually, he found himself more comfortable in these horrific shapes rather than as a human, and stayed shifted. After becoming completely corrupted by the evil seed, he was used by Raven and Trigon, and eventually returned to normal. 

In the "Titans of Tomorrow" storyline Garfield, calling himself Animal Man, has the power to create copies of himself, and the ability to become mythical animals.

In [[Kingdom Come]] (also set in an alternate future), Beast Boy has changed his name to "Menagerie" and, for unspecified reasons, can only transform into Mythical creatures.

==Other Media==
===Teen Titans animated series===
Beast Boy appears in the ''[[Teen Titans (animated series)|Teen Titans]]'' [[animation|animated]] series, voiced by [[Greg Cipes]].

In the series, Beast Boy (nicknamed "BB", and others) plays the role of the light-hearted jokester of the group, though often the butt of many jokes himself (similar to his comics self). He wears a black and purple [[Doom Patrol]] uniform, complete with gray gloves and purple [[sneaker (footwear)|sneaker]]s with seemingly [[velcro]] straps (although they were temporarily shown as shoelaces in the episode "[[List of Teen Titans episodes#Season 4 (2005)|Mother Mae-Eye]]"). The costume also has a mask that goes along with it (which he wore in his days with the Doom Patrol, as seen in "Homecoming: Part 1," "Homecoming: Part 2," and "Go!"); he discarded it after Cyborg told him it was goofy, and Raven pointed out that the mask wouldn't hide his secret identity anyway, as since his skin is green, he doesn't really have one. Beast Boy also has pointy ears, which he finds to be an attractive quality of himself, and appears much younger than in the comics. The ears were adapted to the comics in ''Teen Titans'' volume three. He exhibits very feral habits as well, such as sitting with his feet on his chair and moving his ears up and down.

Beast Boy's ability to speak in animal form is normally absent in the series. However, in episodes such as ''Apprentice: Part 2'', ''How Long is Forever'', ''Date with Destiny'', ''Haunted'', and ''Crash'', he has been shown as talking or making "human" sounds in animal form. 

Beast Boy is a full [[vegetarian]], having been most of the meat-producing animals (he stated as such in "Final Exam"). He's also prone to causing much of the mischief around [[Titans Tower]], such as the time he kept a large mutant moth larva hidden in his [[bedroom]], whom he named [[Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series)#Silkie|Silkie]]. In "Can I Keep Him?," the larva devours much of the Tower while the team is on a mission fighting [[Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series)#Johnny Rancid|Johnny Rancid]]. While trying to hide him from the others, Beast Boy entrusts Silkie to [[Starfire (comics)|Starfire]] to hide, but she ends up adopting the creature.

Beast Boy, like in the comics, also had a romantic relationship with a girl named [[Terra (comics)|Terra]] who had the ability to control earth and the elements in the earth. As in the comic book, Terra betrays the Teen Titans as an ally of [[Deathstroke|Slade]] (Deathstroke). Ultimately, she receives redemption in helping the Titans defeat Slade; however, she is turned to stone in the process. In a departure from the comic book, Beast Boy retains strong feelings for Terra, as can be heard in "The End: Part 2" by "Evil Beast Boy" (an evil clone of BB created by [[Trigon (comics)|Trigon]], representing his evil side). In the final episode "Things Change" Beast Boy saw Terra, although it's unclear whether or not it was the real Terra as he was the only Titan who saw her.  The episode was designed to serve in much the way ''[[JLU]]''s' second season finale "[[Epilogue (Justice League Unlimited episode)|Epilogue]]" was designed to wrap up the [[Batman]] portion of the [[DCAU]], focusing on one or two central characters and resolving unapproached issues.

In the season 3 episode ''The Beast Within'', Beast Boy gained a new "Man-Beast" form when he was doused with an experimental DNA compound. The Titans had assumed that he'd used this form to attack [[Raven (comics)|Raven]]. However, it was in fact Adonis, who had been affected by the compound as well, who attacked her, and Beast Boy was protecting Raven from him. Beast Boy disliked this form and refrained from using it again until he and the other Titans were fighting off [[Deathstroke|Slade's]] fire-soldier army in ''The End: Part 1''. He never used it after then, suggesting that even with the strength and abilities it gave him, he considered it a "last resort".

Season 5 of Teen Titans focused on Beast Boy a great deal, as it dealt with his history as a member of the animated series' incarnation of the [[Doom Patrol]]. In the second episode of the fifth season, Beast Boy becomes the first male Titan in the series to be explicitly referred to by his real name (Garfield). In "Titans Together", Beast Boy showed a remarkable amount of leadership skills and led [[Herald (comics)|Herald]], [[Jericho (comics)|Jericho]], [[Pantha]], and [[Mas y Menos|Mas]] on an assault on the [[Brotherhood of Evil]]. He remained leader even after [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]], [[Starfire (comics)|Starfire]], [[Raven (comics)|Raven]], and several other [[Titans (comics)|Titans]] joined the fight. Beast Boy only stood down from leadership when [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] was thawed out; thus fulfilling his dream (revealed in the episode "Go!") to be Robin's sidekick.

One part of Beast Boy's depiction in the animated series that has garnered attention is his effort to form a connection with his team-mate, [[Raven (comics)|Raven]], going so far as to make a decisive effort to get her to respond to his jokes. His comedic and innocent nature often plays off on Raven's more distant and harsh one, and certain episodes focus on building their friendship ("Spellbound" and "The Beast Within"). However, the producers have gone on record to say that this was not intended to be the basis for a romantic relationship - as some fans have hoped.

Until ''Homecoming'', in which his former teammates make a guest appearance, Beast Boy was the only member of the [[Doom Patrol]] to appear on the show.

Beast Boy also has an obsession with owning a vehicle of his own, more specifically, a [[moped]]. In one episode, he acquires one and affectionately calls it the "B-Ped". Ironically, after using it to save the world from killer [[tofu]], it falls to pieces. He often has fantasies of impressing girls on a moped, dressed in a stereotypical French style: black and white striped shirt, black trousers and a beret.

===Video Games===
Beast Boy is a playable character in the [[Teen Titans (video game)|Teen Titans]] video game for [[Game Boy Advanced]].

Beast Boy is a playable character in both "Story" and "Master of Games" modes in the console [[Teen Titans (console game)|Teen Titans]] game.
