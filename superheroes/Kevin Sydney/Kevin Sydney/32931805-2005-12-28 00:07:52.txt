==History==
The Changeling originally worked for the villainous organization [[Factor Three]]. Following that group's defeat, it was revealed in ''X-Men'' #65 (February 1970) that he had reformed and unbeknownst to the X-Men was recruited by [[Professor X]] to replace him while he isolated himself to prepare for his fight against the [[Z'Nox]]. The Changeling, masquerading as Professor X, was killed in battle shortly after this in ''X-Men'' #42 (March 1968).  It was not until ''X-Men'' #65 that the X-Men learned it had not been the Professor who had died but the Changeling.

Although the Changeling seemed destined for obscurity for many years, he was revived in alternate continuities as [[Morph (comics)|Morph]], first in the [[X-Men animated series]], later in the [[Age of Apocalypse]] and ''[[Exiles (comics)|Exiles]]''.

==Powers and abilities==
Changeling is a [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] with the ability to alter his physical appearance at will to resemble that of any person he chooses.  He also has limited [[telepathic]] abilities.
