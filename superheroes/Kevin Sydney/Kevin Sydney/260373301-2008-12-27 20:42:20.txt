'''Kevin Sydney''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] that has been a member of the [[X-Men]] in [[comic book]] stories published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and artist [[Werner Roth (comics)|Werner Roth]], the character first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' #35 ([[1967#August|August 1967]]).

Kevin Sydney first appeared as the '''Changeling''', a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] [[shapeshifting|shapeshifter]]. He was a short-lived X-Men adversary who, off-panel, joined [[Professor X]]'s efforts and died shortly after, making him the first member of the X-Men to die in action.

Later a character named '''Morph''' in the 1990s was based upon the earlier character of Changeling. The two remain distinct characters in personality and history.

==Publication history==
The first run of appearances happened in 1967-1968 when he appeared in ''X-Men'' #37-42. Although dying at the end of this run he was thought to have been seen as a ghost in ''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]: The Possession'' (1991) and returned properly in ''Sensational She-Hulk'' #34-35 (1991-1992).

==Powers and abilities==
Kevin Sydney is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] metamorph with the ability to alter his physical appearance and voice at will to resemble that of any person he chooses.  His power could also transform the appearance of his costume as well, which was made of unstable molecules.

He also has limited [[telepathic]] abilities which (in the original timeline) were enhanced by Professor X. As a side effect he also gained limited telekinetic abilities{{Fact|date=March 2007}}. 

Kevin Sydney is also a skilled actor, and is a highly trained and efficient organizer of subversive activities.

He carried various advanced weaponry of alien [[List of Marvel Comics alien races#S|Siri]] design belonging to [[Factor Three]], including a ray gun carried in a holster at his side.

==Other versions==
Changeling is the character from the main [[Marvel Universe]], [[Earth-616]]. However, in the 1990s, he was reinvented as [[Morph (comics)|Morph]]<ref>The name change was due to copyright reasons</ref> in the [[X-Men (animated series)|''X-Men'' animated series]] (Earth-921031), which led to versions of the character (also named Morph) appearing in stories set in other alternative universes.

===Exiles===
[[Image:Morpexilesjpg.jpg|thumb|200px|Morph from Exiles.]]
Morph/Kevin Sydney is a founding member of the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]], and since [[Blink (comics)|Blink]] was pulled out between issue #22 and #42 and [[Mimic (Exiles)|Mimic]] was killed in issue #73, Morph is the only one to be consistent throughout the series<ref>''Exiles'' #1-98</ref>. He is currently the only original Exile still on the team.

====Fictional character biography====
=====Before the Exiles=====
Morph is a hero from [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Earth-1081]] who was a member of the [[New Mutants]], [[X-Men]], and [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. He was a unique son of loving parents. Early on in life he managed to use his powers, and was able to give everyone what they wanted from him. Morph always used his power to joke around and keep everyone at ease with him, only comfortable to be himself around his parents. 

His mother died of lung cancer and Morph tried in every way to cheer up his emotionally distraught father (often acting in a childish way whenever his father wanted him to act serious), who, unable to let his suffering go, chose to enroll his son in a boarding school; luckily, that school happened to be the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute for Higher Learning]].

Promoted to the X-Men, Morph's sense of humor initially grated upon the much more serious team but eventually his humor and humility won them over. He was instrumental in many of the team's victories and was chosen to be part of a pilot program with the Avengers, along with the Beast, as a public representative of mutant-kind. 

Morph would return to the X-Men because, in his own words, "he missed his freaky mutant brothers and sisters." On a subsequent mission, Morph and the rest of the X-Men were facing off against a threat known only as Stonehenge when Morph became unhinged from time.

=====With the Exiles=====
Then the mysterious [[Timebroker]] appeared to him, explaining to him that he had become unhinged from time as a chain of events had caused his reality as he knew it to change. In that new reality a wounded Morph is unable to maintain his form, and is in a coma, being only a white muddy substance in [[Beast (comics)|Beast]]'s lab. Hoping to save his own future, he becomes a member, and [[comic relief]], of the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]], a group of universe-hopping heroes trying to save realities from ripples and alteration. 

He soon befriended the mutant [[Sunfire (Exiles)|Sunfire]], although in a loving [[platonic]] relationship, accepting the [[lesbian]] nature of his friend. He always took care of her, and her death left him emotionally wrecked. 

=====Mojo's World=====
The Exiles battled on, fixing reality after reality and struggling to keep it together. Following one of these missions the team was kidnapped by [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]], the insane evil dictator of the Mojoverse. Mojo considered Morph the best entertainer he had ever seen and brought him back to entertain the masses. If he didn't, Mojo would kill his fellow Exile, Nocturne. Eventually, Nocturne was able to escape and set Morph free. Mojo went crazy and threatened to kill Morph's friends. An enraged Morph was on the verge of killing Mojo when the Timebroker stopped them. The Timebroker revealed Mojo had disrupted time but he was a necessary evil and could not be killed.

=====Against Weapon X=====
Morph continued to be the heart of the team until a mission in which [[Mimic (comics)|Mimic]] was taken over by a [[Brood (comics)|Brood]] egg. During the battle, he killed Sunfire. Mimic was eventually cured but Morph was enraged. He was devastated by Sunfire's death and told Mimic he should have killed himself rather than let something like this happen. Morph stormed off and threatened to leave the team. [[Magik (comics)|Magik]], an unlikely ally, followed and tried to calm him. The two connected and despite her past attitude during missions, Morph realized Illyana was just a scared girl trying to get home. He remained angry with Mimic but helped his team fight against the rogue reality-hopping team, [[Weapon X#Exiles|Weapon X]]. 

Before the battle began, Magik attempted to switch sides, believing her team was weaker. Hyperion, the self-appointed leader of Weapon X, snapped her neck and Morph was driven into a rage. He attacked Hyperion, who attempted to blast Morph with his eyebeams, but Mimic saved him. During the brawl with Weapon X, Morph fought against an evil [[Carol Danvers|Ms. Marvel]]. Their battle caused a building to fall in on them, killing Ms. Marvel but Morph was able to survive. 

The Exiles were triumphant and the Timebroker told Morph he could finally go home. His mission was fulfilled. Morph considered the offer but asked if he could stay with his team. He realized they needed him and he couldn't leave them behind. The Timebroker agreed; Morph asked him not to tell the rest of the Exiles of his decision. Morph and Mimic reconciled since he realized that Sunfire's death was not Mimic's fault and that the Brood was controlling him. The team moved on. 

=====Proteus=====
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Evimorph.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Proteus possessing Morph in a simulation of what should happen if he ever got free. Art by Paul Pelletier.]] -->
He recently helped the team take down [[Proteus (comics)|Proteus]] by impersonating the [[Maestro (comics)|Maestro]] and weakening Proteus with a steel strip in his head. Morph went to take down Proteus but Proteus knocked the steel plate out of his head and took over Morph's body in issue #80. When the Exiles tracked him to the "Heroes Reborn" world, cosmic entities "O" and "Kay" kidnapped him, saying his presence has tipped the balance of power. Using a tiara hooked to a brainwasher device, his teammate [[Blink (comics)|Blink]] managed if not to restore his consciousness, to brainwash Proteus, forcing him to act like Morph, and access to only Morph's memories, functionally "bringing him again to life". With Proteus trapped and believing he is Morph, he remained an Exile to continue fixing damaged realities. Considering Morph's body does not burn out like other hosts, Morph's consciousness is still active beneath Proteus. Also, Proteus is immune to metal while in Morph's body, since wearing a metal tiara during the "Heroes Reborn" world did not kill him. However, concerns about some discrepancies in "Morph's" behavior forced his teammates to plan regular brainwashings with the same device, and, eventually, put him in stasis whenever his behavior would change again.

====Powers and abilities====
Morph's mutation to shape-shift has also made it so that his body is a [[Play-doh]]-like substance and he can reattach limbs after they have been severed. It has been stated that his body is composed of [[unstable molecules]]. He has also stated that his mutation gives him a high metabolism and makes him very hormonal. In one issue, [[Heather Hudson (Exiles)|Sasquatch]] said she was never able to detect a scent on Morph; [[Sabretooth (comics)#Age of Apocalypse and the Exiles|Sabretooth]] stated the same while hunting Proteus in Morph's body, noting how, in a crowd of "normal" people, Morph stands out like a sore thumb to Sabretooth's enhanced senses, whatever the form the shape-shifter takes. It also appears he has the ability to fly as demonstrated in ''Exiles'' #27. Due to his shapeshifting ability he does not wear any actual clothing, and he takes joy in pointing this out.

Even though Morph is a prankster who plays down his intelligence, he actually deceptively  smart. He has a [[Master's degree]] in [[computer engineering]], which he earned at Xavier's Institute.

===Age of Apocalypse===
In the ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'' (AoA), Morph was, like his "regular Marvel Universe" counterpart Changeling, an early recruit of the X-Men. Changeling was killed shortly after joining the X-Men while assuming the guise of Professor X. In the AoA reality, Kevin Sydney did not die while impersonating [[Professor X]], because in the Age of Apocalypse Xavier died before the X-Men were ever founded. The AoA Morph's personality and costume are largely the same as that of the ''Exiles'' version, based upon the latter's initial appearance.

In the AoA timeline, Morph often agitated his teammates with his off-the-wall sense of humour and inappropriate timing; he describes himself as wanting to die with a smile on his face when his time comes. Despite his happy-go-lucky attitude, Morph has displayed signs of a softer, more empathetic side several times. For example, he morphed into Sabretooth in an effort to comfort Blink while she doubted her abilities, and he later gave Rogue the strength to endure against the horseman Holocaust by acting as her son.
Shortly after the defeat of Apocalypse, he accompanied fellow X-Men Iceman, Wildchild and Exodus on an unspecified mission, during which they disappeared. Their fate has yet to be revealed, except for Wildchild, who has since joined a new team of Exiles.

===The Lost Generation===
{{main|Marvel: The Lost Generation}}

A Morph is also seen as a member of [[First Line (comics)|First Line]], set in Earth-616 but in the period after [[World War II]].<ref>[http://www.lostgenerationhandbook.com/thefirstline.htm Marvel: The Lost Generation<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===''X-Men: The Animated Series''===
[[Image:Morphanimted.png|right|thumb|250px|Morph in [[X-Men (TV series)|the ''X-Men'' animated series]]]]<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Morphanimted2.png|right|thumb|250px|The evil, brainwashed Morph]] -->
In the [[X-Men (TV series)|''X-Men'' animated series]], Morph (voiced by [[Ron Rubin]] in the English language version, and by [[Mitsuru Ogata]] in the Japanese dub) was a member of the X-Men and a close friend of Wolverine who was apparently killed in the second episode by [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]]. Wolverine was distraught by his death (he claimed that Morph was the only one who made him laugh) and blamed Cyclops for leaving him behind, but later overcame it, as many friends have passed in front of his eyes.

He reappeared in the second season as a recurring villain who was driven steadily mad by memories of his death. Eventually, it was revealed that [[Mr. Sinister]] took his shattered body, brought him back to life, but significantly brainwashed him and put some implants in him. He was divided into [[Dissociative identity disorder|two personalities]]: One who loved his X-teammates and one who hated them for leaving him behind. His best friend [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] was astonished to find out that Morph was alive, albeit he was fluctuating between "the good" and "the bad". Until the end of the season, through constant assurance from his teammates that "he was part of the team" and what [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] did "was in the name of the team", Morph helped in the final battle at the [[season finale]]--"[[Reunion (X-Men episode)|Reunion (Part 2)]]"--where he temporarily destroyed Sinister and was taken into custody. [[Professor X]] finally removed his implants, but determined that the psychological damage needed much more rehabilitation than seemed obvious.

Morph appeared in two more episodes as a patient on Muir Island (once on a hospital bed and once in a wheelchair as Cyclops and Wolverine were leaving the island) before starring in the episode "[[Courage (X-Men TV Episode)|Courage]]". There, Moira Mactaggert was curing his mental instability, which was provoked by the cruelty of Sinister and the overcoming of his guilt and fear of the Sentinels that nearly killed him. In the episode, he came back in the team, but when facing [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] again, Morph got a [[Flashback (psychological phenomenon)|flashback memory]] and was terrified. This fear later caused the abduction of Professor X by [[Master Mold]]. Morph overcame his fear with great efforts and when he understood that the Professor was in danger, he rushed to save him, despite his teammates' warnings and concerns. However, he showed great fighting skill and battled single-handedly many of the Sentinels and destroyed Master Mold himself at the end, changing to [[Angel (comics)|Angel]], [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]], [[Longshot]], and [[Omega Red]]. Although this was a great victory and his friends welcomed him back fully to the team, Morph was feeling unsure of himself and said that he had to work more on his mental health. He decided to go back to Dr. MacTaggert so that next time, he would return to the team in peak mental condition. He then makes a split second appearance in the episode "[[Beyond Good and Evil (X-Men episode)|Beyond Good and Evil (Part 1)]]" during Scott and Jean's wedding, sitting next to Jubilee.

His last appearance was in the [[series finale]] "[[Graduation Day (X-Men episode)|Graduation Day]]," where he briefly appeared as Professor X, while the latter was sick and dying, due to an illness. He appeared to have more of his past snickering humor, probably suggesting that he was now mentally healthy and back on the team, this time permanently.

====Behind the scenes====
Morph was originally placed in the ''X-Men'' animated series simply because the writers wanted to have a character die in the opening story arc in order to show how serious the series was.<ref name="Lewald Interview">{{cite web |url=http://forums.toonzone.net/showthread.php?t=200466 |title=Interview: Eric Lewald (Story Editor of X-Men) |accessdate=2008-01-15  |publisher=toonzone.net }}</ref>

Changeling was chosen because of his past ties to the X-Men, as well as his deceased status in the comics. He was practically a blank slate, so the writers were free to do with him as they wanted, without really angering fans of the character.

The name was changed from Changeling to Morph, since [[DC comics]] had the rights to the name Changeling at the time. (DC's Changeling is better known now as [[Beast Boy]] from the [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]]). Morph's death was, in fact, intended to stick, but due to his unexpected popularity, he was brought back.<ref name="Lewald Interview"/>

====Powers and abilities====
Morph has been able to effectively use his powers since they manifested, at which point he initially hid his abilities from others. It was not until Professor Charles Xavier asked him to enter his mutant academy that Morph realized his own potential. Xavier made him a part of his young team of New Mutants. Morph quickly became a best friend to all of his teammates and, although he was not the group's official leader, he was looked upon as a trusted confidant. He even completed a degree in computer engineering during his time on the team.

Morph is an omni-morph. As such, he is capable of shapeshifting into basically anything, regardless of size, shape, color, mass, or density.  Presumably he does this by tapping into an extra-dimensional source for the materials and mass needed.  He can create objects out of his mass, including clothing and weaponry.  Presumably he has a pseudo-healing factor due to the unstable nature of his molecular structure.  Also due to his unique physiological makeup, he possesses no discernible scent, unlike other shape-shifters — a fact that made the Wolverine of his reality "uneasy". This was one of the ways Wolverine recognized him, when Morph pretended to be Charles Xavier in front of his team-mates, who have their own scents. Another power is the ability of unaided flight, although how he does this is as yet unknown.
