'''The Changeling (Kevin Sydney)''' was a [[Marvel Comics]] [[fictional character|character]], and a member of the [[X-Men]]. Created by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and artist [[Werner Roth (comics)|Werner Roth]], he first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' #35 ([[1967#August|August 1967]]).

The Changeling was a [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] [[shapeshifting|shapeshifter]]. He was a short-lived X-Men adversary who, off-panel, joined the [[Professor X]]’s efforts and died shortly after.

In the [[1990s]], he was reinvented as [[Morph (comics)|Morph]] in the [[X-Men (animated series)|''X-Men'' animated series]], which led to versions of the character being revived in the “[[Age of Apocalypse]]” [[alternate reality]] storyline and the series ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]].''

==Fictional character history==
The Changeling originally worked for the villainous organization [[Factor Three]]. Following that group's defeat he reformed and unbeknownst to the X-Men was recruited by [[Professor X]] to replace him while he isolated himself to prepare for his fight against the [[Z'Nox]]<ref>''X-Men'' (first series) #65 (February 1970)</ref>. The Changeling, masquerading as Professor X, was killed in battle shortly after<ref>''X-Men'' (first series) #42 (March 1968)</ref>.  However, the X-Men thought it was actually Professor X who had died and did not find out until later that it was in fact Changeling<ref>''X-Men'' (first series) #65</ref>

Although the Changeling seemed destined for obscurity for many years, he was revived in alternate continuities as [[Morph (comics)|Morph]], first in the [[X-Men animated series]] and later in the [[Age of Apocalypse]] and ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]''.

==Powers and abilities==
