'''Mandrill''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. His first appearance was in ''Shanna the She-Devil #4''.

==Fictional character biography==
Jerome Beechman was the son of Frederic Beechman, a physicist at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] in New Mexico, and Margaret Beechman. Before conceiving his son, an explosion breached the facility's nuclear reactor, bombarding Frederic and a cleaning woman with radiation. When Jerome was born a year later, he possessed black skin (despite both of his parents being [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]]) and tufts of body hair. Jerome was despised by his family because of his freakish appearance, and when he was ten his father drove him out into the New Mexico desert and abandoned him.

While wandering the desert, Jerome encountered [[Nekra|Nekra Sinclair]], the daughter of the cleaning woman who had been bombarded by radiation in the same accident that had affected Beecham's father.  Although her parents were black, she had been born [[albinism|albino]] white and had developed [[vampire|vampiric]] features. For six years they lived by theft and scavenging until they were attacked by a lynch mob that thought they were monsters. The hatred triggered by the attack manifested both Beecham's and Sinclair's powers, which the two used to kill some of their attackers and escape the rest.

Now possessing a more monkey-like appearance, Beecham became a professional criminal and took the name of Mandrill. Traveling to Africa, the two plotted to overthrow and seize control of three small nations through a cult of personality powered by the Mandrill's ability to control women with his pheromones, and create a society free of the values that had led them to be rejected when they were young. This effort was thwarted by [[Shanna the She-Devil]] after battling her, and they were captured by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]<ref>''Shanna the She-Devil'' #4</ref> The two eventually escaped, kidnapping Shanna's father in the process, and eventually killing him.

For their next plot, they acted as political subversives, using the Mandrill's powers to raise [[Black Spectre#Black Spectre (organization)|Black Spectre]], a cult of black women committed to overthrowing America. As leader of Black Spectre, he battled the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]].<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #3</ref>  Alongside Nekra and Black Spectre he attacked the [[Empire State Building]] and battled Daredevil, the [[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]], and Shanna.<ref name="mnyc">{{cite book | last = Sanderson | first = Peter | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | date = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 49â€“51 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-14653-141-6}}</ref>  Mandrill and his allies were ultimately defeated on the [[White House]] lawn by the heroes.  Though Nekra was captured, Mandrill escaped the authorities.<ref>''Daredevil'' #110-112</ref>

Mandrill then raised yet another army of women, called Fem-Force (unrelated to [[AC Comics]]' [[Femforce]]).  He also recruited the [[Resistants (comics)|Mutant Force]] to aid him in his takeover of the United States and attacked an air force base in Colorado. This adventure was brought to an end by the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] and Mutant Force was captured.<ref>''Defenders'' #85</ref>  Mandrill then led Fem-Force against the [[Indian Point Energy Center]], where his parents were now employed. The Defenders again swung into action against him, but in the end Mandrill was defeated when he was shot by his own mother. Surviving, he escaped with the aid of some Fem-Force members.<ref>''Defenders'' #89-91</ref>

Mandrill has made no secret of his [[misogyny]], and has often taken [[rape|sexual advantage]] of his slaves. He married some of his slaves, becoming illegally polygamous. In the pages of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], it was alluded that he had made the [[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]] one of his many conquests.<ref>http://www.geocities.com/daredevil_villains/mandrill/mandrill.html (see first illus)</ref>

Mandrill's next appearance was when he tried to get revenge on the [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]] in Los Angeles, California, for killing Nekra, but was instead apparently slain himself.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #66</ref>

Mandrill somehow survived yet again and was later incarcerated in New York's experimental "Ant-Hill" prison, where all prisoners were reduced in size thanks to [[Henry Pym|Hank Pym]]'s Pym particles. An escape attempt was thwarted by [[She-Hulk]]. He then was incarcerated on [[The Raft (comics)|The Raft]], where he escaped during ''[[New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' #1 to join Crossfire's mind-controlling team of villains in ''Spider-Man: Breakout''. He was recently captured by [[Spider-Man]] in the pages of Marvel's February romance specials <ref>[http://www.milehighcomics.com/firstlook/020806/ihm1one.html Mile High Comics: First Look - Marvel's I Heart Marvel: Web Of Romance #1<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>; Mandrill is one of the comparative few mutants who have retained their powers in the wake of Marvel's [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]] event.
===Post-Civil War===
When [[Alyosha Kravinoff]], the son of [[Kraven the Hunter]] began collecting a [[zoo]] of animal themed superhumans, a Mandrill is clearly seen in one of the cages<ref>[[The Punisher War Journal]] Vol.2 #13</ref>. He later attacked the [[Punisher]], who took him down with a series of punches. Mandrill's left eye was dislodged in the attack.

The [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] has hired him as part of his criminal organization to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the [[Registration acts (comics)#2006 Superhuman Registration Act|Superhuman Registration Act]]. He helped them fight the New Avengers but was taken down by Doctor Strange.

===Secret Invasion===
He was one of many prisoners who escaped from the "[[The Raft (comics)|Raft]]." He assists with the Hood's group allies themselves with the heroes to fight a Skrull invasion force in Central Park<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #6</ref> As seen in flashbacks, the Hood has used his powers to free his men and clear their group of Skrull infiltrators.<ref>"The New Avengers" #46</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Mandrill is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who exudes [[pheromone]]s that give him the chemically-based ability to attract and enslave women. Certain women of heightened willpower can resist his control. A mild electrical shock can release victims from his control. His power is ineffective against males.

He also has superhuman strength, speed, agility, dexterity, flexibility, reflexes, coordination, balance, and endurance comparable to that of a [[great ape]]. He is a skilled acrobatic hand-to-hand combatant.

Mandrill has above normal intelligence, and is a gifted planner and strategist.

In at least once instance, the Mandrill used technological means to alter and augment his power so that the sight of him mesmerized the male [[Thing (comics)|Thing]].
