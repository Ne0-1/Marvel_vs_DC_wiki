==Fictional character biography==
Clay Quartermain is a high-ranking agent of the fictional espionage agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], a "blond-haired, fast-talking, grinning [[Burt Lancaster]]" sort<ref>[http://www.geocities.com/area51/nebula/8650/amazingheroes.html ''Amazing Heroes'' #26 (July 1, 1983): "Fury of the Past: A Nick Fury Hero History" by Lou Mougin]</ref> who first works with that organization's storied executive director, [[Nick Fury]], during S.H.I.E.L.D.'s first conflict with would-be world tyrant the [[Yellow Claw]], later revealed to have been a [[robot]] simulacrum of that [[Chinese people|Chinese]]-national [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|mandarin]]. Quartermain later becomes part of the [[U.S. military]]'s "Hulkbusters" operation, which attempted to capture and contain the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]].

Quartermain, along with many other agents, is seemingly killed by a self-aware, renegade "Deltan" variety of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s [[android|artificial-human]] "[[Life Model Decoy]]s", and replaced by one such LMD.<ref>''Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #2 (July 1988)</ref> The most advanced of the Deltite LMDs, it rebels upon learning it is not human, and perishes.<ref>''Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #6 (Nov. 1988)</ref> The real Quartermain is later found alive in cold storage in S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters, brainwashed by a faction of the [[terrorist]] organization [[HYDRA (comics)|HYDRA]], then is [[deprogrammed]].

[[Retconned]] as a former romantic interest of [[Jessica Jones]], Quartermain later becomes leader of [[Nick Fury's Howling Commandos|S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Paranormal Containment Unit]]. He was the agent sent to inform Jennifer Walters ([[She-Hulk]]) that she had been pressed into service as a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.<ref>''She-Hulk'' vol. 2, #14 (Jan. 2007)</ref> He next leads a new incarnation of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s "Hulkbusters" unit, here She-Hulk, Agent Crimson, and [[Agent Cheesecake]].

Quartermain remains an ally of Jessica Jones, both using each other to gain information for their respective needs. Clay uses Jones to bring down a conspiracy against the President of the United States. She later contacts him when the superhero [[Spider-Woman (Mattie Franklin)|Mattie Franklin]] makes a mysterious appearance in her apartment.
