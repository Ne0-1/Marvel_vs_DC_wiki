'''Isaiah Bradley''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He was an early product of the United States' Super-Soldier program (codenamed Project: Rebirth) during [[World War II]].  

==History==
As depicted in the 2003 [[limited series]] ''Truth: Red, White and Black'', the WWII Super Soldier program of 1942, operated by "Reinstein" (Dr. Emile Erskine), used [[African American]] test subjects to rediscover the formula which turned Steve Rogers into [[Captain America]]. The clandestine experimentation that empowered Isaiah held similarities with the [[Tuskegee Syphilis Study]]. 

==Fictional character biography==
When the other two remaining members of Bradley's test group (Maurice Canfield and Sgt. Lucas Evans) died, Bradley stole a spare costume intended for [[Captain America]] and engaged in a self-directed suicide mission to destroy the Super-Soldier efforts of the Nazis (whose program had a common origin with the American program) at the Schwarzebitte concentration camp.  The mission ended with Bradley's capture (and later release) by the Germans.  He was later rescued, only to be subjected to a court-martial and imprisoned at [[Leavenworth]] around 1943.  In 1960, Bradley was pardoned by [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|President Eisenhower]], and released.

Isaiah Bradley is an underground legend among much of the African-American community in the Marvel Universe.  A number of the most noted Africans and African-Americans of the twentieth century's last four decades visited Bradley as a sign of respect and, in many cases, hero worship.  His visitors have included [[Malcolm X]], [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Angela Davis]], [[Alex Haley]], [[Nelson Mandela]], and [[Colin Powell]].  Outside the Black community, however, he remains largely unknown.  When he arrived at the wedding of [[Storm (comics)|Storm]] and the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] as a special guest, [[Luke Cage]] was awestruck, while [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] was totally unaware of the man's identity or importance. 

===Josiah X===

While Isaiah was in prison, the government attempted to use his altered DNA to create another Super-Soldier.  After 39 attempts the result was a child named Josiah, Isaiah and Faith's genetic son.  [[Josiah X]], as he would later call himself, was born to a surrogate mother, who smuggled him out of the government's clutches.

===Steve Rogers===
Meanwhile, the long-term effects of the test serum had severely damaged Isaiah Bradley's mind and body, similar in part to the effects of various steroids and [[Alzheimer's]]. In 2003, Steve Rogers (Captain America) learned the truth behind the Super-Soldier program and attempted a reconciliation with the now- childlike Isaiah Bradley.  However, Captain America never discovered that the true mastermind behind the Super-Soldier program was the clandestine organization [[Weapon Plus]], and that Bradley was only one in a long line of ''Weapons'', including [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] and [[Fantomex]].

===Patriot===
{{main|Patriot (comics)}}
Isaiah is also the grandfather of Elijah Bradley (aka [[Patriot (comics)|Patriot]] of the [[Young Avengers]]). Elijah claimed that his powers originated from a blood transfusion from Isaiah, whereby he gained the abilities of the Super-Soldier Serum. However, it was subsequently revealed that this was a lie, and Elijah really gained his powers from [[Mutant Growth Hormone]]. Elijah was later critically injured in battle with the [[Skrulls]] and [[Kree]]. This forced Isaiah to give him a blood tranfusion, and as a result, Elijah develops actual super powers.

==Powers & abilities==
Isaiah possesses agility, strength, speed, endurance, and reaction time superior to any Olympic athlete who has ever or ever will compete. Once it was metabolized, the Super-Soldier formula enhanced all of his bodily functions to the peak of human efficiency. His body eliminates any excessive build-up of lactic acid and other fatigue poisons in his muscles, granting him phenomenal endurance. He also has an extraordinary immunity to disease. His aging process was also retarded to some degree. Isaiah was trained in unarmed combat by the [[US Army]].

==Equipment==
Isaiah carried an unpainted concave triangular metal shield with an embossed eagle, useful for either defense or offense. For protection he wore a loose chain mesh shirt over light padding, the shirt was capable of blunting the impact of most small arms fire.

==Alternate versions==
* In ''Captain America'' (4th series) #28, an Isaiah Bradley from an alternate Earth became Captain America, and never married.  Later, he was elected president and served two terms.  He traveled back in time, incidentally crossing to [[Earth-616]], then brought the mainstream Captain America and Rebecca Quan forward into his own time to prevent his daughter, Rebecca "Becky" Barnes, from traveling to Earth-616.
