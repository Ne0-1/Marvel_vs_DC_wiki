'''Isaiah Bradley''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comic]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He was an early product of the United States' Super Soldier program (codenamed Operation: Rebirth) during [[World War II]].  As depicted in the series "Truth: Red, White and Black," the WWII Super Soldier program of 1942, operated by "Reinstein" (Dr. Emile Erskine), used [[African American]] test subjects in a beta phase.  The final surviving beta phase subject of the Super Soldier program was Isaiah Bradley.

When the other two remaining members of Bradley's test group (Maurice Canfield and Sgt. Lucas Evans) died, Bradley stole the costume intended for [[Captain America]] (the first of the production phase Super Soldier subjects) and engaged in a self-directed suicide mission to destroy the Super Soldier efforts of the Nazis (whose program had a common origin with the American program) at the Schwarzebitte concentration camp.  The mission ended with Bradley's capture (and later release) by the Germans.  He was later rescued, only to be subjected to a court-martial and imprisoned at [[Leavenworth]] around 1943.  In 1960, Bradley was pardoned by [[Eisenhower]], and released.

While Isaiah was in prison, the government attempted to use his altered DNA to create another Super Soldier.  The result was a child named Josiah, Isaiah and Faith's genetic son.  Josiah was born to a surrogate mother, who smuggled him out of the government's clutches.

Meanwhile, the long-term effects of the test serum had severely damaged Isaiah Bradley's mind and body (similar to the effects of various steroids).  In 2003, Steve Rogers (Captain America) learned the truth behind the Super Soldier program and attempted a reconciliation with the now childlike Isaiah Bradley. However, Captain America never discovered that the true mastermind behind the Super Soldier program was the clandestine organization [[Weapon X|Weapon Plus]], and that Bradley was only the first in a long line of ''Weapons'', including [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] and [[Fantomex]]. As Captain America was Weapon I (a volunteer test subject, according to Fantomex), it can be assumed that Bradley was Weapon 0.

Isaiah is also the grandfather of Elijah Bradley (aka [[Patriot (comics)|Patriot]] of the [[Young Avengers]]).  Elijah claimed that his powers originated from a blood transfusion from Isaiah, whereby he gained the abilities of the Super Serum. However, it was subsequently revealed that this was a lie, and Elijah really gained his powers from [[Mutant Growth Hormone]].

===Alternate realities===

In ''Captain America'' Volume 4 #28, an Isaiah Bradley from an alternate Earth became Captain America, and never married.  Later, he was elected president and served two terms.  He traveled back in time, incidentally crossing to [[Earth-616]], then brought the mainstream Captain America and Rebecca Quan forward into his own time to prevent his daughter Rebecca "Becky" Barnes from traveling to Earth-616.
