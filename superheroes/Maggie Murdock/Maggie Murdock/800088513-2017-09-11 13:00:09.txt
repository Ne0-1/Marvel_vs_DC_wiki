===Film===

Maggie Murdock can be seen in the Director's Cut of ''[[Daredevil (film)|Daredevil]]'', portrayed by Vivian Palermo Winther and credited as the Nun. Sister Maggie can be seen briefly in a flashback with Matt after he gets struck by the chemicals that gave him his powers. The scene is where Maggie visits the hospital and tells Matt to sleep. He touches the cross around her neck.

===Television===

* Maggie Murdock is referenced twice in ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Daredevil]]'', both times in flashbacks. In "Cut Man", her former husband [[Jack Murdock (comics)|Jack Murdock]] calls her and leaves a voicemail. Anticipating he will be killed by [[Roscoe Sweeney]] after his next fight, Jack asks Maggie to take care of Matt. Later on, when [[Stick (comics)|Stick]] is being escorted to his first meeting with Matt, he asks a nun if the mother is dead, to which the nun says "that is another story".
* In the last minutes of [[The Defenders (miniseries)|''The Defenders'']], Matt, seemingly killed in the destruction of Midland Circle, is shown waking up in a convent being tended to by nuns, one of whom calls for a Sister Maggie, heavily implied to be Maggie Murdock.
