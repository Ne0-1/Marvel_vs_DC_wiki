:''For the Australian journalist known as Sam Lane, see [[Samantha Lane]].''

'''Sam Lane''' is a fictional character, the father of [[Lois Lane]] and [[Lucy Lane]] in ''[[Superman]]'' comics. Along with his wife Ella, he was introduced in ''[[Superman's Girlfriend Lois Lane]]'' #13 (November 1959)
as a horse farmer in the town of Pittsdale. 

Following ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' Sam Lane was reinvented as a hard-bitten and outspoken [[US Army]] [[General]], with an awkward relationship with his daughter. It was explained that Lane had wanted his eldest child to be a boy, so had treated Lois as a surrogate son, when he was present at all.

This version first appeared in ''[[Adventures of Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]]'' #424 (January 1987), the first retitled issue of the former ''Superman'' title. He became a more significant character following Lois' engagement to [[Clark Kent]], being highly unimpressed with the mild-mannered reporter despite his obvious commitment to Lois. This almost, but not quite, extended to refusing to attend the wedding.

When [[Lex Luthor]] became [[President of the United States]], he made Lane [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]]. This inevitably led to Lois, as an investigative journalist trying to prove Luthor was crooked, opposing her father, especially during the build up to the [[Our Worlds At War|Imperiex War]]. During the War, General Lane was apparently killed by an Imperiex probe, when he detonated the nuclear engine of his tank to crack the shell of the probe and give [[Black Lightning]] the chance to get through its armour.

In ''[[Action Comics]]'' #832 (December 2005), set at [[Halloween]], Sam Lane's ghost appeared to Lois while she was trapped in a car, enabling them to talk through their unresolved issues. However, the last scene of the issue showed the "ghost" leaning against a wall and watching the sunrise, implying that General Lane might still be alive.
