'''Edwin Jarvis''' is a [[supporting character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] titles, ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'', ''[[Iron Man]]'', and ''[[Spider-Man]]''.

==Publication history==
Jarvis first appeared in ''Tales of Suspense'' #59 (November 1964), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Don Heck]].

Edwin Jarvis received an entry in the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update '89]]'' #4, and ''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Avengers'' (2004).

==Fictional character biography==
{{Quote|Born of modest origins, he had quickly risen through the ranks of household employ, his loyalty and dedication finally placing him at the apex of domestic service as valiant valet to the Earth's Mightiest Heroes!|Prologue from an ''Avengers'' backup story featuring Jarvis<ref>Michelinie, David; Stern, Roger; PÃ©rez, George; and Day, Gene. "Bully", ''The Avengers'' #201 (November 1980).</ref>}}

Jarvis served in the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] during [[World War II]] and was its champion boxer three years running.  He later moved to the United States where he became manservant to the Starks ([[Howard Stark|Howard]] and [[Maria Stark|Maria]]) and watched over their mansion even after their deaths.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia|last=DeFalco|first=Tom|year= 2006|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|isbn=978-0-7566-2358-6|page=150}}</ref>

[[ Man|Anthony "Tony" Stark]] (the son of Howard and Maria) called the first meeting of the Avengers as [[Iron Man]] and donated the house as headquarters, so that it became [[Avengers Mansion]]. Jarvis grew accustomed to the guests and served the Avengers for many years thereafter, acting as a father figure to some of the newcomers. Jarvis was there, for the first guest to become an Avenger, the time-lost [[Captain America]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Heroes of film, comics and American culture|last=Detora|first=Lisa|year= 2009|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-3827-3|page=113}}</ref>

He was the only one to stay with the Avengers for their entire existence, a distinction not even Captain America can claim. As a result, Captain America has stated that Jarvis should be regarded as just as much of an Avenger as he is.

Jarvis spent some time as the primary babysitter for [[Franklin Richards]], the super-powered son of [[Mister Fantastic]] and the [[Invisible Woman]] when they were residing at the mansion. He also served as the sponsor to future Avengers member [[Silverclaw]] while she was growing up, and she has come to regard him as an uncle.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3 #8 (September, 1998)</ref>

Being manservant to the Avengers meant that Jarvis has had to deal with their enemies himself on several occasions. In ''Avengers'' #59 and #60 (December 1969, January 1970) he was assaulted by intruders into the mansion and bound and gagged. He has also been involved personally in many adventures, including leading the evacuation of a stalled subway train during a [[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|city-wide disaster]] and battling a demonically possessed car.  During this time he dated a woman he rescued named Glory.  Jarvis defended the floating [[Hydro-Base|Hydrobase]] against a horde of robots built by [[Doctor Doom]] during the [[Acts of Vengeance]] crisis. He was present when one of the many incarnations of the [[Masters of Evil]] attacked the mansion. He was brutally beaten by Mr Hyde while Captain America was forced to watch.<ref>''Avengers 273-277'' (1986-87)</ref> It took some time for Jarvis to recover from his injuries. He even wore an [[eyepatch]] for some time. Jarvis personally confronted [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], risking great danger, after realizing the villain had tricked his way inside the mansion in ''Avengers'' #400.

In his duties as the Avengers' manservant, he was entrusted with items of great power, including the [[Casket of Ancient Winters]].

When the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] were formed, Jarvis was called back after taking a holiday "for the first time in years", having been informed that his 'special' services were once again needed. Jarvis often confronts [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] over the man's poor kitchen etiquette, a battle only new member [[Spider-Man]]'s [[Aunt May]] was able to win. Jarvis seemingly struck up a relationship with May, who had moved into [[Stark Tower]] with Peter and Mary Jane after her house burnt down. When Spider-Man switched sides during the Civil War, however, Aunt May and Mary Jane fled Stark Tower to live in hiding.

In a ''New Avengers'' ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' story, Jarvis was shot by an employee of Tony Stark, who was opposed to Stark using technology he invented to enforce the [[Superhuman Registration Act]]. However, it appears Jarvis recovers from this wound, as in "[[Civil War: The Initiative]]", he is shown to be working again. He also humorously mentions that if Tony Stark allowed "that [[Tigra]] %^#$" in the new incarnation of the Avengers, Tony would need to find someone else to do the laundry. Tigra had worked for Tony Stark's side throughout the entirety of the ''Civil War'' incident.{{Issue|date=June 2011}}

In the 2008 storyline ''[[Spider-Man: One More Day|One More Day]]'', Jarvis is given over $2,000,000 by Stark to pay for Aunt May's hospital bills following an assassination attempt in the aftermath of Spider-Man's decision to publicly reveal his true identity. Jarvis visibly breaks down upon seeing her in the hospital bed, confessing his deep love to the Parkers.<ref>''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #544</ref> As a consequence of the "One More Day" storyline, however, Spider-Man's timeline have undergone a major continuity overhaul,<ref>[[J. Michael Straczynski]] and [[Joe Quesada]]. "One More Day", Part 4 of 4, ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #545 (January 2008), Marvel Comics</ref> including Jarvis' relationship with the Parkers. 

Later that year, in the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline, it is revealed that Jarvis has been replaced by a [[Skrull]] agent (though the exact time is unclear, it was revealed in a summary of "Secret Invasion",{{Issue|date=June 2011}} when describing the Jarvis Skrull, that it was before Jarvis started his relationship with May).<ref>''[[Secret Invasion]]'' #1</ref> Using a computer virus, he disables a number of Stark Enterprises facilities, as well as Stark's [[Iron Man's armor|armor]]. This agent also obtained access to Tony Stark's records on [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Robert Reynolds (The Sentry)]] in order to discover his weaknesses, as the Skrulls were unable to duplicate his powers because its limits were unknown even to Stark.<ref>''[[The Mighty Avengers|Mighty Avengers]]'' #14</ref> He later approaches [[Maria Hill]] on the destroyed S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier in the middle of the ocean and tells her to surrender along with her crew. She uses a Life Model Decoy in that spot as the real one escaped and detonated the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier. During the fight between [[Veranke]] and Criti Noll's forces against the heroes and villains, The Skrull-Jarvis (who somehow survived the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier explosion) watches from Avengers Tower as the energy washes over hero, villain and Skrull alike. While holding [[Jessica Jones]] and [[Luke Cage]]'s child, he comments that it doesn't matter if the Skrulls win or lose, so long as "God's" will is done.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #7</ref>

After the final battle, the real Jarvis is discovered alive, prompting Jessica Jones to discover that her baby had been taken by the Skrull impostor.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #8</ref> Jarvis is later shown in a [[support group]] meeting with the others that had been replaced by Skrulls.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #20</ref> The Skrull Jarvis was eventually found in a hideout and was shot by [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] after returning the baby to Luke Cage.<ref>''New Avengers'' #49</ref>

During the "Earth's Mightiest" story arc, the real Jarvis, having refused to serve under [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]]'s [[Dark Avengers|new group of Avengers]] is sought out by Hercules and [[Amadeus Cho]] to be a part of the new [[The Mighty Avengers|Mighty Avengers]] team, Amadeus having determined that Jarvis is the one constant of the Avengers.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #21</ref>

==Personal life==
Edwin Jarvis once started a pen pal relationship with a young girl who would grow up to be the superhero [[Silverclaw]]. Her trip to the United States to meet Edwin Jarvis would be foiled when she was forced into helping terrorists in a massive attack. Silverclaw's efforts helped the people in danger at the airport including Edwin Jarvis himself.{{Issue|date=June 2011}}

==Other versions==

===House of M===
In the ''[[House of M]]: Iron Man'' series, the A.I. system in Tony Stark's suit is referred to as "Jarvis", predating the AI version of JARVIS seen in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].<ref>''House of M: Iron M'' #1-3 (September 2005)</ref>

===Marvel Zombies===
In the [[Marvel Zombies]] mini-series in which all of the world's superheroes (and many of the villains) are transformed by a sentient alien virus into flesh-eating zombies, it is revealed that Jarvis was torn apart and shared-out amongst the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>"Marvel Zombies: Dead Days" One-Shot (July 2007)</ref> As [[Alternative versions of Captain America#Marvel Zombies|Colonel America]] speculated, he appears to have been so mortified by the spectacle of his beloved Avengers as hungry corpses that he barely put up a fight.

===Marvel Noir===
In the [[Marvel Noir]] universe, Edwin Jarvis is Tony Stark's engineer and personal assistant.<ref>Iron Man Noir #1</ref>

===MC2===
Jarvis, now with visibly gray hair, continues to serve as the butler to the [[A-Next|Avengers Next]] in the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] universe. During the initial 12 issue run of A Next, Jarvis is shown as a mentor to the young heroes. Along with Scott Lang, Edwin Jarvis attempts to aide and assist the Avengers anyway he can. He's later joined by Tony Stark and a blind Hawkeye.

===Ultimate Jarvis===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Edwin Jarvis is different from his original version and is much more sarcastic and acerbic towards his employer [[Ultimate Iron Man (comics)|Antonio "Tony" Stark]].<ref>The Ultimates #2</ref> This Jarvis is Tony's personal butler and not of his Avengers-like team, the Ultimates. While Tony dated and became engaged to his teammate [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)#Ultimate Black Widow|Natasha Romanova]], Jarvis was shown to be continuously at odds with her and both were quick to hurl insults at the other. Jarvis was later shot in the head by Natasha when she revealed herself to Stark as the traitor within the [[Ultimates]] team. His death is one of the contributing factors to Stark's descent into full-blown [[alcoholism]].<ref>The Ultimates 2 #13</ref>

====Successors====
'''Mrs. Jarvis''' is the young female assistant of [[Gregory Stark]] (Tony's older brother.<ref>''Ultimate Avengers'' #1-6</ref> It's unknown if she shares any connection with the previous Jarvis. In ''[[Ultimate Comics: New Ultimates]]'', Tony reveals he has a recent younger, Asian servant named '''Linda''' whom he calls Jarvis.<ref>New Ultimates #1</ref> Since ''[[Ultimate Comics: Ultimates]]'', the new Jarvis is personal servant '''William''' that tolerates being called Jarvis by Tony.<ref>Ultimate Comics: Ultimates #1</ref>
