Jarvis served in the [[UK|British]] [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] and was their undefeated boxing champion three years running. After the [[World War II|war]] he moved to America where he became [[butler]] to Howard and Maria Stark and watched over their mansion even after their deaths.

The Starks' son, Tony, called the first meeting of the Avengers as [[Iron Man]] and donated the house as headquarters, so that it became [[Avengers Mansion]]. Jarvis grew accustomed to the guests and served the Avengers for many years on, acting as a father figure to some of the newcomers. He was the only one to stay with the Avengers for their entire existence, a distinction not even [[Captain America]] can claim. As a result, Cap has stated that Jarvis should be regarded as just as much of an Avenger as he is.

Jarvis spent some time as the primary babysitter for [[Franklin Richards]], the super-powered son of [[Mister Fantastic]] and the [[Invisible Woman]] when they were residing at the mansion. He also served as the sponsor to future Avengers member [[Silverclaw]] while she was growing up, and she has come to regard him as an uncle.

Being butler to the Avengers meant that Jarvis has had to deal with their enemies himself on several occasions. In ''Avengers #59'' and ''60'' (December 1969 - January 1970) he was assaulted by intruders into the mansion and bound and gagged two issues in a row.

He has also been involved personally in many adventures, including leading the evacuation of a stalled subway train during a [[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|city-wide disaster]], and battling a demonically possessed car.  During this time he dated a woman he rescued named Glory.  Jarvis defended the floating Hydrobase against a horde of robots built by Doctor Doom during the [[Acts of Vengeance]] crisis. He was present when one of the many incarnations of the [[Masters of Evil]] attacked the mansion. He was brutally beaten while [[Captain America]] was forced to watch. It took some time for Jarvis to recover from his injuries. He even wore an [[eyepatch]] for some time. Jarvis personally confronted [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] himself, risking great danger, after realizing the villain had tricked his way inside the mansion in ''Avengers #400''.

In his duties as the Avengers butler, he was entrusted with items of great power, including the [[Casket of Ancient Winters]].

When the [[New Avengers]] were formed, Jarvis was called back after taking a holiday "for the first time in years," having been informed that his 'special' services were once again needed. Jarvis often confronts [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] over the man's poor kitchen etiquette, a battle only new member [[Spider-Man]]'s [[Aunt May]] was able to win. He struck up a relationship with May, who had moved into Stark Tower with Peter and Mary Jane after her house burnt down. When Spider-Man switched sides during the Civil War, however, Aunt May and Mary Jane  had to flee Stark Tower and live in hiding. 

In a recent New Avengers "Civil War" story, Jarvis was shown getting shot by an employee of Tony Stark, who was opposed to Tony using technology he invented to enforce the Superhuman Registration Act.  However, it appears Jarvis recovers from this wound, as in ''[[Civil War: The Initiative]]'', he is shown to be working again. He also humorously mentions that if Tony Stark allowed "that Tigra %^#$" in the new incarnation of the Avengers, Tony would need to find someone else to do the laundry. Tigra had worked for Tony Stark's side throughout the entirety of the ''Civil War'' incident.

In ''Spider-Man: [[One More Day (comics)|One More Day]]'', Jarvis is given a slightly over $2,000,000 check by Stark to pay for Aunt May's hospital bills after an angry confrontation with Peter. She was dying after being shot by a sniper (hired by The Kingpin) in revenge once Stark convinced Spider-Man to unmask. Jarvis visibly breaks down upon seeing her in the hospital bed, confessing his deep love to the Parkers.<ref>''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #544</ref>

As a consequence of the "One More Day" storyline, the Spider-Man comics have undergone a major continuity overhaul, of which many consequences have yet to be revealed.  With Peter Parker's identity secret again, there may be no way to connect May and Jarvis -- 
an upcoming issue of New Avengers is advertised as addressing Spider-Man's "new" history with the team, which would include this time period.

In ''[[Secret Invasion]]'', it is revealed that Jarvis has been replaced by a [[Skrull]] agent.<ref>''[[Secret Invasion]]'' #1</ref> Using a computer virus, he disables a number of Stark Enterprises facilities, as well as Stark's Iron Man armor. This agent also obtained access to Tony Stark's records on [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Robert Reynolds (The Sentry)]] in order to discover his weaknesses, as the Skrulls were unable to duplicate his powers because its limits were unknown even to Stark.<ref>''[[Mighty Avengers]]'' #14</ref> He later approaches Maria Hill on the destroyed S.H.I.E.L.D. Hellicarrier in the middle of the ocean and tells her to surrender along with her crew. She used a Life Model Decoy in that spot as the real one escaped and detonated the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier. During the fight between Veranke and Criti Noll's forces against the heroes and villains, The Skrull-Jarvis (who somehow survived the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier explosion) watches from Avengers Tower as the energy washes over hero, villain and Skrull alike. While holding Jessica Jones and Luke Cage's child, he comments that it doesn't matter if the Skrulls win or lose, so long as "God's" will is done.<ref>Secret Invasion #7</ref>

After the final battle, the real Jarvis is discovered alive, prompting Jessica Jones to discover that her baby had been taken by the Skrull impostor.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #8</ref>

==Personal life==
* Jarvis once started a pen pal relationship with a young girl who would grow up to be the superhero [[Silverclaw]]. Her trip to America to meet Jarvis would be foiled when she was forced into helping terrorists in a massive attack. Silverclaw's efforts helped the people in danger at the airport, including Jarvis himself.

* Jarvis has developed a dislike for former Avenger and Initiative member [[Tigra]]. He refers to her as a 'bitch' to Tony Stark when he was contemplating members for a new team, and went as far as threatening to quit if Stark asked her to rejoin the team. It has not been revealed why these feelings exist.

==Other versions==
===House of M===
In the ''[[House of M]]: Iron Man'' series, the A.I. system in Tony Stark's suit is referred to as "Jarvis".

===Marvel Zombies===
In the [[Marvel Zombies]] mini-series in which all of the world's superheroes (and many of the villains) are transformed by a sentient alien virus into flesh-eating zombies, it is revealed that Jarvis was torn apart and shared-out amongst the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. As [[Colonel America]] speculated, he appears to have been so mortified by the spectacle of his beloved Avengers as hungry corpses that he barely put up a fight.

===MC2===
Jarvis, now with visibly gray hair, continues to serve as the butler to the [[A-Next|Avengers Next]] in the [[MC2]] universe.

===Ultimate Jarvis===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]], Jarvis is [[homosexual|gay]] and is much more sarcastic and acerbic towards his employer, [[Ultimate Iron Man|Tony Stark]]. Here Jarvis is the personal butler of Tony Stark, and not of his Avengers-like team, the Ultimates. While Tony dated and eventually became engaged to his teammate, the Ultimate version of [[Black_Widow_%28Marvel_Comics%29#Ultimate_Black_Widow|Natasha Romanova, aka Black Widow]], Jarvis was shown to be continuiously at odds with her and both were quick to hurl insults at the other. Jarvis was later shot in the head by Natasha when she revealed herself to Stark as the traitor within the [[Ultimates]] team. His death (along with Black Widow's betrayal) might be contributing factors to Tony Stark's descent into full-blown alcoholism.

He can converse with Stark with considerable sophistication and is sarcastic concerning his creator's recklessness. He is voiced by [[Paul Bettany]], who admits he had little idea of what the role was even as he recorded it, simply doing it as a favor for his friend, director [[Jon Favreau]].<ref>Huver, Scott.
