'''Edwin Jarvis''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[supporting character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] title, ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]''.

== Character History ==

Jarvis is a [[butler]] who began his career serving Howard Stark and Maria Stark and watched their mansion even after their death. Beforehand, he had been the undefeated boxing champion in the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] for two years running.

The Starks' son, Tony, called the first meeting of the Avengers as the [[Iron Man]] and donated the house as headquarters, so that it became [[Avengers Mansion]]. Jarvis grew accustomed to the guests and served the Avengers for many years on, acting as a father figure to some newcomers. During the fourth [[Masters of Evil]] attack, Jarvis was savagely beaten and almost lost an eye to the marauders. This soured him towards the group even after some of them reformed to form the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]. He is the only one to stay with the Avengers for their entire existence, a distinction not even [[Captain America]] can claim, and, as a result, Cap has stated that Jarvis should be regarded as just as much of an Avenger as he is.

Jarvis is the most famous comic book butler other than [[Alfred Pennyworth]], butler to [[Batman]]. Jarvis's name may actually be a nod to Alfred: Alfred originally introduced himself in ''Batman'' #16 (May&ndash;June [[1943]]), two decades before Edwin Jarvis's [[first appearance]], as the "son of Jarvis".

{{spoiler}}
After Tony Stark reformed the Avengers and [[Spider-Man]] moved his family into [[Stark Tower]], Jarvis and [[Aunt May]] began to develop a romantic relationship. Also, in the recent New Avengers "Civil War" story, Jarvis was shown getting shot by an employee of Tony Stark, who was opposed to the Superhuman Registration act.

==Ultimate Marvel==
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]], Jarvis was [[homosexual|gay]] and was much more sarcastic and acerbic towards his employer, [[Ultimate Iron Man|Tony Stark]]. (Here Jarvis is the personal butler of Tony Stark, and not of his Avengers-like team, the Ultimates.) Jarvis was shot in the head by [[Black Widow (comics)|Black Widow]] when she revealed herself to Stark as the traitor within the [[Ultimates]] team. Whether or not he survived is still unknown.

==MC2==
Jarvis, now with visibly gray hair, continues to serve as the butler to the [[A-Next|Avengers Next]] in the [[MC2]] universe.

==Marvel Zombies==
In the [[Marvel Zombies]] mini-series in which all of the world's superheroes (and many of the villains) are transformed by a sentient alien virus into flesh-eating zombies, it is revealed that Jarvis was torn apart and shared-out amongst the [[Avengers]]. He appears to have been so mortified by the spectacle of his beloved Avengers as hungry corpses that he barely put up a fight.
