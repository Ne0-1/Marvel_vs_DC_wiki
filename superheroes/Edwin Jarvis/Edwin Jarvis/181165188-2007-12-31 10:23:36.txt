'''Edwin Jarvis''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[supporting character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] title, ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]''.

==Fictional character biography==
Jarvis served in the [[UK|British]] [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] and was their undefeated boxing champion three years running. After the [[World War II|war]] he moved to America where he became [[butler]] to Howard and Maria Stark and watched over their mansion even after their deaths.

The Starks' son, Tony, called the first meeting of the Avengers as [[Iron Man]] and donated the house as headquarters, so that it became [[Avengers Mansion]]. Jarvis grew accustomed to the guests and served the Avengers for many years on, acting as a father figure to some of the newcomers. He is the only one to stay with the Avengers for their entire existence, a distinction not even [[Captain America]] can claim. As a result, Cap has stated that Jarvis should be regarded as just as much of an Avenger as he is.

Jarvis spent some time as the primary babysitter for [[Franklin Richards]], the super-powered son of [[Mister Fantastic]] and the [[Invisible Woman]] when they were residing at the mansion. He also served as the sponsor to future Avengers member [[Silverclaw]] while she was growing up, and she has come to regard him as an uncle.

Being butler to the Avengers means that Jarvis has had to deal with their enemies himself on several occasions. In ''Avengers #59'' and ''60'' (December 1969 - January 1970) he was assaulted by intruders into the mansion and bound and gagged two issues in a row.

He has also been involved personally in many adventures, including leading the evacuation of a stalled subway train during a [[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|city-wide disaster]]. He was present when one of the many incarnations of the [[Masters of Evil]] attacked the mansion. He was brutally beaten while [[Captain America]] is forced to watch. It took some time for Jarvis to recover from his injuries. He even wore an [[eyepatch]] for some time. Jarvis has personally confronted [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] himself, risking great danger, after realizing the villain had tricked his way inside the mansion in ''Avengers #400''.

In his duties as the Avengers butler, he has been entrusted with items of great power, including the [[Casket of Ancient Winters]].

When the [[New Avengers]] were formed, Jarvis was called back after taking a holiday for the first time in years, having been informed that his 'special' services were once again needed, although he often confronted [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] over the man's poor kitchen etiquette. He also struck up a relationship with new member [[Spider-Man]]'s [[Aunt May]] In the recent New Avengers "Civil War" story, Jarvis was shown getting shot by an employee of Tony Stark, who was opposed to the Superhuman Registration act.  However, it appears he recovers from this wound as in ''[[Civil War: The Initiative]]'', he is shown to be working again. He also humorously mentions that if Tony Stark allowed "that Tigra %^#$" in the new incarnation of the Avengers, Tony would need to find someone else to do the laundry. Tigra had worked for Tony Stark's side throughout the entirety of the ''Civil War'' incident. In ''Spider-Man: [[One More Day (comics)|One More Day]]'', Jarvis, distraught over the fate of May is given a $200,000 cheque by Stark to pay for her hospital bills.

==Personal life==
*Jarvis once started a pen pal relationship with a young girl who would grow up to be the superhero [[Silverclaw]]. Her trip to America to meet Jarvis would be foiled when she was forced into helping terrorists in a massive attack. Silverclaw's efforts helped the people in danger at the airport, including Jarvis himself.

*[[Tigra]] seems to enjoy flirting with Jarvis, which flusters him greatly.

*After Tony Stark reformed the Avengers and [[Spider-Man]] moved his family into [[Stark Tower]], Jarvis and [[Aunt May]] began to develop a romantic relationship. When Jarvis learns of May being shot, Stark instructed him to deliver a check for two million dollars to the hospital that May was staying at in order to cover the medical fees.

==Character==
Jarvis is the second most famous comic book butler after [[Alfred Pennyworth]], butler to [[Batman]]. Jarvis's name may actually be a nod to Alfred: Alfred originally introduced himself in ''Batman'' #16 (May&ndash;June [[1943]]) as the "son of Jarvis", two decades before Edwin Jarvis's [[first appearance]].

==Other versions==
===Marvel Zombies===
In the [[Marvel Zombies]] mini-series in which all of the world's superheroes (and many of the villains) are transformed by a sentient alien virus into flesh-eating zombies, it is revealed that Jarvis was torn apart and shared-out amongst the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. He appears to have been so mortified by the spectacle of his beloved Avengers as hungry corpses that he barely put up a fight.

===MC2===
Jarvis, now with visibly gray hair, continues to serve as the butler to the [[A-Next|Avengers Next]] in the [[MC2]] universe.

===Ultimate Jarvis===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]], Jarvis is [[homosexual|gay]] and is much more sarcastic and acerbic towards his employer, [[Ultimate Iron Man|Tony Stark]]. (Here Jarvis is the personal butler of Tony Stark, and not of his Avengers-like team, the Ultimates.) Jarvis was shot in the head by [[Black Widow (comics)|Black Widow]] when she revealed herself to Stark as the traitor within the [[Ultimates]] team.

==In other media==
===Television===
Jarvis appeared in the animated ''[[The Avengers: United They Stand|Avengers]]'' series voiced by [[Graham Harley]].

===Films===
Jarvis also made a quick appearance as Tony Stark's butler in ''[[Ultimate Avengers]]'' (voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]]) and has a little larger role in the movie's sequel.

===Video games===
Jarvis appears as a non-playable character in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'' voiced by [[Philip Proctor]]. He is seen in Stark Towers. Edwin Jarvis has special dialogue with [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]] and [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]].
