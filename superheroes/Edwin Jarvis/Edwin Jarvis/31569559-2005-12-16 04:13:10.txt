'''Edwin Jarvis''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[supporting character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] title, ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]''.

Jarvis is a [[butler]] who began his career serving Howard Stark and Maria Stark and watched their mansion even after their death. The Starks' son, Tony, called the first meeting of the Avengers as the [[Iron Man]] and donated the house as headquarters, so that it became [[Avengers Mansion]]. Jarvis grew accustomed to the guests and served the Avengers for many years on, acting as a father figure to some newcomers. 

Jarvis is the most famous comic book butler other than [[Alfred Pennyworth]], butler to [[Batman]]. Jarvis's name may actually be a nod to Alfred: Alfred originally introduced himself in ''Batman'' #16 (May&ndash;June [[1943]]), two decades before Edwin Jarvis's [[first appearance]], as the "son of Jarvis". 

{{spoiler}}
In current Marvel Comics continuity (as of 2005), Javis is romantically involved with [[May Parker]]. 

==Ultimate Marvel==
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]], Jarvis was [[homosexual|gay]] and was much more sarcastic and acerbic towards his employer, [[Ultimate Iron Man|Tony Stark]]. He was recently shot and killed by the [[Black Widow#Ultimate Marvel Black Widow|Black Widow]] when she revealed herself to Stark as the traitor within the [[Ultimates]] team.
