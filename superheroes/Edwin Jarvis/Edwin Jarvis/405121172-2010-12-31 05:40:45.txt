'''Edwin Jarvis''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[supporting character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] titles, ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'', ''[[Iron Man]]'', and ''[[Spider-Man]]''. '''JARVIS''' is an [[A.I.]] for Iron Man's armor.

==Publication history==
Jarvis first appeared in ''Tales of Suspense'' #59 (November 1964), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Don Heck]].

Edwin Jarvis received an entry in the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update '89]]'' #4, and ''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Avengers'' (2004).

==Fictional character biography==

  {{Quote|Born of modest origins, he had quickly risen through the ranks of household employ, his loyalty and dedication finally placing him at the apex of domestic service as valiant valet to the Earth's Mightiest Heroes!|Prologue from an ''Avengers'' backup story featuring Jarvis<ref>Michelinie, David; Stern, Roger; PÃ©rez, George; and Day, Gene. "Bully", ''The Avengers'' #201 (November 1980).</ref>}}

Jarvis served in the [[UK|British]] [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] during [[World War II]] and was its champion boxer three years running.  He later moved to America where he became manservant to the Starks ([[Howard Stark|Howard]] and [[Maria Stark|Maria]]) and watched over their mansion even after their deaths.

The Starks' son ([[Tony Stark|Tony]]) called the first meeting of the Avengers as [[Iron Man]] and donated the house as headquarters, so that it became [[Avengers Mansion]]. Jarvis grew accustomed to the guests and served the Avengers for many years thereafter, acting as a father figure to some of the newcomers. He was the only one to stay with the Avengers for their entire existence, a distinction not even [[Captain America]] can claim. As a result, Cap has stated that Jarvis should be regarded as just as much of an Avenger as he is.

Jarvis spent some time as the primary babysitter for [[Franklin Richards]], the super-powered son of [[Mister Fantastic]] and the [[Invisible Woman]] when they were residing at the mansion. He also served as the sponsor to future Avengers member [[Silverclaw]] while she was growing up, and she has come to regard him as an uncle.

Being manservant to the Avengers meant that Jarvis has had to deal with their enemies himself on several occasions. In ''Avengers'' #59 and #60 (December 1969, January 1970) he was assaulted by intruders into the mansion and bound and gagged. He has also been involved personally in many adventures, including leading the evacuation of a stalled subway train during a [[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|city-wide disaster]] and battling a demonically possessed car.  During this time he dated a woman he rescued named Glory.  Jarvis defended the floating [[Hydro-Base|Hydrobase]] against a horde of robots built by [[Doctor Doom]] during the [[Acts of Vengeance]] crisis. He was present when one of the many incarnations of the [[Masters of Evil]] attacked the mansion. He was brutally beaten by Mr Hyde while Captain America was forced to watch. It took some time for Jarvis to recover from his injuries. He even wore an [[eyepatch]] for some time. Jarvis personally confronted [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], risking great danger, after realizing the villain had tricked his way inside the mansion in ''Avengers'' #400.

In his duties as the Avengers' manservant, he was entrusted with items of great power, including the [[Casket of Ancient Winters]].

When the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] were formed, Jarvis was called back after taking a holiday "for the first time in years", having been informed that his 'special' services were once again needed. Jarvis often confronts [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] over the man's poor kitchen etiquette, a battle only new member [[Spider-Man]]'s [[Aunt May]] was able to win. Jarvis struck up a relationship with May, who had moved into [[Stark Tower]] with Peter and Mary Jane after her house burnt down. When Spider-Man switched sides during the Civil War, however, Aunt May and Mary Jane fled Stark Tower to live in hiding. 

In a recent New Avengers "Civil War" story, Jarvis was shot by an employee of Tony Stark, who was opposed to Stark using technology he invented to enforce the [[Superhuman Registration Act]].  However, it appears Jarvis recovers from this wound, as in ''[[Civil War: The Initiative]]'', he is shown to be working again. He also humorously mentions that if Tony Stark allowed "that [[Tigra]] %^#$" in the new incarnation of the Avengers, Tony would need to find someone else to do the laundry. Tigra had worked for Tony Stark's side throughout the entirety of the ''Civil War'' incident.

In ''Spider-Man: [[One More Day (comics)|One More Day]]'', Jarvis is given a slightly over $2,000,000 check by Stark to pay for Aunt May's hospital bills after an angry confrontation with Peter. She was dying after being shot by a [[sniper]] (hired by [[The Kingpin]]) in revenge once Stark convinced Spider-Man to unmask. Jarvis visibly breaks down upon seeing her in the hospital bed, confessing his deep love to the Parkers.<ref>''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #544</ref>

As a consequence of the "One More Day" storyline, the Spider-Man comics have undergone a major continuity overhaul, of which many consequences have yet to be revealed.  With Peter Parker's identity secret again, there may be no way to connect May and Jarvis; 
an issue of ''New Avengers'' is advertised as addressing Spider-Man's "new" history with the team, which would include this time period.

In ''[[Secret Invasion]]'', it is revealed that Jarvis has been replaced by a [[Skrull]] agent (though the exact time is unclear, after the events of Secret Invasion, it was revealed in a summary of Secret Invasion, when describing the Jarvis Skrull, that it was apparently before Jarvis started his relationship with May).<ref>''[[Secret Invasion]]'' #1</ref> Using a computer virus, he disables a number of Stark Enterprises facilities, as well as Stark's [[Iron Man's armor|armor]]. This agent also obtained access to Tony Stark's records on [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Robert Reynolds (The Sentry)]] in order to discover his weaknesses, as the Skrulls were unable to duplicate his powers because its limits were unknown even to Stark.<ref>''[[The Mighty Avengers|Mighty Avengers]]'' #14</ref> He later approaches [[Maria Hill]] on the destroyed S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier in the middle of the ocean and tells her to surrender along with her crew. She uses a Life Model Decoy in that spot as the real one escaped and detonated the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier. During the fight between [[Veranke]] and Criti Noll's forces against the heroes and villains, The Skrull-Jarvis (who somehow survived the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier explosion) watches from Avengers Tower as the energy washes over hero, villain and Skrull alike. While holding [[Jessica Jones]] and [[Luke Cage]]'s child, he comments that it doesn't matter if the Skrulls win or lose, so long as "God's" will is done.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #7</ref>

After the final battle, the real Jarvis is discovered alive, prompting Jessica Jones to discover that her baby had been taken by the Skrull impostor.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #8</ref> Jarvis is later shown in a [[support group]] meeting with the others that had been replaced by Skrulls.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #20</ref> The Skrull Jarvis was eventually found in a hideout and was shot by [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] after returning the baby to Luke Cage.<ref>''New Avengers'' #49</ref>

During the "Earth's Mightiest" arc, the real Jarvis, having refused to serve under [[Norman Osborn]]'s [[Dark Avengers|new group of Avengers]] is sought out by Hercules and [[Amadeus Cho]] to be a part of the new [[The Mighty Avengers|Mighty Avengers]] team, Amadeus having determined that Jarvis is the one constant of the Avengers.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #21</ref>

==Personal life==
* Jarvis once started a pen pal relationship with a young girl who would grow up to be the superhero [[Silverclaw]]. Her trip to America to meet Jarvis would be foiled when she was forced into helping terrorists in a massive attack. Silverclaw's efforts helped the people in danger at the airport, including Jarvis himself.

==Other versions==
===House of M===
In the ''[[House of M]]: Iron Man'' series, the A.I. system in Tony Stark's suit is referred to as "Jarvis".

===Marvel Zombies===
In the [[Marvel Zombies]] mini-series in which all of the world's superheroes (and many of the villains) are transformed by a sentient alien virus into flesh-eating zombies, it is revealed that Jarvis was torn apart and shared-out amongst the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. As [[Alternate versions of Captain America#Marvel Zombies|Colonel America]] speculated, he appears to have been so mortified by the spectacle of his beloved Avengers as hungry corpses that he barely put up a fight.

===MC2===
Jarvis, now with visibly gray hair, continues to serve as the butler to the [[A-Next|Avengers Next]] in the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] universe.  During the initial 12 issue run of A Next, Jarvis is shown as a mentor to the young heroes.  Along with Scott Lang Jarvis attempts to aide and assist the Avengers anyway he can.  He's later joined by Tony Stark and a blind Hawkeye.

===Ultimate Jarvis===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]], Jarvis is different from his original appearance and is much more sarcastic and acerbic towards his employer, [[Ultimate Iron Man|Tony Stark]]. Here Jarvis is the personal butler of Tony Stark, and not of his Avengers-like team, the Ultimates. While Tony dated and eventually became engaged to his teammate, the Ultimate version of [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)#Ultimate Black Widow|Natasha Romanova, aka Black Widow]], Jarvis was shown to be continuously at odds with her and both were quick to hurl insults at the other. Jarvis was later shot in the head by Natasha when she revealed herself to Stark as the traitor within the [[Ultimates]] team. His death (along with Black Widow's betrayal) are contributing factors to Tony Stark's descent into full-blown [[alcoholism]]. During his debut appearance, Tony's brother [[Gregory Stark]] is shown in the company of his young female assistant, who is identified only as '''Mrs. Jarvis'''. What, if any connection she shares with the previous Jarvis is as of yet unknown.

===Film===
* Jarvis appears as an [[Artificial intelligence|A.I.]] in the [[2008 in film|2008]] film ''[[Iron Man (film)|Iron Man]]'', running the internal systems of Tony Stark's home and being uploaded into his armor to help him. He can converse with Stark with considerable sophistication and is sarcastic concerning his creator's recklessness. He is voiced by [[Paul Bettany]], who admits he had little idea of what the role was even as he recorded it, simply doing it as a favor for his friend, director [[Jon Favreau]].<ref>Huver, Scott. [http://www.superherohype.com/news/topnews.php?id=7224 "Paul Bettany on Voicing Iron Man's Jarvis"], SuperHeroHype.com (May 16, 2008). Accessed Dec. 4, 2008.</ref> Bettany returned to voice Jarvis in ''[[Iron Man 2]]''.<ref>[http://www.getthebigpicture.net/blog/2009/1/12/paul-bettany-will-take-orders-from-iron-man-again.html Paul Bettany Will Take Orders from Iron Man Again]</ref> The computer program JARVIS is later introduced in the comic books as the program that helps operate [[Pepper Potts]]'s Rescue suit.<ref>''[[Invincible Iron Man]]'' #29</ref>

===Video games===
* The AI Jarvis appears in the ''[[Iron Man (video game)|Iron Man]]'' video game voiced by [[Gillon Stephenson]]. He serves as a source of information for the player informing them of any incoming soldiers or machines that they should be aware of.

* The AI Jarvis appears in the ''[[Iron Man 2 (video game)|Iron Man 2]]'' video game voiced by [[Kid Beyond|Andrew Chaikin]]. [[Kearson DeWitt]] and A.I.M. raid the Stark Archives in order to steal a copy of J.A.R.V.I.S.' program in a plot to create [[Ultimo (Marvel Comics)|Ultimo]].

==Acronym==
* In [[Matt Fraction]]'s ''[[Invincible Iron Man]]'' series, and later in [[Peter David]]'s novelization of the [[Iron Man (film)|film]], JARVIS is revealed as an acronym for "Just A Rather Very Intelligent System".<ref>David, Peter. ''Iron Man''. Del Ray (2008).</ref>

JARVIS could also stand for Judicial Algorithmic Responsive Virtual Intercom Supercomputer.  This is not an official definition but it makes sense based on the assistance JARVIS defines the computer as '''J'''udicial (studies any condition Tony gives it and determines how to fix the problem), '''A'''lgorithmic '''R'''esponsive (i.e. JARVIS's calculating and replying), '''V'''irtual based on the idea it's not a robot, just a computer program, '''I'''ntercom based on how it speaks in a room and a '''S'''upercomputer, saying it's a system is an understatement (can determine everything from what temperature it is outside to how much power the Iron Man holds to securing the entire house and understanding all sorts of materials that can be used when Stark - JARVIS in its own right is basically an engineer, security guard, assistant, meterologist, mathematician, etc.).
