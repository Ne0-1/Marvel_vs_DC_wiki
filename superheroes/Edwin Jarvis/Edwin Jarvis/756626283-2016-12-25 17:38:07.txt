'''Edwin Jarvis''' is a [[supporting character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] titles ''[[Iron Man]]'', ''[[The Avengers (comic)|The Avengers]]'' and ''[[Spider-Man]]''. He is the loyal household butler of the Stark family. Since the 1990's, the character has appeared heavily in media adaptations of ''Iron Man'' and ''Avengers'' stories, and is commonly remained as '''J.A.R.V.I.S.'''<!--The Just A Really Very... is from Peter David's novelization and isn't MCU canon; in fact, both in the comics and in the MCU, JARVIS is named for Edwin Jarvis-->, an [[artificial intelligence]] that assists the superhero [[Iron Man]].

In the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], J.A.R.V.I.S. is voiced by [[Paul Bettany]] in the live-action ''Iron Man'' films while Edwin Jarvis is portrayed by [[James D'Arcy]] in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television series ''[[Agent Carter (TV series)|Agent Carter]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/agent-carter-jarvis-details-howard-stark-butler|title=Agent Carter to Feature Edwin Jarvis as Howard Stark's Butler|publisher=Collider.com}}</ref>

In 2012, Edwin Jarvis was ranked 25th in [[IGN]]'s list of "The Top 50 Avengers".<ref>{{cite web |last= |first= |date=April 30, 2012 |title=The Top 50 Avengers |url=http://www.ign.com/top/avengers/25 |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=July 28, 2015}}</ref>

==Publication history==
Jarvis first appeared in ''Tales of Suspense'' #59 (November 1964), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Don Heck]]. Jarvis received an entry in the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Mightiest Heroes!]]'' from an ''Avengers'' backup story featuring Jarvis.<ref>Michelinie, David; Stern, Roger; Pérez, George; and Day, Gene. "Bully", ''The Avengers'' #201 (November 1980).</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Born of modest origins, Edwin Jarvis served in the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] during [[World War II]] and was its champion boxer three years running. He later moved to the United States where he became manservant to [[Howard Stark]] and [[Maria Stark]] and watched over the Starks' mansion even after the two deaths.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia|last=DeFalco|first=Tom|year= 2006|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|isbn=978-0-7566-2358-6|page=150}}</ref>

When [[Iron Man]] (Tony Stark) called the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]' first meeting and donated the Stark house as the [[Avengers Mansion]] headquarters, Jarvis grew accustomed to the guests and served the Avengers for many years thereafter, acting as a father figure to some of the newcomers. Jarvis was there for the first guest, the time-lost [[Captain America]] (Steve Rogers), to be a member of the Avengers.<ref>{{cite book |title=Heroes of film, comics and American culture|last=Detora|first=Lisa|year= 2009|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-3827-3|page=113}}</ref> He was the only one to stay with the Avengers for their entire existence, a distinction not even Captain America can claim. As a result, Captain America has stated that Jarvis should be [[Wikt:Jeevesian|regarded]] just as much of an Avenger as he is.{{issue|date=April 2013}}

Jarvis spent some time as the primary babysitter for [[Franklin Richards]], the super-powered son of [[Mister Fantastic]] and the [[Invisible Woman]], when the two [[Fantastic Four]] members were residing at the mansion. He also served as the sponsor to [[Silverclaw]] while the latter was growing up, and the future Avengers member has come to regard him as an uncle.<ref name="Avengers' 1998">''Avengers'' vol. 3 #8 (September, 1998)</ref>

Being a manservant to the Avengers meant that Jarvis has had to deal with their enemies on several occasions. In ''Avengers'' #59 and #60 (December 1969, January 1970), he was assaulted by intruders in the mansion and bound and gagged. Jarvis has also been personally involved in many adventures, including leading the evacuation of a stalled subway train during a [[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|city-wide disaster]] and battling a demonically possessed car. Jarvis defended the floating [[Hydro-Base|Hydrobase]] against a horde of robots built by [[Doctor Doom]] during the [[Acts of Vengeance]] crisis. He was present when one of the many incarnations of the [[Masters of Evil]] attacked the mansion. He was brutally beaten by Mr. Hyde while Captain America was forced to watch.<ref>''Avengers 273-277'' (1986-87)</ref> It took some time for Jarvis to recover from his injuries. He even wore an [[eyepatch]] for some time. Jarvis personally confronted [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], risking great danger, after realizing the villain had tricked his way inside the mansion. He tendered his resignation during Iron Man's battle with alcoholism,<ref>''Iron Man'' #127 (October 1979)</ref> but returned not long afterwards.<ref>''Iron Man'' #128 (November 1979) "[[Demon in a Bottle]]"</ref>

In his duties as the Avengers' manservant, he was entrusted with items of great power, including the [[Casket of Ancient Winters]].{{issue|date=April 2013}}

When the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] were formed, Jarvis was called back after taking a holiday "for the first time in years", having been informed that his 'special' services were once again needed. Jarvis often confronts [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] over the man's poor kitchen etiquette, a battle only new member [[Spider-Man]]'s [[Aunt May]] was able to win. Jarvis seemingly struck up a relationship with May that had moved into [[Stark Tower]] with Peter Parker and [[Mary Jane Watson]] after her house burnt down. When Spider-Man switched sides during the Civil War, however, May and Mary Jane fled Stark Tower to live in hiding.{{issue|date=April 2013}} In a ''New Avengers'' ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' story, Jarvis was shot by an employee who was opposed to Tony Stark using technology invented to enforce the [[Superhuman Registration Act]]. However, it appears Jarvis recovers from this wound as he is shown to be working again in ''[[Civil War: The Initiative]]''. He also humorously mentions that if Stark allowed "that Tigra %^#$" in the new incarnation of the Avengers, Tony would need to find someone else to do the laundry; [[Tigra]] had worked for Stark's side throughout the entirety of the ''Civil War'' incident.{{Issue|date=June 2011}} In the 2008 storyline ''[[Spider-Man: One More Day|One More Day]]'', Jarvis is given over $2,000,000 by Stark to pay for May's hospital bills following an assassination attempt in the aftermath of Peter's own decision to publicly reveal Spider-Man's true identity. Jarvis visibly breaks down upon seeing May in the hospital bed, confessing his deep love to the Parkers.<ref>''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #544</ref> As a consequence of the "One More Day" storyline, however, Spider-Man's timeline has undergone a major continuity overhaul,<ref>[[J. Michael Straczynski]] and [[Joe Quesada]]. "One More Day", Part 4 of 4, ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #545 (January 2008), Marvel Comics</ref> including Jarvis's relationship with the Parkers.{{issue|date=April 2013}}

Later that year, the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline revealed that Edwin Jarvis has been replaced by a [[Skrull]] agent for some time.<ref>''[[Secret Invasion]]'' #1</ref> Using a computer virus, he disables a number of Stark Enterprises facilities, as well as Iron Man's [[Iron Man's armor|armor]]. This agent also obtained access to Tony Stark's records on the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] (Robert Reynolds) in order to discover weaknesses, as the Skrulls were unable to duplicate Sentry's powers because Sentry's limits were unknown even to Iron Man.<ref>''[[The Mighty Avengers|Mighty Avengers]]'' #14</ref> He later approaches [[Maria Hill]] on the destroyed S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier in the middle of the ocean and tells Maria to surrender along with the S.H.I.E.L.D. crew. Maria uses a Life Model Decoy in that spot as the real one escaped and detonated the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier. During the fight between [[Veranke]] and Criti Noll's forces against the heroes and villains, the Skrull-Jarvis (who somehow survived the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier explosion) watches from Avengers Tower as the energy washes over hero, villain and Skrull alike. While holding [[Jessica Jones]] and [[Luke Cage]]'s child, he comments that it doesn't matter if the Skrulls win or lose, so long as "God's" will is done.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #7</ref> After the final battle, the real Jarvis is discovered alive, prompting Jessica to discover that her baby had been taken by the Skrull impostor.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #8</ref> During the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline, Jarvis is later shown in a [[support group]] meeting with the others that had been replaced by Skrulls.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #20</ref> The Skrull impersonator is eventually found in a hideout and was shot by [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] after returning Luke's and Jessica's baby.<ref>''New Avengers'' #49</ref> Having refused to serve under [[Norman Osborn]]'s [[Dark Avengers|personal Avengers]], Jarvis is sought out by Hercules and [[Amadeus Cho]] to be a part of the new [[The Mighty Avengers|Mighty Avengers]] team, Amadeus having determined that Jarvis is the one constant of the Avengers.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #21</ref>

During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Jarvis manages to escape [[Stark Tower|Avengers Tower]] when it's under attack by the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] (in the form of Angrir: Breaker of Souls). [[Thunderbolt Ross|Red Hulk]] tries unsuccessfully to stop him but the Tower gets destroyed and he's knocked out of the city and into [[Vermont]].<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael (w). ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' Vol. 4 #14, Marvel Comics, July 2011</ref><ref>''Hulk'' vol. 2 #37 Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the ''[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]'' storyline, when key members of the Avengers and the [[X-Men]] underwent a moral inversion, Jarvis and the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] tried to stop the Avengers when the group planned to kill the [[Red Skull]], but were ignored and attacked, Jarvis being knocked aside while Hulk's anger triggered his own inverted transformation into 'Kluh'.<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #4</ref> However, Jarvis had anticipated a problem based on the Avengers' actions since the group's return from the island, and had already hidden Red Skull away until he could explain the situation to Steve Rogers and was then able to retrieve Red Skull and return the heroes and villains to normal.<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #9</ref>

During the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, [[Demolition Man (comics)|Demolition Man]] met with Jarvis and [[Rage (comics)|Rage]] at Avengers Mansion during the incursion between Earth-616 and Earth-1610.<ref>''Secret Wars Too'' #1</ref>

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'', Edwin Jarvis is welcomed to the new headquarters of the Avengers. When Jarvis wonders if his services are needed or not, Iron Man convinces him to help out the Avengers.<ref>''All-New, All-Different Avengers'' #4</ref> Jarvis is present with the Avengers when they meet Nadia Pym, Hank Pym's daughter through Maria Trovaya who now sports a modified Wasp suit. After Nadia helps to stabilize the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], Jarvis takes Nadia on a road trip to meet the latter's extended family.<ref>''All-New, All-Different Avengers'' #9</ref>

===Personal life===
Edwin Jarvis once started a pen pal relationship with a young girl who would grow up to be the superhero [[Silverclaw]]; it was later revealed that the orphanage, aware of Silverclaw's abilities and Jarvis's ties to the Avengers, chose to assign Jarvis as Silverclaw's sponsor in the hope that his ties to the Avengers could be useful. Silverclaw's trip to the United States to meet Jarvis would be foiled when the youth was forced into helping terrorists in a massive attack. Silverclaw's efforts helped the people in danger at the airport, including Jarvis himself.<ref name="Avengers' 1998"/> Since then, Silverclaw has referred to him as 'Tio (Uncle) Edwin', with Avengers such as the [[Janet van Dyne]] noting that Silverclaw's ties to Jarvis made the girl practically family.

While Jarvis was shown dating [[Aunt May|May Parker]] during Spider-Man's initial career in the [[New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]], this relationship has been negated by the revelation that the man that May had dated was a [[Skrull]] impostor.

Jarvis also had a [[List of Marvel Comics characters: J|beloved mother]].<ref>''Avengers Annual'' vol 3</ref>

===Powers and abilities===
Edwin Jarvis is skilled at self-defence and basic hand-to-hand combat. He was a former boxing champion of the Royal Air Force for three years and had received military combat training and personal tutelage in unarmed combat by Captain America. Although he is in good health and physical condition, past injuries inflicted by Mister Hyde may have hampered his fighting prowess.

==Other versions==

===J.A.R.V.I.S.===
{{expand section|date=February 2014}}
Following the release of the film ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'', '''J.A.R.V.I.S.''' ('''''J'''ust '''A''' '''R'''ather '''V'''ery '''I'''ntelligent '''S'''ystem'') was introduced in the comic books as the program that helps operate [[Pepper Potts]]'s Rescue suit.<ref>''The Invincible Iron Man'' #11</ref> When [[Iron Man]] has been incapacitated, J.A.R.V.I.S. encourages Pepper to assume the Rescue armor which Pepper does.<ref>''The Invincible Iron Man'' #515</ref> When Rescue is chasing Iron Man throughout the city, J.A.R.V.I.S. tells Rescue to break off the chase and tells Rescue to remove the boot from Iron Man, which shows Pepper that [[War Machine]] isn't dead. When Pepper discusses thoughts about Iron Man keeping everyone on a need-to-know basis with Carson Wyche, the two confront J.A.R.V.I.S. about this. J.A.R.V.I.S. warns the two against asking any more questions and prepares to defend himself.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' #523</ref> Having captured Pepper and Wyche, J.A.R.V.I.S. declares his diagnostics do not reveal that he is compromised. He is rather in love with Pepper and wants to protect Pepper. Just then, Iron Man breaks through the wall and takes J.A.R.V.I.S. and the Rescue suit out with a source-focused electromagnetic pulse.<ref>''The Invincible Iron Man'' #524</ref> Pepper shows J.A.R.V.I.S. how he has been sending data to an [[IP address]] in [[People's Republic of China|China]]. He seems flustered, confused, Pepper thanks him for what he has given, and powers up the coil, killing J.A.R.V.I.S. Iron Man clearly feels J.A.R.V.I.S's death on his own end.<ref>''The Invincible Iron Man'' Vol 1 #526</ref>

===House of M===
In the ''[[House of M]]: Iron Man'' series, the A.I. system in Tony Stark's suit is referred to as "Jarvis", predating the AI version seen in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].<ref>''House of M: Iron M'' #1-3 (September 2005)</ref>

===Marvel Zombies===
In the ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'' mini-series in which all of the world's superheroes (and many of the villains) are transformed by a sentient alien virus into flesh-eating zombies, it is revealed that Edwin Jarvis was torn apart and shared-out amongst the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>"Marvel Zombies: Dead Days" One-Shot (July 2007)</ref> As [[Colonel America]] speculated, he appears to have been so mortified by the spectacle of his beloved Avengers as hungry corpses that he barely put up a fight.{{issue|date=April 2013}}

===Marvel Noir===
In the ''[[Marvel Noir]]'' universe, Edwin Jarvis is Tony Stark's engineer and personal assistant.<ref>''Iron Man Noir'' #1</ref>

===MC2===
Edwin Jarvis, now with visibly gray hair, continues to serve as the butler to the [[A-Next|Avengers Next]] in the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] universe. During the initial 12 issue run of ''A-Next'', Jarvis is shown as a mentor to the young heroes. Along with [[Scott Lang]], Jarvis attempts to aid and assist the Avengers anyway he can. He was later joined by Tony Stark and a blind [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]].{{issue|date=April 2013}}

===Ultimate Marvel===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Edwin Jarvis is different from his original version and is much more sarcastic and acerbic towards his employer [[Ultimate Iron Man (comics)|Iron Man]] (Tony Stark).<ref>The Ultimates #2</ref> Jarvis is only Tony's personal butler. While Tony dated and became engaged to [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Natasha Romanova]], Jarvis was shown to be continuously at odds with Natasha and both were quick to hurl insults at one another. Jarvis was later shot in the head by Natasha, a traitor within the [[Ultimates]] team. His death is one of the contributing factors to Stark's descent into full-blown [[alcoholism]].<ref>''The Ultimates 2'' #13</ref>

Since ''[[Ultimate Comics: Ultimates]]'', the new personal servant (whose real name is '''William''') tolerates being called Jarvis by Tony Stark.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Ultimates'' #1</ref>

* J.A.R.V.I.S. is first introduced in the films that take place in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], presented as a sophisticated [[Artificial intelligence|A.I.]] voiced by [[Paul Bettany]]. Modeled after [[H.O.M.E.R.]] from the comics, this was done to avoid similarities to [[Alfred Pennyworth]] and [[Batman]]. Paul Bettany admits he had little idea of what the role was, even as he recorded it, simply doing it as a favor for [[Jon Favreau]].<ref>Huver, Scott.

J.A.R.V.I.S. functions as an interface that functions as Tony Stark's assistant: Running all the internal systems of Stark's buildings and the Iron Man suits. J.A.R.V.I.S. can converse with Stark with considerable sophistication and is often sarcastic concerning his creator's recklessness and arrogance. Ironically, J.A.R.V.I.S. tends to be the only character with whom Stark can converse at any length; J.A.R.V.I.S., as a machine, has no difficulty absorbing Stark's often abusive treatment and is capable of responding in kind. At points in the films, J.A.R.V.I.S. seems to be legitimately concerned for his creator's well-being; warning Tony against taking actions that fall outside of the various armors' safety parameters. In ''The Avengers'', J.A.R.V.I.S. goes so far as to suggest that Iron Man contact [[Pepper Potts]] when the act of carrying a nuclear warhead into an inter-dimensional wormhole seems likely to cause death. In [[Peter David]]'s novelization of ''Iron Man'', J.A.R.V.I.S. is said to be an acronym for "'''J'''ust '''A''' '''R'''ather '''V'''ery '''I'''ntelligent '''S'''ystem".<ref>David, Peter.
