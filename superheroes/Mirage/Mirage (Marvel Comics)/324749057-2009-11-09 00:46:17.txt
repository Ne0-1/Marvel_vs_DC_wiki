'''Mirage''' is a fictional Marvel Comics villain. He first appeared in ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #156.

==First Mirage==
===Fictional character biography===
'''Desmond Charne''' was a former [[holography]] technician who wanted to be a supervillain. To that end, he used holograph technology which could make him invisible or create 3-D illusions. He also became the leader of his own criminal gang at some point.<ref>''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition'' Vol.2 #18</ref>

He made his criminal debut at [[Betty Brant]] and [[Ned Leeds]]' wedding, intending to rob them and their guests, but Spider-Man interfered. After a lengthy battle, Spider-Man defeated Mirage by dropping a chandelier on him.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #156</ref>

Mirage then planned to kidnap the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] from a hospital, to sell him to the highest bidder. [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] prevented Mirage's plans, and defeated him.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #96</ref>

Mirage attended the "Bar With No Name," in Medinah County, Ohio, and was massacred along with all the other villains present at the incident by the [[Scourge of the Underworld]], sustaining multiple gunshot wounds.<ref>''Captain America'' #319</ref> He was reported to have survived, as part of a ploy to lure the Scourge into a trap.  Dressed as Mirage, [[Captain America]] captured Scourge, who was then shot to death by another mysterious assailant.<ref>''Captain America'' #320</ref>

[[Arnim Zola]] later created a "proto-husk" replica of him only for it to be killed by [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]].<ref>''Deadpool'' vol. 3 #0</ref>

Mirage was later among the seventeen criminals, all murdered by the Scourge, to be resurrected by [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] using the power of [[Dormammu]] as part of a squad assembled to eliminate the [[Punisher]].<ref>''Punisher'' Vol. 7 #5</ref> Mirage's powers of illusion have been augmented.<ref>http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/preview2.php?image=previews/marvelcomics/punisher/villains/PunisherVillains-11.jpg</ref> [[Lascivious (comics)|Lascivious]] demonstrates her new emotion-based powers on him, making him lick her boots.<ref>''Punisher'' Vol. 7 #7</ref> Mirage disguises himself and a number of the criminals as the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] out to kill the Punisher. The Punisher uncovers the ruse when he knocks out Mirage (disguised as [[Captain America]]) and captures him. He interrogates Mirage about the villains' plans, and leaves him with a grenade in his mouth. Mirage escapes, and Letha removes the grenade; Letha orders [[Bird-Man]] to take him to safety.<ref>''Punisher'' Vol. 7 #8</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Desmond Charne was an electronics and laser technology genius, and held a Master's degree in physics. He designed a costume of synthetic stretch fabric lined with micro-circuitry and miniature devices with which Mirage could project three-dimensional laser-induced images called holograms. These tiny holographic projectors, located in the costume's cowl, enabled him to disguise himself as others, or to project multiple images, or to project three-dimensional images of himself several yards from his actual location while rendering himself "invisible" by bending light rays appropriately.  He also often carried a handgun with a silencer, and a tranquilizer gun.

==Second Mirage==
===Civil War===
A new character named Mirage has appeared as a [[Registration acts (comics)#2006 Superhuman Registration Act|Superhuman Registration Act]] violator. This Mirage is a female, unlike the Mirage killed by the Scourge. When [[Mind-Wave#Caged Angels|Mindwave]] was imprisoned by the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], he began a telepathic conversation with fellow prisoners Caprice, [[Blue Streak (comics)#Caged Angels|Bluestreak]], and Mirage. Mirage informed Mindwave that [[Robbie Baldwin|Penance]] had a violent dissociative episode and that most of the Thunderbolts were under stress. She also noted that [[Doc Samson]], who was present in Thunderbolts Mountain, had some fascinating thoughts.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #117</ref>

Mirage was ordered not to focus on Samson, but she ignored her fellow prisoners to pry into his mind anyway, and this time he noticed her psychic probing. He used his pent-up rage to send some psychic feedback to her that stunned her painfully and broke the connection.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #119</ref> Bulleseye killed Mirage and her allies in their cells by throwing scalpels into their heads.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #121</ref>

It is unknown at this time what connection, if any, the new [[Hellrazor#Caged Angels|Hellrazor]] has to these other prisoners of the Thunderbolts.
