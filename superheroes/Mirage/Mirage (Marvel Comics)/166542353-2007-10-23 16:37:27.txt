'''Mirage''' is the name of a fictional Marvel Comics villain. He first appeared in ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #156.

== Ficitonal Character Biography ==

'''Desmond Charne''' was a former holography technician who wanted to be a supervillain. To that end, he used holograph technology which could make him invisible or create 3-D illusions. 

He made his criminal debut at [[Betty Brant]] and [[Ned Leeds]]' wedding, intent to rob them, but Spider-Man interfered. After a lengthy battle, Spider-Man defeated Mirage by dropping a chandelier on him.  

Mirage has also fought [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], who also defeated him.

Mirage attended the "Bar With No Name," and was massacred along with all the other villains present at the incident by the [[Scourge of the Underworld]].  He was reported to have survived, as part of a ploy to lure the Scourge into a trap.  Dressed as Mirage, [[Captain America]] captured Scourge, who was then shot to death by another mysterious assailant, who was likely another Scourge.

==Equipment==
Mirage's suit uses holography, allowing him to produce several effects involving illusions.  He could disguise himself as others, use invisibility, and project multiple images.  He also often carried a handgun.
