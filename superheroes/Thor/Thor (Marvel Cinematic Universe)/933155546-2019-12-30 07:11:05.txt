'''Thor Odinson''' is a [[character (arts)|fictional character]] portrayed by [[Chris Hemsworth]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) [[film franchise]], based on the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|character of the same name]]. In the films, Thor is known as the "God of Thunder", and is one of the most powerful of the [[Asgardians (comics)|Asgardians]], an alien civilization with long ties to Earth, who are therefore considered by some on Earth to be gods.

Thor's character has borrowed a number of characteristics and storylines from across the more than fifty-year history of the character in Marvel Comics. Unlike his comic book version, however, MCU Thor has no superhero "alter ego".<ref name="Bath">{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/things-wrong-thor-everyone-chooses-ignore/|title=20 Things Wrong With Thor Everyone Chooses To Ignore|first=Dave|last=Bath|publisher=[[Screen Rant]]|date=October 28, 2018}}</ref> The Asgardians have advanced science that seems like magic to the people of Earth, as shown by Thor's hammer, [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjölnir]], which can channel Thor's ability to wield [[lightning]]. After Mjölnir is destroyed in the events of ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'', however, Thor himself helps forge Stormbreaker, an axe channeling the Bifrost, allowing him to effectively travel across the universe at will. This is another point of difference between the films and the comic books, where Stormbreaker was forged under the command of Thor's father, Odin.

{{As of|2019}}, the character is a central figure of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, having appeared in eight films of the series (including a brief cameo in ''[[Doctor Strange (2016 film)|Doctor Strange]]''). Although the first two ''Thor'' films have been among the less well-liked films in the MCU canon, ''Thor: Ragnarok'', with its substantial reinvention of the character, has been held up as one of the best Marvel films. Following its release, a reviewer from ''[[The Mary Sue]]'' has argued that Thor "has the best character arc of nearly every other MCU character, including costars [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] and [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]]".<ref name="Gardner-2018">{{cite web|url=https://www.themarysue.com/thor-character-growth-part-one/|title=The Case for Thor Being Marvel’s Strongest Character, Part One: Thor|publisher=[[The Mary Sue]]|first=Kate|last=Gardner|date=July 13, 2018}}</ref>

==Concept, creation, and characterization==
Thor debuted as a Marvel Comics [[superhero]] in the [[science fiction]]/[[fantasy]] [[anthology]] title ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #83 ([[cover-date]] August 1962), created by editor-plotter [[Stan Lee]], scripter [[Larry Lieber]], and penciller-plotter [[Jack Kirby]].<ref>{{cite book|last = DeFalco|first = Tom|authorlink = Tom DeFalco|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Marvel Chronicle: A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2008|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 88|isbn =978-0756641238}}</ref> Kirby said, "I created Thor at Marvel because I was forever enamored of legends, which is why I knew about Balder, Heimdall, and Odin.

In the mid-2000s, [[Kevin Feige]] realized that Marvel still owned the rights to the core members of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], which included Thor. Feige, a self-professed "fanboy", envisioned creating a shared universe just as creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby had done with their comic books in the early 1960s.<ref name="BostonApril2012">{{cite web|date=April 25, 2012 |last=Russo |first=Tom |title=SUPER GROUP |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2012/04/29/the_avengers_collects_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbustersuper_groupthe_avengers_assembles_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbuster/ |publisher=[[Boston.com]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6LK5iBg53?url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2012/04/29/the_avengers_collects_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbustersuper_groupthe_avengers_assembles_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbuster/?page=1 |archivedate=November 22, 2013 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

[[Mark Protosevich]], a fan of the ''Thor'' comic book, agreed to write the script in April 2006, and the project moved to [[Paramount Pictures]], after it acquired the rights from Sony.<ref name="Thor budget" /> In December 2007, Protosevich described his plans for it "to be like a [[superhero]] [[origin story]], but not one about a human gaining super powers, but of a god realizing his true potential. It's the story of an [[Old Testament]] god who becomes a [[New Testament]] god".<ref name="Mark P" /> Marvel Studios signed [[Matthew Vaughn]] to direct the film.<ref name="Fleming4" /> Vaughn then rewrote Protosevich's script in order to reduce the budget.<ref name="rewrite" /> Vaughn was later released, and in September 2008, [[Kenneth Branagh]] entered into negotiations to direct,<ref name="Fleming5" /> and by December 2008, Branagh confirmed that he had been hired. He described it as "a human story right in the center of a big epic scenario."<ref name="Branagh" /> In October 2008, [[Daniel Craig]] was offered the role, but ultimately turned it down, citing his commitments to the [[James Bond in film|''James Bond'' franchise]].<ref name="Craig" />

In May 2009, Chris Hemsworth was in negotiations to portray the title role after a back-and-forth process in which the 25-year-old actor was refused early on, then given a second chance to read for the part. Hemsworth's brother, [[Liam Hemsworth|Liam]] also auditioned for the role, but was passed on by Marvel Studios head [[Kevin Feige]].<ref name="Hemsworth is Thor"/> Feige mentioned that the film would take place on both modern day Earth and Asgard but Thor's human host, Dr. Donald Blake, would not be included.<ref name="feigehemsworth" /> Hemsworth stated that he gained 20&nbsp;pounds for the role by eating non-stop and revealed that "It wasn't until ''Thor'' that I started lifting weights, it was all pretty new to me."<ref name="Shira">{{cite web |last=Shira |first=Dahvi |date=April 18, 2011 |title=Chris Hemsworth Gained 20&nbsp;Lbs. of Muscle for Thor |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20482931,00.html |work=[[People (magazine)|People]] |accessdate=May 11, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zva40nYC?url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20482931,00.html |archivedate=July 4, 2011 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref>

===Characterization===
Regarding his take on the character, Hemsworth said, "We just kept trying to humanize it all, and keep it very real.

We talked about boxers, you know, [[Mike Tyson]], very low to the ground and big open chest and big shoulder swings and very sort of brutal but graceful at the same time, and then as we shot stuff things became easier."<ref name="Warmoth">{{cite news|first=Brian |last=Warmoth |url=http://splashpage.mtv.com/2010/08/23/chris-hemsworth-mike-tyson-thor/ |title=Chris Hemsworth Reveals Mike Tyson's Contribution To 'Thor' |publisher=[[MTV News]] |date=August 23, 2010 |accessdate=August 24, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zva4nvZT?url=http://splashpage.mtv.com/2010/08/23/chris-hemsworth-mike-tyson-thor/ |archivedate=July 4, 2011 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref> [[Dakota Goyo]] portrays a young Thor in the first film.

For ''The Avengers'', Hemsworth said that he was able to maintain the strength he built up for ''Thor'' by increasing his food intake, consisting of chicken breasts, fish, steak, and eggs every day. When asked exactly how much, Hemsworth said, "My body weight in protein pretty much!"<ref name="EOnline">{{cite news| title=Avengers Flick Update: Where's the Script?|last1=Malkin|first1=Marc|last2=Malec|first2=Brett |url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/marc_malkin/b216448_avengers_flick_update_wheres_script.html |publisher=[[E!]] |date=December 17, 2010 |accessdate=January 5, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zx6nTej1?url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/marc_malkin/b216448_avengers_flick_update_wheres_script.html |archivedate=July 5, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> He remarked that Thor's motivation "is much more of a personal one, in the sense that it's his brother that is stirring things up.

He's constantly having to battle the greater good and what he should do vs. it's his little brother there. . .

According to Hemsworth, in ''Thor: The Dark World'', "for Thor and Jane, there are some unanswered questions now, since obviously he didn't stop in and catch up with her in ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''.

Thor is noted to have a number of character flaws, which occasionally drive events in the MCU. He is initially impulsive, invading Jotunheim, the home of the frost giants, in the first film. This leads directly to Odin banishing him to Earth, and indirectly to Loki's attempt as overthrowing Asgard after Loki learns that he was born a frost giant and adopted by Odin. It is noted, however, that from this experience, Thor "emerges a more humble warrior".<ref name="Gardner-2018"/> The events of ''Thor'' also lead to Loki encountering Thanos, in whose service Loki invades Earth in ''The Avengers''. Although Thor's arrogance has been tempered since his first film, he still shows flashes of impulsiveness such as when he attacks Steve Rogers at their first meeting in ''The Avengers''.<ref name="Bath"/>

Analysis of the character from a feminist perspective has noted that Thor "might be a hotheaded braggart, but he never demeans women", a sharp contrast with the womanizing [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]].<ref name="Gardner-2018"/>

===Appearance and special effects===
Thor's appearance has changed from each film to the next. For the first film, Visual Development Supervisor Charlie Wen focused on mixing elements from the comic books with Norse mythology in creating Thor's costume, keeping the six disk-shaped adornments on his upper body, but "trying to maintain the Norse side of things" as much as possible.<ref name="Strom">{{cite web|url=https://marvel.com/news/story/15800/art_of_thor_charlie_wen|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405160102/https://marvel.com/news/story/15800/art_of_thor_charlie_wen|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 5, 2012|title=Art of Thor: Charlie Wen|first=Marc|last=Strom|publisher=Marvel.com|date=May 25, 2011}}</ref> The first design element that Wen attempted was Thor's hammer, Mjolnir, for which Wen created a number of possible alternatives, incorporating designs including "the traditional Thor hammer with the short handle as well as the Ultimates versions", from which the one Branagh chose "was the most traditional one".<ref name="Strom"/> For ''The Avengers'', Thor's costume was modified slightly to fit in better with other members of the team, and to make his movements and appearance in casual scenes more natural, with changes including enhancing the blue tones in the costume, and reducing the size of Thor's cape.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://marvel.com/news/story/19371/designing_the_avengers_thor|title=Designing The Avengers: Thor|first1=Christina|last1=Pham|first2=Marc|last2=Strom|publisher=Marvel.com|date=September 12, 2012}}</ref> Various efforts to depict Thor dressed in "street clothes" like people of Earth have been criticized as having him look like "an extra in Cameron Crowe's ''[[Singles (1992 film)|Singles]]''".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/04/a-serious-critique-of-the-mcus-off-duty-fashion.html|title=A Serious Critique of the MCU's Street Style|publisher=[[Vulture.com]]|first=Arye|last=Dworken|date=April 23, 2018}}</ref> The most significant change to Thor's appearance occurs in ''Thor: Ragnarok'', where Thor's long hair is cut short, his hammer is destroyed, and he is dressed as a [[gladiator]] in a battle-tattered costume for his combat with Hulk. The changes were suggested by Hemsworth, who had tired of repeatedly playing the character the same way in previous appearances, and agreed to by director Taika Waititi.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/11/thor-ragnarok-chris-hemsworth-mark-ruffalo-interview-best-thor-movie|title=Thor: Ragnarok Proves Marvel Is Not Afraid to Learn from Its Mistakes|first=Joanna|last=Robinson|publisher=Variety|date=November 3, 2007}}</ref> In ''Avengers: Endgame'', after the five-year time gap, Thor has become an overweight drunkard, and is depicted with long hair and an overgrown beard.

==Fictional character biography==
===Origins and first visit to Earth===
{{see|Thor (film)}}
As Thor prepares to ascend to the throne of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] after his father, [[Odin (comics)|Odin]], frost giants attempt to retrieve an artifact captured by Odin in a war centuries before. Against Odin's order, Thor travels to Jotunheim to confront Frost Giant leader Laufey, accompanied by his brother [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]], childhood friend [[Sif (comics)|Sif]] and the [[Warriors Three]]: [[Volstagg]], [[Fandral]], and [[Hogun]]. A battle ensues until Odin intervenes to save the Asgardians, destroying the fragile truce between the two races. For Thor's arrogance, Odin strips his son of his godly power and exiles him to Earth as a mortal, accompanied by Mjolnir which he can no longer wield.

Thor lands in [[New Mexico]], meeting astrophysicist [[Jane Foster (comics)|Dr. Jane Foster]]. Thor resigns himself to exile on Earth as he develops a romance with Jane. Loki seizes the throne, and the Warriors Three and Sif find Thor, but the [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]] attacks and defeats them, prompting Thor to offer himself instead. Struck by the Destroyer and near death, Thor's selflessness proves him worthy to wield Mjolnir. The hammer returns to him, restoring his powers and enabling him to defeat the Destroyer. Thor returns to Asgard and fights Loki before destroying the [[Bifröst Bridge]] to stop Loki's plans, stranding himself in Asgard. Odin prevents the brothers from falling into the abyss, but Loki appears to fall when Odin rejects his pleas for approval. Thor makes amends with Odin, admitting he is not ready to be king.

===Joining the Avengers===
{{see|The Avengers (2012 film)}}
Loki later ends up on Earth, causing havoc until he is captured by [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] (Iron Man) and [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]] (Captain America). Thor arrives and frees Loki, hoping to convince him to abandon his plan and return to Asgard. After a brief fight with Stark and Rogers, Thor agrees to take Loki to [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s flying aircraft carrier, the [[Helicarrier]]. Agents possessed by Loki attack the Helicarrier, disabling one of its engines in flight and causing [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]] to transform into the Hulk. Thor attempts to stop the Hulk's rampage, and both are ejected from the airship as Loki escapes. Loki opens a wormhole over [[New York City]] to allow a [[Chitauri]] army to invade, and Thor and the other Avengers rally in defense of the city. Once the Chitauri are defeated, Thor returns Loki and a source of power called the Tesseract to Asgard.

===Battle with the Dark Elves===
After bringing the Nine Realms to peace, Thor and his fellow warriors learn that the Convergence of the realms is imminent, with portals linking the worlds appearing at random. Heimdall alerts Thor that Jane Foster has left his near all-seeing vision, leading Thor to Earth.

Jane inadvertently releases an unearthly force, and Thor returns with her to Asgard. Odin recognizes this force as a weapon known as the Aether, warning that it will kill Jane, and that its return heralds a catastrophic prophecy. The [[Elves (Marvel Comics)#Dark Elves|Dark Elves]], led by [[Malekith the Accursed|Malekith]], attack Asgard, searching for Jane. Thor's mother [[Frigga (comics)|Frigga]] is killed protecting Jane, and Malekith is forced to flee. Against Odin's orders to stay in Asgard, Thor reluctantly frees Loki, who knows a secret portal to [[Svartalfheim]], home of the dark elves, in return for Thor's promise to take vengeance for their mother.

In Svartalfheim, Loki tricks Malekith into drawing the Aether out of Jane, but Thor's attempt to destroy the exposed substance fails. Malekith merges with the Aether and leaves in his ship as Loki is fatally wounded. Thor and Jane return to London through another portal. Thor ultimately defeats Malekith in a battle in [[Greenwich]], and returns to Asgard to decline Odin's offer to take the throne, and tells Odin of Loki's sacrifice. Jane and Thor reunite on Earth.

===Battle with Ultron===
After having found Loki's scepter on Earth at the [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] facility in Sokovia, Stark and Banner discover an [[Artificial intelligence in fiction#Sentient AI|artificial intelligence]] within the scepter's gem, and secretly decide to use it to complete Stark's "[[Ultron]]" global defense program. The unexpectedly sentient Ultron attacks Thor and the Avengers at [[Stark Tower|their headquarters]] before escaping with the scepter. The Avengers track down and attack Ultron but [[Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wanda Maximoff]] subdues them with a psychic attack. Thor departs to consult with Dr. Selvig on the meaning of the apocalyptic future he saw in his hallucination.

Stark secretly uploads J.A.R.V.I.S. into a synthetic body captured from Ultron. Thor returns to help activate the body, dubbed [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], explaining that the gem on its brow, one of the six [[Infinity Stones]], the most powerful objects in existence, was part of his vision. The Avengers return to Sokovia and defeat Ultron, and Thor returns to Asgard to learn more about the forces he suspects have manipulated recent events.

===Destruction of Asgard and battle with Thanos===
Imprisoned during his search for the [[Infinity Stones]], Thor fights [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]] in [[Muspelheim]]. Surtur claims he will destroy Asgard in a prophesied [[Ragnarök]], when his crown is placed into the Eternal Flame in Odin's vaults. Thor defeats Surtur and retrieves the crown, believing he has prevented Ragnarök. Returning to Asgard, he finds Loki still alive and posing as Odin. With the help of [[Doctor Strange|Stephen Strange]], they find a dying Odin in Norway, who explains that his passing will allow his firstborn child, Hela, to escape from a prison she was sealed in long ago. She appears, destroying Mjölnir, and forces the escaping Thor and Loki from the Bifröst out into space.

Thor crash-lands on the planet Sakaar, and is captured by the slave trader [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]], a former member of the ancient order of [[Valkyrior|Valkyries]] defeated by Hela. After fighting Hulk, the champion of the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]], Thor finds the Quinjet that brought Hulk to Sakaar. A recording of Natasha Romanoff helps Hulk transform back into Bruce Banner (after two years of lost control), and after convincing Valkyrie and Loki to help, they escape through a wormhole to Asgard – but not before Loki betrays his brother, and is then left behind on Sakaar.

In the midst of a battle with Hela's forces, Loki returns aboard the Grandmaster's vessel, helping Asgard's citizens to escape. Thor, facing Hela, loses an eye, and through a vision of Odin realizes only Ragnarök can stop her. He has Loki place Surtur's crown in the Eternal Flame, and the reborn Surtur destroys Asgard and Hela. Thor, crowned king, decides to take his people to Earth, but they are intercepted by a large spacecraft carrying Thanos.

Thor, Loki, and Hulk are unable to stop Thanos, who overpowers Hulk and kills Loki, claiming the Space Stone from the Tesseract, which Loki had stolen just before Asgard's destruction. Heimdall uses the Bifröst to send Hulk to Earth before he is killed and the ship obliterated. The [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] respond to the ship's distress call and recover Thor. [[Rocket Raccoon]] and [[Groot]] accompany Thor to [[Nidavellir]] to find a weapon capable of killing Thanos. They meet [[Eitri (comics)|Eitri]] at an abandoned Nidavellir, and the four create Stormbreaker, an axe that grants Thor the power of the Bifröst.

Near the climax of Thanos' invasion of Wakanda (waged to obtain the Stone from Vision), Thor, Rocket and Groot arrive on Earth via the Bifröst and rally with the defenders. Thanos retrieves the last Infinity Stone, however, and despite being grievously wounded by Thor, is able to activate the Infinity Gauntlet; by snapping his fingers, he causes half of the inhabitants of the universe to disintegrate. Thanos manages to teleport away before Thor can finish him off.

===Restoring the universe===

Several weeks later, Thor goes with a group of Avengers to confront Thanos on the garden planet to which he has retired. After discovering that Thanos has destroyed the Infinity Stones to prevent their use again, a vengeful Thor decapitates Thanos. Over the next five years, Thor becomes an [[overweight]] and [[obesity|obese]] [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] with [[Complex post-traumatic stress disorder|severe PTSD]] and [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] as he leads the remaining survivors of Asgard, who have created a colony in Norway. When the return of Scott Lang leads to the idea of using time travel to get the Infinity Stones to save the universe, Thor joins the mission during which he meets his mother in a time before her death, a meeting that reignites Thor's sense of purpose, and he also regains Mjolnir. With the Infinity Stones, the Avengers are able to restore those killed by Thanos. However, a time-traveling version of Thanos appears and a large scale battle ensues, during which Thor is pleased to see that Steve Rogers is also able to wield Mjolnir. Thanos is defeated when Stark sacrifices himself to use the Infinity Stones against the Mad Titan and his army. Thor attends to Stark's funeral. In the aftermath of Thanos' defeat, Thor abdicates as king of New Asgard and makes Valkyrie the new ruler. Thor then joins the Guardians of the Galaxy, where it is implied that there will be a leadership conflict between him and Peter Quill.

==Differences from the comic books==
A major divergence from the comic books is the absence of Thor's comic book alter ego, Donald Blake.<ref name="Bath"/><ref name="Bacon">{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/marvel-movies-not-adapt-comics/|title=The MCU Isn't Pretending To Adapt Marvel Comics Stories Any More|first=Thomas|last=Bacon|publisher=[[Screen Rant]]|date=August 28, 2018}}</ref> In the comics, as in the MCU, Odin stripped Thor of his powers and sent him to Earth as punishment for Thor's arrogance and intemperance. However, in the comics, Odin puts Thor into the body of Donald Blake, a crippled human doctor, for the course of a long-running storyline, encompassing years of adventures during which Thor's alter ego is occasionally able to cause Thor to re-emerge to fight villainy. In the MCU, with no element of an alter ego, this banishment is resolved within the first film, over the course of days.<ref name="Bath"/> The lack of an alter ego also impacts Thor's relationships. In the comics, Thor's love interest, Jane Foster, is an assistant to Donald Blake. In the films, she has no prior connection to the character, and meets him due to her work as a physicist studying the type of phenomena his appearances generate.<ref name="Bath"/>

Another significant difference from the comic books is the destruction in the MCU of Thor's hammer, Mjölnir, and the origin of its replacement, Stormbreaker. In the comics, Stormbreaker is created by the dwarf Eitri by Odin's decree, to be given to the character [[Beta Ray Bill]], after Bill defeats Thor in hand-to-hand combat in a fight to determine who should possess Mjölnir. In the MCU, Thor himself assists Eitri in creating Stormbreaker as a replacement for the destroyed Mjölnir, to use as a weapon with which to face Thanos,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/thors-stormbreaker-facts-hammer-left-out-infinity-war/|title=Thor's Stormbreaker: Facts About The Hammer They Don't Cover In Infinity War|website=[[Screen Rant]]|first=Rose|last=Moore|date=March 3, 2019}}</ref> though he does later retrieve Mjölnir for a brief period while travelling through time.

At the end of ''Avengers: Endgame'', Thor joins the Guardians of the Galaxy, also a different course from anything that occurs in the comic books.

==Reception==
While Hemsworth's portrayal of the character has received praise, Thor, as a character, was initially less well-received than other Avengers characters, and it has been stated that "before ''Ragnarok'', Thor was described by some as an ill-defined if likable meathead of a character, used primarily for punching and occasionally fish-out-of-water jokes made at his expense",<ref name="Moran">{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/thor-ragnarok-saved-franchise/|title=Ragnarok Truly Did Save The Thor Franchise|website=Screen Rant|first=Sarah|last=Moran|date=September 1, 2018}}</ref> and that films featuring the character were "the studio's least fun franchise".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/10/26/16537186/thor-ragnarok-review|title=Thor: Ragnarok finally makes Thor a hero worth rooting for|publisher=Vox.com|first=Alex|last=Abad-Santosalex|date=November 2, 2017}}</ref> In particular, ''The Dark World'' was criticized for adding "absolutely zero development or growth for its main character", resulting in "little enthusiasm for Thor from either audiences or Marvel".<ref name="Moran"/> ''Thor: Ragnarok'', however, was much better received, to the extent that it has widely been described as saving the ''Thor'' franchise.<ref name="Moran"/> In his review of ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', [[Joe Morgenstern]] of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' acknowledged "Chris Hemsworth’s Thor, endearing despite some ragged material and the actor’s seemingly limited dramatic range" while praising Hemsworth in the MCU Infinity Saga finale "as the graceful, exuberant comic actor he was destined to be, while Thor morphs, alarmingly and charmingly—yet still heroically—into a beer-bellied apparition who could pass for [[Jeff Lebowski]]."<ref name="MorgensternEndgame">{{cite journal|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/avengers-endgame-review-a-marvelous-wrap-11556124677|title=‘Avengers: Endgame’ Review: A Marvelous Wrap|last=Morgenstern|first=Joe|journal=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=April 25, 2019|accessdate=June 3, 2019|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/78rjAMsPj|archivedate=June 3, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>
