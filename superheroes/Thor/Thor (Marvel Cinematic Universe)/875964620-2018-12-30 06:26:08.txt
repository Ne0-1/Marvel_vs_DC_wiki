'''Thor Odinson''' is a [[character (arts)|character]] portrayed by [[Chris Hemsworth]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) [[film franchise]], based on the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|character of the same name]]. In the films, Thor is one of the most powerful of the Asgardians, an alien civilization with long ties to Earth, who are therefore considered by some on Earth (and by themselves) to be gods. Thor himself is titled the "God of Thunder". The Asgardians have advanced science that seems like magic to people of Earth, typified in Thor's case by his hammer, Mjolnir, with which he can summon [[lightning]] through most of the films. Thor in the MCU has borrowed a number of characteristics and story lines from across the fifty-plus year history of the character in Marvel Comics. However, unlike most other characters in the franchise, Thor has no superhero "alter ego", a characteristic that also differs from the original comic book version of Thor.<ref name="Bath">{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/things-wrong-thor-everyone-chooses-ignore/|title=20 Things Wrong With Thor Everyone Chooses To Ignore|first=Dave|last=Bath|publisher=''[[Screen Rant]]''|date=October 28, 2018}}</ref>

{{As of|2018}}, the character is one of the central figures of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, having appeared in seven films of the series (including a brief cameo in ''[[Doctor Strange (2016 film)|Doctor Strange]]''). Although the first two ''Thor'' films have been among the less well-liked films in the MCU canon, ''Thor: Ragnarok'', with its substantial reinvention of the character, has been held up as one of the best Marvel films. Following its release, a reviewer from ''[[The Mary Sue]]'' has argued that Thor "has the best character arc of nearly every other MCU character, including costars [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] and [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]]".<ref name="Gardner-2018">{{cite web|url=https://www.themarysue.com/thor-character-growth-part-one/|title=The Case for Thor Being Marvelâ€™s Strongest Character, Part One: Thor|publisher=''[[The Mary Sue]]''|first=Kate|last=Gardner|date=July 13, 2018}}</ref>

==Concept, creation, and characterization==
Thor debuted as a Marvel Comics [[superhero]] in the [[science fiction]]/[[fantasy]] [[anthology]] title ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #83 ([[cover-date]] August 1962), created by editor-plotter [[Stan Lee]], scripter [[Larry Lieber]], and penciller-plotter [[Jack Kirby]].<ref>{{cite book|last = DeFalco|first = Tom|authorlink = Tom DeFalco|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Marvel Chronicle: A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2008|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 88|isbn =978-0756641238}}</ref> Kirby said, "I created Thor at Marvel because I was forever enamored of legends, which is why I knew about Balder, Heimdall, and Odin.

In the mid-2000s, [[Kevin Feige]] realized that Marvel still owned the rights to the core members of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], which included Thor. Feige, a self-professed "fanboy", envisioned creating a shared universe just as creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby had done with their comic books in the early 1960s.<ref name="BostonApril2012">{{cite web|date=April 25, 2012 |last=Russo |first=Tom |title=SUPER GROUP |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2012/04/29/the_avengers_collects_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbustersuper_groupthe_avengers_assembles_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbuster/ |publisher=[[Boston.com]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6LK5iBg53?url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2012/04/29/the_avengers_collects_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbustersuper_groupthe_avengers_assembles_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbuster/?page=1 |archivedate=November 22, 2013 |deadurl=no  }}</ref>

[[Mark Protosevich]], a fan of the ''Thor'' comic book, agreed to write the script in April 2006, and the project moved to [[Paramount Pictures]], after it acquired the rights from Sony.<ref name="Thor budget" /> In December 2007, Protosevich described his plans for it "to be like a [[superhero]] [[origin story]], but not one about a human gaining super powers, but of a god realizing his true potential. It's the story of an [[Old Testament]] god who becomes a [[New Testament]] god".<ref name="Mark P" /> Marvel Studios signed [[Matthew Vaughn]] to direct the film.<ref name="Fleming4" /> Vaughn then rewrote Protosevich's script in order to reduce the budget.<ref name="rewrite" /> Vaughn was later released, and in September 2008, [[Kenneth Branagh]] entered into negotiations to direct,<ref name="Fleming5" /> and by December 2008, Branagh confirmed that he had been hired. He described it as "a human story right in the center of a big epic scenario."<ref name="Branagh" /> In October 2008, [[Daniel Craig]] was offered the role, but ultimately turned it down, citing his commitments to the [[James Bond in film|''James Bond'' franchise]].<ref name="Craig" />

In May 2009, Chris Hemsworth was in negotiations to portray the title role after a back-and-forth process in which the 25-year-old actor was refused early on, then given a second chance to read for the part. Hemsworth's brother, [[Liam Hemsworth|Liam]] also auditioned for the role, but was passed on by Marvel Studios head [[Kevin Feige]].<ref name="Hemsworth is Thor"/> Feige mentioned that the film would take place on both modern day Earth and Asgard but Thor's human host, Dr. Donald Blake, would not be included.<ref name="feigehemsworth" /> Hemsworth stated that he gained 20&nbsp;pounds for the role by eating non-stop and revealed that "It wasn't until ''Thor'' that I started lifting weights, it was all pretty new to me."<ref name="Shira">{{cite web |last=Shira |first=Dahvi |date=April 18, 2011 |title=Chris Hemsworth Gained 20&nbsp;Lbs. of Muscle for Thor |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20482931,00.html |work=[[People (magazine)|People]] |accessdate=May 11, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zva40nYC?url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20482931,00.html |archivedate=July 4, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref>

===Characterization===
Regarding his take on the character, Hemsworth said, "We just kept trying to humanize it all, and keep it very real. Look into all the research about the comic books that we could, but also bring it back to 'Who is this guy as a person, and what's his relationship with people in the individual scenes?{{Single double}}<ref name="Huver">{{cite web|url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/articles/101160-exclusive-chris-hemsworth-on-thor |title=Exclusive: Chris Hemsworth on Thor! |first=Scott |last=Huver |work=[[Superhero Hype!|SuperheroHype.com]] |date=May 14, 2010 |accessdate=May 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zxsJOvbb?url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/articles/101160-exclusive-chris-hemsworth-on-thor |archivedate=July 6, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref> About approaching Thor's fighting style, he remarked, "First, we looked at the comic books and the posturing, the way [Thor] moves and fights, and a lot of his power seems to be drawn up through the ground. We talked about boxers, you know, [[Mike Tyson]], very low to the ground and big open chest and big shoulder swings and very sort of brutal but graceful at the same time, and then as we shot stuff things became easier."<ref name="Warmoth">{{cite news|first=Brian |last=Warmoth |url=http://splashpage.mtv.com/2010/08/23/chris-hemsworth-mike-tyson-thor/ |title=Chris Hemsworth Reveals Mike Tyson's Contribution To 'Thor' |publisher=[[MTV News]] |date=August 23, 2010 |accessdate=August 24, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zva4nvZT?url=http://splashpage.mtv.com/2010/08/23/chris-hemsworth-mike-tyson-thor/ |archivedate=July 4, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref> [[Dakota Goyo]] portrays a young Thor in the first film.

For ''The Avengers'', Hemsworth said that he was able to maintain the strength he built up for ''Thor'' by increasing his food intake, consisting of chicken breasts, fish, steak, and eggs every day. When asked exactly how much, Hemsworth said, "My body weight in protein pretty much!"<ref name="EOnline">{{cite news| title=Avengers Flick Update: Where's the Script?|last1=Malkin|first1=Marc|last2=Malec|first2=Brett |url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/marc_malkin/b216448_avengers_flick_update_wheres_script.html |publisher=[[E!]] |date=December 17, 2010 |accessdate=January 5, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zx6nTej1?url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/marc_malkin/b216448_avengers_flick_update_wheres_script.html |archivedate=July 5, 2011 |deadurl=no}}</ref> He remarked that Thor's motivation "is much more of a personal one, in the sense that it's his brother that is stirring things up.

He's constantly having to battle the greater good and what he should do vs. it's his little brother there. . .

According to Hemsworth, in ''Thor: The Dark World'', "for Thor and Jane, there are some unanswered questions now, since obviously he didn't stop in and catch up with her in ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''.

Thor is noted to have a number of character flaws, which occasionally drive events in the MCU. He is impulsive, leading to his invasion of the frost giants of Niflheim in the first film, which then leads to his banishment to Earth for much of that film. Thor's attack on the frost giants leads to Loki's discovery that he was born a frost giant and adopted by Odin, and Thor's banishment to Earth in part leads to Loki's effort to overthrow Asgard, culminating with Loki's falling from the Bifrost. It is noted, however, that from this experience, Thor "emerges a more humble warrior".<ref name="Gardner-2018"/> The events of ''Thor'' also lead to Loki ending up in the service of Thanos, for whom Loki invades Earth, precipitating the events of ''The Avengers''. Although Thor's arrogance has been tempered in his first film, he still impulsively attacks Steve Rogers when they first meet in ''The Avengers''.<ref name="Bath"/> Thor's character in ''Infinity War'' has been criticized as a step backwards from his portrayal in his previous appearance in ''Ragnarok''. Thor learns in ''Ragnarok'' that his power does not comes from his hammer, only to spend the bulk of ''Infinity War'' pursuing the creation of a new, more powerful hammer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.themarysue.com/thors-arc-avengers-infinity-war/|title=Thorâ€™s Arc Is Still the Best and Worst Thing About Infinity War|publisher=''[[The Mary Sue]]''|first=Kaila|last=Hale-Stern|date=August 3, 2018}}</ref> Analysis of the character from a feminist perspective has noted that Thor "might be a hotheaded braggart, but he never demeans women", a sharp contrast with the womanizing [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]].<ref name="Gardner-2018"/>

===Appearance and special effects===
Thor's appearance has changed from each film to the next. For the first film, Visual Development Supervisor Charlie Wen focused on mixing elements from the comic books with Norse mythology in creating Thor's costume, keeping the six disk-shaped adornments on his upper body, but "trying to maintain the Norse side of things" as much as possible.<ref name="Strom">{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405160102/https://marvel.com/news/story/15800/art_of_thor_charlie_wen|title=Art of Thor: Charlie Wen|first=Marc|last=Strom|publisher=Marvel.com|date=May 25, 2011}}</ref> The first design element that Wen attempted was Thor's hammer, Mjolnir, for which Wen created a number of possible alternatives, incorporating designs including "the traditional Thor hammer with the short handle as well as the Ultimates versions", from which the one Branagh chose "was the most traditional one".<ref name="Strom"/> For ''The Avengers'', Thor's costume was modified slightly to fit in better with other members of the team, and to make his movements and appearance in casual scenes more natural, with changes including enhancing the blue tones in the costume, and reducing the size of Thor's cape.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://marvel.com/news/story/19371/designing_the_avengers_thor|title=Designing The Avengers: Thor|first1=Christina|last1=Pham|first2=Marc|last2=Strom|publisher=Marvel.com|date=September 12, 2012}}</ref> Various efforts to depict Thor dressed in "street clothes" like people of Earth have been criticized as having him look like "an extra in Cameron Crowe's ''Singles''".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/04/a-serious-critique-of-the-mcus-off-duty-fashion.html|title=A Serious Critique of the MCU's Street Style|publisher=[[Vulture.com]]|first=Arye|last=Dworken|date=April 23, 2018}}</ref> The most significant change to Thor's appearance occurs in ''Thor: Ragnorak'', where Thor's long hair is cut short, his hammer is destroyed, and he is dressed as a [[gladiator]] in a battle-tattered costume for his combat with Hulk. The changes were suggested by Hemsworth, who had tired of repeatedly playing the character the same way in previous appearances, and agreed to by director Taika Waititi.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/11/thor-ragnarok-chris-hemsworth-mark-ruffalo-interview-best-thor-movie|title=Thor: Ragnarok Proves Marvel Is Not Afraid to Learn from Its Mistakes|first=Joanna|last=Robinson|publisher=''Variety''|date=November 3, 2007}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
{{Plot|section|date=December 2018}}
===Origins and first visit to Earth===
Thor is the son of [[Odin (comics)|Odin]], king of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]]. As Thor prepares to ascend to the throne, Frost Giants attempt to retrieve an artifact captured by Odin in a war centuries before. Against Odin's order, Thor travels to Jotunheim to confront Frost Giant leader Laufey, accompanied by his brother [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], childhood friend [[Sif (comics)|Sif]] and the [[Warriors Three]]: [[Volstagg]], [[Fandral]], and [[Hogun]]. A battle ensues until Odin intervenes to save the Asgardians, destroying the fragile truce between the two races. For Thor's arrogance, Odin strips his son of his godly power and exiles him to Earth as a mortal, accompanied by his hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]], now protected by an enchantment that allows only the worthy to wield it.

Thor lands in [[New Mexico]], meeting astrophysicist [[Jane Foster (comics)|Dr. Jane Foster]]. Thor discovers Mjolnir's location, but is unable to lift it, and is captured. With the help of  Dr. Erik Selvig, he is freed and resigns himself to exile on Earth as he develops a romance with Jane. Loki seizes the throne as Odin sleeps, and the Warriors Three find Thor, but the [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]] attacks and defeats them, prompting Thor to offer himself instead. Struck by the Destroyer and near death, Thor's sacrifice proves him worthy to wield Mjolnir. The hammer returns to him, restoring his powers and enabling him to defeat the Destroyer. Thor returns to Asgard and fights Loki before destroying the [[BifrÃ¶st Bridge]] to stop Loki's plans, stranding himself in Asgard. Odin awakens and prevents the brothers from falling into the abyss created in the wake of the bridge's destruction, but Loki apparently commits suicide by allowing himself to fall when Odin rejects his pleas for approval. Thor makes amends with Odin, admitting he is not ready to be king.

===Joining the Avengers===
Loki ends up on Earth, causing havoc until he is captured by [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] (Iron Man) and [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]] (Captain America). Thor arrives and frees Loki, hoping to convince him to abandon his plan and return to Asgard. After a brief fight with Stark and Rogers, Thor agrees to take Loki to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s flying aircraft carrier, the [[Helicarrier]]. Agents possessed by Loki attack the Helicarrier, disabling one of its engines in flight and causing [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]] to transform into the Hulk. Thor attempts to stop the Hulk's rampage, and is ejected from the airship as Loki escapes. Loki opens a wormhole over [[New York City]] to allow a [[Chitauri]] army to invade, and Thor and the other Avengers rally in defense of the city. Once the Chitauri are defeated, Thor returns Loki and a source of power called the Tesseract to Asgard.

In Asgard, Thor and his fellow warriors, repel marauders on [[Vanaheim]], home of their comrade [[Hogun]]; it is the final battle in a war to pacify the [[Asgard (comics)#The Nine Worlds|Nine Realms]] following reconstruction of the BifrÃ¶st. The Asgardians learn that the Convergence, a rare alignment of the Nine Realms, is imminent; as the event approaches, portals linking the worlds appear at random. Heimdall alerts Thor that Jane Foster has moved beyond his near all-seeing vision, leading Thor to Earth. Jane inadvertently releases an unearthly force, and Thor returns with her to Asgard. Odin recognizes the force as a weapon known as the Aether, warning that it will kill Jane, and that its return heralds a catastrophic prophecy. The [[Elves (Marvel Comics)#Dark Elves|Dark Elf]] [[Malekith the Accursed|Malekith]] attacks Asgard, searching for Jane. Thor's mother [[Frigga (comics)|Frigga]] is killed protecting Jane, and Malekith is forced to flee. Despite Odin's orders not to leave Asgard, Thor reluctantly enlists the help of Loki, who knows of a secret portal to Svartalfheim, where they will use Jane to lure and confront Malekith, away from Asgard. In return, Thor promises Loki vengeance on Malekith for killing their mother.

Loki tricks Malekith into drawing the Aether out of Jane, but Thor's attempt to destroy the exposed substance fails. Malekith merges with the Aether and leaves in his ship as Loki is fatally wounded. Thor promises to tell their father of his sacrifice. Thor and Jane return to London through another portal. Thor ultimately defeats Malekith in a battle in [[Greenwich]], and returns to Asgard to decline Odin's offer to take the throne, and to tell Odin of Loki's sacrifice. Jane and Thor reunite on Earth.

Thor and the other Avengers search for Loki's scepter on Earth, culminating in a raid on a [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] facility in Sokovia. Stark and Banner discover an [[Artificial intelligence in fiction#Sentient AI|artificial intelligence]] within the scepter's gem, and secretly decide to use it to complete Stark's "[[Ultron]]" global defense program. The unexpectedly sentient Ultron attacks Thor and the Avengers at [[Stark Tower|their headquarters]] before escaping with the scepter. The Avengers track down and attack Ultron and but [[Wanda Maximoff]] subdues them with haunting visions. Thor departs to consult with Dr. Selvig on the meaning of the apocalyptic future he saw in his hallucination. Stark secretly uploads J.A.R.V.I.S.â€”still operational after hiding from Ultron inside the Internetâ€”into a synthetic body captured from Ultron. Thor returns to help activate the body, explaining that the gem on its browâ€”one of the six [[Infinity Stones]], the most powerful objects in existenceâ€”was part of his vision. The Avengers return to Sokovia and defeat Ultron, and Thor returns to Asgard to learn more about the forces he suspects have manipulated recent events.

===Destruction of Asgard and battle with Thanos===
Two years after the battle of Sokovia,{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|As depicted in the 2015 film ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]''.<ref name="Oct2014EventMarvel"/>}} Thor has unsuccessfully sought the [[Infinity Stones]], and is imprisoned by the fire demon [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]] in [[Muspelheim]]. Surtur reveals that Odin is no longer on Asgard, and that the realm will soon be destroyed in the prophesied [[RagnarÃ¶k]], once Surtur unites his crown with the Eternal Flame that burns in Odin's vault. Thor defeats Surtur and claims his crown, believing he has prevented RagnarÃ¶k.

Thor returns to Asgard to find Loki still alive and posing as Odin. Thor forces Loki to help him find their father, and with directions from [[Stephen Strange]] on Earth, they locate Odin in [[Norway]]. A dying Odin explains that his passing will allow his firstborn child, [[Hela (comics)|Hela]], to escape from a prison she was sealed in long ago. Hela appears, destroys Mjolnir, and when Thor and Loki attempt to flee through the BifrÃ¶st, she pursues them and forces them out into space. Thor crash-lands on the  garbage planet [[Sakaar]], and is captured by a slave trader named [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Scrapper 142]], and sold to serve as a gladiator for the planet's ruler, the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]], with whom Loki has already become ingratiated. Thor is forced to compete in the Grandmaster's [[Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions|Contest of Champions]], facing Hulk. Summoning lightning, Thor gets the upper hand, but the Grandmaster sabotages the fight to ensure Hulk's victory. Still enslaved, Thor attempts to convince Hulk and 142 to help him save Asgard, and escapes the palace to find the [[Quinjet]] that brought Hulk to Sakaar, where a recording of [[Natasha Romanoff]] makes Hulk transform back into Bruce Banner.

Loki provides the means to steal one of the Grandmaster's ships, but attempts to betray his brother; Thor anticipates this and leaves Loki behind. Thor, Banner, and 142 escape through a wormhole to Asgard, where Hela's forces are attacking Heimdall and Asgard's citizens. Loki arrives to help, and Thor and 142 battle Hela's forces. Thor, facing Hela, loses an eye, and has a vision of Odin that helps him realize only RagnarÃ¶k can stop Hela. He has Loki place Surtur's crown in the Eternal Flame, and Surtur is reborn and destroys Asgard, seemingly killing Hela. Thor and the others escape with Asgard's remaining citizens aboard the Grandmaster's vessel brought by Loki. Thor, crowned king, decides to take his people to Earth, but they are intercepted by a large spacecraft carrying [[Thanos]] and his minions seeking to extract the [[Infinity Stones#Film|Space Stone]] from the [[Cosmic Cube|Tesseract]].

Thor, Loki, and Hulk are unable to stop them as Thor is imprisoned while Thanos overpowers Hulk and kills Loki. Heimdall uses the BifrÃ¶st to send Hulk to Earth and is killed by Glaive. Thanos and his children depart with the Space Stone, using the Power Stone to obliterate the ship. The [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] respond to a distress call from the Asgardian ship and recover Thor, who guesses that Thanos will be looking for the [[Infinity Stones#Film|Reality Stone]]. [[Rocket Raccoon]] and [[Groot]] accompany Thor to [[Nidavellir]] to retrieve a weapon capable of killing Thanos. They meet [[Eitri (comics)|Eitri]] at an abandoned Nidavellir, and the four create Stormbreaker, an axe that grants Thor the power of the BifrÃ¶st. Thanos invades Wakanda, and his army of Outriders are on the verge of overwhelming the Wakandan forces when Thor, Rocket and Groot arrive on Earth via the BifrÃ¶st and rally with the defenders. Thanos retrieves the last Infinity Stone and, though grievously wounded by Thor, is able to activate the Infinity Gauntlet and teleport away, leaving Thor in Wakanda as half the people in the universe are disintegrated.

==Differences from the comic books==
A major divergence from the comic books is the absence of Thor's comic book alter ego, Donald Blake.<ref name="Bath"/><ref name="Bacon">{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/marvel-movies-not-adapt-comics/|title=The MCU Isn't Pretending To Adapt Marvel Comics Stories Any More|first=Thomas|last=Bacon|publisher=''[[Screen Rant]]''|date=August 28, 2018}}</ref> In the comics, as in the MCU, Odin stripped Thor of his powers and sent him to Earth as punishment for Thor's arrogance and intemperance. However, in the comics, Odin puts Thor into the body of Donald Blake, a crippled human doctor, for the course of a long-running storyline, encompassing years of adventures during which Thor's alter ego is occasionally able to cause Thor to re-emerge to fight villainy. In the MCU, with no element of an alter ego, this banishment is resolved within the first film, over the course of days.<ref name="Bath"/> The lack of an alter ego also impact's Thor's relationships. In the comics, Thor's love interest, Jane Foster, is an assistant to Donald Blake. In the films, she has no prior connection to the character, and meets him due to her work as a physicist studying the type of phenomena his appearances generate. Whereas the comic book Jane Foster has a variety of story arcs, including actually usurping Thor as God of Thunder for a time, she only appears in two of the films, and her character is then disposed of through an off-screen breakup.<ref name="Bath"/> In the comic books, Valkyrie is another alter ego of Thor's, a product of his imagination created during a period of insanity.<ref name="Bath"/> In the MCU, Valkyrie's appearance in ''Thor: Ragnorak'' was as a separate real character who interacts with other characters.

==Reception==
Thor, as a character, was initially less well-received than other Avengers characters, and it has been stated that "before ''Ragnarok'', Thor was an ill-defined if likable meathead of a character, used primarily for punching and occasionally fish-out-of-water jokes made at his expense",<ref name="Moran">{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/thor-ragnarok-saved-franchise/|title=Ragnarok Truly Did Save The Thor Franchise|publisher=''ScreenRant''|first=Sarah|last=Moran|date=September 1, 2018}}</ref> and that films featuring the character were "the studio's least fun franchise".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/10/26/16537186/thor-ragnarok-review|title=Thor: Ragnarok finally makes Thor a hero worth rooting for|publisher=Vox.com|first=Alex|last=Abad-Santosalex|date=November 2, 2017}}</ref> In particular, ''The Dark World'' was criticized for adding "absolutely zero development or growth for its main character", resulting in "little enthusiasm for Thor from either audiences or Marvel".<ref name="Moran"/> ''Thor: Ragnarok'', however, was much better received, to the extent that it has widely been described as saving the franchise.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.comicbookmovie.com/thor/thor_ragnarok/mind-blowing-new-thor-ragnarok-concept-art-reveals-alternate-designs-for-surtur-valkyrie-and-more-a155620|title=Mind-Blowing New THOR: RAGNAROK Concept Art Reveals Alternate Designs For Surtur, Valkyrie, And More|publisher=ComicBookMovie|first=Josh|last=Wilding|date=November 22, 2017|quote=''Thor: Ragnarok'' is an amazing movie and there's no denying that Taika Waitit has saved the franchise and opened the door to a whole new wave of stories revolving around the God of Thunder.}}</ref><ref name="Moran"/>
