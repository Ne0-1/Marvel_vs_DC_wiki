'''Thor''' (often called '''The Mighty Thor''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] in the {{Marvel Universe}}. Based on the god of the same name from [[Norse mythology]] and created by editor-plotter [[Stan Lee]], scripter [[Larry Lieber]], and penciller [[Jack Kirby]], he [[first appeared]] in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' vol. 1, #83 (Aug. 1962). The uncredited initial inker was [[Joe Sinnott]].<ref>Per [http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/MTALES2.HTM#S2 The Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators], "On the letter page of ''Thor'' (I) #433, [[Ron Frenz]] claims that this story was inked by Joe Sinnott; confirmed by [Sinnot's son,] Mark Sinnott.</ref>

==Publication history==
Writer-editor Stan Lee described Thor's genesis as following the creation of the [[Hulk]]. "I thought it would be fun to invent someone as powerful as, or perhaps even more powerful than, the Incredible Hulk. But how do you make someone stronger than the strongest human? It finally came to me: Don't make him human — make him a god".<ref name="excel">In his autobiography ''Excelsior!: The Amazing Life of Stan Lee'' (Fireside, 2002; ISBN 0-684-87305-2), by Lee and George Mair, Lee gave his perspective of Thor's genesis:
{{cquote|I wanted to come up with something totally different. I thought it would fun to invent someone as powerful as, or perhaps even more powerful than, the Incredible Hulk. But how do you make someone stronger than the strongest human? It finally came to me: Don't make him human &mdash; make him a god. ... I decided readers were already pretty familiar with the Greek and Roman gods. It might be fun to delve into the old Norse legends.... Besides, I pictured Norse gods looking like Vikings of old, with the flowing beards, horned helmets, and battle clubs. I liked imagery.<br>One of our established titles, ''Journey into Mystery'', needed a shot in the arm, shot I picked Thor ... to headline the book. After writing an outline depicting the story and the characters I had in mind, I asked my brother, Larry, to write the script because I didn't have time. ...[A]nd it was only natural for me to assign the penciling to Jack Kirby, who drew it as though he had spent his whole life in Asgard, the home of the gods.}}</ref> Following Thor's debut in the [[science fiction]]/[[fantasy]] [[anthological]] title ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'', the 13-page feature "The Mighty Thor" continued under scripter Larry Lieber and consecutive pencilers Jack Kirby and [[Don Heck]]. 

One element Lieber created in Marvel's Thor mythos was the description of Thor's weapon as the "Uru Hammer". While the hammer was later named Mjolnir, in accordance with Norse mythology, Lieber's made-up "[[Uru (Marvel Comics)|uru]]" was eventually [[Retcon|retconned]] to be the metal from which it was forged.

The five-page featurette "Tales of Asgard" was added in ''Journey into Mystery'' vol. 1, #97 (Oct. 1963) followed by ''The Mighty Thor'' becoming the dominant cover logo with issue #104 (May 1964). The feature itself expanded to 18 pages in #105, which eliminated the remaining anthological story from each issue; it was reduced to 16 pages five issues later. ''Journey into Mystery'' was retitled ''The Mighty Thor'' with issue #126 (March 1966). "Tales of Asgard" was replaced by a five-page featurette starring the "[[Inhumans|The Inhumans]]", from #146–152 (Nov. 1967–May 1968), after which featurettes were dropped and the Thor stories reverted to Marvel's then-standard 20-page length.

As a consequence of the "[[Heroes Reborn]]" [[fictional crossover|crossover]] event of the 1990s, Thor was removed from [[Earth-616]] and revamped in a new universe. The title reverted to ''Journey into Mystery'' with issue #503 (Nov. 1996)

When Thor and the other heroes eventually returned to the [[Earth-616]] Marvel Universe, a new Thor title was launched, which received dual numbering halfway through the run. This second ''Thor'' series ran 85 issues (July 1998–Dec 2004), with dual numbering beginning as of vol. 2, #36, with the final issue in the old numbering being #587.

Marvel announced in 2006 that Thor will receive a new solo title, to be written by [[J. Michael Straczynski]], in 2007.<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=8340 "Marvel's Big Plans Revealed at Baltimore Retailer Conference"]</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
The Marvel version of Thor is noble and very self-assured, sometimes to the point of arrogance. [[Odin (comics)|Odin]] decides his son needs to be taught humility and consequently places Thor (without memories of godhood) into the body and memories of an existing, partially disabled human medical student, Donald Blake. After becoming a doctor and thoroughly believing himself to be the young [[surgeon]] Blake, he later discovers Thor's disguised hammer and learns to change back and forth into the Thunder God. The real Blake's persona remains elsewhere until many years later, after Odin becomes satisfied of Thor's humility and lifts the spell, thereby removing the need for a mortal alter ego. The mortal experience, however, shapes Thor into an honorable and courteous individual, who is loyal to all comrades.

===Protector of Midgard===
Being the son of the Elder Goddess [[Gaea (comics)|Gaea]], Thor has a natural affinity for Earth and feels obliged to protect the mortals that occupy it. Thor's time on Earth is marked by constant battles against super villains, monsters, cosmic beings and even other gods. Thor's principal foe is his adopted brother [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], who has hated Thor since childhood. While a master of magic with power that dwarfs even that of Earth's Sorcerer Supreme [[Doctor Strange|Dr. Strange]], <ref>''Strange Tales'' vol. 1, #123</ref> Loki prefers to employ the use of minions in his battle against Thor. Ever the schemer, Loki is cautious not to be seen to be directly involved for fear of angering Odin. To that end, Loki creates two long-lasting foes — the [[Absorbing Man]] and the [[Wrecker (comics)|Wrecker]]. Loki also tricks others into fighting on his behalf, such as the giant Asgardian troll [[Ulik]], the dragon [[Fafnir (comics)|Fafnir]] and the [[Silver Surfer]]. 

Sometimes, however, Loki overreaches himself and faces disaster. Guiding a mortal to the shrine of the Asgardian [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]] — which then absorbs the mortal's essence and battles Thor — almost proves fatal for Loki, as Odin became aware of the conflict and promises that should Thor perish, the trickster god would quickly follow. On another occasion, Loki uses the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] as a lure to draw Thor out; while this proved successful, it resulted in the formation of superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], of which Thor is a founding and longstanding member. <ref>''Avengers'' vol. 1, #1</ref>

Thor's other mortal foes include the [[Wrecking Crew (comics)|Wrecking Crew]] and the [[Grey Gargoyle]], but among his powerful foes are the Asgardian monsters as [[Mangog]], the Frost Giants, the [[Enchanters Three]], the [[Midgard Serpent (comics)|Midgard Serpent]] and the fire-demon [[Surtur (comics)|Surtur]]. Thor's gallery of mystical/cosmic rogues extends to [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], [[Thanos]], the [[God Eater (comics)|God Eater]], the [[Dark Gods (comics)|Dark Gods]], the Sh'iar Praetor [[Gladiator (Shi'ar)|Gladiator]], and the god-slayer [[Desak]]. Thor has even fought against the combined might of the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]], when their Fourth Host arrived to judge Earth. <ref>''Thor'' vol. 1, #300</ref>

===The Reigning===
[[Image:Thor-54.jpg|thumb|left|210px|The Reigning begins: ''Thor'' vol. 2, #54 (Dec. 2002). Cover art by Tom Raney.]] 
The second volume of the Thor comic saw significant development for both Thor and his supporting cast. Much of the title dealt with the consequences of Thor's decision to intervene in the affairs of Earth. <ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #41 - 85</ref> After reluctantly assuming the throne of Asgard, Thor sees mortals at their worst and reshapes the world in his image. A young religious mutant called Davis; [[Zarrko|Zarrko the Tomorrow Man]]; [[Perrikus]] of the Dark Gods; the U.S. Government and even his fellow Avengers oppose him in vain.   A nightmarish future follows as Thor and the Asgardians conquer Earth and slay or imprison those who oppose them, including many of Thor's former allies. He marries Amora, the [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]], and has a son, [[Magni (comics)|Magni]]. Wracked with guilt, he is eventually drawn into a final battle with Tarene and a Desak-occupied Destroyer in a [[Time travel|time-travel]] bid to undo what he has done.

===Ragnarok===
In this arc marking the start of Ragnarok, a.k.a. Götterdämmerung or "the twilight of the gods", Loki revives Surtur, who forges new uru hammers for Loki's Storm Giant followers. Thor learns that the Ragnarok cycle is the result of self-styled "gods to the gods" known as Those Who Sit Above in Shadow, who feed on the cycle. Thor confronts the Norns (Fates), breaking the Ragnarok cycle, and then enters hibernation in deep space, with his fate unknown to the Avengers, who believe him missing in action.

===Civil War===
{{main|Civil War (comics)}}
Just prior to the Civil War beginning, Thor's hammer Mjolnir is found on Earth and put under [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]] protection. Six months later, [[Doctor Doom]] - who escapes from Hell as Mjolnir falls through that dimensional plane - tries to unsuccessfully to claim the hammer. The hammer is later claimed by a mysterious man carrying a bag with the initials "D.B". <ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol 1, #536</ref>

A cloned version of Thor appears in ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'', the main [[limited series]] for the crossover. Grown from hair fragments taken during an early Avengers meeting, the clone brings a battle between the heroes to a standstill when he kills [[Bill Foster (comics)|Goliath]] (Bill Foster) <!--name in parentheses since there have been at least 3 men who have been Goliath--> in ''Civil War'' #4 (Oct. 2006) with what is later revealed to be a technological copy of Mjolnir.

==Powers and abilities==
Thor is the Norse god of thunder and lightning.  Like all Asgardians, Thor is not truly immortal but relies upon periodic consumption of the Golden Apples of [[Idun]] to sustain his lifespan, which to date has lasted many millenia. 

The strongest of the Norse gods, Thor has performed feats such as lifting a section of the World Serpent and hurling the Odinsword, an extra-dimensional object of incredible power, through the Celestial Arishem. <ref>Thor vol. 1, #300</ref> Thor possesses vast superhuman strength rivaling that of other Marvel powerhouses such as the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]], and [[Gladiator (Shi'ar)|Gladiator]]. He also possesses godly stamina, is highly resistant to physical injury and possesses superior speed and reflexes. If pressed in battle, Thor is capable of entering into a "berserker rage" which will increase his strength tenfold. <ref>''Thor'' vol. 1, #502</ref>  

In addition, Thor is a superb hand-to-hand combatant and has mastered a number of weapons such as the war hammer, sword, and mace. Thor is also very cunning and intuitive in battle, with many centuries of experience. Thor possesses two items that assist him in combat: the Belt of Strength and his mystical hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]]. The first item doubles Thor's strength, <ref>First mentioned Journey Into Mystery vol. 1, #91</ref> while the second is used for flight; weather control; energy projection; dimensional control; matter manipulation and the God Blast, which is a channelling of Thor's godly essence into one massive burst of energy.

Thor eventually inherited the Odinforce, which saw him become as powerful as his father, Odin. In this form, Thor was capable of manipulating vast amounts of energy for a variety of purposes including temporary augmentation of physical attributes, energy projection, matter manipulation and interdimensional teleportation. While in possession of the Odinforce, Thor was capable of decapitating a Desak-occupied Destroyer with one hammer throw. Thor later acquired the knowledge of the Runes and a level of enlightenment that allowed him to free Asgard from the eternal cycle of Ragnarok. Leaving Asgard to become "Endgame Thor" and a cosmic deity, he entered into hibernation in an unknown location in space.

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the [[Age of Apocalypse]], Donald Blake never discovered that he was the reincarnation of Thor, instead he was an agent of the Human High Council and a doctor, travelling with [[Gwen Stacy]] to provide aid in human refugee camps such as those of Wakanda. 

===Marvel 2099===
The comics set in the future of [[Marvel 2099]] featured Thor worshippers known as "Thorites". The "Fall of the Hammer" storyline, which [[crossover (fiction)|crossed over]] between all the 2099 titles, involved a faked return of the Norse gods, staged by a megacorporation to acquire influence over the Thorites. The gods' abilities were simulated by [[nanotechnology]]. The role of Thor was taken by a Thorite priest (who, while the nanotech was active, honestly believed himself to be the god) named '''Cecil MacAdam'''.
 
While the true Thor remained missing, Mjolnir was discovered and used briefly by a resurrected [[Captain America]] in the ''2099: Manifest Destiny'' oneshot.

===Ultimate Marvel===
{{main|Ultimate Thor}}

Thor, a member of the superhero team the [[Ultimates]] in the [[Ultimate Marvel Universe]], is a mysteriously presented character who believes himself to be the Norse Thunder God, but whom many other characters believe is delusional. 

===Marvel 1602===
Thor appeared in ''[[Marvel 1602]]'' - his alter ego was an elderly Christian priest named Donal, who avoids making the transformation if possible, as even aknowledging the Norse god's existence is blasphemous.
