'''Thor''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] that appears in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by editor-plotter [[Stan Lee]], scripter [[Larry Lieber]], and penciller [[Jack Kirby]], the character [[First appearance|first appears]] in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]''  #83 (Aug. 1962) and is based on the [[deity]] of the [[Thor|same name]] from [[Norse mythology]].

==Publication history==
Writer-editor Stan Lee described Thor's genesis:{{cquote|[H]ow do you make someone stronger than the strongest person? It finally came to me: Don't make him human &mdash; make him a god. I decided readers were already pretty familiar with the Greek and Roman gods. It might be fun to delve into the old Norse legends.... Besides, I pictured Norse gods looking like Vikings of old, with the flowing beards, horned helmets, and battle clubs. &nbsp;...''Journey into Mystery'', needed a shot in the arm, so I picked Thor ... to headline the book. After writing an outline depicting the story and the characters I had in mind, I asked my brother, Larry, to write the script because I didn't have time. ...and it was only natural for me to assign the penciling to Jack Kirby....<ref name="excel">''Excelsior!: The Amazing Life of Stan Lee'' (Fireside, 2002; ISBN 0-684-87305-2), by Lee and George Mair}</ref>}}

Following Thor's debut in the [[science fiction]]/[[fantasy]] [[anthology]] title ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'', the 13-page feature "The Mighty Thor" continued to be plotted by Lee but scripted by Lee's brother [[Larry Lieber]] or [[Robert Bernstein (comics)|Robert Bernstein]] (working under the pseudonym "R. Berns"). Penciling was by either Jack Kirby, [[Joe Sinnott]], [[Don Heck]], or, for a single issue, [[Al Hartley]]. Then with ''Journey into Mystery'' #101 (Feb. 1964), the series began a long and definitive run by Lee and Kirby that lasted until the by-then-retitled ''The Mighty Thor'' #179 (Aug. 1970). 

The five-page featurette "Tales of Asgard" was added in ''Journey into Mystery'' # 97 (Oct. 1963) followed by "The Mighty Thor"<!--not yet official title of comic, so not ital--> becoming the dominant cover logo with issue #104 (May 1964). The feature itself expanded to 18 pages in #105, which eliminated the remaining anthological story from each issue; it was reduced to 16 pages five issues later. 
[[Image:Jim083.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #83 (Aug. 1962): Thor's debut. Cover art by [[Jack Kirby]] and [[Joe Sinnott]].<ref name="sinnot">Per [http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/MTALES2.HTM#S2 The Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators], "On the letter page of ''Thor'' (I) #433, [[Ron Frenz]] claims that this story was inked by Joe Sinnott; confirmed by [Sinnot's son,] Mark Sinnott".</ref>]] 
''Journey into Mystery'' was retitled ''The Mighty Thor'' with issue #126 (March 1966). "Tales of Asgard" was replaced by a five-page featurette starring the "[[Inhumans|The Inhumans]]", from #146–152 (Nov. 1967 – May 1968), after which featurettes were dropped and the Thor stories reverted to Marvel's then-standard 20-page length.

Once Kirby left the book, [[John Buscema]] and [[Neal Adams]] each drew a few issues. Buscema became the regular artist with issue #182 (Nov. 1970) and continued to draw the book almost without interruption until #278 (Dec. 1978). Lee stopped scripting soon after Kirby left, and during Buscema's long stint on the book, the stories were mostly written by [[Gerry Conway]], [[Len Wein]], or [[Roy Thomas]]. Thomas continued to write the book after Buscema's departure, working much of the time with the artist [[Keith Pollard]], but for several years ''The Mighty Thor'' had a changing creative team. 

[[Walt Simonson]] took over both writing and art as of #337 (Nov. 1983). Simonson's run as writer-artist lasted until #367 (May 1986), although he continued to write – and occasionally draw – the book until issue #382 (Aug. 1987). Simonson was responsible for introducing the character [[Beta Ray Bill]], in what was regarded as a popular and critically acclaimed run. <ref>[http://www.popimage.com/reviews/071001thorsimonsonrev.html Review of a trade paperback collecting some of Simonson's run at PopImage.com]</ref><ref>[http://www.silverbulletcomics.com/news/story.php?a=2189 Essay on what makes certain stories definitive at Silver bullet Comics.]</ref>

After Simonson's departure, Marvel's editor-in-chief at the time, [[Tom DeFalco]], became the writer. Working primarily with artist [[Ron Frenz]], DeFalco stayed on the book until #459 (Feb. 1993).

As a consequence of the "[[Heroes Reborn]]" [[fictional crossover|crossover]] event of the 1990s, Thor was removed from mainstream Marvel continuity and, with many other Marvel characters, re-imagined in an [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|alternate universe]] for one year. The ''Thor'' title reverted to ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' with issue #503 (Nov. 1996), and ran four different, sequential features ("The Lost Gods", "[[Shang-Chi|Master of Kung Fu]]", "[[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]]", and "[[Hannibal King]]") before ceasing publication with #521 (June 1998).

When Thor and the other heroes returned to the [[Marvel Universe]], the 85-issue ''Thor'' vol. 2 was launched, premiering with #1 (July 1998). This series began using dual numbering to reflect the original Thor series, with issue #36 / #538 (June 2001). [[Dan Jurgens]] was writer for a majority of this series' run, leaving with issue #79 (July 2004). Scot G. Eaton joined him, as penciller, on #68-79. They were followed by co-writers Daniel Berman and [[Michael Avon Oeming]] and penciller-inker [[Andrea Di Vito]] for the "[[Avengers Disassembled]]" crossover storyline through the final issue #85 / #587 (Dec. 2004)

A third volume titled ''Thor'' premiered with a first issue cover-dated September 2007, written by [[J. Michael Straczynski]] and penciled by [[Olivier Coipel]].  Beginning in January 2009, this volume will revert to issue #600 (replacing issue #13), reflecting the total number of Thor-centric books, between ''Journey into Mystery'' and ''Thor''/''Mighty Thor''.<ref>[http://comics.ign.com/articles/919/919979p1.html Debuting Thor #600], [[IGN]]</ref><ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/100817-JMS-on-Thor.html Holding the Hammer: JMS Talks Thor], [[Newsarama]], October 17, 2008</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Thor's father [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]] decides his son needs to be taught humility and consequently places Thor (without memories of godhood) into the body and memories of an existing, partially disabled human medical student, Donald Blake. After becoming a doctor and thoroughly believing himself to be the young surgeon Blake, he later discovers Thor's disguised hammer and learns to change back and forth into the Thunder God. The real Blake's persona remains elsewhere until many years later, after Odin becomes satisfied of Thor's humility and lifts the spell, thereby removing the need for a mortal alter ego. The mortal experience, however, shapes Thor into an honorable and courteous individual, who is loyal to all comrades.

===Protector of Midgard===
Being the son of the [[Elder Gods (Marvel Comics)|Elder Goddess]] [[Gaea (Marvel Comics)|Gaea]], Thor has a natural affinity for Earth and feels obliged to protect the mortals that occupy it. Thor's time on Earth is marked by battles against [[supervillain]]s, monsters, cosmic beings, and even other gods. 

Thor's principal foe is his adopted brother [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], who has hated Thor since childhood. Although a master of magic, Loki usually avoids direct confrontations for fear of angering Odin. He is discreetly responsible for the creation and awakening of three of Thor's principal foes: the [[Absorbing Man]];<ref>First appears ''Journey Into Mystery'' #114 (March 1965)</ref> the [[Wrecker (comics)|Wrecker]],<ref>First appears ''Thor'' #148 (Jan. 1968)</ref> and the [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]].<ref>First appears ''Journey Into Mystery'' #118 (July 1965)</ref> On one noteworthy occasion, Loki's tactics are accidentally beneficial - although successful in using the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] to draw Thor into battle, it results in the formation of the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], of which Thor is a founding and longstanding member.<ref>''The Avengers'' #1 (Sept. 1963)</ref>

Thor's mortal foes include the [[Radioactive Man (comics)|Radioactive Man]];<ref>First appears ''Journey Into Mystery'' #93 (June 1963)</ref> [[Grey Gargoyle]];<ref>First appears ''Journey Into Mystery'' #107 Aug. 1964</ref> and [[Wrecking Crew (comics)|Wrecking Crew]].<ref>First battle with Thor ''Thor'' #304 (Feb. 1981)</ref> Thor's Asgardian foes include the Storm<ref>''Thor'' Annual #12 (1984)</ref> and Frost Giants;<ref>''Thor'' #40 (Oct. 2001)</ref> the [[Enchanters Three]];<ref>First appears ''Thor'' #143 (Aug. 1967)</ref>[[Mangog]];<ref>First appears ''Thor'' #154 (July 1968)</ref> the [[Midgard Serpent (Marvel Comics)|Midgard Serpent]],<ref>First appears ''Thor'' #200 (June 1972)</ref> the [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]] and [[Executioner (comics)|Executioner]]<ref>First appear ''Journey Into Mystery'' #103 (April 1964)</ref> and the fire-demon [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]].<ref>First appears ''Journey Into Mystery'' #97 (Oct. 1963)</ref> Thor has also faced a number of mystical and cosmic foes, such as [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]],<ref>First battle with Thor ''Thor'' #180 (Sept. 1970)</ref> [[Thanos]], <ref>First battle with Thor ''Avengers Annual'' #7 (1977)</ref> the [[Atum (comics)|God Eater]],<ref>First appears ''Thor'' Annual #10 (1982)</ref> the [[Dark Gods (Marvel Comics)|Dark Gods]],<ref>First appear ''Thor'' vol. 2, #4 (Oct. 1998)</ref> the [[Shi'ar]] Praetor [[Gladiator (Kallark)|Gladiator]],<ref>First battle with Thor ''Thor'' vol. 2, #34 (April 2001)</ref> and the god-slayer [[Desak]].<ref>First appears ''Thor Annual 2001''</ref> Thor also encountered the Fourth [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]] Host when it arrives to judge Earth. <ref>''Thor'' #300 (Oct. 1980)</ref>

===The Reigning===
When Thor decides to intervene in the affairs of Earth, it has major repercussions. <ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #41-85 (Nov. 2001 - Dec. 2004)</ref> After reluctantly assuming the throne of Asgard, Thor sees mortals at their worst and reshapes the world in his image. A nightmarish future follows as Thor and the Asgardians conquer Earth and slay or imprison those who oppose them, including a young religious mutant called Davis; [[Zarrko|Zarrko the Tomorrow Man]]; [[Perrikus]] of the Dark Gods; the U.S. Government, and even his fellow Avengers. He marries Amora (the Enchantress), and has a son, [[Magni (Marvel Comics)|Magni]]. Wracked with guilt, Thor is eventually drawn into a final battle with [[Thor Girl|Tarene]] and a Desak-occupied Destroyer in a [[time travel]] bid to undo what he has done. 

When the timeline is reset, Loki revives Surtur, who forges new uru hammers for Loki's Storm Giant followers and begins [[Ragnarök]], "the twilight of the gods". Thor learns that the Ragnarok cycle is the result of self-styled "gods to the gods" known as '''Those Who Sit Above in Shadow''', who feed on the cycle. Thor confronts the [[Norns (Marvel Comics)|Norns]] (Fates), breaking the Ragnarok cycle, and then enters a stasis, sleeping "the sleep of the gods." With his fate unknown to the Avengers, he is believed to be missing in action.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #85 (Dec. 2004)</ref>

Thor's hammer [[Mjolnir (Marvel Comics)|Mjolnir]] is found on Earth and put under U.S. Army protection. Sometime later, the supervillain [[Doctor Doom]] is escaping from Hell as Mjolnir falls through that dimensional plane, and tries unsuccessfully to claim the hammer, which eventually comes into the possession of a man carrying a bag with the initials "D.B".<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #536 (May 2006)</ref> During a battle in the superhero "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]" between pro- and anti-Superhuman Registration factions, Thor apparently appears and kills the superhero [[Bill Foster (comics)|Goliath]].<ref>''Civil War'' #4 (Oct. 2006)</ref> This "Thor" is later revealed to be a fusion of cloning technology and cybernetics created by scientists [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] and [[Henry Pym]], and is destroyed by the anti-registration superhero [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]].<ref>''Civil War'' #7 (Jan. 2007)</ref>
[[Image:Thor55.jpg|thumb|right|''Thor'' #55 (July 2000). Cover art by [[Tom Raney]].]]

===New beginning===
Donald Blake, upon touching the hammer Mjolnir, is transported to the void of non-existence in which Thor now resides. Blake explains that when [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]] originally removed the Blake persona from Thor,<ref>''Thor'' #340 (Feb. 1984)</ref> Blake was consigned to the void that Thor now inhabits. When Thor entered that void, Blake was suddenly restored to being, in [[New York City]]. Blake convinces Thor to wield Mjolnir once more, return to Earth, and renew the dual identity with Blake. Blake also reveals that Thor's fellow Asgardians are actually not dead but hidden on Earth.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 3, #1 (Sept. 2007)</ref>

Thor rebuilds Asgard in [[Oklahoma]], paying for the land with Asgardian treasure.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 3, #2 (Oct. 2007)</ref> He then learns of the events of the superhero-registration "Civil War" and is angered that Tony Stark ([[Iron Man]]) and others used his [[DNA]] to create a Thor clone. Stark, in response, suggests Asgard may be considered a foreign [[diplomatic mission|embassy]], with [[diplomatic immunity]] granted to its inhabitants. Thor then begins searching for his fellow Asgardians,<ref>''Thor'' vol. 3, #3 - 5 (Nov. 2007 - Jan. 2008)</ref> and although successfully restoring them all (with the exception of Sif who is trapped in an old woman's body), does not attempt to find his father, Odin. He eventually finds his father in [[Valhalla]], waging constant battle with the fire demon [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]]. There Odin advises his son that Thor must lead the Asgardians.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 3, #7 - 8 (March-April 2008)</ref> 

Thor later rescues and heals ally Beta Ray Bill, who after being given Mjolnir aids Thor in a battle against an invading force of alien [[Skrulls]].<ref>''Secret Invasion: Thor'' #1 (Aug. 2008)</ref> Thor also participates in the final battle against the Skrull forces, and is forced to sacrifice Avenger ally the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]]. <ref>''Secret Invasion'' #8 (Nov. 2008)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Like all Asgardians, Thor is not truly immortal but relies upon periodic consumption of the Golden Apples of [[Idunn (Marvel Comics)|Idunn]] to sustain his lifespan, which to date has lasted many millennia. Being an Asgardian-Elder God hybrid, Thor is the strongest of the Norse gods. He has performed feats such as lifting a large percentage of the World Serpent, stated to be one third the size of the [[Earth]]<ref>''Thor'' #379 (May 1987)</ref>, and hurling the Odinsword, an enormous mystical blade of incalculable weight, through a [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]].<ref>''Thor'' #300 (Oct. 1980)</ref> If pressed in battle, Thor is also capable of entering into a state known as the "[[berserker|Warrior's Madness]]" ("bärsärkargång" in Norse), which will temporarily increase his strength tenfold.<ref>''Thor'' #166 (July 1969); ''Hulk''#440 (Apr. 1996); ''Thor'' #502 (Sep. 1996)</ref> He also possesses virtually inexhaustible godly stamina, high resistance to physical injury (eg. rocket fire,<ref>''Thor'' #309 (July 1981)</ref> falls from orbital heights<ref>''Thor'' #324 (Oct. 1982)</ref>), immunity to all Earthly diseases, and superhuman agility and reflexes.

With centuries of experience, Thor is a superb hand-to-hand combatant and a weapons master excelling in the use of the war hammer, sword and mace. Thor possesses two items that assist him in combat: the enchanted Belt of Strength, and his mystical hammer [[Mjolnir (Marvel Comics)|Mjolnir]]. The first item doubles Thor's strength<ref>First mentioned in ''Journey Into Mystery''  #91 (April 1963)</ref> while the second is used for control of his weather abilities; flight<ref>On one occasion Thor uses a chariot drawn by two huge mystical goats, Toothgnasher and Toothgrinder. See ''Thor'' #364 - 366 (Feb. - Apr. 1986)</ref> energy projection and absorption; dimensional apertures; matter manipulation and the most powerful of his offensives, the God Blast, and the Anti-Force.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #25 (July 2000)</ref><ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #12 (June 1999)</ref>  

After Odin's death, Thor inherited his father's power, the Odinforce. Thor was then capable of feats such as reconstructing the Earth's Moon,<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #57 (Feb. 2003)</ref> willing the Asgardian monster [[Mangog]] into nothingness<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #84 (Nov. 2004)</ref> and, by focusing his entire power into a hammer throw, decapitating a [[Desak]]-occupied [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]].<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #79 (July 2004)</ref> Thor later acquired mastery of the Runes, and a level of enlightenment that allowed him to free Asgard from the eternal cycle of Ragnarok and become even more powerful than his father.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #83 - 85 (Oct. - Dec. 2004)</ref>
