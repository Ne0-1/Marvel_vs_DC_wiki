'''Thor''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[superhero]] who appears in publications published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character [[First appearance|first appears]] in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]''  #83 (August 1962) and was created by editor-plotter [[Stan Lee]], scripter [[Larry Lieber]], and penciller [[Jack Kirby]]. 

Debuting in the [[Silver Age of comic books]], the character is based on the [[Thor]] of [[Norse mythology]]. Thor has starred in several ongoing series; several [[limited series]] and has been a perennial member of the [[superhero]] team the ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'', appearing in each of the three titles. The character has also appeared in associated Marvel merchandise including [[animated]] [[television series]]; [[clothing]]; [[toy]]s; [[trading cards]] and [[video game]]s.

==Publication history==
Writer-editor Stan Lee described Thor's genesis, in the context of having been after the creation of the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]:{{cquote|[H]ow do you make someone stronger than the strongest person? It finally came to me: Don't make him human &mdash; make him a god. I decided readers were already pretty familiar with the Greek and Roman gods. It might be fun to delve into the old Norse legends.... Besides, I pictured Norse gods looking like Vikings of old, with the flowing beards, horned helmets, and battle clubs. &nbsp;...''Journey into Mystery'', needed a shot in the arm, so I picked Thor ... to headline the book. After writing an outline depicting the story and the characters I had in mind, I asked my brother, Larry, to write the script because I didn't have time. ...and it was only natural for me to assign the penciling to Jack Kirby....<ref name="excel">''Excelsior!: The Amazing Life of Stan Lee'' (Fireside, 2002; ISBN 0-684-87305-2), by Lee and George Mair}</ref>}}

Following Thor's debut in the [[science fiction]]/[[fantasy]] [[anthology]] title ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'', the 13-page feature "The Mighty Thor" continued to be plotted by Lee but scripted by Lee's brother [[Larry Lieber]] or [[Robert Bernstein (comics)|Robert Bernstein]] (working under the pseudonym "R. Berns"). Penciling was by either Jack Kirby, [[Joe Sinnott]], [[Don Heck]], or, for a single issue, [[Al Hartley]]. With ''Journey into Mystery'' #101 (Feb. 1964), the series began a long and definitive run by Lee and Kirby that lasted until the by-then-retitled ''The Mighty Thor'' #179 (Aug. 1970).

The five-page featurette "Tales of Asgard" was added in ''Journey into Mystery'' # 97 (Oct. 1963) followed by "The Mighty Thor"<!--not yet official title of comic, so not ital--> becoming the dominant cover logo with issue #104 (May 1964). The feature itself expanded to 18 pages in #105, which eliminated the remaining anthological story from each issue; it was reduced to 16 pages five issues later.

[[Image:Jim083.jpg|thumb|right|Thor debuts on the cover of ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #83 (Aug. 1962). Cover art by [[Jack Kirby]] and [[Joe Sinnott]].]]

''Journey into Mystery'' was retitled ''The Mighty Thor'' with issue #126 (March 1966). "Tales of Asgard" was replaced by a five-page featurette starring the "[[Inhumans|The Inhumans]]", from #146–152 (Nov. 1967 – May 1968), after which featurettes were dropped and the Thor stories reverted to Marvel's then-standard 20-page length.

Once Kirby left the book, [[John Buscema]] and [[Neal Adams]] each drew a few issues. Buscema became the regular artist with issue #182 (Nov. 1970) and continued to draw the book almost without interruption until #278 (Dec. 1978). Lee stopped scripting soon after Kirby left, and during Buscema's long stint on the book, the stories were mostly written by [[Gerry Conway]], [[Len Wein]], or [[Roy Thomas]]. Thomas continued to write the book after Buscema's departure, working much of the time with the artist [[Keith Pollard]]; during this period Thomas integrated many elements of traditional Norse mythology into the title, with specific stories translated into comics form.<ref>Such as the [[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring of Nibelung]] saga, in ''The Mighty Thor'' issues #293–297 (cover dated March – July 1980).</ref> Following Thomas's tenure, for several years ''The Mighty Thor'' had a changing creative team.

[[Walt Simonson]] took over both writing and art as of #337 (Nov. 1983). Simonson's run as writer-artist lasted until #367 (May 1986), although he continued to write – and occasionally draw – the book until issue #382 (Aug. 1987). Simonson was responsible for introducing the character [[Beta Ray Bill]], in what was regarded as a popular and critically acclaimed run.<ref>[http://www.popimage.com/reviews/071001thorsimonsonrev.html Review of a trade paperback collecting some of Simonson's run at PopImage.com]</ref><ref>[http://www.silverbulletcomics.com/news/story.php?a=2189 Essay on what makes certain stories definitive at Silver bullet Comics.]</ref>

After Simonson's departure, Marvel's editor-in-chief at the time, [[Tom DeFalco]], became the writer. Working primarily with artist [[Ron Frenz]], DeFalco stayed on the book until #459 (Feb. 1993).

As a consequence of the "[[Heroes Reborn]]" [[fictional crossover|crossover]] event of the 1990s, Thor was removed from mainstream Marvel continuity and, with many other Marvel characters, re-imagined in an [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|alternate universe]] for one year. The ''Thor'' title reverted to ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' with issue #503 (Nov. 1996), and ran four different, sequential features ("The Lost Gods", "[[Shang-Chi|Master of Kung Fu]]", "[[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]]", and "[[Hannibal King]]") before ceasing publication with #521 (June 1998).

When Thor and the other heroes returned to the [[Marvel Universe]], the 85-issue ''Thor'' vol. 2 was launched, premiering with #1 (July 1998). This series began using dual numbering to reflect the original Thor series, with issue #36 / #538 (June 2001). [[Dan Jurgens]] was writer for a majority of this series' run, leaving with issue #79 (July 2004). Scot G. Eaton joined him, as penciller, on #68-79. They were followed by co-writers Daniel Berman and [[Michael Avon Oeming]] and penciller-inker [[Andrea Di Vito]] for the "[[Avengers Disassembled]]" crossover storyline through the final issue #85 / #587 (Dec. 2004)

A third volume titled ''Thor'' premiered with a first issue cover-dated September 2007, written by [[J. Michael Straczynski]] and penciled by [[Olivier Coipel]].  In January 2009, the third volume reverted to issue #600 (replacing issue #13), reflecting the total number of Thor-centric books, between ''Journey into Mystery'' and ''Thor''/''Mighty Thor''.<ref>[http://comics.ign.com/articles/919/919979p1.html Debuting Thor #600], [[IGN]]</ref><ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/100817-JMS-on-Thor.html Holding the Hammer: JMS Talks Thor], [[Newsarama]], October 17, 2008</ref> Following Straczynski's departure from the title [[Kieron Gillen]] came on board for ''Thor #604-609.<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=22662 Kieron Gillen Talks Thor], [[Comic Book Resources]], August 24, 2009</ref>

Writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] said in October 2009, that Thor, along with Captain America and Iron Man, will rejoin the Avengers in the miniseries ''[[Siege (comics)|Siege]]''.<ref>[http://g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/699789/Fresh-Ink-Online-Presents-Brian-Michael-Bendis-Interview.html "Fresh Ink Online Presents: Brian Michael Bendis Interview"], G4TV.com, posted October 6, 2009 (n.d.; when accessed October 10, 2009, posting given as "4 days ago")</ref>

==Fictional biography==

Thor's father [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]] decides his son needs to be taught humility and consequently places Thor (without memories of godhood) into the body and memories of an existing, partially disabled human medical student, Donald Blake. After becoming a doctor and thoroughly believing himself to be the young surgeon Blake, he later discovers Thor's disguised hammer and learns to change back and forth into the Thunder God. The real Blake's persona remains elsewhere until many years later, after Odin becomes satisfied of Thor's humility and lifts the spell, thereby removing the need for a mortal alter ego.

===Protector of Midgard===

Being the son of the [[Elder Gods (Marvel Comics)|Elder Goddess]] [[Gaea (Marvel Comics)|Gaea]], Thor has a natural affinity for Earth and feels obliged to protect the mortals that occupy it. Thor's time on Earth is marked by battles against [[supervillain]]s, monsters, cosmic beings, and even other gods.

Thor's principal foe is his adopted brother [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], who has hated Thor since childhood. Although a master of magic, Loki usually avoids direct confrontations for fear of angering Odin. He is discreetly responsible for the creation and awakening of three of Thor's principal foes: the [[Absorbing Man]];<ref>First appears ''Journey Into Mystery'' #114 (March 1965)</ref> the [[Wrecker (comics)|Wrecker]],<ref>First appears ''Thor'' #148 (Jan. 1968)</ref> and the [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]].<ref>First appears ''Journey Into Mystery'' #118 (July 1965)</ref> On one noteworthy occasion, Loki's tactics are accidentally beneficial - although successful in using the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] to draw Thor into battle, it results in the formation of the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], of which Thor is a founding and longstanding member.<ref>''The Avengers'' #1 (Sept. 1963)</ref>

When Thor intervenes in the affairs of Earth, it has major repercussions.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #41-85 (Nov. 2001 - Dec. 2004)</ref> After reluctantly assuming the throne of Asgard, Thor sees mortals at their worst and reshapes the world in his image. A nightmarish future follows as Thor and the Asgardians conquer Earth and slay or imprison those who oppose them, including a young religious mutant called Davis; [[Zarrko|Zarrko the Tomorrow Man]]; [[Perrikus]] of the Dark Gods; the U.S. Government, and even his fellow Avengers. He marries Amora (the Enchantress), and has a son, [[Magni (Marvel Comics)|Magni]]. Wracked with guilt, Thor is eventually drawn into a final battle with [[Thor Girl|Tarene]] and a Desak-occupied Destroyer in a [[time travel]] bid to undo what he has done.

When the timeline is reset, Loki revives Surtur, who forges new uru hammers for Loki's Storm Giant followers and begins [[Ragnarök]], "the twilight of the gods". Thor learns that the Ragnarok cycle is the result of self-styled "gods to the gods" known as '''Those Who Sit Above in Shadow''', who feed on the cycle. Thor confronts the [[Norns (Marvel Comics)|Norns]] (Fates), breaking the Ragnarok cycle, and then enters a stasis, sleeping "the sleep of the gods." With his fate unknown to the Avengers, he is believed to be missing in action.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #85 (Dec. 2004)</ref>

Thor's hammer [[Mjolnir (Marvel Comics)|Mjolnir]] is found on Earth and put under U.S. Army protection. Sometime later, the supervillain [[Doctor Doom]] is escaping from Hell as Mjolnir falls through that dimensional plane, and tries unsuccessfully to claim the hammer, which eventually comes into the possession of a man carrying a bag with the initials "D.B".<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #536 (May 2006)</ref>
[[Image:Thor-01.jpg|thumb|right|The cover of ''Thor'' vol.3, #1 (Sep. 2007). Art by [[Olivier Coipel]].]]
Donald Blake, upon touching the hammer Mjolnir, is transported to the void of non-existence in which Thor now resides. Blake explains that when [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]] originally removed the Blake persona from Thor,<ref>''Thor'' #340 (Feb. 1984)</ref> Blake was consigned to the void that Thor now inhabits. When Thor entered that void, Blake was suddenly restored to being, in [[New York City]]. Blake convinces Thor to wield Mjolnir once more, return to Earth, and renew the dual identity with Blake. Blake also reveals that Thor's fellow Asgardians are actually not dead but hidden on Earth.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 3, #1 (Sep. 2007)</ref>

Thor rebuilds Asgard in [[Oklahoma]] (paying for the land with Asgardian treasure)<ref>''Thor'' vol. 3, #2 (Oct. 2007)</ref>, learns of the events of the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]<ref>''Civil War'' #1 - 7 (June 2006 - Jan. 2007)</ref> and is angered that [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] and others used his [[DNA]] to create a [[Ragnarok (comics)|Thor clone]] (which subsequently kills [[Bill Foster (comics)|Bill Foster]] in a battle between pro and anti-registration heroes).<ref>''Civil War'' #1 - 7 (July 2006 - Jan. 2007)</ref> Thor accepts an offer by Stark for Asgard to be considered a foreign [[diplomatic mission|embassy]], with [[diplomatic immunity]] granted to its inhabitants. Thor searches for his fellow Asgardians,<ref>''Thor'' vol. 3, #3 - 5 (Nov. 2007 - Jan. 2008)</ref> and restores each with the exception of [[Sif (Marvel Comics)|Sif]], who is trapped in an old woman's body and escapes Thor's notice. The Thunder God eventually searches for his father, and locates Odin in [[Valhalla]], waging constant battle with the fire demon [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]]. Odin advises his son that Thor must lead the Asgardians.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 3, #7 - 8 (Mar. - Apr. 2008)</ref>

In the limited series [[Secret Invasion]], the character rescues and heals ally [[Beta Ray Bill]], who after being temporarily given Mjolnir, aids Thor in a battle against an invading force of alien [[Skrull]]s.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Thor'' #1 (Aug. 2008)</ref> Thor also participates in the final battle against the Skrull forces, and is forced to sacrifice Avenger ally the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]].<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #8 (Nov. 2008)</ref>

Due to a deception by Loki, Thor battles and kills his grandfather '''Bor''', and is banished from Asgard. With Thor gone, Loki convinces his fellow Asgardians to transport Asgard to [[Latveria]], the home of [[Doctor Doom]].<ref>''Thor'' #600 (Feb. 2009)</ref> As Mjolnir is damaged in battle with Bor, Thor seeks out [[Doctor Strange]], who is only able to repair the hammer by transferring the Odinforce from the Thunder God to the hammer directly. The process binds the two in a [[symbiotic]] relationship. With the repaired hammer Thor is able to draw out the imprisoned Sif.<ref>''Thor'' #602 (Jun. 2009)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Like all Asgardians, Thor is not truly immortal but relies upon periodic consumption of the Golden Apples of [[Idunn (Marvel Comics)|Idunn]] to sustain his lifespan, which to date has lasted many [[millennia]]. Being the son of Odin and the elder goddess Gaea, the character is physically the strongest of the Norse gods, and has performed such feats as almost lifting the entire World Serpent<ref>''Thor'' #272 (June 1978)</ref> (stated to [[Jörmungandr|encircle]] the [[Earth]]),<ref>''Thor'' #379 (May 1987)</ref> and hurling the [[Odinsword]], an enormous mystical blade of incalculable weight, through a [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]].<ref>''Thor'' #300 Oct. 1980</ref> If pressed in battle, Thor is also capable of entering into a state known as the "[[berserker|Warrior's Madness]]" ("berserksgangr" in Norse), which will temporarily increase his strength tenfold.<ref>''Thor'' #166 (July 1969); ''Hulk''#440 (Apr. 1996); ''Thor'' #502 (Sep. 1996)</ref> The character also possesses virtually inexhaustible godly stamina, high resistance to physical injury such as rocket fire<ref>''Thor'' #309 (July 1981)</ref> and falls from orbital heights<ref>''Thor'' #324 (Oct. 1982)</ref> and superhuman speed, agility and reflexes. As the Norse god of Thunder, Thor can summon the elements of the storm ([[lightning]]; [[rain]]; [[wind]]; [[snow]]) and uses Mjolnir as a tool to focus this ability.

The character is a superb hand-to-hand combatant, and also skilled in armed combat, excelling in the use of the [[war hammer]], [[sword]] and [[mace]]. Thor possesses two items which assist him in combat: the enchanted Belt of Strength, and his mystical hammer Mjolnir. The first item doubles Thor's strength and endurance<ref>''Journey Into Mystery''  #91 (Apr. 1963)</ref> while the second is used to control his weather abilities; flight,<ref>On one occasion Thor uses a [[chariot]] drawn by two huge mystical [[goat]]s, Toothgnasher and Toothgrinder. See ''Thor'' #364 - 366 (Feb. - Apr. 1986)</ref> energy projection and absorption; dimensional apertures; matter manipulation and the most powerful of his offensives, the God Blast<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #25 (July 2003)</ref> and the Anti-Force.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #12 (June 1999)</ref>  

After Odin's death, Thor inherited his father's power, the Odinforce. Thor becomes capable of feats such as reconstructing the Earth's Moon,<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #57 (Feb. 2003)</ref> willing the Asgardian monster [[Mangog]] into nothingness<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #84 (Nov. 2004)</ref> and, by focusing his entire power into a hammer throw, decapitating a [[Desak]]-occupied [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]].<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #79 (July 2004)</ref> Thor also acquires mastery of the Runes, and a level of [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] that allows him to free Asgard from the eternal cycle of Ragnarok.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #83 - 85 (Oct. - Dec. 2004)</ref> 

As Donald Blake he is a highly trained and licensed physician and surgeon.<!-- Do not add any arbitrary statistics to this section without first achieving talk page consensus. This includes statistics from the OHOTMU and POWERGRID statistics from the Marvel.com/universe site. -->

When Mjolnir was damaged, the Odinforce was transferred by Doctor Strange from Thor to the hammer, as the power was required to restore it.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 3, #602 (June 2009)</ref>
