'''Flux''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is a gamma empowered soldier and is one of the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]'s enemies.

==Publication history==
Flux first appeared in ''Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 3 #17 and was created by [[Paul Jenkins (writer)|Paul Jenkins]] and [[Ron Garney]].

==Fictional character biography==
Private '''Benjamin Tibbits''', a soldier with unresolved mother issues, was a Private First Class in the United States Army. He, along with a platoon of soldiers, were exposed to a gamma bomb by [[John Ryker|General Ryker]], who wished to test its effects on humans. Tibbits was the sole survivor.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 3 #17</ref>

He was transformed into a Hulk-like creature with superhuman strength. The only differences were that Tibbits, nicknamed Flux, looked more misshapen, his forehead and joints significantly more pronounced, and his transformation was more erratic, parts of him sometimes transforming while the rest of him remained human. Convinced by General Ryker that Banner was responsible for his condition, and had sold gamma technology to the [[Iraqis]], Flux was sent after the Hulk, but the fight proved one-sided and Banner was able to talk him down. Benjamin Tibbits underwent psychiatric evaluation thanks to [[Doc Samson]], but he was subsequently recaptured and broken by Ryker. Regressed to a childlike mentality and vocabulary, apparently perceiving Ryker as his 'mommy', Flux was once again pitted against the Hulk, but the fight ended when [[Thunderbolt Ross|General Ross]] forced Ryker to stand down. Without Ryker's commands, Flux stopped fighting and broke down, reverting to Benny as he wept for his mother.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 3 #18-19</ref> 

Recently, Flux was revealed to be in [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.'s]] custody, who experimented on him. However, he was killed by Grey of the [[Gamma Corps]] during a raid on the A.I.M. base.<ref>Gamma Corps #1-5</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Like the Hulk, Flux's abilities stemmed from gamma irradiation. His abilities included superhuman strength, stamina and durability, and a regenerative healing factor. Unlike the Hulk, he was unable to become stronger as he became angrier. It is unknown whether he had the ability to jump vast distances like the Hulk.

==In other media==
===Video games===
* Flux appears in the [[Hulk (video game)|video game adaption]] to the [[Hulk (film)|Hulk]] movie voiced by [[Lee Tockar]]. Flux appears as one of the Hulk's opponents, challenging the Hulk when he attempts to destroy a force field generator keeping him confined in a military base. This Flux seems to share the backstory of the comic book version, but no reference is made to the specific details of his origin, although it's implied to be the same. After he is defeated, he is thrown into the force field generator and is severely injured. At the end of the game, he is seen in a base where he is being treated from the injuries he sustained under the care of General Ryker.
