'''Flux''' is a fictional villain in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe.  He is one of [[Hulk (comics)|the Hulk's]] enemies. 

==Fictional character biography==
His real name is '''Benny Tibbits''', a soldier with unresolved mother issues. He was a Private First Class. He, along with a platoon of soldiers, were exposed to a gamma bomb by [[John Ryker|General Ryker]], who wished to test its effects on humans. Tibbits was the sole survivor. He was transformed into a Hulk-like creature with superhuman strength. The only differences were that Flux looked more misshapen, his forehead and joints significantly more pronounced, and his transformation was more erratic, parts of him sometimes transforming while the rest of him remained human. Convinced by General Ryker that Banner was responsible for his condition, and had sold gamma technology to the Iraqis, Benny was sent after the Hulk, but the fight proved one-sided and Banner was able to talk Benny down. Benny underwent psychiatric evaluation thanks to [[Doc Samson]], but he was subsequently recaptured and broken by Ryker. Regressed to a child-like mentality and vocabulary, Flux was once again pitted against the Hulk, but the fight ended when [[Thunderbolt Ross|General Ross]] forced Ryker to stand down. Without Ryker's commands, Flux stopped fighting and broke down, reverting to Benny as he wept for his mommy. 

Recently, Flux was revealed to be in [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|AIM's]] custody, who experimented on him. However, he was killed by Grey of the [[Gamma Corps]] during a raid mission on the AIM base

== Powers and Abilities ==

==Other Media==

In a [[Hulk (video game)|2003 video game]], Flux appears as one of the Hulk's opponents, challenging the Hulk when the Hulk attempts to destroy a force field generator keeping him confined in a military base. This Flux seems to share the backstory of the comic book version, but no reference is made to the specific details of his origin. After he is defeated, he is thrown into the force field generator and is severely injured. At the end of the game he is seen in a base where he is being treated from the injuries he sustained.

He was voiced by [[Lee Tockar]].
