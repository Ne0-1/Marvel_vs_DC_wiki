'''Strong Guy''' is the alias of '''Guido Carosella''', a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Bill Sienkiewicz]] in ''[[New Mutants]]'' volume 1 #29 (July [[1985]]), and was reinvented as Strong Guy by [[Peter David]] and [[Larry Stroman]] in ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' (volume 1) #71 (October [[1991]]).

== Fictional character history ==
===Early life===
Born in [[Rhinebeck, New York]] to [[working class]] [[Italy|Italian]] parents, Guido Carosella gained a fortune in a settlement when his parents were killed by falling space debris. Skinny and shy, Guido's mutant powers were triggered in childhood when an incident with schoolyard bullies and being hit by a bus ended in his body becoming disproportionately large and over-muscled, separating the already withdrawn boy even further from his peers. He had the love and support of his aunt and uncle, who took him in after his parents' deaths. Guido coped with his emotional and physical pain caused by his mutation, by developing an outgoing "public face", rarely letting even those close to him see him in any discomfort.

During the incident with the bus, another boy, Charlie Ronalds, was hurt by Guido's flailing. Due to luck, Charlie survived with only a slight limp. He would later become the villainous [[Charon (Marvel Comics)|Charon]].<ref>''X-Factor'' Annual #8, 1993</ref>

===Lila Cheney and Muir Island===
After losing much of his fortune, Guido began to take on jobs that would allow him to maintain his luxurious lifestyle. This leads to Guido becoming the long-time [[roadie]] and [[Doorman|bouncer]] for the mutant musician [[Lila Cheney]]. While working as a bodyguard for Lila, he met [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] and [[Magik (comics)|Magik]] of the [[New Mutants]].<ref>''New Mutants'' #29</ref> He later found [[Dazzler]] near Lila Cheney's Malibu house, and helped rescue Dazzler from drowning.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #259-260</ref> He then found the injured Lila Cheney when she teleported back to Malibu, and accompanied Cheney to seek help from the [[X-Men]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #270, 273-274</ref> Guido was later among the mutants living on [[Muir Island]] who were mentally controlled by the [[telepathy|telepath]] [[Shadow King]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #278</ref> In order to satiate his bloodlust, the Shadow King encouraged arena fighting amongst the Muir Island personnel. Guido receives a serious beating at the hands of Rogue.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #278</ref> After the Shadow King was defeated, several of the Muir Island mutants, with the help of [[Val Cooper]], were recruited to form a new X-Factor team..<ref>''X-Factor'' (v1) #70</ref>

===X-Factor===
Guido joined the new X-Factor team, a group now working as government operatives. His teammates included many notable former X-Men supporting characters, including [[Havok (X-Men)|Havok]], [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]], [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]] and [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]]. Guido picked up the "Strong Guy" name from a joke he made at an X-Factor [[press conference]] when the press demanded to know his codename.<ref>''X-Factor'' #71-72</ref>

One of the first villains the team faced was [[Mister Sinister]] and his lackeys, the [[Nasty Boys]]. Sinister wished to discredit mutant-kind and used X-Factor to do so. One of Sinister's behind-the-scenes allies was a power-hungry senator with the power to cause bad luck. Strong Guy was manipulated into destroying the [[Washington Monument]] while fighting [[Slab (comics)|Slab]], one of the Nasty Boys. The senator, who was after the entirety of the X-Factor team, was later slain by Mr. Sinister himself.<ref>''X-Factor'' Vol 1. #74-75</ref> With X-Factor, he next aided the American-supported Trans-Sabal government in a war against rebels, and fought the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]].<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #290-292; ''X-Factor'' #76</ref> With X-Factor, he also clashed with the [[Mutant Liberation Front]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #77-78</ref> With X-Factor, he then fought [[Cyber (comics)|Cyber]] and [[Hell's Belles]]; he was poisoned by Cyber, but recovered.<ref>''X-Factor'' #80-81</ref> With X-Factor, he also fought the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #82</ref>

During his time on the team there was a blossoming relationship with a powerful [[Genosha]]n mutant (not [[Mutate (comics)|mutate]]) and political dissident named Jo Beth. He even visited her grandmother at her calm, suburban home on the island of [[Genosha]].<ref>"X-Factor" Vol. 1 #89</ref> She takes a shine to him instantly.

Strong Guy participated in the cosmic incidents known as the [[Infinity War]], in the Earth super heroes' war against the [[Magus (comics)|Magus]]. During the 'War',<ref name=InfinityWar1-6>''Infinity War'' #1–6</ref> he and the other superheroes survived a bomb attack on the [[Fantastic Four]] headquarters, thanks to the [[Invisible Woman]]. Strong Guy was specifically chosen to be one of the heroes to mystically travel the dimensions. He first participated in a fight with the alien [[Infinity Watch]], holding up against such cosmic powerhouses as [[Drax the Destroyer]]. He later played a vital part in the final battle against the villain's doppelganger's hordes, though this was a distraction so other forces could go in and defeat the villain.<ref name=InfinityWar1-6 />

Strong Guy was one of the many heroes sucked into the after-effects of the Infinity War. He was one of many free-thinking heroes who traveled to an alternate Earth to regain their brainwashed friends and defeat the plans of the cosmic powered ''Goddess''. He teamed up with Firestar from the [[New Warriors]], who was soon taken out by the brainwashed duo of [[Puck (comics)|Puck]] and [[Spider-Man]]. Strong Guy defeated Spider-Man in a swift, tree-smashing battle, despite being blinded by webbing to the face. [[Doctor Strange]], also brainwashed, restrained Strong Guy in a bubble of mystic force, where he stayed while events played out.<ref>''[[Infinity Crusade]]'' #1–6</ref>

Guido suffered a deep depression after being poisoned by [[Cyber (comics)|Cyber]], the leader of the mercenary group [[Hell's Belles]]. While at a governmental laboratory where a cure had been developed, Havok seemingly drank a sample of the poison himself, in order to show Strong Guy that he was with him. This helped boost Strong Guy's morale, though unknown to him, Havok had consumed simple water.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

Strong Guy later participated in the battle that took down the Hell's Belles, though Cyber himself escaped after colliding with a subway train.{{Issue|date=May 2009}} Another subway train incident turned out much worse, as Strong Guy investigated a train crash where a small dog was the only survivor. Inevitably, the carnage deeply affected his morale.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

Guido's old friend, the cosmic teleporter Lila Cheney, showed up again because she missed him. She forcibly teleported Guido naked from his shower to alien locales in an attempt to persuade him to resume his former role as a roadie/bodyguard. He managed to convince her that he enjoys his life back in X-Factor, where she reluctantly returned him.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

Over his time with X-Factor, Guido develops a deep friendship with the lycanthrope [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]] (Rahne Sinclair). They go on a road trip with the mutant [[Random (comics)|Random]], where Guido shows Rahne his hometown friends.{{Issue|date=May 2009}} Guido personally escorts Wolfsbane to [[Muir Island]] when she needs specific medical attention.{{Issue|date=May 2009}} His other best friend on the team, [[Multiple Man]], seemingly perishes in an attempt to remove the [[Legacy Virus]] from his body.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

Strong Guy remains a member of X-Factor until an incident in the South Seas island nation of [[Madripoor]]. Again involved with Lila Cheney, the team becomes trapped in a confrontation between her and the alien race, the [[K'Lanti]]. Lila had stolen an object of great value, called the Harmonium, during the midst of political chaos. The aliens, after destroying a city block, disperse diamond shaped bombs throughout the city. Despite the neutralization of the bombs and the return of their object, the aliens leave behind one last explosive. Guido absorbs the energy of its explosion. Despite releasing some of the energy with powerful punches, he suffers a powerful [[heart attack]].{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

Guido spends much time in [[suspended animation]], until the return of his seemingly-dead friend the [[Multiple Man]], Jaime Madrox. Not fully understanding the situation, Madrox frees Guido, who continues to suffer.{{Issue|date=May 2009}} [[Forge (comics)|Forge]] creates a device to heal Guido.{{Issue|date=May 2009}} Afterward he chooses to accompany Lila and her band in their travels instead of rejoining the increasingly fractious X-Factor team.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

Guido's adventures are highlighted in a one-shot comic book, ''Strong Guy Reborn'' #1.  He becomes involved in a property dispute between warring alien races, both of whom wish to control a small, barren moon. This dispute is settled when the moon is destroyed during an exchange of weapons on both sides.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

===Storm: The Arena===
Strong Guy was later seen in [[Tokyo]] as a member of a mutant fighting club called the Arena, in which the mutant fighters were being secretly enslaved by other mutants. He helped [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] and [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]] in taking down the enslavers.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

===X-Factor Investigations===
Strong Guy recently moved to [[New York City]] to become the [[enforcer]] for his friend [[Multiple Man|Madrox]]'s detective agency, [[X-Factor Investigations]], thus rejoining many of his former teammates from the government-sponsored incarnation of X-Factor. The team included Wolfsbane, [[Rictor (comics)|Rictor]], [[Siryn]] and [[M (comics)|Monet]] at first.<ref>"X-Factor" Volume 2. #1</ref>

Guido is assigned to protect a former employee of Singularity Investigations, Henry Buchanan. Henry has proof of the illegal activities of his former company. However, Guido instead kills the man and then called Singularity CEO [[Damian Tryp]], revealing he was working as a mole inside X-Factor.<ref>"X-Factor" Volume 2 #10</ref>.

Guido tried to tell the team that the man had vanished on him but [[Wolfsbane]] smells his blood on Guido's hands and a psychic scan by [[M (comics)|Monet]] reveals the truth. It seemed Guido had been subjected to [[hypnotic]] conditioning by Tryp to turn him into a mole (which explained his rougher attitude and some inconsistencies in his personality).

A visit with Henry's widow <ref> "X-Factor" Volume 2 #14</ref> did not go as expected; instead of reacting angrily, Alix Buchanan understood the circumstances in which Guido had acted, and forgave him. By the end of the issue they had found solace together in their mutual grief from Henry's death.

Some time later, Valerie Cooper contacts Guido and offered him a job as [[sheriff]] of Mutant Town, the affected area in New York where large amounts of former mutants live. In Guido informs Jamie Madrox that he will be taking the job<ref>"X-Factor" Volume 2 #24</ref>, giving Jamie his [[two weeks notice]]. This likely happens after the events of ''World War Hulk''.

===World War Hulk===
In ''[[World War Hulk: X-Men]]'', Strong Guy battled the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], who had paused his rampage to question Professor X about his role in the [[Illuminati (Marvel Comics)|Illuminati]]. In this fight he was forced retreat by the possibility that Guido may damage his heart by absorbing the energy of Hulk's punch.{{Issue|date=October 2009}}

===Divided We Stand===
Strong Guy breaks up a fight between Rictor and a prostitute in Mutant Town who resembles Layla Miller.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

Guido also confesses to Madrox that Val Cooper's offer to be sheriff of Mutant Town has been rescinded because of the sheer lack of mutants.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

==Powers and abilities==
Strong Guy possesses superhuman strength which he can increase by absorbing [[kinetic energy]] and use it to enhance his physical strength to an unmeasured limit. However, he cannot store the energy he absorbs for very long; as a rule he must physically expend the energy within 90 seconds to prevent it from permanently distorting his body. He is in constant pain from the existing distortion, although he hides it well, traditionally playing the role of team comedian to distract himself.  Guido also possesses superhuman stamina and durability.

An unusual percentage of his body mass is stored in the upper half of his body, causing him to appear top-heavy and thus very imposing.  Strong Guy's powers first appeared after being beaten by bullies and hit by a bus; unable to expel the energy, his body was permanently warped.{{Issue|date=May 2009}} Strong Guy's maximum strength level is such that he has sufficient power to move the [[Blob (comics)|Blob]],<ref>''X-Factor'' vol.1, #107</ref> or briefly stand toe to toe with the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], although the latter's rage enhanced strength was so powerful that the energy of channeling merely one blow, afterwards put Strong Guy in danger of a heart attack.<ref>''World War Hulk: X-Men'' #3</ref> Guido is formidable at "street fighting"-style hand-to-hand combat.

Guido has a gifted intellect, and is a talented musical comedy actor and stand-up comedian. He has earned a Bachelor of Arts in drama from New York University.

Strong Guy is [[nearsighted]] and wears corrective "bottlecap" lenses.

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the [[Age of Apocalypse]] time line,<ref>''[[Gambit & the X-Ternals]]'' #1–4</ref> Strong Guy was still Lila Cheney's bodyguard, but he was much more obsessive about her. He was jealous, almost to the point of insanity, of [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] because he and Cheney were lovers. Strong Guy was captured by Apocalypse's Infinites and had a bomb implanted in his skull. To save his own life, he betrayed the X-Men and even kidnapped [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] and [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]'s infant son.

==Other media==
Strong Guy appears in the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' animated TV series episode "Cold Comfort". He is seen as a member of the X-Factor team led by [[Forge (comics)|Forge]].
