'''Strong Guy''' (real name '''Guido Carosella''') is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[mutant (comics)|mutant]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. Guido was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Bill Sienkiewicz]] in ''[[New Mutants]]'' volume 1 #29, and was reinvented as Strong Guy by [[Peter David]] and [[Larry Stroman]] in ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' (volume 1) #71 (July 1985).

== Fictional character history ==
Born in Rhineback, New York, to [[Italy|Italian]] parents, who tried to teach their son the value of a dollar, Guido Carosella showed this by earning a fortune in a settlement when his parents were killed.  Skinny and shy, Guido's mutant powers were triggered in childhood when an incident with schoolyard bullies ended in his body becoming disproportionally large and overmuscled, separating the already withdrawn boy even further from his peers.  Luckily, he had the love and support of his aunt and uncle, who had taken him in after his parents' deaths, and Guido coped with his pain, both emotional and the physical pain generated by his transformed body, by developing an outgoing "public face", rarely letting even those close to him see him in any discomfort.

After losing much of his fortune, he began to take on jobs that would allow him to maintain his luxurious lifestyle. This led to Guido becoming the long-time [[roadie]] and [[Doorman|bouncer]] for the mutant musician [[Lila Cheney]]. He was later among the mutants living on [[Muir Island]] who were mentally controlled by the [[telepathy|telepath]] [[Shadow King]]. After the Shadow King was defeated, several of the Muir Island mutants were incorporated into the new X-Factor team. Guido picked up the "Strong Guy" name from a joke he made at an X-Factor [[press conference]] when the press demanded to know his codename. He remained a member of X-Factor until his body was overloaded with kinetic energy while saving Lila Cheney and his teammates from an alien bomb. Guido was placed in suspended animation, and after he healed and was revived, he chose to accompany Lila and her band in their travels instead of rejoining the increasingly fractious X-Factor team.

Strong Guy was later seen in [[Tokyo]] as a member of a mutant fighting club called the Arena, in which the mutant fighters were being enslaved by other mutants. He helped [[Storm (comics)|Storm]] and [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]] in taking down the enslavers.

Strong Guy recently moved to [[New York City]] to become the [[enforcer]] for his friend [[Multiple Man|Madrox]]'s detective agency, [[X-Factor Investigations]], thus rejoining many of his former teammates from the government-sponsored incarnation of [[X-Factor]].

In ''X-Factor'' #10, Guido was assigned to protect a former employee of Singularity Investigations who had proof of their illegal activities. However, Guido instead killed the man and then called Singularity CEO [[Damian Tryp]], revealing he was working as a mole inside X-Factor.

Guido tried to tell the team that the man had vanished on him but [[Wolfsbane]] smelled his blood on Guido's hands and a psychic scan by Monet revealed the truth. It seemd Guido had been subjected to hypnotic conditioning by Tryp to turn him into a mole (which explained his rougher attitude and some inconsistencies in his personality).

==Age of Apocalypse==
In the [[Age Of Apocalypse|Age of Apocalypse]], Strong Guy was still Lila Cheney's body guard, but much more obsessively. He was jealous, almost to the point of insanity, of [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] because he and Cheney were lovers. Strong Guy was captured by Apocalypse's Infinites and had a bomb implanted in his skull. To save his own life, he betrayed the X-Men and even kidnapped [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] and [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]'s infant son. It can be presumed that Rogue killed Strong Guy in an act of vengeance due to the kidnapping of her child.

==Powers and abilities==
Strong Guy has the mutant ability to absorb [[kinetic energy]] and use it to enhance his physical strength up to an unmeasured limit. However, he cannot store the energy he absorbs for very long; as a rule he must expend it within 90 seconds to prevent the enormous amounts of energy from permanently distorting his body. He is in constant pain from the existing distortion, although he hides it well, traditionally playing the role of team comedian to distract himself.

An unusual percentage of his body mass is stored in the upper half of his body, causing him to appear top-heavy and thus very imposing.  Strong Guy's powers first appeared after being hit by a bus; unable to expel the energy, his body was permanently warped. Strong Guy's maximum strength level is such that he has sufficient strength to take on the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], and he is formidable at "street fighting"-style hand-to-hand combat.

Strong Guy is [[nearsighted]] and wears corrective "bottlecap" lenses. He is a multi-talented actor and [[stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]]. He works as a bodyguard for the mutant rock star Lila Cheney when not adventuring alongside other mutant heroes.

==In other media==
Strong Guy appears in the [[X-Men (TV series)|''X-Men'' animated series]] episode "Cold Comfort" as a member of the X-Factor team led by [[Forge (comics)|Forge]].
