'''Strong Guy''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]] who is a [[mutant]] and a former member of the crimefighting force [[X-Factor]]. Born to [[Italy|Italian]] parents, his real name is Guido Carosella. He picked up the "Strong Guy" name from a crack he made at an [[X-Factor]] press conference, after they demanded to know his codename.

==Current Events==

Recently, he was seen in [[Tokyo]] as a member of a mutant fighting club called the '''Arena'''.  Truthfully, the mutant fighters were being enslaved by other mutants.  Strong Guy helped [[Storm (comics)|Storm]] and [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]] in taking down the slavers and presumably went from there to [[New York]] to join his friend [Multiple Man]]'s detective agency as his [[enforcer]] and presumably still works there.

==Powers and abilities==

Strong Guy has the [[mutant]] ability to absorb kinetic energy and use it to enhance his physical strength up to an unmeasured limit. However, he cannot store the energy he absorbs for very long; as a rule he must expend it within ninety seconds to prevent the enormous amounts of energy from permanently distorting his body. He is in constant pain from the existing distortion, although he hides it well, traditionally playing the role of team comedian to distract himself.

An unusual percentage of his body mass is stored in the upper half of his body, causing him to appear top-heavy and thus very imposing. Strong Guy's maximum strength level is such that he has sufficient strength to take on [[The Incredible Hulk]], and he is formidable at "street fighting"-type hand-to-hand combat.

Strong Guy is near-sighted and wears corrective "bottlecap" lenses. He is a multi-talented actor and stand-up comedian, and he works as a bodyguard for the mutant rock star [[Lila Cheney (comics)|Lila Cheney]] when not adventuring alongside other mutant heroes.

==Other Media==
Strong Guy appears in the ''[[X-Men: The Animated Series]]'' episode "Cold Comfort" as a member of the X-Factor led by the modern day [[Forge (comics)|Forge]].
