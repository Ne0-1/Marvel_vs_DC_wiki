'''Strong Guy''' is the name of a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]] who is a [[mutant]] and a member of the crimefighting force [[X-Factor]]. Born to Italian parents, his real name is Guido Carosella. Strong Guy has the ability to absorb kinetic energy and use it to enhance his physical strength up to an unmeasured limit. However, he cannot store the energy he absorbs for very long; as a rule he must expend it within ninety seconds to prevent the enormous amounts of energy from permanently distorting his body.  An unusual percentage of his body mass is stored in the upper half of his body, causing him to appear top-heavy and thus very imposing. Strong Guy's maximum strength level is such that he has sufficent strength to take on [[The Incredible Hulk]], and he is formidable at "street fighting"-type hand-to-hand combat.

Strong Guy is near-sighted and wears corrective lenses. He is a multi-talented actor and stand-up comedian, and he worked as a bodyguard for the mutant rock star [[Lila Cheney]] before joining X-Factor.
