'''Obnoxio the Clown''' was the mascot of the Marvel Comics humor magazine [[Crazy (magazine)]]. He was portrayed as a slovenly, cigar-puffing middle-aged man in a perpetually torn and dirty clown suit, with a dispeptic and cynical attitude. He also appeared once as a minor villain and unlikely ally who starred in a one-shot [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] [[comic book]] against the [[X-Men]] in the 1980s.
