'''Janus''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[comic-book]] character in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].

Janus was the son of [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]] and his wife Domini, conceived through mystical means via a spell of Anton Lupeski.  Dracula sired this child as part of a plan to use the Church of Satan to fulfill his plans for world domination.  The baby was shot and killed by Lupeski who was actually shooting at Dracula.  Domini resurrected Janus by merging him with a possessing spirit, a seeming golden angel, returning him to life as an adult.  Janus became Draculaâ€™s opponent however.

When [[Quincy Harker]] had temporarily destroyed Dracula, the possessing golden angel abandoned Janus' body.  Janus immediately returned to infant form, as a living baby. Years later, he was kidnapped at the order of the vampire lord [[Varnae]].<ref>''[[Nightstalkers (comics)|Nightstalkers]]'' #16-18 (Feb.-April 1994)</ref>
