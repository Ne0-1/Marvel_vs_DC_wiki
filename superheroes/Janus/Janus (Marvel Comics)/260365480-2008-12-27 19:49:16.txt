==Fictional character biography==
The Golden Angel was a possessing spirit who claimed to be an angel, a messenger and warrior of God. This angel was revealed to have appeared to [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]] and thwarted his will in the past. As an angel, he battled Dracula and predicted his death, although he was then slain by Dracula.<ref>''Tomb of Dracula'' Vol. 1 #52</ref>

Dracula and his wife Domini later conceived through mystical means via a spell of Anton Lupeski.  An infant was born to them in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], and they named this baby Janus.  Dracula sired this child as part of a plan to use the Church of Satan to fulfill his plans for world domination.<ref>''Tomb of Dracula'' Vol. 1 #54</ref>  The baby was accidentally shot and killed by Lupeski during an attack by [[Quincy Harker]], [[Rachel van Helsing]], [[Frank Drake (comics)|Frank Drake]], and [[Harold H. Harold]] on Dracula.<ref>''Tomb of Dracula'' Vol. 1 #59</ref>  Domini resurrected Janus by merging him with the same seeming golden angel Dracula had encountered years earlier, returning Janus to life as an adult.<ref>''Tomb of Dracula'' Vol. 1 #61</ref>  Janus became Dracula's opponent however, and battled Dracula to prevent his victims from becoming vampires.<ref>''Tomb of Dracula'' Vol. 1 #62</ref> Alongside Dracula, Frank Drake, and [[Topaz (Marvel Comics)|Topaz]], Janus also battled a demonic creature.<ref>''Tomb of Dracula'' Vol. 1 #63</ref>
