The '''Flash''' ('''Wally West''') is a [[fiction]]al [[Character (arts)|character]], a [[superhero]] that appears in [[comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. He is the first '''[[Kid Flash]]''' and the third [[Flash (comics)|Flash]].<ref name="dc-ency">{{Cite book | last=Jimenez | first=Phil | author-link=Phil Jimenez | contribution=The Flash | editor-last=Dougall | editor-first=Alastair | title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages=124–127 | publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] | location=New York | year=2008 | isbn=0-7566-4119-5 | oclc=213309017}}</ref>

On May 6, 2011, [[IGN]] ranked Wally West #8 on their list of the "Top 100 Super Heroes of All Time", stating that "Wally has also been a member of the Teen Titans, New Teen Titans and the Justice League. 

==History==
===Kid Flash===
[[Image:Kid Flash Wally.jpg|thumb|125px|left|Wally as Kid Flash. Art by [[George Pérez]].]]
Wally West was created by [[John Broome (writer)|John Broome]] and [[Carmine Infantino]] and introduced in ''[[The Flash (comic book)|The Flash]]'' #110 (1959). The character was the nephew of the existing Flash character's girlfriend and later wife, [[Iris West Allen|Iris West]]. During a visit to the [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]] [[police]] laboratory where [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] worked, the freak accident that gave Allen his powers repeated itself, bathing West in electrically-charged chemicals. Now possessing the same powers as the Flash, West donned a smaller sized copy of Barry Allen's Flash outfit and became the young crimefighter '''Kid Flash'''. Wally had a strained relationship with his own parents and often looked to his beloved aunt and uncle for moral support and guidance. 

This costume was later altered (in ''The Flash'' #135 [1963]) to one that would make him more visually distinctive. The original red was replaced with a costume that was primarily yellow with red leggings, gloves, and ear-pieces.

In addition to his appearances within the ''[[The Flash (comic book)|Flash]]'' title, the character was used as a member of the newly created [[Teen Titans]], where he became friends with [[Dick Grayson]], then known as Robin, later known as Nightwing.<ref name="dc-ency"/> Sometime later, Wally contracted a mysterious disease: the more he used his speed powers, the faster his body would die. Wally subsequently retired from his hero role.

In 2010, West reprised his role as Kid Flash in the [[Cartoon Network]] television series [[Young Justice]].

===The Flash===
During the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]], Barry gave his life to save the Earth when destroying the [[antimatter]] cannon that was aimed at Earth.<ref>''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' #7 (October 1985)</ref> Initially unaware of this, Wally was coaxed by [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]] into assisting the heroes against the [[Anti-Monitor]]'s forces. During the final battle with the Anti-Monitor, Wally was struck by a blast of anti-matter energy, which put his disease into remission. In the aftermath of the conflict, Wally took on his fallen mentor's costume and identity.<ref name="Crisis 12">''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' #12 (March 1986)</ref>

The decision by DC Comics' editorial staff to radically change their fictional universe saw a number of changes to the status quo of the character. Wally West became a less powerful new Flash than his predecessor.<ref name="dc-ency"/> For example, instead of being able to reach the speed of light, he could run just faster than that of sound.<ref name="Crisis 12"/> Also, the character had to eat vast quantities of food to maintain his metabolism.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer=[[Mike Baron|Baron, Mike]] | Penciller=[[Jackson Guice|Guice, Jackson]] | Inker=Mahlstedt, Larry | Story=Flash | Title=Flash | Volume=2 | Issue=1 | Date=June 1987 | Publisher=DC Comics | Page=1}}</ref>

[[Image:Wallyflash1.png|thumb|right|150px|''Flash'' vol. 2, #1 (June 1987). Wally West holds his first title as the Modern Age Flash. Art by [[Jackson Guice]].]]

Those changes were quickly followed up and 1987 saw the publication of a new ''[[The Flash (comic book)|Flash]]'' comic, initially written by [[Mike Baron]]. These stories focused not only on the Flash's superhero exploits, but the state of Wally's wealth. West won a [[lottery]],<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer=Baron, Mike | Penciller=Guice, Jackson | Inker=Mahlstedt, Larry | Story=Flash | Title=Flash | Volume=2 | Issue=1 | Date=June 1987 | Publisher=DC Comics | Page=20 | Panel=5}}</ref> bought a large mansion,<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer=Baron, Mike | Penciller=Guice, Jackson | Inker=Mahlstedt, Larry | Story=Heart... of Stone! | Title=Flash | Volume=2 | Issue=2 | Date=July 1987 | Publisher=DC Comics | Page=22 | Panel=3}}</ref> and became something of a [[wikt:playboy|playboy]]. The character's finances and luck continued to ebb and wane until ''Flash'' vol. 2, #62, when his playboy ways ended and his fortunes stabilized.

The 1990s also saw further modifications to the look of the character, with a modified uniform appearing in 1991.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer=Messner-Loebs, William | Penciller=LaRocque, Greg | Inker=Marzan, Jose, Jr. | Story=The Fastest Man... Alive! | Title=Flash | Volume=2 | Issue=50 | Date=May 1991 | Publisher=DC Comics | Page=22 | Panel=3}}</ref> This modified costume altered the visual appearance of the traditional Flash costume, with a belt made of two connecting lightning bolts meeting in a "V" at the front (where Allen's costume had a single bolt in a horizontal band), removal of the wings from the top of his boots, a change in the material of his costume, and opaque lenses added to the eyes of his cowl. This modified design utilized elements of the costume designed by artist [[Dave Stevens]] for the live action television series, ''[[The Flash (TV series)|The Flash]]''.

A difficult encounter with a particularly vicious foe, the first [[Reverse-Flash]] (Eobard Thawne), also served to increase the speed of the character, forcing him to push past a psychological block he had placed on his powers. To prevent himself from truly "replacing" Barry, Wally had subconsciously limited his speed so that he could never become his mentor's equal, but Thawne's bragging that he would become the true Flash forced Wally past this block as he feared Thawne replacing Barry more than he feared himself doing so.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer=[[Mark Waid|Waid, Mark]] | Penciller=LaRocque, Greg | Inker=Richardson, Roy | Story=The Once and Future Flash | Title=Flash | Volume=2 | Issue=79 | Date=August 1993 | Publisher=DC Comics | Page= | Panel=3}}</ref> After this encounter he was Barry Allen's equal in speed, and eventually became even faster. Though he still had not been able to recover Barry's vibrational/phasing abilities (he could vibrate through objects but they would explode instead) he gained several new powers that Barry never had. He was able to share/steal speed, use his speed to kinetically upgrade his attacks, and super heal others.

Writer [[Mark Waid]] expanded on the character's powers thematically and further redefined the character by introducing the [[Speed Force]], an energy source that served as a pseudo-scientific explanation for his powers and that of other fictional [[speedster (fiction)|speedsters]] within the [[DC Universe]]. Using this concept as a basis, the character's ability to tap into the Speed Force was used to expand his abilities. The character was now able to lend speed to other objects and people<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer=Waid, Mark | Penciller=Larroca, Salvador | Inker=Marzan, Jose, Jr. | Story=Terminal Velocity | Title=Flash | Volume=2 | Issue=95–100 | Date=November 1994 – April 1995}}</ref><ref name="Flash 101">{{Cite comic | Writer=Waid, Mark | Penciller=Jimenez, Oscar | Inker=Marzan, Jose, Jr. | Story=Going the Distance | Title=The Flash | Volume=2 | Issue=101 | Date=May 1995}}</ref> and create a costume directly out of Speed Force energy. Traditional powers such as the ability to vibrate through solid objects were also restored.

The 2000s saw writer [[Geoff Johns]] revitalize the character by introducing new versions of characters such as [[Zoom (comics)|Zoom]]; making significant use of the [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues]]; and marrying the character to longtime girlfriend [[Linda Park (comics)|Linda Park]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=118446 | title=Updated: ''All Flash'' #1 | work=[[Newsarama]] | date=June 27, 2007 | accessdate=2011-01-16}}</ref>

[[Image:Flash_III.jpg|left|120px|thumb|Wally's new costume. Art by [[Ethan Van Sciver]].]]

After Johns left the series, sales dropped significantly{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} and DC editorial decided that it was time for the status quo to change once more. Using the miniseries ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' as a narrative device, the character of Wally West and his family were seen leaving for an alternative reality. This allowed the character [[Bart Allen]] to become the fourth Flash and headline a relaunched third volume of the title, called ''The Flash: The Fastest Man Alive''.

The critical reaction to this new version of the character was mixed and the character was killed off in the final issue of the short-lived third volume.<ref name="dc-ency"/> It was decided that Wally West should return; and the [[Justice League|JLA]]/[[Justice Society of America|JSA]] story "[[The Lightning Saga]]" was used to return the character to Earth along with his wife and children, who appear to have aged several years.

The character next appeared in ''All Flash'' #1 (2007), seeking vengeance on those who had killed Bart Allen. This was followed by ''[[The Flash (comic book)|The Flash]]'' vol. 2, which resumed publication after the long hiatus with issue #231 (October 2007). The series found the character struggling with trying to raise his two super-powered twins, plagued by accelerated growth and their inexperience in the heroic game, a task made more difficult by Wally's unemployment, his inability to keep a steady job, and the mistrust of the League for his decision to bring two children into the fold. The series was canceled with issue #247 (February 2009).

In ''[[Final Crisis]]'', the character was reunited with [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]], who had returned to life.

===The Flash: Rebirth===
{{Main|The Flash: Rebirth}}
Interviews with ''[[The Flash: Rebirth]]'' artist [[Ethan Van Sciver]] revealed that the character would adopt a newly-designed costume in the limited series that reintroduces Barry Allen as the Flash.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=17542 | title=CCI Spotlight: Ethan Van Sciver | work=[[Comic Book Resources]] | date=July 31, 2008 | accessdate=2011-01-16}}</ref> The new costume is heavily inspired by the original changes made to the suit in ''Flash'' vol. 2, #50 (cowl lenses, "wingless" boots, the belt-line V-shape, and the darker red color of the suit), which were slipping in and out of usage when the character was drawn by different artists. Wally's costume has also been given a straight cowl which cuts off at the bottom of the nose, similar to [[Batman]]'s. Wally has also gained a new symbol identical to the symbol worn by his animated counterpart in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' animated series, to further distinguish Wally from Barry Allen.
After the end of "The Flash: Rebirth", Barry Allen became the star of a new ongoing "Flash" series, with Wally West making only one, out-of-costume appearance during the series' 12-issue run.<ref>http://speedforce.org/2011/07/uniqueness-of-barry-allen/</ref>.

===Flashpoint and The New 52===
{{Main|Flashpoint (comics)}}
Following the events of Flashpoint, the timeline for the DC Universe has been rewritten.  Barry Allen has never been married to Iris West, and it would appear that Wally West's time as Kid Flash/The Flash no longer occurred.  When asked about Wally's whereabouts, DC creators have had no comment, and Dan DiDio has stated that the Wally is currently benched.  Current Flash writers Francis Manapul and Brian Buccellato, however, have said they have a proposal for Wally on Didio's desk.

==Powers and abilities==
{{In-universe|section|date=October 2009}}
Wally's primary superpower is his ability to be able to control the speed of which his body vibrates and to move at super speed, which he uses primarily to run at super-human velocities. This super speed is derived from his connection to the Speed Force: a vaguely defined extra-dimensional energy force from which most speedster heroes draw their powers (while the original Flash, Jay Garrick, can draw upon the Speed Force, Jay is one of the few speedsters that is a [[metahuman]] first, allowing him to keep a degree of super speed even when the Speed Force was cut off from the others).

While many hypothesize that the Speed Force is to an extent sentient, most utilize it primarily as just a tool, drawing upon it and using it when necessary; however, [[Max Mercury]], a veteran speedster, has been able to commune and communicate with it, making it his life's goal to unlocking its secrets with many calling him the "Zen Master of the Speed Force". The Speed Force serves as the ultimate measure of velocity in the DC Universe. They are often referred to in terms of barriers: Sound Barrier, Light Barrier, Time Barrier, Dimensional Barrier, and finally the Speed Force Barrier.

While most to all speedsters can make a connection and draw upon this force, West mainlines power from the Speed Force itself and cannot be cut off from the source, unlike the others (as of 2009, Barry Allen has recently departed from his extended time within the Speed Force itself essentially "coming back to life" and while it is not known whether he shares the unbreakable connection to the Speed Force that Wally does, it stands to reason that he might). This connection to the Speed Force allows him additional abilities than other speedsters such as lending and taking speed (which allows others to temporarily utilize the Speed Force in different ways ranging from becoming speedsters themselves to bolstering others metabolisms and healing abilities, allowing them to recover from injuries in a fraction of the normal time), as well as absorbing kinetic energy in a less direct manner; he once absorbed the kinetic energy of the entire planet Earth while standing at the North Pole when his teammates were forced to move the planet to prevent possible earthquakes. Wally has also found a way to create a costume out of pure Speed Force energy, unlike other speedsters who use conventional costumes.

Like all Flashes, Wally is surrounded by a protective aura that allows him to resist the heat created by the friction of moving at super speed as well as other environmental consequences of moving at such velocities. It is not known how Wally is able to circumvent the damage moving at such great speeds would normally have on the environment, but it has been hypothesized that his protective aura allows him to "side step" such environmental consequences. Because of his powers and connection to the Speed Force, he can run at varying speeds for extended periods of time without needing rest or causing damage to his body. It is his connection to the Speed Force that constantly rejuvenates him while running making it so he does not literally feed upon his own body to generate the energy for super speed. Even so, as a consequence of his sped up metabolism, he finds it necessary to eat often and in great quantities to help supply the chemical energy needed to run like he does.

Using his abilities, Wally can run at such speed that he can run on water, create powerful vortices with his arms or body, and vibrate at such speeds that he becomes invisible to the naked eye. Wally can also match the vibrational constant of solid objects and vibrate through them, passing his molecules through the spaces in between the atoms and molecules of the matter he's vibrating through. Unlike other speedsters, once he became one with the Speed Force some of his abilities changed, one of which is that the objects Wally is vibrating though become atomically unstable and explode a second or two later. While this has its drawbacks, Wally now tends to use this offensively in battle.

Wally can also use his speed in a variety of clever ways in combat from creating a powerful whirlwind/tornado lifting and trapping his foe (which, if he chooses, can be used to knock his opponent out by robbing them of their oxygen supply), to binding and trapping his foes with whatever's lying around before they have a chance to react, to pummeling them with hundreds of super speed punches in a few seconds. Like many of the more powerful speedsters, he is able to run at such speeds where he is able to travel through time, although being able to control and fine tune his temporal destinations is quote "extremely tricky".

Wally is the fastest of all the Flashes, arguably even the fastest being that has ever existed and it has been remarked that Wally and Barry Allen are the only two speedsters that were fast enough to even outrun death.<ref name="Flash 101"/> However, now that Barry Allen is back, his "Fastest Man Alive" title may be in dispute.

Over the years, Wally's speed has fluctuated from his career as Kid Flash, where he could run beyond the speed of light, to the beginning of his career as the Flash, in which he was limited to a top speed of approximately {{Convert|700|mph|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer=Baron, Mike | Penciller=Guice, Jackson | Inker=Mahlstedt, Larry | Story=Flash | Title=Flash | Volume=2 | Issue=1 | Date=June 1987 | Publisher=DC Comics | Page=5 | Panel=5}}</ref>

==Allies and friends==
Wally's father, Rudolph West<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer=Baron, Mike | Editor=Gold, Mike | Penciller=Guice, Jackson | Letterer=Haynie, Steve | Inker=Torrance, Jack | Colorist=Eiber, Shelley | Story=Speed McGee | Title=Flash | Volume=2 | Issue=5 | Date=October 1987 | Publisher=DC Comics | Page=15 | Panel=6}}</ref> (a [[Manhunter (comics)|Manhunter]] agent), was presumed deceased following an explosion in [[Cuba]] during the ''[[Invasion! (DC Comics)|Invasion]]'' series. He reappeared years later at, among other places, his ex-wife Mary West's (Wally's mother) second wedding. They both later attended Wally and Linda's wedding.

While they disagree regularly, Wally has developed an odd friendship/respect with [[Batman]], who has more than once made it clear that those feelings are mutual.

Like his predecessors, West is good friends with the [[Green Lantern]] of his time ([[Kyle Rayner]]). Wally also retained a close friendship with Kyle's predecessor, [[Hal Jordan]], who often looked out for Wally even while he was the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]]. His best friend is [[Dick Grayson]], who served with Wally on the Teen Titans as the first [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] and served as Wally's best man at his wedding.

The members of the New Teen Titans, the team Wally served on as Kid Flash, has reappeared several times throughout his life. Although they are not always in close contact with one another, the team considers each other family; Wally is no exception.

===Supporting cast===
Wally has developed a very extensive supporting cast over the duration of his comic series that began in 1987. It should be noted that a few of them are former villains and adversaries, such as Pied Piper, Speed Demon, and Chunk.

*Mary West - Wally's mother.
*Dr. [[Tina McGee]] - A scientist/nutritionist with whom he had a brief romantic involvement.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer=Baron, Mike | Penciller=Guice, Jackson | Inker=Mahlstedt, Larry | Story=Kill the Kilg%re! | Title=Flash | Volume=2 | Issue=4 | Date=September 1987 | Publisher=DC Comics | Page= | Panel=}}</ref>
*Dr. Jerry McGee (also Speed Demon, Speed McGee) - Tina's (formerly ex-) husband and former super-speed villain.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer=Baron, Mike | Penciller=Guice, Jackson | Inker=Torrance, Jack | Story=Speed McGee | Title=Flash | Volume=2 | Issue=5 | Date=October 1987 | Publisher=DC Comics | Page= | Panel=}}</ref>
*Connie Noleski - A model and girlfriend of Wally's in his early career as the Flash. She is currently married to Chunk.
*[[Chunk (comics)|Chester P. Runk]] (also Chunk) - A brilliant physicist who became a walking black hole after a matter-transmitting machine he invented imploded during its first test.
*Mason Trollbridge - The former kid sidekick of a hard-edged depression-era crimefighter known as the Clipper.
*[[Pied Piper (comics)|Pied Piper]] - One of Barry Allen's former Rogues.
*[[Linda Park (comics)|Linda Park-West]] - Originally introduced as a television news reporter, Wally began dating, and eventually married, her.
*[[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]] - The original Flash. Currently out of semi-retirement and a member of the Justice Society of America.
*[[Jesse Chambers|Jesse Quick]] - The daughter of [[Liberty Belle (comics)#Libby Lawrence|Liberty Belle]] and [[Johnny Quick#Johnny Quick (Johnny Chambers)|Johnny Quick]], Jesse is a second generation superhero and speedster like her father.
*[[Max Mercury]] - The Zen Master of Speed.
*[[Iris West Allen]] - Wally's aunt, returned from the future.
*[[Bart Allen]] (Kid Flash) - Barry and Iris Allen's grandson from the future. Originally codenamed Impulse. He was a member of the [[Teen Titans]] when he took on his cousin's old identity. Wally and Bart are first cousins once removed.
*Ashley Zolomon - Current Rogue Profiler with the Keystone City PD, and former wife of [[Zoom (comics)|Hunter Zolomon]].
*Jai and Iris West - Wally and Linda's children. Aged 1 chronologically, but physically about 8 due to an unstable connection to the Speed Force. Wally had to teach them at super-speed, so they are mentally about the same age as they are physically. Following their nearly being killed by their powers, all of it was transferred to Iris, who became the new [[Impulse (DC Comics)|Impulse]].

==Other versions==
===Superman & Batman: Generations 2===
In [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s graphic novel ''[[Superman & Batman: Generations#Generations 2|Superman & Batman: Generations 2]]'', characters from the DC Universe are shown to age in real time. In this series, Wally appears as Kid Flash in 1964,<ref>''Superman & Batman: Generations 2'' #2 (September 2001)</ref> which is the year he first appeared as a founding member of the [[Teen Titans]] (though in this version, he is a founding member of the [[Justice League]]). By 1986, Wally has retired and been replaced by the fourth Flash (Carrie Allen, the daughter of Barry Allen).<ref>''Superman & Batman: Generations 2'' #3 (October 2001)</ref> Wally's son, Jay West, in turn, replaces Carrie in 2008 to become the fifth Flash.<ref>''Superman & Batman: Generations 2'' #4 (November 2001)</ref>

===Flash Annual===
''Flash Annual'' #7 (1994) shows a Flash who has become a superstar celebrity and film director.

===Kingdom Come===
In [[Mark Waid]]'s ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'', Wally becomes an embodiment of the Speed Force, but at the cost of his humanity until the events of ''[[The Kingdom (comics)|The Kingdom]]''. His twin children, Barry and Iris West, inherit their father's speed, but only Iris decides to become a superhero, a new Kid Flash. In Waid's ''The Life Story of the Flash'', "written" by Iris Allen, she describes her namesake in a positive light and Barry West as "a tragedy."

===Dark Flash Reality===
{{anchor|Walter West}}''The Flash'' vol. 2, #150–159 (1999–2000) introduces a version of Wally named "Walter West", also known as the Dark Flash, who appeared in the main DC universe after Wally and Linda were apparently killed in a fight with Abra Kadabra after he tried to dispose of Linda by sending her into Walter's reality, prompting Walter to travel back to Wally's world to take his place in recognition of his other self's sacrifice. This version of Wally is revealed to be an older, more powerful and experienced version from another reality within [[Hypertime]] (Although he only revealed his true identity to Jay Garrick, Donna Troy and Superman so that he could work with their various teams). It is revealed that this version of Wally was unable to save Linda from death at [[Kobra (comics)|Kobra]]'s hands. This made Walter a darker hero similar to Batman in ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'' storyline. After Walter's presence in the main DC Universe starts to cause other realities in Hypertime to bleed over into the main one, [[Superman]] and [[Wonder Woman]] force Walter to transverse Hypertime and return home. Although he leaves the main DC Universe, he appears to never make it back to his own reality. He seems to go from reality to reality with no success. After Hypertime was abandoned by DC, Walter West's continued existence becomes unclear.

===Elseworlds===
An [[Elseworlds]] tale in ''Superboy Annual'' #1 (1994) shows a Wally West that had lost the use of his legs and had them replaced with [[Bionics|bionic]] ones. With his artificial legs, Wally was not able to run at high speeds, though he could still move his arms at super-speed. This version of Wally died saving [[Green Lantern]] [[Hal Jordan]] from a yellow projectile.

===JLA: Another Nail===
In ''[[JLA: Another Nail]]'', Wally West (as Kid Flash) makes a brief appearance when all time periods meld together. He is flying with Wonder Girl ([[Donna Troy]]).

===Armageddon 2001===
In the "[[Armageddon 2001]]" crossover, Wally's future shows he has married and fathered a son. All three move into the Witness Protection Program to escape a mobster that can discern secrets with a touch. His son gains his speed but not his protective aura. After defeating the mobster and his older rogue's gallery, Wally manages to donate all of his speed to his son, granting the much needed aura.<ref>''Flash Annual'' #4 (1991)</ref>

===Flashpoint===
In the alternate timeline of the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' event, Wally West acts as an assistant and cameraman for his aunt Iris, who in this reality is a television reporter. Investigating Central City's hero, [[Captain Cold|Citizen Cold]], Wally discovers that his true identity is that of a former low-level criminal. Citizen Cold confronts him before he can reveal this information, and freezes him in a block of ice.<ref>''Flashpoint: Citizen Cold'' #1 (June 2011)</ref> Wally was a childhood friend of [[Pied Piper (comics)|Pied Piper]], who arrives at Wally's lair and discovers Wally is killed by Citizen Cold. Pied Piper takes Wally's place in uncovering evidence of Citizen Cold's true identity.<ref>''Flashpoint: Citizen Cold'' #2 (July 2011)</ref> Afterwards, a grave for Wally is held by his aunt Iris along with her husband John.<ref>''Flashpoint: Kid Flash Lost'' #3 (August 2011)</ref>
