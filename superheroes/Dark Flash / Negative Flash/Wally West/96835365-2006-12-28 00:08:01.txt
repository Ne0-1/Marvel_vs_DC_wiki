'''Wally West''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|Universe]], the first [[Kid Flash]] and the third [[Flash (comics)|Flash]].

==Character history==
===Kid Flash===
Wally West was the nephew of Iris West (and consequently, [[Barry Allen]]'s nephew by marriage), and was introduced in ''The Flash'' vol. 1, #110 (1959).  When West was about ten years old, he was visiting the Central City [[police]] laboratory that Barry Allen (Iris' boyfriend at the time) worked, and the freak accident that gave Allen his powers repeated itself, bathing West in electrically-charged chemicals.  Now possessing the same powers as The Flash, West donned a smaller sized copy of Barry Allen's Flash outfit and became the young crimefighter '''Kid Flash'''.

[[Image:Wally3.gif|thumb|left|Wally as Kid Flash]]
He soon adopted a slightly different, yellow-and-red outfit with his hair exposed, and became a founding member of the [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]], along with fellow sidekicks [[Dick Grayson|Robin]] and [[Aqualad]].  Always something of a straight-shooter from rural [[United States|America]], Kid Flash sometimes felt out of place alongside more flamboyant heroes such as [[Speedy]] and [[Donna Troy|Wonder Girl]].

Note that [[Bart Allen]] adopted the codename Kid Flash, and in the alternate future of ''[[Kingdom Come (comic)|Kingdom Come]]'', Wally's daughter Iris is Kid Flash.

===Flash===
As a young adult, West found his powers to be failing and even doing damage to his body, and he retired from crimefighting until a cure could be found.  But he was called to action again by the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', in which his uncle Barry was killed.  As a side effect of the energies he was exposed to during that adventure, West's powers stabilized.  However, he could no longer run at the extraordinary speeds of his uncle, but was limited to the [[speed of sound]], and had to eat vast quantities of food to maintain his metabolism.

Despite these handicaps, West resumed his career, though he retired his own Kid Flash costume and adopted the costume and name of the Flash to honor his uncle.  He did, however, make his identity public knowledge to keep from replacing Barry Allen in the minds of the public.  This made him the first sidekick to actually take on the name of his mentor.  A short time later, West won a [[lottery]], bought a large mansion, and became something of a playboy.  He joined [[Justice League Europe]] early in his career as Flash and also later joined the reformed [[Justice League]].  Like his powers at the time, West's finances and luck continued to ebb and wane until ''Flash'' vol. 2, #62, when his playboy ways also ended and his fortunes stabilized.

===The Speed Force===
Over the next few years, West learned several things about his powers.  First, it was suggested that Allen had not actually been human after gaining his own powers, but was a powerful energy force of which West used only a fraction.  As Allen's career wound down and after he died, West had access to only a fraction of the energy.  Later, West discovered that in fact Allen was a conduit to the [[Speed Force]], an extradimensional energy force that West and other speedsters also tapped.  West had been holding back from fully embracing the Speed Force again for fear of replacing his uncle in the minds of the public.

===Realization of his full potential===
A difficult encounter with a particularly vicious foe, the first [[Reverse-Flash]] (Eobard Thawne), who was bent on destroying Allen's legacy finally motivated West to use his abilities to their fullest potential.  Upon arriving, Thawne briefly posed as Barry Allen before going rogue and attacking Central City for 'forgetting him', even breaking [[Jay Garrick]]'s leg in a battle.  However, as Thawne bragged to Wally about how, when he was finished, no one would even remember Barry, a mental block Wally had imposed on his speed finally snapped; Wally had always limited his speed because, when he could move as fast as Barry, he really ''would'' have replaced him, but he feared Thawne replacing Barry more than he feared himself doing so.

As a result, West gained even greater speeds than previously seen in his days as Kid Flash.  After discovering and being absorbed by the Speed Force, returning to Earth and battling the student/priest of speed, [[Savitar (comics)|Savitar]], West gained some additional powers from the [[Speed Force]], and even more powers after meeting an alternate version of himself, Walter West (the Dark Flash), via [[Hypertime]] travel.  Until West's accumulation of new powers circa issues #90 and up, some of his uncle's abilities continued to elude West; most notably, the power to precisely travel through time, especially with the ease which Allen accomplished these feats.  More recently, West has on several occasions used his speed to break time and even dimensional barriers (in ''The Flash'' vol. 2, #159, Walter West landed on our Earth and recognized himself on the cover of what was then the current month's issue of).  The abilities that West has not been able to duplicate seem to coincide with Barry Allen's unique and complete control of his molecular structure.

Like his uncle, West had a friendship with [[Hal Jordan]], a.k.a. [[Green Lantern]].  When Jordan became [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]], he was replaced by [[Kyle Rayner]].  Having grown up with Jordan as Green Lantern, West did not warmly embrace Rayner when Rayner first took over the mantle and was very critical and sometimes harsh with Rayner during his early days.  In time, West eventually accepted Rayner as Green Lantern and they became best friends and supporters.

===Marriage===
West married [[journalist]] and longtime girlfriend, [[Linda Park (comics)|Linda Park]].  After an attack on Linda by a new Reverse-Flash, [[Zoom (comics)|Zoom]], caused a miscarriage of their unborn twins by triggering a sonic boom, West regretted the public knowledge of his identity.  [[Spectre (comics)|The Spectre]] (Hal Jordan) wiped the knowledge of the Flash's secret identity from everyone's mind, including West's.  He began working as a mechanic for the [[Keystone City]] Police, a job that reminded him of Barry Allen (whom he only remembered as a police scientist).  Eventually, [[Batman]] deduced the truth and restored West's memory.  The truth has also been revealed to West's friends in the heroic community, and to Linda Park, who found it difficult to deal with (as, in her false memories, their twins had been innocent victims caught in the crossfire between the Flash and Zoom) and took some time away from her husband.  They are now back together.  

Due to another fight with Zoom, which featured the temporary return of Barry Allen and Professor Zoom, the events leading to Linda's miscarriage were altered, Zoom took the brunt of the sonic boom that would have hit Linda, and the miscarriage was erased.  Linda soon after delivered twins, leading Wally to reconsider his position as the Flash, aiming to give more time to his newfound family than to the heroic business.

===''Infinite Crisis''===
{{main|Infinite Crisis}}
{{spoilers}}
[[Image:Westcrisis.PNG|Wally and his family disappear into the Speed Force.  Art by [[George Perez]].|thumb]]
In ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #4, Wally, [[Jay Garrick|Jay]], and [[Bart Allen|Bart]] joined together to stop the rampage of [[Superboy-Prime]] in [[Smallville]], using their top speeds to hinder him.  During the battle, Wally seemed to turn into energy and started to disappear.  He was able to appear to Linda (his "lightning rod").  During his goodbye to her, she grabbed onto him with their infant children in her arms and all four vanished.

Apparently, Linda, Wally and their twins are still alive in an alternate reality, living in its version of Keystone City, from which only Bart Allen has managed to return.  Bart tells the other heroes that Wally is "just taking some time away" with Linda to watch his twins grow.  For now, no one knows if he is able to, or even wants to, return to Earth.

==Powers==
Wally's primary super power is his speed.  Over the years, this has fluctuated from his career as Kid Flash, where he could approach the speed of light, to the beginning of his career as The Flash, in which he was limited to a top speed of approximately {{mph|700|1}}, leading to near retirement and returning to college before the death of Barry Allen.  In recent years, with the knowledge and mastery of the Speed Force at his disposal, Wally has managed to reach the seemingly impossible speeds beyond light that lead into the Speed Force.

As Kid Flash, Wally had the ability to control the vibration of his molecules to the degree that he could vibrate through solid objects and traverse other dimensions and times.  He lost this ability when he became The Flash, and regained this power in later years with the added twist that vibrating through objects causes them to explode; apparently, this later version of the power passed some of Wally's speed to the molecular structure of the object he vibrated through, and the object would shake itself apart.

Other applications of super-speed:
*Being able to run across the surface of large bodies of water--moving so fast that he does not break the [[surface tension]] of the water as he runs.
*Overcoming gravity by running up and down vertical surfaces.
*Creating wind vortexes by running in circles or rotating his arms and legs.
*"Stealing" the speed of others and utilizing it himself, or adding speed to a being or object already in motion.

As with most super-speedsters, Wally possesses an "aura" which protects him (and whatever he carries) from heat and air friction when he travels at high velocities.

==Uniforms==
[[Image:Wally2.png|thumb|Wally as The Flash]]
At the beginning of his career as the Flash, initially wearing the costume of his late mentor Barry Allen, Wally would soon modify the belt of his uniform to resemble two connecting lightning bolts, remove the wings from the top of his boots, alter the material of his costume, and add opaque lenses to the eyes of his cowl.  This modified design utilized elements of the costume designed by artist [[Dave Stevens]] for the live action [[The Flash (TV series)|television series, ''The Flash'']].  Later, after an accident left him with two broken legs, Wally discovered he had gained enough control over the Speed Force to create a costume which would support him and enable him to run despite his injury.  With enough control, his Speed Force Energy costume could be shaped identically to his uniform.  This energy-based costume could appear at Wally's will, and could be mentally modified to show his eyes (which he resumed as the normal appearance) and mouth, or to shield both from a hostile environment.

==Villains==
Like his predecessor before him, Wally has accumulated a [[Enemies of the Flash|Rogues' Gallery]] as well.  Many of his uncle's old rogues are still around, except for Captain Boomerang (George "Digger" Harkness, who was killed during ''[[Identity Crisis (comics)|Identity Crisis]]'' by [[Jack Drake]], the father of the current [[Tim Drake|Robin]], in self-defense, although Jack died as well) and Mirror Master (Samuel Scudder, who was killed during the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' by [[Krona (comics)|Krona]]).

Some of these newer rogues include:
*'''[[Blacksmith (comics)|Blacksmith]]''' - head of the Network with the ability to fuse metal with flesh.
*'''[[Cicada (comics)|Cicada]]''' - cult leader with immortality
*'''[[Double Down (comics)|Double Down]]''' - has a cursed deck of mystical playing cards embedded in himself.  They can be thrown telekinetically and are razor sharp.
*'''[[Girder (comics)|Girder]]''' - superstrong and superdurable, made of steel.
*'''[[Magenta (comics)|Magenta]]''' - uses magnetism-based powers.
*'''[[Mirror Master#Evan McCulloch|Mirror Master]]''' (Evan McCulloch) - uses the original Mirror Master's equipment.
*'''[[Murmur (DC Comics)|Murmur]]''' - a serial killer who developed the "frenzy virus", an [[anthrax]]-like virus based on his own blood.
*'''[[Peek-a-Boo (comics)|Peek-a-Boo]]''': A [[teleportation|teleporting ]][[metahuman]] and reluctant rogue.
*'''[[Plunder (comics)|Plunder]]''' - a bounty hunter from a mirror universe.  His analogue in this world is the Keystone City PD cop Jared Morillo.
*'''[[Tar Pit (comics)|Tar Pit]]''' - mind trapped in invulnerable [[asphalt]].
*'''[[Thinker (DC Comics)#Artificial intelligence|Thinker]]''' - A sentient computer program in hologram form based on the brain patterns of the original Thinker.
*'''[[Trickster (comics)#Axel Walker|Trickster]]''' (Axel Walker) - based on the original Trickster.
*'''[[Zoom (comics)|Zoom]]''' - exists on a separate timeline from the world.  This gives the illusion of superspeed.

==Allies and friends==

Wally's father, Rudolph West (a [[Manhunter (comics)|Manhunter]] agent), was presumed deceased following an explosion in [[Cuba]] during the ''[[Invasion! (DC Comics)|Invasion]]'' series. He reappeared years later at, among other places, his ex-wife Mary West's (Wally's mother) second wedding. They both later attended Wally and Linda's wedding.

While they disagree regularly, Wally has a developed an odd friendship/respect with Batman, whom has more than once made it clear that those feelings are mutual. 

Like his predecessors, West is good friends with the [[Green Lantern]] of his time ([[Kyle Rayner]]).  Wally also retained a close friendship with Kyle's predecessor Hal Jordan, who often looked out for Wally even while he was the Spectre.  His best friend is perhaps [[Dick Grayson]], who served with Wally on the Teen Titans as the first Robin.

==Supporting cast==
Wally also has developed a very extensive supporting cast over the duration of his ongoing comic book series which began in 1987.  It should be noted that a few of them are former villains and adversaries, such as '''[[Pied Piper (comics)|Pied Piper]]''', Speed Demon and Chunk.

*Mary West - Wally's mother
*Dr. Tina McGee - a scientist/nutritionist with whom he had a brief romantic involvement
*Dr. Jerry McGee a.k.a. Speed Demon a.k.a. Speed McGee - Tina's (formerly ex-) husband and former super-speed villain
*Connie Noleski - a model and girlfriend of Wally's in his early career as the Flash.  She is currently married to Chunk.
*'''[[Chunk (comics)|Chester P. Runk]]''' a.k.a. '''Chunk''' - a brilliant physicist who became a walking black hole after a matter-transmitting machine he invented imploded during its first test
*Mason Trollbridge - the former kid sidekick of a hard-edged depression-era crimefighter known as the Clipper.
*'''[[Pied Piper (comics)|Pied Piper]]''' - one of Barry Allen's former Rogues.
*'''[[Linda Park (comics)|Linda Park-West]]''' - originally introduced as a television news reporter, Wally began dating and eventually married her.
*'''[[Jay Garrick]]''' - the original Flash.  Currently out of semi-retirement and a member of the Justice Society of America.
*'''[[Jesse Quick]]''' - the daughter of [[Liberty Belle (superheroes)|Liberty Belle]] and [[Johnny Quick]], Jesse is a second generation superhero and speedster like her father.
*'''[[Max Mercury]]''' - the Zen Master of Speed.
*'''[[Iris Allen]]''' - Wally's aunt, returned from the future.
*'''[[Bart Allen|Kid Flash]]''' - Bart Allen, Barry and Iris Allen's grandson from the future.  Originally code-named Impulse.  Was a member of the [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]] when he took on his cousin's old identity.
*Ashley Zolomon - current Rogue Profiler with the Keystone City PD, and former wife of ''[[Zoom (comics)|Hunter Zolomon]]''

==Children==
At the end of '''''Rogue War''''', Linda retroactively gave birth to twins.  The twins are never named; however, Mark Waid's ''Kingdom Come'' and ''The Kingdom'' gives those names as Barry and Iris West.  Both inherit their father's speed, but only Iris decides to become a superhero, a new Kid Flash.  In Waid's ''The Life Story of the Flash'', "written" by Iris Allen, she describes her namesake in a positive light and Barry West as "a tragedy".  However, the timeline has since been altered.  Presently, the fate of the entire family is unknown.

==Other media==
===''The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure''===
In [[1967]], ''[[The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure]]'' was produced by [[Filmation]] and featured seven minute shorts which starred various DC Universe heroes.  Wally West was featured in two of them as Kid Flash.

Wally West is in a segment starring the Flash (Barry Allen), "To Catch A Blue Bolt" shows Barry and Wally changing into their Flash and Kid Flash uniforms using their rings.  It should be noted that Wally's appearance differs from his comic book counterpart.  He has black hair and his red and yellow color scheme is reversed from his second uniform.

There was also one Teen Titans segment which featured [[Tempest (comics)#Garth|Aqualad]], [[Donna Troy|Wonder Girl]], [[Speedy]] and the Wally West version of Kid Flash as seen in the Flash segment.

=== [[DC Animated Universe]] ===
==== ''Superman: The Animated Series'' ====
An episode of ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' called "Speed Demons" featured the first animated appearance of Wally West as Flash.  He was voiced by [[Charlie Schlatter]].

==== ''Justice League/Justice League Unlimited'' ====
[[Image:212fs.jpg|thumb|Flash as featured in ''JLU'' episode ''Divide We Fall.'']] Wally West is the Flash featured as one of the seven founding members of the Justice League, in both the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' and ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' animated series.  His personality is more or less the same as it was from his appearance on ''Superman: The Animated Series'', and his flippant attitude often annoys his teammates, most notably [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]], the [[Green Lantern]].  The Flash is often used to provide comic relief from the often intense nature of his fellow Leaguers, though there are a few episodes which he is the featured hero.  However, in one episode of ''Justice League Unlimited'', he complains to [[Elongated Man]] that he dislikes being viewed as the "teenage sidekick" even though he was part of the original seven.  His super fast metabolism, which results in him eating absurdly and inhumanly large portions of food, was something of a running gag on the series.  Flash's endorsement of the "Lghtspeed" candy bar (which created controversy fueled by a talk-show host who constantly dissed the League in one episode) was also a sort of running gag, as the bars make numerous other appearances, with Flash's picture on the wrapper in some cases.  He was prominently featured in "Divided We Fall," where he successfully defeated a fused [[Lex Luthor]] and [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]] (in addition, this also allowed him to contact the Speed Force), "Flash and Substance," a day in the life of The Flash in [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]] during Flash Appreciation Day, and "The Great Brain Robbery," in which he switches bodies with Lex Luthor.  The Kid Flash costume worn in Teen Titans can be seen in the museum during the episode "Flash and Substance".

He was voiced by [[Michael Rosenbaum]], the actor who portrays a young Lex Luthor in the live action television series ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]],'' which adds an extra level of ironic humor to the episode "The Great Brain Robbery."

===''Teen Titans'' animated series===
[[Image:KidFlash.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Kid Flash in "Lightspeed"]]
Kid Flash appears in an episode of the ''[[Teen Titans (animated series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series entitled "Lightspeed".  While the character's true identity is never given, the fact that [[Michael Rosenbaum]] voices the character implies that he is intended to be Wally West, as Rosenbaum also voices an older Flash/Wally West in Justice League.  In the series, he is portrayed similar to the way that Wally was portrayed in comic books.  His personality is often considered "laid back", and he is known to be comedic and sometimes flirtatious.

When Jinx asks Kid Flash who he is working for he says "I work alone these days", possibly implying a previous partnership with the Titans or Barry Allen.

When the Titans are searching for the [[Brotherhood of Evil]] and the [[Titans East]] have gone back home to [[Steel City]], Kid Flash decides to help protect [[Jump City]] and stop crimes from being committed.  When he interferes with the [[Fearsome Five|H.I.V.E. F.I.V.E.'s]] criminal deeds, he flirts with their leader, [[Jinx (comics)|Jinx]], and tries to make her reevaluate her life of crime.  Shortly afterwards the [[Brotherhood of Evil]] attempts to capture him and, after [[Madame Rouge]] tires him out, Jinx traps him in an electric field.  He is nearly handed over to Madame Rouge, but is freed by Jinx when she realizes Madame Rouge isn't as great as she seemed and that Kid Flash was the one who truly cared for her well being.  Afterwards, Jinx quits the H.I.V.E. F.I.V.E. and joins forces with him as a Titan and the two quickly form a romantic relationship.  

He briefly appears in a shot of all the Titans in "Calling All Titans", where it is revealed the Titans have come in contact with him and he has a Titan communicator.  In "Titans Together", he brings Jinx to the Brotherhood's lair as his ally and helps the speedsters [[Mas y Menos]] and the other Titans freeze the Brothehood's member villains inside [[cryogenic]] cases.  Mas y Menos are very impressed by Kid Flash's speed and abilities which he can engage on his own.

Kid Flash is one of the few Titans in the animated series to fully resemble his comic counterpart.  However, Wally's eyes in the comics are currently green.  The design of Kid Flash with blue eyes remains consistent with his original appearances, pre-Crisis.

Kid Flash is mentioned in issue #28 of ''[[Teen Titans Go!]]'', and makes [[cameo appearance|cameo appearances]] in several other issues.  He is featured in a worldwide race against Mas y Menos in issue #34.  Although knowing that Jinx obviously has feelings for him, he inadvertantly flirts with [[Raven (comics)|Raven]], [[Argent (comics)|Argent]], and several other girls behind while running the race, making Jinx jealous and causing him to lose the race to Mas y Menos when Jinx shows up at the finish line and confronts him about his flirtatious nature.

===[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]===
One of the aliases used by Bart Allen is Wally West.

===''Stop Motion''===
''Stop Motion'', a novel about Wally West by [[Mark Schultz]], adds depth to our understanding of the relationships between Wally and those closest to him: his mentor Barry, his aunt Iris, and his fellow members of the JLA.  However, it contradicts established continuity on several points, most notably frequent mentions of a genetic link between Wally and Iris, who the comics have established as adopted.
