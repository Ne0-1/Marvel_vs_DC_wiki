'''Wally West''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional]] [[superhero]] that appears in American [[comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. He is the first '''[[Kid Flash]]''' and the third '''[[Flash (comics)|Flash]]'''.<ref name="dc-ency">{{Cite book | last=Jimenez | first=Phil | author-link=Phil Jimenez | contribution=The Flash | editor-last=Dougall | editor-first=Alastair | title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages=124–127 | publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] | location=New York | year=2008 | isbn=0-7566-4119-5 | oclc=213309017}}</ref> He made his first appearance as the Kid Flash in the ''Flash #110'' in 1959. Wally took up the mantle of the Flash following the death of Barry Allen from 1986 to 2009 in DC's main lineup. His physical appearance is generally a redhead with green eyes, though he can often be seen with blue eyes also. Wally has an important role as the Flash in [[DC Rebirth]] (2016). 

The phrase ''Fastest Man Alive'' was first applied to Wally, after he first took on the mantle of his mentor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbr.com/teen-titans-the-15-most-powerful-members/15/|title=Teen Titans: The 15 most powerful members|work=cbr|author=Jason Wilkins|access-date=December 13, 2016}}</ref>

In his debut as the Flash, Wally wears a distinct red and gold costume, traditionally storing the costume compressed inside a ring and later creating a costume directly out of Speed Force energy. In the [[DC Rebirth]] (2016), the Flash Wally wears a red and silver costume. His power consists mainly of superhuman speed.

In 2011, [[IGN]] ranked Wally West #8 on their list of the "Top 100 Super Heroes of All Time", ahead of any other speedsters, stating that "Wally West is one of the DCU's greatest heroes, even if he does not rank as the original Scarlet Speedster".<ref>{{cite web|last=IGN|first=IGN|title=100 Greatest Superheroes of all time|url=http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/8|work=IGN|publisher=IGN|accessdate=20 July 2011}}</ref> In 2013, Wally West placed 6th on [[IGN]]'s Top 25 Heroes of DC Comics.<ref>{{cite web|last=Schedeen |first=Jesse |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/19/the-top-25-heroes-of-dc-comics |title=The Top 25 Heroes of DC Comics |publisher=IGN |date=2013-11-19 |accessdate=2015-11-01}}</ref>

Wally West has appeared in many forms of media, including the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' cartoons, in which he is voiced by [[Michael Rosenbaum]]. He also appeared in the 2010 TV show ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' as Kid Flash, voiced by [[Jason Spisak]], and as the Flash in Justice League Animated features such as ''[[Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths]]'' voiced by [[Josh Keaton]]. Wally also made his live-action debut in the second season of ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', as Kid Flash, portrayed by [[Keiynan Lonsdale]].

Wally West is known for his lighthearted and comical personality.

==Fictional character biography==

===Kid Flash===
Wally West was created by [[John Broome (writer)|John Broome]] and [[Carmine Infantino]] and introduced in ''[[The Flash (comic book)|The Flash]]'' #110 (1959). The character was the nephew of the existing Flash character's girlfriend and later wife, [[Iris West Allen|Iris West]]. During a visit to the [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]] [[police]] laboratory where [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] worked, the freak accident that gave Allen his powers repeated itself, bathing West in electrically charged chemicals. Now possessing the same powers as the Flash, West donned a smaller-sized copy of Barry Allen's Flash outfit and became the young crimefighter '''Kid Flash'''. Wally had a strained relationship with his own parents and often looked to his beloved aunt and uncle for moral support and guidance.

This costume was later altered (in ''The Flash'' #135 (1963)) to one that would make him more visually distinctive. The original red was replaced with a costume that was primarily yellow with red leggings, gloves, and ear-pieces.

[[File:Kid Flash (Wally West) 2nd costume.png|thumb|upright|right|Wally as Kid Flash; art by [[George Pérez]].]]
In addition to his appearances within the ''[[The Flash (comic book)|Flash]]'' title, the character was a founding member of the newly created [[Teen Titans]], where he became friends with [[Dick Grayson]], then known as Robin, later known as [[Nightwing]].<ref name="dc-ency"/> Sometime later, Wally contracted a mysterious illness that affected his entire bodily system; the more he used his speed powers, the faster his body deteriorated. This was caused by the fact that Wally was a boy when the electrified chemicals altered his body, which was still developing and maturing (as opposed to Barry Allen, who was already an adult when his accident occurred). As such, as Wally's body matured, his altered body chemistry was slowly killing him.

===The Flash===
During the 1985–86 miniseries ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', Barry gave his life to save the Earth when destroying the [[antimatter]] cannon that was aimed at Earth.<ref>''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' #7 (October 1985)</ref> Initially unaware of this, Wally was coaxed by [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]] into assisting the heroes against the [[Anti-Monitor]]'s forces. During the final battle with the Anti-Monitor, Wally was struck by a blast of anti-matter energy, which put his disease into remission. In the aftermath of the conflict, Wally took on his fallen mentor's costume and identity.<ref name="Crisis 12">''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' #12 (March 1986)</ref> Wally's role as Kid Flash was taken over by [[Bart Allen]], the second Kid Flash.

The decision by DC Comics' editorial staff to radically change their fictional universe saw a number of changes to the status quo of the character. Wally West became a new Flash, but less powerful than his predecessor.<ref name="dc-ency"/> For example, instead of being able to reach the speed of light, he could run just faster than that of sound.<ref name="Crisis 12"/> Also, the character had to eat vast quantities of food to maintain his metabolism.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer=[[Mike Baron|Baron, Mike]] | Penciller=[[Jackson Guice|Guice, Jackson]] | Inker=Mahlstedt, Larry | Story=Flash |title=Flash |volume=2 |issue=1 |date=June 1987 |publisher=DC Comics |page=1}}</ref>

Those changes were quickly followed up and 1987 saw the publication of a new ''Flash'' comic, initially written by [[Mike Baron]]. These stories focused not only on the Flash's superhero exploits, but the state of Wally's wealth. West won a [[lottery]],<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer=Baron, Mike | Penciller=Guice, Jackson | Inker=Mahlstedt, Larry | Story=Flash |title=Flash |volume=2 |issue=1 |date=June 1987 |publisher=DC Comics |page=20 | Panel=5}}</ref> bought a large mansion,<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer=Baron, Mike | Penciller=Guice, Jackson | Inker=Mahlstedt, Larry | Story=Heart... of Stone! |title=Flash |volume=2 |issue=2 |date=July 1987 |publisher=DC Comics |page=22 | Panel=3}}</ref> and began dating beautiful women. The character's finances and luck continued to ebb and wane until ''Flash'' vol. 2, #62, when his fortunes stabilized.

[[File:Wallyflash1.png|thumb|left|upright|''Flash'' vol. 2, #1 (June 1987). Wally West holds as first the Modern Age Flash; art by [[Jackson Guice]].]]
The 1990s also saw further modifications to the look of the character, with a modified uniform appearing in 1991.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer=Messner-Loebs, William | Penciller=LaRocque, Greg | Inker=Marzan, Jose, Jr. | Story=The Fastest Man... Alive! |title=Flash |volume=2 |issue=50 |date=May 1991 |publisher=DC Comics |page=22 | Panel=3}}</ref> This modified costume altered the visual appearance of the traditional Flash costume, with a belt made of two connecting lightning bolts meeting in a "V" at the front (where Allen's costume had a single bolt in a horizontal band), removal of the wings from the top of his boots, a change in the material of his costume, and opaque lenses added to the eyes of his cowl. This modified design utilized elements of the costume designed by artist [[Dave Stevens]] for the live action television series ''[[The Flash (1990 TV series)|The Flash]]''.

A difficult encounter with a particularly vicious foe, the first [[Reverse-Flash]] (Eobard Thawne)- Thawne had been killed by Barry Allen shortly before Allen's death, but this version of Thawne was from a time period before he originally became Allen's enemy- also served to increase the speed of the character, forcing him to push past a psychological block he had placed on his powers. To prevent himself from truly "replacing" Barry, Wally had subconsciously limited his speed so that he could never become his mentor's equal, but Thawne's bragging that he would become the true Flash forced Wally past this block, as he feared Thawne replacing Barry more than he feared himself doing so.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer=[[Mark Waid|Waid, Mark]] | Penciller=LaRocque, Greg | Inker=Richardson, Roy | Story=The Once and Future Flash |title=Flash |volume=2 |issue=79 |date=August 1993 |publisher=DC Comics |page= | Panel=3}}</ref> After this encounter, he was again Barry Allen's equal in speed, and eventually became even faster. Though he still had not been able to recover Barry's vibrational/phasing abilities (he could vibrate through objects but this would cause the object to explode), he gained several new powers that Barry never had. He was able to share/steal speed, use his speed to kinetically upgrade his attacks, and super heal others.

Writer [[Mark Waid]] expanded on the character's powers thematically and further redefined the character by introducing the [[Speed Force]], an energy source that served as a pseudo-scientific explanation for his powers and that of other fictional [[speedster (fiction)|speedsters]] within the [[DC Universe]]. Using this concept as a basis, the character's ability to tap into the Speed Force was used to expand his abilities. The character was now able to lend speed to other objects and people<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer=Waid, Mark | Penciller=Larroca, Salvador | Inker=Marzan, Jose, Jr. | Story=Terminal Velocity |title=Flash |volume=2 |issue=95–100 |date=November 1994 – April 1995}}</ref><ref name="Flash 101">{{Cite comic | Writer=Waid, Mark | Penciller=Jimenez, Oscar | Inker=Marzan, Jose, Jr. | Story=Going the Distance |title=The Flash |volume=2 |issue=101 |date=May 1995}}</ref> and create a costume directly out of Speed Force energy. Traditional powers such as the ability to vibrate through solid objects were also restored. The Flash was sued for not saving a woman from a burning building{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}. Because of this, the Flash felt pressured into having to constantly be heroic 24/7.

The 2000s saw writer [[Geoff Johns]] revitalize the character by introducing new versions of characters such as [[Zoom (comics)|Zoom]]; making significant use of the [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues]]; and marrying the character to longtime girlfriend [[Linda Park (comics)|Linda Park]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=118446 | title=Updated: ''All Flash'' #1 | work=[[Newsarama]] | date=June 27, 2007 | accessdate=2011-01-16}}</ref>

In the miniseries ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', as a narrative device, Wally West and his family were seen leaving for an alternative reality. This allowed the character Bart Allen to become the fourth Flash and headline a relaunched third volume of the title, called ''The Flash: The Fastest Man Alive''.

The critical reaction to this new version of the character was mixed and the character was killed off in the final issue of the short-lived third volume.<ref name="dc-ency"/> It was decided that Wally West should return; and the [[Justice League|JLA]]/[[Justice Society of America|JSA]] story "[[The Lightning Saga]]" was used to return the character to Earth along with his wife and children, who appear to have aged several years.

The character next appeared in ''All Flash'' #1 (2007), seeking vengeance on those who had killed Bart Allen. This was followed by ''The Flash'' vol. 2, which resumed publication after the long hiatus with issue #231 (October 2007). The series found the character struggling with trying to raise his two super-powered twins, plagued by accelerated growth and their inexperience in the heroic game, a task made more difficult by Wally's unemployment, his inability to keep a steady job, and the mistrust of the League for his decision to bring two children into the fold. The series was canceled with issue #247 (February 2009).

In ''[[Final Crisis]]'', the character was reunited with [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]], who had returned to life.

===''The Flash: Rebirth''===
{{Main|The Flash: Rebirth}}
Interviews with ''[[The Flash: Rebirth]]'' artist [[Ethan Van Sciver]] revealed that the character would adopt a newly designed costume in the limited series that reintroduces Barry Allen as the Flash.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=17542 | title=CCI Spotlight: Ethan Van Sciver | work=[[Comic Book Resources]] | date=July 31, 2008 | accessdate=2011-01-16}}</ref> The new costume is heavily inspired by the original changes made to the suit in ''Flash'' vol. 2, #50 (cowl lenses, "wingless" boots, the belt-line V-shape, and the darker red color of the suit), which were slipping in and out of usage when the character was drawn by different artists. Wally's costume has also been given a straight cowl

===Blackest Night===
During the Blackest Night, Wally West assists Barry Allen in spreading the word to every hero on Earth about the rise of the Black Lantern Corps. When Black Hand brings back Nekron, Barry is attacked by an army of Black Lanterns, while struggling to fight them off, Wally comes to his rescue, bringing with him the Justice League & Teen Titans, Bart Allen, the Kid Flash, among them. The three Flashes fight their way through Black Lanterns and charge at Nekron. Before they can strike, the Black Lantern Guardian Scar attacks them, attempting to convince them into becoming Black Lanterns. Right after, Hal Jordan and the leaders of the seven Lantern Corps arrive to assist. The heroes attack the Black Lanterns, but when Black Hand reanimates Batman's corpse as a Black Lantern, the resulting emotional shock allows the Black Lantern rings to latch onto the resurrected heroes, transforming Superman, Superboy, Wonder Woman, Green Arrow, Black Canary, and Kid Flash into Black Lanterns. Black Lantern Bart Allen attacks Barry Allen, and the two brawl for a moment before Wally fights him off. A pair of Black Lantern Rings then lock onto Barry and Hal. Wally flees with Barry, with Barry telling him to stay and protect himself and Bart. Barry and Hal then flee the scene to avoid becoming Black Lanterns.

===The New 52 and DC Universe Rebirth===
[[File:Wally West (Rebirth 2016).jpg|thumb|upright|Wally West's new costume as the Flash in homage to his previous Kid Flash and the Flash costumes. Promotional art for ''[[DC Rebirth]]''; art by Brett Booth.]]
Following the 2011 reboot of the DC comics universe, this version of Wally West appears to have never existed. A seemingly [[Wally West II|new interpretation of Wally West]] was introduced in ''The Flash Annual #3''. Originally portrayed as the New 52 version of the classic character and the biracial son of Rudy West, this Wally was [[retcon]]ned in ''[[DC Rebirth]]'' #1 as being the cousin of the original, pre-''Flashpoint'' Wally West and the son of the New 52 Reverse Flash, Daniel West. Both cousins are explained as having been named after their great-grandfather.

The existence of the original Wally West is hinted at in the final issue of ''Titans Hunt'', in which the various original Teen Titans remember their bond to each other, but realise that they are still forgetting an important final member of their team. They look out to the ocean as lightning strikes.<ref>''Titans Hunt'' #8 (May 2016)</ref>

The original Wally West is reintroduced to DC continuity a week later in ''[[DC Rebirth]]'' story. The story reveals that following the [[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]] event, Wally became lost in the Speed Force for 10 years. While trapped, he came to realize that Barry had not been responsible for the mutation of the New Earth universe into Prime Earth but that [[Doctor Manhattan|an unknown entity]] had used Barry's time travelling as an opportunity to fundamentally alter reality. The fallout of the recent ''Darkseid War'' allowed Wally to try and reach out to his former friends in the hopes of either returning or warning them of the truth. Each attempt caused him to fall further into the Speed Force. After realizing not even Linda (his traditional "lightning rod") could remember him, Wally sank into desolation and chose to appear before Barry one last time to thank him for the life he had given him. Just before Wally disappeared, Barry remembered him and dragged him free of the Speed Force. Following a tearful reunion, Wally gave Barry his warning of the true source of the universal change and the dangers to come.<ref>''DC Universe: Rebirth'' one-shot (May 2016)</ref> Although the two decide to keep Wally's return secret from Iris based on Wally's own experience with Linda, Barry encourages him to return to the Teen Titans, but also recommends that he don a new costume to reflect that he is the ''Flash'' rather than 'Kid Flash'.<ref>''The Flash: Rebirth'' one-shot (June 2016)</ref> Wally goes to the Titans, and through both physical contact and the Speed Force, reminds them of their memories with him. After an emotional reunion, he tells them of the situation. Wally believes that the unknown entity will attack again to prevent them from finding out the truth, which they will do "together" as the Titans.<ref>''Titans: Rebirth'' one-shot (June 2016)</ref>

Directly after the events in ''Titans: Rebirth'', Lilith has Wally repeat the story of his return in order for her to use it as a means of making the mental connections between him, herself and the Titans stronger. While doing this, she notices the most powerful thought in Wally's mind is that of Linda Park, which sparks various, but supportive, reactions from the other Titans. Nightwing encourages Wally to seek Linda out and try and make new memories with her. Elsewhere, Linda is still puzzled by Wally's sudden presence in her life and decides to investigate him further.<ref>''Titans #1''(July 2016)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2015}}
Wally's primary [[superpower]] is his ability to control the speed with which his body vibrates and to move at super speed, which he uses primarily to run at super-human velocities. This super speed is derived from his connection to the [[Speed Force]]: a vaguely defined extra-dimensional energy force from which most speedster heroes draw their powers. Wally could be the fastest Flash <ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/MarkWaid/status/807082031779692544|title=Mark Waid status|work=twitter|author=Mark Waid|access-date=December 27, 2016}}</ref> and faster than [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Demonpuppy/status/803469602042716160|title=Demonpuppy status|work=twitter|author=Brett Booth|access-date=December 13, 2016}}</ref>
 
While most to all speedsters can make a connection and draw upon this force, West "[[wikt:mainline|mainline]]s" power from the Speed Force itself and cannot be cut off from the source. This connection to the Speed Force grants him unique abilities that other speedsters lack, such as lending and taking speed (which manifests in different ways, ranging from becoming speedsters themselves to bolstering others [[metabolism]]s and healing abilities, allowing them to recover from injuries in a fraction of the normal time), as well as absorbing [[kinetic energy]] in a less direct manner; he once absorbed the kinetic energy of the entire planet Earth while standing at the North Pole when his teammates were forced to move the planet to prevent possible earthquakes. Wally has also found a way to create a costume out of pure Speed Force energy.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Johns|first1=Geoff|title=The Flash Omnibus – Volume 1}}</ref>

Like all Flashes, Wally is surrounded by a protective aura that allows him to resist the heat created by the pressure of compressed air caused by moving at super speed as well as other environmental consequences of moving at such velocities. It is not known how Wally is able to circumvent the damage moving at such great speeds would normally have on the environment, but it has been hypothesized that his protective aura allows him to "[[wikt:side step|side step]]" such environmental consequences. Because of his powers and connection to the Speed Force, he can run at varying speeds for extended periods of time without needing rest or causing damage to his body. It is his connection to the Speed Force that constantly rejuvenates him while running, making it so he does not literally feed upon his own body to generate the energy for super speed. Even so, he has a sped up metabolism and finds it necessary to eat often and in great quantities to help supply the chemical energy needed.

Using his abilities, Wally can run at such speed that he can run on water, create powerful [[vortices]] with his arms or body, and vibrate at such speeds that he becomes [[invisible]] to the [[naked eye]]. Wally can also match the [[steady state|vibrational constant]] of [[solid]] objects and vibrate through them, passing his molecules through the spaces in between the atoms and molecules of the matter he's vibrating through, an ability shared by the second Flash, Barry Allen. Unlike Barry Allen, however, Wally accidentally destabilizes whatever he passes through, causing it to explode. While this has its drawbacks, Wally has learned to use this offensively in battle. Like other speedsters, Wally West can use his speed to travel through time. Wally West also outran death to the point where death didn't even exist and continued to run to get Linda back. There was a comic named The Human Race in which Wally ran faster than instant teleportation, Reaching Trans-Time Velocity. Flash vol 2 #177 had Wally outrun a black hole. Using Jessie Quick's speed formula combined with his speed steal, Wally can temporally accelerate to the point where he escapes linear time, essentially allowing him to function like the chronokenetic Zoom.

Wally is considered one of the fastest Flashes and arguably is one of the fastest beings that has ever existed as said by Max Mercury—and it has been remarked that Wally and Barry are the only two speedsters that were fast enough to even outrun [[Black Flash|death]].<ref name="Flash 101"/> Whether Wally or Barry is the fastest man alive remains the subject of speculation, although Wally himself has made several references to having surpassed his mentor. 

Wally is fast enough to easily break all the barriers and even enter the Speed Force. Wally has, on several occasions, traveled much faster than light and been pulled into and exited the Speed Force by his own volition. He has shown that he can achieve practically any speed he wishes and that there are no limits to his speed. 

Some interpretations of Wally are shown as having above average strength. On the Justice League episode "The Brave and the Bold Part 2", the gorilla [[Solovar]] tells Wally that he weighed around 400&nbsp;lbs; Wally then proceeded to lift Solovar and run to safety.

Wally is also a skilled science prodigy. In some versions, Wally uses these skills to recreate the accident that gave Barry his powers by himself, granting himself his own powers. Like his mentor, Wally understands what his speed enables him to do, and uses his knowledge of physics to his advantage in battle.

On his return at DC universe, Wally is still the fastest Flash, but even more so than before. In Titans (2016) #5 issue, he said the Speed Force is inside him more than ever before, "like a new dimension of speed". His white lighting contains all the colors from the Speed Force.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Demonpuppy/status/803468258561007616|title=White Lighting - Brett Booth|work=twitter|author=Brett Booth|accessdate=November 30, 2016}}</ref>

==Allies and friends==
Wally's father, Rudolph West<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer=Baron, Mike |editor=Gold, Mike | Penciller=Guice, Jackson | Letterer=Haynie, Steve | Inker=Torrance, Jack | Colorist=Eiber, Shelley | Story=Speed McGee |title=Flash |volume=2 |issue=5 |date=October 1987 |publisher=DC Comics |page=15 | Panel=6}}</ref> (a [[Manhunter (comics)|Manhunter]] agent), was presumed deceased following an explosion in [[Cuba]] during the ''[[Invasion! (DC Comics)|Invasion]]'' series. He reappeared years later at, among other places, his ex-wife Mary West's (Wally's mother) second wedding. They both later attended Wally and Linda's wedding.

While they disagree regularly, Wally has developed an odd friendship/respect with [[Batman]], who has more than once made it clear that those feelings are mutual.

Like his predecessors, West is best friends with the [[Green Lantern]] of his time ([[Kyle Rayner]]). Wally also retained a close friendship with Kyle's predecessor, [[Hal Jordan]], who often looked out for Wally even while he was the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]]. His best friend is [[Dick Grayson]], who served with Wally on the Teen Titans as the first [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] and served as Wally's best man at his wedding.

The members of the New Teen Titans, the team Wally served on as Kid Flash, have reappeared several times throughout his life. Although they are not always in close contact with one another, the team consider each other family; Wally is no exception.

===Supporting cast===
Wally has developed a very extensive supporting cast over the duration of his comic series that began in 1987. It should be noted that a few of them are former villains and adversaries, such as Pied Piper, Speed Demon, and Chunk.

*[[Linda Park (comics)|Linda Park-West]] – Wally West's girlfriend, and later wife. Park is a news reporter, although she later goes to medical school.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Johns|first1=Geoff|title=The Flash Omnibus Volume 2}}</ref> Park is West's "lightning rod" when travelling in the Speed Force, much like how Iris West is Barry Allen's "lightning rod".
*Mary West – Wally's mother.
*[[Iris West Allen]] – Wally's aunt, returned from the future. Iris was a role model for Wally growing up, and one of the inspirations behind his career as the Flash.
*Dr. [[Tina McGee]] – A scientist/nutritionist with whom he had a brief romantic involvement.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer=Baron, Mike | Penciller=Guice, Jackson | Inker=Mahlstedt, Larry | Story=Kill the Kilg%re! |title=Flash |volume=2 |issue=4 |date=September 1987 |publisher=DC Comics |page= | Panel=}}</ref>

*[[Chunk (comics)|Chester P. Runk]] (also Chunk) – A brilliant physicist who became a walking black hole after a matter-transmitting machine he invented imploded during its first test.
*Mason Trollbridge – The former kid sidekick of a hard-edged depression-era crimefighter known as the Clipper.
*[[Pied Piper (comics)|Pied Piper]] – One of Barry Allen's former Rogues whom Wally and Linda befriended. Piper even expressed his homosexuality to Wally on a rooftop while in discussion with him about the [[Joker (comics)|The Joker]]
*[[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]] – The original Flash. Currently out of semi-retirement and a member of the Justice Society of America.
*[[Jesse Chambers|Jesse Quick]] – The daughter of [[Liberty Belle (comics)#Libby Lawrence|Liberty Belle]] and [[Johnny Quick#Johnny Quick (Johnny Chambers)|Johnny Quick]], Jesse is a second generation superhero and speedster like her father.
*[[Max Mercury]] – The Zen Master of Speed.
*[[Bart Allen]] (Kid Flash) – Barry and Iris Allen's grandson from the future. Originally codenamed Impulse. He was a member of the [[Teen Titans]] when he took on Wally's old identity.
*Ashley Zolomon – Current Rogue Profiler with the Keystone City PD, and former wife of [[Zoom (comics)|Hunter Zolomon]].
*Jai West and [[Iris West II|Iris West]] – Wally and Linda's children. Aged 1 chronologically, but physically about 8 due to an unstable connection to the Speed Force. Wally had to teach them at super-speed, so they are mentally about the same age as they are physically.

==Other versions==

===''Superman & Batman: Generations 2''===
In [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s graphic novel ''[[Superman & Batman: Generations#Generations 2|Superman & Batman: Generations 2]]'', characters from the DC Universe are shown to age in real time. In this series, Wally appears as Kid Flash in 1964,<ref>''Superman & Batman: Generations 2'' #2 (September 2001)</ref> which is the year he first appeared as a founding member of the [[Teen Titans]] (though in this version, he is a founding member of the [[Justice League]]). By 1986, Wally has retired and been replaced by the fourth Flash (Carrie Allen, the daughter of Barry Allen).<ref>''Superman & Batman: Generations 2'' #3 (October 2001)</ref> Wally's son, Jai West, in turn, replaces Carrie in 2008 to become the fifth Flash.<ref>''Superman & Batman: Generations 2'' #4 (November 2001)</ref>

===''Flash Annual''===
''Flash Annual'' #7 (1994, one of a series of ''[[Elseworlds]]'' annuals) shows a Flash who has become a superstar celebrity and film director. He was apparently left disabled by an attempt by the [[Weather Wizard]] to create a new ice age, which in this reality also resulted in the death of Barry Allen. Wally's film is repeatedly interrupted by the Weather Wizard's insistence that Wally's version is a lie (claiming he had benevolent intentions and that Barry's death was a tragic accident) – much to Wally's horror the Weather Wizard is given the authority to make changes to the film. During a confrontation in the carpark, the Weather Wizard's demonisation of Barry Allen is ended when he is killed by a lightning bolt (which Wally suspects may be [[wiktionary:Divine intervention|divine intervention]]).

===''Kingdom Come''===
[[File:The Flash (Kingdom Come).png|100px|thumb|right|The Flash (Wally West) in ''Kingdom Come''. Art by [[Alex Ross]].]]
In [[Mark Waid]]'s ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'', set on Earth--22, Wally has become the embodiment of the Speed Force, "living between the ticks of a second".  He keeps his home of Keystone City safe by patrolling it nonstop at super speed.<ref>''Kingdom Come'' #1, (May 1996)</ref>  He joins [[Superman]]'s revived [[Justice League]], and helps establish the "Gulag", a high tech prison for superhuman criminals.  Wally is one of the few superheroes that survives the [[United Nations]] nuclear attack on the Gulag.<ref>''Kingdom Come'' #4 (Aug 1996)</ref>

The sequel ''[[The Kingdom (comics)|The Kingdom]]'' provides more background on Wally's future history.  ''The Kingdom: Kid Flash'' #1 (Feb 1999) follows Wally's  twin children, Barry and [[Iris West]] (originally mentioned in Mark Waid's ''The Life Story of the Flash'', "written" by Iris Allen, where she describes her namesake in a positive light and Barry West as "a tragedy").  The twins have inherited their father's speed, but only Iris decides to become a superhero (as the new Kid Flash), while Barry is a slacker who uses his speed just to waste time.  Wally at first rebuffs Iris' attempts at impress him, as he is convinced only Barry has the right to be a Flash.  When Iris joins a team of second-generation heroes to travel into the past and confront [[Gog (DC Comics)|Gog]], Wally finally admits that she has earned the right to the name "Kid Flash."

===Dark Flash reality===
{{anchor|Walter West}}''The Flash'' vol. 2, #150–159 (1999–2000) introduces a version of Wally named '''Walter West''', also known as the Dark Flash, who appeared in the main DC universe after Wally and Linda were apparently killed in a fight with Abra Kadabra after he tried to dispose of Linda by sending her into Walter's reality, prompting Walter to travel back to Wally's world to take his place in recognition of his other self's sacrifice. This version of Wally is revealed to be an older, scarred, more powerful and experienced version from another reality within [[Hypertime]] (Although he only revealed his true identity to Jay Garrick, Donna Troy and Superman so that he could work with their various teams). It is revealed that this version of Wally was unable to save Linda from death at [[Kobra (DC comics)|Kobra]]'s hands. This made Walter a darker hero similar to Batman in ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'' storyline. After Walter's presence in the main DC Universe starts to cause other realities in Hypertime to bleed over into the main one, [[Superman]] and [[Wonder Woman]] force Walter to transverse Hypertime and return home. Although he leaves the main DC Universe, he appears to never make it back to his own reality. He seems to go from reality to reality with no success. After Hypertime was abandoned by DC, Walter West's continued existence becomes unclear.<ref>''The Flash'' Vol. 2, #150–159</ref> Dark Flash/Walter West appears as an alternate costume for Flash in the video game ''[[Justice League Heroes]]''.

===Elseworlds===
An [[Elseworlds]] tale in ''Superboy Annual'' #1 (1994) shows a Wally West that had lost the use of his legs and had them replaced with [[Bionics|bionic]] ones. With his artificial legs, Wally was not able to run at high speeds, though he could still move his arms at super-speed. This version of Wally died saving [[Green Lantern]] [[Hal Jordan]] from a yellow projectile.<ref>''Superboy Annual'' vol. 4, #1 (Dec 1994)</ref>

===''JLA: Another Nail''===
In ''[[JLA: Another Nail]]'', Wally West (as Kid Flash) makes a brief appearance when all time periods meld together. He is flying with Wonder Girl ([[Donna Troy]]).

==="Armageddon 2001"===
In the "[[Armageddon 2001]]" crossover, Wally's future shows he has married and fathered a son. All three move into the Witness Protection Program to escape a mobster that can discern secrets with a touch. His son gains his speed but not his protective aura. After defeating the mobster and his older rogue's gallery, Wally manages to donate all of his speed to his son, granting the much needed aura.<ref>''Flash Annual'' #4 (1991)</ref>

==="Flashpoint"===
In the alternate timeline of the "[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]" storyline, Wally West acts as an assistant and cameraman for his aunt Iris, who in this reality is a television reporter. Investigating Central City's hero, [[Captain Cold|Citizen Cold]], Wally discovers that his true identity is that of a former low-level criminal. Citizen Cold confronts him before he can reveal this information, and freezes him in a block of ice.<ref>''Flashpoint: Citizen Cold'' #1 (June 2011)</ref> Wally was a childhood friend of [[Pied Piper (comics)|Pied Piper]], who arrives at Wally's lair and discovers Wally is killed by Citizen Cold. Pied Piper takes Wally's place in uncovering evidence of Citizen Cold's true identity.<ref>''Flashpoint: Citizen Cold'' #2 (July 2011)</ref> Afterwards, a funeral is held for Wally by his aunt Iris along with her husband John.<ref>''Flashpoint: Kid Flash Lost'' #3 (August 2011)</ref>

==="Earth One"===
Wally is one of the children given powers from the Titans Project headed by [[Niles Caulder]]. Alongside [[Kole Weathers]] and [[Cassie Sandsmark]], Wally is one of the first Titans to work for Caulder, even considering him a father. After a struggle with the other experimented children, [[Vic Stone]], [[Terra (comics)|Tara Markov]], [[Beast Boy|Gar Logan]], [[Garth (comics)|Tempest]], [[Raven (comics)|Raven]], a repenting [[Deathstroke]] and the alien [[Starfire (Koriand'r)|Starfire]], Wally turns on Caulder. In this universe, he's takes on the name Impulse instead. <ref>Teen Titans: Earth One Vol. 2</ref>
