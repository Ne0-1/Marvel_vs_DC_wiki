==Publication history==
===Kid Flash===
[[Image:Kid Flash Wally.jpg|thumb|125px|left|Wally as Kid Flash. Artist: [[George Pérez]]]]
Wally West was created by [[John Broome (writer)|John Broome]] and [[Carmine Infantino]] and introduced in ''[[The Flash (comic book)|The Flash]]'' (vol. 1) #110 (1959). The character was the nephew of the existing Flash character's wife, [[Iris West Allen|Iris West]]. During a visit to the Central City [[police]] laboratory where [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] worked, the freak accident that gave Allen his powers repeated itself, bathing West in electrically-charged chemicals. Now possessing the same powers as The Flash, West donned a smaller sized copy of Barry Allen's Flash outfit and became the young crimefighter '''Kid Flash'''.

This costume was later altered (in ''The Flash'' (vol. 1) #135 (1963)) to one that would make him more visually distinctive. The original red was replaced with a costume that was primarily yellow with red leggings, gloves, and ear-pieces.

In addition to his appearances within the ''[[The Flash (comic book)|Flash]]'' title, the character was used as a member of the newly created [[Teen Titans]].<ref name="dc-ency"/> Sometime later, Wally contracted a mysterious disease: the more he used his speed powers, the faster his body would die. Wally subsequently retired from his hero role.

===The Flash===
During the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]], Barry gave his life to save the earth.<ref>''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' #7</ref> Initially unaware of this, Wally was coaxed by [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]] into assisting the heroes against the [[Anti-Monitor]]'s forces. During the final battle with the Anti-Monitor, Wally was struck by a blast of anti-matter energy, which put his disease into remission. In the aftermath of the conflict, Wally took on his fallen mentor's costume and identity.<ref>''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' #12</ref>

The decision by DC Comics' editorial staff to radically change their fictional universe saw a number of changes to the status quo of the character. Wally West became a less powerful new Flash than his predecessor.<ref name="dc-ency"/> For example, instead of being able to reach the speed of light, he can run just faster than that of sound (Crisis on Infinite Earths, issue 12 1985). Also, the character has to eat vast quantities of food to maintain his metabolism.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Mike Baron|Baron, Mike]] | Penciller = [[Jackson Guice|Guice, Jackson]] | Inker = Mahlstedt, Larry | Story = Flash | Title = The Flash | Volume = 2 | Issue = 1 | Date = June, 1987 | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = 1 | Panel = | ID = }}</ref>
[[Image:Wallyflash1.png|thumb|right|150px|''Flash'' (vol. 2) #1 (June 1987). Wally West holds his first title as the Modern Age Flash. Art by [[Jackson Guice]].]]
Those changes were quickly followed up and 1987 saw the publication of a new ''[[The Flash (comic book)|Flash]]'' comic, initially written by [[Mike Baron]]. These stories focused not only on the Flash's superhero exploits, but the state of Wally's wealth. West won a [[lottery]],<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Mike Baron|Baron, Mike]] | Penciller = [[Jackson Guice|Guice, Jackson]] | Inker = Mahlstedt, Larry | Story = Flash | Title = The Flash | Volume = 2 | Issue = 1 | Date = June, 1987 | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = 20 | Panel = 5 | ID = }}</ref> bought a large mansion,<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Mike Baron|Baron, Mike]] | Penciller = [[Jackson Guice|Guice, Jackson]] | Inker = Mahlstedt, Larry | Story = Heart... of Stone! | Title = The Flash | Volume = 2 | Issue = 2 | Date = July, 1987 | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = 22 | Panel = 3 | ID = }}</ref> and became something of a [[wikt:playboy|playboy]]. The character's finances and luck continued to ebb and wane until ''Flash'' (vol. 2) #62, when his playboy ways ended and his fortunes stabilized.

The 1990s also saw further modifications to the look of the character, with a modified uniform appearing in 1991.<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer =|Penciller =|Inker =|Story = The Fastest Man Alive!|Title = The Flash|Volume = 2|Issue = 50|Date = May, 1991|Publisher = DC Comics|Page = 22|Panel = 3|ID =}}</ref> This modified costume altered the visual appearance of the traditional Flash costume, with a belt made of two connecting lightning bolts meeting in a "V" at the front (where Allen's costume had a single bolt in a horizontal band), removal of the wings from the top of his boots, a change in the material of his costume, and opaque lenses added to the eyes of his cowl. This modified design utilized elements of the costume designed by artist [[Dave Stevens]] for the live action [[The Flash (TV series)|television series, ''The Flash'']].

A difficult encounter with a particularly vicious foe, the first [[Reverse-Flash]] (Eobard Thawne), also served to increase the speed of the character, forcing him to push past a psychological block he had placed on his powers; to prevent himself from truly 'replacing' Barry, Wally had subconsciously limited his speed so that he could never become his mentor's equal, but Thawne's bragging that he would become the true Flash forced Wally past this block as he feared Thawne replacing Barry more than he feared himself doing so.<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Mark Waid]]|Penciller = Greg Larocque|Inker =|Story = |Title = The Flash|Volume = 2|Issue = 79|Date = August, 1993|Publisher = DC Comics|Page =|Panel = 3|ID =}}</ref> After this encounter, he was Barry Allen's equal in speed, though he still had not been able to recover Barry's vibrational abilities.

Writer [[Mark Waid]] expanded on the character's powers thematically and further redefined the character by introducing the [[Speed Force]], an energy source that served as a pseudo-scientific explanation for his powers and that of other fictional [[speedster (fiction)|speedsters]] within the DC Universe. Using this concept as a basis, the character's ability to tap into the Speed Force was used to expand his abilities. The character was now able to lend speed to other objects and people (''Terminal Velocity'' and aftermath: ''Flash'' #95–101, 1994–1995) and create a costume directly out of Speed Force energy. Traditional powers such as the ability to vibrate through solid objects were also restored.

The 2000s saw writer [[Geoff Johns]] revitalize the character by introducing new versions of characters such as Zoom; making significant use of the [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues]]; and marrying the character to longtime girlfriend [[Linda Park (comics)|Linda Park]].<ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=118446 [Updated&#93; ALL FLASH #1 - NEWSARAMA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
[[Image:Flash_III.jpg|left|120px|thumb|Wally's new costume. Art by [[Ethan van Sciver]].]]
After Johns left the series, sales dropped significantly {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} and DC editorial decided that it was time for the status quo to change once more. Using the miniseries ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' as a narrative device, the character of Wally West and his family were seen leaving for an alternative reality. This allowed the character [[Bart Allen]] to become the fourth Flash and headline a relaunched third volume of the title, called ''The Flash: The Fastest Man Alive''.

The critical reaction to this new version of the character was mixed and the character was killed off in the final issue of the short-lived third volume of the Flash comic.<ref name="dc-ency"/> It was decided that Wally West should return, and the [[Justice League|JLA]]/[[Justice Society of America|JSA]] story "[[The Lightning Saga]]" was used to return the character to earth along with his wife and children, who appear to have aged several years.

The character next appeared in ''All Flash'' #1, seeking vengeance on those who had killed Bart Allen. This was followed by ''[[The Flash (comic book)|The Flash]]'' Volume 2, which resumed publication after the long hiatus with issue #231 (Oct. 2007). The series found the character struggling with trying to raise his two super powered twins, plagued by accelerated growth and their inexperience in the heroic game, a task made more difficult by Wally's unemployment, his inability to keep a steady job, and the mistrust of the League for his decision to bring two children into the fold. The series was canceled with issue #247 (February 2009).

In ''[[Final Crisis]]'', the character was reunited with [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]], who had returned to life. Recent interviews with ''[[The Flash: Rebirth]]'' artist [[Ethan Van Sciver]] have revealed that the character will adopt a newly-designed costume in the limited series that reintroduces Barry Allen as the Flash.<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=17542 CBR - CCI Spotlight: Ethan Van Sciver]</ref> The new costume is heavily inspired by the original changes made to the suit in Flash Vol. 2 issue #50 [cowl lenses, 'wingless' boots, the belt-line V-shape, and the darker red color of the suit], which were slipping in and out of usage when the character was drawn by different artists. Wally's costume has also been given a straight cowl which cuts off at the bottom of the nose, similar to Batman's. Wally has also gained a new symbol identical to the symbol worn by his animated counterpart in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' TV series, to further distinguish Wally from [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]].

==Powers and abilities==
{{In-universe|section|date=October 2009}}
Wally's primary superpower is his ability to be able to control the speed of which his body vibrates and to move at super speed, which he uses primarily to run at super-human velocities. This super speed is derived from his connection to the Speed Force: a vaguely defined extra-dimensional energy force from which most speedster heroes draw their powers (while the original Flash, Jay Garrick, can draw upon the Speed Force, Jay is one of the few speedsters that is a [[metahuman]] first, allowing him to keep a degree of super speed even when the Speed Force was cut off from the others).

While many hypothesize that the Speed Force is to an extent sentient, most utilize it primarily as just a tool, drawing upon it and using it when necessary; however, [[Max Mercury]], a veteran speedster, has been able to commune and communicate with it, making it his life's goal to unlocking its secrets with many calling him the "Zen Master of the Speed Force". The Speed Force serves as the ultimate measure of velocity in the DC Universe. They are often referred to in terms of barriers: Sound Barrier, Light Barrier, Time Barrier, Dimensional Barrier, and finally the Speed Force Barrier.

While most to all speedsters can make a connection and draw upon this force, West mainlines power from the Speed Force itself and cannot be cut off from the source, unlike the others (as of 2009, Barry Allen has recently departed from his extended time within the Speed Force itself essentially "coming back to life" and while it is not known whether he shares the unbreakable connection to the Speed Force that Wally does, it stands to reason that he might). This connection to the Speed Force allows him additional abilities than other speedsters such as lending and taking speed (which allows others to temporarily utilize the Speed Force in different ways ranging from becoming speedsters themselves to bolstering others metabolisms and healing abilities, allowing them to recover from injuries in a fraction of the normal time). Wally has also found a way to create a costume out of pure Speed Force energy, unlike other speedsters who use conventional costumes.

Like all Flashes, Wally is surrounded by a protective aura that allows him to resist the heat created by the friction of moving at super speed as well as other environmental consequences of moving at such velocities. It is not known how Wally is able to circumvent the damage moving at such great speeds would normally have on the environment, but it has been hypothesized that his protective aura allows him to "side step" such environmental consequences. Because of his powers and connection to the Speed Force, he can run at varying speeds for extended periods of time without needing rest or causing damage to his body. It is his connection to the Speed Force that constantly rejuvenates him while running making it so he does not literally feed upon his own body to generate the energy for super speed. Even so, as a consequence of his sped up metabolism, he finds it necessary to eat often and in great quantities to help supply the chemical energy needed to run like he does.

Using his abilities, Wally can run at such speed that he can run on water, create powerful vortexes with his arms or body, and vibrate at such speeds that he becomes invisible to the naked eye. Wally can also match the vibrational constant of solid objects and vibrate through them, passing his molecules through the spaces in between the atoms and molecules of the matter he's vibrating through. Unlike other speedsters, once he became one with the Speed Force some of his abilities changed, one of which is that the objects Wally is vibrating though become atomically unstable and explode a second or two later. While this has its drawbacks, Wally now tends to use this offensively in battle.

Wally can also use his speed in a variety of clever ways in combat from creating a powerful whirlwind/tornado lifting and trapping his foe (which, if he chooses, can be used to knock his opponent out by robbing them of their oxygen supply), to binding and trapping his foes with whatever's lying around before they have a chance to react, to pummeling them with hundreds of super speed punches in a few seconds. Like many of the more powerful speedsters, he is able to run at such speeds where he is able to travel through time, although being able to control and fine tune his temporal destinations is quote "extremely tricky".

Wally is quite possibly the fastest of all the Flashes, arguably even the fastest being that has ever existed and it has been remarked that Wally and Barry Allen are the only two speedsters that were fast enough to even outrun death.<ref>''Flash'' vol. 2 #101</ref> However, now that Barry Allen is back, his "Fastest Man Alive" title may be in dispute.

Over the years, Wally's speed has fluctuated from his career as Kid Flash, where he could run beyond the speed of light, to the beginning of his career as The Flash, in which he was limited to a top speed of approximately {{convert|700|mph|abbr=on|lk=on}}.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Mike Baron|Baron, Mike]] | Penciller = [[Jackson Guice|Guice, Jackson]] | Inker = Mahlstedt, Larry | Story = Flash | Title = The Flash | Volume = 2 | Issue = 1 | Date = June, 1987 | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = 5 | Panel = 5 | ID = }}</ref> He is now confirmed to be able to run beyond the speed of light.

==Allies and friends==
Wally's father, Rudolph West<ref>{{Cite comic| writer = [[Mike Baron|Baron, Mike]]| editor = Gold, Mike| penciller = [[Jackson Guice|Guice, Jackson]]| letterer = Haynie, Steve| inker = Torrance, Jack| colorist = Eiber, Shelley| story = Speed McGee| title = [[The_Flash_(comic_book)#Volume_2_.281987-2006.2C_2007-2008.29|The Flash]]| volume = 2| issue = 5| date = October 1987| publisher = [[DC Comics]]| location = 666 Fifth Avenue, New York, N. Y. 10103| page = 15| panel = 6}}</ref> (a [[Manhunter (comics)|Manhunter]] agent), was presumed deceased following an explosion in [[Cuba]] during the ''[[Invasion! (DC Comics)|Invasion]]'' series. He reappeared years later at, among other places, his ex-wife Mary West's (Wally's mother) second wedding. They both later attended Wally and Linda's wedding.

While they disagree regularly, Wally has developed an odd friendship/respect with [[Batman]], who has more than once made it clear that those feelings are mutual.

Like his predecessors, West is good friends with the [[Green Lantern]] of his time ([[Kyle Rayner]]). Wally also retained a close friendship with Kyle's predecessor Hal Jordan, who often looked out for Wally even while he was the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]]. His best friend is [[Dick Grayson]], who served with Wally on the Teen Titans as the first Robin and served as Wally's best man at his wedding.

The members of the New Teen Titans, the team Wally served on as Kid Flash, has reappeared several times throughout his life. Although they are not always in close contact with one another, the team considers each other family; Wally is no exception.

==Supporting cast==
Wally also has developed a very extensive supporting cast over the duration of his ongoing comic book series which began in 1987. It should be noted that a few of them are former villains and adversaries, such as '''[[Pied Piper (comics)|Pied Piper]]''', Speed Demon, and Chunk.

*'''Mary West''' - Wally's mother
*Dr. '''[[Tina McGee]]''' - a scientist/nutritionist with whom he had a brief romantic involvement<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Mike Baron|Baron, Mike]] | Penciller = [[Jackson Guice|Guice, Jackson]] | Inker = Mahlstedt, Larry | Story = Kill the Kilg%re! | Title = The Flash | Volume = 2 | Issue = 4 | Date = September, 1987 | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = | Panel = | ID = }}</ref>

*Connie Noleski - a model and girlfriend of Wally's in his early career as the Flash. She is currently married to Chunk.
*'''[[Chunk (comics)|Chester P. Runk]]''' a.k.a. '''Chunk''' - a brilliant physicist who became a walking black hole after a matter-transmitting machine he invented imploded during its first test
*Mason Trollbridge - the former kid sidekick of a hard-edged depression-era crimefighter known as the Clipper.

*'''[[Linda Park (comics)|Linda Park-West]]''' - originally introduced as a television news reporter, Wally began dating and eventually married her.
*'''[[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]]''' - the original Flash. Currently out of semi-retirement and a member of the Justice Society of America.
*'''[[Jesse Chambers|Jesse Quick]]''' - the daughter of [[Liberty Belle (comics)#Libby Lawrence|Liberty Belle]] and [[Johnny Quick]], Jesse is a second generation superhero and speedster like her father.
*'''[[Max Mercury]]''' - the Zen Master of Speed.
*'''[[Iris West Allen]]''' - Wally's aunt, returned from the future.
*'''[[Bart Allen|Kid Flash]]''' - Bart Allen, Barry and Iris Allen's grandson from the future. Originally codenamed Impulse. He was a member of the [[Teen Titans]] when he took on his cousin's old identity. Wally and Bart are first cousins once removed by marriage.
*'''Ashley Zolomon''' - current Rogue Profiler with the Keystone City PD, and former wife of [[Zoom (comics)|Hunter Zolomon]]

==Other versions==
*In [[John Byrne]]'s graphic novel [[Superman & Batman: Generations#Generations 2|''Superman & Batman: Generations 2'']], characters from the DC Universe are shown to age in real time. In this series, Wally appears as Kid Flash in 1964,<ref>''Generations 2'' #2, September 2001.</ref> which is the year he first appeared as a founding member of the [[Teen Titans]] (though in this version, he is a founding member of the [[Justice League]]). By 1986, Wally has retired and been replaced by the fourth Flash (Carrie Allen, the daughter of Barry Allen).<ref>''Generations 2'' #3, October 2001.</ref> Wally's son Jay West, in turn, replaces Carrie in 2008 to become the fifth Flash.<ref>''Generations 2'' #4, November 2001.</ref>

*''Flash Annual'' #7 shows a Flash who has become a superstar celebrity and film director.

*In [[Mark Waid]]'s ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'', Wally becomes an embodiment of the Speed Force, but at the cost of his humanity until the events of ''[[The Kingdom (comics)|The Kingdom]]''. His twin children, Barry and Iris West, inherit their father's speed, but only Iris decides to become a superhero, a new Kid Flash. In Waid's ''The Life Story of the Flash'', "written" by Iris Allen, she describes her namesake in a positive light and Barry West as "a tragedy."

*''Flash'' #150–159 introduces a version of Wally named '''Walter West''', also known as the '''Dark Flash'''. This version of Wally is revealed to be an older, more powerful and experienced version from another reality within [[Hypertime]]. It is revealed that this version of Wally was unable to save Linda from death at [[Kobra]]'s hands. This made Walter a darker hero similar to Batman in ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'' storyline. After Walter's presence in the main DC Universe starts to cause other realities in Hypertime to bleed over into the main one, Superman and [[Wonder Woman]] force Walter to transverse Hypertime and return home. Although he leaves the main DC Universe, he appears to never make it back to his own reality. He seems to go from reality to reality with no success. After Hypertime was abandoned by DC, Walter West's continued existence becomes unclear.

*An [[Elseworlds]] tale in ''Superboy Annual'' #1 shows a Wally West that had lost the use of his legs and had them replaced with [[bionics|bionic]] ones. With his artificial legs, Wally was not able to run at high speeds, though he could still move his arms at super speed. This version of Wally died saving [[Green Lantern]] [[Hal Jordan]] from a yellow projectile.

*In ''[[JLA: Another Nail]]'', Wally West (as Kid Flash) makes a brief appearance when all time periods meld together. He is flying with Wonder Girl ([[Donna Troy]]).
