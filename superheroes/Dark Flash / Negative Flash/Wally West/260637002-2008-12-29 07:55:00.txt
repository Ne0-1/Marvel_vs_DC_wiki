== Publication history ==

{{Expandsection|date=October 2008}}

[[Image:Kid Flash by Perez.jpg|thumb|125px|left|Wally as Kid Flash.  Artist: [[George Pérez]]]]

Wally West was created by [[John Broome (writer)|John Broome]] and [[Carmine Infantino]] and introduced in ''The Flash'' (vol. 1) #110 (1959). The character was the nephew of existing Flash character [[Iris West Allen|Iris West]]. During a visit to Central City [[police]] laboratory where Barry Allen worked, the freak accident that gave Allen his powers repeated itself, bathing West in electrically-charged chemicals. Now possessing the same powers as The Flash, West donned a smaller sized copy of Barry Allen's Flash outfit and became the young crimefighter '''Kid Flash'''.

This costume was quickly altered to one that would make him more visually distinctive. The original red was replaced with a costume that was primarily yellow with red leggings, gloves, and mask. 

In addition to his appearances within the Flash title, the character was used as a member of the newly created [[Teen Titans]].<ref name="dc-ency"/>

The decision by DC comics editorial staff to radically change their fictional universe saw a number of changes to the status quo of the character. The 1985 maxi-series [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]] saw the character adopt the identity of the Flash and his abilities become more limited.<ref name="dc-ency"/> Instead of being able to reach the speed of light, the [[speed of sound]] was now his upper limit and as a further restriction, the character had to eat vast quantities of food to maintain his metabolism.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Mike Baron|Baron, Mike]] | Penciller = [[Jackson Guice|Guice, Jackson]] | Inker = Mahlstedt, Larry | Story = Flash | Title = The Flash | Volume = 2 | Issue = 1 | Date = June, 1987 | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = 1 | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>

Those changes were quickly followed up and 1987 saw the publication of a new Flash comic, intitially written by [[Mike Baron]]. As long as his adventures as a superhero, the issue of money was a common theme during the series. West won a [[lottery]],<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Mike Baron|Baron, Mike]] | Penciller = [[Jackson Guice|Guice, Jackson]] | Inker = Mahlstedt, Larry | Story = Flash | Title = The Flash | Volume = 2 | Issue = 1 | Date = June, 1987 | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = 20 | Panel = 5 | ID = }}</ref> buys a large mansion,<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Mike Baron|Baron, Mike]] | Penciller = [[Jackson Guice|Guice, Jackson]] | Inker = Mahlstedt, Larry | Story = Heart... of Stone! | Title = The Flash | Volume = 2 | Issue = 2 | Date = July, 1987 | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = 22 | Panel = 3 | ID = }}</ref> and became something of a [[wikt:playboy|playboy]]. The character's finances and luck continued to ebb and wane until ''Flash'' (vol. 2) #62, when his playboy ways ended and his fortunes stabilized.

The 1990s also saw further modifications to the look of the character, with a modified uniform appearing in 1991. <ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = | Penciller =  | Inker = | Story = The Fastest Man Alive! | Title = The Flash | Volume = 2 | Issue = 50 | Date = May, 1991 | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = 22 | Panel = 3 | ID = }}</ref> This modified costume altered the visual appearance of the traditional flash costume with a belt made of two connecting lightning bolts, remove the wings from the top of his boots, alter the material of his costume, and add opaque lenses to the eyes of his cowl. This modified design utilized elements of the costume designed by artist [[Dave Stevens]] for the live action [[The Flash (TV series)|television series, ''The Flash'']]. 

[[Image:Wallyflash1.png|thumb|''Flash'' (vol. 2) #1 (June 1987).  Wally West holds his first title as the Modern Age Flash.  Art by [[Jackson Guice]].]]

A difficult encounter with a particularly vicious foe, the first [[Reverse-Flash]] (Eobard Thawne), also served to increase the speed of the character <ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Mark Waid]] | Penciller = [[Greg Larocque]] | Inker = | Story =  | Title = The Flash | Volume = 2 | Issue = 79 | Date = August, 1993 | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = | Panel = 3 | ID = }}</ref>. After this encounter, he was Barry Allen's equal in speed, though he still had not been able to recover Barry's vibrational abilities.

This theme of power was further expanded upon by the writer [[Mark Waid]] further redefined the character by introducing the [[Speed Force]], a energy source that served as a pseudo-scientific explanation for his powers and that of other fictional speedsters within the DC Universe. Using this concept as a basis, the character's ability to tap into the speed force was used to expand his abilities. The character was now able to lend speed to other objects and people (''Terminal Velocity'' and aftermath: ''Flash'' #95–101, 1994–1995) and create a costume directly out of Speed Force energy. Traditional powers such as the ability to vibrate through solid objects were also restored.

The 2000s saw Writer [[Geoff Johns]] revitalize the character by introducing new versions of characters such as Zoom and making significant use of the [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues]], marrying the character to longtime girlfriend [[Linda Park (comics)|Linda Park]], and introducing the concepts of fatherhood and family to the character by adding twin children to the supporting cast, Iris and Jai.<ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=118446 [Updated&#93; ALL FLASH #1 - NEWSARAMA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

[[Image:Westcrisis.PNG|thumb|Wally and his family disappear into the Speed Force.  Art by [[George Pérez]].]]

After the writer left the series, sales dropped significantly {{Fact|date=October 2008}} and DC editorial decided that it was time for the status quo to change once more. Using the mini-series ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' as a narrative device, the character of Wally West and his family were seen leaving for an alternative reality. This allowed the character of Impulse to become the fourth Flash and headline a relaunched third volume of the title. 

The critical reaction to this new version of the character was mixed and the character was killed off in the final issue of the short-lived third volume of the Flash Comic.<ref name="dc-ency"/> It was decided that Wally West should be resurrected and the [[Justice League|JLA]]/[[Justice Society of America|JSA]] "[[The Lightning Saga]]" were used to return the character is returned to earth along with his wife and children who appear to have aged several years. 

The character next appeared in ''All Flash'' #1, seeking vengeance on those who had killed Bart Allen. This was followed by Flash v3, which resuming publications after the long hiatus. The series found the character struggling with trying to raise his two super powered twins, plagued by accelerated growth and their inexperience in the heroic game; a task made more difficult by Wally's unemployment, and inability to keep a steady job, and the mistrust of the League for his decision to bring two children in the fold. The series also once again limited the character's speed, returning it to a maximum limit of the speed of sound. 

In ''[[Final Crisis]]'', Wally is shocked to see his uncle [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] returned to life. After being reunited in an attempt to stop the god-bullet from killing the [[New Gods|New God]] [[Orion (comics)|Orion]], Wally and Barry face down hordes of people possessed by the [[Anti-Life Equation]].

Recent interviews with ''[[The Flash: Rebirth]]'' artist [[Ethan Van Sciver]] have revealed that Wally will be taking on a new costume and new identity in the limited series that reintroduces Barry Allen as the Flash.<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=17542 CBR - CCI Spotlight: Ethan Van Sciver]</ref>

==Powers==
{{in-universe}}
Wally's primary superpower is his speed.  Over the years, this has fluctuated from his career as Kid Flash, where he could approach the speed of light, to the beginning of his career as The Flash, in which he was limited to a top speed of approximately {{convert|700|mph|abbr=on|lk=on}},<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Mike Baron|Baron, Mike]] | Penciller = [[Jackson Guice|Guice, Jackson]] | Inker = Mahlstedt, Larry | Story = Flash | Title = The Flash | Volume = 2 | Issue = 1 | Date = June, 1987 | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = 5 | Panel = 5 | ID = }}</ref> leading to near retirement and returning to college before the death of Barry Allen.  In recent years, with the knowledge and mastery of the Speed Force at his disposal, Wally has managed to surpass the speed of light, though it is tough to do and can lead to being trapped in the Speed Force.  More recently, he has again lost his absolute mastery of the Speed Force, in exchange for his children's life and safety, returning to his lowest speed.

As Kid Flash, Wally had the ability to control the vibration of his molecules to the degree that he could vibrate through solid objects and traverse other dimensions and times.  He lost this ability when he became The Flash, and regained this power in later years with the added twist that vibrating through objects could cause them to explode; apparently, this later version of the power passed kinetic energy into the molecular structure of the object he vibrated through, and the object would explode from the charge.  Several years of training granted him better fine-control over his energy output, albeit lacking the full mastery of Barry Allen.

Other applications of superspeed:
*Does not leave a scent trail that a [[bloodhound]] can track, even at the "low" speed of 700 mph.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Mike Baron|Baron, Mike]] | Penciller = [[Jackson Guice|Guice, Jackson]] | Inker = Mahlstedt, Larry | Story = Red Trinity | Title = Flash | Volume = 2 | Issue = 7 | Date = December, 1987 | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = 6 | Panel = 1 | ID = }}
</ref>
*Being able to run across the surface of large bodies of water--moving so fast that he does not break the [[surface tension]] of the water as he runs.
*Overcoming gravity by running up and down vertical surfaces.
*Creating wind vortices by running in circles or rotating his arms and legs.
*"Lending" velocity to objects or people already in motion 
*"Stealing" the speed of others and utilizing it himself.
*Vibrating his molecules so fast he can travel through objects such as walls.
*Use of his incredibly fast reflexes in order to withstand powerful blows.
*Gaining infinite force or weight as he approaches light speed, resulting in extremely heavy blows.
*Creating after-images of himself.
*Vibrate so that light does not reflect off him sufficiently, rendering him invisible.<ref>''[[Identity Crisis (comics)|Identity Crisis]]'' #2</ref>
*"Accelerated Healing" the ability to speed up his natural healing process.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Mike Baron|Baron, Mike]] | Penciller = [[Jackson Guice|Guice, Jackson]] | Inker = Mahlstedt, Larry | Story = Flash | Title = The Flash | Volume = 2 | Issue = 1 | Date = June, 1987 | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = 19 | Panel = 4 | ID = }}</ref>
*Talking at a superspeed whereas only other speedsters (like [[Jesse Chambers|Jesse Quick]], [[Max Mercury]], etc.) can receive, interpret, and return communication at the same velocity. 

As with most superspeedsters, Wally possesses an "aura" which protects him (and whatever he carries) from heat and air friction when he travels at high velocities.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Mike Baron|Baron, Mike]] | Penciller = [[Jackson Guice|Guice, Jackson]] | Inker = Mahlstedt, Larry | Story = Kill the Kilg%re! | Title = The Flash | Volume = 2 | Issue = 4 | Date = September, 1987 | Publisher = DC Comics | Page = 20 | Panel = 3 | ID = }}</ref>  He also has a slight amount of invulnerability with this "aura".  The activity of his "aura" is actually what makes him able to employ his powers, as running at top speed with a weakened aura is enough to shock his body in cramps and seizures.

==Villains==
{{main|Rogues (comics)}}
Like his predecessor before him, Wally has accumulated a [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues' Gallery]] as well.  Many of his uncle's old rogues are still around, except for [[Captain Boomerang]] (George "Digger" Harkness, who was killed during ''[[Identity Crisis (comics)|Identity Crisis]]''), the [[Trickster (comics)|Trickster]] (James Jesse, who was killed by [[Deadshot]] while on the run with the [[Pied Piper (comics)|Pied Piper]]) and the first Mirror Master (Samuel Scudder, who was killed during the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' by [[Krona (comics)|Krona]]).

==Allies and friends==

Wally's father, Rudolph West (a [[Manhunter (comics)|Manhunter]] agent), was presumed deceased following an explosion in [[Cuba]] during the ''[[Invasion! (DC Comics)|Invasion]]'' series.  He reappeared years later at, among other places, his ex-wife Mary West's (Wally's mother) second wedding.  They both later attended Wally and Linda's wedding.

While they disagree regularly, Wally has a developed an odd friendship/respect with [[Batman]], whom has more than once made it clear that those feelings are mutual. 

Like his predecessors, West is good friends with the [[Green Lantern]] of his time ([[Kyle Rayner]]).  Wally also retained a close friendship with Kyle's predecessor Hal Jordan, who often looked out for Wally even while he was [[Spectre (comics)|the Spectre]].  His best friend is perhaps [[Dick Grayson]], who served with Wally on the Teen Titans as the first Robin.

==Supporting cast==
Wally also has developed a very extensive supporting cast over the duration of his ongoing comic book series which began in 1987.  It should be noted that a few of them are former villains and adversaries, such as '''[[Pied Piper (comics)|Pied Piper]]''', Speed Demon, and Chunk.

*'''Mary West''' - Wally's mother
*Dr. '''[[Tina McGee]]''' - a scientist/nutritionist with whom he had a brief romantic involvement<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Mike Baron|Baron, Mike]] | Penciller = [[Jackson Guice|Guice, Jackson]] | Inker = Mahlstedt, Larry | Story = Kill the Kilg%re! | Title = The Flash | Volume = 2 | Issue = 4 | Date = September, 1987 | Publisher = DC Comics | Page =  | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>
*Dr. Jerry McGee a.k.a. Speed Demon a.k.a. Speed McGee - Tina's (formerly ex-) husband and former superspeed villain<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Mike Baron|Baron, Mike]] | Penciller = [[Jackson Guice|Guice, Jackson]] | Inker = Torrance, Jack | Story = Speed McGee | Title = Flash | Volume = 2 | Issue = 5 | Date = October 1987 | Publisher = DC Comics | Page =  | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>
*Connie Noleski - a model and girlfriend of Wally's in his early career as the Flash.  She is currently married to Chunk.
*'''[[Chunk (comics)|Chester P. Runk]]''' a.k.a. '''Chunk''' - a brilliant physicist who became a walking black hole after a matter-transmitting machine he invented imploded during its first test
*Mason Trollbridge - the former kid sidekick of a hard-edged depression-era crimefighter known as the Clipper.
*'''[[Pied Piper (comics)|Pied Piper]]''' - one of Barry Allen's former Rogues.
*'''[[Linda Park (comics)|Linda Park-West]]''' - originally introduced as a television news reporter, Wally began dating and eventually married her.
*'''[[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]]''' - the original Flash.  Currently out of semi-retirement and a member of the Justice Society of America.
*'''[[Jesse Chambers|Jesse Quick]]''' - the daughter of [[Liberty Belle (comics)#Libby Lawrence|Liberty Belle]] and [[Johnny Quick]], Jesse is a second generation superhero and speedster like her father.
*'''[[Max Mercury]]''' - the Zen Master of Speed.
*'''[[Iris West Allen]]''' - Wally's aunt, returned from the future.
*'''[[Bart Allen|Kid Flash]]''' - Bart Allen, Barry and Iris Allen's grandson from the future.  Originally codenamed Impulse.  He was a member of the [[Teen Titans]] when he took on his cousin's old identity.  Wally and Bart are second cousins by marriage, adoption, two-way time travel, and cloning.
*'''Ashley Zolomon''' - current Rogue Profiler with the Keystone City PD, and former wife of [[Zoom (comics)|Hunter Zolomon]]

==Other versions==

In John Byrne's graphic novel [[Superman & Batman: Generations#Generations 2|''Superman & Batman: Generations 2'']], characters from the DC Universe are shown to age in real time.  In ''Generations 2'' #2 (September 2001) Wally appears as Kid Flash in 1964, which is the year he first appeared as a founding member of the [[Teen Titans]] (though in this version, he is a founding member of the [[Justice League]]).  By 1986, as shown in issue #3 (October 2001), Wally has retired and been replaced by the fourth Flash (Carrie Allen, the daughter of Barry Allen).  Wally's son Jay West, in turn, replaces Carrie in 2008 to become the fifth Flash (''Generations 2" #4, November 2001).

''Flash Annual'' #7 shows a Flash who has become a superstar celebrity and film director. 

In [[Mark Waid]]'s ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'' and ''[[The Kingdom (comics)|The Kingdom]]'' an alternate version of the twins are named Barry and Iris West and inherit their father's speed, but only Iris decides to become a superhero, a new Kid Flash.  In Waid's ''The Life Story of the Flash'', "written" by Iris Allen, she describes her namesake in a positive light and Barry West as "a tragedy."  However, the timeline has since been altered.
