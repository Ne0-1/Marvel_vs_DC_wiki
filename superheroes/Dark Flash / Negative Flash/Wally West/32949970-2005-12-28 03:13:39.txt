'''Wally West''' is a fictional character in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|Universe]], and the current (third) [[Flash (comics)|Flash]].

Wally West was the nephew of Iris West and [[Barry Allen]]'s nephew by marriage, and was introduced in ''The Flash'' (1st series) #110 (1959).  When West was about 10 years old, he was visiting his uncle's [[police]] laboratory, and the freak accident that gave Allen his powers repeated itself, bathing West in electrically-charged chemicals.  Now possessing the same powers as his uncle, West donned a copy of his uncle's outfit and became the young crimefighter '''Kid Flash'''.

He soon adopted a slightly different, yellow-and-red outfit with his hair exposed, and became a founding member of the [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]], along with fellow sidekicks [[Nightwing|Robin]] and [[Aqualad]].  Always something of a straight-shooter from rural [[United States|America]], Kid Flash sometimes felt out of place alongside more flamboyant heroes such as [[Speedy (comics)|Speedy]] and [[Donna Troy|Wonder Girl]].

As a young adult, West found his powers to be failing and even doing damage to his body, and he retired from crimefighting until a cure could be found.  But he was called to action again by the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', in which his uncle Barry was killed.  As a side effect of the energies he was exposed to during that adventure, West's powers stabilized.  However, he could no longer run at the extraordinary speeds of his uncle, but was limited to the [[speed of sound]], and had to eat vast quantities of food to maintain his metabolism.

Despite these handicaps, West resumed his career, though he retired his own costume and adopted the costume and name of the Flash to honor his uncle.  He did however make his identity public knowledge to keep from replacing Barry Allen in the minds of the public.  A short time later, West won a [[lottery]], bought a large mansion, and became something of a playboy.  He joined [[Justice League Europe]] early in his career as Flash and also later joined the reformed [[Justice League]].  Like his powers at the time, West's finances and luck continued to ebb and wane until ''Flash'' (2nd series) #62, when his playboy ways also ended and his fortunes stabilized.

Over the next few years, West learned several things about his powers.  First, it was suggested that Allen had not actually been human after gaining his own powers, but was a powerful energy force of which West used only a fraction.  As Allen's career wound down and after he died, West had access to only a fraction of the energy.  Later, West discovered that in fact Allen was a conduit to the [[Speed Force]], an extradimensional energy force that West and other speedsters also tapped.  West had been holding back from fully embracing the Speed Force again for fear of replacing his uncle in the minds of the public.

A difficult encounter with a particularly vicious foe, the first [[Reverse-Flash]] (Eobard Thwane), who was bent on destroying Allen's memory finally motivated West to use his abilities to their fullest potential.  As a result, West gained even greater speeds than previously seen in his days as Kid Flash.  After discovering and being absorbed by the Speed Force, returning to earth and battling the student/priest of speed, Savitar, West gained some additional powers from the [[Speed Force]], and even more powers after meeting an alternate version of himself, Walter West (the Dark Flash), via [[Hypertime]] travel.  Until West's accumulation of new powers circa issues #90 and up, some of his uncle's abilities continued to elude West; most notably, the power to precisely travel through time, especially with the ease which Allen accomplished these feats.  More recently, West has on several occasions used his speed to break time and even dimensional barriers.  The abilities that West has not been able to duplicate seem to coincide with Barry Allen's unique and complete control of his molecular structure.

West married [[journalist]] and longtime girlfriend, [[Linda Park (comics)|Linda Park]]. After an attack on Linda by a new Reverse-Flash, [[Zoom (comics)|Zoom]], caused a miscarriage, West regretted the public knowledge of his identity.  [[The Spectre]] ([[Hal Jordan]]) wiped the knowledge of the Flash's secret identity from everyone's mind, including West's.  He began working as a mechanic for the [[Keystone City]] Police, a job that reminded him of Barry Allen (whom he only remembered as a police scientist).  Eventually, [[Batman]] deduced the truth and restored West's memory.  The truth has also been revealed to West's friends in the heroic community, and to Linda Park, who found it difficult to deal with and took some time away from her husband.  They are now back together.  Due to another fight with Zoom, the events leading to Linda's miscarriage were altered, and the miscarriage was erased.  Linda soon after delivered twins.

Like his predecessor before him, Wally has accumulated a [[Enemies of the Flash|Rogues' Gallery]] as well.  Many of his uncle's old rogues are still around, except for Captain Boomerang I (who was killed during ''[[Identity Crisis]]'') and Mirror Master I (who was killed during the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''.)

Some of these newer rogues include:
*'''[[Blacksmith (comics)|Blacksmith]]''' - head of the Network with the ability to fuse metal with flesh
*'''[[Captain Boomerang#Owen Mercer|Captain Boomerang]] II''' (Owen Mercer) - son of the original Captain Boomerang.  Took over his father's name and gimmick after his death.  Possesses some superspeed, possibly from his mother, recently revealed to be Meloni Thawne, mother of Bart Allen.
*'''[[Double Down (comics)|Double Down]]''' - has a cursed deck of mystical playing cards embedded in himself.  They can be thrown and are razor sharp.
*'''[[Girder (comics)|Girder]]''' - superstrong and superdurable, made of steel.
*'''[[Magenta (comics)|Magenta]]''' - uses magnetism-based powers.
*'''[[Mirror Master#Evan McCulloch|Mirror Master]] III''' (Evan McCulloch) - uses the original Mirror Master's equipment.
*'''[[Murmur (DC Comics)|Murmur]]''' - a serial killer who developed the "frenzy virus", an [[anthrax]]-like virus based on his own blood.
*'''[[Plunder (comics)|Plunder]]''' - a bounty hunter from a mirror universe. His analogue in this world is the Keystone City PD cop Jared Morillo.
*'''[[Tar Pit (comics)|Tar Pit]]''' - mind trapped in invulnerable [[asphalt]].
*'''[[Thinker (DC Comics)#Thinker IV|Thinker]] IV''' - A sentinent computer program in hologram form based on the brain patterns of the original Thinker.
*'''[[Trickster (comics)|Trickster]] II''' (Axel Walker) - based on the original Trickster.
*'''[[Zoom (comics)|Zoom]]''' - exists on a separate timeline from the world. This gives the illusion of superspeed.

Recently the tensions within the ranks of the rogues gallery have set off the "Rogues War", this war has been complicated with the intervention of both Zooms.  This war has yet to be resolved.

Like his predecessors, West has a friendship with the [[Green Lantern]] of his time ([[Kyle Rayner]]).

His best friend is Dick Grayson, Nightwing and former Robin.  His father, Rudolph West, (a [[Manhunter (comics)|Manhunter]] agent) died in an explosion in Cuba defending the land during the [[Invasion (comics)|Invasion]] series.
