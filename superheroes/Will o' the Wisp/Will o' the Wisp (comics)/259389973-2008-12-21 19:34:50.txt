'''Will o' the Wisp''' is a [[fictional character]], a  [[comic book]] [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Universe]].  He is a [[physicist]] who gained control over the [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] attraction between his body's molecules, allowing him to adjust his [[density]] (like the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]]). He is most often a foe of [[Spider-Man]].

==Fictional character biography==
Jackson Arvad was born in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]].  A former employee at [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon Oil]], he worked in the division dedicated to electromagnetic research. Under constant pressure of being fired, Arvad spent lots of time furthering his work on electromagnetism, getting little sleep in the process. He eventually ended up falling asleep on the job, unable to save himself from a laboratory accident that would change his life.

He ended up being caught in the electromagnetic field of a device he was working on, the device weakening the electromagnetic attraction between the molecules in his body, threatening his life. When his boss learned of the accident, he decided to let Arvad die, but not before he demanded any scientific applications the device would've had.

However, Arvad was able to save himself when he learned he was suddenly able to control the level of attraction between his body's molecules. 

He attempted to kill his employer, [[Jonas Harrow]] multiple times but was stopped each time by either Spider-Man or inadvertently by [[Tarantula (Marvel Comics)|Tarantula]].  Finally, he opted to simply hypnotize the man into confessing his crimes to the police.

===Civil War===
Years later, Will o' the Wisp would show up in league with the [[Scarecrow (Marvel Comics)|Scarecrow]] and later the [[Molten Man]] as part of the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon's]] plot to get revenge on Peter Parker after unmasking during [[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]].<ref>''Civil War: War Crimes''</ref>

He was recently seen among an army of supervillains organized by [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] that was captured by [[Iron Man]] and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents.<ref>''Sensational Spider-Man'' #29-31</ref> 

In ''[[The Punisher War Journal]]'' (2nd series) #4, the Punisher blew up a bar where Will o' the Wisp was attending a wake for [[Stilt-Man]], after poisoning the guests.  It was later mentioned in ''[[She-Hulk]]'' (volume 2) #17 that "they all had to get their [[Gastric lavage|stomachs pumped]] and be treated for [[Burn#Classification by degree|third-degree burns]]."

==Powers and abilities==
Will-O’-The-Wisp has the ability to control the electro-magnetic particles that make up his body, and can make part, or all, of his body intangible or rock hard similar to the synthezoid Vision. In addition, he also has super strength which at his max density enables him to lift nearly 12 tons. Also, he has the ability of flight, and at high speeds, Will-O’-The-Wisp appears to be nothing more than a glowing sphere. Will-O’-The-Wisp can also mesmerize people for a short period of time.
