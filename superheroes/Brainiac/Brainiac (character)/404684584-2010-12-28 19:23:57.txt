'''Brainiac''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. The character first appeared in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #242 (July 1958), and was created by [[Otto Binder]] and [[Al Plastino]].

An [[extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] [[Android (robot)|android]], Brainiac is a principal foe of [[Superman]], responsible for shrinking [[Kandor]], the [[capital city]] of Superman's home planet [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]] which has since been restored. Due to complex storylines involving [[time travel]], [[cloning]], and revisions of DC's [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]], several variations of Brainiac have appeared. Most incarnations of Brainiac depict him as a green-skinned [[humanoid]] who is bald, save for a set of [[diode]]s protruding from his skull.

The character is the origin of [[wikt:brainiac|the informal eponymous word]] which means "genius".<ref>{{Cite book | editor1-last=Soanes | editor1-first=Catherine | editor2-last=Stevenson | editor2-first=Angus | title=The Concise Oxford English Dictionary: Eleventh Edition | location=[[England]] | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | date=August 2008 | isbn=978-0199548415}}</ref> The name itself is a [[portmanteau]] of the words ''brain'' and ''maniac'', with influence from [[ENIAC]], the name of an early computer.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.word-detective.com/2007/07/31/brainiac | title=Braniac | work=The Word Detective | date=July 31, 2007}}</ref> In 2009, Brainiac was ranked as [[IGN]]'s 17th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/17.html | title=Top 100 Comic Book Villains | work=[[IGN]]}}</ref>

==Publication history==
===Silver age===
[[Image:Action Comics 242.png|185px|thumb|left|Brainiac's first appearance in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #242. Art by [[Curt Swan]] and Stan Kaye.]]
First appearing in ''Action Comics'' #242 ([[1958#July|July 1958]]), Brainiac was a bald, green-skinned [[humanoid]] who arrived on [[Earth]] and shrank various cities, including [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], storing them in bottles with the intent of using them to restore Bryak, the planet he ruled. He protected himself from Superman using an ultra-force barrier which not even Superman could break through. While fighting Brainiac, Superman discovered that the villain had previously shrunk the Kryptonian city of Kandor. He was able to restore the Earth cities to full size, but the Kandorians sacrificed their restoration to help him. Superman stored the city in his [[Fortress of Solitude]], vowing to return the natives to full size.

Brainiac's legacy was revealed in ''Action Comics'' #276 (May 1961), in a ''[[Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' back-up story. This story introduced a green-skinned, blond-haired teenager named Querl Dox, or '''[[Brainiac 5]]''', who claimed to be Brainiac's 30th century descendant. Unlike his ancestor, Brainiac 5 used his "twelfth-level intellect" for the forces of good and joined the Legion alongside [[Supergirl]], with whom he fell in love. His home planet was given variously as Yod or [[Colu]].

In ''Superman'' (vol. 1) #167 (February 1964), it was [[retcon]]ned that Brainiac was a machine created by the Computer Tyrants of Colu as a spy. Explaining the 1961 introduction of Brainiac's descendant Brainiac 5, his biological disguise included an adopted "son", a young Coluan boy who was given the name "[[Brainiac 2]]". In the same issue, the [[comic book letter column|letter column]] contained a "special announcement" explaining that the change in the characterization of Brainiac was being made "in deference" to the "Brainiac Computer Kit", a toy computer created by [[Edmund Berkeley]] which predated the creation of the comic book character.<ref>{{Cite comic | story=Metropolis Mailbag (column) | title=[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]] | issue=167 | date=February 1964 | publisher=DC Comics | location=New York | url=http://www.vintagecomputer.net/brainiac/superman_Feb_number167_mailbag.jpg}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | last=Engblom | first=Mark | title=Which Came First? Brainiac or BRAINIAC? | url=http://comiccoverage.typepad.com/comic_coverage/2009/04/which-came-first-brainiac-or-brainiac.html | date=April 28, 2009 | work=Comic Coverage | accessdate=August 20, 2009}}</ref>

It was later revealed{{When|date=December 2010}} that the boy's name was '''[[Vril Dox]]''', and that he went on to lead a revolt against the Computer Tyrants. It was in this story that Brainiac first appeared with a distinctive gridwork of red [[diode]]s across his head, which later stories explained as the "electric terminals of his sensory nerves".{{Issue|date=March 2010}} This would remain his appearance throughout the 1960s and 1970s. In Justice League of America #136 he is one of King Kull's henchmen with which he plans to wipe out humanity on all three Earths. The Green Lanterns, The Flashes, Ibis and Mercury headed to Earth-One, where Mister Atom and Brainiac were attacking a futuristic model city called Tomorrow. A strange black feedback aura prevented the heroes from attacking the giant Mr. Atom directly, and the Green Lanterns were able to trace the source of the aura to Brainiac’s spaceship, hovering above the domed city. While Ibis and both Green Lanterns went to stop Brainiac, the three speedsters worked overtime repairing the damage and saving the people that Mr. Atom’s rampage was endangering. The Green Lantern of Earth-Two worked at saving people who were falling through the air (which made the Earth-One Green Lantern believe momentarily that Doctor Destiny, an enemy of the Justice League, was involved), the Green Lantern of Earth-One passed through the side of Brainiac’s ship and was subjected to the “Barium Effect”, which transformed him into a living skeleton. Ibis showed up in time to stop Brainiac from killing the hero, turning the robot dictator's own weapon against him. Ibis also changed Green Lantern back to normal, and the two heroes destroyed Brainiac’s machines, causing the black aura around Mr. Atom to disappear.

====30th century (Pre-Crisis)====
At some indeterminate point in time, Brainiac fled into the 30th century. Developing the ability to absorb and manipulate massive amounts of stellar energy, he remade himself as "[[Pulsar Stargrave]]".<ref>As revealed in ''Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes'' #226-227 (April – May 1977)</ref> He became a powerful enemy of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]], and once masqueraded as Brainiac 5's biological father.<ref>''Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes'' #224, #226 (February / April 1977)</ref> In current continuity, Brainiac's connection to Pulsar Stargrave remains an open question, one even Brainiac 5 has yet to resolve.<ref>[[Adventure Comics#Revival|''Adventure Comics'' (vol. 2)]] #9 (Late May 2010)</ref>

===Bronze age===
In the 1980s, [[DC Comics]] attempted to re-define several aspects of its ''Superman'' series in order to boost sagging sales. At the same time [[Lex Luthor]] acquired his green-and-purple battlesuit, Brainiac was re-envisioned (under the auspices of writer [[Marv Wolfman]]). In ''Action Comics'' #544 (June 1983), Brainiac had constructed a giant, artificial, computer-controlled planet and used it in his latest attempt to destroy Superman; unfortunately, his defeat at the hands of the Man of Steel left him trapped at the center of the planet, unable to escape. He was forced to make a nearby star explode in a [[nova]] in order to destroy the machine-world and allow him to recreate his form. His new body (designed by [[Ed Hannigan]]) had the appearance of a [[skeleton]] of living metal with a grey (sometimes iridescent), [[honeycomb]]-patterned "braincase."<ref>''Who's Who in the DC Universe''{{Issue|date=October 2010}}</ref> He also created a [[starship]] to house his new body which was actually an extension of himself; the ship was shaped like his own skull, with metal tentacles dangling from it that he could manipulate at will. Brainiac retained this appearance until after the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''.

As part of Brainiac's recreation, Wolfman added a new aspect to Brainiac's personality. During his regeneration, Brainiac experienced a vision in which he saw Superman in the guise of a god-like "Master Programmer" who was responsible for a massive conspiracy to destroy Brainiac and keep him from achieving perfection and domination of the universe. From this vision, Brainiac concluded that it was necessary for him to destroy the Master Programmer in order to achieve his goal; therefore, his ultimate goal was to destroy Superman, whom he saw as the Master Programmer's "angel of death." This new, insane motivation recast Brainiac as a cold-hearted, ruthless machine whose "mind has absorbed all the knowledge this universe has to offer", and he appeared several times in this aspect until he was rewritten. Further revisions of Brainiac's history removed the "Master Programmer" aspect of his personality entirely.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

===Modern age===
[[Image:Vridoxpost.png‎|185px|left|thumb|Brainiac's second post-Crisis incarnation.]]
In the post-''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' [[DC Universe]], Brainiac's history was completely rewritten. The post-''Crisis'' version of Brainiac was now a radical Coluan scientist called Vril Dox who, having attempted to overthrow the Computer Tyrants of Colu, was sentenced to death. In his last moments before disintegration, his consciousness was attracted light years away to Milton Fine, a human sideshow mentalist who worked under the alias "Brainiac".<ref name="dc-ency">{{Cite book | last=Greenberger | first=Robert | author-link=Robert Greenberger | contribution=Brainiac | editor-last=Dougall | editor-first=Alastair | title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page=61 | publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] | location=[[London]] | year=2008 | isbn=0-7566-4119-5}}</ref> Needing cranial fluid to maintain his possession of Fine, Dox went on a murder spree. He discovered that Fine had genuine [[psychic]] powers, which he frequently wielded against Superman.<ref>''[[Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]]'' #438 (March 1988)</ref>

Brainiac was later captured by Lex Luthor, but used his powers to take control of [[LexCorp]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Under Brainiac's mental domination, LexCorp scientists restored his Coluan form. The [[diode]]s in Brainiac's head now increased and stabilized his mental powers and also allowed him direct access to computer banks. He continued to plague Superman, using a combination of mental powers and computer control.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} On one occasion, Brainiac even returned to his pre-''Crisis'' incarnation's city-shrinking tactics.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

In the crossover story ''[[Invasion! (DC Comics)|Invasion!]]'', it was revealed that, prior to its dispersion, the Computer Tyrants allowed Dox to clone a lab assistant, Vril Dox II, who would go on to form [[L.E.G.I.O.N.]], and (although he never uses the name) is the post-''Crisis'' version of Brainiac 2.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

====''Panic in the Sky''====
In the early 1990s, Brainiac returned in the "Panic in the Sky" storyline. He seized control of [[Warworld]] and managed to convince [[Maxima (comics)|Maxima]] to assist him.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Then he brainwashed [[Supergirl (Matrix)]] and the alien warrior [[Draaga]] before capturing [[Metron (comics)|Metron]] and setting off for Earth. [[Orion (comics)|Orion]] and [[Lightray]] of [[New Genesis]] attacked Warworld, but they were quickly taken down by Maxima and Supergirl. Brainiac sent the mental image of the [[New Gods]] captured to Superman in order to taunt him, and he also sent his "headship" (a green-hued variant of the pre-''Crisis'' skull-like ship) to Earth in a [[punitive expedition]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

These acts prompted Superman to go on the offense rather than wait for the inevitable invasion. He gathered a coalition of most of the world's superheroes and launched a preemptive strike at Warworld before it could arrive on Earth.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} A small, elite force was left behind for any scouting forces that would be sent ahead. Superman led the attack on Warworld, where Supergirl and Draaga managed to shrug off their brainwashing and rally to Superman (although Draaga was killed in the fighting). Maxima would shortly switch sides in the fighting too, perceiving Brainiac as the true villain at last. Brainiac briefly took control of some of Earth's heroes, but it was not enough to turn the tide. [[Flash (comics)|Flash]], Maxima, and the [[Metal Men]] attacked him in his lair, where Maxima managed to [[lobotomy|lobotomize]] him (but was stopped short of killing him). His vegetative body was taken back to New Genesis for observation.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

====Dead again====
Brainiac would next emerge about a year after the death and return of Superman. After a dead body appeared in Superman's tomb, prompting the world to wonder if the Superman who was flying around was the original or a fake, Superman began to track down all of his foes who might be capable of such a hoax.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} While Brainiac was initially eliminated as a suspect, he soon turned out to be the true culprit, creating the illusion even in his comatose state on [[New Genesis]]. He managed to revive himself there and returned to Earth in secret. While hidden, he created even more delusions, causing Superman to question his very sanity before realizing who was really at fault.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Superman and Brainiac squared off in Metropolis, where Superman taunted the evil villain, claiming that at heart he was really just Milton Fine, a cheap entertainer. This caused some break in Brainiac's mind where Fine's personality reasserted himself, burying Brainiac's. Fine was then escorted off to a psychiatric facility.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Brainiac's mind reemerged at the hospital. Brainiac's new plan was to lure Superman there where he managed to pull a "[[Mind uploading|mind switch]]" on the Man of Steel.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Brainiac's mind was put in Superman's body, while Superman's mind was put into the body of a 13 year old mental patient who thought that he was Superman. Brainiac, frustrated with the lack of mental powers Superman's body afforded, came up with a plan to download a vast amount of knowledge into the minds of all Metropolis citizens, thereby using them as a giant storage device.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} To that end, he built a new lair in the center of the city and sealed it off from the outside. Superman, in the body of the child, managed to infiltrate the city and switch everyone's minds into the right bodies.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Unfortunately, this left Brainiac back in control of his original body, and he quickly blasted Superman with his psychic abilities. Luckily, the young boy whose body Superman had been in managed to save the day, reversing the flow of information Brainiac had created, jamming all of the vast knowledge into Brainiac. This left him nearly catatonic again, muttering in binary code.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

====''The Doomsday Wars''====
During a later skirmish with Superman in Metropolis, Milton Fine's body was irreparably damaged, leaving Brainiac with only a short time to live. In order to preserve his life, he concocted an elaborate scheme by having an agent of his, a Coluan named Prin Vnok, use a [[time travel|time machine]] to travel to the [[End of Time]] itself and retrieve [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]], who had been left there by Superman and [[Waverider (comics)|Waverider]] to ensure that he would never be a threat again, and use Doomsday as a new host body.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Seconds before the forces of [[entropy]] destroyed him forever, Doomsday was taken to safety by Vnok and returned to Colu. There, a terminally-wounded Brainiac transferred his consciousness into Doomsday's body, temporarily becoming the most powerful being in the universe; a [[genius]] [[psychic]] mind inside an unstoppable, indestructible titan. However, Doomsday's own raging mind would eventually overwhelm Brainiac's will, and he reacted too quickly for Brainiac and Vnok to erase his mind using chemical or psionic treatments, forcing Brainiac to find another body. While still lodged in Doomsday's head, Brainiac decided to take control of a human host in order to attempt to clone a new version of Doomsday that didn't possess the creature's mind. Brainiac chose to use [[Pete Ross]] and [[Lana Lang]]'s newborn baby, born eight weeks premature and being transported by Superman to the best Neo-Natal Intensive Care Unit in the country, as the temporary host. Brainiac intercepted Superman during the attempt and stole the baby to hurt his long-time foe, correctly deducing that it was the child of someone close to Superman. However, Superman thwarted Brainiac's plot by driving him out of Doomsday's body with the use of a [[telepathy]]-blocking 'psi-blocker' which forced Brainiac to adopt a robotic body, dubbed '''Brainiac 2.5''', where he would be forever trapped as he couldn't abandon it.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

====Brainiac 13====
[[Image:Supesy2k.jpg|Brainiac 13 on the cover of ''Superman Y2K'' #1. Art by [[Jackson Guice]].|left|thumb|185px]]
At the turn of the [[millennium]], Brainiac revealed that he had placed a sleeper [[computer virus|virus]] in [[LexCorp]]'s [[Y2K bug]] safeguards which was intended to dramatically boost his abilities. Instead, it allowed his upgraded future self, '''Brainiac 13''' (or "'''B-13'''"), to travel from the 64th century to the present day and take control of Brainiac 2.5's body. Brainiac 13 began transforming Metropolis into the 64th century version of the city, which he controlled. Although Brainiac 13 was able to gain control of several android superheroes, such as the [[Red Tornado]], [[Hourman (android)|Hourman]], and the [[Metal Men]], and use them against Superman, Superman discovered during a fight with the [[Eradicator (comics)|Eradicator]] — attempting to stop the Kryptonian program from 'hi-jacking' the B13 virus and using it for its own ends — that Brainiac 13 couldn't cope with Kryptonian technology because he wasn't compatible with it, giving Superman a plan to stop Brainiac's scheme.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

With Luthor using a Kryptonian warsuit and aided by Brainiac 2.5 (who now possessed [[Lena Luthor#Modern version|Lena Luthor]]'s body), Superman and the rebuilt [[Kelex]] tricked Luthor into plugging himself into one of Brainiac 13's power conduits, claiming that Luthor would channel the energy through a Kryptonian matrix to destroy Brainiac 13. Aided by the revived Red Tornado, Superman managed to suck up the microscopic [[nanobots]] that comprised Brainiac 13 and transfer them into the warsuit, leaving Brainiac 13 trapped in technology he couldn't understand or use. However, realizing his defeat was inevitable, Brainiac 13 seized his last chance for escape and gave control of Metropolis to Luthor in exchange for Lena/Brainiac 2.5, whom he forced to help him escape.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

He returned to Earth along with a teenage Lena (still possessed by Brainiac 2.5), during the ''Our Worlds at War'' crossover, in which Earth and its allies fought a multi-front war against [[Imperiex]]. Brainiac 13 claimed to be allying himself with Earth, but this proved to be part of a complex plan to regain control. Remaining behind the scenes for most of the conflict, at the moment when Imperiex's armor was cracked thanks to the sacrifices of [[Strange Visitor]] and [[Sgt. Rock|General Rock]], Brainiac 13 appeared on the battleground with [[Warworld]], absorbing Imperiex's energies and vowing to use them to rule everything.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

In a desperate gambit, Superman dove into the heart of the sun, thus gaining a massive power boost that enhanced his strength significantly. Rapidly realizing that Warworld couldn't be destroyed without releasing Imperiex and triggering another [[Big Bang]], Superman and the [[Martian Manhunter]] formed a brief telepathic link to explain their new plan. With [[Darkseid]]'s powers weakened, he would use [[Garth (comics)|Tempest]] as a magical focus for his abilities, empowered by the faith and strength of the [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazons]], focusing the energy through [[John Henry Irons|Steel]]'s new 'Entropy Aegis' armor (which was created from a burned-out Imperiex probe), and, with Lex Luthor activating a temporal displacement weapon, Superman would subsequently push Warworld through a temporal [[boom tube]], sending both Imperiex's and Brainiac 13's consciousness back 14 billion years to the Big Bang, destroying both villains through a combined effort. With Brainiac 13's death, Brainiac 2.5 was expunged from Lena, who reverted to infancy, although the control discs remained.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

After the death of Brainiac 13, Superman discovered that a version of Krypton which he had visited via the [[Phantom Zone]] had in fact been created by Brainiac 13 as a trap for him. Having been defeated by Kryptonian technology, Brainiac 13 had traveled back in time to the real Krypton prior to its destruction, stolen the [[Eradicator (comics)|Eradicator matrix]] and [[Jor-El]]'s diaries, and created a false Krypton based on Jor-El's favorite period in history.<ref>{{Cite comic | writer=[[Jeph Loeb|Loeb, Jeph]] | cowriters=[[Joe Casey]], [[Mark Schultz (comics)|Mark Schultz]], ''et al.'' | penciller=[[Ed McGuinness|McGuinness, Ed]] | copencillers=[[Duncan Rouleau]], [[Pasqual Ferry|Pascual Ferry]], ''et al.'' | inker=[[Cam Smith|Smith, Cam]] | coinkers=Marlo Alquiza, Tom Nguyen, ''et al.'' | title=Superman: Return to Krypton | date=March 2004 | publisher=DC Comics | location=New York | id=ISBN 978-1840237986}}</ref>

Sometime later, Superman traveled into the future and battled '''Brainiac 12''', learning that everything Brainiac 13 had done in the past had been designed to ensure things reached the point where Brainiac 13 would be created. Brainiac 12's defeat before his upgrade apparently reversed the advances Brainiac 13 had made to Metropolis.<ref name="superman200">''Superman'' (vol. 2) #200 (February 2004)</ref>

====The Insiders====
{{main|Indigo (comics)}}
[[Image:Brainiacs.jpg|right|Brainiac with his descendant [[Brainiac 8]], as they discuss his use of organics. Art by Matthew Clark.|185px|thumb|right]]
Around the time of the ''Graduation Day'' event, a future version of Brainiac, called '''Brainiac 6''', used his "granddaughter", '''Brainiac 8''' (also known as [[Indigo (comics)|Indigo]]), to kill [[Donna Troy]] in order to ensure the fate of Colu. Indigo then infiltrated the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]] until she attacked the team, along with Brainiac 6 and his allies, Lex Luthor, and a brainwashed [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]], who had attacked the [[Teen Titans]].{{Issue|date=October 2008}} In the ensuing battle, Indigo died and Superboy broke away from the brainwashing, while Luthor escaped. While his ship was destroyed, Brainiac's condition and whereabouts after the battle are unknown.{{Issue|date=October 2008}}

It was also shown that Brainiac 6 utilized Luthor's secret cloning facilities to create a cyborg body for himself that resembled his original pre-''Crisis'' incarnation and that he planned to download his consciousness into a robot body resembling his pre-''Crisis'' metal body incarnation.

Shortly after this storyline, the Teen Titans broke into one of Luthor's labs in order to procure a serum to save a dying Superboy and discovered many failed attempts in cloning a new body for Brainiac 6. The Titans then fought the so-called '''Brainiac Alpha''', a murderous, aborted [[molecular cloning|clone]] of Brainiac.{{Issue|date=October 2008}}

====Silver Age Brainiac in the post-Crisis universe====
Later stories revealed that elements of Brainiac's pre-''Crisis'' history occurred in the post-''Crisis'' character's history prior to his possession of Milton Fine and his first encounter with Superman. The citizens of Kandor recall that Brainiac stole their city from Krypton, and not the alien wizard Tolos.<ref name="superman200"/>

''[[History of the DC Universe]]'' mentions his defeat by the [[Omega Men]], as seen in ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' itself, and noted a second Brainiac was created on a laboratory on Earth two years later. In the ''[[Silver Age (DC Comics)|Silver Age: JLA]]'' one-shot, the [[Injustice League]] discovered numerous shrunken alien cities found in Brainiac's abandoned spaceship.

====Brainiac's updated mechanical form====
Brainiac later reappeared as a [[Swarm intelligence|swarm of interlinked nanotechnological units]]. Its operation was to sabotage a [[Waynetech#Wayne Technologies|Waynetech research facility]] accomplished by infecting [[Metallo]] with a [[computer virus]] and controlling him from orbit. Superman and [[Batman]] tracked Brainiac's signal to an orbital facility and attacked. Brainiac's nanoswarm body was destroyed, though he had infected the [[Metal Men]] during their previous encounter with Metallo. Brainiac proceeded to use them to acquire a prototype [[OMACs|OMAC unit]], which Bruce Wayne had developed through the use of Brainiac 13 nanotechnology. Superman and Batman destroyed the OMAC body with the aid of the Metal Men, after the Metal Men overcame Brainiac's control.{{Issue|date=October 2008}}

====Return====
{{main|Brainiac (story arc)}}
Following recent revisions to Superman's continuity in ''Action Comics'' #850, Brainiac reappeared in a self-titled five part story-arc in ''Action Comics''. A Brainiac robot probe arrives on Earth and battles Superman. After being defeated, the probe sends information about Superman's blood to the original Brainiac. [[Kara Zor-El|Supergirl]] then reveals to Superman that Brainiac shrunk the Kryptonian city of Kandor and placed it in a bottle, that Milton Fine was infected by nanite probes, (which later migrated into Doomsday, the Brainiac 2.5 android, and finally into Lena Luthor), sent by the "original" Brainiac to look for Superman and that, in current continuity, no one has ever actually met the "real" Brainiac. Superman is soon captured by Brainiac after Superman finds him attacking an alien planet and preparing to steal a city from its surface.

Superman escapes from his imprisonment and sees Brainiac emerging from his "bio-shell". This new version of Brainiac resembles a much larger and more muscular version of the original, pre-''Crisis'' Brainiac, and has motives similar to the ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' incarnation of the character in that Brainiac travels the universe and steals the knowledge of various alien cultures, abducting and shrinking cities from each planet as samples, and then destroys the planet so that the value of the destroyed civilization's knowledge is increased. Brainiac's ship then travels to Earth and prepares to abduct the city of Metropolis.

Brainiac successfully steals Metropolis, and prepares to fire a missile that will destroy the sun and the Earth itself. Supergirl stops the missile while Superman battles Brainiac. Superman knocks Brainiac out of his ship and into a swamp, where Brainiac is overwhelmed by the microscopic organisms covering his body. Superman uses this distraction to defeat Brainiac. While Superman frees the cities of Metropolis and Kandor, the villain launches a missile to the Kent farm in an act of spite. The farm is destroyed, and Jonathan Kent suffers a fatal heart attack because of it.<ref>''Action Comics'' #866-870 (June – October 2008)</ref> Brainiac is brought to a top-secret military base, where the imprisoned Lex Luthor is assigned to discover his secrets. Luthor eventually manages to use Brainiac's connection to his ship to kill the soldiers assigned to watch him. Brainiac manages to free himself from Luthor's control, forcing him onboard the ship, and the two make their escape.<ref>''Adventure Comics'' (vol. 2) #0 (April 2009)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Brainiac has a "12th level intellect", allowing calculation abilities, enhanced memory, and advanced understanding of mechanical engineering, bio-engineering, [[physics]], and other theoretical and applied sciences, as well as extensive knowledge of various alien technologies. The character has created devices such as a [[force field]] belt<ref name="action242">''Action Comics'' #242 (July 1958)</ref> and a shrinking ray capable of reducing cities.<ref name="action242"/> Brainiac's advanced mental powers have shown him capable of [[Spirit possession|possessing]] others, transferring his consciousness,<ref>''Action Comics'' #544 (June 1983)</ref> creating and manipulating computer systems, and exerting some control over time and space. [[John Byrne]]'s re-imagining of the character possessed [[telepathy]] and [[telekinesis]] that were further augmented by an implanted electrode head-piece. The most recent version of Brainiac possesses strength and durability to challenge Superman.<ref>''Action Comics'' #852 (August 2008)</ref>

==Other versions==
The character has been depicted in various [[Continuity (fiction)|out-of-continuity]] stories, such as the ''[[JLA: Earth 2]]'' one-shot, where he is an organic—but still villainous—lifeform. He also appears in ''[[The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'', ''[[Superman: Red Son]]'', ''JLA: Shogun of Steel'', and ''The Last Days of Krypton'' novel by author [[Kevin J. Anderson]].<ref name="autogenerated1">{{Cite book | title=The Last Days of Krypton | first=Kevin J. | last=Anderson | publisher=Harper Entertainment | date=October 2007 | isbn=978-0061340741}}</ref>

==In other media==
===Animation===
====''The New Adventures of Superman''====
The pre-''Crisis'' green-skinned version of Brainiac with robotic diodes made his first in-film appearance in the episodes of the [[Filmation]] [[animated series]] ''[[The New Adventures of Superman (TV series)|The New Adventures of Superman]]''. In this series, Brainiac was from the planet Mega whose entire population had perished in a series of atomic wars with the exception of one survivor, Professor Hecla. Hecla created Brainiac and sent him to Earth to use his shrinking ray to create a sort of "cosmic [[Noah's Ark]]", by shrinking a male and female of each Earth species to take back to repopulate Mega. Brainiac appeared in several episodes of this series which began in 1966.

====''Super Friends''====
Brainiac would resurface as a member of the [[Legion of Doom (comics)|Legion of Doom]] in ''[[Challenge of the Super Friends]]'' [[cartoon]], where he is voiced by [[Ted Cassidy]]. He also appeared in a [[Super Friends (1980)|Super Friends]] short episode, "Superclones", cloning [[Aquaman]] and [[El Dorado (Super Friends)|El Dorado]]. Brainiac voice was now done by [[Stanley Ralph Ross]] who took over for the late Cassidy in 1980.

The mechanical version of Brainiac appeared in ''[[Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show]]'' in the episodes "The Wrath of Brainiac" and "The Village of Lost Souls." In "The Wrath of Brainiac," Brainiac reveals that he shed his earlier appearance when he worked alongside Darkseid. He next appeared in ''[[The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians]]'', in the episode called "Brain Child".

====DC Animated Universe====
[[Corey Burton]] voices Brainiac in ''Superman: The Animated Series'', ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'', ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', and the ''[[Static Shock]]'' two-part episode "[[A League of Their Own (Static Shock)|A League of Their Own]]". This animated version of the character — depicted here as a Kryptonian [[Strong AI|artificial intelligence]] gone rogue — was ranked 94th in [[Wizard (magazine)|''Wizard'' magazine]]'s list of 100 Greatest Villains of all time.<ref name="Wizard #177">''Wizard'' #177</ref>

=====''Superman: The Animated Series''=====
[[Image:Brainiac(STAS).jpg|thumb|Brainiac in ''Superman: The Animated Series''.]]
In ''Superman: The Animated Series'', Brainiac (voiced by Corey Burton) is the supercomputer that ran most of the day-to-day operations on the planet Krypton. He heeds Jor-El's warning about the imminent destruction of Krypton, but rather than validate Jor-El's claims, he dismisses them as false while secretly working to save himself, as he contains the collected records of Krypton. Brainiac reasons that, should he inform the government, they would put him to work to stop the inevitable and doom both parties. As long as he survives, the essence of Krypton survives, the loss of the planet itself and all its living inhabitants being an acceptable part of the natural order.

Brainiac survives Krypton's destruction and moves from planet to planet, recording the knowledge of each world and then destroying it in order to make that knowledge more valuable, eventually assuming a robotic form. Brainiac eventually makes his way to Earth, under the pretense of a peaceful exchange of knowledge with Lex Luthor. Superman, however, discovers Brainiac's true intentions, and with the help of Luthor, defeats Brainiac. Brainiac is seemingly destroyed, but later episodes reveal that Brainiac had uploaded a copy of his programming in to [[LexCorp]]'s computers. Brainiac tries several times to revive himself, first by capturing Luthor and forcing him to build a new body, and another time by taking control of [[Bruce Wayne]], prompting Superman to team up with [[Tim Drake|Robin]] in order to find him, but is thwarted each time.

The distinct animated interpretation of the character is rated the 94th greatest villain of all time by [[Wizard (magazine)|''Wizard'' magazine]].<ref name="Wizard #177"/>

=====''Justice League''=====
Brainiac reemerged in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]''' episode "Twilight", with him attacking [[Apokolips]] after Darkseid had suffered a major defeat at the hands of [[Orion (comics)|Orion]]. This prompts Darkseid to come to the Watchtower and ask the [[Justice League]] for help. The story was a ruse, however, one intended to lure the Justice League, Superman in particular, to Brainiac's mainframe. Brainiac's full plan was to assume the body of Superman for him to inhabit. Darkseid betrayed Brainiac, however, and in the subsequent battle, both the machine intelligence and Darkseid were destroyed.

=====''Static Shock''=====
In the ''[[Static Shock]]'' two-part [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] episode "A League of Their Own", Brainiac, now reduced to a single circuit board kept in stasis, escaped confinement following a [[power failure]] at the Justice League's Watchtower. [[Static (DC Comics)|Static]] and [[Gear (Static Shock)|Gear]] had been recruited by the Justice League to help recharge the Watchtower's generators. During that time, Brainiac slowly began gaining control of the Watchtower. He sent the Justice League a fake distress call to lure them away, then attempted to dispose of Static and Gear before turning the Watchtower into his new body. Fortunately, the teen superheroes discovered his plan and alerted the Justice League to return. Fighting their way, to the power core, Static drained back the power he gave, stopping Brainiac. Unfortunately, during the battle, Brainiac transferred himself into Gear's droid Backpack, and later turned Richie into a [[cyborg]] under his control (starting part two of the episode). As Brainiac proceeded to use Richie's hands and technological skills to build a warship and take over the Justice League one-by-one with small implants inserted in the space where the [[Human skull|skull]] joins the [[spinal column]], Richie attempted to fight back and tell Static the means by which to defeat Brainiac: Backpack's remote control had an off switch. Static eventually discovered it and was able to stop Brainiac's scheme at the source, thus saving Earth.

The voice of Brainiac here sounds quite different, but it is still Corey Burton; the producers of ''Static Shock'' decided to pitch Burton's voice significantly lower for their show.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://jl.toonzone.net/brainiac/brainiac.htm | title=Brainiac | work=ToonZone}}</ref>

=====''Justice League Unlimited''=====
In the ''Justice League Unlimited'' episode "[[For the Man Who Has Everything]]", in a dream world Superman was experiencing when attached to the alien [[hallucinogen]]ic Black Mercy plant, Brainiac is still in his position as Krypton's monitoring system and the planet didn't explode at the time Superman was an infant. Kal-El noticed the same tremors that occurred in accordance to his father's theories, but Brainiac only dismissed them as minor tremors. It was soon proven wrong that Krypton was going to be destroyed.

[[Image:Lexiac.jpg‎|left|thumb|200px|Brainiac fused with Lex Luthor in ''Justice League Unlimited''.]]
During a previous encounter years before (in the ''Superman: The Animated Series'' episode "Ghost in the Machine"), Brainiac had delivered a nano-robotic probe carrying a portion of his consciousness into Lex Luthor. It began modifying Luthor's body, subtly controlling him into committing actions that resulted in a major [[story arc]] that occurred throughout the first two seasons of ''Justice League Unlimited''. At the end of the episode "Panic in the Sky" and continuing into the following episode "[[wikia:DCAU:Divided We Fall|Divided We Fall]]", Brainiac revealed himself to the Justice League, having planned to transfer himself into a duplicated form of [[Amazo]] which was destroyed by [[Amanda Waller]]. Escaping the Justice League, Brainiac took Luthor into the sewers, planning on continuing his mission of assimilating information of entire planets and then destroying them. Luthor, however, convinced Brainiac to see a bigger reality than just his mission. Arriving at a Cadmus laboratory, they assimilated [[nanotechnology]] from the alien Dark Heart machine (from the episode of the same name). Using the [[Molecular assembler|nano assemblers]], they merged into a single entity possessing Brainiac's goals and approaches tempered by Luthor's ambition and cruelty, with the purpose of building a machine to absorb all knowledge, destroying the universe and recreating it in their image. This version of Brainiac/Luthor was mostly gold and blue, and partially robotic and used a Brainiac skull-shaped space ship similar to the one used by the pre-''Crisis'' metal body version of Brainiac. When the Justice League is defeated in battle, the Flash single-handedly defeated Brainiac-Luthor by superspeed-punching Brainiac/Luthor's outer robotic shell, running faster than ever before (pulling him partially into the [[Speed Force]] until the other League members pulled him out of the portal), leaving behind a dazed Luthor.

After the defeat, all that was left of Brainiac was a small piece of its body, which somehow came into the possession of [[Gorilla Grodd]] in the second season of ''Justice League Unlimited''. Luthor himself continued to speak to Brainiac's consciousness, apparently still existing within his own mind. Urged by Brainiac to escape prison, Luthor was picked up by Grodd's [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]] and convinced to join by the promise of getting his hands on the Brainiac fragment, with which he could reconstruct and re-merge with him. Though he eventually usurped leadership of the Secret Society from Grodd, Luthor remained unable to unlock the Brainiac fragment for some reason, and instead used it to locate the quadrant of the universe where Brainiac had been destroyed along with Darkseid. Using a combination of technology and magic, Luthor intended to reintegrate the surviving pieces into a new version of the android, only to wind up resurrecting Darkseid (whose armor now bore markings and technology reminiscent of Brainiac's), who then "rewarded" those responsible for his resurrection by attempting to grant them a quick death by destroying the Secret Society's headquarters/craft with a single Omega Blast and thereafter returned to [[Apokolips]] to begin his campaign against Earth, and subsequently [[New Genesis]].

Luthor and the surviving Secret Society members returned to Earth and joined forces with the Justice League to stop Apokolips' attack on Earth, and Luthor claimed to no longer be able to hear Brainiac inside his head, although when Luthor was then transported to the [[Source Wall]] and recovered the [[Anti-Life Equation]], it was claimed that only a "twelfth-level intellect" could accomplish this, and Brainiac is one of the few individuals with this [[IQ]]. Ultimately, however, it was never explicitly revealed by the series' end whether or not Brainiac had ''ever'' truly existed within Luthor's mind after his discorporation or if Luthor was partially insane.

=====In the future=====
In the year 2979, as it is revealed in the ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' episode "New Kids In Town", Brainiac still lives and has made enemies of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]. During that time, it learned how to pass its code down biologically and created Brainiac 5; however, this iteration of the Brainiac identity turned out to be good, and joined the Legion in an effort to atone for the crimes of his predecessors. The original Brainiac traveled back to the past to kill the teenage [[Clark Kent]] before he would become Superman. Thanks in part to [[Cosmic Boy]], [[Chameleon Boy]], and [[Saturn Girl]], Clark defeated Brainiac, who was teleported into the [[sun]], where it incinerated.

In the ''Justice League Unlimited'' episode "Far From Home", [[Supergirl]], along with [[John Stewart (comics)|Green Lantern]] and [[Green Arrow]], are pulled to the 30th century to help the Legion; Supergirl and Brainiac 5 began to fall in love, and Supergirl ultimately decided to stay in the 30th century, leaving Lantern and Green Arrow in the unenviable position of telling Superman the name of the individual that Kara had feelings for as part of her motivation to remain in the future.

====''Legion of Super-Heroes''====
In ''[[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)|Legion of Super-Heroes]]'', Brainiac 5 is a descendant of the 1.0, the original Brainiac, who is an unwanted robot on his home planet. In the second season episode ''Message in a Bottle'', Brainiac 5 reveals the past atrocities caused by his predecessor, one such atrocity being the shrinking and abduction of the Kryptonian city of Kandor, which would cause a chain of events leading to the demise of Krypton. Later in the episode, Brainiac 5 accesses the locked-down collective memory of Brainiac 1.0 to combat Imperiex. Brainiac 1.0 confesses to Brainiac 5 that he has watched him since he came online, and offers Brainiac 5 a chip that he tells him is an upgrade that will open "new avenues of possibility", ending the statement with "The choice is yours." Brainiac 5 then downloads the information.

In the two-part [[series finale]] "Dark Victory", Brainiac 1.0 shows ever increasing presence over his descendant, trying to make him fulfill his destiny. It is revealed then that Imperiex purposely had Brainiac 5 take the upgrade so that he would become Brainiac and join his ranks. By the time he begins a full scale assault on the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]], Brainiac 1.0 has fully taken over and obliterates his attacking forces with devastating new weapons. He then defeats various Legionnaires and badly wounds Superman with a [[kryptonite]] headband, one that appears to kill him. Brainiac then joins Imperiex but then betrays him, thanking him for unleashing his inner evil before killing him. He then reforms Imperiex's ship into a floating Brainiac skull and plans to begin anew his reign of "peace and order", nearly digitizing the entire Legion until Brainiac 5 forces him out of his body, discarding his cybernetics. However, Brainiac survives and uses Brainiac 5's Coluan armor to create a new body, ending with, in the dual voice of Brainiacs 1 and 5, "Evil does not die; it evolves." This form is credited as "Brainiac 6."

While the ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' television series does not share the same continuity as the ''Justice League Unlimited'' series or its predecessors, the version of Brainiac which appeared on the show is also voiced by Corey Burton and shares the same musical [[leitmotif]] from his [[DC animated universe]] appearances.

====''Superman: Brainiac Attacks''====
Brainiac returned in the 2006 [[direct-to-video]] animated feature ''[[Superman: Brainiac Attacks]]'', where he was voiced by [[Lance Henriksen]]. The movie begins with Brainiac landing on Earth in a [[meteor]]. Brainiac goes around absorbing information until Superman destroys him with his super-breath. However, Lex Luthor is able to save a piece of Brainiac and forms an alliance with the Kryptonian robot. Luthor gives Brainiac a new body, made from his satellite weapon. Brainiac is also equipped with a kryptonite beam and the ability to track Superman by his Kryptonian [[DNA]].

Luthor and Brainiac's bargain revolves around Brainiac using his new body to destroy Superman, and afterwards, Brainiac would allow himself to be "defeated" by Luthor and leave for another planet so that Luthor would appear as a hero. However, Brainiac betrayed Luthor after he believed Superman was destroyed, but in the end, Superman returned to defeat Brainiac after a lengthy battle. This time, Superman made sure that this copy of Brainiac was completely destroyed.

====''Superman: Doomsday''====
Although Brainiac does not appear in ''[[Superman: Doomsday]]'', a statue of his robot head seen in [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]] was seen as a trophy in the Fortress of Solitude.

====''Batman: The Brave and the Bold''====
Brainiac's earliest outfit (albeit with slight modification) as a Coluian is seen in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode, "[[List of Batman: The Brave and the Bold episodes|The Siege of Starro!, Part 2]]", as a trophy in the spaceship of the [[Faceless Hunter]], the minion/herald of [[Starro]].

===Live-action===
====Film====
Brainiac has yet to make an appearance on film. However, the character has been considered for some Superman films in the pre-production stages.

* Brainiac was considered to be the main antagonist for ''[[Superman III]]'', along with [[Mr. Mxyzptlk]], when [[Ilya Salkind]] made an early treatment. In the treatment, Brainiac was from Colu and has discovered [[Supergirl]] in the same way that Superman was found by the Kents. Brainiac is portrayed as a surrogate father to Supergirl and eventually fell in love with his "daughter", who did not reciprocate his feelings, as she had fallen in love with Superman.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010|reason=Dead link removed}} However, Warner Bros. rejected the treatment, and the final product featured a powerful computer as a major "villain."
* Brainiac was considered as a villain in the scrapped ''[[Superman (film series)#Superman Reborn|Superman Reborn]]'' and ''[[Superman (film series)#Superman Lives|Superman Lives]]'' film projects. Most notably, the villain was featured with Doomsday in [[Kevin Smith]]'s version of the script, which was later discarded by director [[Tim Burton]]. Burton's own script included Brainiac's intellect bonding with Lex Luthor, as would later happen in ''Justice League Unlimited'' (and which had previously been seen in the comic book story ''[[Superman: Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?]]'')<ref>{{Cite book | last=Hughes | first=David | title=The Greatest Sci-Fi Films Never Made | publisher=Titan Books | isbn=1-84023-428-8 | pages=176–179 | chapter=The Death of Superman Lives | year=2002}}</ref>

* Brainiac is being considered along with Lex Luthor to be a villain for the upcoming Superman film [[The Man of Steel (film)|''The Man of Steel'']].<ref>{{Cite web | last=Graham | first=Bill | title=David Goyer Writing Next ''Superman'', Plot Details Emerge, Called ''The Man of Steel'' | url=http://www.collider.com/2010/02/24/david-goyer-writing-next-superman-plot-details-emerge-called-the-man-of-steel/ | date=February 24, 2010 | work=Collider | accessdate=February 24, 2010}}</ref>

====''Smallville''====
In the fifth season of ''[[Smallville]]'', Brainiac is introduced as a recurring villain, played by [[James Marsters]]. He takes the name of Prof. '''Milton Fine''', posing as a professor at (fictional) Central Kansas A&M University. "Brainiac" is mostly referred to by his assumed name, although [[Jor-El]] refers to him in the fifth season finale "[[wikia:Smallville:Vessel|Vessel]]" as the "Brain InterActive Construct", and [[wikia:Smallville:Raya|Raya]] is the first person to call him "Brainiac" in [[Smallville (Season 6)|Season 6]]'s "[[wikia:Smallville:Fallout|Fallout]]."

''Smallville''{{'}}s interpretation of Brainiac is similar to the [[DC animated universe]] version; that of a self-aware computer in humanoid form with a Kryptonian origin. He is composed of a black, [[liquid crystal|crystalline liquid]] which allows him to change shape at will. He can duplicate the standard array of Kryptonian powers, and is immune to kryptonite; however, he does need to recharge periodically. Brainiac can also interface with most technology. He also forms small blades and daggers out his hands (similar to the [[T-1000]]). He can form multiple copies of himself.<ref>{{Cite episode | series=Smallville | season=5 | number=16 | title=Hypnotic}}</ref> It is implied that the black Kryptonian spaceship from which he emerges is in fact his true form, while the Milton Fine persona is merely an avatar created to carry out the ship's will. The ship itself is destroyed at the end of the fifth season, though Brainiac persists through his single remaining human form.

When first introduced, Dr. Milton Fine's primary function is to free [[General Zod]] from the [[Phantom Zone]], and turn Earth into a suitable planet for Zod to rule. To this end, he takes on the guise of a professor of World History at Central Kansas A&M University, occasionally expressing his disparaging views toward humanity during his lectures, and hires [[Clark Kent]] as a research assistant. Fine gains Clark's trust using clever deceptions and his mimicked Kryptonian powers. To free Zod, he infects Clark's adoptive mother Martha with a mysterious Kryptonian disease in the episode "[[wikia:Smallville:Solitude|Solitude]]", claiming that it is Jor-El's doing and that he must take him to the Fortress of Solitude to save her. Brainiac betrays Clark and opens a portal to the Phantom Zone, but with some aid of Chloe, Clark stops him.

Clark was intended to be Zod's vessel (Zod having had his body and spirit separated), but since Jor-El's spirit proved to be too strong in Clark, Brainiac was forced to turn elsewhere. He creates a special virus to change Lex Luthor into a suitable host, and then unleashes a [[computer virus]] that quickly infects every computer system on Earth, shutting down every bit of technology and causing widespread chaos. Clark is given a Kryptonian knife to kill Lex and prevent Zod's return, but he instead chooses to kill Fine. Ironically, this act is what allows Zod to be reborn, since the knife is linked to the Fortress. However, it does have the positive effect of eliminating Fine. In the sixth season episode "[[wikia:Smallville:Zod|Zod]]", General Zod, possessing Lex, transforms the black ship into a small hexagonal disk, and uses it to begin recreating Krypton on Earth. Clark uses heat vision to destroy the disk, leaving only a charred half of it behind. A Phantom Zone escapee named Baern later feeds off of the energy within the broken disk, reducing it to a pile of ash.

In the seventh season, Brainiac is able to reform from the ashes and sap the metallic elements from unsuspecting humans to rebuild his human form, though not his Kryptonian powers. When [[Bizarro]] finds Brainiac in an attempt to cure his weakness to sunlight, Brainiac manipulates both him and Clark into finding Dax-Ur, the Kryptonian scientist who invented him and is now living on Earth. Brainiac tracks down his creator and forcefully downloads the information he needs on how to fix his body from Dax-Ur's mind. Later in the season, Brainiac forces [[Kara Zor-El|Kara]] to help him travel back in time (Brainiac's intent being to kill Clark as an infant) by attacking [[Lana Lang]], rewiring her brain to place her in a state reminiscent of [[anesthesia awareness]]. Since only he can reverse the process, Kara agrees to help him, but Brainiac does not make good on his deal. Clark is able to follow through the Fortress, and Brainiac is apparently killed by Kara off-screen. However, Brainiac in fact imprisoned Kara in the Phantom Zone and posed as her to escape with Clark. Brainiac reveals Clark's secret to Lex, and attacks [[Chloe Sullivan]] once his secret is discovered. He does to her what he did to Lana, but Chloe's healing powers drain much of his energy. When he attempts to recharge, he is cornered by Clark. Clark defeats Brainiac and demands for him to release Chloe and Lana. Brainiac goads Clark into killing him, since it is the only way to reverse what he has done to Chloe and Lana. Clark rationalizes that since Brainiac is a machine, he is not actually killing anyone, and uses an electrical surge to disintegrate Brainiac.

Brainiac survives through Chloe, infecting her with a small amount of himself. He gives her access to his intellect and knowledge, but the data eventually takes over her mind, erasing many of her memories in the eighth season episode "[[wikia:Smallville:Abyss|Abyss]]". Clark is able to recreate the Fortress (destroyed by Lex in the previous season) and restore her memories, but Brainiac escapes from Chloe's body and infects the Fortress, announcing (in Marsters' voice) that Doomsday is coming. Later in  "[[wikia:Smallville:Bride|Bride]]", Doomsday kidnaps Chloe during her wedding ceremony and brings her to the Fortress, putting her under Brainiac's control. In the next episode, "Legion," with the help of [[Legion of Super-Heroes|superheroes from the 31st century]], Clark extracts Brainiac's nanites, compresses them into a ball, and sends it back to the future with the Legionnaires, who mention they will reprogram him to be [[Brainiac 5]]. James Marsters will play both Brainiac and Brainiac 5 in Season 10 of Smallville. In the episode "Homecoming" Brainiac returns as Brainiac 5 and he shows Clark a different future and gives him a glimpse of his future as Metropolis's mega-hero. He also mentions the beginning of his corruption being but one nano bot which spread to infect his whole being, suggesting that he was turned by Zod as previously mentioned.

===Books===
A Brainiac loosely based on the [[Silver Age of Comics|Silver Age]] version appears in ''The Last Days of Krypton'', a novel by [[Kevin J. Anderson]].<ref name="autogenerated1"/> This version of Brainiac is known as the Brain InterActive Construct, later renamed Brainiac by Commissioner Zod. Brainiac had admired the beauty and architecture of Kandor, and wanted to preserve the city from destruction should disaster strike [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]] as it did on his home planet of Colu. Zod permitted Brainiac's taking of Kandor, stating that Brainiac could have the city, as the rest of Krypton belonged to him. Brainiac's ship fired three lasers that pummeled the surrounding crust around Kandor and literally upheaved the city from Krypton's surface. A [[force field]] was then erected around the city which contracted, shrinking the city and its inhabitants. Brainiac departed without causing further destruction or seizing other Kryptonian cities.

===Video games===
* Brainiac was the main antagonist and boss in the 1992 Sunsoft game ''[[Superman (Sunsoft game)|Superman]]''.
* In ''[[Superman 64]]'', Brainiac, from the [[DCAU]], appears not only as a villain and level boss, but also as a playable character in multiplayer.
* Superman was forced to stop Brainiac and save the world after Brainiac kidnapped [[Lois Lane]] in the [[Sega Master System]] and [[Sega Genesis]] video game ''Superman: Man of Steel''.
* In the [[Xbox]] video game ''[[Superman: The Man of Steel (video game)|Superman: Man of Steel]]'', Brainiac 13 is the final boss of the game. Players must compete against B13 drones throughout the game, before facing the android on the final level.
* Brainiac was featured in the concept art in the [[Superman Returns (video game)|2006 video game Superman Returns]], looking vastly different than other incarnations.
* Brainiac is a featured major villain in the video game ''[[Justice League Heroes]]'' voiced by [[Peter Jessop]]. In the game, Brainiac first invaded [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] and ordered a huge legion of robots to seal off the area. Batman and Superman head for S.T.A.R. Labs, destroy Brainiac's robots, and battle Brainiac. After the two superheroes defeat what they think is Brainiac, they discover that they have merely been diverted by a duplicate while another has raided the vaults of the lab, taking [[Kryptonian]] DNA and a chunk of meteorite. Brainiac hires [[Queen Bee (comics)|Queen Bee]], the [[Key (comics)|Key]], [[Killer Frost]], [[Gorilla Grodd]], and the [[White Martian]]s to distract the Justice League. While the rest of the League fights and defeats the villains, a nuclear missile that Brainiac had Killer Frost previously launch, is fired at Mars in an effort to free the White Martians, who will invade Earth upon being rewoken. Superman and [[J'onn J'onzz]] travel to Mars to stop them from escaping; but this has been yet another diversion from Brainiac who, anticipating their success, took the opportunity to steal vital equipment from the White Martians. J'onn is ambushed by Doomsday who takes him prisoner, and who takes over control of the [[Justice League Watchtower|Watchtower]] whilst Brainiac steals a [[Mother Box]] from the League's vaults. Regrouping in an emergency bunker, the League manage to retake the Watchtower, free J'onn, and defeat the real Doomsday, before discovering that the foes and distractions that they faced was all part of a plan to distract the League while Brainiac continues his work to unlock power from the chunk of meteor rock. The League travel to Braniac's lair and split into teams. Superman and Flash find Brainiac's control room. After Superman and Flash defeat Brainiac's robots, they fight Brainiac. Although Brainiac managed to subdue Flash, Superman overpowers Brainiac, and defeats him. Seemingly defeated by Superman, Brainiac suddenly returns to life as the Mother Box he has stolen activates - and screaming, he is absorbed into Darkseid, released from an interdimensional prison, who has been manipulating Brainiac all throughout.
* Corey Burton reprises his role as Brainiac and is the main antagonist in [[DC Universe Online]]. Here Brainiac returns to Earth and both super heroes and other villains of the DC universe appeal to a truce to combat Brainiac. He is also (indirectly) the source of the player characters' powers, as a future version of Lex Luthor used his technology to create "exobytes", highly-advanced [[nanorobots]] with the ability to infuse an organic host with superpowers.

==Cultural references==
* The band [[The Dukes of Stratosphear]], an alter ego for [[XTC]], released a song called "Brainiac's Daughter" on their 1987 album ''[[Psonic Psunspot]]''. The lyrics include references to the bottled city of [[Kandor]] and the [[Daily Planet]]. Songwriter [[Andy Partridge]] has said of the song: ''"Right, well, Brainiac is the character in the Superman comics, the evil [[genius]] with the green skin and the sort of lightbulb screwed in his head. He was like a Martian Lex Luthor and I thought he'd be a wonderful [[psychedelic]] subject to write about, and his potential daughter: I do not think he had one but if he had she would have been, well, colorful, mauve and purple."'' This reference eventually came full circle when [[Alex Ross]] and [[Mark Waid]] created a background character named "Brainiac's Daughter" in the 1996 limited series ''[[Kingdom Come (comic)|Kingdom Come]]''. The band Royal recorded a cover version of the song for the 2006 compilation album ''[[Sound of Superman]]'', released by [[Rhino Records]] in conjunction with the opening of the movie ''[[Superman Returns]]''.
* In the list of people 'playing' in the song 'The Intro and The Outro' by The [[Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band]], Braniac is on [[banjo]].
* In [[The Big Bang Theory]], Leonard tried to impress Penny by showing her the miniature replica of Kandor and mentions Brainaic.
