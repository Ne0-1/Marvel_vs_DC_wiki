'''Brainiac''' is a [[fictional character:fictional]] [[comic book]] character, a [[supervillain]] in the [[DC Comics Universe]]. Created by [[Otto Binder]], the character first appeared in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #242 ([[1958#July|July 1958]]). Brainiac has been one of [[Superman]]'s most important enemies ever since the villain's first appearance, and is responsible for shrinking [[Kandor]], the [[capital city]] of [[Superman]]'s home planet [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]] which the hero has vowed to restore.

Due to complex storylines involving [[time travel]], [[cloning]], and revisions of DC's [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]], several variations of Brainiac have appeared. Though at his core Brainiac is formless, most incarnations depict him as a bald (save for a set of [[diodes]] protruding from his skull), green-skinned [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|alien]] [[android]] from the planet [[Colu]].

His name derives from the -IAC naming trend among [[:Category:One-of-a-kind computers|early electronic computers]], after [[ENIAC]]: [[ILLIAC I|ILLIAC]], [[JOHNNIAC]], [[MANIAC I|MANIAC]], [[SILLIAC]], ''etc.'' In the television series ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]],'' BRAINIAC is said to stand for "BRAIN InterActive Construct".

==Fictional character biography==
===Pre-Crisis Brainiac===
[[Image:ActionComics242.jpg|180px|thumb|left|Brainiac's first appearance in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #242. Art by [[Curt Swan]] and [[Stan Kaye]].]]

First appearing in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #242 (July 1958), Brainiac was a bald, green-skinned [[humanoid]] who arrived on Earth and shrank various cities, including [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], storing them in bottles with the intent of using them to restore Bryak, the planet he ruled. While fighting Brainiac, [[Superman]] discovered that the villain had previously shrunk the [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonian]] city of [[Kandor]]. He was able to restore the Earth cities to full size, but the Kandorians sacrificed their restoration to help him. 

[[Superman]] stored the city in his [[Fortress of Solitude]], vowing to return the natives to full size. In ''[[Superman]]''  #167 (February 1964), it was discovered that Brainiac was a machine created by the Computer Tyrants of [[Colu]] as a spy. To increase the illusion that he was alive, Brainiac was given a "son", a young [[Colu]]an boy who was given the name "Brainiac 2", but escaped; this was [[Brainiac 5]]'s ancestor. 

It was later revealed that his name was '''[[Vril Dox]]''', and that he went on to lead a revolt against the Computer Tyrants. His "origin" as a tyrant of Bryak could be considered a cover story, as part of his illusion. It was in this story that Brainiac first appeared with a distinctive gridwork of red [[diode]]s across his head, later explained as the "electric terminals of his sensory nerves". This would remain his appearance throughout the [[1960s]] and [[1970s]].

====Brainiac 5====
{{main|Brainiac 5}}
Brainiac's legacy was revealed in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #276, in a ''[[Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' back-up story. This introduced a green-skinned, blond-haired teenager named Querl Dox, or '''[[Brainiac 5]]''', who believed himself to be Brainiac's 30th century descendant. Unlike his apparent ancestor, [[Brainiac 5]] used his "twelfth-level intellect" for the forces of good, and joined the [[Legion of Super Heroes|Legion]] alongside [[Supergirl]], with whom he fell in love. His home planet was given variously as Yod or [[Colu]].

===Re-created===
[[Image:Action545.png|180px|thumb|left|Brainiac's robotic incarnation in ''Action Comics'' #545.<br>Art by [[Gil Kane]].]]
DC Comics attempted to re-define several aspects of its ''Superman'' series in the 1980s, in order to boost sagging sales.  At the same time [[Lex Luthor]] acquired his green-and-purple battlesuit, Braniac was re-envisioned (under the auspices of writer [[Marv Wolfman]]).  In ''[[Action Comics]]'' #544 (June 1983), Brainiac had constructed a giant, artificial, computer-controlled planet and used it in his latest attempt to destroy Superman; unfortunately, his defeat at the hands of the Man of Steel left him trapped at the center of the planet, unable to escape. 

He was forced to make a nearby star explode in a [[nova]] in order to destroy the machine-world and allow him to re-create his form.  His new body (designed by [[Ed Hannigan]]) had the appearance of a [[skeleton]] of living metal with a grey, [[honeycomb]]-patterned "braincase."<ref>Who's Who in the DC Universe</ref>  He also created a [[starship]] to house his new body, that was actually an extension of himself; the ship was shaped like his own skull, with metal tentacles dangling from it that he could manipulate at will.  Brainiac retained this appearance until after the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]].''

As part of Brainiac's re-creation, Wolfman added a new aspect to Brainiac's personality.  During his regeneration, Brainiac experienced a vision in which he saw Superman in the guise of a God-like "Master Programmer."  This Master Programmer was responsible for a massive conspiracy to destroy Brainiac and keep him from achieving perfection (and domination of the universe).  From this vision, Brainiac concluded that it was necessary for him to destroy the Master Programmer in order to achieve his goal -- therefore, his ultimate goal was to destroy Superman, who he saw as the Master Programmer's "angel of death."  This new, insane motivation re-cast Brainiac as a cold-hearted, ruthless machine, whose "mind has absorbed all the knowledge this universe has to offer", and he appeared several times in this aspect until he was re-written.  Further [[retcon]]s of Brainiac removed the "Master Programmer" aspect of his personality entirely.

===Post-Crisis Brainiac===
[[Image:Vridoxpost.pngâ€Ž|180px|thumb|Brainiac's second post-Crisis incarnation.]]
In the post-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] [[DC Universe]], Brainiac's history was dramatically altered. Vril Dox was now a radical [[Colu]]an scientist who, having attempted to overthrow the Computer Tyrants of [[Colu]], was sentenced to death. In his last moments, his consciousness was attracted to Milton Fine, a human sideshow mentalist who worked under the alias "Brainiac." Needing cranial fluid to maintain his possession of Fine, Dox went on a murder spree. He discovered that Fine had genuine [[psychic]] powers, which he frequently wielded against [[Superman]]. This version of Brainiac made his first appearance in ''[[Adventures of Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]]''  #438 (March 1988). 

Brainiac was later captured by [[Lex Luthor]], but used his powers to take control of [[LexCorp]]. Under Brainiac's mental domination, [[LexCorp]] scientists restored his [[Colu]]an form. The [[diode]]s in Brainiac's head now increased and stabilized his mental powers, as well as allowing him direct access to computer banks. He continued to plague [[Superman]], using a combination of mental powers and computer control. On one occasion, Brainiac even returned to his pre-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] incarnation's city-shrinking tactics.

In the crossover story ''[[Invasion! (DC Comics)|Invasion!]]'', it was revealed that, prior to its dispersion, the Computer Tyrants allowed Dox to clone a lab assistant, [[Vril Dox]] II, who would go on to form [[L.E.G.I.O.N.]], and (although he never uses the name) is the post-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] version of Brainiac 2.

====''Panic in the Sky''====
In the early 1990s, Brainiac returned with a vengeance in a storyline entitled "Panic in the Sky". He seized control of [[Warworld]] and managed to convince Maxima to assist him. Then he brainwashed Supergirl (Matrix) and the alien warrior [[Draaga]] before capturing Metron and setting off for Earth. Orion and Lightray of New Genesis attacked Warworld, but they were quickly taken down by Maxima and Supergirl. Brainiac sent the mental image of the new gods captured to Superman in order to taunt him. He also sent his "headship" to Earth in a punitive expedition.

These acts prompted Superman to go on the offense rather than wait for the inevitable invasion. He gathered a coalition of most of the world's superheroes and launched a preemptive strike at Warworld before it could arrive on Earth. A small, elite force was left behind for any scouting forces that would be sent ahead. Superman led the attack on Warworld, where Supergirl and Draaga managed to shrug off their brainwashing and rally to Superman (although Draaga was killed in the fighting). Maxima would shortly switch sides in the fighting too, perceiving Brainiac as the true villain at last. Brainiac briefly took control of some of Earth's heroes, but it was not enough to turn the tide. Flash, Maxima, and the Metal Men attacked him in his lair, where Maxima managed to lobotomize him (but was stopped short of killing him). His vegetative body was taken back to New Genesis for observation.

====Dead Again!====
Brainiac would next emerge about a year after the death and return of Superman. After a dead body appeared in Superman's tomb, prompting the world to wonder if the Superman who was flying around was the original or a fake, Superman began to track down all of his foes who might be capable of such a hoax. While Brainiac was initially eliminated as a suspect, he soon turned out to be the true culprit, creating the illusion even in his comatose state on New Genesis. He managed to revive himself there and returned to Earth in secret. While hidden, he created even more delusions, causing Superman to question his very sanity before realizing who was really at fault. Superman and Brainiac squared off in Metropolis, where Superman taunted the evil villain, claiming that at heart he was really just Milton Fine, a cheap entertainer. This caused some break in Brainiac's mind where Fine's personality reasserted himself, burying Brainiac's. "Fine" was then escorted off to a psychiatric facility.

Brainiac's mind reemerged at the hospital. Brainiac's new plan was to lure Superman there where he managed to pull a "mind switch" on the Man of Steel. Brainiac's mind was put in Superman's body, while Superman's mind was put into the body of a 13 year old mental patient who thought that he was Superman. Brainiac, frustrated with the lack of mental powers Superman's body afforded, came up with a plan to download a vast amount of knowledge into the minds of all Metropolis citizens, thereby using them as a giant storage device. To that end he built a new lair in the center of the city and sealed it off from the outside. Superman, in the body of the kid, managed to infiltrate the city and switch everyone's minds into the right bodies. Unfortunately, this left Brainiac back in control of his original body and he quickly blasted Superman with his psychic abilities. Luckily, the young boy whose body Superman had been in managed to save the day, reversing the flow of information Brainiac had created, jamming all of the vast knowledge into Brainiac. This left him nearly catatonic again, muttering in binary code.

====''The Doomsday Wars''====
During his latest skirmish with [[Superman]] in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], Milton Fine's body was irreparably damaged, leaving Brainiac with only a short time to live. In order to preserve his life, he concocted an elaborate scheme: he had an agent of his, a [[Colu]]an named Prin Vnok, use a [[time travel|time machine]] to travel to the most inhospitable time in existence, the [[End of Time]] itself. Brainiac's goal was to rescue [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]], who had been left there by [[Superman]] and [[Waverider (comics)|Waverider]] to ensure that he would never be a threat again.

Seconds before the forces of [[entropy]] destroyed him forever, Doomsday was taken to safety by Vnok and returned to [[Colu]]. There, a terminally-wounded Brainiac transferred his consciousness into Doomsday's body, temporarily becoming the most powerful being in the universe, a [[genius]] [[psychic]] mind inside an unstoppable, indestructible titan. However, Doomsday's own raging mind would eventually overwhelm even Brainiac's will, forcing him to find another body. Attempting to use a human host to genetically engineer a Doomsday body without the mind while temporarily lodging in Doomsday's head, Brainiac chose to use Pete Ross and Lana Lang's newborn baby, born eight weeks premature and being transported by Superman to the best Neo-Natal Intensive Care Unit in the country. Brainiac intercepted Superman during the attempt and stole the baby to hurt his long-time foe, correctly deducing that it was the child of someone close to Superman. However, Superman thwarted Brainiac's plot by driving him out of Doomsday's body via the use of a telepathy-blocking 'psi-blocker' forcing Brainiac to adopt a robotic body, dubbed '''Brainiac 2.5''', where he would be forever trapped as he couldn't abandon it.

====Brainiac 13====
[[Image:Supesy2k.jpg|Brainiac 13 on the cover of ''Superman Y2K'' #1. Art by [[Jackson Guice]].|thumb|200px]]
At the turn of the [[millennium]], Brainiac revealed that he had placed a sleeper [[computer virus|virus]] in [[LexCorp]]'s [[Y2K bug]] safeguards which was intended to dramatically boost his abilities. Instead, it allowed his upgraded future self, '''Brainiac 13''' (or "B-13"), to arrive from the 64th century. Brainiac 13 began transforming [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] into the 64th century version of the city, which, apparently, he controlled. Although Brainiac 13 was able to gain control of all android superheroes such as [[Red Tornado]], [[Hourman (android)|Hourman]] and the [[Metal Men]] and use them against Superman, Superman discovered during a fight with the [[Eradicator (comics)|Eradicator]] that Brainiac couldn't cope with Kryptonian technology, giving him a plan to stop his old foe's greatest scheme. 

With Luthor using a Kryptonian warsuit and aided by Brainiac's own past self (now possessing the body of Luthor's infant daughter [[Lena Luthor|Lena]]), Superman tricked Luthor into plugging himself into one of Brainiac 13's power conduits, claiming that Luthor would channel the energy through a Kryptonian matrix to destroy Brainiac. Aided by the revived Red Tornado, Superman managed to suck up the microscopic [[nanobots]] that composed Brainiac and transfer them into the warsuit, leaving Brainiac trapped in technology he couldn't understand or use. However, realizing his defeat was inevitable, Brainiac 13 seized his last chance for escape and gave control of Metropolis to Luthor in exchange for Lena/Brainiac 2.5, whom he forced to help him escape.

He returned to Earth during the ''Our Worlds at War'' crossover, in which Earth and its allies fought a multi-front war against Brainiac 13 and [[Imperiex]]. Brainiac 13 claimed to be allying himself with Earth, but this proved to be part of a complex plan to regain control. His chief aide was "Leniac", a green-skinned teenage girl with "control discs" on her forehead, suggesting the [[diode]]s of earlier Brainiacs (and identical to the forehead discs of the "upgraded" [[Brainiac 5#Post-Reboot|Brainiac 5.1]] in the [[Legion of Super Heroes]], and the ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' version of the original Brainiac). Remaining behind the scenes for most of the conflict, at the moment when Imperiex's armour was cracked thanks to the sacrifices of [[Strange Visitor]] and [[Sergeant Rock|General Rock]], Brainiac-13 appeared on the battleground with Warworld, absorbing the Imperiex energies and vowing to use them to rule everything.

In a desperate gambit, Superman dived into the heart of the sun, thus gaining a massive power boost that enhanced his strength significantly. Rapidly realizing that Warworld couldn't be destroyed without releasing Imperiex and triggering another Big Bang, Superman and the [[Martian Manhunter]] formed a brief telepathic link to explain their new plan. With Darkseid's powers weakened, he would use [[Garth (comics)|Tempest]] as a magical focus for his abilities, empowered by the faith and strength of the Amazons, focusing the energy through [[John Henry Irons|Steel]]'s new 'Entropy Aegis' armor (which was created from a burned-out Imperiex probe), and, with Lex Luthor activating a temporal displacement weapon, Superman would subsequently push Warworld through a temporal boom tube, sending both Imperiex Prime's and Brainiac's consciousness back 14 billion years to the Big Bang, destroying both villains through a combined effort. With her master's death, Brainiac 2.5 was expunged from Lena, who reverted to infancy, although the discs remained.

In ''[[Superman]]''  #200 (February 2004), [[Superman]] traveled into the future and battled '''Brainiac 12''', learning that everything Brainiac 13 had done in the past had been designed to ensure things reached the point where Brainiac 13 would be created. Brainiac 12's defeat before his upgrade apparently reversed the advances Brainiac 13 had made to [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]].

====Brainiac 8====
{{main|Indigo (comics)}}
[[Image:Brainiacs.jpg|left|Braniac with his descendant [[Brainiac 8]], as they discuss his use of organics. Art by [[Matthew Clark]].|thumb]] 

Recently, Brainiac used his "granddaughter", Brainiac 8 (aka [[Indigo (comics)|Indigo]]), to kill [[Donna Troy]] in order to ensure the fate of [[Colu]]. [[Indigo (comics)|Indigo]] then infiltrated the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]] until she attacked the team, along with Brainiac and his allies, [[Lex Luthor]], and a brainwashed [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]], who had attacked the [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]]. In the ensuing battle, [[Indigo (comics)|Indigo]] died and [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]] broke away from the brainwashing, while Luthor escaped. While his ship was destroyed, Brainiac's condition and whereabouts after the battle are unknown.

In this storyline, it was revealed that Brainiac was able to utilize Luthor's secret facilities to restore the majority of his organic body. Brainiac 8 chided him for this act of vanity, explaining that, in her time, all of [[Colu]] had abandoned organics. Though it's unclear just what year she originates from, she must be at least a few decades removed from the early 31st century as Brainiac 5, of the [[Legion of Super Heroes]], is an organic Coluan, as are other Coluans from that era. 

When Brainiac 8 tells him that he must "discard [his] organics," Brainiac responds "Someday perhaps. When I've made Superman's home all but uninhabitable." During this scene, he glances into one of his tubes, revealing a robotic form similar to his pre-Crisis incarnation. Shortly after this storyline, the [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]] broke into one of Luthor's labs in order to procure a serum to save a dying [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]]. In this encounter, they discovered many failed attempts in cloning a new body for Brainiac, and fought the so-called '''Brainiac Alpha''', a murderous, aborted [[Clone (genetics)|clone]].

===Pre-Crisis Brainiac in the Post-Crisis Universe===
Later stories suggest elements of Brainiac's pre-Crisis history occurred in the Post-Crisis character's history prior to his possession of Milton Fine and first encounter with Superman. 

''[[History of the DC Universe]]'' mentions his defeat by the [[Omega Men]], as seen in ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' itself. In ''[[Silver Age (DC Comics Title)|The Silver Age: JLA]]'', the Injustice League discovered numerous shrunken alien cities found in Brainiac's abandoned spaceship. ''Superman'' (Vol. 2) #200 reveals Brainiac, and not the alien wizard Tolos, shrunk [[Kandor]] and took it from [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]]. 

===Brainiac's Updated Mechanical form===
In the A.I. arc of [[Superman/Batman]], Brainiac first appeared as a [[Swarm intelligence|swarm of interlinked nanotechnologic units]]. It's operation was to sabotage a [[Waynetech#Wayne Technologies|Waynetech research facility]] accomplished by infecting [[Metallo]] with a computer virus and controlling him from orbit. Superman and Batman tracked Brainiac's signal to an orbital facility and attacked. Brainiac's nanoswarm body was destroyed, though he had infected the [[Metal Men]] during their previous encounter with Metallo. Brainiac proceeded to use them to acquire a prototype [[OMACs|OMAC unit]], which Bruce Wayne had developed from [[the OMAC Project]] through the use of Brainiac 13 nanotechnology. Superman and Batman destroyed the OMAC body with the aid of the Metal Men, after the Metal Men overcame Brainiac's control.

==Powers and abilities==
Brainiac is one of the most intelligent villains in the DC universe, capable of [[Spiritual possession|possessing]] others, creating and manipulating [[computer]] systems, and exerting some control over time and space. 

==In other media==
===Animation===
====''The New Adventures of Superman''====
The standard pre-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] version of Brainiac (the green-skinned robot with skull-[[diode]]s) made his first in  film appearance in the episodes of the [[Filmation]] [[animated series]] ''[[The New Adventures of Superman (animated series)|The New Adventures of Superman]]''.  In this series Brainiac was from the planet Mega whose entire population had perished in a series of atomic wars with the exception of one survivor, Professor Hecla. Hecla created Brainiac and sent him to earth to use his shrinking ray to create a sort of "cosmic [[Noah's ark]]", by shrinking a male and female of each Earth species to take back to repopulate Mega. Brainiac appeared in several episodes of this series which began in 1966.

====''SuperFriends''====
Brainiac would resurface in the ''[[Challenge of the SuperFriends]]'' [[cartoon]], where he is voiced by [[Ted Cassidy]]. who was also the voice of ''[[Black Manta]]''. He also appeared in a short episode, "Superclones", cloning [[Aquaman]] and El Dorado. The mechanical version of Brainiac appeared in [[Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show]] in the episodes ''[[The Wrath of Brainiac]]'' and ''[[The Village of Lost Souls]]''. He next appeared in [[The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians]], in the episode called "Brain Child."

====''Superman: The Animated Series''====
[[Image:Brainiac(STAS).jpg|thumb|Brainiac in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]''.]]
In ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', Brainiac (voiced by [[Corey Burton]], in the [[Affect display|low-affect]] style of [[HAL 9000]] and [[Vic Perrin]]'s opening narration from ''[[The Outer Limits]]'') is the supercomputer that ran most of the day-to-day operations on [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]]. The distinct animated interpretation of the character is rated the 94th greatest villain of all time by [[Wizard (magazine)|''Wizard Magazine'']].<ref>''Wizard'' #177</ref> He senses the imminent destruction of the planet, but rather than warn others, he chooses to save himself and the collected records of [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]]. In Brainiac's mind, as long as the records of Krypton existed, the loss of the planet itself and all its living inhabitants is part of the natural order. 

Brainiac eventually makes his way to Earth, under the pretense of a peaceful exchange of knowledge with [[Lex Luthor]]. Superman, however, discovers Brainiac's true intentions, and with the help of Luthor, defeats Brainiac. Brainiac is seemingly destroyed, but later episodes reveal that the data that Brainiac had uploaded to [[LexCorp]]'s computers were not alien knowledge, but a copy of his programming. In the process, Superman finds out that Brainiac had destroyed and collected data from countless other worlds. Brainiac tries several times to revive himself, first by capturing Luthor and forcing him to build a new body, and another time by taking control of [[Bruce Wayne]], prompting Superman to team up with [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Robin]] in order to find him, but is thwarted each time.

====''Justice League''====
Brainiac reemerged in ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'''s "Twilight", with him attacking Apokolips after Darkseid had suffered a major defeat at the hands of Orion.  This prompts Darkseid to come to the Watchtower and ask the Justice League for help.  The story was a ruse, however, one intended to lure the Justice League, Superman in particular, to Brainiac's mainframe. Brainiac's full plan was to assume the body of Superman for him to inhabit.  Darkseid betrayed Brainiac, however, and in the subsequent battle both the machine intelligence and Darkseid were destroyed.

====''Static Shock''====
In the ''[[Static Shock]]'' two-part [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] episode "A League of Their Own", Brainiac, now reduced to a piece of alien metal kept in stasis, escaped confinement following a [[power failure]] at the [[Justice League]]'s Watchtower. [[Static (comics)|Static]] and [[Gear (Static Shock)|Gear]] had been recruited by the [[Justice League]] to help recharge the Watchtower's generators, but Brainiac took over Gear's Backpack droid, and later turned Richie into a [[cyborg]] under his control. As Brainiac proceeded to use Richie's hands and technological skills to build a warship and take over the [[Justice League]] one by one with small implants inserted in the space where the [[skull]] joins the [[spinal column]], Richie attempted to fight back and tell [[Static (comics)|Static]] the means by which to defeat Brainiac: Backpack's remote control had an off switch. Static eventually discovered it and was able to stop Brainiac's scheme at the source, ergo saving Earth.

The voice of Brainiac here sounds quite different, but it is still [[Corey Burton]]; the producers of ''[[Static Shock]]'' decided to pitch Burton's voice significantly lower for their show. It can also be noted that even though Braniac is Superman's villain, Superman does not appear with the Justice League in these two episodes.

====''Justice League Unlimited''====
[[Image:Lexiac.jpgâ€Ž|left|thumb|200px|Brainiac fused with [[Lex Luthor]] in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''.]]
During a previous encounter years before (in the ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' episode "Ghost in the Machine"), Brainiac had delivered a nano-robotic probe carrying a portion of his consciousness into [[Lex Luthor]]. It began modifying Luthor's body, subtly controlling him into committing actions that resulted in a major [[story arc]] that occurred throughout the first two seasons of ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''. At the end of the episode "Panic in the Sky" and continuing into the following episode, "[[Divided We Fall]]", Brainiac revealed himself to the [[Justice League]] and assimilated [[nanotechnology]] from the alien Dark Heart machine (from the episode of that name) as well as technology derived from [[Amazo]]. At Luthor's urging, Brainiac merged with Luthor, becoming a single entity possessing Brainiac's goals and approaches tempered by Luthor's ambition and cruelty, with the new purpose of destroying the universe and recreating it in their image. (The ensuing battle featured a Brainiac skull-shaped spaceship similar to the one used by the pre-Crisis metal bodied Brainiac). This version of Brainiac/Luthor was mostly gold and blue, and partially robotic. Though they managed to subdue most of the [[Justice League]] members, Luthor/Brainiac were ultimately defeated by the [[Wally West|Flash]] (who for the first time in the DC Animated Universe became one with the [[Speed Force]] as several of the Flashes have done in the comics).

After the defeat, all that was left of Brainiac was a small piece of its body, which somehow came into the possession of [[Gorilla Grodd]] in the second season of ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''. Luthor himself continued to speak to Brainiac's consciousness, apparently still existing within his own mind (however, it was never made clear if this was actually Brainiac's consciousness, or a product of an instable Luthor's mind.) Urged by Brainiac to escape prison, Luthor was picked up by Grodd's [[Legion of Doom (comics)|Legion of Doom]] and convinced to join by the promise of getting his hands on the Brainiac fragment, with which he could reconstruct and re-merge with him. Though he eventually usurped leadership of the [[Legion of Doom (comics)|Legion]] from Grodd, Luthor remained unable to unlock the Brainiac fragment for some reason, and instead used it to locate the quadrant of the universe where Brainiac had been destroyed along with [[Darkseid]]. Using a combination of technology and magic, Luthor intended to reintegrate the surviving pieces into a new version of the android, only to wind up resurrecting [[Darkseid]] (who ''may'' have been combined in some way with Brainiac; his armor now bore markings reminiscent of Brainiac's forms, which it did not posses before), who then "rewarded" those responsible for his resurrection by attempting to grant them a quick death (by destroying the [[Legion of Doom (comics)|Legion]]'s headquarters/craft with a single Omega Blast) and thereafter returned to [[Apokolips]].

Luthor and the surviving [[Legion of Doom (comics)|Legion]] members returned to Earth and joined forces with the [[Justice League]] to stop [[Apokolips]]' attack on Earth, and Luthor claimed to no longer be able to hear Brainiac inside his head, although when Luthor was then transported to the Source Wall and recovered the [[Anti-Life Equation]], it was claimed that only a "twelfth-level intellect" could accomplish this, and the only individual with this [[IQ]] is Brainiac. Ultimately, however, it was never explicitly revealed by the series' end whether or not Brainiac had ''ever'' truly existed within Luthor's mind after his discorporation by the Flash, or if Luthor was partially insane.

In the year 2979, as it is revealed in the ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' episode "New Kids In Town", Brainiac still lives and has made enemies of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]. During that time, it learned how to pass its code down biologically and created [[Brainiac 5]]; however, this iteration of the Brainiac identity turned out to be good, and joined the Legion in an effort to atone for the crimes of his predecessors. The original Brainiac traveled back to the past to kill the teenage [[Clark Kent]] before he would become [[Superman]]. Thanks in part to [[Cosmic Boy]], [[Chameleon Boy]], and [[Saturn Girl]], Clark defeated Brainiac, and it was teleported into the [[sun]], where it incinerated, destroying what may have been the last remnant of its original form for good. When [[Supergirl]], along with [[John Stewart (comics)|Green Lantern]] and [[Green Arrow]], was pulled to the 30th century to help the [[Legion of Super Heroes|Legion]], she and Brainiac 5 began to fall in love and Supergirl ultimately decided to stay in the 30th century. This left Lantern and Green Arrow in the unenviable position of telling [[Superman]] that Kara had stayed behind partly because of her feelings for [[Brainiac 5]], and of trying to explain why that is not a problem.

====''Legion of Super Heroes''====
[[Image:Brainiac.png|thumb|Brainiac in '' [[Legion of Super Heroes]] '']]
In the season 2 ''[[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)|Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' episode ''Message in a Bottle'', Brainiac 5 ventures into the past to learn of the atrocities caused by his predecessor, Brainiac 1.0 (with a reprisal from Corey Burton). He then confesses to [[Brainiac 5]] that he has watched him since he came online. Brainiac then offers Brainiac 5 a chip that he tells him that it's an upgrade that will open "new avenues of possibility", then ending his statement with "The choice is yours." Brainiac 5 then downloads the information, unbeknownst to him that it was just a malicious programming code that Brainiac implemented in the chip. This is proven during the end of the episode when Brainiac 5 smiles evilly.

====''Superman: Brainiac Attacks''====
Brainiac returned in the 2006 [[direct-to-video]] animated feature ''[[Superman: Brainiac Attacks]]'', where he was voiced by [[Lance Henriksen]]. Note that while the DTV uses the same style of animation, it is ''not'' in continuity with the [[DC Animated Universe]]. The movie begins with Brainiac landing on Earth in a [[meteor]]. Brainiac goes around absorbing information until [[Superman]] destroys him with his [[Arctic]] breath. However, Lex Luthor is able to save a piece of Brainiac and forms an alliance with the Kryptonian robot. Luthor gives Brainiac a new body, made from his satellite weapon. Brainiac is also equipped with a [[Kryptonite]] beam and the ability to track Superman by his Kryptonian [[DNA]]. Luthor and Brainiac's bargain revolved around Brainiac using his new body to destroy Superman, and afterwards, Brainiac would allow himself to be defeated by Luthor and leave for another planet so that Luthor would appear as a hero. However, Brainiac betrayed Luthor after he believed [[Superman]] was destroyed, but in the end, Superman returned to defeat Brainiac after a lengthy battle. This time, Superman made sure that this copy of Brainiac was completely destroyed.

===''Smallville''===
[[Image:Image-fine.jpeg|thumb|right|[[James Marsters]] as ''Professor Milton Fine'' in ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]''.]]
In the fifth season of ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'', Brainiac is introduced as a recurring villain, played by [[James Marsters]]. He takes the name of "Milton Fine", posing as a Professor at Central Kansas A&M University. He is mostly referred to by his assumed name: [[Jor-El]] refers to him as the "Brain InterActive Construct" ("[[Smallville (Season 5)#Vessel|Vessel]]") and [[Smallville characters (season 6)#Raya|Raya]] is the first person to call him "Brainiac" ("[[Smallville (Season 6)#Fallout|Fallout]]"). In the seventh season episode "Lara", Lara mentions that Jor-El created Brainiac in an attempt to save Krypton.

''Smallville''{{'}}s interpretation of Brainiac is similar to the DCAU version; that of a self-aware computer in humanoid form with a Kryptonian origin. He can duplicate the standard array of Kryptonian powers, as well as interface with most technology. He is composed of a black, crystalline liquid which allows him to change shape and create fully-functional copies of himself which can operate anywhere on Earth. It is implied that the black [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonian]] spaceship which he emerges from is in fact his true form, while the Milton Fine persona and his clones are merely created to carry out his will.

When first introduced, Milton Fine's primary function is to free [[General Zod]] and turn Earth into a suitable planet for Zod to rule. He first appears at the end of the episode "[[Smallville (Season 5)#Arrival|Arrival]]", taking human form from a black liquid that oozes from the [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonian]] spaceship which crash-landed in the [[Smallville (Season 4)|Season 4]] finale. He takes on the guise of a Professor of World History at Central Kansas A&M University, and hires [[Clark Kent]] as a research assistant. Fine gains Clark's trust using clever deceptions and his mimicked Kryptonian powers to convince him that he is a fellow Kryptonian. To free Zod, he infects Martha with a mysterious Kryptonian disease in the episode "[[Smallville (Season 5)#Solitude|Solitude]]", claiming that it is Jor-El's doing and that he must take him to the [[Fortress of Solitude]] to save her. He betrays Clark and creates a portal to the Phantom Zone, but Clark stops him. He had intended for Clark to be Zod's vessel (Zod having had his body and spirit separated), but since [[Jor-El]]'s spirit proved to be too strong in Clark, he was forced to turn elsewhere.  He creates a special virus to change Lex into a suitable host then unleashes a [[computer virus]] that quickly infects every computer system on Earth, shutting down every bit of technology and causing widespread chaos. In one last confrontation, Clark chooses to kill Fine instead of Lex, in an effort to prevent Zod's coming, but inadvertently causes the very thing Fine was trying to accomplish.  Clark's efforts, though they free Zod, manage to destroy Fine and all his copies.

In the sixth season episode "Zod", Lex (possessed by General Zod) transforms the black ship into a small hexagonal disk, and uses it to begin recreating Krypton on Earth. Clark uses heat vision to destroy the disk, leaving only a charred half of it behind. A Phantom Zone escapee named "Baern" later feeds off of the energy within the broken disk, reducing it to a pile of ash.

In the seventh season episode "Wrath", the ashes have since liquefied into an evolving, sentient organism which Lex's scientists are keeping in a kryptonite-lined vial â€” one of Lex's scientists explains that it "seems to want out", hence the precaution. During an attempt to stop a superpowered Lana, Clark unknowingly releases the organism when he breaks the vial to use the kryptonite within. The organism infects a nearby female scientist shortly thereafter. It saps her body of all metallic elements and moves on, but not before she is found by Lana. The disheveled woman repeats a numeric code in Kryptonian indicating that Brainiac is trying to reboot, and that each attempt gets him closer to achieving that goal.

===Books===

The Silver-Age Brainiac appears in [[The Last Days of Krypton]], a novel by [[Kevin J. Anderson]] <ref> The Last Days of Krypton By Kevin J. Anderson. ISBN 006134074X </ref>

===Film===
As of 2007 Brainiac has not appear in any film. However, has been considered for some Superman films in the pre-production stages.

*Brainiac was considered to be the main villain for ''[[Superman III]]'', along with [[Mr. Mxyzptlk]], when [[Ilya Salkind]] made an early treatment.  In the treatment, Brainiac was from Colu and has discovered [[Supergirl]] in the same way of how Superman crashed landed and was founded by the Kents. Brainiac is portrayed as a surrogate father to Supergirl and eventually fell in love with his "daughter", who did not reciprocate his feelings, as she had fallen in love with Superman. [http://www.supermancinema.co.uk/superman3/general/script/s3_original_idea.pdf] However, Warner Bros. rejected the treatment, and the final product featured a powerful computer as a major "villain".

*Brainiac was considered as a villain in the scrapped ''[[Superman Reborn]]'' and ''[[Superman Lives]]'' film projects. Most notably, the villain was featured with [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] in [[Kevin Smith]]'s version of the script, which was later discarded by director [[Tim Burton]]. Burton's own script included Brainiac's intellect bonding with Luthor, as would later happen in ''Justice League Unlimited'' (and which had previously been seen in the comic book story ''[[Whatever Happened To The Man of Tomorrow?]]'') <ref>{{cite book |last=Hughes |first=David |title=The Greatest Sci-Fi Films Never Made | origyear=2002 |publisher= Titan Books|isbn=1-84023-428-8 |pages=pp176-179 |chapter=The Death of Superman Lives}} </ref>

*Brainiac is a rumored candidate as one of the main villains that may appear in the 2009 sequel to ''[[Superman Returns]]'', titled ''Superman: The Man of Steel''. But no speculation is furthered detailed at the time of which villain will be used.

===Video Games===
*Brainiac was the main villain and boss in the 1992 Sunsoft game [[Superman (Sunsoft game)|Superman]].
*In ''[[Superman 64]]'', Brainiac, from the DCAU, appears not only as a villain and level boss, but also as a playable character in multiplayer.
*Superman was forced to stop Brainiac and save the world after Brainiac kidnapped [[Lois Lane]] in the [[Sega Master System]] and [[Sega Genesis]] video game Superman: Man of Steel.
*In the [[Xbox]] video game, ''[[Superman: Man of Steel]]'', Brainiac 13 is the final boss of the game.  Players must compete against B13 drones throughout the game, before facing the android on the final level.
*Brainiac is a featured major villain in the video game [[Justice League Heroes]] and a Brainiac duplicate was the 1st level boss.

==Cultural references==
{{Trivia|date=September 2007}}
* The band [[The Dukes of Stratosphear]], an alter-ego for [[XTC]], released a song called "Brainiac's Daughter" on their 1987 album ''[[Psonic Psunspot]]''. The lyrics include references to the bottled city of [[Kandor]] and the [[Daily Planet]]. Songwriter [[Andy Partridge]] has said of the song: ''"Right, well, Brainiac is the character in the [[Superman]] comics, the evil [[genius]] with the green skin and the sort of lightbulb screwed in his head. He was like a Martian [[Lex Luthor]] and I thought he'd be a wonderful [[psychedelic]] subject to write about, and his potential daughter: I don't think he had one but if he had she would have been, well, colorful, mauve and purple."'' This reference eventually came full circle when [[Alex Ross]] and [[Mark Waid]] created a background character named "Brainiac's Daughter" in the 1996 limited series ''[[Kingdom Come (comic)|Kingdom Come]]''. The band Royal recorded a cover version of the song for the 2006 compilation album ''[[Sound of Superman]]'', released by [[Rhino Records]] in conjunction with the opening of the movie ''[[Superman Returns]]''.

==Other versions==

* Brainiac has appeared in the ''Justice League Unlimited'' spin-off comic book. His sole appearance was in issue #1.

* In [[JLA: Earth 2]], Brainiac is a biological organism enslaved to [[Ultraman (comics)|Ultraman]], resembling a head in a jar capable of animating multiple robot bodies at once. Unlike other reversals in the anti-matter universe, this version of Brainiac still retains the some motivations - that is to say, as a computer, he has no morality to be inverted.

* In [[The Dark Knight Strikes Again]], Brainiac is similar to his Pre-Crisis self and allied with [[Lex Luthor]]. This version is headquartered in Siberia, is able to inhabit multiple bodies at once and blackmails Superman by threatening the inhabitants of the bottled city of [[Kandor]].
