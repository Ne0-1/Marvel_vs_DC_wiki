'''Brainiac''' is a fictional [[supervillain]] in [[DC Comics]], most often appearing as an opponent of [[Superman]].  

==Pre-Crisis==

First appearing in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #242 ([[July]] [[1958]]), Brainiac was a bald, green-skinned humanoid, who arrived on Earth and shrunk various cities, including [[Metropolis (Superman)|Metropolis]], storing them in bottles with the intent of using them to restore the (unnamed) world he ruled. He was accompanied by a "space monkey" named Koko.

While fighting Brainiac, Superman discovered the villain had previously shrunk the [[Krypton (planet)|Kryptonian]] city of [[Kandor]]. He was able to restore the Earth cities to full size, but the Kandorians sacrificed their restoration to help him. Superman stored the city in his [[Fortress of Solitude]], vowing to return the natives to full size.

Brainiac's legacy was revealed in ''Action Comics'' #276, in a [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] back up story. This introduced the green-skinned, blond-haired teenager Querl Dox, or '''[[Brainiac 5]]''', who believed himself to be Brainiac's 30th century descendant. Unlike his apparent ancestor, Brainiac 5 used his "twelfth level intellect" for good, and joined the Legion alongside [[Supergirl]], with whom he fell in love. His home planet was given variously as Yod or [[Colu]].

In ''Superman'' #167 ([[Feb]] [[1964]]) it was discovered that Brainiac was a machine, created by the "Computer Tyrants of [[Colu]]" as a spy. To increase the illusion that he was alive, he was given a "son", a young Coluan boy who was given the name Brainiac 2, but escaped. This was Brainiac 5's ancestor. It was later revealed that his name was Vril Dox, and that he went on to lead the revolt against the Computer Tyrants.

It was in this story that Brainiac first appeared with a distinctive gridwork of red [[diode]]s across his head, later explained as the "electric terminals of his sensory nerves". This would remain his appearance until ''Action Comics'' #544 ([[June]] [[1983]]), in which he was forced to create a new body, a metallic skeleton with a green, honeycomb-patterned "braincase". He retained his appearance until the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]].''

==Post-Crisis==

In the Post-Crisis [[DC Universe]], Brainiac's history was dramatically altered. Vril Dox was now a radical Coluan scientist who, having attempted to overthrow the Computer Tyrants, was sentenced to death. In his last moments, his consciousness was attracted to Earthly sideshow mentalist Milton Fine, who worked under the alias "Brainiac". Needing cranial fluid to maintain his possession of Fine, Dox went on a murder spree. He discovered Fine had genuine [[psychic]] powers, which he frequently used on Superman. This version of Brainiac made his first appearance in ''Adventures of Superman'' #438 (March 1988).

Brainiac was later captured by [[Lex Luthor]], but used his powers to wrest control of [[Lexcorp]] away from him. Under his mental domination, Lexcorp scientists restored his Coluan form. The diodes in his head now increased and stabilised his mental powers, as well as allowing him direct access to computer banks. He continued to plague Superman, using a combination of mental powers and computer control. On one occasion he even returned to his pre-Crisis incarnation's city-shrinking tactics.

In the [[crossover]] story ''Invasion!'' it was revealed that, prior to his dispersion, the Computer Tyrants had allowed Vril Dox to clone a lab assistant. This was [[Vril Dox II]], who would go on to form [[L.E.G.I.O.N.]], and (although he never uses the name) is the post-Crisis version of Brainiac 2.

To confuse things further, following the loss of Milton Fine's body, Vril Dox would place his consciousness in a robot body he called Brainiac 2.5. He became briefly obsessed with gaining Superman's form.

At the turn of the [[millennium]], Brainiac revealed he had placed a sleeper virus in Lexcorp's [[Y2K bug]] safeguards. This was intended to dramatically boost his abilities. Instead it allowed '''Brainiac 13''' to arrive from the 64th century. B-13 began transforming Metropolis into the 64th century version of the city, which, apparently, he controlled. When it became apparent he was to be defeated by the combined efforts of Luthor, Superman and his own past self (now possessing Luthor's infant daughter), he gave control of the city to Luthor in exchange for Lena/Brainiac 2.5, who he forced to help him escape.

He returned to Earth during the ''Our Worlds At War'' crossover, in which Earth and its allies fought a multifront war against Brainiac 13 and [[Imperiex]]. Brainiac 13 claimed to be allying himself to Earth, but this proved to be part of a complex plan to regain control. His chief aide was "Leniac", a green-skinned teenager with "control discs" on her forehead, suggesting the diodes of earlier Brainiacs (and identical to the forehead discs of the "upgraded" [[Brainiac 5#Post-Reboot|Brainiac 5.1]], in the Legion, and the Animated Series version of the original Brainiac).

At the end of the war Brainiac 13 and Imperiex were both sent back in time, becoming part of the Big Bang, and Brainiac 2.5 was expunged from Lena, who reverted to infancy, although the discs remained.

In ''Superman'' #200 (Feb 2004), Superman travelled into the future and battled Brainiac 12, learning that everything Brainiac 13 had done in the past had been designed to ensure things reached the point where Brainiac 13 would be created. B-12's defeat before his upgrade apparently reversed the advances B-13 had made to Metropolis.

==Appearances in other media==
===Animation===
The standard pre-Crisis version of the character - the green-skinned robot with skull-diodes - was seen on the ''[[Super Friends]]'' [[cartoon]]. The mechanical version appeared in later iterations of the series, when [[Darkseid]] was the primary antagonist. In a famous [[Cartoon Network]] parody, Brainiac pleads with Luthor for a "decent pair of pants", prompting [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]] to utter the now-famous reply, "Solomon Grundy want pants too!"

Brainiac was also seen in episodes of the Filmation animated series "The New Adventures of Superman". This was the green-skinned robot version as well, who was first seen using his shrinking ray to create a sort of "cosmic Noah's ark", by shrinking a male and female of each earth species to take back to his dying homeworld. He appeared in several episodes of this series which began in 1966.

[[image:Brainiac(STAS).jpg|frame|Brainiac from ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'']] In ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', Brainiac (voiced by [[Corey Burton]], in the style of [[HAL 9000]] and Vic Perrin's opening narration from [[The Outer Limits]]) was the supercomputer that ran most of the day-to-day operations on [[Krypton (planet)|Krypton]]. It sensed the imminent destruction of the planet, but rather than warn others, it chose to save itself and the collected records of Krypton. In its mind, as long as the records of Krypton existed, the loss of the planet itself - and all its living inhabitants - was acceptable. It also knew that if word of Krypton's impeding doom got out, it would be forced to calculate a way to stop this, which Brainiac knew to be impossible and would only distract him from the more essential task of saving Krypton's records. Brainiac uploaded its core program and all of the collected data to an artificial satellite. Years later, it was discovered by an alien spacecraft which Brainiac hijacks and killing its crew, and began to explore the universe. Each time it came to an inhabited world, it would upload all the knowledge it could from that world, then destroy it - decreasing the number of beings who have access to the knowledge makes it that much more valuable. Along with raw data, it also assimilated whatever useful technology it could find, improving itself with every world it visited (not unlike the [[Borg]] of [[Star Trek]]). It eventually made its way to Earth, under the pretense of a peaceful exchange of knowledge with [[Lex Luthor]]. Superman discovered Brainiac's true intentions, and with the help of Lex Luthor defeated him. Brainiac was seemingly destroyed, but later episodes revealed that the data that Brainiac had downloaded into LexCorp's computers were not alien knowledge, but a copy of Brainiac's programming. It tried several times to revive itself, first by capturing Luthor and forcing him to rebuild him, and another time by taking control of [[Bruce Wayne]], prompting Superman to team up with [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] in order to find him.

In the animated series ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'', [[Darkseid]], the lord of [[Apokolips]], struck a deal with the Justice League to save his planet when Brainiac came to conquer it.  When the League arrived to stop the attack (due to the pleads of Darkseid), many were taken hostage by the two villains.  While Brainiac was attempting to deliver its mind into Superman, Darkseid betrayed him and hacked into its systems.  After a battle between Brainiac (controlled by Darkseid) and the League, the ship they were on exploded, seemingly killing both Brainiac and Darkseid.  

In the animated series ''[[Static Shock]]'', Brainiac, now reduced to a piece of alien metal kept in stasis, escaped confinement following a [[power failure]] at JL H.Q. Virgil Hawkins, aka "Static", was tapped to help recharge the generators, along with Richie, aka Gear. The rogue bit of data that was Brainiac took over Gear's Backpack droid, and later turned Richie into a [[cyborg]] under his control. As Brainiac proceeded to use Richie's hands and technoskills to build a warship and to take over the League one by one with small implants inserted in the space where the [[skull]] joins the [[spinal column]], Richie attempted to fight back and to tell his friend how to defeat the rogue program: Backpack's remote control had an off switch. Static eventually figured it out and was able to stop Brainiac's scheme at the source, saving Earth. (The voice of Brainiac here sounds quite different, but it is still Corey Burton; the ''Static Shock'' producers decided to pitch Burton's voice significantly lower for their show.)

[[IMAGE:Luthoriac.jpg|right|frame|Brainiac infused with Lex Luthor in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' season finale, "Divided We Fall"]]
However, Brainiac had delievered a portion of its consciousness into Lex Luthor during a previous encounter years before.  Brainiac started to subtly control Luthor into committing actions that resulted in a major story arc that occurred in the first two seasons of the new ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''. Brainiac assimilated [[nanotechnology]] from the alien "Dark Heart" machine and technology derived from the [[Amazo]] android.  On Luthor's urging, Brainiac and Luthor combined into a single entity, with Brainiac's goals and approaches tempered by Luthor's ambition and cruelty.  The traditional Brainiac skull-shaped starship and Brainiac controlling Lex Corp storyline was evident in the episode "Divided We Fall."  This version of Brainiac was mostly grey and blue, and partially robotic. This Brainiac was beaten by the Justice League, and the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] in particular. 

After the defeat, all that was left of Brainiac was a small piece of its body, which came into the possession of [[Gorilla Grodd]]. Knowing that Luthor desired to merge with Brainiac again, Grodd used the piece to enlist Luthor into his [[Legion of Doom]]. Currently, Luthor also speaks to a fragment of Brainiac's consciousness apparently still in his mind, and the fragment has told Luthor to work with Grodd until they can get the piece and rebuild Brainiac's body. No one else can see or hear the Brainiac fragment, and it is an open question at present whether this is truly a surviving part of Brainiac or simply that Luthor has gone insane.

In the year 2979, Brainiac still lives and has made enemies of the [[Legion of Superheroes]].  It traveled back to the year 1979 to destory a teenage Clark Kent before he would become Superman.  Thanks in part to Cosmic Boy, Chameleon Boy and Saturn Girl, Clark has defeated Brainiac and was teleported into the Sun, where it incinerated, destroying what may be the last remnant of Brainiac.

===Television===
In the fifth season of ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'', Brainiac is a semi-regular character, played by [[James Marsters]]. He has appeared in episodes 501 ("Arrival"), 504 ("Aqua"), 505 ("Thirst"), 507 ("Splinter"), and 508 ("Solitude"). In all of these episodes, the character is referred to only as Milton Fine.  The name ''Brainiac'' is not used on screen, but was widely used in [http://www.kryptonsite.com/brainiac.htm press releases], [http://tv.zap2it.com/tveditorial/tve_main/1,1002,271%7C96542%7C1%7C,00.html news] and [http://www.whedon.info/article.php3?id_article=12385 interviews].

In "Arrival", the character is seen taking form from a liquid metal that oozed out of the black spaceship which arrived in the previous season's finale.  In the episode "Aqua" (which focuses on Clark meeting [[Aquaman]]), Brainiac appears as Professor Milton Fine.  He hires Clark Kent as his research assistant, stating that he intends to write a book about Lex's misdeeds.  The episode "Splinter" focuses on Silver [[Kryptonite]] which was artificially created from Brainiac's liquid metal body.  In the episode, Fine tells Clark that he is another Kryptonian, and that Clark should not put so much trust into his lesser human friends and family. In "Solitude", it is revealed that "Fine" is in fact an [[artificial intelligence]], created by Kryptonians, that desires to free [[General Zod]].  At the episode's climax, Fine/Brainiac is impaled on a crystal in the Fortress of Solitude, and disappears; at the same time, so does the spaceship he came from.  It is likely that the character is not dead, since James Marsters is scheduled to return to the series.

''Smallville'''s interpretation of Brainiac as an artificial intelligence from Krypton is similar to the one used in ''Superman: The Animated Series'' and ''Justice League''.
