'''Brainiac''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]] and frequent opponent of [[Superman]]. Created by [[Otto Binder]], he first appeared in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #242 ([[1958#July|July 1958]]). Due to complex storylines involving [[time travel]], [[cloning]], and revisions of [[DC Comics|DC]]'s [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]], several variations of Brainiac have appeared.

Though at his core Brainiac is formless, most incarnations depict him as a bald, green-skinned [[Extraterrestrial_life_in_popular_culture|alien]] [[android]] from the planet [[Colu]], and one of the most intelligent villains in the [[DC universe]], capable of [[Spiritual possession|possessing]] others, creating and manipulating [[computer]] systems, and exerting some control over time and space. He is responsible for shrinking [[Kandor]], the [[capital city]] of [[Superman]]'s home planet [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]] which the hero has vowed to restore.

Brainiac has been one of [[Superman]]'s most important enemies ever since the villain's first appearance, and was adapted into the ''[[Super Friends]]'' [[animated series]], as well as the subsequent [[DC Animated Universe]] and the live-action [[Superman]] adaptation ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]].''

Brainiac's name derives from the -IAC naming trend among [[:Category:One-of-a-kind computers|early electronic computers]], after [[ENIAC]]: [[ILLIAC I|ILLIAC]], [[JOHNNIAC]], [[MANIAC I|MANIAC]], [[SILLIAC]], ''etc.''

==Pre-Crisis Brainiac==
[[Image:ActionComics242.jpg|thumb|left|Cover to ''[[Action Comics]]'' #242, Brainiac's first appearance. Art by [[Curt Swan]] and Stan Kaye.]]

First appearing in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #242 (July 1958), Brainiac was a bald, green-skinned [[humanoid]] who arrived on Earth and shrank various cities, including [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], storing them in bottles with the intent of using them to restore Bryak, the planet he ruled.

While fighting Brainiac, [[Superman]] discovered that the villain had previously shrunk the [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonian]] city of [[Kandor]]. He was able to restore the Earth cities to full size, but the Kandorians sacrificed their restoration to help him. [[Superman]] stored the city in his [[Fortress of Solitude]], vowing to return the natives to full size.

===Brainiac 5===
Brainiac's legacy was revealed in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #276, in a ''[[Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' back-up story. This introduced a green-skinned, blond-haired teenager named Querl Dox, or '''[[Brainiac 5]]''', who believed himself to be Brainiac's 30th century descendant. Unlike his apparent ancestor, [[Brainiac 5]] used his "twelfth-level intellect" for the forces of good, and joined the [[Legion of Super Heroes|Legion]] alongside [[Supergirl]], with whom he fell in love. His home planet was given variously as Yod or [[Colu]].

In ''[[Superman]]''  #167 (February 1964), it was discovered that Brainiac was a machine created by the Computer Tyrants of [[Colu]] as a spy. To increase the illusion that he was alive, Brainiac was given a "son", a young [[Colu|Coluan]] boy who was given the name "Brainiac 2", but escaped; this was [[Brainiac 5]]'s ancestor. It was later revealed that his name was [[Vril Dox]], and that he went on to lead a revolt against the Computer Tyrants. It was in this story that Brainiac first appeared with a distinctive gridwork of red [[diode]]s across his head, later explained as the "electric terminals of his sensory nerves"; this would remain his appearance until ''[[Action Comics]]'' #544 (June 1983), in which he was forced to create a new body; a [[skeleton]] of living metal with a grey, [[honeycomb]]-patterned "braincase." <ref>Who's Who in the DC Universe</ref>   Brainiac retained this appearance until after the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]].''

==Post-Crisis Brainiac==
===Vril Dox===
In the post-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] [[DC Universe]], Brainiac's history was dramatically altered. Vril Dox was now a radical [[Colu|Coluan]] scientist who, having attempted to overthrow the Computer Tyrants of [[Colu]], was sentenced to death. In his last moments, his consciousness was attracted to Milton Fine, a human sideshow mentalist who worked under the alias "Brainiac." Needing cranial fluid to maintain his possession of Fine, Dox went on a murder spree. He discovered that Fine had genuine [[psychic]] powers, which he frequently wielded against [[Superman]]. This version of Brainiac made his first appearance in ''[[Adventures of Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]]''  #438 (March 1988).

Brainiac was later captured by [[Lex Luthor]], but used his powers to take control of [[LexCorp]]. Under Brainiac's mental domination, [[LexCorp]] scientists restored his [[Colu|Coluan]] form. The [[diode]]s in Brainiac's head now increased and stabilized his mental powers, as well as allowing him direct access to computer banks. He continued to plague [[Superman]], using a combination of mental powers and computer control. On one occasion, Brainiac even returned to his pre-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] incarnation's city-shrinking tactics.

===''Invasion!''===
In the [[crossover]] story ''Invasion!'', it was revealed that, prior to its dispersion, the Computer Tyrants allowed Dox to clone a lab assistant, [[Vril Dox II]], who would go on to form [[L.E.G.I.O.N.]], and (although he never uses the name) is the post-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] version of Brainiac 2.

===Panic in the Sky===
In the early 1990s, Brainiac returned with a vengeance in a storyline entitled "Panic in the Sky".  He seized control of Warworld and managed to convince Maxima to assist him.  Then he brainwashed Supergirl (matrix) and the alien warrior Draaga before capturing Metron and setting off for Earth.  Orion and Lightray of New Genesis attacked Warworld, but they were quickly taken down by Maxima and Supergirl.  Brainiac sent the mental image of the new gods captured to Superman in order to taunt him.  He also sent his "headship" to Earth in a punitive expedition.

These acts prompted Superman to go on the offense rather than wait for the inevitable invasion.  He gathered a coalition of most of the world's superheros and launched a preemptive strike at Warworld before it could arrive on Earth.  A small, elite force was left behind for any scouting forces that would be sent ahead.  Superman lead the attack on Warworld, where Supergirl and Draaga managed to shrug off their brainwashing and rally to Superman (although Draaga was killed in the fighting).  Maxima would shortly switch sides in the fighting too, perceiving Brainiac as the true villain at last.  Brainiac briefly took control of some of Earth's heroes, but it was not enough to turn the tide.  Flash, Maxima, and the Metal Men attacked him in his lair, where Maxima managed to lobotomize him (but was stopped short of killing him).  His vegetative body was taken back to New Genesis for observation.

===Dead Again!===
Brainiac would next emerge about a year after the Death and Return of Superman.  After a dead body appeared in Superman's tomb, prompting the world to wonder if the Superman who was flying around was the original or a fake, Superman began to track down all of his foes who might be capable of such a hoax.  While Brainiac was intially eliminated as a suspect, he soon turned out to be the true culprit, creating the illusion even in his comatose state on New Gensis.  He managed to revive himself there and returned to Earth in secret.  While hidden, he created even more delusions, causing Superman to question his very sanity before realizing who was really at fault.  Superman and Brainiac squared off in Metropolis, where Superman taunted the evil villain, claiming that at heart he was really just Milton Fine, a cheap entertainer.  This caused some break in Brainiac's mind where Fine's personality reasserted himself, burying Brainiacs.  "Fine" was then escorted off to a psychiatric facility.

===Mistaken Identity===
Brainiac's mind reemerged at the hospital.  Brainiac's new plan was to lure Superman there where he managed to pull a "mind switch" on the Man of Steel.  Brainiac's mind was put in Superman's body, while Superman's mind was put into the body of a 13 year old mental patient--one who thought that he was Superman!  Brainiac, frustrated with the lack of mental powers Superman's body afforded, came up with a plan to download a vast amount of knowledge into the minds of all Metropolis citizens, thereby using them as a giant storage device.  To that end he built a new lair in the center of the city and sealed it off from the outside.  Superman, in the body of the kid, managed to infiltrate the city and switch everyone's minds into the right bodies.  Unfortunately, this left Brainiac back in control of his original body and he quickly blasted Superman with his pyschic abilities.  Luckily, the young boy whose body Superman had been in managed to save the day, reversing the flow of information Brianiac had created, jamming all of the vast knowledge into Brainiac.  This left him completely nearly catatonic again, muttering in binary code.

===''The Doomsday Wars''===
During his latest skirmish with [[Superman]] in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], Milton Fine's body was irreparably damaged, leaving Brainiac with only a short time to live. In order to preserve his life, he concocted an elaborate scheme: he had an agent of his, a [[Colu|Coluan]] named Prin Vnok, use a [[time machine]] to travel to the most inhospitable time in existence, the [[End of Time]] itself. Brainiac's goal was to rescue [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]], who had been left there by [[Superman]] and [[Waverider (comics)|Waverider]] to ensure that he would never be a threat again.

Seconds before the forces of [[entropy]] destroyed him forever, [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] was taken to safety by Vnok and returned to [[Colu]]. There, a terminally-wounded Brainiac transferred his consciousness into [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]]'s body, temporarily becoming the most powerful being in the universe, a [[genius]] [[psychic]] mind inside an unstoppable, indestructible titan. However, [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]]'s own raging mind would eventually overwhelm even Brainiac's will, forcing him to find another body. Although Brainiac attempted to clone a new [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] that he could fully inhabit, his efforts failed and he was forced to adopt a robotic body, dubbed '''Brainiac 2.5'''. He became briefly obsessed with gaining [[Superman]]'s form.

===Brainiac 13===
[[Image:Supesy2k.jpg|Brainiac 13. Cover to ''Superman Y2K'' #1. Art by Jackson Guice.|thumb|225px]]At the turn of the [[millennium]], Brainiac revealed that he had placed a sleeper [[computer virus|virus]] in [[LexCorp]]'s [[Y2K bug]] safeguards; this was intended to dramatically boost his abilities. Instead, it allowed his upgraded future self, '''Brainiac 13''' (or "B-13"), to arrive from the 64th century. Brainiac 13 began transforming [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] into the 64th century version of the city, which, apparently, he controlled. When it became apparent he was to be defeated by the combined efforts of [[Superman]], [[Lex Luthor]], and his own past self (now possessing the body of Luthor's infant daughter Lena), Brainiac 13 gave control of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] to Luthor in exchange for Lena/Brainiac 2.5, whom he forced to help him escape.

He returned to Earth during the ''Our Worlds at War'' crossover, in which Earth and its allies fought a multi-front war against Brainiac 13 and [[Imperiex]]. Brainiac 13 claimed to be allying himself with Earth, but this proved to be part of a complex plan to regain control. His chief aide was "Leniac", a green-skinned teenage girl with "control discs" on her forehead, suggesting the [[diode]]s of earlier Brainiacs (and identical to the forehead discs of the "upgraded" [[Brainiac 5#Post-Reboot|Brainiac 5.1]] in the [[Legion of Super Heroes]], and the ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' version of the original Brainiac). At the end of the war, Brainiac 13 and [[Imperiex]] were both sent back in time, becoming part of the [[Big Bang]], and Brainiac 2.5 was expunged from Lena, who reverted to infancy, although the discs remained.

In the upcoming [[DC Comics|DC]] Minimates action figure line, Brainiac 13 is packaged with Battle Damaged [[Superman]].

In ''[[Superman]]''  #200 (February 2004), [[Superman]] traveled into the future and battled '''Brainiac 12''', learning that everything Brainiac 13 had done in the past had been designed to ensure things reached the point where Brainiac 13 would be created. Brainiac 12's defeat before his upgrade apparently reversed the advances Brainiac 13 had made to [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]].

===Brainiac 8===
{{main|Indigo (comics)}}
[[Image:Outsiders24.jpg|Cover to ''Outsiders'' #24. Art by Mike McKone.|thumb]]Recently, Brainiac used his "granddaughter", Brainiac 8 (aka [[Indigo (comics)|Indigo]]), to kill [[Donna Troy]] in order to ensure the fate of [[Colu]]. [[Indigo (comics)|Indigo]] then infiltrated the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]] until she attacked the team, along with Brainiac and his allies, [[Lex Luthor]], and a brainwashed [[Kon-El|Superboy]], who had attacked the [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]]. In the ensuing battle, [[Indigo (comics)|Indigo]] died and [[Kon-El|Superboy]] broke away from the brainwashing, while Luthor escaped. While his ship was destroyed, Brainiac's condition and whereabouts after the battle are unknown.

In this recent storyline, it was revealed that Brainiac was able to utilize Luthor's secret facilities to restore the majority of his organic body. Brainiac 8 chided him for this act of vanity, explaining that, in her time, all of [[Colu]] had abandoned organics. It is uncertain how this revelation can be reconciled with the continuity of the [[Legion of Super Heroes]].

Shortly after this storyline, the [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]] broke into one of Luthor's labs in order to procure a serum to save a dying [[Kon-El|Superboy]]. In this encounter, they discovered many failed attempts in cloning a new body for Brainiac, and fought the so-called '''Brainiac Alpha''', a murderous, aborted [[Clone (genetics)|clone]].

===Pre-Crisis Brainiac in the Post-Crisis Universe===
Later stories reference Brainiac and not the alien wizard Tolos taking [[Kandor]] from [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]];{{issue}} however, the exact details of this have not yet been explained.

==In other media==
===Animation===
The standard pre-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] version of Brainiac (the green-skinned robot with skull-[[diode]]s) made his first in  film appearance in the episodes of the [[Filmation]] [[animated series]] ''[[The New Adventures of Superman (animated series)|The New Adventures of Superman]]''. This was the green-skinned robot version as well, who was first seen using his shrinking ray to create a sort of "cosmic [[Noah's ark]]", by shrinking a male and female of each Earth species to take back to his creator's dying homeworld. Brainiac appeared in several episodes of this series which began in 1966.

Brainiac would resurface in the ''[[Challenge of the SuperFriends]]'' [[cartoon]], where he is voiced by [[Ted Cassidy]]. He also appeared in a short episode, "Superclones", cloning [[Aquaman]] and El Dorado. The mechanical version of Brainiac appeared in [[Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show]]. In a famous [[Cartoon Network]] parody, Brainiac pleads with [[Lex Luthor]] for a "decent pair of pants", prompting [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]] to utter the now-famous reply, "Solomon Grundy want pants, too!"[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfvR4hl-Gzw]

[[image:Brainiac(STAS).jpg|frame|left|Brainiac in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'']]In ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', Brainiac (voiced by [[Corey Burton]], in the style of [[HAL 9000]] and [[Vic Perrin]]'s opening narration from ''[[The Outer Limits]]'') is the supercomputer that ran most of the day-to-day operations on [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]]. He senses the imminent destruction of the planet, but rather than warn others, he chooses to save himself and the collected records of [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]]. In Brainiac's mind, as long as the records of Krypton existed, the loss of the planet itself and all its living inhabitants is part of the natural order. 

Brainiac eventually makes his way to Earth, under the pretense of a peaceful exchange of knowledge with [[Lex Luthor]]. Superman, however, discovers Brainiac's true intentions, and with the help of Luthor, defeats Brainiac. Brainiac is seemingly destroyed, but later episodes reveal that the data that Brainiac had downloaded into [[LexCorp]]'s computers were not alien knowledge, but a copy of his programming. In the process, Superman finds out that Brainiac had destroyed and collected data from countless other worlds. Brainiac tries several times to revive himself, first by capturing Luthor and forcing him to build a new body, and another time by taking control of [[Bruce Wayne]], prompting Superman to team up with [[Tim Drake|Robin]] in order to find him.

Brainiac would reemerge in ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]''. The episode begins with him attacking Apokolips after Darkseid had suffered a major defeat at the hands of Orion.  This prompts Darkseid to come to the Watchtower and ask the Justice League for help.  The story was a ruse, however, one intended on luring the Justice League and Superman in particular to Brainiac's mainframe.  Darkseid then betrayed Brainiac, however, and in the subsequent battle both the machine intelligence and Darkseid were destroyed.

{{spoiler}}

===Superman: Brainiac Attacks===

Brainiac returned in the 2006 [[direct-to-video]] animated feature ''[[Superman: Brainiac Attacks]]'', where he was voiced by [[Lance Henriksen]].

The movie begins with Brainiac landing on Earth in a [[meteor]]. Brainiac goes around absorbing information until [[Superman]] destroys him with his [[Arctic]] breath. However, Lex Luthor is able to save a piece of Brainiac and forms an alliance with the Kryptonian robot. Luthor gives Brainiac a new body, made from his satellite weapon. Brainiac is also equipped with a [[Kryptonite]] beam and the ability to track Superman by his Kryptonian [[DNA]].

Luthor and Brainiac's bargain revolved around Brainiac using his new body to destroy Superman, and afterwards, Brainiac would allow himself to be defeated by Luthor and leave for another planet so that Luthor would appear as a hero. However, Brainiac betrayed Luthor after he believed [[Superman]] was destroyed, but in the end, Superman returned to defeat Brainiac. This time, Superman made sure that this copy of Brainiac was completely destroyed.
{{endspoiler}}

[[Brainiac 5]] appears in the animated ''[[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)|Legion of Super Heroes]]''.

===Expanded appearances in DC Animated Universe===
====''Justice League''====
In the animated series ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'' episode "Twilight", [[Darkseid]] struck a deal with the [[Justice League]] to save [[Apokolips]] when Brainiac arrived and began attacking the planet. When the League arrived to stop the assault, many of them were taken hostage by the two villains, who were revealed to be working together. While Brainiac was attempting to transfer his mind into [[Superman]], [[Darkseid]] betrayed him and hacked into his systems. After a battle between a [[Darkseid]]-controlled Brainiac and the [[Justice League]], the ship in which they were battling exploded, seemingly killing both Brainiac and [[Darkseid]].

====''Static Shock''====
In the ''[[Static Shock]]'' two-part [[crossover]] episode "A League of Their Own", Brainiac, now reduced to a piece of alien metal kept in stasis, escaped confinement following a [[power failure]] at the [[Justice League]]'s Watchtower. [[Static (comics)|Static]] and [[Gear (Static Shock)|Gear]] were tapped by the [[Justice League]] to help recharge the Watchtower's generators, but Brainiac took over Gear's Backpack droid, and later turned Richie into a [[cyborg]] under his control.

As Brainiac proceeded to use Richie's hands and technological skills to build a warship and take over the [[Justice League]] one by one with small implants inserted in the space where the [[skull]] joins the [[spinal column]], Richie attempted to fight back and tell [[Static (comics)|Static]] the means by which to defeat Brainiac: Backpack's remote control had an off switch. Static eventually discovered it and was able to stop Brainiac's scheme at the source, ergo saving Earth.

The voice of Brainiac here sounds quite different, but it is still [[Corey Burton]]; the producers of ''[[Static Shock]]'' decided to pitch Burton's voice significantly lower for their show.

It can be noted that even though Braniac is Superman's villan, Superman does not appear with the Justice League in these two episodes.

====''Justice League Unlimited''====
[[IMAGE:Luthoriac.jpg|right|thumb|230px|Brainiac infused with [[Lex Luthor]] in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "Divided We Fall"]]During a previous encounter years before (in the ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' episode "Ghost in the Machine"), Brainiac had delivered a nano-robotic probe carrying a portion of his consciousness into [[Lex Luthor]]. It began modifying Luthor's body, subtly controlling him into committing actions that resulted in a major [[story arc]] that occurred throughout the first two seasons of ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''.

At the end of the episode "Panic in the Sky" and continuing into the following episode, "Divided We Fall", Brainiac revealed himself to the [[Justice League]] and assimilated [[nanotechnology]] from the alien Dark Heart machine as well as technology derived from [[Amazo]]. At Luthor's urging, Brainiac merged with Luthor, becoming a single entity possessing Brainiac's goals and approaches tempered by Luthor's ambition and cruelty, with the new purpose of destroying the universe and recreating it in their image.

The traditional Brainiac skull-shaped spaceship and "Brainiac controlling [[LexCorp]]" storyline were evident in "Divided We Fall." This version of Brainiac was mostly gold and blue, and partially robotic. Though they managed to subdue most of the [[Justice League]] members, Luthor/Brainiac were ultimately defeated by the [[Wally West|Flash]].

After the defeat, all that was left of Brainiac was a small piece of its body, which somehow came into the possession of [[Gorilla Grodd]]. Luthor himself continued to speak to Brainiac's consciousness, apparently still existing within his own mind. Urged by Brainiac to escape prison, Luthor was picked up by Grodd's [[Legion of Doom]] and convinced to join by the promise of getting his hands on the Brainiac fragment, with which he could reconstruct and re-merge with him. Though he eventually usurped leadership of the [[Legion of Doom|Legion]] from Grodd, Luthor remained unable to unlock the Brainiac fragment for some reason, and instead used it to locate the quadrant of the universe where Brainiac had been destroyed along with [[Darkseid]]. Using a combination of technology and magic, Luthor intended to reintegrate the surviving pieces into a new version of the android, only to wind up resurrecting [[Darkseid]], who was reformed with extensive Brainiac technology integrated into himself, allowing the dark lord to destroy the [[Legion of Doom|Legion]]'s headquarters/craft and return to [[Apokolips]].

Luthor and the surviving [[Legion of Doom|Legion]] members returned to Earth and joined forces with the [[Justice League]] to stop [[Apokolips]]' attack on Earth, and Luthor claimed to no longer be able to hear Brainiac inside his head, although when Luthor was then transported to the Source Wall and recovered the [[Anti-Life Equation]], it was claimed that only a "twelfth-level intellect" could accomplish this, and the only individual with this [[IQ]] is Brainiac. Ultimately, however, it was never explicitly revealed if Brainiac had ''ever'' truly existed within Luthor's mind, or if Luthor was partially insane.

In the year 2979, as it is revealed in the ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' episode "New Kids In Town", Brainiac still lives and has made enemies of the [[Legion of Super Heroes]]. During that time, it learned how to pass its code down biologically and created [[Brainiac 5]]; however, this iteration of the Brainiac identity turned out to be good, and joined the Legion in an effort to atone for the crimes of his predecessors.  The original Brainiac traveled back to the past to kill the teenage [[Clark Kent]] before he would become [[Superman]]. Thanks in part to [[Cosmic Boy]], [[Chameleon Boy]], and [[Saturn Girl]], Clark defeated Brainiac, and it was teleported into the [[sun]], where it incinerated, destroying what may have been the last remnant of its original form.

When [[Supergirl]], along with [[John Stewart (comics)|Green Lantern]] and [[Green Arrow]], was pulled to the 30th century to help the [[Legion of Super Heroes|Legion]], she and Brainiac began to fall in love and Supergirl ultimately decided to stay in the 30th century.  This left Lantern and Green Arrow in the unenviable position of telling [[Superman]] that Kara had stayed behind partly because of her feelings for [[Brainiac 5]], and of trying to explain why that is not a problem.

===Movies===
Brainiac was also considered as a villain in the scrapped ''[[Superman Reborn]]'' and ''[[Superman Lives]]'' film projects. Most notably, the villain was featured with [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] in [[Kevin Smith]]'s version of the script, which was later discarded by director [[Tim Burton]].

=== Smallville ===
[[Image:Image-fine.jpeg|thumb|left|300px|[[James Marsters]] as Professor Milton Fine in ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'']]
In the fifth season of ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'', Brainiac is introduced as a recurring villain, played by [[James Marsters]]. In all of the episodes in which he appears, he is referred to as "Milton Fine", although he is referred to as the "Brain InterActive Construct" (In the season 6 episode "Fallout", [[Raya (Smallville)|Raya]] specifically calls this "BrainIAC") in the episode "[[Smallville (Season 5)#Vessel|Vessel]]" by [[Jor-El]].  In the season six episode "[[Smallville (Season 6)#Fallout|Fallout]]", Raya is the first person to actually pronounce it "Brainiac". ''Smallville'''s interpretation of Brainiac is similar to the one used in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', ''[[Justice League]]'', and ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''; that of a self-aware computer in humanoid form with a Kryptonian origin.

His first appearance is at the end of the episode "[[Smallville (Season 5)#Arrival|Arrival]]". Brainiac is seen taking human form from a black liquid that oozes from the black [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonian]] spaceship which crash-landed in the [[Smallville (Season 4)|Season 4]] finale. The liquid forms into a bubbling cluster of black crystals that eventually morph into a humanoid body.

The first time Clark is introduced to Brainiac is in the episode [[Smallville (Season 5)#Aqua|Aqua]]. He is acting as a professor of world history at Central Kansas A&M University. He hires [[Clark Kent]] as a research assistant and takes him under his wing. He exhibits the ability to transform his fingers or hands into spike-like weapons (much in the same manner as the [[T-1000]] in ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]''), stabbing and slaying people with them. Fine has no true form, and uses the black ship to create multiple copies of himself. 

Through a little deception, Fine is able to poison Clark and later convince him that he is a fellow Kryptonian. Again Fine uses deception to further sway Clark into his grasp when he strictens Martha with a mysteriously infectious Kryptonian disease in the episode [[Smallville (Season 5)#Solitude|Solitude]]. Fine quickly convinces Clark that it is Jor-El's doing and that he must take him to the [[Fortress of Solitude]] so that they can sever Jor-El's ties to Earth and save Martha. As soon as they are there it's clear that Fine is lying, as he betrays Clark and sets out to free [[General Zod]]. 

Clark meets Fine again in Lex's mansion. Fine claims that Clark was originally intended to be Zod's vessel, but when [[Jor-El]]'s spirit proved to be too strong in Clark, he was forced to turn elsewhere. When Clark refuses to aid him in his plan again, Fine unleashes a [[computer virus]] that quickly infects every computer system on Earth, shutting down every bit of technology and causing widespread chaos. In one last confrontation, Clark chooses to kill Fine instead of Lex, in an effort to prevent Zod's coming, but inadvertantly causes the very thing Fine was trying to accomplish. Clark's efforts, though they freed Zod, manage to destroy Fine, and all his subsequent copies. 

On a humorous note, while posing as a professor, Fine posed the often-repeated question and answer to the class, "Where is the most powerful computer in the universe?", followed by several taps on his own temple, making the subtle joke that his [[artificial intelligence]] is more powerful than their natural intelligence.

===Video Games===

==Cultural references==
* The band [[The Dukes of Stratosphear]], an alter-ego for [[XTC]], released a song called "Brainiac's Daughter" on their 1987 album ''[[Psonic Psunspot]]''. The lyrics include references to the bottled city of [[Kandor]] and the [[Daily Planet]]. Songwriter [[Andy Partridge]] has said of the song: ''"Right, well, Brainiac is the character in the [[Superman]] comics, the evil [[genius]] with the green skin and the sort of lightbulb screwed in his head. He was like a Martian [[Lex Luthor]] and I thought he'd be a wonderful [[psychedelic]] subject to write about, and his potential daughter: I don't think he had one but if he had she would have been, well, colorful, mauve and purple."'' This reference eventually came full circle when [[Alex Ross]] and [[Mark Waid]] created a background character named "Brainiac's Daughter" in the 1996 limited series ''[[Kingdom Come (comic)|Kingdom Come]]''. The band Royal recorded a cover version of the song for the 2006 compilation album ''[[Sound of Superman]]'', released by [[Rhino Records]] in conjunction with the opening of the movie ''[[Superman Returns]]''.
