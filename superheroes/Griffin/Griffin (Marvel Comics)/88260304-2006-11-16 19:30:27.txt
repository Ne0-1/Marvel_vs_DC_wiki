'''Griffin''' is the name of a [[Marvel Comics]] supervillain.

==History==
Johnny Horton was a punk in the New Orleans gangs trying to make a name for himself until a Chicago man used him for some local muscle. Impressing his employer, Horton wanted to be more than a cheap horde resulting in the Chicago man bringing him to the [[Secret Empire]] to be made into a supervillain. Horton didn't know what the Secret Empire does. An unnamed scientist/surgeon that works there followed the Empire's orders by surgically adding wings, a mane, and lion-like paws to his body as well as an experimental mutagenic serum. Empire's #1, #3, and #6 were present at this surgery. When Horton recovered, his face had become white and he's now a freak. Thus, he became Griffin.

His first mission was to kill [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] as part of their campaign against the Brand Corporation. Griffin encountered Beast in his new furry mutation. During the struggle, Griffin was thrown off the building and [[Archangel (comics)|Angel]] only to be attacked by Griffin and rescued by Beast. He later met with Linda Donaldson (Number Nine of Secret Empire) at her office in the Brand Corporation to discuss the case with Beast and his frustration of being turned into a monster.

His next mission was to kill Angel. In his battle with Angel, Beast wrapped his long arms around Griffin's wings causing them to crash into the ground. Griffin was taken away by the Brand Corporation guards (whom are presumed to be working for [[Mad Dog (comics)|Robert Baxter]]).

While in jail, he began to mutate with the serum used on him where his mind went first and ended up developing fanged teeth, a powerful tail, and superhuman strength. He faked being sick and escaped. When he located and confronted the unnamed scientist that changed him, the scientist was thrown to his death when he was unable to tell Griffin where the members of Secret Empire are. The scientist was saved by [[Spider-Man]] and Beast and told them Griffin's origin before dying. With his telepathic ability to control birds, Griffin revealed himself and attacked Spider-Man and Beast until he was defeated on the Brooklyn Bridge.

He later fought [[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]], Angel, and the [[Champions (comics)|Champions]] alongside [[Darkstar (comics)|Darkstar]], [[Rampage (Marvel Comics)|Rampage]], [[Titanium Man]], and [[Crimson Dynamo]] in Los Angeles. They defeated them and imprisoned them in a cell within the San Andreas Fault until Darkstar released them and Griffin was defeated again.

To push his powers to their limits, he attacked Spider-Man with a flock of seagulls and fled to attack the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] mansion only to find [[Wonder Man]] there. During battle, Griffin later mutated with a leonine face and lost the power of speech. Griffin was presumed to have perished in the Astro-Fighter ship fire.

When he was residing in the Adirondack Mountains, he fell under the control of Headlok who used him to attack the West Coast Avengers. He was defeated and sent to the vault.

During [[Iron Man]]'s "Armor Wars," Griffin escaped with [[Vibro]] and was reimprisoned by [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]]. Griffin was seen in the Vault's Cell Block Five during [[Acts of Vengeance]].

The Griffin joined [[Bullet (comics)|Bullet]] and [[Orka (comics)|Orka]] in a breakout where he was stunned by Captain America's shield throw and Henry Pym's force blaster.

He later fought [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]] where Namor had the advantage and defeated Griffin.

When Griffin ended up in Namor's custody, Namor used him to get to the [[Savage Land]] only to be ambushed by [[Super-Skrull]] disguised as [[Iron Fist]].

When Griffin was on Ryker's Island's prison, he was restored to a more humanoid state (presumably his intellect was restored). He was also among the inmates assembled by [[Electro (comics)|Electro]] during the impending breakout which is thwarted by the New Avengers.
