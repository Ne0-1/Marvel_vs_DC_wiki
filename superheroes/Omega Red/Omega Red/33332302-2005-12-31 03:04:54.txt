'''Omega Red''' ('''Arkady Rossovich''') is a [[comic book]] [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]] and a foe of the [[X-Men]].  His first appearance was ''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #4 ([[1992]]).  He was created by the [[Soviet]] counterpart of the [[Weapon X]] project.

==Character history==

Little is known about the past of Arkady Russovich except that he was a [[serial killer]]. He was captured by the [[Interpol]] agent [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]] and turned over to the [[KGB]], which wanted to created a super soldier similar to [[Captain America]]. Omega Red is the end result.

Omega Red possesses a variety of [[superhuman]] attributes as a part of both [[genetic mutation]] and artificial enhancements granted to him by the Soviet government. Omega Red possesses superhuman strength, endurance, and a high degree of resistance to physical injury and [[radioactivity]]. He has a superhuman regenerative [[healing factor]] similar to that of [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] and [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]]. 

He also possesses the ability to secrete an odorless [[pheromone]] that weakens anybody within his immediate vicinity.  The pheromone has never been given an official name, but has often times been called his &#8220;Death Factor&#8221; and also the &#8220;Death Spore Pheromone&#8221; in opposition to Wolverine and Sabretooth's &#8220;Healing factor&#8221;. The pheromone is sufficient enough to render his targets unconscious, or even kill them, if exposed to the pheromone for a long enough period. He must secrete this pheromone, or it will start to feed off of his own body.

The Soviet government implanted one retractable [[carbonadium]] [[tentacle]] within each of Omega Red's arms. Carbonadium was the Soviets' attempt to recreate the artificial alloy known as [[adamantium]]. It is a more malleable form of adamantium. He uses them as weapons and as grappling appendages. He is able to a wrap a victim in his coils to literally drain them of their life energy. This [[vampire|vampiric]] tendency was once essential to Omega Red's survival; the carbonadium implants, while great offensive weapons, slowly poisoned him and he was required to regularly drain the life energy of a person, or perhaps taking small amounts from larger numbers of individuals, in order to temporarily sustain his [[immune system]]. 

In order to stabilize his condition, Omega Red requires the "carbonadium synthesizer," a device that was stolen by Wolverine, [[Maverick (comics)|Maverick]], and Sabretooth during their final mission together as "Team X" sometime during the [[1960s]]. It is because of his need for the carbonadium synthesizer that Omega Red has continuously sought out these three individuals over the years, believing they may know of its whereabouts.

At some time in the past the Soviet government decided that Omega Red was too unpredictable and treacherous to be relied upon, and so needed to be put in [[cryonics|cryogenic]] [[suspended animation]] until a method could be found to control him. After the fall of [[Communism]] in [[Russia]] he was released by the clan of [[ninja]] known as [[Hand (comics)|the Hand]]. He was led to believe that Wolverine knew the whereabouts of the carbonadium synthesizer which could save his life, and sought him out in an effort to find this device. In doing so, he came into conflict with the [[X-Men]] many times. Later, Omega Red battled and fell under the mental control of the [[Soul Skinner]] in Siberia. The Soul Skinner then used him to battle Wolverine and the X-Men. Omega Red captured Wolverine and Jubilee, but escaped after the Soul Skinner's death. He has also fought against [[Chamber (comics)|Chamber]] of [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]], but suffered a humiliating defeat. Ultimately, Omega Red failed to eliminate Wolverine and proved to be no more loyal to the Hand than he was to the Soviet government.

He has worked for [[Post-Communism|Neocommunist]] organizations and tried to kill a member of the Americomp organization, but was stopped by [[Daredevil]] and [[Black Widow (comics)|Black Widow]].

Omega Red was later employed by Russian gangster Ivan Pushkin to incite a war between the subversive [[terrorist]] organization [[HYDRA]] and the technology suppliers [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A. I. M.]]. 

Most recently, whilst working for the drug lord known as the General, Omega Red was recruited by Sabretooth to attack Wolverine's friends and family alongside [[Lady Deathstrike]]. Sabretooth had promised both Omega Red and Deathstrike information on almost every mutant on Earth, but betrayed his new henchmen by [[teleportation|teleporting]] away with Wolverine, his ward Amiko, and the information.

Eventually Omega Red found a means of eliminating his need to drain living beings of their life forces to survive. He is currently a crime lord (head of the Red Mafia) who poses as a legitimate business man, much like [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]] does in the U.S. At present he seems to have lost interest in Wolverine and is more focused on activities that indulge his greed and lust for power.

==Powers and abilities==

Omega Red is a mutant with superhuman strength and the ability to emit lethal pheromones from his body (death spores). These spores result in the weakness or death of humans in his near vicinity. The severity of the effect is based on the endurance, health, and relative proximity of the victims. Normal humans would be killed in a matter of seconds of exposure, while beings with heightened endurance can withstand it for minutes or hours.

He has tendrils made of carbonadium, an alloy only slightly less durable than adamantium. His [[skeleton]] is also laced with carbonadium, rendering it nearly indestructible. Even damaging carbonadium with adamantium would require ''enormous'' pressure. He also wears a suit of red retro-Russian carbonadium armor. This armor is sufficient to enable him to withstand being assaulted by Wolverine's Adamantium claws without injury.

Omega Red's body possesses a high degree of resistance to physical injury.  The tissues of his body are hardened to the extent that his body is invulnerable to damage from conventional materials. However, it is possible to injure Omega Red but his body is able to heal with much greater efficiency than an ordinary human.  Injuries that result in massive tissue damage and blood loss, will fully mend with little time. Omega Red is able to withstand extreme temperature and pressures, practically all [[toxins]], [[corrosive|corrosives]], punctures, and [[concussion]]s while sustaining little, if any, injury.    His carbonadium armor and natural durability make him very difficult to kill, but he is not [[immortal]]; he could not survive the detonation of a multi-megaton, ground-zero [[nuclear warfare|nuclear]] blast, for example, and could be stopped if he was [[cryogenically frozen]]. His mind is also vulnerable to [[telepathy|telepathic]] attacks.

Omega Red has the ability to drain the life force of other humans to sustain his own. At one time the carbonadium in his body had the effect of slowly poisoning him which caused him to need to drain life forces frequently. This is no longer necessary but he still retains the ability to drain life forces. The more life force he drains, the stronger he gets and the faster he heals.

Omega Red is also an excellent hand-to-hand combatant and military tactician, having defeated foes such as [[Iron Man]] and [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]. He was trained in various forms of armed and unarmed combat by both the Soviet government and various organizations throughout the [[Japan]]ese [[Organized crime|underworld]]. Highly intelligent, he has quickly become highly skilled in the management of [[criminal organizations]].

==Other versions of Omega Red==

===Age of Apocalypse===

In the [[Age of Apocalypse]] timeline, there is a different version of Omega Red known only as Rossovich.  He has practically the same abilities as Omega Red of [[Earth 616]], with the carbonadium tentacles and "Death Factor". However, he was much more vulnerable because he did not have the red carbonadium armor and wore a blue uniform instead. Instead of a [[homicidal]] maniac, Rossovich appeared more [[sanity|sane]] and business-like. He had ties to the mutant underground and the black market. There he was able to secure access to food, weapons and valuable information. [[Domino (comics)|Domino]] went to Rossovich in search for [[X-Man]] but Rossovich fought back. In the fight with Domino and Grizzly, Rossovich was killed by Domino, who ran him through with her sword. His presence in the Age of Apocalypse timeline was very brief compared to that of his regular Marvel counterpart.

===Ultimate Omega Red===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel Universe]], Omega Red makes a cameo as an enemy of [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Spider-Man]].

==Inspirations==

A bit-part character in Japanese [[Rurouni Kenshin]] [[manga]]/[[anime series]], called [[Arundo Akamatsu]], is said by the author [[Nobuhiro Watsuki]] to be inspired by Omega Red, both in the fact his surname means "red end" ("omega" is a possible [[synonym]] for "end") and because he uses retractable chains as weapons, just like Omega Red's carbonadium tentacles.
