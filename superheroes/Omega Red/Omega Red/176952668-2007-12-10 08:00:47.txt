'''Omega Red''' ('''Arkady Rossovich''') is a [[comic book]] [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]] and a foe of the [[X-Men]].  His first appearance was ''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #4 ([[1992]]).

A [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], Rossovich possesses the ability to siphon the life-force of others. The [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] counterpart to the [[Weapon X]] program of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] turned him into a [[supersoldier]], bonding a super strong metal [[alloy]] called "[[adamantium (comics)#carbonadium|carbonadium]]" to his body and implanting metal [[tentacle]]s, which focus his life-draining abilities, into each of his arms.

Omega Red possesses a variety of [[superhuman]] attributes as a part of both [[mutation|genetic mutation]] and artificial enhancements granted to him by the Soviet government. Omega Red possesses superhuman strength, endurance, and a high degree of resistance to physical injury and [[radioactive decay|radioactivity]]. He has a superhuman regenerative [[healing factor]] similar to that of [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] and [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]]. 

He also possesses the ability to secrete an odorless [[pheromone]] that weakens anybody within his immediate vicinity.  The pheromone has never been given an official name, but has often been called his “Death Factor” and also the “Death Spore Pheromone” in opposition to Wolverine and Sabretooth's “Healing factor”. The pheromone is sufficient enough to render his targets unconscious, or even kill them, if exposed to the pheromone for a long enough period. He must secrete this pheromone, or it will start to feed off of his own body. 

Omega Red battled Weapon X subject Wolverine sometime during the [[Cold War]], the start of a decades-long feud between the two. The Soviets eventually realized that Red was an uncontrollable [[psychopathy|psychopath]] and placed him in [[suspended animation]]. He has since been freed and become a world-renowned criminal and [[mercenary]].

Omega Red is a popular X-Men villain, appearing in [[X-Men (TV series)|the 1990s-era ''X-Men'' animated series]]; its successor, ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]''; and several X-Men [[video game]]s. 

==Fictional character biography==
===Past life===
Little is known about the past of Arkady Rossovich except that he was a [[serial killer]]. He was captured by the [[Interpol]] agent [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]] and turned over to the [[KGB]], which wanted to create a super soldier similar to [[Captain America]]. Omega Red is the end result.

In another version of Omega Red's past, as told in a [[David North (comics)|Maverick]] one-shot, Arkady was a Soviet soldier stationed in a small Siberian town. He was also a child rapist and murderer, crimes easily discoverable due to the town's small size and limited number of potential victims. He was caught by his fellow soldiers and executed without trial via a gunshot to the back of the head. His superiors are astonished when Arkady survives the execution, and recommend him for the aforementioned Soviet super soldier project, a brutal process which it is suggested that Arkady survives solely due to the evil and meanness of his nature.

The Soviet government implanted one retractable [[adamantium (comics)#carbonadium|carbonadium]] [[tentacle]] within each of Omega Red's arms.  Carbonadium was the Soviets' attempt to recreate the artificial alloy known as [[adamantium (comics)|adamantium]]. It is a more malleable form of adamantium. He uses them as weapons and as grappling appendages. He is able to a wrap a victim in his coils to literally drain them of their "life" energy. This [[vampire|vampiric]] tendency is essential to Omega Red's survival; the carbonadium implants, while great offensive weapons, slowly poisoned him and he was required to regularly drain the life energy of a person, or perhaps take small amounts from larger numbers of individuals, in order to temporarily sustain his [[immune system]]. 

In order to stabilize his condition, Omega Red requires the "Carbonadium Synthesizer," a device that was stolen by Wolverine, [[David North (comics)|Maverick]], and Sabretooth during their final mission together as "Team X" sometime during the [[1960s]]. It is because of his need for the Carbonadium Synthesizer that Omega Red has continuously sought out these three individuals over the years, believing they may know of its whereabouts.

===Present times===

At some time in the past the Soviet government decided that Omega Red was too unpredictable and treacherous to be relied upon, and so needed to be put in [[cryonics|cryogenic]] [[suspended animation]] until a method could be found to control him. After the fall of [[Communism]] in [[Russia]] he was released by the clan of [[ninja]] known as [[Hand (comics)|The Hand]]. He was led to believe that Wolverine knew the whereabouts of the Carbonadium Synthesizer which could save his life, and sought him out in an effort to find this device. In doing so, he came into conflict with the [[X-Men]] many times. Later, Omega Red battled and fell under the mental control of the [[Soul Skinner]] in Siberia. The Soul Skinner then used him to battle Wolverine and the X-Men. Omega Red was able to subdue the team, and was then sent to capture Colossus, who had retreated. Omega Red eluded capture by Wolverine after the Soul Skinner's death. He later fought against [[Chamber (comics)|Chamber]] of [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]], but suffered a humiliating defeat. Ultimately, Omega Red failed to eliminate Wolverine and proved to be no more loyal to the Hand than he was to the Soviet government.

He has worked for [[Post-Communism|Neocommunist]] organizations and tried to kill a member of the Americomp organization, but was stopped by [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] and [[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]].

Omega Red was later employed by Russian gangster Ivan Pushkin to incite a war between the subversive [[terrorism|terrorist]] organization [[HYDRA]] and the technology suppliers [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A. I. M.]]. 

Most recently, whilst working for the drug lord known as the General, Omega Red was recruited by Sabretooth to attack Wolverine's friends and family alongside [[Lady Deathstrike]]. Sabretooth had promised both Omega Red and Deathstrike information on almost every mutant on Earth, but betrayed his new henchmen by [[teleportation|teleporting]] away with Wolverine, his ward Amiko, and the information.

Omega Red is currently a crime lord (head of the Red Mafia) who poses as a legitimate business man, much like [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]] does in the U.S. At present, Omega Red has resumed his search for the Carbonadium Synthesizer. In ''Wolverine: Origins'' #6 and #7, Omega Red locates former Team X member, and now one of the numerous depowered mutants, [[David North (comics)#Agent Zero|Agent Zero]], who is the only person that knows the location of the Carbonadium Synthesizer. This brings him into direct confrontation with Wolverine, who has also sought out Maverick in hopes of locating the Carbonadium Synthesizer.

==Powers and abilities==
Omega Red is a mutant with superhuman strength and the ability to emit lethal pheromones from his body typically referred to as Death Spores. The death spores result in the weakness or death of humans in his near vicinity. The severity of the effect is based on the endurance, health, and relative proximity of the victims. The spores are fatal to ordinary humans within seconds, though some superhumanly powered beings can withstand exposure to them for extended periods of time.

Omega Red possesses retractable tendrils housed within his arms made of carbonadium, an artificial alloy that is the former Soviet Union's attempt at creating [[Adamantium (comics)|True Adamantium]]. Carbonadium is more malleable than adamantium and, while being vastly stronger than steel, is not as durable as adamantium. Carbonadium, however, is for all practical purposes virtually indestructible.  Omega Red is able to use the tentacles as highly effective offensive weapons, often brandishing them like whips during combat. The natural durability of the tentacles, combined with his physical strength, are sufficient to cause damage to most conventional materials. 

Omega Red also has superhuman levels of stamina sufficient to engage [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] in combat continuously for over eighteen hours with no signs of fatigue. His bodily tissues are harder and more resistant to certain types of injury than those of an ordinary human. While he isn't invulnerable, his body can withstand great impact and blunt trauma forces that would result in severe injury or death in an ordinary human. However, his resistance to injury is considerably enhanced due to the red armor that he wears. While it is unknown what the armor is composed of, it is sufficient to allow him to withstand powerful energy blasts from the likes of [[Chamber (comics)|Chamber]] without sustaining injury.

Omega Red has the ability, and need, to drain the life force of other humans to sustain his own. Omega Red can do this by ensnaring his victims within his tentacles. Due to the presence of the carbonadium within his body, Omega Red must drain the life force of others on a regular basis in order to sustain his own physical health. Omega Red can use these absorbed energies to, temporarily, increase his body's healing capabilities to the point where he can fully heal from a punctured lung within a few minutes. Only a device known as the Carbonadium Synthesizer can stabilize his condition.  

Omega Red is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant and military tactician.  He was trained in various forms of armed and unarmed combat by both the Soviet government and various organizations throughout the [[Japan]]ese and [[Russia]]n criminal [[Organized crime|underworlds]]. Highly intelligent, he has quickly become highly skilled in the management of [[organized crime|criminal organizations]].

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Omega Red===
[[Image:Ultimateomegared.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Ultimate Omega Red.]]
In the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Marvel Universe]], Omega Red makes a cameo as an enemy of [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Spider-Man]], notably in #86 of the series. It is unclear what exactly his powers are, but his wrist tentacles appear to be fully organic rather than made of carbonadium, and sprout from the backs of his hands, rather than from below his palms. It is also unclear if this version of Omega Red possesses the ability to secrete death spores, although [[Wrecker (comics)|Wrecker]] claimed afterwards that he might have sprayed the area with 'toxins'. Spider-Man refers to him as "President of the [[Doctor Octopus|Dr. Octopus]] Fan Club" because of his tentacles.
He was seen recently in a cameo appearance in Ultimate Spiderman #113 as one of the prisoners who escaped the Triskellion.

===Age of Apocalypse===
In the [[Age of Apocalypse]] timeline, there is a different version of Omega Red known only as Rossovich. He has practically the same abilities as Omega Red of [[Earth-616]], with the carbonadium tentacles and "Death Factor". However, he was much more vulnerable because he did not have the red armor and wore a blue uniform instead. Instead of a [[homicide|homicidal]] maniac, Rossovich appeared more [[sanity|sane]] and business-like. He had ties to the mutant underground and the black market. There he was able to secure access to food, weapons, and valuable information. [[Domino (comics)#Other Versions|Domino]] went to Rossovich in search for [[Nate Grey#Age of Apocalypse|X-Man]] but Rossovich fought back. In the fight with Domino and Grizzly, Rossovich was killed by Domino, who ran him through with her sword. His presence in the Age of Apocalypse timeline was very brief compared to that of his regular Marvel counterpart.
