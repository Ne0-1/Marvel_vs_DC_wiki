'''Omega Red''' (real name Arkady Rossovich ) is a [[comic book]] super villian in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe and a foe of the [[X-Men]].  His first appearance was ''X-Men #4'' (vol. 2), published in [[1992]].

==Powers==

Omega Red is a deadly [[mutant]] who is not only superhumanly strong, but emits noxious [[pheromone]]s that can kill people in his immediate vicinity.  He also appears to have a superhuman regenerative healing factor similar to that of [[Wolverine]] and [[Sabretooth]], but in Arkady's case this healing factor is not functioning properly for reasons outlined below.

By artificial means Omega Red had retractable carbonadium tendrils attached to his body which are similar to the tentacles of an [[octopus]]. The carbonadium (a fictional metal) was an attempt by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[government]] to copy the [[metal]] [[alloy]] [[adamantium]].  Unfortunately, Arkady's body is trying to reject the metal and this is overtaxing his superhuman [[immune system]] and threatening to kill him. 

At some time in the past Omega Red's government decided that do to his uncontrollable and [[antisocial personality disorder|psychopathic]] nature he needed to be put in [[cryonics|cryogenic freeze]] until a method could be found to control him. After the fall of [[communism]] in [[Russia]] he was released by the clan of [[ninja]]s known as [[the Hand]]. Omega Red was lead to believe that [[Wolverine]] knew the whereabouts of the carbonadium synthesizer which could save Omega Red's life.  Arkady sought him out in an effort to find this device and has come into conflict with the [[X-Men]] and [[Wolverine]] many times for this reason.
