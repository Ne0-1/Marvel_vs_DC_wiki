'''Omega Red''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appeared in ''[[X-Men]]'' #4 (vol. 2, January 1992), and was created by [[Jim Lee]] and [[Scott Lobdell]].

==Fictional character biography==
Little is known about the past of '''Arkady Rossovich''' except that he was a [[serial killer]] born in Russia. He was captured by the [[Interpol]] agent [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]] and turned over to the [[KGB]], which wanted to create a super soldier similar to [[Captain America]]. Omega Red is the end result.

In another version of Omega Red's past, as told in a [[David North (comics)|Maverick]] one-shot, Arkady was a Soviet soldier stationed in a small Siberian town. He was also a child rapist and murderer, crimes easily discoverable due to the town's small size and limited number of potential victims. He was caught by his fellow soldiers and executed without trial via a gunshot to the back of the head. His superiors are astonished when Arkady survives the execution, and recommend him for the aforementioned Soviet super soldier project, a brutal process which it is suggested that Arkady survives solely due to the evil and meanness of his nature. He becomes an operative for Soviet intelligence and a KGB operative.

The Soviet government implanted one retractable [[adamantium (comics)#carbonadium|carbonadium]] [[tentacle]] within each of Omega Red's arms.  Carbonadium was the Soviets' attempt to recreate the artificial alloy known as [[adamantium (comics)|adamantium]]. It is a more malleable form of adamantium. He uses them as weapons and as grappling appendages. He is able to a wrap a victim in his coils to literally drain them of their "life" energy. This [[vampire|vampiric]] tendency is essential to Omega Red's survival; the carbonadium implants, while great offensive weapons, slowly poisoned him and he was required to regularly drain the life energy of a person, or perhaps take small amounts from larger numbers of individuals, in order to temporarily sustain his [[immune system]]. In order to stabilize his condition, Omega Red requires the "Carbonadium Synthesizer," a device that was stolen by Wolverine, [[David North (comics)|Maverick]], and Sabretooth during their final mission together as "Team X" and attempted rescue of double agent Janice Hollenbeck sometime during the 1960s.<ref>as revealed in ''X-Men'' Vol. 2 #6</ref> It is because of his need for the Carbonadium Synthesizer that Omega Red has continuously sought out these three individuals over the years, believing they may know of its whereabouts. While Sabretooth and Maverick ''might'' have been aware of its location, it was eventually revealed that Wolverine actually ''does'' know where it is.<ref>''[[Wolverine: Origins]]'' #31</ref>

Omega Red also battled [[Kestrel (Marvel Comics)|John Wraith]] in Berlin at that time.<ref>''Wolverine'' #61</ref>

At some time in the past the Soviet government decided that Omega Red was too unpredictable and treacherous to be relied upon, and so needed to be put in [[cryonics|cryogenic]] [[suspended animation]] until a method could be found to control him. After the fall of [[Communism]] in [[Russia]] he was revived from suspended animation by [[Matsu'o Tsurayaba]], who led his own renegade faction of the clan of [[ninja]] known as [[Hand (comics)|The Hand]]. Omega Red became a warrior serving Matsu'o Tsurayaba and was led to believe that Wolverine knew the whereabouts of the Carbonadium Synthesizer which could save his life, and sought him out in an effort to find this device. In doing so, he came into conflict with the [[X-Men]] many times. In their first encounter in modern times, Omega Red captured Wolverine.<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 2 #4</ref> He fought and defeated Wolverine, and brought him to Tsuryaba, [[Fenris (comics)|Fenris]], and [[Abraham Cornelius|Cornelius]] in Berlin.<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 2 #5</ref> He battled the X-Men,<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 2 #6</ref> and was wounded by [[Psylocke]] and defeated by the X-Men and Maverick and escaped.<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 2 #7</ref> Later, Omega Red battled and fell under the mental control of the [[Soul Skinner]] in Siberia. The Soul Skinner then used him to battle Wolverine and the X-Men. Omega Red was able to subdue the team, captured Wolverine and [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] and was then sent to capture Colossus, who had retreated. Omega Red eluded capture by Wolverine after the Soul Skinner's death.<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 2 #18-19</ref> He later fought against [[Chamber (comics)|Chamber]] of [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]], but suffered a humiliating defeat. Ultimately, Omega Red failed to eliminate Wolverine and proved to be no more loyal to the Hand than he was to the Soviet government.

He has worked for [[Post-Communism|Neocommunist]] organizations and tried to kill a member of the Americomp organization, but was stopped by [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] and [[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]].

Omega Red was later employed by Russian gangster Ivan Pushkin to incite a war between the subversive [[terrorism|terrorist]] organization [[HYDRA]] and the technology suppliers [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A. I. M.]]. 

While working for the drug lord known as the General, Omega Red was recruited by Sabretooth to attack Wolverine's friends and family alongside [[Lady Deathstrike]]. Sabretooth had promised both Omega Red and Deathstrike information on almost every mutant on Earth, but betrayed his new henchmen by [[teleportation|teleporting]] away with Wolverine, his ward Amiko, and the information.

Omega Red is currently a crime lord (head of the Red Mafia) who poses as a legitimate business man, much like [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]] does in the U.S. At present, Omega Red has resumed his search for the Carbonadium Synthesizer. In ''Wolverine: Origins'' #6 and #7, Omega Red locates former Team X member, and now one of the numerous depowered mutants, [[David North (comics)#Agent Zero|Agent Zero]], who is the only person that knows the location of the Carbonadium Synthesizer. This brings him into direct confrontation with Wolverine, who has also sought out Maverick in hopes of locating the Carbonadium Synthesizer.  The result of this encounter is that Wolverine outsmarts Omega Red, landing him in the custody of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]].

Months later it becomes known that the [[Russians|Russian]] [[Red Room (comics)|Red Room]] bought Omega Red's freedom with the hopes of using him to their own ends. [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], Colossus, and Nightcrawler encounter him after he has freed himself from his master however, and they engage in combat. Omega Red is largely impervious to Wolverine's claws; the Red Room had been experimenting on his body in an effort to enhance his healing factor. After [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] intervenes and knocks Omega Red unconscious, he is returned to S.H.I.E.L.D. custody.

==Powers and abilities==
Omega Red is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with superhuman strength, speed, stamina, durability, agility, and reflexes, and the ability to secrete pheromones from his body typically referred to as Death Spores. The death spores result in the weakness or death of humans in his immediate vicinity. The severity of the effect is based on the endurance, health, and relative proximity of the victims. The spores are fatal to ordinary humans within seconds, though some superhumanly powered beings can withstand exposure to them for extended periods of time.
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:carcoil.jpg|thumb|right|Omega Red's [[adamantium (comics)#carbonadium|carbonadium]] coils.|250px]]  -->

Implanted within Omega Red's arms are long retractable tendril-like coils made of carbonadium, an artificial alloy that is the former Soviet Union's attempt at creating [[Adamantium (comics)|True Adamantium]]. Carbonadium is more malleable than adamantium and, while being vastly stronger than steel, is considerably less durable than adamantium. Carbonadium, however, is for all practical purposes virtually indestructible. Omega Red can cause the coils to shoot forward from openings in the undersides of his wrists in order to ensnare his victims. Omega Red is able to use the tentacles as highly effective offensive weapons, often brandishing them like whips during combat. The natural durability of the tentacles, combined with his physical strength, are sufficient to cause damage to most conventional materials. 

Omega Red also has superhuman levels of stamina sufficient to engage [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] in combat continuously for over eighteen hours with no signs of fatigue. His bodily tissues are harder and more resistant to certain types of injury than those of an ordinary human. While he isn't invulnerable, his body can withstand great impact and blunt trauma forces that would result in severe injury or death in an ordinary human. However, his resistance to injury is considerably enhanced due to the red armor that he wears. While it is unknown what the armor is composed of, it is sufficient to allow him to withstand powerful energy blasts from the likes of [[Chamber (comics)|Chamber]] without sustaining injury.

Omega Red has the ability, and need, to drain the life force of victims with his pheromones in order to sustain his own. Omega Red can likewise ensnare his victims within his tentacles, and use the coils as a conduit for his lethal pheromones. Due to the mutant "death factor" and the presence of the carbonadium within his body, Omega Red must drain the life force of others on a regular basis in order to sustain his own physical health and remain active. Omega Red can use these absorbed energies to, temporarily, increase his body's healing capabilities to the point where he can fully heal from a punctured lung within a few minutes. Only a device known as the Carbonadium Synthesizer can stabilize his condition, as carbonadium is the only metal that can neutralize the "death factor," thereby stabilizing it within his body.  

Omega Red is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant and military tactician.  He was trained in various forms of armed and unarmed combat by both the Soviet government and various organizations throughout the [[Yakuza|Japanese]] and [[Russian Mafia|Russian]] criminal [[Organized crime|underworlds]]. Highly intelligent, he has quickly become highly skilled in the management of [[organized crime|criminal organizations]].

==Other versions==
In the [[Age of Apocalypse]] timeline, there is a different version of Omega Red known only as Rossovich. Instead of a [[homicide|homicidal]] maniac, Rossovich appeared more [[sanity|sane]] and business-like. He had ties to the mutant underground and the black market. 

In the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Marvel Universe]], Omega Red is an enemy of [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Spider-Man]]. His tentacles extend from the tops of his wrists instead of the bottom. He has demonstrated superhuman strength; it is not clear if his other powers are the same as his mainstream counterpart.
