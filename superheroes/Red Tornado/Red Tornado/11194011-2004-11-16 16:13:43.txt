'''Red Tornado''' is the name of two [[fictional character]]s in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]].  

==Red Tornado I==
The first was a humourous character, "Ma" Hunkel, a housewife and mother who wore longjohns and a pot on her head. This was one of the first [[superhero]] [[parodies]]. She is currently the custodian of the [[Justice Society]] Museum.

==Red Tornado II==
The [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] Red Tornado was an android created by the [[supervillain]], [[T.O. Morrow]] for the purpose of infiltrating the [[Justice Society]]. After the android was complete, it was merged with two other entities: ''Ulthoon, the Tornado Tyrant of Rann'', and the being ''Tornado Champion''. This created a living being with the ability to control wind, especially in a cyclone form.  Using the name John Smith, he joined the Justice Society, and eventually the [[Justice League]].  

During the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]], Red Tornado became separated from his body, becoming an air [[elemental]]. Air pollution upset him, sending him half crazy and in conflict with [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] in ''The Elemental War''. Eventually, [[Captain Atom]] and Firestorm calmed him, and Firestorm manufactured a new body shell for Red Tornado.

Since this time, he has been a member of the [[Leymen]], and also [[Young Justice]].

His first appearance was in Justice League of America #64 (Aug [[1968]]).
