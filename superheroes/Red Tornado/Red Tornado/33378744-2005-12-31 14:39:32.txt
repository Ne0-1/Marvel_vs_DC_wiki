'''Red Tornado''' is fictional [[superhero]] in the [[DC Comics|DC]] [[DC Universe|Universe]].

==Character History==
===Silver Age===
His first appearance was in ''Justice League of America'' #64 (Aug 1968), written by [[Gardner Fox]].

The [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] Red Tornado was an android created by the [[supervillain]] [[T. O. Morrow]] for the purpose of infiltrating the Justice Society. (Part of the plan involved giving the android a false memory indicating that it was the Red Tornado who had attended the first JSA meeting.) After the android was complete, it was merged with two other entities: ''Ulthoon, the Tornado Tyrant of Rann'', and the being ''Tornado Champion''. 

These two tornado entities originated from the planet Rann in the Earth-1 universe. This being, originally one entity, confronted Rann's adopted champion, Adam Strange, and was defeated. Following that defeat, the being contemplated the nature of good and evil and decided that good was the superior force. The good side called itself the Tornado Champion; the evil side, the Tornado Tyrant. Confronting the Tyrant, the Tornado Champion was easily defeated. Disheartened, the Tornado Champion lured to the Tyrant to Earth-1, where the Tyrant was defeated by the real JLA. The Tornado Champion decided that there was little satisfaction in being an imitation, and journeyed to Earth-2 in an attempt to find new identity. The Tornado Champion came upon the criminal T. O. Morrow, who was creating an android with which to infiltrate and defeat the Justice Society of America. The Tornado Champion decided to assume control of the robotic form. The merging had an unexpected side effect, however: the Tornado Champion's memory was erased. Red Tornado then seemed to be a new life-form.

Believing itself to be the original JSA associate, Red Tornado visited JSA headquarters and announced its return to active duty. The JSA, not recognizing the android, was incredulous but allowed the Tornado to accompany them to defeat a theft at a nearby museum. Through a series of mishaps choreographed by Morrow, Red Tornado seemingly killed the JSA members. Red Tornado then tracked Morrow to his lair and seemingly defeated him. When the remaining JSAers arrived to investigate, a booby-trapped weapon felled them all. Morrow then traveled to Earth-1, where he defeated the JLA as he had the JSA before them. Red Tornado, recovered from his previous injuries, followed Morrow and revived the JLA. The JLA and the android then defeated Morrow, uncovering a method to revive the JSA back on Earth-2. Morrow confessed that Red Tornado was his android construct, but the JSA still admitted him as a member in good standing.

When the mad Star-God Aquarius attacked Earth-2, many JSA members were captured and sealed in a magical bubble as Aquarius phased Earth-2 out of existence. Red Tornado escaped, reaching Earth-1 and contacting the JLA. The JLA disregarded the android to tend to their own affairs, ultimately hearing him out two weeks later. When they realized the JSA's dilemma, the JLA members quickly journeyed to the Earth-2 universe, defeating Aquarius and returning Earth-2 to normal. 

Red Tornado often felt he was an outsider in the JSA, and that he was not appreciated as a sentient, independent organism. When he stumbled across the Creators monitoring Earth-2, he sought to impress his colleagues by defeating the aliens single-handedly. Instead, Red Tornado was captured and used as a conduit to bring Earth-1 and Earth-2 together. The JSA defeated the Creators and rescued Red Tornado; however, his easy defeat and manipulation left Red Tornado more dejected than ever.

During the 100th meeting of the [[Justice League]] of America, the JLA was summoned to Earth-2 to assist the JSA in defeating the Iron Hand, a sworn foe of the Seven Soldiers of Victory. The Iron Hand had created an orbiting weapon, shaped like a hand, that threatened Earth-2. Doctor Fate summoned a being known as the Oracle, who informed them of the Iron Hand's last defeat, which cost the life of one of the Seven Soldiers of Victory. The JLA and JSA split into teams and rescued the members of the SSV, who had been scattered throughout time, and with their help created a weapon that would destroy the Iron Hand's device. The delivery of the device to its necessary location was a suicide mission, one which Red Tornado secretly took while the other heroes were engaged in dealing with the Iron Hand and debating over who would go. In the resulting explosion, Red Tornado was believed to be destroyed. Red Tornado survived, however, and was catapulted to the Earth-1 universe, where he ultimately he became a member of the Justice League of America. In the JLA, Red Tornado finally found a measure of acceptance. He formed friendships with his teammates, particularly new recruit Firestorm.

While a member of the Justice League, the Red Tornado developed a human alterego appearence, that of John Smith, and formed an attachment with a woman named Kathy Sutton.  In addition, he adopted an Asian orphan named Tayla, and they formed a makeshift family.  However, the Tornado's adventures with the League caused him to repeatedly be destroyed, such as with his encounter with the Construct, and later reassembled once more.  This caused additional strains on his attempted family life.

Eventually, T.O. Morrow returned as two individual personas, the Future Man (with a hyper-advanced brain providing him with psionic abilities) and a replica of the original T.O. Morrow body, this one equipped with an advanced battle suit.  It is unknown how there were two T.O. Morrows except perhaps the original Morrow from Earth 2 and the one later found on Earth 1 (when Red Tornado reappeared) may have merged when they both ceased to exist following their confrontations with their two superhero team enemies.  In any event, a conflict with the latter Morrow caused the Tornado's android shell to rupture, and at this point the above origin of the Tornado Champion/Tyrant's merging with the android body was revealed.  Red Tornado soon regained his body and gained renewed confidence in now knowing he was truly a sentient being.  This would not last for long, as tragedy would soon strike once more.

===Crisis on Infinite Earths===
During the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]], Red Tornado became separated from his body, becoming an air [[elemental]] due to the [[Anti-Monitor]] utilizing him as a weapon against the combined might of both the Justice League and Society. After the Crisis, he remained an air elemental.

===Adventures===
Air pollution upset him, sending him half crazy and in conflict with [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] in ''The Elemental War''. Eventually, [[Captain Atom]] and Firestorm calmed him, and Firestorm manufactured a new body shell for Red Tornado.

Since this time, he has been a member of the [[Leymen]], and also served as an advisor for  [[Young Justice]].  He has attempted to renew his relationship with his former girlfriend and adopted daughter, although this has been a belabored process.

===Infinite Crisis===
Red Tornado has been recruited by [[Donna Troy]] to fight against an unknown source in space as a part of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]''.

==Powers and abilities==
Red Tornado's true form was a powerful entity composed purely of violent wind forces. His android form channeled these forces through his arms and legs to produce bursts of cyclone-force winds and high speed forward velocity. On occasion, Red Tornado used his high-velocity movement to render himself invisible to unaided human vision.  His android body facilitated superhuman strength and resilience, the level of which has not been determined at this time.
