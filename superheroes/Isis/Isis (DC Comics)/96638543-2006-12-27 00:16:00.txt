'''Isis''' is the name for a [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]] as well as a separate goddess also living in the [[DC Universe]]. The superhero was originally the main character of ''[[The Secret of Isis]]'', a live-action [[United States|American]] Saturday Morning television program that served as the second half of ''[[Shazam! (TV series)|The Shazam!/Isis Hour]]''. The character appeared in a several late 1970s DC Comics publications, and was reimagined and introduced into the [[DC Universe]] in 2006 as a counterpart for the ''Shazam!''-derived character [[Black Adam]]. The goddess is depicted within the ''[[Wonder Woman]]'' comic book.

==Character history==

Like the main character of the first half of the program, [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], Isis also had roots in [[ancient Egyptian]] [[mythology]]. ''The Secrets of Isis'' starred [[Joanna Cameron]] as Andrea Thomas,  a high school science teacher who gains the ability to call upon the powers of the [[goddess]] [[Isis]] after finding an Egyptian amulet. Fifteen episodes of ''The Secrets of Isis'' were produced for ''The Shazam! Isis Hour'', and the character also appeared in three episodes of the ''Shazam!'' portion of the show. ''The Secrets of Isis'' was given its own timeslot in 1977, for which seven new episodes were broadcast alongside reruns from the first two seasons. 

Isis later appeared in animated form on Filmation's ''[[Tarzan and the Super 7]]'' show in [[1980]], as part of a segment called ''[[The Freedom Force]]''. Fans of the series, with support from Joanna Cameron, have been lobbying for the release of the series to [[DVD]] for the last several years. BCI Ecplipse has DVD releases out and coming.

Isis' first appearance in comics was in ''[[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Shazam!]]'' #25 (Sept-Oct. 1976). She was later given her own TV tie-in book the following month, the title ran for two years. The eight issue run by DC Comics began in October ([[1976]]) and ended January ([[1979]]). All stories starred the Andrea Thomas character from the television series; the book was edited by [[Denny O'Neil]], written by Jack C. Harris and illustrated by Mike Vosburg.

===As a goddess within the DC Universe===
In January 2002, [[DC Comics]] re-introduced the goddess Isis as one of the chief gods worshipped by the [[Bana-Mighdall|Bana-Mighdallian]] [[Amazons]] in the [[Wonder Woman]] comic. Although the Bana tribe was introduced in 1989, their gods were not shown until 2002. Her introduction depicted her in a standard white sleeveless gown and Egyptian head-dress containing her trademark symbol. Later, the various Amazon gods were depicted as selecting more modern appearances for themselves. After this, Isis was then shown as wearing a black business suit with skirt, long straight black hair and a neck choker containing an [[ankh]]. It must be noted though that the goddess and the superhero are two separate individuals.

===Adrianna Tomaz===

The superhero Isis was re-introduced in the DC Universe in the weekly comic book ''52''. In this series, an Egyptian woman named Adrianna Tomaz (a homage to the "Andrea Thomas" character on the television program) is a refugee who is enslaved and brought to [[Black Adam]] as a gift from [[Intergang]]. Upon freeing her, Black Adam found her to be unafraid and highly vocal about how he could change his country for the better.

After weeks of discussion, during which Adrianna changed the way Adam looked at the world, Adam retrieved the magical amulet of Isis from the tomb of his wife and children, and asked [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] to confer its power on Adrianna. The ''Amulet of Isis'' had long ago belonged to another of the wizard [[Shazam (comics)|Shazam]]'s champions, Queen Pharaoh [[Hatshepsut]] of the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th Dynasty]], who had used it to bring peace to her kingdom. Upon Hatshepsut's death the amulet became dormant.

Upon holding the amulet and speaking "I am Isis", Adrianna was transformed and instilled with the powers of the goddess. She and Adam then began traveling the Middle East and freeing enslaved children, hoping to find Isis' kidnapped brother. In Week Sixteen of the series, Adam proposes to Isis and the two are wed by Captain Marvel, with several other ''Shazam!'' characters ([[Mary Marvel]], [[Captain Marvel, Jr.]], [[Tawky Tawny]] the tiger, and [[Marvel Family|Uncle Dudley]]) present as members of the wedding party. It is suggested in ''52'' that the presence of Isis is having a calming influence on Black Adam, transforming him from the ruthless dictator he was prior to her arrival into a more benevolent figure; it remains to be seen if this will be a long-term effect.

This incarnation of Isis has powers similar to Black Adam's. She also possesses healing abilities, which can heal minor and fatal wounds. She also has control over nature, which depends on her mood; rain falls when she's sad while flowers bloom when she is happy.

Adrianna finally locates Amon, who has been tortured and crippled by [[Whisper A'Daire]] for refusing to join Intergang. Isis is unable to fully heal his wounds; Black Adam then asks Amon to say his name; Amon is stuck by a lightning bolt and transformed into [[Osiris (DC Comics)#Osiris, Amon Tomaz|Osiris]]. Now reunited with her brother, Isis decides "to change the world", starting from [[China]].
On christmas the Black Marvel family dispalys to the world that they are just as human as everyone else.Isis contributed to this sudden transformation by convincing Black Adam that it will help Osiris
