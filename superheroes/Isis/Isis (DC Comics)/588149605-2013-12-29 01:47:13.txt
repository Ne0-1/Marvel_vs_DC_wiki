'''Isis''' is a [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]], as well as a separate Egyptian goddess also living in the [[DC Universe]]. The recent superhero character is modeled closely after the main character of ''[[The Secrets of Isis]]'', a live-action [[United States|American]] Saturday morning television program that served as the second half of ''[[Shazam! (TV series)|The Shazam!/Isis Hour]]''. The television character appeared in several late [[1970s in comics|1970s]] DC Comics publications. The more recent superhero character was introduced into the [[DC Universe]] in [[2006 in comics|2006]] as a counterpart for the ''Shazam!''-derived character [[Black Adam]]. The Egyptian goddess character has been depicted within the ''[[Wonder Woman]]'' comic book.

==Fictional character biography==

===Andrea Thomas and Saturday morning television series===
[[Image:isis2.jpg|thumb|left|175px|[[Joanna Cameron]] as Isis in ''[[The Secrets of Isis]]''.]]
Like the main character of the first half of the program, [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], Isis also had roots in [[ancient Egyptian]] [[mythology]]. [[The Secrets of Isis]] starred [[Joanna Cameron]] as Andrea Thomas, a high school science teacher who gains the ability to call upon the powers of the [[goddess]] [[Isis]] after finding an Egyptian amulet during an archeological dig in [[Egypt]] (this is revealed during the opening credits only; no "origin episode" was ever produced). Fifteen episodes of ''The Secrets of Isis'' were produced for ''The Shazam! Isis Hour'', and the character also appeared in three episodes of the ''Shazam!'' portion of the show. ''The Secrets of Isis'' was given its own timeslot in 1977, for which seven new episodes were broadcast alongside reruns from the first two seasons. 

Isis later appeared in animated form on [[Filmation]]'s ''[[Tarzan and the Super 7]]'' show in 1980, as part of a segment called ''[[The Freedom Force (TV series)|The Freedom Force]]''. She later guest starred on ''[[The Kid Super Power Hour with Shazam!]]'''s "[[Hero High]]" segment. Cameron did not participate in these productions, with other voice actors taking over the role.

====Powers and Abilities====

Isis demonstrated numerous powers, that manifested when the need arose. Powers demonstrated in the series included flight, super speed and strength (to a level comparable to Superman and Wonder Woman), the ability to make objects levitate, the ability to hold back elements such as rocks and water, the ability to change the molecules of inanimate objects to allow people to pass though them, the ability to act as a human [[lightning rod]], [[remote viewing]], and (at her power's maximum) the ability to stop and reverse time.  To activate these powers, Isis usually is shown reciting a rhyming chant (the most frequent being "Oh zephyr winds that blow on high, lift me now so I can fly!"). The medallion Andrea Thomas uses to change into Isis also gives her apparent limited powers even when in her non-Isis form, as she is shown communicating telepathically with her pet crow Tut and engaging in minor [[mind control]] even without changing. She also received a superior hand-to-hand and weapons combat skills from the goddess.

====Love interests====
Andrea/Isis' love interest is fellow teacher Rick Mason (although this relationship is more implied than explicitly stated - the two characters are simply shown in many episodes enjoying each other's company: going on picnics, horseback riding, and going for dinner together). As in the classic [[Lois Lane]] example, Mason remains oblivious to the physical similarities between Andrea and Isis, beyond some idle speculation in early episodes. In one episode ("The Seeing Eye Horse") a [[blindness|blind]] character realizes that Isis and Andrea have almost identical voices, but otherwise the series never explored the [[secret identity]] dilemma in any serious way. During the abbreviated second season, cosmetic changes were made to the Isis character in terms of makeup and hairstyle.

====First appearance in comics====
Isis' first appearance in comics was in ''[[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Shazam!]]'' #25 (Sept-Oct. [[1976 in comics|1976]]). She was later given her own TV tie-in book the following month, the title ran for two years. The eight issue run by DC Comics began in October (1976) and ended January (1979). All stories starred the Andrea Thomas character from the television series; the book was edited by [[Denny O'Neil]], written by [[Jack C. Harris]] and illustrated by Mike Vosburg. Like other DC characters who have been reimagined, this version of Isis, though not mentioned or appearing in ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', can be assumed to have been [[retroactive continuity|retconned]] out of existence following the 1985 DC [[mini series#Comic book|mini series]].

===As a goddess within the DC Universe===
In January [[2002 in comics|2002]], [[DC Comics]] re-introduced the goddess Isis as one of the chief gods worshipped by the [[Bana-Mighdall]]ian [[Amazons]] in the [[Wonder Woman]] comic. Although the Bana tribe was introduced in 1989, their gods were not shown until 2002. Her introduction depicted her in a standard white sleeveless gown and Egyptian head-dress containing her trademark symbol. Later, the various Amazon gods were depicted as selecting more modern appearances for themselves. After this, Isis was then shown as wearing a black business suit with skirt, long straight black hair and a neck choker containing an [[ankh]].

===Adrianna Tomaz===<!--Powers and abilities section needs including-->

====''52''====
{{main|52 (comics)}}
The superhero Isis was re-introduced in the DC Universe in the weekly comic book ''52''. In this series, an Egyptian woman named Adrianna Tomaz (an homage to the ''Andrea Thomas'' character on the television program) is a refugee who is enslaved and brought to [[Black Adam]] as a gift from [[Intergang]] along with $2,000,000 in gold. Upon freeing her and killing the emissaries who had brought her to him, Black Adam found her to be unafraid and highly vocal about how he could change his country for the better.

After weeks of discussion, during which Adrianna changed the way Adam looked at the world and inspired him to commit kinder acts, Adam retrieved the magical amulet of Isis from the tomb of his wife and children, and asked [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], now the Keeper of the [[Rock of Eternity]], to confer its power on Adrianna. The ''Amulet of Isis'' had long ago belonged to another of the wizard [[Shazam (comics)|Shazam]]'s champions, Queen Pharaoh [[Hatshepsut]] of the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th Dynasty]], who had used it to bring peace to her kingdom. Upon Hatshepsut's death the amulet became dormant.<ref name=52w12>''52'' Week 12 (July 26, 2006)</ref>

[[Image:52twelve.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Artwork for the cover of ''52'' Week Twelve, the debut of the character as Isis within the main DC Comics continuity. Art by [[J. G. Jones]].]]

Upon holding the amulet and speaking "I am Isis," Adrianna was transformed and instilled with the powers of the goddess.<ref name=52w12 /> She and Adam then began traveling the Middle East and freeing enslaved children, hoping to find Isis' kidnapped brother.<ref>''52'' Week 13 (August 2, 2006)</ref> In Week Sixteen of the series, Adam proposes to Isis using a jewel given to Cleopatra by Caesar and the two are wed by Captain Marvel, by the Gods of all the Universes and planets, despite an attempt by Intergang to ruin the wedding with a suicide bomber, with several other ''Shazam!'' characters ([[Mary Marvel]] as bridesmaid, [[Captain Marvel, Jr.]], [[Marvel Family#Marvel Family allies|Tawky Tawny]] the tiger and [[Marvel Family|Uncle Dudley]]) present as members of the wedding party. It is suggested in ''52'' that the presence of Isis is having a calming influence on Black Adam, transforming him from the ruthless dictator he was prior to her arrival into a more benevolent figure.

This incarnation of Isis has powers similar to Black Adam's. She also possesses healing abilities, which can heal minor and fatal wounds. She also has control over nature, which can be affected by her mood; rain falls when she's sad even if she is inside, while flowers bloom when she is happy. Despite her first transformation using the phrase "I am Isis," in later transformations (such as during a press conference when the Black Marvel Family depowered and resumed their superhero forms in public), the traditional "Oh Mighty Isis" was used.

Adrianna finally locates Amon, who has been tortured and crippled by [[Whisper A'Daire]] giving him repeated beatings for refusing to join Intergang's religion of crime and trying to run away. Isis stops Black Adam from killing some of the Intergang members, despite their crimes. Isis is unable to fully heal his wounds as they are too deep and complex; Black Adam then asks Amon to say his name; Amon is stuck by a lightning bolt and transformed into [[Osiris (DC Comics)#Amon Tomaz|Osiris]]. She prevents Adam from killing the Intergang members. Now reunited with her brother, Isis decides "to change the world", starting from [[China]]. Coerced by her brother's will to act for changing not only the world, but the perception the world itself has of the Black Marvel Family, she coaxes Black Adam into joining them in a public revealing of their human identities, and a public declaration of their good intentions for the future. The Black Marvels defeat the demon, Sabbac, at Halloween when he tries to sacrifice children to Neron with a lightning strike, increasing their popularity. During a charity dinner with Mrs Sivana, Osiris befriends a humanoid crocodile which escaped from Sivana's lab.

Not convinced by this, [[Amanda Waller]] forms a new [[Suicide Squad#52|Suicide Squad]], sending the [[Persuader (comics)|Persuader]] to badly injure Isis with his radioactive axe, able to damage both nature and her godly superpowered form. He is able to cut her cheek open. Osiris rushes to help, shredding the Persuader's body in half. Isis hugs a distraught and weeping Osiris, then they leave, while a storm rages. The event is filmed, turning public opinion against the Black Marvel family. These incidents are part of a calculated series of attacks by [[Intergang]]. Osiris believes his power is evil and fights Adam, only stopped when he accidentally strikes Isis. The events brought about the death of Isis' brother, Osiris, at the hands of [[Sobek (comics)|Sobek]], which leads directly into a battle with the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, contained in physical forms created by Intergang and [[Doctor Sivana]].

Isis dies when she is infected with diseases from the [[Horseman Pestilence]], but not before driving off the Horseman Death with a geyser of lava and saving Adam. Before she dies, Isis tells Adam that she was wrong in trying to change him, and to avenge her and Osiris's deaths. Fury from their deaths leads Adam to World War III. Several weeks later, a hand can be seen reaching for Isis's amulet while her face can be seen within it.

====One Year Later====
In ''Black Adam: The Dark Age'', Adam (now under his civilian title of "Teth-Adam") gets into Khandaq under a false name, and takes her remains despite a shootout in which nearly all his men are killed. On the mountains he is forced to eat his servant Hassan who offers himself to Black Adam. He fails to notice that he has dropped one of her fingers and her ring at the tomb. He resurrects Isis using the [[Lazarus Pit]]. Her resurrection is short lived, as Adam is forced to kill Isis again upon seeing her new body rotting away as soon as she has come back to life. Her bones are then transferred to [[Doctor Fate]]'s tower, where, with the assistance of [[Felix Faust]], Adam turns them into a magical conduit to imbue himself with god-like powers taken from Isis' corpse itself. Apparently, Isis still could be revived, but every time Adam takes power from her, her bones become more brittle, jeopardizing a new attempt at resurrection. Faust reveals that it is Isis' amulet that can revive her, and that [[Mary Marvel]] and [[Captain Marvel Jr.]] broke it into four parts and scattered it across the globe.  It is later revealed that the missing fragments of her body, the reason the Lazarus Pit failed, were being held by [[Albert Rothstein|Atom-Smasher]] who found it when the Justice Society investigated the tomb. He meets Black Adam and gives them to him.

Finally, Black Adam manages to find the pieces of the amulet and reunites it with the now-complete skeleton. The spell apparently backfires, resulting in a shambling, rotting corpse. A séance takes place in which Isis' spirit swears eternal hate on her husband, before returning to death. Black Adam flees, laden with guilt, emptiness, and rage; then Faust begins the real rite, having shown Black Adam [[Elongated Man|Ralph Dibny]]'s skeleton as a way to hide the real Isis from him, and blame "her" rotten condition on Black Adam's abuse of their now-shared powers. So Isis is able to be fully restored to life, even if bound by powerful spells to drain her will and bind her to mindless obedience. Now a mere puppet in Faust's hands, Isis' magic is used to free him from his imprisonment in Fate's Tower by creating a magical doorway through the tower wall. Felix Faust then drags her away to a hideout, where it is strongly implied that he sexually assaults the paralyzed Isis.<ref>''Black Adam: The Dark Age'' #6 (March 2008)</ref>

Later Black Adam, still mourning for her, finds a bloodied flower sprouting in their family shrine. He takes it as a sign that Isis is trying to communicate with him, which becomes apparent when he finds a larger collection of flowers in the shape of the Shazam lightning bolt symbol, pointing in the direction Adam must go to find her.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #16 (July 2008)</ref> Eventually, Black Adam finds Isis and Felix Faust, and Adam forces Faust to release Isis from his control. The resurrected Isis is far less merciful and forgiving than before, and [[castrate]]s Faust for his treatment of her. Reunited, Isis and Adam travel to the Rock of Eternity, where they banish Captain Marvel back to Earth as a powerless Billy Batson, as Isis has turned him back using magic lightning from saying Shazam from a spell book, and begin setting a plan in motion to "cleanse the Earth" of evil their way, even recruiting Mary Marvel to their crusade.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #23 (March 2009)</ref> The Justice Society come to the Rock of Eternity, seeking to help Billy, only for Isis to brutally attack them, even throwing [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]] into the mists covering the Rock, from which there is no escape.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #24 (April 2009)</ref> During the course of the fight, the combatants end up in Kahndaq, where the people praise Black Adam's return. Isis then kills several of the followers, claiming that they are tainted by this new Earth. Black Adam attempts to protect his people, only to be attacked by Mary and Billy, who had been tainted by Mary's power. At that point, Jay Garrick appears with the spirit of Billy's father, and Shazam, whom the former had helped Jay recover from the Rock of Finality. Adam is convinced to return his power to Shazam, so that he could save Isis from her corruption. Shazam is released from his stone form. In turn, Shazam takes the power from Isis, Billy and Mary, and transforms Teth-Adam and Adrianna into statues. Some time later, a shadowy figure appears to the statues in a bolt of lightning, wanting them to be his "champions."<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #25 (May 2009)</ref>

====Brightest Day====
After the events of the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' storyline, Osiris is resurrected by the White Lantern Entity and returns to Khandaq, vowing to restore the kingdom to its former prosperity. Osiris takes the petrified bodies of Adam and Isis and flies off to an unknown destination.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #0 (April 2010)</ref> Despite his best efforts, Osiris is unable to return Adam and Adriana to their living states. He ultimately aligns himself with [[Deathstroke]] and his new team of [[Teen Titans#Brightest Day: Titans- Villains for Hire|Titans]] after being told that the mercenary can help him return his family to life.<ref>''Titans: Villains For Hire Special'' (July 2010)</ref> Both Adriana and Teth-Adam are currently stored in Deathstroke's base of operations, the Labyrinth.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #24 (August 2010)</ref>

It is ultimately revealed by the [[White Lantern Corps|White Lantern Entity]] that Osiris was resurrected with the express purpose of saving Adriana from her fate.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #6 (September 2010)</ref> During a battle with a drug kingpin named Elijah, Osiris experiences a vision of Isis after falling asleep due to the villain Pisces. He is told that he is guilty for his hand in the murder of [[Ryan Choi]], and that in order to free her, he will have to kill more people. Osiris accidentally electrocutes Elijah after waking from his vison after yelling 'Isis,' and returns home to find that more cracks have appeared on Isis' statue. He then surmises that it was Elijah's death which caused the cracks, and states that he will indeed have to kill more people to free Isis from her prison.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #27 (November 2010)</ref> He then kills a guard at Arkham Asylum using his lightning channelled by saying 'Isis' again, although he seems to not enjoy this action, saying 'Great Ra forgive me.'<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #28 (December 2010)</ref> After killing two bank robbers, Osiris is confronted by Freddy Freeman. Somehow, Osiris manages to steal Freddy's power and give it to Isis. However, Isis' first words upon being reunited with her brother are "What have you done to me?"<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #32 (April 2011)</ref> It is soon revealed that the killings Osiris did in her name have corrupted her soul, causing her to haphazardly shift between her kind, caring personality and a callous, cruel one. When Osiris' back is turned, Isis breaks out of the Labyrinth.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #33 (May 2011)</ref> She goes on a rampage, unable to stop herself from using nature to try to destroy the world. In desperation, she attempts to commit suicide by lightning, but Osiris shields her with his own body. When they awake, Isis discovers that the corruption has left her, but she still feels it inside Osiris, and it worries her.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #34 (June 2011)</ref>

It was later revealed by the Entity that Isis was brought back to life because she's the one that will aid the [[Swamp Thing]].<ref>''Brightest Day'' #24 (June 2011)</ref>

Later, Isis aids her brother Osiris in stopping the [[Qurac]]i soldiers who are attacking Khandaq. Isis learns that Osiris has become more violent, killing the soldiers. When the Justice League attacks Deathstroke's Titans, they were stopped by Isis, who forced them to leave Khandaq at once. She declared her rulership of Khandaq, and withdrew the country from the United Nations, stating that they will outlaw outsiders and recognize no power but their own, and that any intrusion will incite ''[[World War III (DC Comics)|World War III]]''. The Justice League's only option is to leave and Deathstroke's Titans leave as well. Isis then tells Osiris that he is not welcome in Khandaq, because of his bloodlust.<ref>''Titans Annual 2011'' (July 2011)</ref>

==Powers and Abilities==
{{Prose|section|date=April 2011}}
In order to change form, Adrianna must be able to say "I Am Isis", thereby invoking spells involving the energies of the extra-dimensional being once known as Isis on Earth. This spell adds almost a hundred pounds of impervious godly muscle and tissue to her frame. This spell seems to be solely vocal; she cannot access this spell if she is gagged or hampered in some way from talking. The precision of this spell is somewhat askew. All Adrianna has to say is "I Am Isis" and she is mystically transformed and instilled with the powers of the goddess. It was later revealed that the powers that Adrianna draws from Isis are the most powerful of the Eight Egyptian Gods. When her powers were possessed by Black Adam, he was able to fight off most of the superheroes on Earth alone. When Black Adam transferred both his and Isis' powers to Mary, she was able to easily withstand Darkseid's Omega Beams. 

After transforming, Adrianna gained physical abilities similar to her brother, husband, and the other Marvels. She is superhumanly strong and is easily capable of lifting far in excess of 100 tons, putting her on the same level as [[Supergirl]], [[Power Girl]], Mary Marvel, Donna Troy, Big Barda, and [[Wonder Woman]]. She is also incredibly durable and cannot be harmed by physical force unless the being she is engaged with is stronger than her. She is also totally bulletproof and bladed weapons shatter against her skin. She is superhumanly fast, capable of moving at speeds past Mach 10 on Earth. She also has far superior reflexes and agility when compared to normal humans, or even other superhumans. Isis is also able to mystically fly through the air at incredible speeds and can travel across and around the planet in minutes. Like the other Marvels, Isis possesses an immense degree of superhuman intelligence, allowing her to come up with solutions to complicated problems quickly. Unlike the other Marvels, Isis' powers focus on the control of nature. She has control over water, fire, earth, air and electricity and can control the weather and the lava within the Earth. These powers are tied to her emotions. When she cried, it began to rain and when she grew angry, enormous roses crushed the buildings around her. Simply put, Isis is nature and can control its every aspect. In addition to her manipulation of natural materials, Isis possesses the power of telekinesis, allowing her to lift objects, fire blasts of telekinetic force, and to create telekinetic shields. Isis' godly energies are able to heal nearly any wound that she has been inflicted (though she has died before) with surprising speed. Using a second amulet, Isis is able to achieve clairvoyance, and is able to see events happening in the present at remote locations. She cannot use this power to see into the past or the future, however. Due to her death and subsequent resurrection, Isis had a bit of trouble controlling her powers for a time. She stated that this was because Nature had deemed her a failed subject, but has since regained full control.

==Other versions==
In the alternate timeline of the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' event, Isis is mentioned by her brother, Osiris believing that she has been killed by the Atlanteans/Amazons war.<ref>''Flashpoint: The World of Flashpoint'' #1 (June 2011)</ref> It is revealed that Isis was held captive by the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsider]] for Black Adam into selling the Outsider his home country, Khandaq. The Outsider then shot Black Adam and threw him off of his train, joining Isis as his trophy/prisoner.<ref>''Flashpoint: The Outsider'' #2 (July 2011)</ref>

==In other media==

===Television===
* Isis appeared in the tenth and final season of ''[[Smallville]]'''s fifth episode ''Isis''.  Portrayed by ''Smallville'' actress [[Erica Durance]], this version saw the amulet of the goddess take over the body of Lois Lane. However, there were nods to the ''Shazam!/Isis Hour'' and the modern character in Durance's portrayal.<ref>[http://ausiellofiles.ew.com/2010/08/24/ausiello-tv-smallville-house-spoilers/#more-10745 ATV Spoiler Alert: A hot 'House' quadrangle, a super 'Smallville' twist, and more!]</ref> In the same episode, actress [[Erica Cerra]], portrayed the character Adrianna (Isis' name in the comics), the charismatic curator of the Metropolis Museum.

===Video games===
* Isis appears on the [[MMORPG]] video game [[DC Universe Online]] voiced by [[Samantha Inoue-Harte]]. Felix Faust tricks Black Adam into giving him his power in order to revive Isis as a zombie. Though Felix Faust escapes, the players defeat Isis even though Black Adam vows that Felix Faust will pay for his treachery and vows that the players will pay for sending Isis back to the dead.
* Isis appears in [[Black Adam]]'s ending for ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'', in which Adam returns to Khandaq after defeating a totalitarian Superman, and decides with his queen, Isis, to magically separate Khandaq off from the rest of the world.

==DVD releases==
Fans of the TV series, with support from Joanna Cameron, lobbied for the release of the series to [[DVD]] for several years. BCI/Ink and Paint has released three DVD sets containing the TV character of Isis:

*''[[Space Sentinels]]'' /''[[The Freedom Force (animated series)|The Freedom Force]]'' - The Complete Series - August 22, 2006
*''[[Hero High]]'' — The Complete Series - May 22, 2007
*''[[The Secrets of Isis]]'' — The Complete Series DVD Set - July 24, 2007

Despite her stated support for the DVD release, Cameron did not participate in the release of the live-action series DVD.
