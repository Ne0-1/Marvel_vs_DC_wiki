'''Isis''' is a [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]], the main character of '''''The Secrets of Isis''''', a live-action [[United States|American]] Saturday Morning television program that served as the second half of ''[[The Shazam!/Isis Hour]]''. The show was produced by [[Filmation|Filmation Associates]].

Like the main character of the first half of the program, [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], Isis also had roots in [[ancient Egyptian]] [[mythology]]. ''The Secrets of Isis'' starred [[Joanna Cameron]] as Andrea Thomas,  a high school science teacher who gains the ability to call upon the powers of the [[goddess]] [[Isis]] after finding an Egyptian amulet. Fifteen episodes of ''The Secrets of Isis'' were produced for ''The Shazam! Isis Hour'', and the character also appeared in three episodes of the ''Shazam!'' portion of the show.

''The Secrets of Isis'' was given its own timeslot in 1977, for which seven new episodes were broadcast alongside reruns from the first two seasons. Isis later appeared in animated form on Fimations' ''[[Tarzan and the Super 7]]'' show in [[1980]].

Isis' first appearance in comics was in ''[[Shazam!]]'' #25 (Sept-Oct. [[1976]]). She was given her own book the following month, which ran for two years.

Fans of the series, with support from Joanna Cameron, have been lobbying for the release of the series to [[DVD]] for the last several years.
