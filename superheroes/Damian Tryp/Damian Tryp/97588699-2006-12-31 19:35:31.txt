Little is known about Damian Tryp apart from that he runs Singularity Investigations, which is in direct competition with [[Madrox]]'s [[X-Factor Investigations]] and his encounters with Madrox's team. He is also one of the few mutants that kept their superhuman powers after the [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], although it has been revealed in X-Factor # 11 that he might not be a mutant at all, but a genetic throwback to an earlier time, i.e., a “changeling,” a predecessor to mutants who develops powers at birth. Tryp’s mutation enables him to live for a very long time, as evidenced by him being alive in the 12th-century Wales as shown in X-Factor # 10. He also is able to move through time in a similar fashion to [[Quicksilver]], which enables him to bring together himself at three different times.

Damian Tryp also seems to be involved in Jamie [[Madrox]]’s past. When Jamie was born, the doctor’s slap caused him to multiply into two identical babies, which was rather shocking to both his parents and the doctor. [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]], a friend of the Madrox family, suggested that they move to Kansas to raise the boy in privacy with the possibility of the boy to be later taught at Professor X’s school for the gifted youngsters. According to X-Factor # 11, however, when Madrox was still young, Tryp also makes an own offer to look after Jamie, claming that Jamie was also a “changeling” like him. Jamie's parents, however, refuse to give Jamie to Tryp, who proceeds to create a freak tornado that kills Jamie’s parents.

The all out conflict between Tryp's Singularity Investigations (SI) and X-Factor Investigations begun after the youngest version of Tryp badly beat [[Siryn]] (after shooting her in the neck with a dart that prevented her from using her powers) and left her for dead in X-Factor # 5. Siryn, as part of her duties for X-Factor Investigations, was investigating a murder of the woman who died in Jack Vaughn’s pent house (a movie star) under suspicious circumstances. Jack Vaughn claimed that the woman was killed by her sister, Gloria Santiago, who was upset about the relationship (claiming that Jack was “no good” for her sister), and that all he was trying to do was wrestle the gun away from her. The sister thus hired X-Factor Investigations to help her clear her name and bring Jack to justice. Singularity Investigations was representing Jack Vaughn with Tryp, Junior (i.e., the youngest version) as the defense counsel. In X-Factor # 3-4, when Siryn and X-Factor Investigations managed to incriminate Vaughn and to thwart SI’s assassination attempt on [[Rictor]] (another member of X-Factor Investigations), so infuriated was Tryp, Junior that he ambushed Siryn and beat her almost to death, leaving her to die in an alley.

In X-Factor # 6, Madrox and Strong Guy give Tryp a very public warning as Tryp is jogging in the park. They tell Tryp that they know that it was him who hurt Siryn, and while they will not hurt him in broad daylight, he should watch his back. In X-Factor # 7, Tryp, Junior and Tryp, Senior make Madrox an offer to join their firm, at which Madrox laughs. 

It has also been exposed that Tryp and his company have been working on a new version of the legacy virus. Specifically, in X-Factor #10, a former Singularity employee came to the X-Factor Investigations and related that Tryp was attempting to restart the [[Legacy Virus]], the plague that killed several mutants (including, briefly, Madrox himself). [[Strong Guy]] was sent to drive the man to safety but once they were alone, Strong Guy killed him and called Tryp to report. It was later revealed later that Tryp had placed a hypnotic suggestion in Strong Guy’s head to turn him into a sleeper agent. In X-Factor # 11-12, it has been reveled that all of Singularity Investigations efforts to create the [[Legacy Virus]] have been to prevent a possible future in which X-Factor manages to undo the [[Decimation]], but as a result, humanity is wiped out by the re-powered mutants in a bloody conflict. As such, X-Factor Investigations' new goal is to undo Decimation, but prevent the conflict Tryp predicted.

In X-Factor # 12, one of the Madrox's dupes blows up the SI building, apparently killing Tryp, Junior and Tryp, Senior (i.e., the middle-aged version), leaving only the ancient Tryp alive, i.e., the one who has been alive the longest and has seen the grim future.
