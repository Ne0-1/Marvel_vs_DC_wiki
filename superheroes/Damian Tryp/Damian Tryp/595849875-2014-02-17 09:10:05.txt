Little is known about Damian Tryp apart from that he runs Singularity Investigations, which is in direct competition with [[Madrox]]'s [[X-Factor Investigations]] and his encounters with Madrox's team. He is also one of the few mutants that kept their superhuman powers after the [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], although it has been revealed that he might not be a mutant, but a genetic throwback to an earlier time, i.e. a "changeling", a predecessor to mutants who develops powers at birth.<ref name="xfactorv3-11">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Peter David]] | Penciller =  [[Roy Allen Martinez]] | Inker = [[Roy Allen Martinez]] | Story = | Title = X-Factor | Volume = 3 | Issue = 11 | Date = November 2006 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref> Tryp’s mutation enables him to live for a very long time, as evidenced by him being alive in 14th-century Wales.<ref name="xfactorv3-10">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Peter David]] | Penciller =  [[Roy Allen Martinez]] | Inker = [[Roy Allen Martinez]] | Story = | Title = X-Factor | Volume = 3 | Issue = 10 | Date = October 2006 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref> He also is able to move through time in a similar fashion to [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], which enables him to bring together himself at three different times.

Damian Tryp also seems to be involved in [[Jamie Madrox]]’s past. When Jamie was born, the doctor’s slap caused him to multiply into two identical babies, which was rather shocking to both his parents and the doctor. [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]], a friend of the Madrox family, suggested that they move to Kansas to raise the boy in privacy with the possibility of the boy to be later taught at [[X-Mansion|Xavier’s School for Gifted Youngsters]]. However, when Madrox was still young, Tryp also makes his own offer to look after Jamie, claiming that Jamie was also a "changeling" like him.<ref name="xfactorv3-11"/> Jamie's parents, however, refuse to give Jamie to Tryp, who proceeds to create a freak tornado that kills Jamie’s parents.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

The all out conflict between Tryp's Singularity Investigations and X-Factor Investigations begun after the youngest version of Tryp badly beat [[Siryn]] (after shooting her in the neck with a dart that prevented her from using her powers) and left her for dead.<ref>''X-Factor'' vol. 3 #5</ref> Siryn, as part of her duties for X-Factor Investigations, was investigating a murder of the woman who died in Jack Vaughn’s pent house (a movie star) under suspicious circumstances. Jack Vaughn claimed that the woman was killed by her sister, Gloria Santiago, who was upset about the relationship (claiming that Jack was “no good” for her sister), and that all he was trying to do was wrestle the gun away from her. The sister thus hired X-Factor Investigations to help her clear her name and bring Jack to justice. Singularity Investigations was representing Jack Vaughn with Tryp 'Junior' (the youngest version) as the defense counsel. Siryn and X-Factor Investigations managed to incriminate Vaughn and to thwart SI’s assassination attempt on [[Rictor]].<ref>''X-Factor'' vol. 3 #4</ref> Tryp 'Junior' was so infuriated by this that he ambushed Siryn and beat her almost to death, leaving her to die in an alley.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Madrox and [[Strong Guy]] give Tryp a very public warning as Tryp is jogging in the park.<ref>''X-Factor'' vol. 3 #6</ref> They tell Tryp that they know that it was he who hurt Siryn, and while they will not hurt him in broad daylight, he should watch his back. Tryp 'Junior' and Tryp 'Senior' (the middle-aged version) make Madrox an offer to join their firm, at which Madrox laughs.<ref>''X-Factor'' vol. 3 #7</ref>

It has also been exposed that Tryp and his company have been working on a new version of the [[Legacy Virus]]. When a former Singularity employee came to the X-Factor Investigations and related that Tryp was attempting to restart the Legacy Virus, the plague that killed thousands of mutants, including a duplicate of Madrox himself.<ref name="xfactorv3-10"/> [[Strong Guy]] was sent to drive the man to safety but once they were alone, Strong Guy killed him and called Tryp to report. It was later revealed that Tryp had placed a hypnotic suggestion in Strong Guy’s head to turn him into a sleeper agent. According to the oldest version of Tryp (ancient), all of Singularity Investigations efforts to create the [[Legacy Virus]] have been to prevent a possible future in which X-Factor manages to undo the [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]], but as a result, humanity is wiped out by the re-powered mutants in a bloody conflict. As such, X-Factor Investigations' new goal is to undo Decimation,<ref name="x-factorv3-12">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Peter David]] | Penciller =  [[Renato Arlem]] | Inker = [[Renato Arlem]] | Story = | Title = X-Factor | Volume = 3 | Issue = 12 | Date = December 2006 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref> but prevent the conflict Tryp predicted.

Due to one of the Madrox's dupes blowing up the SI building, apparently killing Tryp 'Junior' and Tryp 'Senior', only the ancient Tryp is still alive, i.e., the one who has been alive the longest and has seen the grim future.<ref name="x-factorv3-12"/>

After the destruction of Singularity Industries, the present form of Damian Tryp (the elder/ancient) reveals to [[Layla Miller (comics)|Layla]] that her very existence had foiled his plans &mdash;  she is a force of chaos like he is. Tryp also reveals that when he comes into conflict with Layla, terrible events occur as a result. Following her encounter with Tryp, Layla appears genuinely shocked for the first time: the glass of milk she is pouring overflows, spilling onto the floor.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Damian Tryp resurfaces in the future during the time of the [[Summers Rebellion]] as behind the scene orchestrator of the mutants being put into camps, etc.<ref>''X-Factor'' vol. 3 #46-50.</ref><ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=23573 Comicbook resources]</ref>
