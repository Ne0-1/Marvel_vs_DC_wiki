'''Supergirl''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]] created by [[Otto Binder]] and [[Al Plastino]] as part of [[Superman]] family of characters in the late 1950s. Several versions of Supergirl appear in [[comic books]]; the best-known is [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Kara Zor-El]], Supermanâ€™s cousin.  Kara is a [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonian]] who possesses superhuman abilities such as self propelled flight and super strength.  

Kara Zor-El dies during the events depicted in the 1985 [[limited series]] ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''. After the publication of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', DC Comics [[reboot (continuity)|rebooted]] Superman [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]], making Superman the sole survivor of Krypton's destruction.  For nearly 20 years, several different characters took the name Supergirl, although none of them were actually Superman's cousin.  A version of Kara Zor-El was re-introduced into modern continuity in 2004.

Supergirl appears in the 1984 film ''[[Supergirl (film)|Supergirl]]'', starring [[Helen Slater]]; the [[animated series]] ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' and ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''; and the seventh season of the CW network's ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'' television series, portrayed by [[Laura Vandervoort]].

==Precursors==
Many [[Superman]] stories feature one-time appearances of a female version of Superman as a story gimmick.
[[Image:Superman123.jpg|195px|thumb|right|''Superman'' #123: Super-Girl.<br>Art by [[Curt Swan]].]]

*'''Lois Lane ([[Superwoman]])''' &mdash; The first comic to feature a female counterpart to Superman is "[[Lois Lane]] - Superwoman," a story published in ''Action Comics'' #60 (May 1943), in which a hospitalized Lois Lane dreams she has gained superpowers thanks to a blood transfusion from the Man of Steel. She begins her own career as Superwoman, complete with copycat costume. Similar stories with Lois Lane acquiring superpowers and adopting the name "Superwoman" periodically appear later. One such story appears in ''Action Comics'' #156 (May 1951), in which Lois accidentally gains superpowers, thanks to an invention of Superman's arch-foe, [[Lex Luthor]]. In the story, Lois employs a short blond wig in her crime-fighting identity, giving Superwoman an almost identical look to the later Kara Zor-El version of Supergirl.
*'''Claire Kent''' &mdash; In the ''[[Superboy (Kal-El)|Superboy]]'' #78 story entitled "Claire Kent, Alias Super-Sister", Superboy saves the life of an alien woman named Shar-La, who turns Superboy into a girl. In Smallville, Clark claims to be Claire Kent, an out-of-town relative who is staying with the Kents. When in costume, he appears as Superboy's sister, Super-Sister, and claims the two have exchanged places.  As a girl, he is ridiculed and scorned by men, and wants to prove he's as good as he always was. In the end, it is revealed that the situation is an illusion created by Shar-La, and Superboy learns not to ridicule women.
*'''Super-Girl''' &mdash; In ''Superman'' #123 (August 1958), [[Jimmy Olsen]] uses a magic totem to wish a "Super-Girl" into existence as a companion and aid to Superman; however, the two frequently get in each other's way until she is fatally injured protecting Superman from a Kryptonite meteor. At her insistence, Jimmy wishes the dying girl out of existence. DC used this story to gauge public response to the concept of a completely new super-powered female counterpart to Superman.  In the original issue in which this Super-Girl story was printed, she had blond hair and her costume was red and blue like Superman's. Early reprints of this story showed her with red hair and an orange and green costume, to prevent readers from confusing her with the then current Supergirl character. Much later, the story was again reprinted in its original form.

==Pre-''Crisis'' Character biography==
{{main|Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)}}

After positive fan reaction to Super-Girl, the first recurring and most familiar version of Supergirl, Kara Zor-El, debuted in 1959. Kara Zor-El first appeared in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #252 (May 1959) written by Otto Binder who also created [[Mary Marvel]], [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]]'s sister and female [[spin-off]]. Like Supergirl, Mary Marvel was a teen-age female version of an adult male super-hero, wearing a costume that was identical to the older character other than substituting a short skirt for tights. Binder also created  [[Miss America (Marvel Comics)|Miss America]], a super-heroine who shared little other than the name with her sometimes co-star [[Captain America]].

[[Image:Action285.jpg|thumb|''[[Action Comics]]'' #285 (February 1962), Supergirl is introduced to the world. Art by [[Curt Swan]].]]
Kara Zor-El is the last survivor of [[Argo City]] of the planet [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]], which had survived the explosion of the planet and had drifted through space.  When the inhabitants of the colony are slain by [[Kryptonite]], Kara is sent to Earth by her father [[Zor-El]] to be raised by her cousin Kal-El, known as Superman. Fearing that she might not be recognized by Superman, Kara's parents provide a costume based on the Man of Steel's own.

On Earth, Kara acquires super-powers identical to Superman's and adopts the secret identity of Linda Lee, an orphan at Midvale Orphanage. She conceals her blonde hair beneath a brunette wig and functions as Supergirl only in secret, at Superman's request, until she can gain (in his opinion) sufficient control of her powers. After being adopted by Fred and Edna Danvers, Superman decides his cousin is ready to begin operating openly as Supergirl.

In her secret identity, Linda attends Midvale High School as Linda Lee Danvers. In later years, after graduating from Stanhope College, she changes careers several times, holding jobs in student counseling, news reporting, and acting in a TV [[soap opera]]. She also attends college in Chicago. Kara has many boyfriends, including Richard (Dick) Malverne, Jerro the merboy from Atlantis, and member of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]], [[Brainiac 5]]. She does, however, shun serious commitments, putting her super-career first.

Supergirl's secret identity is a closely held secret and is known only to Superman, her foster parents, and the Legion of Super-Heroes, of which she serves as a member for a time. Like all Kryptonians, Supergirl is vulnerable to kryptonite. [[Streaky the Supercat|Streaky]], Linda Danvers' orange cat, acquires temporary super-powers as a result of its exposure to "X-Kryptonite". [[Comet (DC Comics)|Comet the Superhorse]], a former centaur, is Supergirl's equine companion.

One way DC demonstrated the epic nature of its 12-issue [[limited series]] ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' (April 1985-March 1986) was through the deaths of important characters. In issue #7 (October 1985), Supergirl bravely sacrifices her life to save her cousin and the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]] from destruction. When Superman continuity rebooted after the ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', DC editorial felt that Superman should be the sole survivor of Krypton, resulting in Kara being removed from continuity.<ref>[[Peter Sanderson]], ''[[Amazing Heroes]]'' #96, June 1986. "Superman will be the only Kryptonian who survived the destruction of Krypton" - John Byrne on ''[[The Man of Steel (comic book)|The Man of Steel]]''. Excerpted [http://fortress.supermanthrutheages.com/History/end.php here]</ref> Unlike a number of other characters who are shown dying in the Crisis, no one remembers Kara dying or even ever having existed.

After the events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', many historical events from the Multiverse are now being remembered. [[Donna Troy]], after her rebirth and inheritance of [[Harbinger (DC Comics)|Harbinger's]] Orb, has recalled the original Kara Zor-El and her sacrifice to save the Universe.<ref>''[[52 (comic book)|52]]'': Week Four and Week Five'', 2006</ref>

==Post-''Crisis'' Character biography==
DC Comics wanted Superman to be the only surviving Kryptonian following the post-Crisis reboot of Superman continuity. As a result, when DC reintroduced Supergirl in the post-Crisis era, she needed to have a non-Kryptonian origin. Afterwards, DC Comics tried to revamp the Supergirl concept, introducing several more non-Kryptonian Supergirls. Eventually, the rule that Superman should be the only surviving Kryptonian was relaxed, allowing for a return of Kara Zor-El as both Superman's cousin and a Kryptonian survivor.

===Matrix===
{{main|Supergirl (Matrix)}}

[[Image:Supergirl-matrix.png|180px|thumb|'''Matrix''' as Supergirl from ''[[The Adventures of Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]]'' #502. Art by [[Tom Grummet]].]]
After the post-Crisis reboot of Superman continuity in the late 1980s, Supergirl's origin was completely rewritten. No longer was she Superman's cousin, or even Kryptonian. In ''Superman'' v2, #16 (April 1988), a new Supergirl debuted as a man-made lifeform (made of [[protoplasm]]) created by a heroic [[Lex Luthor]] of a "pocket universe".  Lex implanted her with Lana Lang's memories, and she could shapeshift to resemble [[Lana Lang]]. Matrix even believed herself to be Lana for a time. She wore a distaff version of Superman's costume, but Matrix did not have Superman's exact powers.  While she possessed flight and super-strength (like Superman), she could also employ [[telekinesis]], shape-shifting and a cloaking/invisibility power (her cloaking power made her undetectable even to Superman himself). 

Matrix's Supergirl form resembled the pre-Crisis Supergirl. She lived in Smallville with the Kents, who treated "Mae" like their own daughter. While new to Earth, Matrix began a romance with the DC Universe's Lex Luthor until she realized Luthor's evil nature. She left him to find her own way in the world, serving for a time as a member of the [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]] and a hero in her own right.

===Matrix/Linda Danvers===
{{main|Supergirl (Linda Danvers)}}

Beginning in September 1996, DC published a ''Supergirl'' title written by [[Peter David]]. The 1996 ''Supergirl'' comic revamps the previous Matrix Supergirl by merging her with a human being, resulting in a new Supergirl. Many old elements of the pre-Crisis Supergirl are reintroduced in new forms. The woman that Matrix merges with has the same name as pre-Crisis Supergirl's secret identity, Linda Danvers. The series is set in the town of Leesburg, named after pre-adoption secret identity, Linda Lee. Linda's father is named Fred Danvers, the same as pre-Crisis Supergirl's adopted father. Furthermore, new versions of Dick Malverne and Comet appear as part of the supporting cast.

[[Image:Supergirl.PNG|thumb|left|Cover of ''Supergirl'' #78. Art by [[Ed Benes]].]]
As the series begins, Matrix sacrifices herself to save a dying woman named Linda Danvers, and their bodies, minds, and souls merge to become an "Earth-Born [[Angel]]", a being that is created when one being selflessly sacrifices him or herself to save another who is, in every way, beyond saving. As the angel, Supergirl loses some of her powers but gains others, including fiery angel wings and a "shunt" ability that allows her to teleport to any place she has been before.

The angelic aspect of Supergirl eventually falls from grace,<ref>Supergirl #50</ref> and Linda and Matrix are separated once more into two beings. Linda retains some of Supergirl's super-strength and durability, and although she can no longer fly, she can leap 1/8th of a mile. Linda acts as Supergirl for a while, attempting to locate her angelic aspect. After she is found in the [[Garden of Eden]] and freed from the Demon Mother, Matrix merges with a woman named [[Twilight (comics)|Twilight]] and becomes the new Earth-born angel of fire. Twilight uses her healing powers to increase Linda's strength to Supergirl's levels and restores her powers of flight and telekinesis. In ''Supergirl'' #75 (December 2002), detoured on her way to Earth, the pre-Crisis Supergirl arrives in post-Crisis Leesburg. After learning that Kara is destined to die, Linda travels to the pre-Crisis universe in her place, where she marries Superman and bears a daughter named [[Ariella Kent|Ariella]].  In order to save her daughter's life, Linda ultimately allows history to unfold as it should have, with Kara assuming her rightful but tragic place in the time-stream.  

Upon returning to the post-Crisis DC universe, Linda abandons the role of Supergirl.  Peter David's creator-owned series ''[[Fallen Angel (comics)|Fallen Angel]]'', published by [[DC Comics]], features a character, Lee, who is similar to Linda and explores the same themes as Peter David's Supergirl series. Prior to ''Fallen Angel'' moving to another company, Lee was written in a manner such that she could have been Linda. According to an interview with Newsarama,<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/dcnew/InfiniteCrisis/counseling7.html Newsarama.com: Crisis Counseling: The Finale]</ref> Matrix Supergirl is wiped from existence by the events depicted in the 2005 limited series ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', although ''Infinite Crisis'' writer [[Geoff Johns]] has stated that Danvers is not.<ref>[http://www.comicbloc.com/forums/showthread.php?t=26089&page=2&pp=16 The Comic Bloc Forums - Geoff, We need to talk - Page 2]</ref>

===Cir-El===
{{main|Supergirl (Cir-El)}}

A Supergirl named Cir-El appears in 2003's ''Superman: The 10 Cent Adventure'' #1, claiming to be the future daughter of Superman and [[Lois Lane]].  Although she has super-strength, speed, and hearing like Superman, she can only leap great distances.  She also possesses the ability to fire blasts of red solar energy.  Her alter ego is a street person named Mia. She is later found to be a human girl who was altered by Brainiac on a genetic level to appear Kryptonian; she dies thwarting a plot involving [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]] 13. ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' Vol. 2 #200 implies that when the timeline realigned itself, Cir-El was no longer in continuity. Cir-El is unique among the various incarnations of Supergirl; she is the only one who is not a blonde.

===Kara Zor-El===
{{main|Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)}}

Issue #8 of the ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' series originally published in 2004 re-introduced [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)#Post-Crisis Kara Zor-El|Kara Zor-El]] into DC continuity. Like the pre-Crisis version, this Kara claims to be the daughter of Superman's uncle Zor-El and aunt Alura. Unlike the traditional Supergirl origin, Kara was born before Superman; she was a teenager when he was a baby.  She had been sent in a rocket in suspended animation to look after the infant Kal-El; however, her rocket was caught in the explosion of Krypton, became encased in a [[kryptonite]] [[asteroid]], and she arrived on Earth years after Kal-El had grown up and embarked on his career as Superman.  Due to this extended period of suspended animation she is "younger" than her cousin, relatively speaking (she is referenced to be about 16, while Superman is portrayed to be about 35+).  At the end of "The Supergirl from Krypton" arc, her cousin Superman officially introduces her to all the heroes of the {{DC Universe}}, then she adopts the Supergirl costume, and accepts the name.  

[[Image:Supergirlissue1.jpg|180px|right|thumb|'''Kara Zor-El''' stars as '''Supergirl'''.]]A new ''Supergirl'' series, written by Jeph Loeb, began publication in August 2005. The storyline in the first arc of ''Supergirl'' depicts a darker, evil version of Kara emerging when Lex Luthor exposes her to [[Black Kryptonite]]. The evil Supergirl implies that Kara's family sent her to earth to kill Kal-El as revenge for a family grudge; at the time, Kara herself refuses to believe this, but later flashbacks indicate that not only was this partly true but Kara had been physically altered by her father as a child before being involved in several murders on Krypton.

Supergirl also appears in ''Supergirl and the Legion of Super-Heroes'',  in which she is transported to the 31st century, and, as a result of her disorientation, for a time believes she is dreaming her surroundings into existence until finally convinced otherwise. Although her memories of her time with the Legion were erased before she returned to the present, the mental blocks broke down upon encountering the pre-crisis versions of legionaries [[Karate Kid]] and [[Triad]] (Una).

Supergirl exhibits new powers, manifesting sunstone crystals from her body; so far she has only done so while under great stress (for example, when Cassandra Cain tries to kill her). Supergirl's father implanted the crystals within his daughter's body to protect her from malevolent beings from the Phantom Zone.  The Zone-dwellers were released when Jor-El made the Phantom Zone Projector and exploited the Zone as a prison. Kara's father, believing that Kal-El is a lure to the Zone-dwellers, has instructed Kara to destroy him.

==Supporting characters==
Even though Supergirl is a Superman supporting character, she is also a Superman Family member, with her own set of supporting characters.

*'''Zor-El and Alura''' &mdash; Kara Zor-El's biological parents. Zor-El, the younger brother of Jor-El, was a scientist who invented the dome over Argo City and oversaw the placement of lead shielding over the ground of Argo City, thus enabling the city's residents to survive after the explosion of Krypton. The city drifted in space for about 15 years, the residents clinging to a precarious existence. During that time, the couple had a daughter, Kara, who grew to about the age of 10-12 when the city's existence was put in peril when its lead shielding was punctured by meteors, releasing deadly kryptonite radiation. At this point, Zor-El and Alura placed Kara in a rocket ship and sent her to Earth, which Zor-El had observed using a powerful electronic telescope. Observing a super-powered man resembling his brother Jor-El, and wearing a uniform of Kryptonian styling, Zor-El (and Alura) concluded the man was probably their nephew, Kal-El, sent through space by Jor-El when Krypton exploded and now grown to adulthood. In later Silver Age accounts, Zor-El and Alura survive the death of Argo City when, shortly before the radiation reached lethal levels, Zor-El projects them both into the immaterial Phantom Zone; later they are released from the Zone and go to live in the bottle city of Kandor preserved in microscopic size at Superman's Fortress. Under the Silver Age version of the continuity, Supergirl could regularly visit with both her adoptive parents, the Danverses (see below), and her birth parents, in Kandor.
*'''[[Streaky the Supercat]]''' &mdash; Pre-Crisis Supergirl's pet cat who acquires super-powers after exposure to X-Kryptonite.
*'''[[Comet (DC Comics)|Comet the Super-Horse]]''' &mdash; Pre-Crisis Supergirl's horse who is a centaur accidentally cursed by [[Circe (comics)|Circe]] into being trapped in the form of a horse. In post-Crisis continuity, Comet is a superhero who is a romantic interest of Linda Danvers.
*'''Fred and Edna Danvers''' &mdash; The foster parents of pre-Crisis Supergirl. Shortly after they adopt Linda Lee from the Midvale orphanage, Superman reveals his cousin's identity to her foster parents, so they are aware of her super-powers. Later, they are also aware that Superman is secretly Clark Kent.
*'''Dick Malverne''' &mdash; An orphan at the Midvale Orphanage who is one of Pre-Crisis Supergirl's romantic interests. While living at the Midvale Orphanage as Linda Lee, Supergirl meets and befriends fellow orphan, Dick Wilson. Dick suspects that Linda is secretly Supergirl and is constantly trying to prove Linda has super-powers. Later, Dick is adopted by  a couple named Malverne, and changes his name to Dick Malverne. In post-Crisis continuity, Dick Malverne is a newly arrived resident to Leesburg who befriends Linda Danvers.
*'''Jerro the Merboy''' &mdash; A merperson from Atlantis who is another of Pre-Crisis Supergirl's romantic interests.

==Supergirls==
[[Image:SupergirlsII.JPG|thumb|right|225px|"Supergirls", from ''Superman/Batman'' #24.]]
"The Supergirls" is a three-part storyline in ''Action Comics'' #806-808 in which female Superman-related characters [[Cir-El]], [[Traci Thirteen|Girl 13]], and [[Natasha Irons]] protect Superman from a woman who blames [[Superman]] for the death of her husband.

In ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' #24, [[Darkseid]] traps Superman in the [[Source Wall]], and [[Bizarro]] assembles the pre-Crisis Kara Zor-El, post-Crisis Kara Zor-El, Linda Danvers, Cir-El, and [[Power Girl]] to rescue Superman.  After his escape, Superman thanks the Supergirls, but he only recognizes Kara (post-Crisis), Power Girl, and Linda. He doesn't recognize the other two because their timelines had been erased.

==Other versions==
Several different versions of Supergirl have appeared in continuity.

*'''[[Power Girl]] (Kara Zor-L)'''&mdash;An alternate version of Kara Zor-El from the parallel world, [[Earth-Two]], the cousin of [[Superman (Kal-L)]].
*'''[[Laurel Gand|Laurel Gand (Andromeda)]]'''&mdash;Laurel Gand was the post-Crisis/Glorithverse replacement for the pre-Crisis Supergirl in the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]], after the latter was removed from continuity following [[The Man of Steel (comic book)|''The Man of Steel'']] reboot of [[Superman]]. Originally, Laurel was simply known by her given name. A younger version of Laurel took the superhero code name "Andromeda" shortly before the [[Zero Hour (comics)|''Zero Hour'']] reboot of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes|Legion]]; post-reboot, Laurel remained Andromeda.
*'''[[Ariella Kent]]'''&mdash;Supergirl of the 853rd century, later revealed to be the daughter of post-Crisis Linda Danvers and Silver Age style Superman from the ''Many Happy Returns'' story arc.

===Elseworlds=== 
Supergirl has also been featured in several [[Elseworlds]] titles:

*In [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'', Superman and Wonder Woman hide their daughter Lara from the world her entire life, but she later becomes important to the defeat of Lex Luthor and Brainiac, the story's antagonists. Lara possesses some of Wonder Woman's powers, benefiting from both Kryptonian and Amazonian heritage.
*In [[Kurt Busiek]]'s ''[[Superman: Secret Identity]]'' miniseries, which depicts a [[Clark Kent]] who lives in the real world, Lois gives birth to two girls who grow up to manifest their father's powers and adopt variations on his costume.
*''[[Elseworld's Finest: Supergirl & Batgirl]]'' depicts a Barbara Gordon/Kara Zor-El team in a world without their male counterparts.
*''[[Supergirl: Wings]]'' reworks the Earth-born angel storyline; in it, Linda's guardian angel is Matrix, whose cynical view of her charge may lead to her fall.
*In the ''[[Superman/Aliens]]'' [[crossover (comics)|crossover]] limited series, published in 1995 by DC Comics and [[Dark Horse Comics]], Superman discovers a domed city on an asteroid, not unlike the [[Argo City]] of pre-Crisis Supergirl's origins, that is infested with the [[xenomorph (Alien)|xenomorph]]s. Superman befriends the sole survivor, a plucky 16-year-old girl named Kara. The story reveals that Kara is not Superman's cousin, and that the colony is not Kryptonian, but is instead part of a world whose culture and religion were strongly influenced by Krypton.
*In ''[[Superman & Batman: Generations]]'', Superman's young daughter, Kara Kent, takes up the identity of Supergirl and forms a new Justice League with Bruce Wayne Jr., [[Wally West]], and Stephanie Prince.  Kara later falls in love with Bruce Jr.  The two plan to wed, but the event never occurs because Kara is killed by her jealous brother Joel, who had been born without powers due to being exposed to gold kryptonite while he was still a fetus, but was given super powers and brainwashed by Lex Luthor in a plot to have the children of Superman kill each other.
*In ''[[JLA: Created Equal]]'', Linda Danvers, fifteen years after the Fall, changes her name to Superwoman.
*In ''JLA: Act of God'', Linda Danvers is one of many metahumans who loses her powers due to the black light event that strips the entire metahuman community powerless. However, she, along with Martian Manhunter, Aquaman, the Flash, train with Batman and his associates so they may still be heroes. Changing her name to '''Justice''', Linda and the others form the Phoenix Group.
* In ''Superman/GenÂ¹Â³'', [[Caitlin Fairchild]] of the [[GenÂ¹Â³]] had received a bump on the head and suffered amnesia. When she awoke, she found Superman's cape draped over her and assumed that, with her super powers, she was Supergirl. She believed that she couldn't fly due to exposure to red kryptonite which, at the time, was only considered an urban legend. After going through multiple Supergirl outfits and generally causing more havoc then good, she was found by the other GenÂ¹Â³s and Superman, when the real Supergirl knocked her out. When Caitlin awoke, she regained her memory.

===Film===
{{main|Supergirl (film)}}

[[Image:Helen Slater as Supergirl.png|thumb|[[Helen Slater]] as Supergirl in the [[Supergirl (film)|1984 movie]].]]
A [[feature film]] adaptation ''[[Supergirl (film)|Supergirl]]'' was released in 1984, starring [[Helen Slater]] in her first motion picture role.  ''Supergirl'' was a spin-off from the popular 1978 film ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'', and [[Marc McClure]] reprises his role of [[Jimmy Olsen]].  The movie performed poorly at the box office and failed to impress critics or audiences; [[Peter O'Toole]] received a [[Golden Raspberry Award]] nomination for Worst Actor for his performance, while [[Faye Dunaway]] received a Worst Actress nomination for hers.<ref>[http://www.razzies.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=334&PN=2 1984 RAZZIEÂ® Nominees & "Winners"]</ref> Prior to its release, ''Supergirl'' was expected to be the first film of a series, and Helen Slater had a contract for three films, but ''Supergirl'''s failure at the box office cancelled plans for a ''Supergirl II''.

Supergirl was originally planned for ''[[Superman III]]'', in a treatment written by [[Ilya Salkind]].  In a bizarre twist from the comics, Supergirl was to be the surrogate daughter of Brainiac who falls in love with Superman, who until then had been portrayed as her cousin.<ref>[http://www.supermancinema.co.uk/superman3/general/script/s3_original_idea.pdf]</ref>

===''Smallville''===
[[Image:Hi-Res Supergirl.jpg|thumb|left|Promotional image of [[Laura Vandervoort]] as Kara Zor-El from ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville's]]'' seventh season. Her jacket is blue in the actual program.]]
A girl named Kara (played by [[Adrianne Palicki]]) appears in the ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'' television series episode "[[Smallville (season 3)#Covenant|Covenant]]," claiming to be from Krypton, although she does not call herself Supergirl or Kara Zor-El or even claim to be Kal-El's cousin. She was explained to be Clark's cousin when Lana asked who she was, which served more as a nod to comic fans at the time.

The actual Supergirl character appears in the program's seventh season, beginning with the season premiere and lasting seven or more episodes. She is played by actress [[Laura Vandervoort]].<ref>Cynthia Wang, "Supergirl Lands in Smallville," People.com July 11, 2007 [http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20045784,00.html]</ref> Kara was sent from Krypton at the same time as was Kal-El to look after him, but was trapped under a dam during the first meteor shower and was in suspended animation for the past 18 years. After the dam is broken, Kara Zor-El is freed. As the daughter of [[Zor-El]], she is Clark's Kryptonian cousin, and hence possesses the same powers. Though she has also mastered flight, she, like her comic book counterpart, lacks the control Clark has developed over his years of dealing with humans. For example, she is unaware of the more subtle super-hearing until taught to use it by Clark.

Kara explains that Clark was not made aware of her existence because their respective fathers were not on good terms, exemplified by Jor-El's distrust when informed of her arrival by Clark. The [[Martian Manhunter]] AKA John Jones is similarly distrustful of her, as Kara is of him, claiming that Zor-El attempted to have Jor-El assassinated. In the episode "Lara", it is revealed the Martian Manhunter was correct about her father. Zor-El had tried to kill his brother out of the love he had for Jor-El's wife, Lara. Kara witnessed an incident where Zor-El attempted to force Lara to leave Jor-El and love him. Zor-El had erased her memories, causing her to believe he was a good man until now. Realizing she was wrong about her father, she puts her memories of him aside and remains with Clark on the farm.

===[[Superfriends]]===
Althought not appearing in the show, she did appear in some of the related comic with the show. <ref>[http://www.comicvine.com/comic/super-friends/2847/20713/]</ref> 

===[[DC Animated Universe]]===
[[Image:The animated Supergirl.jpg|thumb|right|The animated Supergirl, as designed by [[Bruce Timm]].]]
Supergirl first appears, voiced by [[Nicholle Tom]], in the two-part ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' episode "[[Little Girl Lost (Superman: The Animated Series)|Little Girl Lost]]" as Kara In-Ze from Krypton's "sister world" of [[Argo City#Other Media|Argos]]. The character is depicted as a headstrong and independent teenage girl who was placed in suspended animation before the conditions on Argos became inhospitable. The daughter of planetary chief physician Kala In-Ze, Kara was the only survivor of her planet, the rest having died when their suspended animation units suffered damage over time. While on a space exploration trip, Superman discovers Argos and consequently Kara. Clark arranges for the Kents to take Kara in while she adjusts to life on Earth, and upon visiting Clark in Metropolis, she wears glasses and a brunette wig with a ponytail to pose as Clark's cousin Kara Kent. This Supergirl shares Superman's vulnerability to kryptonite; she also suffers from [[Phobia|cheimatophobia]] (fear of cold), due to her experiences prior to her time in suspended animation. Kara is written as eager to take up a position at the right hand of Superman, but Superman thinks she is too young and unready, despite the fact that she and [[Jimmy Olsen]], who struck up a friendship at once, were critical in ferreting out an early connection between [[Intergang]] and [[Granny Goodness]].  Kara becomes friends with [[Batgirl]] in ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'' episode "Girls' Nite Out", though their meeting is played for laughs and the girls depicted as somewhat inept.
 
The costume worn by the animated Supergirl is used by Linda Danvers in the 1996 ''Supergirl'' comic book series. She continues to use that same costume in her first appearance in the first episode of ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', where the voice-acting role is reprised by Nicholle Tom. In the third season of JLU, Supergirl appears in a new outfit (the more traditional blue top with red miniskirt) that resembles Kara Zor-El's post-Crisis costume. In the episode in which the costume first appears, the explanation is that the costume was altered to look more like Superman's mentioned in a discussion between Green Arrow and Superman.

Supergirl appears in ''Justice League'' as a mourner at Superman's funeral; she does not wear her Kara Kent disguise. Rather, she has her blonde hair exposed and is attired in sombre black, a discrepancy that was never addressed considering that throughout the rest of her civilian appearances, she is in her disguise.

In the ''Justice League Unlimited'' animated series, scientists from Project Cadmus create [[Galatea (Justice League Unlimited)|Galatea]], an evil clone of the program's Supergirl (Kara) for nefarious purposes. The clone is a more mature version of Kara, and in appearance and costume is a homage to [[Power Girl]]. Kara, accompanied by [[Green Arrow]] and [[Question (comics)|Question]] travel to [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] to investigate. From this episode on, Green Arrow becomes a sort of father figure to Kara and frequently discusses her with Superman. In the episode "Far From Home", Green Arrow tells Superman that he and [[Black Canary]] planned on bringing Supergirl out to celebrate her twenty-first birthday.

In the ''Justice League Unlimited'' episode "Far From Home", Supergirl, along with [[Green Lantern]] and [[Green Arrow]], encounter [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] members [[Brainiac 5]] and [[Bouncing Boy]].  They have brought the three modern heroes to the 31st century to aid them in defeating the [[Fatal Five]], who have implanted mind control in all Legionnaires. However, Brainiac 5 tells Green Lantern and Green Arrow that 30th century history says that Supergirl never returned to her own time; Braniac 5 and Bouncing Boy assume this indicates that she will die while on this mission.  As Kara experiences the techonology and society of the 30th century, which is similar to that of her lost homeworld, she becomes more and more conflicted about returning to the past, where she has never felt that she fits in.  Finally, she and Brainiac 5 develop romantic feelings for each other, and when Green Lantern and Green Arrow prepare to return to the past, she tells them that 30th century history will be fulfilled since she is staying in the future as a member of the Legion. Paying homage to then new comic "Supergirl and the Legion of Superheroes".
