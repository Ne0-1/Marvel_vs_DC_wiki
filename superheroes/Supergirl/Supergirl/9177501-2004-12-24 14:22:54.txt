'''Supergirl''' is a [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]], who is the female counterpart to [[Superman]]. Created by [[Otto Binder]] and [[Al Plastrino]], she first appeared in ''Superman'' #123 ([[1958]]).

Due to a somewhat disjointed [[continuity]], several variations of Supergirl have appeared in [[comic books]]. However, in her most well-known incarnation, Supergirl is Supermanâ€™s cousin, also sent to [[Earth]] during the last moments of the doomed planet [[Krypton]]. Also like her cousin, Supergirl can fly and possesses superhuman strength and endurance. Since the mid-[[1980s]], some complex [[science fiction]] concepts have redefined the character.

In [[1984]], [[Helen Slater]] starred in an unsuccessful [[film]] version of Supergirl, which was part of the [[Superman (movie)|Superman film franchise]]. Supergirl has also appeared in the recent Superman [[television]] series, ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' and ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]''

In ''Superman'' #123 (August [[1958]]), [[Jimmy Olsen]] used a magic totem to wish a "Super-Girl" into existence as a companion and aid to Superman. However, the two frequently got in each other's way, and Jimmy eventually wished her out of existence. DC used the story to gauge public response to the concept of a super-powered female counterpart to Superman.

==Superman's cousin==
After positive fan reaction to Super-Girl, the first&mdash;and still most familiar version&mdash;of Supergirl debuted in 1959.

===Superman's secret weapon===
The character of Supergirl was introduced in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #252 [http://superman.ws/supergirl/introducing/] (May [[1959]]) as Kara Zor-El, the last survivor of Argo City of the planet [[Krypton (planet)|Krypton]], which had survived the explosion of the planet and had drifted through space. When the inhabitants of the colony were slain by [[Kryptonite]], Kara was sent to Earth to be raised by her cousin Kal-El, known as Superman. Fearing that she might not be recognised by Superman, Kara's parents provided a costume based closely on the Man of Steel's own (and almost identical to Super-Girl's). This uniform served as her crime-fighting attire for the first decade of her adventures in print.

Upon meeting Kara&mdash;who on Earth now had superpowers identical to her cousin's&mdash;Superman decided she would become his secret weapon, and explained that her presence on [[Earth]] must be kept confidential while he trained Kara in the use of her new powers. Kara adopted the identity of Linda Lee, an orphan at Midvale Orphanage, hiding her short blonde locks beneath a brunette wig. Her adventures often accompanied the main Superman story in issues of ''Action Comics''. They typically revolved around secretly helping fellow orphans, although occasionally she was allowed to play a small role alongside her famous cousin. She also became a member of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] alongside [[Superboy]], the teenage incarnation of her cousin.

Superman permitted Supergirl to reveal her existence to the world in ''Action Comics'' #285 (February 1962). In the same story Linda was adopted by Fred and Edna Danvers, to whom she revealed her secret identity.  Changing her name to Linda Lee Danvers (later known as just Linda Danvers), she became a student of Midvale High School.

Besides her  heroic feats, Kara juggled several beaus, including [[Jerro]], [[Brainiac 5]], and [[Dick Malverne]], a former fellow orphan, and gained [[Streaky]], a pet cat that also possessed superpowers.

===On her own===
Graduating high school in [[1964]], Linda left home to attend [[Stanhope College]] on a scholarship. Supergirl won the lead slot in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' #381 (June [[1969]]), trading ''Action Comics'' with the Legion. During her ''Adventure'' run, Supergirl&mdash;mirroring the fashions of the times&mdash;began to experiment with a wide variety of costume and hairstyle changes. Although Superman became only an infrequent visitor in her adventures, Kara maintained close ties with her cousin while pursuing her own career as a [[superhero]]. Her term at ''Adventure'' ended when Kara received her own title in November [[1972]], which ran for only ten issues before being rolled into ''[[Superman Family]]'', alongside other Superman-related supporting characters' titles.

Throughout the [[1970s]] twists and turns in Kara's career as Supergirl ran parallel to changes in her civilian life. As Linda, she moved from student, to television reporter, to student counselor, to actress on the TV soap ''Secret Hearts''.

===Back to school===

In November [[1982]] Supergirl again received her own title, ''The Daring New Adventures of Supergirl'' (later simply ''Supergirl''). DC intended to return the character to her roots, and by implicitly ignoring the previous 18 years of stories Linda again became an 18-year old student, this time at [[Lake Shore University]] in [[Chicago]].  During its 23 issues Supergirl adopted her final costume (originally designed, but not used, for the ''Supergirl'' movie) and finally discarded the brunette wig, in favor of a special comb which changed her hair color and style.

When DC canceled ''Supergirl'' in [[1984]], the company intended to start a new title starring both Supergirl and Superboy. However, fate took a different path.

===A heroic death===
One of the ways DC intended to demonstrate the epochal nature of its 12-issue [[miniseries]] ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' (April [[1985]]-March [[1986]]) was the deaths of important characters. In #7 (October 1985), Supergirl&mdash;in one of the most memorable moments of the series&mdash;bravely sacrificed her life to save her cousin, and the [[multiverse]], from destruction. Ironically, one of the Crisis' effects on the DC universe was that Supergirl, as readers knew her for almost 30 years, now had never existed.

==Post-Crisis history==
After the [[reboot (continuity)|reboot]] of Superman in the late [[1980s]], Supergirl's origin was completely rewritten. No longer would she be Superman's cousin, or even Kryptonian.

===No longer anyone's cousin===
[[Image:The_Matrix_Supergirl.JPG|thumb|right|The Matrix/"Mae" Supergirl.]]

Debuting in ''Superman'' v2 #16 (April [[1988]]), Supergirl was now an artificial life form of [[protoplasm]] created by a [[parallel world|parallel]] Earth's [[Lex Luthor]], and sent to recruit Superman to return to her world and save it from destruction at the hands of three escaped criminals from the planet Krypton. When the mission failed and the world was destroyed, Superman returned home with the injured artificial creature.

For a while the life form developed amnesia and thought it was Superman, coincidentally helping to preserve Superman's secret identity during a lengthy absence from Earth. Later, it again took on a female form, and the identity of Supergirl, under the name "Mae." In this guise, she began a romance with the mainstream DC universe's Lex Luthor. When Mae realized Luthor's evil nature, she left him to find her own way in the world, serving for a time as a member of the [[Teen Titans]].

===Earth angel===
A new ''Supergirl'' title appeared in September [[1996]]. Writer [[Peter David]] merged the protoplasmic Supergirl with a troubled young Virginia woman named Linda Danvers, together becoming an "Earth [[Angel]]". Linda eventually separated from the angelic part, and acted as Supergirl for a while with reduced powers before regaining her abilities (but not her angelic aspect).

===The return of the original Supergirl===
In ''Supergirl'' #75 (December [[2002]]), David introduced the original Supergirl&mdash;who had apparently been detoured into the post-Crisis universe on her way to the pre-Crisis Earth&mdash;into the current Supergirl's life. Knowing Kara was destined to die, Linda traveled to the pre-Crisis universe in her place, where she married Superman and had a daughter, Ariella. However, she had to allow history to take its place in order to ensure one universe would survive the Crisis.

Upon returning to the contemporary DC universe, Linda abandoned the role of Supergirl. Her current whereabouts are unknown, although fans have speculated she may be the unsympathetic lead character of David's new creator-owned series for DC, ''[[Fallen Angel (comics)|Fallen Angel]]''.

==Yet more Supergirls==
Following this, another Supergirl appeared, claiming to be the daughter of Superman and [[Lois Lane]] from the future. Her name was, apparently, Cir-El, though her alter ego, which seemed to be more of a [[schizophrenic]] personality change than a simple change of costume, was that of a street person named Mia. She was later found to be a [[clone]], created by a group of villains from the future; she died to prevent them from (re)creating [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]] 13.

In [[2004]], Kara Zor-El was reintroduced into DC continuity in the ''Superman/Batman'' series. Like the pre-Crisis version, this Kara claims to be the daughter of Superman's uncle Zor-El and his wife Alura. Following the end of "The Supergirl from Krypton" arc, Kara officially introduces herself to many of the heroes of the DCU, and adopts the classic Supergirl costume and name. Whether or not the previous post-Crisis Supergirls are still in continuity is unknown at this point.

==Other Media==
===Movie===
A movie adaptation of Supergirl was released in [[1984 in film|1984]], starring [[Helen Slater]] in her first motion picture role. It was a spin-off from the popular [[1978 in film|1978 movie]] ''[[Superman (movie)|Superman]]'', with [[Marc McClure]] reprising his role as Jimmy Olsen.  The movie performed poorly at the box office, and failed to impress critics or audiences.  In fact, [[Peter O'Toole]] received a [[1984 Golden Raspberry Awards|Golden Raspberry Award]] nomination for Worst Actor for his performance.

===Cartoon===

In [[Superman: The Animated Series]], Supergirl was introduced as Kara In-Ze, from Krypton's "sister world" of Argo. A headstrong and independent teenage girl, she was placed in [[suspended animation]] before Argo was destroyed by the aftershocks of Krypton's destruction, and later found by Superman. The Kents&mdash;Clark Kent's adoptive parents&mdash;took Kara in, with her posing as Clark's cousin Kara Kent.

This Supergirl currently appears in the USA on [[Cartoon Network]]'s [[Justice League Unlimited]] [[animated]] [[television series]]. Villains created a clone of Supergirl named Galatea for nefarious purposes. Grown into a slightly more mature physical state, the clone resembles [[Power Girl]].

===Live-action television===
A girl named Kara appeared in an episode of the ''[[Smallville (television series)|Smallville]]'' TV series claiming to be from Krypton. This Kara did not claim to be Kal-El's cousin, though, and she seemed to be interested in him in a sexual way. She was not, however, an actual Kryptonian, but an innocent girl kidnapped, brainwashed, and given superpowers by Jor-El.
