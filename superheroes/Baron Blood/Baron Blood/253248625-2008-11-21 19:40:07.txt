===Fictional character biography===
'''John Falsworth''' was a British aristocrat, born as the younger brother of James Montgomery Falsworth in the late 19th century. He left England when James inherited their father's estate. John believed the legend of [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampires]] to be real and traveled to [[Transylvania]] to seek out [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]] in an attempt to gain power, but instead fell under Dracula's power. Dracula turned John into a vampire, and then commanded John to wreak havoc on England. John sided with Germany during [[World War I]] as an assassin (where he gained the code-name ''Baron Blood''), and fought his brother (secretly [[Union Jack (comics)|Union Jack]]) and [[Freedom's Five]].

During [[World War II]], John also sided with Germany and in exchange [[Nazi]] scientists found a way to mitigate his susceptibility to [[sunlight]]. He fought the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]], crippling his brother Union Jack I, and wounding [[Spitfire (comics)|Jacqueline Falsworth]]. He was killed when he was impaled on silver-veined stalagmite.<ref>''Invaders'' #7-9</ref>

He was later resurrected by the forces of [[Lady Lotus]] and battled the Invaders alongside the [[Super-Axis]]. He was killed again by a wooden stake through the heart and buried in the [[Tower of London]].<ref>''Invaders'' #39-41</ref>

Many years later, he was again resurrected, this time by one of Dracula's servants, Dr. Jacob Cromwell. Blood returned home with Cromwell, but turned on them. He killed Cromwell and one of his daughters and turned the other daughter into a vampire, who came to be known as Baroness Blood. Baron Blood assumed Jacob Cromwell's identity. He started killing again and Union Jack suspected that his brother had returned. He asked [[Captain America]] to help him investigate the murders. Baron Blood battled Captain America and [[Union Jack (Joseph Chapman)|the third Union Jack]].  Eventually Blood was decapitated by Captain America using his shield, burned to ashes, and the ashes were scattered.<ref>Captain America #253-254</ref>

Baron Blood was later brought back as part of the second [[Legion of the Unliving]]; he battled Captain America and the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] but was again destroyed.<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #16</ref>

===Powers and abilities===
The first Baron Blood had all the powers inherent to a [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampire]], including superhuman strength and durability, the ability to instantly hypnotize humans, the ability to command mice, rats, bats, and wolves, and the standard vulnerability to garlic, silver, the presence of religious symbols, beheading, and wooden stakes through the heart. 

John was also given special cosmetic treatments which enabled him to withstand sunlight and remain active in daylight.  During daylight he would become weaker, but at the night he is at full strength; he once even defeated the entire Invaders at night.

He also had limited physical malleability, limited weather control over small areas, and bat-like hearing.

John also used knock out gas that would leave victims dizzy and unconscious.

===Other versions===
====Marvel Apes====
The Baron is revealed to be the person who sired the Invaders as vampires and killed [[Baron Zemo|Baron Zemook]] . He killed Zemook, then ambushed and took the form of Captain America, whom he sent to his demise. He continued to sire [[Namor]], [[Bucky]], [[Toro (comics)|Toro]] and the [[Red Raven]], then they all teamed up to kill the [[Human Torch (android)|Simian Torch]]. He currentally leads the Ape-vengers and is planning to enter and decimate the home universe of Marty "The [[Gibbon (comics)|Gibbon]]" Blank, who he is also on a man hunt for.<ref>''[[Marvel Apes]]'' #3</ref>

==Baron Blood (Victor Strange)==
===Fictional character biography===
The sorcerer [[Doctor Strange]] once tried to resurrect his dead brother, Victor, with a spell from the [[Book of the Vishanti]]. Still inexperienced, Strange did not realize that this spell would later resurrect his brother as a vampire. Victor Strange was given the name and costume of Baron Blood by Marie Laveau, the voodoo sorceress, who had mystical control of him at the time.<ref>''Dr. Strange'' (vol. 3) #15</ref> Unlike most vampires in the Marvel Universe, Victor was able to control his bloodlust and retained most of his personality. He tried to become a hero by only attacking and drinking the blood of criminals, but his brother was forced to slay his victims who had come back to live as vampires. Victor continued his career as the costumed vigilante Khiron, but eventually realized how violent and bloodthirsty he had become and killed himself.<ref>''Dr. Strange'' (vol. 3) #56</ref>

==Baron Blood (Kenneth Crichton)==
===Fictional character biography===
Kenneth Crichton was next in line to take on the identity of Union Jack, but refused, stating that his friend Joey Chapman was better suited to be the new Union Jack. Joey agreed and became [[Union Jack (Joseph Chapman)|Union Jack III]]. Suffering from anemia and feeling estranged from Joey as Union Jack and his recently rejuvenated mother, [[Spitfire (comics)|Lady Crichton]], Kenneth became an easy target for Baroness Blood, who turned him into the new Baron Blood as a "cure" for his anemia. The Baroness used Kenneth and several other vampires to obtain the [[Holy Grail]], which gave her immunity to sunlight and the other traditional weaknesses vampires had, but she didn't want to share this power with other vampires and destroyed the Grail. The sun rose and Kenneth and the other vampires all died, despite Union Jack's efforts to save Kenneth.

Kenneth was one of the many vampires that returned after Blade had fulfilled an old prophecy.<ref>''Blade'' (vol. 3) #12</ref>
