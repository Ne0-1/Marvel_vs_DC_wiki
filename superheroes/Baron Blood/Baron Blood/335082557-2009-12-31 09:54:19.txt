'''Baron Blood''' is the name of several [[fictional character]]s that appear in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The original version first appears in ''[[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]]'' #7 (July 1976) and was created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Frank Robbins]]. The second character first appears in ''[[Doctor Strange]], Sorcerer Supreme'' vol. 3, #10 (Dec. 1989) and was created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Jackson Guice]]. The final version first appears in human guise in ''[[Captain America]]'' #253 (Jan. 1981), and was created by [[Roger Stern]] and [[John Byrne]].

==Publication history==
'''John Falsworth''' first appears in the title ''[[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]]'' as an [[England|English]] [[aristocrat]]. Although posing as the son of the first John Falsworth, it is revealed in [[flashback]] that the character is in fact the original, made possible due to the fact that he is now an ageless [[vampire]]. When the family fortune is left to older brother James, John Falsworth leaves England to pursue an interest - vampire lore. The character travels to [[Transylvania]] and encounters the original vampire [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]], who after overpowering Falsworth drains his [[blood]] and turns him into one of the [[undead]]. Dracula then commands Falsworth to return to England and cause havoc in revenge for the deeds of former opponent [[Jonathan Harker]]. Adopting the alias of ''Baron Blood'', the character allies with [[Germany]] during [[World War I]] and without either party guessing their identity battles his brother, who is now the English hero [[Union Jack (comics)|Union Jack]]. Blood is wounded by Jack with a silver dagger, and flees to recover.

The character reappears during [[World War II]] in his false persona, and once again aids Germany, with [[Nazi]] technology helping to reduce susceptibility to [[sunlight]] (a major vampire weakness). As Blood, Falsworth attacks and wounds his niece, Jacqueline Falsworth, but is driven off by the original [[Human Torch (android)|Human Torch]]. Almost dead due to blood loss, Jacqueline Falsworth is saved when given a [[blood transfusion]] by the Torch. The artificial blood causes the character to develop superhuman abilities, and she becomes the heroine ''[[Spitfire (comics)|Spitfire]]''. Blood captures Spitfire and takes her to a cavern below Falsworth Manor, where in a final battle with Union Jack he cripples the hero by dropping a boulder on his legs. The superhero team the ''Invaders'', however, arrive and defeat Blood, driving his body onto a silver-veined [[stalagmite]].<ref>''Invaders'' #7 (July 1976); #8 (Sep. 1976) #9 (Nov. 1976)</ref>

Baron Blood reappears when [[Japan|Japanese]] soldiers sent by the [[spy]] [[Lady Lotus]] find the cavern and attempt to [[resurrect]] the character. The soldiers are driven off by Union Jack (the identity having been adopted by James Falsworth's son, Brian) and Spitfire, although Blood is accidentally revived. Blood travels to the [[United States of America]] and after a brief skirmish with the Invaders joins the [[Nazi]] team the [[Super-Axis]] for a final battle with the heroes. Blood is killed once again when impaled on a stake thrown by ''[[Namor the Sub-Mariner]]''.<ref>''Invaders'' #39 - #40 (Apr. - May 1979); #41 (Aug. 1979)</ref> 

In the title ''Captain America'' a servant of Dracula, Dr. Jacob Cromwell, is sent to revive Blood, whose bones are stored in the [[Tower of London]]. Although Cromwell is successful, Blood betrays and kills him and one of his daughters, turning the other into a vampire (becoming ''[[Baroness Blood]]''). Assuming Cromwell's identity, Blood commits a series of murders that arouse the suspicions of his now very elderly brother James. The older Falsworth requests the aid of Captain America, who with the third version of [[Union Jack (Joseph Chapman)|Union Jack]] battles Blood. After being tricked into thinking that Union Jack was his older brother James, Blood is [[decapitated]] with Captain America's shield. The character's body is burned to ashes, with the ashes scattered.<ref>''Captain America'' #253 - 254 (Jan. - Feb. 1981)</ref>

Baron Blood reappears in an ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' annual, being revived briefly to become part of [[Elder of the Universe]] the [[Grandmaster]]'s [[Legion of the Unliving]],<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #16 (1987)</ref> and in a flashback story in a ''Namor: The Sub-Mariner'' annual briefly battles Namor over the affections of a female.<ref>''Namor: The Sub-Mariner'' #2 (Jan. 1992)</ref>

The storyline ''The [[Book of the Vishanti]]: Curse of the Darkhold'' in the title ''[[Doctor Strange]]: Sorcerer Supreme'' features a new version of the character.<ref>''Doctor Strange:Sorcerer Supreme #10 - 11 (Dec. 1989)</ref> When a still inexperienced Doctor Strange attempts to resurrect his dead brother Victor with a spell from the Book of the Vishanti, it revives the character as a vampire. Given the costume and name of ''Baron Blood'' by a [[voodoo]] sorceress, Victor Strange attempts to control his bloodlust, and becoming a costumed [[vigilante]] called ''Khiron'', attempts to only prey on criminals.<ref>''Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme'' #14 - 18 (Feb. - June 1990)</ref> The bloodlust, however, forces the character to kill innocents and he eventually commits [[suicide]].<ref>''Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme'' #56 (Aug. 1993)</ref>

The original Baron Blood is resurrected in the second volume of ''[[Knights of Pendragon]]'', before being killed by the third Union Jack;<ref>''Knights of Pendragon'' vol. 2, #10 - 11 (Apr. - May 1993)</ref> and in another flashback story in the third volume of ''Captain America'', feeding on [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] troops before capturing Captain America and [[Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos]]. Blood [[torture]]s Fury, but is driven off by another vampire - an Allied officer that Blood had turned - who exposes the area to sunlight at the cost of his own life.<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 3, #20 - 21 (Aug. - Sep. 1999)</ref>

The final version of Baron Blood features in the [[limited series]] ''Union Jack''. Kenneth Crichton, the son of Jacqueline Falsworth and a sufferer of the medical condition [[anemia]], is estranged from his family after refusing to adopt the identity of Union Jack, deeming his close friend Joey Chapman to be a better choice.<ref>Seen in ''Captain America'' #253 - 254 (Jan. - Feb. 1981)</ref> Crichton encounters Baroness Blood, who offers to cure his anemia. The character accepts and is turned into a vampire, becoming the new Baron Blood. Baroness Blood then directs Crichton to steal the [[Holy Grail]] from a [[museum]], and uses the [[magic item|artifact]] to become immune to all vampire weaknesses. The Baroness then betrays Crichton and her vampire servants, leaving them to die when exposed to sunlight.<ref>''Union Jack'' #1 - 3 (Dec. 1998 - Feb. 1999)</ref>

The original Baron Blood is apparently active again and features in the title ''[[Alias (comics)|Alias]]'' as a prisoner in the facility the ''[[Raft (comics)|Raft]]''.<ref>''Alias'' #26 (Nov. 2003)</ref>
 
===Powers and abilities===
The first Baron Blood possesses all the abilities of a [[vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampire]], including superhuman strength and durability; [[hypnotism]]; the ability to command [[mice]]; [[rat]]s; [[bat]]s and [[wolves]].

Set in an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]],  the limited series ''[[Marvel Apes]]'' depicts Earth's heroes as intelligent apes, with Blood posing as hero ''[[Captain America]]'' in the ''Ape-Vengers'' (a distorted version of the superhero team the ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]''). The villain is eventually opposed and defeated by the true Captain America.<ref>''Marvel Apes'' #0 (Jan. 2008); #1 - 2 (Nov. 2008); #3 - 4 (Dec. 2008)</ref>
