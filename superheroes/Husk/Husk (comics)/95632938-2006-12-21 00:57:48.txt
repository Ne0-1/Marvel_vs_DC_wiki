'''Husk''' ('''Paige Guthrie''') is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]] associated with the [[X-Men]].

A [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]], Husk has the ability to remove - or "husk” - one layer of skin revealing an [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] of a different composition beneath. She often changes into [[metal]] or [[Rock (geology)|stone]] form, but can [[shapeshifting|shift]] into a variety of substances.

Husk is from a [[Kentucky]] [[coal mining]] family and is the younger sister of the X-Men's [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]]. Unlike her brother, Husk is self-conscious of being seen as a "[[hick]]" (Jubilee often called her 'hayseed'). As a member of the X-Men's [[1990s]]-era junior team [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]], she established herself as an overachiever. She later joined the X-Men.

Husk was created by [[Fabian Nicieza]] and [[Tony Daniel]] but ''Generation X'' creators [[Scott Lobdell]] and [[Chris Bachalo]] defined much of her character and abilities.

==Character biography==
The sister of the X-Man [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]], Paige Guthrie was born to a large [[Kentucky]] coal miner's family.  As a teenager, she discovered her inborn [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] ability to shed her [[skin]], [[Metamorphosis|metamorphosing]] into a different composition beneath.  She has used this power to turn her body into [[rock (geology)|stone]], [[glass]] and an [[acid]]-like substance, among other materials.  She can also use her power to heal herself by shedding a damaged form in favor of an intact one.  She normally cannot change the shape of her form, only its composition, although an issue of ''[[X-Force]]'', written before her powers had been fully defined, depicted her transforming into a [[bird]].

From the series' beginning in 1994 until its cancellation at issue #75 in 2001, Husk was a member of the junior X-Men team Generation X, where she earned a reputation as a workaholic, constantly trying to prove herself fit for the main team.  She also developed a troubled relationship with her antisocial teammate [[Chamber (comics)|Chamber]].  Towards the end of the team's existence, Paige became the group's computer expert and developed an interest in environmental issues.

After the break-up of Generation X, Husk joined Banshee's militant X-Corps to keep an eye on him.  She later joined the X-Men in [[Chuck Austen]]'s 2001 revamp of ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' and was placed in a controversial relationship with the long-time X-Man [[Archangel (comics)|Archangel]], Husk being 19 years old and roughly 10 years Archangel's junior.

The two took an extended leave of absence.  Archangel launched a charity called "Mutantes Sans Frontières" in Zanzibar, a reference to [[Médecins Sans Frontières]] ("Doctors Without Borders"), where the two proceeded to help stop a coup with the aid of Professor X's newest charges from nearby [[Genosha]].

Her younger brother Josh later joined the new [[New Mutants]] team under the codename [[Icarus (comics)|Icarus]]. Her sister Melody also joined the school as Aero after discovering she could fly, but has since been depowered by [[House of M]], although Paige herself retains her powers.  Icarus later was killed following the events of M-Day, though how Paige has taken his death, has not been shown.

It is unknown what the future will have next in store for Paige Guthrie, but for now she seems to have put the X-Men behind her.  She is enjoying being in a happy relationship with Warren though she is not above some occasional jealousy. She is also not a full member of any X-Men team, and she has been reduced to just a few guest-appearances here and there. She is most often seen in the current New X-Men title while tending to the wounded.

==Alternate versions==
[[Image:Xmen AOApokalipse FinalVersion by martegodpopo.jpg|thumb|right|60%|Paige's AoA look]]
In the [[Age of Apocalypse]], Paige was a member of '''Generation Next'''. Husk was found by [[Mister Sinister|Sinister]] along with her sister, Elizabeth, and brother, Sam, while the rest of their family (save for their brother Joshua) were culled by Apocalypse's Infinites. However, unlike Sam and Elizabeth, Paige declined Sinister's offer to join his Elite Mutant Force. Instead she joined [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]'s cause. Like her [[Earth-616|main Marvel Universe]] counterpart, Paige had a relationship with Chamber, though in this case the relationship became physical as well. She also had greater control over her abilities, as she was able to transform only parts of her body, and even capable of adopting liquid and gaseous states.

Paige was believed dead alongside the rest of the Generation Next members. However, she was enslaved by [[Sugar Man]] at the Seattle Core for a long time, until Apocalypse's [[regime]] fully collapsed. Feeling betrayed by the X-Men, Husk gathered her siblings and assumed the identity of [[Xorn]] to infiltrate the X-Men. Husk kidnapped Magneto and Rogue's son Charles and battled the X-Men alongside the other Guthries, but was ultimately killed.

==Powers==
Transitional bodimorph able to shed the outer layers of her flesh at will, revealing a new skin underneath formed of different materials such as rubber, glass, diamond, and various forms of metal, or to achieve metabolic changes in her template form, such as removing caked up dirt and grime or shedding wounded layers of tissue.
