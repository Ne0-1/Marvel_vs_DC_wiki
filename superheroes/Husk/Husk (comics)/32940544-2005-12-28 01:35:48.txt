'''Husk''' is a [[comic book]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  She has been a member of [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]] and the [[X-Men]].  She first appeared in ''[[X-Force]]'' #32 (1993) and was first called Husk in ''X-Men'' (volume 2) #37 (1994).

==Character biography==
The sister of the X-Man [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]], Paige Guthrie was born to a large [[Kentucky]] coal miner's family.  As a teenager, she discovered her inborn [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] ability to shed her [[skin]], [[metamorphosis|metamorphosing]] into a different composition beneath.  She has used this power to turn her body into [[rock (geology)|stone]], [[glass]] and an [[acid]]-like substance, among other materials.  She can also use her power to heal herself by shedding a damaged form in favor of an intact one.  She normally cannot change the shape of her form, only its composition, although an issue of ''[[X-Force]]'', written before her powers had been fully defined, depicted her transforming into a [[bird]].

From the series' beginning in 1994 until its cancellation at issue #75 in 2001, Husk was a member of the junior X-Men team Generation X, where she earned a reputation as a workaholic, constantly trying to prove herself fit for the main team.  She also developed a troubled relationship with her antisocial teammate [[Chamber (comics)|Chamber]].  Towards the end of the team's existence, Paige became the group's computer expert and developed an interest in environmental issues.

After the break-up of Generation X, Husk joined Banshee's militant X-Corps to keep an eye on him.  She later joined the X-Men in [[Chuck Austen]]'s 2001 revamp of ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' and was placed in a controversial relationship with the long-time X-Man [[Archangel (comics)|Archangel]].  Husk being 19 years old and roughly 10 years Archangel's junior. 

The two took an extended leave of absence.  Archangel launched a charity called "Mutantes Sans Fronti√®res" in Zanzibar, an oblique reference to [[Doctors Without Borders]], where the two proceeded to help stop a coup with the aid of Professor X's newest charges from nearby [[Genosha]].

Her younger brother Josh later joined the new [[New Mutants]] team under the codename [[Icarus (comics)|Icarus]]. Her sister Melody also joined the school as Aero after discovering she could fly. She has since been depowered by [[House of M]].
