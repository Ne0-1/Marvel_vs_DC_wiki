'''Husk''' ('''Paige Guthrie''') is a fictional character from [[Marvel Comics]].  Guthrie is a [[superhero]] associated with the [[X-Men]].

A [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], Husk has the ability to remove one layer of skin - or "husk" - revealing an [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] of a different composition beneath. She often changes into [[metal]] or [[Rock (geology)|stone]] form, but can [[shapeshifting|shift]] into a variety of substances.

Husk is from a [[Kentucky]] [[coal mining]] family and is the younger sister of the X-Men's [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]]. Unlike her brother, Husk is self-conscious of being seen as a "[[yokel|hick]]" ([[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] often called her 'hayseed'). As a member of the X-Men's 1990s-era junior team [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]], she established herself as an overachiever. She later joined the X-Men.

==Publication history==

Husk first made appearances as a background character and one of Cannonball's many siblings in Rom Annual #3 (1984) by [[Bill Mantlo]] and William Johnson and New Mutants vol. 1 #42 (1986) by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Jackson Guice]]. She was revealed as a mutant and her personality was developed by [[Fabian Nicienza]] and [[Tony Daniel]] in X-Force vol. 1 #32 (1994) as part of that title's ''Child's Play'' crossover with [[New Warriors]], which segued into her participation in the ''Generation Next'' arc of the ''[[Phalanx Covenant]]'', running through X-Men vol. 2 #36-37 (1994) and Uncanny X-Men vol. 1 #317 (1994).

Husk would then become a permanent member of Generation X (1994-2001), originally created by [[Scott Lobdell]] and [[Chris Bachalo]].  This run would be responsible for defining and expanding her personality and mutant abilities.  After Generation X disbanded, Husk served as a member of the X-Men in Uncanny X-Men vol. 1 #414-443 (2002-2004), thereafter appearing sporadically as a reserve member and background character in various X-titles, highlighted by a mission during the ''Necrosha'' event in X-Men: Legacy vol. 1 #231-233 (2010). 

During the X-Men's ''Schism'', Husk joined Cannonball and threw in with Wolverine's side in X-Men: Regenesis #1, becoming a faculty member at the Jean Grey School in Westchester. Husk currently appears regularly as a supporting character in ''Wolverine and the X-Men'' (2012) from issue #2 onward.

==Fictional character biography==
The sister of the X-Man [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]], Paige Guthrie was born to a large [[Kentucky]] coal miner's family. Her father died when she was very young, due to a lung affliction  from working in the mines. As a teenager, she discovers her inborn [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] ability to shed her [[skin]], [[Metamorphosis|metamorphosing]] into a different composition beneath.  She has used this power to turn her body into [[rock (geology)|stone]], [[glass]], and an [[acid]]-like substance, among other materials. She can also use her power to heal herself by shedding a damaged form in favor of an intact one. She normally cannot change the shape of her form, only its composition, although an issue of ''[[X-Force]]'', written before her powers had been fully defined, depicted her transforming into a [[bird]].

===Generation X===
From the series' beginning in 1994 until its cancellation at issue #75 in 2001, Husk was a member of the junior X-Men team Generation X, where she earned a reputation as a workaholic, constantly trying to prove herself fit for the main team.  She also develops a troubled relationship with her antisocial teammate [[Chamber (comics)|Chamber]].  Towards the end of the team's existence, Paige became the group's computer expert and develops an interest in environmental issues.{{Issue|date=April 2011}}

After the breakup of Generation X, Husk joins [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]]'s militant X-Corps, along with other Gen X members, in order to keep an eye on him. This does not end well, with Banshee's more criminal charges staging a [[Coup d'état|coup]] and the Gen X members having to take down the [[Blob (comics)|Blob]].{{Issue|date=April 2011}}

===X-Men===
She later joined the X-Men in [[Chuck Austen]]'s 2001 revamp of ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' and was placed in a controversial relationship with the long-time X-Man [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]], as Husk was 19 years old and several years Archangel's junior.{{Issue|date=April 2011}}

The two took an extended leave of absence.  Archangel launched a charity called "Mutantes Sans Frontières" in Zanzibar, a reference to [[Médecins Sans Frontières]] ("Doctors Without Borders"), where the two proceeded to help stop a coup with the aid of [[Professor X]]'s newest charges from nearby [[Genosha]].<ref>''Excalibur'' vol. 3 #12</ref>

Her younger brother Jay later joined the new [[New Mutants]] team under the codename [[Icarus (comics)|Icarus]]. Her sister Melody also joined the school as [[Aero (comics)|Aero]] after discovering she could fly. Aero has since been depowered after [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], although Paige herself retains her powers.  Icarus was later killed following the events of M-Day, in a confrontation with the anti-mutant activisit [[William Stryker]] and his army. The resulting battles also take the lives of dozens of other students.{{Issue|date=April 2011}}

She is most often seen in the current [[New X-Men]] title while tending to the wounded.  In her last major appearance, she attended the funeral of her little brother.{{Issue|date=April 2011}}

===Divided We Stand===
The first issue of Divided We Stand revealed that Paige had returned to living with her family. She is the one who picks up her brother, Cannonball, at the airport to bring him home. However, Sam, still feeling angry over the betrayal of his X-Men team, tells her to take him to a local bar, where he picks a fight with the members of rival families from their home. Paige confronts Sam on his action after the brawl ends. Sam yells his lost faith in how the life of an X-Men works and flies off angry, leaving Paige fearful for his life and mind.{{Issue|date=April 2011}}

===Secret Invasion===
Husk is seen fighting alongside the rest of the X-Men in San Francisco and flirting with Angel at the same time, though it would appear they are no longer a couple.{{Issue|date=April 2011}}

===Nation X / Necrosha===
Paige is currently a resident of the mutant nation of Utopia and is seen fighting alongside the New X-Men battling her reanimated former teammates [[Synch (comics)|Synch]] and [[Skin (comics)|Skin]].<ref>''X-Force'' vol. 3 #22</ref> Paige is subsequently sent to Muir Island with a team of X-Men led by Nightcrawler to further investigate the attacks on Utopia.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #231</ref> When the team reaches Muir Island, they discover something came back when Destiny was resurrected - the villain Proteus. Proteus takes swift action, dispatching the teams heavy-hitters Colossus and Magneto and possessing [[Trance (comics)|Trance]], [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], [[Psylocke]] and Husk. While in mental possession of Husk, he displays the ability to assume a flaming energy form, something Paige was previously unable to do. Whether this is an undiscovered latent power of Paige's or an aspect of Proteus's reality manipulation remains unknown.{{Issue|date=April 2011}}

===Second Coming===
Paige was seen fighting a Nimrod with Roberto DaCosta, Avalanche and Boom-Boom and then again after the Nimrods were depowered (due to Cypher). She asked Colossus what happened and he replied, "I don't know, Paige."{{Issue|date=April 2011}}

===Schism===
Following the conflict between [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] and [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] that led to the former abandoning [[Utopia]], Husk became a teacher at the [[Jean Grey School for Higher Learning]].<ref>''Wolverine & The X-Men'' #1</ref> At a faculty meeting, Paige tries to express her insecurity about not being cut out for teaching because the students aren't listening to her. Ironically, Beast cuts her off before she can finish. Later, Cannonball expresses his frustration about there only being a memorial for dead X-Men, including their brother Jay, in the faculty lounge and that he doesn't understand how Paige agrees with this decision when she can't even look at Jay's picture. Casting off Sam's feelings, Paige announces she has class and needs to change. In reply to this, Sam states that she sheds her skin every time she's unhappy and her power isn't an antidepressant. At that moment, the school is attacked, and Paige is instructed to go teach as normal. During her class, Rogue interrupts and informs Paige that there is a problem with the "heating system." Upon leaving the class, Paige instantly husks into her fire form and destroys the invading N'Garai in the mansion. During Paige's time at the school, it becomes apparent that her mysterious molting condition is only worsening because her skin is in a state of constant cracking and flaking.

===Leaving the X-Men===
Over time, Paige's condition worsens as she starts leaving around Husk replicas with her old skin (replicas that Toad, in love with her, keeps to himself and even uses in his tea parties). During the events of ''[[Avengers vs. X-Men]]'', she starts a sentimental relationship with him.<ref>''Wolverine & The X-Men'' #9 and 15</ref> Her mental condition grows worse too, and she doesn't even acknowledge a riot in one of her classes. After that, Kitty Pryde states that Paige is in no condition to teach and suggests removing her from the active staff. In a burst of fury, Paige decides to quit the school, considering Kitty was about to fire her. Then, Paige decides to take some time for herself, leaving the school and telling Toad she will eventually come back. She even assures him she is in no need of psychiatric help.<ref>''Wolverine & The X-Men'' #18</ref>

As part of the ''[[Marvel NOW!]]'' event, a now-disfigured Husk is revealed to be one of the agents of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]'s new Hellfire Academy.<ref>''Wolverine and the X-Men'' #30</ref>

When Toad helps Quentin Quire to escape the Hellfire Academy, Husk and the other students try to stop them. Husk attacks Toad and strangles him, when he starts ripping off layer after layer of her skin until a normal looking Paige appears under all the husks. She doesn't seem to have any memory of what happened in recent times, no knowledge of having left the X-Men and apparently also no memory of entering a relationship with Toad.<ref>''Wolverine and the X-Men'' #35</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Paige is a metamorph who has the mutant ability to change her physical form by shedding her outer layer of skin to reveal a new layer or shape underneath.  While she can sometimes acquire new forms, Paige most commonly takes on a Paige-like form in a new material.  She can become any solid that she has studied (including [[adamantium]], [[diamond]], [[granite]], [[wood]], [[rubber]], [[brick]], and even [[glass]]).  These forms take on new physical abilities or qualities appropriate to the form, such as increased weight, strength, or invulnerability.  Paige has shown some ability to take on forms with energy powers - including a fiery form that generates heat and flame, and a form with acidic skin.

Husk has been able to shift into anything that does not exceed her body mass. Any extra [[mass]] left when she shifts into a smaller form such as an insect or a bird is shunted into an unknown extra-dimensional space, and will return to Husk when she resumes her human form. However, she has also demonstrated an ability to take on extra mass and become heavier.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #440</ref>  She has the capability to blend in with surroundings, but in order to do so, she would have to study the texture she seeks to mimic first.  She can husk away minor injuries, but deeper ones will stay with her. She can hold a form for about an hour before she needs to revert to her original form. She can morph repeatedly. She is not required to stay in any one form, but too many transformations can become very painful. In great stress or trauma, Paige can shed without control, revealing patchwork forms. When Paige ‘husks’, she sheds her clothing as well. This has the somewhat unfortunate side effect of leaving her nude when she returns to her normal form.

==Other versions==

===Age of Apocalypse===
[[Image:Xmen AOApokalipse FinalVersion by martegodpopo.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Paige's AoA look]]
In the [[Age of Apocalypse]], Paige was a member of '''Generation Next'''. Husk was found by [[Mister Sinister|Sinister]] along with her older sister Elizabeth and her older brother [[Cannonball (comics)|Samuel]] while the rest of their family, save for their youngest brother [[Icarus (comics)|Joshua]], were culled by Apocalypse's Infinites. However, unlike Sam and Elizabeth, Paige declined Sinister's offer to join his Elite Mutant Force. Instead she joined [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]'s cause. Like her [[Earth-616|main Marvel Universe]] counterpart, Paige had a long-term relationship with Chamber, though in this case the relationship became physical as well.

In this universe, Paige demonstrated greater control over her abilities compared to her primary-universe counterpart.  She was able to transform all parts of her body, and was capable of adopting liquid, gaseous, and energy states.  Paige could also adapt specific "bio patterns" to affect specific individuals, including a complex acid that could affect the organic steel skin of [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] and an energy form [[Alternative_versions_of_Kitty_Pryde#Age_of_Apocalypse|Shadowcat]] could not phase through.<ref name="GENNEX1">''Generation Next'' #1</ref>  She also had the ability to change only part of her body (such as changing a hand into a bladed weapon).

After being overrun deep in hostile territory, Paige and her Generation Next fleet team members were believed to be dead.  However, Paige survived the battle and was enslaved by the inmates of the Seattle Core until Apocalypse's [[regime]] fully collapsed. Husk was eventually found by her siblings and was taken to Sinister, who brainwashed her and made her want revenge for the X-Men leaving her behind. Husk infiltrated the ranks of the X-Men as a mutant named [[Xorn]] and kidnapped Charles Lensherr; she even battled alongside the other Guthries, but was ultimately killed by Wolverine's daughter, [[X-23#Age of Apocalypse|Kirika]].{{Issue|date=April 2011}}

===Age of X===
In the [[Age of X]] reality Paige is seen breaking free of mutant hunters killing many of them and later meeting up with her brother, Sam. They both find their entire family dead because of the mutant hunters. She swears vengeance on the humans who did this.<ref>''Age of X: Alpha''</ref>

===Mutant X===
Paige is a member of the Marauders and constantly fighting with her brother, Cannonball. She is stuck in a rather grotesque form and was last seen trying to escape the group's mysterious benefactor.<ref>''Mutant X'' #26-27 (December 1818)</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] reality, Paige Guthrie is a fourteen-year-old mutant living in the Southwest, which is overrun by Sentinels. She meets [[Kitty Pryde]] and her X-Men, and leads them to [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]].<ref>''Ultimate Comics: X-Men'' #16</ref>

==In other media==
