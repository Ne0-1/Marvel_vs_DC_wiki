'''Magneto''' (born '''Max Eisenhardt''', also known as '''Magnus''' and '''Erik Lehnsherr''') is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appears in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' #1 ([[1963#September|Sept. 1963]]), and was created by [[writer]] [[Stan Lee]] and [[artist]] [[Jack Kirby]]. A powerful [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with the ability to  generate and control electromagnetic forces, Magneto has been the X-Men's most prominent enemy ever since his first appearance. In his early appearances, his motives were bent on [[megalomania]], but writers have since fleshed out his character and origin, revealing him to be a [[Jew]]ish [[the Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivor whose actions are driven by the purpose of protecting the mutant race from suffering a similar fate. His role in comics have varied from [[supervillain]] to [[anti-hero]] to even [[superhero|hero]].

Sir [[Ian McKellen]] portrayed Magneto throughout the entire [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]]. He was ranked number 1 by [[IGN]]'s Top 100 Comic Book Villains list<ref>IGN.com, Top 100 Comic Book Villains, [http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/1.html "Magneto is Number 1"]</ref>, was listed number 17 in ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard's]]'' Top 100 Greatest Villains Ever list<ref>''Wizard'', #177, July 2006</ref>, and was ranked as the 9th Greatest Comic Book Character Ever in ''Wizard'''s list of the 200 Greatest Comic Book Characters of All Time, the second highest villain on that list.<ref>Wizarduniverse.com, [http://www.wizarduniverse.com/05240810thgreatestcharacters2.html "The 200 Greatest Comic Characters of All Time"], Numbers 20 Through 1, 2008-05-23</ref>

==Publication history==
{{Expand|section|date=September 2008}}
[[Image:Magnetodebut.png‎|thumb|left|170px|Magneto's first appearance in ''X-Men'' #1 (Sept. 1963).<br />Written by [[Stan Lee]] & art by [[Jack Kirby]].]]Magneto first appeared in the debut issue of ''X-Men'' in 1963, along with the titular team. Through the decades from the 1960s, Magneto has appeared in several issues of the original X-Men series, generally known as ''Uncanny X-Men'', as well as in such spin-offs as ''X-Men'', ''[[Astonishing X-Men]]'', ''[[Alpha Flight]]'', ''[[Cable (comics)|Cable]]'', ''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'', and ''[[The New Mutants]]''; many X-Men [[miniseries]], and several other Marvel titles. His first solo title was a [[one shot (comic)|one-shot]] special, ''Magneto: The Twisting of a Soul'' #0 (Sept. 1993), published when the character returned from a brief absence; it reprinted Magneto-based stories from ''Classic X-Men'' #12 & 19 (Aug. 1987 & March 1988), by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[John Bolton (comic book artist)|John Bolton]].

In a 2008 interview, Stan Lee elaborated that he "did not think of Magneto as a bad guy. He just wanted to strike back at the people who were so bigoted and racist... he was trying to defend the mutants, and because society was not treating them fairly he was going to teach society a lesson. He was a danger of course... but I never thought of him as a villain."<ref name="celeb57">''Marvel Spotlight: Uncanny X-Men 500 Issues Celebration'', p. 5-7</ref> In the same interview, he also revealed that he originally planned Magneto to be the brother of his archnemesis [[Professor X]].<ref name="celeb57"/>

Magneto's first original title was the four-issue miniseries ''Magneto'' (Nov. 1996 - Feb. 1997), by writers [[Peter Milligan]] & [[Jorge Gonzalez]], and penciller [[Kelley Jones]]. The miniseries took place during a period where it was believed Magneto had been de-aged and was suffering from amnesia, calling himself [[Joseph (comics)|Joseph]]; it was later revealed that Joseph was a younger clone of Magneto. Later, Magneto became ruler of the nation [[Genosha]]. During this period, he received two miniseries; ''Magneto Rex'' (written by Joe Pruett and drawn by Brandon Peterson) and ''Magneto: Dark Seduction'' (written by Fabian Nicieza and drawn by Roger Cruz).
A trade paperback novel detailing Magneto's childhood, titled ''X-Men: Magneto Testament'', was released in September 2008, and written by [[Greg Pak]]. Magneto Testament, which Pak based on accounts from [[Holocaust survivors]], watched documentaries, and read comics such as ''[[Maus]]'', finally confirms and clarifies into the Marvel Comics canon, Magneto's personal history and background. Before the publication of ''X-Men: Magneto Testament'', Magneto's personal background and history was <ref>{{cite news | author = Mordechai Shinefield | title = X-Men mutant survives the Holocaust in new Marvel Comics miniseries | work = [[Haaretz]] | date = 2008-06-07 | url = http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/990901.html | accessdate=2008-06-09}}</ref> established in ''Uncanny X-Men'' vol. 1, #150 (August 1981) as him being a Jewish Holocaust survivor, while he was searching for his wife Magda, a Sinti Gypsy, Magneto maintained a cover identity as a [[Sinti|Sinti Gypsy]].<ref name="xmen72">''X-Men'' vol. 2 #72</ref> This created confusion amongst some readers, as to his heritage,<ref name="RA">[http://www.adherents.com/lit/comics/Magneto.html ''The Religious Affiliation of Comic Book Character Erik Magnus Lehnsherr — Magneto''].

==Fictional character biography==
[[Image:magnetoholoc.png|185px|(Left) Max and Magda escape from the [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]] [[death camp]]; (Right) Erik and Magda with their daughter Anya. Art by [[John Byrne]].|thumb|left]]

Magneto was born '''Max Eisenhardt''' sometime in the late 1920s to a middle class [[German Jewish]] family whose father, Jakob Eisenhardt was a highly decorated [[World War I]] veteran.<ref name="testament1">X-Men: Magneto Testament #1</ref> Surviving discrimination and hardship during the [[Nazism|Nazi rise to power]], [[Kristallnacht]], and the passing of the [[Nuremberg Laws]], in 1939 Max and his family fled to Poland where they were captured during the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|German invasion of Poland]] and sent to the [[Warsaw Ghetto]].<ref name="testament1"/><ref name="classicxmen12">''Classic X-Men'' #12</ref> Max and his family escape the Ghetto, only to be betrayed and captured again. His Mother, Father, and Sister were executed and buried in a mass grave, but Max survived possibly due to the manifestation of his powers. Escaping from the mass grave, he is ultimately captured yet again <ref name="mutants1">New Mutants #49</ref> and sent to [[Auschwitz]], where he eventually becomes a [[Sonderkommando]].<ref name="mutants1"/><ref>Uncanny X-Men #274</ref><ref>Excalibur vol.3 #14</ref> While at Auschwitz, Eisenhardt reunites with a [[Roma (Romani subgroup)|Roma]] girl named Magda, with whom he had fallen in love when he was younger, and with whom he escapes the prison camp during the [[Auschwitz_concentration_camp#Birkenau_revolt|October 7th 1944 revolt]]. Following the war, he and Magda move to the Ukrainian city of [[Vinnytsia]], and adopts the name "'''Magnus'''". Magda and Magnus have a daughter named Anya, and live uneventfully until one night when a angry mob burned their home down with Anya still inside.  Enraged at the mob preventing him from rescuing Anya, the young Magneto's powers manifest uncontrollably, killing the mob and destroying a part of the city. Magda, terrified at Magneto's power, leaves him and later dies giving birth to the mutant twins [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and the [[Scarlet Witch]]. Wanted by the authorities for the deaths and destruction in Vinnytsia, while searching for Magda, Magnus paid a Romanian forger George Odekirk, to create the cover identity of "Erik Lehnsherr the Sinte gypsy" for him.<ref name="xmen72">''X-Men'' vol. 2 #72</ref>

"Erik", relocated to Israel, where he met and befriended [[Charles Xavier]] while working at a psychiatric hospital near [[Haifa]].<ref name="uncanny1">''Uncanny X-Men'' #161, September 1981</ref> There, lengthy debates are held by the two regarding the consequences humanity faces with the rise of mutants, though neither reveals to the other that they both in fact possessed mutant powers. However, they are forced to reveal their inherent abilities to one another, while facing [[Baron Von Strucker]] and [[HYDRA (comics)|HYDRA]]. Following the battle, Erik (now dressed as Magneto) leaves, realizing that his and Xavier's views are incompatible, with a cache of hidden Nazi gold, which provided him with the financing to launch his goals.

===Rise of Magneto===
[[Image:Xavmags.png|frame|Magneto and Xavier would eventually part ways because of the differences in their beliefs on how to help mutants. Art by [[Carlos Pacheco]].]]
Magneto's experiences surviving Nazi Germany, Auschwitz, and Vinnytsia would shape his outlook on the situation that mutants face in the [[Marvel Universe]]. Determined to keep such atrocities from ever being committed against mutant-kind, he is willing to use deadly force to protect mutants. He would believe that mutants ("''Homo superior''") will become the dominant life form on the planet and would set about either creating a homeland on Earth where mutants could live peacefully, or conquering and enslaving humanity in the name of mutantkind.

Magneto's first villainous act was attacking a United States military base called Cape Citadel. He was defeated by Charles Xavier's mutant students, the [[X-Men]].<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 1 #1</ref> He creates [[Asteroid M]], an orbital base of operations in an hollowed out asteroid that he wanted it to be a homeland for all mutant kind. He then gathers a group of angry and disenfranchised mutants, including, his own, albeit at the time unbeknown to him, son and daughter Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch and forms the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] to further his goals. Magneto briefly conquers the fictional South American nation of San Marco in the hopes of establishing a mutant homeland there, but is once again foiled by the X-Men.<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 1 #4</ref> 

Constant defeat of him and the Brotherhood by the X-Men led to him to get ultimately captured by the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]]. A powerful alien being, the Stranger encases Magneto in a special cocoon and spirits him away to another planet, the Stranger's laboratory world. While back on Earth, Magneto's Brotherhood splinters, and Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch desert him.<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 1 #11</ref> Magneto escaped to Earth and battled the X-Men, but was then recaptured by the Stranger.<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 1 #17-18</ref> Magneto remains on the Stranger's world for a long time. Magneto eventually escapes again, makes his way back to Earth, and re-assembles the Brotherhood of Evil mutants with the exception of the mutant [[Mastermind]].<ref>''Avengers'' #47-49</ref> He then captures the X-Men, but with the help of the [[Avengers]] and a rebellious member of the Brotherhood, [[Toad]], Magneto is defeated again.

Magneto then created the [[Savage Land Mutates]]. With the Savage Land Mutates, he clashed with the X-Men and [[Ka-Zar#Ka-Zar (Kevin Plunder)|Ka-Zar]].<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 1 #62-63</ref> With Namor, Magneto later attacked New York City.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #102-104</ref> He later fought the [[Inhumans]] Royal Family.<ref>''Amazing Adventures'' #9-10</ref> He later battled the Avengers once more.<ref>''Avengers'' #110-111</ref>

Magneto later reorganized the Brotherhood, and fought Professor X and the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. Using ancient and advanced alien technology he finds near the core of the earth, Magneto creates an artificial humanoid he names "[[Alpha the Ultimate Mutant]]." Alpha rebels against his creator and reduces Magneto to infancy.<ref>''Defenders'' #15-16</ref> Magneto is then placed in the care of Xavier's former love interest, Professor [[Moira MacTaggert]] at [[Muir Island]]. At Muir Island, MacTaggert manipulates the infant Magneto's genetic code in an attempt to prevent him from becoming "evil" in adulthood. However, her genetic tampering loses its effect when Magneto re-activates his powers again. Magneto is eventually restored to adulthood when he is found at Muir Island by the alien [[Shi'ar]] agent [[Erik the Red (comics)|Erik the Red]].<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 1 #104</ref>

Magneto later gathered a new [[Resistants (comics)|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], and with them battled [[Captain America]].<ref>''Captain America'' #4</ref> He then opposed [[Doctor Doom]]'s conquest of Earth.<ref>''Super-Villain Team-Up'' #14; ''Champions'' #16</ref>

===Redemption===
{{Refimprove|section|date=January 2009}}
[[Image:uncanny200.png|thumb|Magneto goes on trial for his crimes in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #200. Art by [[John Romita Jr]].|left|220px]]

Magneto later discovers that former Brotherhood members the [[Scarlet Witch]] and [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] are actually his children, simultaneously learning about their recent marriages to the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] and [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]]. He revealed to Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch that he is their father.<ref>''Vision and the Scarlet Witch'' Vol. 1 #4</ref> He also discovers his granddaughter, Quicksilver's human child [[Luna Maximoff]].{{Issue|date=June 2009}} Seeing Luna as a bond to the human race he has rejected, Magneto tries to reach out to his children. Angered by his rejection of them and their mother, they push him away and refuse to forgive him.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}

Magneto finds himself allied with Professor Xavier and the X-Men when a group of heroes and villains are abducted by the [[Beyonder]], a nearly omnipotent alien being. This entity takes them to a planet he creates called the Battleworld to participate in a personal experiment of his to observe the concept of the battle between good and evil which would be later known as the [[Secret Wars]]. The characters are sorted according to their desires, as Magneto was placed with the heroes as his desires were based on a wish to help mutants rather than the more selfish drives of the others. This surprises many of the other heroes, who still believe he is a villain, although they mostly come to accept him as an ally. [[Captain America]] even spoke in his defense on some occasions, and the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] develops a certain affection for him, although it is tempered by her knowledge of his past.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}

After the Secret Wars are over, Magneto is transported back to his base, Asteroid M, where the alien [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Warlock]], traveling to Earth, collides into the asteroid, breaking it to pieces. Magneto is sent falling towards Earth and into the Atlantic Ocean, sustaining serious injuries. He is rescued by [[Lee Forrester]], the captain of a fishing trawler.{{Issue|date=June 2009}} Lee helps him recuperate from his injuries and the two share a small romance.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}

After recuperating from his injuries, Magneto is asked to aid the X-Men in battling the returned Beyonder,{{Issue|date=June 2009}} and Magneto stays with the X-Men even after the Beyonder is defeated.{{Issue|date=June 2009}} His association with the team softens his views on humanity and Magneto surrenders himself to the law to stand trial for his crimes. A special tribunal is organized. They choose to strike all charges against Magneto from prior to his "rebirth," deeming that this had constituted a figurative death of the old Magneto. However, the tribunal is interrupted by an attack from [[Fenris (comics)|Fenris]], the twin children of [[Baron Strucker|Baron Wolfgang von Strucker]]. Fenris is defeated but [[Professor X]] is brought to near-death due to the strain of the battle and previously sustained injuries. Xavier asks Magneto to take over his school and the X-Men, and tells him that doing so would make amends enough for his past crimes. Magneto agrees and chooses not to return to the courtroom. Instead he takes over Xavier's school under the assumed identity of Michael Xavier, Charles Xavier's cousin.{{Issue|date=June 2009}} Seeing him try to reform, the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver begin accepting him as their father.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}

Though Magneto makes a substantial effort as the headmaster to the [[New Mutants]] and an ally to the X-Men, his tenure is disastrous. The [[Beyonder]] plagues him yet again, slaying Xavier's current students, the New Mutants,{{Issue|date=June 2009}} and bringing them back to life soon later.{{Issue|date=June 2009}} This deeply traumatizes the entire group.{{Issue|date=June 2009}} He is manipulated by Emma Frost, headmistress of her own school, the Massachusetts Academy, and [[Emma Frost|White Queen]] of the Hellfire Club, into battling sanctioned heroes the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and the [[Supreme Soviets]].{{Issue|date=June 2009}} Magneto submits to a trial once again, but uses mind-control circuitry he salvages from the wreckage of Asteroid M to alter the opinions of the head justice in charge of the trial. As a result, he is finally absolved of his past crimes but finds that this has only fueled the hostility that normal humans have towards mutants.{{Issue|date=June 2009}} Feeling that desperate measures needed to be taken after the genocidal massacre in the Morlock tunnels, Magneto and Storm join the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] jointly as the White King.{{Issue|date=June 2009}} He is unable to prevent his students [[Sunspot (comics)|Roberto da Costa]] and the alien [[Technarchy|Technarch]] [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Warlock]] from running away from the school,{{Issue|date=June 2009}} or prevent the death of the young mutant student [[Cypher (comics)|Douglas Ramsey]] after the students sneak away yet again to save a friend,{{Issue|date=June 2009}} and witnesses the apparent death of all of the senior X-Men on national television.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}

His relationship with the New Mutants deteriorates even further when they see him and the Club work with the demons of the ''[[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]]'' incident.{{Issue|date=June 2009}} Magneto later ousts longtime Hellfire Club co-chair [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]] in order to establish himself as the head of the Hellfire Club as the Grey King. During this confrontation he reveals his real purpose of raising an army for the coming war between humans and mutants.{{Issue|date=June 2009}} The New Mutants do not return to Magneto's tutelage.

Seeing conditions for mutants grow progressively more perilous, Magneto began seeking allies to protect mutants from humanity. He participates in the "[[Acts of Vengeance]]" alongside such established villains as [[Doctor Doom]], the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]], the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]], and the [[Red Skull]].{{Issue|date=June 2009}}  His temporary alliance with the Skull—an unrepentant Nazi war criminal—is a highly uneasy one.  After confirming that the Skull was the original one who had worked with Hitler, Magneto takes revenge upon him by entombing him alive.{{Issue|date=June 2009}} He also attacks (and is defeated by) a cosmically powered Spider-Man.{{Issue|date=June 2009}} He works alongside Rogue, [[Ka-zar]] and the American intelligence agent [[Nick Fury]] as well as a number of Russian operatives in order to re-establish peace in the [[Savage Land]].{{Issue|date=June 2009}} This ultimately led to an altercation with [[Zaladane]], who had appropriated the magnetic powers of his then-unknown daughter, [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]]. The conflict ended with Magneto executing Zaladane himself. With her death, he renounced his previous efforts to act as a mentor to the New Mutants and to follow Xavier's beliefs in peaceful co-existence between mutants and normal humans.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #275</ref>

===Avalon and Genosha===
Tired of the constant state of strife, Magneto set his sights significantly lower than world conquest. Instead, Magneto built a second orbital base called Avalon where he hoped to live a life of quiet seclusion.{{Issue|date=June 2009}} He is, by this point, a figurehead for the cause of mutantkind and is sought out by a group of new mutants calling themselves the [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]] who pledge their service and allegiance to him.{{Issue|date=June 2009}} Under the influence of one of them, [[Fabian Cortez]], he announces that the orbital base known as [[Asteroid M]] will be a new homeland for mutantkind, obtains [[nuclear missile]]s from an sunken Soviet Sub he had previously destroyed and places them around the Asteroid pointed towards Earth. 

Magneto would discover how Moira MacTaggert had altered his genetic structure when he had been de-aged. Enraged as he feels that his redemption has been a lie, he kidnaps Moira and subjects her to torture. Though it was later revealed that the genetic tampering had lost its effect when he had first used his powers after being re-aged, and thus his actions had never been influenced by Moira's tampering, the damage was done. While the X-Men attack Avalon to rescue Moira and stop Magneto's plans, humanity, the Soviets launch a particle beam satellite which destroys Asteroid M. Betrayed and abandoned at the last minute by Cortez, Magneto refuses Xavier's pleas to escape with the X-Men back to Earth and he and his followers "perish" in the subsequent explosion.<ref>X-Men #1-#3 (October-December 1991)</ref> It would later be revealed that Magneto survived the crash,  as the Acolyte Chrome had encased him in a protective shell. However, Chrome and the other Acolytes died.

The [[United Nations Security Council]], in response to a resurgent Magneto, votes to activate the "Magneto Protocols" — a satellite network, in slightly lower orbit than Avalon, which skews the Earth's magnetic field enough to prevent Magneto from using his powers within, preventing him from returning to the planet's surface. In response, Magneto generates an [[electromagnetic pulse]] not only destroying the satellites, but deactivating every electric device on Earth within minutes. The X-Men respond by hacking into [[Avalon (Marvel Comics)|Avalon]]'s own computer systems to teleport a small team to the station with the aid of [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] (who had joined Magneto as one of Magneto's Acolytes). Magneto, during the battle with the X-Men, rips the [[Adamantium (comics)|adamantium]] from [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]'s bones, which enrages Xavier to the point that he blanks his former friend's mind, leaving him in a coma. This action later leads to the creation of [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] an omnipotent being that was formed with the combination of both Xavier's and Magneto's powers. Magneto remained comatose on Avalon worshiped by his Acolytes, under the leadership of the ancient mutant [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]], until Avalon itself is destroyed by the arrival of [[Holocaust (comics)|Holocaust]] from the [[Age of Apocalypse]] Earth. During the destruction, [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] places Magneto in an escape pod sending him back to Earth. This pod is intercepted by [[Astra (comics)#Astra (Brotherhood)|Astra]], a former ally who now desires his death.

After cloning Magneto, Astra restored Magneto's memories and powers before attempting to kill him. Instead, Magneto, now fully revived, battles both Astra and his clone. After a pitched battle, Magneto triumphs over the clone sending him crashing into a South American barn. However, too weak to continue the battle, the real Magneto goes into hiding while the now-amnesiac clone becomes known as [[Joseph (comics)|Joseph]] (christened as such by the nun who discovered him) and eventually joins the X-Men. Since the world believes Joseph to be the real Magneto, Magneto takes his time to plan. He engages in a pair of brief diversions, first posing as "Erik the Red" and revealing [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]]'s past crimes to the X-Men, resulting in Gambit's expulsion from the group. Then he kills George Odekirk, the forger that created his "Erik Lensherr" alias to prevent his true identity from being discovered by [[Sabra (comics)|Sabra]] and [[Gabrielle Haller]].

Following this, Magneto constructs a machine to amplify his powers and blackmail the world into creating a mutant nation. The X-Men and Joseph, who has fallen under Astra's control again, oppose him. The X-Men defeat Magneto, leaving his powers severely depleted from over-strain, while Joseph sacrifices his life to restore the Earth to normal. The [[United Nations]], manipulated by its mutant affairs officer Alda Huxley, cedes to Magneto the island nation of [[Genosha]], which has no recognized government. Magneto rules that nation for some time with the aid of many who had previously opposed him, including Quicksilver, [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]], and the founder of the Acolytes, [[Fabian Cortez]], and engages in a brutal civil war with the island's former human rulers.

Despite the UN's hopes that Genosha's civil war between humans and mutants would destroy or at least occupy him, Magneto ultimately crushes all opposition to his rule and rebuilds the nation by forming an army of mutants dedicated to his cause, including mutants coming from all over the world seeking sanctuary. Eventually, Magneto is able to use the [[Genegineer]]'s equipment to fully restore his power. Intending to declare war on humanity, he captures [[Professor X]] to use as a symbol with which to rally his troops. In the [[Eve of Destruction (comics)|Eve of Destruction]] storyline, [[Jean Grey]] recruits a new groupof X-Men to help Cyclops and Wolverine rescue Xavier and defeat Magneto. Taking the opportunity for revenge, Wolverine attacks the defeated Magneto, crippling him with serious injuries.

===Xorn===
Following those events, Genosha is destroyed by [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] under the orders of [[Cassandra Nova|Cassandra Nova Xavier]], Charles Xavier's previously unknown dead twin sister. Magneto and 16 million mutants who were gathered at Genosha are reported deceased. Months after the event, a team of X-Men searching in the debris apparently finds a recording of Magneto's last words. Mutant-supremacist ideas, attributed to him, become widespread in the mutant community with some holding him as a martyr of the mutant cause. Magneto became a [[Che Guevara]]-like revolutionary figure in the mutant community. T-shirts and posters with Magneto's face and the phrase "Magneto Was Right" became popular items.

During this time, the mutant known as [[Xorn]] joins the X-Men. Later in the [[Planet X (comics)|Planet X]] storyline, Xorn revealed himself to have Magneto's face beneath. It is alleged that Xorn never existed and is simply an identity conceived wholly by Magneto. Having "exposed his deception", he then schemes to destroy the X-Men and reverse the polarity of the Earth's magnetic field, increasing his power with the use of a mutant drug called "[[List of fictional medicines and drugs|Kick]]". He recruits the Special Class and [[Stepford Cuckoos|Esme]] from the Xavier School to serve as his Brotherhood of Mutants, though most eventually turn against him. Before being decapitated by Wolverine, "Magneto" devastates much of New York City and kills [[Jean Grey]] using a lethal [[electromagnetic pulse]], causing her to have a massive [[stroke]].

Some time later, the X-Men find another Xorn, who identifies himself as Shen Xorn and claims that the "Magneto" who devastated New York was Kuan-Yin Xorn, his brother. The reasons behind this act remain unexplained in the comics, although Marvel [[editor-in-chief]] [[Joe Quesada]] later elaborated on this, [http://www.newsarama.com/NewJoeFridays/NewJoeFridays03.html stating] that "Kuan-Yin Xorn came under the influence of as-yet-to-be-revealed entity that forced him to assume the identity of Magneto." This [[retcon]] has never been mentioned in the comics, but remains the only official explanation of the Xorn character and its relationship to Magneto.

===House of M===
{{Main|House of M}}
[[Image:House of Magnus2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The House of Magnus, from left to right: [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], [[Scarlet Witch]], her two children William and Thomas, Magneto and [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]].]]
Following the events in New York, Xavier meets the real Magneto in Genosha, who apparently survived Cassandra Nova's attack and lived unnoticed within the ruins. Xavier brings with him the coffin supposedly containing the corpse of Xorn (but which is later shown to be filled with guns), and explains how the impostor has killed over 5,000 people including Jean Grey. Magneto is shocked and angry that people think he is capable of committing such an act. Xavier and Magneto put aside their differences to rebuild the island nation, rekindling their friendship in the process. <ref>''[[Excalibur_(comics)#Excalibur_vol._3_.282004.29]]'' #20</ref>

Magneto's daughter [[Scarlet Witch|Wanda]] suffers a mental breakdown over the loss of her children and starts to warp reality in order to recreate them, inadvertently resulting in [[Avengers Disassembled|random attacks on the Avengers]], until [[Doctor Strange]] puts her into a coma to stop her. In Genosha, Magneto hears Wanda's psychic cry for help and, creating a [[wormhole]], and whisks her away before the Avengers were able to stop her. Back in Genosha, Magneto tends to Wanda increasingly becoming more withdrawn and angry. He allows only Xavier to visit, in the belief that Xavier can help Wanda. Xavier is angry to learn that Magneto has revealed to the world that he was alive by rescuing Wanda, but agrees to try and help.  Months pass with no avail, and not even Doctor Strange's [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] helps. The X-Men and the Avengers meet to decide what should be done, and when some of the members suggest killing Wanda, [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] informs him of this development, as Quicksilver convinces Wanda to warp reality into the [[House of M]]. In the new reality, where the New Avengers, the X-Men and the members of Wanda's family all received their 'heart's desires', Magneto is attacked by Sentinels over Manhattan in 1979, and reveals an alleged international anti-mutant conspiracy involving [[Richard Nixon]]. This results in Magneto being granted sovereignty over Genosha as leader of the world's much larger and much faster growing mutant population. Magneto then turns Genosha into the most powerful, technologically advanced country on Earth to which he uses as a base to dominate the world and place mutantkind above humanity.

A group of heroes are brought together by Wolverine — who alone remembers the way the world is supposed to be because his 'heart's desire' was to regain all the memories stolen from him by the Weapon X Program — and have their own memories of the "real world" restored by [[Layla Miller]]. They band together and attack Magneto in Genosha, believing him to be the one responsible. During the battle Layla is able to restore Magneto's memories as well, and he confronts his son, enraged that Quicksilver had done all of this in his name. Quicksilver reveals that Magneto would have let Wanda die, but Magneto replies that Quicksilver was only using Wanda and himself, and he would never have allowed this to happen. Furious, Magneto kills Quicksilver. Sensing her brother's death, Wanda retaliates with the phrase "No more mutants," Wanda changes the world back to its original form and [[Decimation (comics)|causes ninety-eight percent of the mutant population to lose their powers]] including Magneto who is left a broken man.

When Quicksilver comes to Genosha to restore the mutants' powers with the [[Inhumans]]' [[Terrigen Mists]], Magneto condemns his actions, pointing out the disastrous effects the Mists have on non-Inhumans. An angry Quicksilver attacks Magneto with his new powers from the Mists, savagely beating him until his own daughter [[Luna Maximoff|Luna]] stops him.

===The Collective===
[[Weapon Omega|The Collective]], a being composed of energy from all the former mutants' powers, merges with an energy absorbing mutant named [[Michael Pointer (comics)|Michael Pointer]]. The Collective kills all of the most recent incarnation of [[Alpha Flight]] save for [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]], and battles the [[New Avengers]] before landing in [[Genosha]]. There it re-powers Magneto and reveals itself as [[Xorn]]. Xorn explains that he took the image of Magneto because he knew mutants would follow him, and that they needed the real Magneto again. Magneto, not in control of himself, begins attacking the New Avengers and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents while he pleads for them to kill him. He is taken down with a direct brain attack from mutant S.H.I.E.L.D. agent [[Daisy Johnson]]. [[Iron Man]], [[Carol Danvers|Ms. Marvel]], and the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] combine their powers and send the Collective/Xorn into the Sun. Michael is separated from the Collective and an unconscious Magneto is loaded into a S.H.I.E.L.D. helicopter. The helicopter, however, explodes upon take-off through unknown means; his body was not found among the rubble.<ref>''[[New Avengers (comic)|New Avengers]]'' #20</ref>

===Divided We Stand===
Magneto appeared at the end of ''X-Men: Legacy #208'', apparently at the behest of [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]] and claiming to be powerless, to help restore the broken psyche of Professor Xavier. Together they manage to revive Xavier before being attacked by [[Joanna Cargill|Frenzy]]. Magneto wounds Frenzy by firing a medical laser into one of her eyes, prompting Exodus to ask what punishment he would have instilled on a human who injured a mutant (as the Acolytes consider him a human, Exodus even claims that Magneto is dead and that Lehnsherr is just a shell that was left over). Magneto replies "Death" and Exodus proceeds to choke him with his telekinesis before Xavier challenges Exodus on the astral plane. After Xavier defeats Exodus, he leaves Magneto and [[Karima Shapandar|Omega Sentinel]] to try and rebuild his lost memories.

===Manifest Destiny===
Magneto appears, seemingly repowered, re-activating Sentinels to attack the X-Men just as they had recently relocated to [[San Francisco]]. After the X-Men defeated him, it is soon revealed that the return of his powers are actually artificially recreated by a suit designed by the [[High Evolutionary]], and that his attack itself was a distraction, so the High Evolutionary could gain an unknown object from the [[Dreaming Celestial]], in order to further a shared goal between Magneto and the High Evolutionary.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #500</ref> After extensively examining the Dreaming Celestial, the High Evolutionary subjected Magneto to an extremely dangerous technological procedure in an attempt restore his powers, which had apparently succeeded as his powers had been restored to its pre-M-Day condition. Re-energized, he referred to himself as Magneto rather than his former alias of Erik Lehnsherr and Magnus. <ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #507</ref>

===Nation X===
Magneto makes an appearance on Utopia, the new mutant homeland created by the X-Men using the remnants of his old Asteroid M. Magneto stuns the X-Men by telling them he has come in peace and offers to work with them as he is rather impressed with their recent efforts in defending and helping mutantkind. <ref>[http://marvel.com/catalog/?id=13169]</ref>  Magneto fears that mutantkind is doomed until Cyclops tells him that [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope Summers]], the Mutant Messiah is alive and well. He puts this offer in action as he assists the X-Men in defending Utopia Island from an attack of [[Predator X (Marvel Comics)|Predator X]] monsters.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #515-516</ref> After helping the X-Men defeat the Predators, Magneto, now considered an unofficial member of the X-Men, assists in helping the rest of the X-Men in stabilizing the asteroid from sinking into the Pacific. To that end, he was last seen proposing with [[Namor]] to create a joint mutant-Atlantean homeland, to which Namor agreed.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #516-518</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
{{Refimprove|date=December 2009}}
Magneto is a mutant with the ability to manipulate metals, and generate and manipulate electromagnetic fields. The full extent of Magneto's power has been greatly expanded over the years since his first introduction. At a basic level, however, Magneto can manipulate the [[electromagnetic force]] to achieve a wide range of effects.

Such effects include the creation of force-fields which can selectively block out matter and energy (while they usually allow sound and visible light to pass through so Magneto can interact with other characters, they can also shut out sonic blasts and shockwaves, as well as lasers and nuclear explosions). Thanks to this, Magneto is invulnerable to most harm when his personal field is active and can survive in deep space.

He can freely manipulate [[electromagnetic energy]] in all frequencies of the spectrum, control and create [[electromagnetic fields]] and generate massive [[EMP]]s. He has also been depicted using his powers to affect both magnetic and nonmagnetic materials down to the sub-atomic level, although element transmutation strains him significantly and it seems a lot easier for him to manipulate  the former. He has levitated objects as heavy as a 30,000 ton [[nuclear submarine]] and pulled a large amount of asteroids from their orbits in the solar system's asteroid belt to entirely block sunlight from reaching the earth, the maximum quantity of mass that he can affect at one time is unknown.

He can also channel his magnetic powers through his own body so as to appear to temporarily increase his strength, stamina, and agility to superhuman levels.

He has demonstrated the capacity to warp the space/time continuum and create a [[wormhole]] to safely teleport himself and others. This, however, can only be explained by manipulation of gravity - it has been suggested he might be able to control all four Fundamental Forces of matter.

Magneto has consistently and frequently been depicted as resisting all but the strongest or most unexpected telepathic attacks. In once instance, Magneto was shown able to hold off Xavier's attacks long enough to unscrew Xavier's chair from a boat, and levitate Xavier two miles and into the range of a device that nullified mutant powers. A number of explanations has been proposed for this over the years, such as: anti-telepathy technology wired into his helmet,latent telepathic powers (during the [[Secret Wars]] saga), some physical aspect of his electromagnetic powers that can interfere with telepathy (he once used the Earth's magnetic field to dampen the powers of all telepaths within his reach) or sheer willpower (''X-Men'' Vol. 2 #2). In some of his earlier appearances, Magneto was also able to engage in [[astral projection]], read other's dreams, issue telepathic commands and probe the minds of others.<ref>''The X-Men'', v.1, #5-7 (May-Sept. 1964), ''New Mutants'' Vol. 1 #38 (1986), ''X-Men vs. Avengers'' minisieries (1987), ''Marvel Fanfare'' #33 (1987)</ref>. The most extreme example of this resistance was in X-Men Vol. 2 #25, the Fatal Attractions crossover, in which Magneto held off the combined telepathic might of Xavier and Jean Grey without his helmet on.

In addition to his powers, Magneto is also a [[genius]] with competence in various fields of advanced science, especially in [[genetic engineering|genetic manipulation]], physics, [[engineering]], and other fields of technology. He has created advanced weaponry, space stations, intelligent superhuman lifeforms, devices that generate volcanoes and earthquakes, block telepathy, and nullify all mutant powers except his own.  He has reconstructed computerized devices from memory.  Magneto is also a master strategist with extensive combat experience capable of surviving or even defeating superior forces. While Magneto has some knowledge of hand to hand combat and will engage an enemy this way if necessary, he is not an expert and prefers to use his powers in combat situations.
