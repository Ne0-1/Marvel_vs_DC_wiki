'''Magneto''' (real name unknown, alias '''Erik Magnus Lehnsherr''') is a [[comic book]] [[fictional character]], a [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  He has at various times been a [[supervillain]], a [[superhero]], and an [[anti-hero]] and in his role as a villain - arguably his most famous role, though not his most complex - he is the primary antagonist of the [[X-Men]].  He was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], though it was writer [[Chris Claremont]] who would later flesh out and develop the character into the one he is today.

==Publication history== 

Magneto has appeared in various issues of ''Uncanny X-Men'', ''X-Men'' and several other Marvel Universe titles throughout the decades. This popular character would receive his own title one day.   
    
When the character returned to plague the X-Men and even the world in 1993, Magneto received a special [[One-shot|one-shot]] issue. The one-shot featured reprinted Magneto stories of old. These stories originally appeared in issues of ''Classic X-Men''. The stories themselves were written by Chris Claremont and drawn by British artist [[John Bolton (comic book artist)|John Bolton]].    
   
In 1996, Magneto was given another mini-series, this time to be written by [[Peter Milligan]] and with Kelley Jones as artist. As it turns out to be, that this four issue mini-series actually featured [[Joseph (comics)|Joseph]], a younger clone of Magneto.

==Character history==
===Early life===
Magneto is a survivor of the [[Auschwitz Concentration Camp|Auschwitz]] death camp. As a young boy with his power over magnetism not yet developed, he and his family were persecuted for being [[Jew]]ish. Magneto witnessed the murder of his family by the [[Nazi]]s during the [[Holocaust]]. He alone survived and was sent into the camps being forced by the Nazis to work in the [[Sonderkommando]]s. 

Magneto has since been tormented by the fact that he could have put a stop to the entire process had he only been aware of his full powers at the time.   The entire Nazi military would not have presented an insurmountable challenge to Magneto in his prime. However, since he was malnourished and sickly while in the camps, he may not have been in a condition to use his powers even if he were aware of them.
[[Image:magnetoholoc.png|150px|Magneto and Magda escape from the death camp.|thumb|left]]
After [[World War II]], he married the [[Roma_people|gypsy]] Magda, a fellow survivor of the Nazi death camps and sired a daughter, Anya. Magneto consciously used his mutant abilities for the first time to protect Magda and himself from a fire. Unfortunately, he was unable to rescue his daughter from the blaze due to his inexperience coupled with interference from a mob of angry humans. He unleashed his powers to decimate the human crowd in revenge. Terrified by Magneto's powers, Magda fled. 

Months later Magda would discover that she was pregnant and would die giving birth to the mutant twins [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and the [[Scarlet Witch]], under the auspices of the artificially evolved cow midwife named Bova at the foothills of the demonically empowered Wundagore.
While searching for his wife during this time, Magneto, realizing that his name was known to his pursuers, paid a forger named George Odekirk to create the cover identity of "Erik Magnus Lehnsherr" for him. His true name remains unknown.

Magneto made his way to the newly created nation of [[Israel]]. There he befriended [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] while working at a psychiatric hospital near [[Haifa]] that tried to help traumatized Holocaust victims. Neither revealed to the other the fact that he was a mutant.  The two held lengthy debates hypothesizing what would happen if humanity were to be faced with a new, super-powered, race of humans.  The two friends revealed their powers to each other when they prevented Nazi [[Baron Strucker|Baron Wolfgang von Strucker]] and his [[HYDRA]] agents from obtaining a large cache of Nazi gold. Magneto had presumably killed Strucker by dropping the cave in on him, but Strucker somehow managed to survive and resurfaced much later. Realizing that his and Xavier's views on mutant-human relations were incompatible, Magneto left with the gold.

===Rise of Magneto===
Magneto's experience in the death camps had shaped his outlook on the current situation that mutants faced in the Marvel Universe. Determined that such atrocities will never be committed against mutant-kind, he was willing to use deadly force to protect mutants. He had several times expressed the belief that mutants (''Homo superior'') will eventually become the dominant life form on the planet. He constantly wavers between wanting to exist in harmony with ''Homo sapiens'', wanting a separate homeland for mutants and wanting to enforce his superiority over all humanity. Magneto's status as [[hero]] or [[villain]] is a complex one. His methods are often extreme, but his goals are often noble at their root.

[[Image:Uncanny1.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Magneto's debut in ''The [Uncanny] X-Men'' #1. Art by [[Jack Kirby]].]]

Magneto came to the public eye as a genetic [[terrorism|terrorist]] with an attack on the American military base at [[Cape Citadel]] (his first comic book appearance, in ''X-Men'' #1).  He was thwarted by his old friend Xavier's mutant students, code-named the [[X-Men]].  He briefly conquered the tiny South American nation of [[San Marco (comics)|San Marco]] after forming the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], which included his children [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and the [[Scarlet Witch]], though their familial ties were unknown to all three at the time. He invaded in the hopes of establishing a mutant homeland there, but was thwarted by the X-Men. He went on to create an orbital base of operations in an asteroid which he dubbed [[Asteroid M]], in which he and his mutant followers had hollowed out a large habitat for themselves.

Dabbling in [[genetics]], Magneto created an artificial humanoid whom he named [[Alpha the Ultimate Mutant]].  Unfortunately, as often happens with artificially created creatures, Alpha rebelled against his creator. Alpha reduced Magneto to infancy using his powers. Magneto was placed in the care of Xavier's former love interest, Professor [[Moira MacTaggert]] at [[Muir Island]].  It was later revealed that MacTaggert tinkered with the infant Magneto's genetic code in an attempt to remove any genes that might cause him to become the "evil" mutant he would become in adulthood.  She claimed that she had hoped to cure both Magneto and her own young son, [[Proteus (comics)|Kevin]], of the problems and dangers that their mutancy caused them. However, any genetic tampering lost its effect once Magneto first activated his powers again. Later, Magneto was eventually found at [[Muir Island]] and restored to early adulthood by the alien [[Shi'ar]] agent [[Erik the Red (comics)|Davan Shakari]], who normally goes by the code-name "Erik the Red".

===Redemption===
[[Image:uncanny200.png|thumb|Magneto goes on trial for his crimes in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #200. Art by John Romita Jr.|150px]]
Magneto returned to his attempts at global conquest being opposed time and again by the X-Men and a number of other heroes. In his most audacious attempt to conquer the world, he threatened the governments of the world with earthquakes and volcanic activity. Though he had no qualms about sinking a Russian submarine, killing all aboard after the submarine had attacked him.  Then raising a volcano in the city of Varykino as an object lesson, he did give time for a mass evacuation before lava swept over the city. Likewise, he was shocked when he physically struck down the adolescent X-Man [[Shadowcat|Kitty Pryde]] in battle. Remorseful at how he had almost killed such a young girl, Magneto put an end to his attempt at world conquest and retreated to rethink the path his life had taken.

Magneto later discovered that former Brotherhood members the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver were actually his children, but when he tried reaching out to them they pushed him away saying they couldn't forgive him for his past actions and being related wouldn't change that.

Magneto found himself allied with Professor Xavier and the X-Men when a group of heroes and villains were abducted by the [[Beyonder]], a nearly omnipotent yet frustratingly short-sighted being, to an alien world to participate in the [[Secret Wars]]. This surprised many of the other heroes who still believed he was a villain and it was up to the X-Men to defend them.

After the Secret Wars were over, Magneto was transported back to his base Asteroid M where the alien [[Warlock (comics)|Warlock]], fleeing from space to Earth, collided into the asteroid breaking it to pieces.  Magneto was sent falling towards Earth where he fell into the Atlantic Ocean and became seriously injured. He was was rescued by Lee Forrester the captain of the fishing trawler Arcadia. Lee helped him recuperate from his injuries and the two shared a small romance.

After recuperating from his injuries, Magneto was asked to aid the X-Men in battling the Beyonder who had returned. Magneto stayed with the X-Men even after the Beyonder was defeated. His association with the heroic team softened his views on humanity and Magneto surrendered himself to the law in order to stand trial for his past crimes. A special tribunal was organized and Magneto intended to abide by whatever verdict was brought. The trial started well for Magneto as the tribunal chose to strike all charges against him from prior to his "rebirth" deeming that this had constituted a figurative death of the old Magneto. However, it was then interrupted by the attack of [[Fenris (comics)|Fenris]], the twin children of [[Baron Strucker|Baron Wolfgang von Strucker]]. Fenris was defeated but [[Professor X]] was brought to the point of death due to the strain of battle and previously sustained injuries. Xavier asked Magneto to take over his school and the X-Men. Xavier told Magneto that doing so would make amends enough for his past crimes although Xavier was at this point an observer at the trial and had no authority to do so. Magneto agreed and chose not to return to the courtroom. Instead he took over Xavier's school under the assumed identity of Michael Xavier, Charles Xavier's cousin and was a fugitive from justice. Seeing him try to reform, the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver later tried accepting him as their father.

[[Image:Magneto-and-Illyana.jpg|thumb|left|90px|Magneto comforts [[Magik (comics)|Magik]].]]
Though Magneto made a substantial effort as the headmaster to the [[New Mutants]] and an ally to the X-Men, his tenure was disastrous.  He was forced to deal with the death of all of the younger students, the New Mutants and their traumatic return to life after being slain by the godlike [[Beyonder]]. He was manipulated by the [[Emma Frost|White Queen]], mutant headmaster of the rival school the Massachusetts Academy, battled legally recognized heroes such as the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and the [[Supreme Soviets]].  He was unable to prevent his students [[Sunspot (comics)|Roberto Da Costa]] and the alien Technarch [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Warlock]] from running away from the school, saw the death of the young mutant student [[Cypher (comics)|Douglas Ramsey]] and witnessed on national television the apparent death of all of the senior X-Men. Feeling that desperate measures needed to be taken, Magneto forged an alliance with the X-Men's enemies the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] and went so far as to oust longtime co-chair [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]] in order to establish himself as the Hellfire Club's Grey King.  

Seeing that mutantkind was to be confronted with far more perilous times than ever before, Magneto began seeking allies in order to protect mutants from humanity. Towards this end he participated in the "[[Acts of Vengeance]]" alongside such established villains as [[Doctor Doom]], the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]] and the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]]. He also confronted [[Red Skull]], an unrepentant Nazi war criminal, on whom Magneto took revenge by entombing him alive. He worked alongside the American intelligence agent [[Nick Fury]] as well as a number of Russian operatives in order to re-establish peace in the [[Savage Land]]. Tired of the constant state of strife, Magneto built a second orbital base where he hoped to live a life of quiet seclusion. He was by this point a figurehead for the cause of mutanthood and was sought out by a number of new mutants calling themselves the [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]].

===Avalon and Genosha===
After this, Magneto set his sights significantly lower than world conquest; he sought only a haven for mutantkind. He first attempted to make the orbital base known as [[Asteroid M|Asteroid M]] such a haven but was opposed by the governments of the world and the X-Men. The X-men did not know if Magneto was returning to his villainous ways or not and so they confronted Magneto. At the time the X-men were divided into the Blue team and the Gold team. Xavier made the mistake of sending the Blue Team, led by [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], who had never trusted Magneto, not even when Magneto had reformed.

Without giving Magneto a chance to explain himself, Cyclops ordered the others to attack. During the battle [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], who had been friends with Magneto when Magneto had been on the team, attempted to kill him much to Magneto's shock. With the exception of [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], none of the X-Men were any different.

[[Image:Mindwipem.png|150px|Xavier mindwipes Magneto. Art by Andy Kubert.|thumb]]
Feeling betrayed by his former allies, Magneto fled. He later discovered how Moira had tampered with his mind when he had been de-aged as a child. Magneto felt enraged, feeling that his redemption had been a lie. Though it was later revealed that the genetic tampering had lost its effect when he had first used his powers after being re-aged and thus his actions had never been influenced by Moira's tampering, the damage had been done. He became the X-Men's enemy once more.

Later, the [[United Nations]] [[Security Council]], in response to a resurgent Magneto, voted to activate the "Magneto Protocols" - a satellite network; in slightly lower orbit than Avalon, which skewed the Earth's magnetic field enough to prevent Magneto from using his powers within, preventing him from returning to the planet's surface. In response to the activation, Magneto generated a massive electromagnetic pulse not only destroying the satellites, but deactivating every electrically powered device on Earth within eleven minutes. The X-Men responded hacking into [[Avalon (comics)|Avalon]]'s own systems to teleport a small team to the station, aided by [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], who had joined Magneto engaged him in battle. Finally, Wolverine launched a killing strike at him leading Magneto to respond by ripping the adamantium from his bones. This act of self-defense enraged Xavier to the point where he mindwiped his former friend leaving him comatose, an action which later led to the creation of [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]].

Magneto then remained in this state on Avalon worshipped by his Acolytes, under the leadership of [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]] until Avalon itself was destroyed.  During the destruction, [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] placed Magneto in an escape pod sending him back to Earth. This pod was intercepted by [[Astra (comics)|Astra]], a former ally of his whom now desired his death. She cloned Magneto and when the clone was ready, she restored Magneto's mind since she felt there was no point in killing him unless he knew it was her doing it. After a pitched battle, Magneto triumphed over the clone sending him crashing into a Mexican barn. However, weakened by this, the real Magneto went into hiding while the clone became known as [[Joseph (comics)|Joseph]] and eventually joined the X-Men.

[[Image:Magrex1.jpg|Cover to ''Magneto Rex'' #1, featuring Magneto with Rogue and Quicksilver. Art by Brandon Peterson.|150px|thumb|left]]

Magneto then took this time to plan since the world believed Joseph to be the real Magneto. He engaged in a pair of brief diversions, first posing as "Erik the Red" and revealing [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]]'s past crimes to the X-Men, resulting in Gambit's expulsion then when his true identity was on the verge of being discovered by [[Sabra (comics)|Sabra]] and Gabrielle Haller, killing Odekirk to prevent this. 

Following this, Magneto constructed a machine with which to amplify his powers and blackmail the world into creating a mutant nation. The X-Men and Joseph, who had fallen under Astra's control again, opposed him but even as the X-Men defeated Magneto, leaving his powers severely depleted as a result of over-strain and Joseph sacrificed his life to restore the Earth to normal.  The [[United Nations]] manipulated by Alda Huxley who was the United Nations mutant affairs officer, ceded the island nation of [[Genosha]], which had no recognized government, to Magneto. Magneto ruled that nation for some time with the aid of many who had previously opposed him, including Quicksilver, [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]] and the founder of the Acolytes, [[Fabian Cortez]].

Despite the UN's hopes that Genosha's ongoing civil war between humans and mutates would destroy or at least occupy him, Magneto managed to crush all opposition to his rule and rebuilt the nation by forming an army of mutates dedicated to his cause, with yet more mutants coming from all over the world to seek sanctuary in Genosha.

Eventually, he was able to use the [[Genegineer]]'s equipment to fully restore his power. Intending to declare war on humanity, Magneto captured [[Professor X]] using him as a symbol with which to rally his troops. In the [[Eve of Destruction (comics)|Eve of Destruction]] storyline, [[Jean Grey]] recruited a new lineup of X-Men to assist Cyclops and Wolverine in rescuing Xavier and defeating Magneto. Taking the opportunity to get his revenge, Wolverine attacked the defeated Magneto leaving him with serious injuries and crippling him for a time.

===Xorn===
[[Image:xorneto.jpg|right|150px|thumb|[[Xorn|Kuan-Yin Xorn]], posing as Magneto, kills [[Jean Grey]].]]
Soon after this, Genosha was decimated by yet another rogue mutant -- [[Cassandra Nova Xavier]], Charles Xavier's previously unknown dead sister, whom Xavier had killed in the womb. Magneto and 16 million mutants who were gathered at Genosha were reported deceased. Months after the event, a team of X-Men searching in the debris found what was apparently a recording of Magneto's last words. Mutant-supremacist ideas, attributed to him, became wide-spread in the mutant community with some holding him as a martyr of the mutant cause.

Meanwhile, the mutant known as [[Xorn]] had joined the X-Men after being rescued from captivity in [[China]]. Xorn was said to be a Chinese mutant with a "star for a brain" and wore a face-concealing metal helmet with a skull-like motif. He also possessed nebulous healing powers, although the only time he was shown to heal anyone was when he deactivated a number of microscopic [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]] and simultaneously restored Professor Xavier's ability to walk. 

In the [[Planet X (comics)|Planet X]] storyline, he eventually removed the helmet, revealing Magneto's face beneath.  It was alleged that Xorn never existed and was simply an identity conceived wholly by Magneto. Having "exposed his deception", he then schemed to destroy the X-Men and reverse the polarity of the Earth's magnetic field, increasing his power with the use of a mutant drug called "[[Fictional_chemical_substance#Fictional_medicine_and_drugs|Kick]]". He recruited the Special Class and [[Stepford Cuckoos|Esme]] from the Xavier School to serve as his Brotherhood of Mutants, though most eventually turned against him. Before being decapitated by Wolverine, "Magneto" killed [[Jean Grey]] using a lethal electromagnetic pulse that caused her to have a massive [[stroke]] and devastated much of New York City.

Some time later, the X-Men found another Xorn, who identified himself as Shen Xorn and revealed that the "Magneto" who devastated New York was Kuan-Yin Xorn, his brother and said that he believed that someone else was controlling his brother. Who, as yet, remains unknown.

===Rebuilding Genosha===
[[Image: Excalibur_magneto.jpg|150px|thumb|Magneto returns.]]
With the launch of a new [[Excalibur (comics)|''Excalibur'']] series, Xavier met up with the real Magneto who was actually alive. Xavier had with him Kuan-Yin Xorn's corpse. When asked who was in it, Xavier explained how the impostor had killed over 5,000 people including Jean Grey. Magneto was shocked and angry that people thought he was capable of committing such an act.

:Xavier: The latest death count in New York is 5,000.  Slaughtered simply because they weren't mutants, as a demonstration of will and power.
:Magneto: And they think me capable of such a thing? Do you think me capable of such a thing?
:Xavier: Well, you do have a certain... reputation.
:Magneto: Not for THIS!

Xavier and Magneto put aside their differences to rebuild the island nation, rekindling their friendship in the process. But tragedy struck before long.

===House of M===
[[Image:Excal14.jpg|left|150px|Cover to ''Excalibur'' #14. Art by Aaron Lopresti.|thumb]]
Magneto's daughter Wanda Maximoff, the [[Scarlet Witch]], suffered a mental breakdown over the loss of her children and started to warp reality in order to recreate them, inadvertently resulting in random attacks on the Avengers. The Avengers confronted the mentally unstable Wanda and [[Doctor Strange]] put her in a coma. Over in Genosha, Magneto heard Wanda's psychic cry for help. He created a [[wormhole]] and was transported to Wanda's location. Before the Avengers could do anything, Magneto grabbed his daughter and flew away. 

Back at Genosha, Magneto kept Wanda in a bed taking care of her. He became more withdrawn and angry, refusing to let anyone into the house with the exception of Xavier, who he believed could help her. When Xavier returned from a mission he was on, he was enraged that Magneto blew his cover in front of the entire Avengers. Magneto begged his old friend to help his daughter and Xavier agreed to try.

Xavier spent several months trying to help Wanda to no avail. Not even Strange's [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] would do anything for her. Worried, he arranged a meeting for the X-Men and the Avengers to decide what should be done. Some of the members said that the only option was to kill Wanda. [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] rushed to Magneto and told him that the two groups were planning on killing Wanda. 

When an ashamed Magneto admitted that he didn't know what to do anymore and that the groups may be right, Quicksilver convinced Wanda that she could undo her wrongs by using her powers to turn the world into a world of peace. Using her powers, Wanda warped reality into the [[House of M]], a world where mutants were the majority, humans the minority and Magneto the ruler.
[[Image:Homfamily.PNG|The House of Magnus. Featured from left to right are; Quicksilver, the Scarlet Witch, the Scarlet Witch's children, Magneto, and Polaris. Art by Oliver Coipel.|thumb]]
In this world, Magneto was attacked by Sentinels over Manhattan in 1979. At the end of the attack, Magneto revealed an alleged international anti-mutant conspiracy involving [[Richard M. Nixon]]. The main result of this was that Magneto was granted sovereignty of the island of Genosha as the leader of the world's mutants. 

A young mutant named Layla Miller was able to use her mutant abilities to restore several of the heroes' memories. They headed over to Genosha to attack Magneto, believing him to be the one responsible for the change. During the battle between Magneto's forces and the others, Layla was able to restore Magneto's memories as well. 

Magneto confronted Quicksilver, enraged that Quicksilver had done all of this in his name.  Quicksilver told Magneto that he would have let Wanda die, but Magneto replied that he had only used him and Wanda. Furious, Magneto killed Quicksilver.

Wanda revived her brother, telling Magneto that Quicksilver had only wanted him to be happy and that Magneto had ruined them choosing the mutants over his own children. Saying "No more mutants," Wanda changed the world back to its original form and caused [[decimation (comics)|ninety-eight percent of the mutant population to lose their powers]], leaving the mutant race on the brink of extinction. Magneto was one of the several mutants to lose powers, left a broken man.

==Powers and abilities== 
''Magneto is now powerless, following the events of House of M.  He is now a normal homo sapien. The description of his powers below are prior to the House of M timeline.''

Arguably the most powerful man on the planet, Magneto is a mutant with the superhuman power of [[-kinesis#Magnetokinesis|magnetokinesis]] resulting from an extremely high level of electrolytes in his blood. He can shape and manipulate magnetic fields that exist naturally or artificially, allowing him to lift and move heavy objects (at least 100 tons), control ferrous particles in the atmosphere and even alter the [[Earth's magnetic field]] which extends into space as the [[Magnetosphere]]. It is unclear, however, whether he must draw magnetic force from outside himself (if so, then he can do so over vast distances). With the primal forces of nature at his command, Magneto has stopped armies, moved mountains and threatened to devastate the world with apocalyptic floods and earthquakes. Magneto once blanketed half the globe with a self-generated electromagnetic pulse that caused widespread devastation. 

Although Magneto's primary power is magnetism, he seems to have some ability to project or manipulate any form of energy that is related to magnetism, or the entire electro-magnetic spectrum. He can fire bolts of electricity and create enough intense heat as infrared radiation to destroy a metal door, as he is able to manipulate the entire [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. In addition, he can create anti-gravity fields and does so whenever he levitates non-magnetic objects. However, Magneto almost always uses only magnetism since it is more difficult for him to manipulate other forms of energy. 

Magneto also possesses minor psychic abilities, such as the ability to create a nearly impenetrable psychic shield for protection against psionic attack. 

Magneto's ability to wield his superhuman powers effectively is dependent upon his physical condition. When severely injured, his body is unable to withstand the strain of manipulating great amounts of magnetic forces.

Magneto's suit is made of flexible metal bonded on the molecular level, providing protection against projectiles, energy weapons and concussive force,  His helmet also provides further protection from psionic attacks as well as increase his mutant powers.

Magneto is an expert on [[genetic engineering|genetic manipulation]] and [[engineering]] with knowledge far beyond that of contemporary science. He is considered to be a [[genius]] within various scientific fields. He can mutate humans in order to give them superhuman powers or create adult clones of human beings and then manipulate the genetic structures of these clones during their development. He has created artificial living beings, designed magnetically-powered skycraft and spacecraft, complex robots and computers and magnetically-powered generators.

Magneto is a skilled strategist and has more than a rudimentary knowledge of hand-to-hand combat.

==Alternate versions==
===Amalgam===
In [[Amalgam Comics]], Magneto leads the Magnetic Men who are merged versions of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants and another universe's [[Metal Men]].

===Age of Apocalypse===
In the reality of [[Age of Apocalypse|Earth-295]], Magneto founded this world's X-Men after the death of his friend Charles Xavier. He and the X-Men fought against the forces of this world's [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. Magneto was eventually able to kill Apocalypse and bring peace to his world.

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the reality of [[Ultimate Marvel|Earth-1610]], Magneto, a.k.a. Erik Lensherr, stays essentially the same. He is a [[Holocaust]] survivor, the leader of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]] and a ruthless terrorist who gloats over dead bodies to achieve his dream of mutant supremacy(Ultimate X-Men #1). Additionally, he was the one to cripple [[Professor X]]. This version of Magneto is arguably darker and more cynical than the mainstream version. He commands a noticeably larger Brotherhood than his mainstream version and has displayed enough power to defeat the Ultimates. Magneto was imprisoned following the events of "Return of the King", the sixth arc in the series. He was then unseen until "Magnetic North", the 12th arc and the final run for writer Brian K. Vaughan. Magneto was found to have hatched a scheme to escape, utilizing the willing cooperation of Forge and Mystique as well as the unwilling but amicable aid of Longshot's mutation for luck. Magneto escaped by the end of the arc, leaving Mystique in his cell to impersonate him. He and Longshot then exit the Triskelion unharassed and Magneto makes it clear to Longshot that he has something different planned than any of his more typical world-domination schemes.

===Marvel Zombies===
In the reality of [[Marvel Zombies]], Magneto is one of a few survivors following a plague that caused an [[zombie|undead-like]] effect in "super-powered beings". Magneto helps Ultimate [[Reed Richards]] return to Earth-1610 after he accidently enters it. After Richards escapes with some cillivan survivors, Magneto begins running from the super hero zombies. He then is contacted by the [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]] who have held up in [[Asteroid M]]. They offer to send a shuttle down but Magento asks them to wait until he leaves New York City. Magneto is confronted by some zombie heroes and prepares for a fight, when a Zombie [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] bites him on his neck, giving him the zombie plague, however, before he could turn into a zombie, he is eaten alive by the other zombies.

==Appearances in other media==
[[Image:Magnetox3.jpg|thumb|150px|Sir [[Ian McKellen]] as Magneto in ''[[X-Men 3 (movie)|X3]]''.]]
*Magneto was played in the movie ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'', its sequel, ''[[X2 (movie)|X2]]'' and [[X3]] by Sir [[Ian McKellen]]. Magneto's powers in the movie appear to be subtly different than in the comic books. In particular, Magneto's powers appear to only affect metals and to have a limited range, though he is still one of the most powerful mutants on Earth. In the movies, his primary goal is to ensure the survival of mutantkind and he is willing to kill all non-mutants or change them into mutants to ensure this. A Magneto movie is in the works, though Ian Mckellen will not be in it. A small article from [[Entertainment Weekly]] has information on the movie:
:''"It's going to take place from 1939 Auschwitz up to 1955 or so," says writer Sheldon Turner of his just-announced "period" prequel to Fox's X-Men franchise. An exploration of villain Magneto's "psychological roots," Turner's script will also shed light on the youthful mutant's friend-then-nemesis Charles Xavier. Just don't look for Ian McKellen, 65, to get his helmet on."''
[[Image:Magneto05.gif|left|frame|Magneto as he appears in the [[Marvel vs. Capcom]] series]]

*Magneto's voice was provided by [[David Hemblen]] in the animated television series ''[[X-Men (animated series)|X-Men]]'' and by [[Lorne Kennedy]] in the [[Capcom]] fighting games. His voice was provided by [[Christopher Judge]] in the animated television series ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]''.
[[Image:Magnetolegends.PNG|thumb|100px|thumb|Magneto as a playable character in the video game ''X-Men Legends II''.]]

*The album ''[[Venus and Mars]]'' by [[Wings (band)|Wings]] includes a song about [[superheroes]] called "Magneto and Titanium Man". It is probably more than just a coincidence, especially since the song also references the names of two other Marvel villains ([[Titanium Man]] and the [[Crimson Dynamo]]). Another song to feature Magneto is the [[Tearjerkers]]' "Comic Book Heroes" from the various artists compliation ''[[Through the Back Door]]'', in which some of the lyrics are "[[Doctor Octopus|Doc Ock]], [[Doctor Doom|Von Doom]] and Magneto, don't wanna be like them".

*Magneto has also appeared in most of the X-Men video game spinoffs, usually as a [[Boss (video games)|boss]] and occasionally as a playable character. His most noticeable appearances are in ''[[X-Men: Children of the Atom (video game)|X-Men: Children of the Atom]]'' and ''[[X-Men Legends]]'' (and [[X-Men Legends II|its sequel]]) which has been released on various platforms.  He is also a very popular character in [[Marvel vs. Capcom 2]] due to his high mobility and speed.  He is considered one of the top 4 characters in the game, placing him in the so-called "god tier", along with [[Storm (comics)|Storm]], [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] and [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinel]].

*A capeless and non-helmeted version of Magneto was a playable character in the game, Marvel Nemesis: Rise of the Imperfects. In story mode, he is the last playable Marvel character in the game's story mode and like many Marvel heroes and villains in the story, is taken down by an Imperfect. Namely, Paragon, after he tried to strike an alliance with her. She refused. 

Magneto's finishing move was similar to the attack he did on the security guard in X2, where he forcibly removes the internal metal of his foes, thus killing them. Afterwhich, he turns said metal into ball shapes and spins them around. Much like the more graphic movie counterpart. 

*In ''[[X-Men Legends]]'', Magneto is voiced by [[Tony Jay]]. And in ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]'', Magneto was made a playable character as part of the games Brotherhood, which includes the Scarlet Witch and [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] and is voiced by [[Richard Greene]].
