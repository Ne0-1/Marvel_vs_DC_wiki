'''Mariko Yashida''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne]], the character first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #118 (February, 1979).

==Fictional character biography==
Mariko is the daughter of [[Shingen Yashida]], the half-sister of the [[Silver Samurai]], and cousin of [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]] and [[Sunpyre]]. Upon her father's death, she becomes head (Oyabun) of his [[Yakuza]] crime family, Clan Yashida.

She meets the X-Men when they return from a sojourn in the [[Savage Land]] and are asked to help Japan, which is being blackmailed by the terrorist [[Moses Magnum]]. She becomes close to [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] and eventually his fiancée, but their wedding is halted by the supervillain [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]], who uses a mind control device to change Mariko's mind. When the control is lifted, Wolverine and Mariko resume their relationship after a period of separation, but have not reconsidered marriage.

When the X-Men return from the first [[Secret Wars]] and accidentally end up in Japan and fighting a dragon their companion [[Lockheed (comics)|Lockheed]] had brought along, a young girl named [[Amiko Kobayashi]] loses her mother when a collapsing building crushes her. Dying, the woman begs Wolverine to take care of her daughter. Since Wolverine could not take care of her himself, he chose to place Amiko in Mariko's care, whom the girl soon adopts as a surrogate mother.

Mariko is poisoned with [[tetrodotoxin]] from a [[blowfish]] by an assassin named [[Reiko (comics)|Reiko]], in the hire of her rival [[Matsu'o Tsurayaba]].<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 2 #57 (July, 1992)</ref> She asks Wolverine to [[Euthanasia|kill her]] to avoid a painful death and preserve her honor. Wolverine kills her and vows to [[revenge|avenge]] Mariko by yearly severing parts of Matsu'o's body on the anniversary of her death.

==Other versions==
===Wolverine Noir===
Mariko appears in [[Wolverine Noir]].

===Age of Apocalypse===
In the "[[Age of Apocalypse]]" timeline, Mariko was a member of the [[Human High Council]], a group of humans that opposed [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse's]] tyrannical rule.  While not engaged to Logan, Mariko was his former lover and she birthed him a daughter, '''Kirika''', who is an amalgam of [[X-23]] and her 616 daughter [[Amiko Kobayashi]]. Mariko participates in an attempt to bomb forces of Apocalypse based in North America, though she knows this would mean extensive civilian deaths.

===Exiles===

In an alternate universe (Earth-2109), Mariko was Sunfire and became a member of the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]] from issue #2 (September, 2001) until her death in issue #37 (January, 2004) In the 2109 alternate universe, Mariko had the same powers as her 616 [[Marvel Universe]] counterpart [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]] and his sister [[Sunpyre]]. This version was created by [[Judd Winick]] and [[Mike McKone]]. A [[Japan]]ese citizen and a member of the [[X-Men]] in her reality, she was one of Marvel's few openly [[bisexual]] characters. She has a relationship with one reality's version of Spider-Woman, [[Mary Jane Watson]]. 

====Reception====
Sunfire's open homosexuality has attracted some interest after [[coming out]] in issue #11.<ref>[http://www.gayleague.com/gay/characters/display.php?id=58 Gay League profile]</ref> Her death has also garnered some attention. Perry Moore includes her as an example of the poor treatment of gay superheroes, paralleling the earlier [[Women in Refrigerators]].<ref>Perry Moore (2007) ''Hero'' (432 pages, [[Hyperion (publisher)|Hyperion]], ISBN 1423101952) [http://perrymoorestories.com/content/hero.asp?id=superheroes extract]: "Who Cares About the Death of a Gay Superhero Anyway?"</ref>

[[Judd Winick]] has been accused of pursuing some broader social agenda, making Sunfire gay being one of his ideas used to support this notion, as he explains in an interview with [[Comic Book Resources]]:<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=4298 Winick on "Green Arrow," Mia's HIV Status and More], [[Comic Book Resources]], October 14, 2004</ref>

<blockquote>I've done a smattering of stories that are socially relevant and I'm considered the soap-box guy. I've done one story arc in 'Green Lantern' featuring a gay character who was a survivor of a hate crime. Sunfire was gay in 'Exiles.' And there's other stuff sort of there that people like to hang their hat on, saying I'm just this big commie out there pushing an agenda. It's only a handful of stories.</blockquote>

====Powers and abilities====
Sunfire had the ability to absorb sunlight, and convert it into superheated [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] which burst into flame on contact with the air. She could use her plasma to fire beams of scorching heat or powerful bursts of solar fire. She could fly close to {{convert|100|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} by surrounding herself with a corona of fire, and then pushing the flames downward in a tight jet of superheated gas, shooting her through the air like a missile. Sunfire could see heat, by shifting her range of vision from normal light to [[infrared]] light. Sunfire was immune to extreme heat and radiation.

==Other media==
===Television===
* Mariko appears in the ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men]]'' episode "Code of Conduct" voiced by [[Gwendoline Yeo]]. She's depicted as Logan's former love and the wife of the [[Silver Samurai]]. A flashback showed how she fell in love with Wolverine, but the Yakuza had him duel Silver Samurai over her. When Silver Samurai abducted the X-Men years later, Wolverine arrived at the Japanese Embassy looking for her husband. She was present at the recent duel with Silver Samurai and Wolverine. After Silver Samurai acted dishonorably by using his mutant powers when it wasn't allowed, the Yakuza Leader annulled the duel and had his men take Silver Samurai away. When the Yakuza Leader agreed to release the captive X-Men, she told Wolverine that Silver Samurai will be driven from the Yakuza in shame and that they will not admit him again. When Wolverine asks her why she chose Silver Samurai, she said that she swore an oath of loyalty to him or else the Yakuza would've killed both of them. Mariko and Wolverine then went their separate ways.

* It was confirmed by producer Lauren-Shuler Donner that Mariko will be a main character in the upcoming film X-Men Origins: Wolverine 2.
