She meets the X-Men when they return from a sojourn in the [[Savage Land]] and are asked to help Japan, which is being blackmailed by the terrorist [[Moses Magnum]]. She becomes [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine's]] fianc√©e, but their wedding is halted by the supervillain [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]], who uses a mind control device to change Mariko's mind.
