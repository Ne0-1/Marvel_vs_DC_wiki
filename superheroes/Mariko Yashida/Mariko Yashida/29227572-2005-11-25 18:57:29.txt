'''Mariko Yashida''' was a [[fictional character]] affiliated with the [[X-Men]]. She first appeared in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #118 (February, [[1979]]), created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne]].

She was a daughter of [[Shingen Harada]], half-sister of the [[Silver Samurai]], cousin of [[Sunfire]] and [[Sunpyre]]. She was also the latest fianc√©e of [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]. She was head of a [[Yakuza]] crime family.

She was poisoned with [[tetrodotoxin]] by her rival [[Matsuo Tsurayaba]] in ''Wolverine'' vol. 2 #57 (July, [[1992]]). She asked Wolverine to [[Euthanasia|kill her]] to avoid a painful death. Wolverine killed her and vowed to [[avenge]] Mariko by yearly severing parts of Matsuo's body on the anniversary of her death. 

When last seen in ''Wolverine'' vol. 2 #175 (June, [[2002]]), Matsuo was missing an [[arm]], his right [[ear]], his [[nose]] and his [[gallbladder]]. He was planning to beg Wolverine for release through [[suicide]]. Wolverine never arrived since he was having a [[near-death experience]] in [[Canada]]. Whether Wolverine continues to honor the memory of Mariko by [[Mutilation|mutilating]] Matsuo is uncertain.
