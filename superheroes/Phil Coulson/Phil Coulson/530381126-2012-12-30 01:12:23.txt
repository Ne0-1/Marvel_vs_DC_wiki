==Appearances==

===Film===

====''Iron Man''====
{{Main|Iron Man (film)}}
Agent Coulson attends the press conference [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] ([[Robert Downey, Jr.]]) holds after returning from captivity in [[Afghanistan]]. Coulson talks to Stark's assistant, [[Pepper Potts]] ([[Gwyneth Paltrow]]), and introduces himself as a government agent of the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.|Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement, and Logistics Division]].  He tells her that he needs to discuss the [[Iron Man's armor|circumstances]] of Stark's escape, and they schedule an appointment. He is present when Tony announces that [[Stark Industries]] will cease production of weapons.

Coulson later meets Stark at the [[Walt Disney Concert Hall]], trying again to discuss the escape with him. However, Stark is distracted by Christine Everhart ([[Leslie Bibb]]), and leaves to end the [[Mandarin (comics)|Ten Rings]]' terrorism of [[Ho Yinsen|Gulmira]], [[War in Afghanistan (2001-present)|Afghanistan]].

Later on, Coulson arrives to his appointment with Pepper Potts, where she informs him of [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane]]'s ([[Jeff Bridges]]) armor. He and several other agents accompany her to the building housing Stark's arc reactor, where they find that Stane's armor is already active. Coulson manages to escape alive.

As a running gag, when Coulson attempts to speak with either Potts or Stark, he always says the agency's full name, only for them to comment on how the organization needs a shorter name. At the end, Coulson presents Stark with a [[wikt:cover story|cover story]] involving [[Happy Hogan|Stark's bodyguard]] ([[Jon Favreau]]) and a yacht.  When Pepper goes to say the agency's full name, Coulson interrupts her, saying, "Just call us S.H.I.E.L.D."  Coulson attends the press conference where Stark fumbles through the cover story before revealing his true identity as Iron Man.

====''Iron Man 2''====
{{Main|Iron Man 2}}
After Tony loses one of his armored suits to [[War Machine|James Rhodes]] ([[Don Cheadle]]), S.H.I.E.L.D Director [[Nick Fury]] ([[Samuel L. Jackson]]) places Tony on house arrest to sober up and find a replacement for [[palladium]] in his arc reactor. Coulson is one of the agents, briefly along with [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Natasha Romanoff]] ([[Scarlett Johansson]]), assigned to supervise Stark. Coulson threatens to [[Taser|tase]] Stark and watch ''[[Supernanny]]'' if he doesn't cooperate.<ref name="WNBC" /> He presents Tony with the work of [[Howard Stark]] ([[John Slattery]]), who was Tony's father and a S.H.I.E.L.D founder. Before he departs, Coulson assists Tony by drawing his attention to a partial model of [[Captain America's shield]], which Tony uses as a shim for a particle accelerator and manages to synthesize a [[vibranium|new element]] with [[ununoctium|atomic number 118]].

In a [[post-credits scene]], Coulson observes an impact crater in the [[New Mexico]] desert. He calls Fury and says, "We've found it." The final shot shows a [[Mjolnir (comics)|hammer]] lying in the crater.

====''Thor''====

In ''Thor'', S.H.I.E.L.D. appears to investigate the discovery of the [[Thor (comics)|title character]]'s [[Mjolnir (comics)|hammer]] on Earth. Coulson interrogates [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] ([[Chris Hemsworth]]) after the depowered Asgardian attacks a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility that has been erected around the recently-discovered hammer, commenting that Thor has effortlessly defeated some of his best men and asking where Thor received his training. S.H.I.E.L.D. confiscates [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]]'s ([[Natalie Portman]]) research about the dimensional anomaly that brought Thor to Earth (later revealed as [[Bifröst]]), but when Thor's powers are restored Agent Coulson agrees to return Jane's research to her and Thor assures the "Son of Coul" that they will be allies in the defense of Earth's innocent inhabitants. Coulson appears alongside S.H.I.E.L.D. agents [[Jasper Sitwell]] (Maximiliano Hernández), [[Hawkeye (comics)|Clint Barton]] ([[Jeremy Renner]]), Cale (Patrick O'Brien Demsey), Garrett (Dale Godboldo), and Director Nick Fury.

====''The Avengers''====
{{Main|The Avengers (2012 film)}}

When Steve Rogers initially dismisses the uniform (and himself) as "old-fashioned", Coulson comments that "the world could use a little old-fashioned." He is initially responsible for recruiting Tony Stark to the Avengers. At [[Stark Tower]] it is revealed that Pepper Potts is on a first-name basis with Coulson, while Stark, still feeling uneasy with S.H.I.E.L.D. interfering with his life from time to time, jokingly refers to Coulson's first name as "Agent". He is also in a long-distance relationship with a cellist; at one point Stark offers to fly Coulson to Portland to see her.

--> In the film, Coulson is last seen attempting to combat [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] ([[Tom Hiddleston]]). When Coulson threatens an illusion of Loki with a large energy weapon (revealed in the tie-in comic ''The Avengers: Fury's Big Week'' to be a reverse-engineered version of the [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]] made into a handheld weapon), the actual Loki stabs him from behind, before ejecting the horrified Thor, who was unable to help Coulson, from the [[Helicarrier]]. Coulson tells Loki he will lose as he lacks conviction, and then uses the weapon to blast Loki through a wall. Coulson speaks briefly with Fury and is then seen falling into a non-responsive state as paramedics approach, his last words being to note that the heroes needed something to avenge; Fury relays over the radio that paramedics have called time of death, though they are not shown doing so onscreen. Fury later uses Coulson's death as a way of igniting a pro-active spark in his disheartened team, though Fury's "push" (Coulson's bloodstained Captain America trading cards) is pointed out by [[Maria Hill]] ([[Cobie Smulders]]) as a fabrication (having come from Coulson's locker rather than his jacket, as stated).  Stark later acknowledges his respect for Coulson in his confrontation with Loki, calling the fallen agent by his real name for the first time: having previously informed Loki that he has angered the other five Avengers, Stark subsequently informs Loki, "And there's one other person you pissed off. His name <!--PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE "is" TO "was". DESPITE THE CHARACTER'S DEATH, THE QUOTE STILL REFERS TO HIM IN PRESENT TENSE.-->is Phil."<!--

Before the release of ''The Avengers'' Gregg stated, "I'm talking to them about doing ''[[Iron Man 3]]'' right now, and somebody's going 'Maybe Agent Coulson should die', and I'm like, 'Hey, hey, hey!

===Short films===
{{Main|Marvel One-Shots}}
In August 2011, Marvel announced that Coulson would be the subject of a couple of [[direct-to-video]] [[short film]]s called "Marvel One-Shots". The "Marvel One-Shots" both star Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson, offering up two self-contained stories about a day in the life of a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent. Gregg stated of the short films, "Some [would be] the connective tissue between the movies [of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]] and others are behind-the-scenes in the day of a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent... In one of them there's a daily crisis [in which] a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent deals with the World Security Council and one of our super heroes." The first short film, entitled ''Marvel One-Shot: The Consultant'', was released on the ''Thor'' [[Blu-ray]] and [[Blu-ray 3D]] on September 13, 2011, and takes place after the plots of ''Iron Man 2'', ''Thor'', and involves the ending to ''The Incredible Hulk''. The second film, titled ''Marvel One-Shot: A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer...'', which takes place after Coulson leaves Tony Stark's lab during ''Iron Man 2'', and before he arrives solo at the crater site in ''Thor'', was released  on the Blu-ray edition of ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]''.

====''The Consultant''====
Coulson walks into a restaurant where Agent Sitwell is eating breakfast, and informs him that the World Security Council wishes [[Abomination (comics)|Emil Blonsky]] released from prison to join the [[The Avengers (2012 film)|Avengers Initiative]], as they see him as a war hero, and blame his fight in [[New York City]] with [[Hulk (comics)|Bruce Banner]] on Banner himself. They order S.H.I.E.L.D. to send an agent to ask [[Thunderbolt Ross|General Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross]] ([[William Hurt]]) to release Blonsky into their custody. Nick Fury then tasks them with finding a way to follow their given orders, without actually obtaining Blonsky. The two agents consider sending a patsy to sabotage the meeting, so Ross will refuse to release Blonsky. Coulson suggests an alternate option, they send someone who will annoy and offend the general so much he will refuse to turn Blonsky over. At Sitwell's urging, Coulson reluctantly sends the consultant: [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] ([[Robert Downey, Jr.]]). As partially depicted in the end scene of ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'', a disgraced Ross sits drinking in a bar, when he is approached by Stark, who ends up annoying Ross so much that Ross tries to have him removed from the bar. In reply, Stark buys the bar, and schedules it for demolition. The next day at the restaurant, Sitwell arrives to Coulson eating breakfast. Coulson informs him that their plan worked, and that Blonsky will remain in prison.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lytherus.com/2011/09/01/the-consultant-marvels-first-between-movie-avengers-short-leaked-online|title=The Consultant Marvels First Between-Movie Avengers Short Leaked Online Watch It Now!|last=Krah|first=Jackie|publisher=Lytherus|date=2011-09-01|accessdate=2011-09-17}}</ref>

====''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer''====
Coulson is on his way to Albuquerque, New Mexico, when he stops to refill on gas. As he heads inside the gas station to pay, he decides to get some snacks, and makes his way to the back of the station to decide what he wants. Two robbers enter the station without noticing Coulson, and demand the money from the register. When the robbers ask whose car is outside, Coulson reveals himself, surrenders his keys, and offers to surrender his pistol as well. As he is about to surrender his pistol, Coulson distracts both robbers and quickly takes both of them down. He then nonchalantly pays for his snacks, subtly hints to the clerk that she take credit for subduing the criminals without mentioning his involvement, and leaves the station.

====''Item 47''====
Coulson's death is briefly mentioned by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents Sitwell and Blake.

==Characterization==
[[File:11.30.10ClarkGreggByLuigiNovi.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Clark Gregg]] ''(pictured)'' views Coulson as "''the'' S.H.I.E.L.D. agent".<ref name="shorts" />]]
In the films of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Agent Coulson is generally depicted as a supporting character of the protagonists and used to represent S.H.I.E.L.D.'s presence in the plots of the films, to the point that Clark Gregg has described Coulson as "''the'' S.H.I.E.L.D. agent". However, in the "Marvel One-Shots", Coulson is given "a chance to stand in his own spotlight for once", when the character is put in a position where there is an imminent threat and no superheroes around. The decision to give more focus to Coulson was "a natural" for "Marvel One-Shot" co-producer Brad Winderbaum:<ref name="shorts" />
{{quote|First and foremost it was an opportunity to work with Clark Gregg. The guy elevates everything he takes part in and we knew that if he was into it, we couldn't pass up the opportunity to tell some stand-alone Coulson stories with him. Also, in the case of ''The Consultant'', we wanted to paint a picture of S.H.I.E.L.D. pulling the strings and being responsible for some of the events we've seen in the films. What better character to represent this idea than Agent Coulson, the first S.H.I.E.L.D. agent we were introduced to in the first ''Iron Man'' film. {{sic}}<ref name="shorts" />}}
Gregg has stated, "I think of Agent Coulson, after all these years, as a guy with a full life. I think every day he's somewhere doing something for S.H.I.E.L.D., and yet I don't always know what that is... There's always a different twist. In this one he gets to show more of his wisecracking wit, and in this one he's a little bit more of a badass."<ref name="shorts" /> Despite Coulson being called "the most recognizable face in the Marvel Comics movie universe", he is depicted as an "[[everyman]]" in a universe full of superheroes–"the glue that binds" the characters together. In ''Thor'', Coulson complains that Tony Stark "never tells [him] anything," while in ''The Avengers'', Stark shows his disdain for [[G-Man (slang)|G-Men]] (as well as some degree of jealousy of Pepper Potts' very amiable treatment of him) by insisting that Coulson's first name is "Agent" rather than "Phil". In an interview with [[WNBC]], Gregg explained his portrayal of the character as "just a guy grumbling about his job":<ref name="WNBC" />
{{quote|He's the guy who's tasked - a very disciplined guy in my opinion who possesses secrets that would turn your hair white - but at the same time he's tasked with handling these kind of diva superheroes, you know? "Oh, really, Asgard? Dude, just get in the car."<ref name="WNBC" />}}
