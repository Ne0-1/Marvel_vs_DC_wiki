==Marvel Cinematic Universe==
===Films===
{{Main|Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man 2|Thor (film)|The Avengers (2012 film)}}
Agent Coulson was introduced in the film ''Iron Man'', in which he attempted to debrief [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] on his captivity in [[Afghanistan]]. Coulson is one of several agents who accompany [[Pepper Potts]] in an attempt to arrest [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane]] once his criminal activities are revealed. Coulson reappeared in ''Iron Man 2'', where he is assigned to supervise Stark for a time before being reassigned to investigate a crisis in New Mexico. In both the film's [[post-credits scene]] and ''Thor'', Coulson's assignment is revealed to revolve around the discovery of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'s [[Mjolnir (comics)|hammer]] in the New Mexico desert. Coulson interrogates Thor after the depowered [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] attacks the S.H.I.E.L.D. facility that was erected around the hammer, believing him to be a mercenary. In ''Marvel's The Avengers'', Coulson is revealed to be a fan of [[Captain America]], with a deck of vintage [[trading cards]]. Coulson is later fatally wounded by [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], and Fury uses Coulson's death to motivate the Avengers to fight together.

===Television===
{{Main|Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.}}
In ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'', Coulson is revealed to be the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent in charge of Project T.A.H.I.T.I., which was meant to bring a potential dead Avenger back to life using a drug derived from an ancient alien corpse. However, test patients developed psychosis and [[hypergraphia]], so Coulson had the project shut down. Following Coulson's death, S.H.I.E.L.D. Director [[Nick Fury]] resurrected him using Project T.A.H.I.T.I., despite the risks, and had Coulson's memories of the project replaced so that he could move on with a healthy life. Coulson puts together a team of agents, and they travel the world dealing with strange new cases. During this time, [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] [[Captain America: The Winter Soldier#Plot|reveals that it has infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D.]], leading to the latter's demise. Fury makes Coulson the new Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., and tasks him with rebuilding the agency "the right way". Coulson's involvement with alien materials leads to S.H.I.E.L.D. agents with distrust of secrets and the superhuman attempting to take over the fledgling organization, but Coulson convinces them to let him stay on as Director after helping [[Avengers: Age of Ultron|save hundreds of civilians]], and together they defeat a faction of [[Inhumans]], with Coulson losing a hand in the process. Coulson later becomes romantically involved with Rosalind Price, the leader of an anti-Inhuman government taskforce, until her death at the hands of Grant Ward, one of Coulson's former agents. He gets revenge by crushing Ward's chest with his prosthetic hand.

===Short films===
{{Main|Marvel One-Shots}}
The Marvel One-Shot ''[[Marvel One-Shots#The Consultant|The Consultant]]'' takes place after ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'', and sees Coulson and Sitwell preventing [[Abomination (comics)|Emil Blonsky]] from being added to the Avengers roster. ''[[Marvel One-Shots#A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer|A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer]]'' shows Coulson getting into a scuffle on his way from Stark's lab in ''Iron Man 2'' to Thor's hammer in ''Thor''.

===Tie-in comics===
{{Main|Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-in comics}}
Coulson appears throughout the MCU tie-in comics in supporting roles, acting in the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent capacity that he does in the films.

==Concept and creation==
{{Quote box|quote = "Agent Coulson was one of the guys who wasn't really in the comic books, and he [had] a very kind of small role in ''Iron Man''. And I was just very lucky that they chose to expand that character and chose to put him more into the universe of it."|source=—Gregg on the character's expansion in ''Thor''<ref name="MTVThor"/>|width=33%|align=right}}
Phil Coulson was created by [[Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby|Mark Fergus, Hawk Ostby]], [[Art Marcum and Matt Holloway]] for ''Iron Man'', the first film in the MCU.<ref name="April2006Variety" /><ref name="FergusOstbyIM" /> Coulson was the first S.H.I.E.L.D. agent introduced in the MCU, and was portrayed by [[Clark Gregg]], who went on to play the character in ''[[Iron Man 2]]'', ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'', and ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''.<ref name="shorts" />

In the Phase One films of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Agent Coulson is generally depicted as a supporting character of the protagonists and used to represent S.H.I.E.L.D.'s presence in the plots of the films, to the point that Clark Gregg has described Coulson as "''the'' S.H.I.E.L.D. agent". However, for the [[Marvel One-Shots]] ''[[Marvel One-Shots#The Consultant (2011)|The Consultant]]'' and ''[[Marvel One-Shots#A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer (2011)|A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer]]'', Coulson is given "a chance to stand in his own spotlight for once", when the character is put in a position where there is an imminent threat and no superheroes around. The decision to give more focus to Coulson was "a natural" for Marvel One-Shot co-producer Brad Winderbaum, who wanted to "paint a picture of S.H.I.E.L.D. pulling the strings and being responsible for some of the events we've seen in the films. What better character to represent this idea than Agent Coulson, the first S.H.I.E.L.D. agent we were introduced to[?]".<ref name="shorts"/>

At the 2012 [[New York Comic Con]], [[Joss Whedon]] and [[Kevin Feige]] announced that Gregg would be starring as Coulson in ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'', despite the character dying in ''The Avengers'', with Whedon saying "He's headlining the S.H.I.E.L.D. show and always was."<ref name="NYCC2012" /> Gregg said of Whedon's explanation for Coulson's resurrection, "I found it so fascinating and so true to the world of the comics and mythology in general as I understand them that I was immediately in."<ref name="GreggScreenRantApr2013" /> Regarding the amount of creative input he has over the character in the series, Gregg said, "I have meetings with [the [[showrunner]]s] once or twice a year and talk about what the big ideas are." Continuing, he added "They're really responsive to the fact that I've been involved with this person four, five years longer than them, but ... I have no complaints with what they're doing."<ref name="GreggCBRJan2015" />

There had been considerations for Coulson to return in ''[[Iron Man 3]]'' and ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'',<ref name="CraveOnline"/> but the character is not slated to appear in any more films.<ref name="ComingSoon"/> Whedon asserts, "As far as the fiction of the movies, Coulson is dead".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://mentalfloss.com/uk/movies/28527/qa-joss-whedon-on-super-heroes-the-pop-culture-mainstream|title = Q&A: Joss Whedon on Super Heroes, the Pop Culture Mainstream|last = Schwartz|first = Dana|publisher = Mental Floss|date = 15 April 2015|accessdate = 22 April 2015}}</ref>

==Characterization==
Gregg has stated, "I think of Agent Coulson, after all these years, as a guy with a full life. I think every day he's somewhere doing something for S.H.I.E.L.D., and yet I don't always know what that is... There's always a different twist. In this one he gets to show more of his wisecracking wit, and in this one he's a little bit more of a badass."<ref name="shorts"/> Despite Coulson being called "the most recognizable face in the Marvel Comics movie universe", he is depicted as an "[[everyman]]" in a universe full of superheroes—"the glue that binds" the characters together. Gregg explained his portrayal of the character as "just a guy grumbling about his job...he's tasked with handling these kind of diva superheroes, you know? "Oh, really, Asgard? Dude, just get in the car."<ref name="WNBC"/>

{{quote box|width=33%|align=left|quote=By being so front and center in ''Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' in a way that he wasn’t as much in the films...he’s gotten some power. He’s at the front lines, and what is the cost of that going to be?|source=–Gregg, on how starring in the television series can affect Coulson differently to appearing in the films.<ref name="GreggRebuilding" />}}
On whether the resurrected Coulson would be the same as before he died, Gregg said "I don’t know how you could not change going through what he went through. I think if he hadn’t gone through some kind of change, it wouldn’t be any good. That said, I don’t know if he understands how much he’s changed."<ref name="GreggScreenRantApr2013" /> Later exploring some of those changes, Gregg stated "In some ways, he kinda finds himself not nearly as cold or ruthless as he would like to be, or as he has been. And at the same time, putting together this team, he feels driven by motives inside of himself that he can't quite always make sense of and that feels very new to him."<ref name="GreggHitFixJan2014" /> After Coulson was promoted to Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., Gregg said "He kind of got his dream job that I don’t even think he would have ever dreamed he would be given....it’s going to require him to move a little bit in the direction of a more pragmatic figure like Nick Fury". Speaking about the evolving nature of Coulson's relationship with his team, Gregg said "There’s a way he can afford an intimacy with all of them when they’re part of a small, elite squad on the Bus. It’s different than what’s possible for him as Director of S.H.I.E.L.D."<ref name="GreggRebuilding" />

==Reception==
In his review for ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.''{{'}}s first season, Evan Valentine at Collider named Clark Gregg as one of the high points of the series, noting that the actor was "one positive I consistently point out in each and every episode". Valentine stated that "What made us fall in love with the character from the first ''Iron Man'' to his death in ''The Avengers'' is still alive and kicking. Coulson was able to throw out quips like none other, while also turning on a dime, and expressing serious rage in moments ... Gregg raises the S.H.I.E.L.D. banner high".<ref name="ColliderSeasonReview" /> Reviewing the episode "[[The Writing on the Wall (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|The Writing on the Wall]]", which concluded the majority of Coulson's storyline in the series up to that point, Kevin Fitzpatrick of Screen Crush praised how Coulson had become "unglued" throughout the series, which had "pushed the newly-minted director into some dark places".<ref name="Ep2.7ScreenCrush" /> Eric Goldman, reviewing for [[IGN]], was also positive of the "unhinged version of Coulson",<ref name="Ep2.7IGN" /> as well as the more serious leadership role the character took on for the [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 2)|second season]], with Goldman finding Coulson's decision in "[[Making Friends and Influencing People]]" that [[Blizzard (comics)|Donnie Gill]] "either went with them or had to be taken out" to be especially notable.<ref name="Ep2.3IGN" />
