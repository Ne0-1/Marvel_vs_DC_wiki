'''Phillip'''<!--Per his name tag in "The Avengers"--> "'''Phil'''" '''Coulson''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] portrayed by American actor [[Clark Gregg]] and presented in his likeness. The details of his character vary between portrayals, but he is always a spy working for the fictional espionage agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]. The character first appeared in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), a [[shared universe|shared]] [[fictional universe]] that is the setting of several [[superhero film|superhero films and television series]] produced by [[Marvel Studios]], and, due to his popularity, has gone on to appear in the mainstream [[Marvel Universe|Marvel Comics universe]], animated television series, video games, and more expanded media. Within the films, Coulson is generally used to represent S.H.I.E.L.D.'s involvement in the plot, to the point of being described as "''the'' S.H.I.E.L.D. agent" by Gregg.

The character originally appeared in ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008), the first film in the MCU. Gregg then signed a multi-picture deal with Marvel and the character went on to appear in ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' (2010), ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011), and ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012). He is a primary character of [[Marvel Television]]'s [[Ensemble cast|ensemble]] [[spy-fi]] series ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' (2013–), has appeared in two [[Marvel One-Shots]], and has been featured in multiple [[Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-in comics|tie-in comics]], all also set in the MCU.

==Characterization==
[[File:11.30.10ClarkGreggByLuigiNovi.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Clark Gregg]] views Coulson as "''the'' S.H.I.E.L.D. agent".<ref name="shorts" />]]
In the films of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Agent Coulson is generally depicted as a supporting character of the protagonists and used to represent S.H.I.E.L.D.'s presence in the plots of the films, to the point that Clark Gregg has described Coulson as "''the'' S.H.I.E.L.D. agent". However, in the "Marvel One-Shots", Coulson is given "a chance to stand in his own spotlight for once", when the character is put in a position where there is an imminent threat and no superheroes around. The decision to give more focus to Coulson was "a natural" for "Marvel One-Shot" co-producer Brad Winderbaum:<ref name="shorts" />
{{quote|First and foremost it was an opportunity to work with Clark Gregg. The guy elevates everything he takes part in and we knew that if he was into it, we couldn't pass up the opportunity to tell some stand-alone Coulson stories with him. Also, in the case of ''The Consultant'', we wanted to paint a picture of S.H.I.E.L.D. pulling the strings and being responsible for some of the events we've seen in the films. What better character to represent this idea than Agent Coulson, the first S.H.I.E.L.D. agent we were introduced to in the first ''Iron Man'' film. {{sic}}<ref name="shorts" />}}
Gregg has stated, "I think of Agent Coulson, after all these years, as a guy with a full life. I think every day he's somewhere doing something for S.H.I.E.L.D., and yet I don't always know what that is... There's always a different twist. In this one he gets to show more of his wisecracking wit, and in this one he's a little bit more of a badass."<ref name="shorts" /> Despite Coulson being called "the most recognizable face in the Marvel Comics movie universe", he is depicted as an "[[everyman]]" in a universe full of superheroes–"the glue that binds" the characters together. In ''Thor'', Coulson complains that Tony Stark "never tells [him] anything," while in ''The Avengers'', Stark shows his disdain for [[G-Man (slang)|G-Men]] (as well as some degree of jealousy of Pepper Potts' very amiable treatment of him) by insisting that Coulson's first name is "Agent" rather than "Phil". In an interview with [[WNBC]], Gregg explained his portrayal of the character as "just a guy grumbling about his job":<ref name="WNBC" />
{{quote|He's the guy who's tasked - a very disciplined guy in my opinion who possesses secrets that would turn your hair white - but at the same time he's tasked with handling these kind of diva superheroes, you know? "Oh, really, Asgard? Dude, just get in the car."<ref name="WNBC" />}}

==Marvel Cinematic Universe==

===Feature films===
{{Main|Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man 2|Thor (film)|The Avengers (2012 film)}} 
{{Quote box|quote = "Agent Coulson was one of the guys who wasn't really in the comic books, and he [had] a very kind of small role in ''Iron Man''. And I was just very lucky that they chose to expand that character and chosen to put him more into the universe of it. It's really a blast!... I get to do some exciting things in some of the new stuff."|source = — Gregg on the character's expansion in ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]''<ref name="MTVThor" />|width = 33%|align = right}}
Agent Coulson was introduced in ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'', in which he attempted to discuss the circumstances in which [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] ([[Robert Downey, Jr.]]) returned from captivity in [[Afghanistan]] with Stark and [[Pepper Potts]] ([[Gwyneth Paltrow]]). At the climax, Coulson is one of several agents who accompany Potts in an attempt to arrest [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane]] once his criminal activities are revealed. Coulson reappeared in the 2010 sequel, ''[[Iron Man 2]]''. After S.H.I.E.L.D. Director [[Nick Fury]] ([[Samuel L. Jackson]]) places Stark on house arrest in the film, Coulson is one of the agents assigned to supervise him. After presenting Tony with the work of his father [[Howard Stark]] ([[John Slattery]]), Coulson explains that he is reassigned to investigate a crisis in [[New Mexico]]. In both the film's post-credits sequence, and ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'', Coulson's investigation is revealed to be of the discovery of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'s ([[Chris Hemsworth]]) [[Mjolnir (comics)|hammer]] in a New Mexico desert alongside [[Jasper Sitwell]] (Maximiliano Hernández) and [[Hawkeye (comics)|Clint Barton]] ([[Jeremy Renner]]). Coulson interrogates Thor after the depowered Asgardian attacks the S.H.I.E.L.D. facility that was erected around the hammer, believing him to be a mercenary and demanding to know who he was working for. When Thor's powers are restored in the course of the film, he tells "Son of Coul" that they are allies.

Gregg reprised his role as Coulson in ''[[Marvel's The Avengers]]'', revealed to be both a fan of [[Captain America]] with a deck of vintage [[trading cards]] and the one who recruited Tony Stark as a candidate for the Avengers Initiative. At [[Stark Tower]] it is revealed that Pepper Potts is on a first-name basis with Coulson, while talking about a romantic affair between Coulson and a cellist who moved back home. Stark, still feeling uneasy with S.H.I.E.L.D. interfering with his life from time to time, jokingly refers to Coulson's first name as "Agent". However Stark, in personal conversation with Coulson, offers to fly the agent out to Portland to see the cellist he was dating. Coulson is killed by [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] ([[Tom Hiddleston]]) during his escape from the S.H.I.E.L.D. [[Helicarrier]]. Fury used Coulson's death to motivate and bring together the Avengers by showing them blood-splattered Captain America trading cards, although agent [[Maria Hill]] ([[Cobie Smulders]]) points out that the cards were not on Coulson at the time of his death and the blood is therefore artificial. Although director [[Joss Whedon]] is known for "killing off beloved characters", Gregg had previously stated that Whedon confirmed Coulson would survive the events of the film as revealed in ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' with his resurrection yet to be referenced in the Phase 2 films.

There had been considerations for Coulson to return in ''[[Iron Man 3]]'' and ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'',<ref name="CraveOnline" /><ref name="Comicbookmovie" /> but the character is not slated to appear in any more films. Whedon also stated that Coulson will not appear in ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]''.<ref name="ComingSoon" />

===Tie-in comics===
{{Main|Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-in comics}}
In 2010, Coulson made his comic book debut in the Marvel "[[digital comic|digicomic]]" ''Iron Man 2 - Phil Coulson: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #1,<ref name="IronMan2Coulson" /> which was later published in comic book form in November 2010. The comic was released as a tie-in to ''Iron Man 2'' and as such was set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], rather than the mainstream [[Marvel Universe|Earth-616 continuity]], in which most Marvel comics are set. He subsequently appeared as a supporting character in other comics set within the Cinematic Universe.

===Short films===
{{Main|Marvel One-Shots}}
In August 2011, Marvel announced that Coulson would be the subject of a series of [[direct-to-video]] [[short film]]s called "Marvel One-Shots". The first two star Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson in two self-contained stories depicting a day in the life of a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent. Gregg stated of the short films, "Some [would be] the connective tissue between the movies [of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]] and others are behind-the-scenes in the day of a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent... In one of them there's a daily crisis [in which] a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent deals with the World Security Council and one of our super heroes."

The first short film, entitled ''[[Marvel One-Shots#The Consultant|Marvel One-Shots: The Consultant]]'', was released on the ''Thor'' [[Blu-ray]] and [[Blu-ray 3D]] on September 13, 2011, and takes place after ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]''. In it, Coulson meets with Sitwell, another agent, and informs him that the World Security Council wishes for [[Abomination (comics)|Emil Blonsky]], ''The Incredible Hulk''{{'}}s villain, to be released from prison in order to join [[The Avengers (2012 film)|the Avengers]]. The Council see Blonsky as a hero and blame his fight with [[Hulk (comics)|Bruce Banner / the Hulk]] in [[New York City]]—seen at the end of the film—on Banner himself. They have ordered S.H.I.E.L.D. to ask [[Thunderbolt Ross|General Ross]] ([[William Hurt]]) for Blonsky's release. Nick Fury recognises that Blonsky would make a poor Avenger and has ordered Coulson and Sitwell to follow their orders in such a way that they do not actually obtain Blonsky. Coulson suggests sending in a consultant who will irritate and offend Ross so that he does not hand over Blonsky. Reluctantly, Coulson sends in [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] ([[Robert Downey, Jr.]]). The scene between Stark and Ross was partially depicted in the final scene of ''The Incredible Hulk'', in which it gave the impression that Stark was recruiting Banner. It is continued here and Stark is shown to irritate Ross so much that he asks for him to be removed. In response, Stark buys the bar and schedules it for demolition. Coulson informs Sitwell that the plan was successful: Blonsky will remain in prison.

The second film, titled ''[[Marvel One-Shots#A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer|Marvel One-Shots: A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer]]'' which takes place after Coulson leaves Tony Stark's lab during ''Iron Man 2'', and before he arrives solo at the crater site in ''Thor'', was released on the Blu-ray edition of ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]''. Coulson is on his way to Albuquerque, New Mexico, when he stops at a [[Roxxon Oil]] gas station. Two robbers enter the station without noticing Coulson, and demand the money from the register. When the robbers ask whose car is outside, Coulson reveals himself and surrenders his keys. As he is surrendering his gun, he overpowers the robbers and nonchalantly pays for his gas and snacks, suggesting to the cashier not to mention his involvement.

Further One-Shots featuring other characters have since been produced. The first of these was ''[[Marvel One-Shots#Item 47|Marvel One-Shots: Item 47]]'' (2012), during the course of which S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent Blake accidentally referred to colleague Sitwell as "Coulson". Sitwell responded with: "We all miss him."

===Television===
{{Main|Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.}}
Gregg reprises the role of Coulson as the lead protagonist of the television series ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.''.<ref name="S.H.I.E.L.D." /><ref name="S.H.I.E.L.D. 2" /> In the [[Pilot (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|pilot episode]] of the series, Phil Coulson explains that he was immediately resuscitated by S.H.I.E.L.D. medics after dying at the hands of Loki and sent to recover in [[Tahiti]] while Nick Fury used his apparent death to motivate the Avengers to work as a team during the Battle of New York. Returning to service, Coulson is placed in charge of a large S.H.I.E.L.D.-upgraded military transport plane and given free rein to assemble a small team of his own. However, a conversation between Maria Hill (Smulders) and S.H.I.E.L.D. medic Dr. Streiten ([[Ron Glass]]) reveals that Coulson does not know the whole truth concerning his survival.<ref name="Pilot" /><ref name="Pilot2" /> In subsequent episodes, Coulson begins to question how he survived the incident, and is troubled to learn that all records related to his injury and recovery can only be accessed by Fury's authorization. In "The Magical Place", while kidnapped by 'Project Centipede', a [[supersoldier]] development program under the direction of the mysterious 'Clairvoyant', Coulson learns his captors are also interested in learning more about his death. After they subject him to a mind-probing device, he discovers his memories had been altered by S.H.I.E.L.D. and that he was brought back to life by S.H.I.E.L.D. surgeons days after he was killed by Loki. In "T.A.H.I.T.I.", Coulson tracks down the facility where he was resurrected&mdash;as part of Project T.A.H.I.T.I.&mdash;after becoming desperate to save the life of his teammate [[Daisy Johnson|Skye]] ([[Chloe Bennet]]) by the same method. He discovers that the drug that brought him back to life, known as GH-325, is of alien origin. In the episode "Turn, Turn, Turn", which ties into the events of ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'', he discovers that his teammate and longtime friend Melinda May ([[Ming-Na Wen]]) was assigned by Fury to monitor him, and designed the specifications for his team.

In that same episode, Coulson learns the evil organization [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|Hydra]] had infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D., and his old friend Agent John Garrett ([[Bill Paxton]]) is revealed to be both a Hydra agent and the Clairvoyant. In the resulting chaos, S.H.I.E.L.D. effectively disbands as they are now seen as terrorists, but Coulson and his team remain together and take refuge in a secret S.H.I.E.L.D. base in Canada, in "Providence". In "The Only Light in the Darkness", Coulson protects his cellist former lover Audrey ([[Amy Acker]]) from a supercriminal named [[Blackout (comics)|Marcus Daniels]] (Patrick Brennan) who was released from S.H.I.E.L.D. confinement by Hydra. In "Nothing Personal", the Providence base is compromised and later May obtains and shares with Coulson a confidential flash drive by Fury concerning Project T.A.H.I.T.I.. Coulson is shocked to find video footage of himself addressing Fury on the drive, suggesting he was in charge of T.A.H.I.T.I. before his death. In his report, Coulson advises the project be shut down, as subjects treated with GH-325 all exhibit mental disorders ranging from [[aphasia]] to full-blown [[psychosis]] except in cases where their memories of treatment have been suppressed. In the season finale, "Beginning of the End", Coulson infiltrates Garrett's base with support from Nick Fury (Jackson) himself, and his team defeat Garrett and Ward and shut down Hydra's [[Deathlok]] program. Ward is arrested, and after attempting to escape confinement, Coulson disintegrates Garrett with the newly recovered [[Infinity Gems|Tesseract]]-powered [[raygun]]. After announcing his plan to go undercover for a while, Fury hands Coulson the 'toolbox', a small cube containing coordinates and a few other things, and appoints Coulson the new Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. with a mandate to rebuild the organization from the ground up. One night at their new base, the Playground, Coulson begins carving out a detailed diagram on the wall just as Garrett had done after taking GH-325.

In the second season premiere, "[[Shadows (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Shadows]]", Coulson is revealed to have been busy for months meeting with former S.H.I.E.L.D. agents in order to recruit them for his reconstituted S.H.I.E.L.D. However, Hydra infiltration, agents turning freelance, and detention of agents by the U.S. military have hampered his efforts. After discovering that the so-called Absorbing Man, [[Absorbing Man|Carl Creel]] ([[Brian Patrick Wade]]), was seeking a dangerous ancient relic on behalf of Hydra, he deploys all available field operatives to infiltrate [[brigadier general (United States)|U.S. brigadier general]] [[Glenn Talbot]] ([[Adrian Pasdar]])'s base. They fail to recover the artifact, but do steal back cloak-capable [[quinjet]]s. In "[[Heavy is the Head]]", Coulson personally defeats Creel, recruits mercenary [[Lance Hunter]] ([[Nick Blood]]) for S.H.I.E.L.D., and convinces Talbot to scale back the United States' harassment of the new S.H.I.E.L.D. It is also revealed that Coulson has been having recurring episodes of carving the mysterious diagram. In the episode "The Writing on the Wall", Coulson subjects himself to the mind probing device and discovers that six other S.H.I.E.L.D. agents underwent Project T.A.H.I.T.I., all of whom had complete mental breakdowns after being healed by GH-325. Coulson relives his own breakdown after being revived with GH-325, but later discovers that the carvings he and the other T.A.H.I.T.I. subjects were creating were actually a blueprint to a mysterious city. Coulson regains his sanity once he comes to this revelation and he and his S.H.I.E.L.D. team make it their mission to find this city before Hydra does.

===Animation===
[[File:Agent Coulson on Ultimate Spider-Man.jpg|thumb|Principal Phil Coulson on ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'']]
* It was announced at the 2011 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] that Gregg would return to voice Phil Coulson in the [[cartoon series]] ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', where he appears as both a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent and [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]]'s school [[Head teacher|principal]].<ref name="Toonzone" /><ref name="IGNUltimateSpider" /> The character design is based on Gregg's appearance in the Marvel Cinematic Universe continuity, although the series itself takes place in an independent universe and is therefore not part of the MCU. Coulson's first appearance in ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' was in "Great Responsibility", where he tries to persuade [[Nick Fury]] not to include [[Spider-Man]] as a member of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], due to Spider-Man's actions and personality, calling Spider-Man a ''wild card''. Fury disagrees, saying that's he's training Spider-Man to be "one of the greats". Coulson's role is increased later in the series, as Spider-Man attempts to leave S.H.I.E.L.D. His superhero allies [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], [[Nova (Sam Alexander)|Nova]], [[Luke Cage|Power Man]] and [[White Tiger (comics)|White Tiger]] enroll in Peter's school Midtown High and Coulson becomes his principal. Coulson and the superheros' presence at the school is a way for Fury to monitor Peter. Coulson remains as Peter's principal and in "Attack of the Beetle", he holds a parent-teacher conference with Peter's guardian, [[Aunt May]], and the two go to dinner, which a perturbed Peter tries to disrupt. Coulson confesses to have a romantic interest in May to Peter, but the [[Beetle (comics)|Beetle]] disrupts their conversation. Later, May insists that she will not take up a romantic relationship if Peter does not approve, but she talks to Peter and changes her mind. The episode ends with Coulson and Aunt May going out for dessert. In "The Next Iron Spider," it is revealed that Phil Coulson is away on a mission and that Stan the Janitor is covering for Phil Coulson as the acting principal until he returns.

* Coulson makes a by-name cameo appearance in the ''[[Iron Man: Armored Adventures]]'' episode "Extremis" as one of the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents encountering (and getting knocked down by) the just-mutated renegade agent [[Mallen (comics)|Mallen]].<ref name="IronManAAExtremis" />

* In 2014, the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate]] version of Phil Coulson debuted in the ''[[Ultimate Fantastic Four|Ultimate FF]]'' series that was cancelled after six issues.<ref name="newsarama" />

* He has appeared in [[Deadpool]] when agent Preston of S.H.I.E.L.D was killed and to save her, her mind was place along-side Deadpool's own. Coulson helped put her into a Life Model Decoy(LMD) of her own body and made sure Deadpool was paid for his earlier services to S.H.I.E.L.D in taking down the living dead presidents of U.S.A. He paid Deadpool as Deadpool asked- The money stuffed in a pillow case with a green dollar sign on it. He also appeared in Deadpool's first Bi-annual helping Deadpool team-up with Brute Force- A team of genetically modified intelligent super animals. Deadpool calls him asking for help and he seems to be on a beach much like T.A.H.I.T.I.

*In July 2014 at San Diego Comic Con International, Marvel Comics announced an ongoing series titled ''S.H.I.E.L.D.'', to be set in the mainstream Marvel Universe, and written by Mark Waid, beginning December 2014.

The series is led by Agent Phil Coulson, and will see the canonical introduction of characters that originated from ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D]]'', to which Waid said, "This is our chance to introduce a lot of the other characters into the Marvel Universe, and give them the Marvel Universe spin." Waid described the series as "done-in-one. Coulson and his team have a mission, and if we need someone for a mission, everyone in the Marvel Universe is available as a potential Agent."
