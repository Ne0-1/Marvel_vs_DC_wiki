'''Commander Kraken''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]].

==Fictional character biography==
Commander Kraken was a self-styled modern-day [[pirate]] who first encountered and fought [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]].  He later underwent plastic surgery which drastically altered his appearance, sold his services to [[HYDRA]] and became their Naval Action Division Leader.  He fought Namor and [[Iron Man]] but lost against them.

Later, Commander Kraken was invited to a meeting organized by Gary Gilbert, who wanted to discuss counter-measures against the threat by the [[Scourge of the Underworld]] at the "Bar With No Name". Kraken attended and was shot dead along with all the other criminals present by the Scourge himself, who had infiltrated the meeting as the bartender.

==Abilities and Equipment==
Commander Kraken had a hook on his left hand that was capable of emitting an electrical shock, but HYDRA later replaced this with a functional bionic hand.  His left leg was also bionic, and allowed him to fly.  His electro-sword was capable of firing electricity and could reflect force and energy attacks.

Commander Kraken also used squid-shaped submarines with tentacles.
