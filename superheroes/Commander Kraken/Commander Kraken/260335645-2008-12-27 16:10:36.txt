Later, Commander Kraken was invited to a meeting organized by Gary Gilbert, who wanted to discuss counter-measures against the threat by the [[Scourge of the Underworld]] at the "Bar With No Name". Kraken attended and was shot dead along with all the other criminals present by the Scourge himself, who had infiltrated the meeting as the bartender.
