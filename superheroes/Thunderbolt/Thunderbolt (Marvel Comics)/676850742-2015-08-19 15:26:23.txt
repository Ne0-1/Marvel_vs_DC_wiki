William Carver was born in [[Harlem]], New York. Returning to Harlem after military service, William was approached by several members of a local violent street gang named the Thunderbolts, eager to have William in their group for his military training. Carver refused, and the next day went to work as an assistant district attorney under then-District Attorney Franklin Nelson. When Nelson learned of the Carver's encounter with the Thunderbolts gang, he instructed Carver to infiltrate them to gather enough information about their illegal activities to shut them down. Carver helped gather enough evidence to send several members to prison.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Months later, William's younger brother Lonnie Carver was gunned down in front of him. At the funeral, William spotted Lonnie's murderer and chased him through the cemetery. As the two men struggled, a bolt of lightning hit them, killing the sniper instantly. Carver was saved by an experimental cobalt radiation treatment during which he was unintentionally exposed to an unusual amount of radiation. The radiation mutated his body to give him the ability to move at superhuman speeds and enhanced his reflexes. Carver began a career as a costumed crime-fighter, calling himself Thunderbolt after his first criminal enemies, and tried to discover who had ordered Lonnie's assassination.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Carver soon discovered that the radiation he was exposed to sped up not only his reflexes, but his aging, as he was now aging at a rate of several years per week. Carver tracked down his old ally, [[Luke Cage|Power Man]] and Cage's ally [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] to help him find Lonnie's killer. They discovered that it had been attorney "Big" Ben Donovan, whose younger brother Paul had been one of the Thunderbolts gang members that William Carver sent to prison. Paul Donovan was killed in prison, and Big Ben blamed Carver for his death, sending an assassin to kill William's brother Lonnie in revenge.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

After his confession, Big Ben Donovan pulled a gun on Thunderbolt. As the two men struggled, the gun went off and accidentally killed Donovan. Thunderbolt's mission completed, he succumbed to his body's rapid aging and died, content that his brother's murder had been avenged.<ref>''Power Man/Iron Fist'' #62</ref>

Luis Barrett had somehow obtained superhuman speed while in high school. He came from a poor family and knows that he wouldn't obtain scholarship after he graduates. [[Justin Hammer]] later learned of Luis' powers and sent Barrier, [[Whiplash (comics)|Blacklash]], and [[Ringer (comics)|Ringer]] II to bring Luis to him. Justin Hammer gave William Carver's Thunderbolt costume to Luis Barrett so that he can convince him to join Hammer's criminal enterprises in exchange for funding his college scholarship. When members of the [[Pantheon (Marvel Comics)|Pantheon]] warned Luis of Hammer's intentions, Luis turned against Justin Hammer's villain allies during a plot to steal an experimental plane from [[Air Force One]] base. Ringer bound Thunderbolt's legs during the fight. Before Blacklash could attack Thunderbolt, he managed to take out Blacklash despite the fact that his legs were bound. Although Luis was left with no other means of going to college, [[Ulysses (Pantheon)|Ulysses]] noted that Luis is now on the right track.<ref>''Incredible Hulk Annual'' #17</ref>

Luis is being considered as a "potential recruit" for the [[Fifty State Initiative|Initiative]] program, according to ''Civil War: Battle Damage Report''.
