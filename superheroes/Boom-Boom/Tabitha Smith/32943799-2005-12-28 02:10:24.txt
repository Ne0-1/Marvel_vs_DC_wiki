==History==
===Origin===
Tabitha Smith was born to Marty Louis Smith and Mandy Smith, in [[Roanoke, Virginia]]. Her parents were later divorced, her father was currently married to Wanda Jo Bialowsky. 

At thirteen, Tabitha Smith, had not gotten along with her parents for most of her life. Tabitha's [[mutant]] power to create balls of explosive concussive energy, emerged. Her parents discovered them, they were appalled. Resentful towards her father, Tabitha put a small explosive ball of energy in his lasagna. In retaliation, her father beat her severely. Soon after, Tabitha ran away, from home, to find [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]]'s [[X-Mansion|Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters]], in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester, NY]]. This was the beginning of a new life, for Tabitha that will never be the same.

On a train to [[New York]], Tabitha met the [[Beyonder]]. The two of them went to Xavier's school. At the school, Tabitha was terrified when the teams of the [[X-Men]] and the [[New Mutants]] fought the Beyonder. Before that event, Tabitha never saw that much power and people fighting, in one place. The Beyonder took her to a planet, where the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]] were located. Fearful of the battle taking place between the Beyonder and the Celestials, Tabitha demaned to be returned to [[Earth]]. When she returned, Tabitha contacted the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] about the Beyonder and lured him into a fight with the heroes.

===Fallen Angels===
Following the battle, Tabitha returned to traveling across the [[United States]]. During her travels, she met the teleporting criminal called the [[Vanisher]]. The Vanisher recruited her into the Fallen Angels, his gang of thieves, where she took up the codename Boom Boom. During her time with the gang, Tabith learned many things from the Vanisher, including how to steal. Tabitha eventually became unsure of the Vanisher. She called [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and the rest of [[X-Factor]], who the world to believed to be "mutant-hunters". Meeting with [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] and [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], Tabitha began to have second thoughts. With giving her situation more thought, Tabitha decided to leave and stay with X-Factor at their [[headquarters]].

After her initial encounter with Iceman, Tabitha used a "time bomb" on him as a [[prank]]. This incident began a series of pranks between the two of them, over the years. During her stay with X-Factor, a former teammate, [[Ariel (comics)|Ariel]], rescued her. Ariel is an alien with powers of instant transportation and psychic [[coercion]]. With the Fallen Angels back together, Ariel duped them into becoming captured by her planet's scientists to serve as experiments. Eventually, Ariel changed her mind and helped her teammates escape. After the ordeal, Tabitha and the team returned to Earth. After the members of the Fallen Angels went their seperate ways, she was kidnapped by the Right, an anti-mutant organization. Tabitha, X-Factor, and other mutants regained their freedom. Afterwards, Tabitha joined her fellow X-Factor trainees as the [[X-Terminators]].

===New Mutants & X-Force===
After the events of the [[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]] saga, Tabitha and some members of the X-Terminators joined the [[New Mutants]]. During her time with the New Mutants, Tabitha fell in love with a teammate, [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]]. She even stayed with the team, when a man named [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] came along and forged the team into a strike force team called [[X-Force]].

With the new change in the team status, she changed her codename again to Boomer. With Cable and his training, Tabitha possessed greater control over her abilities. She even became no longer afraid over her abilites and the danger of using them. When this happened, Tabitha changed her codename again to Meltdown.

When the team went into the world of [[espionage]] under the management of [[Pete Wisdom]], Meltdown gained a new expansion into her abilites. She learned to fire beams of concussive force. The team attempted to contiune his campaign, after Pete Wisdom was killed. Subsequently, the team faked their deaths while battling Pete's sister Romany Wisdom and Worldengine, an [[Extraterrestrial life|extra-terrestrial]] machine.

In ''Nextwave'', an upcoming comic book series created by [[Warren Ellis]] and [[Stuart Immonen]], the Highest Anti-Terrorism Effort, or H.A.T.E. (a subsidiary of the Beyond Corporation) formed a team to fight the Bizarre Weapons of Mass Destruction. The members are supposed to include Tabitha Smith, [[Monica Rambeau]], and [[Machine Man|Aaron Stack]].

==Powers==
Meltdown has the mutant power to create balls of energy of an unknown kind, which she calls her "time bombs". These "bombs" explode with concussive force. She can produce marble-sized "bombs" which have little concussive impact and which she uses for playing pranks. She has produced "time bombs" ranging up to the size of beach balls, which, when they explode, can smash tree trunks and even metal objects. Meltdown can control the amount of time between the creation of one of her "bombs" and the time it detonates. She can mentally muffle the sound of the detonation. She can also fire beams of concussive force.
