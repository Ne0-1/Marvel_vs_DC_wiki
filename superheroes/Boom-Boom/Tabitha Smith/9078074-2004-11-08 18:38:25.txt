'''Boom Boom''' (Tabitha Smith) or '''Meltdown''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[Marvel Comics]]. She has also been known as '''Time Bomb''' and '''Boomer'''.

== History == 

A thirteen year old girl named Tabitha Smith, nicknamed "Boom Boom", had not gotten along with her parents for most of her life. Tabitha's [[mutant]] power to create balls of explosive concussive energy, which she calls her "time bombs", emerged when she was thirteen, and when her parents discovered them, they were appalled. Resentful towards her father, Boom Boom put a small explosive ball of energy in his lasagna. In retaliation, her father beat her severely. Soon after, Tabitha ran away and came to find refuge at [[Professor X|Xavier]]'s Institute for Gifted Youngsters.

== Mutant Abilities == 

Boom Boom can create balls of energy of an unknown kind, which she calls her "time bombs". These "bombs" explode with concussive force. She can produce marble-sized "bombs" which have little concussive impact and which she uses for playing pranks. She has produced "time bombs" ranging up to the size of beach balls, which, when they explode, can smash tree trunks and even metal objects. To at least some extent Boom Boom can control the amount of time between the creation of one of her "bombs" and the time it detonates. She can also mentally muffle the sound of the detonation to a limited extent. The limits on her power to create and control his "time bombs" are as yet unknown.

==Television and film==

In the ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'' animated TV series Boom Boom was voiced by [[Megan Leitch]].
