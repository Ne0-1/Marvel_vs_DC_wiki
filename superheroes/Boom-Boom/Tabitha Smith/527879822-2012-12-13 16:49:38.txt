==Publication history==
Created by [[Jim Shooter]] and [[Al Milgrom]], the character first appeared in ''[[Secret Wars II]]'' #5 (November 1985). She next appears as a main character in the ''[[Fallen Angels (comics)|Fallen Angels]]'' limited series. This leads to her becoming a supporting character in the ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' series beginning with issue #11, which then leads to her becoming a member of the short-lived [[X-Terminators]] team in the ''X-Terminators'' limited series.  Following this series, she appears as a member of the [[New Mutants]] for the remainder of the ''New Mutants'' title; the team then became [[X-Force]] and she remained a member of the team for most of the ''X-Force'' series. Sometime later, she appears as a member of [[Nextwave]] throughout the ''Nextwave'' series.

==Fictional character biography==
{{In-universe|section|date=November 2009}}

===Early life===
Tabitha was born in [[Roanoke, Virginia]].  She is depicted as a rebellious but normal teenager in her first appearance. Daughter of divorced parents, Tabitha's [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] powers manifest at 13, and her parents immediately show their disgust, her father even beating her. She runs away from home, giving herself the alias "Time Bomb," and meets the cosmic entity known as the [[Beyonder]]. He brings her to [[Charles Xavier]], headmaster of the [[X-Mansion|School for Gifted Youngsters]], who ignores her to combat the Beyonder. Just before she can commit suicide over this second rejection, the Beyonder stops her, taking her with him on his cosmic trip. The Beyonder confronts the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]], and at her behest, returns Tabitha to Earth. She helps the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] ambush the Beyonder. She leaves the battlefield when she learns that the Beyonder felt betrayed by the actions of "his only friend."<ref>''Secret Wars II'' #5</ref>

===Fallen Angels===
Living on the streets, Tabitha becomes involved with Maurice "Tiger" Antonini and, after he threatens Tabitha and murders her friend Gina, she uses her powers to kill him. The villain known as the [[Vanisher]] then recruits her for his band of thieves, called the Fallen Angels, and she officially takes on her codename "Boom-Boom." She eventually betrays the Vanisher, calling in the help of [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], whom she stays with afterwards.<ref>''X-Factor'' #11</ref> Tabitha's former teammate in the Fallen Angels, the alien [[Ariel (comics)|Ariel]] kidnaps the Angels to her home planet, to be experimented on by her planet's scientists. Ultimately though, she can't go through with the plan and helps them escape. The Angels return to Earth and go their separate ways.<ref>''Fallen Angels'' #3-8</ref> Tabitha is kidnapped by the Right, an anti-mutant organization. Tabitha, X-Factor, and other mutants regain their freedom.<ref>''X-Factor'' #22-23</ref> Later, Tabitha joins her fellow X-Factor trainees as the [[X-Terminators]]. The team battles [[N'astirh]]'s demons.  During her tenure with the team, she convinces Rictor not to commit suicide.<ref>''X-Terminators'' #1-4</ref>

===''New Mutants''===
After the events of the [[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]] saga, Tabitha and some members of the X-Terminators, [[Rusty Collins|Rusty]], [[Skids (comics)|Skids]] and [[Rictor]], join the [[New Mutants]].<ref>''New Mutants'' #77</ref> During her time with the New Mutants, Tabitha falls in love with her teammate, [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]]. When the team is transported to the mythical realm of Asgard, it is partially through Tabitha that the team is able to foil a plot to kill [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]].<ref>''New Mutants'' #78</ref> They encounter the man known as [[Cable (comics)|Cable]],<ref>''New Mutants'' #89</ref> and when he starts to mentor the team, Tabitha gains greater control of her powers. Tabitha is captured by [[Stryfe]] and the [[Mutant Liberation Front]], but is rescued.<ref>''New Mutants'' #93-94</ref>

During "[[The X-Tinction Agenda]]" crossover, in which the mutant-hating country of [[Genosha]] begins attacking mutants in the United States in retaliation for an earlier fight with the X-Men, the Genoshan Magistrates kidnap Boom-Boom and some of her teammates, namely Rictor, Wolfsbane and Warlock, transporting them to Genosha.<ref>''New Mutants'' #95</ref> The incident receives international coverage, and Tabitha's father is even interviewed, still voicing his disgust for his daughter. Although stripped of their powers, she and Rictor manage to escape, whereas Wolfsbane had been processed as a mutate slave. Warlock does not survive. On the streets of Genosha, Rictor and Tabitha meet [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]], and Tabitha and Jubilee's similar attitudes clash. They eventually make their way to the Genoshan citadel, where the other X-Teams gather to defeat [[Cameron Hodge]], the villain who orchestrated the entire ordeal. Once returned to the United States, Tabitha spreads the ashes of her friend Warlock over the grave of Warlock's best friend [[Cypher (comics)|Doug Ramsey]], a New Mutant that had died.

===''X-Force''===
The New Mutants team, under the continued tutelage of Cable, is soon reformed into [[X-Force]].<ref>''New Mutants'' #100</ref> The team undergoes a revamp, employing new, more aggressive methods. During this time, Tabitha acts on her crush on Cannonball, and the two have a relationship. Although questioning the team's new methods, Tabitha sticks with the team, rechristening herself "Boomer." She battles the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] alongside her new team in one of their early missions.<ref>''X-Force'' #7, 9</ref>

During the "X-Cutioner's Song" crossover, the X-Men confront X-Force, whom they believe are involved in an attempted murder of [[Professor X]].{{Issue|date=January 2012}}  Boomer was defeated in combat by [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], and taken prisoner by X-Factor.<ref>''X-Force'' #16</ref> When her team is jailed by the X-Men, Cannonball chooses Tabitha to fight with him alongside the X-Men, against the [[Mutant Liberation Front]].{{Issue|date=January 2012}} Soon they discover that Rusty and Skids have joined the MLF, and Boomer's jaw is broken in combat by Skids.<ref>''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #15</ref> After this event, Tabitha is confronted by Cannonball's ex [[Lila Cheney]], who gives the couple her blessing.{{Issue|date=January 2012}} Showing how serious Cannonball is himself, he takes Tabitha along for a vacation on his family's farm, during which they are confronted by the [[Gamesmaster (comics)|Gamesmaster]] and the [[Upstarts (comics)|Upstarts]], and team up with the [[New Warriors]] to defeat them.{{Issue|date=January 2012}}

Eventually, the team's headquarters are blown up twice,{{Issue|date=January 2012}} and without a home the team moves back into Xavier's mansion.{{Issue|date=January 2012}} Shortly after, Cannonball graduates into becoming an X-Men member, and their relationship waters down.{{Issue|date=January 2012}} Seeking comfort, Tabitha spends most of her time caring for the lobotomized Sabretooth, also confiding in him.{{Issue|date=January 2012}} Her teammates attempt an unsuccessful intervention.{{Issue|date=January 2012}}

Sabretooth reveals that he's faking the ordeal however, and fully healed, escapes by deceiving Tabitha into destroying his bonds.{{Issue|date=January 2012}} In his escape, he eviscerates the X-Man [[Psylocke]], who barely survives her wounds.{{Issue|date=January 2012}}

[[Image:4604-64525-1-x-force 400.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Cover to ''X-Force'' #51, featuring the revamped Tabitha Smith. Art by [[Adam Pollina]].]]
In an effort to deal with the guilt from this incident, Tabitha travels home to visit her father.{{Issue|date=January 2012}} The two reconcile, but in a fight with [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]] and [[Holocaust (comics)|Holocaust]], her father is critically injured.{{Issue|date=January 2012}} With more guilt on her mind, Tabitha underwent a radical change, renaming herself "Meltdown," designing a new costume and gaining better control of her powers along with a more brash and assertive attitude.{{Issue|date=January 2012}} This new attitude is displayed by Meltdown when she fights the [[Blob (comics)|Blob]], threatening to kill him, and eventually having two time-bombs explode near his eardrums.{{Issue|date=January 2012}}

With Cannonball spending his time with the X-Men, Tabitha grows closer to [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]] and they begin a short-lived fling.<ref>''X-Force'' (vol. 1) #75</ref> Cannonball finds out and is initially angry but reconciles with both his friends, rejoining X-Force in the process.<ref>''X-Force'' (vol. 1) #76</ref> After an incident in which the [[High Evolutionary]] shut off all mutant powers, Tabitha and Cannonball come close to rekindling their relationship.<ref>''X-Force'' (vol. 1) #101</ref>

===Peter Wisdom===
In the meantime, the sudden power loss really hit home for Cannonball, as to just how little they had been doing lately to help mutant-kind. He got back in touch with [[Pete Wisdom]], and together they devised a plan for reactivating X-Force as a covert strike team. Meltdown, along with [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]] and [[Bedlam (comics)|Bedlam]], agreed to enter into this new arrangement, and they took up residence in an abandoned Nevada Hulkbuster base for extensive retraining for martial combat and the use of their powers. In particular, Tabitha learned how to direct the explosive force of her power into streams of guided energy, and was also heavily trained in computer hacking and manipulating digital information. The revamped X-Force fought the shadow wars that other people couldn't even see, against the likes of meat-spore storm-troopers, mutagenic bioreactors and assassins who carried the mutant gene for murder. After she almost lost Sam to that last threat, Meltdown confessed she couldn't bear to see him die, and the two of them became lovers again. While most of their missions were successful, they weren't without their share of troubles - Wisdom was apparently killed on their first mission back in San Francisco since leaving, and on two separate occasions their enemies tried to kill them in massive explosions.<ref>''X-Force'' (vol.1) #102 - #115</ref>

The team's undercover status turned out to be a weakness, though, for some new organization consisting of mutants that wanted to get rich and famous thought the name was up for grabs. After buying legal rights to use "X-Force" as their name, this group went public and soon became popular. When the original X-Force learned of this, they came out of hiding and confronted the new guys about the name and violating the original concept behind the team, it was already too late. Apparently, the original X-Force disbanded after this, retreating from their recent hardcore offensive stance on mutant issues. Sam and Tabitha also went their separate ways.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

===''Weapon X'' and the ''X-Force'' mini===
When [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] discovers hints regarding the existence of a revamped [[Weapon X]] program, one designed to use mutants to hunt down and intern other mutants, he creates an organization to investigate the program and the existence of its internment camp, Neverland. He dubs the organization the Underground, and invites Meltdown to join his elite group. Ultimately, Cable's Underground group is joined by Weapon X agent [[Brent Jackson]], who hopes to stage a coup against the project's Director and has formed his own resistance group with fellow agents [[Washout (comics)|Washout]], [[Marrow (comics)|Marrow]], [[Wild Child (comics)|Wild Child]], and [[Sauron (comics)|Sauron]]. Jackson betrays the Underground team however after the coup is successful and alters/wipes their memories of the events. {{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Sometime thereafter, Cable learns of another threat to mutant-kind, the voracious creatures known as the [[Skornn]], a creature that was going to threaten Earth. He gathers and reunites X-Force in order to deal with them. Meltdown is among the former members he recruits. While both Cannonball and Sunspot are also involved in the conflict, Tabitha’s feelings for either weren’t brought up. However, she reveals to have learned a new trick with her mutant powers when she channeled one of her time bombs through Shatterstar's blade straight into the chest of a seemingly unbeatable opponent. After the Skornn was also defeated, some of X-Force remains together, assisting Cable on Providence, an island nation he created. Afterwards, she helps them attack the headquarters of the Black Box, though the occupant turns out to be a robot. {{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Tabitha is one of the few mutants who retain her powers after the events of [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

===''Nextwave''===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Tabitha Smith.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Tabitha Smith character design, for the comic book ''[[Nextwave]].'' Art by [[Stuart Immonen]].]] -->
Shortly afterwards, after an initial period of wild arrogance, Tabitha seems to mellow out and settle back into her earlier, more bubbly personality. She even develops a tendency to use chat room-like short-hand when speaking out loud, such as "[[SMS language#Common acronyms|OMG]]," "ZOMG," and "OH NOES!"  She also begins to start saying "Tick, tick, tick, tick-- BOOM!" when using her powers. Tabitha also grows her hair long and eschewed her codename and re-appears as a founding member of [[Nextwave]], a new off-beat and more than slightly satirical super-hero team featured in an eponymous comic book series created by [[Warren Ellis]] and [[Stuart Immonen]]. The Highest Anti-Terrorism Effort, or [[H.A.T.E.]] (a subsidiary of the [[Beyond Corporation©]]) formed the team. Tabitha Smith's new team includes other second-string characters taken from Marvel limbo, including [[Monica Rambeau]] (formerly Captain Marvel, the leader of the Avengers), [[Elsa Bloodstone]], [[Machine Man|Aaron Stack]], and new character [[Captain (comics)|The Captain]].{{issue|date=November 2011}}

Everything seemed on the up-and-up until Tabitha began snooping around, and discovered the marketing plan of the Beyond Corporation, H.A.T.E.'s financial backers. It turned out that Beyond Corp evolved out of the former terrorist cell known as S.I.L.E.N.T., and was planning to use H.A.T.E. and Nextwave to further its own sinister agendas.{{issue|date=November 2011}} Tabitha brought the files she stole to the squad leader, Pulsar, and Nextwave hijacked a Shockwave Rider transport ship and defected from H.A.T.E.{{issue|date=November 2011}} Tabitha and the others fought against their former employers, and defended the country from the unusual [[weapons of mass destruction|WMDs]] unleashed by the Beyond Corporation on the general populace; the first biological weapon was revealed to be [[Fin Fang Foom]], a giant lizard which clambered from underground and proceeded to wreck the building site.{{issue|date=November 2011}}

After putting an end to the threat of Fin Fang Foom in [[North Dakota|Abscess, North Dakota]], Nextwave moved on to [[Illinois]]. Tabitha manages to subdue Mac Mangel, a corrupt police officer who had been taken as a host by the Ultra Samurai Seed. The Ultra Samurai metallic shell disintegrates, leaving Mangel crushed. Upon learning that he was a police officer, Tabitha and Aaron began to beat Mangel before Rambeau intervened.{{issue|date=November 2011}}

The team were later attacked by The New Paramounts, a team consisting of ''[[Not Brand Echh]]'' characters including [[Forbush Man]], The Inedible Bulk and Charlie America. Forbush Man attempted to use his mind control powers on Tabitha, but was shocked to find they didn't work on her as she apparently has no mind. Tabitha subsequently killed Forbush Man, saving her teammates. When they awoke, she explained "The little guy did something to your heads. I gave him the explodo because I am clever."{{issue|date=November 2011}} Not long after, they eventually exposed and destroyed the true mastermind behind S.I.L.E.N.T.{{issue|date=November 2011}}

Writer [[Warren Ellis]] said that he picked Boom-Boom to be in Nextwave, because Boom-Boom is his favorite super hero name in the history of comics for its sheer oddness and silliness, and he loved it when she was in ''Uncanny X-Men'' when [[Joe Madureira]] was the artist.
{{cquote|"I wanted a character who could blow things up," he said of his choice of Boom-Boom. "I was also looking for a team structure where the women outnumbered the men. I liked her [[white trash|white-trash]] criminal background, which had uses in the plot set-up. But mostly I wanted a character who could blow things up. I mean, these are characters who no-one at Marvel had any use for, and I could have been stopped at any time, Jen. But a skinny-ass blonde mutant with a [[kleptomania]]c streak had both plot and entertainment value to me. Especially when played against the others."<ref>[http://www.comicon.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=36;t=004065 Ellis& The Nextwave @ ComicCon.com]</ref>}}

Despite the appearance of Nextwave characters in other Marvel titles, in 2006 Editor-in-Chief [[Joe Quesada]] stated that Nextwave's setting was in a universe separate from the main Marvel continuity.<ref>Gum, Wade (2006-07-01). [http://web.archive.org/web/20070711133600/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/000765389.cfm "Heroes Con: Joe Quesada Panel"], WizardUniverse.com (archived) </ref> However, ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]'' and ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War: Battle Damage Report]]'' consistently place Nextwave's activities in mainstream continuity.<ref name="civilwarbattledamage">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Anthony Flamini]] & [[Ronald Byrd]] | Penciller =  [[Scott Kolins]] | Inker = [[Scott Kolins]] | Story =  | Title = Civil War: Battle Damage Report | Issue = 1 | Date = March 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref> To further complicate matters, Nextwave's entry in ''Civil War: Battle Damage Report'' states: "Recent intelligence suggests some or all Nextwave members unknowingly had their memories and/or personalities altered by their new employers (H.A.T.E.)."

===The Initiative===
Tabitha Smith has been identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes who appear on the solicited cover of the comic book ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]''.<ref>[http://marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 ''Avengers: The Initiative'' #1]</ref>

===Manifest Destiny===
{{Main|X-Men: Manifest Destiny}}
Tabitha moves to San Francisco to help with the X-Men's new relocation plans, and has resumed using the codename Boom-Boom. While shopping in San Francisco she confronts the mutant [[Nuwa (comics)|Nuwa]].<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=preview&id=943 X-Men: Manifest Destiny #1 preview], [[Comic Book Resources]]</ref> Forced by the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] to confront Nuwa through research, instead of strength alone, she discovers - using a thinly veiled parody of [[MySpace]] and [[Facebook]]<ref>[http://www.readaboutcomics.com/2008/09/10/x-men-manifest-destiny-1/ Read About Comics » X-Men: Manifest Destiny #1<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> called ''FaceSpace'' - the true nature of Nuwa's sedation powers, then nullifies them by consuming large quantities of [[stimulant]]s, namely the [[caffeine]] in an unspecified number of [[espresso]]s.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

===Kidnapping, death and salvation===
Tabitha is later kidnapped along with Surge and Hellion by the Leper Queen and her Sapien League. The Leper Queen attempts to inject her with a modified version of the Legacy Virus, a virus which had been cured years before that afflicted mostly mutants, when the members of X-Force arrive to try and save her, Surge and Hellion.  After Cyclops refuses to wait long enough for Wolverine and Domino to kill the Leper Queen, they are sent through time to help Cable, leaving the Leper Queen and Tabitha all alone.  The Leper Queen reveals to Tabitha that she had intended using X-Force to kill her, since Bastion will not let her commit suicide and that the plan was for Wolverine to kill her and rescue Tabby.  The Leper Queen shoots Tabitha between the eyes, saying that X-Force "failed them both."<ref>''X-Force'' (vol. 3) #13</ref>  After X-Force's mission in the future is complete, [[X-23]] emerges from the timestream seconds before the Leper Queen is about to kill Tabitha and shoots her in the head.<ref>''X-Force'' Vol. 3 #17</ref>  With the Leper Queen dead and Boom-Boom saved, X-23 collapses in exhaustion just as a team of [[H.A.M.M.E.R. (comics)#H.A.M.M.E.R.|H.A.M.M.E.R.]] agents storm the building, providing Tabitha with medical care while taking X-23 into custody.  The agents are given the order to take a genetic sample from Tabitha and then kill her, but one agent plans to rape her before killing her.  She is saved from death yet again by Warpath, who kills the agents before they are able to defile her and takes her to the X-Force safehouse to see if she remembers anything else about her kidnapping.<ref>''X-Force'' #18</ref>

===Utopia===
Boom-Boom is later seen during the events of "[[Utopia (comics)|Utopia]]," amongst the mutants assembled in [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]'s chapel as they all prepare to abandon San Francisco for the base that the X-Club has raised from the bottom of the ocean.  She is among the first group of mutants teleported by [[Pixie (comics)|Pixie]] to the new base.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #8 (2009)</ref> Boom-Boom was also one of the X-Men who defeated the invading Predator Xs who attacked Utopia. Boom-Boom, Iceman, and Colossus teamed up to defeat the first Predator.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #517 (2010)</ref>

===Second Coming===
Boom-Boom is seen fighting alongside Husk, Avalanche and Sunspot against Bastion's minions.<ref>{{cite book|title=New Mutants #14 (2009)}}</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Tabitha Smith is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who originally had the unusually strong ability to create variably-sized yellow orbs and spheres of pure plasma, fiery-like energy, which she calls her "time bombs." These "time bombs" explode with concussive force. She can produce marble-sized energized "bombs" which have little concussive impact and which she uses for playing pranks. She has produced "time bombs" ranging up to the size of beach balls, which have been shown to detonate with sufficient force to destroy highly durable objects including a [[Predator X (comics)|Predator X]],<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #517</ref> and a futuristic [[Nimrod (comics)|Nimrod]].<ref>''New Mutants'' v.3 #14</ref> Tabitha can control the amount of time between the creation of one of her "bombs" and the time it detonates. She can mentally muffle the sound of the detonation.

She is a fair hand-to-hand combatant, coached in unarmed combat by [[Cable (comics)|Cable]].{{Issue|date=January 2011}} She is an excellent player of video games.  She is an accomplished thief, trained by the [[Vanisher]].{{Issue|date=January 2011}}

Under the direction of [[Pete Wisdom]] she learned to focus her power as streams of concussive force.{{Issue|date=January 2011}}

In ''Nextwave,'' her mutant abilities are summarized as "the mutant ability to blow things up and steal all your stuff."{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} She also has access to technological support, such as jetpacks. She was apparently immune to [[Forbush Man]]'s mind-warping abilities, because she supposedly had no mind to warp.{{Issue|date=May 2010}}

==Other versions==
===House of M===
Tabitha appears as a member of the NYPD strikeforce known as the Brotherhood.<ref>''House of M: Avengers'' #2</ref>

===''Marvel Zombies''===
Tabitha is also shown in ''[[Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness]]'' #3 with her Nextwave team, all uninfected, in order to save [[Ash Williams|Ash]] from a zombified Power Pack. The entire team is "humiliatingly and ruthlessly dispatched off panel" moments later.

===''Rahne of Terra''===
In the "heroic fantasy" universe visited by [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]] and [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] in ''Rahne of Terra'' and ''Knight of Terra,'' Geshem is an otherdimensional realm of medieval magic. The land is ruled by Queen Rain, a counterpart of Wolfsbane, and that dimension’s Tabitha is her most loyal and trusted maid. Rain confided in Tabitha with her deepest secrets. She has no known powers.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

===''X-Men: The End''===
In ''[[X-Men: The End]],'' a series set ten to fifteen years in the future, Meltdown is once again a member of X-Force along with Warpath, Domino, Shatterstar, Feral, and Rictor when the team meets their end. After their aircraft is shot out of the sky, (which X-Force barely survives), Meltdown is absorbed by the strange entity called [[Divinity (comics)|Divinity]], who uses Tabitha’s powers against her teammates. Not much later, though, Divinity is killed by [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] while Meltdown is still trapped inside him.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

===X-Force: Shatterstar===
In the ''X-Force: Shatterstar'' miniseries, Tabitha is still known as Boomer and she is seen as a part of Cable's rebel forces against [[Spiral (comics)|Spiral]], in an alternate universe where Spiral has conquered and now rules Earth. On that Earth, Spiral has also killed most of that world's heroes and mutants. Together, the team eventually defeats Spiral. Tabitha also seems to have developed telepathic powers in this timeline.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

==In other media==
===Television===
====''X-Men''====
Tabitha appears in the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' animated series as a young child, along with [[Rusty Collins|Rusty]], [[Taki Matsuya|Whiz-Kid]], and [[Skids (comics)|Skids]] in the episode "No Mutant is an Island". She was among the mutant children that Cyclops' old friend Sarah takes care of, and Scott has to rescue her and the other kids from [[Purple Man|The Purple Man, Kilgrave]]. A mutant himself with telepathic abilities, he wanted to use the children to make them his army to destroy all humans in the world so that mutants are accepted. Killgrave brainwashes the four and uses them to storm the governor's mansion so he can make the governor his mind-controlled slave. Scott was able to snap Boom-Boom and the others out of Kilgrave's hypnotic brainwashing in the end and saves the mutant children.

====''X-Men: Evolution''====
In the ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'' animated TV series, Boom-Boom was voiced by [[Megan Leitch]]. Originally one of the New Mutants, Tabitha has a troubled past and a criminal father. Her father took advantage of her mutant abilities to commit crimes when she was younger. She eventually found a home at the Xavier Institute, although her stay was short-lived. Her lack of discipline and mischievousness made her a troublesome guest for anyone willing to take her in. She spent an episode romantically flirting and bonding with [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Kurt Wagner]], whom she saw as someone similar to her since they were kind of outcasts (him, because of his looks; her, because of her family life and her rebelliousness).<ref>x-Men:Evolution - Ep. 16 "Bada-Bing Bada-Boom!"</ref>

At the end of this episode, she felt that she didn't fit in and moved in with the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]], who were more her style, saying that there were too many rules at the Institute. She often played practical jokes on the boys (such as shaving off Blob's Mohawk while he slept) and abused their hospitality, though they did little to stop her. Also, at times she'd aid them, taking the unpopular Blob and [[Toad (comics)|Toad]] as her dates for the party in ''Shadow Dance.'' Tabitha never actually took up a villainous role, though, and she was evicted upon the return of [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]. She even discovered some of Mystique's plans and, after blowing up her bedroom, she went to the X-Men manor and tried to tell them, but failed.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

Her role in the series was significantly diminished afterward; she appeared to rejoin the X-Men and is seen in uniform in the episode "Stuff of Heroes" appeared mostly in the company of her best friend, Amara a.k.a. [[Magma (comics)|Magma]] from the New Mutants, appearing in several episodes of the series afterwards with no serious loyalties (noticeably, in ''Cruise Control,'' she travels along with the rest of the New Mutants, under the care of Jean, Scott and Ororo, though not reintegrated into the X-Men). Finally, according to the season finale, she took the decision of returning to the X-Men's side.<ref>X-Men: Evolution - Ep. 52 "Ascension, Part 2"</ref>

====''Wolverine and the X-Men''====
Tabitha appears in the first episode of the animated TV series "[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]",{{vague|date=November 2011}}<!--which episodes?--> voiced by [[Crystal Scales]].
