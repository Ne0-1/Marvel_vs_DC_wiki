[[Image:Wallflower_(comics).jpg|right|frame|Wallflower, by Randy Green]]'''Wallflower''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] in the [[Marvel Universe]], one of the student body in the [[X-Men|Xavier Institute]], and a member of the [[New Mutants]] squad therein.  Her real name is Laurie Collins, and she first appeared in ''New Mutants'' (volume 2) #2.

==Fictional Biography==

Laurie is a second-generation mutant. Her father, who had the same power as her, used it to manipulate people and get money, fame... and women. Laurie's mother, Gail, was one of these women, and stayed with him until one day his power stopped working on her... because she was pregnant with his child.

Leaving him after learning what had happened, she raised Laurie alone and Laurie, realising her mother had been hurt, became a quiet loner. Until one day, on holiday, she suddenly became very popular... because her power had emerged. Her mother, realising this (and immune to her pheromones), tried to talk her down gently - but Laurie, who hadn't realised why she'd suddenly become popular, became scared of what she could do and ended up even more withdrawn than before.

After the [[X-Men|Xavier Institute]] became public, Gail decided to send her there, and moved to Salem Center to stay near her, so that she could have one person whose reactions she could trust - although she insisted she live at the school, to try and make her come out her shell. It didn't work - she went through several roommates very quickly, and stayed quietly in her room, panicking, while a riot was going on, hoping she wasn't the cause.

When [[Winddancer (comics)|Sofia Mantega]] came to the school, she was paired with Laurie - and, given her ability to blow Laurie's pheremones away, Sofia didn't have to worry about being accidently manipulated by Laurie. Refusing to let her stay in their room, Sofia started hanging around with Laurie, as did [[Prodigy (comics)|David Alleyne]] and [[Wither (comics)|Kevin Ford]], with Laurie and Kevin developing mutual crushes. Then, when on a visit to meet Sofia's "dad" (not her real father, but his manservant who'd had more time for her than her real father ever had), they got into a fight with the [[Reavers]], and Laurie was stabbed through the chest, mortally wounded. She was only saved when [[Elixir (comics)|Josh Foley]], one of the Reavers who had just discovered he was a mutant, healed her (she quickly developed a crush on him), while Kevin, enraged, tried to kill [[Donald Pierce]], the Reavers' leader, by Withering him away with his power. [[Danielle Moonstar|Dani Moonstar]] was forced to make him confront his worst fear - killing Laurie - to make him stop, and he left the school shortly after.

Laurie continued to stick around with the future New Mutants - and was happy when they were joined by Josh. And less happy when he developed a big crush on [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]] just as Sofia was urging her to ask him out. When Josh was out late one night, breaking curfew, she thought she heard him approach and sneaked down to let him in... only to find him eviscerated by an out-of-control Wolfsbane, driven temporarily insane by the return of her powers. Controlling her power for the first time to scare Wolfsbane away, she nonetheless could do nothing for Josh's apparently mortal injuries. As he was rushed to the Institute's infirmary, she was depressed at the thought that she'd finally managed to control her powers properly too late to save him. But, when David and [[Surge (comics)|Surge]] managed to think up a way to get him conscious long enough to heal himself, she was needed to keep him calm long enough for him to do it. They succeeded, although she was hurt by the fact that he obviously still had a crush on Rahne.

After the mansion was destroyed and rebuilt, she was placed on the official [[New Mutants]] squad with Josh, Sofia, David, Surge and Kevin (who Dani, with the help of [[The White Queen|Emma Frost]], had managed to persuade to return) and she was given the codename Wallflower with an "it fits."

When Sofia crashed and burned (figuratively speaking) in her first Field Day as leader, Laurie found her crying in their room after some harsh criticism from Josh. Laurie offered to speak to Josh - saying that she could talk to Josh about Sofia, even if not to ask him on a date. Trying to pluck up the courage to talk to him, she came across him just after he'd been turned down by Rahne again, who felt a relationship with him was inappropriate now she was on the faculty, and he asked if she wanted to him, and after she'd mentioned the "Sofia thing", he suggested they get some dinner in town - on their own (making neither Rahne nor Kevin, who still had a crush on her even after she'd moved on, happy).

Going to a video arcade, she confessed to Josh about what her father was like, and how she didn't want to be like him, and that that was why she'd "avoided everybody." Halfway through saying that she had her powers mostly under control and she should be dating, he finally clicked that she did want to date - him. As they were leaving the arcade to go somewhere else, Rahne interrupted to bring them back to the Institute: the FBI had caught up with Kevin about his accidental killing of his father. 

After the school, buoyed by reassurances by Agent Pierce over the clearly accidental death, allowed Kevin to be taken away by the FBI, Laurie was one of the most upset, and went to skim stones on the Institute's lake. [[Icarus (comics)|Icarus]] found her, having already gathered the rest of the New Mutants - barring Sofia - with the news that the rest of the Hellions had gone to break Kevin out, and that Sofia went with them. Laurie's reaction was "Good!", but the others talked her into helping them stop the Hellions: although she was even more annoyed after Josh tried to get Wolfsbane to help them.

She used her powers to keep Rockslide crying and out of the fight while the others fought around them, until the X-Men - alerted by Rahne - turned up and took them all back to the Institute. The charges against Kevin were dismissed, but, soured on the New Mutants, he swapped squads with Icarus (although he & Laurie remain friends - if strained by her crush on Josh) - while, unbeknownst to her, Josh and Rahne covertly resumed their relationship. It isn't clear how Laurie will react when she finds out about this...

==Powers==

Wallflower generates scent-based [[pheromones]], which alter the moods of those around her. Initially, she had no control over this at all, and she would cause everyone within range to match her moods. She can now control it to an extent, but still has lapses when her emotions are particuarly strong.
