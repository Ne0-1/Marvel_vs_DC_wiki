'''Donald Pierce''' (The White King) is a [[comic book]] [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe. The Character first appeared in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #132. He was created by Chris Claremont and John Byrne. Donald Pierce is a [[cyborg]].
==Character Biography==
Donald first appeared as a high ranking member of the [[Hellfire Club]] inner circle, where he held the position of White King, during that organizations first direct encounter with the X-Men.  During this conflict, he battled Wolverine, Nightcrawler, and Collossus, and when Wolverine nearly severed his arm it was discovered that he was a cyborg. The Hellfire Club inner circle was eventually defeated and Donald Pierce's whereabouts were unknown for several years.

Later, he resurfaced with [[Lady Deathstrike]] and three cybernetically resurrected mercenaries (Cole, Macon, and Reese) who had been fatally wounded by Wolverine during that first Hellfire club skirmish. 
All five characters were consumed by their desire for revenge against the X-Men and Wolverine in particular. To that end Pierce created an army of cyborgs out of low-life thugs and a few mercenaries. He named his army "The [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]]".

After rescuing the kidnapped banker Tyger Tiger from the Reavers, the X-Men expelled the cyborgs from their Australian outback headquarters, and appropriated the base for themselves (though Pierce was not present during this encounter, and was not yet revealed as the Reavers' creator).  The Reavers set out to defeat the X-Men, mounting a return to their old headquarters, this time with Pierce and Deathstrike present, but after the X-Men had escaped through the [[Siege Perilous]], they managed to capture only [[Wolverine]], whom they tortured and crucified.  Wolverine subsequently escaped with Jubilee.  At one point Pierce created two super intelligent sentient androids ([[Elsie-Dee]] and [[Albert (comics)|Albert]]) to kill Wolverine but they developed ethics and turned on Pierce and abandoned the Reavers. 

A few years later a new Hellfire inner circle boss, Shinobi Shaw, sent reprogrammed Sentinels to destroy the Reavers, as they were a threat to mutants and Pierce (as the former White King) was a threat to Shinobi's power. Only Lady Deathstrike escaped and it appeared that Pierce had been destroyed. The other Reavers were completely annihilated. Despite his seeming demise, he later resurfaced and troubled the X-Men once more. He recently started an anti-mutant hate group and enlisted several members. He revealed a plot to take militant terrorist actions against mutants and was thwarted by the X-Men. He was beaten by Wolverine in hand-to-hand combat even though he is several times stronger than Logan. It was revealed that ''very'' little (if any) of Pierce's human tissue remains, which explains how he was able to survive the massacre in Australia with only his head and portions of his upper torso intact. 

Pierce recently tried to take over Sebastian Shaw's new Hellfire Club, launching an attack and slashing Shaw's chest. Though Shaw was left critically injured and later needed to be  hospitalized, he was able to punch off Pierce's head. Whether or not Pierce could survive such an attack, his fate remains uncertain.

==Powers and abilities==
Donald Pierce is a cyborg with superhuman strength (meaning he can lift between 3 and 10 tons). His reflexes and agility are also inhumanly fast. These attributes are derived from his artificial body. His body has great resistance to damage and even if it is destroyed, as long as his head intact he will probably survive. There is nothing left of his original human body except the head, and how much of the head is even original is unknown. It is unknown if he still has his original brain or if he uploaded his memories, intelligence, and thought engrams into a cyborg computer brain. 

Aside from his physical advantages, Donald Pierce is a genius in robotics, cybernetics, and electronics. In these fields he has developed technology that exceeds that of conventional science by at least two centuries. He also has vast financial resources (a requirement for membership in the Hellfire club).

==Trivia==
Pierce's name and appearance were initially modeled by John Byrne upon [[Donald Sutherland]].
