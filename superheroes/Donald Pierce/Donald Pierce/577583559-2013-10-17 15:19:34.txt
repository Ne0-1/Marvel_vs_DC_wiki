==Fictional character biography==
Donald Pierce was born in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. Pierce first appears as a high-ranking member of the Inner Circle of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]], where he holds the position of '''White Bishop'''. However, Pierce is in fact a genocidal mutant hater, and has only joined the Club in order to kill the other members of the Inner Circle, all of whom are mutants.<ref name="MGN4">''Marvel Graphic Novel'' #4</ref> In addition to hating mutants, Pierce is also bigoted towards certain nationalities and harbors a sense of self-loathing due to his being a cyborg.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #134</ref> He is the CEO and principal shareholder of Pierce-Consolidated Mining, and operates out of a mining and laboratory complex in Cameron, Kentucky. Pierce and his mercenaries kidnap [[Professor X]]avier and [[Sage (comics)|Tessa]] in a plot against the Hellfire Club and X-Men, but despite a device shielding against telepathic attacks, he is defeated by Xavier. Pierce is returned by Tessa to the Hellfire Club, and expelled from the Inner Circle.<ref name="MGN4"/>

===The Reavers===
Later, he resurfaces as a professional criminal and terrorist with [[Lady Deathstrike]] and three cybernetically enhanced mercenaries (Cole, Macon, and Reese) who were critically wounded by Wolverine. The five are united by their desire for revenge against the X-Men and Wolverine in particular. To that end Pierce creates an army of cyborgs out of low-life thugs and mercenaries. He names his army "The [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]]".{{Issue|date=June 2009}}

After rescuing the kidnapped banker [[Jessan Hoan]] from the Reavers, the X-Men expel the cyborgs from their Australian outback headquarters, and appropriate the base for themselves.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #229</ref> The surviving Reavers set out to defeat the X-Men, mounting a return to their old headquarters, this time with Pierce and Deathstrike, but after the X-Men escape through the [[Siege Perilous (comics)|Siege Perilous]], they manage to capture only Wolverine, whom they torture and [[Crucifixion|crucify]]. Wolverine subsequently escapes with Jubilee, and Pierce attempts to track them.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #251-253</ref> Assuming they fled to [[Muir Island]], Pierce and the Reavers attack Muir Island, and battle [[Moira MacTaggart]]'s "Muir Island X-Men" and [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #254-255</ref> With the Reavers, he also attacks a Frost Technologies plant in California.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #262</ref> Pierce creates two super intelligent sentient androids ([[Elsie-Dee]] and [[Albert (comics)|Albert]]), programming them to find Wolverine and self-destruct. However, their intelligence allows them to put the bomb in Elsie-Dee on hold, and they abandon the Reavers.<ref>''Wolverine'' Vol. 2 #37-39</ref>

A member of the [[Upstarts (comics)|Upstarts]], [[Trevor Fitzroy]], sends reprogrammed [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] to destroy the Reavers, as they are a threat to mutants and Pierce (as the former White King) is worth a lot of "points" in the deadly game the Upstarts played. Only Lady Deathstrike and Cylla escape. Pierce has Gateway teleport him to the one responsible for the attack on the Reavers, but the Sentinels accompanying Fitzroy electrocute him.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #281</ref> Despite his seeming demise, he later resurfaces, starts an anti-mutant hate group, and enlists several members. He reveals a plot to take militant terrorist actions against mutants and is thwarted by the X-Men. He is beaten by Wolverine in hand-to-hand combat. Very little of Pierce's human tissue remains, which explains how he was able to survive the massacre in Australia with only his head and portions of his upper torso intact.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #282</ref>

===Becoming a Purifier===
Pierce next tries to take over [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]]'s new Hellfire Club, launching an attack and slashing Shaw's chest. Though Shaw is left critically injured and later needed to be hospitalized, he is able to punch off Pierce's head.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #454</ref> Pierce later is forcibly recruited into the ranks of the [[Purifiers]] and infected with the Technarch transmode virus.<ref>''X-Force'' Vol. 3 #3 (2008)</ref> Being under the control of the mutant-hunting robot [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]], he shows his mutant target, the newly formed [[Young X-Men]].<ref>''X-Force'' Vol. 3 #7</ref>

===Young X-Men===
He appears in a nightmare of the precognitive mutant, [[Blindfold (comics)|Blindfold]], battling a not yet formed team of [[Young X-Men|X-Men]] and killing one of their number.<ref>''Young X-Men'' #1</ref> Pierce himself recruited this team using an image inducer to pose as the leader of the X-Men, [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]].  His reasons for recruiting these mutants as "X-Men" are not entirely clear, however, it appears that his primary focus is to eliminate the current Lord Imperial of the Hellfire Club, [[Sunspot (comics)|Roberto da Costa]], and his former [[New Mutants]] allies. He also hires [[Ink (comics)|Ink]] to deliver Dani and Blindfold to him, misleading him.  Following the confrontation with the Young X-Men, his face is scoured by [[Dust (comics)|Dust]].<ref>''Young X-Men'' #5</ref>

With the synthetic skin on his face restored, he is kept captive by the Young X-Men.<ref>''Young X-Men'' #6</ref> Ink is allowed to stay on the team and despite contention from [[Rockslide (comics)|Rockslide]], later apologizes to Blindfold for working for Pierce, who remains in X-Men captivity.  Pierce and Dust have frequent conversations while he is imprisoned, despite his vocal hatred of mutants and derogatory remarks toward her faith in [[Islam]], noting that his attitude reminds her of home. While they talk, Dust admits to Pierce that she is dying, as he is "the only one who won't care" and he agrees to share with her the secret information he has about her teammates.  He tells her that Ink is the mystery "non-mutant" among them, which is later discovered by the rest of the team.<ref>''Young X-Men'' #6, 7</ref> Also, he subtly tells her that three of her friends will die soon, referring to [[Tabitha Smith|Boom Boom]], [[Hellion (comics)|Hellion]] and [[Surge (comics)|Surge]], who were captured by the Sapien League and injected with a strain of the [[Legacy Virus]].<ref>''X-Force'' vol. 3 #13</ref>

===Second Coming===
It was eventually revealed that Pierce only was captured to act as Bastion's mole inside the X-Men's headquarters, all the while building several structures that surround Utopia.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #524</ref>

Later after receiving the green light from Bastion to proceed with their plan, Pierce provokes an explosion that decimates all the X-Men's jets and the Blackbirds. Pierce stands amid the debris, and muses to the X-Men that he is sorry that he will not live to witness the decimation of the mutant race. Cyclops eliminates him with an optic blast.<ref>''New Mutants'' Vol. 3 #13</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Donald Pierce is a [[cyborg]] originally with four artificial limbs, providing him with [[superhuman strength]]. His reflexes and agility are also inhumanly fast. These attributes are derived from his artificial body. His body has great resistance to damage and even if it is destroyed, as long as his head is intact he will probably survive. He had the ability to generate a shocking electrical current through his cyborg limbs or to hurl electrical force over short distances. He also had the ability to turn [[psionic]] assaults against the attacker to a limited degree. There is now nothing left of his original human body except the head, and how much of the head is even original is unknown. It is unknown if he still has his original brain or if he uploaded his memories, intelligence, and thought [[Engram (neuropsychology)|engrams]] into a cyborg computer brain. As a member of the Reavers, he wore body armor.

Aside from his physical advantages, Donald Pierce is a [[genius]] in robotics, cybernetics, and electronics. In these fields he has developed technology that exceeds that of conventional science by approximately two centuries. He also has vast financial resources (a prerequisite for membership in the Hellfire Club). He is a college graduate in geological engineering and business administration, and is an accomplished strategist and business administrator. He is a fair hand-to-hand combatant, but relied on his cyborg strength.

==Other versions==

===Age of Apocalypse===
In the '''[[Age of Apocalypse]]''', Pierce was the leader of the Reavers, a band of human assassins enhanced by Apocalypse's techno-organic virus. Thanks to the virus, Pierce and his band of assassins become cyborgs with regenerative abilities and the power to assimilate both organic and non-organic material to mutate themselves. Pierce infiltrated the territory of the Human High Council in an attempt to destroy the Council fleet and later attempted to kill [[Gateway (comics)|Gateway]], an ally of the HHC. After the fleet was assembled for an attack on [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]'s empire, Pierce infected [[Carol Danvers]] with the remains of the Reaver Vultura to aid him in the destruction of the fleet. During his attack he also used Brian Braddock, who was under Apocalypse's mind control, to kill Emma Frost, though he resisted Pierce's orders, for which Pierce killed him. In the end, Pierce was destroyed by [[Wolverine (comics)|Weapon X]].<ref>''Weapon X'' #4</ref>

Pierce was however rebuilt by a human team known only as X-Terminators and is now helping the humans against the mutants.<ref>''Marvel Point One''</ref> Operating under the codename "'''Goodnight'''", Pierce infiltrated the Hellfire Club, becoming a great friend of Sebastian Shaw. He appears to had lost the techno-organic virus with the general public and Club members thinking he is in fact a mutant.<ref>''Age of Apocalypse'' #1</ref>

===House of M===
In the '''[[House of M]]''', Donald Pierce was a member of the Human Liberation Front, one of the many human resistance groups labeled as terrorists by the [[House of M]]. Alongside Seiji Ashida, the father of [[Surge (comics)|Surge]], he was part of the HLF's base in Tokyo, which had targeted Project Genesis, a plan of [[Sunfire (comics)|Emperor Sunfire]] to forcefully mutate baseline humans.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}
