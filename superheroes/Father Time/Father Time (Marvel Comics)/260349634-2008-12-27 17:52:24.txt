'''Father Time''' ('''Larry Scott''') is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[comic book]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel universe|universe]]. He was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Al Avison]] in ''[[Captain America Comics]]'' #6 (Sept. 1941)<ref>[http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=1639#4 Grand Comics Database: ''Captain America  Comics'' #6 (Sept. 1941)]</ref>, published by Marvel predecessor [[Timely Comics]] during the period fans and historians call the [[Golden Age of comic books]]. 

==Publication history==
One of future Marvel patriarch Stan Lee's first co-creations, Father Time starred in a backup feature in ''Captain America Comics'' #6-12 (Sept. 1941 - March 1942), by which time it was being drawn by [[Jack Alderman]]. The feature also appeared in ''[[Young Allies Comics]]'' #3 (Spring 1942), and ''[[Mystic Comics]]'' #10 (Aug. 1942). 

A different, non-superhero Father Time appeared as a character in the [[Blonde Phantom]] story "Doomed for Death" in ''Blonde Phantom Comics'' #22 (March 1949).

A Marvel character named Father Time appeared in modern-day stories in the 50th-anniversary issue ''Captain America'' #383 (March 1991), as a non-human [[Elder of the Universe]]. No relationship with the Golden Age character was specifically established.

Given the unique nature of the Elders of the Universe, this Father Time was either a different character than Larry Scott, or Scott's origin was heavily [[retcon]]ned by establishing him as an Elder.

There is also an unrelated character of the same name in DC Comics (see [[Father Time (DC Comics)]]

==Fictional character biography==
Wearing a hooded cloak and wielding a scythe, Larry Scott seeks to make time work against criminals, rather than in their favor. He becomes Father Time to save his wrongfully accused father from the electric chair, but was only seconds too late to prevent his father's death.

In modern times, a much older-seeming Father Time appears as a time-manipulating [[Elder of the Universe]] who unsuccessfully attempts to place Captain America in stasis alongside other iconic figures of American legend and [[folklore]], including [[Uncle Sam]], [[Johnny Appleseed]], and [[Paul Bunyan]].   It is unknown if this is still in fact Larry Scott as the nature of the Elders is very unique.
