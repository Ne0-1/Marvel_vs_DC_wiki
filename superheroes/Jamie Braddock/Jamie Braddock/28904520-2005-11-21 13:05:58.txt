'''James Braddock Jr.''' is a [[fictional character]] in [[Marvel comics]]. He is the elder brother by a decade of [[Captain Britain|Brian Braddock]] and [[Psylocke|Elisabeth Braddock]], his twin siblings. He is human [[Mutant (fictional)|mutant]] who perceives the [[universe]] as being made of [[quantum]] strings, which he can pull and twist to [[Reality warper|alter the fabric of reality]]. Unfortunely, he also believes that the "real world" as we perceives it is nothing but a dream and that he must be the one dreaming it, which makes him essentially [[Insanity|insane]], like his fellow [[Marvel UK]] reality warper, [[Mad Jim Jaspers]]. He was last seen in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #462-465, in the UXM four part tie-in story of [[House of M]],
in which also Jaspers mysteriously reappeared.<br><br>
"''Power runs deep in our family. He got the full measure. The ability to pull the quantum strings that define causality. <br>He got himself so tangled, he'll never twist free.'''" - [[Psylocke|Betsy Braddock]], ''Uncanny X-Men'' #464
