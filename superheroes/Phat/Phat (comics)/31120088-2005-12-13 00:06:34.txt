'''Phat''' (real name: '''William Robert Reilly''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[mutant (fiction)|mutant]] in the [[Marvel Universe]]. He was created by [[Peter Milligan]] and [[Mike Allred]] in ''X-Force'' vol. 1 #117 ([[2001]]). Phat was a member of [[X-Statix]] until he was killed by a [[bomb]] while protecting his teammates in ''X-Statix'' #18 ([[2004]]). Phat's mutant power is the ability to stretch the fat deposits in his body, making his body longer and fatter.

The character was a parody of the rap artist [[Eminem]]. Like the rapper, Phat was originally perviced as very [[homophobic]], but later turned out to be a homosexual himself- unlike the rapper.
