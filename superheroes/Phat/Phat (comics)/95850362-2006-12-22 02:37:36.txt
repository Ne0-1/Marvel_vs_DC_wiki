'''Phat''' ('''William Robert Reilly''', AKA "Billy-Bob") is a [[fictional character]], a [[mutant (fiction)|mutant]] in the [[Marvel Universe]]. He was created by [[Peter Milligan]] and [[Mike Allred]] in ''X-Force'' vol. 1 #117 ([[2001]]). Phat was a member of [[X-Statix]] until he was killed by a [[bomb]] while protecting his teammates in ''X-Statix'' #18 ([[2004]]). Phat's mutant power is the ability to stretch the fat deposits in his body, making his body longer and fatter.

==Creative concept==
The character was a parody of the rap artist [[Eminem]]. Phat was originally perceived as very [[homophobic]], but later turned out to be a homosexual himself.

==Appearances in other media==
Phat makes an appearance in the film [[X-Men: The Last Stand]]. Phat is played by two actors, [[Via Saleaumua]] and [[Richard Yee]], as Phat in "large mode" and "small mode" respectively. He joins up with the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]]. The end credits mention both Phats.

The DVD release features a deleted scene in which Phat is frozen solid by [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] and then shattered by [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]].
