'''Phat''' ('''William Robert "Billy-Bob" Reilly''') is an [[openly gay]] [[fictional character]], a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] in the [[Marvel Universe]]. He was created by [[Peter Milligan]] and [[Mike Allred]] in ''X-Force'' vol. 1 #117 (2001). Phat's mutant power is the ability to expand the fat deposits in his body, making his body larger and fatter.

==Fictional character biography==
Phat grew up poor and involved in the gangster life. At first his powers manifested as simple weight gain, which he put down to the stress of his life. Once it became clear he was a mutant, he trained well and used his abilities to fight crime, even before joining [[X-Force]]. Once rich, he tries to give his family what he never had growing up. He gave them a house, but they still lived in an [[recreational vehicle|RV]], preferring the closeness. 

Phat's first outing results in a fight with the old X-Force, who did not agree to the use of the name or the methodology of the team.{{issue|date=January 2013}} His first mission sees the death of two his teammates, [[Saint Anna (comics)|Saint Anna]] and [[Bloke (comics)|Bloke]].{{issue|date=January 2013}} Bloke would not be the first gay member of the team.

Phat works with [[Vivisector]] to raise their profile amongst the team and in the public.{{issue|date=January 2013}} They even 'pretend' a romantic relationship which is foiled by the fact both of them realize they really are gay.{{issue|date=January 2013}} They have a real relationship, which ends when they realize they are simply not attracted to each other.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Phat's powers seem to be less effective in moments of stress. During a mission in space he finds it hard to recover from a biological spike that had wounded him.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Phat joins with the team when they go to fight the [[Taliban]] on a mission to rescue the cast and crew of a [[reality show]] they had captured. He comes into conflict with the team when he saves new member [[Henrietta Hunter]].{{issue|date=January 2013}} The entirety of the team had come to dislike her, because she was interfering, annoying, more famous and even as Phat claims, 'white', though he is white too. Phat claims he saved her on instinct.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

===Death===
Soon after this, they confront the murderous cult led by Mister Code, who believes he can improve America's general attitude by random sniper killings. [[Spike Freeman]], then team leader, is revealed to be in league with Mister Code; he had hired the man to kill [[Lacuna (comics)|Lacuna]], an ally of the team. [[Mister Sensitive|The Orphan]] kills Spike and via [[Dead Girl (comics)|Dead Girl]], they track down Code. The enemy kills [[Henrietta Hunter]] and is killed by the Orphan. This sets off a biological bomb. Phat enlarges himself and envelops it. The explosion kills him.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Phat is buried in a gigantic coffin. Hunter, who wished to gain revenge for her first death, would involve Phat from beyond the grave. An insane ghost, she causes the deaths of anyone who hums a newly released song she had performed. [[X-Statix]] believes they have solved the problem but [[El Guapo (comics)|El Guapo]], another member of X-Statix, hums it and is impaled. Dead Girl, who can come back from bodily destruction, hums it on purpose. Phat's foot, blown off in the Code explosion, rockets out of the sky and into her brain. This is only a temporary inconvenience and Dead Girl learns enough to put Hunter to rest.<ref>''X-Statix'' #18</ref>
