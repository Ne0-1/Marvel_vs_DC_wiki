'''Super Sabre (Martin Fletcher)''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe. His first appearance was in ''Uncanny X-Men #215''.

During WWII Super Sabre fought against the Axis powers which dominated [[Europe]]. He fought alongside three other heroes during this time: [[Stonewall (comics)|Stonewall]], [[Crimson Commando]], and [[Yankee Clipper (comics)|Yankee Clipper]]. Following the war Super Sabre along with the Commando and Stonewall continued to fight crime. They even hoped to join the [[Human Torch]] in fighting communists, but government officials were concerned that the over enthusiastic heroes would cause a real war. The government requested that the trio retired, which they reluctantly did. 

Fletcher, Crimson Commando, and Stonewall returned to [[United States|America]]. When they arrived home they were disturbed by the criminal acts of people who thought they were "above the law". Finally deciding to do something they came out of retirement and would kidnap criminals and hunt them for sport. Later they accidentally captured [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] and realized that she was not a criminal. Faced with this dilemma they decided to hunt down Storm in order to keep their whereabouts a secret. Storm was also captured with another prisoner, Priscilla Morrison, their actual target. Chasing down Morrison and Storm, Super Sabre was almost decapitated by a trap Storm had set. Later, Morrison betrayed Storm, but before she could kill Storm the Commando was able to kill her. Storm and the Commando then fought in combat, which she won. After she won she demanded that Commando and Stonewall turn themselves in. Distraught because they thought Super Sabre was dead, they complied and turned themselves in. 

Months later [[Valerie Cooper]] arranged for the release of the Commando and Stonewall if they joined [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]]. They reluctantly agreed. Super Sabre turned up alive and also joined the Freedom Force. 

Super Sabre and Freedom Force later worked with the [[X-Men]] against a cosmic entity known as the [[Adversary (comics)|Adversary]], but their attempts to enforce the government policy, the [[Mutant Registration Act]], later led to battles with [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] and the [[New Mutants]]. Following a mission to [[Muir Island]] which resulted in Stonewall's death at the hands of the Reavers. Later during a mission which involved [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], Super Sabre was almost decapitated again. 

During an unknown period of time Super Sabre was seen alongside other speedsters such as [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], [[Whizzer#Stanley Stewart (Earth-712)|Whizzer]], [[Speed Demon]], [[Black Racer (comics)|Black Racer]], [[Makkari (comics)|Makkari]], and the female [[Monica_Rambeau|Captain Marvel]]. [[Runner (comics)|The Runner]] pitted them against each other to find out who is the fastest being in the galaxy.

The Commando then led a mission to Kuwait which led to a fight with the Middle Eastern mercenaries called [[Desert Sword]]. The mission ended with Super Sabre decapitated by [[Aminedi]] and the Commando crippled. Following this disaster, Freedom Force was disbanded. 

Years later [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] visited the afterlife and was attacked by several of his dead foes, among them Stonewall, [[Pyro (comics)|Pyro]], and Super Sabre. Wolverine began to fight the dead villains until [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] appeared to help Wolverine defeat them.

More recently, a young recruit of [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique's]] latest incarnation of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]] took the code name [[Sabre (comics)|Sabre]], in honor of the late Super Sabre.  This Sabre has somewhat similar mutant abilities as the original.
