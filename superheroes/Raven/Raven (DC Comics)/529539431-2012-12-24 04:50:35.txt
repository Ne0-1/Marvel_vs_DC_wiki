'''Raven''' is a [[superhero]]ine who appears in [[comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. The character first appeared in a [[DC Comics insert previews|special insert]] in ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' #26 (October 1980), and was created by writer [[Marv Wolfman]] and artist [[George Pérez]]. Raven is an [[empath]] who can [[Teleportation|teleport]] and control her "[[astral body|soul-self]]," which can fight physically, as well as act as Raven's eyes and ears away from her body. Raven's chronology is typically{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} separated into three lives. Her first life, 18 years, was spent in the [[Azarath|Temple Azarath]] and creating [[Teen Titans#New Teen Titans|The New Teen Titans]]. Her second life began once she started wearing the garb of White Raven, and lasted under two years. Her third life is her current form. Unlike the transition between her first and second lives, with her third life came a new, younger body. A series on the CW has been debated.

==Publication history==
The character was created by Marv Wolfman and George Pérez. The description from Wolfman to Pérez was of a female Phantom Stranger type character. Pérez notes that:

{{cquote | ...the hood - which I designed to look like an actual bird's head - was my contribution, along with the fact that I wanted to give her a dress. She did not look like an action character, because she was wearing an impractical costume for action.<ref>{{cite book | last=Nolen-Weathington | first=Eric | coauthors=George Perez | title=Modern Masters Volume 2: George Pérez | publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing | page=128 | isbn=978-1-893905-25-2}}</ref>}}

==Fictional character biography==

===First life===
A character with a morbid past and origins, Raven is the half-breed daughter of a human mother named [[Arella]] and the [[demon|interdimensional demon]] [[Trigon (comics)|Trigon]]. She grew up in an alternate dimension called [[Azarath]], with [[pacifism|pacifistic]] inhabitants whose spiritual leader was the mystic Azar. She was taught to "control her emotions" by Azar, in order to suppress her inherited demonic powers. Essentially, it was feared that if Raven was allowed to feel any emotion that was too strong, she could become a demon like her father.

During this time, Raven rarely saw her mother and grew detached from her. Upon Azar's death, Arella began the task of raising and teaching Raven. Around this same time, Raven's demonic heritage was revealed, as she met her father face to face for the first time. Soon after her 16th birthday, Raven learned that Trigon planned to come to her dimension; she vowed to stop him.

[[File:Talesofneweentitans2.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Cover of ''Tales of the New Teen Titans'' #2 (July 1982). Art by George Pérez.]]

Raven initially approached the [[Justice League]], but they refused her on the advice of [[Zatanna]], who sensed her demonic parentage{{Issue|date=April 2009}}. In desperation, she reformed the Titans as the New Teen Titans to fight her father. The team consisted of [[Robin (comics)#Dick Grayson|Robin]], [[Wonder Girl#Donna Troy|Wonder Girl]], [[Wally West|Kid Flash]], [[Starfire (comics)|Starfire]], [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]], and [[Beast Boy]]. Raven and her new friends later came to think of one another as family.

Trigon soon kidnapped Raven to his home dimension. The team defeated Trigon and sealed him in an interdimensional prison with the help of Arella, who stayed at the interdimensional door as Trigon's Guardian{{Issue|date=April 2009}}. However, Raven continued to fight her father's influence, as he was not completely destroyed. For a period of time, Raven lost control several times in stressful situations, but managed to regain control before Trigon could assert himself.

Popular storylines such as "The Judas Contract" took place during this period{{Issue|date=April 2009}}. Eventually, Trigon escaped his prison, came to Earth, and took control of Raven, destroying Azarath in the process. The Titans came together and were forced to kill Raven, thereby allowing the souls of Azarath to possess her and use her as a channel to kill Trigon. After this battle, Raven rose from the ashes, purged of Trigon's evil, and vanished.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

====Absent during ''Crisis on Infinite Earths''====
Between the periods that we know to be Raven's first and second lives, Raven's whereabouts were unknown. This suggests that during this period, Raven transcended Earth into a non-parallel dimension.

===Second life (White Raven)===
The minions of the Titans' enemy, [[Brother Blood]], captured Raven to control [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] (the former Robin) as part of Blood's plans of resurrection. The Titans rescued them both and prevented Brother Blood from returning. Raven then donned a white cloak to represent freedom from her father's influence.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

After being free to feel, Raven found she was able to not only sense, but control others' emotions{{Issue|date=April 2009}}. She learned to handle this power only after unintentionally making Nightwing believe that he loved her when she thought that she was in love with him. Raven also fostered a relationship with [[technopath]] Eric Forrester, who was using the life force of women he seduced to regain some of his lost humanity. Forrester knew that Raven's soul-self could help him to permanently retain his humanity. This attempt was cut short by the intervention of Joseph Wilson ([[Jericho (comics)|Jericho]]), who helped Raven overcome her love for Forrester by destroying him and saving herself.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

[[File:EvilRavenToT.jpg|thumb|right|Evil Raven makes her appearance in the "Terror of Trigon" storyline, which began ''The New Teen Titans'' (vol. 2). Art by George Pérez.]]

Raven was later kidnapped by the [[Wildebeest (comics)#The Wildebeest Society|Wildebeest Society]] during the "Titans Hunt" storyline.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} The [[Wildebeest (comics)|Wildbeest]], led by the Trigon-possessed souls of Azarath, were going to use several Titans to bring about the return of Trigon. During a massive battle, Raven was possessed by the evil souls and once again became the evil [[doppelgänger]] of her father. Arella, along with [[Phantasm (comics)|Danny Chase]], used the power of Azar's soul to cleanse Raven; however, her body was destroyed, and Arella and Danny joined the cleansed souls of Azarath to become [[Phantasm (comics)|Phantasm]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

===Dark Raven===

The evil energy of Trigon in Raven's soul possessed a [[metahuman]]. Raven appeared possessed by her evil conscience and attempted to implant Trigon's seed into new bodies. She interrupted Nightwing and Starfire's wedding, and implanted a seed of Trigon into Starfire. Instead of corrupting her, she actually implanted the soul of the good Raven. This caused Starfire to leave Earth in order to escape from the evil Raven. The Titans were able to defeat her only because of the help they received from Phantasm.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Raven later returned, still evil, in order to destroy the good version of herself implanted in Starfire.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

===Third life===
In her spirit form, Raven wandered Earth when Brother Blood came to claim her. Her spirit was reincarnated in the body of a teenage girl by the Church of Blood. A new incarnation of the Teen Titans discovered that the Church of Blood were worshippers of Raven's father, Trigon. They also found a prophecy that told of the marriage between Brother Blood and Raven that would result in [[Armageddon]]. The team interrupted the wedding, and Raven forced the cult to escape. She then joined the Teen Titans and enrolled at a high school as "Rachel Roth" in honor of her mother's birth name.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

After her rebirth, Raven began developing romantic feelings for her teammate, Garfield Logan (a.k.a. Beast Boy), and the two became romantically attached.

After beating the Titans East, she gives hints that she still loves Garfield, but he refuses to dwell on the matter, leaving their relationship uncertain.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #47</ref>

Following the death of Bart Allen, Raven, along with the other adult Titans, decides to leave the team. Raven decides to pursue her chance at attending high school, having never had the opportunity before.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Raven stars in a five-issue miniseries written by Marv Wolfman, with art by [[Damion Scott (comics)|Damion Scott]]. It takes place during the missing year, following Raven's attempts at living as a normal teenage girl and attending high school. Unfortunately, she gets inadvertently drawn into a mystical fight for the lives of her classmates. In the ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' #177 magazine, Wolfman briefly described the series, saying, "She needs to be on her own and in charge of herself for the first time in her life. This is more than just a 'tale of Raven'; it sets up her new life."

===Titans===

Raven discovers that Trigon had more than one child, and that a trio of children devoted to her father are behind the attacks. She is affected along with many of the other Titans by these three beings. Raven's three half-brothers use her and Beast Boy as keys to open a portal to Trigon's realm. Raven uses her own power to influence greed in others to make her half-brothers steal what little power Trigon had left. The portal is closed and Trigon's sons, believing they have gained great power, leave.

Raven's half-brothers later return and provoke her demonic side, causing her to leave the Titans and join them. However, the team was able to track them down and convince Raven to join the side of good once more. She later provided a number of other artifacts, all capable of killing her, to the Titans as terms for her staying with the team.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #6</ref>

===Wyld===

Raven decided to stay with the Teen Titans, now acting as a mentor to the younger members. When the Teen Titans attempted to return home, Raven was kidnapped and taken to another dimension by Wyld.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #82</ref> Wyld reveals that Raven was the one who created him. When Raven was traveling dimensions looking for her father, her soul self caused all of the animals she visited to merge into one being: The Wyld. The Wyld is eventually destroyed by [[Static (DC Comics)|Static]].

Raven has remained with the Titans. In the final issue of this incarnation of the Titans, Beast Boy and Raven have a talk about her difficulty reading Solstice's emotions and their encounter with Headcase. Eventually, Raven starts to open up about her true feelings. While it was her inner darkness that scarred her entire life, she was even more frightened of what her feelings for Beast Boy might cause her to do. Beast Boy makes it clear he doesn't want to escape from any part of her. Touched, Raven decides that she needs to embrace the positive feelings inside her rather than just her negative ones. Beast Boy assures her this is part of being human, and points out, "I think you've worried enough about the bad....so why don't we focus on the good for a change?" With that, they share a heartfelt kiss to renew their relationship.

===New 52===
Raven makes her post-''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' debut in issue one of the ''[[Phantom Stranger]]'', as a part of the Third Wave of the [[New 52]] titles.<ref>''Phantom Stranger'' #1</ref> She is taken by the reluctant Stranger to [[Stonehenge]], the doorway from Azarath and Earth, to give her over to Trigon, her father who conquered Azarath as part of a bargain.<ref>''Phantom Stranger'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
[[File:Raven-soul.PNG|thumb|[[Beast Boy]], [[Bart Allen|Kid Flash]], [[Deathstroke]], [[Ravager]], [[Tim Drake|Robin]] and [[Starfire (comics)|Starfire]] inside Raven's soul-self. Art by [[Mike McKone]].]]
Raven has the [[psionics|psionic]] ability of [[empathy]], enabling her to feel the emotions, feelings, and sensations of others. She can use her empathy to steal emotions from others, rendering them emotionally "numb".  She is also able to force outside emotions into other people. Additionally, Raven seems to be able to absorb another person's knowledge with a touch, such as the language spoken by that person. She was shown to have the power and ability to project mental illusions into someone's memory. This unique ability is usually forgotten.

Raven can empathically absorb the pain of injured people to ease their suffering, and induce rapid healing. She has the ability to heal herself and others. She can manifest her "''Soul-Self''" through a form of [[astral projection]]. Through the use of her soul-self, Raven can project her consciousness into the mind, for therapeutic purposes. It also serves as a way to travel into other dimensions. In many instances, her soul-self has also functioned as a shield. Using her soul-self, she can convert her physical body into her "soul-self" and carry or [[Teleportation|teleport]] herself and others over vast distances in form of a giant black raven. 

Raven has also displayed the ability to control, manipulate and or generate pure shadows and darkness. This ability comes in different variations, from having supremely destructive capabilities to causing pain, tension, and fear-based illusions. In a number of instances, Raven has also displayed sorcerous abilities. In ''The New Teen Titans Annual'' #4 (1988), a villain called Muse forced the Titans into individual murderous nightmares. In her dream, Raven retaliated by flying out of his reach and then releasing energies from "within the folds of her cape" that caused him to be consumed by fire.

Like her brothers, Raven can induce and amplify one of the [[seven deadly sins]] (in her case, pride) in any living being, however doing so will cause her to suffer spells of [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]] for several days afterward as side affects. Raven expertly combines her combative fighting skills with her newly acquired teleportation ability.

[[File:Raven's Meditation.jpg|right|thumb|Raven, with her hood down, [[meditate|meditating]].]]
A much younger version of Raven appears in the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series (2003–2006), where she was one of the program's [[breakout character]]s. Her costume is relatively the same as her comic counterpart, but her blue dress is replaced with a black [[leotard]] to avoid several animation complications. Raven is depicted with light gray skin, violet-blue eyes, and shoulder-length violet-blue, bobcut-styled hair. Her origin as the daughter of the human Arella and the interdimensional demon Trigon is the same as in the comics.

The animated version of Raven (voiced by [[Tara Strong]]) chiefly employs powers which resemble telekinesis/[[psychokinesis]] encased in dark-colored mystical energy. Raven's power is displayed under various forms. She accomplishes this by putting a little piece of her spirit/soul into everything she telekinetically controls. She often chants the incantation "''Azarath Metrion Zinthos''" to focus her abilities even further, allowing her to perform much greater feats; she also uses this phrase as a [[mantra]] while [[meditating]]. She has the ability and power of levitation, as she cannot actually fly like Starfire. Raven has also been seen as a fairly good hand-to-hand combatant, although she only occasionally uses this skill during battle.

Another of Raven's chief abilities is her "Soul-Self", which allows her to detach her soul and spirit from her body in the form of a dark-energy raven. This ability can be used to enter the minds of others, [[Teleportation|teleport]] herself and others across great distances, pass through solid matter or through fire, and even alter her own appearance. Raven has displayed a number of seldom-used abilities. She can heal herself and others (to an extent), stop time, and manifest her fears as monsters unintentionally. She keeps a library of numerous spellbooks in her room on the [[occult]], as well as a number of immensely powerful items, charms and talismans. Raven's powers are entirely tied to her emotions, becoming more powerful and more unstable with the intensity of the emotions fueling them.

Raven is often giving sage advice to the others about various subjects, and generally stays calm even in desperate situations. She is also the most emotionally-restrained of the Titans, appearing secretive and distant. The reason for her emotional restraint is due to the adverse effects her emotions have on her supernatural abilities. However, she eventually warms up to her teammates and comes to see them as her family.

The fourth season serves as an adaptation of the "Terror of Trigon" arc in the ''Teen Titans'' comics, and has five episodes that focus heavily on Raven. Over the course of the first two episodes, Raven tries to avoid her destiny of becoming the portal that will release Trigon into their dimension. However, with [[Deathstroke#The Teen Titans|Slade]] having been empowered by Trigon, Raven loses hope and resigns to her fate by the third episode (The End Part 1). She leaves her teammates with a small fraction of her powers to protect them from Trigon's petrification blast when he emerges. Raven [[regression (psychology)|regresses]] into a small seven-year-old child, and is rescued from the depths of Trigon's prison by Robin. Robin and the other Titans decide to fight anyway, though they are ultimately incapable of defeating Trigon. Their efforts convince Raven to step out of her father's shadow, and she vaporizes Trigon with a pure-white version of her Soul-Self, returning the world to normal in the process. In the fifth season of the show, she starts to become more open and friendly.

Raven's only definitive [[Romance (love)|romantic]] love interests within the television series was with the dragon Malchior (who posed as the wizard warrior who vanquished him, Rorek, by having the names reversed in the book where he was trapped) in the episode "Spellbound", which ended at the end of the episode when it was revealed that he was simply using her. She had shown attraction towards Aqualad in the episode "Deep Six", though this was mainly for comedic effect. 
In the episode "[[List of Teen Titans episodes#Season 2: 2004|How Long Is Forever?]]", Starfire travels to the future via a museum artifact. During Starfire's attempt to return home, Raven is seen in her second incarnation, wearing the white robe.

In an interview, Tara Strong said, "I love playing goth characters. Out of all the goths I've played, Raven is my favorite and I love it how she is half demon and half good girl which is so different from all the other goths I have played."

===''DC Universe Online''===
Raven appears in the video game ''[[DC Universe Online]]'', voiced by [[Adriene Mishler]]. She has been possessed by her father Trigon, who has begun a demonic invasion of Metropolis and Earth, using Raven. Hero and Villain players will fight with, or against the Titans to either free or keep Raven under Trigon's control. If she is freed, she will join Hero players along with Zatanna, and Doctor Fate in battling Brother Blood, who is the catalyst for Trigon's invasion.
