'''Raven''' is a fictional [[superhero]]ine who appears in [[comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. The character first appeared in a [[DC Comics insert previews|special insert]] in ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' #26 (October 1980), and was created by writer [[Marv Wolfman]] and artist [[George Pérez]]. Raven is an [[empath]] who can [[Teleportation|teleport]] and control her "[[astral body|soul-self]]," which can fight physically, as well as act as Raven's eyes and ears away from her body. Raven's chronology is typically{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} separated into three lives. Her first life, 18 years, was spent in the [[Azarath|Temple Azarath]] and creating [[Teen Titans#New Teen Titans|The New Teen Titans]]. Her second life began once she started wearing the garb of White Raven, and lasted under two years. Her third life is her current form. Unlike the transition between her first and second lives, with her third life came a new, younger body.

==Publication history==
The character was created by Marv Wolfman and George Pérez. The description from Wolfman to Pérez was of a female Phantom Stranger type character. Pérez notes that:

{{cquote | ...the hood - which I designed to look like an actual bird's head - was my contribution, along with the fact that I wanted to give her a dress. She did not look like an action character, because she was wearing an impractical costume for action.<ref>{{cite book | last=Nolen-Weathington | first=Eric | coauthors=George Perez | title=Modern Masters Volume 2: George Pérez | publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing | page=128 | isbn=978-1893905252}}</ref>}}

==Fictional character biography==
===First life===
A character with a morbid past and origins, Raven is the half-breed daughter of a human mother named [[Arella]] and the [[demon|interdimensional demon]] [[Trigon (comics)|Trigon]]. She grew up in an alternate dimension called [[Azarath]], with [[pacifism|pacifistic]] inhabitants whose spiritual leader was the mystic Azar. In her homeland, she was taught to "control her emotions" by Azar, in order to suppress her inherited demonic powers. Essentially, it was feared that if Raven was allowed to feel any strong emotion, she could become a demon like her father.

During this time, Raven rarely saw her mother and grew detached from her. Upon Azar's death, Arella began the task of raising and teaching Raven. Around this same time, Raven's demonic heritage was revealed, as she met her father face to face for the first time. Soon after her 16th birthday, Raven learned that Trigon planned to come to her dimension; and she vowed to stop him.

[[Image:Talesofneweentitans2.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Cover of ''Tales of the New Teen Titans'' #2 (July 1982). Art by George Pérez.]]

Raven initially approached the [[Justice League]], but they refused her on the advice of [[Zatanna]], who sensed her demonic parentage{{Issue|date=April 2009}}. In desperation, she reformed the Titans as the New Teen Titans to fight her father. The team consisted of [[Robin (comics)#Dick Grayson|Robin]], [[Wonder Girl#Donna Troy|Wonder Girl]], [[Wally West|Kid Flash]], [[Starfire (comics)|Starfire]], [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]], and [[Beast Boy]]. Raven and her new friends later came to think of one another as family. In this incarnation, Raven was considered to have a gloomy disposition, often revealed through sarcasm and wry remarks.

Raven has occasionally succumbed to her emotions, leading to problems with her fellow teammates. Upon his recruitment into the team, Kid Flash agreed to be a member after Raven used her powers to coerce him into loving her. During another meeting with the Justice League, Zatanna revealed this information, which led the other Titans to mistrust Raven. Ultimately, it was revealed that she manipulated Kid Flash's emotions and removed his knowledge of the encounter in order to save his life.<ref>''Legends of the DC Universe'' #19</ref>

This separation did not last long as Trigon soon kidnapped Raven to his home dimension. The team defeated Trigon and sealed him in an interdimensional prison with the help of Arella, who stayed at the interdimensional door as Trigon's Guardian{{Issue|date=April 2009}}. However, Raven continued to fight her father's influence as he was not completely destroyed. For a period of time, Raven lost control several times in high-stress situations, but managed to regain control before Trigon could assert himself.

Popular storylines such as "The Judas Contract" took place during this period{{Issue|date=April 2009}}. Eventually, however, Trigon escaped his prison, came to Earth, and took control of Raven, destroying Azarath in the process. The Titans came together and were forced to kill Raven, thereby allowing the souls of Azarath to possess her and, guided by the spirit of Azar, who was acting through the body of the Titans' ally [[Lilith (DC Comics)|Lilith]], use her as a channel to kill Trigon. After this battle, Raven rose again from the ashes, purged of Trigon's evil, and vanished.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

====Absent during ''Crisis on Infinite Earths''====
Between the periods that we know to be Raven's first and second lives, Raven's whereabouts were unknown even to the [[Monitor (comics)|Monitor]], a character who has knowledge of all beings in all parallel dimensions that contain Earth. This suggests that during this period, Raven transcended Earth into a non-parallel dimension. Raven was briefly mentioned in one panel (issue #2, page 22), suggested as an alternative to [[Psycho-Pirate]] as an empath in the [[Monitor (comics)|Monitor's]] plans. She was also mentioned as an alternative for the [[Anti-Monitor]] in issue #5, page 2.

===Second life (White Raven)===
Later on, the minions of the Titans' enemy, [[Brother Blood]], captured Raven to control [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] (the former Robin) as part of Blood's plans of resurrection. The Titans rescued them both and prevented Brother Blood from returning. Raven then donned a white cloak to represent freedom from her father's influence.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Some time later, after being free to feel, Raven found she was able to not only sense, but control others' emotions{{Issue|date=April 2009}}. She learned to handle this power only after unintentionally making Nightwing believe that he loved her for a brief time, when she thought that she was in love with him. It was during this incident that Starfire and Raven became close friends (issue #39, page 8). Raven also fostered a relationship with [[technopath]] Eric Forrester, who was using the life force of women he seduced to regain some of his lost humanity, a result of interfacing with computers. Forrester knew that Raven's soul-self could help him to permanently retain his humanity. This attempt was cut short by the intervention of Joseph Wilson ([[Jericho (comics)|Jericho]]), who helped Raven overcome her love for Forrester by destroying him and saving herself.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

[[Image:EvilRavenToT.jpg|thumb|right|Evil Raven makes her appearance in the "Terror of Trigon" storyline, which began ''The New Teen Titans'' (vol. 2). Art by George Pérez.]]

Raven's life went on without change until she was kidnapped by the [[Wildebeest (comics)#The Wildebeest Society|Wildebeest Society]] during the "Titans Hunt" storyline.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} The [[Wildebeest (comics)|Wildebeest]], led by the Trigon-possessed souls of Azarath, were going to use several Titans to bring about the return of Trigon. During a massive battle in the remains of Azarath, Raven was possessed by the evil souls and once again became the evil [[doppelgänger]] of her father. Arella, along with [[Phantasm (comics)|Danny Chase]], used the power of Azar's soul to cleanse Raven; however, through the battle, her body was destroyed, and Arella and Danny joined the cleansed souls of Azarath to become [[Phantasm (comics)|Phantasm]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

===Dark Raven===

Now free of its bodily prison, the evil energy of Trigon in Raven's soul took on sentience and possessed a [[metahuman]] with a resemblance to Raven. Raven appeared possessed by her evil conscience and attempted to implant Trigon's seed into new bodies. She interrupted Nightwing and Starfire's wedding, and implanted a seed of Trigon into Starfire. Instead of corrupting her, she actually implanted the soul of the good Raven. This caused Starfire to leave Earth in order to escape from the evil Raven, who implanted seeds into several other superheroes as well. The Titans were able to defeat her only because of the help they received from Phantasm.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Raven later returned, still evil, in order to destroy the good version of herself implanted in Starfire.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

===Third life===
In her spirit form, Raven wandered Earth looking for her place in the world when Brother Blood came to claim her. Her spirit was reincarnated in the body of a teenage girl by the Church of Blood. A new incarnation of the Teen Titans discovered that the Church of Blood were worshippers of Raven's father, Trigon. They also found a prophecy that told of the marriage between Brother Blood and Raven that would result in [[Armageddon]]. The team interrupted the wedding, and Raven forced the cult to escape. She then joined the Teen Titans and enrolled at a high school as "Rachel Roth" in honor of her mother's birth name.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

After her rebirth, Raven began developing romantic feelings for her teammate, Garfield Logan (a.k.a. Beast Boy), and the two recently became romantically attached.

====''Infinite Crisis'' and ''52''====
:''Main articles: [[Infinite Crisis]] and [[52 (comics)|52]]''

Due to the effects of the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]]'s destruction of magic during the "[[Day of Vengeance]]" storyline, Raven's magical powers weaken and slip out of her control. She continues to fight, helping the Titans both in evacuating the shattered city of [[Blüdhaven]] and with battling [[Superboy-Prime]].

During the [[52 (comics)|missing year]], Raven assists [[John Henry Irons|Steel]] in launching an attack on Lexcorp when [[Natasha Irons]] was captured by [[Lex Luthor]]. The Titans (consisting of Beast Boy, Raven, [[Young Frankenstein (comics)|Young Frankenstein]], [[Hawk and Dove]], [[Zachary Zatara]], and [[Terra (comics)|Terra]]) fight [[Black Adam]] in [[Greece]] and the [[Himalayas]]. Raven attempts to stop Black Adam, but he shatters her soul-self and causes her to experience psychic backlash from the deaths of Young Frankenstein and Terra.<ref>[[World War III (DC Comics)|World War III]]</ref>

{{Main|One Year Later}}

[[Image:Ravenoyl.png|185px|left|thumb|Raven's new look in "One Year Later".]]
Raven quits the team after she and Beast Boy end their relationship. She tells the unconscious Cyborg that Beast Boy was stressed by being team leader, and she even compares him with Nightwing.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #37</ref> Letting the others think she is leaving because of Gar, Raven actually leaves because she has uncovered a secret of one of the other Titans.

After teleporting for an entire night, Raven runs from unseen pursuers, with a book of unclear significance.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #38</ref> Raven has a diskette containing Jericho's soul. She performs a cleansing ritual over his soul and transfers it into a new body<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #40</ref> before returning to the team as a full member.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #41</ref>

Raven is later approached by Robin and [[Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark)|Wonder Girl]], in the hopes that she could resurrect [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]] like she did Jericho.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #43</ref> Unfortunately, Raven declares that impossible because Superboy's soul had moved on to the afterlife, while Jericho's soul was kept on a computer disk. Without warning, the Titans are captured by the villainous [[Titans East]] and transported to the original Titans Island in [[New York]], where Raven is placed in the "care" of [[Enigma (DC Comics)|Enigma]] and [[Duela Dent]], who took to torturing her psychologically. Raven manages her escape by offering Duela membership into the true Titans group. After knocking Enigma and [[Risk (comics)|Risk]] unconscious, Raven, Duela, and Cyborg get reinforcements in the form of Nightwing, [[Donna Troy|Troia]], Beast Boy, and [[Bart Allen]]. After beating the Titans East, she reveals hints that she still loves Gar, but he refuses to dwell on the matter, leaving their relationship uncertain.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #47</ref>

Following the death of Bart Allen, Raven, along with the other adult Titans, decides to leave the team. Raven decides to pursue her chance at attending high school, having never had the opportunity before.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Raven stars in a five-issue miniseries written by Marv Wolfman, with art by [[Damion Scott]]. It takes place during the missing year, following Raven's attempts at living as a normal teenage girl and attending high school. Unfortunately, she gets inadvertently drawn into a mystical fight for the lives of her classmates. In the ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' #177 magazine, Wolfman briefly described the series, saying, "She needs to be on her own and in charge of herself for the first time in her life. This is more than just a 'tale of Raven'; it sets up her new life."

===Titans===
In the latest relaunch title, ''Titans'', Raven and a group of classmates are attacked by a demonic creature, sent by Raven's resurrected father, Trigon. She soon joins Beast Boy, Donna Troy, [[Roy Harper (comics)|Red Arrow]], Starfire, [[Flash (comics)|Flash]], and Nightwing at New York's Titans Island, where Cyborg and his Teen Titans team were attacked by [[Deathstroke]] and the villainous Titans East. These events lead to the creation of the newest team of Titans, which consists of the original New Teen Titans.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #4</ref>

In the following issue, Raven discovers that Trigon had more than one child, and that a trio of children devoted to her father are behind the attacks. She is affected along with many of the other Titans by these three beings, who prey on the strongest emotions present in the group at the time (such as Nightwing and Starfire giving in to long suppressed longing for one another; and Flash and Donna Troy's mild envy taken to extremes in a usually calm social interaction). For Raven and Beast Boy, the emotion used against them is their subdued rage and insecurity toward themselves and each other. Raven is attacked at one point by an incensed Gar, but their fight is broken up by the remaining Titans when they begin to gradually recover from the attack. Raven's three half-brothers then use her and Beast Boy as keys to open a portal to Trigon's realm. Raven uses her own power to influence greed in others to make her half-brothers steal what little power Trigon had left. The portal is closed and Trigon's sons, believing they have gained great power, leave the scene.

While Raven and Beast Boy go out together on a "not-a-date," she informs him that, since meeting her half-brothers, she has felt herself being tempted by her father's evil power and fears she will once again turn evil. Although Beast Boy rejects the idea, Raven's fear is made real as her half-brothers later return and provoke her demonic side, causing her to leave the Titans and join them. However, the team was able to track them down and convince Raven to join the side of good once more with the help of a mystical artifact Raven gave Donna Troy should such a situation ever arise. She later provided a number of other artifacts, all capable of killing her, to the Titans as terms for her staying with the team.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #6</ref> However, the experience plays a hand in Raven ultimately electing not to pursue a renewed relationship with Beast Boy.

Raven aided the Titans in capturing [[Match (DC Comics)|Match]], who went on a rampage with Jericho trapped inside of him. Through her powers, she discovered that Jericho was actually in control of Match, not the other way around. Before she could warn the other Titans, Jericho used a device to temporarily knock out the lights. When the back-up generator kicked in, Jericho was gone, and Nightwing deduces he must have possessed one of the Titans in the confusion.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #7</ref>

===Wyld===
With the Titans in a state of disarray in the wake of ''[[Justice League: Cry For Justice]]'', Raven left the team and was promptly attacked by a demonic being calling itself '''Wyld'''.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #75</ref> Battered and dazed, Raven arrived at [[Titans Tower]], where she was rescued by the newest roster of Teen Titans. While she was recovering, Beast Boy stated that he was still in love with her and would remain so, despite whatever difficulties were involved.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #76</ref>

Raven decided to stay with the Teen Titans rather than return to the Titans, now acting as a mentor to the younger members. During a mission to Dakota to rescue the kidnapped [[Static (DC Comics)|Static]], Raven was accidentally knocked into a coma by [[Miss Martian]], who had attempted to fire a psychic blast at villain named [[Holocaust (DC Comics)|Holocaust]].<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #81</ref> When the Teen Titans attempted to return home, Raven was kidnapped and taken to another dimension by Wyld, who had disguised himself as one of Holocaust's scientists.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #82</ref> While in Wyld's dimension, Raven was confronted by a gray-skinned teenager who claimed to be her son.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #86</ref>

The teenager was discovered to be the human form of the Wyld who revealed that Raven was the one who created him. When Raven was traveling dimensions looking for her father, her soul self caused all of the animals of the last dimension she visited to merge into one being: The Wyld. The Wyld also revealed that should he kill Raven during the arriving eclipse on his world, he would gain all her powers. Despite the arrival of the eclipse and overpowering most of the Titans, The Wyld is eventually destroyed by Static (who loses his powers as a result)

Following this, Raven has remained with the Titans. Recently, she has become unnerved by the positive aura and feedback she receives from Solstice when reading her emotions. In the 100th and final issue of this incarnation of the Teen Titans, Raven admits that she has been fleeing from the darkness within for too long now, and vows to find balance between both the dark and light. She solidifies this claim by confirming her feelings for [[Beast Boy]], whom with she finds the most reason to experience a life beyond her dark upbringing. Beast Boy reminds her that taking good with the bad is part of being human, and they cement their love with a passionate kiss. This is the final scene of them before the narrative leaves the mainstream universe, and to the new DC universe created by the crossover event, Flashpoint.

==Powers and abilities==
[[Image:Raven-soul.PNG|thumb|The Titans, [[Deathstroke]], and [[Rose Wilson|Ravager]] inside Raven's soul-self. Art by [[Mike McKone]].]]
Raven has the [[psionics|psionic]] ability of [[empathy]], enabling her to feel the feelings of others. She can use her empathy to steal emotions from others, rendering them emotionally "numb".  She is also able to force outside emotions into other people, consciously or otherwise. She has used this ability many times, first notably on Wally West, in order to save his life.<ref>''Legends of the DC Universe'' #18</ref> Later, after being freed from her father's powers and starting her second life, she had a short-lived romance with [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] and unintentionally used her power to make him believe that he did love her, but it ended when [[Starfire (comics)|Starfire]], who became her close friend, convinced her that she wasn't really in love with Dick Grayson as she thought.  Additionally, Raven seems to be able to absorb another person's knowledge with a touch, such as the language spoken by that person.  Shortly after the character was introduced, she was shown to have the power and ability to project mental illusions into someone's memory (see Ravager in ''The New Teen Titans'' #4).  She has also used this on the villainess [[Phobia (comics)|Phobia]], but this power and ability is usually forgotten{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}.

Raven can absorb the pain of injured people to ease their suffering, and induce rapid healing. There is some ambiguity as to what happens to the pains Raven takes in after she has healed another person. In some sources (''New Titans'' #50) it is stated that Raven feels these pains for the rest of her life and merely accepts them. Opposing sources (''Who's Who'' Vol. 1) state that once Raven takes others' pains into her body, they are then expunged. She has the ability to heal herself and others, as she did when defying Trigon's curse against a young girl. 

Raven can manifest her "''Soul-Self''" through a form of [[astral projection]].  It normally takes the form of either her human shape or a giant raven.  Through the use of her soul-self, Raven can project her consciousness into the mind, for therapeutic purposes (to aid in her own meditation, or to help calm an agitated ally), or for offensive attacks, rendering her enemies unconscious (yet otherwise unharmed) or being destructive in other variations. It also serves as a way to travel into other dimensions. In many instances, her soul-self has also functioned as a "shield," although it seems to absorb attackers and projectiles rather than repel them. In ''The New Teen Titans'' vol. 1 #17 (1982), she used this ability a few times to absorb the objects that [[Magenta (comics)|Frances Kane]] had uncontrollably drawn towards herself. These objects included all manner of household appliances, eventually progressing to larger objects such as road signs and steel bars. However, Raven admitted during the issue that she could not sustain her soul-self long under such conditions. Her soul-self also 'regurgitated' the objects after the danger. 

Using her soul-self, she can convert her physical body into her 'soul-self' and carry/[[Teleportation|teleport]] (or rather, use portals to move between dimensions) herself and others over vast distances. 

Raven has also displayed the ability to manipulate and or generate shadows and darkness. This ability comes in different variations, from having destructive capabilities to causing pain, tension, and fear-based illusions to whomever or whatever is caught in its range. This power and ability was displayed when Raven traveled to Conner Kent's farm (Teen Titans #26, 2003) in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] and expels a large aura of darkness from her cloak to Kent in which he began to express severe pain.

In ''The New Teen Titans'' foundation storyline, Raven explained she was able to predict Trigon's invasion of the Earth-2 dimension. She was unable to control or consciously activate it, but happens occasionally. It is unknown whether she still possesses this ability in her current body. 

During the ''[[Our Worlds at War]]'' storyline, Raven was instrumental in helping the heroes defeat their enemies by channeling the combined spiritual strength and faith of the Amazons to restoring a severely wounded and weakened [[Darkseid]] to his full strength, a feat that amazed even Darkseid.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' vol. 2 #173</ref>

In a number of instances, Raven has also displayed sorcerous abilities. In ''New Titans'' #65, the last issue of the Titan Plague arc, an infected Raven forces unconsciousness upon a then-neophyte [[Tim Drake]] with a touch of her finger, and was able to slam Nightwing aside and suspend him upside-down with imperious gestures. In ''The New Teen Titans Annual'' #4 (1988), a villain called Muse forced the Titans into individual murderous nightmares. In her dream, Raven retaliated by flying out of his reach and then releasing energies from "within the folds of her cape" that caused him to be consumed by fire. These abilities could be dismissed as being only part of her nightmare, except that none of the other Titans displayed abilities besides their normal powers in their nightmares.  In the ''Family Lost'' storyline of current Teen Titans continuity (''Teen Titans'' vol. 3 #8-12), shortly after being resurrected by Brother Blood (Sebastian), a captive Raven tries to summon the Titans through ominous signs, such as possessing several psychics and Beast Boy with her soul-self, by turning a river into blood, animating the skeletal remains of her demon father Trigon, and drawing swarms of migratory birds to her location.

Like her brothers, Raven can induce and amplify one of the [[seven deadly sins]] (in her case, pride) in any living being, however doing so will cause her to suffer spells of [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]] for several days afterward.

Raven has been depicted as an adept hand-to-hand combatant and expertly combines her fighting skills with her teleportation ability. This was revealed in Titans #18 (December 2009). The only other time she displayed any fighting prowess was while she was under the influence of Brother Blood, where she engaged then-Wonder Girl Donna Troy and boasted that, with Blood's gifts, they were easily equals. Why Raven rarely uses her fighting skills or where she truly acquired them have yet to be explained.

==Other versions==

[[Image:Raven's Meditation.jpg|right|thumb|Raven, with her hood down, [[meditate|meditating]].]]
A much younger version of Raven appears in the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series (2003–2006), where she was one of the program's [[breakout character]]s. Her costume is relatively the same as her comic counterpart, but her skirt is replaced with a [[leotard]] to avoid several animation complications. She wears a chain [[belt (clothing)|belt]] around her waist as well. Raven is depicted with light gray skin, violet-blue eyes, and shoulder-length violet-blue, bobcut styled hair. Her origin as the daughter of the human Arella and the almighty interdimensional demon Trigon is the same as in the comics.

The animated version of Raven (voiced by [[Tara Strong]]) chiefly employs powers which resemble telekinesis/[[psychokinesis]] encased in dark-colored mystical energy. She accomplishes this, as described in the episode "Car Trouble", by putting a little piece of her spirit/soul into everything she telekinetically controls. She occasionally chants the incantation "''Azarath Metrion Zinthos''" to focus her abilities even further, allowing her to perform much greater feats, but can move, levitate and control inanimate objects without reciting it; she also uses this phrase as a [[mantra]] while [[meditating]]. She also has the ability and power of levitation, as she cannot actually fly like Starfire.

Another of Raven's chief abilities is her "Soul-Self", which allows her to detach her soul and spirit from her body in the form of a dark-energy raven. This ability can be used to enter the minds of others, [[Teleportation|teleport]] herself and others across great distances, pass through solid matter such as floors, walls and ceilings, and even alter her own physical appearance (typically increasing and decreasing her size). In addition to her normal abilities, Raven has displayed a number of seldom-used abilities. She can magically heal herself and others (to an extent), sense specific people over short distances, stop time (done under great duress or stress and never repeated), and manifest her fears as monsters (also unintentional). She also occasionally employs a variety magical, mystical spells and incantations mostly seen in the episode "Spellbound". She keeps a library of numerous magical spellbooks in her room on the [[occult]], mysticism and magical level, as well as a number of immensely strong and powerful mystical items, charms and talismans. Raven's powers are entirely tied to her emotions, becoming much stronger and more powerful and more unstable with the intensity of the emotions fueling them.

Raven is often giving sage advice to the others about various subjects, and generally stays calm even in desperate situations. She is also the most emotionally-restrained of the Titans, appearing secretive and distant; she initially does not allow any of her fellow Titans into her room and spends most of her time by herself, usually meditating or reading one of her numerous spellbooks. The reason for her emotional restraint is due to the adverse effects her emotions have on her supernatural abilities, as demonstrated when she brutally attacked [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Doctor Light]] after being angered (even as he begged for mercy), seen in the episode "Nevermore." However, she eventually warms up to her teammates and comes to see them as her family.

The fourth season serves as an adaptation of the "Terror of Trigon" arc in the ''Teen Titans'' comics, and thus focuses heavily on Raven. Over the course of the season, Raven tries to avoid her destiny of becoming the portal that will release Trigon into their dimension. However, with [[Deathstroke#The Teen Titans|Slade]] having been empowered by Trigon and given an army of fire demons to command, Raven loses hope and resigns herself to her fate. Despite this, she leaves her teammates with a small fraction of her abilities and powers to protect them from Trigon's petrification blast when he emerges. As a result of becoming the portal, Raven [[regression (psychology)|regresses]] into a small seven-year-old child, and is rescued from the depths of Trigon's prison by Robin, amidst protests that she is now powerless and of no use to them. Robin and the other Titans decide to fight anyway, though they are ultimately incapable of defeating Trigon. Their efforts convince Raven to step out of her father's shadow, and she vaporizes Trigon with a pure-white version of her Soul-Self, returning the world to normal in the process. She returns to using her more recognizable dark telekinetic energy in the following season.

Raven's character is noticeably different in the fifth season of the show. Most likely because she is no longer living in her father's shadow, she starts to become more open. While she does retain some of her old personality such as not laughing at Beast Boy's jokes and still acting mysterious, she does act more friendly and at least tries to say nice things (where as before she would just blow off things in a sarcastic way). In one episode she even babysits three children and even starts to really care for them by the end of the episode.

Raven's only definitive [[Romance (love)|romantic]] interests within the television series was with the dragon Malchior in the episode "Spellbound", which ended at the end of the episode when it was revealed that he was simply using her to escape from the confines of the magic, mystical spellbook he was trapped within, and showing attraction towards Aqualad in the episode "Deep Six", an emotion shared by Starfire, even though this was mainly for comedic effects. Although she is with [[Changeling]]/[[Beast Boy]] in the comics, they do not progress past being extremely close friends in the show.

In another example of comic book continuity, in the episode "[[List of Teen Titans episodes#Season 2: 2004|How Long Is Forever?]]", Starfire travels to the future via an artifact in a museum. During her attempt to find the artifact and return home, Raven is seen in her second incarnation, wearing the white robe.

In an interview, Tara Strong said, "I love playing goth characters. Out of all the goths I've played, Raven is my favorite and I love it how she is half demon and half good girl which is so different from all the other goths I have played."{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

===Live-action television series on The CW===
