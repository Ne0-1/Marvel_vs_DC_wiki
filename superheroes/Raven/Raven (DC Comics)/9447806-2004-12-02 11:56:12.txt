'''Raven''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]].  


'''In the Teen Titans comics'''

She is a prominent member of the [[Teen Titans]].  

She possesses psychic and telekinetic powers and the ability to heal wounds. 

A dark, moody character, Raven is the halfbreed daughter of a human mother and the demon overlord [[Trigon]].  She grew up in a pacifist place called [[Azarath]], where she was taught to "control her emotions" in order to suppress and control [[Trigon]]'s demonic powers that she was born with.  

She reformed the Titans as the New Teen Titans to fight her father.


'''In the Teen Titans animated series'''

She is a prominent member of the [[Teen Titans]].

Raven is straightforward, moody as well as sarcastic. However, she does show signs that she cares very much for her friends.

In the Animated Series, her powers are pretty much the same as in the comics, execpt for the fact that she has to say "Azarath, Metrion, Zinthos!" to help her focus her powers.

Raven often has a complex that her fellow Titans don't like her--probably because she's the daughter of a demon and has a very unique and complex lifestyle that her friends don't really understand.  Her room inside [[Titans Tower]] is decorated with things from her past as well as statues and pictures about of the creepy-crawlies her powers like to conjure up. Needless to say, she gets mortally offended when anyone steps foot in it.

She has to meditate often to make sure her powers remain at bay.  When she gets excessively emotional, her powers tend to take a form, called her "Soul Self".  (Her soul self is not recognized by that name in the animation, but it is featured.)  Her soul-self tends to take the form of demonic under-the-bed sort of creatures, like pitch black four-eyed baby birds or rats, or obviously, a giant raven.  Worse of all, when she can't control her anger, she transforms into a pitch-black Raven with four eyes!  (The four eyes seem to symbolize [[Trigon]].)
