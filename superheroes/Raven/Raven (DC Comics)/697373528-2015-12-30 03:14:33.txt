==Fictional character biography==

===First life of Raven===
Raven is the half-human and half-demon daughter of an Azarathian human mother named [[Arella]] and the [[demon|interdimensional demon]] [[Trigon (comics)|Trigon]]. Raven was conceived as the result of Trigon's [[rape]] of Arella. Raven grew up in an alternate dimension called [[Azarath]], with [[pacifism|pacifistic]] inhabitants whose spiritual leader was the mystic Azar. She was taught to "control her emotions" by Azar, in order to suppress her inherited demonic powers. Initially it was feared that if Raven were ever to feel any strong emotion, she could then become possessed by her father's evil demonic energy inside of her.

During this time, Raven rarely saw her mother and grew detached from her. Upon Azar's death, Arella began the task of raising and teaching Raven. Around this same time, she met her father face to face for the first time. Soon after her 16th birthday, Raven learned that Trigon planned to come to her dimension; she vowed to stop him.

[[File:Talesofnewteentitans2.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Cover of ''Tales of the New Teen Titans'' #2 (July 1982). Art by George Pérez.]]

Raven initially approached the [[Justice League]] for help, but they refused her on the advice of [[Zatanna]], who sensed her demonic parentage.<ref>New Teen Titans (vol. 1) #4</ref> In desperation, she reformed the Titans as the New Teen Titans to fight her father. The team consisted of [[Dick Grayson|Robin]], [[Wally West|Kid Flash]], [[Starfire (comics)|Starfire]], [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]], and [[Beast Boy]]. Raven and her new friends later came to think of one another as family.

Trigon soon kidnapped Raven to his home dimension. The team defeated Trigon and sealed him in an interdimensional prison with the help of Arella, who stayed at the interdimensional door as Trigon's Guardian.<ref>New Teen Titans (vol. 1) #6</ref> However, Raven continued to fight her father's influence, as he was not completely destroyed. For a period of time, Raven lost control several times in stressful situations, but managed to regain control before Trigon could assert himself.

Eventually, Trigon escaped his prison, came to Earth, and took control of Raven, destroying Azarath in the process. The Titans were manipulated to kill Raven, thereby allowing the souls of Azarath contained inside the ring of Azar to possess her and use her as a channel to kill Trigon. After this battle, Raven rose from the ashes, purged of Trigon's evil, and vanished.<ref>New Teen Titans (vol. 2) #1-5</ref>

===Raven===
After Raven's disappearance, Arella went around the world in search of Raven. She tracked her down but both of them were kidnapped by [[Brother Blood]].  The minions of Brother Blood used Raven to control [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] (Formerly Robin) as part of Blood's plans. The Titans rescued them both and prevented Brother Blood from returning to power.<ref>New Teen Titans (vol. 2) #31</ref>

As a result of the defeat of Trigon, Raven was free to experience emotions for the first time in her life. Raven found she was able to not only sense, but control others' emotions.<ref>New Teen Titans (vol. 2) #32</ref> She learned to handle this power only after unintentionally making Nightwing believe that he loved her when she thought that she was in love with him. Raven also fostered a relationship with [[technopath]] Eric Forrester, who was using the life force of women he seduced to regain some of his lost humanity. Forrester knew that Raven's soul-self could help him to permanently retain his humanity. This attempt was cut short by the intervention of Joseph Wilson ([[Jericho (comics)|Jericho]]), who helped Raven overcome her love for Forrester by destroying Forrester and saving Raven.<ref>New Titans #67</ref>

[[File:EvilRavenToT.jpg|thumb|upright|Evil Raven makes her appearance in the "Terror of Trigon" storyline, which began ''The New Teen Titans'' (vol. 2). Art by George Pérez]]

Raven was later kidnapped by the [[Wildebeest (comics)#The Wildebeest Society|Wildebeest Society]] during the "Titans Hunt" storyline.<ref>New Titans #71</ref> The [[Wildebeest (comics)|Wildbeest]], led by the Trigon-possessed souls of Azarath, were going to use several Titans to bring about the return of Trigon. During a massive battle, Raven was possessed by the evil souls and once again became the evil [[doppelgänger]] of her father. Arella, along with [[Phantasm (comics)|Danny Chase]], used the power of Azar's soul to cleanse Raven; in the result, her body was destroyed, and Arella and Danny sacrificed themselves and joined the cleansed souls of Azarath to become [[Phantasm (comics)|Phantasm]].<ref>New Titans #84</ref>

===Bad Raven===
Raven appeared possessed by her evil conscience and attempted to implant Trigon's seed into new bodies. She interrupted Nightwing and Starfire's wedding, and implanted a seed of Trigon into Starfire. Instead of corrupting her, she actually implanted the soul of the good Raven. This caused Starfire to leave Earth in order to escape from the evil Raven. The Titans were able to defeat her only because of the help they received from Phantasm.<ref>New Titans #121</ref>

Raven later returned, still evil, in order to destroy the good version of herself implanted in Starfire. With the help of the Titans, Evil Raven was reduced to ashes, and the good part of Raven was given a new, golden spirit body, which was completely free of her father's demonic influence. In New Tamaran, Starfire and the golden spirit form of Raven revealed that implanting Raven's soul in Starfire was actually her plan to get rid of her demonic soul.<ref>New Titans #130</ref>

===Spirit===
In her bodiless spirit form Raven returned to earth to help extract Cyborg's soul and consciousness from the Technis planet's computer mind.<ref>JLA vs Titans #1-3</ref> Still later, she was instrumental in defeating Imperiex by aiding Wonder Woman and Tempest in re-powering Darkseid.<ref>Wonder Woman (vol. 2 #173</ref> As a spirit, Raven wandered the earth, looking for her place in the world.

===Rebirth===
While the spirit of Raven was looking for her place in the world, Brother Blood came to claim her. Her spirit was instilled into the body of a teenage girl by the Church of Blood. The Teen Titans (reformed again), discovered that the Church of Blood were worshipers of Raven's father, Trigon. They also found a prophecy which told of the marriage between Brother Blood and Raven that would result in Armageddon. The new team interrupted the wedding, and Raven forced the cult to escape. She then joined the new Teen Titans and enrolled at a high school as Rachel Roth, using her mother Arella's original last name. {{Issue|date=April 2009}}

After her rebirth, Raven began developing romantic feelings for her teammate, Garfield Logan (a.k.a. Beast Boy), and the two became romantically attached.

===''52''===
In [[52 (comics)|''52'']], after the death of [[Conner Kent|Superboy]], the Titans are beginning to fall apart. [[Tim Drake|Robin]] joins [[Batman]] and [[Cassie Sandsmark|Wonder Girl]] leaves the team. Beast Boy struggles to maintain the team, but new members who join are only interested in seeking fame and honor through joining the team, rather than actually looking to fulfill justice. So when Beast Boy decides to help [[John Henry Irons|Steel]] on a mission, most of the members leave, leaving only Raven and [[Zachary Zatara|Zatara]]. Later, Beast Boy, Raven, [[Offspring (comics)|Offspring]] and [[Aquagirl (Lorena Marquez)|Aquagirl]] aid Steel in launching an attack on [[Lexcorp]]. Raven also participated in [[World War III (DC Comics)|World War III]]. Eventually, Robin, Wonder Girl, and a few new members join the Titans, making the team whole again. Beast Boy and Raven are among the only members that remained in the team during this period.

===="One Year Later"====
{{Main|One Year Later}}
[[File:Raven's new look in one year later.jpg|upright|thumb|Raven's new look in "One Year Later"]]

Raven quits the team after she and Beast Boy end their relationship.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #37</ref> Letting the others think she is leaving because of Garfield, Raven actually leaves because she has uncovered a secret of one of the other Titans.

Raven takes advantage of this power with a book of unclear significance.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #38</ref> Raven has a diskette containing Jericho's soul. She performs a cleansing ritual over his soul and transfers it into a new body<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #40</ref> before returning to the team as a full member.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #41</ref>

Without warning, the Titans are captured by the villainous [[Titans East]] and transported to the original Titanhj bys Island in [[New York]], where Raven is placed in the "care" of [[Enigma (DC Comics)|Enigma]] and [[Duela Dent]], who took to torturing her psychologically. Raven manages her escape. After beating the Titans East, she gives hints that she still loves Garfield, but he refuses to dwell on the matter, leaving their relationship uncertain.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #47</ref>

Following the death of Bart Allen, Raven, along with the other adult Titans, decides to leave the team. Raven decides to pursue her chance at attending high school, having never had the opportunity before.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Raven stars in a five-issue miniseries written by Marv Wolfman, with art by [[Damion Scott (comics)|Damion Scott]]. It takes place during the missing year, following Raven's attempts at living as a normal teenage girl and attending high school. Unfortunately, she gets inadvertently drawn into a mystical fight involving the [[Medusa Mask]] and has to battle for the lives of her classmates. In the ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' #177 magazine, Wolfman briefly described the series, saying, "She needs to be on her own and in charge of herself for the first time in her life. This is more than just a 'tale of Raven'; it sets up her new life."

===Titans===

Raven discovers that Trigon had more than one child, and that a trio of children devoted to her father are behind the attacks. She is affected along with many of the other Titans by these three beings. Raven's three half-brothers use her and Beast Boy as keys to open a portal to Trigon's realm. Raven uses her own power to influence greed in others to make her half-brothers steal what little power Trigon had left. The portal is closed and Trigon's sons, believing they have gained great power, leave.

Raven's half-brothers later return and provoke her demonic side, causing her to leave the Titans and join them. However, the team was able to track them down and convince Raven to join the side of good once more. She later provided a number of other artifacts, all capable of killing her, to the Titans as terms for her staying with the team.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #6</ref>

===Wyld===
[[File:BB Rae Kiss.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Beast Boy and Raven share a romantic kiss cementing their love for each other.]]
With the Titans in a state of disarray in the wake of ''[[Justice League: Cry For Justice]]'', Raven left the team and was promptly attacked by a demonic being calling itself '''Wyld'''.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #75</ref> Battered and dazed, Raven arrived at [[Titans Tower]], where she was rescued by the newest roster of Teen Titans. While she was recovering, Beast Boy stated that he was still in love with her and would remain so, despite whatever difficulties were involved.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #76</ref>

Raven decided to stay with the Teen Titans, now acting as a mentor to the younger members. When the Teen Titans attempted to return home, Raven was kidnapped and taken to another dimension by Wyld.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #82</ref> Wyld reveals that Raven was the one who created him. When Raven was traveling dimensions looking for her father, her soul self caused all of the animals she visited to merge into one being: The Wyld. The Titans enter the Wyld World to rescue Raven. The Wyld is eventually destroyed by [[Static (DC Comics)|Static]].

In the final issue of this incarnation of the Titans, [[Superboy-Prime]] and his [[Legion of Doom (DC Comics)|Legion of Doom]] attack Titan's Tower. Raven stops [[Bart Allen|Kid Flash]] just before he can kill [[Inertia (DC Comics)|Inertia]]. Then she reveals her soul-self to Headcase, terrifying and in so defeating him. After the Legion of Doom is defeated and Superboy-Prime is bound to the [[Source Wall]], Beast Boy and Raven have a talk about her difficulty in reading [[Solstice (comics)|Solstice]]'s emotions, and their encounter with Headcase. Eventually, Raven starts to open up about her true feelings. While it was her inner darkness that scarred her entire life, she was even more frightened of what her love for Beast Boy might cause her to do. Beast Boy makes it clear he doesn't want to escape from any part of her. Touched, Raven decides that she needs to embrace the positive feelings inside her rather than just her negative ones. Beast Boy assures her this is part of being human, and points out, "I think you've worried enough about the bad....so why don't we focus on the good for a change?" With that, they share a heartfelt kiss to renew their relationship and ultimately embrace their love for each other.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #100</ref> {{Clear}}

===The New 52===
[[File:Raven Kenneth Rocafort.jpg|thumbnail|right|Raven in the New 52. Art by [[Kenneth Rocafort]].]]

After the events of [[Flashpoint (comics)|''Flashpoint'']], the history of the DC Universe was altered, resulting in [[The New 52]]. Raven makes her New 52 debut in the first issue of the ''[[Phantom Stranger]]''. There she is shown as a girl in a black and white striped sweater becoming distraught at a funeral over the level of overwhelming emotion that is emanating from the people there. The Phantom Stranger takes Raven to [[Stonehenge]], the portal between Earth and the realm of Trigon. Being told by a "higher power" what must be done, the reluctant Stranger unwillingly hands her over to Trigon.

===Teen Titans===
Raven makes her first ''Teen Titans'' appearance in ''Teen Titans'' #16. Raven, sporting a new costume, is introduced by [[Trigon (comics)|Trigon]] as his "Black Bird of Terror" to his minions. It is strongly suggested that Raven has been controlling Robin's emotions. During Trigon's invasion on Earth, she approaches a near dead [[Beast Boy]] who had been assaulted by [[Deathstroke]] earlier in the remains of the [[The Ravagers (comics)|Ravagers]] facility.<ref>The Ravagers #12</ref> After being touched by Raven, Beast Boy awakens and when he asks if Harvest has sent her, she apologizes stating that she brought him into the fray much sooner than she expected and says: "Hush. We are birds of a feather now... You are mine to control" as Raven mind-controls him and teleports them to New York where Trigon and the Teen Titans are in battle.<ref>Teen Titans #19</ref>

===Raven's origins revisited===
Trigon reveals more of Raven's origins. He has a son from each world he's conquered, but Raven is his only daughter. Trigon let Raven's mother, [[Arella]], live because he considered that Raven needed to be raised by humans so she could recreate the seven under realms in her own image. Arella fled with her daughter to Azarath where the monks taught her how to control her dark side and avoid Trigon's influence on her. Years later, she escaped from Azarath in order to protect her mentors and planet from Trigon and fled to the Earth where Phantom Stranger captured her for Trigon.{{issue|date=October 2014}}

Raven spent time in the under-realms where time flows faster or was compressed. Trigon thought he only needed to liberate her and not control her to make Raven have her own image. Apparently impressed, Trigon handed her the Throne of the Under-realms to rule the place as Queen.{{issue|date=October 2014}}

===Return of Trigon===
Back in New York, Trigon's three sons, Belial, Ruskoff, and Suge, assault the Teen Titans to take Raven back. Raven, Beast Boy, and the Titans defeat them, but Trigon himself appears again and takes control of the Titans save for Red Robin, Raven and Beast Boy. The manipulated Titans attack, and while Raven and Beast Boy distract them and Trigon, Tim cuts through Trigon's eyes with his inertrite wings. Trigon, pulling out the wings from his eyes, compliments Timmy before suddenly disappearing. Soon after, a woman and a group of suited men come through a portal, informing that they will take [[Psimon]] into custody and make the incident appear as if it had never happened. When questioned about the police officers Psimon has killed, the woman reveals it has been an hallucination by Trigon, so therefore it has never happened.

Raven and Beast Boy are re-accepted into the Teen Titans. Raven brings controversy to the team by revealing the flirtatious relationships Tim had when under Trigon's control. Raven goes into her room, leaving the awkward situation behind. There, she summons her father, saying, "Father, I am one of them. Your plan worked perfectly," leaving questions on what side she is really playing for.

Meanwhile, Tim calls Raven aside, telling that if something happens to him, the team will look up to her to lead them.

===''Forever Evil''===
After the events of "[[Trinity War]]", the Earth's greatest heroes are gone and the [[Crime Syndicate]] has taken over the world. The Teen Titans challenge the Crime Syndicate, but are easily overpowered by [[Johnny Quick]] and [[Atomica]] and then flung into the time stream. While the Titans are constantly flung through time', Raven is sent a few thousand years back in time. There she is challenged by [[Etrigan]], who recognizes her as Trigon's daughter and tries to kill her. Raven is saved by Wonder Girl, who suggests that the way to stop Raven's powers, since she was born and raised in a world between worlds, is to manipulate the energy within the time stream. Raven succeeds in anchoring the Titans with her soul-self, teleporting them through time.

The Titans arrive 20 years into the future, where the [[Superboy (Jon Lane Kent)|Son of Superman]] has massacred most of Earth's superheroes, leaving only a few including Animal Man(Gar Logan) and Rose Wilson. Superboy Kon-El and Jon battle, and Kon triumphs. But Kon is sent elsewhere by an unknown power, and a severely injured Jon is swapped unknowingly as Superboy by Logan and Wilson. The Titans depart again, now to an alien planet the 31st century, where Kid Flash is actually a rebel leader and war criminal, Bar Torr. While the Titans stay to witness the Trial of Kid Flash, Raven deduces Superboy is actually Jon, and helps send him back to the present time so that he can find a cure for his deteriorating body condition.

Leaving Kid Flash and Solstice in the future, the Titans return to their original time and are united with Bunker, Beast Boy, and Skitter. Raven finds out that their journey has severed Trigon's control over her. Followed by an attack by the villain Grimm, the Titans plan a final attack on Harvest's new colony. Raven is reluctant to join because of her past actions, but Bunker tells her that everybody deserves a second chance, and Raven changes her mind. In the colony, they are surprised to find that everyone is returned to normal, and even the victims of the Culling has been restored to life. Raven plays a crucial role by finding out Harvest's scheme to extract all the metagenes to create a massive DNA strand for his usage. This is destroyed by Raven's soul self and Harvest is finally defeated. After this event, Raven is shown living with Cassie.

==Powers and abilities==
Raven can empathically absorb the pain of injured people to ease their suffering, and induce rapid healing. She has the ability to heal herself and others. This power is limited, since she cannot heal grave injuries. She almost died trying to accomplish such a feat. Her most prominent ability is to manifest her soul-self through a form of [[astral projection]]. Through the use of her soul-self, Raven can project her consciousness into the mind, for therapeutic purposes. It also serves as a way to travel into other dimensions. In many instances, her soul-self has also functioned as a shield and as a method of attack, by absorbing objects and energy and regurgitating them moments later. Using her soul-self, she can convert her physical body into her soul-self and carry or [[Teleportation|teleport]] herself and others over vast distances in form of a giant black raven. Her soul-self can stay outside her body for five minutes, without risking any psychic pain.{{issue|date=October 2014}}

Raven has also displayed the ability to control, manipulate and or generate pure shadows and darkness. Raven can also manipulate energy, time, and emotions. This latter ability manifests in different variations, from causing supremely destructive pain, inducing tension, fear-based illusions, and stealing emotions from others. In a number of instances, Raven has also displayed sorcerous abilities, such as inducing unconsciousness on Tim Drake with a touch, releasing balls of fire "within the folds of her cloak" (as in ''The New Teen Titans Annual'' #4 (1988)), or hurling electric blasts strong enough to take down all her brothers and all of the adult Titans. Recently, she was seen to completely annihilate the demon army of Rankor numbering more than three thousand individuals and which contained powerful individual demons that had taken the Titans down in ambushes previously. In her third body, Raven has acquired the ability to fly. Raven is shown to be able to fly unaided in space.{{issue|date=October 2014}}

Raven has very powerful telepathic and telekinetic abilities which are fueled by her emotions. She tries to keep her emotions contained because of their destructive potential. Raven has shown in a number of instances that exercising her emotions increases her power dramatically, which also tends to cause her to assume a semi-demonic form.{{issue|date=October 2014}}

Like her brothers, Raven can induce and amplify one of the [[seven deadly sins]] (in her case, pride) in any living being, however doing so will cause her to suffer spells of [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]] for several days afterward as side effects.{{issue|date=October 2014}}

Raven also has limited precognition, which allows her to predict future events that are about to happen, although this happens involuntarily and infrequently. She has also been shown to be an excellent hand-to-hand combatant, despite the fact that she rarely uses these abilities.{{issue|date=October 2014}}

As the heroes of DC, animated as they are, realize they are being used by Chimera and cease fighting and revert to a more cautious approach to the world around them, Chimera decides to dream up villains such as Doomsday to continue with his wishes before resorting to hatching a Sun-Eater inside the moon. While most of the heroes capable travel to the moon to prevent the Sun-Eater destroying it, Raven along with the Midnighter, independently of each other, deducts where Chimera was hiding through Edgar Allan Poe's Purloined Letter, both deducting that Chimera was hiding in plain sight.

==In other media==

===Television===
[[File:Raven's Meditation.jpg|thumb|Raven in the ''Teen Titans'' animated series. While the dark colored outfit shown here is considered to be her standard attire, she has on rare occasions been shown to wear an outfit of identical design but in an all white color scheme.]]
*A teenage version of Raven appears in the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Tara Strong]]. One of the program's [[breakout character]]s, and was so popular that her later portrayals in comics made attempts to be closer to this version of her. Her costume is relatively the same as her comic counterpart but her blue dress is replaced with a blue, hooded cloak and a black [[leotard]] in order to avoid several animation complications. Raven is depicted with light gray skin, violet-blue eyes, and shoulder-length violet-blue, a-line-styled hair. Her origin as the daughter of human Arella and interdimensional demon Trigon is the same as in the comics. This version chiefly employs powers which resemble telekinesis/[[psychokinesis]] encased in dark-colored mystical energy. Raven's power is displayed under various forms. She accomplishes this by putting a little piece of her spirit/soul into everything she telekinetically controls. She often chants the incantation "Azarath Metrion Zinthos" to focus her abilities even further, allowing her to perform much greater feats; she also uses this phrase as a [[mantra]] while [[meditating]]. She has the ability to fly. Raven has also been seen as a fairly good hand-to-hand combatant, although she only occasionally uses this skill during battle. Another of Raven's chief abilities is her "Soul-Self" which allows her to detach her soul and spirit from her body in the form of a dark-energy raven. This ability can be used to enter the minds of others, [[Teleportation|teleport]] herself and others across great distances, pass through solid matter or through fire, and even alter her own appearance. Raven has displayed a number of seldom-used abilities. She can heal herself and others (to an extent), stop time, and manifest her fears as monsters unintentionally. She keeps a library of numerous spellbooks in her room on the [[occult]], as well as a number of immensely powerful items, charms and talismans. <br>Raven's powers are entirely tied to her emotions, becoming more powerful and more unstable with the intensity of the emotions fueling them. Raven is often giving sage advice to the others about various subjects, and generally stays calm even in desperate situations. She is also the most emotionally restrained of the Titans, appearing secretive and distant. The reason for her emotional restraint is due to the adverse effects her emotions have on her supernatural abilities. However, she eventually warms up to her teammates and comes to see them as her family. The fourth season serves as an adaptation of the "Terror of Trigon" arc in the ''Teen Titans'' comics, and has five episodes that focus heavily on Raven. Over the course of the season, Raven tries to avoid her destiny of becoming the portal that will release Trigon into their dimension. However, with [[Deathstroke|Slade]] having been empowered by Trigon, Raven loses hope and resigns to her fate. She leaves her teammates with a small fraction of her powers to protect them from Trigon's petrification blast when he emerges. Raven [[regression (psychology)|regresses]] into a small five-year-old child, and is rescued from the depths of Trigon's prison by Robin. Robin and the other Titans decide to fight anyway, though they are ultimately incapable of defeating Trigon. Their efforts convince Raven to step out of her father's shadow, and she vaporizes Trigon with a pure-white version of her Soul-Self, returning the world to normal in the process. In the fifth season of the show, she starts to become more open and friendly, although her disposition to Beast Boy does not change. However it is also clearly shown through the entire series that Raven shares an odd "love/hate" relationship with teammate Beast Boy, as they are always fighting despite caring a lot for each other, although, unlike in the comics, a romantic interest between the two is never implied.

*Raven returns in the ''[[DC Nation Shorts|New Teen Titans]]'' shorts, with Tara Strong reprising her role. In one short, she goes on a date with the Goth Boy.

In "Legendary Sandwich", it is revealed that she loves the show ''Pretty Pretty Pegasus'' (a parody of ''[[My Little Pony]]'', for which Strong voices ''[[Twilight Sparkle]]'') but is afraid of any other girly thing (flowers, hearts, chocolates, and rabbits).
