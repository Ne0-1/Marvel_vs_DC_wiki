'''Jarella''' is a [[fictional character]] from [[Marvel Comics]]. Along with [[Betty Ross Banner]] and [[Caiera]], she was one of the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk's]] great loves. The character was introduced in ''The Incredible Hulk'' #140. Jarella was created by legendary [[science fiction]] author [[Harlan Ellison]] who was the guest writer for that issue.

==Fictional character biography==
Jarella was the princess of the [[List of Marvel Comics dimensions|sub-atomic world]] of [[K'ai]]. Although outwardly primitive, her world had remnants of long-forgotten high technology and [[Magic (fantasy)|sorcery]]. Its people were green-skinned and for the most part blonde haired, but otherwise humanoid.

Jarella's city was threatened by a number of menaces ranging from attacks by the gigantic warthos ([[warthog]]-like beasts larger than elephants) to the armies of the [[Warlord]] Visus. The Hulk appeared in K'ai during an attack of the warthos and drove the huge monsters away. When the people came out to greet him, the Hulk was startled, noticing that they were green-skinned like him and that they welcomed him rather than ran away.

The Hulk was especially taken with the lovely and gentle Empress Jarella. She led him into the city and called on her sorcerers to help the Hulk learn their language. The spell succeeded and also allows the human personality of Bruce Banner to emerge in the Hulk's body. The Hulk and Jarella fell in love and she proclaimed him her husband. After Visus attempted to assassinate Jarella she exiled him from the city, and the Hulk and Jarella seem destined to live [[happy ending|happily ever after]]. However destiny in the form of a [[supervillain]] named [[Psyklop]] interfered, and snatched the Hulk away from K'ai.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 2 #140 (June 1971)</ref>

Jarella was soon transported to Earth by the Pantheon of Sorcerers (Torla, Holi, Moli; also known as the Sorcerer's Triad) to retrieve the Hulk. This act inadvertently caused solar storms; she battled Fialin and then returned to K'ai.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 2 #148 (February 1972)</ref> After a while, she was revealed to have lost another war against Visi and been taken captive. The Hulk returned to K'ai, and Jarella and Hulk defeated Visis and the assassin Krylar.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 2 #156-157 (October - November 1972)</ref>

Jarella was unique in the series in that she accepted the Hulk unconditionally. She came to know Bruce Banner's mind in the Hulk's body but was equally accepting of the Hulk personality, or Banner's body.

Alongside the Hulk, Jarella battled Psyklop once more. Hulk and Jarella were then returned to Earth by [[Doc Samson]].<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 2 #202-203 (August - September 1976)</ref> During a battle between the Hulk and Crypto-Man in an unnamed town in New Mexico, Jarella saved a child from being crushed to death from a collapsing wall, but was crushed to death herself.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 2 #205 (November 1976)</ref> The Hulk took Jarella's body to the Gamma Base, but the doctors were unable to revive her.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 2 #240</ref> The Hulk rampaged in search for his friend, the magician [[Doctor Strange]], but the latter was also unable to restore her, and he finally accepted that Jarella was dead, while being comforted by the [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]]. [[Mar-Vell|Captain Mar-Vell]] shrank the Hulk so that he could return Jarella's body to K'ai for a proper burial. After being put to rest her spirit took farewell by creating a single green flower.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 2 #246-248 (April - June 1980)</ref>

Many years afterwards, during a [[Fantastic Four]] storyline featuring a delirious Hulk rampaging through [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], the latter howled Jarella's name, as one of the 3 greatest tragedies that he considered to have befallen him, along with the poisoning of his wife [[Betty Ross]], and the death of his friend [[Jim Wilson (comics)|Jim Wilson]] due to AIDS.

Due to a bet made by the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]] and the [[Collector (comics)|Collector]], the Hulk, [[Doctor Strange]], [[Namor]], and [[Silver Surfer]] unite from across time and space to confront the newly assembled team of the Offenders, led by the brutal [[Red Hulk]]. The Grandmaster promises to restore Jarella if the Hulk agrees to battle.<ref>''Hulk'' Vol. 2 #10 (2009)</ref> The Red Hulk was victorious, but his brutal and careless tactics led the Grandmaster to  disqualify him. In a rage, the Red Hulk killed the Grandmaster, but was then defeated by the Hulk. The Collector, furious over his brother's death, gave the Hulk Jarella's dead body, stating that she was meant to be in that state.<ref>''Hulk'' Vol. 2 #12 (2009)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Jarella was an athletic woman with the strength of a normal human but was a skilled swordswoman, strategist and equestrian. She would ride horse-like steeds and winged serpent-creatures indigenous to K'ai.
