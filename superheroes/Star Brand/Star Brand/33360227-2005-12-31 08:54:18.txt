'''''The Star Brand''''' is a [[fictional]] star-shaped [[tattoo]] that first appeared in the [[New Universe]] line of [[comics]] published by [[Marvel Comics]] in the 1980's. The Star Brand gives its wielder god-like powers which are limited only by the wielder's imagination. The most easily attainable of these powers are flight, invulnerability, and the ability to project blasts of destructive energy.  In addition, the brand makes the user immortal, regenerating the body upon any event that would normally cause the user's death. The owner of the brand can transfer it to another person, but former owners are always left with a residue of its power. The Star Brand's power also has a mutagenic aspect. Those who wield it for many years will find themselves growing taller and more massive.

==New Universe series==
===Before the series===
The defining event of the New Universe, the White Event, was a result of one user's attempt to place the Star Brand on an inanimate object (an [[asteroid]]) in order to rid himself of the power. The brand, unchecked by a higher intelligence, released a huge amount of energy in a single blast. This energy bombarded Earth, mutating a portion of the population and endowing them various paranormal traits or abilities. This phenomenon set the stage for the New Universe titles.

===The Series===
The Star Brand series was published by Marvel Comics and ran from 1986 to 1989, with a total of nineteen issues and one [[Annual publication|annual]]. The series was originally conceived and written by [[Jim Shooter]] and drawn by [[John Romita Jr]], but went through several writers and artists during its run. Like many of the titles set in the New Universe, it attempted to realistically examine what would happen if average people suddenly became [[superhuman]].

===Wielders===
There were three men who wielded the power of the Star Brand during the course of the original run:

*'''Ken Connel''' is the main character through most of the series. He is a car mechanic from [[Pittsburgh]] who receives the Star Brand from a mysterious old man he meets in the woods while [[dirt bike|dirtbiking]]. Ken tries to use his powers to help others, even donning a superhero costume and thwarting [[terrorist]]s on several occasions. Though intelligent, he is self-involved and lacks the imagination and curiosity that would allow him to understand and wield the brand to its fullest potential. He eventually decides that he would be better off without his powers, and unintentionally causes the destruction of all of [[Pittsburgh]] (the Black Event) by attempting to place the brand on a barbell.

*'''The Old Man''' is first known wielder of the brand. After his failure to get rid of the Star Brand by placing it on an asteroid, he returns to Earth and gives the brand to the first person he encounters, Ken Connel. Later regretting this decision, he attempts to trick Connel into giving the brand back to him, and failing that, resorts to terrorizing Connel on numerous occasions. After being defeated by Connel several times, he is revealed to be an older version of Connel himself who had been placed 500 years in the past by the Star Child.

*'''The Star Child''' is Ken Connel and Debbie Fix's son. He is born fully conscious of the Star Brand's power, which he has inherited from his father. He is more well-intentioned than his father, but does not at first understand the ways of the world. After a few mistakes, he realizes that no good can come of the Star Brand's existence and formulates a plan to seal its power away forever.

===Comparisons with Green Lantern===
The bigest criticism of Star Brand was the similarity between the Star Brand and the [[Green Lantern Ring]]. The flip side of this argument is to point out that while the concepts are similar, there are more differances than similarities, and that [[Hal Jordan]] and Ken Connel couldn't be more different as characters.

==Reintroduction==
Following the dissolution of the New Universe imprint, [[Mark Gruenwald]] (writer of the New Universe title [[DP7 (comics)|DP7]]) still had a great liking of the New Universe. Some years later, when Gruenwald was the writer for [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]], he decided to use the New Universe   again and have them interact with characters from the mainstream Marvel Universe. The Star Brand featured prominently in this storyline. Subsequently, he used them in the little-known [[Starblast]] [[crossover]]. Starblast ended when [[Stranger (comics)|The Stranger]]  used the Starbrand to move the Earth of the New Universe into orbit around his [[Stranger's Labworld|labworld]].

===Wielders===
During this period there were four individuals who wielded the Star Brand:

*'''Jim''' (his last name was unrevealed) was a [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]] [[Aviator|pilot]] who lost control of his jet and crashed. When he awoke on the ground the only mark on him was a strange tattoo that he would later find out to be the Star Brand. In the next few weeks his powers manifested and he had a [[Dream|reccuring dream]] in which the Star Child saved him during his crash and gave the Star Brand to him. Jim kept his abilities a secret and never used them. When Quasar sought him out, he gladly gave the Star Brand away.

*'''Quasar''' brought the Star Brand with him back to the Marvel Universe after he was accidentally thrown into the New Universe. The New Univere was located in a completely different [[multiverse]] and the Star Brand was the only object in the New Universe capable of getting Quasar home. Once back he accidentally passed it on to his [[secretary]] Kayla Ballentine.

*'''Kayla Ballentine''' was Quasar's secretary at the time she received the Star Brand. Once her powers began to manifest, she became the target of numerous alien individuals and groups. These include the [[The Dance (comics)|Dance]], the [[Chief Examiner]], and a group of interplanetery mauraders known as the [[Starblast|Starblasters]]. Kayla would eventually pass the Star Brand onto [[Stranger (comics)|The Stranger]] in order to prevent Skeletron (the leader of the Starblasters) from forcebly taking the Star Brand. After the threat posed by the Starblasters was over the Star Brand was returned to Kayla. She remained on the New Universe Earth after it was moved into the marvel universe and cut of from the rest of that universe.

*'''The Stranger''''s first action after taking possession of the Star Brand was to move the Earth of the New Universe into the Marvel Universe and place it in orbit around his labworld. His intention was to use it for his experiments. This was prevented when the [[Living Tribunal]] arrived and judged the Star Brand to be a threat to the hierarchy of the cosmic powers of the Marvel Universe. A barrier was placed around the New Universe Earth in order to [[quarantine]] it from the rest of the universe.

==Exiles==
Alternate versions of Ken Connel and the Star Brand appeared in the pages of the [[Exiles (comics)|Exiles]] during that series' "Worlds Tour" story-arc.

In that story The Exiles join forces with that universe's versions of [[DP7 (comics)|D.P.7]] and Ken Connel to prevent an alternate version of [[Proteus (comics)|Proteus]] from taking control of Connel's body and the Star Brand itself.
