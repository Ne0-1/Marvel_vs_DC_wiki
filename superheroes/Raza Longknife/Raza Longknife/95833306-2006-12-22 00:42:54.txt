'''Raza Longknife''' is a member of the [[Marvel Comics]] [[X-Men]] series and a member of the Starjammers.

While imprisoned on [[Alisbar]], he met and formed the [[Starjammers]]; with [[Corsair]], [[Hepzibah]] and [[Ch'od]], and associated himself with the group. He is a cyborg being, half man and half machine. Raza speaks in an archaic form of old English, which can be both an annoyance and a source of amusement to his allies.
