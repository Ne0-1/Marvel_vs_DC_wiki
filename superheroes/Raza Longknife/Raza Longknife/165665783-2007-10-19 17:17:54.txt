'''Raza Longknife''' is a character from [[Marvel Comics]], usually seen in the [[X-Men]] series and various spin-offs.  He is the last known surviving member of his unnamed alien race (which chose to die en masse in one final battle against the Shi'ar empire as the culmination of their warrior culture), and a member of the [[Starjammers]].

==Fictional character biography==
While imprisoned on [[Alisbar]], he met and formed the [[Starjammers]]; with [[Corsair]], [[Hepzibah (comics)|Hepzibah]] and [[Ch'od]], and associated himself with the group. He is a cyborg being: partly living flesh and partly machine. Raza speaks in an archaic form of old English, which can be both an annoyance and a source of amusement to his allies.


Raza has recently suffered the death of his loyal friend Corsair and less tragically, Hepzibah's stranding on Earth. Several X-Men have remained with the Starjammers.


The Starjammers are now: Havok, Polaris, Ch'od, Marvel Girl, Raza, Korvus and Cr+eee.

The further adventures of the Starjammers will continue in the upcoming series: X-Men: Emperor Vulcan, this mini series (5 issues) will be written by Chris Yost and pencilled by Paco Diaz.

==Powers and abilities==
Raza has superhuman strength, enhanced agility, speed, and reflexes thanks to his robotic parts. He is skilled hand-to-hand combatant.

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
*Raza appears as a member of the [[Starjammers]], this time captained by [[Deathbird]].  He seems to have the same history as his mainstream counterpart.
