'''Red Hulk''', referred to as '''Rulk''' in comic [[narration]],  is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appeared in ''Hulk'' vol. 2, #1 (Jan. 2008) and was created by writer [[Jeph Loeb]] and artist [[Ed McGuiness]]. 

The character of Red Hulk has also been featured in [[video games]] and toy [[merchandise]].

==Publication history==
The character was introduced in 2008 in ''Hulk'' #1,<ref>Jeph Loeb. ''Hulk'' vol. 2, #1 (Jan. 2008)</ref> and has ties to the original Marvel character the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], as the Red Hulk is created as part of a [[Super Soldier]] program by long-time members of the Hulk's supporting cast: [[General]] [[Thunderbolt Ross]] and [[psychiatrist]] [[Doc Samson]].<ref>Jeph Loeb. ''Hulk'' #1 - 6 (Apr. - Nov. 2008)</ref> The [[A.I.M.]] creation [[MODOK]], an old Hulk foe<ref>[[Steve Englehart]]. ''Incredible Hulk'' #168 (Oct. 1973)</ref> is also involved,<ref name=Incredible600>Jeph Loeb. ''Incredible Hulk'' #600 (Sept. 2009)</ref> as is a criminal [[think tank]] called "The Intelligentsia".<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/080929-Fan-Expo-Hulks.html Smith, Zack. "FEC 09: PARKER, PELLETIER SMASH Into WORLD WAR HULKS" Newsarama. August 29, 2009]</ref> The character is described as "absolutely uninhibited, tactically intelligent"<ref name="George"/> and "Everything the Green Hulk isn't, the Red Hulk is."<ref name="USA"/> Although possessing all the abilities of the original green Hulk, the Red Hulk does not grow stronger with anger - instead emitting increasing levels of heat.

According to the [[newspaper]] ''[[USA Today]]'', the Red Hulk was created to boost sales and create buzz in the lead up to the 2008 film ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]''.<ref name="USA"/> Loeb and McGuinness were initially working on a Hulk miniseries (as according to Loeb, "[McGuinness] came over from [[DC Comics|DC]] for one reason, and that's he wanted to draw the Hulk.") that would establish the Hulk as the strongest Marvel character. It was then that Joe Quesada proposed the idea for a red version of the Hulk with a secret identity.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/comic-riffs/2008/09/interview_with_the_cartoonist.html|title=The Interview: 'Hulk' Writer Jeph Loeb|last=Cavna|first=Michael|date=September 3, 2008|work=[[Washington Post]]|accessdate=2009-03-04}}</ref> The identity of the Red Hulk is a mystery, both to the characters in the story<ref name=RedSheHulk>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=22202 Kiel Phegley. "CCI: Introducing... Red She-Hulk" Comic Book Resources; July 24, 2009]</ref> and to the reading audience.<ref>[http://marvel.com/news/comicstories.8413.Who_is_the_Red_Hulk%3F Marc Strom. "Who is the Red Hulk?" Marvel.com June 17, 2009]</ref>

Once the series was promoted, Marvel's insert booklets in [[Diamond Comic Distributors|Diamond ''Previews'']] began referring to the Red Hulk character as "'''Rulk'''" to distinguish from the original Hulk character. Writer Loeb began using the term as of issue seven.<ref name="CBR1"/> 

The title ''Hulk'' establishes that the character is very aggressive, as the Red Hulk murders Hulk foes the [[Wendigo (comics)|Wendigo]] and [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]]; destroys the [[Helicarrier]] of spy organization [[S.H.I.E.L.D]]; defeats several Marvel heroes, and, after  causing an [[earthquake]] in [[San Francisco]], is finally defeated by the combined efforts of the Hulk and the thunder god [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. 

A 2008 [[one-shot]] publication titled ''King-Size Hulk''<ref>Jeph Loeb. ''King-Size Hulk'' (June 2008)</ref> featured the Red Hulk, and was written by Loeb, with artwork by [[Frank Cho]], [[Art Adams]], and [[Herb Trimpe]].

Issues seven through nine of the title were "split books", featuring two stories by Loeb, with Adams providing artwork for the first and Cho the second. The Red Hulk battles the female superhero team the [[Lady Liberators]] and, after tricking them, kidnaps member [[Thundra]], and offers her an alliance.<ref>Jeph Loeb. ''Hulk'' vol. 2, #7 - 9 (Dec. 2008 - Feb. 2009)</ref> The [[Elder of the Universe]] the [[Collector (comics)|Collector]] teams the character with other villains (a team called the Offenders - an evil version of superhero team the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]) in a bid to prevent the original Hulk from reuniting with past love [[Jarella]].<ref>Jeph Loeb. ''Hulk'' vol. 2, #10 - 12 (Apr. - June 2009)</ref>

In the "Code Red" story arc,<ref name=RedSheHulk/> mutant [[assassin]] [[Domino (comics)|Domino]] investigates Rulk, observing him transforming from his human self. In response, Rulk pursues Domino with the help of [[Deadpool]], [[Punisher]], [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]], and [[Crimson Dynamo]] XII, but comes into conflict with [[X-Force]], a [[Red She-Hulk]] and [[Doc Samson]].<ref>Loeb, Jeph. ''Hulk'' vol. 2 #14-16 (October - December 2009)</ref>

In ''Fall of the Hulks: Alpha'', it is revealed that MODOK was a part of a loose-knit cabal of scientists that included the [[Leader (comics)|The Leader]], [[Doctor Doom]], [[Mad Thinker]], [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]], [[Egghead (comics)|Egghead]], and the [[Red Ghost]], which gathered the knowledge that MODOK eventually used to create the Red Hulk.<ref>''Fall of the Hulks: Alpha''</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Marvel editor Mark Paniccia has described the Red Hulk as "absolutely uninhibited, tactically intelligent",<ref name="George">{{cite web |last=George |first=Richard |coauthors=Schedeen, Jesse |title=The Future of the Hulk: Marvel reveals new details about the current and future status of the Hulk line |url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/877/877905p1.html |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=May 30, 2008 |accessdate= }}</ref> while writer Jeph Loeb states "The Red Hulk is the kind of [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] we haven't seen before — a thinking, calculating, brutal weapon-toting kind of Hulk."

The Red Hulk, however, does not become stronger with anger, but rather emits increasing levels of heat.<ref name=Hulkv2#6>Jeph Loeb. ''Hulk'' vol. 2, #6 (Nov. 2008)</ref> The character can also emit heat at will from his eyes during non-enraged periods, and can augment power levels by absorbing various types of energy, such as [[gamma radiation]] (in one instance causing the Hulk to revert to [[alter ego]] [[Bruce Banner]])<ref name=Incredible600/> and the [[Power Cosmic]].<ref>Jeph Loeb. ''Hulk'' vol. 2, #12 (July 2009)</ref> Unlike the green Hulk, the Red Hulk does not revert to human form when rendered unconscious, and his [[blood]] is [[yellow]] instead of green.<ref name=Hulkv2#6/>

==Reception==
Comics featuring the Red Hulk have sold well, but received mixed reviews. The first five issues of the ''Hulk'' title sold out, and second printings featured new covers.<ref name="CBR1">{{cite news |last=CBR News Team |first= | title = "Hulk" #5 is  - second printing announced | url = http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=17678 | publisher = [[Comic Book Resources]] | date = August 12, 2008 | accessdate = 2008-08-28}}</ref> Issue #6 was the second best-selling title of September 2008,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/13519.html |title=Top 300 Comics Actual--September 2008 |publisher=ICv2.com}}</ref> and issue #10 was sixth in February 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/14518.html|title=Top 300 Comics Actual--February 2009|date=March 17, 2009|publisher=ICv2|accessdate=2009-03-19}}</ref>

Augie De Blieck. Jr., of [[Comic Book Resources]] gave the first six issues a positive review, describing it as a "silly fun action romp" and a "popcorn comic".  De Blieck liked Loeb's lack of subtlety when giving out clues, saying "this is a book where anytime someone is about reveal the solution to the big mystery, they get knocked out by a slap in the face from the Red Hulk or a machine gun to the gut". His one criticism was that, although he liked the artwork, he would have preferred [[Dale Keown]] as the artist.<ref name="Augie">{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=19411|title=Pipeline|last=De Blieck Jr.|first=Augie |date=January 6, 2009|publisher=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=2009-03-04}}</ref>

[[IGN]] reviewer Jesse Schedeen was generally critical of the series, citing a lack of character development and the emphasis on continuous action sequences over the ongoing question of Red Hulk's identity.<ref name="IGNR4">{{cite news |last= Schedeen |first= Jesse| title = Hulk #4 Review, Who is the hulkiest Hulk of them all? | url = http://comics.ign.com/articles/884/884159p1.html | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = May 25, 2008 | accessdate = 2008-08-28 | quote =Each issue provides about 30 seconds of plot development, which usually centers around heaping more layers of mystery atop the Red Hulk's identity. The rest involves smashing, being smashed, or a bit of both.}}</ref> Schedeen  also derided the treatment of other mainstream Marvel characters within the pages of ''Hulk'', saying about issue #5 "The series has already treated She-Hulk and Iron Man like ragdolls who crumple under the awesome might of Red Hulk. Now it's Thor's turn".<ref name="IGNR5">{{cite news |last= Schedeen |first= Jesse| title = Hulk #5 Review, It's hammer time for Red Hulk. | url = http://comics.ign.com/articles/896/896771p1.html | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = August 6, 2008 | accessdate = 2008-08-28}}</ref> Claiming bad dialogue, poor pacing and maltreated characters, the review claims Ed McGuinness' artwork has been the only saving grace for the title.<ref name="IGNR4"/><ref name="IGNR5"/> In an interview with Loeb, Z. Julian Cenac of ComixFan.com noted that some readers were upset that the Red Hulk was able to thrash other powerful Marvel characters, and were concerned that such a high power-level wouldn't be sustainable. Loeb replied, "I tell the best stories I can."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comixfan.com/xfan/forums/showthread.php?t=46252|title=An Ultimatum of an Interview with Jeph Loeb|last=Cenac|first=Z.
