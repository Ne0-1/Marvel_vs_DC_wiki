==Fictional character biography==
Crossing the [[Canada|Canadian]] wilderness, the Red Hulk encounters, and kills a [[Wendigo (comics)|Wendigo]]<ref name="KSH">''King-Size Hulk'' #1 (June 2008)</ref> before reaching Russia, where he murders [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]].<ref>[[Jeph Loeb]]. ''Hulk'' #1 (March 2008)</ref> Red Hulk is next seen in [[New York]], where he attacks [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Director [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]], [[She-Hulk]] and others investigating Abomination's death.  At some point during the attack Red Hulk manages to erase all files on the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], using a sophisticated [[computer virus]] before destroying Stark's newly commissioned [[Helicarrier]].<ref name="H2">''Hulk'' #2 (April 2008)</ref>

S.H.I.E.L.D. agent [[Clay Quartermain]] is allegedly killed in the attack, as what appears to be his body is discovered in the ruin. After this, Red Hulk travels to Gamma Base in [[Death Valley]], squaring off against [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] (in his A-Bomb persona) before facing [[android]] [[Betty Ross|Harpies]] and even defeating the original [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]].<ref name="H3">''Hulk'' #3 (May 2008)</ref> [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] interrupts the confrontation between the two Hulks.<ref name="H4">''Hulk'' #4 (June 2008)</ref>

After defeating Thor in the weightlessness of space (which allowed Red Hulk to hold Thor's Hammer), Red Hulk returns to Earth and goes on to cause an earthquake in San Francisco which was dealt with by the Hulk, She-Hulk, A-Bomb, the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and the [[Fantastic Four]].<ref name="H5">''Hulk'' #5 (August 2008)</ref> Hulk and the returning Thor face and defeat Red Hulk as the others save the city.  After his defeat, Red Hulk is visited by [[Doc Samson]] and General [[Thunderbolt Ross]], who say they gave Red Hulk his power to defeat Hulk and now that he has failed, they are cutting him loose.<ref name="H6">''Hulk'' #6 (September 2008)</ref>

She-Hulk later gathers [[Thundra]] and [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]] as the [[Lady Liberators (comics)|Lady Liberators]] in an effort to apprehend the Red Hulk near [[Mount Rushmore]], accidentally destroying the sculpture of Lincoln's face.<ref name="H7">''Hulk'' #7 (October 2008)</ref>

==Characterization==
Red Hulk's identity has yet to be revealed within the comic series, but in an interview Marvel Editor in Chief [[Joe Quesada]] jokingly suggested it was [[Ares_(Marvel_Comics)|Ares]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Red Hulk’s Secret Identity Revealed! |url=http://www.comicnerd.com/marvel-comics/the-red-hulks-secret-identity-revealed/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=My Cup o' Joe: Week 7 |url=http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.3507.MyCup_o~apos~_Joe_Week_7 |publisher=Marvel Comics |date=2008-05-06 |accessdate=2008-07-18}}</ref> However, issue five of the ''Hulk'' series contradicts this as Ares is seen on a team heading after Red Hulk.<ref name="H5" />

Marvel editor Mark Paniccia has described Red Hulk as "absolutely uninhibited, tactically intelligent",<ref>{{cite web |last=George |first=Richard |coauthors=Schedeen, Jesse |title=The Future of the Hulk: Marvel reveals new details about the current and future status of the Hulk line |url=http://uk.comics.ign.com/articles/877/877905p1.html |date=2008-05-30 |accessdate= }}</ref> while writer Jeph Loeb states "The Red Hulk is the kind of Hulk we haven't seen before — a thinking, calculating, brutal weapon-toting kind of Hulk." To further distance the character away from the original. "Everything the Green Hulk isn't, the Red Hulk is."<ref>{{cite news |last=Colton |first=David | title = The reliably green Incredible Hulk gets pulled into a crimson tide for '#2' | url = http://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2008-02-17-incredible-hulk_N.htm | publisher = [[USA TODAY]] | date = [[2008-02-17]] | accessdate = 2008-06-12}}</ref>

==Powers and equipment==
Red Hulk has powers almost identical to those of the [[Powers and abilities of the Hulk|original Hulk]], including vast superhuman strength, stamina, and healing ability, as well as considerable durability. However, unlike Hulk, the Red Hulk does not grow stronger with rage, but rather gives off increasing levels of [[gamma radiation]],<ref name="H2"/> hence the statement, "the madder this Hulk gets, the hotter he gets".<ref name="KSH"/> However, over-aggravation can cause Red Hulk to get dizzy from the radiation and heat that is generated.<ref name="H6"/> He has not reverted to human form when rendered unconscious.<ref name="H6"/>

He has been known to use firearms, notably an experimental [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] issue [[handgun]] [[Ergonomics|ergonomically]] designed for giant hands, taken from the armory of the Helicarrier.<ref name="H2"/> Additionally, Red Hulk has used a knife to behead a [[Wendigo (comics)|Wendigo]].<ref>''King-Size Hulk'' #1</ref> The Red Hulk also displays a formidable knowledge of hand-to-hand combat, which when combined with his intimate knowledge of the foes he has faced thus far, has allowed him to summarily defeat Iron Man (in Hulkbuster Armor), She-Hulk, Thor, and tie with the "savage" incarnation of the Hulk. Although the last two were later shown as capable of defeating him in single combat, with the previous defeats attributed to lack of experience with their opponent.<ref name="H6"/>

==Reception==
The first five issues of the ''Hulk'' title sold out and had second printings with covers featuring interior art from Ed McGuiness.<ref name="CBR1">{{cite news |last=CBR News Team |first= | title = "Hulk" #5 is red hot - second printing announced | url = http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=17678 | publisher = [[Comic Book Resources]] | date = [[2008-08-12]] | accessdate = 2008-08-28}}</ref> Issue #6 was the second best-selling title of September 2008.<ref>[http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/13519.html "Top 300 Comics Actual--September 2008" icv2.com]</ref> However, an IGN review of the series was critical of the lack of character development, citing the emphasis on continuous action sequences over the ongoing question of Red Hulk's identity.<ref name="IGNR4">{{cite news |last= Schedeen |first= Jesse| title = Hulk #4 Review, Who is the hulkiest Hulk of them all? | url = http://uk.comics.ign.com/articles/884/884159p1.html | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = [[2008-06-25]] | accessdate = 2008-08-28 | quote =Each issue provides about 30 seconds of plot development, which usually centers around heaping more layers of mystery atop the Red Hulk's identity. The rest involves smashing, being smashed, or a bit of both.}}</ref> This reviewer later also derided the treatment of other mainstream Marvel characters within the pages of Hulk "The series has already treated She-Hulk and Iron Man like ragdolls who crumple under the awesome might of Red Hulk. Now it's Thor's turn."<ref name="IGNR5">{{cite news |last= Schedeen |first= Jesse| title = Hulk #5 Review, It's hammer time for Red Hulk. | url = http://uk.comics.ign.com/articles/896/896771p1.html | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = [[2008-08-06]] | accessdate = 2008-08-28}}</ref> Claiming bad dialogue, poor pacing and maltreated characters, Schedeen feels that Ed McGuiness' artwork has been the only saving grace for the title.<ref name="IGNR4"/><ref name="IGNR5"/>

Marvel's insert booklets in [[Diamond Comic Distributors|Diamond Previews]] began referring to the Red Hulk character as "'''Rulk'''" (a [[Portmanteau word|portmanteau]] of '''R'''ed H'''ulk'''), to distinguish him from the original Hulk character, a term character creator Jeph Loeb has used as well in issue #7.<ref name="CBR1"/>
