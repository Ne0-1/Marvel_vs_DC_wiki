==Fictional character biography==
Miguel Santos was born in [[East Los Angeles, California]]. Miguel's father, Carlos, was a member of an extremist group called '''the Legion of the Living Lightning'''.

The Legion was thus destroyed, and Carlos was killed.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #97-99</ref>

Hoping to salvage his father's name, high school student Miguel broke into the Legion's headquarters to learn more about their work.

During his tenure in the West Coast Avengers, Miguel dated women.  Later, though, Miguel was approached by members of the [[Great Lakes Avengers]], who hoped to recruit them for their team.  When he heard the teams acronym (GLA), Miguel mistook them for the Gay/Lesbian Alliance and inadvertently revealed to GLA member [[Flatman (comics)|Flatman]] that he was gay.

Writer Dan Slott commented in an interview about his decision to out Living Lightning:
"He's gay. Get over it. Previous girlfriends? [[Beard (female companion)|Beards]]. Or relationships that just didn't work - because Miguel hadn't come to terms yet with who he really is. Miguel is a gay superhero and a wonderful role model."<ref>[http://www.gayleague.com/gay/characters/display.php?id=179 Gay League - Living Lightning<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Living Lightning gained superhuman powers when he absorbed energy from an experimental lightning weapon. Living Lightning has the ability to transform his body into electrical plasma, in which form he can fly at sub-light speed, generate electrical power as shocks or bolts, and surround himself with a protective electrical force field. He has the ability to control his body while composed of electrical plasma, at which time his mind exists only in astral form.

In his true form, Living Lightning is just that, a sentient electrical force with no mass.  In this form, he can fly, reaching sub-light speeds, withstanding the vacuum of space, and is impervious to most physical and energy attacks.  He also possesses the ability to fire and manipulate bursts of electricity and electrical fields of varying intensities in his solid form, however, he must wear a special containment suit to retain a solid form.

Miguel has knowledge of basic street-fighting techniques. He is bilingual in Spanish and English.
