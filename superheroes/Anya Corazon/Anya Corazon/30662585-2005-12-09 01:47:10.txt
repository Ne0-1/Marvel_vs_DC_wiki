'''Araña''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[Marvel Universe]]. She was the star of the resurrected ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' [[comic book]] in [[2004]]. After her story-line ended with ''Amazing Fantasy'' #6, she got her own title, ''Araña: The Heart of the Spider'', starting in January [[2005]] as part of [[Marvel Next]].

Araña was created by writer [[Fiona Avery]] and artist [[Mark Brooks (comics)|Mark Brooks]] and is based on ideas [[J. Michael Straczynski]] used in his run on ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]''. The title is currently part of the [[Marvel Next]] line, a set of comic books by [[Marvel Comics]] starring young super-heroes.

== Biography ==

Araña's real name is '''Anya Corazon''', a teenager from [[Brooklyn]], [[New York]], where she lives with her father, Gil Corazon, an investigative reporter. She was recruited by a mystical clan called [[The Spider Society]] to become their Hunter and fight to preserve world peace. To that end, the Society has gifted Anya with spider-like physical abilities, similar to those of [[Spider-Man]].

As a cover for her activities, she works as an [[intern]] for WebCorps, the Spider Society's commercial front that was set up by a mysterious businessman known as [[Ezekiel (Spider-Man)|Ezekiel Sims]]. Her heroic endeavors are supported by WebCorps, who recruited Anya to become Araña. Her main adversaries are the [[Sisterhood of the Wasp]].

Araña eventually learned not only that her mother died as a Hunter for [[The Spider Society]], but also that Anya is the latest in part of a bloodline of Hunters that stretches back through her ancestors on her mother's side.

==Character history==
{{spoiler}}
=== [[Amazing Fantasy]] #1 - 6: Heart of The Spider  ===

On her first day at Milton Summers [[High School]] in Fort Greer, [[Brooklyn]], Anya Corazon is recruited by a mystical clan called the Spider Society to act as their agent, a Hunter. A ritual is performed on her by giving her a spider-shaped tattoo that endows her with spider-like powers. Anya lies to her father, Gil Corazon (a reporter for the ''New York Herald'' and writer of several major stories), about what has happened; she tries to convince him that she has an ordinary internship at WebCorps.  Gil interrogates Miguel concerning what sort of work he has lined up for Anya.

WebCorps offers Araña various costumes, including suits resembling those of [[Supergirl]], the [[Invisible Woman]], [[Magneto]], [[Spider-Man]], The Bride from [[Kill Bill]], [[Sailor Moon]], [[Wonder Woman]], and a giant rabbit costume. Anya, not satisfied, decides to make her own costume. She designes a costume with red and blue sneakers, blue track pants, red backpack, red gloves with many pockets, and big goggle-eyed sunglasses. A crusty exoskeleton covers most of her body with a bug-like bluish skin. In place of  equipment like web-shooters or spider tracers, Araña makes attaches cords to discs that are about the size of her palm and have eight red legs that are able to remotely grip objects.

The Sisterhood of the Wasp, adversaries of the Spider Society, also have a Hunter, who in fights Araña in the first issue.

While interrogating a spy for the Sisterhood of the Wasp, Anya and Miguel discover that the Sisterhood has recruited a fifteen-year old boy code-named Amun, a descendant of Egyptian assassins who believes he is skilled enough that he doesn't need to conceal his identity.  Soon after Anya meets Amun, who has enrolled at her school under the name Jon Kasiya.  The two soon deduce the other's dual identity.

Later, during a fight between Anya, Miguel, and the Sisterhood, Amun tells her that he will attack her loved ones if she opposes her.  Noting her father is filming the fight, Anya takes him to safety.  In her absence, Amun seriously wounds Miguel.  The encounter leaves Anya doubting her duty due to the danger it poses to her loved ones.  However, in a chance encounter, Spider-Man arrives and, after discussing her origins and adventures, tells her, "With great power comes great responsibility" and that in every age, people are called to be heroes. 

Soon afterwards, Anya fights Amun and, in anger, nearly strangles him to death.  She is stopped by Ted, who tells Amun to run. Ted tells her that she had released "the Spirit of the Hunter" and warns her not to do it again without Miguel with her.  Back at Webcorps, Miguel is revived upon being reunited with Anya, and he tellsher the history of the organization that would eventually split into Wasps and Spiders.

After an encounter with a gunman in a coffee shop, in which Anya saves Lynn and Amun without revealing her [[secret identity]], Amun promises to respect her double life and to stop targeting her friends and family.
