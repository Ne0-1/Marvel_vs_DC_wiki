==History==
'''Ara&ntilde;aa''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[Marvel Comics]] universe. She was the star of the restarted [[Amazing Fantasy]] title, but that particular comic was cancelled after six issues to make way for the retitled ''Ara&ntilde;a: The Heart of the Spider'', starting from January [[2005]]. She was created by writer [[Fiona Avery]] and artist [[Mark Brooks]]. '''Ara&ntilde;a''' is part of the [[Marvel Age]] imprint, a line of comic books developped primarily for a young audience.

== Biography ==
Ara&ntilde;a's real name is '''Anya Corazon''', a teenager hailing from [[Brooklyn]], [[New York]], where she lives with her father. She was recruited by a mystical clan called [[The Spider Society]], to become their "Hunter" and fight to preserve the peace of the world. To that end, the Society has gifted Anya with spider-like abilities similar to those of [[Spider-Man]], But not the Equipment like Web-shooters or Spider tracers.

To disguise her activities, she works as in intern for WebCorps, the Spider Society's commercial front, set up by a mysterious businessman known as Ezekiel Sims. Her heroic endeavors are supported by Ted, WebCorps' resident hacker, Nina, an aspiring executive, and Miguel, the Society's mage, who recruited Anya to become Ara&ntilde;a. Her main adversaries are the Sisterhood of the Wasp.

== Trivia ==
Originally, Ara√±a was supposed to be known as [[Spider-Girl]], but since this ongoing title managed to dodge cancellation consecutively, Marvel decided to ressurect the Amazing Fantasy brand to test the waters for a possible new series featuring Anya.
