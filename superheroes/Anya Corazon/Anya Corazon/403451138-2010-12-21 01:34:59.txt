== Fictional character biography ==
=== Heart of the Spider ===
On her first day at Milton Summers [[high school|High School]] in [[Fort Greene, Brooklyn]], Anya Corazon, who is half [[Mexican people|Mexican]] and half [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]], is recruited by a mystical clan called the Spider Society to act as their agent, a Hunter. A ritual is performed on her by giving her a spider-shaped tattoo that endows her with spider-like powers. Anya lies to her father, Gil Corazon (a reporter for the ''New York Herald'' and writer of several major stories), about what has happened; she tries to convince him that she has an ordinary internship at WebCorps. Gil interrogates Miguel concerning what sort of work he has lined up for Anya.

WebCorps offers Araña various costumes, including suits resembling those of [[Supergirl]], the [[Invisible Woman]], [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], [[Spider-Man]], [[Beatrix Kiddo|The Bride]] from ''[[Kill Bill]]'', [[Sailor Moon (character)|Sailor Moon]], [[Wonder Woman]], and a giant rabbit costume (from ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'s'' [[Anya Jenkins]]). Araña, not satisfied, decides to make her own costume. She designs a costume with red and blue sneakers, blue track pants, red backpack, red gloves with many pockets, and big goggle-eyed sunglasses. A crusty exoskeleton covers most of her body with a bug-like bluish skin. In place of equipment like web-shooters or spider tracers, Araña attaches cords to discs that are about the size of her palm and have eight red legs able to remotely grip objects.

The Sisterhood of the Wasp, adversaries of the Spider Society, also have a Hunter, who fights Araña in the first issue.

=== In the Beginning ===
While interrogating a spy for the Sisterhood of the Wasp, Anya and Miguel discover that the Sisterhood has recruited a fifteen year old boy codenamed [[Amun (comics)|Amun]], a descendant of Egyptian assassins who believes he is skilled enough that he doesn't need to conceal his identity. Anya soon meets Amun, who has enrolled at her school under the name Jon Kasiya. The two soon deduce the other's dual identity.

Later, during a fight between Anya, Miguel, and the Sisterhood, Amun tells her that he will attack her loved ones if she opposes him. Noting her father is filming the fight, Anya takes him to safety. In her absence, Amun seriously wounds Miguel. The encounter leaves Anya doubting her duty due to the danger it poses to her loved ones. However, in a chance encounter, Spider-Man arrives and, after discussing her origins and adventures, tells her, "''With great power comes great responsibility''" and that in every age, people are called to be heroes.

Soon afterwards, Anya fights Amun and, in anger, nearly strangles him to death.  She is stopped by Ted, who tells Amun to run. Ted tells her that she had released "the Spirit of the Hunter" and warns her not to do it again without Miguel with her. Back at WebCorps, Miguel is revived upon being reunited with Anya, and he tells her the history of the organization that would eventually split into Wasps and Spiders.

After an encounter with a gunman in a coffee shop, in which Anya saves Lynn and Amun without revealing her [[secret identity]], Amun promises to respect her double life and to stop targeting her friends and family.

=== Night of the Hunter ===
The Spider Society receives information that the Sisterhood of the Wasp is about to recruit a Mexico City crime lord. The crime lord, Jaime Jade, is rumored to have mental abilities. Disturbingly, he was also involved in the death of Anya's mother in Mexico City about a decade ago. Her death is supposed to have made Anya's father emigrate.

Anya, realizing who Jade is, steals some experimental anti-telepathy gear from WebCorps with the purpose of tracking down Jade, but is stopped by Miguel. When she tries to escape, he traps her in the building. He knows it won't hold her for long, but thinks it will give him enough time to get Jade.

Jade shows some interest in the mental abilities of Vincent, the Wasp's mage. After a demonstration on the way to the safehouse, they are ambushed by the Spider Society. In the battle, Jade mistakes Nina for Anya, but the arrival of Amun and Anya dispels this belief. In the fight, Vincent teleports Jade away. Miguel and Anya agree to work together to track down Jade, if Anya can punish him afterwards.

At the safehouse, Vincent wants to teleport Jade to another safehouse, to keep the Spiders off-balance. Jade declines, and hypnotizes Vincent to leave the building. He will do this on his own, he says.

At school the next day, Amun wants to know why Anya is putting so much effort into this case. He asks that they trust one another as enemies. She tells him that Jade killed her mother. Amun replies that his father is dead. He promises to check her story on the Wasp's computers.

That night, the Spiders arrive at the Wasp safehouse.  The anti-telepathy gear is set up, and they move in. They defeat the guards, but when they face Jade, he taunts Anya.  She loses her temper, and through this he manages to hypnotize her. She knocks out Miguel and carries him to a car.

Amun is checking the Wasps' computers, and he discovers that Anya doesn't have the whole story of her mother's death. He is instructed to go help Vincent - who is currently driving back to New York. A truck horn snaps him back to reality, and he realizes how he has been tricked. He drives back immediately.

At the safehouse, Miguel wakes up, gets Ted and Nina, and is about to go after Jade when their car is destroyed by Vincent.  He fights to keep them there. Further down the road, Anya cannot break free of Jade's hypnosis, but the sight of her mother's ghost wakes her up.  She knocks out Jade and stops the car.  When he wakes up, the car is suspended by a rope over the river.  He thinks she's bluffing, and says, "Little miss super hero won't want my death on her conscience."  She replies, "No, my conscience feels fine," and lets go of the rope.

At this point, Amun arrives, and tells her that Jade was not responsible for her mother's death.  Realizing that he never admitted to it, and Amun may not be lying, she dives into the water to save Jade, but he has already escaped.

=== Spider-Man/Araña: The Hunter Revealed ===
This one shot ends Araña's battle against the wasps. She discovers that her exoskeleton is not an ability from being a 'Hunter', and she has in fact never been a true Hunter. Upon discovering this, and being faced with a gigantic monster summoned by the Wasps, she grants her Hunter abilities to Nina, and renounces Webcorps. In the process, Miguel is killed saving Nina from a blast. In the end, Nina becomes Webcorps' chosen champion, and Araña is free to pursue a new fate.{{Issue|date=July 2010}}

The Bastards link up a video feed of the bound and gagged heroines across televisions, computers, and cell phones throughout New York City, with the intent of executing the girls in order to build up their reputations. After having the duct tape ripped from her mouth by [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]]'s daughter Aftershock, Anya cleverly divides the villains by informing them that Aftershock has lied about her parentage in order to get a spot on the Bastards.

== Powers and abilities ==
Araña originally possessed enhanced strength, speed, reflexes/reactions, agility, coordination, balance, and endurance. She had the ability to cling to walls, and to sprout a spider-like exoskeleton around her body which enhanced these abilities. While her exoskeleton was later ripped out by Doomsday Man,<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' vol. 2 #12</ref> she retained her primary powers until losing all her special abilities during The Grim Hunt.{{issue|date=October 2010}} Araña invented spider-like grappling hooks, which she uses to swing from buildings, or as whip-like weapons, though she has found these to be harder to use since losing her abilities.{{issue|date=October 2010}}

== Other versions ==
=== ''Marvel Team-Up: League of Losers'' ===
Araña features in an arc of [[Robert Kirkman]]'s ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' (vol. 3), featuring a group of C-list heroes dubbed "The League of Losers". A group of heroes including Araña, [[Darkhawk]], [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Dagger]], [[Gravity (comics)|Gravity]], [[X-23]], [[Sleepwalker (comics)|Sleepwalker]], and [[Terror Inc.|Terror]] go to the future to prevent the villain Chronok from stealing [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]]' time machine, (Chronok comes to the present after killing all of Marvel's major heroes). Araña however, dies in an explosion while the team searches for a time machine so that they can travel to the future. The rest of the team succeeds however, and Chronok is defeated.

Due to the [[Marvel Universe]]'s [[Grandfather paradox#Parallel universes resolution|method for resolving time travel paradoxes]], this story takes place in an alternate timeline.

=== ''MC2'' ===
