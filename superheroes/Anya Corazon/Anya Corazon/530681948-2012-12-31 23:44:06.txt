'''Anya Sofia Corazon''' is a [[fictional]] half [[Mexican people|Mexican]] and half [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] [[Superhero#Female superheroes|superheroine]] in the {{Marvel Universe}}. She initially went by the [[pseudonym]] '''Araña''', but later changed to using '''Spider-Girl'''.

==Publication history==
Araña was created by writer [[Fiona Avery]] and artist [[Mark Brooks (comics)|Mark Brooks]] and is based on ideas [[J. Michael Straczynski]] used in his run on ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]''. She was the star of the resurrected ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' [[comic book]] in [[2004 in comics|2004]]. After her storyline ended in ''Amazing Fantasy'' vol. 2 #6, she appeared in her own title, ''Araña: The Heart of the Spider'', starting in January [[2005 in comics|2005]] as part of [[Marvel Next]]. This series ran for twelve issues.

Anya next appeared in the ''[[Ms. Marvel]]'' title as a recruit for service as a licensed superhero under the [[Superhuman Registration Act]]. She then appears next teaming up with [[Rikki Barnes|Nomad]] to fight the secret empire in a backup story in ''[[Captain America]]'' #602-605. Chronologically, her next appearance was during the "[[The Gauntlet and Grim Hunt|Grim Hunt]]" storyline in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]''; however, her appearance in the new ''[[Young Allies (Marvel Comics)|Young Allies]]'' series was published first. As the new Spider-Girl, she starred in a monthly ''Spider-Girl'' comic that debuted on November 17, 2010<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/story/14637/preview_spider-girl_1|title=Marvel.com Preview: Spider-Girl #1|accessdate=2011-10-03}}</ref> as a tie-in to the "[[Spider-Man: Big Time|Big Time]]" storyline in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'',.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicsalliance.com/2010/07/25/spider-man-big-time/|title=Spider-Man: Big Time Begins, 'Spider-Girl,' 'Osborn' and 'Carnage' Comics Announced|accessdate=2011-06-01}}</ref> With the change of moniker she became the second published character to adopt the "Spider-Girl" alter-ego, but she actually comes prior to the [[Spider-Girl|first character]] in the chronology of the [[Marvel Universe]]. Following the series' cancellation, it was announced that Spider-Girl would be receiving a new mini-series as part of the ''[[Spider-Island]]'' [[Fictional crossover#Comics|crossover]].<ref name=SpiderIsland>{{Cite web | url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/paul-tobin-spider-girl-spider-island-110518.html | title=Paul Tobin Talks Spider-Girl's End and Spider-Island Future | last=Ching | first=Albert | work=[[Newsarama]] | date=May 18, 2011}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
[[File:Arana.jpg|thumb|Art from ''Araña: The Heart of the Spider'' #1, by [[Mark Brooks (comics)|Mark Brooks]].]]
On her first day at Milton Summers [[high school|High School]] in [[Fort Greene, Brooklyn]], Anya Corazon is recruited by Miguel, a [[magic (paranormal)|mage]] from a mystical clan called [[The Spider Society]] to act as their Hunter. A ritual is performed on her by giving her a spider-shaped tattoo that endows her with spider-like powers. WebCorps offers Araña various costumes, but Araña decides to make her own costume. She designs a costume with red and blue sneakers, blue track pants, red backpack, red gloves with many pockets, and big goggle-eyed sunglasses. As part of her powers a crusty exoskeleton covers most of her body with a bug-like bluish skin. In place of equipment like web-shooters or spider tracers, Araña attaches cords to discs that are about the size of her palm and have eight red legs able to grip objects. Araña fights a Hunter from The Sisterhood of the Wasp, adversaries of the Spider Society.<ref>''Amazing Fantasy'' vol. 2 #1-6</ref>

===Heart of the Spider===
While interrogating a spy for the Sisterhood of the Wasp, Anya and Miguel discover that the Sisterhood has recruited a fifteen year old boy codenamed Amun, a descendant of Egyptian assassins who believes he is skilled enough that he does not need to conceal his identity. Anya soon meets Amun, who has enrolled at her school under the name Jon Kasiya. The two soon deduce the other's dual identity.

Later, during a fight with Anya, Miguel, and the Sisterhood, Amun tells her that he will attack her loved ones if she opposes him. Noting her father is filming the fight, Anya takes him to safety. In her absence, Amun seriously wounds Miguel. The encounter leaves Anya doubting her duty due to the danger it poses to her loved ones. However, in a chance encounter, Spider-Man arrives and, after discussing her origins and adventures, tells her, "With great power comes great responsibility" and that in every age, people are called to be heroes.

Soon afterwards, Anya fights Amun and, in anger, nearly strangles him to death. She is stopped by Ted, who tells Amun to run. Ted tells her that she had released "the Spirit of the Hunter" and warns her not to do it again without Miguel with her. Back at WebCorps, Miguel is revived upon being reunited with Anya, and he tells her the history of the organization that would eventually split into Wasps and Spiders.

After an encounter with a gunman in a coffee shop, in which Anya saves Lynn and Amun without revealing her [[secret identity]], Amun promises to respect her double life and to stop targeting her friends and family.<ref>''Araña: The Heart of the Spider'' #1-6</ref>

===Night of the Hunter===
The Sisterhood of the Wasp recruits a Mexico City crime lord, Jaime Jade. Jade has mental abilities that allow him to hypnotize other people. He was also possibly involved in the death of Anya's mother. Miguel stops Anya from going after Jade alone with the promise that Anya can punish him afterwards. Anya and Amun develop a loose truce because Amun has lost his father as well, so he checks into Jade's possible involvement in Anya's mother's death.

Jade hypnotizes Anya into fighting Miguel, but she eventually breaks free of his control and knocks Jade out. When Jade wakes up, the car he is in is suspended by a rope over the river. He thinks she's bluffing, and says, "Little miss super hero won't want my death on her conscience." She replies, "No, my conscience feels fine," and lets go of the rope. Amun arrives too late, and tells her that Jade was not responsible for her mother's death. Realizing that he never admitted to it, and Amun may not be lying, she dives into the water to save Jade, but he has already escaped.<ref>''Araña: The Heart of the Spider'' #7-12</ref>

===''Spider-Man/Araña: The Hunter Revealed''===
In this [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] she discovers that her exoskeleton is not an ability from being a Hunter, and she has in fact never been a true Hunter. Upon discovering this, and being faced with a gigantic monster summoned by the Wasps, she grants her Hunter abilities to Nina and renounces Webcorps. During the fight Miguel is killed saving Nina from a blast. In the end, Nina becomes Webcorps' chosen champion, and Araña is free to pursue a new fate.<ref>''Spider-Man/Araña: The Hunter Revealed''</ref>

===''Civil War''===
{{Main|Civil War (comics)}}
The [[SHRA|pro-registration]] heroes have tasked [[Ms. Marvel]] and [[Wonder Man]] to find Anya, convince her to register, and train her. After foiling an attempted robbery Anya and her father are taken into custody where Mr. Corazon learns of Anya's superpowers. He is proud to let her train with Ms. Marvel and Wonder Man. Anya's training will essentially comprise her accompanying Wonder Man and Ms. Marvel on missions and playing "sidekick" to them. Anya accompanies them to [[Stark Tower]], where she forces herself into a meeting with [[Iron Man]], and then on a mission to capture the [[Shroud (comics)|Shroud]] and [[Julia Carpenter|Arachne]]. Arachne escapes, but the Shroud is captured and taken into [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody.<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' vol. 2 #7</ref> A strike team led by Ms. Marvel and Wonder Man arrives at the home of Arachne's parents to take her into custody.<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' vol. 2 #8</ref> After a battle between the heroes, Arachne is arrested and her daughter Rachel forcibly separated from her. Anya is deeply shaken by the ordeal and states that if being a hero means separating a mother from her child, she wants no part of it. However, she remains part of the pro-Registration strikeforce.<ref>''Civil War'' #6</ref>

Before a battle with Doomsday Man, Ms. Marvel asks Anya to go get help if she fails to make contact with her by a certain time.

Her father takes out a restraining order to keep Ms. Marvel away from her, although Anya secretly visits Ms. Marvel to tell her she is not to blame for what happened. Soon after, Anya quits her job, and is confronted by Arachne, who is enraged and demands to know the whereabouts of her daughter.<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' vol. 2 #13</ref> Anya manages to subdue her, but chooses to accompany Ms. Marvel and Arachne in their attempt to find Arachne's daughter, even though that means violating the restraining order her father has placed against Ms. Marvel.<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' vol. 2 #14</ref>

Anya gets into a fight with her father for treating her like a child after he accuses her of seeing Ms. Marvel. She tells him at least Carol is showing her how to grow up.

The Bastards link up a video feed of the bound and gagged heroines across televisions, computers, and cell phones throughout New York City, with the intent of executing the girls in order to build up their reputations. After having the duct tape ripped from her mouth by [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]]'s daughter Aftershock, Anya cleverly divides the villains by informing them that Aftershock has lied about her parentage in order to get a spot on the Bastards. With their captors distracted, Anya and Rikki escape and ultimately defeat the Bastards once the rest of the Young Allies arrive.<ref name="YoungAllies5">''Young Allies'' #5</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
===As Araña===
Araña originally possessed enhanced strength of 3 tons, speed, reflexes/reactions, agility, coordination, balance, and endurance. She had the ability to cling to walls, and to sprout a spider-like exoskeleton around her body which enhanced these abilities and protect her from damage. While her exoskeleton was later ripped out by Doomsday Man,<ref name="Ms. Marvel vol. 2 #12"/> she retained her primary powers.  Araña invented spider-like grappling hooks, which she uses to swing from buildings, or as whip-like weapons, though she has found these to be harder to use since losing her abilities.<ref name="SG1"/>

===As Spider-Girl===
<!-- Do NOT add information such as "able to lift 5 tons" to this section. That is unencyclopedic fancruft and will be removed. When making changes also be sure to check for typos, misspellings, and bad grammar before saving your changes. -->
In an interview with [[Newsarama]], writer [[Paul Tobin]] stated that as Spider-Girl, the character initially lacks superpowers, but Tobin will be "staying away from having her feel crippled by any power loss; it's for sure on her mind, but Anya is a character that wants to focus on what she ''can'' do...". However, Tobin revealed that she regains her powers in the "Spider-Island" storyline.<ref name=SpiderIsland/><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/spider-girl-paul-tobin-100726.html | title=SDCC 2010: Paul Tobin on Araña Becoming Spider-Girl | last=Ching | first=Albert | work=Newsarama | date=July 26, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?id=32252&page=article|title=[[Comic Book Resources]]: Spider-Girl Vacations on "Spider-Island"}}</ref> Anya is given a [[Spider-Man's powers and equipment|copy of Spider-Man's powers]] by [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]], along with the entire non-superhuman population of New York, in the story arc ''[[Spider Island]]''. Anya submits to the island-wide cure, but it is shown that she still retains her copy of Spider-Man's powers as she is later seen webslinging using organic webbing.<ref name="Island3"/><ref name="AA21"/>

==Other versions==
===''Marvel Team-Up: League of Losers''===
Araña features in an arc of [[Robert Kirkman]]'s ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' vol. 3 featuring a group of C-list heroes dubbed "The League of Losers". A group of heroes including Araña, [[Darkhawk]], [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Dagger]], [[Gravity (comics)|Gravity]], [[X-23]], [[Sleepwalker (comics)|Sleepwalker]], and [[Terror Inc.|Terror]] go to the future to prevent the villain Chronok from stealing [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]]' time machine, (Chronok comes to the present after killing all of Marvel's major heroes). Araña however, dies in an explosion while the team searches for a time machine so that they can travel to the future. The rest of the team succeeds however, and Chronok is defeated. Due to the [[Marvel Universe]]'s [[Grandfather paradox#Parallel universes resolution|method for resolving time travel paradoxes]], this story takes place in an alternate timeline.

===What If Grim Hunt===
In the ''[[What If (comics)#Volume 9|What if? Spider-Man: Grim Hunt]]'', an alternative possibility for the events of Grim Hunt begins with the decision of Spider-Man to kill Kraven. Araña, scarred by things that she should not have seen is transported by the [[Julia Carpenter|new Madame Web]] to her residence. Later Madame Web appears in her room in the middle of the night asking Anya to be Spider-Girl. Anya refuses the proposal because she is worried that if she fights against Peter she will make the same decision he made. In the middle of the battle Madame Web teleports her self to get Araña to confront and defeat Peter. Peter ends up blinded by a shotgun he was attempting to use on her. Araña takes over as the head Spider while Peter is left permanently blinded and distant from Mary Jane.<ref>''What If? Spider-Man: Grim Hunt''</ref>

===MC2===
In the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] continuity, an adult Araña, accompanied by a man called Michael, tests [[Spider-Girl]], then covers for her, posing as a fake seer to throw the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]] off track when he tries to find her weaknesses.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Girl'' #14 (Nov. 2007)</ref> She later takes over Spider-Girl's body in an attempt to take down the [[Black Tarantula]], but the two end up trapped in each other's bodies.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Girl'' #26 (Nov. 2008)</ref> Using Spider-Girl's body Araña is able to get close to Black Tarantula and kisses him. However, Black Tarantula, who had been kissed by Araña once before, recognizes and attacks her, using his powers to reverse the mind-switch.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Girl'' #27 (Dec. 2008)</ref> It is later revealed Araña and The Black Tarantula have a personal history with one another, and they bond once more when the Tarantula is attacked by Mayday's symbiotic clone April.

==Status as first Latina superhero==
The promotional copy on the [[digest size|digest]] collection extols Araña as Marvel's first Hispanic superhero. However, she was preceded by [[El Aguila]], [[Firebird (Marvel Comics)|Firebird]], [[Living Lightning]], [[Skin (comics)|Skin]], [[Spider-Man 2099]], [[White Tiger (Hector Ayala)|White Tiger]], [[White Tiger (Angela Del Toro)|Angela Del Toro]], and [[La Bandera]].
