Prometheus is a member of the super hero family the [[Pantheon (Marvel Comics)|Pantheon]]. Prometheus was born with a deformed face that looks horribly burned. Prometheus drives a very high tech vehicle created by the Pantheon engineers called the Argo. Prometheus debuted trying to kidnap Bruce Banner the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]'s alter-ego. 

Prometheus is an excellent tracker even over interstellar distances. Prometheus is a smoker. When [[Agamemnon (Pantheon)|Agamemnon]] turned rogue and unleashed his cyborgs the Endless Knights upon the Pantheon the Hulk entrusted Prometheus with the safety of his wife [[Betty Ross Banner]].

Prometheus arguably had the least developed personality out of all the Pantheon members.
