'''Prometheus''' is one of the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] of Greek Mythology and the son of Iapetus. His siblings included Atlas, Menoetius, and Epimetheus. When their uncle Cronus' rule was challenged by [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]], Prometheus and Epimetheus sided with the [[Olympians (Marvel Comics)|Olympians]] while Atlas and Menoetius sided with Cronus. With the help of Prometheus and Epimetheus, the Olympians defeated the Titans. Prometheus and Epimetheus took an interest in mankind and became the joint rulers in Phthia. Prometheus has taken in interest in the humans and later learned various skills from [[Athena (Marvel Comics)|Athena]] that started to get Zeus concerned. When Prometheus took fire from the Gods and taught the humans how to cook, Zeus had Kratos and Bia bind Prometheus to a pillar in the Caucasian Mountains using chains that were forged by [[Hephaestus (Marvel Comics)|Hephaestus]]. Zeus also had an eagle peck out Prometheus' liver which grew back every night. Zeus did offer to shorten his life of being chained to a pillar if he would give him the vision of the prophecy that would one day dethrone Zeus. Seven generations later, [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] came across Prometheus during his [[Labours of Hercules|12 Labours]] when on his way to the Amazons. Hercules killed the eagle and then freed Prometheus. Zeus was at first against this, but decided to end Prometheus' punishment. Prometheus foresaw this event and vows to repay Hercules one day.<ref>''Greek Myths''</ref>

In the modern era, Hercules was badly injured in a fight with [[Baron Zemo|Baron Helmut Zemo]]'s [[Masters of Evil]] where [[Black Mamba (comics)|Black Mamba]] drugged Hercules causing him to foolishly charge into battle. When Zeus (who was unaware that the Masters of Evil were responsible for Hercules ending up in a coma) had [[Neptune (Marvel Comics)|Neptune]] abduct [[Namor]] and bring him to the Underworld, Prometheus managed to heal Namor after he escaped Cerberus and barely made it across the Phlegathon River. He then directed Namor to where the other [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] were being held which happened to be the Garrison of the Accursed at Fortress Tartarus.<ref>''Avengers'' #282</ref> After the Avengers made their way to Mount Olympus, Prometheus spoke to them while they were in the woods. When Zeus caught up to the Avengers while [[Doctor Druid]] was healing Hercules' brain, Prometheus then declares that the battle between man and gods has begun.<ref>''Avengers'' #283</ref> While Zeus continues his fight with the Avengers, [[Hera (Marvel Comics)|Hera]] sided with Prometheus and [[Hermes (Marvel Comics)|Hermes]]. Prometheus healed [[Captain America]] and Doctor Druid before proceeding to try his luck into healing Hercules where Doctor Druid and [[Apollo (Marvel Comics)|Apollo]] had failed. Under the advice of Hermes, Prometheus called upon [[Gaea (Marvel Comics)|Gaea]]'s help to do so while [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and [[Monica Rambeau|Captain Marvel]] continued their fight with Zeus. When Captain Marvel attempted to attack Zeus, the blinding light she gave off distracted Prometheus which caused Hercules to be revived in a state of paranoia where he attacked Prometheus.<ref>''Avengers'' #284</ref> Luckily for Prometheus, Doctor Druid managed to fully heal Hercules' mind. After Zeus' attack was halted, Prometheus arrived showing signs of aging with some of his hair turning white. Prometheus then attended a reception on Mount Olympus. Before teleporting the Avengers away, Prometheus warned the Avengers that there will be many challenges to come to them and that mankind will be sorely tested on one of them.<ref>''Avengers'' #285</ref>

Prometheus is an excellent tracker even over interstellar distances. He uses this as part of a mission to help fellow Pantheon member [[Atalanta (Pantheon)|Atalanta]]. While rescuing her, they learn that Agamemon had gained his resources by selling out his future descendants.{{Issue|date=July 2011}}

Because of this Agamemnon is captured and put on trial. Having been revealed to be mad, he unleashes his 'Endless Knights', cyborgs made of his dead children. During the battle, the Hulk entrusts Prometheus with the safety of Betty.{{Issue|date=July 2011}}
