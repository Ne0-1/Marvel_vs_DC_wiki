The '''Fenris Wolf''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]], based on [[Fenrir|Fenrisulfr]] from [[Norse mythology]].

==Fictional character biography==
The Fenris Wolf is a creature of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] origin, said to be offspring of [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] and the [[Giants (Marvel Comics)|giantess]] Angrboda.

Just like Norse mythology, [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]] had the [[Norse dwarves|dwarfs]] forge the chain [[Gleipnir]] ("deceiver" or "entangler"). It appeared to be only a silken ribbon but was made of six wondrous ingredients: the sound of a cat's footfall, the beard of a woman, the roots of a mountain, bear's sinews (meaning nerves, sensibility), fish's breath, and bird's spittle (which explains why these things are not found today). When it came to binding the Fenris Wolf, [[Tyr (Marvel Comics)|Tyr]] lost his hand in the process.

It is prophesied that when [[Ragnar√∂k|Ragnarok]] occurs, Fenris will devour Odin.

[[Hela (Marvel Comics)|Hela]] one time unchained Fenris Wolf to bring about Ragnarok only to be thwarted by [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].

[[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]] later unchained Fenris Wolf to aid him, [[Ulik]], and [[Hyrm]] in attacking Asgard using weapons that were forged for them by [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]]. Ulik and Fenris Wolf attacked Thor together only for Thor to attack them using Mjolnid which resulted in the blast removing [[Sif (Marvel Comics)|Sif]]'s arm. Hyrm joined up with Ulik and Fenris Wolf and managed to shatter Mjolnid.

Later on, Fenris Wolf attacked Thor, [[Captain America]], and [[Iron Man]] when they were in Asgard. When Fenris Wolf was about to attack Thor, Captain America threw his shield into the mouth. Captain America kicked Fenris Wolf in the stomach to reclaim the shield as Thor attacked him badly followed by Captain America scaring Fenris Wolf off. 

When [[Kurse]] was protecting innocent children, Fenris fought Kurse and killed him by sending a hammer into his skull.

Fenris Wolf once battled the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and his [[Pantheon (Marvel Comics)|Pantheon]] allies.

Fenris Wolf assisted in the attack on Vanaheim and faced Thor again in battle. Thor bound Fenris Wolf in chains and used it's body to knock down Durok in order to save Sif. With Durok slain, Fenris Wolf snapped it's chains and fought Thor only to be struck down by [[Beta Ray Bill]]. Beta Ray Bull used the power of his hammer Stormbreaker upon the Fenris Wolf reduced to a skeleton as the monster's punishment for attacking a weakened Thor. Those that were fighting with the Fenris Wolf fled.

Fenris Wolf returned to life and swallowed Asgard's sun and the moon assisting to bring about Ragnarok as Asgard perishes.
