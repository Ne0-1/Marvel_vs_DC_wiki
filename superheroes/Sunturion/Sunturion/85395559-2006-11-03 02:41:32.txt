'''Sunturion''' is the name of two [[fictional character]]s appearing in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]; it was also the name of the suit of [[power armor]] the characters wore.  The first Sunturion clashed with [[Iron Man]], and the second fought [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]].

==History==
The Sunturion suit was developed by [[Roxxon Oil]] in conjunction with their genetic research division, the [[Brand Corporation]], under the auspices of '''Arthur Dearborn''', who also volunteered as a test subject.  The original purpose of the Sunturion was to serve as guardian and crew for ''Star Well I'', a Roxxon orbiting solar satellite that would beam power through [[microwave]]s to earth (with the transmitters wholly and solely controlled by Roxxon).  The scientists at Brand, according to Dearborn, converted his mass to microwave energy, and they placed his mutated energy-form into the suit.

An accident on Star Well I resulted in the death of the entire town of Allentown, [[Iowa]], and brought [[Iron Man]] in his Space Armor to investigate. Iron Man and Sunturion battled, and knocked Star Well I out of orbit onto a course that would smash into [[Sarasota, Florida]].  Dearborn seemingly sacrificed himself to power the Space Armor and let Iron Man detect the crashing space station. Iron Man believed Dearborn and Sunturion dead after this.

'''Mike Stone''', a [[trucker]] for the Continental Trucking Company who was tired for trafficking in drugs, found the suit while on a fishing trip in Florida. He donned the suit to get back at his former employer, but lacking Dearborn's mutagenic modifications, was soon absorbed by the suit. The vigilante [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] opened the suit, letting Stone's energy dissipate into the atmosphere, and defeated the second Sunturion. The present state or location of the suit is unknown.

Roxxon later re-integrated Dearborn's energy form so that he could stop [[Stratosfire]], a former Roxxon employee who had been given similar abilities to those Sunturion had and had gone rogue.

==Powers & abilities==
The Sunturion [[power armor|armor]] is constructed of high-quality [[plastic]]s and [[metal]]s, reinforced by [[microwave]] energy.  The suit provides a great deal of protection from physical damage, but is even more effective at protecting against damage from energy attacks.  The suit is powered by the user; ideally the prospective wearer undergoes [[Mutation|mutagenic modification]]s that convert him or her into microwave energy, but the suit itself can apparently convert non-modified wearers into microwave energy in order to power itself.  When powered, the suit can be used to project damaging microwave energy blasts and protective forcefields from the gauntlets and to [[teleportation|teleport]] and/or fly at [[Speed of light|light-speed]].
