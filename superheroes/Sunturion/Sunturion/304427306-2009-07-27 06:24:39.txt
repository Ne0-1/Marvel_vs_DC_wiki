'''Sunturion''' is the name of two [[fictional character]]s that appear in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The original version first appears in [[Iron Man]] #143 (Feb. 1981) and was created by writer [[David Michelinie]] and penciller [[Bob Layton]]. The second character first appears in [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] #224 (Nov. 1985) and was created by writer [[Jim Owsley]] and pencillers [[Daniel Jurgens]] and [[Geof Isherwood]].

==Publication history==
===Arthur Dearborn===
The character's origin is revealed in the title ''Iron Man'': the Sunturion suit is originally developed by the company [[Roxxon Oil]] in conjunction with their [[genetic research]] division, the [[Brand Corporation]]. It is bonded to Roxxon employee '''Arthur Dearborn''', who serves as guardian and crew for ''Star Well I'', a Roxxon orbiting solar [[satellite]] that transmits [[microwave]] energy to Earth. An accident on Star Well I results in the death of the entire town of Allentown, [[Iowa]], and as a result the hero [[Iron Man]] arrives to investigate. Iron Man and Sunturion battle, and after Roxxon attempts to destroy the satellite the characters manage to drive Star Well I out of orbit into the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]]. In the act of powering up Iron Man's armor to deflect the crashing space station, Dearborn apparently sacrifices himself. <ref>''Iron Man'' #143 - 144 (Feb. - Mar. 1981)</ref>

In an ''Iron Man'' Annual Roxxon eventually re-integrate Dearborn's energy form, intending to use Sunturion against '''Stratosfire''', a former Roxxon employee with abilities almost identical to those of Sunturion.  Stratosfire is originally a corporate symbol for Roxxon (as Iron Man is for Stark International), but turns against the company when asked to destroy the refineries of competing oil companies. Sunturion battles Stratosfire and activates the character's "Zed Control", a Roxxon-implanted [[self-destruct]] device that dissipates Stratosfire's microwave energies and returns Dearborn to human form. <ref>''Iron Man'' Annual #9 (1987)</ref>

Dearborn reappears as Sunturion in the ''Vibranium Vendetta'' storyline with hero [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Annual #25; ''Spectacular Spider-Man #11 & ''Web of Spider-Man'' Annual #7 (all Dec. 1991)</ref>

===Mike Stone===
The Sunturion armor reappears in the title ''Daredevil'', as after Sunturion's initial sacrifice in space, [[truck]] driver '''Mike Stone''' finds the armor while on a [[fishing]] trip in Florida. Stone dons the suit to have revenge on a former employer, but lacking Dearborn's mutagenic modifications is absorbed by the armor. The vigilante [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] battles Stone and opens the armor, causing Stone to dissipate into the atmosphere. <ref>''Daredevil'' #224 (Nov. 1985)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Sunturion [[power armor|armor]] is a high-quality plastic-metal all-environment construct powered by [[microwave]] energy generated by the user. While Arthur Dearborn underwent [[mutation|mutagenic modification]] to convert him into microwave energy, the suit can apparently convert non-modified wearers into microwave energy to power itself. When powered, the suit can be used to project microwave energy blasts; create force fields; allow teleportation and fly at velocity speed and replenish energy stores via solar absorption.

==Other media==
===Television===
* The original version of Sunturion appears in the ''[[Iron Man (TV series)|Iron Man]]'' episode "Cell of Iron", with Arthur Dearborn voiced by [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]] and Sunturion voiced by [[Tom Kane]].
