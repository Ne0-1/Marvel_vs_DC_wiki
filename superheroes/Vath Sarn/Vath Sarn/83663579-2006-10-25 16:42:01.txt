'''Vath Sarn''' is a [[fictional]] [[comic book]] [[superhero]], an [[extraterrestrial]] from the planet [[Rann]], and a member of the intergalactic police force known as the [[Green Lantern Corps]]. He first appeared in [[DC Comics]]' ''[[Green Lantern Corps: Recharge]]'' # 1 (November 2005), and was created by writers [[Geoff Johns]] and [[Dave Gibbons]], and artist [[Patrick Gleason (artist)|Patrick Gleason]].

==Character history==
Vath is a veteran soldier of the [[Rann-Thanagar War]]. While in the heat of battle, he encountered a Green Lantern power ring, the powerful weapon assigned to each member of the Green Lantern Corps. The Corps was in the process of recruiting 7,200 new members in an effort to rebuild their ranks following their destruction at the hands of the villain [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]]. The rings allow their bearers to conjure virtually any object or form of energy limited only by the imagination and willpower of the wearer, and thus the rings, which all include a [[sentient]] computer and the means to travel through interstellar space, sought out beings capable of overcoming great fear. When Sarn put his on, he tried to use it to use it to continue fighting the Thanagarians, but as the Corps code does not provide for participation in planetary wars, it immediately transported Sarn to the planet Oa, home to the extraterrestrial [[Guardians of the Universe]], who administrate and oversee the Corps. There, he would be trained as a Green Lantern.

Sarn was given a temporary badge and partnered with fellow new recruit [[Isamot Kol]], a Thanagarian who was also plucked from the war. In contrast to Sarnâ€™s discipline and adaptability, Kol still saw Sarn as an enemy from the war, and instigated conflict with him as they began their first assignment, diverting ships away from Star 38, which, like several recent stars, had begun to show signs of instability. Kol was also slow to adapt to Corps protocols, questioning his orders, and even threatening an [[Okaaran]] hospital ship that fired upon him after refusing to change course from the star, though the two eventually came to perform their duties as Lanterns valiantly together. The star eventually went [[supernova]], and the two new recruits valiantly attempted to pull the ship from the ensuing black hole, but were sucked in. They were eventually saved by GL trainer [[Kilowog]], and rendezvoused with other Green Lanterns while learning that the source of the recent supernovas was the [[Spider Guild]], a group of humanoid [[arachnids]] from the [[Vega]] star system that were planning to attack Oa. Sarn and the other Green Lanterns returned to Oa, where they successfully repelled the attack.
