'''Vath Sarn''' is a [[fictional]] [[comic book]] [[superhero]], an [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]] from the planet [[Rann]], and a member of the intergalactic police force known as the [[Green Lantern Corps]]. He first appeared in [[DC Comics]]' ''[[Green Lantern Corps: Recharge]]'' # 1 (November 2005), and was created by writers [[Geoff Johns]] and [[Dave Gibbons]], and artist [[Patrick Gleason (artist)|Patrick Gleason]].

==Character history==
Vath is a veteran soldier of the [[Rann-Thanagar War]]. While in the heat of battle, he encountered a Green Lantern power ring, the powerful weapon assigned to each member of the Green Lantern Corps. The Corps was in the process of recruiting 7,200 new members in an effort to rebuild their ranks following their destruction at the hands of the villain [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]]. The rings allow their bearers to conjure virtually any object or form of energy limited only by the imagination and willpower of the wearer, and thus the rings, which all include a [[Sentience|sentient]] computer and the means to travel through interstellar space, sought out beings capable of overcoming great fear. When Sarn put his on, he tried to use it to use it to continue fighting the Thanagarians, but as the Corps code does not provide for participation in planetary wars, it immediately transported Sarn to the planet Oa, home to the extraterrestrial [[Guardians of the Universe]], who administrate and oversee the Corps. There, he would be trained as a Green Lantern for sector 2682.

Sarn was given a temporary badge and partnered with fellow new recruit [[Isamot Kol]], a Thanagarian who was also plucked from the war. In contrast to Sarnâ€™s discipline and adaptability, Kol still saw Sarn as an enemy from the war, and instigated conflict with him as they began their first assignment. This task was diverting ships away from Star 38, which, like several recent stars, had begun to show signs of instability. Kol was also slow to adapt to Corps protocols, questioning his orders. He even threatens an [[Okaara]]n hospital ship that fires upon him after refusing to change course from the star. The two eventually came to perform their duties as Lanterns valiantly together. The star eventually went [[supernova]], and the two new recruits valiantly attempted to pull the ship from the ensuing black hole, but were sucked in. They were eventually saved by GL trainer [[Kilowog]]. They infiltrated a [[Spider Guild]] ship. Kilowog, being too large, was forced to send Vath and Isamot ahead, where they managed to gain vital intelligence on what the Guild was planning. The trio battle more and eventually join up with other Lanterns, including [[Kyle Rayner]], [[Soranik Natu]], [[Stel]] and [[Guy Gardner]]. The information leads them to realize Oa was under attack by the Guild. Despite lower power levels throughout the group, they manage to fight their way back to Oa and help repel the attack.

Isamot has gone back to Thanagar in order to be with his mate, Qalyra. They are both under the affects of their saurian biology, with an intense urge to mate. Vath, who visits the planet also, becomes endangered when attackaing [[Citadel (comics)|Citadel]] forces prove too much for him and he needs Isamot, who can't decide who to follow.

Following the events of the [[Sinestro Corps]] war, Vath took it upon himself to honor of the fallen Green Lanterns, by creating replicas of them with his ring, speaking their names aloud and taking a drink in their memory.
