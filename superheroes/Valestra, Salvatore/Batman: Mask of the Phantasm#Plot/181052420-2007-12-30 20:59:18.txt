{{Refimprove|date=July 2007}}
'''''Batman: Mask of the Phantasm''''' is an [[animation|animated film]] first released on [[December 25]], [[1993 in film|1993]]. Although released in the [[Tim Burton]] era, it is completely unrelated to the [[live action]] movies. It was created by the same cast and crew as ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', having been originally intended as a direct-to-video spin-off from the series.

This movie was going to be originally the finale of ''Batman: The Animated Series'', and was the first animated feature released by [[Warner Bros.]] not to feature the [[Looney Tunes]] characters or have any crew connections with Looney Tunes.  On that note, when Batman chases the Joker at the model of Gotham City, a Warner Brothers logo can be seen clearly at one of the warehouses.

The opening theme's lyrics are said to be the names of the design staff, sung backwards. The ending theme, "I Never Even Told You" was performed by actress [[Tia Carrere]].

==Plot==
The film's story divides into two parts: one in the film's "present", and one, told through flashbacks, in the early days of Bruce Wayne's crimefighting career.

Bruce Wayne's fledgling career faces two major obstacles: first, he is having trouble getting criminals to take him seriously at first sight (having not yet become the Batman); second, he has fallen in love. The recipient of his affections is [[Andrea Beaumont]], red-haired and blue-eyed, not only beautiful but seemingly his equal in every way. Realizing that an ongoing relationship with Andrea would massively complicate his crusade against crime, Bruce decides that one of them has to go. After a long internal struggle, the Caped Crusader loses. Bruce proposes to Andrea, and she accepts. The next day, however, Andrea sends her engagement ring back with a note telling Bruce to forget her, and leaves the country. Devastated, Bruce throws himself back into crimefighting, and after discovering a large bat-haunted cavern in his backyard, becomes [[Batman]].

In the present, a mysterious cloaked figure is stalking and killing [[Gotham City]] mob bosses. The murders are the work of a new vigilante, the Phantasm, but the police (except Commissioner Gordon) attribute them to Batman. Arthur Reeves, a stubborn city councilman, vows to lead the manhunt to capture Batman. The situation becomes complicated when Andrea Beaumont returns to Gotham, forcing Bruce Wayne to deal with the feelings he still has for her. Things are further complicated when Batman discovers that the link between the slain mob bosses is Andrea's now-deceased father, who had business dealings with all of them years ago. He also sees a picture of the mobsters and realizes that one of the two remaining gangsters on the Phantasm's hit-list, and the one who killed Andrea's father, was the man who became The Joker.

Salvatore Valestra, the second-to-last surviving mobster on the list, tries to hire the Joker (his former henchman before his change) to kill Batman. When the Phantasm visits Valestra's home, he finds Valestra slain by the Joker's poison gas, rigged with a bomb that almost kills the Phantasm but the figure escapes. Batman arrives on scene to apprehend the Phantasm, but the two are interrupted by the police. Batman narrowly escapes the police and even abandons his mask. But Batman is saved when Andrea shows up in a getaway car. At Wayne Manor, Andrea admits that her father had embezzled the mobsters' money, and the two were forced to flee the country when he was discovered. Andrea then says that she came to Gotham to prevent her father from killing more people. Batman later discovers that the Joker worked as a hitman for the mobsters before his transformation.

The Joker visits councilman Reeves and blows the whole story wide open to him before intoxicating him with [[joker venom|Joker gas]]. Reeves had helped the Beaumonts flee Gotham, but later sold them out to the mob when he desperately needed money for an election campaign. After learning this information from a dying Reeves, Batman tracks the Joker down to an abandoned theme park, where the Phantasm, who is really Andrea out to avenge her father's murder, is out for the Joker's blood. But the Joker escapes death and is victorious in a fight between him and Andrea. After saving Andrea himself from one of the Joker's traps, she reveals her secrets, Batman begs Andrea to stop and asks what vengeance will ever accomplish, Andrea says that Batman should know the answer to that question more than anyone. Batman sets out to find his enemy, eventually coming into a tussle with him that leads to a showdown in the sky. Joker is defeated, and Andrea seizes her prey. But the Joker has detonated bombs placed all over the park, and he and the Phantasm disappear in the confusion.

After escaping the inferno through a series of sewers, Batman assumed that Andrea and the Joker had perished in the blaze. Bruce weeps, saying to Alfred that he couldn't save Andrea. Alfred tries to comfort Bruce by stating that despite the years he has been Batman he has never fallen down the pit of cruelty, but Andrea had fallen down that pit many years ago, and says clearly with content that no one not even Batman could have pulled her out of it. She had survived, however, (and as ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'' reveals, so had the Joker, although whether he defeated Andrea and fled or was spared his life is revealed in the first annual special of the comic based upon the series, revealing Andrea, aside from missing the blast, released Joker after realizing it was no longer the heartless killer of her father, but rather an insane clown) and left a locket for him as a keepsake in the Batcave. In the penultimate scene of the film, Andrea stands on the deck of an ocean-liner, alone. The ending scene changes to show Batman standing alone as well on top of a building. The Bat signal emerges in the distance and Batman flies into action, showing that Bruce Wayne will be Batman for as long as he can fight the forces of darkness.

==Rating and content==
Due to the much more relaxed standards and practices of a motion picture, Timm and company could get away with more violence than on TV. Therefore, the film marks the first time the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] was actually allowed to kill somebody, a crime lord (Salvatore Valestra) via laughing gas (his rotting corpse is then blown to bits after the Joker blows up his apartment in an attempt to kill the Phantasm), and, off screen, Andrea's father (Carl Beaumont). Even though Arthur Reeves' fate was uncertain as last seen in the movie, he does appear again in the comic book series based on the animated series ''[[Batman and Robin Adventures]]'' Annual #1. With his face damaged with the same permanent grin of the Joker's, he is out for revenge on Beaumont and Batman for ruining his political career. He hires a deadly female assassin and several others to kidnap and possibly kill Andrea until Batman rescues her. The Phantasm appears again and thinking it's Andrea, Reeves picks up her sickle and lunges at her, but it's only her cape and Reeves falls several stories to his death. Two other deaths also occur in the film (Chuckie Sol and Buzz Bronsky).

The relaxed standards and practices extended to other areas of the film, as well; in one sequence, Andrea is shown to have spent the night at Wayne Manor after saving Batman from the police. As she appears wearing only one of Bruce's shirts, it's heavily implied that Bruce and Andrea had sex the night before. Earlier in the film, the Joker also subtly jokes about having sex with his robot "wife" Hazel.

Violence in general was much more brutal, particularly one scene where Batman kicks out one of the Joker's teeth and the chase sequence between the police and Batman. The use of characters bleeding was also increased particularly in the case of Batman and the Joker. Gunfire was also more intense and heavily used here. As a result of this, the film received a "PG" rating in the USA "for animated violence".

==Critical reaction==
The movie was extremely well received by fans of ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', and earned a positive review from almost every critic, though it was not critically screened during its theatrical run. For instance, [[film critic]]s ''[[At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper|Siskel and Ebert]]'', while regretting that they originally ignored the film in its initial release, gave the film a "two thumbs up" after they viewed the video release,<ref>[http://bventertainment.go.com/tv/buenavista/ebertandroeper/index2.html?sec=1&subsec=1374 ''Siskel & Ebert'' - ''Batman: Mask of the Phantasm'']</ref> while ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'', ''[[Batman Returns]]''  and ''[[Batman Forever]]'' all received a split vote.<ref>[http://bventertainment.go.com/tv/buenavista/ebertandroeper/index2.html?sec=1&subsec=170 ''Siskel & Ebert'' - ''Batman'']</ref>.<ref>[http://bventertainment.go.com/tv/buenavista/ebertandroeper/index2.html?sec=1&subsec=737 ''Siskel & Ebert'' - ''Batman Returns'']</ref><ref>[http://bventertainment.go.com/tv/buenavista/ebertandroeper/index2.html?sec=1&subsec=1357 ''Siskel & Ebert'' - ''Batman Forever'']</ref>  [[Rotten Tomatoes]] lists it as having 17 positive reviews out of 20 posted, thus earning an 85% rating.

The dark nature of the film has also been respected by animation fans, in particular the [[film noir]]-esque storyline and frame structure.

==Box office==
Despite all the positive reviews the movie received, it was not a huge success at the box office. Costing less than a million dollars to produce and promote, it only grossed [[United States dollar|$]]5 million domestically and $11 million worldwide, and due to its low earnings, most theaters stopped showing it after only one or two weeks. It was also largely overshadowed by the equally dark animated film ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' and the much brighter Disney-esque ''[[We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story (film)|We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story]]''. Blame could be laid on the lack of advertisement and the rush decision to put it in theatres at all; up until mere weeks before its premiere, directors [[Bruce Timm]] and [[Eric Radomski]] believed it was going to be a DTV effort only. All future animated [[Batman]] movies would be released [[direct-to-video]].

However, when the film was released to video on [[April 26]], [[1994]], it turned a substantially higher profit, earning millions more than in its limited theatrical release.

==References to the Comics==
* The storyline of ''Mask of the Phantasm'' utilizes elements of the comic ''[[Batman: Year Two]]'', although it creates a very different story out of them. The film also uses some elements from ''[[Batman: Year One]]'', (''e.g.'' Bruce visiting his parents grave, Bruce starting out as a vigilante and making mistakes, realizing that criminals weren't afraid of him, and being chased by Gotham police.)
* In the scene in which Batman links Buzz Bronsky and Chuckie Sol, he mentions the front companies O'Neil Funding Corporation and Adams Tool and Die. These names are references to the legendary Batman writer / artist team from the 1970s, [[Dennis O'Neil]] and [[Neal Adams]].

==References to the Animated Series==
* During a party at Wayne Manor, a woman who appears to be an ex-girlfriend of Bruce Wayne splashes him with wine. She was also seen with Bruce in the ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' episode "[[Joker's Wild]]" and in several other episodes. Her name is Veronica Vreeland.
* Daniel Mockridge, the man the Riddler attempted to kill in "[[If You're So Smart, Why Aren't You Rich?]]", is visible in the background at the aforementioned party.

==Miscellanea==
* In the scene where Andrea is being sucked into the fan at the Gotham worlds fair, Batman rides in on his motorcycle. He turns into the fan to rescue her, but his cape is flapping in the opposite direction to the fans sucking.
* After Batman has left Andrea's apartment she drops a glass. We hear the sound of the glass shattering, but when the camera zooms out we see the glass is still in one piece.
* During the opening sequence, the camera pulls back dramatically through the myriad buildings of Gotham City. As this occurs, the camera actually passes through several buildings - a common 3D animation problem when rendering. As a result, a few buildings "pop" into view out of nowhere.
