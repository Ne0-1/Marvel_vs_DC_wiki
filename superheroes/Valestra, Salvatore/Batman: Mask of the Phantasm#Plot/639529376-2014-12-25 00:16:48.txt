'''''Batman: Mask of the Phantasm''''' (also known as '''''Batman: The Animated Movie''''') is a 1993 American [[Animation|animated]] [[Superhero film|superhero]] [[mystery film]] featuring the [[DC Comics]] character [[Batman]], and is based on the 1990s ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''. The film features the [[Voice acting|voice talents]] of [[Kevin Conroy]], [[Mark Hamill]] and [[Efrem Zimbalist, Jr.]] (reprising their roles from ''The Animated Series''), in addition to the voices of [[Dana Delany]], [[Hart Bochner]], [[Stacy Keach]] and [[Abe Vigoda]]. The film's storyline introduces [[Andrea Beaumont]], Bruce Wayne's former [[significant other]], who returns to [[Gotham City]], restarting their romance. At the same time, a new mysterious vigilante begins systematically eliminating Gotham's [[crime boss]]es, and due to the person's dark appearance, he is mistaken for Batman. Now on the run from the police, the Dark Knight must apprehend the killer, clear his name, and deal with the romance between himself and Andrea.

The film was distributed by [[Warner Bros.]], directed by [[Bruce Timm]] and [[Eric Radomski]] and written by [[Alan Burnett]], [[Paul Dini]], [[Michael Reaves]] and [[Martin Pasko]]. The original idea was to release the film as [[direct-to-video]], but the studio decided for a theatrical release, giving the filmmakers a strenuous eight-month schedule. ''Mask of the Phantasm'' received widespread acclaim from critics, who praised the film for its animation style, dialogue and acting, but it was a [[box office bomb]] due to the decision to release the film in theaters on such short notice. The film has since found cult success through its various [[VHS]] and [[DVD]] releases.

The film's success spawned two direct-to-video sequels: ''[[Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero]]'' and ''[[Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman]]''.

==Plot==
During a conference of [[Organized crime|crime bosses]] held in a [[Gotham City]] skyscraper, gangster Chuckie Sol is killed by a mysterious cloaked figure, shortly after [[Batman]] bursts in on the meeting. Due to the killer's resemblance to Batman, the Dark Knight is blamed for Sol's death. Councilman Arthur Reeves tells the media that Batman is a public menace (despite [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]]'s protests), then later attends a party at the mansion of billionaire Bruce Wayne, Batman's secret identity. Reeves teases Bruce about his bad luck with women and for having allowed an old girlfriend, [[Andrea Beaumont]], to get away.

In a flashback to 10 years before, Bruce meets Andrea in a cemetery while visiting his parents' grave. That night, in one of his first crime-fighting attempts, Bruce foils an armored car robbery while disguised in a black ski-mask and leather jacket. Though he succeeds, he is discouraged that the criminals did not fear him. Around the same time, he begins a romance with Andrea. Eventually, Bruce decides to abandon his plan to become a crime-fighting [[vigilante]] and proposes marriage to Andrea. Soon afterward, however, Andrea mysteriously leaves Gotham with her father, Carl Beaumont, ending her engagement to Bruce in a [[Dear John letter]]. Believing that he has lost his last chance of having a normal life, Bruce dons the mask of Batman for the first time.

The mysterious killer finds and murders another gangster, Buzz Bronski. Around the same time, Batman discovers that Andrea has returned to Gotham for the first time in 10 years. Batman soon finds evidence linking Andrea's father with gangster Salvatore Valestra, for whom both Sol and Bronski once worked as enforcers. The killer later targets Valestra, who turns to [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]] for help. The killer arrives at Valestra's house, and finds the gangster already dead at the Joker's hands; the house explodes, with the killer barely escaping. Batman pursues the killer, but is interrupted by the police, who believe that Batman is responsible for the murders. Andrea rescues Batman in her car, and they spend the night together at [[Wayne Manor]]. Andrea explains to Bruce that she and her father had been hiding in Europe from the Valestra mob, to whom he owed a lot of money. Batman comes to suspect that Andrea's father may be the killer, but later gets Reeves (who now knows of Batman's innocence but has been poisoned by the Joker, who believed him to be the mastermind behind the murders) to confess that he told the Valestra mob where Beaumont was hiding in return for campaign contributions, and that the mob ordered Beaumont's death.

The killer tracks the Joker to his hideout — an abandoned [[world's fair]] amusement park — and removes its ominous costume: the killer is Andrea, intent on avenging her father's death at the hands of the Joker, who is revealed to be the last surviving member and professional hitman of the Valestra mob. Batman arrives and saves Andrea from the Joker, and begs Andrea to give up her quest for revenge. She refuses, stating that the mob ruined her life by taking away her future with him; she tells Batman that he himself is driven by revenge before disappearing. Batman battles with the Joker, a struggle that ends in stalemate. Moments later, Andrea returns and seizes the Joker, bidding Batman goodbye before vanishing with the maniacally laughing clown in a cloud of smoke as the entire amusement park erupts in a series of rigged explosions. Batman barely escapes by falling into a waterway and being swept away to safety by the current.

[[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]] later consoles a heartbroken Bruce, telling him that no one could have helped Andrea. Bruce finds a locket containing a picture of himself and Andrea left behind in the [[Batcave]]. Meanwhile, Andrea is shown standing alone on the deck of a departing ocean liner. In the final scene, Batman stands alone on the top of a Gotham building; when the [[Bat-Signal]] appears in the sky, he swings off into the night to continue his war on crime.

==Cast==
[[File:Phantasm-locket.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Bruce discovers a locket that Andrea left for him in the Batcave.]]
* [[Kevin Conroy]] as [[Batman|Bruce Wayne/Batman]]; a billionaire industrialist whose parents were killed by a [[Joe Chill|mugger]] when he was eight years old. After traveling the world for several years to seek the means to fight injustice, he returns to Gotham. At night, Bruce becomes Batman, Gotham City's secret vigilante protector.
* [[Dana Delany]] as [[Andrea Beaumont]]; a woman Bruce meets in the early years of his return to Gotham after traveling the world. The decision to propose to her in marriage leads to him abandoning his plans for becoming a vigilante. However, after she unexpectedly and mysteriously leaves, Bruce's frustration leads to his becoming Batman. Delany's voice performance in the film impressed the filmmakers, leading to her casting as [[Lois Lane]] in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]''.<ref>{{cite news|author=Barry Freiman|title=Exclusive Interview with Dana Delany|publisher=Superman Homepage|date=2005-06-14|url= http://www.supermanhomepage.com/tv/tv.php?topic=interviews/dana-delany|accessdate=2008-01-28| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080210035723/http://www.supermanhomepage.com/tv/tv.php?topic=interviews/dana-delany| archivedate= 10 February 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>[[File:Phantasm-costume.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The murderous vigilante, identified in the end credits as the Phantasm.]]
* [[Hart Bochner]] as City Councilman Arthur Reeves; a corrupt city official who was once an intern for Carl Beaumont. He later becomes involved with Valestra's gang in order to gain the influence to enter City Council, and told them where his former boss was hiding in return for campaign funds. Years later, the Joker tracks him down and poisons him with his laughing gas. He last appears in the Gotham City Mental Hospital, having been driven insane by the Joker's chemicals. Bochner's [[Lloyd Bochner|father]] was the voice of [[Hamilton Hill (comics)|Mayor Hamilton Hill]] in ''Batman: The Animated Series''.
* [[Stacy Keach]] as Carl Beaumont; Andrea's father, who was secretly in business with the Valestra gang. He goes in debt to Valestra and flees to Europe with Andrea, but is later murdered by Valestra's personal hitman, who would become the Joker. Keach also provided the voice for [[Andrea Beaumont|the "Phantasm" vigilante]].
* [[Abe Vigoda]] as Salvatore Valestra; a powerful crime boss who goes into business with Carl Beaumont, and threatens to kill him for [[Embezzlement|embezzling]] money. Once Andrea returns, he is an old, decrepit man, dependent on an oxygen tank to live due to years of [[smoking]]. He hires the Joker to kill Batman, but the Joker double-crosses him and kills him with Joker venom. Vigoda previously portrayed gangster [[Salvatore Tessio]] in ''[[The Godfather]]'', though his character was a [[caporegime]] rather than the boss.
* [[Mark Hamill]] as [[Joker (comics)|The Joker]]; Batman's nemesis, who was once an assassin for Valestra (and is implied to be responsible for the murder of Carl Beaumont). Valestra hires him to kill Batman, but the Joker kills Valestra instead. Hamill claims he took the opportunity of reprising his role from ''Batman: The Animated Series'' by way of creating new "laughing vocabularies."<ref>{{cite news|author=Jacquie Kubin|title=An Interview With Mark Hamill|publisher=[http://mag.awn.com/ Animation World Magazine]|date=April 1997|url= http://www.awn.com/mag/issue2.1/articles/kubin2.1.html|accessdate= 2008-01-22}}</ref>
* [[Efrem Zimbalist, Jr.]] as [[Alfred Pennyworth]]; once the trusted butler to Bruce Wayne's parents, he continues his loyal service to their son after their deaths. He is Batman's closest confidante.
* [[Robert Costanzo]] as [[Harvey Bullock (comics)|Detective Harvey Bullock]]; a detective with the [[Gotham City Police Department]] who distrusts Batman and is put in charge of the police task force assigned to hunt down the Dark Knight after he is framed for the gangster murders. 
* [[Bob Hastings]] as [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner James Gordon]]; the police commissioner of Gotham City and Batman's closest ally. He refuses to capture Batman, believing the Dark Knight is not responsible for any of the gangster murders.
* [[Dick Miller]] as Charles "Chuckie" Sol; a crime boss and the Phantasm's first victim.
* [[John P. Ryan (actor)|John P. Ryan]] as Buzz Bronski; a crime boss who seems to have had a brief partnership with Chuckie Sol. He is later killed by the Phantasm at the cemetery while visiting Sol's resting place.

Additional voices: [[Jeff Bennett]], [[Ed Gilbert]], [[Marilu Henner]], Charles Howerton, [[Pat Musick]], [[Thom Pinto]], [[Neil Ross]], [[Arleen Sorkin]] and [[Vernee Watson-Johnson]]

==Production==
Impressed by the success of the first season of ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Network]], [[Warner Bros.]] assigned [[Alan Burnett]] to write a story for a full-length animated film. Although the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] does play a pivotal role in the film, it was Burnett's intention to tell a story far removed from the television show's regular [[rogues gallery]]. Burnett also cited he "wanted to do a love story with Bruce because no one had really done it on the TV show. I wanted a story that got into his head."<ref name="Burnett">{{cite book | last = [[Paul Dini]]; [[Chip Kidd]]| title =''[[Batman Animated]]'' | publisher = [[Titan Books]] | year = 1998 | page = 114 | isbn = 1-84023-016-9}}</ref> The writers were highly cautious of placing the Joker in the film as they did not want any connection to [[Tim Burton]]'s 1989 film ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'', but writer [[Michael Reaves]] said, "We then realized that we could make his appearance serve the story in a way that we never could in live-action."<ref name="Animation">{{cite news|author=Joe Tracy|title =Interview with Michael Reaves|publisher=[http://animationartist.digitalmedianet.com/ Animation Artist]|date=|url= http://www.animationartist.com/2000/Interviews/Screenwriters/Michael_Reaves/MReaves.html|accessdate= 2008-01-22| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080211171116/http://www.animationartist.com/2000/Interviews/Screenwriters/Michael_Reaves/MReaves.html| archivedate= 11 February 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Aiding Burnett in writing the script were: [[Martin Pasko]], who handled most of the flashback segments; [[Michael Reaves]], who wrote the [[climax (narrative)|climax]]; and [[Paul Dini]], who claims he "filled in holes here and there."<ref name="Burnett" /> [[Orson Welles]]' 1941 classic ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' served as an influence for the flashbacks, a story about loss and the passage of time.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Les Daniels]]|title=Batman: The Complete History|isbn=0-8118-2470-5|publisher=[[Chronicle Books]]|page=184|year=2000}}</ref>

{{Quote box|width=40%|align=right|quote=“It was basically an expanded episode. We boarded the script and did all of our designs and shipped it overseas.

Early in production, Warner Brothers decided to release ''Phantasm'' with a theatrical release, rather than [[Direct-to-video|straight to video]]. That left less than a year for production time (most animated features take well over two years from finished story to final release). Due to this decision, the animators went over the scenes once more in order to accommodate widescreen theatrical [[aspect ratio]].<ref name="Radomski">Dini, Kidd, p.117</ref> The studio did cooperate well, granting the filmmakers a large amount of creative control.<ref>{{cite news|author=Emru Townsend| title= Paul Dini: From Babs and Buster Bunny to Batman |publisher=''Purple Planet'' Media|date=1999-05-17|url=http://purpleplanetmedia.com/eye/inte/pdini.php|accessdate= 2008-01-22}}</ref>

In addition to the creative control, the studio increased the production budget to $6 million,<ref name="Miller" /> which gave the filmmakers opportunities for more elaborate set pieces. The opening title sequence featured a flight through an entirely [[computer-generated imagery|computer-generated]] [[Gotham City]].<ref name="Burnett" /> As a visual joke, sequence director [[Kevin Altieri]] set the [[climax (narrative)|climax]] of the film inside a miniature automated model of Gotham City, where Batman and the Joker were giants. This was an homage to a mainstay of ''Batman'' comic books of the [[Dick Sprang]] era, often featuring the hero fighting against a backdrop of gigantic props (they would later do another homage to Sprang's works in ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'' episode "Legends of the Dark Knight").<ref name="Radomski" /> From start to finish, the film was completed within eight months.<ref name="Miller" /> Composer [[Shirley Walker]] cited the score of ''Phantasm'' as a favorite among her own compositions.<ref>{{cite news|author=Randall Larson|title=Remembering Shirley Walker|publisher=Mania Music|date=2006-12-07|url=http://www.mania.com/52977.html | accessdate=2008-01-28}}</ref>

==Themes==
[[File:Brucemask.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Bruce Wayne about to don the mask of Batman for the first time.]]
[[Paul Dini]] intended each of the flashbacks into Batman's love life to "have a tendency to get worse, when you hope things will get better." Bruce's relationship with Andrea, which at first shows promise, eventually turns into turmoil.<ref name="turmoil">{{cite news|author=Richard Verrier|title=More That Meets the Eye: Producer-Writer of ''Batman'' Gives All| work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=1996-09-14|url=|accessdate=2008-01-23}}</ref> At first, Bruce and Andrea are set for marriage, but then Bruce is given a farewell note from Andrea cutting off their relationship. This eventually leads into Bruce's decision to become Batman.<ref name="turmoil" /> [[Richard Corliss]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' felt this scene paralleled Andrea's decision to avenge her own parents and reject love, when she finds her own father murdered. Both events transform the two people (Bruce becomes Batman, Andrea becomes the Phantasm).<ref>{{cite news|author=[[Richard Corliss]]| title=Corliss' Roundups of Latest VHS Releases| publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''|date=April 1994|url=|accessdate= 2008-01-23}}</ref>

One scene depicts Bruce Wayne at his parents' tombstone saying "I didn't count on being happy." According to writer [[Michael Reaves]], this scene was to be a pivotal moment in Bruce's tragic life, as he is denied the opportunity to live a normal life.<ref name="Animation" /> Reaves also stated: "When Bruce puts on the mask for the first time, [after Andrea breaks their engagement], and Alfred says 'My God!' he's reacting in horror, because he's watching this man he's helped raise from childhood, this man who has let the desire for vengeance and retribution consume his life, at last embrace the unspeakable."<ref name="Animation" />
