'''''Batman: Mask of the Phantasm''''' is an [[animated film]] first released on December 25, [[1993]].  Although released in the [[Tim Burton]] era, it is completely unrelated with the live-action movies.  It was created by the same cast and crew as ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', having been originally intended as a direct-to-video spin-off from the series.  The cartoon series was initially a marketing tie-in for the [[Batman Returns]] movie.

''Batman: Mask of the Phantasm'' was followed by ''[[SubZero (movie)|SubZero]]'' ([[1998]], featuring [[Mr. Freeze]]) and ''[[Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman]]'' ([[2003]]), both of which were released [[direct-to-video]].

==Plotline==
{{spoiler}}

The film's story divides into two parts: one in the film's "present", and one, told through flashbacks, in the early days of Bruce Wayne's crimefighting career.

Bruce Wayne's fledgeling career faces two major obstacles: first, he is having trouble getting criminals to take him seriously at first sight (not having yet hit upon the bat motif); second, he has fallen in love.  The recipient of his affections is Andrea Beaumont, red-haired and blue-eyed, not only beautiful but seemingly his equal in every way.  Realizing that an ongoing relationship with Andrea would massively complicate his crusade against crime, Bruce decides that one of them has to go.  After a long internal struggle, the crusade loses.  Bruce proposes to Andrea, and she accepts.  The next day, however, Andrea sends her engagement ring back with a note telling Bruce to forget her, and leaves the country.  Devastated, Bruce throws himself back into crimefighting, discovers a large bat-haunted cavern in his backyard, and becomes the [[Batman]].

In the present, a mysterious cloaked figure is stalking and killing [[Gotham City]] mob bosses. The murders are the work of a new vigilante, the Phantasm,who resembles the [[Grim Reaper]], but many attribute them to Batman, who becomes the target of a police manhunt.  The situation becomes complicated when Andrea Beaumont returns to Gotham, forcing Bruce Wayne to deal with the feelings he still has for her.  Things are further complicated when Batman discovers that the link between the slain mob bosses is Andrea's now-deceased father, who had business dealings with all of them before his mysterious death.  Also present is [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]], who in the days before his life-changing accident worked for one of the mob bosses.  Not only is he the last of the Phantasm's targets, but also the last man still living in Gotham who can explain what the Phantasm is up to.  Batman traces the Joker to his hideout, the abandoned site of the Gotham World's Fair, to get answers.

And get them he does.  The Joker may be the last man who understands the Phantasm's crusade, but one woman does as well: Andrea Beaumont, who ''is'' the Phantasm; she has returned to Gotham City to complete her vengeance against her father's murderers, the last of which is Napier, the man who actually did the deed.  She finally catches him as the fair grounds begin to crumble in flame around them.  Wayne invites her to return with him, but she refuses, keeping ahold of the struggling Joker to prevent his escape; Batman gets out of the park through the sewer just before it explodes.  As the movie closes, Bruce, now permanently alone, returns to his crime fighting ways; while, at the Gotham harbors, a cruise liner pulls away, carrying on it Andrea, a sad expression on her face.

==Critical Reaction==
The movie was extremely well received by fans of ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', and earned a positive review from almost every critic.  For instance, [[film critic]]s [[Siskel & Ebert]], while regretting that they originally ignored the film in its initial release, gave the film a two-thumbs up, the only ''[[Batman]]'' film to be given such praise until ''[[Batman Begins]]''.  [[Rotten Tomatoes]] lists it as having 11 positive reviews out of 11 posted, as well as earning a 100% rating.  It has since become a [[cult classic]].

In addition, many fans and critics believe that it makes the first four live-action ''[[Batman]]'' movies (''[[Batman (1989 movie)|Batman]]'', ''[[Batman Returns]]'', ''[[Batman Forever]]'', and ''[[Batman & Robin]]'') look embarrassing, especially the latter two. Some have even gone so far as to say that it was the first Batman film to actually star Batman instead of his villains.

==Box Office==
Despite all the positive reviews the movie got, it was a huge failure at the box office.  It barely grossed $5 million domestically and $11 million worldwide, and due to its low earnings, most theatres stopped showing it after only one or two weeks.  Due to the film's failure, all future animated [[Batman]] movies were released [[direct-to-video]].
However, when the film was released to video on [[April 26]], [[1994]], it succeeded in turning a profit, earning millions more than in its limited theatrical release.

==Trivia==
The storyline of ''Mask of the Phantasm'' utilises elements of the comic ''Batman: Year Two'', although it creates a very different story out of them. The Phantasm was based on a Year Two villain known as the Reaper. 

The Phantasm has also appeared in ''[[Batman Adventures]]'', the comic based on the ''Batman'' animated series, in which she goes undercover in [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]]'s organisation, the False Face Society. The story arc ends on an open note suggesting the possibility of a further return, which would presumably have clarified her motives in pursuing the False Face Society, but the cancellation of the title prevented this from occurring.

Due to the much more relaxed standards and practices of a motion picture, Timm and company could get away with more violence than on TV.  Therefore, the film marks the first time the [[DCAU]]'s [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] was actually allowed to kill somebody, a crime lord via laughing gas and the Phantasm's father. 

{{spoiler-about|[[Justice League Unlimited]]}}

In the last episode of the second season of ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' (titled "Epilogue"), the Phantasm is shown to have attempted to kill the parents of Terry McGinnis at the request of [[Amanda Waller]], in order for her to carry out the [[Batman Beyond]] project.  The Phantasm cannot do it, arguing to Waller that to honor the Batman legacy would mean respecting the superhero's principles.
