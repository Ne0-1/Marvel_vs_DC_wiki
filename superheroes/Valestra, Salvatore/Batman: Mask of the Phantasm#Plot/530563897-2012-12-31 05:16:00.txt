'''''Batman: Mask of the Phantasm''''' (also known as '''''Batman: The Animated Movie''''') is a 1993 American [[Animation|animated]] [[superhero film|superhero]] [[mystery film]] based on the [[DC Comics]] character [[Batman]], more specifically the 1990s ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''. As with ''The Animated Series'', the film stars [[Kevin Conroy]] as the voice of Batman, as well as the voices of [[Mark Hamill]], [[Dana Delany]], [[Hart Bochner]], [[Stacy Keach]], [[Abe Vigoda]] and [[Efrem Zimbalist, Jr.]] The film's storyline introduces [[Andrea Beaumont]], an old [[Romantic interest|love interest]] of Bruce Wayne's, who returns to [[Gotham City]], restarting their romance. At the same time, a new mysterious vigilante begins systematically eliminating Gotham's [[crime boss]]es, and due to the person's dark appearance, he is mistaken for Batman. Now on the run from the police, the Dark Knight must apprehend the killer, clear his name, and deal with the romance between him and Andrea.

The film was distributed by [[Warner Bros.]], directed by [[Bruce Timm]] and [[Eric Radomski]] (the creators of ''The Animated Series'') and written by [[Alan Burnett]], [[Paul Dini]], [[Michael Reaves]] and [[Martin Pasko]]. The original idea was to release the film as [[direct-to-video]], but the studio decided for a theatrical release, giving the filmmakers a strenuous eight-month schedule. ''Mask of the Phantasm'' received widespread acclaim from critics, who praised the film for its animation style, dialogue and acting, but it was a [[box office bomb]] due to the decision to release the film in theaters on such short notice. The film has since found cult success through its various [[VHS]] and [[DVD]] releases.

==Plot==
During a conference of crime bosses held in a [[Gotham City]] skyscraper, gangster Chuckie Sol is killed by a mysterious cloaked figure shortly after [[Batman]] bursts in on the meeting. Batman is blamed for Sol's death. Councilman Arthur Reeves tells the media that Batman is a public menace, then attends a party at the mansion of billionaire Bruce Wayne, Batman's alter ego. Reeves teases Bruce about his bad luck with women and for having allowed an old girlfriend, [[Andrea Beaumont]], to get away.

In a flashback to ten years ago, during Bruce's college days, Bruce meets Andrea in a cemetery while visiting his parents' grave. That night, in one of his first crime-fighting attempts, Bruce foils an armored car robbery while disguised in a black ski-mask and leather jacket. Though he succeeds, he is discouraged that the criminals did not fear him. Around the same time, he begins a romance with Andrea. Eventually, Bruce decides to abandon his plan to become a crime-fighting vigilante and proposes marriage to Andrea. Soon afterward, however, Andrea mysteriously leaves Gotham with her father, Carl Beaumont, ending her engagement to Bruce in a [[Dear John letter]]. Believing that he has lost his only chance of having a normal life, Bruce finally dons the mask of Batman.

In the present, the killer finds and kills another gangster, Buzz Bronski. Around the same time, Batman discovers that Andrea has returned to Gotham. Batman soon discovers evidence linking Andrea's father with a number of [[organized crime|mobsters]]. The killer later targets Salvatore Valestra, the mob boss for whom both Sol and Bronski once worked as enforcers. Desperate, Valestra turns to [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]] for help. The killer tries to eliminate Valestra, but finds the gangster dead, his face disfigured with [[Joker venom]]; the house then explodes, with the killer barely escaping. Batman pursues the killer, but is interrupted by the police, who believe that Batman is responsible for the murders. Andrea rescues Batman in her car, and they spend the night together at [[Wayne Manor]]. Andrea explains to Bruce that she and her father had been hiding in [[Europe]] from the Valestra mob, to whom he owed a lot of money. Carl Beaumont eventually repaid them, but they wanted "[[Interest rate|interest]] [[blood debt|compounded in blood]]." Batman believes that Andrea's father may be the killer, but soon gets Reeves (who has been poisoned by the Joker with [[Joker venom]]) to confess that he told the mob where Beaumont was hiding in return for campaign contributions, and that the mob ordered Beaumont's death.

The killer tracks the Joker to his hideout &mdash; a miniaturized replica of Gotham City in an abandoned amusement park &mdash; and removes the ominous costume: The killer is Andrea, intent on avenging her father's death. The Joker is also revealed to be the last surviving member of the Valestra mob; before his fateful first encounter with Batman, he was an unnamed hitman who personally murdered Carl Beaumont on Valestra's orders. Batman arrives and saves Andrea from the Joker, and begs Andrea to give up her quest for revenge. She refuses, stating that the mob ruined any chance she had at happiness; she then tells Batman that he himself is driven by revenge. Andrea vanishes and Batman battles with the Joker, a struggle that ends in stalemate. Moments later, Andrea reappears and seizes the Joker, bidding Batman goodbye before vanishing with the the maniacally laughing [[supervillain]] in a cloud of smoke. The model city (and the entire amusement park) erupts in a series of rigged explosions, which Batman barely escapes by falling into a waterway and being swept away to safety by the current.

Back in the [[Batcave]], [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]] consoles a heartbroken Bruce, telling him that no one could have helped Andrea. Bruce finds a locket containing a picture of himself and Andrea in the cave. Meanwhile, Andrea is shown standing alone on the deck of a departing [[ocean liner]]. In the final scene, Batman stands alone on the top of a Gotham building; when the [[Bat-Signal]] appears in the sky, he swings off into the night to continue his war on crime.

==Production==
Impressed by the success of the first season of ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Network]], [[Warner Bros.]] assigned [[Alan Burnett]] to write a story for a full-length animated film. Although the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] does play a pivotal role in the film, it was Burnett's intention to tell a story far removed from the television show's regular [[rogues gallery]]. Burnett also cited he "wanted to do a love story with Bruce because no one had really done it on the TV show. I wanted a story that got into his head."<ref name="Burnett">{{cite book | last = [[Paul Dini]]; [[Chip Kidd]]| title =''[[Batman Animated]]'' | publisher = [[Titan Books]] | year = 1998 | page = 114 | isbn = 1-84023-016-9}}</ref> The writers were highly cautious of placing the Joker in the film as they did not want any connection to [[Tim Burton]]'s 1989 film ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'', but writer [[Michael Reaves]] said, "We then realized that we could make his appearance serve the story in a way that we never could in live-action."<ref name="Animation">{{cite news|author=Joe Tracy|title =Interview with Michael Reaves|publisher=[http://animationartist.digitalmedianet.com/ Animation Artist]|date=|url= http://www.animationartist.com/2000/Interviews/Screenwriters/Michael_Reaves/MReaves.html|accessdate= 2008-01-22| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080211171116/http://www.animationartist.com/2000/Interviews/Screenwriters/Michael_Reaves/MReaves.html| archivedate= 11 February 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Aiding Burnett in writing the script were: [[Martin Pasko]], who handled most of the flashback segments; [[Michael Reaves]], who wrote the [[climax (narrative)|climax]]; and [[Paul Dini]], who claims he "filled in holes here and there."<ref name="Burnett" /> ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941) served as an influence for the flashbacks, a story about loss and the passage of time.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Les Daniels]]|title=Batman: The Complete History|isbn=0-8118-2470-5|publisher=[[Chronicle Books]]|page=184|year=2000}}</ref>

Early in production, Warner Brothers decided to release ''Phantasm'' with a theatrical release, rather than [[Direct-to-video|straight to video]]. That left less than a year for production time (most animated features take well over two years from finished story to final release). Due to this decision, the animators went over the scenes once more in order to accommodate widescreen theatrical [[aspect ratio]].<ref name="Radomski">Dini, Kidd, p.117</ref> The studio did cooperate well, granting the filmmakers a large amount of creative control.<ref>{{cite news|author=Emru Townsend| title= Paul Dini: From Babs and Buster Bunny to Batman |publisher=''Purple Planet'' Media|date=1999-05-17|url=http://purpleplanetmedia.com/eye/inte/pdini.php|accessdate= 2008-01-22}}</ref>

In addition to the creative control, the studio increased the production budget to $6 million,<ref name="Miller" /> which gave the filmmakers opportunities for more elaborate set pieces. The opening title sequence featured a flight through an entirely [[computer-generated imagery|computer-generated]] [[Gotham City]].<ref name="Burnett" /> As a visual joke, sequence director [[Kevin Altieri]] set the [[climax (narrative)|climax]] of the film inside a miniature automated model of Gotham City, where Batman and the Joker were giants. This was a homage to a mainstay of ''Batman'' comic books of the [[Dick Sprang]] era, often featuring the hero fighting against a backdrop of gigantic props.<ref name="Radomski" /> From start to finish, the film was completed within eight months.<ref name="Miller" /> Composer [[Shirley Walker]] cited the score of ''Phantasm'' as a favorite among her own compositions.<ref>{{cite news|author=Randall Larson|title=Remembering Shirley Walker|publisher=Mania Music|date=2006-12-07|url=http://www.mania.com/52977.html | accessdate=2008-01-28}}</ref>

==Themes==
[[File:Brucemask.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Bruce about to don the mask of Batman for the first time. The plot point emphasizes Bruce Wayne's dual-identity as Batman]]
[[Paul Dini]] intended each of the flashbacks into Batman's love life to "have a tendency to get worse, when you hope things will get better." Bruce's relationship with [[Andrea Beaumont|Andrea]], which at first shows promise, eventually turns into turmoil.<ref name="turmoil">{{cite news|author=Richard Verrier|title=More That Meets the Eye: Producer-Writer of ''Batman'' Gives All| work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=1996-09-14|url=|accessdate=2008-01-23}}</ref> At first, Bruce and Andrea are set for marriage, but then Bruce is given a farewell note from Andrea cutting off their relationship. This eventually leads into Bruce's decision to become Batman.<ref name="turmoil" /> [[Richard Corliss]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' felt this scene paralleled Andrea's decision to avenge her own parents and reject love, when she finds her own father Carl dead by the hands of an assassin. Both events transform the two people (Bruce becomes Batman, Andrea becomes the Phantasm).<ref>{{cite news|author=[[Richard Corliss]]| title=Corliss' Roundups of Latest VHS Releases| publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''|date=April 1994|url=|accessdate= 2008-01-23}}</ref>

One scene depicts Bruce Wayne at his parents' tombstone saying "I didn't count on being happy." According to writer [[Michael Reaves]], this scene was to be a pivotal moment in Bruce's tragic life, as he is denied the opportunity to live a normal life.<ref name="Animation" /> Reaves also stated: "When Bruce puts on the mask for the first time, [after Andrea breaks their engagement], and Alfred says 'My God!' he's reacting in horror, because he's watching this man he's helped raise from childhood, this man who has let the desire for vengeance and retribution consume his life, at last embrace the unspeakable."<ref name="Animation" />
