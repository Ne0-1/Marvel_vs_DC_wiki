'''''Batman: Mask of the Phantasm''''' is a 1993 American [[Animation|animated]] [[superhero film]] featuring the [[DC Comics]] character [[Batman]]. Directed by [[Eric Radomski]] and [[Bruce Timm]], it is a cinematic stand-alone continuation of ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' and the first original theatrical film produced by [[Warner Bros. Animation]].

The film was written by [[Alan Burnett]], [[Paul Dini]], [[Martin Pasko]], and [[Michael Reaves]]. [[Kevin Conroy]], [[Mark Hamill]], [[Efrem Zimbalist Jr.]], [[Bob Hastings]] and [[Robert Costanzo]] reprise their roles from ''The Animated Series'', joined by [[Dana Delany]], [[Hart Bochner]], [[Stacy Keach, Jr.]], [[Abe Vigoda]], [[Dick Miller]] and [[John P. Ryan]]. Its story follows Batman as he reconciles with a former lover, [[Andrea Beaumont]], and faces a mysterious vigilante who is murdering [[Gotham City]]'s crime bosses, who all indirectly linked to Batman's beginning of his crimefighting crusade. The plot was inspired by [[Mike W. Barr]]'s ''[[Batman: Year Two]]'' comic book [[story arc]], but features an original antagonist, the Phantasm, in place of the [[Reaper (DC Comics)|Reaper]], it also borrowed elements from ''[[Batman: Year One]]'' comic book.

Originally planned for a [[direct-to-video]] release, [[Warner Bros.]] gave ''Mask of the Phantasm'' a theatrical release, condensing its production into a strenuous eight-month schedule. The film was released through the studio's [[Warner Bros. Family Entertainment|Family Entertainment]]<ref name="afi" /> division on December 24, 1993, to positive reviews from critics, who praised the stylized animation, voice performances, story, and music.

Due to the decision to release it in theaters on short notice, ''Mask of the Phantasm'' [[Box office bomb|failed at the box office]]. After its release on home video, it became financially successful. Its success led to two direct-to-video standalone [[sequel]]s, ''[[Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero]]'' in 1998 and ''[[Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman|Mystery of the Batwoman]]'' in 2003. Until the limited release of ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke (film)|Batman: The Killing Joke]]'' in 2016, ''Mask of the Phantasm'' was the only animated ''Batman'' film to be given a theatrical release.

==Plot==
A young Bruce Wayne meets [[Andrea Beaumont]] while visiting his parents' grave, and they form a deep mutual attraction. That night, in one of his first crime-fighting attempts, Bruce foils an armored car robbery, but is discouraged because the criminals did not fear him. Bruce proposes marriage to Andrea, who accepts. However, Andrea mysteriously leaves Gotham with her father, businessman Carl Beaumont, ending her engagement in a [[Dear John letter]]. Heartbroken, Bruce becomes [[Batman]] over the course of ten years.

Batman confronts a group of [[Gotham City]] [[Organized crime|crime bosses]] led by Chuckie Sol, who are intending to [[money laundering|launder]] millions of [[Counterfeit money|counterfeit dollars]] in a casino. As Sol escapes to his car, a cloaked figure attacks him; Sol is killed when the figure causes him to drive out the side of a parking garage and crash into a neighboring building. Batman is seen immediately afterwards, and is blamed for killing Sol. Councilman Arthur Reeves, who is corrupt and on Sol's cabal's payroll, publicly antagonizes Batman, vowing to have him arrested, despite oppositions from Commissioner James Gordon and some of the city's citizens.

The cloaked figure murders another gangster, Buzz Bronski, in the same cemetery Bruce met Andrea. Buzz's bodyguards see the same mysterious figure flee the scene and presume it is Batman. Batman investigates Bronski's death and wanders to his parents' tombstone, encountering Andrea. She is startled by Batman's appearance and realizes who he is. Batman finds evidence linking Carl Beaumont with Sol, Bronski and a third gangster: Salvatore Valestra. He breaks into Valestra's home and finds a picture of Bronski, Valestra, Sol and Beaumont seated at a table. When he visits Andrea to get more answers she rebuffs him. Meanwhile, Valestra, believing Batman killed the others and will come for him, turns to Reeves, who rebuffs him, figuring he is a now an aged, powerless gangster. Valestra then contacts his former assassin, [[Joker (character)|the Joker]] for help.

The figure arrives at Valestra's house but finds the gangster dead by Joker's hands, and through a camera strapped to Valestra's corpse, Joker sees the murderer is not Batman. The figure escapes as the house explodes. Batman pursues and fights the killer, but is interrupted by the police and rescued from arrest by Andrea. Andrea later explains she and her father had been hiding in Europe from Valestra's mob, from whom he had [[embezzlement|embezzled]] money; her father repaid everything, but they put out a [[Contract killing|hit]] for his death anyway. Bruce now believes that her father is the killer. Bruce ponders resuming his relationship with Andrea and giving up Batman. Looking at the photo of Bronski, Valestra, Sol and Beaumont, he sees Valestra's chauffeur in the background; Bruce realizes to his horror the chauffeur is actually the man who would become the Joker. Joker visits Reeves to press him for information about the killer; Reeves insists the killer is Batman, but Joker, believing Reeves is the killer, states Reeves needs to protect his reputation and poisons him. Reeves is taken to the hospital where Batman later breaks in and interrogates him. Reeves confesses he helped the Beaumonts escape, but later betrayed their location to Valestra's mob after Carl declined to help fund his first election campaign.  At this point, both Batman and the Joker have now deduced the cloaked killer is Andrea.

Andrea tracks Joker to his hideout in order to kill her last target. Joker fights her, but before he can kill Andrea, Batman arrives and begs Andrea to give up her quest. She refuses and disappears. After Batman and the Joker battle to a stalemate, with the amusement park about to be blown up, Andrea returns and seizes Joker, bidding Batman goodbye before vanishing with the maniacally laughing clown, and Batman barely escapes the explosions. [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]] later consoles Bruce, telling him no one could have helped Andrea. Bruce finds her locket, containing a picture of himself and Andrea, in the [[Batcave]]. Meanwhile, Andrea departs from Gotham on an ocean liner, feeling completely lost. Heartbroken again, Batman resumes his crimefighting duties after the accusations against him is cleared.

==Voice cast==

* [[Mark Hamill]] as [[Joker (character)|The Joker]]:<br> Once an assassin for Valestra (and directly responsible for the murder of Carl Beaumont) who later hideously transformed into his more recognizable appearance and becomes Batman's archnemesis. Valestra hires him to kill Batman, and is later killed by him. Hamill claims he took the opportunity of reprising his role from ''[[Batman: The Animated Series|The Animated Series]]'' by way of creating new "laughing vocabularies".<ref>{{cite news|author=Jacquie Kubin|title=An Interview With Mark Hamill|publisher=Animation World Magazine|date=April 1997|url= http://www.awn.com/mag/issue2.1/articles/kubin2.1.html|access-date= January 22, 2008}}</ref>
* [[Dana Delany]] as [[Andrea Beaumont|Andrea Beaumont / The Phantasm]]:<br> A woman Bruce meets in the early years of his return to Gotham after traveling the world. The decision to propose to her in marriage leads to him abandoning his plans for becoming a vigilante. However, after she unexpectedly and mysteriously leaves, Bruce's heartbreak and anger leads to his becoming Batman. Delany's voice performance in the film impressed the filmmakers, leading to her casting as [[Lois Lane]] in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]''.<ref>{{cite news|author=Barry Freiman|title=Exclusive Interview with Dana Delany|publisher=Superman Homepage|date=June 14, 2005|url= http://www.supermanhomepage.com/tv/tv.php?topic=interviews/dana-delany|access-date=January 28, 2008}}</ref>  Stacy Keach (who also voices Carl Beaumont) provided the voice for The Phantasm while masked. 
* [[Hart Bochner]] as Arthur Reeves:<br> A corrupt city official who was once an intern for Carl Beaumont (before "selling his name to the mob"). He later becomes involved with Valestra's gang (even put it to good or at least not-so-good use), and is poisoned by The Joker, but the toxin is incomplete and not fatal due to Joker being interrupted. His last appearance is at the Gotham City Mental Hospital, recovering from the effect of exposure to the Joker's poisonous chemicals.
* [[Stacy Keach]] as Carl Beaumont:<br> Andrea's father and a wealthy businessman who made deals with the Valestra gang. He goes in debt to Valestra and flees to Europe with Andrea in order to escape the latter's wrath, but is later murdered by Valestra's assassin. Keach also provided the voice for the Phantasm.
* [[Abe Vigoda]] as Salvatore "The Wheezer" Valestra:<br> A powerful crime boss who practically forces Carl Beaumont to leave. Once Andrea returns, he's nearly dying with the effects of respiratory difficulties and uses an oxygen tank to stabilize his health. Fearing his death due to the murders of other crime bosses, he hires The Joker to kill Batman. In the end, he himself is killed by The Joker. He dies without learning the full story; that Batman was not responsible for the earlier deaths, which Joker deduces afterwards.
* [[Dick Miller]] as Charles "Chuckie" Sol:<br> A crime boss who falls as the first victim to The Phantasm. Originally a lieutenant to Valestra, he later started his own gang and owned a [[casino]] as a front.
* [[John P. Ryan]] as Buzz Bronski:<br> A crime boss who seemed to have had a brief partnership with Chuckie Sol whom Buzz always considered a loser. He is later killed by The Phantasm at the graveyard while visiting Sol's grave.

* [[Jeff Bennett]] Additional voices as first and second Burglar, Biker, Cop in helicopter, Cop on radio, SWAT team member, and Man on ship.

==Production==
Impressed by the success of the first season of ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], [[Warner Bros.]] assigned Alan Burnett to write a story for a full-length animated film. The original idea for the film was to have Batman being captured by his enemies at [[Arkham Asylum]] and be put on a trial by them, as they wanted to show that he was guilty of making them what they had become. The idea's concept, however, was considered "too brainy", as it required Batman to be immobile for a long time, so the idea was later used in the series' episode "Trial", which was aired after the movie's release.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/batman-mask-of-the-phantasm-animated-movie-facts-trivia/|title=15 Things You Didn't Know About Batman: Mask Of The Phantasm|date=February 1, 2017|website=Screenrant.com|access-date=June 4, 2018}}</ref> Although the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] does play a pivotal role in the film, it was Burnett's intention to tell a story far removed from the television show's regular [[rogues gallery]]. Burnett also cited he "wanted to do a love story with Bruce because no one had really done it on the TV show. I wanted a story that got into his head."<ref name="Burnett">{{cite book |author1= Paul Dini |author2-link=Chip Kidd |author2=Chip Kidd | title =''Batman Animated'' | publisher = [[Titan Books]] | year = 1998 | page = 114 | isbn = 978-1-84023-016-1| title-link =Batman Animated |author1-link=Paul Dini }}</ref> In reality, the creative team had said that they originally didn't want to use the Joker in the film. Conversely, [[Paul Dini]] stated that the Joker was always part of the film from the beginning of its production.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Paul_Dini/status/900566977831239680|title=Paul_Dini on Twitter|publisher=[[Twitter]]|access-date=June 4, 2018}}</ref> The writers were highly cautious of placing the Joker in the film as they did not want any connection to [[Tim Burton]]'s 1989 film ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'', but writer Michael Reaves said, "We then realized that we could make his appearance serve the story in a way that we never could in live-action."<ref name="Animation">{{cite news|author=Joe Tracy|title =Interview with Michael Reaves|publisher=Animation Artist|url= http://www.animationartist.com/2000/Interviews/Screenwriters/Michael_Reaves/MReaves.html|access-date= January 22, 2008| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080211171116/http://www.animationartist.com/2000/Interviews/Screenwriters/Michael_Reaves/MReaves.html| archive-date= February 11, 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> In order to keep the Joker as a solo threat, [[Bruce Timm]] and Burnett convinced frequent ''Animated Series'' writer [[Paul Dini]] to not use [[Harley Quinn]] in the film for that reason. The same technique was previously  used in the episodes "Joker's Wild" and "The Strange Secret of Bruce Wayne".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://issuu.com/twomorrows/docs/backissue99preview|title=Back Issue #99|website=Issuu.com|access-date=June 4, 2018}}</ref>

Aiding Burnett in writing the script were [[Martin Pasko]], who handled most of the flashback segments; Reaves, who wrote the [[climax (narrative)|climax]]; and Dini, who claims he "filled in holes here and there".<ref name="Burnett" /> The film's plot was heavily influenced by the 1987 miniseries ''[[Batman: Year Two]]'', written by [[Mike W. Barr]] and illustrated by [[Alan Davis]], [[Paul Neary]], [[Alfredo Alcala]], [[Mark Farmer]] and [[Todd McFarlane]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Chris Sims|title =Ask Chris #92: The Great and Terrible 'Batman: Year Two'|publisher=[[Comics Alliance]]|date=February 3, 2012|url=http://comicsalliance.com/ask-chris-batman-year-two/?trackback=tsmclip|accessdate= June 14, 2017| url-status= live}}</ref> [[Orson Welles]]' 1941 classic ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' served as an influence for the flashbacks, a story about loss and the passage of time.<ref>{{cite book|author=Les Daniels|title=Batman: The Complete History|isbn=978-0-8118-2470-5|publisher=[[Chronicle Books]]|page=184|year=2000|author-link=Les Daniels}}</ref> The character of Hazel, the cook robot of the World of the Future Fair, was named by Burnett after Hazel the Maid (portrayed by actress [[Shirley Booth]]), ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' protagonist of cartoonist [[Ted Key]]'s TV show ''[[Hazel (TV series)|Hazel]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Paul_Dini/status/902309884657524738|title=Paul_Dini on Twitter|publisher=[[Twitter]]|access-date=June 4, 2018}}</ref> On the other hand, the design of the Phantasm went into 20 different versions until one was found which convinced the film's crew. According to Burnett, the Phantasm was like the [[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]] with a cape, although the idea was to make him resemble the [[Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come|Ghost of Christmas Future]] of [[Charles Dickens]]' novel ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydv8TS2wids|title=The Making Of Batman Mask of The Phantasm|last=Living Abstraction|date=September 11, 2015|access-date=June 4, 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> something that even the Joker mentions in the finished version of the film. 
{{Quote box|width=40%|align=right|quote=“It was basically an expanded episode. We boarded the script and did all of our designs and shipped it overseas.

Early in production, Warner Bros. decided to release ''Phantasm'' theatrically, rather than [[Direct-to-video|straight to video]]. That left less than a year for production time (most animated features take well over two years from finished story to final release). Due to this decision, the animators went over the scenes in order to accommodate the widescreen theatrical [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]].<ref name="Radomski">Dini, Kidd, p.117</ref> The studio cooperated well, granting the filmmakers a large amount of creative control.<ref>{{cite news|author=Emru Townsend|title=Paul Dini: From Babs and Buster Bunny to Batman|publisher=Purple Planet Media|date=May 17, 1999|url=http://purpleplanetmedia.com/eye/inte/pdini.php|access-date=January 22, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726212141/http://purpleplanetmedia.com/eye/inte/pdini.php|archive-date=July 26, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Warner Bros. also increased the production budget to $6 million,<ref name="Miller" /> which gave the filmmakers opportunities for more elaborate set pieces. The opening title sequence featured a flight through an entirely [[computer-generated imagery|computer-generated]] [[Gotham City]].<ref name="Burnett" /> As a visual joke, sequence director [[Kevin Altieri]] set the [[climax (narrative)|climax]] of the film inside a miniature automated model of Gotham City, where Batman and the Joker were giants. This was an homage to a mainstay of ''Batman'' comic books of the [[Dick Sprang]] era, often featuring the hero fighting against a backdrop of gigantic props (they would later do another homage to Sprang's works in ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'' episode "Legends of the Dark Knight").<ref name="Radomski" /> From start to finish, the film was completed within eight months.<ref name="Miller" />

==Themes==
Paul Dini intended each of the flashbacks into Batman's love life to "have a tendency to get worse, when you hope things will get better." Bruce's relationship with Andrea, which at first shows promise, eventually turns into turmoil.<ref name="turmoil">{{cite news|author=Richard Verrier|title=More That Meets the Eye: Producer-Writer of ''Batman'' Gives All| work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=September 14, 1996}}</ref> At first, Bruce and Andrea are set for marriage, but then Bruce is given a farewell note from Andrea cutting off their relationship. This eventually leads into Bruce's decision to become Batman.<ref name="turmoil" /> [[Richard Corliss]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' felt this scene paralleled Andrea's decision to avenge her own parents and reject love when she finds her own father murdered. Both events transform the two people (Bruce becomes Batman, Andrea becomes the Phantasm).<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Richard Corliss| title=Corliss' Roundups of Latest VHS Releases| magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=April 1994| author-link=Richard Corliss}}</ref> One scene depicts Bruce Wayne at his parents' tombstone saying "I didn't count on being happy." According to Reaves, this scene was to be a pivotal moment in Bruce's tragic life, as he denies himself the opportunity to live a normal life.<ref name="Animation" /> Reaves also stated: "When Bruce puts on the mask for the first time, [after Andrea breaks their engagement], and Alfred says 'My God!' he's reacting in horror, because he's watching this man he's helped raise from childhood, this man who has let the desire for vengeance and retribution consume his life, at last embrace the unspeakable."<ref name="Animation" />

The soundtrack was composed by [[Shirley Walker]], the main composer for ''The Animated Series''.
