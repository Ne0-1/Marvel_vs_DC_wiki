}}
'''''Batman: Mask of the Phantasm''''' is a 1993 American [[Animation|animated]] [[superhero film]] featuring the [[DC Comics]] character [[Batman]]. Directed by [[Eric Radomski]] and [[Bruce Timm]], it is a cinematic continuation of ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''. It is also the first original theatrical film produced by [[Warner Bros. Animation]].

The film was written by [[Alan Burnett]], [[Paul Dini]], [[Martin Pasko]] and [[Michael Reaves]] and stars the [[Voice acting|vocal talents]] of [[Kevin Conroy]], [[Mark Hamill]] and [[Efrem Zimbalist, Jr.]] (all reprising their roles from ''The Animated Series''), in addition to [[Dana Delany]], [[Hart Bochner]], [[Stacy Keach]], and [[Abe Vigoda]]. Its story follows Batman as he deals with his reconciliation with a former lover, [[Andrea Beaumont]], and pits him against a mysterious vigilante who is murdering Gotham City's [[crime boss]]es. The film's plotline was inspired by [[Mike W. Barr]]'s ''[[Batman: Year Two]]'' comic book [[story arc]], but features an original antagonist, the titular Phantasm, in place of [[Reaper (DC Comics)|The Reaper]].

Originally planned for a [[direct-to-video]] release, [[Warner Bros.]] ultimately decided to give ''Mask of the Phantasm'' a theatrical release, condensing its production into a strenuous eight-month schedule. The film was released through the studio's [[Warner Bros. Family Entertainment|Family Entertainment]] division on December 25, 1993 to positive reviews from critics, who praised the voice performances, storyline and music. However, due to the decision to release it in theaters on short notice, ''Mask of the Phantasm'' [[Box office bomb|failed]] at the [[box office]].

After its release on home video, the film became critically successful. Its eventual success led to two direct-to-video standalone [[sequel]]s, ''[[Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero]]'' in 1998 and ''[[Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman|Mystery of the Batwoman]]'' in 2003. Until the limited release of ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke (film)|Batman: The Killing Joke]]'' in 2016, ''Mask of the Phantasm'' was the only animated ''Batman'' film to be given a theatrical release.

==Plot==
<!-- word count should be between 400 and 700 per WP:FILMPLOT -->
''The film is presented in a [[nonlinear narrative]], jumping between the present and [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] to the past. This is a linear summary of the plot.''

A young Bruce Wayne meets [[Andrea Beaumont]] while visiting his parents' grave, and they form a deep mutual attraction. That night, in one of his first crime-fighting attempts, Bruce foils an armored car robbery, but is discouraged because the criminals did not fear him. Eventually, Bruce decides to abandon his plans to become a [[vigilante]] and proposes marriage to Andrea. However, Andrea mysteriously leaves Gotham with her father, businessman Carl Beaumont, ending her engagement in a [[Dear John letter|"Dear John" letter]]. Believing he has lost his last chance of having a normal life, Bruce becomes [[Batman]].

Ten years later, Batman confronts a group of [[Gotham City]] [[Organized crime|crime bosses]] led by Chuckie Sol, who are intending to [[money laundering|launder]] millions of [[Counterfeit money|counterfeit dollars]] in a casino. As Sol escapes to his car, a cloaked figure attacks him; Sol is killed when the figure causes him to drive out the side of a parking garage and crash into a neighboring building. Batman arrives soon after, and bystanders blame him for Sol's death. Councilman Arthur Reeves tells the media that Batman is a menace (despite [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]]'s protests). Attending a party at Wayne Manor, Reeves teases Bruce for allowing Andrea to leave him.

The cloaked figure murders another gangster, Buzz Bronski, in the same cemetery Bruce met Andrea. Batman investigates Bronski's death and wanders to his parents' tombstone. He overhears Andrea talking at her mother's grave, just as she had been when he first met her. She is startled by Batman's appearance and he flees. Batman finds evidence linking Carl Beaumont with Sol, Bronski and a third gangster: Salvatore Valestra. He breaks into Valestra's home and discovers a photograph of Bronski, Valestra, Sol and Beaumont seated at a table. When he visits Andrea to try to get more answers she rebuffs him, intimating she now knows his identity. Meanwhile, Valestra believes Batman killed the others and will come for him, so he turns to [[Joker (character)|the Joker]] for help.

The figure arrives at Valestra's house but finds the gangster dead by Joker's hands. Joker has strapped a camera to Valestra's corpse and sees the murderer is not Batman. The figure escapes as the house explodes. Batman pursues and fights the killer, but is interrupted by the police and rescued from arrest by Andrea. Andrea later explains she and her father had been hiding in Europe from Valestra's mob, from whom he had [[embezzlement|embezzled]] money; her father repaid everything, but they put out a hit on him anyway. Bruce now believes her father is the killer. Bruce ponders resuming his relationship with Andrea and giving up Batman. He notices a familiar-looking man in the background of the photo of Bronski, Valestra, Sol and Beaumont: the man who would become the Joker. Joker visits Reeves to press him for information; Reeves insists that the killer is Batman, but Joker, believing Reeves is the killer, states Reeves needs to protect his own reputation and poisons him. Reeves is taken to the hospital where Batman later breaks in and interrogates him. Reeves confesses he helped the Beaumonts escape, but later told Valestra's mob Carl's location when Carl refused to help fund his first election campaign, leading Batman to realize who the killer truly is.

The cloaked figure tracks Joker to his hideout, where Joker reveals that he has also deduced that the killer is Andrea, intent on avenging her father's death by killing every last surviving member of Valestra's mob. With the others dead, Joker is the last one alive, and is the one who carried out the hit on her father. Joker fights her, but just before he can kill Andrea, Batman arrives and begs Andrea to give up her quest. She refuses and disappears. Batman and the Joker battle to a stalemate. Moments later Andrea returns and seizes Joker, bidding Batman goodbye before vanishing with the maniacally laughing clown. The amusement park erupts in a series of explosions and Batman barely escapes. [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]] later consoles Bruce, telling him that no one could have helped Andrea. Bruce finds her locket, containing a picture of himself and Andrea, in the [[Batcave]]. Meanwhile, Andrea departs from Gotham alone on an ocean liner, feeling completely lost. Batman stands on top of a Gotham building when the [[Bat-Signal]] appears in the sky, and swings off into the night to continue his war on crime.

==Cast==
* [[Kevin Conroy]] as [[Batman|Bruce Wayne/Batman]]; a billionaire industrialist whose parents were killed by a [[Joe Chill|mugger]] when he was eight years old. After traveling the world for several years to seek the means to fight injustice, he returns to Gotham. At night, Bruce becomes Batman, Gotham City's secret vigilante protector.
* [[Dana Delany]] as [[Andrea Beaumont]]; a woman Bruce meets in the early years of his return to Gotham after traveling the world. The decision to propose to her in marriage leads to him abandoning his plans for becoming a vigilante. However, after she unexpectedly and mysteriously leaves, Bruce's frustration leads to his becoming Batman. Delany's voice performance in the film impressed the filmmakers, leading to her casting as [[Lois Lane]] in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]''.<ref>{{cite news|author=Barry Freiman|title=Exclusive Interview with Dana Delany|publisher=Superman Homepage|date=2005-06-14|url=http://www.supermanhomepage.com/tv/tv.php?topic=interviews/dana-delany|accessdate=2008-01-28|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210035723/http://www.supermanhomepage.com/tv/tv.php?topic=interviews%2Fdana-delany|archivedate=2008-02-10|deadurl=no|df=}}</ref>
* [[Hart Bochner]] as City Councilman Arthur Reeves; a corrupt city official who was once an intern for Carl Beaumont. He later becomes involved with Valestra's gang in order to gain the influence to enter City Council, and told them where his former boss was hiding in return for campaign funds. Years later, the Joker tracks him down and poisons him with his laughing gas. He last appears in the Gotham City Mental Hospital, having been driven insane by the Joker's chemicals. Bochner's [[Lloyd Bochner|father]] was the voice of [[Hamilton Hill (comics)|Mayor Hamilton Hill]] in ''Batman: The Animated Series''.
* [[Stacy Keach]] as Carl Beaumont; Andrea's father, who was secretly in business with the Valestra gang. He goes in debt to Valestra and flees to Europe with Andrea, but is later murdered by Valestra's personal hitman, who would become the Joker. Keach also provided the voice for [[Andrea Beaumont|the "Phantasm" vigilante]].
* [[Abe Vigoda]] as Salvatore Valestra; a powerful crime boss who goes into business with Carl Beaumont, and threatens to kill him for [[Embezzlement|embezzling]] money. Once Andrea returns, he is an old, decrepit man, dependent on an oxygen tank to live due to years of [[smoking]]. He hires the Joker to kill Batman, but the Joker double-crosses him and kills him with Joker venom. Vigoda previously portrayed gangster [[Salvatore Tessio]] in ''[[The Godfather]]'', though his character was a [[caporegime]] rather than the boss.
* [[Mark Hamill]] as [[Joker (comics)|The Joker]]; Batman's nemesis, who was once an assassin for Valestra (and is implied to be responsible for the murder of Carl Beaumont). Valestra hires him to kill Batman, but the Joker kills Valestra instead. Hamill claims he took the opportunity of reprising his role from ''Batman: The Animated Series'' by way of creating new "laughing vocabularies."<ref>{{cite news|author=Jacquie Kubin|title=An Interview With Mark Hamill|publisher=Animation World Magazine|date=April 1997|url= http://www.awn.com/mag/issue2.1/articles/kubin2.1.html|accessdate= 2008-01-22}}</ref>
* [[Efrem Zimbalist Jr.]] as [[Alfred Pennyworth]]; once the trusted butler to Bruce Wayne's parents, he continues his loyal service to their son after their deaths. He is Batman's closest confidante.
* [[Robert Costanzo]] as [[Harvey Bullock (comics)|Detective Harvey Bullock]]; a detective with the [[Gotham City Police Department]] who distrusts Batman and is put in charge of the police task force assigned to hunt down the Dark Knight after he is framed for the gangster murders. 
* [[Bob Hastings]] as [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner James Gordon]]; the police commissioner of Gotham City and Batman's closest ally. He refuses to capture Batman, believing the Dark Knight is not responsible for any of the gangster murders.
* [[Dick Miller]] as Chuckie Sol; a crime boss and the Phantasm's first victim.
* [[John P. Ryan (actor)|John P. Ryan]] as Buzz Bronski; a crime boss who seems to have had a brief partnership with Chuckie Sol. He is later killed by the Phantasm at the cemetery while visiting Sol's resting place.

Additional voices: [[Jeff Bennett]], [[Ed Gilbert]], [[Marilu Henner]], [[Charles Howerton]], [[Pat Musick]], [[Thom Pinto]], [[Neil Ross]], [[Arleen Sorkin]] and [[Vernee Watson-Johnson]].

==Production==
Impressed by the success of the first season of ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], [[Warner Bros.]] assigned Alan Burnett to write a story for a full-length animated film. The original idea for the film was to have Batman being captured by his enemies at [[Arkham Asylum]] and be put on a trial by them, as they wanted to show that he was guilty of making them what they had become. The idea's concept, however, was considered "too brainy", as it required Batman to be immobile for a long time, so the idea was later used in the series' episode "Trial", which was aired after the movie's release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/batman-mask-of-the-phantasm-animated-movie-facts-trivia/|title=15 Things You Didn’t Know About Batman: Mask Of The Phantasm|date=1 February 2017|website=Screenrant.com|accessdate=4 June 2018}}</ref> Although the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] does play a pivotal role in the film, it was Burnett's intention to tell a story far removed from the television show's regular [[rogues gallery]]. Burnett also cited he "wanted to do a love story with Bruce because no one had really done it on the TV show. I wanted a story that got into his head."<ref name="Burnett">{{cite book | last = [[Paul Dini]]; [[Chip Kidd]]| title =''Batman Animated'' | publisher = [[Titan Books]] | year = 1998 | page = 114 | isbn = 978-1-84023-016-1| title-link =Batman Animated }}</ref> In reality, the creative team had said that they originally didn't want to use the Joker in the film. Conversely, [[Paul Dini]] stated that the Joker was always part of the film from the beginning of its production.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Paul_Dini/status/900566977831239680|title=Paul_Dini on Twitter|publisher=[[Twitter]]|accessdate=4 June 2018}}</ref> The writers were highly cautious of placing the Joker in the film as they did not want any connection to [[Tim Burton]]'s 1989 film ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'', but writer Michael Reaves said, "We then realized that we could make his appearance serve the story in a way that we never could in live-action."<ref name="Animation">{{cite news|author=Joe Tracy|title =Interview with Michael Reaves|publisher=Animation Artist|date=|url= http://www.animationartist.com/2000/Interviews/Screenwriters/Michael_Reaves/MReaves.html|accessdate= 2008-01-22| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080211171116/http://www.animationartist.com/2000/Interviews/Screenwriters/Michael_Reaves/MReaves.html| archivedate= 11 February 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> In order to keep the Joker as a solo threat, [[Bruce Timm]] and Burnett convinced frequent ''Animated Series'' writer [[Paul Dini]] to not use [[Harley Quinn]] in the film for that reason. The same technique was previously  used in the episodes "Joker's Wild" and "The Strange Secret of Bruce Wayne".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://issuu.com/twomorrows/docs/backissue99preview|title=Back Issue #99|website=Issuu.com|accessdate=4 June 2018}}</ref>

Aiding Burnett in writing the script were [[Martin Pasko]], who handled most of the flashback segments; Reaves, who wrote the [[climax (narrative)|climax]]; and Dini, who claims he "filled in holes here and there".<ref name="Burnett" /> The film's plot was heavily influenced by the 1987 miniseries ''[[Batman: Year Two]]'', written by [[Mike W. Barr]] and illustrated by [[Alan Davis]], [[Paul Neary]], [[Alfredo Alcala]], [[Mark Farmer]] and [[Todd McFarlane]].<ref>{{cite wb|author=Chris Sims|title =Ask Chris #92: The Great and Terrible ‘Batman: Year Two’|publisher=[[Comics Alliance]]|date=February 3, 2012|url=http://comicsalliance.com/ask-chris-batman-year-two/?trackback=tsmclip|accessdate= 2017-06-14| archiveurl= | deadurl= no}}</ref> [[Orson Welles]]' 1941 classic ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' served as an influence for the flashbacks, a story about loss and the passage of time.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Les Daniels]]|title=Batman: The Complete History|isbn=978-0-8118-2470-5|publisher=[[Chronicle Books]]|page=184|year=2000}}</ref> The character of Hazel, the cook robot of the World of the Future Fair, was named by Burnett after Hazel the Maid (portrayed by actress [[Shirley Booth]]), ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' protagonist of cartoonist [[Ted Key]]'s TV show ''[[Hazel (TV series)|Hazel]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Paul_Dini/status/902309884657524738|title=Paul_Dini on Twitter|publisher=[[Twitter]]|accessdate=4 June 2018}}</ref> On the other hand, the design of the Phantasm went into 20 different versions until one was found which convinced the film's crew. According to Burnett, the Phantasm was like the [[Grim Reaper]] with a cape, although the idea was to make him resemble the [[Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come|Ghost of Christmas Future]] of [[Charles Dickens]]' novel ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydv8TS2wids|title=The Making Of Batman Mask of The Phantasm|first=|last=Living Abstraction|date=11 September 2015|accessdate=4 June 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> something that even the Joker mentions in the finished version of the film. 
{{Quote box|width=40%|align=right|quote=“It was basically an expanded episode. We boarded the script and did all of our designs and shipped it overseas.

Early in production, Warner Bros. decided to release ''Phantasm'' as a theatrical release, rather than [[Direct-to-video|straight to video]]. That left less than a year for production time (most animated features take well over two years from finished story to final release). Due to this decision, the animators went over the scenes in order to accommodate the widescreen theatrical [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]].<ref name="Radomski">Dini, Kidd, p.117</ref> The studio cooperated well, granting the filmmakers a large amount of creative control.<ref>{{cite news|author=Emru Townsend|title=Paul Dini: From Babs and Buster Bunny to Batman|publisher=''Purple Planet'' Media|date=1999-05-17|url=http://purpleplanetmedia.com/eye/inte/pdini.php|accessdate=2008-01-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726212141/http://purpleplanetmedia.com/eye/inte/pdini.php|archive-date=2011-07-26|dead-url=yes|df=}}</ref>

Warner Bros. also increased the production budget to $6 million,<ref name="Miller" /> which gave the filmmakers opportunities for more elaborate set pieces. The opening title sequence featured a flight through an entirely [[computer-generated imagery|computer-generated]] [[Gotham City]].<ref name="Burnett" /> As a visual joke, sequence director [[Kevin Altieri]] set the [[climax (narrative)|climax]] of the film inside a miniature automated model of Gotham City, where Batman and the Joker were giants. This was an homage to a mainstay of ''Batman'' comic books of the [[Dick Sprang]] era, often featuring the hero fighting against a backdrop of gigantic props (they would later do another homage to Sprang's works in ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'' episode "Legends of the Dark Knight").<ref name="Radomski" /> From start to finish, the film was completed within eight months.<ref name="Miller" />

==Themes==
Paul Dini intended each of the flashbacks into Batman's love life to "have a tendency to get worse, when you hope things will get better." Bruce's relationship with Andrea, which at first shows promise, eventually turns into turmoil.<ref name="turmoil">{{cite news|author=Richard Verrier|title=More That Meets the Eye: Producer-Writer of ''Batman'' Gives All| work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=1996-09-14|url=|accessdate=}}</ref> At first, Bruce and Andrea are set for marriage, but then Bruce is given a farewell note from Andrea cutting off their relationship. This eventually leads into Bruce's decision to become Batman.<ref name="turmoil" /> [[Richard Corliss]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' felt this scene paralleled Andrea's decision to avenge her own parents and reject love when she finds her own father murdered. Both events transform the two people (Bruce becomes Batman, Andrea becomes the Phantasm).<ref>{{cite news|author=[[Richard Corliss]]| title=Corliss' Roundups of Latest VHS Releases| publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''|date=April 1994|url=|accessdate= }}</ref> One scene depicts Bruce Wayne at his parents' tombstone saying "I didn't count on being happy." According to Reaves, this scene was to be a pivotal moment in Bruce's tragic life, as he denies himself the opportunity to live a normal life.<ref name="Animation" /> Reaves also stated: "When Bruce puts on the mask for the first time, [after Andrea breaks their engagement], and Alfred says 'My God!' he's reacting in horror, because he's watching this man he's helped raise from childhood, this man who has let the desire for vengeance and retribution consume his life, at last embrace the unspeakable."<ref name="Animation" />

==Comic books and merchandise==
In December 1993, two [[novelization]]s were released. One was written by Burnett, Dini, and Andrew Helfer<ref>{{Cite book|title=Batman: Mask of the Phantasm - The Animated Movie, A Novelization|last=Helfer|first=Andrew|last2=Burnett|first2=Alan|last3=Dini|first3=Paul|date=1993-12-01|publisher=Skylark|isbn=9780553481747|location=New York|language=English}}</ref> with the other authored by [[Geary Gravel]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Batman: Mask of the Phantasm|last=Gravel|first=Geary|date=1993-12-01|publisher=Bantam|isbn=9780553565812|edition=1st|location=New York|language=English}}</ref>

[[DC Comics]] released a comic book adaptation written by [[Kelley Puckett]] and drawn by [[Mike Parobeck]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mask of the Phantasm: Batman : the Animated Movie|last=Puckett|first=Kelley|last2=Parobeck|first2=Mike|date=1993-01-01|publisher=DC Comics|isbn=9781563891229|edition=First|location=New York, NY|language=English}}</ref> The comic book adaptation was later included with the VHS release. [[Kenner Products|Kenner]], who had already released toys for the cartoon series, produced several tie in figures for the film, including Joker and the Phantasm (packaged unmasked, spoiling a pivotal plot point in the film). ''Batman & Robin Adventures Annual #1: Shadow of the Phantasm'' was a comic book sequel to the film. It was written by Dini and released in 1996. In 2015, a DC Collectibles action figure 2-pack featuring Batman and Phantasm was released.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/23509-dc-reveals-2015-collectibles-line-up-arrow-the-flash-1st-scaled-batman-tas-batmobile.html|title=DC Reveals 2015 COLLECTIBLES Line-Up - ARROW, THE FLASH, 1st Scaled BATMAN: TAS BATMOBILE|website=Newsarama.com|accessdate=4 June 2018}}</ref>
