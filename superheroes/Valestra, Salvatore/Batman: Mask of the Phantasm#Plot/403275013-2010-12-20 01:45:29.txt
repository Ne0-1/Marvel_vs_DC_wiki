'''''Batman: Mask of the Phantasm''''' (also known as '''''Batman: The Animated Movie''''') is a [[1993 in film|1993]] [[Animation|animated]] [[superhero film]] based on the [[fictional character|fictional]] [[DC Comics]] character [[Batman]]. [[Eric Radomski]] and [[Bruce Timm]] directed the film, which stars [[Kevin Conroy]] as Batman and [[Mark Hamill]] as the Joker, as well as [[Dana Delany]], [[Hart Bochner]], [[Abe Vigoda]], and [[Stacy Keach]]. The film's storyline introduces [[Andrea Beaumont]], an old love interest of Bruce Wayne, who returns to [[Gotham City]], restarting their romance. At the same time, a mysterious killer begins systematically eliminating Gotham's [[crime boss]]es, and due to the person's dark appearance, he is mistaken for Batman. Now on the run, Batman must apprehend the killer and deal with the romance between himself and Andrea.

Development for the film started after the success of ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''. [[Warner Bros.]] assigned [[Alan Burnett]] to write the story, and Burnett collaborated with writers [[Paul Dini]], [[Michael Reaves]], and [[Martin Pasko]]. The original idea was to release the film as [[direct-to-video]], but the studio decided for a theatrical release, giving the filmmakers a strenuous eight-month schedule. ''Mask of the Phantasm'' was released with positive critical success, but resulted into a dismal box office due to the decision to release the film in theaters on such short notice. The film has since found cult success through its various [[VHS]] and [[DVD]] releases.

==Plot==
During a conference of crime bosses held in a [[Gotham City]] skyscraper, gangster Chuckie Sol is killed by a mysterious cloaked figure shortly after [[Batman]] bursts in on the meeting. Batman is blamed for the death. Councilman Arthur Reeves tells the media that Batman is an irresponsible menace, then attends a party at the mansion of billionaire Bruce Wayne, Batman's alter ego. Reeves jokingly taunts Bruce for his bad luck with women and for having allowed an old girlfriend, [[Andrea Beaumont]], to get away.

In a flashback to Bruce's college days, we see him meet Andrea in a cemetery while visiting his parents' grave. Bruce has vowed to avenge his parents' murder by dedicating his life to fighting crime. He dons a mask and black ninja-styled outfit and foils an armored car robbery, but is discouraged that the criminals do not fear him. Around the same time, he begins a romance with Andrea. Eventually, Bruce decides to quit his plan on becoming a crime-fighter and proposes marriage to Andrea. However, Andrea mysteriously leaves Gotham with her father, ending her engagement to Bruce in a [[Dear John letter]]. Believing that he has lost his only chance of having a normal life, Bruce finally dons the mask of Batman.

In the present, the mysterious killer finds and kills another gangster, Buzz Bronski. Batman discovers evidence linking Andrea's father with a number of organized crime figures. The killer later targets Salvatore Valestra, the mob boss for whom both Sol and Bronski once worked as enforcers, but is beaten to the punch by the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]], whom Valestra had foolishly consulted for help; Batman is blamed again and has a close call with the police after a brief confrontation with the killer. Rescuing Batman in her car, Andrea explains that she and her father had been hiding in Europe, from the Valestra mob, to whom he owed a lot of money. Carl Beaumont eventually repaid them, but that did not satisfy them. Batman believes that Andrea's father may be the killer, until he learns from Reeves (who now knows Batman is innocent) that Beaumont was murdered some time before.

The Joker tussles with the killer, who is revealed to be Andrea herself as the Joker has recently discovered, intent on avenging her father's death by killing the mobsters to whom he owed money and who ordered Beaumont murdered. The Joker is also revealed to be the last surviving member of the Valestra mob: an unnamed hitman who personally murdered Beaumont for Valestra. During the course of their struggle, Batman arrives. Bruce begs Andrea to give up her desire for revenge, but she refuses stating that they ruined her chances with Bruce and that he himself is constantly fighting for revenge. Andrea vanishes and Batman battles with the Joker in a miniaturized replica of Gotham City. After a protracted battle, Andrea reappears and both she and the Joker vanish in a cloud of smoke, with Batman barely escaping a series of rigged explosions by falling into a waterway and being swept away to safety by the current.

Back in the Batcave, a heartbroken Bruce receives consolation from [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]] stating that no one could have helped Andrea. Bruce finds a locket with a picture of Bruce and Andrea in it in the cave. Meanwhile, Andrea stands on the deck of an [[ocean liner]], alone. The final scene shows Batman now permanently alone standing on top of a building, still in grief. The [[Bat-Signal]] then emerges in the distance and Batman flies into action to continue his crusade against crime.

==Cast==
[[Image:Phantasm-locket.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Bruce discovers a locket that Andrea left for him in the Batcave.]]
* '''[[Kevin Conroy]]''' as '''[[Batman|Bruce Wayne / Batman]]''': A billionaire industrialist whose parents were killed by a mugger when he was eight years old. After traveling the world for several years to seek the means to fight injustice, he returns to Gotham. At night, Bruce becomes Batman, Gotham City's secret vigilante protector.
* '''[[Mark Hamill]]''' as '''[[Joker (comics)|The Joker]]''': Once an assassin for Valestra (and responsible for the murder of Carl Beaumont) who later hideously transformed into his more recognizable appearance. His identity is still unknown, as he was never referred to by name. Valestra hires him to kill Batman, and is later killed by him. [[Mark Hamill]] claims he took the opportunity of reprising his role from ''Batman: The Animated Series'' by way of creating new "laughing vocabularies".<ref>{{cite news|author=Jacquie Kubin|title=An Interview With Mark Hamill|publisher=[http://mag.awn.com/ Animation World Magazine]|date=April 1997|url= http://www.awn.com/mag/issue2.1/articles/kubin2.1.html|accessdate= 2008-01-22}}</ref>
* '''[[Dana Delany]]''' as '''[[Andrea Beaumont]]''': A woman Bruce meets in the early years of his return to Gotham after traveling the world. The decision to propose to her in marriage leads to him abandoning his plans for becoming a vigilante. However, after she unexpectedly and mysteriously leaves, Bruce's frustration leads to his becoming Batman. Delany's voice performance in the film impressed the filmmakers, leading to her casting as [[Lois Lane]] in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]''.<ref>{{cite news|author=Barry Freiman|title=Exclusive Interview with Dana Delany|publisher=Superman Homepage|date=2005-06-14|url= http://www.supermanhomepage.com/tv/tv.php?topic=interviews/dana-delany|accessdate=2008-01-28}}</ref>
* '''[[Hart Bochner]]''' as '''City Councilman Arthur Reeves''': A corrupt city official who was once an interim for Carl Beaumont (before "selling his name to the mob"). He later becomes involved with Valestra's gang in order to gain the influence to enter City Council, and is poisoned by the Joker. His last appearance is at the Gotham City Mental Hospital, recovering from the effect of exposure to the Joker's poisonous chemicals. Because he was desperate for money during his first election campaign, he sold out Beaumont's hiding place in Europe to the Valestra mob.
* '''[[Abe Vigoda]]''' as '''Salvatore "The Wheezer" Valestra''': A powerful crime boss who practically forces Carl Beaumont to leave. Once Andrea returns, he is nearly dying with the effects of aging and years of inhaling cigarette smoke. Fearing his death due to the murders of other crime bosses, he hires the Joker to kill Batman, but he himself is killed by the Joker.
* '''[[Stacy Keach]]''' as '''Carl Beaumont''' and '''The Phantasm''': Andrea's father who made deals with the Valestra gang. He goes in debt to Valestra and flees to Europe with Andrea, but is later murdered. Keach also provided the voice for the Phantasm.
* '''[[Dick Miller]]''' as '''Charles "Chuckie" Sol''': A crime boss who falls as the first victim to The Phantasm.
* '''[[John P. Ryan (actor)|John P. Ryan]]''' as '''Buzz Bronski''': A crime boss who seemed to have had a brief partnership with Chuckie Sol whom Buzz disliked. He is later killed by The Phantasm at the graveyard while visiting Sol's grave.
* '''[[Efrem Zimbalist, Jr.]]''' as '''[[Alfred Pennyworth]]''': Once the trusted butler to Bruce Wayne's parents, he continues his loyal service to their son after their deaths. He is Bruce's closest confidante.
* '''[[Robert Costanzo]]''' as '''[[Harvey Bullock (comics)|Detective Harvey Bullock]]''': A police detective of the Gotham City Police Department who is highly cautious and questions Batman's vigilantism.
* '''[[Bob Hastings]]''' as '''[[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner James Gordon]]''': The police commissioner of Gotham City who refuses to capture Batman, believing the Dark Knight isn't responsible for any of the killings done by The Phantasm.

==Production==
Impressed by the success of the first season of ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', [[Warner Bros.]] assigned [[Alan Burnett]] to write a story for a full-length animated film. Although [[Joker (comics)|The Joker]] does play a pivotal role in the film, it was Burnett's intention to tell a story far removed from the television show's regular [[rogues gallery]]. Burnett also cited he "wanted to do a love story with Bruce because no one had really done it on the TV show. I wanted a story that got into his head."<ref name="Burnett">{{cite book | last = [[Paul Dini]]; [[Chip Kidd]]| title =''[[Batman Animated]]'' | publisher = [[Titan Books]] | year = 1998 | pages = 114 | isbn = 1-84023-016-9}}</ref> The writers were highly cautious of placing The Joker in the film as they didn't want any connection to [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' (1989), but writer [[Michael Reaves]] said: "''We then realized that we could make his appearance serve the story in a way that we never could in live-action.''"<ref name="Animation">{{cite news|author=Joe Tracy|title =Interview with Michael Reaves|publisher=[http://animationartist.digitalmedianet.com/ Animation Artist]|date=|url= http://www.animationartist.com/2000/Interviews/Screenwriters/Michael_Reaves/MReaves.html|accessdate= 2008-01-22}}</ref> Aiding Burnett in writing the script were, [[Martin Pasko]], who handled most of the flashback segments, [[Michael Reaves]], who wrote the [[climax (narrative)|climax]], and [[Paul Dini]], who claims he "''filled in holes here and there.''"<ref name="Burnett" /> ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941) served as an influence for the flashbacks, a story about loss and the passage of time.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Les Daniels]]|title=Batman: The Complete History|isbn=0-8118-2470-5|publisher=[[Chronicle Books]]|pages=184|year=2000}}</ref>

{{Quote box|width=40%|align=right|quote=“It was basically an expanded episode. We boarded the script and did all of our designs and shipped it overseas. We were treating it with more quality, but we originally didn’t intend it for the big screen.”|source=—Eric Radomski on Warner Brothers' decision to release the film theatrically<ref name="Miller">{{cite news |author=Bob Miller|title=Knight Vision|publisher=[[Comics Scene (magazine)|Comics Scene]]|date=June 1994|url=|accessdate=2008-01-23}}</ref>}}

Early in production, Warner Brothers decided to release ''Phantasm'' with a theatrical release, rather than [[Direct-to-video|straight to video]]. That left less than a year for production time (most animated features take well over two years from finished story to final release). Due to this decision, the animators went over the scenes once more in order to accommodate widescreen theatrical [[aspect ratio]].<ref name="Radomski">Dini, Kidd, p.117</ref> The studio did cooperate well, granting the filmmakers a large amount of creative control.<ref>{{cite news|author=Emru Townsend| title= Paul Dini: From Babs and Buster Bunny to Batman |publisher=''Purple Planet'' Media|date=1999-05-17|url=http://purpleplanetmedia.com/eye/inte/pdini.php|accessdate= 2008-01-22}}</ref>

In addition to the creative control, the studio increased the production budget to $6 million,<ref name="Miller" /> which gave the filmmakers opportunities for more elaborate set pieces. The opening title sequence featured a flight through an entirely [[computer-generated imagery|computer-generated]] [[Gotham City]].<ref name="Burnett" /> As a visual joke, sequence director [[Kevin Altieri]] set the [[climax (narrative)|climax]] of the film inside a miniature automated model of Gotham City, where Batman and The Joker were giants. This was a homage to a mainstay of ''Batman'' comic books of the [[Dick Sprang]] era, often featuring the hero fighting against a backdrop of gigantic props.<ref name="Radomski" /> From start to finish, the film was completed within eight months.<ref name="Miller" /> Composer [[Shirley Walker]] cited the score of ''Mask of the Phantasm'' to be a favorite amongst her own compositions.<ref>{{cite news|author=Randall Larson|title=Remembering Shirley Walker|publisher=Mania Music|date=2006-12-07|url=http://www.mania.com/52977.html | accessdate=2008-01-28}}</ref>

==Themes==
[[Image:Brucemask.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Bruce Wayne about to put on the mask of Batman for the first time. This was calculated by writer Michael Reaves to be a standing point in the film.]]
[[Paul Dini]] intended each of the flashbacks into Batman's love life to "have a tendency to get worse, when you hope things will get better." Bruce's relationship with [[Andrea Beaumont|Andrea]], which at first shows promise, eventually turns into turmoil.<ref name="turmoil">{{cite news|author=Richard Verrier|title=More That Meets the Eye: Producer-Writer of ''Batman'' Gives All| publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''|date=1996-09-14|url=|accessdate=2008-01-23}}</ref> At first, Bruce and Andrea are set for marriage, but then Bruce is given a farewell note from Andrea cutting off their relationship. This eventually leads into Bruce's decision to become Batman.<ref name="turmoil" /> [[Richard Corliss]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' felt this scene paralleled Andrea's decision to avenge her own parents and reject love, when she finds her own father Carl dead by the hands of an assassin. Both events transform the two people (Bruce becomes Batman, Andrea becomes The Phantasm).<ref>{{cite news|author=[[Richard Corliss]]| title=Corliss' Roundups of Latest VHS Releases| publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''|date=April 1994|url=|accessdate= 2008-01-23}}</ref>

One scene depicts Bruce Wayne at his parents' tombstone saying "I didn't count on being happy." According to writer [[Michael Reaves]], this scene was to be a pivotal moment in Bruce's tragic life, as he is denied the opportunity to live a normal life.<ref name="Animation" /> Reaves also stated: "When Bruce puts on the mask for the first time, [after Andrea Beaumont breaks their engagement], and Alfred says 'My God!' he's reacting in horror, because he's watching this man he's helped raise from childhood, this man who has let the desire for vengeance and retribution consume his life, at last embrace the unspeakable."<ref name="Animation" />
