==Thomas Andrew Tresser==

===Publication history===
The Thomas Tresser character was created by writer Cary Burkett in 1979 and named for an actor who Burkett was rooming with in New Hampshire.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://m.chicagoreader.com/chicago/nemesis-vs-politics-as-usual/Content?oid=917568|title= Nemesis vs. Politics as Usual - Gadfly, former actor, and superhero model Tom Tresser is back, calling on the creative class to claim their piece of the pie.|first= Deanna|last= Isaacs|date= December 23, 2004|publisher= ''[[Chicago Reader]]''|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/64tDXYXJ0|archivedate= January 22, 2012|deadurl= no|accessdate= January 22, 2012|quote= Tom Tresser, the square-jawed, blond comic-book hero, was created in 1979, when Tom Tresser, the meeker, balder actor, was working at the Merrimack Valley Theatre in Manchester, New Hampshire, and rooming with writer Cary Burkett.

Burkett's Tom Tresser became a mild-mannered, Shakespeare-quoting former FBI agent.}}</ref>  The character debuted in an eight-page backup story in ''The Brave and the Bold'' #166 (September 1980) written by Burkett and drawn by Dan Spiegle.<ref name="Trumbull">{{cite journal|last = Trumbull|first = John|title = Nemesis Balancing the Scales|magazine = [[Back Issue (magazine)|Back Issue]]|issue = 64|pages = 69â€“75|publisher = [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date = May 2013}}</ref>

===Fictional character biography===
'''Thomas Andrew Tresser''' is a vigilante, turned operative for the U.S. government and a master of [[disguise]]. His default costume is a black turtleneck sweater with a [[Weighing scale#Balance|balance]] as a chest symbol and a chest holster.

He was an applicant to an unnamed government agency whose brother Craig was an undercover agent infiltrating a criminal syndicate called "[[The Council (comics)|the Council]]". Craig was brainwashed into killing their family friend Ben Marshall and was subsequently killed in self-defense by fellow agents. Tom thus became "Nemesis", preferring to use an alias instead of his dishonored family name. With the assistance of [[Batman]], he cleared his brother's name and saw the men responsible for his brother's death dead.

This was covered in a backup series in ''The Brave and the Bold'' #166 through 192, with team-ups with Batman in #170 and #193.<ref name="Trumbull" />

===Suicide Squad===
Nemesis was apparently killed in the helicopter crash that killed the Council's leader, though he was later revealed to have survived, thanks to [[Amanda Waller]] and [[Rick Flag]]. He then became one of the few non-criminal members of the [[Suicide Squad]] as a means of paying off what he perceived as a debt. Nemesis became an occasional member of the Suicide Squad, assisting them from time to time, and fell in love with one of their members, [[Nightshade (comics)|Nightshade]].

[[Image:nemesisWall.jpg|thumb|left|235px|Nemesis threatens Amanda Waller.]]
During a mission in [[Moscow]] with the Suicide Squad, the team tried to rescue Zoya Trigorin. The mission was a bust, as she would die in his arms, and he was taken into custody. Rick Flag and Nightshade set up a rescue mission for their teammate, and came into conflict with the [[Justice League]] because of it. Eventually, the two teams worked out their differences, and Nemesis would later be allowed to escape by the Justice League. He continued to work alongside the Squad, but left the team after conflicts with Amanda Waller. He would later return only shortly to help retrieve Flag's kidnapped son and to assist in trying to uncover a secret government cabal. This plot-point that was never resolved.

Tresser was drafted into the [[Shadow Fighters]], in to battle the villain [[Eclipso]]. He was originally the sole survivor of the Eclipso massacre that claimed lives of the rest of the Shadow Fighters.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Robert Loren Fleming|Fleming, Robert Loren]]|penciller= [[Audwynn Jermaine Newman|Newman, Audwynn Jermaine]]|inker= [[Ray Kryssing|Kryssing, Ray]]|story= Hour of Darkness|title= [[Eclipso]]|issue= 13|date= November 1993}}</ref> He would continue the fight against Eclipso in a smaller recon-team that also included Nightshade and the matter-manipulator [[Chunk (comics)|Chunk]]. Nemesis and Chunk are saved from a nuclear bomb attack by Nightshade's powers.

After his involvement with the Suicide Squad and the Shadow Fighters ended, he apparently met his end - again - in the pages of ''[[Catwoman]]''.<ref name="Catwoman62">{{cite comic| writer= [[Devin Grayson|Grayson, Devin]]|penciller= [[Jim Balent|Balent, Jim]]|inker= [[John Stanisci|Stanisci, John]]|story= Dog New Tricks|title= [[Catwoman]]|volume= 2|issue= 62|date= October 1998}}</ref> In ''[[Superman]] Secret Files 2004,'' Nemesis was revealed to be alive and well, impersonating [[Sarge Steel]] and apparently working for a shadowy Cabal. Furthermore, in the last issue of the second volume of ''[[Suicide Squad]]'' the then-current team's erstwhile leader [[Sgt. Rock (comics)|Sgt. Rock]] is revealed to have been an impostor.  Given the events of the ''Superman Annual'', "Rock" may well have been Nemesis for some or all of his appearances with the Squad.  The story of what happened to Nemesis between his 'death' in ''Catwoman'' and subsequent reappearance in ''Superman Secret Files'' has not yet been told.

==="One Year Later"===
Nemesis was seen again [[One Year Later]] after the events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', aiding government agent Diana Prince, [[Wonder Woman]] in disguise, in the rescue of [[Donna Troy]] from several of the Amazon's villains. Nemesis is part of the newly re-opened [[List of government agencies in DC Comics#D.M.A.|Department of Metahuman Affairs]] under [[Sarge Steel]].

Around this time, Nemesis assists in saving the life of the second [[Maxi-Man (comics)|Maxi-Man]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Jodi Picoult|Picoult, Jodi]]|penciller= [[Drew Johnson (comics)|Johnson, Drew]]|inker= [[Ray Snyder|Snyder, Ray]]|story= Love and Murder, Part 1|title= [[Wonder Woman]]|volume= 3|issue= 6|date= Late May 2007}}</ref> Shortly before the events of [[Amazons Attack]] Nemesis questions the detainment of Wonder Woman by the D.M.A. and goes against orders to rescue her.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Picoult, Jodi|penciller= [[Terry Dodson|Dodson, Terry]]|inker= [[Rachel Dodson|Dodson, Rachel]]|story= Love and Murder, Part 3|title= Wonder Woman|volume= 3|issue= 8|date= Late June 2007}}</ref> He uncovers a plot by the villain [[Circe (comics)|Circe]] to trick the U.S. government into destroying [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]] under false pretenses. During the Amazon counterattack, he was stung by several gigantic Stygian Killer Hornets, native to the Amazon Nation. Wonder Woman risks her life by traveling to Themyscira for an antidote and revives Nemesis back into health.

Shortly thereafter, Nemesis is again wounded in battle. While he is recovering in the hospital,  Wonder Woman began courting Tresser, in the traditional Amazon manner. After formally meeting her mother [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Queen Hippolyta]], he is inducted as a member of the Amazon race despite being a male. He is given the title of '''Sir Thomas of Cleveland''', and given the ranking of Guardsman.<ref>{{cite book|last = Greenberger|first = Robert|authorlink = Robert Greenberger |title = Wonder Woman: Amazon.

===Recent adventures===
In the ''Final Crisis Aftermath: Escape'' storyline, Tresser is kidnapped and "reprogrammed" by [[Global Peace Agency]].<ref>{{cite book|last = Brandon|first = Ivan|authorlink = Ivan Brandon|coauthors = Rudy, Marco|title = Final Crisis Aftermath: Escape|publisher = DC Comics|year = 2010|pages = 144|isbn = 978-1401226084}}</ref> He then appears in ''Nemesis: The Imposters'', battling false versions of the DC Universe.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Brandon, Ivan|penciller= [[Cliff Richards|Richards, Cliff]]|inker= Richards|story= Part 1: Close Your Eyes|title= Nemesis: The Imposters|issue= 1|date= May 2010}}<br>{{cite comic| writer= Brandon, Ivan|penciller= Richards, Cliff|inker= Richards|story= Part 2: Almost Right|title= Nemesis: The Imposters|issue= 2|date= June 2010}}<br>{{cite comic| writer= Brandon, Ivan|penciller= Richards, Cliff|inker= Richards|story= Part 3: Something Small Enough to Break|title= Nemesis: The Imposters|issue= 3 |date= July 2010}}<br>{{cite comic| writer= Brandon, Ivan|penciller= Richards, Cliff|inker= Richards|story= Part 4: Here We Go|title= Nemesis: The Imposters|issue= 4|date= August 2010}}</ref>

==Soseh Mykros==
[[Image:JSA AN1.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Nemesis from ''JSA Annual'' #1]]
A second Nemesis debuted in ''[[Justice Society of America|JSA Annual]]'' #1 (October 2000).<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[David S. Goyer|Goyer, David S.]]|penciller= [[Uriel Caton|Caton, Uriel]]|inker= [[Wade Von Grawbadger|Von Grawbadger, Wade]]|story= Genesis|title= JSA Annual|issue= 1|date= October 2000}}</ref>

'''Soseh Mykros''' was the genetically engineered daughter of the leader of the [[The Council (comics)|Council]] (not to be confused with the above mentioned Council), a terrorist group that had once used the hero Paul Kirk, [[Manhunter (comics)|Manhunter]]. She originally operated as an ally of the Justice Society and assisted the team during a few adventures.

Eventually, she joined [[Black Adam]]'s group of loose cannon heroes, a group that, while altruistic, had no compunctions about killing. She became romantically involved with her teammate Alexander Montez, a man who had managed to bind the demon [[Eclipso]] to himself. Alex lost control and Eclipso killed Soseh. Alex regained control only to commit suicide out of grief and to protect others.

==Relationship of Tresser and Mykros==
In DC Comics continuity, Mykros does not seem to have any connection to Tresser except for the fact that they both battled organizations named "the Council". Tresser was killed in order for Mykros to debut in ''JSA''.

When asked in an interview what happened to Nemesis (Tom Tresser), why he was killed in ''Catwoman'' #62,<ref name="Catwoman62" /> and was it true that his death was editorially mandated, ''Catwoman'' writer [[Devin Grayson]] explained:
[[Image:AnimatedNemesis.jpg|'''Nemesis''' from the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' animated series.|thumb]]
{{cquote|''I was actually hoping to use Nemesis for the role in which I ended up using Trickster â€“ cheerful foil and potential romance. But yes, I was told that he was scheduled to be eighty-sixed â€“ an editor liked his name, but didn't like the character, and had plans, I guess, for a "new" Nemesis.''

''He wasn't slated to die in Catwoman, but I figured that if he was on his way out, his death might as well be handled by someone who liked and respected him â€“ I tried really hard to show what a great character he was before I killed him in such a way as to ensure that should anyone change their mind, they could bring him back without too much trouble.''<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.fanzing.com/mag/fanzing23/iview.shtml|title= Devin Grayson: The Interview|first= Michael|last= Hutchison|year= 1999|publisher=  Fanzing.com|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20120924063503/http://www.fanzing.com/mag/fanzing23/iview.shtml|archivedate= June 18, 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate= June 18, 2013}}</ref>}}

==In other media==
Nemesis (Thomas Andrew Tresser) has appeared as a background character in several episodes of ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''.

He debuted in the first episode of ''Justice League Unlimited'' ("[[List of Justice League episodes#Justice League Unlimited episodes|Initiation]]")<ref>{{cite AV media|people = Berkowitz, Stan (writer); [[Joaquim Dos Santos|Dos Santos, Joaquim]] (director)|title = [[Justice League Unlimited]]: ''"Initiation" (episode)''|publisher = [[Cartoon Network]]|date = July 31, 2004}}</ref> and later was seen more prominently in the episode "Dark Heart".<ref>{{cite AV media|people = [[Warren Ellis|Ellis, Warren]] (writer); [[Dan Riba|Riba, Dan]] (director)|title = Justice League Unlimited: ''"Dark Heart" (episode)''|publisher = Cartoon Network|date = December 11, 2004}}</ref>
