==Nemesis I==
'''Nemesis''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]].  He is a vigilante, turned operative for the [[United States of America|U.S.]] government and a master of [[disguise]].  He uses disposable masks made of a fine, highly malleable material which could be instantly dissolved with a special spray that he kept concealed in his collar.  He first appeared in ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' #166.  His default costume is a black turtleneck sweater with a [[balance]] as a chest symbol and a chest holster.

Tom Tresser was an applicant to an unnamed government agency whose brother Craig was an undercover agent infiltrating a criminal syndicate called the Council.  Craig was brainwashed into killing their family friend Ben Williams and was subsequently killed in self-defense by fellow agents.  Tom thus became the Nemesis, preferring to use an alias instead of his dishonored family name.  With the assistance of [[Batman]], he cleared his brother's name and saw the men responsible for his death dead.  

Nemesis was apparently killed in the helicopter crash that killed the Council's leader, though he was later revealed to have survived, thanks to [[Amanda Waller]] and [[Rick Flagg]].  He then became one of the few non-criminal members of the [[Suicide Squad]] as a means of paying off what he percieved as a debt. Nemesis became an on/off member of the Suicide Squad, assisting them from time to time, and even fell in love with one of their members, [[Nightshade (comics)|Nightshade]]. Although the love was returned, the two never really began a relationship.

During a mission in Moscow with the Suicide Squad, the team tried to rescue (although she saw it as a kidnapping) Zoya Trigorin. The mission was a bust, as she would die in his arms, and he was taken into custody. Rick Flagg and Nightshade set up a rescue mission for their teammate, and even came into conflict with the [[Justice League]] because of it. Eventually, the two teams worked out their differences, and Nemesis would later be allowed to escape by the Justice League. He continued to work alongside the Squad for a while, but eventually left the team after bumping heads with Amanda Waller. He would later return only shortly to help retrieve the kidnapped son of [[Rick Flagg] and to assist in trying to uncover a secret government cabal. A plot-point that was never resolved.

After his involvement with the Suicide Squad ended, he apparently met his end - again - in the pages of ''[[Catwoman]]''. In Superman Secret Files 2004 (August 2004) Nemesis was revealed to be alive and well, impersonating [[Sarge Steel]] and apparently working for a shadowy Cabal.

==Nemesis II==
A second Nemesis appeared in the pages of the [[Justice Society of America]]. Soseh Mykros was the genetically engineered daughter of the leader of the Council, a terrorist group that had once used the hero Paul Kirk, [[Manhunter|Manhunter (comics)]]. She joined [[Black Adam]]'s group of loose cannon heroes, a group that while heroic, had no compulsion killing. She became romantically involved with her teamate Alexander Montez, a man who had managed to bind the demon [[Eclipso]] to himself. However, Alex lost control and Eclipso killed Soseh. Alex regained control only to commit suicice out of grief and to protect others.

==Note==
Nemesis II does not seem to have any connection to Nemesis I. Nemesis is also not to be confused with [[Holocaust (comics)|Holocaust]], a [[Marvel Comics]] character who has also gone by the name of Nemesis, or with [[Nemesis Kid]].

== Other Media ==
Nemesis has appeared as a background character in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''.
