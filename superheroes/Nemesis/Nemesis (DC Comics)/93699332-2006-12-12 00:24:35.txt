'''Nemesis''' is the name of two [[fictional character]]s in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]]. 

==Tom Tresser==
'''Tom Tresser''' is a vigilante, turned operative for the [[United States of America|U.S.]] government and a master of [[disguise]]. His default costume is a black turtleneck sweater with a [[balance]] as a chest symbol and a chest holster.

He was an applicant to an unnamed government agency whose brother Craig was an undercover agent infiltrating a criminal syndicate called the Council. Craig was brainwashed into killing their family friend Ben Williams and was subsequently killed in self-defense by fellow agents. Tom thus became the Nemesis, preferring to use an alias instead of his dishonored family name. With the assistance of [[Batman]], he cleared his brother's name and saw the men responsible for his brother's death dead. 

This was covered in a backup series in ''[[Brave and the Bold]]'' #166 through 192, with team-ups with Batman in #170 and #193. 

Nemesis was apparently killed in the helicopter crash that killed the Council's leader, though he was later revealed to have survived, thanks to [[Amanda Waller]] and [[Rick Flag]]. He then became one of the few non-criminal members of the [[Suicide Squad]] as a means of paying off what he perceived as a debt. Nemesis became an on/off member of the Suicide Squad, assisting them from time to time, and even fell in love with one of their members, [[Nightshade (comics)|Nightshade]]. Although the love was returned, the two never really began a relationship.

During a mission in [[Moscow]] with the Suicide Squad, the team tried to rescue (although she saw it as a kidnapping) Zoya Trigorin. The mission was a bust, as she would die in his arms, and he was taken into custody. Rick Flag and Nightshade set up a rescue mission for their teammate, and even came into conflict with the [[Justice League]] because of it. Eventually, the two teams worked out their differences, and Nemesis would later be allowed to escape by the Justice League. He continued to work alongside the Squad for a while, but eventually left the team after bumping heads with Amanda Waller. He would later return only shortly to help retrieve the kidnapped Flag's son and to assist in trying to uncover a secret government cabal. A plot-point that was never resolved.

Nemesis I was drafted into the [[Shadow Fighters (comics)|Shadow Fighters]], in an attempt to battle the villain Eclipso. He was originally the sole survivor of the Eclipso massacre that claimed lives of the rest of the Shadow Fighters in issue 13 of the ''Eclipso'' series.

After his involvement with the Suicide Squad and The Shadow Fighters ended, he apparently met his end - again - in the pages of ''[[Catwoman]]''. In ''[[Superman]] Secret Files 2004,'' (August 2004) Nemesis was revealed to be alive and well, impersonating [[Sarge Steel]] and apparently working for a shadowy Cabal. Furthermore, in the last issue of the second volume of [[Suicide Squad]] the then-current team's erstwhile leader [[Sgt. Rock (comics)|Sgt. Rock]] is revealed to have been an imposter.  Given the events of the Superman Annual, "Rock" may well have been Nemesis for some or all of his appearances with the Squad.  The story of what happened to Nemesis between his 'death' in Catwoman and subsequent reappearance in Superman Secret Files has not yet been told.

==="One Year Later"===
Nemesis was seen once more [[One Year Later]] after the events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', aiding government agent Diana Prince, [[Wonder Woman]] in disguise, in the rescue of [[Donna Troy]] from several of the Amazon's villains. Nemesis is part of the newly re-opened Department of Metahuman Affairs under [[Sarge Steel]].

==Soseh Mykros==
A second Nemesis appeared in the pages of the [[Justice Society of America]]. '''Soseh Mykros''' was the genetically engineered daughter of the leader of [[The Council (comics)|the Council]], a terrorist group that had once used the hero Paul Kirk, [[Manhunter (comics)|Manhunter]]. She joined [[Black Adam]]'s group of loose cannon heroes, a group that, while altruistic, had no compunctions about killing. She became romantically involved with her teammate Alexander Montez, a man who had managed to bind the demon [[Eclipso]] to himself. However, Alex lost control and Eclipso killed Soseh. Alex regained control only to commit suicice out of grief and to protect others.

==Note==
Nemesis II does not seem to have any connection to Nemesis I (except for the fact that they both battled organizations named "the Council"). Nemesis is also not to be confused with [[Holocaust (comics)|Holocaust]], a [[Marvel Comics]] character who has also gone by the name of Nemesis, or with [[Nemesis Kid]].

==Other media==
Nemesis has appeared as a background character in several episodes of ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''.
