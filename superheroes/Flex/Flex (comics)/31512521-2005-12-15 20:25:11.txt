'''Flex''' (real name Adrian Corbo) is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He is a former member of the superhero team [[Alpha Flight]]. He first appeared in ''Alpha Flight: In The Beginning'', and first appeared as Flex in ''Alpha Flight'' volume 2 #1 (both published in 1998).

Adrian and his older half-brother Jared (later codenamed [[Radius (comics)|Radius]]) were raised in the Hull House orphanage, which was actually a facility operated by the [[Canada|Canadian]] government's secretive Department H. While Adrian became shy, reserved and bookish, Jared became athletically inclined, aggressive, and arrogant. Both brothers manifested [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] powers after puberty: Adrian gained the ability to transform parts of his body into blades, while Jared manifested a personal force field that could not be shut down. The brothers were recruited into a new incarnation of the Canadian superhero team Alpha Flight.

They assisted the new Alpha Flight in battling several foes, including the [[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac]], the [[Brass Bishop]], and Departent H's own power-mad leader, Jeremy Clarke, who died of radiation poisoning during a Zodiac raid on the Department H headquarters. Their Alpha Flight team fought several members of the original Flight and later teamed up with them to defeat a new [[Weapon X]], who had been created by a rogue Department H scientist. Both groups of Alphans merged into a unified Alpha Flight following this adventure. The Corbo brothers and several other members of the new team were later reasigned to Alpha Flight's trainee team, [[Beta Flight]].

Flex is a [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] who can transform his limbs into massive, razor-sharp organic metal blades. It may be possible that he can transform his entire body into this substance.

It was suggested that Hull House was a facility that collected the children of other superhumans. It was suggested that Jared's father was [[Unus the Untouchable]]; Adrian's father was never confirmed, although writer [[Steven Seagle]] has suggested that it was actually [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]].
