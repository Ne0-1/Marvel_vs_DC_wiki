{{copyedit|section|date=December 2010}}
{{unclear|section|date=December 2010}}
Clay, Jensen, Roque, Pooch and Cougar are members of an elite [[United States Special Forces]] team sent into the [[Bolivia]]n jungle on a search-and-destroy mission. Upon painting their target for an air strike, Cougar spots children being moved into the camp. Their attempts at aborting the strike are met with resistance, and upon destruction of the targeting equipment, it's revealed that their remote commander is codenamed Max, and that he has no intention of aborting the strike. Against orders, Clay moves the team into the compound to rescue the children, finding all but one. Clay finds the last child guarded by the mission's primary target, and Clay shoots him. The team and the children escape the compound in a  school bus, narrowly escaping the strike. Reaching their pickup location, Clay opts to airlift the children out of the area instead of the team. But Max, believing the team to be on board the helicopter, orders it destroyed.

Presumed dead, the team is stranded in Bolivia, where they now make a living for fixing [[cockfights]].  They are contacted by Aisha, a woman who knows how to get to Max and who offers to help them as long as they make sure he dies. After the team agrees to what Aisha describes as "essentially a suicide mission", Aisha smuggles them into the [[United States]]. Aisha reveals Max will travel via armored convoy in Miami, and the team hijacks a helicopter to use in kidnapping him. The mission proceeds as planned, but Pooch is identified by Wade, Max's head of security. They discover that the convoy was not carrying Max, but a computer hard drive. Jensen cannot crack the encryption on the secure hard drive.

In [[Dubai]], Max meets with clients who are having "moral issues" with Max's plans. After negotiations, they agree to help. Max intends to purchase an environmentally friendly bomb called a snuke, with the power equivalent to a nuclear weapon but with no fall-out, and intends to sell it to any customer who agrees to use it rather than hold it as a deterrent against attack.

Clay and the team find the encryption key to the hard drive is held at the headquarters of a global manufacturing conglomerate. Jensen breaks in disguised as a courier to steal the algorithm needed to crack the encryption. Barely making it out, Jensen cracks it and finds that the hard drive contains information that can only be extracted at certain locations possessing access and the encryption key. A log of past extractions is found on the drive, revealing that the most frequently used location is in the Port of Los Angeles.  The team assumes this is Max's home base.

Max's clients procure his weapons, but as it is a "difficult" process, they raise the price of the exchange. Max realizes he cannot get the funds, but knows he can trick Clay and the team into doing it for them.

Jensen discovers that Max possesses $400 million that originally belonged to the man Clay shot in Bolivia, and that the man originally intended the money to go to his daughter, Aisha.  The team rushes to warn Clay, but Aisha escapes after shooting Jensen in the arm.  Knowing Aisha could ruin them, Clay and the team decide to hit Max's building in the Port of L.A. They infiltrate the location, but as the team gets into position they are systematically captured, with Clay being knocked out by Roque.

Roque, being dismayed with not capturing Max in Miami, had contacted Wade to make a deal: he turns over the team and gets to walk. While Clay is loaded into a van, he reveals that Roque betrayed them to the rest of the team, and the team is lined up to be executed, and Pooch is shot in both legs for his defiance. Moments before being shot, Cougar spots Aisha upon a rooftop with an rocket launcher. Aisha fires the weapon and distracts the guards, allowing Cougar and Jensen to disable them, and move Pooch to a safe location to be bandaged. Meeting up with Aisha, Clay is forced to reveal that he shot her father. She states that after they kill Max, they're going to finish their business.

Roque sees the team has escaped and attempts to hijack Max's plane full of money. Clay catches and fights Roque while the team chases Max. Wade sees Roque attempting escape and chases after him on a Ducati motorcycle, but Cougar shoots out the engine, launching Wade into the plane's engine and the bike into the cockpit, apparently killing Roque. Clay corners Max on top of a crane only to see that Max is holding a "dead man's switch" for an onsite activated Snuke. Max throws the switch off the crane into the water, forcing Clay to choose between killing Max and catching the switch. Clay dives into the water for the switch and manages to deactivate it. Max escapes and later calls Clay to gloat, but Clay points out that now he knows what Max looks like, and they'll be seeing him again.
