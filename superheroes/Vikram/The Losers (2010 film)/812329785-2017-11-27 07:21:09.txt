'''''The Losers''''' is a 2010 American [[action comedy film]] based on the adaptation of the [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] comic book [[The Losers (Vertigo)|series of the same name]] by Andy Diggle and Jock. Directed by [[Sylvain White]], the film features an [[ensemble cast]] that includes [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]], [[Jeffrey Dean Morgan]] and [[Zoe Saldana]].

The film received mixed reviews from critics and drew comparisons to ''[[The A-Team (film)|The A-Team]]'', a remake of which was released shortly after ''The Losers'' premiered.

== Plot ==
The Losers are an elite [[Black operation|black ops]] team of [[Special Forces (United States Army)|United States Special Forces]] operatives, led by Clay ([[Jeffrey Dean Morgan]]) and formed by Roque ([[Idris Elba]]), Pooch ([[Columbus Short]]), Jensen ([[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]]), and Cougar ([[Óscar Jaenada]]), who are sent to [[Bolivia]] in a [[search and destroy]] mission on a compound run by a drug lord. While [[Laser designator|painting a target]] for an upcoming air strike, the Losers spot slave children in the compound and try to call off the attack, but their superior, codenamed "Max" ([[Jason Patric]]), ignores their pleas.

With no other option, the Losers enter the compound, successfully rescue the children and kill the drug lord in the process. As a helicopter arrives to pick them up, Max, convinced that they know too much, orders it to be destroyed, unaware that they decided to rescue the children first. The Losers watch as a missile destroys the helicopter and kills 25 innocents. Knowing that the attack was meant to kill them, they fake their deaths and become stranded in Bolivia, determined to get revenge on the mysterious Max.

Four months later, Clay is approached by Aisha ([[Zoe Saldana]]), a mysterious woman who offers him the chance to kill Max, against whom she wants revenge. Clay accepts and Aisha arranges for the Losers to return to the [[United States]], where they proceed to attack a convoy supposedly carrying Max, only to discover that they were tricked by Aisha into stealing a hard drive with Max's secrets.

Unable to access the files, Jensen infiltrates the company that made the drive and steals an algorithm that allows him to crack the code, discovering that the drive contains credits for a $400&nbsp;million transfer in Max's name, which he received for selling "Snukes"—eco-friendly bombs with the potency of a nuclear warhead, but no fall-out—to international terrorists. Tracing the money flow to the [[Los Angeles]] [[Port of Los Angeles|International Port Of Entry]], which the Losers deduce is Max's base, a plan is formed to attack it and kill Max.

While studying the drive, Jensen discovers that their mission in Bolivia was a cover so Max could eliminate the drug lord—who had discovered his plan—and that Aisha is the man's daughter, seeking revenge for his death. After her cover is blown, Aisha shoots Jensen and escapes. Believing that she might betray them, the Losers decide to speed up their attack on Max's base, only to be betrayed by Roque and captured by Max and his right-hand man and chief of security, Wade ([[Holt McCallany]]).

As the Losers are lined up to be executed, Aisha returns and ambushes Max's team. In the ensuing fight, Clay confirms that he killed Aisha's father. Roque attempts to steal Max's plane, loaded with his money, and tries to escape. As Roque's jet heads down the runway, Wade takes a motorcycle and goes after him to retrieve Max's money. Cougar shoots the motorcycle's engine, causing Wade to be hurled into the jet's engine and the flaming motorcycle to be hurled into the cockpit of the plane, which explodes, killing Roque.

As Jensen, Cougar and Aisha help Pooch, who has been shot in both legs by one of Max's security guards, Clay pursues Max to a crane, where Max says that he has activated a Snuke that will destroy Los Angeles, and Clay will have to choose between de-activating it or killing Max. Clay chooses the former and Max escapes, but Clay affirms that he now knows what Max looks like and will soon find him.

Max escapes on a bus and is robbed by two thugs. His fate after this is unknown.

Shortly thereafter, the Losers help Pooch reach the hospital where his pregnant wife is giving birth to their son and attend Jensen's 8-year-old niece's soccer game.

* [[Jeffrey Dean Morgan]] as [[The Losers (Vertigo)#Characters|Lt. Col. Franklin Clay]]
:Clay is a [[special forces|special forces colonel]] and the ''defacto'' leader of the group. Morgan, who starred in the superhero mystery film ''[[Watchmen (film)|Watchmen]]'' (2009), felt that playing Clay was far less complicated in comparison to his ''Watchmen'' role as [[The Comedian(comics)|Comedian]].<ref name=collider /> Because of the radically different approach, Morgan stated that it gave him more freedom and allowed him to be more playful with his character. "This guy has a real, actually much better sense of humor than the Comedian did," avouched Morgan. "He’s not nihilistic. It’s completely different. This is much lighter. A much lighter load for me. There's also kind of room for me to interpret this as a project where, in ''Watchmen'', you had to– look, I was playing the Comedian in the most revered comic book ever written. I was confined to that. In this, I could fine-tune a lot of what I thought Frank Clay is and get to play with it a lot more."<ref name=collider>{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/jeffrey-dean-morgan-on-set-interview-the-losers-read-or-listen/20381/|title=Jeffrey Dean Morgan On Set Interview THE LOSERS – Read or Listen|first=Steve|last=Weintraub|publisher=Collider|date=March 25, 2010|accessdate=May 13, 2012}}</ref>
* [[Zoe Saldana]] as [[The Losers (Vertigo)#Characters|Aisha al-Fadhil]]
:A woman pretending to be a local Bolivian (actually Aisha, of Islamic North African origin) tries to pick Clay up and then, when exposed by him, offers assistance and funding to locate Max for her own ends. Jensen gets partial background details on her shadowy identity, wanted by multiple agencies, although her relationship to the Bolivian drug lord isn't discovered until he cracks the Goliath drive. In preparation for the role, Saldana participated in extensive weapons and physical training. The actress was required to gain a couple of pounds, as she was expected to carry weapons around for eight hours a day.<ref name=collider2>{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/zoe-saldana-on-set-interview-the-losers-read-or-listen-here/20378/|title=Zoe Saldana On Set Interview THE LOSERS – Read or Listen Here|first=Steve|last=Weintraub|publisher=Collider|date=March 25, 2010|accessdate=May 13, 2012}}</ref> Saldana described al-Fadhil as a manipulative and mysterious individual. "She’s a snake. You don’t really know what she’s hiding up her sleeve. She definitely had her own prerogative and it’s very meaningful for her. She’s trying her best to play her cards right, but Jeffrey’s character just gets to her. There’s just something about him that she’s unable to kind of to fill her task, her mission."<ref name=collider2 />
* [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] as [[The Losers (Vertigo)#Characters|Cpt. Jake Jensen]]
:The team's intelligence specialist and computer hacker. Evans professed that portraying the character was considerably different from his previous roles. "He's just a fun guy, you know? He's kind of the comic relief," Evans stated. "He loves life. He's a little nerdy. He's not very smooth."<ref name=mtv /> The actor further evaluated Jensen's personality: "He's not only a fun character because of the energy you get to infuse it with, but who he is, it's kind of against type. I don't really get to play guys who are awkward and uncomfortable at times in certain situations, so it's fun to play him."<ref name=mtv>{{cite web|url=http://splashpage.mtv.com/2010/04/23/chris-evans-gets-nerdy-for-the-losers-role/|title=Chris Evans Gets 'Nerdy' For 'The Losers' Role|first=Rick|last=Marshall|publisher=MTV ([[Viacom]])|date=April 23, 2010|accessdate=May 13, 2012}}</ref>
* [[Idris Elba]] as [[The Losers (Vertigo)#Characters|Cpt. William Roque]]
:An expert in detonating and deactivating explosives. Elba previously worked with [[Joel Silver]] in multiple films, and opined that his ties with Silver helped him sustain a role in the film. "Sylvain White, the director, is someone I've known in the industry, and he said to me 'I've got this thing I'm working on'. And a few directors had looked at the script, and were going to make it, but Sylvain landed it."{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

== Production ==

=== Development ===
[[Tim Story]] was initially announced as the film's director in 2007. ''The Losers'' was thought to be a notable departure from Story's previous work, as he spent considerable time directing the American superhero films ''[[Fantastic Four (2005 film)|Fantastic Four]]'' (2005) and ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]'' (2007).<ref name=variety>{{cite news

"I was looking for a vehicle that would have that edge," he affirmed, "but I didn't want to lose my personality, which is a bit tongue-in-cheek, where the characters have a little fun with each other."<ref name=variety /> Coinciding with Story's arrival, [[Peter Berg]] was declared as a producer for ''The Losers''. Berg was originally responsible for conceiving the film's script—ultimately having intentions to direct the film—but later concluded his endeavors in lieu of creating ''[[Hancock (film)|Hancock]]'' (2008).<ref name=variety /> Alongside Akiva Goldsman and Kerry Foster, Berg collaborated with longtime partners Sarah Aubrey and John Cameron.<ref name=variety /> [[Sylvain White]] replaced Story as director in October 2008.<ref>{{cite news

A native of [[Paris]] [[France]], White asserted that his fascination of ''The Losers'' became evident after drawing parallels to the graphic novels he read as a child.<ref name="MTV-SplashPage" /> Unlike the majority of superhero films, White appreciated the realistic nature of the installment. "What appealed to me about ''The Losers'' was that it wasn't the typical superhero-with-superpowers thing. It was based on real characters—realistic characters—and based in reality, like a lot of the European graphic novels that I had grown up reading."<ref name="MTV-SplashPage">{{cite web| date = 2010-03-24| author = Rick Marshal| title = 'The Losers' Director On Creator Collaboration, Scheduling, And His Favorite Scenes| url = http://splashpage.mtv.com/2010/03/24/the-losers-creator-collaboration-scheduling-favorite-scenes| work = MTV| publisher = [[Viacom]]}}</ref> [[Jock (cartoonist)|Jock]] and [[Andy Diggle]], the creators of the [[The Losers (Vertigo)|Vertigo comics of the same name]], worked closely with White creating for ''The Losers''; the former in particular was sought after by White for help. "From the beginning, even when I was working on the screenplay, I had a really tight dialogue with them — even in trying to visualize some of the scenes. I would talk to Jock often, because he's obviously got an amazing eye, and they came down during production. I'm actually talking to them almost every day right now, talking to Jock in terms of design. We included some of his design work into the design of the movie. I'm not going to give it away, but it's certain little design elements that we use to introduce the characters or transition from one location to the next."<ref name="MTV-SplashPage" /> The film adapts the first two volumes of the comic book, "Ante Up"<ref>''Ante Up'' (collects #1-6, 158 pages, [[2004 in comics|2004]] {{ISBN|1-4012-0198-9}})</ref> and "Double Down"<ref>''Double Down'' (with Shawn Martinbrough, collects #7-12, 144 pages, 2004 {{ISBN|1-4012-0348-5}})</ref> and tells the story in a more linear way than in the comic books. Elements of the story have been left out instead of trying to squeeze the whole story into one film and the director would like to tell the rest of the story if the film does well at the box office.<ref name="MTV-SplashPage2">{{cite web

In February 2009, it was reported that [[Jeffrey Dean Morgan]] would headline the upcoming adaptation playing Clay. In March 2009, it was confirmed that [[Columbus Short]] will play Pooch, [[Idris Elba]] will play Roque and [[Zoe Saldana]] will play Aisha, [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] playing Jensen, and [[Óscar Jaenada]] playing Cougar. In August 2009, it was announced that [[Jason Patric]] will play Max.<ref>{{cite news

The release date for ''The Losers'' was changed on two occasions; it was originally delayed to June 2010—as it roughly coincided with the release of ''[[Clash of the Titans (2010 film)|Clash of the Titans]]'' (2010)—ultimately reverting to an April release. This occurrence was partially attributed to investment purposes as well as to accommodate reshoots for the film—although reshoots were not needed for the film. "So I think the marketing department decided, 'Let's maybe move to the June date,' but then the April date opened up again and they went back to it. I'm not quite sure how the science of these things work, that's not really my department and I trust the marketing at Warner Bros. to make the best decision for the movie."<ref name="MTV-SplashPage" />

=== Filming ===
[[Principal photography]] commenced over a period of four months from July to October 2009. Despite the diverse array of settings featured in the film—which included cities such as [[Miami]], [[Dubai]], [[Mumbai]], and [[Los Angeles]]—most of principal photography transpired in [[Puerto Rico]].<ref name=film /> White found its infrastructure and locales to be ideal and convenient, giving them the ability to "cheat" because they had "a variety of terrains within a relatively small distance".<ref name=film /> "It was staggering what we found when we came to Puerto Rico to scout," recalled Foster. "There is a city, obviously gorgeous beaches, a close approximation of a desert, and a rainforest that was ideal to double for Bolivia."<ref name=film /> Filming locations in the area include the [[Arecibo Observatory]], which [[/Film]]'s Peter Scrietta felt that producers utilized the tropical environment to their advantage.<ref name=film />

Color was strongly emphasized in crafting the visuals of the film. Production designer Aaron Osbourne attempted to enhance the color scheme of the comics, which he noticed that only two to three colors were used to convey the tone of each setting. "Every chapter of the comic books is a new environment distinguished by different color palettes," explained White. "I really wanted to do that in the movie as well–where every time we are in a new city or country, the aesthetic of the film changes completely, so there is no homogeneous look. It’s very eclectic."<ref name=film /> This meticulous approach was echoed by cinematographer Scott Kevan, who White collaborated with in breaking down the images of various scenes. "We charted the whole movie with certain color schemes for each location and different shades as we moved from day to night."<ref name=film>{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/34-high-resolution-photos-from-the-losers/|title=34 High Resolution Photos from The Losers|first=Peter|last=Scrietta|publisher=[[/Film]]|date=April 8, 2010|accessdate=May 13, 2012}}</ref>
