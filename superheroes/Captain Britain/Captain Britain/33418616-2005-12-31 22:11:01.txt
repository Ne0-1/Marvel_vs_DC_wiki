'''Captain Britain''' (Brian Braddock), also briefly known as Britannic, is a [[fictional character]], a [[comic book]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. 

The Captain Britain character first appeared in ''Captain Britain Weekly'', a [[Marvel UK]] title written by [[Chris Claremont]] in 1976. The character is especially notable for a memorable run by [[Alan Moore]] and [[Alan Davis]] when both were at the start of their careers. 

He is also a regular character in Marvel's ''[[X Men]]'' spinoff title, ''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]''. 

==Publication history==
In 1976 [[Marvel UK]] had only reprinted existing US material, it had never produced any new work for the British market with the exception of some new covers for its various weekly reprint titles. 
It was decided that a new character would be created for [[Marvel UK]] and on October 13th, 1976, the first issue of ''Captain Britain Weekly'' appeared complete with a free gift (traditional for any new British weekly title) of a ''Captain Britain'' mask.
[[Image:Capbritain1.jpg|left|thumb|''Captain Britain Weekly #1'': First appearance of Captain Britain published in 1976. ]]

The title strip was written by [[Chris Claremont]] and drawn by [[Herb Trimpe]], providing back up were reprints of ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' and ''[[Nick Fury]]'' stories from Marvel US. 

The title was initially successful but the quality of these stories were generally considered to be poor and sales dipped. With its 39th issue it was cancelled and combined with [[Marvel UK]]'s ''[[Spider-Man]]'' title. The title, now called ''Super Spiderman and Captain Britain'' ran from #231-253 before Captain Britain vanished into comic book limbo.
During this time the character made his first US appearance in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #65, co-starring with Spider-Man, in 1978. 
Reprints of his UK adventures also popped up in various US Marvel titles and was the first time UK material had been reprinted by the parent US Marvel.
 
Meanwhile in the UK, the character didn't see light again till during the ''[[Black Knight (comics)| Black Knight]]'' strip running in [[Marvel UK]]'s ''[[Hulk Weekly]]'' title. This time round he was part of a lengthy story involving the [[King Arthur]] legend called ''The Otherworld Saga''. 

Also this was the first time the character had a completely British creative team including [[John Stokes]] and [[Steve Parkhouse]]. 
''Captain Britain'' proved a popular addition to the story and showed to then [[Marvel UK]] editor-in-chief, [[Dez Skinn]] that it could return in his own strip. So in issue 377 of ''[[The Mighty World Of Marvel]]'', ''Captain Britain'' returned, this time written by [[Dave Thorpe]] and drawn by [[Alan Davis]] in a story called ''The Crooked World Saga''. Thorpe wrote the stories till issue 386 but his scripts were considered to be confused and making no sense, so when [[Alan Moore]] took over with issue 387 he managed to tie up Thorpe's plotline and adapt it to fit his own concepts. 

''[[The Mighty World Of Marvel]]'' was cancelled with issue 388 but ''Captain Britain'' continued in the pages of ''[[The Daredevils]]'', another [[Marvel UK]] reprint title. It was during the 11 issues of ''The Daredevils'' that Moore and Davis found their feet individually and as a creative team. It is during this run (called the ''[[Mad Jim Jaspers|Jasper's Warp]]'' story) that Moore and Davis introduced many of the ideas and concepts that still follow the character to the present day. 

Moore left the writing duties when he started writing ''[[Swamp Thing]]'' and his workload duely increased. So [[Jamie Delano]] assumed writing duties (at Moore's recommendation) with [[Alan Davis]] starting with issue 14 ( volume two) of ''[[The Mighty World Of Marvel]]''. After that title was cancelled, ''Captain Britain'' once again had his own title, this time monthly instead of weekly. This run lasted 14 issues before being cancelled, these stories were later reprinted in the first ''Captain Britain'' trade paperback.[[Image:Capbritainmonthly1.jpg|left|thumb|''Captain Britain Monthly''#1 ]]
The character quickly found a new home in the pages of ''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'', an ''[[X-Men]]'' spin off written by [[Chris Claremont]] and drawn by [[Alan Davis]]. The series ran 125 issues plus specials and crossovers and included a notable run written and drawn by Alan Davis. The title has returned in November 2005, this time called ''New Excalibur'' and includes Captain Britain in its lineup. 

In 1990 saw [[Knights of Pendragon]] #1 being released. This was a superhero team book written by [[Dan Abnett]] and [[John Tomlinson]] with art by [[Gary Erskine]]. It mixed superheroics and [[Arthurian]] themes and featured Captain Britain as a regular member. It lasted 18 issues before restarting again with volume two, this time without Captain Britain making an appearance. 

There has been two trade paperbacks collecting ''Captain Britain'' stories. The first one released contained the [[Jamie Delano]] and [[Alan Davis]] material from ''Captain Britain Monthly''. <!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Ss114cover.jpg|right|thumb|The cover to ''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #114 (UK edition) ]] -->This caused some confusion with US readers as it was a continuation from [[Alan Moore]]'s work, however Moore was in dispute over the use of his characters by Marvel and refused permission for his work to be reprinted. This caused a dispute with Davis as he wanted their work to be reprinted in the U. S. Moore refused as he was still in dispute with Marvel over their reprinting his strips from ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' without his permission. Although Moore's work did receive a reprint in ''[[X-Men Archives]]'' during the mid-[[1990's]], it was badly coloured and done without Moore being credited for copyright for his charcters. 

It wasn't until [[Joe Quesada]] became editor-in-chief of [[Marvel Comics]] in 2000 that Moore's work received a trade paperback reprint in 2002. Moore accepeted Quesada's pledge that the Marvel he once knew was different and personally assured Moore that he would be fully credited. Sadly there was a printing error and Moore's copyright credits were missed from the first printing of the book. Moore disowned the book and although Quesada issued a public apology and ensured future printings contained the copyright notice, Moore made it clear he would not consider working for Marvel in any form again.

In 2005 ''Captain Britain'' has also featured in reprint titles from [[Panini Comics]], this includes the first new ''Captain Britain'' story produced by a British company in over 15 years in March 2005. This was published in ''[[Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #114 (UK Edition) and was created by [[Jim Alexander]], [[Jim Haward]] and [[John Stokes]].

==Biography==
Following a motorcycle accident, physics student Brian Braddock was recruited by [[Merlin (wizard)|Merlyn]] to be the superhero Captain Britain, a role he felt himself unsuited for. He joined forces with [[Spider-Man]] and the [[Black Knight (comics)|Black Knight]] early in his career, then returned to [[Great Britain]], first as a lone hero and then as part of [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]].[[Image:Captain Britain.jpg|thumb|left|Captain Britain in the costume he wore during most of his time with [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]. Art by [[Alan Davis]]]] 

Every Earth in Marvel Comics' [[multiverse]] has its own Captain Britain who is expected to defend that version of the [[British Isles]] and uphold its local laws. For example, on one Earth the [[Nazi]]s won [[World War II]], so its Captain Britain ("Hauptmann Englande") upholds the Nazi regime. On another Earth, [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]]s have been eradicated and Captain Britain runs a league of enforcers who hunt down any remaining mutants. In some of these alternate universes Captain Britain is the alternate version of Brian Braddock, in others it is someone completely different. The Earth of the "normal" Marvel Universe is called "[[Earth-616]]".

Brian has two siblings: his [[twin]] sister Elizabeth ([[Psylocke]] of the [[X-Men]]), and his older brother Jamie, once a playboy, and secretly a gunrunner, now a shady criminal committing atrocities in foreign countries. He is married to [[Meggan]], an [[empathy|empathic]] [[shapeshifter]]. At one point he learned that his father, like Merlyn, was originally from another [[dimension]], alternately called "[[Avalon]]" or "Otherworld". It has been suggested that Brian, like his siblings, is a [[mutant]]. 

Some sources suggest that he may be a recovering [[alcoholic]], but this is unconfirmed - that opinion seems to come almost exclusively from his behaviour at a time when he believed his sister dead. Regardless, Brian has professed himself to be a [[teetotaler]]. 

Eventually, after Roma's ascention to another plane of existence, he assumed the throne of Otherworld, and recently transferred the powers and mantle of the Earth-616 Captain Britain to a woman named [[Captain Britain (Kelsey Leigh)|Kelsey Leigh]], remaining the ruler of Otherworld (with the powers imbued by that role). Captain Britian was forced to come back to Earth to stop the [[House of M]] reality from coming into existence. During this time, his wife Meggan sacrificed her life to save a rip in time from destroying the Earth. This had resulted in Brian becoming active as Captain Britain again and the formation of the all new Excalibur, along with [[Pete Wisdom]], [[Sage (comics)|Sage]], [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]], [[Dazzler]] and [[Nocturne (comics)|Nocturne]].

===Ultimate Captain Britain===
In [[Ultimate Marvel]] continuity, Captain Britain is a member of the European Defense Initiative (the EU equivalent of the [[Ultimates]]), with Captain Italy and Captain Spain, both of whom have similar powers. All three of them developed their powers from the same source: a superpowered exo-suit developed by Doctor Braddock, Brian's father.

==Powers and abilities==
Brian Braddock has [[superhuman]] strength, the ability to fly, and near-invulnerability. Brian can lift approximately 90 tons under optimum conditions and his mystical link with Britain also enhances his stamina and reflexes to superhuman levels.

His power of flight allows him to fly at a maximum speed of 770mph and renders him immune to the atmospheric effects of flying at high speeds. His near invulnerability is provided by a force field closely over his skin, This forcefield can stand a bazooka shell without any deformation but repeated impacts will weaken the field and eventually penetrate it.

Brian is the also the twin of Betsy Braddock aka [[Psylocke]], because of this they are immune to each others powers and the two share a strong psychic bond.

For a time, all of his abilities were localized to Britain; if he went abroad for too long a time without wearing his costume, his powers eventually diminished to nothing. His costume acts as an antenna and battery, allowing him to retain his powers wherever he goes. He is also a [[scientist]], though he rarely has the opportunity to exercise his training as a [[physicist]]. 

When he and Meggan destroyed the Otherworld energy matrix at Roma's prompting, however, the energies that allowed him to retain his power within the UK without his costume were dissipated. Hence, to retain his powers anywhere on Earth, he must wear the costume at all times. 

Originally, his powers were linked to the Amulet of Right, worn around his neck, and he depended on a mace-like Star Sceptre to fly. Later on Merlyn changed his costume just before he entered an alternate Earth (Earth-238), removing the Amulet and the Sceptre, granting him superhuman strength in addition to his previous abilities, and placing the powers in his new costume. Not long after that he was killed by the [[Fury (Marvel Comics)|Fury]] and had his body remade by Merlyn, who chose this point to make his powers innate, with his costume merely serving as a "battery" and amplifier.

==Appearances in other media==
Captain Britain was briefly seen in the third part of the [[Dark Phoenix Saga|Phoenix Saga]] from the ''[[X-Men (animated series)|X-Men]]'' [[animated television series]].
