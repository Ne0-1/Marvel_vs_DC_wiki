'''Captain Britain''' (Brian Braddock), also briefly known as Britanic, is a comic book superhero in the Marvel Comics universe.

==History==
The Braddock family has supplied Captain Britains to guard the British Isles for centuries.  Following a motorcycle accident, physics student Brian Braddock was recruited by [[Merlin]] to be the latest incarnation of Captain Britain, a role he felt himself unsuited for.  For a while he joined forces with [[Spiderman]] to learn the superhero trade, then returned to Britain first as a lone hero and then as part of [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]].

Every Earth in every parallel universe has its own Captain Britain who is expected to defend that version of the British Isles and uphold its local laws.  For example, on one Earth the Nazis won [[World War II]], so Captain Britain upholds the Nazi regime.  On another Earth, mutants have been eradicated and Captain Britain runs a league of enforcers who hunt down any remaining mutants.  The Marvel Universe standard Earth is #616. 

Brian has two super-powered siblings: his twin sister [[Psylocke (comics)|Psylocke]] of the [[X-Men]] and his older brother Jamie Braddock, once a playboy, now a madman with the ability to bend reality to his will.  He is married to [[Meggan (comics)|Meggan]], an empathic metamorph, and is a recovering alcoholic. 

==Powers and skills==
Captain Britain has super strength, the ability to fly, and near-invulnerability.  However, all of his abilities are localized to Britain; if he goes abroad for too long a time, he grows sick and weak.  His costume acts as an antenna, allowing him to retain his powers no matter how far he goes from Britain.  He is also a scientist, though he rarely has the opportunity to exercise his training as a physicist.
