'''Captain Britain''' ('''Brian Braddock'''), briefly known as '''Britannic, ''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] appearing in the comic books published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Herb Trimpe]], he first appeared in ''Captain Britain Weekly'', #1 (October 13, 1976). The character has been used in stories through the years by many people, most notably [[Chris Claremont]], [[Alan Davis]], and [[Alan Moore]].

The character was initially intended to be a British equivalent of [[Captain America]]. Endowed with extraordinary powers by the [[Matter of Britain|legendary]] magician [[Merlyn (Marvel Comics)|Merlyn]] and his daughter [[Roma (comics)|Roma]], Captain Britain was assigned to uphold the laws of [[United Kingdom|Britain]].

==Publication history==
The character was created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Herb Trimpe]] and originally appeared in ''Captain Britain Weekly'',<ref name="cbw1">''Captain Britain Weekly'' #1 (October 13, 1976)</ref> an anthology comic published excluvely in the United Kingdom by the Marvel Comics imprint known as [[Marvel UK]]. (''Captain Britain Weekly'' also included reprinted material featuring other Marvel Comics characters such as [[Nick Fury]] and the [[Fantastic Four]]). The first few issues of the comic were also promoted with free gifts, including a cardboard Captain Britain mask<ref name="cbw1"/> and a Captain Britain boomerang.<ref>''Captain Britain Weekly'' #2 (October 20, 1976)</ref>

Chris Claremont left the series after just ten issues, midway through the "Doctor Synne" storyline, and has since stated that this was because his view of the character and series was very different from that of the editor.<ref>"To Create An Icon," Captain Britain Volume 1: The Birth of a Legend, Panini Comics, February 2007, ISBN 1-905239-30-0</ref> In 1978, though, Chris Claremont revisited the character and introduced him to an international audience, fully integrating him into the Marvel Universe via a story that starred Captain Britain and [[Spider-Man]] in Marvel's long-running ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' series.<ref name="mtu65">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Chris Claremont]] | Penciller = [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] | Inker = Dave Hunt | Title = [[Marvel Team-Up]] | Issue = 65 | Date = January 1978| Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref>

The ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' story was reprinted in the UK in ''[[Super Spider-Man & Captain Britain]]'' which is where the Captain's adventures continued after ''Captain Britain Weekly'' folded in July 1977, after running for 39 issues. The serialization of the Spider-Man team-up marked the end of Captain Britain's exploits until March 1979 when Captain Britain appeared with the [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]] in the "Otherworld Saga" which ran in ''[[Hulk Comic]]''.<ref>{{comicbookdb|type=storyarc|id=2231|title=The Otherworld Saga}}</ref> 

Captain Britain appeared as one of the characters in Marvel US's 1982 ''[[Contest of Champions]]'' [[limited series]], which featured a collection of international heroes. Up to this point, the character had appeared exclusively in Marvel's UK comics - although some established Marvel characters such as [[Captain America]] and the [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]] appeared. Prior to ''Contest of Champions'', which was set during the period of the "Otherworld Saga", Marvel's American comics had not referenced these stories or acknowledged that they were part of the same shared [[Marvel Universe]].

Following the "Otherworld Saga" the character was relaunched, in a redesigned costume, in the ''[[The Mighty World of Marvel|Marvel Superheroes]]'' anthology title. The relaunch was initially written by [[Dave Thorpe]] and illustrated by [[Alan Davis]],<ref>''[[The Mighty World of Marvel|Marvel Superheroes]]'' #377 (September 1981)</ref> but after a few issues Dave Thorpe left the series and was replaced by British writer [[Alan Moore]],<ref>''Marvel Superheroes'' #387 (July 1982)</ref> who used Thorpe's stories as a springboard for the "[[Jaspers' Warp]]" storyline.

On redesigning the costume of the character, Davis noted that his depiction of Brian Braddock was visually based on [[Garth (comic strip)|Garth]], "an exaggerated Greek god, perfect in every way"<ref name=mm-ad>{{cite book|last=Nolen-Weathington|first= Eric |coauthors=|title=Modern Masters Volume 1: Alan Davis|publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing|pages=128|isbn=}}</ref> and that:

{{cquote|I decided to base his costume on military uniforms. If you've ever seen the mounted guards outside Buckingham Place, you'll recognize the components. The white leggings and the tall boots with the flaps over the knees were easy. The headgear took a bit more time because I wanted it to look like a helmet rather than a mask. The stripes across his chest started as two crossed sashes and underwent numerous changes.<ref name=mm-ad />}}

During this run, the series moved from ''Marvel Superheroes''<ref>''Marvel Superheroes'' #388 (August 1982)</ref> into a new monthly comic, ''[[The Daredevils]]''. When ''The Daredevils'' was canceled after eleven issues Captain Britain was continued in ''[[The Mighty World of Marvel]]''<ref>''The Mighty World of Marvel'' volume 2 #7 (December 1983)</ref> - and then, after the end of the run of Alan Moore,<ref>''The Mighty World of Marvel'' volume 2 #13 (June 1984)</ref> who left because of a dispute over unpaid invoices,<ref name=mm-ad /> it continued for a few more issues with different writers (Steve Craddock, Alan Davis, and [[Mike Collins (comics)|Mike Collins]]) until the comics ended <ref>''The Mighty World of Marvel'' volume 2 #16 (September 1984)</ref> and the story moved to a new monthly ''Captain Britain'' title with [[Jamie Delano]] taking over writing duties<ref>''Captain Britain'' #1 (January 1985)</ref> on the recommendation of Moore and with the agreement of Davis.<ref name=mm-ad />

Following the cancellation of Captain Britain's solo series, Claremont and Davis launched the American monthly ''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' in [[1988 in comics|1988]], featuring an eponymous team which included Captain Britain, with Braddock as a core member.

''[[Excalibur (comics)#New Excalibur (2005–2007)|''New Excalibur'']]'' was introduced in [[2005 in comics|2005]], with Captain Britain as team leader. This series ran until issue #24 and the team was disbanded in the ''[[X-Men: Die by the Sword]]'' [[limited series]].

A new series was then started in [[2008 in comics|2008]], using the [[Secret Invasion]] crossover storyline as a launchpad. Captain Britain headlines this series, ''[[Captain Britain and MI: 13]]'', written by [[Paul Cornell]], which included some characters from ''New Excalibur'', as well as members of [[MI-13 (comics)|MI: 13]] who appeared in Cornell's ''[[Pete Wisdom|Wisdom]]'' limited series.

[[Panini Comics]] bought [[Marvel UK]] and in 2006 renewed and broadened their license with Marvel<ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?threadid=64763 Panini, Marvel Expand Agreement, Announce New Projects] (press release), [[Newsarama]], March 29, 2006</ref> which allows them to produce original comic stories for the British and European markets. This has included Captain Britain's first original appearance in UK comics in thirteen years, with a story that ran in ''Spectacular Spider-Man Adventures''<ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=28350 Captain Britain Returns to... Britain], [[Newsarama]], February 25, 2005</ref><ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man Adventures'' #114 (April 2005)</ref> and Panini plan to have more in their new all-ages title ''Marvel Heroes''.<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/100809-Marvel-Heroes-Panini-UK.html Panini UK Launches 'Marvel Heroes' with All-New Strips], [[Newsarama]], October 9, 2008</ref>

Captain Britain made several cameo appearances in Marvel Comics publications then would feature in a [[Heroic Age (comics)|Heroic Age]] tie in anthology limited series and a ''Deadpool Team Up'' issue.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

==Fictional character biography==
===Origins===
[[Image:Captain Britain 36 clean image.jpg|thumb|left|180px|''Captain Britain'' (vol. 1) #36 (1977).<br>Art by [[Pablo Marcos]].]]
Born and raised in the small town of [[Maldon, Essex]] and educated at [[Fettes College]] in [[Edinburgh]], Brian was a shy and studious youth, living a relatively quiet life and spending a lot of time with his parents and siblings (older brother [[Jamie Braddock|Jamie]] and [[twin#Dizygotic twins|fraternal twin]] [[Psylocke|Elizabeth]]). The family were an aristocratic one who were no longer rich enough to fraternise with their former academic peers, leaving Brian (too proud to fraternise with lower classes) a lonely child who immersed himself in the study of physics.<ref>''The Daredevils'' #1</ref>

After the death of his parents (Sir James and Lady Elizabeth) in what seemed to be a laboratory accident, Brian takes a fellowship at Darkmoor nuclear research centre. When the facility is attacked by the technological criminal Joshua Stragg (alias "The Reaver"), Brian tries to find help by escaping on his motorcycle. Although he crashes his bike in a nearly fatal accident, [[Merlyn (Marvel Comics)|Merlyn]] and his daughter, the Omniversal Guardian, [[Roma (comics)|Roma]] appear to the badly injured Brian. They give him the chance to be the superhero Captain Britain. He is offered a choice: the ''Amulet of Right'' or the ''Sword of Might''. Considering himself to be no warrior and unsuited for the challenge, he rejects the Sword and chooses the Amulet. This choice transforms Brian Braddock into Captain Britain.<ref name="cbweekly1">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Chris Claremont]] | Artist = [[Herb Trimpe]], [[Fred Kida]] | Title = Captain Britain Weekly | Issue = 1 | Date = Week ending October 13, 1976| Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref>

It is later revealed that Braddock is only one member of a much larger, inter-dimensional corps of mystical protectors. Every Earth in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Multiverse]] has its own Captain Britain who is expected to defend that version of [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and uphold its local laws. They are collectively called the [[Captain Britain Corps]]. Captain Britain protects "[[Earth-616]]" of the Marvel Universe.

===Early career as Captain Britain===
As his career as a superhero begins, Brian fights as the champion of Great Britain, often clashing with [[S.T.R.I.K.E.]] and Welsh anti-superhero police officer Dai Thomas. During one episode, he learns that his parents did not die in an accident, but rather were killed by the sentient computer [[Mastermind (computer)|Mastermind]]. He would develop a [[rogues gallery]] including the assassin [[Slaymaster]] and the crime matriarch Vixen. As time goes on, Brian begins fighting more supernatural enemies rather than regular supervillains.

Soon afterwards, Brian travels to America to study. By a strange twist of fate, he rooms with Peter Parker (the hero [[Spider-Man]]) at [[Empire State University]]. A brief misunderstanding caused Brian to battle Spider-Man, thinking he'd abducted his girlfriend (Courtney), before the two of them were captured by the assassin [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]] and became the first heroes to survive Murderworld.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #65-66</ref>

On a flight from America, he came under mental attack by the demonic Necromon, causing Brian to leap out of the plane; he spent two years as a hermit on the Cornish coast, repairing his psyche. He was eventually called to Merlyn's service again, fighting alongside the [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]] and the elf Jackdaw to defend [[Avalon (Marvel Comics)|Otherworld]] from Necromon. With his memories partially restored Brian and the Knight, allied with Vortigen the Proud Walker, battled [[Mordred (comics)|Mordred the Evil]]. Both the Black Knight and Captain Britain were snatched out of time to join the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]]’s [[Contest of Champions]], where Captain Britain fought against the [[Arabian Knight (comics)|Arabian Knight]], but they were soon returned to resume their quest. At the entrance to Otherworld Brian was slain by the spectral White Rider, and his corpse claimed by Mandrac, Nethergod Lord of the Slain and the Rider’s master, though Merlyn and the Knight swiftly recovered it. Merlyn reunited Captain Britain’s departed spirit with his body, resurrecting him. While the hero healed, Merlyn restored his remaining memories and informed him of the Nethergod’s involvement with his early foes. Now recalling Arthur’s location, the Black Knight, Captain Britain and Jackdaw were sent to awaken the King. Succeeding in this quest, Arthur then sent Brian and Jackdaw magically away through the dimensions, stating Brian had a destiny to fulfill elsewhere. As a reward, he and Jackdaw were sent back to Earth.

===Jaspers' Warp===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Marvel Super-Heroes387.jpg|thumb|150px|Captain Britain, prior to his execution, holding the corpse of Jackdaw, as the Fury looms above.]] -->
{{Main|Jaspers' Warp}}
With Necromon defeated, Merlyn merges the powers of the ''Amulet of Right'' and the ''Star Sceptre'' into a uniform to be worn by Braddock. Captain Britain is sent with Jackdaw to Earth-238, a dictatorship run by the British National Party, whose rule was enforced by the Status Crew, where he works with the extra-dimensional [[Saturnyne]] to jump-start the reality's development. 

Braddock witnesses this Earth's descent into madness at the hands of [[Mad Jim Jaspers]], loses Jackdaw, and is murdered by the monstrous [[Fury (Marvel Comics)|Fury]] before being resurrected back on Earth-616. This turns out to have been a deliberate plan by Merlyn to prepare him for the battle against the Jim Jaspers of Earth-616, a far more powerful being. Merlyn, who had previously resurrected Jackdaw, avoids doing so a second time to increase his chances of successfully reviving Captain Britain.

Brian would find himself saving his sister Betsy and the former Psi-Division of S.T.R.I.K.E. from his old enemy [[Slaymaster]], drafted by the mercenary group the [[Special Executive]] to save Saturnyne from a show trial, during which he witnessed the destruction of Earth-238's reality to prevent the Jaspers' Warp there from spreading out across the multiverse, and encountered members of the pan-dimensional [[Captain Britain Corps]], an organisation of Captain Britains from various dimensions. However, he and his assembled allies were unable to prevent Earth-616's Jim Jaspers from expanding his influence over Earth, and though Brian fought bravely it fell to the Fury to kill the villain - Roma is of the opinion Merlyn intended all along for Brian to lead the Fury to Earth-616 to do this, but this was unconfirmed.<ref>''[[The Mighty World of Marvel]]'' #13</ref>

===Post-Warp===

Following this and battles against conventional villains the [[Crazy Gang (comics)|Crazy Gang]], Slaymaster, and Vixen,<ref>''Captain Britain'' Vol. 2 #2-3</ref> Braddock was captured by [[Gatecrasher (Marvel Comics)|Gatecrasher]]'s [[Technet (comics)|Technet]] on behalf of [[Sat-Yr-9]], and then fought his interdimensional counterpart [[Captain Britain Corps|Kaptain Briton]].<ref>''Captain Britain'' Vol. 2 #4-6</ref> Brian is captured by [[Modred the Mystic]], and teams with [[Captain America]] to defeat Modred.<ref>''Captain America'' #305-306</ref> He also got caught up in the affairs of intelligence agency [[R.C.X.]], the British government's replacement for S.T.R.I.K.E. He also met his future lover [[Meggan]].

===Substituted===
Due to the pressures put on him after the Warp, Braddock travels abroad for a while.<ref>''Captain Britain'' Vol. 2 #9</ref>  R.C.X. recruits his sister [[Psylocke|Betsy]] to become Captain Britain while he is overseas, angering Brian enough to make him quit when he learns this upon his return. She manages in the role for a while, but unfortunately she proves no match for Slaymaster, who tears out her eyes. Aware of his twin's pain through their telepathic bond, Brian rushes back to fight Slaymaster, whom he eventually kills.  After this episode, Brian resumes the mantle of Captain Britain.<ref>''Captain Britain'' Vol. 2 #13</ref>  In real-world terms, these events took place over twelve pages across two issues, though more than five months pass for the characters while Betsy is Captain Britain. Their effect on Betsy, and her future with the [[X-Men]], was profound.

When the X-Men appeared to perish in Dallas (see ''[[Fall of the Mutants]]''), a group of heroes including [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], [[Shadowcat]], [[Rachel Summers|Phoenix III]], and [[Meggan]] joined Brian to form Excalibur - Great Britain's premier super-team - in an effort to continue the work of the X-Men. Excalibur fought Gatecrasher's Technet in their first meeting together.<ref>''Excalibur Special Edition'' #1</ref>

Brian was soon reunited with [[Courtney Ross]].<ref>''Excalibur'' #1</ref> He then first battled the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]].<ref>''Excalibur'' #2</ref> He clashed with old foes Arcade, and the Crazy Gang, and was caused to temporarily switch bodies with the Crazy Gang's Tweedledope.<ref>''Excalibur'' #4-5</ref> Brian also encountered and fought his other-dimensional Nazi counterpart [[Hauptmann Englande]].<ref>''Excalibur'' #9-11</ref> With Excalibur, he battled Arcade's "Loonies".<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #31-38</ref> With Excalibur, he battled [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], believing Thor to be Juggernaut due to [[Loki (comics)|Loki]]'s magic. Brian then journeyed with Thor into a dimension ruled by Juggernaut.<ref>''Thor'' #427-429</ref>

===Knights of Pendragon===
{{Main|Knights of Pendragon}}
During this period, [[Marvel UK]] launched a miniseries starring Captain Britain. It presented a much darker and mature version of Braddock as a part of the Arthurian myth than was found in Excalibur. In the first volume, Braddock teamed with police inspector '''Dai Thomas''', a regular from his old solo series, and journalist '''Kate McClellan'''. The three were investigating a series of grisly murders that were finally revealed to be the work of mythical creature the [[Green Knight]], a key character in Arthurian mythology. The series also implied a strong mystical connection between Braddock and the knight [[Lancelot]]. The series was not a huge seller, though it does retain a cult following.

===Identity crises===
Brian quits costumed adventuring for a time and concentrates on research, building the Midnight Runner for Excalibur. Eventually, he and Meggan become engaged. However, Brian, Meggan, and the rest of Excalibur are soon captured by the R.C.X. and Brian is severely beaten while resisting. Dying, broken and bloody, he is healed by Roma, who fixes the arcane circuitry in his costume to match his body's frequencies. She also removes the "blunder factor" she had secretly cast over him (a curse she had cast ensuring that he would need the help of the entire team until he saw the innate value in it). The evil members of R.C.X. are cleared out in a joint effort by Excalibur and the members of an internal mutiny.

Immediately afterward, Phoenix III reappears and Excalibur journeys into the future to save the world from the [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]]. On the way back, Brian is lost in the time-stream. Eventually, his body parts start reappearing in the same space as Rachel's - first his arms, then his chest - for brief flickers. Eventually, a rift is opened in which Brian and Rachel switch places. Rachel is flung to the far future to become the [[Askani#Askani in the future|Mother Askani]] and Brian returns home. He is flooded, however, with memories of the far future and remains disconnected from the real world. He calls himself "Britannic" for some time, but eventually re-acclimates himself to his old life. It changes slightly, as Excalibur moves to [[Muir Island]] and new members join the team. Brian has a prophetic vision concerning the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|London Branch of the Hellfire Club]]'s plan to take over the United Kingdom. Brian infiltrates the Club by claiming his father's position as Black Rook and, again with Excalibur's help, thwarts its efforts at domination.

===King of Otherworld===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Captain britain King otherworld.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Brian Braddock,<br>King of Otherworld.<br>Promotional art for ''Excalibur: Sword of Power''. Art by Pablo Raimondi.|{{Deletable image-caption|1=Sunday, 15 February 2009|date=May 2012}}]] -->
In a battle with the Dragons of the Crimson Dawn, Brian expends all of his power to stop a dimensional portal from opening. Having lost his powers, he leaves the team for some time, but returns to fulfill his dream of marrying Meggan. After the ceremony on Otherworld, the team disbands and its members return to the United States.

Brian soon finds work at the Darkmoor research facility. During one of his tests on the new blade and armor of his friend the [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]], [[Widget (comics)|Widget]] appears with warriors who begin to attack on Roma's behalf. The heroes (including Psylocke, who is also visiting England) drive the attackers off, then follow them to Otherworld where they discover that the Captain Britain Corps has been decimated. Together with the survivors - Crusader X and Captain UK - Brian and his comrades attempt to stop Roma from acquiring the Sword of Might. This, together with the Amulet of Right, would have the ability to remake the cosmos. Brian searches for the Sword but finds a computer-filled shrine in a cavern built by his father. A hologram of James Braddock, Sr. explains to Brian that he is the savior and rightful heir of Otherworld with the innate right to wield Excalibur. The hologram re-activates Brian's powers and as he draws the sword, a fiery cross (similar to the British flag) appears as a mask on his face. Brian then confronts Roma, who is revealed to be his father's sentient and insane computer Mastermind. With the aid of the real Roma, Braddock defeats the powerful computer. Roma then relinquishes control of Otherworld to Captain Britain. He and Meggan remain in Otherworld as effective rulers of the multiverse. Unbeknownst to Brian, the events leading up to his assumption of the Otherworld were orchestrated by [[Kang the Conqueror]], for reasons yet to be revealed.

In the "Lionheart of Avalon" storyline in ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'', the sorceress [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan Le Fay]] captures Brian and Meggan. Le Fay hopes that by killing Braddock and severing his mystical ties to the land, she will destroy all of Great Britain. However, Brian appears to [[Lionheart (comics)|Kelsey Leigh]], a British mother who dies protecting both her children and Captain America from the [[Wrecking Crew (comics)|Wrecking Crew]]. Braddock offers her the choice between the Amulet and the Sword and, feeling that she could better defend her children with a weapon, she chooses the latter. Although she is changed into a new Captain Britain, she remains cursed by the inability to ever reveal herself to her children. Because he transfers his power to Kelsey, the plan to destroy Britain fails.

===New Excalibur===
{{Main|Excalibur (comics)#New Excalibur (2005–2007)|l1=New Excalibur}}
Returning to Otherworld, Braddock and Meggan become rulers of the realm. However, Captain Britain is forced to come back to Earth to stop the [[House of M]] reality-shift from destroying all dimensions. During this time, his wife Meggan apparently sacrifices her life to close a rip in time that would have destroyed all existence. This results in Brian becoming active as Captain Britain again and the formation of a new Excalibur, along with [[Peter Wisdom]], [[Sage (comics)|Sage]], [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]], [[Dazzler]], and [[Nocturne (comics)|Nocturne]]. Captain Britain also believes his sister [[Psylocke]] to be dead, unaware that she has joined the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]].

He also assisted Pete Wisdom and British intelligence agency MI-13 in their battle against a Martian invasion.<ref>''Wisdom'' (MAX) #6</ref>

After the defeat of Albion by New Excalibur, Braddock is reunited with his sister and the Exiles in the miniseries [[X-Men: Die by the Sword]] before he is severely injured by Rouge-Mort.

===Captain Britain and MI: 13===
{{Main|Captain Britain and MI: 13}}
A new series, written by [[Paul Cornell]] and drawn by [[Leonard Kirk]], features Captain Britain, Pete Wisdom, and other British superheroes working for [[MI-13 (comics)|MI: 13]].<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=12826 Super Spy Weekend: Captain Britain], [[Comic Book Resources]], March 7, 2008</ref><ref>[http://www.comicsbulletin.com/features/120784245582350.htm The British Invasion: Paul Cornell on Captain Britain and MI: 13], [[Comics Bulletin]], April 10, 2008</ref><ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=12587 Cornell & Lowe talk "Captain Britain and MI:13"], [[Comic Book Resources]], February 18, 2008</ref> The series opened with a [[Skrull]] onslaught on Britain, part of the [[Secret Invasion]] crossover, that saw every British hero drafted into MI:13.

After fighting Skrull forces in London, Brian was dispatched with Pete Wisdom, [[John the Skrull]], and [[Spitfire (comics)|Spitfire]] to the [[Siege Perilous (comics)|Siege Perilous]] (a gateway to the Otherworld) to secure [[Avalon (Marvel Comics)|Avalon]] and thus the world's magic from Skrull conquest. Brian is left uncomfortable by having to kill Skrulls and being separated from the Corps, and simply desires to represent his country (believing, despite Wisdom's statements to the contrary, that he stopped doing so). When the Skrulls shot a missile at the Siege to destroy Earth's access to magic, he attempted to divert it and was killed in a vicious explosion <ref name="cbmi13-1">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Paul Cornell]] | Penciller = [[Leonard Kirk]] | Inker = Jesse Delperdang | Story = The Guns of Avalon | Title = Captain Britain and MI:13 | Issue = 1 | Date = July 2008| Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref> - every inhabitant of the United Kingdom became instantly aware of his death.<ref>''Captain Britain and MI:13'' #2</ref>

Captain Britain was once again resurrected by [[Merlin (Marvel Comics)|Merlin]] in the center of Britain, and after taking possession of the sword Excalibur, confronted the Skrulls in London; his resurrected form is stated by Merlin to be no longer plagued with doubts and a unified symbol of the United Kingdom, "like their flag, one thing that contains many!".<ref name="cbmi13-3">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Paul Cornell]] | Penciller = [[Leonard Kirk]] | Inker = Jesse Delperdang, Scott Hanna | Story = The Guns of Avalon | Title = Captain Britain and MI:13 | Issue = 3 | Date = September 2008| Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref> He has increased powers and theoretically has no limits, but this is reliant on his level of confidence - he can just as easily become weak and vulnerable.<ref>''Captain Britain and MI:13'' #5</ref> While he has chosen to work with MI:13 and their superhero team, he has stated that the superheroes will no longer kill.<ref>#4</ref>

In battle against Doctor Plokta, creator of the [[Mindless Ones]], he was temporarily trapped in Plokta's "Dream Corridor" - a magical construct trapping you in your heart's desire - where he briefly believed he had found Meggan again. He got free and defeated Plokta by forcing him into his own Corrider (presented as a supremely powerful act), but was left unaware that the real Meggan had tried to make contact and was now stuck in Hell.<ref>''Captain Britain and MI:13 #6-9''</ref> Later, however, during a conflict with Dracula, Dr. Doom gives Meggan to Dracula to use as a bargaining chip. After Captain Britain and MI13 defeat Dracula, Meggan and Captain Britain are reunited.{{Issue|date=May 2010}}

===Avengers===
During an international meeting between Steve Rogers and MI13, Captain Britain was offered a job with the Avengers. Captain Britain accepted despite mixed reactions from his MI13 teammates.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cornell|first=Paul|title=Age of Heroes|year=2010|publisher=Marvel comics|author=Leonard Kirk|location=New York|chapter=Diplomatic Incident}}</ref> Later, he become one of the new members of the [[Secret Avengers]].{{issue|date=November 2012}}

==Powers and abilities==
Originally, Captain Britain's powers were linked to the mystical ''Amulet of Right'', worn around his neck. When Brian Braddock rubbed the amulet he was transformed from an ordinary mortal into a superhero version of himself, complete with a more muscular physique. The amulet could also mystically replenish his superhuman energies.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} He also possessed a telescoping staff to vault. This also had other functions, the most heavily relied upon being the ability to project a force field. Later, Merlyn changed the staff into the mace-like ''Star Sceptre'', which he could utilize like a [[quarterstaff]] and which also gave him the ability of flight.<ref>''Captain Britain'' vol 1 no. 35</ref> Merlyn changed his costume just before he entered the alternate Earth-238, fusing the powers of the Amulet and the Scepter into the new uniform and then later put these powers within Brian himself when he was forced to rebuild Brian following Brian's death at the hands of the Fury, making the suit a regulatory device for his powers.<ref>''The Daredevils'' no. 1</ref> Eventually, Brian no longer required even the battle-suit for the full use of his powers, as his heritage of being the son of a denizen of the extra-dimensional Otherworld became enough to power him.<ref>''Captain Britain'' vol. 2 no. 13</ref>

Brian Braddock has [[superhuman]] strength, speed, stamina, durability, reflexes, senses, and the ability to fly at supersonic speeds. He also possesses enhanced perceptions that allow him to be aware of things others may miss (such as objects cloaked by spells of illusion).<ref>''The Daredevils'' no. 2</ref> When he and Meggan destroyed the Otherworld energy matrix at Roma's prompting{{Issue|date=November 2009}}, the energies that allowed him to retain his power within the UK without his costume were dissipated. Hence, to retain his powers anywhere on Earth, he must wear the costume at all times.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} His costume acts as an antenna and battery, allowing him to retain his powers wherever he goes.

However, the conditions of his power were once again changed during his death and resurrection in the first story arc of ''[[Captain Britain and MI: 13]]'' as explained by writer Paul Cornell,
{{quote|As we reveal in issue five, the limits of Brian's powers are now tied in to his emotions. So if he's feeling very determined and confident, then he's very powerful, but if he's losing it then he'll really be losing it. He's as strong as he used to be, and he can fly, and that's all due to his magical nature, not to his costume. I've always seen him as something like the [[Shazam (comics)|Shazam]] [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], a hero formed through magic. Which means the subjective nature of what he can now do feels apt to me. As he himself says about great feats depending on whether or not he can gather all his courage together, he says: 'well, I am Captain Britain.'<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=18038 And Hell Followed: Cornell talks Captain Britain & MI:13], [[Comic Book Resources]], September 18, 2008</ref>}}

Brian is the [[twin#Fraternal (dizygotic) twins|fraternal twin]] of [[Psylocke|Betsy Braddock]], a telepath, resulting in a strong psychic bond between the two. As described by writer [[Chris Claremont]] in the ''Uncanny X-Men'' [[House of M]] storyline, the two are in fact immune to each other's powers because of their genetic connection.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #462-465</ref>

In addition, Braddock is a brilliant [[scientist]] with a Ph.D. in physics.

==Other versions==
'''Captain Britain''' has been represented  in various incarnations, not exclusive to Brian Braddock.  In addition to other characters who have assumed the mantle of Captain Britain in the absence of Braddock, there have been several other versions of characters written to have originated from [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|alternate universes]].

===Mainstream depictions===
*'''Brian Braddock''' - becomes Captain Britain, after Merlyn gives him the Amulet of Right.
*'''[[Psylocke|Elizabeth "Betsy" Braddock]]''' - assumes the mantle of Captain Britain while Brian Braddock is away working for the covert British agency [[R.C.X.]]<ref>Captain Britain (vol. 2) #13. Art by Alan Davis.</ref>
*'''[[Modred the Mystic]]''' - briefly assumes the mantle of Captain Britain by syphoning off Braddock's energies in an effort to defeat Merlyn.<ref>Captain America vol. 1 #305</ref>
*'''[[Lionheart (comics)|Kelsey Leigh Kirkland]]''' - receives the Sword of Might from Braddock, after she is killed defending Captain America.<ref>Avengers vol. 3, #77 (March 2004)</ref>

===Alternate universe versions===
====Captain Britain Corps====
{{Main|Captain Britain Corps}}
Founded by Merlyn, the '''Captain Britain Corps''' are formed to defend the Multiverse.   Each member protected his or her reality based on their dimensional equivalent of Britain, and was powered by the friction between dimensions.  Prominent members aside from Braddock include Captain Albion and Captain UK.  The group includes multiple versions of Braddock, as well, including Captain England, Crusader X, and others named Captain Britain.

====Albion====
'''Bran Bardic''' is from a world ravaged by [[World War I|war]] for almost a century. This version of Braddock chose the Sword of Might over the Amulet of Right and would later travel to Earth-616 and ally himself with [[Black Air]] and [[Shadow-X]] before creating an army of Shadow Captains in an attempt to take over England and overthrow the Captain Britain Corps.

====Age of Apocalypse====
{{Main|Age of Apocalypse}}
In the Age of Apocalypse, Brian Braddock never becomes Captain Britain, and is one of the members of the Human High Council, alongside [[Moira MacTaggert|Moira Trask]], [[Bolivar Trask]], [[Emma Frost]], and [[Mariko Yashida]]. Braddock is also the most vocal advocate for the extermination of mutants, much to the weariness of Yashida and Frost, who seems much less fanatical in their beliefs. However, Braddock becomes the victim of a mind control device and is forced to act as a mole for [[Donald Pierce]] and his [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]], all servants of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. Under the control of Pierce, Braddock proposes the assembly of the entire Council fleet to attack Apocalypse's capital. Braddock dies at Pierce's hands when he overcomes his influence and refuses to kill Emma Frost.

In an alternate AoA timeline, from What If?: Age of Apocalypse, Captain Britain is a member of the Defenders (their version of the Avengers), and uses [[Iron Man]]'s armor. In this timeline, [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|Legion]] kills both [[Professor X]]avier and [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], therefore the [[X-Men]] never existed, so mankind's only hope lies with the Defenders. The other Defender members are [[Alternative versions of Wolverine#Age of Apocalypse|Weapon X]], the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] (using a metal prosthetic arm), [[X-Man]], [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], [[Brother Voodoo]], [[Molecule Man]], and [[Sauron (comics)|Sauron]], led by [[Captain America]] (who wields [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'s hammer, [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]]). During the final offensive against Apocalypse, Captain Britain loses his life fighting the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] (one of Apocalypse's Horsemen in this reality), who rips Britain's body apart.

==== Marvel Zombies ====
A zombie version of Captain Britain briefly appears in the miniseries ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'' while the [[Silver Surfer]] travels the globe. He also briefly appears in ''[[Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness]]'', having been zombified by the world-racing newly-infected Quicksilver.

====Ultimate Captain Britain====
{{Main|Ultimate Marvel}}
In the Ultimate Marvel Universe, Captain Britain is a member of the European Defense Initiative (the EU equivalent of the [[Ultimates]]), along with Captain Italy, Captain France, Captain Spain, and several unnamed members most likely from other European countries, all of whom have the same powers: flight, super strength, and a force field. All four of them developed their powers from the super powered exo-suits developed by Professor Sir James Braddock, who oversees the EDI super soldier program. Captain Britain and the other members of European Defense Initiative helped the Ultimates track down and contain Thor and they released the Fantastic Four, Spider-Man, and the X-Men during the Liberators' attack on America. They are also seen helping to pull up the Statue of Liberty after the battle is over.<ref>''Ultimates 2'' #13</ref>During [[Ultimatum (Ultimate Marvel)|Ultimatum]], Captain Britain (along with other Captains) is discussing how to take action against Magneto in the Houses of Parliament. However, [[Multiple Man]] bursts in and sets off a bomb, destroying the Houses of Parliament and everyone inside.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #99-100</ref>  His status is unknown on panel, although he was listed in the in memoriam section at the end of ''Ultimatium'' #5. He survived the attack at the Houses of Parliament, although he succumbed to the cancer caused by using one of the first versions of the Captain Britain suit, and his brother James took the mantle of Captain Britain.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Ultimates'' #1-5</ref>

Dr. Jamie Braddock is revealed to be the new Captain Britain in the [[Ultimates]].<ref>''Ultimate Fallout'' #6</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
* Captain Britain was briefly seen in the fourth part of the [[Dark Phoenix Saga|Phoenix Saga]] from the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' [[animated television series]], in the episode, "The Starjammers". Psylocke mentions him during "Beyond Good and Evil", though she merely says "my brother", hinting he's also a mutant in this continuity.

[[IGN]] ranked Captain Britain as the 79th greatest comic book hero of all time stating that, as he is the only Marvel hero to receive the benefit of Alan Moore's pen, the character enjoys very rarefied status in the Marvel universe.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/79 | title=Captain Britain is number 79 | publisher=[[IGN]] | accessdate=May 11, 2011}}</ref>

==Collected editions==
