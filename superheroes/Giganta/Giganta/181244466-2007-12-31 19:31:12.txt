'''Giganta''' is a fictional character, a red-haired super-villainess appearing in [[DC Comics]] publications and related media. A longtime enemy of [[Wonder Woman]] and an occasional foil for [[Atom (comics)|The Atom]], Giganta possesses the superhuman ability to increase her physical size and mass, effectively transforming into a [[giantess]]. Her first appearance (''Wonder Woman'' #9, volume 1, published in 1944), written by Wonder Woman creator [[William Moulton Marston]], presents her as a brutish strongwoman with no super powers other than unusual strength.  Later adaptations (including appearances on Hanna-Barbera's popular cartoon series [[Challenge of the Super Friends]] in the 1970s) introduced Giganta's size-changing ability, a feature of the character which has been retained to date.   

==Golden & Silver Age (comics)==
[[Image:Giganta-ww28.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Giganta in ''Wonder Woman'' #28]]
Giganta was introduced as a foe of the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] [[Wonder Woman]], first appearing in ''Wonder Woman'' #9 (volume 1). In the story, a villainous scientist named Professor Zool artificially evolves an ape named Giganta into a malicious red-haired strongwoman. Giganta is ultimately subdued and captured by Wonder Woman and taken to Paradise Island for rehabilitation.  In issue #28, she joins a rebellion of prisoners held on the island, thereby becoming a member of the criminal team [[Villainy Inc.]]

Giganta is not seen again in the comics until 1966, in ''Wonder Woman'' #163 (volume 1), in which her origin is revamped to include another member of Wonder Woman's rogues gallery, [[Doctor Psycho]]. This appearance also premiered a short-lived update to her look, giving her waist-length blonde hair and an even larger physical stature.

==Modern Age (comics)==
In the current [[DC Universe]], Giganta is Dr. Doris Zuel (a name that tips its hat to Professor Zool, a key figure in the Golden Age Giganta's origin). Appearing in the modern continuity for the first time in 1997 in ''Wonder Woman'' #127 (volume 2), Zuel captures a comatose Wonder Woman and holds her at a secret research facility. Suffering from a fatal blood disease, Zuel plans to use an experimental machine to transfer her "life-essence" into Wonder Woman's body. Interrupted by [[Wonder Girl]] halfway through the experiment, Zuel seemingly dies. Her assistant Branson discovers that Zuel is in fact not dead, but instead had her essence stored in the transference machine's buffer module, which then channeled her consciousness into one of the lab's test animals, a gorilla named Giganta.

Desperate to return her mind to a human body, Zuel/Giganta then abducts a comatose circus strongwoman named Olga. Though the subsequent events have never been detailed in the comics, Zuel apparently succeeds in transferring her mind into Olga's body, and most likely, Olga's mind into the body of the gorilla.

When she next appears, the red-haired Giganta demonstrates the ability to grow to [[metahuman|gigantic size]], like the animated ''[[Super Friends]]'' version. In ''Wonder Woman'' #1 (volume 3), it was revealed that Olga already possessed this power when Zuel stole her body. The source of the ability is unknown, though it may be related to a [[shamanism|shaman]] who placed Olga in a coma prior to her abduction by Zuel. Whatever the case, the ability appears to be mystical in nature, as Giganta has been shown (in [[Atom (comics)|The All-New Atom]]) to be aligned with the forces of magic.

Following her transformation, Giganta allies herself with [[Queen Clea]] and the modern encarnation of [[Villainy Inc.]] in an attempt to conquer the [[Lost lands|lost world]] of [[Hollow Earth|Skartaris]]. Villainy Inc. is defeated by Wonder Woman, but Giganta is subsequently seen as a member of several criminal groups, including the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] and [[Injustice League#Injustice League Unlimited|Injustice League Unlimited]]. As part of the Society, she takes part in the "[[Battle of Metropolis]]", a confrontation with mutliple heroes. The Soceity ultimately loses this battle. 

It was noted in ''Wonder Woman'' #2 (volume 3) that Giganta's intellect reduces as she grows in size, compelling her to become less rational and more prone to violence. Subsequent appearances seem to suggest that Giganta has overcome that limitation and retains her full intelligence at any size.

===One Year Later===

Giganta, along with [[Cheetah (comics)|The Cheetah]] and Doctor Psycho, engaged in a battle with [[Donna Troy]] (who has assumed the identity of Wonder Woman one year after the events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'') in ''Wonder Woman'' vol.3, #1, as part of a search for, as they term it, the "real" Wonder Woman (Diana of [[Themyscira]]). In the following issue, the villains continue their quest, holding Troy hostage in order to draw Diana out for a rescue attempt; they also contend with the current [[Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark)|Wonder Girl]], [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Robin]], and (though they don't realize it at first), Diana herself, in the guise of government agent Diana Prince.  In issue 3, Giganta and her allies also battle [[Hercules (DC Comics)|Hercules]], with the giantess being felled by the legendary champion.  

Giganta has also appeared in the pages of the ''The All New Atom'', currently employed as a regular teacher at Ivy Town's University. Infected and controlled by [[Great Old One|M'Nagalah]], the monstrous ''Cancer god'', she was sent to seduce and capture, [[Atom (comics)#Ryan Choi|Ryan Choi]], the new Atom, in the process even going so far as to swallow the miniature hero alive (he escapes). Now free of M'Nagalah's control, a seemingly repentant Dr. Zuel retains her position at Ivy University and has approached Ryan for a second chance, despite the bizarre circumstances of their first meeting.

Before their second date, the Atom is approached by Wonder Woman on behalf of the Department of Metahuman Affairs and asked to wear a wire on his date with Dr. Zuel. After professing her desire to reform, she is informed that Ryan is wearing a wire and tears off the roof of the restaurant to see Wonder Woman and Ryan talking - unaware that Ryan had removed the wire. A fight between Wonder Woman and Giganta ensues. Wonder Woman quickly managed to knock Giganta out but Ryan intervenes to stop her from beating her further, after admitting she had lost her temper - they realise that Dr. Zuel has disappeared. Whether she heard or saw Ryan's actions to stop her getting further injuries is yet to be seen. 

On the cover of ''[[Justice League|Justice League of America]]'' #13 (Vol.2), it shows Giganta as a member of the new [[Injustice League]] and is one of the villains featured in [[Salvation Run]].

==Powers and abilities==
Giganta has the ability to increase her size from roughly 6'6 to several hundred feet. These powers seemed to have been given to her magically since if it was by science she would not be able to achieve the size that she can become (as seen in [[Blue Beetle]] #19).
It is presumed she works out since Giganta also features strength greater than that of her body size. Her strength is higher then an average woman but it is not superhuman (until she begins growing).
Giganta is also a brilliant scientist who now retains her full intelligence at any size from normal to maximum.

==Other media==
===Super Friends TV series===
[[Image:Giganta sf.jpg|thumb|Giganta flexes her muscles in this shot from Hanna-Barbera's 1970s cartoon series Challenge of the Super Friends]]Giganta was first seen outside comics as a powerful member of the [[Legion of Doom (comics)|Legion of Doom]] in the [[1970s]] [[List of animated television series|animated series]] ''[[Super Friends]]''. In the TV series, she has the ability to grow to giant size (with accompanying [[superhuman]] strength) simply by willing it (at the time, she did not yet possess this ability in the comics). She typically dresses in a [[leopard]] skin two-piece [[loincloth]], presumably treating them so that they grow with her when she uses her powers to achieve her gigantic stature. She wears large, bangle-like [[bracelet]]s and [[anklet]]s, and she is always [[barefoot]]. Her muscular body is a side effect of her powers.  

In the ''[[Challenge of the Super Friends]]'' TV series, Giganta was a normal woman who was hiking through a forest when she witnessed [[Apache Chief]] using [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] dust. The latter used it to grow larger so he could fight off a grizzly bear. Giganta stole the dust and used it on herself, gaining the ability to transform into a powerful, 50 foot tall [[giantess]]. She didn't hesitate to use this new found power for [[evil]].

Giganta was voiced by Ruth Forman.

===Legends of the Superheroes===
[[Image:GigtantaAtom.jpg|thumb|Aleshia Brevard as Giganta]]
Giganta also appeared in ''[[Legends of the Superheroes]]'' played by Aleshia Brevard.

In keeping with the show's decidedly low budget, she doesn't showcase her ability to grow in size, and instead bends a prop steel bar around [[Riddler]]'s neck for a "superstrength" effect.

She returns in "The Roast" and is interviewed by "Rhoda Rooter" (who is an impression of gossip host [[Rona Barrett]]).  Rooter interviews Giganta and the [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]] about their recent engagement.

===Justice League TV series===
[[Image:Giganta jl.jpg|thumb|A super-sized Giganta squares off with Wonder Woman in this shot from the WB Animation series Justice League, 2004]]
Giganta also appeared in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' animated series in an episode featuring the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]], with an origin somewhat similar to that in the comics. In this version, she was a small female ape transformed by [[Gorilla Grodd|Grodd]] into a human woman who can grow to giant proportions. 

In "Secret Society," Giganta helped [[Shade (comics)|The Shade]] escape from the [[Justice League]]. During her first confrontation with the Justice League, she defeated Wonder Woman and even toppled the Man of Steel. Later at Gotham Field, [[Superman]] almost defeated her but she manipulated him by asking "Wouldn't hit a woman, would you?" Fortunately, [[Wonder Woman]] had no problem delivering the final blow.

===Justice League Unlimited===
[[Image:ToAnotherShore.jpg|thumb|Giganta in "To Another Shore]]
In the episode "Ultimatum" she attempted to break Grodd out of prison with the help of [[Bizarro]]; she manipulated him by playing his girlfriend. She was defeated by Wonder Woman and the similarly powered [[Ultimen]] member [[Long Shadow]] (who was himself a thinly veiled homage to Apache Chief).

She then becomes Grodd's devout follower and has, in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', become a member of the modern day [[Legion of Doom (comics)|Legion of Doom]]. While on a mission for Grodd as a backup, she ended up comatose after the [[Martian Manhunter]] tried to [[telepathy|read her mind]]. However, in the episode "The Great Brain Robbery", Giganta is seen among the rest of the Legion, apparently fully recovered. When the Legion became divided between [[Lex Luthor|Luthor]] and Grodd, she sided with Luthor, angry with Grodd for shutting off her mind and cheating on her with [[Tala (comics)|Tala]]. At the end of the series, Giganta sacrifices a few seconds of her allotted five minute head start reward (for helping the League) and plants a fast kiss on the [[Wally West|Flash]]. Giganta is voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]].

Unlike her more brutish characterization, in [[Justice League Unlimited]], Giganta acts in a more feminine manner, but is still eager for battle.

She appeared in [[Justice League Adventures|Justice League Unlimited]] #38, trying to go straight so she could spend time with The Flash.  She reveals her intentions angrily once he announces that he is going on a date.
