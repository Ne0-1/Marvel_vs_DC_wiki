'''Giganta''' (real name Doris Zuel) is a [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]]. She has appeared in [[comic books|comics]] and in TV adaptations. Her origin and powers have varied in different versions.

==Golden Age (comics)==

The original version of Giganta was a foe of the [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden Age]] [[Wonder Woman]], the evil (and grotesque) Dr. Doris Zuel, who tried to transfer her mind into Wonder Woman's 'perfect' [[Amazon]] body. The experiment failed, and Zuel was instead transferred into the body of a monstrous gorilla test specimen named Giganta.

Desperate to return her mind to a human body, Zuel/Giganta abducted a [[comatose]], beautiful red-haired 'strong woman' named Olga from a traveling [[circus]]. She apparently succeeded in tranferring her mind into Olga's body, and most likely, Olga's mind into the body of the gorilla (although the fate of Olga, the gorilla, and Zuel's original body have never been revealed).

==Modern Age (comics)==  
In the current DC universe, Giganta has gained the ability to grow to gigantic size, like the animated [[Superfriends]] version, although the origin of this ability has yet to be revealed.  Clea may be responsible for her ability.

==Super Friends TV series==

Giganta was first seen outside comics as a member of the [[Legion of Doom]] in the [[1970s]] [[animated cartoon|animated]] [[TV]] series ''[[Super Friends]]''. In the TV series, she has the ability to grow to giant size (with accompanying super strength) simply by willing it. She typically dresses in a [[leopard]] skin two-piece [[loin cloth]], presumably treating them so that they grow along with her when she uses her powers. 

In the Superfriends TV series she was hiking in the mountains and stumbled across the [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] dust used by [[Apache Chief]]. Giganta stole the dust and used it on herself, and was transformed into a powerful, 50 foot tall [[giantess]]. She didn't hesitate to use this new found power for evil.

==Justice League TV series==
Giganta also appeared in the ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'' animated series in an episode featuring the Injustice Gang, with her comics origin somewhat intact. In it, she was a [[monkey]] transformed by [[Gorilla Grodd]] into a human woman who can grow to large proportions. She has then become Grodd's devout follower and has become a member of the modern day [[Legion of Doom]]. While on a missions for Grodd as a backup, she ended up comatose after the [[Martian Manhunter]] tried to read her mind. She is voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]].
