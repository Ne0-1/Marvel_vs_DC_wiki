'''Giganta''' (Real name Doris Zuel) is a powerful [[DC Comics]] [[supervillainess]] with the ability to grow into a towering, incredibly strong [[giantess]]. She has appeared in [[comic books|comics]] and in TV adaptations. Her origin and powers have varied in different versions. (She should not be confused with ''[[Garganta]]'', a similar though more benign character in the [[AC Comics]] universe.)

==Golden Age (comics)==
[[Image:Giganta-ww28.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Giganta in ''Wonder Woman'' #28]]
The original version of Giganta was a foe of the [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden Age]] [[Wonder Woman]], first appearing in ''Wonder Woman'' Vol. 1 #9 where the ape Giganta is artificially evolved into a large red-headed human woman by Professor Zool.  After some complicated adventures she is eventually subdued by Wonder Woman and taken to Paradise Island for rehabilitation.  It is there that she joins a rebellion of prisoners in issue #28 who call themselves [[Villainy Inc.]]

Giganta is not seen again until issue #163 where her origin is revamped to include [[Doctor Psycho]] and she becomes even larger (though not yet a giant) and blonde. [http://www.dcindexes.com/database/story-details.php?storyid=19369]

==Modern Age (comics)==
In the current DC universe, Dr. Zuel first appeared in ''Wonder Woman'' (vol 2) #127 (Nov 1997), during a period when [[Wonder Woman]] was in a coma, and being kept at the experimental medical facility where Dr Zuel worked. Suffering from a fatal blood disease, she planned, much like her pre-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] self, to transfer her life-essence into the Amazon's body. They were discovered by the second [[Wonder Girl]] halfway through the experiment, and both women were declared dead. Subsequently her assistant, Branson, discovered Zuel's essence had been stored in the transference machine's buffer module, and put her in the body of one of the test animals, a gorilla named Giganta.

Desperate to return her mind to a human body, Zuel/Giganta abducted a comatose, beautiful [[red hair|red-haired]] 'strong woman' named Olga from a traveling circus. She apparently succeeded in transferring her mind into Olga's body, and most likely, Olga's mind into the body of the gorilla (although the fate of Olga, the gorilla, and Zuel's original body have never been revealed).

Giganta now possesses the ability to grow to [[metahuman|gigantic size]], like the animated ''[[Superfriends]]'' version. The origin of this new form and powers was not revealed in vol. 2 of ''Wonder Woman'', but according to issue #1 of vol. 3 Olga already possessed this power when Zuel stole her body.  It was further noted in issue #2 that Dr. Zuel formerly lost much of her intellect as she grew in size (becoming more brutish and prone to violence), but currently seems to have transcended that limitation and retains her full intelligence at any size.

==One Year Later==
{{spoiler}}

Giganta, along with [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]] and Doctor Psycho, engaged in a battle with [[Donna Troy]] (who has assumed the identity of Wonder Woman after the events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'') in ''Wonder Woman'' (3rd series) #1, as part of a search for, as they term it, the "real" Wonder Woman (Diana of Themyscria).  In the following issue, the villains continue their quest, holding Troy hostage in order to draw Diana out for a rescue attempt; they also contend with the current [[Cassandra Sandsmark|Wonder Girl]], [[Tim Drake|Robin]], and (though they don't realize it at first), Diana herself, in the guise of government agent Diana Prince.  In issue 3, Giganta and her allies will apparently battle [[Hercules (DC Comics)|Hercules]].

Giganta has also appeared in the pages of the ''The All New Atom'', currently employed as a regular teacher in Ivy Town's University. Infected and controlled by [[Great Old One|M'Nagalah]], the monstrous ''cancer [[Old High Ones|god]]'', she was sent to seduce and capture, Ryan Choi, the new [[Atom (comics)|Atom]].

==Other media==
===Super Friends TV series===
[[Image:Giganta_sf.jpg|thumb|Giganta flexes her muscles in this shot from Hanna-Barbera's 1970's cartoon series CHALLENGE OF THE SUPER FRIENDS]]Giganta was first seen outside comics as a member of the [[Legion of Doom]] in the [[1970s]] [[animated cartoon|animated]] [[TV]] series ''[[Super Friends]]''. In the TV series, she has the ability to grow to giant size (with accompanying [[superhuman]] strength) simply by willing it. She typically dresses in a [[leopard]] skin two-piece [[loin cloth]], presumably treating them so that they grow with her when she uses her powers to achieve her gigantic stature. She wears large, bangle-like [[bracelet]]s and [[anklet]]s, and always goes [[barefoot]]. Her muscular body is a side effect of her powers.  

In the ''[[Challenge of the SuperFriends]]'' TV series, Giganta was a normal woman who was hiking through a forest when she witnessed [[Apache Chief]] using [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] dust. The latter used it to grow larger so he could fight off a grizzly bear. Giganta stole the dust and used it on herself, gaining the ability to transform into a powerful, 50 foot tall [[giantess]]. She didn't hesitate to use this new found power for [[evil]].

Giganta was voiced by [[Ruth Forman]].

===Legend of the Superheroes===
[[Image:GigtantaAtom.jpg|thumb|Aleshia Brevard as Giganta.]]
Giganta also appeared in ''[[Legends of the Superheroes]]'' played by [[Aleshia Brevard]].

In keeping with the show's decidedly low budget, she doesn't grow to colossal size here, just bends a prop "steel" bar around [[Riddler]]'s neck for a cheap "superstrength" effect.

She returns in "The Roast" and is interviewed by "Rhoda Rooter" (who is an imperssion of gossip host [[Rona Barrett]]).  Rooter interviews Giganta and the [[Ray Palmer (comics)|Atom]] about their recent engagement.

===Justice League TV series===
[[Image:Giganta_jl.jpg|thumb|A super-sized Giganta squares off with Wonder Woman in this shot from the WB Animation series JUSTICE LEAGUE, 2004]]Giganta also appeared in the ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'' animated series in an episode featuring the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]], with an origin somewhat similar to that in the comics. In this version, she was a small female ape transformed by [[Grodd]] into a human woman who can grow to giant proportions (and referred to by him as "a good daughter"). In "Secret Society", Giganta helped [[Shade (comics)|Shade]] escape from the [[Justice League]]. During her first confrontation with the Justice League she defeated Wonder Woman and even toppled the man of Steel. Later at Gotham field, [[Superman]] almost defeated her but she manipulated him by asking "Wouldn't hit a woman, would you?", fortunately [[Wonder Woman]] had no problem delivering the final blow.[[Image:giganta.jpg|thumb| She has then become Grodd's devout follower and has, in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', become a member of the modern day [[Legion of Doom]]. While on a mission for Grodd as a backup, she ended up comatose after the [[Martian Manhunter]] tried to [[telepathy|read her mind]]. However, in the recent episode "The Great Brain Robbery", Giganta is seen among the rest of the Legion, apparently fully recovered. When the Legion became divided between [[Luthor]] and Grodd, she sided with Luthor, angry with Grodd for shutting off her mind. At the end of the series, Giganta sacrifices a few seconds of her allotted five minute head start reward (for helping the League) and plants a fast kiss on the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]]. She is voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]].
