'''Giganta''' is a fictional supervillain appearing in [[DC Comics]] publications and related media. A longtime enemy of [[Wonder Woman]] and an occasional foil for [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]], Giganta possesses the superhuman ability to increase her physical size and mass, effectively transforming into a [[giantess]].<ref name="dc-ency">{{Cite book | last = Greenberger | first = Robert | author-link = Robert Greenberger | contribution = Giganta | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page = 137 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-7566-4119-1 | oclc = 213309017 }}</ref>
Her first appearance (''Wonder Woman'' #9, volume 1, published in 1944), written by Wonder Woman creator [[William Moulton Marston]], presents her as a brutish strongwoman.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=McAvennie |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |title=DC Comics Year By Year: A Visual Chronicle |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-8578-6 |page=43}}</ref> Later adaptations (including appearances on [[Hanna-Barbera]]'s popular cartoon series ''[[Challenge of the Super Friends]]'' in the 1970s) introduced Giganta's size-changing ability, a feature which has been retained to date.

==Fictional character biography==
===Earth-Two===
[[Image:Giganta-ww28.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Giganta in ''Wonder Woman'' #28.]]
Giganta was introduced as a foe of [[DC Comics]] character [[Wonder Woman (Earth-Two)|Wonder Woman]] during the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]].<ref name=Guide>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=119}}</ref> In the story, a scientist named Professor Zool artificially mutates an [[ape]] named Giganta into a malicious red-haired strongwoman. The mutation machine goes haywire and somehow reverts the world to an earlier stage. Giganta joins a primitive tribe to attack Wonder Woman, but is defeated. When the world gets to the [[Golden Age]] of humanity, Giganta causes trouble by encouraging a rebellion, which Wonder Woman stops. When the world returns to normal, Giganta is still in her "strongwoman" form. Giganta is ultimately subdued and captured by Wonder Woman and taken to Themiscrya for rehabilitation.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #9. DC Comics.</ref>

Giganta joins a rebellion of prisoners held on the island started by the Saturnian slaver [[Eviless]], thereby becoming a member of the criminal team [[Villainy Inc.]] Eviless steals Wonder Woman's lasso and kidnaps Hippolyta. Giganta joins with the Atlantean [[Queen Clea]] to cause trouble.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #28. DC Comics.</ref>

===Earth-One===
In 1966, Giganta's origin is revamped to include [[Doctor Psycho]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dcindexes.com/database/story-details.php?storyid=19369 |title=Mike's Amazing World of DC Comics-The DC Indexes |publisher=Dcindexes.com |accessdate=2011-01-16 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927185732/http://www.dcindexes.com/database/story-details.php?storyid=19369 |archive-date=2007-09-27}}</ref> In this story, Doctor Psycho hypnotized a zoo gorilla named Giganta to fall in love with [[Steve Trevor]]. After [[Wonder Woman]] defeats Giganta, Professor Zool appeared asking to have the gorilla turned over to her for experimentation. Taking advantage of this, Doctor Psycho took Giganta out of the zoo and brought her to Professor Zool so that he can use an evolution ray on her. This turned Giganta into a huge blonde woman who still loves Steve Trevor. Wonder Woman defeated Giganta and took her to Paradise Island for rehabilitation.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #163. DC Comics.</ref>

===Doris Zeul===
The contemporary version of the character is the alter-ego of Dr. Doris Zeul,<ref>''Wonder Woman'' vol. 2 #127. DC Comics.</ref> who suffers from a fatal blood disease. She captures Wonder Woman and plans to put her "life-essence" into Wonder Woman's body using an experimental machine. Interrupted by [[Wonder Girl]] halfway through the experiment she ends up with her consciousness in a test animal gorilla named Giganta.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Desperate to return her mind to a human body, Zeul the [[gorilla]] abducts a comatose [[circus]] strongwoman named Olga with size-changing abilities<ref name=ww1>''Wonder Woman'' vol. 3 #1. DC Comics.</ref> through unknown means (though Olga was comatose due to a mysterious [[shaman]]) and uses the machine to successfully transfer her mind into that body, keeping the villain name "Giganta".

Following her transformation, Giganta allies herself with [[Queen Clea]] and the modern incarnation of [[Villainy Inc.]] in an attempt to conquer the [[Lost lands|lost world]] of [[Hollow Earth|Skartaris]].<ref>''Wonder Woman'' vol. 2 #179-183. DC Comics.</ref> Villainy Inc. is defeated by Wonder Woman, but Giganta is subsequently seen as a member of several criminal groups, including the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].<ref>''Infinite Crisis'' TPB. DC Comics.</ref>

As part of the Society, she takes part in the "[[Battle of Metropolis]]", a confrontation with multiple heroes, including [[Elasti-Girl]], the size-changing member of the [[Doom Patrol]]. The Society ultimately loses this battle.<ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #7. DC Comics.</ref>

When Diana Prince noted that Giganta's intellect reduces as she grows in size,<ref name=ww2>''Wonder Woman'' vol. 3 #2. DC Comics.</ref> compelling the villain to become less rational and more prone to violence, she was corrected by her colleagues in the Department of Metahuman Affairs. They implied that Giganta has overcome that limitation and retains her full intelligence at any size.<ref>''Wonder Woman Annual'' #1. DC Comics.</ref>

[[Image:GigantaNewCostume.jpg|thumb|Giganta in her ''One Year Later'' costume, which she continued to use until the ''New 52''.]]
"[[One Year Later]]," Giganta, along with [[Cheetah (comics)|The Cheetah]] and Doctor Psycho, engage in a battle with [[Donna Troy]] (who has assumed the identity of Wonder Woman one year after the events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]''), as part of a search for, as they term it, the "real" Wonder Woman (Diana of [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]]).<ref name=ww1 /> The villains continue their quest,<ref name=ww2 /> holding Troy hostage in order to draw Diana out for a rescue attempt and contend with the current [[Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark)|Wonder Girl]], [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Robin]], and Diana herself in the guise of government agent Diana Prince. Giganta and her allies also battle [[Hercules (DC Comics)|Hercules]], with the giantess being felled by the legendary champion.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' vol. 3 #3. DC Comics.</ref>

Giganta is a teacher at Ryan Choi's Ivy Town University.<ref>''The All New Atom''</ref> Infected and controlled by [[M'Nagalah]], the monstrous ''Cancer god'', she was sent to seduce and capture [[Ryan Choi]], the new Atom, in the process even going so far as to swallow the miniature hero alive (he escapes, and also discovers that she has a tongue piercing<ref>''All-new Atom'' #3. DC Comics.</ref>). Now free of M'Nagalah's control, a seemingly repentant Dr. Zeul retains her position at Ivy University and has approached Ryan for a second chance, despite the bizarre circumstances of their first meeting.

Before their second date, the Atom is approached by Wonder Woman on behalf of the Department of Metahuman Affairs and asked to wear a wire on his date with Dr. Zeul. After professing her desire to reform, she is informed that Ryan is wearing a wire and tears off the roof of the restaurant to see Wonder Woman and Ryan talking - unaware that Ryan had removed the wire. A fight between Wonder Woman and Giganta ensues. Wonder Woman quickly knocks Giganta out but Ryan intervenes to stop Wonder Woman from beating her further, after admitting she had lost her temper - they realize that Dr. Zeul has disappeared.<ref>''All-New Atom'' #17. DC Comics.</ref> Whether she heard or saw Ryan's actions to stop her from getting further injuries is yet to be seen.

Giganta is a member of the new [[Injustice League]]<ref>''Justice League Vs Injustice League'' tpb. DC Comics.</ref> and she is one of the villains featured in the [[Salvation Run]].<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Giganta is also a member of [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]], during the [[Final Crisis]] and is shown as a thrall of [[Darkseid]] alongside several other super-powered women. She is now called '''Gigantrix'''.<ref>''Final Crisis'' #3-4. DC Comics.</ref> Over the course of the series she fights as one of the new incarnations of the [[Female Furies]] with [[Wonder Woman]], [[Batwoman]] and [[Catwoman]]. She is possessed by the spirit of the fury [[Stompa]], and only freed when [[Supergirl]] smashes the skull-and-crossbones mask from her face.<ref>''Final Crisis'' #7. DC Comics.</ref>

Giganta is attacked by Diana while on her way to a date with Ryan Choi,<ref>''Wonder Woman'' Vol. 3 #36. DC Comics.</ref> implying that their relationship has survived despite earlier difficulties. Mellower than in her appearances in the ''All-New Atom'' series, she seems to accept and respect the shortcomings brought by their different lifestyles, going so far as to help Wonder Woman in a mission, reasoning that, with Ryan being a superhero, they should both be used to putting their heroics in front of their private lives.

Most recently, [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] hires her on as one of the new members of Secret Six.<ref>''Secret Six'' vol. 3 #21. DC Comics.</ref> The team also includes the shrinking killer, [[Dwarfstar]], who recently hired [[Deathstroke]] and his [[Teen Titans#Brightest Day: Titans – Villains for Hire|Titans]] to kill Ryan Choi. Giganta initially seems unaware of this fact, admitting to Dwarfstar that she is dating the Atom (much to Dwarfstar's amusement). Following a disastrous mission to [[Skartaris]], [[Amanda Waller]] reveals the details of Ryan's murder to Giganta. After luring Dwarfstar to her bedroom with the promise of sex, Giganta strips him of his belt (the source of his powers) and beats him into submission. She is last heard covering Dwarfstar's mouth with [[duct tape]] to stifle his screams, telling him that she plans on keeping him alive so that she can prolong his suffering.<ref>''Secret Six'' vol. 3 #28. DC Comics.</ref>

In September 2011, DC Comics revised the fictional history of its comic book line under the title "[[The New 52]]". In the revised comic book line, Doris Zeul was bullied as a child due to a rare blood disease. When she got older, Doris tried to cure herself using radiation which resulted in her gaining sizeshifting abilities.<ref>''Trinity of Sin: Pandora'' #10. DC Comics.</ref> Giganta appears as a member of the Secret Society during the "[[Trinity War]]" storyline. She assists [[Vandal Savage]] and [[Signalman (comics)|Signalman]] into tracking [[Pandora (DC Comics)|Pandora]]. When the three villains attack Pandora, Pandora successfully subdues Giganta. Her costume combines elements from her original and ''One Year Later'' costumes.<ref>''Trinity of Sin: Pandora'' #2. DC Comics.</ref>

After her first encounter with Pandora, Giganta returns for revenge following the conclusion of the ''[[Forever Evil]]'' storyline. During their fight, Pandora looks into Giganta's soul, and reveals her origin story. Doris Zeul was a bullied child with a blood disease, but cured herself with a radical procedure that gave her her growth powers. A side-effect of the untested operation was that it reduced her intellect.<ref>''Trinity of Sin: Pandora'' #10. DC Comics.</ref>

Giganta is later recruited by agents of [[S.H.A.D.E.]] to serve as a supernormal asset, fighting vampires and other monsters. She is tempted by the offer of a pardon for her crimes almost as much for the chance to kill things, which she admits to enjoying.<ref>''Trinity of Sin: Pandora'' #14. DC Comics.</ref>

After the events of "[[DC Rebirth]]," Giganta appeared alongside several other villains as they battled the [[Justice League]].<ref>''Justice League'' #10 (Jan 2017). DC Comics.</ref>

Later, Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor tracked Giganta down to a Los Angeles museum. Giganta had been stealing mystical artifacts for unknown reasons. Wonder Woman managed to defeat the giantess. She was then taken into custody.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #31 (2017). DC Comics.</ref> When Steve Trevor interrogated Giganta in Belle Reve alongside Amanda Waller, he discovered that Giganta had been recruited by Darkseid to steal the artifacts. She told Steve Trevor where to find the remaining artifacts. She stated that she, Steve, and Wonder Woman have had a long history together.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #36 (2018). DC Comics.</ref>

Giganta was then recruited by Amanda Waller into [[Suicide Squad|Task Force XL]] in order to capture the powerful creature known as [[Damage (DC Comics)|Damage]]. During the battle, Giganta revealed that she would love to study Damage's physiology. However, Damage burst through Giganta's hand, leaving her to bandage herself while the rest of the team battled the creature.<ref>''Damage'' #2 (2018). DC Comics.</ref>

In the "[[Watchmen]]" sequel "[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]]," Giganta is among the villains that attend the underground meeting held by Riddler that talks about the Superman Theory. When [[Comedian (comics)|Comedian]] crashes the meeting, Giganta attacks him as the villains start to scatter.<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #6 (July 2018). DC Comics.</ref> Later on, she takes part in the attack led by [[Black Adam]] against the United Nations, where she is beaten back by Wonder Woman.<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #10-11 (July-November 2019). DC Comics.</ref> Giganta was with Black Adam's group when the People's Heroes, the Outsiders, and the Doomed tried to get to Superman and gets into an all-out battle with them until it is broken up when [[Doctor Manhattan]] undoes the experiment that erased the [[Justice Society of America]] and the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]].<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #12. DC Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Giganta has the ability to increase her size from 6'6" to several hundred feet. These powers seem to have been given to her magically since the magical power stealing [[Black Alice (comics)|Black Alice]] is able to copy her powers.<ref>''Helmet of Fate: Black Alice'' #1. DC Comics.</ref>

Though strength and durability are not at superhuman level until she grows, she is still a formidable foe possessing some training in personal combat. As a giant, she is strong and durable enough to take on Wonder Woman.

Giganta's suit is specialized to grow with her and enhances her invulnerability. Even at normal size, it is bulletproof and resistant to extremes of heat and cold.

Some versions of Giganta in the stories where she appears are presented as scientists with genius-level intellect. The Post-Crisis version suffered diminished intelligence when she changed size.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' Vol. 3 #2. DC Comics.</ref>

==Other versions==

===Odyssey===
In the 'Odyssey' storyline that ran through issues 601-614 of ''Wonder Woman'', Giganta was one of many characters re-imagined in the alternate reality created by the goddess [[Nemesis (mythology)|Nemesis]]. She was part of a trio - along with [[Artemis of Bana-Mighdall]] and [[Cheetah (comics)#Barbara Minerva|Barbara Minerva]] - of dead Amazons resurrected by the [[Morrigan]] to hunt Wonder Woman.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #606. DC Comics.</ref>

Giganta possessed no size-altering power, instead relying upon enormous natural strength (enough to shatter a stone statue<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #607. DC Comics.</ref> and throw a [[school bus]]<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #608. DC Comics.</ref>) and a double-headed [[axe]] to fight. She dressed in Amazonian battle-garb decorated with [[leopard]] print, in a callback to her original costume, and stood over six feet tall.

Giganta is eventually won around to Diana's side after being shown the truth of the Morrigan's lies.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #610. DC Comics.</ref> She joins her in attacking their stronghold, killing [[Bellona (goddess)|Bellona]] with her axe even as her flesh is melted from her bones by the goddess' magic.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #611. DC Comics.</ref>

===Justice===
Giganta was featured as a member of the [[Legion of Doom]] in [[Alex Ross]]' maxi-series ''[[Justice (DC Comics)|Justice]]''. Here she is in her traditional costume, though she briefly disguises herself as a nurse and wears hunting gear in her first appearance. She attempts to assassinate the Atom in his office using a sniper rifle, but Palmer is distracted by a phone call and is instead hit in the shoulder. Later in the hospital, Giganta tries to smother the Atom to death with a pillow, though he escapes using his belt and knocks Giganta out a window by getting in her eye. Later, when the Legion toast their apparent victory, she is seen talking with [[Gorilla Grodd]] about his suspicions towards [[Lex Luthor]] and [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]]'s goals. When the Justice League storm the Hall of Doom itself, Giganta fights the League as a whole rather than any particular target. In the end she is defeated by [[Elasti-Girl|Rita Farr]] of the [[Elasti-Girl|Doom Patrol]]. Her origin is more in-line with that of her Golden Age and [[DC animated universe]] counterparts, having originally been a gorilla altered into a human, though she has no known connections with Gorilla Grodd or Gorilla City itself.

===Flashpoint===
In the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' universe, two conflicting versions of Giganta existed. In [[Lois Lane]]'s tie-in miniseries, she joined with the [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazons]]' [[Female Furies|Furies]], as they had taken over the [[United Kingdom]], and ambushed the resistance.<ref>''Flashpoint: Lois Lane and the Resistance'' #2 (July 2011). DC Comics.</ref> Here her appearance resembled that of her 'Odyssey' counterpart, and she seemingly possessed no super-powers. She was last seen fighting against [[Grifter (comics)|Grifter]] on [[London Bridge]], parrying his gunshots with twin swords.<ref>''Flashpoint: Lois Lane and the Resistance'' #3. DC Comics.</ref>

Conversely, in [[Hal Jordan]]'s miniseries, Giganta appears in her traditional, original costume, and is capable of growing large enough to grasp and crush [[fighter jets]] in her hands. When she is about to kill Hal while he struggles to control his damaged plane, Giganta is shot in the eyes by [[Carol Ferris]], collapsing and playing no further role in the fight.<ref>''Flashpoint: Hal Jordan'' #3 (August 2011). DC Comics.</ref>

===The Legend of Wonder Woman===
Giganta was set to appear in the second volume to ''The Legend of Wonder Woman'', a retelling of Wonder Woman's origins by Renae de Liz and Ray Dillon. However, DC cancelled the project under unknown circumstances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2016/12/15/dc-comics-cancels-legends-of-wonder-woman-vol-2-half-way-through-being-created/|title=DC Comics Cancels Legend Of Wonder Woman Vol 2, Half Way Through Being Created - Bleeding Cool News And Rumors|date=15 December 2016|website=bleedingcool.com|accessdate=8 April 2018}}</ref> De Liz later posted preliminary artwork featuring Giganta on [[Twitter]].<ref>{{cite tweet|user=RenaeDeLiz|author=Renae De Liz|number=809602415267901441|date=16 December 2016|title=(Priscilla Rich/Cheetah design not final)}}</ref>

[[Image:Giganta sf.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Giganta as seen in ''[[Challenge of the Super Friends]]''.]]
* Giganta appears in ''[[Challenge of the Super Friends]]'', voiced by Ruth Forman. She appears as a member of the [[Legion of Doom]]. In the TV series, she has the ability to grow into a 50-foot-tall giantess simply by willing it (at the time, she did not yet possess this ability in the comics). She typically dresses in a [[leopard]] skin two-piece [[loincloth]] (which grows with her when she uses her powers to achieve her gigantic stature), wears large, bangle-like [[bracelet]]s and [[anklet]]s, and she is always barefoot (like her original appearances). In her giantess form, she has superhuman strength and a more muscular body. In the episode "History of Doom", it was revealed that Giganta was once an unnamed normal woman who stole the growth powder that gave Apache Chief his powers.{{citation-needed|date=July 2020}}

* Giganta appears in the ''[[Super Friends (1980 TV series)|Super Friends]]'' episode "Two Gleeks are Deadlier Than One," voiced again by Ruth Forman. {{citation-needed|date=July 2020}}

[[Image:Giganta jl.jpg|right|thumb|A super-sized Giganta squares off with Wonder Woman in ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]''.]]
* She appears in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' episode "Secret Society", voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]]. This version has an origin somewhat similar to the Earth-Two and Earth-One versions that were evolved from a gorilla by Professor Zool. Unlike her more brutish characterization in the comics, Giganta acts in a more feminine manner in the Justice League cartoons, but is still eager for battle according to an interview with Hale. While she still has red hair and blue eyes, she does not wear a leopard skin, but a dress, complete with earrings and bracelet that increases in size when she grows. According to [[Gorilla Grodd|Grodd]], she was once a small female ape that Grodd transformed into the woman she is now, whereupon she became Grodd's devoted follower and a member of his [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]].<ref name=secret>{{Cite episode|title=Secret Society |url=http://www.tv.com/justice-league-unlimited/secret-society-1/episode/212544/recap.html?tag=episode_recap;recap |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130205000703/http://www.tv.com/justice-league-unlimited/secret-society-1/episode/212544/recap.html?tag=episode_recap;recap |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-02-05 |series=Justice League |network=Cartoon Network |airdate=November 22, 2003 |season=2 |number=43 & 44 }}</ref> In "Secret Society", Giganta recruits [[Shade (character)|Shade]] into Grodd's Secret Society. In his discussion with [[Clayface]], Grodd revealed that he created Giganta from a gorilla. Upon hearing this, The Shade glances at her eating a [[banana]] and simply shrugs and smiles at her, showing that he doesn't mind overall. During her first confrontation with the Justice League, she manages to defeat Wonder Woman with help from [[Killer Frost]] and later topples the Man of Steel. In the ambush of the other Justice Leaguers, she attempts to catch Martian Manhunter with her hands, but is unable due to Jonn's phasing abilities. Then at Gotham Field, [[Superman]] is being beaten badly by her, but manages to escape. Giganta is seen using her huge size as an advantage to step on and smash the Man of Steel. When he finally is about to strike back, she manipulates him by asking "Wouldn't hit a woman, would you?" Fortunately, [[Wonder Woman]] has no problem delivering a blow which knocks her out.<ref name=secret />

* Giganta appears in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "Ultimatum" with Jennifer Hale reprising her role of Giganta. She attempts to break Grodd out of prison with the help of [[Bizarro]] (whom she manipulates by pretending to be his girlfriend). She is defeated by Wonder Woman and the similarly powered Ultimen member Long Shadow (who was himself a thinly veiled homage to [[Apache Chief]]).<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Ultimatum |url=http://www.tv.com/justice-league-unlimited/ultimatum/episode/348267/recap.html?tag=episode_recap;recap |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130205002032/http://www.tv.com/justice-league-unlimited/ultimatum/episode/348267/recap.html?tag=episode_recap;recap |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-02-05 |series=Justice League Unlimited |network=Cartoon Network |airdate=December 4, 2004 |season=1 |number=9 }}</ref> While on a mission for Grodd as a backup to retrieve the [[Viking Prince]]'s corpse, she ends up comatose after [[Martian Manhunter]] tries to read her mind, which triggered a mind implant by Grodd which would prevent the Secret Society members from being questioned. Wonder Woman also gives her the nickname "Jumbo" which Giganta apparently does not like.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=To Another Shore |url=http://www.tv.com/justice-league-unlimited/to-another-shore/episode/482001/recap.html?tag=episode_recap;recap |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130205063722/http://www.tv.com/justice-league-unlimited/to-another-shore/episode/482001/recap.html?tag=episode_recap;recap |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-02-05 |series=Justice League Unlimited |network=Cartoon Network |airdate=September 24, 2005 |season=2 |number=30 }}</ref> However, in the episode "The Great Brain Robbery", Giganta is seen among the rest of the Secret Society, apparently fully recovered.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=The Great Brain Robbery |url=http://www.tv.com/justice-league-unlimited/the-great-brain-robbery/episode/485198/recap.html?tag=episode_recap;recap |series=Justice League Unlimited |network=Cartoon Network |airdate=March 4, 2006 |season=2 |number=34 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091010141534/http://www.tv.com/justice-league-unlimited/the-great-brain-robbery/episode/485198/recap.html?tag=episode_recap%3Brecap |archive-date=2009-10-10}}</ref> When the Secret Society becomes divided between [[Lex Luthor|Luthor]] and Grodd, she sides with Luthor angry with Grodd for having manipulated her brain when she was angrily confronting Grodd and squeezing him. Tala blasts her with a magic bolt, but Giganta is apparently not damaged as she is seen soon slapping Silver Banshee out of the air. Parasite attempts to take her vast strength, but Sinestro stops him. When [[Darkseid]] attacks the remaining members of the Society, she argues with the Justice League to fight alongside them, going with [[Green Lantern]] and [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] to defend Paris. At the end of the series, Giganta sacrifices a few seconds of her allotted five-minute head start reward (for helping the League) to plant a quick kiss on [[Wally West|Flash]].

* Giganta made a non-speaking cameo appearance in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "Powerless". Her appearance was only in a hypothetical scenario when [[Captain Atom]] discussed how [[Batman]]'s lack of superpowers made him vulnerable to supervillains. In the brief scene, Batman threatens to stop Giganta's rampage only for her to calmly step on him.

* Giganta appears in ''[[DC Nation Shorts]]: Wonder Woman''.

* In the ''[[Robot Chicken DC Comics Special]]'', Giganta was voiced by [[Alex Borstein]].

* Giganta appears in the ''[[DC Super Hero Girls]]'' TV special "[[DC Super Hero Girls: Super Hero High|Super Hero High]]" and its short sequel "New Beginnings", voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]].

* Giganta appears in the 2019 ''[[DC Super Hero Girls (TV series)|DC Super Hero Girls]]'' TV series, voiced again by Grey DeLisle. She is portrayed as biracial in this version, with a Caucasian father and an African-American mother and slightly overweight. An injection of a serum stolen from her parents' lab grants her growth/strength powers, which manifest themselves when she becomes angry. She is described as a large, rude, rowdy, selfish, lazy, aggressive, obnoxious, scruffy, mean-tempered and gluttonous bully with a cynical personality and a huge hatred for superheroes. Uncouth and vindictive, even with her friends, she is generally the most lonely of them. She is so easily irritated to the point of absurdity. Another recurrent trait of her personality is her evident sport fanaticism, reflecting mostly on her distinctive ''[[Tom Brady]]'' autographed football which she considers as her most prized possession, her mother lovingly nicknaming her "sports monkey", and some of her catchphrases being sport-themed including "Strike!" and "Home run!". In an interview, DeLisle called the character "the best villain [of the show]", and "that fish-eyed neighbor who you say good morning just on one of her really down days, and then makes sure you don't commit the same mistake ever again".

* Giganta also appears in ''[[Harley Quinn (TV series)|Harley Quinn]]'', voiced by [[Vanessa Marshall]]. She first appears in the episode "So You Need a Crew?", being interviewed in a late night talk show along with [[Doctor Psycho]] and their son Herman. She suddenly announces that she is leaving Psycho after revealing that he used his mind-control to make her love him. As she leaves with Herman, Psycho angrily calls her the "[[Cunt|C-word]]" much to everyone's shock and Psycho's own frustration like he did in a previous battle with Wonder Woman. In "You're a Damn Good Cop, Jim Gordon", Doctor Psycho and [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]] track down an online personality called the "Cowled Critic" after they slandered them. Their subsequent investigation takes them to Giganta's house, though she denies being the Cowled Critic before comparing Psycho unfavorably to her new boyfriend, Brad. The two later learn that the Cowled Critic was actually Herman, whom Psycho reconciles with.

===Live action===
[[Image:GigtantaAtom.jpg|left|150px|thumb|[[Aleshia Brevard]] as Giganta in ''[[Legends of the Superheroes]]''.]]
* Giganta also appeared in ''[[Legends of the Superheroes]]'' played by [[Aleshia Brevard]]. In keeping with the show's decidedly low budget, she doesn't demonstrate any ability to grow in size and instead bends a prop steel bar around [[Riddler]]'s neck for a "super strength" effect. She returns in "''The Roast''" and is interviewed by "Rhoda Rooter" (who is an impression of gossip host [[Rona Barrett]]). Rooter interviews Giganta and the [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]] about their recent engagement. Wonder Woman did not appear in this special due to the television series on CBS.

* In the ''[[Wonder Woman (TV series)|Wonder Woman]]'' episode "Wonder Woman vs. Gargantua," a gorilla named '''Gargantua''' (performed by Mickey Morton) is based on the gorilla form of Giganta. Gargantua was trained by Erica Belgard (portrayed by [[Gretchen Corbett]]) to attack Wonder Woman and was eventually brought to the United States, to bring back defector Conrad Steigler (portrayed by [[John Hillerman]]). Gargantua climbed up to Steigler's hotel room, knocking out several MPs in the process, and brought Steigler to Hans Eichler (portrayed by [[Robert Loggia]]) so that he can have him be brought to [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|High Command]]. Having trained him to fight Wonder Woman, Belgard wanted to take the opportunity to capture her also so that she can be brought to High Command as well. So they set up a trap and sent Gargantua on her. Before he could finish the task, Gargantua was shot by an MP and brought to Dr. Osmond. Osmond was able to undo Belgard's programming of Gargantua. But the Nazis took Gargantua back and gave him electro-shocks while looking at a picture of Wonder Woman (in hopes that it would restore the programming). He was subdued by Wonder Woman when they met again and the reprogramming failed. Feeling empathy for Gargantua after Belgard and Eichler were apprehended, Wonder Woman couldn't let him spend the rest of his life in a cage. So she broke Gargantua out and returned him to Africa.
