'''Reptil''' is a character from [[Marvel Comics]]. He is best known as a supporting member on ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]''.

==Fictional character biography==
Humberto Lopez is a young boy who had registered with the [[Fifty State Initiative]] and was living with his grandfather. When [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] scientist [[Valerie Cooper]] was putting together a squad to go after [[Stegron]] in his plot to reanimate dinosaur fossils, [[Tigra]] was placed in charge of the squad and was told to recruit Humberto to help them. Tigra was worried since Humberto hadn't gone through training yet. When going after Stegron, Humberto explained about his parents and how he got his powers.

His parents were paleontologists that dug up a crystallized bone then he was with them in the desert. The medallion had weird energy that had to do with dinosaurs in it. Under the codename Reptil, Humberto used it to obtain the abilities of any dinosaur by thinking of it and even had an empathy to sense dinosaurs and other reptiles.

Upon arrival in [[Camp Hammond]], Reptil went through training for a couple of days. While going through training with different members of the Initiative, Reptil learns to good and bad parts of the Initiative. Tigra tells Reptil that being a hero is a responsibility. Reptil tells her that his parents disappeared a year ago on a dig and wants to become a hero to use the heroic tools and equipments to find them.

With the help of [[Baron Von Blitzschlag]] attaching some type of neron device to increase [[Humbug (comics)|Humbug]]'s empathy, the team locates Stegron. When discovering that Stegron and his dinosaur herd are going to attack a S.H.I.E.L.D. base in South Dakota, Tigra's group intercepts them. However, Stegron took control of [[Komodo (comics)|Komodo]]'s mind and told her to attack her teammates. Reptil acts all hot-headed and impulsive during the fight and attacks Stegron, but is beaten down. Stegron and his dinosaur herd escape. Reptil suffers a mild concussion and Dr. Cooper tells him that his rash behavior allowed Stegron to escape and he endangered the lives of his teammates. Tigra speaks to Dr. Cooper in private and asks her to give Humberto one more chance to go out on the field. Valerie tells Tigra that if Reptil messes up, then his career with the Initiative would be over. Tigra speaks to Humberto a few days later and reminds him to stay balanced and not to overcommit. She tells him that everyone has problems and that he is lucky enough to be in a position to learn from other's mistakes and his own.

When it comes to a S.H.I.E.L.D. base in Wyoming, Stegron's dinosaurs are taken down by a combination of good teamwork and Reptil's abilities. It turns out that Stegron was attacking various S.H.I.E.L.D. bases to located [[Moon-Boy]] (who had been captured from the [[Savage Land]]). Stegron was only targeting Moon-Boy so that he can gain control of [[Devil Dinosaur]]. Reptil tells Tigra that Moon-Boy is innocent and doesn't deserve this. Tigra tells Reptil there is something they can do but he has to make a tough choice. Tigra tells the S.H.I.E.L.D. scientist and agents that Moon-Boy was eaten by one of the dinosaurs and Reptil was sent home because he just got in the way and was completely useless.

What they don't know is that Reptil managed to fly out with Moonboy and take him back to his home to Nevada. Tigra meets Humberto there and they are soon greeted by [[Ka-Zar]] and his pet [[smilodon]] [[Zabu]]. Ka-Zar thanks Tigra and Reptil for bringing Moon-Boy back to him safely and invites Reptil to take Moon-Boy back to the Savage Land. After Moon-Boy is reunited with Devil Dinosaur, Ka-Zar tells Reptil that he will help him find his parents.

==Powers and abilities==
Reptil wears a crystallized bone medallion that allows him to take on the abilities of different dinosaurs just by thinking about them. He cannot fully transform into a complete dinosaur but can shapeshift various parts of his body into different dinosaur appendages like a tail to strike enemies, changing his arms into [[pterodactyl]] wings, or having claws like a Raptor. He possesses the strength and ability of whatever dinosaur he is using.

Reptil also has some empathy abilities with dinosaurs and other reptilian creatures. He can sense other reptiles, but he cannot control them or influence its behavior at this time.

The medallion he wears has some unknown energy and whether the item is mystical in nature remains to be seen.
