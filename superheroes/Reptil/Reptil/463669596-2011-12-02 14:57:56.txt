'''Reptil''' is a character from [[Marvel Comics]]. He is best known as a supporting member on ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]'' and a member of [[Avengers Academy]] in the comics.

==Fictional character biography==
Humberto Lopez is a young boy who had registered with the [[Fifty State Initiative]] and was living with his grandfather. When [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] scientist [[Valerie Cooper]] was putting together a squad to go after [[Stegron]] in his plot to reanimate dinosaur fossils, [[Tigra]] was placed in charge of the squad and was told to recruit Humberto to help them. Tigra was worried since Humberto hadn't gone through training yet. When going after Stegron, Humberto explained about his parents and how he got his powers.

His parents were paleontologists that dug up a crystallized bone when he was with them in the desert. The medallion had a strange energy in it that had to do with dinosaurs. Under the codename Reptil, Humberto used it to obtain the abilities of any dinosaur by thinking of it and even had an empathy to sense dinosaurs and other reptiles.

Upon arrival in [[Camp Hammond (comics)|Camp Hammond]], Reptil went through training for a couple of days. While going through training with different members of the Initiative, Reptil learns the good and bad sides of the Initiative. Tigra tells Reptil that being a hero is a responsibility. Reptil tells her that his parents disappeared a year ago on a dig and wants to become a hero to find them.

With the help of [[Baron Von Blitzschlag]] attaching a device to increase [[Humbug (comics)|Humbug]]'s empathy, the team locates Stegron. When discovering that Stegron and his dinosaur herd are going to attack a S.H.I.E.L.D. base in South Dakota, Tigra's group intercepts them. However, Stegron took control of [[Komodo (comics)|Komodo]]'s mind and told her to attack her teammates. Reptil acts hot-headed during the fight and attacks Stegron, but is beaten down. Stegron and his dinosaur herd escape. Reptil suffers a mild concussion and Dr. Cooper tells him that his rash behavior allowed Stegron to escape and he endangered the lives of his teammates. Tigra speaks to Dr. Cooper in private and asks her to give Humberto one more chance to go out on the field. Valerie tells Tigra that if Reptil messes up, then his career with the Initiative would be over. Tigra speaks to Humberto a few days later and reminds him to stay balanced and not to over-commit. She tells him that everyone has problems and that he is lucky enough to be in a position to learn from other's mistakes and his own.

When it comes to a S.H.I.E.L.D. base in Wyoming, Stegron's dinosaurs are taken down by a combination of good teamwork and Reptil's abilities. It turns out that Stegron was attacking various S.H.I.E.L.D. bases to locate [[Moon-Boy]] (who had been captured from the [[Savage Land]]). Stegron was only targeting Moon-Boy so that he can gain control of [[Devil Dinosaur]]. Reptil tells Tigra that Moon-Boy is innocent and doesn't deserve this. Tigra tells Reptil there is something they can do but he has to make a tough choice. Tigra tells the S.H.I.E.L.D. scientist and agents that Moon-Boy was eaten by one of the dinosaurs and Reptil was sent home because he just got in the way and was completely useless.

What they don't know is that Reptil managed to fly out with Moonboy and take him back to his home to Nevada. Tigra meets Humberto there and they are soon greeted by [[Ka-Zar]] and his pet [[smilodon]] [[Zabu]]. Ka-Zar thanks Tigra and Reptil for bringing Moon-Boy back to him safely and invites Reptil to take Moon-Boy back to the Savage Land. After Moon-Boy is reunited with Devil Dinosaur, Ka-Zar tells Reptil that he will help him find his parents.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}

===Heroic Age===
Soon after this, Reptil is captured and taken to the USA and imprisoned in a government facility. Under the orders of Norman Osborn, experiments are performed on Reptil in an attempt to see if enough stress could turn his whole body into a dinosaur until the word of Norman Osborn's fall. As the agents of the H.A.M.M.E.R. began destroying all the evidence about Norman's clandestine and illegal projects, Reptil manages to escape as the agents were ready to murder him. As Reptil escapes the facility he is approached by Justice and Hank Pym who invite him to become part of the [[Avengers Academy]].<ref>''Enter the Heroic Age'' #1 (May 2010)</ref>
Along with the other students, all of them having been somehow affected by Norman Osborn, Reptil is told that they are the most promising of the heroes Osborn sought out. During their first training session, the students notice the staff arguing about them. By accessing secret computer files, the students realize that they have been chosen for the academy because they have the greatest potential to go rogue.<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #1 (June 2010)</ref>

During a battle, [[Mentallo]] takes control of Reptil's mind and forces him to fly headfirst towards the ground. The threat of imminent death allows Reptil to fully transform into a dinosaur. This saves Reptil's life because Mentallo can't control the dinosaur's reptilian mind. However Reptil can not control himself in this form either. His teachers think that his tendency to repress his troubles instead of dealing with them is the reason for his lack of control. They want him to accept help, but he is reluctant to talk to staff of the academy. Since the best superhuman therapist [[Doc Samson]] is gone, they ask [[Jessica Jones]] to talk to him. He opens up to her and they talk about many of the things that have been troubling him including his parents, but he keeps his concerns about his fellow students and the academy itself private.<ref name=AA6>''Avengers Academy'' #6 (November 2010)</ref>

When [[Korvac]] returns, Reptil and his fellow studies are placed into future versions of their bodies to fight him by Korvac's estranged lover, Carina. After Korvac is defeated, Reptil finds himself trapped in his older body.<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #11-12 (March-April 2011)</ref> On a day trip to New York, the students run afoul of [[Arcade (comics)|Arcade]], during which Reptil meets [[Anya Corazon|Spider-Girl]], and they quickly become friends.<ref>''Giant-Sized Avengers Academy'' #1 (May 2011)</ref> Spider-Girl attends Academy's "prom night". When she tells him that she liked him the way he was, Reptil reverts to his teenage body.<ref>''Avengers Academy #13 (May 2011)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Reptil wears a crystallized bone medallion that allows him to take on the abilities of different dinosaurs just by thinking about them. He initially cannot fully transform into a complete dinosaur but can shapeshift various parts of his body into different dinosaur appendages like a tail to strike enemies, changing his arms into [[pterodactyl]] wings, or having claws like a Raptor. However, after briefly possessing the body of his future self in a fight against Korvac, he retains the ability to fully transform.  He possesses the strength and ability of whatever dinosaur he is using and his skin always turns red and scaly whenever he uses his abilities.

Reptil also has some empathy abilities with dinosaurs and other reptilian creatures. He can sense other reptiles, but he cannot control them or influence their behavior at this time.

His amulet is magical in nature and recently embedded itself into his chest. Not much is known about it except that it is not actually the source of his powers, but only the catalyst that allows him to use them.<ref name=AA6/>

==In other media==
===Television===
* Reptil first appears in ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]'' episode "To Err is Superhuman" voiced by [[Antony Del Rio]]. Captain America brings him onto the team as its latest member. He does have some doubts after nearly being taken down by [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]] and the [[Wrecking Crew (comics)|Wrecking Crew]], but manages to overcome them to rescue [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]. In "A Brat Walks Among Us", he impresses Brynnie Bratton with his dinosaur abilities. He also does a play by play for the heroes and villains' struggles to claim Brynnie until Reptil claims her from [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]]. In "Night in the Sanctorum", it is revealed that he lives with his parents and his room is decorated with pictures of every superhero (except for [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]]). In "This Forest Green", he is talented at making a quesadilla dish called the Reptilla Quesadilla Supremos which he shows to [[Ms. Marvel]]. In "Tales of Suspense" Reptil plays golf with Wolverine against MODOK and Abomination. In "Mysterious Mayhem at Mutant Academy," Reptil accompanies Wolverine to [[X-Mansion|Xavier Academy]] to meet the X-Men. At the same time, [[Ringmaster (comics)|Ringmaster]] infiltrates the school and hypnotizes the [[X-Men]] into helping him find the Infinity Fractal. Reptil managed to break the hypnosis on the X-Men. Wolverine and Reptil don't know it yet, but Ringmaster's dowsing rod was later pointing toward Reptil's medallion, meaning that his medallion could be a Fractal. This is confirmed in "This Al Dente Earth" where it turned out that Reptil's medallion was actually an Infinity Fractal sent through time. Reptil gives it up so that the Infinity Sword can be reforged. At the end of the episode, Reptil claims that he couldn't be a hero anymore until saying "Brachiosaurus Tail" turned him into a full Brachiosaurus as Iron Man stated that Reptil's prolonged exposure to the Infinity Fractal caused Reptil to retain his powers. In "Too Many Wolverines," it is shown that Reptil goes to the same school as [[Amadeus Cho]] and [[Firestar|Angelica Jones]] (who unbeknownst to Reptil at the time is actually Firestar).
