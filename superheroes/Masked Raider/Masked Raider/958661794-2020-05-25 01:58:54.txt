The '''Masked Raider''' is an alias of several fictional characters appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The original character went by the name of Jim Gardley and appeared in [[comic book]]s published during the 1930s and 1940s period known as the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]], he was created by writer and artist [[Al Anders]]. Jim Gardley was a gunslinger and former rancher active during the [[American frontier]], he was one of the few individuals that held the [[Eternity Mask]] for a short period.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Howe |first1=Sean |title=Marvel Comics: The Untold Story |date=2013 |publisher=Harper Perennial |isbn=978-0061992117 |chapter=Chapter 1}}</ref> In Marvel Comics #1000, it was revealed how the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] Masked Raider died and a new character, yet unidentified, had taken up the name and was in the possession of the Eternity Mask. 

==Publication history==
Created by writer-artist [[Al Anders]], Jim Gardley [[first appeared]] in the [[Timely Comics]]' anthology series ''[[Marvel Mystery Comics|Marvel Comics]]'' #1 (Oct. 1939), and ran through issue #12 (Oct. 1940) of the by-then retitled ''Marvel Mystery Comics''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nevins |first1=Jess |title=Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes |date=2013 |publisher=High Rock Press |isbn=978-1-61318-023-5 |pages=175-176}}</ref>

The first [[Western comics|Western]] character published by Timely, the predecessor of [[Marvel Comics]], the Masked Raider is Jim Gardley, who with his horse Lightning dedicates his life to fighting the lawless and bringing justice to the oppressed.

He is unrelated to the [[Charlton Comics]] series ''[[Billy the Kid (Charlton Comics)|Billy the Kid]]'', which for its first eight issues was titled ''Masked Raider''.

In the milestone issue Marvel Comics #1000, the comic aimed to celebrate the long history of Marvel Comics, in which it was shown that the long-forgotten original character had died and a new [[Legacy hero|legacy character]] had taken up the ''Masked Raider'' mantle and was in the possession of ''Eternity Mask'', a powerful mask that various characters over the course of history have worn (Jim Gardley wearing the Eternity Mask instead of a normal mask was a retcon in Marvel Comics #1000, to tie various disparate parts of Marvel continuity together). The yet-unnamed superhero reappeared in the ''[[Incoming! (comics)|Incoming!]]'' one-shot.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/marvel-incoming-masked-raider-watcher/|title=Marvel Transforms a C-List Hero Into a Badass New Watcher|last=Matadeen|first=Renaldo|website=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=January 6, 2020|accessdate=May 25, 2020|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200107144330/https://www.cbr.com/marvel-incoming-masked-raider-watcher/|archivedate=January 7, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Marvel Comics announced in 2019 that a new ''Masked Raider'' series would be published in 2020 with the new hero.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://bleedingcool.com/comics/marvel-comics-publish-the-masked-raider-2020/|title=After 80 Years, Marvel to Publish "Masked Raider" Comics Again|last=Johnston|first=Rich|website=[[Bleeding Cool]]|date=July 16, 2019|accessdate=April 22, 2020}}</ref> 

==Reception==
In ''American Comic Book Chronicles'', Kurt Mitchell and [[Roy Thomas]] write that the Masked Raider is "a lifeless [[Lone Ranger]] imitation."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mitchell |first1=Kurt |last2=Thomas |first2=Roy |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: 1940-1944 |date=2019 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490892 |page=43}}</ref>
