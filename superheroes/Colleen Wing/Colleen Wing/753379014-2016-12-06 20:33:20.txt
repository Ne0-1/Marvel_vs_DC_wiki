==Fictional character biography==
Colleen was born in the mountains of Honshu, Japan, to Professor Lee Wing (a teacher of Asian history at [[Columbia University]]) and a mother whose ancestors were [[samurai]] and [[daimyo]]. After her mother's death, Colleen's late maternal grandfather, Kenji Ozawa taught her the ways of the samurai, in which she later became very skilled. Professor Wing learned from a monk that young warrior [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] would come from that land to seek vengeance on his father's killer and sent Colleen to meet him. Professor Wing and Colleen befriended Iron Fist, and Colleen has acted as his ally in many of his exploits.

Upon arrival, she got caught in a gun battle by the local Manhattan police and some thugs. Luckily, she was rescued by officer [[Misty Knight]], who eventually became her best friend. Later, when Knight's right arm was severely injured by a bomb explosion and was amputated, Colleen encouraged Knight to rise above her depression and return to an active role in life. Colleen and Knight formed a partnership as private investigators and called their firm Nightwing Restorations, Ltd.<ref>''Iron Fist'' #1</ref> Due to Wing's samurai-style training and both partners' expertise in the Asian martial arts, they were dubbed "the Daughters of the Dragon."
