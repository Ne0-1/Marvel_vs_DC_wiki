==Publication history==
{{Expand|section|date=July 2009}}
Colleen Wing first appeared in ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #19 (November 1974), and was created by [[Doug Moench]] and [[Larry Hama]].

==Fictional character biography==
Colleen's father is Professor Lee Wing, a teacher of Asian history and culture at New York Columbia University. Her mother was an unnamed Japanese woman, whose ancestors were samurai (warriors) and daimyo (feudal lords). Colleen's late maternal grandfather, Kenji Ozawa, was the head of Japan's secret service, and has been succeeded in that position by his brother.

Colleen grew up in the Northern regions of Japan, more specifically in the mountains of Hoshu. She was raised by her grandfather Kanji.<!-- or Kenji --> The reason for that is because Colleen's mother was killed apparently very early in her childhood. Her grandfather taught her the ways of the samurai, in which she later became very skilled.

Professor Wing learned from a monk who had been to the other-dimensional realm of [[K'un-L'un]] that a young warrior, [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], would come from that land to seek vengeance on his father's killer,{{Issue|date=July 2009}} who was now based in New York (Iron Fist finally chose not to take the life of his father's murderer.) Professor Wing calculated when Iron Fist would come to New York and sent Colleen to meet him.{{Issue|date=July 2009}} Professor Wing and Colleen befriended Iron Fist, and Colleen has acted as his ally in many of his exploits.

In Colleen's first appearance, she met [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]],<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #19</ref> and she then aided Iron Fist in battling the Cult of Kara-Kai.<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #22</ref>

Colleen Wing, as a detective, and Knight formed a partnership as private investigators and called their firm Knightwing Restorations, Ltd.{{Issue|date=July 2009}} Due to Wing's samurai-style training and both partners' expertise in the Asian martial arts, they have been dubbed "the Daughters of the Dragon."{{Issue|date=July 2009}}
