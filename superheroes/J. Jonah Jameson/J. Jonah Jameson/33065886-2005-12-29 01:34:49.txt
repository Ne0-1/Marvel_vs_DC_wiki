'''J. Jonah Jameson''' is a [[fictional character]] featured in the [[Marvel Universe|Marvel Comics universe]]. He is the [[publisher]] of the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'', a [[New York City]] [[newspaper]], and ''Now Magazine''.  He first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #1 (March 1963), and has been a prominent member of [[Spider-Man]]'s supporting cast ever since.  His first name has never been revealed, but it is possibly "John," as in the name of his son [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]].

Jameson has a short black [[mustache]] and chomps on an ever-present [[cigar]].  He is a flamboyant skinflint who belligerently micromanages his employees while bearing a stubborn hatred of Spider-Man.   

Jameson seems to be modeled on the American [[yellow journalism]] tycoons of the 1890s and 1900s, particularly [[William Randolph Hearst]]. ''Spider-Man'' creator [[Stan Lee]] once said that people seemed to have the impression that he himself was much like Jameson, and some have noted that the character bears some physical resemblance to him. Additionally, Stan Lee has declared, on more than one occasion, that he would have relished the opportunity to portray Jameson in a live-action film.

==Biography==
===Early life===
[[Image:Tangled Web 20.jpg|Cover to ''Tangled Web #20''. Art by Dean Haspiel.|thumb|left]]
According to "Behind the Moustache," a story featured in ''Spider-Man's Tangled Web'' #20 (January 2003), he was born to '''David and Betty Jameson'''. His father was an officer of the [[United States Army]], a war veteran decorated as a hero; at home, however, he regularly [[abuse]]d his wife and son. As a result, Jameson grew convinced that ''"No one's a hero every day of the week"'' and ''"Even the real heroes can't keep it up all the time"''. He was a [[Boy Scout]] during his childhood. In high school his interests were mainly [[boxing]] and [[photography]]. He met his first wife, Joan, when they both joined their high school's photo club. When the school's three top atheletes started [[bullying]] him, he fought back and beat all three of them to a pulp. This impressed Joan, and they started dating. They married as soon as they finished school.

After school, Jameson sought employment as a [[journalist]]. According to ''[[Marvels]]'' #1, he found employment in the Daily Bugle and bragged to his colleagues that he would one day run the newspaper. In 1939 he was witness to the first appearances of Jim Hammond, the android [[Human Torch]], and Namor McKenzie (aka [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]], Prince of [[Atlantis]]), who are jointly considered Marvel's first [[superhero]]es. Jameson was immediately skeptical of both of them; he doubted that someone with superhuman powers who operated outside the law could be trusted. When the [[United States|USA]] joined [[World War II]] in 1941, Jameson served as a war journalist in [[Europe]]. ''Sergeant Fury and His Howling Commandos'' #110 featured him as covering a mission of Sergeant [[Nick Fury|Nicholas Fury]], head of a team of [[commando]]s during the war (and later agent and eventually director of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], a fictional secret agency playing an important role in the Marvel Universe.)

After the war, he and Joan had a son, John. When Jameson returned from a journalistic mission covering the [[Korean War]] ([[June 25]], [[1950]] - [[July 27]], [[1953]]) he was grieved to find that his wife had died in a [[Robbery|mugging]] incident during his absence. Focusing on his professional life to dull the pain, he was eventually promoted to chief editor of the Daily Bugle, and eventually came to own the paper.

Jameson gained a mostly deserved reputation for journalistic integrity, but his greedy opportunism and unyielding, belligerent stubbornness made him more than a few enemies.

===Jameson and Spider-Man===

Those flaws became most obvious when Spider-Man became a [[news media|media]] sensation. Jameson strove to blacken Spider-Man's reputation; casting the masked hero as an unhinged [[vigilante]] not only boosted the ''Bugle'''s circulation, but also punished Spider-Man for overshadowing Jameson's astronaut son.  When Spider-Man tried to counter the bad press by rescuing his son from danger, Jameson vindicatively accused the hero of staging the situation for his own benefit. 

This episode set a pattern with Jameson's and Spider-Man's typical relationship: Jameson publicly accusing Spider-Man of numerous crimes and misdeeds, only to feel continually obliged to print almost as many retractions after being proven wrong. Jameson refused to accept responsibility for his unprofessional conduct, however, and blamed Spider-Man for trying to ruin him. While he would never admit it, Jameson was jealous of Spider-Man's selfless heroism, to the point that, despite all [[evidence]] to the contrary, he convinced himself that the hero had some hidden, sinister agenda. Even while Spider-Man saved his life and those of his loved ones numerous times, his determination to find some flaw in the hero only increased.

Jameson posted rewards for Spider-Man's capture or [[secret identity]], hunted him with Spencer Smythe's [[Spider-Slayer]] robots, and even commissioned super-powered agents to defeat the masked man. He hired a private detective called Mac Gargan, put him through a regimen of [[gene therapy|genetic enhancement]], and transformed him into the [[Scorpion (comics)|Scorpion]] &mdash; who soon went [[insane]] and turned on his benefactor.  Although Spider-Man has protected Jameson from this monster, Jameson kept his role in creating the Scorpion secret for years. He was even so foolish as to create another superbeing, who turned into a minor supervillain, the Fly, who had his own vendetta against him.

For all his hostility towards Spider-Man, he needs pictures of his heroics to sell papers, and Peter Parker soon took advantage of that by taking pictures of himself as Spider-Man and selling them to the Bugle with few questions asked.

In ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #162 (November 1976), Jameson first introduced himself to Dr. Marla Madison, a distinguished scientist and daughter of a deceased friend of his. He asked for her help in creating a new Spider-Slayer, one of a series of [[robot]]s created to defeat Spider-Man, although the latter has managed to survive their attacks and destroy each one of them. Madison was interested in the challenge, and joined Jameson in his efforts. The two eventually grew closer and got married in ''Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #18. Jameson remains a devoted, if a little over-protective, husband to his second wife. The two have also [[adopt]]ed their niece, Mattie Franklin, who, unbeknownst to her aunt and uncle, is also [[Spider-Woman]].

The guilt for creating the Scorpion caught up with Jameson when the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]] [[blackmail]]ed him about it. When he received the threats, rather than succumb to the Hobgoblin, Jameson chose instead to reveal it to the world in a public [[editorial]]. He stepped down as the ''Bugle'''s Editor-in-Chief, delegating the post to his immediate subordinate, [[Joseph Robertson]], but remained as publisher.

To his credit, Jameson has also been a tireless crusader for [[civil rights]] and [[labor rights|labor union rights]]. He has even stood up for mutant rights, despite his dislike of superhuman individuals. He has also come to Peter's aid financially, although on the sly, and has repeatedly gone after [[organized crime]] and corrupt officials, despite repeated threats and attempts on his and his staff's lives.

==Other media adaptations==
[[Image:Jksimmonsjonahmovie.jpg|325px|J.K. Simmons as Jameson in '''Spider-Man 2'''.|thumb]]
Jameson has been a regular character in almost all adaptations of ''Spider-Man''.

The 1960s [[animated series]] contained the most negative depiction with the character, voiced by Paul Kligman, as an egotistical loudmouth who automatically accuses Spider-Man of any crime, even when the evidence clearly contradicts him.

Subsequent depictions have portrayed the character as more sympathetic, particularly in the 1990s animated series, in which he was voiced by [[Ed Asner]]. In this series, Jameson's hatred of Spider-Man is based less on his powers and more to his wearing a mask &mdash; in this continuity, his wife was killed by a masked gunman.

The character's live action appearances were performed by [[David White_(actor)|David White]] in the [[television movie]], [[Robert F. Simon]] in the subsequent [[television series]], and [[J. K. Simmons]] in the [[Spider-Man (movie)|feature film]].

In the movie, Jameson retains his dislike for Spider-Man, but is basically a good, loyal man; under the right circumstances, he would die to protect others, and - at some level - knows that Spider-Man is a hero.

==Comparisons==
Jameson has both similarities and differences with the [[Superman]] mythos' [[Perry White]] (the editor of Superman's alter ego, [[newspaper]] [[reporter]] Clark Kent.) Like White, Jameson is a crusader, even an idealist in his own way, and the two men have a similar passion for cigar smoking, although White - unlike Jameson - kicked the smoking habit after being diagnosed with [[lung cancer]]. Jameson, however, is considerably more rigid, and prefers the world to "make sense" to his own points of view (regardless of whether his point of view squares with the facts.) Unlike White, it is unlikely that Jameson would react well to the news that one of his star staff members was a costumed superhero.

==Trivia==
* In the alternate reality of ''[[Earth X]]'', everyone on Earth has been affected by the [[Terrigen Mists]], granting everyone super powers. Jameson is turned into a [[donkey]]; literally, he becomes a jackass.
