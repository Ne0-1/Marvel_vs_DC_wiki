'''John Jonah Jameson, Jr.'''<ref>[http://www.comicvine.com/j-jonah-jameson/29-1487/ J. Jonah Jameson (Character)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> is a [[supporting character]] of [[Spider-Man]] in the {{Marvel Universe}}.

Jameson is usually the [[publisher]] or [[editor-in-chief]] of the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'', a fictional [[New York City|New York]] newspaper and once served as the mayor of [[New York City]]. Recognizable by his [[toothbrush moustache]], [[flattop]] haircut, and ever-present [[cigar]], he carries out a [[smear campaign]] against Spider-Man that has, at least temporarily, turned much of the gullible city against the hero. He employs [[photojournalism|photojournalist]] Peter Parker, who, unbeknownst to Jameson, is Spider-Man himself.

Portrayals of Jameson have varied throughout the years. Sometimes he is shown as a foolishly stubborn and pompous skinflint who micromanages his employees and resents Spider-Man out of jealousy. Other writers have portrayed him more humanly, as a humorously obnoxious yet caring boss who nevertheless has shown great bravery and integrity in the face of the assorted villains with which the ''[[Daily Bugle|Bugle]]'' comes into contact, and whose campaign against [[Spider-Man]] comes more from fear of youngsters following his example. In either case, he has remained an important part of the Spider-Man mythos.

Jameson is also the father of [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]], the [[Marvel Universe]] supporting character who, in addition to his job as a famous astronaut, has at turns become Man-Wolf and Star-God, and married [[She-Hulk]].

As a result of his father's wedding to [[Aunt May|May Parker]], Jameson and [[Peter Parker]] are related by marriage.

Academy award-winning actor [[J. K. Simmons]] portrayed the character in [[Sam Raimi]]'s [[Spider-Man in film|''Spider-Man'' trilogy]], as well as in various additional works such as ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]'', ''[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|Avengers Assemble]]'', ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', ''[[Lego Marvel Super Heroes: Maximum Overload]]'' and ''[[Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.]]''.

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=March 2015}}
Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]], Jameson first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #1 (March 1963). Stan Lee stated in an interview on [[Talk of the Nation]] that he modeled J. Jonah Jameson as a much grumpier version of himself.<ref>Conan, Neal (October 27, 2010). [http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130862700 "Stan Lee, Mastermind Of The Marvel Universe"]. [[NPR]].</ref>

==Fictional character biography==

===Background===
According to ''Behind the Mustache'', a story featured in ''[[Spider-Man's Tangled Web]]'' #20 (January 2003), Jameson was raised as a child by David and Betty Jameson. David was an officer of the [[United States Army]], a war veteran decorated as a hero; at home, however, David regularly [[domestic violence|abused]] his wife and son. As a result, J. Jonah Jameson grew convinced that "No one's a hero every day of the week" and "Even the real heroes can't keep it up all the time." Later issues of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' clarified that David Jameson was in fact Jonah's foster father, and the brother of J. Jonah Jameson Sr., Jonah's biological father, who had to leave his son behind for undisclosed reasons. It is unknown if Jameson Jr. remembered him.

He was a [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scout]] during his childhood. In high school, his interests were mainly [[boxing]] and [[photography]]. He met his first wife, Joan, when they both joined their high school's photo club. When the school's three top athletes started [[bullying]] him, he fought back and beat all three of them to a pulp. This impressed Joan, and they started dating. They married as soon as they finished school.

After school, Jameson sought employment as a [[journalist]]. According to ''[[Marvels]]'' #1, he found employment in the ''Daily Bugle'' and bragged to his colleagues that he would one day run the newspaper. In 1939, he witnessed the first appearances of Jim Hammond, the android [[Human Torch (android)|Human Torch]], and [[Namor]], Prince of [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlantis]], who are jointly considered Marvel's first [[superhero]]es. Jameson was immediately skeptical of both of them; he doubted that someone with superhuman powers who operated outside the law could be trusted. When the [[United States|U.S.A.]] joined [[World War II]] in 1941, Jameson served as a war correspondent in Europe. ''Sergeant Fury and His Howling Commandos'' #110 featured him as covering a mission of Sergeant [[Nick Fury|Nicholas Fury]], who was heading [[Howling Commandos|a team of commandos]] during the war.

After the war, he and Joan had a son, John Jonah III, who grew up to become an astronaut. When Jameson returned from a journalistic mission in [[Korea]], he was grieved to find that his wife had died in a [[Robbery|mugging]] incident during his absence. Focusing on his professional life to dull the pain, he was eventually promoted to chief editor of the ''Daily Bugle'', and eventually came to own the paper, thereby fulfilling his earlier boasts.

Jameson gained a mostly deserved reputation for journalistic integrity, but his greedy opportunism and unyielding belligerent stubbornness made him more than a few enemies.

Due to real-world time advancement Jameson's war-time experiences have since either been ignored or retconned.

===Spider-Man===
When Spider-Man becomes a [[news media|media]] sensation, Jameson strives to blacken Spider-Man's reputation; casting the masked hero as an unhinged [[vigilante]] not only boosts the ''Bugle'''s circulation, but also punishes Spider-Man for overshadowing Jameson's astronaut son. When Spider-Man tries to counter the bad press by rescuing his son from danger, Jameson accuses the hero of staging the situation for his own benefit.<ref>''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #1</ref> (A [[retcon]] had Jameson first targeting Spider-Man after John is dropped from a [[talk show]] to make room for the hero)<ref>''Amazing Fantasy'' #18 by [[Kurt Busiek]]</ref>

This episode sets a pattern with Jameson's and Spider-Man's relationship: Jameson publicly accusing Spider-Man of numerous crimes and misdeeds, only to feel continually obliged to print almost as many retractions after being proven wrong. After his accusations that Spider-Man is the notorious criminal overlord The Big Man are debunked, Jameson admits that he is jealous of Spider-Man's courage and selflessness. Jameson believes that he cannot look at himself as a good man while a hero like Spider-Man exists.<ref>''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #10</ref> Despite this, he openly idolizes [[Captain America]], and [[Mary Jane Watson-Parker]] has suggested that Jameson hates Spider-Man mainly because he acts outside the law.<ref name="SSM175">''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #175</ref> In ''Tangled Web'' #20, a psychiatrist suggests it's the mask that bothers him and that when he sees people who "claimed to be heroes, but covered their faces", he is subconsciously sure that they're hiding a horrible secret like his foster father was.

Though Jonah's rancor against Spider-Man at times subsides after he saves the life of one of his loved ones,<ref name="SSM175"/> his determination to find some flaw in the hero always returns before long. For his part, Spider-Man's reaction ranges from frustration and anger at the ungrateful publisher, which leads to occasional pranks to antagonize him, to an amused acceptance of his self-destructive stubbornness.

Jameson posts rewards for Spider-Man's capture or [[secret identity]], hunts him with [[Spencer Smythe]]'s [[Spider-Slayer]] [[robot]]s,<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #25 and 58</ref> and even commissions superpowered agents to defeat the masked man. He hires a private detective named MacDonald Gargan, puts him through a regimen of [[gene therapy|genetic enhancement]], and transforms him into the [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]] - only to have Gargan go [[insane]] and turn on his benefactor.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #20</ref> Although Spider-Man protects Jameson from the Scorpion, Jameson keeps his role in creating the Scorpion secret for years. He creates another superbeing, who turned into a supervillain, the [[Human Fly (comics)|Human Fly]], who had his own vendetta against him.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #10</ref> He hires [[Silver Sable]] and her Wild Pack to hunt Spider-Man down, and also hires [[Luke Cage]] to capture Spider-Man when he is wanted for the deaths of [[Gwen Stacy]] and [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]].

For all his hostility towards Spider-Man, Jameson needs photographs of his heroics to sell papers, and Peter Parker takes advantage of that by taking pictures of himself as Spider-Man and selling them to the ''Bugle'' with few questions asked.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #2</ref>

Despite his feelings towards Spider-Man, Jameson helps him out during [[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|a demonic attack on New York]]. The publishing offices of the ''Daily Bugle'' come under siege and Jameson leads the defense. An injured Spider-Man and Jameson cooperate in defending the others.

Though best known for his crusades against vigilante superheroes like Spider-Man, Jameson never hesitates to use the power of his paper against supervillains, crimebosses (including the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]<ref>''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]'' #230-231</ref>), and crooked politicians. He publishes a major expose on presidential candidate Randolf Cherryh's criminal ties, acknowledging in advance that a retaliatory lawsuit from Cherryh could bankrupt the ''Daily Bugle''.<ref>''Daredevil'' #177-178</ref> Jameson later takes an aggressive stance against presidential candidate [[Graydon Creed]], attacking him for his anti-mutant agenda and investigating the shadowy [[Operation: Zero Tolerance]], though he never manages to uncover the truth.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

===Family ties===
In ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #162 (November 1976), Jameson introduces himself to Dr. Marla Madison, a distinguished scientist and daughter of a deceased friend of his. He asks for her help in creating a new Spider-Slayer, one of a series of robots created to defeat Spider-Man, although Spider-Man has managed to survive their attacks and destroy each of them. Madison is interested in the challenge, and joins Jameson in his efforts. The two grow closer, eventually marrying but not without another attack from the Scorpion, who kidnaps Marla and is defeated by Spider-Man.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #18</ref> Jameson remains a devoted, if a little overprotective, husband to his second wife.

Marla Madison [[adopt]]s [[Mattie Franklin]], the daughter of one of Jonah's friends. Though Jonah is initially opposed to having a roguish teenager in his house, especially one who insists on affectionately calling him "Unca Jonah",<ref>''Spider-Woman'' (vol. 3) #3</ref> he soon warms up to Mattie, coming to regard her almost as a surrogate daughter.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' (vol. 3) #12 and 18</ref><ref name="Al20">''[[Alias (comics)|Alias]]'' #20</ref> Two weeks after Mattie is abducted for illegal harvesting of [[mutant growth hormone]], private investigators [[Jessica Drew]] and [[Jessica Jones]] track her down and inform Jonah and Marla that Mattie is also the vigilante [[Spider-Woman]].<ref name="Al20"/> For saving Mattie, Jonah heavily promotes Jones' agency and later hires her as a reporter for the ''Bugle'''s new ''Pulse'' magazine.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

===Relinquishing control===
The guilt for creating the Scorpion catches up with Jameson when the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]] [[blackmail]]s him about it. When he receives the threats, rather than succumb to the Hobgoblin, Jameson chooses instead to reveal it to the world in a public [[editorial]]. He steps down as the ''Bugle'''s editor-in-chief, delegating the post to his immediate subordinate, [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Joseph "Robbie" Robertson]], but Jameson remains its publisher.

Jonah's control of the ''Daily Bugle'' is bought out from under him by multimillionaire [[Puma (comics)|Thomas Fireheart]]. Fireheart had felt that he owed Spider-Man a debt of honor and in an attempt to repay the hero, he purchases the ''Daily Bugle''{{issue|date=December 2013}} and begins a pro-Spider-Man campaign.<ref>''[[Web of Spider-Man]]'' #59</ref> Jameson starts up a rival magazine which continues to produce anti-Spider-Man articles.{{issue|date=December 2013}} Spider-Man finds Fireheart's campaign embarrassing at best, and after he repeatedly demands that he stop, Fireheart challenges the web-slinger to a battle to the death in New Mexico. He then sells the ''Bugle'' back to Jameson for the sum of one dollar, on the condition that he print an obituary "For either me, or Spider-Man."<ref>''The Spectacular-Spider-Man'' #171</ref> Jameson, though shocked by the request, takes the deal.

Soon after this he is blackmailed into selling the ''Bugle'' to [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] after threats were made against his family; simultaneously, he is attacked and hounded by the supervillain [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)#Mad Jack(s)|Mad Jack]]. The time spent as a subordinate to Osborn took a heavy mental toll, almost driving him to attempted murder, but he is finally able to reclaim the ''Bugle'' after Osborn is driven underground by temporary insanity.

==="Death"===
When a duplicate of [[Spider-Man]] created by [[Mysterio]] jumps in front of Jameson's car while he's driving home from work one day, he crashes into a tree. He is believed killed in the car crash, dying upon impact, and the media blames Spider-Man for his tragic and untimely demise. Later, he is shown ascending to "the light", only for him to be condemned for all the injustices he committed in life. He is then shown descending into Mysterio's staged version of [[Hell]], where he is tormented by a Spider-Man-esque [[demon]], though this is revealed to just be a part of Mysterio's revenge on Jameson, and he is eventually rescued by none other than Spider-Man himself.<ref>''Webspinners: Tales of Spider-Man'' (1999) #1-3 (Jan.-March 1999)</ref>

===Spider-Man unmasked===
Jameson's influence on the paper as its publisher was shown in the 2006-2007 ''[[Civil War: Front Line]]'' where he pressures his staff into supporting the government's [[Registration acts (comics)|Superhuman Registration Act]], still directing the general tone of the paper, despite losing his more hands-on position.<ref>{{cite web
| title=Of Civil Wars and Sidekicks: Jenkins Talks CIVIL WAR: FRONT LINE and SIDEKICK|publisher=Comic Book Resources| url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=6952|accessdate=March 22, 2006 }}</ref> When Spider-Man unmasked to reveal himself to be Peter Parker, Jameson fainted in shock at the realization that the man he had been calling a menace had actually been on his payroll for years.

On top of the Parker revelation, he had to deal with the notion that [[She-Hulk]] had now become his daughter-in-law. This was not helped by the fact that She-Hulk and Spider-Man had previously sued him for [[libel]].

[[File:CIVWARJJJ.jpg|right|thumb|frame|Jameson's reaction to the unmasking of Spider-Man.]]
It has been since revealed that Jameson had always believed that between him and Peter Parker was a bond of trust and he had always regarded him as another son, the "last honest man" in the world; he had always bought his photos, even the ones that he considered inferior, to help him in a discreet manner. After Peter's public confession, he felt so betrayed and humiliated that it shattered their bond, and he became determined to make Peter "pay", despite Parker (as enforcer) and Jameson both actively supporting the [[Registration Acts (comics)|Superhuman Registration Act]]. He planned to sue his former protege for [[fraud]], demanding back all the money he paid Peter over the years. However, he found out that the government had granted Parker amnesty for all the acts he had done to protect his secret identity, which included taking photos of himself (see ''She-Hulk'' #9). Both this and his son's marriage to [[She-Hulk]] drove Jameson into a fit of rage, and he attacked his new daughter-in-law with the original [[Spider-Slayer]]. Luckily, she easily destroyed it, and to smooth things over, said she would take the case for fraud against Spider-Man (while privately intending to drag it out as long as possible).

Spider-Man later defected from the government's side in enforcing the Registration Act and joined up with [[Captain America]]'s Secret Avengers, openly rebelling against the new law and fighting those attempting to enforce it. Issues of ''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' revealed that Jameson posted a reward to bring Peter in. He also committed libel against Parker by coercing Peter's old girlfriend [[Debra Whitman]] into writing an untrue account of him; [[Betty Brant]] has secretly supplied information about this to ''[[The Daily Globe]]'', which then published a front-page exposé.

In the most recent development, his editor-in-chief and closest friend [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Robbie Robertson]] stood up to Jameson and his shoddy treatment of Peter/Spider-Man over the years. Unable or unwilling to admit that he had gone too far in his hatred of Spider-Man, Jameson fired Robertson. Later, Spider-Man learned of this from Betty Brant and decided that he and Jameson should have a long overdue "chat". Some time later, Jameson showed up at the Robertson house, with a bottle of wine, two black eyes, and a broken hand. Robbie let him in, and Jameson relates what happened: Jameson discovered his office at the ''Bugle'' covered with webbing, with a note attached telling him to meet Spider-Man at an old gangster lair. Spider-Man tried to persuade Jameson to rehire Robbie, and Jameson gave him a choice: to have the lawsuit against him dropped, or for Robbie to be rehired. Spider-Man chose the former, revealing that he did so because he believes Jameson only fired Robbie to get a rise out of him. Spider-Man then told Jameson to hit him, as many times as he'd like, to finally work out his frustrations. Jameson was initially reluctant, until Spider-Man started goading him, threatening to inform his wife and son of his "cowardice". Jameson snapped, and started hitting Spider-Man again and again and again, resulting in his broken hand. When it was over, Spider-Man went into the rafters and brought Jameson back a roll of film, containing pictures of their "fight", telling him the photographs depicting him standing back and letting Jameson beat him up would sell "a [[gazillion]] copies", and left. Later, at the ''Bugle'', Jameson crushed the film with his foot, not knowing quite why he was doing it. As he turned to leave, Betty Brant accidentally hit him in the face with a door, resulting in his two black eyes. Back in the present, Jameson told Robbie of his decision to rehire him and to drop the lawsuit against Peter.

===Heart attacks and recuperation===
Jameson has his first heart attack, a mild one, in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #70, while being threatened by Spider-Man when the latter finally loses his temper after many years of abuse and defamation.

After the status quo was revised in the "[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day|Brand New Day]]" storyline, Peter's identity is once again a secret. ''The Daily Bugle'' has hit hard times with Peter not selling as many Spider-Man pictures as usual and star reporter [[Ben Urich]] gone. These circumstances led to Jonah facing a buyout from the wealthy [[Dexter Bennett]]. This forced Jonah to stop everyone's checks to build the capital needed to save the paper, with everyone at the ''Bugle'' working temporarily for free as a sign of solidarity. Needing money for an apartment, Peter came to the ''Bugle'' claiming he was owed money, to which Jonah yelled at him, causing Peter to snap and yell back, stating that his photographs kept the ''Bugle'' selling while Jonah raked in the profits and paid Peter a pittance. This caused Jonah to yell at Peter again, but he stopped short owing to a second [[heart attack]].{{issue|date=August 2014}}

Peter spent an unknown period of time giving Jonah [[CPR]] to try and save him until the paramedics arrived; upon arriving they rushed Jonah to the hospital where he was depicted resting before surgery. His wife began talking to a lawyer about power of attorney and selling the final shares of the ''Bugle'' without Jonah having a say. When Peter, as Spider-Man, paid a visit, he accidentally let slip that the ''Daily Bugle'' has sold to Dexter Bennett, which caused Jonah to have another heart attack, forcing Spider-Man to once again give him CPR. Surprisingly, Jonah did not blame Spider-Man for once, but instead he just kept on muttering, "Dexter Bennett".{{issue|date=August 2014}}

Jonah's condition later improved, to the point where he takes physiotherapy sessions and [[T'ai chi ch'uan|t'ai chi]] classes. However, he loses his temper if he sees or hears about Dexter Bennett and the ''D.B.'' He is also apparently facing problems with his wife, as he has yet to forgive her for selling the ''Bugle''.{{issue|date=August 2014}}

===Mayor of New York===
In a 2009 storyline, Jameson is elected the mayor of New York City.<ref>[[Slott, Dan]] (w), [[Delperdang, Jesse]]; [[Eaglesham, Dale]]; [[Kitson, Barry]] (a), "'Nuff Said!", ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #591. June 2009. Marvel Comics.</ref> In his new office, Jonah receives a visit from his estranged father J. Jonah Jameson Sr. demanding that Jonah cease his vendetta with Spider-Man, citing Spider-Man's many heroic deeds and the fact that the Avengers and even Captain America had accepted him. Spider-Man then enters the mayor's office hoping to establish a truce with him only for Jonah to announce that he has assembled an "Anti-Spider Squad" to capture Spider-Man. Spider-Man responds by taking his superhero work into overdrive, committing heroic deeds all over the city simply to enrage Jameson. Jameson responds by putting his squad on double-shifts, severely straining the city council's budget.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #592</ref>

In the "[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]" storyline, with Norman's rise to power, [[Dark Avengers]] member [[Mac Gargan|Spider-Man]] (really Mac Gargan) seeks to get revenge on Jameson. When Jameson arrived at his home, he was shocked to find a dead stripper on his bed.<ref>''Dark Reign: Sinister Spider-Man'' #1</ref> When Gargan starts a gang war, Jameson goes to Osborn to help and is given "Spider-Man". He later discovers Spider-Man has caused the gang war and tries to confront Norman, though Spider-Man's name is cleared when he appears to save the Big Apple Festival from [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]], [[Daken]], and the gangs involved. Jameson's popularity jumps from having worked with Spider-Man to solve the problem, though he does not realize during the course of the events that he is dealing with a different Spider-Man.<ref>''Dark Reign: Sinister Spider-Man'' #2-4</ref>

He also eventually learns that his father is marrying [[Aunt May|May Parker]], something he personally doesn't like, but in the end he begrudgingly accepts, even offering to pay for their ceremony out of his own pocket, and preside over it. The marriage also technically makes him Peter Parker's brother/cousin, something he very clearly dislikes.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #600</ref>

Later, Spider-Man tries to stop the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] from setting off a bomb that would kill thousands. Jameson has his squad attack in [[Mandroid]] suits. Spider-Man uses his knowledge of the Mandroid suits to disarm the bomb. The squad, instead of following orders and arresting Spider-Man, lets him go. The next day, Jameson is shocked to learn that every member of the squad resigned, and his aide tells him Jonah is getting out of control given Spider-Man's heroics. When Jameson yells about how the public has to see Spider-Man as a menace, the aide snaps that this was not the Daily Bugle. He tenders his own resignation, telling Jameson that he has to choose between Spider-Man or actually helping the city.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #604</ref>

Jameson later gives a financial bailout to Dexter Bennett to keep The DB! afloat. This led to a public backlash, which the villain, [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], takes advantage of. Electro espouses taking down the DB!, a greedy corporation asking for money, and draws energy from his city-wide supporters turning on all their electrical appliances. In a showdown with Spider-Man inside the building, Dexter Bennett is crushed by rubble and the DB! building is completely destroyed. The destruction of the Bugle's longtime headquarters proves heartbreaking for Jameson, who is upset with his life's work and all of his memories being destroyed.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #614</ref>

During Spider-Man's encounter with the latest Vulture in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #623-624, it was falsely stated by a mob boss that Jameson was responsible for his creation in order to get that Vulture to attack Jameson. Spider-Man ends up fighting the Vulture to protect him.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #623</ref> Security guard Gabriel Graham, whom Jameson didn't even know the name of before, gives up his life to protect Jameson from the Vulture, something that greatly affects Jameson, and makes Peter decide to make a doctored photo showing Jameson trying to fight back against the Vulture. While the picture in fact gets back support for Jameson from the public, and eventually makes several people admit the truth of the situation, Jameson exposes the picture as a fake, and publicly fires Peter Parker, which leads to Peter, now seen as practically a con artist, being blacklisted by every news source.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #624</ref>

During the "[[Heroic Age (comics)|Heroic Age]]" storyline, J. Jonah Jameson witnesses the reformation of the Avengers.<ref>''Age of Heroes'' #1</ref> and is later targeted by an assassin called the Extremist.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' (vol. 2) #8</ref>

After Spider-Man saves the whole of New York from a bomb planted by Doctor Octopus, Jameson is talked by his son and Steve Rogers into holding a ceremony to give him the key to the city, much to his chagrin.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #648</ref> At the same time, he cashes the shares he owned of the DB!, giving the money to Robbie Robertson, so that he can rebuild ''Front Line'' into the new ''Daily Bugle''.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #649</ref>

During the events of the "[[Spider-Man: Big Time|Big Time]]" storyline [[Alistair Smythe]] tried to kill J. Jonah Jameson. Marla Jameson jumped in front of him saving his life but died in the process. As he held Marla, Jameson did not blame Spider-Man, but instead blamed himself."<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #654</ref> During the attacks of the villain Massacre, J. Jonah Jameson comforts a boy named Liam who lost his mother when Massacre attacked the bank she was visiting. J. Jonah Jameson plans to have Alistair Smythe receive the death penalty for what happened to Marla. After Spider-Man defeated Massacre and kept the NYPD from killing him and instead handed him over to the police, Jameson berates Spider-Man for saving the life of a murderer; however, Spider-Man replies that "no one dies".<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #656</ref>

During the "[[Spider-Island]]" storyline, J. Jonah Jameson's popularity as the mayor has plummeted and his Anti-Spider-Man Squad is considered to be a huge tax drain. He is shown to have been infected with spider powers <ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #669</ref> and soon mutates into a spider-like creature where he nearly kills Allistair Smythe, partly due to fact that he was responsible for the death of Jameson's wife.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #670</ref> The mayor is eventually cured of the spider-virus, along with the rest of the citizens of New York.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #672</ref> At present, Mayor Jameson shuts down Horizon Labs, (albeit without a court order), on the accusation that it conducts dangerous experiments and harbors criminals such as [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Morbius]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #682</ref> He places the city under martial law with his Anti-Spider-Man Squad patrolling the streets to prevent any looting during the "[[Ends of the Earth (Marvel Comics)|Ends of the Earth]]" storyline.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #685</ref> However, when Horizon Labs returns as heroes, Jameson is forced to re-open their New York facilities to save face, though he still demands the expulsion of Morbius.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #688</ref>

===Working with Superior Spider-Man===
After [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] (Doctor Octopus' mind in Spider-Man's body) stops the [[Sinister Six]], Mayor J. Jonah Jameson comes to thank him personally, while Peter Parker's consciousness is shocked to see Jameson's drastically changed attitude towards the hero.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #2</ref> On the top of the police station building Jameson, Chief Pratchett and [[Carlie Cooper]] stand near to the improvised "Spider-Signal". Jameson boasts about his wise ruling policy while Carlie doubts Superior Spider-Man will ever show up. But he finally does and short-circuits the signal. Jameson discharges oaths about wasted taxpayer dollars, and Superior Spider-Man explains they can hinder him using the signal, humiliating Jameson between the lines.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #3</ref> When Massacre rigs the doors of Grand Central Station to explode, this even worries Jameson.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #5</ref> While speaking in a press conference, Jameson is suddenly attacked by criminal pranksters Jester and Screwball who assault their victims and broadcast it through the internet in a web-show called "Jested" (similar to popular TV show ''[[Punk'd]]''). Both pranksters humiliate Jameson and transmit it all over the world, where even Superior Spider-Man laughs it off. Then he gets summoned by Jameson himself to the City Hall where he asks him to arrest Jester and Screwball. Superior Spider-Man dismisses it at first, but after Jameson reminded him of all the times Superior Spider-Man has pulled pranks on him (and even Otto remembers Peter's quips against him), he agrees to catch them putting his Patrol App on course. Superior Spider-Man beats up Jester and Screwball where his brutality being watched all over the city including Jameson (who is enjoying the punishment).<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #6</ref>

Jameson argues with his father about the actions of Superior Spider-Man.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #10</ref> Jameson later enlists Superior Spider-Man to help oversee the execution of [[Alistair Smythe]]. Jameson arrives to the Raft for a final inspection before Smythe's execution, where he has told that all of the Raft's inmates will be transferred once Jameson shuts it down, highlighting the infirmary where Boomerang, Vulture and Scorpion are being attended. Jameson, alongside Superior Spider-Man, his assistant Glory Grant and Bugle reporter Norah Jones, watch the procedure of Smythe's execution, while he claims to be a "better person"<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #11</ref>

Jameson reflecting on the moment whose Smythe killed his wife Marla right in front on him, sadly proclaiming that he will not keep the promise to fulfill her dying wish until Smythe dies, swearing that he will not leave the island. After Smythe's escape, Jameson, Glory Grant, Norah Winters, and the remaining civilians are surrounded by Superior Spider-Man's Spider-Bots and then are informed by Otto (in a pre-recorded holgoram) that he has taken measures to counteract any attempt of escape so his Spider-Bots will safeguard them in a force field while the reinforcements arrive, but Jonah refuses to stand still inside the force field, willing to go and help Superior Spider-Man against Smythe. When Smythe has the upper hand over Superior Spider-Man, Jameson poses as a prison guard to narrowly shoot Smythe. Superior Spider-Man accuses Jameson of leaving the force field, but Jameson confronts Superior Spider-Man to tell him he brought him to ensure that Smythe gets executed by any means necessary, implying that he has giving permission to Superior Spider-Man to directly kill him. Superior Spider-Man accepts and tells Jameson to go back to the force field with the others. Smythe sends Scorpion to target Jameson.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #12</ref> Jameson is assaulted by Scorpion who was more than willing to kill him only to be stopped by the Lizard. Once aboard the rescue boat, Jameson prepares himself for a press conference musing that he will be happy once the Raft is destroyed. Superior Spider-Man sways him apart and tells him that he should give him the Raft for his new base of operations. Jameson refuses only to be blackmailed by Superior Spider-Man with a recording of their meeting at the Raft where Jameson grants permission to Superior Spider-Man to kill Smythe. Fearing the repercussions (and in the process reigniting his hatred towards Superior Spider-Man), Jameson agrees and makes the announcement in his press conference where he publicly gives Superior Spider-Man the Raft as his new Super Hero Headquarters which Superior Spider-Man rechristens it as "Spider-Island II".<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #13</ref>

During the attacks of the Goblin King's Goblin Underground, Mayor Jameson unveils the Goblin-Slayers (which Mary Jane thinks might be former Spider-Slayers) which he plans to use to combat the Goblin threat.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #28</ref> Jameson orders to send one of the Goblin Slayers to the robbery location and then head to chase Superior Spider-Man. His Spider-Slayers confront Superior Spider-Man as Spider-Slayers with Jameson's face projected on the front faceplate. Jameson replies that he is done with being blackmailed by him and does not care if Jameson loses everything as long as he can finally bring down Superior Spider-Man, but his Spider-Slayers are reactivated by Green Goblin and voice rings out declaring that he has taken control of the Spider-Slayers as Green Goblin comments that Norman Osborn now runs this city.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #29</ref> In New York City Hall, Jameson is coming under heavy fire for the fact that his Spider-Slayers have turned against the people.

In the aftermath, Spider-Man is restored to his body Octavius sacrificing his own mind to bring Peter back as he recognizes that Peter Parker is the true Spider-Man and Green Goblin's plan is thwarted, Spider-Man visiting Jameson's office to confront him after what happened and returns him the Spider-Bot that Doctor Octopus used to record his blackmail material. Jameson replies that he will not accept it since he would not believe whatever Spider-Man says, regarding him now as a "monster" that does not own up to the consequences of his actions and instead stomps on others. Spider-Man replies that he will not expect him to believe this but says that he should not fear him, and should not take the blame for everything that Green Goblin caused, but to stay and fight. Once Spider-Man leaves, Jameson reveals that he had already resigned his post as Mayor of New York City and leaves the office, promising that from now on he will kick back.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #31</ref>

==In other media==

===Television===
J. Jonah Jameson has been a regular character in almost all adaptations of ''Spider-Man'':

* The [[Spider-Man (1967 TV series)|1960s animated series]] contained the most negative depiction of the character, voiced by [[Paul Kligman]]. He is an egotistical, greedy, cowardly loudmouth who automatically accuses [[Spider-Man]] of any crime, even when the evidence clearly contradicts him. He is implied to have some psychic ability in one episode where [[Green Goblin]] tries using him as a medium for a demon-summoning. He is constantly against Spider-Man, for example in the episode "Farewell Performance" where he wants an old Castle Theater to be torn down, but when Spider-Man claims he agrees with old buildings being torn down, Jameson says the Daily Bugle will now try to preserve old buildings, which is what Spider-Man wanted. He makes a feature for magic in his paper when he is sent free tickets by Blackwell the Magician, showing his meanness. In the episode "Sting of the Scorpion", he makes out that he saved the employees, despite cowering most of the time. In the second season episode "King Pinned" (which followed up the episode "The Origin of Spider-Man"), Jameson's attitude toward Spider-Man warms a bit even going as far as helping Spider-Man defeat [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] and expose a drug counterfeiting racket during their first meeting. Not openly hostile, Jameson seems to be more surprised that Spider-Man actually exists. Earlier in the episode, Jameson gives Peter a job at the Bugle when he remembers that Peter is the nephew of the late [[Uncle Ben]]. In the third season, he goes back to blaming Spider-Man for crimes.

* The character's first live-action appearances were in 1970s ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (TV series)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' TV series, performed by [[David White (actor)|David White]] in the [[television film]] and [[Robert F. Simon]] in the subsequent [[television series]]. In both these incarnations, J. Jonah Jameson's abrasive, flamboyant personality was toned down and the character was portrayed as a more avuncular figure.

* J. Jonah Jameson appeared in the [[1981 in television|1981]] ''[[Spider-Man (1981 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' series, voiced by [[William Woodson]].

* William Woodson reprised his role of J. Jonah Jameson in the ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'' episodes "The Origin of Iceman", "Spider-Man: Unmasked" and "The Origin of the Spider-Friends".

* J. Jonah Jameson appears in the 1990s ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' animated series voiced by [[Edward Asner]] (the casting may have been inspired by his well-known role as [[Lou Grant|another fictional news editor]]). In this series, the character's dislike of Spider-Man is based less on his powers and deeds and more to his hiding his identity behind a mask as his wife was killed by a masked gunman in this continuity. The series also portrays his integrity as a journalist, refusing to cover up the truth even when it is in his best interests and portrays his loyalty to those who work for him. Examples of the earlier include firing [[Eddie Brock]] when [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]] confirms Spider-Man's version of who stole a mineral John and a fellow [[astronaut]] brought from an [[asteroid]] and publishing an article on chemical weapons being developed by Oscorp despite being one of its shareholders and board members on this series. He secretly hired attorney [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Matt Murdock]] when Peter Parker was framed by [[Richard Fisk]] and personally uncovered evidence exonerating Robbie when he was framed by [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]]. The character's cigar-smoking trademark characteristic is not depicted in the more recent animated TV incarnations due to the levels of censorship required on the cartoons. In "Farewell Spider-Man," the J. Jonah Jameson of the high-tech Spider-Man's reality doesn't hate Spider-Man and is depicted as Peter Parker's godfather.

* J. Jonah Jameson appears in [[MTV]]'s ''[[Spider-Man: The New Animated Series|Spider-Man]]'' series voiced by [[Keith Carradine]]. Here, he is portrayed as extremely cheap and his hatred of Spider-Man only being evident in the show's series finale.

* J. Jonah Jameson appears in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', voiced by [[Daran Norris]].<ref>[http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0801/30/index.htm Comics Continuum by Rob Allstetter: Wednesday, January 30, 2008<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This version sports a [[soul patch]] along with his trademark [[mustache]] (that together form an exclamation point) and displays a level of [[ADHD|hyperactivity]] not seen in any of his previous incarnations, as well as an obsession with time, punctuality and deadlines similar to [[J. K. Simmons]]'s popular film portrayal of the character. Aside from that, he retains his dislike for Spider-Man from the comics, and takes delight in anything that might discredit or defame him and describes spider-man as a menace and a vigilante. He also retains much of his cynical, avuncular attitude and brusque manner with his staff and he shares a resemblance to his mainstream comics counterpart from the 1970s comics. He tends to be boisterous and difficult to get along with, though his secretary [[Betty Brant]] seems unfazed by his bloviating. Although he considers Spider-Man a menace (if at least a photo-worthy one), he seems to be fond of Peter Parker as he suggests [[tomato juice]] to the boy to kill the stench of garbage on him after a photo shoot in a junkyard and protects him from [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] by bravely covering for him while he can escape. When he learns that [[Aunt May]] had a [[heart attack]] during the [[Sinister Six]]'s attack on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]], he says he will tell Peter the news. He blames Spider-Man for the sudden profusion of costumed [[psychopath]]s like [[Doctor Octopus]], Green Goblin and Rhino in [[New York City]] (though this assumption is actually proven correct in the episode "The Invisible Hand" when Tombstone reveals that at least some of the super-villains were specifically created to occupy Spider-Man so that more ordinary criminals can continue their activities unhindered). At one point, he calls for the headline 'Spider-Man: Threat or Menace?'. In the second season, his hatred of Spider-Man gets worse. After his son John is affected by spores that hitched a ride in the [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] making him grow and having super strength and leaping tall bounds, Jonah convinces his son to be a superhero and take Spider-Man down. The spores then take over John's mind making him violent and aggressive. After Spider-Man gets rid of the spores with [[electricity]], Jonah then witnesses his son craving the spores powers and he blames Spider-Man for destroying his son. When [[Venom (comics)|Venom]] (Eddie Brock) reveals Parker's identity to Spider-Man, Jonah hardly believes it although he still wants to make sure. At [[Valentines Day]], his wife Joan Jameson makes him go to an [[opera]] even though he doesn't want to. After making an excuse to his wife to leave the stage, he witnesses the battle of the crime lords Tombstone, Doctor Octopus and [[Silvermane]] just as Jameson ironically made an excuse to leave the opera. After Spider-Man stops them and reveals Tombstone as the Big Man, Jameson accuses Spider-Man of assaulting an outstanding citizen, but [[Frederick Foswell]] dismisses this to him by whispering in his ear. Jameson angrily responds by saying "Never mind." After [[Norman Osborn]] tests the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]] security by putting Spider-Man in there, Jameson gloats about it. After Spider-Man manages to escape the Vault, Jameson claims Spider-Man and all the villains are working together so they can raise his blood pressure.

* J. Jonah Jameson appears in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', voiced by [[J. K. Simmons|J.K. Simmons]] reprising his portrayal from the first live-action ''Spider-Man'' film series. Much like his Ultimate counterpart, he defaces and mistrusts masked vigilantes much to Spider-Man's dismay.he runs the news network '''Daily Bugle Communications'''. In his first two appearances "Great Power" and "Great Responsibility", he stated that there will be a warrant for Spider-Man's arrest. He is seen at the end of "Great Responsibility" reporting the battle that Spider-Man, [[Luke Cage|Power Man]], [[White Tiger (comics)|White Tiger]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] and [[Nova (Sam Alexander)|Nova]] has against the [[Frightful Four]]. In the episode "Exclusive", [[Mary Jane Watson]] follows Spider-Man for an exclusive interview in order to sell the footage for a contest held by the Daily Bugle. Although Mary Jane did not win the contest following [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]'s fight with [[Zzzax]], Jameson does mail Mary Jane a new camera. In the episode "Beetle Mania", Jameson is being targeted by the [[Beetle (comics)|Beetle]] for a starts making a campaign to expose him to which Spider-Man and his team entering the Daily Bugle to stop Beetle's assassination attempts. After Beetle is defeated by Spider-Man's team and learns Jameson is not in his office but on monitor renderings, Mary Jane unplugs the monitor after she comes for the interviews. In the episode "Out of Damage Control", Jameson sends one of his people out to record Spider-Man's team helping [[Damage Control (comics)|Damage Control]] clean up the area that was trashed in the fight against the Wrecking Crew which he broadcasts. After Spider-Man's team and Damage Control CEO Mac Porter defeats the Wrecking Crew which was also taped, Jameson appears on the nearby television monitor stated that Spider-Man's victory over the Wrecking Crew still does not prove anything. In the episode "Spidah-Man!", Jameson puts out a $10,000,000.000 bounty on the apprehension and unmasking of Spider-Man. Near the end of the episode, Jameson rescinds the bounty on Spider-Man claiming that the ratings of his broadcast going down "had nothing to do with Spider-Man being in Boston because only Manhattan can tolerate Spider-Man". In the episode "The Man-Wolf", Jameson calls upon [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] director [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]] to arrange a rescue party to look for his son John Jameson. After John was rescued, Jameson mentioned in his broadcast that he blames Spider-Man for his son's Man-Wolf transformations. When Jameson asks Nick Fury what he is going to do about it, Fury states to Jameson that his son was rescued because of Spider-Man. Before ending his transmission with Jameson, Nick Fury tells him to "put that info in his moustache and chew on it." In the episode "Sandman Returns", Jameson reports on Spider-Man working with Sandman where Jameson making some negative comments on Sandman causing him to go on a rampage. In the episode "Agent Venom", Jameson comments about people's opinions about Spider-Man changing after he had worked with the Avengers.

Jonah Jameson is seen where he still thinks that Spider-Man is a menace with the current Spider-Man being [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Miles Morales]].

It made clear that various high-level individuals have told him this including the president, but he 'still' disbelieves them and has been calling [[Captain America]] a traitor. During the conversation, Stark points out that Jameson has been running campaign against Spider-Man similar to what he has now doing to Captain America for years. Jameson suggests to Tony that he should take Betty Brant and Peter Parker to get proof of Captain America's innocence. Jameson later has the Daily Bugle print out a story about Captain America saving people from Spider-Man and the Serpent Society which lead to Spider-Man to go 'web his mouth shut'. It is unclear, however, if Spider-Man literally meant to do so, or if he was planning to find a way to prove Jamenson is wrong about him.

===Films===
[[File:J.K. Simmons as Jameson.gif|thumb|right|J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson in the ''[[Spider-Man in film|Spider-Man]]'' film series.]]
In the ''Spider-Man'' films directed by [[Sam Raimi]], J. Jonah Jameson is portrayed by [[J. K. Simmons|J.K. Simmons]], and serves as a major source of [[comic relief]]. Portrayed as a blustering, bombastic man, the film version of Jameson retains his dislike for Spider-Man, and takes delight in anything that might discredit or defame him. This portrayal has been extremely well received by fans of the original comics. Stan Lee has said that, assuming the film was made earlier than 2002, he would have liked to have portrayed Jameson in a live-action ''Spider-Man'' film, but he has warmly praised Simmons' rendition. In the films, he has a [[pencil moustache]], unlike in the comics, where he has a [[toothbrush moustache]].

====''Spider-Man''====
In the first film ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'', Jameson describes him as a menace and a vigilante, and points out, "''Then why does he wear a mask? Huh? What's he got to hide?''" Indeed, the only reason he develops an interest in publishing news on the hero is because it sells papers, and upon hearing that no one has been able to get a clear shot of him, he declares, "''He doesn't want to be famous? Then I'll make him ''in''famous!''" He also retains much of his cynical, avuncular attitude and brusque manner with his staff, though he willingly protects Peter Parker when the Green Goblin demands to know the identity of Spider-Man's photographer. When Peter accuses him of slandering Spider-Man, Jameson says, "''I resent that! Slander is spoken. In print, it's libel.''" He holds the dubious honor of providing the nicknames (wanting his staff to immediately trademark the name) for the central villains in both of the first two films: the [[Green Goblin]] and [[Doctor Octopus]]. In each film his office is rearranged and relocated; only the first movie offers an explicit reason for this, as in that film it is partially destroyed by the [[Green Goblin]]. A greedy man who demands much of his employees, Jameson is reminiscent of a fast-talking 1940s film character in many ways.

====''Spider-Man 2''====
Throughout the second film ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'', Jameson is shown to know that Spider-Man is a hero, but is too proud to admit it. He even goes so far as to admit it when crime and danger skyrocket and his son's fiancée, [[Mary Jane Watson]], is kidnapped after Spider-Man temporarily disappears; true to form, he recants almost immediately and becomes infuriated with the web-slinger once again when Spider-Man steals back his costume from the ''Bugle'' to confront the rampaging [[Doctor Octopus]]. The DVD-only ''[[Spider-Man 2#Spider-Man 2.1|Spider-Man 2.1]]'' extended cut of the film contains a short scene in which Jameson dons the Spider-Man suit and romps around on his desk, while Robbie Robertson, Betty Brant, and Hoffman watch in a mix of surprise and confusion. The filmmakers cut the scene from the theatrical release because Simmons didn't fit their original image of a paunchy middle-aged man; instead, he fills out the costume fairly well. ''Mrs.'' Jameson is alive and well in the films, being mentioned in the first and third films and seen in the second. References to her are usually relayed as a foil to Jameson's miserly ways; when informed by [[Betty Brant|his secretary]] his wife had lost his checkbook, he replies "Thanks for the good news." At the wedding of his son [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]] and [[Mary Jane Watson]] in the second film, once it becomes clear that the bride had left the groom at the altar, the first thing Jameson does is tell his wife to call the wedding caterer and "tell her not to open the [[caviar]]" after having evidently lost an earlier argument where he did not wish to buy caviar at all.

====''Spider-Man 3''====
In ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'', Jameson sets [[Eddie Brock]] and Peter Parker up as rivals to earn a staff job, instructing them to obtain unflattering pictures of Spider-Man. He is shown to supposedly have many medical conditions, being warned by Miss Brant (who was informed by Jameson's wife) whenever he is too tense or when he needs to take his pills. Specifically, it is revealed that he has high blood pressure, and Miss Brant must always remind him to watch his temper. Later, Jameson fires Brock for doctoring and selling fake photos of Spider-Man robbing a bank, in spite of his dislike of the hero, as Brock's photo destroyed his paper's reputation, which has not printed a retraction in 20 years. He is surprised by Parker's new confident and aggressive demeanor, provoked by the [[Symbiote (comics)|black suit]], especially when he finds him and Miss Brant flirting on his desk, exclaiming "Miss Brant, that's not the position I hired you for". At the climactic battle between Spider-Man, [[Harry Osborn|New Goblin]], [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] and [[Venom (comics)|Venom]], Jameson, unable to locate Parker, bargains with a little girl in the crowd to obtain her camera to shoot the battle himself. She refuses to sell for less than a hundred dollars. After the stingy Jameson reluctantly pays, he discovers that there is no film in the camera, to which she explains, "''The film's extra,''" much to his fury.

====''The Amazing Spider-Man 2''====
J. Jonah Jameson was referenced in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]'', being mentioned on several occasions. It is established that Peter Parker is working for him by providing him with photographs of Spider-Man, and that Jameson is still slandering him. At one point, Peter emails Jameson to ask him to take it easy on Spider-Man, but Jameson immediately responds with a refusal.

===Parodies===
In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Moe'N'a Lisa]]", which aired on November 19, 2006, J.K. Simmons guest stars, playing a publisher resembling J. Jonah Jameson in the ''Spider-Man'' films. This resemblance is made more apparent when he demands pictures, stories, and even poems about Spider-Man. He even repeats a line from ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'': "What are you waiting for? [[Chinese New Year]]?" This is due in part to guest star [[Michael Chabon]]'s script work on ''Spider-Man 2''.<ref>[http://www.tv.com/the-simpsons/moe-n-a-lisa/episode/530753/summary.html?om_act=convert&om_clk=episodessh&tag=episodes;title;1 TV.com - ''Moe'N'a Lisa'']</ref> A similar character, also voiced by Simmons, appears later in the same season as the publisher of The Springfield Inquisitor in the episode "[[Homerazzi]]".

In the ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'' parody on [[VH1]]'s ''ILL-Ustrated'', j. Jonah Jameson is portrayed as a [[Dr. Dre]] look-alike.

A parody of J. Jonah Jameson mostly based on J.K. Simmons's performance appears in ''[[Superhero Movie]]''. This parody is a mental patient from the hospital that the newspaper company shares with, yelling that hamburgers can tell the future.

[[Rob Zicari]] portrays the character in the 2011 pornographic spoof ''Spider-Man XXX: A Porn Parody'' and its sequel ''Superman vs. Spider-Man XXX: An Axel Braun Parody''.

===Novelizations===
Reference is made to Jameson in the novelization of the [[Fantastic Four (2005 film)|''Fantastic Four'' movie]], although the character is not expressly named as Jameson; after they have saved the people on a bridge, [[Mister Fantastic]] is shown on numerous television channels talking about the Fantastic Four, and recognizes a man with a small mustache (accompanied by a headline ''FANTASTIC FOUR: HEROES OR MENACE'') as the owner of a major newspaper. Jameson is also featured in the 1978 novel ''Mayhem in Manhattan'', written by [[Len Wein]] and [[Marv Wolfman]].

===Theatre===
[[Michael Mulheren]] plays J. Jonah Jameson in the Broadway musical ''[[Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark]]''.<ref>Flynn, Kevin (August 10, 2011).
