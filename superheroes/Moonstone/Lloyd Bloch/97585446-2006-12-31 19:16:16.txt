'''Nefarius''' (real name Lloyd Bloch), previously known as '''Moonstone''', is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].

He was a [[Captain America]] villain affiliated with the [[Secret Empire]].  He was empowered by a stone found in the Moon's surface, hence his codename.  After the Secret Empire's defeat he was arrested, and eventually had his alien gem stolen from him by his psychiatrist, [[Moonstone (comics)|Karla Sofen]], who became the second Moonstone.

Bloch later resurfaced with ionic powers similar to those of [[Wonder Man]], bearing the new codename "Nefarius" and claiming to be the son of [[Count Nefaria]]. He planned to take revenge on Sofen, but was apparently killed by Nefaria, when he drained the ionic energy from him.

During the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]' sojourn on [[Counter-Earth (comics)|Counter-Earth]], Sofen encountered Bloch's counterpart who went by the codename '''[[Phantom Eagle]]'''. The alternate Bloch became obsessed with Moonstone and began experiencing psychotic episodes and was exposed as a [[serial killer]]. Sofen proceeded to steal his equivalent stone too.

==Alternate definition==

A Nefarius is also a small mole like creature (they grow to approximately 8 inches long, 5 inches wide), the most noticeable feature of a Nefarius is its large pink nose covered in red hairs which give it the power of [[ESP]]. It often lives in urban environments underneath buildings and is considered a pest. The staple diet of a Nefarius are worms, insects, roots of both trees and flowers and even its own [[feces]] on occasion. Nefarius's are sadly quickly becoming extinct, only 6000 are known to exist in the world, 5000 of them in [[Tajikistan]] under the republics capital Dushanbe while the location of the remaining 1000 is unknown. If current trends continue all the Nefarius's will be dead within 3 years, and the children of the future will never see them. *Emo tears*.
