'''Nefarius''' (real name Lloyd Bloch, also known as '''Moonstone'''), is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].

He was a [[Captain America]] villain affiliated with the [[Secret Empire]].  He was empowered by a stone found in the Moon's surface, hence his codename.  After the Secret Empire's defeat he was arrested, and eventually had his alien gem stolen from him by [[Moonstone (comics)|Karla Sofen]], who became the second Moonstone.  He later turned up again with ionic powers and the new codename "Nefarius," bearing a grudge against Sofen, but was apparently killed by [[Count Nefaria]], when he drained the ionic energy from him.

During the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]' sojourn on [[Counter-Earth (comics)|Counter-Earth]], Sofen encountered Bloch's counterpart who went by the codename '''Phantom Eagle'''. She proceeded to steal his equivalent stone too.
