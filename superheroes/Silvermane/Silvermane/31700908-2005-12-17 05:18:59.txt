'''Silvermane''' (real name Silvio Manfredi) is a fictional [[Marvel Comics]] character. He is a [[supervillain]] and a prominent figure in the [[Maggia]], a fictional [[organized crime]] syndicate that is analagous to the [[Mafia]]. He first appeared in ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' volume 1 #74.

Silvio Manfredi, nicknamed "Silvermane" for his near-white hair, has been a professional [[criminal]] for a long time.  He started his criminal career in a group called the [[Maggia]].  Climbing through the ranks and becoming head of the crime family, he eventually formed an alliance with [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]], a worldwide organization determined to take over the world. Silvermane has hired many crimnals, such as [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]], and he has also been known to be a rival of the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]. In his old age, Silvermane attempted to prolong his life by transforming himseld into a [[cyborg]]; he has occasionally attempted to boost the power of his remaining organic parts by harvesting parts from the superhuman body of his nemesis, [[Spider-Man]].

In ''[[Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'', Silvermane is a crime lord. Although he is a villain, he is not a supervillain, as he has no superhuman powers. He is, however, extremely intelligent. Although he is an enemy of Spider-Man, he doesn't see eye-to-eye with Spidey's other foes. He is a hated rival of Wilson Fisk ([[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]), another crime lord. Silvermane is also the father of [[Alisha Silver (comics)|Alisha Silver]]. It is unclear why Alisha has a different last name than her father. Most likely this is because she was created for a later version of Spider-Man where Silvermane's origins are less extensively explored, and in that version "Silver" may simply have been Silvermane's real surname.

Silvermane never enjoyed a normal childhood, as he grew into old age, he became obsessed with finding the secerets to youth and immortality.  He heard legends of an ancient tablet which allegedly was inscribed with the formula to rejuvenate and individuals youth, The Tablet of Time. When the tablet was unearthed and brought to the United States he arranged for Tombstone to steal the tablet and kidnap Dr. Curt Connors ([[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]]), who was studying it's powers. Even with the intervention of Spiderman, Silvermane was able to kidnap Connors' wife and force Connors to activate the tablet. In the comic book the formula is for a potion. Conner's prepares the potion for him, while the lives of Connors family was used as a motivator for him to succesfully decipher the tablet. Spider-Man saved Connors but Silvermane took the potion anyway despite Connors warnings of it being unstable. In the animated series version of the story, Silvermane was transformed into a baby instead of being mildly rejuvenated. There, the tablet focuses the suns rays into lasers which produce a greenish glow. Silvermane is initially turned into a young man, fights the Lizard then transforms further into a baby. The Lizard is bombarded by the rays and mutates back to human form. Dr. Connors concludes that they might by able to use the tablet to stablize Spiderman's mutations, but the tablet is stolen by [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]], working for Wilson Fisk ([[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]). Fisk dismayed that his wife left him orders Hammerhead to get rid of the tablet. Hammerhead sells the tablet to an elderly man, presumably The [[Vulture (comics)|Vulture]], who uses the Tablet to temporarily restore youth to himself. He is unable to remain youthful for an expended period of time, transforming back and forth uncontrolably.

In a later episode, "Baby" Silvermane was seen to have retained his adult intellect. He and Alisha got the cyborg [[Alestair Smythe]] to kidnap The [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]] (Felicia Hardy), blackmailing Spider-Man to apphrehend The [[Scorpion (comics)|Scorpion]]. Baby Silvermane believes that he can use The Scorpian who had been created through the use of Neogenics to combine his genetic structure with that of a scorpion to swap bodies with Spider-Man. The Scorpion meanwhile in an attempt to go straight, was living with the Vulture. The Vulture, one of the originators of the Neogenic technology believes he himself can use Silvermane's lab to make himself permanently youthful. During the neogenic transfer the Vulture intervenes, allowing Spider-Man, The Black Cat & The Scorpion to escape. Silvermane and the Vulture exchange energys in the neogenic transfer allowing the Vulture to become semi-permanently young again and reverting Silvermane into an old man.
