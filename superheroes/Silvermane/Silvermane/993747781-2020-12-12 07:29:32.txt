The character's original storyline was about a mysterious stone tablet coveted by several ''Spider-Man'' villains. The "Tablet Saga" proved popular, although artist [[John Romita, Sr.]] said that it was not originally intended as an arc: "We never even thought up Silvermane until the seventh issue [of the story arc], let alone a 'socko' ending."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wells |first1=John |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: 1965-1969 |date=2014 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490557 |page=270}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Silvio Manfredi, nicknamed "Silvermane" for his near-white hair, is a professional [[criminal]] originally from [[Corleone]], [[Sicily]] that started his criminal career as a racketeer in the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]], eventually forming his own crime family and becoming a powerful Maggia Don.

In his first appearance, an elderly Silvermane forced [[Lizard (comics)|Dr. Curt Connors]] to make a potion from an ancient clay tablet in order to grant himself immortality. He first crossed paths with Conners's alter-ego, the Lizard, and [[Spider-Man]] during this scheme. Drinking the serum made Silvermane younger, but its effects caused him to de-age further and further until he was a infant before completely disappearing.<ref>''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #73-75</ref> Silvermane eventually reappeared, revealing that he had mystically aged to his forties. He started a new career and again quickly rose through the Maggia's ranks until he regained control of his family, the sought to form an alliance with [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]], determined to take over the world as their leader, the Supreme Hydra. He was defeated by [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], [[Nick Fury]] and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]<ref>''Daredevil'' #121-123</ref> Silvermane reappeared in New York in an attempt to unite all of New York's gangs under his leadership and take over the criminal underworld, but his plans were complicated by the [[Green Goblin#Bart Hamilton|Green Goblin]], who opposed him. During a confrontation between the Goblin, Silvermane and Spider-Man, Silvermane fell from a great height but survived.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #176-180</ref>

Silvermane has worked with many super-villains, such as [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]], and he has also been known to be a rival of the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]], even once trying to assassinate the crime lord while he was suffering from amnesia.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #197</ref> His former partner, Dominic Tyrone, assumed the identity of the [[Rapier (comics)|Rapier]] and sought vengeance against Silvermane for betraying him by attempting to take his life.<ref>''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]] Annual'' #2</ref> A flashback one-shot focused heavily on Silvermane's lifetime of corruption and crime, going back to his early career in Italy. The framework was reporter [[Ben Urich]] investigating the background of the Maggia. He learned that Silvermane was a legendary criminal figure for decades; mothers would even warn their children to behave or "One-Eye" would get them.<ref>''Spider-Man: Made Men'' #1 (August 1998)</ref>

In his old age, Silvermane's injuries caused his youth serum to wear off, rendering him an invalid. Though bedridden, he continued to run his criminal empire until [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Dagger]] nearly killed him. Silvermane attempted to prolong his life by transforming himself into a [[cyborg]].<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #69-70</ref> Kingpin gained control of his cyborg body until Dagger restored his life energy to him.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #94-96</ref> His cyborg body was badly damaged by the first [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]] during a gang war between Hammerhead and the Kingpin.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #284</ref> Silvermane used a remote-controlled android doppelganger to battle Spider-Man. This was part of an attempt to boost the power of his remaining organic parts by harvesting new ones from Spider-Man's body. He attempted to drain his nemesis's radioactive blood to power a new, much stronger cyborg body.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #79-80</ref> Silvermane also confronted [[Deathlok]] and the [[Punisher]] while setting up a major drug operation outside a grammar school.<ref>''Deathlok'' #8-9</ref> Even though he is no longer technically human, he has continued to remain active in the Maggia.

Silvermane attempted to take part in a meetup of various criminal warlords, during a time when Wilson Fisk had fallen from power. The meeting's goal was to divide up Fisk's territory and assets, but it did not go well. Silvermane was caught in the crossfire between the [[Secret Empire (organization)|Secret Empire]]'s forces and the Punisher. This was purely by coincidence as he was simply staying at the same motel as Punisher was. Silvermane used the resources of his personal semi-trailer and the cyborg bodies stored within to battle his way through the attackers and escape.<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' #46-48</ref>

It was revealed some time later that Silvermane was killed during a shootout with [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]]'s gang at a New York City scrap yard. He was picked up by a magnet and dropped into a garbage compactor, crushing him to death and leaving his already weakened criminal syndicate without a leader. Months later, he apparently returns along with other deceased members of his gang during the Maggia's losing battle with the forces of [[Mister Negative]]. However, this is later revealed to be a ruse orchestrated by a mobster named Carmine: "Silvermane" is actually a lifelike robotic duplicate controlled by a hired [[Mysterio]] to give Carmine more influence within the Maggia and position him to take over. The tables are turned on Carmine when Mysterio uses the duplicate to murder him, seemingly as a plot to take over the Maggia himself.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #618-620</ref>

Silvermane's head is shown to still be alive as it was found by a young boy when he traveled into the scrap yard, before then being stolen by the [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]].<ref>''The Superior Foes of Spider-Man'' #3</ref> The head is used as leverage by [[The Superior Foes of Spider-Man]] to take control of the Maggia, but the team members turn on each other when it comes time to decide who will actually be in charge. Shocker protects Silvermane from the [[Punisher]]; in return, the crime boss nominates him as his successor to head the Maggia.<ref>''The Superior Foes of Spider-Man'' #17</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Silvermane is considered one of the Maggia's most legendary bosses. He was a superb hand-to-hand combatant, an excellent marksman, and a brilliant strategist and organizer. The use of magical potions temporarily granted him a form of immortality, allowing him to appear as a man in his early-to-mid 40s. His preferred weapons included various handguns and the Thompson .45 caliber machine gun. Later, Silvermane's brain, vital organs, and head were transplanted into a cyborg body, increasing his physical abilities and granting him superhuman strength and senses. However, Silvermane's remaining organic body parts are those of an elderly man, and thus extremely vulnerable.

==Other versions==

===Ultimate Marvel===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Silvermane had a brief cameo. With [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]] lying low due to legal problems, Silvermane, his chief rival, decided to work with fellow mobster [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] to remove the Kingpin from power. He told Hammerhead that all he needed was a little "up here" (referring to his intelligence). Hammerhead, however, wasn't interested in sharing power, breaking Silvermane's neck while saying "I think I got enough up here already."<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #79</ref> Silvermane was also mentioned as a leader of a mob family which included Hammerhead and that he owed a debt to [[Mister Sinister|Nathaniel Essex]].<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #14 (March 2002)</ref> The Ultimate incarnation's real name is shown in the ''Daily Bugle'' as '''Allan Silvermane''', though this is likely an alias as he is also referred to as Silvio Manfredi.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #79</ref>

===House of M===
Silvermane appeared in the ''[[House of M]]'' reality, portrayed as a younger crime boss and one of dozens of mobsters captured by the NYPD's elite [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood]] unit.<ref>''House of M: Avengers'' #3</ref>

==In other media==

===Television===
[[File:Spidermanep25.jpg|right|thumb|Silvermane (left) and [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]] in ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'']]
* Silvermane appeared in the 1980s ''[[Spider-Man (1981 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' animated series episode "Wrath of the Sub-Mariner", voiced by [[Paul Winchell]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} He and Man Mountain Marko arrive in New York to call a truce with the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]] after his scientist Dr. Everett develops a powerful solvent capable of eating through anything. Prior to this, [[Spider-Man]] intercepted them, but Silvermane could not be brought in since most of his crimes are on the West Coast.
* Silvermane appeared in the 1990s ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Jeff Corey]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} This version is an enemy of Spider-Man and the Kingpin, the latter of whom serves as his rival in New York's criminal underworld. He first appeared in the "[[Sinister Six|Insidious Six]]" arc, hiring [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] to capture Spider-Man. During the titular team's battle, Spider-Man rescued Silvermane from Kingpin, not realizing his true identity as a crime lord until much later. Following this appearance, Silvermane became obsessed with finding the Tablet of Time, an artifact capable of rejuvenating an individual's youth, so he could achieve immortality due to his irregular childhood. After locating it, he arranged for [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]] to steal it, kidnap [[Lizard (comics)|Dr. Curt Connors]] to decipher it, and take the scientist's family hostage to ensure his complicity. Though Spider-Man saved the Connors family and in spite of Dr. Connors warning of the tablet's instability, Silvermane uses it to make himself a young man (voiced by [[Townsend Coleman]]) before he becomes a child (voiced by Matthew McCurley) and a baby (voiced by Cannon Young), while Hammerhead steals the Tablet on Kingpin's behalf. In the episode "Partners", Silvermane retained his adult intellect despite becoming a baby, but required help from his daughter, Alisa Silver. Together, they persuaded [[Alistair Smythe]] to kidnap [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] and blackmail Spider-Man into apprehending [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]] so Silvermane can use [[Neogenic (comics)|neogenic]] technology to switch bodies with the web-slinger. During the procedure however, [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]] intervenes and accidentally takes Spider-Man's place, allowing the web-slinger, Black Cat, and Scorpion to escape. Following this, Vulture becomes a young man while Silvermane is returned to his original state.
* Silvermane appears in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Miguel Ferrer]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} This version is a crime lord, rival to Tombstone, and the father of [[Silver Sable|Sable Manfredi]]. The episode "Accomplices" revealed that Silvermane was arrested and jailed 12 years prior after [[Frederick Foswell]] exposed his criminal activities to the [[FBI]]. Tombstone subsequently took his territory while Sable ran his empire's remnants in his absence. In "Gangland", Silvermane joins a summit between him, Tombstone, and [[Doctor Octopus]]. After the meeting goes sideways and Spider-Man gets involved, Silvermane uses a hidden hydraulic exoskeleton to combat the web-slinger and the other crime bosses, only to be defeated and apprehended by the police. As of "Opening Night", Silvermane was remanded the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]]. Though he was released by the [[Norman Osborn|Green Goblin]] to kill Spider-Man while he was there to test the prison's security system, Silvermane was ultimately defeated and returned to his cell.
* Silvermane appears in the 2010s ''[[Spider-Man (2017 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Nolan North]].<ref>{{cite episode|title=Bring On the Bad Guys Pt. 3|series=Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=2|number=35|airdate=August 6, 2018}}</ref> Similarly to past depictions, this version is a notorious, elderly crime boss who sports an exoskeleton. In the episode "Bring on the Bad Guys Pt. 3", he takes [[Sons of the Tiger#Black Tiger|Abraham Brown]] hostage to force the [[Prowler (Marvel Comics)|Prowler]] to capture Spider-Man so he can collect on a bounty on the web-slinger's head. After Spider-Man convinces Prowler to help him stop Silvermane, the crime lord fights back, but is defeated by them and left for the police. After a minor appearance in "Critical Update", during which he was defeated by the [[Superior Spider-Man]], Silvermane appeared in "Goblin War, Part 3" as the leader of the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Goblin King]]'s Cyber Goblins. He fought Spider-Man and [[Harry Osborn|Hobgoblin]], but gets defeated by the duo.

===Video games===
* Silvermane appears in the beta versions of the [[SNES]] and [[Sega Genesis]] ''[[Spider-Man (1995 video game)|Spider-Man]]'' video games. However, he was replaced with a robot in the final versions.
* Silvermane appears as an exclusive villain in the [[Nintendo DS]] version of ''[[Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions]]'', voiced by [[Steven Blum]]. Having survived to the year [[Marvel 2099|2099]] due to his cybernetic body, he attempted to use a fragment of the Tablet of Order and Chaos to become immortal, only to be defeated by [[Spider-Man 2099]].
* Silvermane appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2]]'', as part of the "Cloak and Dagger" [[Downloadable content|DLC]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbr.com/lego-marvel-super-heroes-2-cloak-and-dagger-dlc/|title=Cloak & Dagger Join LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2|date=20 March 2018|work=CBR|access-date=21 April 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>

===Novels===
Silvermane appears in the novel ''Spider-Man: Forever Young'' (in which Spider-Man and his villains age normally over several decades) written by [[Stefan Petrucha]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The details of the tablet story are retold, with some elements being updated or changed, such as Silvermane being shown as having a disdain for personal electronic devices due to their lack of security as well as the Kingpin being left in a coma due to the shock of learning that his own son was the masked criminal known as the Schemer. The novel picks up two years after the original storyline, with Silvermane now randomly aging from childhood to adulthood as he attempts to force Curt Connors and Spider-Man to retrieve the tablet and stabilize his condition. Even after Connors's research asserts that the tablet essentially cycles someone through their reincarnations in one lifetime to try and achieve true [[karma]], Silvermane refuses to accept this and attempts to blackmail Spider-Man to help him after deducing his true identity. While [[Vanessa Fisk]] also seeks the tablet to help her husband, witnessing what Silvermane has become convinces her to find another way. Spider-Man eventually confronts Silvermane in an old church which the mob boss was using as a hide-out. The battle ends with a rage-filled Silvermane burning the church down to try and kill Spider-Man, and his ultimate fate is left unclear.
