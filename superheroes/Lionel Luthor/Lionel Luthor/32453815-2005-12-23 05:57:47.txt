'''Lionel Luthor''' is the name of [[Lex Luthor]]'s father in the ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'' [[television]] series. Lex's father also made several appearances or mentions in the original [[Superman]] comics upon which the show is based, though his name there was never given as being "Lionel."

==The Comics==
In the [[Silver Age of Comics|Silver Age]] era ''Superman'' comics, Lex's father was a fairly nondescript individual who moved his family to Smallville, where his son Lex became friends with [[Superboy]]. However, after Lex turned to a life of crime, Lex's father disowned his son, moving with the rest of his family (which included his wife and Lex's young sister Lena) out of Smallville and, in shame, changing their last names to "Thorul," an [[anagram]] for "Luthor."

Following [[John Byrne]]'s [[1986]] revamp of Superman's origins, Lex's parents' backstory was altered so that Lex's father and mother were killed in an [[automobile]] accident perpetrated by their son. Lex had taken out a large [[life insurance]] premium on the couple, which he used to launch his conglomerate [[LexCorp]].

With the [[2004]] comic series ''[[Superman: Birthright|Birthright]]'', Lex's family history has been altered yet again, incorporating elements similar to the ''Smallville'' television show.

==Smallville==

In the ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'' TV series, in which he is played by [[John Glover (actor)|John Glover]], Lionel Luthor is very different from his comic book counterparts, who were fairly quiet and low-key individuals. Lionel has some of the characteristics of the comic book Lex and was the one to have his parents (one of them named Lachlan Luthor) killed with the help of criminal [[Morgan Edge]].

Lionel Luthor is a sociopath; lying and deceit are his most powerful weapons. He also uses his abundance of wealth and his twisted mind to devise numerous plans to obtain what he wants --  because what Lionel Luthor wants, Lionel Luthor gets. 

This proves to be true most of the time, except when it comes to [[Clark Kent]] and the mystery of the [[Kawatche]] caves. Luthor does all he can to figure out who Clark Kent really is and, more importantly, where he came from. He, like most others in Smallville, hasn't had any luck deciphering either Kent or the caves. But what people really don't know is that Lionel already knows Clark's secrets from the time he pretented to be blind when his helicpoter was held down. But for some odd reason tells no one else.

Clark Kent and the caves were Lionel's primary missions, along with other usually business-related schemes. Unfortunately, Lex is also a victim of Lionel, as Lionel frequently puts Lex in harm's way under the motive of "making Lex stronger." 

Lex has survived many attempts on his life and his business, no thanks to his father. All Lex really wants from Lionel are the things that Lionel finds foreign: kindness, respect, and love.

Recently in "Smallville", Lionel had a transformation into a good man...or so it appears. Lex doesn't believe the change is real, but Lionel tries to prove it to him with wise advice and genuine concern. He has given up his more recent mission to find stones that will give him copious knowledge, a mission that Lex is now bent upon. 

As much as Lex tries to be his own person, there are signs that he will become what he has always fought against becoming: his father. Only time will tell if Lionel has truly changed into an honest citizen, and whether it is too late for Lex to make the same metamorphosis.

In the finale of season four, Lionel revealed his deceitful nature once again, blackmailing Lex to give him the stone owned by [[Lana Lang]] or else he would reveal Lana's killing of Genevieve Teague.  Lex refuses.  While Lex later tries to bargain with his father over the stones, the stone in Lionel's pocket gives off a massive force of energy, putting Lionel in a coma.  Lex orders his men to place Lionel in an upstairs bedroom, fully expecting him to die in the upcoming meteor shower.  Before departing, Lex tells Lionel that he is now the son Lionel raised him to be. However, Lionel is discovered to have survived the meteor shower, and is now instilled with all the knowledge of Krypton due to the stone in his pocket.

He later became a host for [[Jor-El]], as he saved Clark's life and restored his powers. He is one of the only three other people so far to know Clark's secrets.
