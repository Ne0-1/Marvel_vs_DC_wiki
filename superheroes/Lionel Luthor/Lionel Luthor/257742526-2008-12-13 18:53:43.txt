'''Lionel Luthor''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[television series]] ''[[Smallville]]'', portrayed continuously by [[John Glover (actor)|John Glover]]. Initially a recurring guest in [[Smallville (season 1)|season one]], the character became a series regular in [[Smallville (season 2)|season two]] and continued with that status until he was written out of the show in [[Smallville (season 7)|the seventh season]]. In ''Smallville'', Lionel Luthor is the father of [[Lex Luthor (Smallville)|Lex Luthor]], and founder and [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of LuthorCorp. The character of Lex Luthor's father was first introduced under a different name in ''[[Superman]]'' comics by [[Jerry Siegel]] in 1961. Although Lex's father has appeared in other Superman-related media, ''Smallville'' represents the first time the character has become an intricate part of a Superman adaptation. Series developers [[Alfred Gough]] and [[Miles Millar]] created a new version of the character in 2001 to provide an antithesis to the parenting style of [[Characters of Smallville#Jonathan Kent|Jonathan]] and [[Characters of Smallville#Martha Kent|Martha Kent]].

In the 2001 series, Lionel Luthor goes from [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent's]] nemesis, developing multiple schemes directed at uncovering the secrets that Clark is hiding, to an ally who eventually gives his life to protect Clark's secret from Lex. In ''Smallville'', Lionel carries a strained relationship with his son, whom he sees as weak and tries to test on a regular basis. He also attempts to develop a romantic relationship with Martha Kent, following the death of Jonathan, assisting her in her advancement toward the [[United States Senate]]. 

Lionel's path from the dark side to the light side was one that was difficult for the writers, who felt like the character's arc failed to achieve the status they were looking for. Although they continued with the story arc, Lionel returned to using deceptive actions, only this time it was to protect Clark. He is characterized as being a sinister character, who will do what he can to further his own ambitions. Lionel's relationship with his son has been likened to that of [[Harry Osborn|Harry]] and [[Norman Osborn]] from the ''[[Spider-Man (film)|Spider-Man]]'' film.<ref name="Carabott"/>

In 1989, Lionel and his son [[Lex Luthor (Smallville)|Lex Luthor]] (Matthew Munn) come to visit Smallville, with Lionel intending to buy the Ross Creamed Corn company, when they are caught in a meteor shower that results in Lex losing all of his hair.

===In other media===
Before ''Smallville'', Lex's father made either brief appearances in the ''Superman'' comics, or was relegated to a mere mentioning. Lex's father first appears in ''[[Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane]]'' #23 (1961), in the story "The Curse of [[Lena Luthor|Lena Thorul]]!", written by Superman co-creator Jerry Siegel. Named "Jules", he is revealed to have disowned his criminal son and changed the family name to "Thorul". Jules and his wife Arlene are killed in a car accident.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Jerry Siegel]]|artist=[[Kurt Schaffenberger]]|story=The Curse of Lena Thorul!|title=[[Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane]]|volume=1|issue=23|date=February 1961|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref> In the 1978 [[Richard Donner]] [[Superman (film)|''Superman'' film]], as well as in [[Bryan Singer]]'s ''[[Superman Returns]]'', Lex briefly mentions his father, though he never reveals his father's name. Both films indicate that Lex's real estate schemes are based on advice his father gave him as a child.<ref>{{cite video|people=[[Richard Donner]] (director), Mario Puzo, David Newman, Leslie Newman, & Robert Benton (writers)|date=1978-12-15|title=Superman: The Movie|format=DVD|publisher=[[Warner Bros.]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite video|people=[[Bryan Singer]] (director), Michael Dougherty & Dan Harris (writers)|date=2006-06-28|title=Superman Returns|format=DVD|publisher=[[Warner Bros.]]}}</ref> In the live action [[Superboy (TV series)|''Superboy'']] television series, Lex's father appears in part one, of the two part episode, "Know Thine Enemy" in season four. In "Know Thine Enemy", [[Superboy]] becomes Lex Luthor in a virtural reality, where he watches as Lex grew up with an abusive father. This series does not give Lex's father a name either.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Know Thine Enemy|series=Superboy|serieslink=Superboy (TV series)|credits=Bryan Spicer (director) & J. M.

==Portrayal==
Lionel Luthor was created by Al Gough and Miles Millar specifically for the show, in an effort to provide a parallel to [[Ma and Pa Kent#Smallville|the Kents]], as an "experiment in extreme parenting".<ref name="genesis">{{cite book|last=Simpson|first=Paul|title=Smallville: The Official Companion Season 1|year=2004|publisher=[[Titan Books]]|location=London|pages=8â€“17|isbn=1840237955}}</ref> Although Lex's father has been depicted in other mediums in the past, the character of Lionel Luthor is entirely the creation of Alfred Gough and Miles Millar. Like Allison Mack, whose character Chloe Sullivan was also created for the show, Glover appreciates the "clear canvas" he has to work with when developing his portrayal of Lionel. In season one, John Glover had to travel from New York to Vancouver every week while filming his scenes, as Glover was already committed to stage acting in New York at the time.<ref name="JG1"/> John Glover looked to a friend's personal battle with cancer when trying to portray Lionel's struggle with terminal liver disease. Glover recounts that his friend was a "cheerleader to people", always supporting and boosting everyone when they were feeling bad. When he learned he had cancer he fought hard to get over it, but when he learned that it was terminal, that there was nothing he could do, he simply went to bed and stopped eating until he finally passed away in a week-and-a-half. This helped Glover understand how someone so powerful and full of life could end up taking their own life in the end â€” just as Lionel was preparing to do at the end of "Crisis" when he learned that there was nothing else he could do to stop his cancer.<ref name="JG3"/>

==Character development==
===Storyline progression===

In season two, Lionel moved from recurring figure to a series regular. This season featured the gradual unveiling of Lionel's increasing involvement with the characters of the show. It began with more direct involvement, by hiring Martha Kent ([[Annette O'Toole]]) as his assistant, and then indirectly when he became the conservator of the Kawatche caves and tried to unlock the mysterious of the symbols on the cave walls.<ref name="JG2">Simpson, Paul, (Season 2 Companion) pp.136-139</ref> For season three, Lionel materialized as the true villain of the show, specifically with his machinations to find out Clark's secret, and driving Lex into a psychotic break that allowed Lionel to use electroshock therapy on his son to erase the knowledge that Lionel co-opted Morgan Edge to kill Lionel's parents for their life insurance.<ref name="JG3">Simpson, Paul, (Season 3 Companion) pp. 130-133</ref> The creative team attempted to experiment with the character of Lionel Luthor in season four, creating a storyline scenario where Lionel turned away from his evil ways. Executive producer Greg Beeman concedes that the character development failed, and as a result Lionel returned to his normal self. To John Glover, trying to play Lionel as a straight arrow was "boring".<ref name="JG4">Byrne, Craig, (Season 4 Companion) pp. 130-133</ref>

Season five explored the relationship between Martha and Lionel. Both Annette O'Toole and Al Gough agree that there was a small bit of attraction for Martha, but that she would never act on that feeling. It was also never the producers' intentions to create a real romantic relationship between the two characters.<ref name="AT5">Byrne, Craig, (Season 5 Companion) pg. 134</ref> Most of Lionel's motivations in season five are shrouded in mystery, not even John Glover could make heads or tails of them. Glover admits to not being able to determine if his character is good or bad, so when he is portraying him on screen in season five he tries to present everything as if it was "good".<ref name="JG5"/> Glover believes that it was Lincoln Cole's (Ian Tracey) actions in "Mercy" that made Lionel begin to rethink everything that he has done, and some of the things about himself. By the end of the fifth season, Lionel has learned that people have a responsibility to each other.<ref name="JG5"/>

Writer/executive producer [[Brian Wayne Peterson|Brian Peterson]] laments that the creative team wanted to remind the audience that Lionel was still the same Lionel Luthor they had come know, so they intentionally held off on revealing Lionel's usual antics until season six's "Promise", where Lionel blackmails Lana into marrying Lex. Peterson was looking to "slap [the audience] in the face" with a reminder of who Lionel used to be. Even though Lionel blackmails Lana into marrying Lex, John Glover contends that the character was only trying to protect Clark, and he needed Lana's help to do that. By the time season six began airing, John Glover realized that Lex had started down the path of the dark side and that his time on the show would be limited. Glover hoped that Lionel would still be able to influence his son as the show progressed from that point, as he believed that his character would be useless on the show without such influencing abilities. Glover contends that the conflict between Lex and his father is something very positive for the show, as Lionel's endeavor to bond with Lex and the distrust between them "makes drama".<ref name="JG6">Byrne, Craig, (Season 6 Companion) pg.132</ref>

===Characterization===
John Glover characterizes Lionel as a businessman who is merely disappointed in his son. To Glover, Lionel is this "rich and powerful businessman" who sees his son as nothing more than a "wuss" and "fraidy-cat". It was important to Glover that Lionel appears as human as possible when Glover is portraying him on screen. As the actor puts it, he does not want to simply "twirl [his] mustache".<ref name="JG1"/> Glover describes Lionel as someone that will do whatever they need to do in order to get what they want. He characterizes Lionel as an intelligent man, who can read people easily. Lionel uses that ability to help further his goals. The character also has the ability to get past people's defenses, and get them to do what he wants. Glover thinks that that type of power would be great if it could be used to help someone other than Lionel.<ref name="JG2"/> Another characterization of Lionel is portrayed by the color scheme the surrounds him. The cold blues help to evoke the "sinister" nature of the character.<ref>{{cite news|author=Sandra Dozier|title=Season three DVD review|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/smallvilleseason3.php|publisher=DVD Verdict|date=2004-12-15|accessdate=2008-09-08}}</ref> Lionel is also often portrayed infront of a white or "clinical blue" background. Even Lionel's signature mane of hair is another characterization. Here, his hair is used to symbolize his power â€” by growing it out and refusing to style it, Lionel is attempt to shows that he is so powerful that he can do whatever he wants without any form of backlash.<ref>{{cite video|people=Al Gough, Miles Millar, Greg Beeman, Kent Horton, and Michael Rosenbaum|title="Memoria" commentary|format=DVD|publisher=[[Warner Bros. Television]]}}</ref>

===Relationships===
The relationship between Lionel and his son Lex is a strained relationship; it has been likened to the relationship [[Norman Osborn|Norman]] and [[Harry Osborn]] share in the ''[[Spider-Man (film series)|Spider-Man]]'' movie.<ref name="Carabott">{{cite news|author=Chris Carabott|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/715/715385p1.html|publisher=[[IGN]]|title=Smallville: Season Six|date=2006-07-28|accessdate=2007-08-27}}</ref> Glover tries to make Lionel appear as though he is trying to "toughen [Lex] up". The character is made to "go out of his way, to give [Lex] tests, so [Lex] can prove himself". Glover sees the character as someone who is a rich and powerful business man, who is disappointed in his son. Glover's goal, for season one, was to show Lionel's attempts to make Lex tougher; he interprets the character's motto, in regards to raising Lex, as "no risk, no rewards".<ref name="JG1">Simpson, Paul, (Season 1 Companion), pg.144</ref>
{{Quote_box|width=45%|align=right|quote="What I was working on, and continue to work on, is to see him strengthen Lex. Lionel doesn't seem to be a man who wants his son to be afraid, so he's gone out of his way to give him tests, so he can prove himself. That's what locking him inside the plant in "Jitters" was all about. Lionel makes the decision to close the gate. It's a tough decision, but he knows that if Lex survives, he will be a stronger person. No risk, no reward."|source=â€” Glover explains Lionel's parenting techniques.<ref name="JG1"/>}} 
Glover believes that Lionel has two competing agendas with Lex â€“ for Lex to become his own man, and for Lex to follow in his father's steps. This becomes a frustration for Lex, because Lionel wants his son to be both "loyal follower" and the "best person he can be". This all plays into Lionel's "pretty huge ego".<ref name="JG3"/> John Glover believes that if Lionel and Lex did not share the same blood, then Lionel would have "destroyed" Lex early on, as Lionel views his son as "weak".  Lionel is also bound by the fact that Lex is his heir, even though Lionel does not trust his son. Lionel's distrust stems partially from the fact that he believes that Lex is a bit spineless. As John Glover explains, "It's not that [Lionel is] meant to be a foe; it's just that the poor boy's weak, so [Lionel must] mold him. Lionel is continually trying to strengthen his son, to teach him. [Lex is] just a hard student."<ref name="JG4"/>

Another key relationship Lionel shares is with Martha Kent, Clark Kent's adoptive mother. First developed in season two, when Lionel hires Martha to be his assistant,<ref name="JG2"/> it is further developed in season five.<ref name="AT5"/> When Jonathan Kent died in season five, Glover felt like the attraction that Lionel had for Martha grew, because he now saw Martha as a single woman. For Lionel, Martha seemed to be more attainable now; Glover believes that what Lionel was seeking to attain was not based on some lustful attraction, but Martha's "goodness". When Lionel is around Martha he tries to present a man that she could be with; he consciously attempts to change years of selfish behavior. Writer Holly Harold believes that his relationship with Martha parallels Lex's relationship with Lana. Both men believe that these two women will be their saving grace, and pull them back from the dark side.<ref name="JG5"/> Although Annette O'Toole and Al Gough agree that Martha has a small attraction to Lionel, they also agree that nothing serious would ever come from it.<ref name="AT5"/>

Glover believes that Martha influenced Lionel to start believing in the fact that you need to sacrifice certain things to make the world a better place. With her leaving at the end of season six, Lionel no longer has that influence. Lionel is constantly battling the dark and light sides of his personality. According to series writer Caroline Dries, it is because of this balancing act that the audience never knows what his real motivations are. For Dries, this is embodied when he threatens Lana into marrying Lex, only to reveal later that it was all to protect Clark.<ref name="JG6"/> Glover describes his off-screen relationship with Annette O'Toole as being the reason why Martha and Lionel have such good chemistry. To the actor, when Martha and Lionel are talking to each other it really feels like he and O'Toole are sharing a conversation, and that level of trust is visualized on the camera.<ref name="JG5">Byrne, Craig, (Season 5 Companion) pp. 136-139</ref>

==Reception==

By season four, at least one reviewer felt that Lionel should have left the show at the hands of his terminal liver disease in season three. Maurice Cobbs, of DVD Verdict, felt that he was taking away from the primary character's (Clark Kent) screen time in season four.<ref>{{cite news|author=Maurice Cobb|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/smallvilleseason4.php|publisher=DVD Verdict|title=Season 4 DVD review|date=2005-10-19|accessdate=2008-09-08}}</ref>
