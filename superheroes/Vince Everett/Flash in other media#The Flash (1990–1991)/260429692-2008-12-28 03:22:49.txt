Throughout his 60 year history, [[the Flash]] has appeared in numerous media.

==Early animated appearances==
[[Image:Flashnkidstand.jpg|thumb|The Flash and [[Kid Flash]] on [[The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure]].]]

===''The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure''===
In 1967, ''[[The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure]]'' was produced by [[Filmation]] and featured seven minute shorts which starred various DC Universe heroes.  Wally West was featured in two of them as Kid Flash.

Wally West appears in a segment starring the Flash (Barry Allen)  titled "To Catch A Blue Bolt", which shows Barry and Wally changing into their Flash and Kid Flash uniforms using their rings.  It should be noted that Wally's appearance differs from his comic book counterpart.  He has black hair and his red and yellow color scheme is reversed from his second uniform.

Wally was also featured on the Teen Titans segment which featured [[Garth (comics)|Aqualad]], [[Donna Troy|Wonder Girl]], [[Roy Harper (comics)|Speedy]], and the Wally West version of Kid Flash as seen in the Flash segment.

He was voiced by Tommy Cook.

Flash appeared off and on in the ''[[Super Friends]]'' series throughout its run from 1973 to 1985. Flash appeared in ''[[Challenge of the Super Friends]]'', ''[[Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show]]'', and ''[[The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians]]''. 

In 1979, he appeared in the live-action ''[[Legends of the Superheroes]]'' specials, played by actor Rod Haase.

== Live Action appearances ==
===''The Flash ''TV series (1990-1991)===
{{main|The Flash (TV series)}}
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:TvFlash1.gif|thumb|left|[[John Wesley Shipp]] as the Flash on the [[The Flash (TV series)|TV series]].]] -->
''[[The Flash (TV series)|The Flash]]'' was a live action [[CBS]] television series that starred [[John Wesley Shipp]] and [[Amanda Pays]]. The Flash featured in the series was an amalgamation of the silver-age Flash, [[Barry Allen]], and the modern-age Wally West. The only resemblances between the TV Barry Allen Flash and the comic book Barry Allen Flash were his name, his profession as a forensic scientist, and his love interest Iris (who was very short lived as a love interest in the television series). Most of the elements in the television show were taken directly from the main story line in the first [[Wally West]] Flash comic books: The S.T.A.R. labs researcher Tina McGee, her and her husband's research into speed, her husband's allegedly fatal accident with their speed research, the Flash's ravenous appetite, heat problems (which were mitigated by the TV show Flash suit), and speed limit on the order of the speed of sound were all elements from the main Wally West comic book storyline.

The Flash's most famous villain in the series was the [[Trickster (comics)|Trickster]], played by [[Mark Hamill]], which oddly foreshadowed Hamill's subsequent success at voicing the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' and, later, the [[Trickster (comics)|Trickster]] in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''. [[Captain Cold]], played by Michael Champion, and [[Mirror Master]], played by [[David Cassidy]], also appeared in their own episodes. The complete series was released as a DVD set by Warner Bros. in 2006.

The Flash TV Special #1 comic introduced a variation on Kid Flash.  This particular version of the character was a teenage thief named Vince Everett.  Unlike The Flash, his powers didn't require eating to replenish.  His speed is pushed to the limit as he chases The Flash through an amusement park, eventually burning his powers out.

===Justice League of America pilot (1997) ===
The Flash (Barry Allen) was in a [[CBS]] live-action [[television pilot|pilot]] called ''[[Justice League of America (TV movie)|Justice League of America]]'', portrayed by Kenny Johnston.  The pilot did not air in the United States.  Similar to The Flash (TV series), this Flash appeared to be Barry Allen in name only, as he reflected Wally's age, ravenous appetite, and personality.  In addition, this version of Justice League was inspired by the [[Keith Giffen]]-era Justice League, of which Wally was a member.

===''Smallville''===
[[Image:Smallville-run2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bart Allen]] races Clark Kent in the ''Smallville'' episode "Run"]]

The Flash made guest appearances in the television series ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'', in the fourth-season episode "[[Smallville (Season 4)#Run|Run]]" (first aired October 20, 2004) and in the sixth season in the episode "[[Smallville (Season 6)#Justice|Justice]]" (first aired on January 18, 2007). He is played by [[Kyle Gallner]]. He is portrayed as a self-centered teenager who uses his powers for personal gain. He goes by the name [[Bart Allen]], but is shown to be carrying multiple ID cards also identifying him as [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]], [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]], and [[Wally West]]. His speed during his first episode run-in with Clark makes it clearly apparent that his super-speed ability and potential surpasses Clark's completely as he is seen running backwards but able to keep Clark completely at bay as he attempts to tag Bart.  Beyond that, Bart merely uses more of his power and disappears completely in plain sight of Clark, leaving him behind, bewildered but content.  Their mutual respect made it apparent that they had become friends towards the end (as Superman and Flash are good friends in the future), with allusions being made to forming a "league" one day.  It is mentioned that he got his powers through an accident, rather than genetics as in the actual comics, though it should be noted that at least one of the Flashes has gotten his powers through an accident. This incarnation of The Flash is also one of the few characters on Smallville who is not a 'Meteor Freak', meaning they have not acquired their powers through Kryptonite-related means via one of Smallville's infamous meteor showers.

Although commercials for "Run" billed him as "the Flash", he is never called by this name in the episode. Instead, in "Justice", he has been given the [[codename]] "Impulse". Like in the comics, Bart did not pick this name himself. In his second appearance, Bart has grown up some, but maintained roughly the same personality. However, he is now using his powers to help others. Along with [[Aquaman]], [[Green Arrow]], [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] and [[Black Canary]] he now works to stop one of [[Lex Luthor]]'s evil side projects, 33.1.

===Film===
In December 2004, [[David S.

==DC Animated Universe==
=== Superman: The Animated Series ===

The Flash appeared in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Charlie Schlatter]], in the second-season episode "Speed Demons". As in the traditional comic book storylines, the Flash and Superman race to find out who is faster, but the [[Weather Wizard]] gets in the way, which causes the two to work together. He also appears in ''Batman: Gotham Adventures'' #25 due to a theft in Central City leading him to Gotham.

The Flash in the [[Justice League (animated series)|''Justice League'' animated series]] is voiced by [[Michael Rosenbaum]] ([[Lex Luthor]] on the [[television series]] ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]''). This Flash is Wally West; however he is an [[wikt:amalgamation|amalgamation]] of Barry Allen and Wally West(in ''Justice League Unlimited'', Wally is a [[forensic scientist]], which was Barry's profession. Wally in the comics is an [[auto mechanic]]). Michael Rosenbaum also voiced [[Kid Flash]] for a Fall 2005 episode of [[Teen Titans (animated series)|''Teen Titans'' animated series]] entitled "Lightspeed".  He later appeared in a cameo in the episode "Calling all Titans" and then he reappeared fully in the episode "Titans Together".

The importance of the Flash as the "heart" of the Justice League was shown in the episode "A Better World", when his death in an alternate timeline triggered a series of events which turned that alternate League (the "[[Justice Lords]]") into virtual dictators of Earth. He has also proven key in saving the day in a few episodes, such as ''Divided We Fall'', in which he defeated the fused [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]]/[[Lex Luthor]] when all the other six founding Justice League members could not. In the process, he was drawn into the [[Speed Force]] (the first explicit use of the concept in the DCAU), and barely managed to escape. The episode "[[Flash and Substance (Justice League Unlimited episode)|Flash and Substance]]" is centered on the opening of the [[Flash Museum]] on "Flash Appreciation Day" in Central City, and featured many of the Flash's rogues in cameos, while focusing on [[Captain Boomerang]], [[Mirror Master]], [[Captain Cold]], and [[Trickster (comics)|The Trickster]] (voiced by [[Mark Hamill]]).  [[Linda Park (comics)|Linda Park]] also appears as a reporter covering the museum opening. Mirror Master alludes that Wally West may not have been the only Flash stating to the rest of the Rogues, "We've all been stopped by '''a''' Flash."<ref>Justice League Unlimited, episode #31 "[[Flash and Substance (Justice League Unlimited episode)|Flash and Substance]]."</ref> Additionally, the episode "The Great Brain Robbery", saw The Flash and Lex Luthor inadvertently changing consciousness-Wally West (inside Lex Luthor's body) is tasked with trying to figure out what has occurred, escape, and not be killed by the suspicious members of the Legion of Doom.

[[Image:Eclipsed.jpg|thumb|Flash as featured in the ''Justice League'' episode ''Eclipsed.'']] Wally West is the Flash featured as one of the seven founding members of the Justice League, in both the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' and ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' animated series.  His personality is more or less the same as it was from his appearance on ''Superman: The Animated Series'', and his flippant attitude is often used to provide comic relief from the often intense nature of his fellow Leaguers, though he is the featured hero in several episodes.  However, in one episode of ''Justice League Unlimited'', he complains to [[Elongated Man]] that he dislikes being viewed as the "teenage sidekick" even though he was part of the original seven.  His super fast metabolism, which results in him eating absurdly and inhumanly large portions of food, was something of a running gag on the series. Flash's endorsement of the "Lightspeed" candy bar (which created controversy fueled by a [[Glorious Godfrey|talk-show host who constantly dissed the League]] in one episode) was also a sort of running gag (no pun intended), as the bars make numerous other appearances, with Flash's picture on the wrapper in some cases. 

The Flash in this series is a hybrid of both [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] and Wally West.
 
Barry Allen elements of the JL/JLU animated Flash: he's the only existing Flash in the series, he was never Kid Flash.  He lives in [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]], Barry Allen's hometown as opposed to [[Keystone City]], Wally West's hometown.  He is a police scientist, which was Barry Allen's job in the comics.  His origin is also that of Barry Allen's.  This Flash also fought some of Barry Allen's enemies throughout the series, such as [[Captain Cold]], [[Mirror Master]], [[Captain Boomerang]], [[Gorilla Grodd]], and [[Trickster (comics)|The Trickster]].  Wally also has the Flash ring, which was invented by Barry Allen in the comics, to store his Flash costume in.

Wally West elements of the JL/JLU animated Flash: he has red hair and green eyes like Wally does in the comics.  This Flash also has Wally's girl-crazed, occasionally big-headed manner, paired with a childlike attitude and intelligence.  When he tries to vibrate his molecules through solid objects, he causes them to explode as opposed to passing through the object intangible like Barry Allen would.  [[Linda Park (comics)|Linda Park]], Wally's girlfriend and eventual wife in the comics, appears in an episode and is a suggested love interest for the Flash.

Wally appears without the Flash costume twice in the series.  The first time is in the Starcrossed episodes when the Justice League decides to remove their costumes and move around as ordinary people to hide and regroup.  The Flash appears reluctant to trust his fellow Justice League members with his [[secret identity]], whereupon Batman shows he already knows by exclaiming, "Wally West!" while pointing at the Flash, followed up by revealing the secret identity of [[Superman]] ([[Clark Kent]]) and himself (Bruce Wayne).  Wally then removes his mask and [[Wonder Woman]] tells him that she likes his red hair just before mussing it.  The second time is in the episode "Flash and Substance", where Wally is shown to be working at the forensics lab before taking a half day off to attend the Flash museum opening. Wally's face is also exposed in one other episode, "The Great Brain Robbery".  When his mind is switched with Lex Luthor's, Lex removes the mask to see if he can at least "figure out" who the Flash really is by looking at his face in the bathroom mirror, only to state in an annoyed tone, "I have no idea who this is."

===''The Batman''===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:The Flash (The Batman).jpg|thumb|right|The Flash as he appears on ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'']] -->
The Flash appeared at the end of ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'''s  fourth season finale ''The Joining'' as one of the members of the Justice League. The Flash was properly introduced in the episode ''A Mirror Darkly'' to help Batman battle Mirror Master. Also [[Charlie Schlatter]] reprised the role of Flash from the above Superman episode ''Speed Demons''. Creators stated that their version was intended to be Barry Allen, but they'd leave it up to the viewers to decide for themselves. He is more similar to [[Bart Allen]] in attitude, and personality.

===''Teen Titans'' animated series===
[[Image:KidFlash.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Kid Flash in "Lightspeed"]]
Kid Flash debuts in the episode of the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series entitled "Lightspeed".  While the character's true identity is never given, the fact that [[Michael Rosenbaum]] voices the character implies that he is intended to be Wally West as Rosenbaum also voices an older Flash/Wally West in ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'', as well as insisting he vibrated through the bars the H.I.V.E Five trapped him in, an ability only Wally has demonstrated.  In the series, he is portrayed similar to the way that Wally was portrayed in comic books.  His personality is often considered "laid back", and he is known to be comedic and sometimes flirtatious.  When Jinx asks Kid Flash who he is working for, he says, "I work alone these days", implying a previous partnership with [[Flash (Barry Allen)|The Flash]].

When the Titans are searching for the [[Brotherhood of Evil]] and the [[Titans East]] have gone back home to [[Steel City]], Kid Flash decides to help protect Jump City and stop crimes from being committed.  When he interferes with the [[Fearsome Five|H.I.V.E. Five's]] criminal deeds, he flirts with their leader, [[Jinx (DC Comics)|Jinx]], and tries to make her reevaluate her life of crime.  Shortly afterwards the H.I.V.E Five attempts to capture him and, after [[Madame Rouge]] tires him out, Jinx traps him in an electric field. Jinx nearly hands him over to Madame Rouge, but she frees him when she realizes Madame Rouge doesn't appreciate her help and that Kid Flash was the one who truly cared for her well-being.  Afterwards, Jinx quits the H.I.V.E. Five and joins forces with him as a Titan, and the two quickly form a romantic relationship.

He briefly appears in a shot of all the Titans in "Calling All Titans", where it is revealed the Titans have come in contact with him and he has a Titan communicator.  In "Titans Together", he brings Jinx to the Brotherhood's lair as his ally and helps the speedsters [[Más y Menos]] and the other Titans freeze the Brothehood's member villains inside [[cryogenics|cryogenic]] cases.  Más y Menos are very impressed by Kid Flash's speed and abilities.

Kid Flash is one of the few Titans in the animated series to fully resemble his comic counterpart.  However, Wally's eyes in the comics are currently green.  The design of Kid Flash with blue eyes remains consistent with his original appearances, pre-Crisis.

Kid Flash is mentioned in issue #28 of ''[[Teen Titans Go!]]'', and makes [[cameo appearance]]s in several other issues.  He is featured in a worldwide race against Más y Menos in issue #34.  Although knowing that Jinx obviously has feelings for him, he inadvertently flirts with [[Raven (comics)|Raven]], [[Argent (comics)|Argent]], and several other girls behind while running the race, making Jinx jealous and causing him to lose the race to Más y Menos when Jinx shows up at the finish line and confronts him about his flirtatious nature.
