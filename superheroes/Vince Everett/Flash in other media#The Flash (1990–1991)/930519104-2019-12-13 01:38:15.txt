In September 2009, Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. had launched a new division, DC Entertainment Inc., in order to better expand the DC brand. In October 2009, Charles Roven was asked about the future of the Flash. In the interview, Roven explained that he was involved but that he was removed from the project because ''The Flash'' was speeding in the direction Warner Bros. had in mind, leaving the possible film in uncertainty. The day after Dan Mazeau responded to the article by saying, "Just to chime in on your latest article: The Flash has not been hobbled. Everything is moving forward as planned… I’m still writing the script. Geoff Johns is still consulting. Flash fans have no cause for concern, and — IMO — lots to be excited about." In February 2010, it was reported that Warners was expected to announce its DC slate in the coming months populated by characters like The Flash and Wonder Woman."{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

====''Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice'' (2016)====
{{main|Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice}}
The Flash's first appearance in the DCEU happened in ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' where the character made two small appearances. He first appears in a nightmare sequence showing up in the Batcave, wearing a futuristic armor version of his classic costume, in order to warn Bruce Wayne of an upcoming threat. Although the scene is left for interpretation, with Flash stating that Lois is the key and that Bruce was right about "him" mixed in with a frustrated realization that he is "too soon", it indicates a possible post-apocalyptic future which the character is trying to prevent. He is later seen again, this time in the "real world" and in the present day when Wonder Woman is going through the recorded footage of several metahuman sightings. He appears in a liquor store's security camera footage, wearing his normal civilian clothes, stopping a burglar.

====''Suicide Squad'' (2016)====

Professor Zoom later reveals this to have been a trap for the Flash. He intends to kill Flash along with thousands of others, and link Flash's name to the destruction. The Justice League shows up and defuses all the bombs that Zoom set and all the villains are arrested. Shaken by what transpired, and full of thoughts about his dead mother, Flash parts from his Justice League colleagues and chooses to be alone. The next day, Flash wakes up in a universe where history has happened differently. Here, he has none of his powers, his mother is alive, Iris is married to someone else, and a feud between Aquaman and Wonder Woman has triggered an all-out global war. Flash blames Professor Zoom for messing with the timeline. He enlists the help of Batman (Thomas Wayne, Bruce's father) to regain his speed. He does so by recreating the accident that gave him his powers. The first attempt fails, leaving Barry with third degree burns. The second attempt, however, is successful, with him fully regaining his speed. Barry then gathers up a band of heroes including Cyborg (a government agent), and the Shazam Kids (all of whom become one Captain Thunder when they all say the wizard Shazam's name together) to stop the war and restore the timeline. However, during a fight with Professor Zoom, Flash discovers that Zoom did not do anything, and that it was he who altered time by going back and saving his mother. After Batman kills the evil speedster, Flash travels back and prevents himself from saving his mother, but once again fractures time, creating another alternate timeline which differs in subtler ways from the original. Barry is also in a better place with his mom's death, and is reunited with Iris. He also gives Batman (Bruce Wayne) a letter that Thomas asked him to deliver to his son.

====''The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure''====
[[File:Filmation Flash.png|thumb|The Flash and [[Kid Flash]] on ''[[The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure]]'']]
In 1967, ''[[The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure]]'' was produced by [[Filmation]] and featured eighteen, seven-minute shorts which starred various DC Universe heroes, including three solo adventures of the Flash ([[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]]).

Wally West, as Kid Flash, appears in two segments starring the Flash (Barry Allen); they are titled "Take a Giant Step" and "To Catch a Blue Bolt"; the latter shows Barry and Wally changing into their Flash and Kid Flash uniforms using their rings. Wally's appearance differs from his comic book counterpart. He has black hair, and the red and yellow color scheme of his second costume is reversed, as well as simplified to put him in trunks.

Barry was also seen as a member of the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]], which also included [[Superman]], [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]], [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]], [[Hawkman (Katar Hol)|Hawkman]], and sometimes [[Aquaman]].

Wally additionally appeared as Kid Flash on the Teen Titans segment, which also featured [[Garth (comics)|Aqualad]], [[Donna Troy|Wonder Girl]] and [[Roy Harper (comics)|Speedy]].

The Flash and Kid Flash were voiced by Cliff Owens and Tommy Cook, respectively.

====''Super Friends''====
Flash (Barry Allen) appeared off and on in the ''[[Super Friends]]'' series throughout its run from 1973 to 1986. He was voiced by [[Jack Angel]].

====DC animated universe====
The Flash appeared in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Charlie Schlatter]], in the second-season episode "Speed Demons". As in the traditional comic book storylines, the Flash and Superman race to determine who is faster, but the [[Weather Wizard]] gets in the way, leading the two of them to work together. He also appears in ''Batman: Gotham Adventures'' #25 after a theft in Central City leads him to Gotham.

The Flash in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' animated series is voiced by [[Michael Rosenbaum]] ([[Lex Luthor (Smallville)|Lex Luthor]] on the [[television series]] ''[[Smallville]]''). This Flash is eventually identified as Wally West; however, he is an [[wikt:amalgamation|amalgamation]] of Barry Allen and Wally West (in ''Justice League Unlimited'', Wally is a [[Forensic science|forensic scientist]], which was Barry's profession. Wally in the comics is an [[auto mechanic]]).

The importance of the Flash as the "heart" of the Justice League was shown in the episode "A Better World", when his death in an alternate timeline triggered a series of events which turned that alternate League (the "[[Justice Lords]]") into virtual dictators of Earth. He has also proven key in saving the day in a few episodes, such as "Divided We Fall", where he defeated the fused [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]]/[[Lex Luthor]] when the other six founding Justice League members could not. In the process, he was drawn into the [[Speed Force]] (the first explicit use of the concept in the DCAU), and barely managed to escape. The episode "Flash and Substance" is centered on the opening of the [[Flash Museum]] on "Flash Appreciation Day" in Central City, and featured many of the Flash's rogues in cameos, while focusing on [[Captain Boomerang]], [[Mirror Master]], [[Captain Cold]], and [[Trickster (comics)|The Trickster]] (voiced by [[Mark Hamill]]). [[Linda Park (comics)|Linda Park]] also appears as a reporter covering the museum opening. Mirror Master alludes to the fact that Wally West may not have been the only Flash, saying to the rest of the Rogues, "We've all been stopped by '''a''' Flash."<ref>Justice League Unlimited, episode #31 "[[Flash and Substance (Justice League Unlimited episode)|Flash and Substance]]".</ref> Additionally, the episode "The Great Brain Robbery", saw the Flash and Lex Luthor inadvertently changing consciousness—Wally West (inside Lex Luthor's body) is tasked with trying to figure out what has occurred, escape, and not be killed by the suspicious members of the Legion of Doom.

[[File:The Flash (Justice League).jpg|thumb|322px|The Flash, as he appeared in ''Superman: The Animated Series'' ''Justice League'' and ''Justice League Unlimited.'']] Wally West is the Flash featured as one of the seven founding members of the Justice League, in both the ''Justice League'' and ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' animated series. His personality is more or less the same as it is from his appearance on ''Superman: The Animated Series'', and his flippant attitude is often used to provide comic relief from the often intense nature of his fellow Leaguers. He is the featured hero in several episodes. However, in one episode of ''Justice League Unlimited'', he complains to [[Elongated Man]] that he dislikes being viewed as the "teenage sidekick" even though he was part of the original seven. His super fast metabolism, which results in him eating absurdly and inhumanly large portions of food, was something of a running gag in the series. Even in the episode "The Great Brain Robbery" Lex Luthor, after possessing Flash's body, defeats Justice League members and before running eats some food. Flash's endorsement of the "Lightspeed" candy bar (which created controversy fueled by a [[Glorious Godfrey|talk-show host who constantly dissed the League]] in one episode) was also a sort of running gag, as the bars make many other appearances, in some cases with Flash's picture on the wrapper.

Barry Allen elements of the ''JL''/''JLU'' animated Flash: he is the only existing Flash in the series, he was never Kid Flash (although in the episode "Flash and Substance", a Kid Flash costume is briefly seen on display in the Flash museum). He lives in [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]], Barry Allen's hometown as opposed to [[Keystone City]], Wally West's hometown. He is a police scientist, which was Barry Allen's job in the comics. His origin is also that of Barry Allen's. This Flash also fought some of Barry Allen's enemies throughout the series, such as Captain Cold, Mirror Master, Captain Boomerang, [[Gorilla Grodd]], and The Trickster. Wally also has the Flash ring, which was invented by Barry Allen in the comics, to store his Flash costume in.

Wally West elements of the ''JL''/''JLU'' animated Flash: he has red hair and green eyes like Wally does in the comics. This Flash also has Wally's girl-crazed, occasionally big-headed manner, paired with a childlike attitude and intelligence. Despite his personality opposing the no-nonsense disposition of his fellow Leaguer, [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]] (the [[Green Lantern]]), the two are shown to be very close friends. Wally also shows a strong friendship with [[Hawkgirl|Shayera Hol]] that is touched on several times through both the ''JL'' and ''JLU'' series, usually in a sisterly way, including him being the first to hug her after her decision to resign. In ''Justice League Unlimited'' third season's debut episode "I Am Legion", Flash says, "She loves me. She's like the big sister I never had. Only, you know... short."

Wally appears without the Flash costume twice in the series. The first time is in the "Starcrossed" episodes when the Justice League decides to remove their costumes and move around as ordinary people to hide and regroup. The Flash appears reluctant to trust his fellow Justice League members with his [[secret identity]], whereupon Batman shows he already knows by revealing his identity saying, "Wally West" while pointing at the Flash. He then reveals the secret identity of Superman ([[Clark Kent]]) and himself (Bruce Wayne). Wally then removes his mask and [[Wonder Woman]] tells him that she likes his red hair just before ruffling it. The second time is in the episode "Flash and Substance", where Wally is shown to be working at the forensics lab before taking a half day off to attend the Flash museum opening. Wally's face is also exposed in one other episode, "The Great Brain Robbery". When his mind is switched with Lex Luthor's, Lex removes the mask to see if he can at least "figure out" who the Flash really is by looking at his face in the bathroom mirror, only to state in an annoyed tone, "I have no idea who this is", although the costume is still kept. This episode is especially written for Rosenbaum, due to his role as Luthor on ''Smallville''.

====''The Batman''====
The Flash appeared at the end of ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'''s fourth-season finale "The Joining" as one of the members of the Justice League. The Flash was properly introduced in the episode "A Mirror Darkly" to help Batman battle Mirror Master. Also [[Charlie Schlatter]] reprised the role of Flash in the Superman episode "Speed Demons". The creators stated that their version was intended to be Barry Allen, but they would leave it up to viewers to decide for themselves. This Flash is known to speak at an unusually fast pace.

====''Teen Titans'' animated series====
[[File:Kid Flash (Teen Titans animated series).jpg|thumb|left|150px|Kid Flash as he appears in ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]].'']]
Kid Flash debuts in the episode of the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series entitled "Lightspeed". While the character's true identity is never revealed, the fact that [[Michael Rosenbaum]] voices the character implies that he is intended to be Wally West since Rosenbaum also voices an older Flash/Wally West in ''Justice League''. In the series, he is portrayed in a similar way as Wally was portrayed in comic books. His personality is often considered laid back, and he is known to be comedic and sometimes flirtatious. When Jinx asks Kid Flash who he is working for, he says, "I work alone these days", implying a previous partnership with the Flash.

When the Titans are searching for the [[Brotherhood of Evil]] and the [[Titans East]] have gone back home to [[Steel City]], Kid Flash decides to help protect Jump City and prevent crimes from being committed. When he interferes with the [[Fearsome Five|H.I.V.E. Five's]] criminal deeds, he flirts with their leader, [[Jinx (DC Comics)|Jinx]], and tries to make her reevaluate her life of crime. Shortly afterwards the H.I.V.E Five attempts to capture him, and after [[Madame Rouge]] tires him out, Jinx traps him in an electric field. Jinx nearly hands him over to Madame Rouge, but she frees him when she realizes Madame Rouge does not appreciate her help, and that Kid Flash was the one who truly cared for her well-being. Afterwards, Jinx quits the H.I.V.E. Five and joins forces with him as a Titan; the two quickly form a romantic relationship.

He appears briefly in a shot of all the Titans in "Calling All Titans", where it is revealed the Titans have come in contact with him and he has a Titan communicator. (Presumably, this is why he decided to go to Jump City in the first place, though this is never confirmed on-screen.) In "Titans Together", he brings Jinx to the Brotherhood's lair as his ally and helps the speedsters [[Más y Menos]] and the other Titans freeze the Brotherhood's member villains inside [[cryogenics|cryogenic]] cases. Más y Menos are very impressed by Kid Flash's speed and abilities.

Kid Flash is one of the few Titans in the animated series to fully resemble his comic counterpart. However, Wally's eyes in the comics are green. The design of Kid Flash with blue eyes remains consistent with his original appearances, pre-Crisis.

Kid Flash is mentioned in issue #28 of ''[[Teen Titans Go!]]'', and makes [[cameo appearance]]s in several other issues. He is featured in a worldwide race against Más y Menos in issue #34. Although knowing that Jinx obviously has feelings for him, he inadvertently flirts with [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]], [[Argent (comics)|Argent]], and several other girls while running the race. This makes Jinx jealous and causes him to lose the race to Más y Menos when she shows up at the finish line and confronts him about his flirtatious nature. They remain close, however, and share their first official kiss in issue #53.

====''Batman: The Brave and the Bold''====
The Jay Garrick version of the Flash appears in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "Trials of the Demon!".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0903/17/index.htm |title=Comics Continuum by Rob Allstetter: Tuesday, March 17, 2009 |publisher=Comicscontinuum.com |date=2009-03-17 |accessdate=2010-09-13 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526202956/http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0903/17/index.htm |archivedate=May 26, 2011 }}</ref> In the teaser plot Jay (voiced by [[Andy Milder]]) teams up with Batman to stop [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]] and [[Silver Banshee|Scream Queen]]. Jay returns in a silent cameo in "The Fate of Equinox!", allowing [[Doctor Fate]] to temporarily give Batman his super-speed for the fight against the god-like [[Libra (DC Comics)|Equinox]].

In "The Golden Age of Justice!", Jay Garrick is shown to be a long-time member of the Justice Society of America as the team battles their old foe [[Per Degaton]]. In "Sidekicks Assemble!", in a flashback, the Barry Allen version of the Flash appears in a cameo with the Justice League. In "Requiem for a Scarlet Speedster!", Jay Garrick, Barry Allen (this time voiced by [[Alan Tudyk]]) and Wally West (voiced by [[Hunter Parrish]]) all appear, as the three Flashes and Batman take on Professor Zoom.

====''Young Justice''====
All versions of the Flash appear in ''Young Justice''. In the beginning, the Wally West version of Kid Flash appears as a main character in the animated adaptation of ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'', with Barry Allen appearing as his mentor and a member of the Justice League and Jay Garrick as a "retired speedster".<ref>{{cite web | author =G-Man | title =Comic-Con: Brave and the Bold & Young Justice Panel | publisher =Comic Vine | date =2010-07-24 | url =http://www.comicvine.com/news/comic-con-brave-and-the-bold-young-justice-panel/141716/ | accessdate =2010-07-26 | url-status =live | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20100727075558/http://www.comicvine.com/news/comic-con-brave-and-the-bold-young-justice-panel/141716/ | archivedate =2010-07-27 }}</ref> The character is voiced by actor [[Jason Spisak]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Fitzpatrick, Kevin |url=http://www.ugo.com/tv/comic-con-2010-young-justice |title=Comic-Con 2010: Young Justice Goes Under Cover |publisher=[[UGO Networks]] |date=2010-07-23 |accessdate=2010-07-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726145835/http://www.ugo.com/tv/comic-con-2010-young-justice |archivedate=July 26, 2010 }}</ref> After the first episode, Kid Flash wears a modified outfit that includes goggles and pads on his shoulders and an active camouflage unit. He is usually seen eating something in most episodes, which he attributes to the high metabolism he must maintain for his super speed. Kid Flash has a habit of collecting a souvenir from each battle, including one of Mister Twister's robotic eyes, a Kobra cultist's mask, an arrow fired by [[Tigress (DC Comics)|Artemis]] (although at the time he thought it was fired by Speedy), [[Cheshire (comics)|Cheshire]]'s mask, and even the [[Doctor Fate|Helm of Nabu]]. He keeps his souvenirs on a shelf in Mount Justice. It is mentioned that, unlike his mentor, Barry Allen, he does not have the ability to vibrate through solid objects. He is shown as having a strict disbelief in magic, believing everything can be explained with science—though it is left ambiguous at the end of the episode "Denial" whether or not he has come to accept the "truth" about the supernatural after his experiences with [[Doctor Fate|Kent Nelson]]. Later dialogue related to Dr. Fate indicates that he at least accepts that the Helmet of Fate is a powerful and dangerous artifact. The episode "Coldhearted" centers around Wally making a cross-country dash on his sixteenth birthday to deliver a transplant heart to a young girl in the middle of an artificial snowstorm caused by five floating fortresses. Although Wally initially resents this assignment, as his teammates are working alongside the Justice League to take down the fortresses, he realizes the importance of the mission and manages to reach the hospital in time, despite being attacked by Vandal Savage during the journey. When he arrives he is initially mislead into believing that he arrived too late, due to the time he spent fighting Savage, and the patient had died, but this was revealed to be another misdirection tactic. Wally learns that the girl in question is Queen Perdita of Vlatava, and his distractions were engineered by Count Vertigo. Wally tricks Vertigo into a confession and he is imprisoned. In the episode "Insecurity", Kid Flash consoles Artemis over her fears of being replaced by Red Arrow, but is later enraged after her selfish attempts to mislead and outperform Red Arrow allow [[Sportsmaster]] and Cheshire to escape. In "Usual Suspects", he appears to forgive her after it is revealed why Artemis allowed Sportsmaster and Cheshire to escape.

In the second-season episode "Salvage" it is revealed that Wally has retired from being Kid Flash and is living with Artemis in Palo Alto (a nod to show creator Greg Weisman who went to [[Stanford]]). They have been dating since the end of the first season. His habit of collecting souvenirs is taken over by new Team member [[Beast Boy]]. Wally has been shown to be slower than both his uncle Barry Allen, the second Flash, and Bart Allen (Impulse), his first cousin once removed, as seen in the episode "Bloodlines". Later in the season he, along with Nightwing and Kaldur and Artemis, fakes Artemis' death to allow her to infiltrate Black Manta's organization using the magical disguise of Tigress. In the penultimate episode "Summit", Artemis is exposed as a mole to Black Manta, the Light and the alien [[Reach (comics)|Reach]], but is rescued from them by the entire team, including Wally, who has briefly come out of retirement. In the season two finale, Artemis and Wally work together to destroy one of 21 Reach devices which were set to destroy the planet. Flash (Barry) and Impulse (Bart) are required to produce enough kinetic energy to reverse the final device, and Wally joins them to increase their chances of success, but his slower speed leads to him acting as a release valve for the excess energy and he is vaporized. The team is greatly affected by Wally's death, and Bart takes up the mantle of Kid Flash in Wally's honor. This was likely a homage to Barry Allen's death and Wally West succeeding him in ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''.

====''Mad''====
The Flashes (Jay Garrick, Barry Allen, and Wally West with Bart Allen as Kid Flash) appear in ''[[Mad (TV series)|Mad]]'' where they try to appeal to Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman about being called "Super Friends."{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

====''Teen Titans Go!''====
Kid Flash appears in the ''[[Teen Titans Go! (TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'' episode "Multiple Trick Pony", voiced by [[Will Friedle]]. In contrast to their relationship in the comics, Robin and Kid Flash have a fierce rivalry in this show.

====''Vixen''====
Barry Allen (voiced by [[Grant Gustin]]) appears in the animated series, ''[[Vixen (web series)|Vixen]]'', which is part of the [[Arrowverse]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/guggenheim-butters-on-agent-carters-future-arrows-rogues-more |title=GUGGENHEIM, BUTTERS ON "AGENT CARTER'S" FUTURE, "ARROW'S" ROGUES & MORE |last=Brooks |first=Tamara |website=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=March 6, 2015 |accessdate=March 7, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Wr9z6Nmc?url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/guggenheim-butters-on-agent-carters-future-arrows-rogues-more |archivedate=March 7, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Live-action===

====''The Flash'' (1990–1991)====
[[File:The Flash (John Wesley Shipp).jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[John Wesley Shipp]] as the titular protagonist of the television series ''[[The Flash (1990 TV series)|The Flash]]''.]]
{{Main|The Flash (1990 TV series)}}

''[[The Flash (1990 TV series)|The Flash]]'' was a live action television series on [[CBS]] that starred [[John Wesley Shipp]] and [[Amanda Pays]]. The Flash featured in the series was an amalgamation of the silver-age Flash, Barry Allen, and the modern-age Wally West. The only resemblance between the TV Barry Allen Flash and the comic book Barry Allen Flash were his name, his profession as a forensic scientist, and his love interest [[Iris West]] played by [[Paula Marshall]] (who was very short lived as a love interest in the television series). In this version, while working as police detective, Barry was working in the crime lab at the Central City Police Department headquarters one night when a lightning bolt struck his lab, dousing him in electricity and nearby chemicals which soon gave him the ability to run at superhuman speeds, just like in the comics.

The series also included and featured an older brother for Barry named Jay Allen (named after [[Jay Garrick]] the original Flash) who was also a police officer and a motorcycle cop. Jay was killed in the line of duty by a criminal gang leader named Nicholas Pike. After that, Barry donned a special red prototype deep sea diving-suit from Russia designed to withstand friction and pressure, and called himself the Flash. By using his new costume and powers, Barry captured Pike and brought him to justice. From then on, Barry used his identity as Flash to help bring down other criminals in Central City. He became a hero full-time.

Most of the elements in the television show were taken directly from the main story line in the first Wally West Flash comic books: The [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] researcher [[Tina McGee]], she and her husband's research into speed, her husband's allegedly fatal accident with their speed research, the Flash's ravenous appetite, heat problems (which were mitigated by the TV show's Flash suit), and speed limit on the order of the speed of sound were all elements from the main Wally West comic book storyline.

The Flash's most famous villain in the series was the [[Trickster (comics)|Trickster]], played by [[Mark Hamill]], who later went on to voice the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' and, later, the Trickster in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''. [[Captain Cold]], played by Michael Champion, and Mirror Master, played by [[David Cassidy]], also appeared in their own episodes. The complete series was released as a DVD set by Warner Bros. in 2006.

The ''Flash TV Special'' #1 comic introduced a variation on Kid Flash. This particular version of the character was a teenage thief named Vince Everett. Unlike the Flash, his powers did not require eating to replenish. His speed is pushed to the limit as he chases the Flash through an amusement park, eventually burning out his powers.

Shipp later returned to the Flash franchise twenty years after the series' cancellation; first in an episode of ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]],'' titled "Requiem for a Scarlet Speedster!” voicing [[Professor Zoom]], and later in recurring roles as Barry's father Henry Allen and Henry's parallel universe counterpart Jay Garrick in [[The CW]]'s ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]''.

An image of Shipp's Flash appears on an episode of ''The Flash'' (2014), as [[Earth-Two|Earth-2]] [[Harrison Wells]], [[Cisco Ramon (Arrowverse)|Cisco Ramon]] and Barry travel through the Arrowverse multiverse to get to Earth-2. This makes this series apart of the [[Arrowverse]] as a different universe.

====''Justice League of America'' pilot (1997)====
The Flash (Barry Allen) was in a [[CBS]] live-action [[television pilot|pilot]] called ''[[Justice League of America (TV movie)|Justice League of America]]'', portrayed by Kenny Johnston. The pilot did not air in the United States. Similar to ''The Flash'' TV series, this Flash appeared to be Barry Allen in name only, as he reflected Wally's age, ravenous appetite, and personality. In addition, this version of Justice League was inspired by the [[Keith Giffen]]-era Justice League, of which Wally was a member.

====''Smallville''====
[[File:Bart Allen (Kyle Gallner).png|thumb|100px|upright|[[Bart Allen]] in the ''Smallville'' episode "Justice"]]
The Flash made guest appearances in the television series ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'', in the fourth-season episode "[[Smallville (Season 4)#Run|Run]]" (first aired October 20, 2004), and in the sixth season in the episode "[[Smallville (Season 6)#Justice|Justice]]" (first aired on January 18, 2007). He is played by [[Kyle Gallner]]. He is portrayed as a self-centered teenager who uses his powers for personal gain. He goes by the name [[Bart Allen]], but he is shown to be carrying multiple ID cards also identifying him as [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]], Barry Allen, and Wally West. His speed is depicted as being well in excess of that of Clark. Not only is he able to run backward and match Clark's top speed, but is able to run fast enough that Clark, even moving at top speed, cannot follow his movements.

Their mutual respect made it apparent that they had become friends towards the end (as Superman and Flash are good friends in the future), with allusions being made to forming a "league" one day. It is mentioned that he got his powers through an accident, rather than genetics as in the comics, although at least one of the Flashes has gotten his powers through an accident. This incarnation of the Flash is also one of the few superpowered characters on ''Smallville'' who is not a "Meteor Freak", meaning they have not acquired their powers through Kryptonite-related means via one of Smallville's infamous meteor showers.

Although commercials for "Run" billed him as "the Flash", he is never called by this name in the episode. Instead, in "Justice", he has been given the [[codename]] "Impulse". Like in the comics, Bart did not pick this name himself. In his second appearance, Bart has matured somewhat, but he maintained roughly the same personality. However, he is now using his powers to help others. Along with Aquaman, [[Green Arrow]], [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] and [[Black Canary]] he now works to stop one of Lex Luthor's evil side projects, 33.1.

Kyle Gallner reprises his role as Impulse for a final time in the [[Smallville (season 8)|season eight]] finale, "Doomsday". The character's presence continues to be felt thereafter, though he does not directly feature. For example, in the ninth-season episode "[[Smallville (Season 9)#Absolute Justice|Absolute Justice]]", the Golden Age Flash, Jay Garrick, is seen in flashbacks, getting arrested with the other [[Justice Society]] members. Impulse appeared in two additional episodes; a still frame of Kyle Gallner from earlier seasons was used to give the appearance that Bart was attending a Justice League meeting via videoscreen in the season 9 finale, "Salvation". The character is also present in the season 10 episode "Icarus" at the funeral of [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Carter Hall]], but his face is not shown. In the series' penultimate episode, villains are assembled and are each given a hero to kill. Bart is given to [[Captain Cold]]. The character later features prominently in the [[Smallville season 11|comic book continuation to the TV series]] (2012&ndash;).

====''The Flash'' (unproduced The WB series)====
In 2003, it was reported that The WB was planning a ''Flash'' TV series with [[Todd Komarnicki]] signed on to write and executive produce it. Inspired by the 1960s science fiction drama ''[[The Time Tunnel]]'', the series would have been a loose adaptation of the Flash, depicting him as a fresh-out-of-college Gotham City resident who uses his powers to travel backwards and forwards in time, going on missions. As with ''Smallville'', the series would have eschewed superhero costumes altogether.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2003/scene/news/frog-net-pilots-a-new-flash-1117892334/|title=Frog net pilots a new Flash|work=Variety|last=Adalian|first=Josef|date=September 11, 2003|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604035841/http://variety.com/2003/scene/news/frog-net-pilots-a-new-flash-1117892334/|archivedate=June 4, 2016}}</ref>

On July 30, 2013, it was announced that ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' co-creators Greg Berlanti and [[Andrew Kreisberg]], and ''Arrow'' pilot director [[David Nutter]] and [[Geoff Johns]], would develop a Flash TV series for [[CW Television Network|The CW]]. The series would be the origin story of Barry Allen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2013/07/cw-eyes-flash-series-with-arrows-greg-berlanti-andrew-kreisberg-david-nutter/|title=CW Eyes ‘Flash’ Series With ‘Arrow’s Greg Berlanti, Andrew Kreisberg & David Nutter|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=July 30, 2013|accessdate=July 30, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801015113/http://www.deadline.com/2013/07/cw-eyes-flash-series-with-arrows-greg-berlanti-andrew-kreisberg-david-nutter/|archivedate=August 1, 2013}}</ref> Kreisberg revealed after the announcement, that Allen would be a recurring character on ''Arrow'' in three episodes of season 2, all written by Berlanti, Kreisberg and Johns, and that the last of the episodes will act as a [[backdoor pilot]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/flash-writers-preview-cws-newest-595705|title='Flash' Writers Preview the CW's Newest Superhero|last=Goldberg|first=Lesley|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=July 30, 2013|accessdate=July 30, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801185107/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/flash-writers-preview-cws-newest-595705|archivedate=August 1, 2013}}</ref> On September 13, 2013, [[Grant Gustin]] was chosen to portray Allen.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/glees-grant-gustin-set-as-625751|title='Glee' Star Set as CW's Flash|last=Goldberg|first=Lesley|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=September 13, 2013|accessdate=September 13, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130914062206/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/glees-grant-gustin-set-as-625751|archivedate=September 14, 2013}}</ref>

In November 2013, it was announced that the third appearance of Allen on ''Arrow'' would no longer be a backdoor pilot, with the studio opting to make a traditional pilot instead. By doing so, it allowed the creative team to flesh out the Flash's story and his world on a bigger budget, instead of being constrained to incorporating ''Arrow'' characters within a backdoor pilot. The decision was made after CW executives saw material from Barry Allen's first two episodes on ''Arrow'', which were very well received. The pilot was written by Berlanti, Kreisberg and Johns, directed by Nutter, and executive produced by Berlanti, Kreisberg, Nutter and Melissa Kellner Berman. The show would still be tied to ''Arrow'', since that is where Barry Allen made his first appearance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/11/cws-the-flash-to-do-standalone-pilot-instead-of-arrow-backdoor-pilot-episode/|title=CW’s ‘The Flash’ To Do Stand-Alone Pilot Instead Of ‘Arrow’ Backdoor Pilot Episode|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|date=November 18, 2013|accessdate=November 18, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131119211413/http://www.deadline.com/2013/11/cws-the-flash-to-do-standalone-pilot-instead-of-arrow-backdoor-pilot-episode/|archivedate=November 19, 2013}}</ref> On January 29, 2014, ''The Flash'' was officially ordered for a pilot episode.<ref>{{cite news|last=Goldberg|first=Lesley|title='Supernatural' Spinoff, Rob Thomas' 'iZombie,' 'Flash' Ordered to Pilot at CW|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/supernatural-spinoff-rob-thomas-izombie-675484|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=January 29, 2014|accessdate=January 29, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301182716/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/supernatural-spinoff-rob-thomas-izombie-675484|archivedate=March 1, 2014}}</ref>

==In popular culture==
* In the ''[[Simpsons]]'' episode "[[New Kids on the Blecch]]", [[Comic Book Guy]] dresses up like the Flash and says, "No one can outrun The Flash" until he falls and gets stuck in an open manhole. In the earlier episode "[[Marge vs. the Monorail]]", Lyle Lanley, is addressing a class of children and is asked whether his [[monorail]] can outrun the Flash. After replying in the affirmative, he is asked if Superman can outrun the Flash, to which he replies "Sure, whatever..."
* In 2002, the lead character in the movie ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'' a [[confidence trick|con man]], [[Frank Abagnale Jr.]] played by [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] is shown with a stack of Flash comics in his room. He later uses the alias "Barry Allen" to elude Carl Hanratty, played by [[Tom Hanks]], a reference to his love for the comic book. Later, at a diner, Carl realizes that Barry Allen is an alias when a waiter asks him if he collects Flash comics after seeing the name, "Barry Allen". This allows Carl to find Frank's real name. At the end of the film, Carl visits Frank in prison and gives him some Flash comics as a present. 
* In the 2003 movie ''[[Daddy Day Care]]'', [[Jimmy Bennett]] plays Tony, a boy who thinks he is the Flash and refuses to take off his costume. A sugar rush actually affords him super speed for a while. He is eventually convinced to stop being the Flash after a conversation with Marvin ([[Steve Zahn]]), where Tony sees that he knows nothing else about the Flash.
* The band "[[Jim's Big Ego]]" has a song entitled "The Ballad of Barry Allen", about the Flash. Jim Infantino, the lead singer of the band, is the nephew of Flash co-creator Carmine Infantino.
* In the first season of the TV series ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', the character [[Walt Lloyd]] is seen reading the Spanish version of a Flash comic ''Green Lantern/Flash: Faster Friends'' #1 on several occasions. In the third-season episode "Catch–22", [[Charlie Pace|Charlie]] and [[Hugo "Hurley" Reyes|Hurley]] are seen debating the question of whether the Flash could defeat Superman in a footrace.

* Flash appeared in the ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' episode "Losin' the Wobble", voiced by [[Nathan Fillion]]. The Flash, Superman, and Wonder Woman are unable to stop [[Reverse-Flash]] which leads to them talking about their reverse opponents. When Wonder Woman mentions her reverse opponent Negative Wonder Woman, a black version of Diana who's costume is the reverse of Diana's (it doesn't cover her breast or pubic area, and only covers the parts of her body which are uncovered for Diana's costume) who rides in a visible jet, she happens to be robbing a nearby bank. Negative Wonder Woman flees and Wonder Woman sarcastically remarks "Don't touch her or anything", Flash responds to this by telling Superman, "I'd touch her till she couldn't walk, Booyah!" (indicating he would have sex with her). It was not revealed if this version of the Flash was to be Barry Allen or Wally West. Both the Flash and Kid Flash appear in the episode, "They Took My Thumbs". They appear in the "Take your Sidekicks to Work" skit, where the sidekicks visit the Watchtower. During Wonder Woman's speech, Kid Flash uses his super speed to remove Diana's costume rendering her nude in front of the sidekicks and League members. As Wonder Woman takes her clothes back, the Flash admonishes Kid Flash for his actions, but after Diana leaves it is revealed that the Flash secretly is proud of Kid Flash's prank and they celebrate with a "''[[Speedster (fiction)|Super speed]] [[high five]]''". Kid Flash and the sidekicks are later teleported over a live volcano and killed by [[Martian Manhunter]]'s sidekick ''Martian Boyhunter'' (though Martian Manhunter takes the fall, as everyone believes that Boyhunter exists only in his mentor's imagination). The Flash joins the other League members in giving a beating to Martian Manhunter (Martian Boyhunter turns visible and proceed to call everyone "''douches''").
* In ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'' episode "The Middle Earth Paradigm", the four main characters dress as the Flash when they are invited to go to a Halloween party but change as they did not want to go in the same costume. (Although Raj suggests that they "Walk right behind each other all night and look like one person going really fast.") The character of Sheldon is also frequently seen to be wearing a Flash T-shirt. Similarly in the episode "The Work Song Nanocluster", Sheldon is shown dressed as the Flash and imitating his powers, after drinking coffee. In the episode "The Justice League Recombination", Sheldon again wears a Flash costume for a New Year's Eve party, though this time the others appear as different DC characters: [[Leonard Hofstadter]] as Green Lantern, [[Howard Wolowitz]] as Batman, [[Rajesh Koothrapali]] as Aquaman, [[Penny (The Big Bang Theory)|Penny]] as Wonder Woman and Penny's current boyfriend, Zack as Superman. Later on in "The Dependence Transcendence", a sleep-deprived Sheldon has a dream where the Flash (portrayed by [[Brandon Jones (actor)|Brandon Jones]]) persuades him that energy drinks are beneficial.
* A guy dressed as the Flash was one of the superheroes on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]''.
* At [[Six Flags]] [[theme park]]s, which frequently use DC superheroes around the park, visitors can spend additional money to buy "The Flash Pass" which allows them speed through lines to certain attractions. Promotions for the pass frequently feature the Flash himself.

This meets with blank stares from the other characters. He continues on with, "Jay Garrick? Wally (pauses), like she was moving really fast" (In reality, Illyria manipulated the flow of time so that she was moving far too quickly to be seen).
* In the show ''[[No Ordinary Family]]'' when Stephanie Powell finds out she can time travel via super speed, her friend and assistant Katie mentions the Flash.
* The Flash fights [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] from the ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' in the popular ''[[ScrewAttack]]'' series Death Battle and won. He is also featured in One Minute Melee, another ''ScrewAttack'' show, where he fought [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]] from the eponymous series in season 1 and ends up losing when his opponent turns into Super Sonic.
