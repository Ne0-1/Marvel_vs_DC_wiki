Throughout his 60 year history, [[the Flash]] has appeared in numerous media.

==Early animated appearances==

A version of the Flash guest-starred in the animated series, ''The Adventures of Aquaman'' in 1968. Flash appeared off and on in the ''[[Super Friends]]'' series throughout its run from 1973 to 1985. Flash appeared in [[Challenge of the Super Friends]], [[Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show]], and [[The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians]]. 

In 1979, he appeared in the live-action ''[[Legends of the Superheroes]]'' specials, played by actor Rod Haase.

==The Flash TV series (1990-1991)==

''[[The Flash (TV series)|The Flash]]'' was a live action [[CBS]] television series that starred [[John Wesley Shipp]] and [[Amanda Pays]]. The Flash featured in the series was an amalgamation of the silver-age Flash, [[Barry Allen]], and the modern-age Wally West. The only resemblances between the TV Barry Allen Flash and the comic book Barry Allen Flash were his name, his profession as a forensic scientist, and his love interest Iris (who was very short lived as a love interest in the television series). Most of the elements in the television show were taken directly from the main story line in the first [[Wally West]] Flash comic books: The S.T.A.R. labs researcher Tina McGee, her and her husband's research into speed, her husband's allegedly fatal accident with their speed research, the Flash's ravenous appetite, heat problems (which were mitigated by the TV show Flash suit), and speed limit on the order of the speed of sound were all elements from the main Wally West comic book storyline.

The Flash's most famous villain in the series was the [[Trickster (comics)|Trickster]], played by [[Mark Hamill]], which oddly foreshadowed Hamill's subsequent success at voicing the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' and, later, the [[Trickster (comics)|Trickster]] in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' . [[Captain Cold]], played by Michael Champion, and [[Mirror Master]], played by [[David Cassidy]], also appeared in their own episodes. The complete series was released as a DVD set by Warner Bros. in 2006.

The Flash (Barry Allen) was in a [[CBS]] live-action pilot called ''[[Justice League of America (Live action)|Justice League of America]]'', portrayed by Kenny Johnston. The pilot did not air in the United States.

==DC Animated Universe==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Flash-animated.gif|thumb|left|[[Wally West]] as the Flash in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]''.]] -->
The Flash appeared in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Charlie Schlatter]], in the second-season episode "Speed Demons". As in the traditional comic book storylines, the Flash and Superman race to find out who is faster, but the [[Weather Wizard]] gets in the way, which causes the two to work together. He also appears in ''Batman: Gotham Adventures'' #25 due to a theft in Central City leading him to Gotham.

The Flash in the [[Justice League (animated series)|''Justice League'' animated series]] is voiced by [[Michael Rosenbaum]] ([[Lex Luthor]] on the [[television series]] ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]''). This Flash is Wally West; however he is an [[wikt:amalgamation|amalgamation]] of Barry Allen and Wally (in ''Justice League Unlimited'', Wally is a [[forensic scientist]], which was Barry's profession. Wally in the comics is an [[auto mechanic]]). Michael Rosenbaum also voiced [[Kid Flash]] for a Fall 2005 episode of [[Teen Titans (animated series)|''Teen Titans'' animated series]] entitled "Lightspeed".  He later appeared in a cameo in the episode "Calling all Titans" and then he reappeared fully in the episode "Titans Together".

Some fans criticized the ''Justice League'' animated series characterization of the Flash, mainly due to the chauvinistic dialogue in early episodes. However, others argued that he provided a needed foil to the other characters; his humorous attitude and setting reflects Silver Age roots. The importance of the Flash as the "heart" of the Justice League was shown in the episode "A Better World", when his death in an alternate timeline triggered a series of events which turned that alternate League (the "[[Justice Lords]]") into virtual dictators of Earth. He has also proven key in saving the day in a few episodes, such as ''Divided We Fall'', in which he defeated the fused [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]]/[[Lex Luthor]] when all the other six founding Justice League members could not. In the process, he was drawn into the [[Speed Force]] (the first explicit use of the concept in the DCAU), and barely managed to escape. The episode "[[Flash and Substance (Justice League Unlimited episode)|Flash and Substance]]" is centered on the opening of the [[Flash Museum]]. Many of the Flash's rogues make cameos in this episode, while focusing on [[Captain Boomerang]], [[Mirror Master]], [[Captain Cold]], and [[Trickster (comics)|The Trickster]] (voiced by [[Mark Hamill]]).  [[Linda Park (comics)|Linda Park]] also appears as a reporter covering the museum opening. Mirror Master alludes that Wally West may not have been the only Flash stating to the rest of the Rogues, "We've all been stopped by '''a''' Flash."<ref>Justice League Unlimited, episode #31 "[[Flash and Substance (Justice League Unlimited episode)|Flash and Substance]]."</ref>

==The Batman==
The Flash appeared at the end of the Season 4 finale ''The Joining'' as one of the members of the Justice League. The Flash was properly introduced in the episode ''A Mirror Darkly'' to help Batman battle Mirror Master. Also [[Charlie Schlatter]] reprised the role of Flash from the above Superman episode ''Speed Demons''.

==Smallville==
[[Image:Smallville-run2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bart Allen]] races Clark Kent in the ''Smallville'' episode "Run"]]

The Flash made guest appearances in the television series ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'', in the fourth-season episode "[[Smallville (Season 4)#Run|Run]]" (first aired [[October 20]], [[2004 in television|2004]]) and in the sixth season in the episode "[[Smallville (Season 6)#Justice|Justice]]" (first aired on January 18, 2007). He is played by [[Kyle Gallner]]. He is portrayed as a self-centered teenager who uses his powers for personal gain. He goes by the name [[Bart Allen]], but is shown to be carrying multiple ID cards also identifying him as [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]], [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]], and [[Wally West]]. His speed during his first episode run-in with Clark makes it clearly apparent that his super-speed ability and potential surpasses Clark's completely as he is seen running backwards but able to keep Clark completely at bay as he attempts to tag Bart.  Beyond that, Bart merely uses more of his power and disappears completely in plain sight of Clark, leaving him behind, bewildered but content.  Their mutual respect made it apparent that they had become friends towards the end (as Superman and Flash are good friends in the future), with allusions being made to forming a "league" one day.  It is mentioned that he got his powers through an accident, rather than genetics as in the actual comics, though it should be noted that at least one of the Flashes has gotten his powers through an accident. This incarnation of The Flash is also one of the few characters on Smallville who is not a 'Meteor Freak', meaning they have not accquired their powers through Kryptonite-related means via one of Smallville's infamous meteor showers.

Although commercials for "Run" billed him as "the Flash", he is never called by this name in the episode. Instead, in "Justice", he has been given the [[codename]] "Impulse". Like in the comics, Bart did not pick this name himself. In his second appearance, Bart has grown up some, but maintained roughly the same personality. However, he is now using his powers to help others. Along with [[Aquaman]], [[Green Arrow]] and [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]], he now works to stop one of [[Lex Luthor]]'s evil side project, 33.1.

==Film==
In December 2004, [[David S. Goyer]] was attached to write and direct a [[superhero film]] based on the [[fictional character|fictional]] [[DC Comics]] character The Flash.<ref>{{cite news | author=Claude Brodesser | coauthors=Cathy Dunkley | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117915172.html?categoryid=1350&cs=1 | title=WB shines Flash light | publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=[[2004-12-16]] | accessdate=2007-02-12 }}</ref>  Goyer expressed interest in having actor [[Ryan Reynolds]] portray [[Wally West]],<ref>{{cite news | author=Clint Morris | url=http://www.moviehole.net/news/4718.html | title=Exclusive Interview: David Goyer | publisher=Moviehole.net | date=[[2004-12-18]] | accessdate=2007-02-12 }}</ref> with Reynolds expressing his own interest in the role.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0503/20/index.htm | title=Wizard World L.A.: Ryan Reynolds | publisher=Comics Continuum | date=[[2005-03-20]] | accessdate=2007-02-12 }}</ref>  In June 2005, Goyer was still developing the first script draft for ''The Flash'' and had yet to finalize negotiations with Reynolds.<ref>{{cite news | author=Jeff Otto | url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/622/622613p1.html | title=Goyer on ''Flash'' & ''Thor'' | publisher=[[IGN]] | date=[[2005-06-05]] | accessdate=2007-02-12 }}</ref>  In February 2007, Goyer departed from the project, citing creative differences with the studio.<ref>{{cite news | author= | url=http://comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=18724 | title=No ''Flash'' for David Goyer | publisher=ComingSoon.net | date=[[2007-02-03]] | accessdate=2007-02-12 }}</ref>  Goyer's script was considered dark-themed,<ref name="levy">{{cite news | author=Borys Kit | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i942a6313d5bbee00232d4b3bf4691924 | title=News 'Flash': Levy to helm | publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=[[2007-02-05]] | accessdate=2007-02-12 }}</ref> including both [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] and Wally West as The Flash and drawing on seminal comicbook runs by [[Mike Baron]], [[Mark Waid]], and [[Geoff Johns]].<ref>{{cite news | author= | url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/761/761295p1.html | title=Goyer Ankles ''The Flash'' | publisher=[[IGN]] | date=[[2007-02-03]] | accessdate=2007-02-12 }}</ref> 

Later in February 2007, director [[Shawn Levy]] was announced to be attached to ''The Flash'' and to oversee the writing of the new draft, which would use elements of Goyer's script.<ref name="levy" />  Ryan Reynolds expressed interest in the role once more of The Flash if the new script's incarnation was Wally West.<ref>{{cite news | author=David Sgargetta | url=http://www.moviehole.net/interviews/20070209_exclusive_interview_ryan_reyno.html | title=Exclusive Interview : Ryan Reynolds | publisher=Moviehole.net | date=[[2007-02-09]] | accessdate=2007-02-12 }}</ref>

In October 2007, director [[David Dobkin]] said that he was signed on to direct ''The Flash'', replacing Shawn Levy.  Dobkin said that the film would work as a spin-off from the upcoming ''Justice League of America'' film.  He said that the incarnation of the Flash would be [[Wally West]].<ref>{{cite news | author=Shawn Adler | url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2007/10/27/exclusive-david-dobkin-takes-flash-reins-spills-details/ | title=David Dobkin Takes ‘Flash’ Reins, Spills Details | publisher=[[MTV]] | date=[[2007-10-27]] | accessdate=2007-11-17 }}</ref>
