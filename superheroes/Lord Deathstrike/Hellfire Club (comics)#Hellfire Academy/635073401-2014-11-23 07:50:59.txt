The '''Hellfire Club''' is a fictional society within the [[Marvel Universe|Marvel Comics Universe]] that often comes into confrontation with the mutant superhero team, the [[X-Men]].  Although the Club appears to merely be an international social club for wealthy elites, its clandestine '''Inner Circle''' seeks to influence world events, in accordance with their own agenda.

Created by the ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' writer/artist duo of [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], they were heavily influenced by a 1966 episode of the British television series ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' ("[[A Touch of Brimstone]]").<ref name=xcompanion2>''X-Men Companion II''. 1982. Fantagraphics Books.</ref> The name "[[Hellfire Club]]" in fact has a historical precedent, having been a popular name for [[gentlemen's clubs]] in the 18th century. Additionally, the hierarchy of the Inner Circle is modeled on the pieces of a chess set, with Black and White sets of Kings, Queens, Bishops and Rooks.

The Hellfire Club and its Inner Circle were introduced in "[[The Dark Phoenix Saga]]", attempting to subvert the X-Men's [[Jean Grey]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #129-135</ref> This incarnation, composed most notably of Black King [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]] and White Queen [[Emma Frost]], would remain prominent for many years. After their initial confrontations, the Hellfire Club and the X-Men settled into an uneasy alliance.<ref name="uxm209">''Uncanny X-Men'' #209</ref><ref name="nm51">''New Mutants'' (vol. 1) #51</ref> This eventually fell by the wayside as endless power struggles perpetuated a series of upheavals within the Inner Circle. The club has appeared in two X-Men animated series (''[[X-Men: The Animated Series]]'' and ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]''), both times being renamed as simply The Inner Circle, due to the hesitations to use the word Hellfire in animated children series. Members of the Hellfire Club appeared in 2011's ''[[X-Men: First Class]]'' as the main villains, led by Sebastian Shaw and Emma Frost.

==Publication history==
In creating the Hellfire Club, ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist/co-writer [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] drew heavily upon a 1966 episode of the British spy series ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' entitled "[[A Touch of Brimstone]]".<ref name=xcompanion2/> In the episode, agents John Steed and Emma Peel attempt to infiltrate a secret society named after the [[Hellfire Club]] of the 18th century, whose members of the "Inner Circle" all wear period costumes. Emma Peel's guise as "the Queen of Sin", dressed in a black leather corset, would be the model for the Club's Queens, her first name even borrowed for White Queen [[Emma Frost]]. The leader of the episode's club was played by actor [[Peter Wyngarde]], best known for his role as [[Jason King (TV series)|Jason King]], forming the basis for [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]]'s new "Jason Wyngarde" identity.

The other members of Claremont and Byrne's Hellfire Club were similarly drawn from the names and faces of famous actors: [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]] was based on actor [[Robert Shaw (actor)|Robert Shaw]], [[Harry Leland]] on [[Orson Welles]] (who acted as Harry Lime in ''[[The Third Man]]'' and whose film ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' featured a reporter named Jed Leland), and [[Donald Pierce]] was based on [[Donald Sutherland]] (the surname referencing his [[Hawkeye Pierce]] character from ''[[MASH (film)|M*A*S*H]]'').<ref name=xcompanion2/>

Later writers would further the references to ''The Avengers'': Sir Patrick and Lady Diana, from the Philadelphia branch of the 1780s, are named after actors [[Patrick Macnee]] (John Steed) and [[Diana Rigg]] (Mrs. Emma Peel); conversely, the Black Queen of the London branch was revealed to be named Ms. Emma Steed.<ref>''Excalibur'' (vol. 1) #99</ref>

==Overview==
The Hellfire Club counts among its members the most famous, wealthy and influential members of society. Membership is passed on to descendants, and can also be earned through wealth or influence. While many accept the invitation simply for the pleasures that the Club offers, others seek wealth and influence. In fact, the purpose of the Hellfire Club is to obtain and exert power through politics and economic influence instead of outward conquest and domination. Since its foundation, the Hellfire Club has been involved in wars and assassinations to further the agendas of the Club's most powerful members.

The Club has branches in [[New York City]], [[London]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Paris]]; the various branches are all overseen by the Lord Imperial (a position long-held by Sir Gordon Phillips).<ref name="xxm3">''X-Treme X-Men'' #3</ref> Unbeknownst to most members is the Club's Inner Circle. Originally known as the Council of the Chosen, this secret group formed around [[Edward Buckman|Edward "Ned" Buckman]], each member assuming the titles of the major chess pieces. As White King, Buckman financed [[Steven Lang (comics)|Stephen Lang]]'s revived [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] program with the assistance of probationary member [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #100</ref> Shaw, now Black Bishop, began securing allies within the Club, meeting [[Harry Leland]], [[Emma Frost]], and [[Donald Pierce]], as well as his loyal assistant, [[Sage (comics)|Tessa]].<ref name=hellparents>''X-Men: The Hellfire Club'' #4</ref> Buckman, no longer having a use for the dangerously-ambitious Shaw, ordered a Sentinel attack on Shaw and his allies, resulting in the death of Shaw's lover, [[Lourdes Chantel]].  That night, Shaw and Emma Frost purged the entire Council of the Chosen, remaking it as the Lords Cardinal and appointing themselves Black King and White Queen.<ref name="Classic X-Men #6-7">''Classic X-Men'' #6-7</ref>

Shaw's Inner Circle soon turned their attentions to the [[X-Men]], kidnapping several of their number. [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]], as Jason Wyngarde, was made a probationary member pending his subversion of the X-Men's [[Jean Grey]] into the Hellfire Club's Black Queen, who they believed to be the descendant of [[Jean Grey#Ancestry|Lady Grey]]. Jean Grey was in fact the [[Phoenix (comics)|Phoenix]], a god-like cosmic entity who became unstable after Mastermind's psychic manipulations, turning into the [[Dark Phoenix Saga|Dark Phoenix]]. The Hellfire Club had failed, and the X-Men had taken their toll: Phoenix had driven Mastermind insane, [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] had crippled Donald Pierce and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] nearly killed Harry Leland and several guards.<ref name="uxm132-135">''Uncanny X-Men'' #132-135</ref>

Despite such setbacks, the Inner Circle continued to pursue its agenda. Shaw, using his connections to [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Senator Robert Kelly]] to initiate [[Project Wideawake|Project: Wideawake]], secured a government contract for Shaw Industries to manufacture [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]], profiting from the state of fear concerning the "mutant menace" despite secretly being a mutant himself. Frost meanwhile ran the [[Massachusetts Academy (comics)|Massachusetts Academy]], a prestigious preparatory school affiliated with the Hellfire Club that secretly trained a team of young mutants, known as the [[Hellions (comics)|Hellions]]. The Inner Circle also underwent some personnel changes, notably the expulsion of Donald Pierce for conspiring against his mutant colleagues,<ref name="mgn4" /> and the addition of [[Selene (comics)|Selene]] as Black Queen.{{issue|date=September 2014}}

Although the hierarchy of the Inner Circle goes through constant upheaval due to the competing egos and political motives of its members, it continues to exist in the same basic structure today.

Magneto briefly took the title of Grey King after Sebastian Shaw was voted out of the Inner Circle,{{issue|date=September 2014}} and with Emma Frost he began plotting against Black Queen Selene,{{issue|date=September 2014}} having planted Hellion Empath into Nova Roma via his relationship with New Mutant Magma prior to ousting Shaw.{{issue|date=September 2014}} However, when Magneto discovered the X-Man Rogue alive and well in the Savage Land (where Magneto was visiting),{{issue|date=September 2014}} Magneto abandoned the Hellfire Club and ultimately went into exile when he was rejected by Rogue when he murdered the Savage Land priestess Zaladane.{{issue|date=September 2014}} Meanwhile, Emma Frost attempted to force former Hellion Firestar, to rejoin the Hellions but was rebuked by Firestar and the New Warriors, who Firestar had joined.{{issue|date=September 2014}}

Disjointed, Selene exploited the chaos to launch a pre-emptive strike to slaughter the Lord Cardinals with aid from a group of young mutant "Upstarts" who were loyal to Selene. Points for each kill were awarded by the [[Gamesmaster (comics)|Gamesmaster]] and Magneto, Shaw, Pierce, and Frost were all targeted, before Selene herself was betrayed by Trevor Fritzroy and Gamemaster. During this time the Inner Circle of the London branch was working behind the American branch's back and was influencing [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] and the secret government agency ''Black Air''. [[Captain Britain]] (Brian Braddock) held a position for a short term on Shinobi Shaw's advisement to investigate its activities as they had mutual objectives. [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] collected evidence of their crimes and the Inner Circle was either arrested or went into hiding.

The Upstarts' uprising was quashed by Sebastian Shaw. He reinstated some of the old Inner Circle until he disbanded it due to his own invested interest in business pursuits. The Club still continued loosely partly due to Selene's influence, although it never had the same prestige as the original.

Sebastian Shaw again reformed a variation of the original Inner Circle with a nobler outlook posing as a force for good, which may have been a deception on his part. Tessa/Sage rejoined the Inner Circle to observe this and to assist [[Sunspot (comics)|Roberto da Costa]]'s usurping the position of Lord Imperial which Shaw had claimed.

The Hellfire Club was next under the leadership of Roberto da Costa as the Lord Imperial aided by Sage. [[Sat-Yr-9]] (under the guise of Courtney Ross) as the new White Queen, aided by her assassin [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]], her "Warrior White Princess". As with many members in the past, both Sat-Yr-9 and Viper have their own personal agendas.

Following [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], Sunspot remains as Lord Imperial, while Shaw resumes his activities, though under Sunspot's close watch. While Sat-Yr-9's whereabouts remain unknown, Viper returns to [[Madripoor]] to oversee [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]] operations<ref>''New Avengers'' #42</ref> and Sage became a member of the short-lived [[New Excalibur]], only to end up as one of the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]].

When the X-Men and many other powered or depowered mutants came to San Francisco, an offshoot of the Club, known as the Hellfire Cult, begins attacking mutants and "species traitors". Officially, their leadership appears to be [[Empath (comics)|Empath]], but the real power behind the scenes is the mysterious Red Queen. Their activities draw the attention of the X-Men.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' 500-502 (2008)</ref>

Kade Kilgore later took control of the Hellfire Club. Kilgore founded the Hellfire Academy where he recruited mutant outlaws as its faculty and started looking for students to attend this school.<ref name="Wolverine and the X-Men #20"/> The Hellfire Academy serves as the direct opponent for the [[X-Mansion|Jean Grey School for Higher Learning]].<ref>''Wolverine and the X-Men'' #23</ref>

==Organization==

===Lord Imperial===
The '''Lord Imperial''' is not a member of the Inner Circle or any particular branch of the Hellfire Club; the Lord Imperial is the true leader of the Hellfire Club and oversees all branches of it. As such, only a few individuals have held the title. Sir Gordon Phillips, while unknown at the time, ruled as Lord Imperial for most of the club's modern history, holding the position from before the club's introduction<ref name="xxm3"/> until his death from the [[Legacy Virus]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #388</ref>

* '''Sir Gordon Phillips''' - 
* '''[[Elias Bogan]]''' - 
* '''[[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]]''' - 
* '''[[Sunspot (comics)|Roberto da Costa (Sunspot)]]''' -

===Inner Circle===
The constant intrigue, backstabbing, blackmailing and politicking that plague the Hellfire Club have resulted in many changes of the Inner Circle, as new players seek out membership in order to obtain influence, power and wealth. The following lists the membership of each incarnation of the Inner Circle and the title they held; in descending order of rank are Kings and Queens, followed by Bishops and Rooks.

====The Council of the Chosen====
The original Inner Circle (existing prior to the club's introduction) consisted of:

* '''[[Edward Buckman|Edward "Ned" Buckman]]'''  - White King
* '''Paris Seville''' - White Queen
* '''[[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]]''' - Black Bishop

Sebastian Shaw was instrumental in the Hellfire Club's funding of [[Steven Lang (comics)|Stephen Lang]]'s resurrected [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] program, but having completed his purpose, White King Ned Buckman sought to eliminate the ambitious Black Bishop. After a Sentinel attack on Shaw's beach house resulted in the death of his lover, [[Lourdes Chantel]], Shaw and his ally [[Emma Frost]] purged the entire Council in one night and appointed themselves its Black King and White Queen.<ref name="Classic X-Men #6-7"/>

====The Lords Cardinal====
Shaw renamed The Council of the Chosen as The Lords Cardinal following his takeover of the New York branch, and appointed a number of allies to key positions. Frost began running the [[Massachusetts Academy (comics)|Massachusetts Academy]] at this time. [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Jason Wyngarde]], also known as Mastermind, later became a probationary member pending his subversion of the X-Men's [[Jean Grey]] into the Club's Black Queen.

* '''[[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]]''' - Black King
* '''[[Emma Frost]]''' - White Queen
* '''[[Donald Pierce]]''' - White Bishop
* '''[[Harry Leland]]''' - Black Bishop
* '''[[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Jason Wyngarde (Mastermind)]]''' - A probationary member who was presumably intended for one of the two Rooks.
* '''[[Phoenix (comics)|Phoenix]] (posing as [[Jean Grey]])''' - Black Queen
* '''[[Sage (comics)|Tessa]]''' - Shaw's personal aide.
* '''[[Warhawk (Marvel Comics)|Warhawk]]''' - Associate of the Hellfire Club.

Following Mastermind's failed subversion of Jean Grey,<ref name="uxm132-135"/> the title of Black Queen was once again empty. Donald Pierce reached the rank of White King but was later expelled for conspiring against his mutant colleagues.<ref name=mgn4>''Marvel Graphic Novel'' #4</ref> New members appointed during this period were:

* '''[[Selene (comics)|Selene]]:''' - Black Queen<ref name="New Mutants vol. 1 #23">''New Mutants'' (vol. 1) #23</ref>
* '''[[Friedrich Von Roehm]]''' - Black Rook<ref>''New Mutants'' (vol. 1) #22</ref>
* '''Emmanuel da Costa''' - White Rook<ref name="New Mutants vol. 1 #23"/>

A truce between the Hellfire Club and the X-Men began after an encounter with [[Nimrod (comics)|Nimrod]] resulted in the deaths of Leland and von Roehm.<ref name="uxm209"/> This truce soon grew into a formal alliance as [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] and [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], as the leaders of the X-Men and Xavier's school respectively, took over the shared position of White King.<ref name="nm51"/>

* '''[[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]]''' - White King (with Magneto)
* '''[[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]''' - White King, later Grey King

Storm and the X-Men would later seemingly die, leaving Magneto alone to deal with the Inner Circle. After a protracted power struggle, Magneto turned Emma Frost and Selene against Shaw and expelled him from Inner Circle, assuming both mantles as the new Grey King.<ref>''New Mutants'' (vol. 1) #75</ref> Magneto, while never formally resigning, would soon withdraw from the club, recognizing its role as another oppressor of mutantkind.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #275</ref> Frost would later be made comatose - marking her departure from the club - in a Sentinel attack that also killed the [[Hellions (comics)|Hellions]], mutant students of the club's [[Massachusetts Academy (comics)|Massachusetts Academy]].<ref name=uxm281282>''Uncanny X-Men'' #281-282</ref> White Rook Emmanuel da Costa was also killed around this period.<ref>''New Mutants'' (vol. 1) #98</ref>

====Shinobi Shaw's Upstart Inner Circle====
Selene had originally planned on creating a new Inner Circle with the help of the [[Upstarts (comics)|Upstarts]] - among them [[Shinobi Shaw]], son of Sebastian Shaw - but they betrayed and imprisoned her. Believing to have successfully assassinated his father,<ref>''X-Factor'' (vol. 1) #67</ref> Shinobi Shaw briefly took over the New York branch of the Club, seemingly with support from the [[Externals|External]] [[Candra (comics)|Candra]]. He offered membership in his Inner Circle to [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]],<ref name="hell29"/> Storm,<ref name="X-Men vol. 2 Annual #3">''X-Men'' (vol. 2) Annual #3</ref> and [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]] (also known as Roberto da Costa, son of former White Rook Emmanuel da Costa),<ref name="X-Force vol. 1 #62">''X-Force'' (vol. 1) #62</ref> but all declined.

* '''[[Shinobi Shaw]]''' - Black King
* '''[[Benedict Kine]]''' - White King
* '''Benazir Kaur''' - Suspected to be the Black Queen
* '''Reeva Payge''' - Suspected to be the White Queen
* '''[[Candra (comics)|Candra]]''' - Associate
* '''[[Cordelia Frost]]''' - Probationary member
* '''Ebon Knights''' - Shinobi Shaw's Black Guard
* '''Ivory Knights''' - Benedict Kine's White Guard

The titles of Payge and Kaur are not established. When Cordelia Frost (younger sister of Emma) applies for membership to the Inner Circle, Shinobi states that the title of White Queen is already taken.<ref>''Generation X'' Annual '95</ref>

Shinobi Shaw's actions as Black King were limited to failed attempts at extending his influence and monitoring the London branch of the Club.

====The London Branch====
The Hellfire Club's London branch is introduced briefly operating parallel to Shinobi's Inner Circle.<ref name="Excalibur vol. 1 #96">''Excalibur'' (vol. 1) #96</ref>  Instead of Black and White, the titles of the London Inner Circle are designated Black and Red.

* '''[[Emma Steed]]''' - Black Queen<ref name=london>''Marvel Atlas'' #1</ref>
* '''[[Margali Szardos]]''' - Red Queen
* '''Quentin Templeton''' - Black King<ref name=london/>
* '''Alan Wilson''' - Red King<ref name=london/>
* '''[[Captain Britain|Brian Braddock (Captain Britain)]]''' - Black Bishop
* '''Conrad Strathdee''' - Red Bishop<ref name=london/>
* '''[[Scribe (comics)|Jane Hampshire]] (possessed by [[Mountjoy (comics)|Mountjoy]])''' - Red Rook<ref name=london/>
* '''Rutledge''' - Servant

Captain Britain, having inherited club membership from his father, Sir James Braddock, was asked by Shinobi Shaw to infiltrate the London Inner Circle, as the branch's mysterious agenda surely ran counter to both their interests.<ref name="Excalibur vol. 1 #96"/> The London Branch and their plans were soon brought to an end after a failed attempt to use a demon's essence to control the city.<ref>''Excalibur'' (vol. 1) #99-100</ref> The Black Queen and Red King were taken into police custody.

====Shaw's Second Circle====
Sebastian Shaw, despite his apparent death, later re-emerged<ref>''X-Force'' (vol. 1) #48</ref> and retook control of the Hellfire Club in attempt to restore its former power and glory. Selene, freed from her imprisonment by the Upstarts, took under her influence a resurrected [[Madelyne Pryor]] in her quest for revenge.<ref>''X-Man'' #7</ref><ref>''X-Man'' #13</ref><ref>''X-Man'' #16-17</ref> Shaw meanwhile attempted to ally with the [[Age of Apocalypse|AOA]]-exile [[Holocaust (comics)|Holocaust]]. Meeting in New York, Shaw proposes a reformation of the Inner Circle with the following line-up:<ref>''X-Man'' #20-22</ref> At first operating in secret from outside the Hellfire Club (still under Shinobi Shaw's control), Sebastian's group soon reasserted control over the organization.<ref name="X-Man #28">''X-Man'' #28</ref>

* '''[[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]]''' - Black King
* '''[[Selene (comics)|Selene]]''' - Black Queen
* '''[[Trevor Fitzroy]]''' - White Rook
* '''[[Madelyne Pryor]]''' - Black Rook
* '''[[Donald Pierce]]''' - Applicant for White Bishop
* '''[[Sage (comics)|Tessa]]''' - Shaw's personal aide
* '''Ella''' - Selene's personal servant
* '''[[Holocaust (comics)|Holocaust]]''' - Associate
* '''Miss Hoo''' - Associate

Selene's mind control over Madelyne Pryor eventually waned, and the Black Rook's allegiance soon turned to Sebastian Shaw.<ref>''X-Man'' #24-25</ref> Concerned, Selene contacted Fitzroy and Tessa to counteract the changing balance of power.<ref name="X-Man #28"/> Donald Pierce returned to the Hellfire Club as a probationary member,<ref>''Cable'' #47</ref> however his failure in attaining the alien technology of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] resulted in his expulsion from the group.<ref>''Cable'' #50-53</ref> Pryor meanwhile had betrayed and deserted the club. Shaw, presented with a mysterious offer,<ref>''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #72</ref> decided to accept its terms and resign from the Inner Circle, advising Fitzroy to do the same.<ref name="xmen73"/>

====Selene's Hellfire Club====
Selene, finding herself the sole remaining member of the Inner Circle, reformed the club in her own image and allied with the ruler of Hell, [[Blackheart]]. After a confrontation with the [[Fantastic Four]], Blackheart is imprisoned and Selene's captive [[Daimon Hellstrom]] is freed; Hellstorm then became the club's White King to ensure a balance of power and light.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' Annual '99</ref> Selene would later successfully induct [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]] (Roberto da Costa, son of former Black Rook Emmanuel da Costa) into the Inner Circle,<ref>''X-Force'' (vol. 1) #98-100</ref> offering the resurrection of his long-dead girlfriend, Julianna, who died saving his life.<ref>''Marvel Graphic Novel'' #4 ("The New Mutants")</ref>

* '''[[Selene (comics)|Selene]]''' - Black Queen
* '''[[Blackheart]]''' - Black King
* '''[[Daimon Hellstrom]]''' - White King
* '''[[Sunspot (comics)|Roberto da Costa (Sunspot)]]''' - Black Rook

It is unknown what led to the dissolution of this incarnation. The Hellfire Club was found closed and abandoned, covered in blackbriar thorns; Selene herself was trapped inside the mansion, unable to leave.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #452</ref>

====The Fifth Inner Circle====
After the death of Sir Gordon Phillips at the hands of the Brotherhood of Mutants,{{issue|date=November 2012}} Sebastian Shaw positioned himself as the new Lord Imperial and, as such, oversaw the entire Hellfire Club.{{issue|date=November 2012}}

* '''[[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]]''' - Lord Imperial
* '''[[Sunspot (comics)|Roberto da Costa (Sunspot)]]''' - Black King
* '''[[Selene (comics)|Selene]]''' - Black Queen
* '''[[Sat-Yr-9]] (as [[Courtney Ross]])''' - White Queen
* '''[[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]]''' - White Warrior Princess
* '''[[Sage (comics)|Tessa]]''' - Shaw's personal aide and Sunspot's personal adviser.
* '''[[Red Lotus (comics)|Red Lotus]]''' - Associate

Selene, despite remaining imprisoned underneath the Hellfire Club's New York mansion and not actively participating in the Inner Circle, has apparently retained her title of Black Queen.{{issue|date=November 2012}} It was also revealed that Emma Frost, despite having left the club long ago and having since joined the X-Men, still retained her membership and White Queen title.{{issue|date=November 2012}} [[Sat-Yr-9]] confronts Emma Frost and, assuming her title, becomes the newest addition to the Inner Circle, bringing with her bodyguard and self-appointed "White Warrior Princess" [[Madame Hydra|Viper]].{{issue|date=November 2012}}

A confrontation with Donald Pierce leaves Sebastian Shaw gravely injured,{{issue|date=November 2012}} and Sunspot takes over as Lord Imperial, which was Tessa's plan all along.{{issue|date=November 2012}}  Tessa left the Club,{{issue|date=November 2012}} still under Sunspot's rule, and joined [[Excalibur (comics)#New Excalibur (2005)|New Excalibur]] in the wake of [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].{{issue|date=November 2012}} Shaw has since returned as the Black King, seemingly plotting to rebuild his power base.{{issue|date=November 2012}}

====Nova's Inner Circle====
[[File:New Hellfire.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Emma Frost's illusory Inner Circle (left to right): Negasonic Teenage Warhead, Perfection, Cassandra Nova,  and Sebastian Shaw]]

A mysterious new Inner Circle emerged, plotting the betrayal of the X-Men by Emma Frost,<ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' (vol. 3) #12</ref> culminating in an assault on the [[X-Mansion]]. It was later revealed that these were in fact the psychic manipulations of [[Cassandra Nova]], who, in an attempt to free herself from mental imprisonment by the X-Men, had placed a portion of her mind in Frost's. This Inner Circle was in fact Emma Frost's psionic projections - [[Negasonic Teenage Warhead (comics)|Negasonic Teenage Warhead]] being a former student of hers who died in [[Genosha]], and Perfection a manifestation of Emma's younger, evil self - and not aligned with the Hellfire Club.<ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' (vol. 3) #13-18</ref>

====The Sixth Inner Circle====
Sebastian Shaw's Inner Circle eventually reemerged. [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] came into confrontation with a new "Inner Circle", under the false impression (by Sebastian Shaw and  "[[Miss Sinister]]") that they are behind the kidnapping of his son, [[Daken]].<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #215</ref>

====The Seventh Inner Circle====
In the event "Schism", there has apparently been a pro-human coup in the Hellfire Club, all mutant members have been removed, and 12 year old supergenius Kade Kilgore has been named the new Black King.<ref>''X-Men: Schism'' #1</ref> Kilgore then called together a cabal of prepubescent geniuses to secretly rule the Hellfire Club and eradicate mutantkind, then proceeding to poison the other remaining Hellfire Club members, making them the sole leadership.<ref>''X-Men: Schism'' #3</ref><ref>''X-Men: Schism'' #5</ref> Kade Kilgore later recruited mutants to his side to train the newly manifested mutants at the Hellfire Academy.<ref name="Wolverine and the X-Men #20">''Wolverine and the X-Men'' #20</ref> The Hellfire Academy is destroyed by the staff of the Jean Grey School.<ref name="Wolverine and the X-Men #35">''Wolverine and the X-Men'' #35</ref>

==In other media==

===Television===
* Emma Frost, as the White Queen, is a member of Magneto's [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] in the one off animated episode ''[[X-Men: Pryde of the X-Men|Pryde of the X-Men]]'' in 1989. It was planned to be a series, but was cancelled,{{cn|date=November 2014}} with only the pilot being produced. She is seen freeing Magneto from a military convoy at the beginning of the episode and can later be seen fighting against Cyclops on Asteroid M.

* The Hellfire Club and its original Inner Circle appeared in ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]''. It was renamed the "Inner Circle Club" to prevent any controversy regarding the use of the word "Hellfire". They appear first in cameos in the episode "The Phoenix Saga - Part IV". The members of the Inner Circle are [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]], [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Jason Wyngarde]], [[Emma Frost]], [[Donald Pierce]], and [[Harry Leland]]. The Hellfire Club aimed to control [[Jean Grey]] and brainwash her into joining them, but unwittingly unleashed the [[The Dark Phoenix Saga|Dark Phoenix]].

* The animated series ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'' featured the Inner Circle composed of [[Emma Frost]], [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]], [[Harry Leland]], [[Donald Pierce]], [[Selene (comics)|Selene]], and the [[Stepford Cuckoos]]. This Inner Circle appears more closely related to the Ultimate Marvel series, as a group who is obsessed solely with attaining the power of the Phoenix. In the episode "Shades of Grey," Emma Frost telepathically puts the X-Men to sleep so that the Hellfire Club can abduct Jean Grey. In the three-part episode "Foresight," Sebastian Shaw, Harry Leland, Donald Pierce, and Selene prepare a ritual that would extract the Phoenix Force from Jean Grey and place it in the Stepford Cuckoos. Emma Frost warned them against the plan, but her warnings fell on deaf ears. When the Phoenix was released, the ceiling fell on top of Leland and Pierce. Emma Frost used her telepathy to subdue Shaw and Selene.

* The Hellfire Club (once again under the name Inner Circle) were featured in ''[[Marvel Anime|Marvel Anime: X-Men]]''. In the first episode, they were seen trying to manipulate Jean Grey into using the Phoenix Force for their own use until Jean Grey sacrifices herself. This show also includes some Inner Circle mutants named Rat, Marsh, and Neuron (the Inner Circle's White Bishop) who assisted Mastermind in his plans to rule humanity.

===Film===
* Members of the comics' version of the Hellfire Club are depicted via [[Cameo appearance|cameos]] and/or approximations in the films ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'' and ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]''. In the former, Dr. Sebastian Shaw is seen as a TV commentator talking with Hank McCoy, and in the latter, a character resembling Emma Frost is seen being captured by [[Weapon X]] on [[Three-Mile Island]].

* The Hellfire Club appeared in the film ''[[X-Men: First Class]]'' as the main antagonists.<ref>[http://aintitcool.com/node/46217 So Bryan Singer just called regarding Matthew Vaughn's X-MEN: FIRST CLASS... I'm quite excited now.]</ref> This version of the Hellfire Club is led by [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]] ([[Kevin Bacon]]) and [[Emma Frost]] ([[January Jones]]), with [[Azazel (Marvel Comics)|Azazel]] ([[Jason Flemyng]]), [[Riptide (comics)|Riptide]] ([[Álex González (actor)|Álex González]]), and [[Angel Salvadore]] ([[Zoë Kravitz]]) as the main other members. Their main goal is to start [[World War III]] in order to wipe out the human race from Earth, allowing the mutants to rise up and take over it as the survivor race, with Shaw as the leader of the new world order. To this end, they manipulate American and Soviet government officials to instigate the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]].  At the end of the movie, Sebastian Shaw is killed by Magneto while many of its members (Emma Frost, Azazel, Riptide, and Angel) join Magneto and his new group the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]].

===Video games===

Another game they appeared in was ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]''.

Agent that someone is claiming her former title as White Queen. Their foot soldiers consist of Hellfire Elites, Hellfire Gunners, Hellfire Heavies, Hellfire Hunters, Hellfire Officers, and Hellfire Snipers. The Hellfire Club has also received help in their goals from [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]], [[Blob (comics)|Blob]], [[Crimson Dynamo]] (who built the [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] that obey the Hellfire Club's every commands), [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]], and [[Karima Shapandar|Omega Sentinel]].
