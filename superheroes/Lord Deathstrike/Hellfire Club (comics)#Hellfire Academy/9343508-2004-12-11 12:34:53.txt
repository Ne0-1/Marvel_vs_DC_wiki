'''The Hellfire Club''' is a [[New York City]] [[club]] of [[comic book]] [[supervillain]]s in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], and are frequent foes of the [[X-Men]].  Created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne]], their existence was first revealed in ''X-Men'' #129 ([[1979]]).

The Hellfire Club counts among its members many famous and influential members of society, and serves as a cover for a [[conspiracy]] opposed by the [[X-Men]].  In this fictional canon, the secret Inner Circle of the Hellfire Club is a group of mostly-[[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] [[supervillain]]s that has been around for at least two hundred years, as seen in the ''X-Men: Hellfire Club'' [[mini-series]].

The Hellfire Club first came to light in the Marvel Universe when agents of the Hellfire Club kidnapped the X-Men and took over the mind of [[Jean Grey|Phoenix]].  Though they extricated themselves from this situation, the meddling with Phoenix's mind led her to become Dark Phoenix.
