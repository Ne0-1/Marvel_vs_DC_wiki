The '''Hellfire Club''' is a [[club]] of [[comic book]] [[supervillain]]s in the [[Marvel Comics]], and are frequent foes of the [[X-Men]].  It was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne]], and first revealed in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #129 (January, 1980).  The club is based both on the real 18th century [[Hellfire Club]], and the modern-day version that appeared in ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' television series.
==Brief history==
The Hellfire Club counts among its members many famous and influential members of society.  Membership is passed on to descendants, and can be earned through wealth or influence. The club has branches in [[New York City]], [[Paris]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[London]].

Unbeknownst to most members of the club, the organization is ruled by a Council of the Chosen.  This secret group later renamed itself the Inner Circle and assumed the titles of chess pieces.  Originally the Inner Circle was composed of normal humans, but was slowly infiltrated and dominated by super-powered mutants that use the organization to further their [[conspiracy|conspiracies]] opposed by the [[X-Men]].

The Hellfire Club first came to the attention of the X-Men when agents of the Hellfire Club kidnapped several X-Men and took over the mind of [[Jean Grey|Phoenix]].  Though the X-Men unravelled the Hellfire Club's scheme, the meddling with Phoenix's mind led her to become Dark Phoenix.

They were eventually defeated, and Phoenix returned to her Jean Grey persona. [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] inflicted nearly lethal injuries on several of its mercenaries during this time. However, the influencial organization continued its activities even after being thwarted by the X-Men.  Although the hierarchy of the Inner Circle goes through constant upheaval due to the competing egos and political motives of its members, it still continues to exist in the same basic structure today.

==Known members of the Inner Circle==
Constant intrigue and politicking has resulted in many changes to the membership of the Inner Circle. The Inner Circle's key positions and the people known to have held those positions at one time or another are listed below.

*'''Grey King''' (no longer a position): [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]

==Upheaval in the secret hierarchy==
Although the Inner Circle is fairly secretive, there are a number of characters that have access to or are part of the circle despite lacking an official title.  [[Mastermind (comics)|Mastermind]] was a probationary member of the club for a long time and often worked closely with the Inner Circle.  Tessa, later known as the X-Man [[Sage (comics)|Sage]], served as an advisor to Shaw and then Sunspot.  [[Archangel (comics)|Angel]] and [[Iron Man]] are hereditary members of the club, although they have rarely visited, and are not aware of the plans of the Inner Circle.

Magneto briefly took the title of Grey King after Sebastian Shaw was voted out of the Inner Circle. It is unclear why Magneto later neglected this position.  Possibly his agenda did not mesh with the precepts of the group or he may simply not have valued the organization and its influence enough to continue managing it, as he is extremely powerful of his own devices. 

The club since then was subject to an upstart rising instrumented by Shinobi Shaw and Selene.  It appeared that Sebastion Shaw was killed. This uprising was quashed by Sebastian Shaw who hadn't been killed.  He reinstated some of the old Inner Circle until he disbanded it due to his own invested interest in business pursuits. The club still continued loosely partly due to Selene's influence, although it never had the same prestige as the original.

Sebastian Shaw again reformed a variation of the original Inner Circle with a more noble outlook posing as a force for good, which may have been a deception on his part. There was a brief London based Inner Circle which is currently disbanded. Captain Britain (Brian Braddock) held a position for a short term on Shaws advisement to investigate its activities as they had mutual objectives. Tessa/Sage rejoined the Inner Circle to observe this and to assist in Roberto Decosta usurping the position of Lord Imperial which Shaw had recently claimed. 

The Inner Circle is now currently under the leadership of Roberto DeCosta as the Lord Imperial aided by Sage.  The new White Queen Courtney Ross is also active although it is unclear if she will fall in line with the Inner Circle's new position for good under Decosta's influence.  She is aided by her assassin Viper, the Warrior White Princess.  Recent events suggest that as with many members in the past have their own motives and asperations.

Sebastian Shaw, Pierce and Selene are currently inactive due to being one way or other incapacitated or incarcerated. It has yet to be seen if there will be an uprising by the remaining members of the defunct Inner Circle against the newly formed active Inner Circle.

A New Inner Circle appeared at the end of Astonishing X-Men #12, written by Buffy creator Joss Whedon and drawn by artist John Cassady. This group was presented as possible secret cohorts of former White Queen and current X-Man Emma Frost, and consisted of Cassandra Nova, Sebastian Shaw, Negasonic Teenage Warhead (a presumed demised student of Emma's on Genosha), and a cloaked figure. It is unrevealed as to if this is indeed a New Inner Circle, or a psychic illusion courtesy Cassandra Nova.

==Homages==
As mentioned above, the Hellfire Club was based on the version that appears in the ''Avengers'' episode "[[A Touch of Brimstone]]". It is for this reason that the White Queen is named Emma (a reference to [[Emma Peel]], who finds herself more in the Phoenix role of unwilling Queen), and that Mastermind is given the name Jason Wyngarde (the leader of the Club in the ''Avengers'' episode was played by [[Peter Wyngarde]], who also played [[Jason King]]). Other members of the Inner Circle were also modelled on famous actors:

*Sebastian Shaw - [[Robert Shaw]] 
*Harry Leland - [[Orson Welles]] (the first name refers to [[Harry Lime]] in ''[[The Third Man]]''; the surname to Jed Leland in ''[[Citizen Kane]]'')
*Donald Pierce - [[Donald Sutherland]] (the surname refers to [[Hawkeye Pierce]] in ''[[M*A*S*H (movie)|M*A*S*H]]'')

An even more direct reference to ''The Avengers'' occurs when we learn the Black Queen of the British branch is named Emma Steed.
