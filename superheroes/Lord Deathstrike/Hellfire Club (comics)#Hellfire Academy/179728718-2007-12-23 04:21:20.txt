The '''Hellfire Club''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain]] team that frequently battles the [[X-Men]].  Created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist/co-writer [[John Byrne]], the team first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #129 ([[1980#January|January 1980]]).  

Although the club appears to merely be an international social club for wealthy elites, its '''Inner Circle''' consists of [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] who try to influence world events for the accumulation of power. They dress in [[18th century]] garb and rank themselves in a system of [[chess]] pieces (Black Rook, White Queen, etc).  The club is based on the actual [[Hellfire Club]], a [[secret society]] of 18th century [[England]], which inspired the modern-day version appearing in the television series ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]''.

The group first battled the X-Men in the classic "[[Dark Phoenix Saga]]" and the club, or branches of it, have since appeared periodically in various X-Men series. 

==Brief history==
The Hellfire Club counts among its members many famous and influential members of society. Membership is passed on to descendants, and can be earned through wealth or influence. The club has branches in [[New York City]], [[Paris]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[London]]. The various branches are overseen by the Lord Imperial.

Many of the wealthiest and most powerful businessmen of the [[Marvel Universe]], including [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] and [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] have inherited or gained membership to the Hellfire Club. And while many accept the invitation merely for the pleasures that the Club offers, many others seek out to obtain wealth and influence. In fact, the purpose of the Hellfire Club is to obtain and exert power through politics and economic influence instead of outward conquest and domination. Since its foundation, Hellfire Club has been involved in wars and assassinations as long as these helped further the agendas of the Club's most prominent members.

Unbeknownst to most members of the club, the organization is ruled by a Council of the Chosen. This secret group later renamed itself the Inner Circle and assumed the titles of chess pieces. Originally the Inner Circle was composed of normal humans, but was slowly infiltrated and dominated by super-powered mutants of various abilities. Though the Inner Circle is not always the most powerful of mutantkind, it allows within its rank only those of exceptional ability. A common theme, though with exceptions, is for the White and Black queens of the organization to possess a psychic ability of some nature; no doubt aiding the organization to further their [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracies]].

The Hellfire Club first came to the attention of the X-Men when agents of the Hellfire Club kidnapped several X-Men and took over the mind of [[Jean Grey|Phoenix]]. Though the X-Men unraveled the Hellfire Club's scheme, the meddling with Phoenix's mind led her to become Dark Phoenix.

They were eventually defeated and Phoenix returned to her Jean Grey persona. [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] inflicted nearly lethal injuries on several of its mercenaries during this time. However, the influential organization continued its activities even after being thwarted by the X-Men.  Although the hierarchy of the Inner Circle goes through constant upheaval due to the competing egos and political motives of its members, it continues to exist in the same basic structure today.

==Inner Circle Lineups==
The constant intrigue, backstabbing, blackmailing and politicking that plague the Hellfire Club have resulted in many changes of the Inner Circle, as new players seek out membership in order to obtain influence, power and wealth. The following lists the membership of each incarnation of the inner circle and the title they held. Up until his death, '''Sir Gordon Phillips''' bore the title of '''Lord Imperial''', and as such he oversaw all branches of the Hellfire Club; he was not a member of any particular Inner Circle, he was above all of them.

===Council of the Chosen===
The original Inner Circle prior to Shaw and Frost's takeover of the New York Branch Hellfire Club consisted of:
* '''[[Edward Buckman|Edward "Ned" Buckman]]:''' White King
* '''Paris Seville:''' White Queen
* '''Sebastian Shaw:''' Black Bishop

The rest of the membership is never named. Like Paris, they are gunned down by Buckman under Emma Frost's mind control. Ned Buckman was responsible for a Sentinel attack on Shaw's beach house, which resulted on the death of Shaw's lover, [[Lourdes Chantel]].

===The Lords Cardinal===

Shaw renamed the Council of the Chosen as The Lords Cardinal following his takeover of the NY Branch.

* '''[[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]]:''' Black King
* '''[[Emma Frost]]''': White Queen
* '''[[Donald Pierce]]''': White King (sometimes retconned to White Bishop)
* '''[[Phoenix (comics)|Phoenix]] (posing as [[Jean Grey]]):''' Black Queen
* '''[[Harry Leland]]:''' Black Bishop
* '''[[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Jason Wyngarde]]:''' Probationary member - presumably intended for one of the two Rooks.
* '''[[Sage (comics)|Tessa]]:''' Shaw's personal aide.

* '''[[Warhawk (Marvel Comics)|Warhawk]]:''' Associate

Following the [[Dark Phoenix Saga]], the title of Black Queen is empty once again. Donald Pierce reaches the rank of White King and is expelled. New members are:

* '''[[Selene (comics)|Selene]]:''' Black Queen
* '''Emmanuel da Costa:''' White Rook
* '''[[Friedrich Von Roehm]]:''' Black Rook
* '''[[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]:''' White King, alongside Storm. Later Grey King
* '''[[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]]:''' White Queen, alongside Magneto.

===Shinobi Shaw's Inner Circle===
Originally, Selene planned on creating a new Inner Circle from amongst the [[Upstarts (comics)|Upstarts]], yet they turn on her. Believing his father to be dead, [[Shinobi Shaw]] briefly takes over the NY Branch of the Club, seemingly with support from the External Candra. He offers membership in his Inner Circle to both [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]] and later to Storm but they decline. 

* '''[[Shinobi Shaw]]:''' Black King
* '''[[Benedict Kine]]:''' White King
* '''[[Benazir Kaur]]:''' Suspected to be the Black Queen
* '''[[Reeva Payge]]:''' Suspected to be the White Queen

* '''[[Candra (comics)|Candra]]:''' Associate
* '''[[Cordelia Frost]]:''' Probationary member

The titles of Payge and Kaur are not established. When Cordelia Frost applies for membership to the Inner Circle, Shinobi states that the title of White Queen is already taken.

This Inner Circle quickly fades into oblivion and is replaced by Shaw's second Inner Circle.

===The London Branch===
The Inner Circle of the Club's London branch briefly operates in parallel to Shinobi's Inner Circle. Instead of Black and White, the titles of the London Branch can be Red and Black.

* '''[[Ms. Steed]] ([[Age of Apocalypse|AoA's]] Damask):''' Black Queen (Emma Steed)<ref>''Marvel Atlas'' #1</ref>
* '''[[Margali Szardos]]:''' Red Queen
* '''[[Scribe (comics)|Scribe]] (possessed by [[Mountjoy (comics)|Mountjoy]]):''' Red Rook (Jane Hampshire)<ref>''Marvel Atlas #1</ref>
* '''Black King''' (Quentin Templeton)<ref>''Marvel Atlas #1</ref>
* '''Red King''' (Alan Wilson)<ref>''Marvel Atlas #1</ref>
* '''[[Captain Britain|Brian Braddock]]:''' Black Bishop
* '''Red Bishop''' (Conrad Strathdee)<ref>''Marvel Atlas #1</ref>

Brian Braddock's membership is hereditary. He joined the London Inner Circle at Shinobi Shaw's behest, as Shaw wanted information on the London branch's activities.

Eventually the London Branch is neutralized after a failed attempt to use a demon's essence to control the city.

===Shaw's Second Stint===
Sebastian Shaw retakes control of the Hellfire Club and tries to rebuild the Inner Circle to its former power and glory.

* '''[[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]]:''' Black King
* '''[[Selene (comics)|Selene]]:''' Black Queen
* '''[[Madelyne Pryor]] or Queen Jean:''' Black Rook
* '''[[Trevor Fitzroy]]:''' White Rook
* '''[[Donald Pierce]]:''' Applicant for White Bishop
* '''[[Sage (comics)|Tessa]]:''' Shaw's personal aide.
* '''[[Ella (comics)|Ella]]:''' Selene's personal servant

* '''[[Holocaust (comics)|Holocaust]]:''' Associate
* '''[[Miss Hoo]]:''' Associate

===Selene's Hellfire===
With Pierce expelled, Madelyne gone and both Shaw and Fitzroy retired, Selene reforms the Inner Circle into a reflection of her own evil nature, thus consorting with demons, though her reign is short-lived:

* '''[[Selene (comics)|Selene]]:''' Black Queen
* '''[[Blackheart]]:''' Black King
* '''[[Daimon Hellstrom]]:''' White King
* '''[[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]]:''' Black Rook

At the time, [[Adrienne Frost]] shows up in [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]], claiming the White Queen title for herself. However, she was merely using the White Queen moniker. Besides, the nature of her powers did not fit with Selene's new ''demons, fire and brimstone'' theme.

Following Selene's defeat, Hellstrom remains as White King. Though he hasn't appeared again as a member, there has been no White King since him.

Sunspot joined the Inner Circle after Selene and Blackheart's defeat. She  had always shown an interest in the young da Costa and blackmails him into taking up his hereditary membership.

In [[Grant Morrison]]'s [[New X-Men]], it is revealed that Shaw is back in power, though the NY Branch has apparently been turned into a strip club. ''Deadly Genesis'' reveals that the strip club was part of the Hellfire Club's properties at least since the days of Emma Frost's youth.

===The Fifth Inner Circle===
With Sir Gordon Phillips dead thanks to the Legacy Virus, Shaw positions himself as the new Lord Imperial and, as such, he oversees the entire Hellfire Club. While he claims that he's trying to reform the Club, his motive, as always, is not what it seems.

* '''Sebastian Shaw:''' Lord Imperial
* '''[[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]]:''' Black King, later Lord Imperial.
* '''Courtney Ross (actually [[Sat-Yr-9]]):''' White Queen
* '''[[Madame Hydra|Viper]]:''' Warrior White Princess
* '''Tessa/Sage:''' Shaw's personal aide, Sunspot's personal advisor
* '''Selene:''' Black Queen

* '''[[Red Lotus (comics)|Red Lotus]]:''' Associate

During a confrontation between Sat-Yr-9 and Emma Frost, it is revealed that the latter maintained her membership all the time, as well as the White Queen title, though she loses the second.

Selene remains trapped beneath the Hellfire Club's HQ and is not actually part of the New Inner Circle, though her title of Black Queen remains untaken. How she managed to present herself before Sunspot remains unexplained and it's possibly an error by the writers.

A confrontation with Donald Pierce leaves Shaw gravely injured. Sunspot takes over as Lord Imperial, which was Sage's plan all along. Despite their good intentions, Sat-yr-9 and Viper have their own less than noble agenda.

On the wake of [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], Sage left the Club, still under Sunspot's rule, and joined [[Excalibur (comics)#New Excalibur (2005)|New Excalibur]]. Shaw is once again the Black King and seemingly plotting to rebuild his power base.

===The Imaginary Inner Circle===
[[Image:New Hellfire.jpg|200px|right|thumb|The imaginary Inner Circle, sans Emma Frost: Perfection, Cassandra Nova, Negasonic Teenage Warhead and Sebastian Shaw]]

It was revealed that this Inner Circle was in fact not real.  All were mental images created by Emma Frost's psyche due to "programming" placed there by Cassandra Nova in an attempt to free her.

* '''[[Emma Frost#A New Hellfire Club|Perfection]]/The White Queen'''
* '''[[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]]'''
* '''[[Cassandra Nova]]'''
* '''[[Negasonic Teenage Warhead (comics)|Negasonic Teenage Warhead]]'''
* '''[[Emma Frost]]'''

===Lords Imperial===

The '''Lord Imperial''' is not a member of the Inner Circle of any particular branch of Hellfire Club; instead, a few individuals have held the title. The Lord Imperial is the true leader of the Hellfire Club and oversees all branches of it.

* '''[[Gordon Phillips|Sir Gordon Phillips]]'''
* '''[[Elias Bogan]]'''
* '''Sebastian Shaw'''
* '''Sunspot'''

===Members outside the Inner Circle===

The following characters are members of the Hellfire Club, many of them being extremely influential, but were not part of the any of the Inner Circle incarnations mentioned above. Their membership was inherited from their ancestors or parents, or was obtained through from personal invitation from the Branch's King, such as the one Sebastian Shaw offered to [[Irene Merryweather]], which she refused.

* '''[[Lourdes Chantel]]''' - affiliated thanks to Shaw's membership
* '''[[Warren Worthington III]]''' - inherited membership from his father
* '''[[Warren Worthington Jr.]]''' - invited by Ned Buckman
* '''[[Howard Stark]]''' - invited by Ned Buckman
* '''[[Iron Man|Anthony Stark]]''' - inherited membership from his father
* '''[[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]]'''
* '''[[James Braddock (comics)|Sir James Braddock]]''' - invited by Ned Buckman, former Black Bishop of the London Branch, left the Inner Circle when his inventions where used for anti-mutant purposes.
* '''[[Jamie Braddock|James Braddock Jr.]]'''  - inherited membership.
* '''[[Psylocke|Elisabeth Braddock]]''' - inherited membership.
* '''[[Bianca LeNeige]]'''
* '''[[Night Thrasher|Dwayne Taylor]]'''
* '''[[Vance Astrovik]]'''
* '''[[Candace Southern]]''', Warren Worthington III's former girlfriend - now deceased

==Upheaval in the secret hierarchy==
Although the Inner Circle is fairly secretive, there are a number of characters that have access to or are part of the circle despite lacking an official title.  [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]] was a probationary member of the club for a long time and often worked closely with the Inner Circle.  Tessa, later known as the X-Man [[Sage (comics)|Sage]], served as an advisor to Shaw and then Sunspot.  [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] and [[Iron Man]] are hereditary members of the club, although they have rarely visited, and are not aware of the plans of the Inner Circle.

Magneto briefly took the title of Grey King after Sebastian Shaw was voted out of the Inner Circle. It is unclear why Magneto later neglected this position.  Possibly his agenda did not mesh with the precepts of the group or he may simply not have valued the organization and its influence enough to continue managing it, as he is vastly powerful and resourceful in his own right. 

The club since then was subject to an upstart rising instrumented by Shinobi Shaw and Selene.  It appeared that Sebastian Shaw was killed. The new group, named the Upstarts, held a competition to see who could kill the most mutants. Points for each kill were awarded by the Gamesmaster and the group quickly turned against Selene as well. 

During this time the Inner Circle of the London branch was working behind the American branch's back and was influencing [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] and the secret government agency ''Black Air''. Captain Britain (Brian Braddock) held a position for a short term on Shinobi Shaw's advisement to investigate its activities as they had mutual objectives. [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] collected evidence of their crimes and the Inner Circle was either arrested or went into hiding. 

The Upstart's uprising was quashed by Sebastian Shaw. He reinstated some of the old Inner Circle until he disbanded it due to his own invested interest in business pursuits. The Club still continued loosely partly due to Selene's influence, although it never had the same prestige as the original.

During [[Grant Morrison]]'s [[New X-Men]] run, the New York premises of the Hellfire Club were turned into a high-class strip club and a neutral place in which everyone was welcome, even Sabretooth.

Sebastian Shaw again reformed a variation of the original Inner Circle with a nobler outlook posing as a force for good, which may have been a deception on his part. Tessa/Sage rejoined the Inner Circle to observe this and to assist Roberto da Costa's usurping the position of Lord Imperial which Shaw had recently claimed. 

The Hellfire Club is now currently under the leadership of Roberto da Costa as the Lord Imperial aided by Sage. Sat-Yr-9 (under the guise of Courtney Ross) is the new White Queen although it is unclear if she will fall in line with the Inner Circle's new position for good under da Costa's influence. She is aided by her assassin Viper, her "Warrior White Princess". As with many members in the past, both Sat-Yr-9 and Viper have their own personal agendas.

Following [[House of M]] and [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]], Sunspot's Inner Circle hasn't made an appearance, though Tessa is now a member of New Excalibur.

==Inspiration==
As mentioned above, the Hellfire Club was based on the version that appears in the ''Avengers'' episode "[[list of The Avengers episodes#Series 4 (1965-1966)|A Touch of Brimstone]]". It is for this reason that the White Queen is named Emma (a reference to [[Emma Peel]], who finds herself more in the Phoenix role of unwilling Queen), and that Mastermind is given the name Jason Wyngarde (the leader of the Club in the ''Avengers'' episode was played by [[Peter Wyngarde]], who also played ''[[Jason King (TV series)|Jason King]]''). Other members of the Inner Circle were also modeled on famous actors:

*Sebastian Shaw - [[Robert Shaw (actor)|Robert Shaw]] 
*Harry Leland - [[Orson Welles]] (the first name refers to Harry Lime in ''[[The Third Man]]''; the surname to Jed Leland in ''[[Citizen Kane]]'')
*Donald Pierce - [[Donald Sutherland]] (the surname refers to [[Hawkeye Pierce]] in ''[[MASH (film)|M*A*S*H]]'')

When Jean Grey becomes the Black Queen, her outfit is similar to that worn by Emma Peel in ''The Avengers'' episode [http://theavengers.tv/forever/peel1-21.htm].

An even more direct reference to ''The Avengers'' is the name of the Black Queen of the British branch - Ms. Steed. Similarly, Sir Patrick and Lady Diana, from the 1780s Philadelphia branch, are named after [[Patrick Macnee]] and [[Diana Rigg]].

==Alternate Hellfires==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the [[Age of Apocalypse]] the Hellfire Club is not active and was possibly decimated by the forces of Apocalypse. On its place can be found the nightclub known as Heaven, a music filled neutral zone from the genetic conflict that boils outside penthouse run by the Angel. 

Sebastian Shaw is part of Apocalypse's court and one of the Dark Lord's informants. Emma Frost is part of the Human High Council, having been stripped of her powers through a lobotomy. Jason Wyngarde was a victim of the [[Sugar Man]] and then became one of [[Forge (comics)|Forge's]] Outcasts. Donald Pierce  also became a servant of Apocalypse and the leader of the techno-organic infected Reavers.

===Days of Future Past===
In the [[Days of Future Past]] timeline, Shinobi Shaw and [[Psylocke]] took over the Hellfire Club London Branch and became the Black King and the Red Queen.

===Bishop's Future===
In [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop's]] future, the Hellfire Club remains as one of the major powers on the world. It is ruled by Anthony Shaw, a descendant of Shinobi Shaw. [[Trevor Fitzroy]] is Anthony Shaw's illegitimate son, which makes him a descendant of the Shaw family. Malcolm, a member of the Xavier Security Enforcers (X.S.E.) was also a member of the Club.

===Chronomancer Timeline===
In a future dominated by Fitzroy, who now calls himself The Chronomancer, one of the forces opposing his rule is Clan Hellfire, led by Samara Shaw.

===Ronin===
In the alternate reality of ''X-Men:Ronin'', the X-Men are based in Japan. There, the Hellfire Club is ruled by [[Professor X]]avier. The White Queen is a junior member who, alongside with Tessa, believe Xavier to be their biological father. The Club controls the Shadowcat clan of ninjas, which includes [[Pyro (comics)|Pyro]], [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] and [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]].

===Ultimate Hellfire===<!-- This section is linked from [[Phoenix (comics)]] -->
The Hellfire Club of the [[Ultimate Marvel]] Universe, led by Sebastian Shaw, is an inner circle of very rich businessmen who believe in a pagan "[[Phoenix (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Phoenix God]]". They believed it was reborn in the body of X-Man [[Jean Grey]] and secretly funded Charles Xavier to nurture her until the right time came. 
However, Jean apparently went mad, stole their bank access codes, and wiped their minds. She was subsequently rehabilitated by Professor Xavier. If the Hellfire Club continues, it does so without its Inner Circle.

In recent issues of ''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'', a group called the [[Shi'ar#Ultimate Shi'ar|Church of Shi'ar Enlightenment]] has approached the Xavier Institute, claiming that the Hellfire Club was a breakaway sect, and asking to examine whether or not Jean really is the Phoenix God.

However, Lilandra's assistant Gerald Lavine was revealed to be an operative of the Hellfire Club and working for Shinobi Shaw, who is also dating Emma Frost, headmistress of the [[New Mutants|Academy of Tomorrow]].

==In other media==
===Television===
The Hellfire Club appeared on the [[Dark Phoenix Saga]] storyline on the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men Animated Series]]'', though it was renamed ''Inner Circle Club'', to prevent controversy regarding the use of the word Hellfire, which could have prompted accusation of Satanism. The episodes show the original members of the Inner Circle: Sebastian Shaw, Jason Wyngarde, Emma Frost, Donald Pierce and Harry Leland. The Inner Circle's leaders aim to control [[Jean Grey]] and brainwash her into believing she is the Queen of the Inner Circle, though they only manage to unleash [[Dark Phoenix Saga|Dark Phoenix]].
