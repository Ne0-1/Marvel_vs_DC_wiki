'''Hulk 2099''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[fictional character]] created by [[Gerard Jones]] and [[Dwayne Turner]].  Hulk 2099 first appeared in ''2099 Unlimited #1.''  Similar to many other [[Marvel 2099]] characters, the Hulk 2099 was a futuristic re-imagining of a popular [[Hulk (comics)|Marvel character]]. 

==Publication History==

Hulk 2099's first regular appearrances were in ''2099 Unlimited (issues 1-6)''.  The character would later get his own series, ''Hulk 2099'' which ran for 10 issues.  As 2099 series began to decline, so would the Hulk's appearances, meeting his demise it the fictional universe ''2099 A.D. Apocalypse''.  The Hulk 2099 along with  rest of the 2099 universe would be resurrected in the pages of ''Exiles''.

==Fictional character biography==
John Eisenhart was a studio executive for Lotusland Productions, researching the Knights of Banner, migrant worshippers of the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]].  The Knights of Banner had been experimenting with [[gamma ray]]s, hoping to create a new Hulk.  After the Knights refused to sell their story to him, Eisenhart reported them to the police.  As the police arrived, a battle ensued leading to the capturing and slaughter of many knights.  Eisenhart, wracked with guilt, joined the Knights in their fight. A young knight the studio exec had befriended named Gawain tried to end the violence by killing everyone by setting off the gamma devices, only to have his new ally caught in the blast.  The blast transformed Eisenhart into a new Hulk, who quickly ended the battle.  Upon returning to Lotusland, the studio executive was assigned to investigate a new desert creature (himself).

During his investigation, Eisenhart/Hulk would meet a singer/songwriter named Quirk. She would join Eisenhart/Hulk in his search for Gawain, who had been captured during the initial battle. The search would last for the duration of the Hulk's 2099 Unlimited appearances, with the young knight being rescued.

Gawain's salavation would be short-lived, as the he would die at the hands of the villain Draco at the start of the ''Hulk 2099'' series, fueling Eisenhart/Hulk with guilt and remorse throughout the rest of the series over his broken vow to protect the young knight.  In addition to Draco, the Hulk would face other villains throughout the series (Golden One, Cybershaman, Dr. Apollo, Anti-Hulk).  The Hulk would meet his demise at the barrels of guns of the post-[[Doom 2099|Doom]] [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], dying after being shot by an unspecified energy in ''2099 A.D. Apocalypse''.

==Other versions==
===Exiles===
{{main|Exiles (Marvel Comics)}}

The Exiles later visited an alternate version of the Marvel 2099 universe.  After being resurrected and escaping the [[House of M]], [[Proteus (comics)|Proteus]] took over the body of this version of Hulk 2099, looking for a suitable host body that wouldn't expire quickly due to his vast energy.  Although physically powerful, the Hulk's body was not enough to sustain Proteus, who would transferred himself into the body of [[Morph (comics)|Morph]] in the [[Hulk (comics)#Other versions of Hulk|Future Imperfect universe]].

==Powers and abilities==
The Hulk 2099, like his namesake, was one of the strongest characters in his fictional universe; and like the original, the strength of the character would increase with his emotional state. In addition, Hulk 2099 had a high level of speed, invulnerability, and stamina.  Unlike his predecesor this Hulk had razor sharp claws and fangs.

The most distinctive contrast of Hulk 2099 to his Earth 616 counterpart was his psyche.  Initially, when turned into the Hulk, Eisenhart retained his intellect and personality (although significantly more aggressive, due possibly to his current emotional state).  Eisenhart was even able to control his transformations.  However, as the series progressed, Eisenhart and the Hulk became two distinct and separate personalities, Eisenhart more ruthless, while the Hulk heroic.  As the mental separation became more distant, transformation would only occur during moments of rage.
