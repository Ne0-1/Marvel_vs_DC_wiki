In [[Marvel Comics]], Ereshkigal is the name of two characters.

==Goddess==
'''Ereshkigel''', a Babylonian goddess, first appeared in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' Annual #10, in 1981. She was part of a group of Death gods trying to increase their power, but she was absorbed along with the others by [[Atum (comics)|Demogorge]], the God-Eater. Ereshkigal and the other gods were freed by Thor, and have not made any similar attempts. She was portrayed as a pale-skinned woman with batlike wings. She is the fictional counterpart to the Mesopotamian goddess [[Ereshkigal]].

==Deviant==
The second Ereshkigal is a member of the [[Marvel Universe]]'s [[Deviant (comics)|Deviant]] race, first appearing in ''Thor'' #284. She is a [[shapeshifter]], able to take human form, or a winged form that resembles Marvel's version of the Goddess that she is named for. She claims to be millennia old, and like many Deviants has greater strength, stamina and durability than a human. She seems to have impersonated the Goddess Ereshkigel throughout history. Her sister Dragona[http://www.marvunapp.comAppendix/dragna.htm] is a member of the [[Delta Network]] of [[Warlord Kro]].

Ereshkigel was assigned by to investigate the City of the Space Gods, home of the [[Celestials (comics)|Celestials]], by Brother Tode, leader of the Deviants. She assumed a human appearance and boarded an airplane headed for the [[Andes mountains]]. The plane was captured by the Celestials, and brought into their hidden city for examination. However, another passenger on that plane was Don Blake, the secret identity of the Mighty Thor, as well as [[Ajak]] of the [[Eternals]]. Thor was able to easily overcome Ereshkigal. Thor turned her over to the custody of Ajak.

Appearing again in ''[[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]]'' #30, she again took a human identity as H. D. Steckley (an alias formerly used by [[Moondragon]]), and schemed to get Quasar's power-bands. When she discovered the existence of an even more powerful artifact, the [[Star Brand]], she attempted to acquire its might. Toward this end, she befriended Quasar's secretary Kayla Ballantine, who possessed the Brand, even becoming her roommate. When Kayla was recruited by an alien world to defend them from the [http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/starblst.htm Starblasters], "HD" went with her, and observed firsthand the power of the Star Brand, as Kayla easily destroyed a fleet of warships. They then returned to Earth.

The power of the Star Brand attracted the attention of [[Kismet (Marvel Comics)|Kismet]], whom Kayla fought and seriously injured. Kayla, distraught, wished she didn't have the power anymore, and "HD" offered to take it. After the power was transferred, she then revealed her true self to a dismayed Kayla.

Ereshkigel flew to the pandimensional portal called the Nexus of Realities, easily defeating its guardian, the [[Man-Thing]]. She summoned the pantheon of powerful beings known as the Congress of Realities, and offered to overthrow the current guardians of the [[Multiverse]] and give free reign to the Congress. A few chose to follow her, and she destroyed the rest with her near-infinite power.

The cosmic guardian known as the [[Living Tribunal]] challenged Ereshkigel to a contest of champions, winner take all. Quasar and the [[Silver Surfer]] were chosen as champions; both were told the stakes involved, but not which side they represented. However, by observing the effects of their fight on the cosmic beings known as [[Master Order]] and [[Lord Chaos]], Quasar was able to determine that he represented the side of Chaos, and allowed himself to lose. Defeated, Ereshkigal committed [[suicide]], and the Living Tribunal took possession of the Star Brand.
