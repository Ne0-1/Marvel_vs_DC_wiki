The '''Marauders''' are a group of mutant [[supervillain]]s in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]] and enemies of the [[X-Men]]. They were created by [[Chris Claremont]] and made their debut in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #210 (Oct 1986).

== Origins ==
The Marauders are a mercenary group that serve as the personal strikeforce of [[Mister Sinister]], and are best known for their involvement in the [[Mutant Massacre]], in which they slaughtered the mutant community known as the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]]. Most of the members of the team were assembled by [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] at Sinister's behest. However, Scalphunter was already serving Sinister since World War II and he personally recruited Sabretooth, while he was roaming in Vietnam.

== Lineup ==
*'''[[Arclight (comics)|Arclight]]''' (Philippa Sontag), a super-strong mutant who is always spoiling for a fight; her mutation allows her to release shockwaves (like  [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]] and [[Rictor (comics)|Rictor]], but only on physical contact) by amplifying the impact of her blows. She served with the American ground forces in the [[Vietnam War]], and is still haunted by memories of that place.  She has a romantic interest in Scalphunter.
*'''[[Blockbuster (Marauder)|Blockbuster]]''' (Michael Baer), a superhumanly strong mutant who has stood up to punches from [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], though a single hammer blow from an enraged Thor killed him.  He did some work with German terrorists before hooking up with Sinister.
*'''[[Harpoon (comics)|Harpoon]]''' (Kodiak Noatak), a young [[Inuit]] who can charge objects (usually his ''Slayspears'' - 20 pound (9 kg) barbed harpoons) with electrical, concussive force, or stunning energies.
*'''[[Malice (comics)|Malice]]''', one of Sinister’s top lieutenants whose sadistic orders are followed without hesitation or question. She exists as an incorporeal psychic being who possesses others, though she often 'hides' in the person's subconscious and reveals herself in a [[mirror]] or as the dark side of the target’s consciousness.  For much of her public activity with the other Marauders, she used the X-Man [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]] as a host.  Malice was apparently killed by Sinister for disobeying orders in ''X-Factor'' #105 and hasn't been seen since.
*'''[[Prism (comics)|Prism]]''', an overconfident and cold-blooded killer who often underestimates the fragility of his [[crystal]]line body (which can deflect/reflect most forms of energy attacks, but not physical impact). 
*'''[[Riptide (comics)|Riptide]]''' (Janos Questad), a brutally evil man who can spin his body at superhuman speeds and fling out [[shuriken]]s (made from a resin his skin secretes) for amazing amounts of damage. He was the first of the Marauders to "die", when his neck was broken by [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]].
*'''[[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]]''' (Victor Creed), the longtime enemy of [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]].
*'''[[Scalphunter (comics)|Scalphunter]]''' (John Greycrow), a ruthless ex-G.I., and the group’s tactician.  His orders are overruled only by Malice or Sinister.  Scalphunter is the most cold-blooded of the group. He is capable of "technomorphing" (altering the configuration of any technological device), a power he uses to create a number of weapons from his battle armor. He also has incredible regenerative powers -- he survived being executed by his fellow American soldiers in [[1944]] after having murdered and scalped eight fellow officers.
*'''[[Scrambler (comics)|Scrambler]]''' (Kim Il Sung), the youngest Marauder, can disrupt electrical, mechanical, physiological, and genetic ([[mutant (fictional)|Mutant]] abilities) systems with a touch.  This [[Korean people|Korean]] is a psychopath more concerned with looking stylish than with the suffering he inflicts on others.
*'''[[Vertigo (Marvel Comics)|Vertigo]]''', who can psionically induce a sensation of vertigo in others; she was originally a member of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]'s [[Savage Land Mutates]].
*'''[[Hans (comics)|Hans]]''', a creation of Sinister while he was infiltrated at the [[Weapon X]] Program, at a time in which only Scalphunter remained loyal to Sinister. Even though he possessed a wide array of powers, he was nonetheless killed by Sabretooth. Hans was the first of Sinister's creations dubbed The Children.

Although several Marauders died during the "Morlock Massacre", they reappeared during the [[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|''Inferno'']] [[fictional crossover|crossover]]; it was later revealed that Mister Sinister has created numerous [[clone (genetics)|clones]] of all of the Marauders save for Sabretooth, whose regenerative abilities made cloning difficult, and Malice, who was a purely psychic entity and therefore had no genetic material. ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #350 revealed that [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] had organized the group, although he was never actually a member. The Marauders' loyalty to Sinister is ensured through gene imprints they all possess that would kill them should they turn on the geneticist. Sabretooth is the only Marauder who was never cloned.

As of [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], the event where the [[Scarlet Witch]] depowered over 90% of the worldwide mutant population, only Arclight, Scalphunter, and Prism were seen to still have their powers. Arclight and Scalphunter have become two of the 198 who are camped at the [[X-Mansion]], while Prism is in a maximum security [[prison]] (as seen in the limited series ''Generation M'').

== Original Marauders ==

The modern day Marauders who were responsible for the Mutant Massacre were not the first group of henchmen Sinister that had this name. While Sinister was still Nathaniel Essex, the Marauders were a band of criminals hired by Essex to kidnap homeless people to be experimented on. Many of them were altered by [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] into cyborgs after they accidentally awakened. One of the Marauders, Oscar Stamp, repented from his crimes and became the adoptive father of a boy named Daniel, one of Essex's victims. Together they travelled to the United States and took on the surname Summers in honor of the time-travelling [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], who was actually Daniel's descendant.

== Alternate versions ==

In the [[Age of Apocalypse]], the Marauders were a band of human terrorists serving Apocalypse. As they lacked powers of their own, they employed gliding discs and energy gauntlets to wreak havoc among the human settlements of Wakanda, until they were killed by [[Gwen Stacy]] and [[Hawkeye (comics)|Clint Barton]]. The Marauders were Dirigible ([[Wilson Fisk]]), Red ([[Norman Osborn]]), [[Arcade (comics)|Arcade]] and [[Owl (comics)|the Owl]].

== In other media ==
Some of the Marauders appeared in the ''[[X-Men Animated Series]]'', though the Nasty Boys were Sinister's enforcers in the show. Both Blockbuster and Arclight made numerous cameo appereances as random placeholders, while [[Vertigo (Marvel Comics)|Vertigo]], shown first with the Savage Land Mutates, like the comics version, later became the sole female member of the Nasty Boys.
