The '''Marauders''' are a group of mutant [[supervillain]]s in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]] and enemies of the [[X-Men]]. They were created by [[Chris Claremont]] and made their debut in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #210 (Oct 1986).

==Origins==
The Marauders are a mercenary group that serve as the personal strike force of [[Mister Sinister]], and are best known for their involvement in the [[Mutant Massacre]], in which they slaughtered the mutant community known as the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]]. Most of the team was assembled by [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] at Sinister's behest. However, Scalphunter was already serving Sinister since World War II and he personally recruited [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] while he was roaming in Vietnam.

==Lineup==
*'''[[Arclight (comics)|Arclight]]''' (Philippa Sontag), a super-strong mutant who is always spoiling for a fight; her mutation allows her to release shockwaves (like  [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]] and [[Rictor]]) most often to amplify the impact of her blows. She served with the American ground forces in the [[Vietnam War]], and is still haunted by memories of that place. She has a romantic interest in Scalphunter.
*'''[[Blockbuster (Marauder)|Blockbuster]]''' (Michael Baer), a superhumanly strong mutant who has stood up to punches from [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], though a single hammer blow from an enraged Thor killed him. He did some work with German terrorists before hooking up with Sinister.
*'''[[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]]''' (Remy LeBeau) Before joining the X-Men, Gambit was hired by Sinister to assemble the Marauders. Feeling responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Morlocks, Gambit kept this a secret from the X-Men until [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] absorbed his memories and found out Gambit's secret. His brainwashing by Apocalypse and manipulation by Sinister has led him to abandon the X-Men.
*'''Hans''', a creation of Sinister while he was infiltrated at the [[Weapon X]] Program, at a time in which only Scalphunter remained loyal to Sinister. Even though he possessed a wide array of powers, he was nonetheless killed by Sabretooth. Hans was the first of Sinister's creations dubbed The Children. He has no relation to the [[Children of the Vault]].
*'''[[Harpoon (comics)|Harpoon]]''' (Kodiak Noatak), a young [[Inuit]] who can charge objects (usually his ''Slayspears'' - 20 pound (9 kg) barbed harpoons) with electromagnetism , concussive force, or stunning energy.
*'''[[Lady Mastermind]]''', an illusion-creating mutant and one of [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Jason Wyngarde]]'s (the original Mastermind) daughters.
*'''[[Mister Sinister]]''' (Nathaniel Essex), Sinister was the leader of the Marauders and is the one who told them to slaughter the Morlocks.
*'''[[Malice (comics)|Malice]]''', one of Sinister’s top lieutenants whose sadistic orders are followed without hesitation or question. She exists as an incorporeal psychic being that possesses others, though she often 'hides' in the person's subconscious and reveals herself in a [[mirror]] or as the dark side of the target’s consciousness. For much of her public activity with the other Marauders, she used the X-Man [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]] as a host. Malice was apparently killed by Sinister for disobeying orders,<ref>''X-Factor'' #105</ref> but has returned as a digital entity, rather than a psionic one, and possessed [[Karima Shapandar|Omega Sentinel]].<ref name="xmen200">''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #200</ref>. Not be confused with the Fantastic Four villain named Malice.
*'''[[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]''', a shapeshifter and mother of Rogue and Nightcrawler. She infiltrated the X-Men in order to betray them from within.
*'''[[Prism (comics)|Prism]]''', an overconfident and cold-blooded killer who often underestimates the fragility of his [[crystal]]line body which can deflect/reflect most forms of energy attacks, but not physical impact. 
*'''[[Riptide (comics)|Riptide]]''' (Janos Questad), a brutally evil man who can spin his body at superhuman speeds and fling out [[shuriken]]s (made from a resin his skin secretes) for amazing amounts of damage. He was the first of the Marauders to "die", when his neck was broken by [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]].
*'''[[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]]''' (Victor Creed), the longtime enemy of [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]].
*'''[[Scalphunter (Marvel Comics)|Scalphunter]]''' (John Greycrow), a ruthless ex-G.I., and the group’s tactician. His orders are overruled only by Malice or Sinister. Scalphunter is the most cold-blooded of the group. He is capable of "technomorphing" (altering the configuration of any technological device), a power he uses to create a number of weapons from his battle armor. He also has incredible regenerative powers as he survived being executed by his fellow American soldiers in [[1944]] after having murdered and scalped eight fellow officers.
*'''[[Scrambler (comics)|Scrambler]]''' (Kim Il Sung), the youngest Marauder, is a Korean mutant who can disrupt electromagnetic, mechanical, physiological, and genetic systems, such as [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] abilities, with a touch. He is a psychopath more concerned with looking stylish than with the suffering he inflicts on others.
*'''[[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]]''', a Japanese mutant and former X-Man with fire manipulation abilities.
*'''[[Vertigo (Marvel Comics)#Vertigo (Marauder)|Vertigo]]''', who can psionically induce a sensation of vertigo in others. She was originally one of the [[Savage Land Mutates]]. 

Although several Marauders died during the "Morlock Massacre", they reappeared during the ''[[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]]'' [[fictional crossover#comics|crossover]]. It was later revealed that Mister Sinister has created numerous [[molecular cloning|clones]] of all of the Marauders save for Sabretooth, whose regenerative abilities made cloning difficult, and Malice, who was a purely psychic entity and therefore had no genetic material. It is revealed that [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] had organized the group, although he was never actually a member.<ref>''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #350</ref> The Marauders' loyalty to Sinister is ensured through gene imprints they all possess that would kill them should they turn on the geneticist.

As of [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], the event where the [[Scarlet Witch]] depowered over 90% of the worldwide mutant population, only Arclight, Prism, Scalphunter, and Scrambler were seen to still have their powers. Arclight and Scalphunter have become two of the 198 who are camped at the [[X-Mansion]], while Prism is in a maximum security [[prison]].<ref>''Generation M'' limited series</ref>

Recently, the Marauders returned and attacked the X-Men and Providence to obtain certain mutants on a list, with Rogue being one of these listed mutants.<ref name="xmen200"/> This incarnation of the team consists of the original lineup as well as [[Malice (comics)|Malice]], who possessed [[Karima Shapandar|Omega Sentinel]] after disguising itself as a e-mail, and former X-Men [[Lady Mastermind]], [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]], [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] and [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], who have all aligned themselves with [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]] [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]], [[Random (comics)|Random]], [[Joanna Cargill|Frenzy]], [[Tempo (comics)|Tempo]] and [[Unuscione]].[http://www.uncannyxmen.net/db/article/showquestion.asp?faq=12&fldAuto=323]

The team plays a major role in the ''[[X-Men: Messiah Complex|Messiah Complex]]'' storyline. They arrive in Alaska and ended up killing some [[Purifiers]] with the loss of Blockbuster and Prism, wihout finding the mutant child. In X-Men #205, Sinister's Antarctic base is raided by a team of X-Men (Storm, Wolverine, Colossus, Angel and Nightcrawler) demanding the return of both the child (who they assumed was in Sinister's possession) and Rogue. With the aid of their master, the Marauders managed to fight the X-Men off, suffering numerous injuries from their assault in the process, before withdrawing back to one of Sinister's alternate bases. The Marauders are now fully aware that Cable possesses the child, and have regrouped to begin the hunt anew.

==Original Marauders==
The modern day Marauders who were responsible for the Mutant Massacre were not Sinister's first group of henchmen that had this name. While Sinister was still Nathaniel Essex, the Marauders were a band of criminals hired by Essex to kidnap homeless and/or deformed people (possibly even mutants) on which to experiment. Many of the Marauders, like their leader Cootie Tremble, were altered by [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] into cyborgs after they accidentally awakened him. One of the Marauders, Oscar Stamp, repented for his crimes and became the adoptive father of a boy named Daniel, one of Essex's victims. Together they travelled to the United States and took on the surname Summers in honor of the time-traveling [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], who was actually Daniel's descendant.

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the [[Age of Apocalypse]], the Marauders were a band of human terrorists serving Apocalypse. As they lacked powers of their own, they employed gliding discs and energy gauntlets to wreak havoc among the human settlements of [[Wakanda (Marvel)|Wakanda]], until they were killed by [[Gwen Stacy]] and [[Hawkeye (comics)|Clint Barton]]. The Marauders were Dirigible ([[Kingpin (comics)#|Wilson Fisk]]), Red ([[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]]), [[Arcade (comics)|Arcade]], and [[Owl (comics)|the Owl]].

===House of M===
In the [[House of M]], the Marauders are a covert ops group lead by [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]] and consisting of [[T-Rex (comics)|T-Rex]], [[Mammomax]], [[Blob (comics)|Blob]], [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], [[Sunder (comics)|Sunder]], [[Black Tom Cassidy]], and [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]]. They are charged with capturing [[Nocturne (comics)|Nocturne]].

===Ultimate Marauders===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Universe]] the Marauders appear as a [[white supremacy|white supremacist]] group led by [[Arnim Zola|Arnim Zola]]. <ref> ''Ulimates Annual'' #2 </ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
Some of the Marauders appeared in the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men Animated Series]]'', though the [[Nasty Boys]] were Sinister's enforcers in the show. Both Blockbuster and Arclight made numerous cameo appearances as random placeholders, while [[Vertigo (Marvel Comics)#Vertigo (Marauder)|Vertigo]], shown first with the Savage Land Mutates, like the comics version, later became the sole female member of the Nasty Boys.
