The '''Marauders''' are a group of [[fictional character]]s, [[supervillain]]s in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]] and enemies of the [[X-Men]].  They are agents of [[Mister Sinister]], and are best known for their involvement in the [[Mutant Massacre]], in which they slaughtered the mutant community known as the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]].

The Marauders include:
*'''Arclight''' (Philippa Sontag), a super-strong mutant who is always spoiling for a fight; her mutation allows her to release shockwaves (like  [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]] and [[Rictor (comics)|Rictor]]).  She served with the American ground forces in [[Vietnam War|'Nam]], and is still haunted by memories of that place.  She has a romantic interest in Scalphunter.
*'''Blockbuster''' (Michael Baer), a superhumanly strong mutant who has stood up to punches from [[Thor (comics)|Thor]].  He did some work with German terrorists before hooking up with Sinister.
*'''Harpoon''' (Kodiak Noatak), a young [[Inuit]] who can charge objects (usually his ''Slayspears'' - 20 pound (9 kg) barbed harpoons) with electrical, concussive force, or stunning energies.
*'''[[Malice (comics)|Malice]]''', one of Sinister’s top lieutenants, and her sadistic orders are followed without hesitation or question.  She exists as an incorporeal psychic being who possesses others, though she often 'hides' in the person and reveals herself in a [[mirror]] or as the dark side of the target’s consciousness.
*'''Prism''', an overconfident and cold-blooded killer who often underestimates the fragility of his [[crystal]]line body (which can deflect/reflect most forms of energy attacks).
*'''Riptide''' (Janos Questad), a brutally evil man who can spin his body at superhuman speeds and fling out [[Shuriken|shurikens]] (made from a resin his skin secretes) for amazing amounts of damage.
*'''[[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]]''' (Victor Creed), the longtime enemy of [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]].
*'''Scalphunter''' (John Greycrow), a ruthless ex-G.I., and the group’s tactician.  His orders are overruled only by Malice or Sinister.  Scalphunter is the most cold-blooded of the group. He's capable of technomorphing (alter the configuration of any technological device), which he uses to create a numbre of weapons from his battle armor. He also has incredible regenerative powers -- he survived being executed by his fellow American soldiers in [[1944]] (he had murdered and scalped eight fellow officers).
*'''Scrambler''' (Kim Il Sung), the youngest Marauder, can disrupt electrical, mechanical, physiological, and genetic ([[mutant (fictional)|Mutant]] abilities) systems with a touch.  This [[Korean people|Korean]] is a psychopath more concerned with looking stylish than with the suffering he inflicts on others.
*'''[[Vertigo (Marvel Comics)|Vertigo]]''', who can psionically induce a sensation of vertigo in others; she was originally a member of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]'s [[Savage Land Mutates]].

Although several Marauders died during the "Morlock Massacre", they reappeared during the "Inferno" [[fictional crossover|crossover]]; it was later revealed that Mister Sinister has created numerous [[cloning|clone]]s of all of the Marauders save for Sabretooth, whose regenerative abilities made cloning difficult. ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #350 revealed that [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] had organized the group, although he was never actually a member.  The Marauders' loyalty to Sinister is insured through gene imprints they all possess that would kill them should they turn on the geneticist.
