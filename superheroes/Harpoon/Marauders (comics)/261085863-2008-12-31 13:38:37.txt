The '''Marauders''' is a team of [[fiction]]al [[supervillain]] characters in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[John Romita, Jr.]], the team first appear in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #210 (Oct. 1986).

The Marauders are [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] assassins employed by the [[X-Men]] archfiend [[Mister Sinister]], with the purpose of assassination of other mutants, and act in unison as a commando strike-force to carry out acts of mass murder.

==Publication history==
The Marauders makes their first appearance in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #210 during the 1986 [[fictional crossover#comics|crossover]], the ''[[Mutant Massacre]]'', slaughtering a large percentage of the mutant community living beneath Manhattan known as the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]]. During their battles with the X-Men, [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] including the Norse God [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], several Marauders are apparently killed; [[Riptide]] in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #211; [[Prism (comics)|Prims]] in ''X-Factor'' #10; and [[Blockbuster (comics)|Blockbuster]]  in ''The Mighty Thor'' #374.

In ''Uncanny X-Men'' #213, [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] attacks [[X-Mansion|Xavier's mansion]] while [[Malice (comics)|Malice]] succeds in possessing [[Dazzler]] but is driven out in issue #214. Later in issue #219, the Marauders attacks [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]], whom Malice takes possession of and becomes leader over the Marauders. The Marauders then tries to assassinate [[Madelyne Pryor]] in issues #221-222.

During the 1989 crossover ''[[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]]'', the dead Marauders mysteriously reappears alive in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #240 and battles the X-Men during the demonic invasion of Manhattan. Blockbuster, Malice, and Sabretooth later attacks the X-Men at Xavier's mansion in issue #243.

''X-Men'' #34 (vol. 2, July 1994) reveals that Sinister is able to [[molecular cloning|clone]] the Marauders back to life; ''Gambit'' #8 (vol. 3, Sept. 1999) further reveals that all the clones have gene imprints that would shut them down if they turn against Sinister.

The Marauders also chases after the mutant [[Threnody (comics)|Threnody]] in ''[[X-Man]]'' issues #13-18-19 (March-Sept. 1996).

The 1996 miniseries, ''[[Further Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix]]'', features a band of criminals known as the Marauders during the [[19th century]], hired by Mister Sinister to kidnap homeless and deformed people on which to experiment.

''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #350 (December 1997) reveals that it was [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] who had organized the modern day Marauders, although he was never actually a member.

The Marauders makes an appearance in ''Cable Annual '99'', disguised as minions of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] and  battles [[Cable (comics)|Cable]].

The Marauders return in ''X-Men'' #200 (vol. 2, August 2007), attacking the X-Men and Providence to obtain certain mutants on a list. This incarnation of the team consists of the original lineup as well as [[Malice (comics)#Malice (Marauders)|Malice]], who possessed [[Karima Shapandar|Omega Sentinel]] after disguising itself as an e-mail, and former X-Men [[Lady Mastermind]], [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]], [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]], and [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], who have all aligned themselves with [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]] [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]], [[Random (comics)|Random]], [[Joanna Cargill|Frenzy]], [[Tempo (comics)|Tempo]], and [[Unuscione]]. <ref>http://www.uncannyxmen.net/db/article/showquestion.asp?faq=12&fldAuto=323</ref>

The Marauders plays a major role in ''[[X-Men: Messiah Complex]]'' storyline. In ''Messiah Complex: Chapter One'', they arrive in Alaska and kills some [[Purifiers]] with the loss of Blockbuster and Prism, without finding the specical mutant child. In ''X-Men'' #205, the Marauders battles the X-Men at Sinister's Antarctic base.  In ''Uncanny X-Men'' #494, the Marauders track Cable and the baby to Forge's Aerie in Dallas, where they defeat [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] and seizes the mutant child.

The Marauders appeared once again in the ongoing series of X-Force, where a contingent of Marauders clones had recently awakened after the death of Mister Sinister. The team returns to the facility where Vanisher lost the virus and battle the cloned assassins.

==Lineup==
[[image:Marauders001.jpg|The Marauders in a scene from ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #221 (Sept. 1987). Art by [[Marc Silvestri]].|thumb]]
* '''[[Arclight (comics)|Arclight (Philippa Sontag)]]''': A super-strong mutant, her mutation allows her to release shockwaves (like  [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]] and [[Rictor]]) most often to amplify the impact of her blows. She served with the American ground forces in the [[Vietnam War]], and is still haunted by memories of that place. She has a romantic interest in Scalphunter.
* '''[[Blockbuster (Marauder)|Blockbuster (Michael Baer)]]''': A superhumanly strong mutant who has stood up to punches from [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], though a single hammer blow from an enraged Thor killed him. He did some work with German terrorists before hooking up with Sinister.
* '''Hans''': A creation of Sinister while he was infiltrated at the [[Weapon X]] Program, at a time in which only Scalphunter remained loyal to Sinister. Even though he possessed a wide array of powers, he was nonetheless killed by Sabretooth. Hans was the first of Sinister's creations dubbed The Children. He has no relation to the [[Children of the Vault]].
* '''[[Harpoon (comics)|Harpoon (Kodiak Noatak)]]''': A young [[Inuit]] who can charge objects (usually his ''Slayspears'' - 20 pound (9 kg) barbed harpoons) with bio-energy for various effects.
* '''[[Malice (comics)#Malice (Marauders)|Malice]]''': One of Sinister's top lieutenants whose sadistic orders are followed without hesitation or question. She exists as an incorporeal psychic being that possesses others, though she often 'hides' in the person's subconscious and reveals herself in a [[mirror]] or as the dark side of the target’s consciousness. For much of her public activity with the other Marauders, she used the X-Man [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]] as a host. Malice was apparently killed by Sinister for disobeying orders,<ref>''X-Factor'' #105</ref> but has returned as a digital entity, rather than a psionic one, and possessed [[Karima Shapandar|Omega Sentinel]].<ref name="xmen200">''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #200</ref>. Not be confused with the [[Fantastic Four]] villain named [[Malice (comics)#Malice (split personality)|Malice]].
* '''[[Mister Sinister|Mister Sinister (Nathaniel Essex)]]''': Leader of the Marauders.
* '''[[Prism (comics)|Prism]]''': An overconfident and cold-blooded killer who often underestimates the fragility of his [[crystal]]line body which can deflect/reflect most forms of energy attacks, but not physical impact. 
* '''[[Riptide (comics)|Riptide (Janos Questad)]]''': a brutally evil man who can spin his body at superhuman speeds and fling out [[shuriken]]s (made from a resin his skin secretes) for amazing amounts of damage. He was the first of the Marauders to "die", when his neck was broken by [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]].
* '''[[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth (Victor Creed)]]''': The longtime enemy of [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]].
*'''[[Scalphunter (Marvel Comics)|Scalphunter (John Greycrow)]]''': A ruthless ex-G.I., and the group’s tactician. His orders are overruled only by Malice or Sinister. Scalphunter is the most cold-blooded of the group. He is capable of "technomorphing" (altering the configuration of any technological device), a power he uses to create a number of weapons from his battle armor. He also has incredible regenerative powers as he survived being executed by his fellow American soldiers in 1944 after having murdered and scalped eight fellow officers.
*'''[[Scrambler (comics)|Scrambler (Kim Il Sung)]]''': The youngest Marauder, is a Korean mutant who can manipulate powers and systems, whether they be biogenetic, electromagnetic, or even technomechanical, such as [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] abilities, upon physical contact. He has been shown to be a psychopath more concerned with looking stylish than with the suffering he inflicts on others.
* '''[[Vertigo (Marvel Comics)#Vertigo (Marauder)|Vertigo]]''': A mutant who can psionically induce a sensation of vertigo in others. She was originally one of the [[Savage Land Mutates]].

During the ''Messiah Complex'' storyline, four former X-Men joined the Marauders.

* '''[[Gambit (comics)|Gambit (Remy LeBeau)]]''': Before joining the X-Men, Gambit was hired by Sinister to assemble the Marauders. Feeling responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Morlocks, Gambit kept this a secret from the X-Men until [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] absorbed his memories and found out Gambit's secret. His brainwashing by Apocalypse and manipulation by Sinister has led him to abandon the X-Men.
* '''[[Lady Mastermind]]''': An illusion-creating mutant and one of [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Jason Wyngarde]]'s (the original Mastermind) daughters.
* '''[[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]''': A [[shapeshifting|shapeshifter]] and mother of Rogue and [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]. She infiltrated the X-Men in order to betray them from within.
* '''[[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]]''': A Japanese mutant and former X-Man with fire generation and manipulation abilities.
