The '''Marauders''' are a group of [[fictional character]]s, [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]] and enemies of the [[X-Men]].  They are agents of [[Mister Sinister]], and are best known for their involvement in the "Mutant Massacre", in which they slaughtered the mutant community known as the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]].

The membership of the Marauders includes:
*'''Arclight''' (Philippa Sontag), who possesses superhuman strength and the ability to generate blinding light.
*'''Prism'''
*'''[[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]]''' (Victor Creed), the longtime enemy of [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]].
*'''Scalphunter''' (Grey Crow)
*'''Scrambler''', who can cancel out other [[mutant]]s' powers with violent feedback.
*'''Vertigo''', who can induce a sensation of vertigo in others; she was originally a member of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]'s [[Savage Land Mutates]].

Although several Marauders died during the "Morlock Massacre", they reappeared during the "Inferno" [[fictional crossover|crossover]]; it was later revealed that Mister Sinister has created numerous [[clone]]s of all of the Marauders save for Sabretooth, whose regenerative abilities made cloning difficult.  ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #350 revealed that [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] had organized the group, although he was never actually a member.
