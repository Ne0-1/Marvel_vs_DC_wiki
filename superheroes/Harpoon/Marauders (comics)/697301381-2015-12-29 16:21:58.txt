The '''Marauders''' is a team of [[fiction]]al [[supervillain]] characters appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The Marauders are [[mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[Assassination|assassins]] employed by the [[X-Men]] archfiend [[Mister Sinister]], with the purpose of assassination of other mutants, and act in unison as a commando strike-force to carry out acts of mass murder.

==Publication history==
The Marauders first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #210 (Oct. 1986) and were created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[John Romita, Jr.]].

==Fictional team biography==
The Marauders make their first appearance during the 1986 [[Crossover (comics)|crossover]], the "[[Mutant Massacre]]", slaughtering a large percentage of the mutant community living beneath Manhattan known as the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]]. During their battles with the X-Men, [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] and the Norse God [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], several Marauders are apparently killed; [[Riptide (comics)|Riptide]] in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #211; [[Prism (comics)|Prism]] in ''X-Factor'' #10; and [[Blockbuster (Marauder)|Blockbuster]] in ''The Mighty Thor'' #374. After the Mutant Massacre, Sabretooth attacked some kids in the tunnels in ''Daredevil'' #238.

In ''Uncanny X-Men'' #213, [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] attacks [[X-Mansion|Xavier's mansion]] while [[Malice (comics)#Malice (Marauder)|Malice]] succeeds in possessing [[Dazzler]] but is driven out.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #213-214</ref> The Marauders attack [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]], whom Malice takes possession of and becomes leader over the Marauders.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #219</ref> The Marauders then try to assassinate [[Madelyne Pryor]] in issues #221-222. It also shows flashbacks of them in ''X-Factor'' #39, and ''Uncanny X-Men'' #215.

During the 1989 crossover "[[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]]", the dead Marauders mysteriously reappear alive in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #240 and battle the X-Men during the demonic invasion of Manhattan. Most of them perish here. Blockbuster, Malice, and Sabretooth later attack the X-Men at Xavier's mansion in issue #243.

''X-Men'' #34 (vol. 2, July 1994) reveals that Sinister is able to [[molecular cloning|clone]] the Marauders back to life; ''Gambit'' #8 (vol. 3, Sept. 1999) further reveals that all the clones have gene imprints that would shut them down if they turn against Sinister. In ''Gambit'' #9, the clone samples for Sabretooth were seemingly destroyed. However, in later issues of ''[[X-Force]]'',<ref name="X-Force vol. 3, #9">''X-Force'' vol. 3, #9</ref> a clone of Sabretooth was shown.

The Marauders also chase after the mutant [[Threnody (comics)|Threnody]] in ''[[Nate Grey|X-Man]]'' issues #13-18-19 (March-Sept. 1996).

The 1996 miniseries, ''[[The Further Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix]]'', features a band of criminals known as the Marauders during the 19th century, hired by Mister Sinister to kidnap homeless and deformed people on which to experiment.

''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #350 (December 1997) reveals that it was [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] who had organized the modern day Marauders, although he was never actually a member. It also says that it was he who brought them down to the Morlock tunnels. He had no idea of their intentions, and when they started killing all of them, all he could do is save a little girl named Sarah (later [[Marrow (comics)|Marrow]]). This contradicts with previous versions of the story since in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #210, it was shown that the Marauders followed a young Morlock girl, Tommy. This is one of several contradictions between the two versions of the story.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uncannyxmen.net/db/issues/showquestion.asp?fldAuto=232 |title=UXN Presents... The Wolverine Event! |publisher=Uncannyxmen.net |date= |accessdate=2013-08-30}}</ref>

The Marauders also make an appearance in ''Cable Annual '99'', disguised as minions of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] and battle [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] after he sees through the guise.

The Marauders return in ''X-Men'' #200 (vol. 2, August 2007), attacking the X-Men and Providence to obtain certain mutants on a list. This incarnation of the team consists of the original lineup as well as [[Malice (comics)#Malice (Marauder)|Malice]], who possessed [[Karima Shapandar|Omega Sentinel]] after disguising herself as an e-mail; the former X-Men [[Lady Mastermind]]; [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]]; [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]]; and [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], who have all aligned themselves with [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]] [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]], [[Random (comics)|Random]], [[Joanna Cargill|Frenzy]], [[Tempo (comics)|Tempo]], and [[Unuscione]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uncannyxmen.net/db/article/showquestion.asp?faq=12&fldAuto=323 |title=UXN Presents... The Wolverine Event! |publisher=Uncannyxmen.net |date= |accessdate=2013-08-30}}</ref>

On the list is a group of people or places that have information of the future, or even alternate timelines. In ''Cable and Deadpool'' #42 and ''X-Men'' #200, Sunfire and Gambit seemingly killed Cable, while [[Senyaka]] attacked Deadpool. Also in ''X-Men'' #200, Riptide killed [[Quiet Bill]], and Scalphunter and Vertigo killed the [[Alternative versions of Gambit#Bishop's future|Witness]]. In issue #202, it is revealed that Arclight brought down the Wohnhaus Strucker, a building that has ties to the future. Also in issue #202, it is revealed that Harpoon impaled [[Vargas (comics)|Vargas]] with harpoons until his death. The Dark Mother was another victim taken out. They also thought they killed [[Gateway (comics)|Gateway]], although he survived. [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] was also sought after in these attacks. Later in issue #202, the Acolytes attack the X-Mansion looking for [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]]'s diaries, but find fakes. They also go to take out [[Blindfold (comics)|Blindfold]], but she saw them coming and prevented her death. In issue #203, Iceman and Cannonball go against the Marauders for the diaries, but the diaries are destroyed in the process.

The Marauders also play a major role in ''[[X-Men: Messiah Complex]]'' storyline. In ''Messiah Complex: Chapter One'', they arrive in Alaska and kill some [[Purifiers]] with the loss of Blockbuster and Prism, without finding the special mutant child.<ref>''X-Men: Messiah Complex'' #1</ref> In ''X-Men'' #205, the Marauders battles the X-Men at Sinister's Antarctic base. In ''Uncanny X-Men'' #494, the Marauders track Cable and the baby to Forge's Aerie in Dallas, where they defeat [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] and seize the mutant child. The Marauders fight in the final battle on Muir Island and Scrambler and Vertigo seemingly all die.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #494</ref>

The Marauders appeared once again in the ongoing series of ''X-Force'', where a contingent of Marauders clones had recently awakened after the death of Mister Sinister. X-Force returns to the facility where Vanisher lost the virus and battle and killed all the cloned assassins.<ref name="X-Force vol. 3, #9"/>

The Marauders returned in the pages of ''Astonishing X-Men'', with a yet undetermined motive. The new lineup consists of: Arclight, Blockbuster, Harpoon, Prism, and Vanisher, with Chimera as the apparent new leader.<ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' vol. 3, #48</ref> It was eventually revealed that they were actually assembled by Susan Hatchi, actually Da'o Coy Manh, the half-sister of the mutant known as Karma, so she could get her revenge on their father. They were eventually defeated.<ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' vol. 3, #50</ref>

The clones of the Marauders except for Sabretooth and Malice where later hunted down by Magneto (who was determined to make them pay once and for all for the massacre of the Morlocks). However, as Magneto killed each of the Marauder clones, new clones were activated. He eventually hunted all the clones down and killed them all with the exception of Scapulhunter, whose arms and legs were cut. After tracking the remained clones in a port and killing them all, Magneto prevented the new clones from being activated and instead modifies their personalities to deploy in the future at his command.<ref>''Magneto'' vol. 3 #6</ref>

Following [[AXIS (comics)|World War Hate]], Magneto lead various mutants from the Red Skull's concentration camp in Genosha and began reconstructing the island. However, S.H.I.E.L.D. appeared to take Magneto into custody. Powered by MGH, Magneto over powered S.H.I.E.L.D. but, surrounded.<ref>''Magneto'' vol. 3 #14</ref> 

Magneto had the intention of destroying S.H.I.E.L.D.'s mutant files along their Cerebro. Magneto unleashed the Marauders as a distraction while he completed his objective. Not wanting to wage war against S.H.I.E.L.D. yet, Magneto and the Marauders retired, however, noting that the Sabretooth clone's healing factor and killing tendencies were resisting his programming, he killed him before leaving. After various mutants were killed, the Marauders accompanied Magneto's investigation.<ref>''Magneto'' vol. 3 #16</ref>

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event, Mister Sinister later formed another incarnation of the Marauders consisting of [[Aries (comics)|Aries]], Azimuth, [[Chimera (comics)|Chimera]], and Coda. They pursued Nightcrawler through the sewers in order to capture Nightcrawler and bring him back to Mister Sinister to be one of his specimens. Azimuth was the one who knocked out Nightcrawler.<ref>''Extraordinary X-Men'' #1</ref>

* '''[[Mister Sinister|Mister Sinister (Nathaniel Essex)]]''': Leader of the Marauders.

* '''[[Arclight (comics)|Arclight (Philippa Sontag)]]''': A super-strong mutant, her mutation allows her to release shockwaves (like [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]] and [[Rictor]]) and cause disorientation to her enemies, cause objects to shatter, and to generate earth tremors in limited areas. She served with the American ground forces in the [[Vietnam War]], and is still haunted by memories of that place. She has a romantic interest in Scalphunter.

* '''[[Blockbuster (Marauder)|Blockbuster (Michael Baer)]]''': A superhumanly strong mutant who has stood up to punches from [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], though a single hammer blow from an enraged Thor killed him. He did some work with German terrorists before hooking up with Sinister.

* '''[[Harpoon (comics)|Harpoon (Kodiak Noatak)]]''': A young [[Inuit]] who can charge objects (usually his ''Slayspears'' - 20 pound (9&nbsp;kg) barbed harpoons) with bio-energy for various effects.

* '''[[Malice (comics)#Malice (Marauder)|Malice]]''': One of Sinister's top lieutenants whose sadistic orders are followed without hesitation or question. She exists as an incorporeal psychic being that possesses others, though she often 'hides' in the person's subconscious and reveals herself in a [[mirror]] or as the dark side of the target’s consciousness. For much of her public activity with the other Marauders, she used the X-Man [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]] as a host. Malice was apparently killed by Sinister for disobeying orders,<ref>''X-Factor'' #105</ref> but has returned as a digital entity, rather than a psionic one, and possessed [[Karima Shapandar|Omega Sentinel]].<ref name="xmen200">''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #200</ref> Not be confused with the [[Fantastic Four]] villain named [[Malice (comics)#Malice (Sue Storm)|Malice]].

* '''[[Vertigo (Marvel Comics)|Vertigo]]''': A mutate who can psionically induce a sensation of vertigo in others.

===Second roster===
* '''Hans''': A creation of Mister Sinister while he was infiltrated at the [[Weapon X]] Program, at a time in which only Scalphunter remained loyal to Sinister.

He has no relation to the [[Children of the Vault]].

Feeling responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Morlocks, Gambit kept this a secret from the X-Men until [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] absorbed his memories and found out Gambit's secret. His brainwashing by Apocalypse and manipulation by Sinister led him to abandon the X-Men, though he has since returned to the team.

* '''[[Lady Mastermind|Lady Mastermind (Regan Wyngarde)]]''': An illusion-creating mutant and one of [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Jason Wyngarde]]'s (the original Mastermind) daughters.

Cyclops ended up disrupting their missions at the time when Cyclops thought Mister Sinister had [[Jean Grey]]. In the episode "Guardian Angel", Mister Sinister transforms Angel into Archangel as a way to restore his wings. Archangel becomes a full Marauder in the episode "Shades of Grey" in which he and the other Marauders (namely Arclight, Blockbuster, and Vertigo) are captured but escape. The final scene showed that Mister Sinister and the Marauders are in league with [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]].
