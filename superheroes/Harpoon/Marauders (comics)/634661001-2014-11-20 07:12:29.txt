The '''Marauders''' is a team of [[fiction]]al [[supervillain]] characters in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[John Romita, Jr.]], the team first appear in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #210 (Oct. 1986).

The Marauders are [[mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] assassins employed by the [[X-Men]] archfiend [[Mister Sinister]], with the purpose of assassination of other mutants, and act in unison as a commando strike-force to carry out acts of mass murder.

==Publication history==
The Marauders make their first appearance in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #210 during the 1986 [[Crossover (comics)|crossover]], the "[[Mutant Massacre]]", slaughtering a large percentage of the mutant community living beneath Manhattan known as the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]]. During their battles with the X-Men, [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] including the Norse God [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], several Marauders are apparently killed; [[Riptide (comics)|Riptide]] in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #211; [[Prism (comics)|Prism]] in ''X-Factor'' #10; and [[List of Marvel Comics characters: B#Michael Baer|Blockbuster]] in ''The Mighty Thor'' #374. After the Mutant Massacre, Sabretooth attacked some kids in the tunnels in ''Daredevil'' #238.

In ''Uncanny X-Men'' #213, [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] attacks [[X-Mansion|Xavier's mansion]] while [[Malice (comics)#Malice (Marauder)|Malice]] succeeds in possessing [[Dazzler]] but is driven out in issue #214. Later in issue #219, the Marauders attack [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]], whom Malice takes possession of and becomes leader over the Marauders. The Marauders then try to assassinate [[Madelyne Pryor]] in issues #221-222. It also shows flashbacks of them in ''X-Factor'' #39, and ''Uncanny X-Men'' #215.

During the 1989 crossover "[[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]]", the dead Marauders mysteriously reappear alive in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #240 and battle the X-Men during the demonic invasion of Manhattan. Most of them perish here. Blockbuster, Malice, and Sabretooth later attack the X-Men at Xavier's mansion in issue #243.

''X-Men'' #34 (vol. 2, July 1994) reveals that Sinister is able to [[molecular cloning|clone]] the Marauders back to life; ''Gambit'' #8 (vol. 3, Sept. 1999) further reveals that all the clones have gene imprints that would shut them down if they turn against Sinister. In ''Gambit'' #9, the clone samples for Sabretooth were seemingly destroyed. However, in later issues of ''[[X-Force]]'',<ref>''X-Force'' vol. 3, #9</ref> a clone of Sabretooth was shown.

The Marauders also chase after the mutant [[Threnody (comics)|Threnody]] in ''[[Nate Grey|X-Man]]'' issues #13-18-19 (March-Sept. 1996).

The 1996 miniseries, ''[[The Further Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix]]'', features a band of criminals known as the Marauders during the 19th century, hired by Mister Sinister to kidnap homeless and deformed people on which to experiment.

''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #350 (December 1997) reveals that it was [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] who had organized the modern day Marauders, although he was never actually a member. It also says that it was he who brought them down to the Morlock tunnels. He had no idea of their intentions, and when they started killing all of them, all he could do is save a little girl named Sarah (later [[Marrow (comics)|Marrow]]). This contradicts with previous versions of the story since in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #210, it was shown that the Marauders followed a young Morlock girl, Tommy. This is one of several contradictions between the two versions of the story.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uncannyxmen.net/db/issues/showquestion.asp?fldAuto=232 |title=UXN Presents... The Wolverine Event! |publisher=Uncannyxmen.net |date= |accessdate=2013-08-30}}</ref>

The Marauders also make an appearance in ''Cable Annual '99'', disguised as minions of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] and battle [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] after he sees through the guise.

The Marauders return in ''X-Men'' #200 (vol. 2, August 2007), attacking the X-Men and Providence to obtain certain mutants on a list. This incarnation of the team consists of the original lineup as well as [[Malice (comics)#Malice (Marauder)|Malice]], who possessed [[Karima Shapandar|Omega Sentinel]] after disguising herself as an e-mail; the former X-Men [[Lady Mastermind]]; [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]]; [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]]; and [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], who have all aligned themselves with [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]] [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]], [[Random (comics)|Random]], [[Joanna Cargill|Frenzy]], [[Tempo (comics)|Tempo]], and [[Unuscione]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uncannyxmen.net/db/article/showquestion.asp?faq=12&fldAuto=323 |title=UXN Presents... The Wolverine Event! |publisher=Uncannyxmen.net |date= |accessdate=2013-08-30}}</ref>

On the list is a group of people or places that have information of the future, or even alternate timelines. In ''Cable and Deadpool'' #42 and ''X-Men'' #200, Sunfire and Gambit seemingly killed Cable, while [[Senyaka]] attacked Deadpool. Also in ''X-Men'' #200, Riptide killed [[Quiet Bill]], and Scalphunter and Vertigo killed the [[Alternative versions of Gambit#Bishop's future|Witness]]. In issue #202, it is revealed that Arclight brought down the Wohnhaus Strucker, a building that has ties to the future. Also in issue #202, it is revealed that Harpoon impaled [[Vargas (comics)|Vargas]] with harpoons until his death. The Dark Mother was another victim taken out. They also thought they killed [[Gateway (comics)|Gateway]], although he survived. [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] was also sought after in these attacks. Later in issue #202, the Acolytes attack the X-Mansion looking for [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]]'s diaries, but find fakes. They also go to take out [[Blindfold (comics)|Blindfold]], but she saw them coming and prevented her death. In issue #203, Iceman and Cannonball go against the Marauders for the diaries, but the diaries are destroyed in the process.

The Marauders also play a major role in ''[[X-Men: Messiah Complex]]'' storyline. In ''Messiah Complex: Chapter One'', they arrive in Alaska and kill some [[Purifiers]] with the loss of Blockbuster and Prism, without finding the special mutant child.<ref>''X-Men: Messiah Complex'' #1</ref> In ''X-Men'' #205, the Marauders battles the X-Men at Sinister's Antarctic base. In ''Uncanny X-Men'' #494, the Marauders track Cable and the baby to Forge's Aerie in Dallas, where they defeat [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] and seize the mutant child. The Marauders fight in the final battle on Muir Island and Scrambler and Vertigo seemingly all die.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #494</ref>

The Marauders appeared once again in the ongoing series of ''X-Force'', where a contingent of Marauders clones had recently awakened after the death of Mister Sinister. X-Force returns to the facility where Vanisher lost the virus and battle and killed all the cloned assassins.<ref>''X-Force'' vol. 3, #9</ref>

The Marauders returned in the pages of ''Astonishing X-Men'', with a yet undetermined motive. The new lineup consists of: Arclight, Blockbuster, Harpoon, Prism, and Vanisher, with Chimera as the apparent new leader.<ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' vol. 3, #48</ref> It was eventually revealed that they were actually assembled by Susan Hatchi, actually Da'o Coy Manh, the half-sister of the mutant known as Karma, so she could get her revenge on their father. They were eventually defeated.<ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' vol. 3, #50</ref>

The Marauders where later hunted down by Magneto, who was determined to make them pay once and for all for the massacre of the Morlocks. However as Magneto killed each of the Marauders, new clones were activated. He eventually hunted all the clones down and killed them all with the exception of Scapulhunter, whose arms and legs were cut. After tracking the remained clones in a port and killed them all, Magneto prevented the new clones from being activated and instead prepared them to deploy in the future at his command.<ref>''Magneto'' v3 #6</ref>

[[File:Mauraders.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The Marauders featured on the ''X-Men'' #200 wrap-around cover, with art by [[Humberto Ramos]]. Several characters include [[Vertigo (Marvel Comics)|Vertigo]], [[Riptide (comics)|Riptide]], [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]], [[Harpoon (comics)|Harpoon]], [[Scalphunter (Marvel Comics)|Scalphunter]], [[Malice (comics)#Malice (Marauder)|Malice]], [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] and [[Lady Mastermind]].]]
* '''[[Arclight (comics)|Arclight (Philippa Sontag)]]''': A super-strong mutant, her mutation allows her to release shockwaves (like [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]] and [[Rictor]]) and cause disorientation to her enemies, cause objects to shatter, and to generate earth tremors in limited areas. She served with the American ground forces in the [[Vietnam War]], and is still haunted by memories of that place. She has a romantic interest in Scalphunter.
* '''[[List of Marvel Comics characters: B#Michael Baer|Blockbuster (Michael Baer)]]''': A superhumanly strong mutant who has stood up to punches from [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], though a single hammer blow from an enraged Thor killed him. He did some work with German terrorists before hooking up with Sinister.
* '''Hans''': A creation of Sinister while he was infiltrated at the [[Weapon X]] Program, at a time in which only Scalphunter remained loyal to Sinister. Even though he possessed a wide array of powers, he was nonetheless killed by Sabretooth. Hans was the first of Sinister's creations dubbed The Children. He has no relation to the [[Children of the Vault]].
* '''[[Harpoon (comics)|Harpoon (Kodiak Noatak)]]''': A young [[Inuit]] who can charge objects (usually his ''Slayspears'' - 20 pound (9&nbsp;kg) barbed harpoons) with bio-energy for various effects.
* '''[[Malice (comics)#Malice (Marauder)|Malice]]''': One of Sinister's top lieutenants whose sadistic orders are followed without hesitation or question. She exists as an incorporeal psychic being that possesses others, though she often 'hides' in the person's subconscious and reveals herself in a [[mirror]] or as the dark side of the target’s consciousness. For much of her public activity with the other Marauders, she used the X-Man [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]] as a host. Malice was apparently killed by Sinister for disobeying orders,<ref>''X-Factor'' #105</ref> but has returned as a digital entity, rather than a psionic one, and possessed [[Karima Shapandar|Omega Sentinel]].<ref name="xmen200">''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #200</ref> Not be confused with the [[Fantastic Four]] villain named [[Malice (comics)#Malice (Sue Storm)|Malice]].
* '''[[Mister Sinister|Mister Sinister (Nathaniel Essex)]]''': Leader of the Marauders.
* '''[[Prism (comics)|Prism]]''': An overconfident and cold-blooded killer who often underestimates the fragility of his [[crystal]]line body, which can deflect/reflect most forms of energy attacks, but not physical impact.
* '''[[Riptide (comics)|Riptide (Janos Questad)]]''': A brutally evil man who can spin his body at superhuman speeds and fling out [[shuriken]]s (made from a resin his skin secretes) for amazing amounts of damage. He was the first of the Marauders to "die", when his neck was broken by [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]].
* '''[[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth (Victor Creed)]]''': The longtime enemy of [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]. He did not appear on the team during ''Messiah Complex''.
* '''[[Scalphunter (Marvel Comics)|Scalphunter (John Greycrow)]]''': A ruthless ex-G.I., and the group’s tactician. His orders are overruled only by Malice or Sinister. Scalphunter is the most cold-blooded of the group. He is capable of "technomorphing" (altering the configuration of any technological device), a power he uses to create a number of weapons from his battle armor. He also has incredible regenerative powers as he survived being executed by his fellow American soldiers in 1944 after having murdered and scalped eight fellow officers.
* '''[[Scrambler (comics)|Scrambler (Kim Il Sung)]]''': The youngest Marauder, is a Korean mutant who can manipulate powers and systems, whether they be biogenetic, electromagnetic, or even technomechanical, such as [[mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] abilities, upon physical contact. He has been shown to be a psychopath more concerned with looking stylish than with the suffering he inflicts on others.
* '''[[Vertigo (Marvel Comics)|Vertigo]]''': A mutate who can psionically induce a sensation of vertigo in others.

During the ''Messiah Complex'' storyline, four former X-Men joined the Marauders.

* '''[[Gambit (comics)|Gambit (Remy LeBeau)]]''': Before joining the X-Men, Gambit was hired by Sinister to assemble the Marauders. Feeling responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Morlocks, Gambit kept this a secret from the X-Men until [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] absorbed his memories and found out Gambit's secret. His brainwashing by Apocalypse and manipulation by Sinister led him to abandon the X-Men, though he has since returned to the team.
* '''[[Lady Mastermind|Lady Mastermind (Regan Wyngarde)]]''': An illusion-creating mutant and one of [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Jason Wyngarde]]'s (the original Mastermind) daughters.
* '''[[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]''': A [[shapeshifting|shapeshifter]], mother of [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] and the unofficial foster mother of Rogue. She infiltrated the X-Men in order to betray them from within.
* '''[[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]] (Shiro Yoshida)''': A Japanese mutant and former X-Man with fire generation and manipulation abilities.
