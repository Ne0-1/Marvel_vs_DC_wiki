==Fictional character biography==
Jinx is an East [[India]]n elemental [[magician (fantasy)|sorceress]] whose powers include the ability to command elements such as air, the manipulation of magical energy that she can manifest as offensive force bolts and green flame, the ability to dissolve matter, and create ground tremors. Jinx is [[baldness|bald]] and attractively slender. She traditionally wears only a white two-piece [[loincloth]] [[bikini]] with golden [[jewelry]], and she is always barefoot. 

She first encountered the Fearsome Five when that group attacked a research facility belonging to [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] where Jinx and another criminal, [[Neutron (DC Comics)|Neutron]] were being incarcerated.  The Five are defeated by the Teen Titans, but Jinx and Neutron decided to join the Fearsome Five.  Jinx remained with the group even after Neutron subsequently left it, but after their next appearance in ''[[Adventures of Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]]'' #430 (July 1987), in which they fought Superman alongside new members [[Deuce and Charger]], the group disbanded, and Jinx was incarcerated in the [[metahuman]] [[prison]] on [[Alcatraz]], along with her teammates [[Mammoth (comics)|Mammoth]] and [[Gizmo (comics)|Gizmo]].

Jinx was part of [[Circe (comics)|Circe's]] army of female supervillains that was defeated by [[Wonder Woman]] and Earth's superheroines.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #174-175, Vol. 2</ref> Shortly thereafter, Jinx was recruited by [[Queen Clea]] into the re-formed all-female crime organization [[Villainy Inc.]] Together with [[Cyborgirl]], [[Doctor Poison]] II, [[Giganta]], and [[Trinity (comics character)|Trinity]], Jinx assists Clea in conquering the other-dimensional land of [[Skartaris]]. The plan, however, is commandeered by Trinity. The team has not appeared since. <ref>''Wonder Woman'' #179-183, Vol. 2</ref>

Later, in a storyline in ''[[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]'' #12–15 (July–October 2004), frequent [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] archenemy [[Dr. Sivana]] freed Jinx, Mammoth and Gizmo from Alcatraz. Having summoned teammate [[Psimon]] and having brought her teammate [[Shimmer (comics)|Shimmer]] back to life after she had been turned into glass and shattered, Sivana put the team to work for him in a scheme to [[short selling|short sell]] [[Lexcorp]] stock by having them steal its accounts from its corporate building in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], and then driving down the stock by killing all the people in the building. Sivana also had them destroy two other Lexcorp properties. At the latter of the two, a [[integrated circuit|microchip]] processor factory of Lexcorp's [[subsidiary]], Kellacor, the Five were confronted by the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]. After escaping, the criminally unsophisticated Five urged Sivana to take Lexcorp's [[nuclear weapon|nuclear missile]] facility near [[Joshua Tree, California|Joshua Tree]], [[California]]. When Sivana refused, Psimon asserted that they would take it anyway, and in response, Sivana killed Gizmo with a laser blast to the head, and severed relations with the remaining four, warning them that he would kill them if they ever crossed his path again. The Five decided to enact their plan to take the facility and fire a nuclear missile at [[Canada]], but were defeated by the Outsiders. Mammoth was returned to Alcatraz Island, but Jinx and the other members of the Five remain at large.

Most recently, she as seen among the new [[Injustice League]], and is one of the villains featured in ''[[Salvation Run]]''. She is one of the villains sent to retrieve the Get Out of Hell free card from the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]].

==Powers and abilities==
Jinx is an elemental sorceress who draws her magic from natural solid ground. This is why she must have contact with the ground and her feet at all times or her magical effects become weakened or she loses them all together. Some of her elemental abilities include but are not limited to: generating powerful force bolts, conjuring wind bursts, summoning emerald flames, creating earth tremors, and even dissolving solid matter converting it into mystical energy beams. Other abilities may exist but none are certain.

==Other versions==
A different kind of Jinx appeared in "Adventure Comics" #488 and had fought [[Dial H for Hero|Chris King and Vicky Grant]] alongside Cancero and Jelly Woman. This version is male and has the power to cause bad luck.

{{Plot|date=January 2010}}
[[Image:JinxAnimated.jpg|120px|thumb|right|Jinx from ''Teen Titans'' the animated series]]
Jinx appears in the [[Teen Titans (TV series)|''Teen Titans'' animated series]] voiced by [[Lauren Tom]] in every appearance but her last, for which [[Tara Strong]] provided the voice. In this incarnation, she is a [[H.I.V.E.]] student with [[Gizmo (comics)|Gizmo]] and [[Mammoth (comics)|Mammoth]]. She was thoroughly reimagined from the comics, bearing few similarities with her comic counterpart; Jinx has pale skin, pink hair, eyes with cat-like pupils, witch-like attire, and magic based on bad luck.

The animated Jinx's powers portray a manipulation of [[probability]], more specifically, the ability to "bring bad luck" to her enemies, similar to early portrayals of the [[Marvel Comics]] characters [[Scarlet Witch]] and [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]]. Despite the "bad luck" theme to her powers, they still seem to depend in part or in whole to solid ground and structures, just like they do in the comics, as she primarily causes structures to crumble as a means of attack. She is also very agile, capable of great feats of acrobatics.

Her first appearance in the series involved her and her team, the "HIVE", ramsacking and occupying the Titans' headquarters. They lost in in the same episode back to the titans. Other episodes portray her battling the Titans and losing. Eventually she meets [[Kid Flash]] during a second attempt at robbing a necklace. Jinx is put in a difficult position when she must choose between helping Madame Rouge and the Brotherhood of evil capture Kid Flash, or helping Kid Flash avoid them. She eventually decides to help Kid Flash, due to Madame Rouge insulting and disrespecting her, and her growing attraction to Kid Flash. After wards, she finds a single rose left by Kid Flash, and leaves the H.I.V.E.

Jinx appeared once again in the final battle, along with Kid Flash. Upon arrival, Kid Flash confronts her old team, the H.I.V.E, and calls Jinx a friend as she joins him. H.I.V.E are shocked to find her, stating, "You're with him, TRAITOR!", to which Jinx replies it's nothing personnel, and takes them out with a burst of magic from snapping her hand. She also was responsible for taking out Madame Rouge, trapping her in the ground and releasing her so she got knocked out. She sarcastically told her former hero, "Oops, did I do that?"  As with the rest of the protagonists, Jinx survives the battle. The epilogue has her joining the rest of the Titans as they head off to stop [[:Doctor_Light_(Arthur_Light)#Television|Doctor Light]] from [[bank robbery|robbing a bank]].

===Teen Titans Go!===
The animated version of Jinx makes numerous appearances (in a few of which she is one of the main characters) in ''[[Teen Titans Go!]]'', starting in issue #1. Despite her limited role in the TV-series, she gained significant popularity among the fans, especially following the premiere of the episode ''Lightspeed''.<br>In #26–27, hints are given of Jinx later "turning over a new leaf" (like the hints in the episode ''Lightspeed''). She also appears in issue #34 as Kid Flash's girlfriend and becomes jealous when he begins flirting with Raven, [[Argent (comics)|Argent]], and several other females during his own charity race. She gets captured with the other heroines by [[Blackfire]] and is rescued by the Titans in issue #36. In issue #39, she is still with Kid Flash; when Larry, who is playing [[Cupid]], strikes other women with his love arrows when Flash wouldn't allow himself to be hit, she has her hands full with keeping them from flirting with her boyfriend.

Jinx also appears in issue #40, still as part of the Hive Five at that time, and issue #43, helping the Titans stop the [[Fearsome Five]]. She is mad at Raven and the Titans because she had not been given a communicator, but nevertheless she helps Robin infiltrate the Fearsome Five. When they make their appearance to Cyborg and Beast Boy, Jinx is with them (and the Titans act as if they were shocked about Jinx's "treason"). After the Fearsome Five go into Titans Tower, the Titans, Jinx, and Kid Flash ambush them, and after the battle, Robin gives her a communicator (the only reason Jinx did not get a communicator was because Robin had run out of them during the Brotherhood of Evil's battle).

In #53, it is revealed that Jinx's nickname is/was "Lucky" and that she had entertained a disappointing relationship with Kid Kold (aka Leo), one of the two villains featured in that story, before joining the H.I.V.E. In that issue she also shares her first kiss with Kid Flash.
