==Fictional character biography==
Jinx is an East [[India]]n elemental [[magician (fantasy)|sorceress]] whose powers include the ability to command elements such as air, the manipulation of magical energy that she can manifest as offensive force bolts and green flame, the ability to dissolve matter, and create ground tremors. Jinx is [[baldness|bald]] and attractively slender. She traditionally wears only a white two-piece [[loincloth]] [[bikini]] with golden [[jewelry]], and she is always barefoot. 

She first encountered the Fearsome Five when that group attacked a research facility belonging to [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] where Jinx and another criminal, [[Neutron (DC Comics)|Neutron]] were being incarcerated.  The Five are defeated by the Teen Titans, but Jinx and Neutron decided to join the Fearsome Five.  Jinx remained with the group even after Neutron subsequently left it, but after their next appearance in ''[[Adventures of Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]]'' #430 (July 1987), in which they fought Superman alongside new members [[Deuce and Charger]], the group disbanded, and Jinx was incarcerated in the [[metahuman]] [[prison]] on [[Alcatraz]], along with her teammates [[Mammoth (comics)|Mammoth]] and [[Gizmo (DC Comics)|Gizmo]].

Jinx was part of [[Circe (comics)|Circe's]] army of female supervillains that was defeated by [[Wonder Woman]] and Earth's superheroines.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' #174-175, Vol. 2</ref> Shortly thereafter, Jinx was recruited by [[Queen Clea]] into the re-formed all-female crime organization [[Villainy Inc.]] Together with [[Cyborgirl]], [[Doctor Poison]], [[Giganta]], and [[Trinity (comics character)|Trinity]], Jinx assists Clea in conquering the other-dimensional land of [[Skartaris]]. The plan, however, is commandeered by Trinity. The team has not appeared since. <ref>''Wonder Woman'' #179-183, Vol. 2</ref>

Later, in a storyline in ''[[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]'' #12–15 (July–October 2004), frequent [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] archenemy [[Dr. Sivana]] freed Jinx, Mammoth and Gizmo from Alcatraz. Having summoned teammate [[Psimon]] and having brought her teammate [[Shimmer (comics)|Shimmer]] back to life after she had been turned into glass and shattered, Sivana put the team to work for him in a scheme to [[short selling|short sell]] [[Lexcorp]] stock by having them steal its accounts from its corporate building in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], and then driving down the stock by killing all the people in the building. Sivana also had them destroy two other Lexcorp properties. At the latter of the two, a [[integrated circuit|microchip]] processor factory of Lexcorp's [[subsidiary]], Kellacor, the Five were confronted by the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]. After escaping, the criminally unsophisticated Five urged Sivana to take Lexcorp's [[nuclear weapon|nuclear missile]] facility near [[Joshua Tree, California|Joshua Tree]], [[California]]. When Sivana refused, Psimon asserted that they would take it anyway, and in response, Sivana killed Gizmo with a laser blast to the head, and severed relations with the remaining four, warning them that he would kill them if they ever crossed his path again. The Five decided to enact their plan to take the facility and fire a nuclear missile at [[Canada]], but were defeated by the Outsiders. Mammoth was returned to Alcatraz Island, but Jinx and the other members of the Five remain at large.

Most recently, she as seen among the new [[Injustice League]], and is one of the villains featured in ''[[Salvation Run]]''. She is one of the villains sent to retrieve the Get Out of Hell free card from the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]].

==Powers and abilities==
Jinx is a formidable elemental sorceress who draws her magic from natural solid ground. This is why she must have contact with the ground and her feet at all times or her magical effects become weakened or she loses them all together. Some of her elemental abilities include but are not limited to: generating powerful force blasts, conjuring wind bursts, summoning emerald flames, creating earth tremors, creative illusions and even dissolving solid matter. Jinx also has precognitive abilities where she can sense danger moments before something happens. Jinx has an ability to converse with the Earth itself, to gently manipulate even greater magic stored there. Other abilities may exist but none are certain.

==Other versions==
A different kind of Jinx appeared in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' #488 and had fought [[Dial H for Hero|Chris King and Vicki Grant]] alongside Cancero and Jelly Woman. This version is male and has the power to cause bad luck.

====Teen Titans====
[[File:JinxAnimated.jpg|120px|thumb|right|Jinx from ''Teen Titans'' the animated series]]
Jinx appears in the [[Teen Titans (TV series)|''Teen Titans'' animated series]] voiced by [[Lauren Tom]] in every appearance but her last, for which [[Tara Strong]] provided the voice. She is a [[H.I.V.E.]] student and often hangs out with [[Gizmo (DC Comics)|Gizmo]] and [[Mammoth (comics)|Mammoth]]. She has pale skin, pink hair, pink eyes with cat-like pupils and a witch-like attire.

The animated Jinx's power is probability manipulation, very similar to early portrayals of Marvel's [[Scarlet_Witch|Scarlet Witch]], for example causing structures to crumble as a means of attack. She is also very agile, capable of great feats of acrobatics.

Her first appearance in the series involved her and her team ransacking the Titans' headquarters. Other episodes portray her battling the Titans and losing. However, it was revealed that Jinx had a crush on Cyborg in the episode "Deception". In the end of the episode, before the H.I.V.E Academy was destroyed, she said "You could've been one of us." Cyborg replied, "I could've been a lot of things". Jinx shook her head and steps on to the hexagon shaped platform with [[Brother Blood]], Mammoth, and Gizmo.

Eventually she meets [[Kid Flash]] and is smitten by him instead. She eventually must choose between helping Madame Rouge and the Brotherhood of Evil or Kid Flash. She decides to help Kid Flash, because of Madam Rouge's constant insults, and because of her crush on [[Kid Flash]]. Afterwards, she finds a single rose left by Kid Flash, and leaves H.I.V.E and joins the Titans instead.

Jinx appeared once again in the final battle, along with Kid Flash. Jinx confronts her old team and Madame Rouge, taking them out single-handedly. The epilogue has her joining the rest of the Titans as they head off to stop [[:Doctor_Light_(Arthur_Light)#Television|Doctor Light]].

===Teen Titans Go!===
The animated version of Jinx makes numerous appearances in the series comic adaption ''[[Teen Titans Go!]]'', starting in issue #1. In #26–27, hints are given of Jinx later "turning over a new leaf" (like the hints in the episode ''Lightspeed''). She also appears in issue #34 as [[Kid Flash]]'s girlfriend. She gets captured with the other heroines by [[Blackfire]] and is rescued by the Titans in issue #36. In issue #39, she is still with Kid Flash; when Larry, who is playing [[Cupid]], strikes other women with his love arrows when Flash wouldn't allow himself to be hit, she has her hands full with keeping them from flirting with her boyfriend.

Jinx also appears in issue #40, still as part of the Hive Five at that time, and issue #43, helping the Titans stop the [[Fearsome Five]]. In #53, it is revealed that Jinx' nickname is "Lucky" and that she had entertained a disappointing relationship with Kid Kold (aka Leo), before joining the H.I.V.E. In that issue she also shares her first kiss with Kid Flash.

===Video games===
* Jinx is a [[boss (videogames)|boss]] in both ''[[Teen Titans (video game)|Teen Titans]]'' video games. She is also an unlockable character.
