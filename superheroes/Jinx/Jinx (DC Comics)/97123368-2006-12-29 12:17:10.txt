'''Jinx''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] appearing in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]].  She was created by [[Marv Wolfman]] and [[Chuck Patton]], and she first appeared in ''[[Tales of the Teen Titans]]'' #56 (August [[1985]]), in which she joined the supervillain group, the [[Fearsome Five]], a frequent enemy of the [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]], [[Superman]] and the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]. She has also been a member of [[Villainy Inc.]] To date, her real name has not been revealed. Jinx is bald and has [[cancer]].

Jinx is an [[India]]n elemental [[sorceress]] whose powers include the ability to command elements such as air, the manipulation of magical energy that she can manifest as offensive force bolts and green flame, the ability to dissolve matter, and create ground tremors. 

She first encountered the Fearsome Five when that group attacked a research facility belonging to [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] where Jinx and another criminal, [[Neutron (DC Comics)|Neutron]] were being incarcerated.  The Five are defeated by the Teen Titans, but Jinx and Neutron decided to join the Fearsome Five.  Jinx remained with the group even after Neutron subsequently left it, but after their next appearance in ''[[Adventures of Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]]'' #430 (July 1987), in which they fought Superman alongside new members [[Deuce and Charger]], the group disbanded, and Jinx was incarcerated in the [[metahuman]] [[prison]] on [[Alcatraz]], along with her teammates [[Mammoth (comics)|Mammoth]] and [[Gizmo (comics)|Gizmo]].

Later, in a storyline in ''[[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]'' #12–15 (July–October 2004), frequent [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] archenemy [[Dr. Sivana]] freed Jinx, Mammoth and Gizmo from Alcatraz. Having summoned teammate [[Psimon]] and having brought her teammate [[Shimmer (comics)|Shimmer]] back to life after she had been turned into glass and shattered, Sivana put the team to work for him in a scheme to [[short selling|short sell]] [[Lexcorp]] stock by having them steal its accounts from its corporate building in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], and then driving down the stock by killing all the people in the building. Sivana also had them destroy two other Lexcorp properties. At the latter of the two, a [[microchip]] processor factory of Lexcorp's [[subsidiary]], Kellacor, the Five were confronted by the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]. After escaping, the criminally unsophisticated Five urged Sivana to take Lexcorp's [[nuclear weapon|nuclear missile]] facility near [[Joshua Tree, California|Joshua Tree]], [[California]]. When Sivana refused, Psimon asserted that they would take it anyway, and in response, Sivana killed Gizmo with a laser blast to the head, and severed relations with the remaining four, warning them that he would kill them if they ever crossed his path again. The Five decided to enact their plan to take the facility and fire a nuclear missile at [[Canada]], but were defeated by the Outsiders. Mammoth was returned to Alcatraz Island, but Jinx and the other members of the Five remain at large.

Although many characters in the DC universe have changed to match their animated conterparts, it is unknown if Jinx's appearance has altered in the one-year jump.

Jinx appears in the [[Teen Titans (animated series)|''Teen Titans'' animated series]], voiced by [[Lauren Tom]] (In "Titans Together" in Season 5; voiced by [[Tara Strong]]).  In this incarnation, she is a [[H.I.V.E.]] student with [[Gizmo (comics)|Gizmo]] and [[Mammoth (comics)|Mammoth]]. Unlike her two partners in crime, she was completely reimagined from the comics, bearing no similarities with her comic counterpart. Her first mission (for which they received order from the H.I.V.E. Headmistress who had been hired by [[Slade Wilson|Slade]]) with her classmates was to destroy the Titans. They managed to get the Titans out of their tower, but the Titans returned and defeated the evil teens. In this iteration of ''Teen Titans'', Jinx has pale skin, posesses no elemental magic, has purple hair and does not have cancer.

Jinx was involved in a series of bank robberies with Gizmo and Mammoth but the Titans planted a tracking device on her while they escaped and had [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] enter the H.I.V.E. as a student to infiltrate their organization. Cyborg posed as "Stone" and befriended the villainous trio. It has been hinted at that Jinx and Stone may have developed small crushes on each other during this time, though Jinx didn't know that "Stone" was really Cyborg in disguise. Soon Cyborg's identity was revealed and he brought down the H.I.V.E. Academy. Jinx appeared hurt by Cyborg's betrayal, but escaped with her friends and formed The H.I.V.E. Five with Gizmo, Mammoth, [[Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series)#See-More|See-More]] and [[Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series)#Private H.I.V.E.|Private H.I.V.E.]] Jinx and the other members of the H.I.V.E. Five briefly engaged the Titans in combat during a raid on a shopping mall, but just as they were gaining the upper hand in the battle, the entity known as [[Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series)#Mother Mae-Eye|Mother Mae-Eye]] appeared and defeated them.

Jinx then appeared as the ''de facto'' leader of a slightly reorganized H.I.V.E. Five group, consisting of herself, Mammoth, Gizmo, [[Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series)#See-More|See-More]], [[Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series)#Billy Numerous|Billy Numerous]], and [[Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series)#Ktd Wykkyd|Ktd Wykkyd]] (when it was pointed out that the group now consists of six members, rather than five, the indignant teens' only response was that the original group name "sounds cooler").  Jinx was apparently the only member of this group who took her criminal career seriously, as the other members all displayed a serious lack of initiative and a remarkably short [[attention span]]. 

This latest incarnation of the H.I.V.E. Five was foiled during a raid on a museum by the teenaged superhero [[Wally West|Kid Flash]], and in an attempt to improve the group's standing in the eyes of the [[Brotherhood of Evil]], Jinx attempted to capture Kid Flash and present him to the Brotherhood as a gift. Jinx particularly hoped to win the approval and respect of [[Madame Rouge (comics)|Madame Rouge]], whom she idolized.  However, Kid Flash took a liking to Jinx, and during their encounters, he alternately flirted with her and tried to convince her to renounce her life of crime. She later told Kid Flash that it was her power of "bad luck" that made her decide on pursuing a villainous life, since she saw little alternative considering the nature of her powers. Jinx was eventually successful in capturing Kid Flash (with See-More's assistance), but she quickly released him after Madame Rouge's constant string of insults and patronizing attitude became too much for her to bear.  At that point she swiftly knocked Madame Rouge down (which apparently impressed her as Rouge then said "We'll keep in touch"). 

Afterward, Jinx turned down an opportunity to join in a robbery with the other members of the H.I.V.E. Five, and, wishing See-More goodbye, disappeared into the shadows, assumingly to join forces with Kid Flash permanently. It is noticeable that she is the only Hive member not to attack any Titans in "Calling All Titans".  In "Titans Together" she, along with [[Kid Flash]], helped the Titans defeat the [[Brotherhood of Evil]] by capturing the H.I.V.E. Five, and then became an Honorary Titan. She was seen in the [[Titans Tower]], socializing with the other Titans and later preparing to help them stop [[Doctor Light (DC Comics supervillain)|Dr. Light]] after he robbed a bank.

==Powers and abilities==
Jinx's powers portray a [[psionic]] manipulation of probability, more specifically, the ability to "bring bad luck" to her enemies, similar to early portrayals of the [[Marvel Comics]] character [[Scarlet Witch]]; how she does this is never explored, though it may have something to do with the force of [[entropy]]. When she wants her enemies to be "unlucky" she fires waves of pink energy from her hands, often causing solid structures in her surroundings to break or fall on her opponents. She attempted to get a "lucky amulet" in the fifth season episode "Lightspeed," hinting at a secret dissatisfaction with her powers or life. At times she may be seen as a counterpart to [[Raven (comics)|Raven]], as both of them specialize in magic and have a goth-like appearance.  Unlike Raven, she is very interested in fashion.

Jinx has made several appearances in ''[[Teen Titans Go!]]'', starting in issue #1.  In #26–27, hints are given of her later "turning over a new leaf" (like the hints in the episode "Lightspeed").  She also appeared in issue #34 as Kid Flash's girlfriend and became jealous when he began inadvertently flirting with Raven, [[Argent (comics)|Argent]], and several other females. She gets captured with the other heroines by [[Blackfire]] and she will be helping in issue #36.

Jinx is a [[boss (videogames)|boss]] in both ''[[Teen Titans (video game)|Teen Titans]]'' video games.
