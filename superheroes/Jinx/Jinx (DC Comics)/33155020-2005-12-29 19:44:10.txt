Art by [[Tom Raney]].]]'''Jinx''' is a [[fictional]] [[supervillain]] appearing in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]].  She was created by [[Marv Wolfman]] and [[Chuck Patton]], and first appeared in ''Tales of the Teen Titans'' #56 (August 1985), in which she joined the supervillian group, the [[Fearsome Five]], a frequent enemy of the [[Teen Titans]], [[Superman]] and the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]].  To date, her real name has not been revealed.
 
Jinx is an Indian elemental sorceress whose powers include the ability to command elements such as air, the manipulation of magical energy that she can manifest as offensive force bolts and green flame, the ability to dissolve matter, and create ground tremors. 

She first encountered the Fearsome Five when that group attacked a research facility belonging to [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] where Jinx and another criminal, [[Neutron (comics)|Neutron]] were being incarcerated.  The Five are defeated by the Teen Titans, but Jinx and Neutron decided to join the Fearsome Five.  Jinx remained with the group even after Neutron subsequently left it, but after their next appearance in ''[[Adventures of Superman]]'' #430 (July 1987), in which they fought Superman alongside new members [[Deuce and Charger]], the group disbanded, and Jinx was incarcerated in the [[metahuman]] [[prison]] on [[Alcatraz]], along with her teammates [[Mammoth (comics)|Mammoth]] and [[Gizmo (comics)|Gizmo]].

Later, in a storyline in ''[[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]'' #12 -15 (July-October 2004), frequent [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] archenemy [[Dr. Sivana]] freed Jinx, Mammoth and Gizmo from Alcatraz.  Having summoned teammate [[Psimon]] and having brought her teammate [[Shimmer (comics)|Shimmer]] back to life after she had been turned into glass and shattered, Sivana put the team to work for him in a scheme to [[short selling|short sell]] [[Lexcorp]] stock by having them steal its accounts from its corporate building in [[Metropolis]], and then driving down the stock by killing all the people in the building.  Sivana also had them destroy two other Lexcorp properties.  At the latter of the two, a [[microchip]] processor factory of Lexcorp's [[subsidiary]], Kellacor, the Five were confronted by the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]].  After escaping, the criminally unsophisticated Five urged Sivana to take Lexcorp's [[nuclear weapon|nuclear missle]] facility near [[Joshua Tree]], [[California]].  When Sivana refused, Psimon asserted that they would take it anyway, and in response, Sivana killed Gizmo with a laser blast to the head, and severed relations with the remaining four, warning them that he would kill them if they ever crossed his path again.  The Five decided to enact their plan to take the facility and fire a nuclear missile at [[Canada]], but were defeated by the Outsiders.  Mammoth was returned to the Alcatraz Island, but Jinx and the other members of the Five remain at large.

==Jinx in the ''Teen Titans'' Animated Series==
[[Image:JinxAnimated.jpg|thumb|The character as she appears in the [[Teen Titans (animated series)|''Teen Titans'' Animated Series]].]]Jinx appears in the [[Teen Titans (animated series)|''Teen Titans'' Animated Series]], voiced by [[Lauren Tom]].  In this incarnation, she is a [[H.I.V.E.]] student with [[Gizmo (comics)|Gizmo]] and [[Mammoth (comics)|Mammoth]]. Unlike her two partners in crime, she was completely redesigned from the comics, looking more like NiGHTS from the [[Sega Saturn]] game [[NiGHTS Into Dreams]].[http://www.sarcasm-hime.net/tt_jinx.jpg]  Her first mission with her best friends was to destroy the Titans. They managed to get the Titans out of their tower, but the Titans returned and defeated the evil teens.

Jinx was then in a series of bank robberies with Gizmo and Mammoth but the Titans planted a tracking device on her while they escaped and had [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] enter the H.I.V.E. as a student. Cyborg posed as ''Stone'' and befriended the villainous trio. Jinx and Stone had crushes on each other. Soon Cyborg's identity was revealed and he brought down the H.I.V.E. Academy. Jinx was a little hurt by this but escaped with her friends and formed The H.I.V.E. F.I.V.E. with Gizmo, Mammoth, [[Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series)#See-More|See-More]] and [[Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series)#Private H.I.V.E.|Private H.I.V.E.]] Jinx and the other members of the H.I.V.E. F.I.V.E. briefly engaged the Titans in combat during a raid on a shopping mall, but just as they were gaining the upper hand in the battle, the entity known as [[Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series)#Mother Mae-Eye|Mother Mae-Eye]] appeared and defeated them.

Jinx has most recently appeared as the de-facto leader of a slightly reorganized H.I.V.E. F.I.V.E. group, consisting of herself, Mammoth, Gizmo, See-More, [[Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series)#Billy Numerous|Billy Numerous]], and [[Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series)#Kid Wykkyd|Kid Wykkyd]] (when it was pointed out that the group now consists of six members, rather than five, the indignant teens' only response was that the original group name "sounds cooler").  Jinx was apparently the only member of this group who took her criminal career seriously, as the other members all displayed a serious lack of initiative and a remarkably short attention span.  This latest incarnation of the H.I.V.E. F.I.V.E. was foiled during a raid on a museum by the teenaged superhero [[Wally West|Kid Flash]], and in an attempt to improve the group's standing in the eyes of the [[Brotherhood of Evil]], Jinx attempted to capture Kid Flash and present him to the Brotherhood as a gift.  Jinx particularly hoped to win the approval and respect of [[Madame Rouge (comics)|Madame Rouge]], whom she idolized.  However, Kid Flash apparently took a liking to Jinx, and during all of their encounters, he alternately flirted with her and tried to convince her to renounce her life of crime.  Jinx was eventually successful in capturing Kid Flash (with See-More's assistance), but she quickly released him after Madame Rouge's constant string of insults and patronizing attitude became too much for her to bear.  Afterward, Jinx turned down an opportunity to join in a robbery with the other members of the H.I.V.E. F.I.V.E., and, wishing See-More goodbye, disappeared into the shadows; based on this behavior, it seems likely that Jinx is reconsidering her career as a villain, and it is uncertain which side she will be on should she ever make another appearance.

Jinx's powers are described as the ability to "bring bad luck" to her enemies; how she does this is never explored, though it may have something to do with the force of [[entropy]]. When she wants her enemies to be "unlucky" she fires waves of pink energy from her hands, often causing solid structures in her surroundings to break or fall on her opponents.  She attempted to get "lucky" powers in the fifth season episode "Lightspeed".  At times she may be seen as a counterpart to [[Raven (comics)|Raven]], as both of them specialize in magic. During her occupancy of Titans Tower with her teammates, she invaded Raven's room and tried on Raven's cloaks, sparking animosity between them.
