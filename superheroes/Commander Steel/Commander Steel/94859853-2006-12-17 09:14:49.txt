'''Commander Steel''' is the name of two [[fictional character]]s, both [[superhero]]es. The original one first appeared in ''Steel, The Indestructible Man'' #1 (1978), published by [[DC Comics]] and was created by [[Gerry Conway]] and [[Don Heck]]. His stories were set in [[World War II]]. The second character, created by [[Geoff Johns]], is set to debut in the new ''Justice Society of America'' series.

==Henry Heywood==
===Origins===
Henry Heywood enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps prior to their involvement in WW II, but was injured when saboteurs attacked his base spearheaded by the man who would become [[Baron Blitzkrieg]].  As a biology student under the tutelage of Doctor Gilbert Giles, his former professor performed extensive surgery on him with mechanized steel devices that facilitate normal human functions only on a superhuman level.  He adopted the persona '''Steel''', and started fighting fifth columnist saboteurs before being sent to Europe on secret missions.

Heywood soon allied himself with the [[All-Star Squadron]] and while in a field of war was later commissioned '''Commander Steel''' by [[President Roosevelt]]. He joined the Squadron for a brief period, until effects of the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' caused him to shift from his native [[DC Multiverse |Earth-Two]] to [[DC Multiverse |Earth-One]], wherein he retired from his superhero career as there were no active costumed heroes at that time on his new home.

===Steel II===
Years later, as a wealthy industrialist, he incorporated the same mechanized components into his grandson [[Steel (comics)#Hank Heywood, III|Hank Heywood, III]] - who later joined [[Justice League Detroit]] and fought Heywood along with his ally [[Mekanique]], former allies [[Justice Society of America]] and their descendants [[Infinity, Inc.]]. Although it was originally stated that Heywood performed unnecessary surgeries on his grandson, this was later [[retcon|retconned]] in ''Justice League of America'' #260 to state that if he hadn't made his grandson into Steel, "Hank would have been dead...  years ago."

===Eclipso===
After his grandson's death, Heywood resumed the mantle of Steel and died battling the supervillain [[Eclipso]], while a member of the [[Shadow Fighters (comics)|Shadow Fighters]]. He did come to a heroic end - detonating the Sunburst 300 (a device meant to destroy Eclipso) as his teammate [[Nemesis (DC Comics)#Tom Tresser|Nemesis]] escaped.

==Commander Steel II==
Relaunched ''Justice Society of America'' series will feature a second Commander Steel as a member. During an interview to [[Newsarama]], new series writer [[Geoff Johns]] said this will be a brand new character with new powers. He's set to debut in ''Justice Society of America'' #2.
