The two later characters called Steel are his grandsons.

==Publishing history==
Steel first appeared in his series set in 1939, Steel: The Indestructible Man, written by [[Captain America]] writer [[Gerry Conway]].

The World War II version of the character, Henry Heywood, enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps prior to their involvement in the war, but was injured when saboteurs attacked his base spearheaded by the man who would become [[Baron Blitzkrieg]]. Heywood had been a biology student under the tutelage of Doctor Gilbert Giles, and his former professor performed extensive surgery on him, enhancing his damaged body with mechanized steel devices that gave him superhuman strength, speed and durability.  At the request of Doctor Giles, Heywood kept his newfound gifts a secret, and was returned to service in a desk position.<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation  | last = Wallace | first = Dan | author-link = | contribution = Commander Steele | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 86  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = New York  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref> Frustrated at his inability to help more directly, Heywood adopted the masked-hero persona "Steel", and was attempting to steal armaments from the military base where the worked -- to send to those more directly in the war's fray -- when worked when some [[fifth column]]ist saboteurs broke into the base.

Heywood entered more directly into [[World War II]] as a secret weapon before he allied himself with the [[All-Star Squadron]]. In that time he was commissioned '''Commander Steel''' by <!-- Has this been retconned? -->[[Winston Churchill|British Prime Minister Winston Churchill]]<!-- I just checked in All-Star Squadron #8, and during an attempted assassination of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill Hank Heywood (Steel) leaped in front of the laser beam aimed at Churchill and prevented the assassination.

His membership in the Squadron was only for a brief period as ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' caused him to shift from his native [[DC Multiverse|Earth-Two]] to the Post-Crisis Earth, wherein he retired from his superhero career as there were no active costumed heroes at that time on his new home.

Years later, as a wealthy industrialist, he incorporated the same mechanized components into his grandson Hank Heywood III.

After his grandson's death, Heywood resumed the mantle of Commander Steel and died battling the supervillain [[Eclipso]], while a member of the [[Shadow Fighters (comics)|Shadow Fighters]]. He did come to a heroic end - detonating the Sunburst 300 (a device meant to destroy Eclipso) as his teammate [[Nemesis (DC Comics)#Tom Tresser|Nemesis]] escaped.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

The second Steel was the late '''Henry "Hank" Heywood III''', grandson to Commander Steel who, as a wealthy industrialist, incorporated the same mechanized components into his grandson much to his grandson's disapproval. Heywood III was a "[[Justice League#Detroit|Justice League Detroit]]" team member, and was mortally wounded in battle against an android belonging to one of the team's classic foes, [[Professor Ivo]].<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[J.

The relaunched ''Justice Society of America'' features another member of the Heywood family. During an interview to [[Newsarama]], new series writer [[Geoff Johns]] announced him as a brand new character with new powers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=79802 |title= Newsarama |accessdate= |work= |publisher= |date= }}</ref> He debuted in ''Justice Society of America'' #2 with the name of '''Nathan "Buckeye" Heywood'''.

Nathan is the grandson of Henry Heywood and cousin of Henry Heywood III. Formerly a football star at [[The Ohio State University]], Nathan retired after shattering his [[patella|kneecap]] and having his leg amputated due to an undiagnosed infection. The incident left Nathan addicted to [[painkillers]].

While attending a Heywood family reunion, he is attacked by the Fourth Reich, a team of metahuman [[Neo-Nazi]]s ordered by [[Vandal Savage]] to wipe out the bloodlines of [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] heroes. Despite the Fourth Reich's effort, they fail to completely destroy the Heywood bloodline, as both Nathan and a few children manage to survive. Both Nathan's brother and mother are turned to metal statues by the villain Reichsmark. Nathan jams his crutch into Reichsmark's mouth, causing him to spit liquid metal blood onto Nathan. [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Hawkman]] takes him to [[Doctor Mid-Nite#Pieter Cross|Dr. Mid-Nite]], who notes that the metal is being absorbed by Nathan's skin.

Later, it is revealed that the metal has grown out from where Nathan's amputated leg once was, forming metallic bone, muscles, and flesh. Waking in his hospital room, Nathan is shown to have superhuman strength. Dr. Mid-Nite informs Nathan that he is now a being of living steel, due to an unknown reaction to Reichsmark's blood. However, the steel tissues do not give Nathan tactile response, meaning he cannot feel textures or temperatures, nor gauge exerted pressures, and his weight has greatly increased causing his footsteps to crack the ground. He is given a costume, a "second skin" of a stainless steel alloy developed by Dr. Mid-Nite and [[Mister Terrific (Michael Holt)|Mr. Terrific]] specifically to restrict his movements and reduce his strength to a more manageable level. They chose the costume's colors because of Heywood's heritage. He then joins the Justice Society to defeat the Fourth Reich.<ref name="dc-ency"/> Afterwards, the press asks if he is the new Commander Steel but Nathan denies it saying that he is just an ordinary citizen, and so he is christened "Citizen Steel" by [[Power Girl]].<ref>{{Cite comic | writer =  | penciller =  | inker =  | story =  | title = Justice Society of America | volume =  | issue = 7 | date =  | publisher = [[DC Comics]] | location =  | page =  | panel = | id =}}</ref>

When the Third World survivor [[Gog (comics)|Gog]] appears, Nathan is one of the JSA members who sides with him, hoping that Gog can restore his sense of touch.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #19</ref> It is later revealed that Gog is rooting himself into the Earth, which would cause its destruction if he ever left, and when the unconverted JSAers battle him, they are blown away by winds created by Gog. Nathan alone is able to withstand the winds. Gog offers Nathan his greatest wishes fulfilled if he sides with him, but Nathan refuses, and joins the fight against him. For this act, Gog induces in Nathan excruciating pain.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #21</ref> Nathan then tears off his suit, and unleashes his full strength against Gog, actually managing to topple the giant, which gives Gog's former herald [[Lance (DC Comics)|Magog]] the chance to cut off his head and send him to the [[Source Wall]]. Following the defeat of Gog, Nathan realizes he feels a sense of satisfaction.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #22</ref>

Following Gog's defeat, Nathan takes time off from the JSA to be with his family. This consists of survivors of the attack on the reunion, various children, most of whom call him 'Uncle Nathan',<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #23</ref> or 'Uncle Nate' <ref> ''Justice Society of America'' (9) (), DC Comics </ref>.

==Powers==
Originally Commander Steel could only lift 1000 pounds but when he appeared in the pages of the ''[[All Star Squadron]]'' he was attributed 'super human' strength without an exact limit.  He was by no means as strong as [[Superman]] or [[Wonder Woman]] but he was able to hold his own with [[Robotman (comics)|Robotman]] and [[Baron Blitzkrieg]].

Citizen Steel's metallic body grants him superhuman strength, and allows him to take direct blows from opponents as powerful as [[Gog (comics)|Gog]], and remain standing, and in turn knocking him to the ground - the only one in the JSA able to do so. His alloy suit limits his strength to controllable levels but a cost of slowing him down. Upon removing his suit, he is able to unleash his full strength without a speed penalty. <ref>{{Cite comic | writer =  | penciller =  | inker =  | story =  | title = Justice Society of America | volume =  | issue = 15 | date =  | publisher = [[DC Comics]] | location =  | page =  | panel =  | id = }}</ref>.

*The Hank Heywood Steel appeared several times during [[Justice League Unlimited|Justice League Unlimited's]] three seasons, most notably during the [[series finale]], "Destroyer". In "Destroyer", he, [[Hawkgirl|Shayera]] and [[Atomic Skull]] were sent to help defeat [[Darkseid]]'s forces that were spread around the world. Shayera gets a spear stabbed into her wing, causing her weaken and collapse. As he is fighting, Commander Steel notices a parademon getting ready to attack the wounded Shayera. He grabs a shield and throws it [[Captain America]] style at the parademon, implying that it was possibly decapitated. Also in "Destroyer", he is seen running down the Metro Tower stairs with [[Vibe (comics)|Vibe]], [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]] and [[Gypsy (comics)|Gypsy]], the four characters created by [[Gerry Conway]]. <ref> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sap4fPgZzIc&feature=channel Commander Steel in "Destroyer." </ref> He was also seen in "Panic In The Sky", where he, [[Hank Hall|Hawk]] and [[Wildcat (comics)|Wildcat]] fought off several Ultimen clones, including a Longshadow clone.
