'''Hrimhari''' is a [[fictional character]] and part of the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He was first introduced in the ''[[New Mutants]] Special Edition'' #1.

A descendant of [[Fenrisulfr|Fenris]], Hrimhari is the Wolf Prince in the realm of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]]. He presides over all wolves in the enchanted woods of that land, but retains a humble and gentile demeanor not normally associated with that of royalty. He has the ability to change his form from that of a [[Gray Wolf]] to a shape more resembling a [[werewolf]] from lore. He is highly respected by the people of Asgard, and is said to be a true friend of [[Hogun|Hogun the Grim]].

When the New Mutants were magically sent to Asgard, [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]] met Hrimhari in a wood while being chased by giants. Immediately enchanted by her, Hrimhari saved Rahne and the two became almost inseparable. The god [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] managed to capture the two lovers and transformed them into more sinister versions of their werewolf forms under his servitude. Under these guises they were known as Grimfang and Bleakheart. They were eventually changed back to their original selves but were forced to be separated once Rahne returned to Earth.

After this the death goddess [[Hela (comics)|Hela]] tried to take over Asgard. Her plan was to use the Wolves of the forest as her scouts and spies. Hrimhari fought Hela's armies for his people's freedom but he was eventually captured and prisoned. Through the link [[Danielle Moonstar]] held with the [[Valkyrie]]s the New Mutants discovered Hela's plan and rescued Hrimhari. They attempted to warn [[Odin (comics)|Odin]] of Hela's plan but Odin's guards thought they were agents of Loki and sent them to the dungeons. [[Volstagg]]'s children managed to free them and they eventually joined in a huge battle against Hela's forces. When the battle had ended he was saddened to have to say goodbye to Rahne once again in her return to Earth.
