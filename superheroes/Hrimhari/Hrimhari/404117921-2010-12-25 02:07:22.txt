'''Hrimhari''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[comic book]] [[werewolf]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He was first introduced in the ''[[New Mutants]] Special Edition'' #1 (December 1985), and was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Art Adams]].

==Fictional character biography==
A descendant of the monstrous [[Fenris Wolf (comics)|Fenris]],<ref>''Thor Annual'' #12</ref> Hrimhari is the Wolf Prince in the realm of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]]. He presides over all wolves in the enchanted woods of that land, but retains a humble and gentle demeanor not normally associated with that of royalty. He has the ability to change his form from that of a [[Gray Wolf]] to a shape more resembling a [[werewolf]] from lore. He is highly respected by the people of Asgard, and is said to be a true friend of [[Hogun|Hogun the Grim]].

===Captured by Loki===
When the New Mutants were magically sent to Asgard, [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]] met Hrimhari in a wood while being chased by giants. Immediately enchanted by her, Hrimhari saves Rahne and the two became almost inseparable. Rahne has similar feelings but does not know how to deal with them, due to her strict upbringing.<ref>''New Mutants Special Edition'' #1</ref> The god [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] manages to capture the two lovers and transformed them into more sinister versions of their werewolf forms under his servitude. Under these guises they were known as Grimfang and Bleakheart. They are eventually changed back to their original selves but were forced to be separated once Rahne returned to Earth. Rahne had wanted to be with Hrimhari more but to do so would force the other X-Men and New Mutants to stay behind also.<ref>''X-Men Annual'' #9</ref>

===Fighting Hela===
After this the death goddess [[Hela (comics)|Hela]] tries to take over Asgard. Part of her plan to conquer Asgard and kill a then-helpless [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]] involved using the Wolves of the forest as her scouts and spies. Hrimhari fights Hela's armies for his people's freedom but he is eventually captured and prisoned. Through the link [[Danielle Moonstar]] held with the [[Valkyrie]]s the New Mutants discover Hela's plan and rescue Hrimhari.<ref>''New Mutants'' Vol 1 #80</ref> In the heat of battle and due to a mystical forcefield, Hrimhari was separated from the majority of the group, ending up with [[Tabitha Smith|Meltdown]] and [[Warlock (comics)|Warlock]].<ref>''New Mutants'' Vol 1 #81</ref> After some delays, the trio head straight for Odin's chambers, not understanding that he was under the much-needed Odinsleep; this is a process that would restore his energy and vitallity. They are soon captured by a guard and tossed in prison. With their powers, they could escape, but those they need to talk to, [[Balder (Marvel Comics)|Balder the Brave]] and the [[Warriors Three]] would be returning anyway from other lands. 

The children of [[Volstagg]], a member of the Warriors Three, appear at the cell's window, having eavesdropped on the current happenings. They know of Hrimhari, through the tales told by [[Hogun|Hogun the Grim]], their father's teammate. He, in turn, had heard of Volstagg's children through Hogun's tales himself. Understanding that the power of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], Balder and the others might not quite be enough, the children tell of the sorcerer [[Tiwaz]], who lives in Astrond at the edge of the icy wastes.<ref>''New Mutants'' Vol 1 #82</ref> The children agree to stay behind in Hrimhari's cell to emphasize the seriousness of the situation, for when the others do come back. Hrimhari and his friends travel to Tiwaz's home, battling several of Hela's bat-creatures along the way. They survive a crash and capture by the [[Frost Giants]] thanks to Tiwaz. He tells of much needed information about Hela's campaign.<ref>''New Mutants'' Vol 1 #83</ref> Tiwaz sends the trio on a mission; they free the [[Warriors Three]] from the dangerous Hive Trolls. Hrimhari recruits Ula, the queen of the trolls, to their side.<ref>''New Mutants'' Vol 1 #84</ref>

Hrimhari joins Balder, the trolls and the other forces gathered to battle Hela's army. He is injured in battle and is not present when the New Mutants save Odin from Hela's 'Deathsword', which was to be plunged into his sleeping form.<ref>''New Mutants'' Vol 1 #85</ref> The Warriors Three bring Hrimhari to the royal palace, where his wounds are cured by magic.<ref>''New Mutants'' Vol 1 #86</ref> He learns that Rahne must leave again.<ref>''New Mutants'' Vol 1 #87</ref>

===Back with Wolfsbane===
Later, Asgard suffers through the end of times, the [[Ragnarok]], with the destruction of all its inhabitants.<ref>''Thor'' Vol 2 #85</ref> Yet all return in one form or another. Hrimhari himself surprises Wolfsbane, meeting her in an Earth forest.<ref>''X-Force'' Vol. 3 #10</ref> Hrimhari subsequently reveals a new ability, being able to shapeshift into a human form. He claims that Midgard, Earth, is now a part of him.<ref>''X-Force'' Vol. 3 #13</ref> Hrimhari resumed his relationship with Rahne and consummated their relationship by making love before battling and killing Frost Giants.<ref>''X-Force'' Vol. 3 #21</ref> Rahne then fell into a coma soon afterwards and it has been revealed by [[Doctor Nemesis]] that she is pregnant with the Wolf Prince's child, which is neither human nor mutant and that the unborn child is threatening her health and her life.<ref>''X-Force'' Vol. 3 #22</ref> The Wolf Prince later made a deal with the Asgardian goddess of Death, Hela. Faced with a moral dilemma of who to save, his child or Rahne, he chooses the mutant healer [[Elixir (comics)|Elixir]] instead as he can heal both. She agreed and they returned to the Asgardian Underworld together. Hrimhari's final words to Rahne were that "he would somehow find his way back to Rahne and their unborn child." Revived, Elixir was able to heal Rahne. In doing so he realized that Rahne would not the survive the birth of the hybrid baby. Because of this Elixir transferred some of the baby's strength to Rahne. On [[Genosha]], Rahne demonstrated that her strength, durability, and senses have been further enhanced.<ref>''X-Force'' #23</ref>

A few months afterwards Wolfsbane had returned to X-Factor and let everybody believe that one-time lover [[Rictor]] was the father of her child. It is revealed that Hrimhari is now part of Hela's undead army. While X-Factor battled its way through the army in Niflhel, Hrimhari caught Rahne's scent on Rictor's boyfriend [[Shatterstar]], as he and Wolfsbane had fought only a short time ago. Hrimhari attacked him because he believed that Shatterstar had forced himself on her. During this fight he revealed that he was the father of Rahne's child. The fight between the two men was stopped by [[Siryn|Banshee]] who knocked Hrimhari out of the way with her sonic screem.<ref>''X-Factor'' #212</ref>

==Other versions==
===''What If?''===
Hrimhari appears in "What If" vol. 2 #12, in a story examining "What If the X-Men Stayed in Asgard." Rahne and Hrimhari marry and have multiple children. He is killed in a later battle.
