'''Crimson Curse''' is a [[fictional character]] who appeared in the [[Marvel Comics]]'s series ''[[A-Next]]''.

==History==
Daughter of [[Agatha Harkness]], the [[sorceress]] who trained [[Scarlet Witch]], young Aerika was a powerful [[witch]] herself.  She was invited to join the '''Dream Team''', a group of heroes who were going to become part of the new [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], '''A-Next'''. She donned a costume and an alias in honor of her "sister", the Scarlet Witch, and became the Crimson Curse.  As the Crimson Curse, Aerika used her [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] to affect the elements of nature, and strived to maintain harmony between herself and order of nature.  This led to her having a very level-headed and reserved attitude.  Her powers made her an invaluable ally against the many foes that they encountered.

But her biggest challenge was when she was sent to aid the original Avengers in a dark parallel reality. The [[Red Skull]]'s heir [[Doctor Doom]] was going to use his Cosmic Cube to send his own evil Avengers into her reality. Crimson Curse couldn't allow this and used her powers over nature to counteract the supernatural energies of the cube. She succeeded, but the price was her life. Her sacrifice was a shock to her teammates. But in the end, her death was avenged by A-Next, who defeated Doom and his minions.

==Powers==
An elemental witch, Crimson Curse was linked to the "Natural Order" and could use her magical powers to manipulate the elements of nature. Her [[Spell (paranormal)|spells]] could create massive winds to blow enemies away (or carry her upwards so she could fly), create waterspouts and miniature tidal waves, summon roots and vines to entangle her foes, control fire and flames, and even counteract non-natural energies.
