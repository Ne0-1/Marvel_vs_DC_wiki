'''Cassandra "Cassie" Sandsmark''', aka '''[[Wonder Girl]]''', is a [[DC Comics]] [[superheroine]]. She is the half-human daughter of [[Zeus]]. She first appeared in ''[[Wonder Woman]]'' vol. 2 #105 (January 1996), and was created by [[John Byrne]].

==Publication history==
Cassandra Sandsmark initially appears as a supporting cast member in ''[[Wonder Woman]].''  She later appears as part of an ensemble in ''[[Young Justice]]'' and ''[[Teen Titans]]''.  Without a series of her own, she has recently appeared in supporting roles in ''[[52 (comic book)|52]]'', ''[[Supergirl]]'', and the relaunched ''Wonder Woman'' series.  In September 2007, she appeared in the six-issue limited series ''Wonder Girl: Champion''<ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=116901 Wonder Girl is ready for her close-up]</ref> written by [[J. Torres]] and illustrated by Sanford Greene.

==Fictional character biography==
Cassandra is the second character to be called Wonder Girl; the first being [[Donna Troy]]. Cassandra is the daughter of Dr. Helena Sandsmark, (a noted archaeologist with whom Wonder Woman was working) and the [[Greek mythology|Greek god]] [[Zeus]].<ref name="ww105">''Wonder Woman'' v2 #105 [1996]</ref>  During a fight with a [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday clone]]<ref name="ww111">''Wonder Woman'' v2 #111 [1996]</ref> and another battle with Decay,<ref name="ww113">''Wonder Woman'' v2 #113 [1996]</ref> she created a costume and used magical acquirements (the sandals of [[Hermes]] and the gauntlet of [[Atlas]]) to help Wonder Woman, much to her mother's horror. Cassandra later had the opportunity to ask Zeus for a boon,<ref name="ww122-123">''Wonder Woman'' v2 #122-123 [1997]</ref> and requested real superpowers.  Zeus granted her request, but gave Dr. Sandsmark the ability to deactivate them.  Dr. Sandsmark, however, reluctantly accepted her daughter's wish to be a superheroine and rarely if ever uses this ability.

===Wonder Girl===
{{seealso|Young Justice}}
[[Image:WonderGirl III 01.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Wonder Girl and Young Justice.  Cover to ''Young Justice'' #47.  Art by [[Todd Nauck]].]]
Cassandra heavily idolized [[Donna Troy]], the original [[Wonder Girl]], and to that effect wore a black wig over her natural blonde hair (it also helped to conceal her identity). Donna gave Cassandra the second costume she wore as Wonder Girl, but Cassandra was afraid to wear it lest it were ruined (she did don the outfit during the "Sins of Youth" crossover when she was temporarily aged to adulthood).  She has been trained by [[Artemis of Bana-Mighdall|Artemis]], the former "stand-in" Wonder Woman.  As Wonder Girl, Cassandra joined [[Young Justice]]<ref name="yj4">''Young Justice'' #4 (1999)</ref> due to her crush on [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]].  She became close friends with [[Arrowette]], [[Secret (comics)|Secret]], and [[Empress (comics)|Empress]]. During her time with that group the dark god [[Titans of Myth (DC Comics)#Children of Cronus|Oblivion]] caused Wonder Woman's Wonder Dome palace to destroy Gateway City. Artemis ordered Cassandra to help with crowd control instead of wasting time putting on her Wonder Girl disguise. Agreeing with her, Cassandra revealed her secret identity before news cameras for the first time in her superhero career. Towards the end of the Young Justice series, Cassandra became the leader of the team, after beating Robin during an election for command.  Her secret identity was again publicly revealed when the second [[Silver Swan (character)|Silver Swan]] attacked her at her high school.

Young Justice was disbanded after the events of ''Graduation Day'',<ref name="t/yj">''Titans/Young Justice: Graduation Day'' (1999)</ref> a crossover with ''Titans''.  During these events, [[Optitron]] offered to fund both the Titans and Young Justice.  Donna Troy was killed by a rogue [[Superman]] android, leaving Cassandra shaken and causing both teams to disband.

===Teen Titans===

Cassandra later joined some former members of Young Justice in the newest incarnation of the Teen Titans.<ref name="tt1">''Teen Titans'' v3 #1 (2003)</ref> Early on, she was gifted with a lasso<ref name="tt2">''Teen Titans'' v3 #2 (2003)</ref> by [[Ares (DC Comics)|Ares]], the Greek god of war and frequent enemy of Wonder Woman and the Amazons. Despite appearing similar to Wonder Woman's lasso, Cassandra's expels Zeus's [[lightning]] when used in anger.<ref name="tt6">''Teen Titans'' v3 #6 (2003)</ref> Over the course of the series, Ares has often appeared to Wonder Girl, usually to warn her about "[[Infinite Crisis|the coming war]]."<ref name="tt2">''Teen Titans'' v3 #2 (2003)</ref><ref name="tt8">''Teen Titans'' v3 #8 (2003)</ref><ref name="tt15">''Teen Titans'' v3 #15 (2004)</ref> During her time with the Titans, Cassandra also developed a relationship with Superboy, whom she had harbored feelings through before and throughout ''Young Justice''.

In "[[Titans Tomorrow]],"<ref name="titanstomorrow">"[[Titans Tomorrow]]": ''Teen Titans'' v3 #17–19 (2005)</ref> the Titans are thrown ten years into their future, where they encountered the [[Titans Tomorrow|future versions of themselves.]]. In this future, Cassandra inherited the mantle of Wonder Woman after Diana was killed during "the Crisis." She is also referred to as "Ares' champion," and is married to Conner Kent (Superman).

It was also during her Titans membership that she was revealed to be Zeus' daughter, a fact both Zeus and her mother kept from her for most of her life. Cassandra was originally told by her mother that her biological father died. Wonder Woman knew about Cassandra's link to Zeus but chose to hide this from Cassandra as well at the request of Cassandra's mother. In "[[The Insiders (comics)|The Insiders ]]",<ref name="insiderstt">"The Insiders": ''Teen Titans'' v3 #24–25 (2005)</ref><ref name="insidersos">"The Insiders":''Outsiders'' v3 #24–25 (2005)</ref> she was beaten by Superboy as a result of his possession by [[Lex Luthor]]; though she recovered, Superboy secluded himself at the Kent farm in Smallville,<ref name="tt26">''Teen Titans'' v3 #26 (2005)</ref><ref name="ic1">''Infinite Crisis'' #1 (2005)</ref><ref name="sg2">''Supergirl'' #2 (2005)</ref> and there had seemed to be a strain on their relationship until the events of ''Infinite Crisis''.

===Infinite Crisis===
{{seealso|Infinite Crisis|Character changes during Infinite Crisis}}
[[Image:titans annual.jpg|200px|thumb|left|''Teen Titans Annual'' #1]]
During a battle against Brother Blood and a handful of zombie Titans, she acknowledged that her powers were fluctuating and sometimes disappearing altogether.<ref name="tt30-31">''Teen Titans'' v3 #30–31 (2005)</ref>  Despite this, Cassandra attempted to help Superboy after he was beaten to near-death by [[Superboy-Prime]]<ref name="ic4">''Infinite Crisis'' #4 (2006)</ref><ref>''Teen Titans'' v3 #32 (2006)</ref>  After saving him, Cassandra and the Titans infiltrated a [[Lexcorp]] laboratory to find a way to cure Superboy.<ref name="r146-47">''Robin'' #146–47 (2006)</ref>  While the other Titans flew to Blüdhaven following an attack from the Society, Cassandra remained at Titans Tower to watch over Superboy.  When he awoke, the pair of them reconnected and remembered their past in Young Justice, which seemed so much happier and easier.  Conner then took Cassandra to Smallville, and, afraid that it would be their last night together, [[Adolescent sexuality|consummated their relationship]].<ref name="ttannual">''Teen Titans Annual'' #1 (2006)</ref>

Ares again appears to her and informed that the reason behind her weakening power was Zeus taking back the powers he had granted to her as he left the mortal plane.  Ares then offered Cassandra some of his power in exchange for becoming his champion and acknowledging him as her brother.<ref name="tt33">''Teen Titans'' v3 #33</ref>  She joins Superboy and Nightwing up north, with powers returned, to assist in the assault on [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.|Alexander Luthor]]'s tower.  Superboy sacrificed his life to defeat Superboy-Prime and destroy the tower, and died in Cassandra's arms.<ref name="ic6">''Infinite Crisis'' #6 (2006)</ref>

===The Cult of Conner===
{{seealso|52 (comics)}}
Directly after Infinite Crisis, the Teen Titans fall apart.  Cassandra leaves the Titans during the year in which ''[[52 (comic book)|52]]'' takes place, following Robin's departure.  She feels abandoned by her best friends. Cassandra becomes involved in an [[online]] [[cult]] heavily influenced by [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonian]] culture.  She sets up an altar in Titans Tower with Kryptonian crystals and a gold figure with the Superman-insignia, which means "hope" in Kryptonian.  Soon, [[Ralph Dibny]] approaches her because someone defaced the grave of his wife Sue with an upside down 'S' Shield, which in Kryptonian means "resurrection."

About five days later, Cassandra and her fellow cult members meet with Ralph. Cassandra mentions that it was another member, [[Devem]], who led her to join. Cassandra explains that the goal of the cult is to resurrect Superboy.  As a test of their process, they intend to resurrect [[Sue Dibny]]. Cassandra and Ralph attend a ceremony designed to resurrect Sue, but Ralph grows suspicious and with the help of other superheroes, disrupts the ceremony, destroying the Kryptonite which was essential to the process. Cassandra leaves with Devem, blaming Ralph for destroying her chances to resurrect Superboy. After stopping Weather Wizard in Metropolis, Cassandra meets [[Booster Gold#52 and Supernova|Supernova]] and refers to him incorrectly as Kon-El, who actually turns out to be Booster Gold in disguise.

===One Year Later===
{{main|One Year Later}}
During "One Year Later", Wonder Girl is seen attempting to stop [[Gemini (DC Comics)|Gemini]] of the [[Brotherhood of Evil]] from escaping [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] with valuable technology, revealing that she had been following the Brotherhood for some time. She also sports a new costume influenced by that of the late Superboy. She is wearing a [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] Wonder Woman-themed [[t-shirt]] and [[denim]] [[jeans]] with black-heeled boots.<ref name="tt34">''Teen Titans'' v3 #34 (2006)</ref>

She 'temporarily' rejoins the team,<ref name="tt35">''Teen Titans'' v3 #35 (2006)</ref> under the suggestion of [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] so that they may combine their forces to defeat the [[Brotherhood of Evil]] (in truth, Cyborg is uncomfortable with the newest recruits to the Titans while he was comatose and wants Cassandra back so as to be an ally in order to expel wildchild [[Rose Wilson]] and novice hero [[Kid Devil]] from the team). After the combined efforts of the Teen Titans and Doom Patrol defeat the Brotherhood of Evil, she decides to rejoin the team permanently.  When she goes to tell Robin of her decision, she discovers his secretive and unsuccessful attempts to bring back Superboy. Though obsessed with having Connor back, Cassandra reacts in horror and in an attempt to quell Robin's anger at Cassandra, the two kiss.  The pair have yet to talk about the incident beyond coming to the agreement that it was a mistake, but they both have discussed it with others.<ref name="ww4">''Wonder Woman'' v4 #4 (2007)</ref><ref name="sg11">''Supergirl'' #11 [2007</ref><ref name="sg12">''Supergirl'' #12 (2007)</ref>  With her life in disarray, Cassandra has been having difficulty with her personal life, often having major confrontations with her mother. Cassandra has gained a new friendship with the recently returned Supergirl, [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Kara Zor-El]], who has shared with her in mourning the loss of Superboy and Paradise Island.<ref name="sg12">''Supergirl'' #10 (2006)</ref> 

Cassandra was also still very furious at Wonder Woman following the events of [[Infinite Crisis]], due to Cassandra's belief that Wonder Woman abandoned her after Connor's death, to play secret agent in a new civilian identity that Batman created for her after Infinite Crisis. She was also not pleased that Robin was aware of Diana's whereabouts during the year after Infinite Crisis and didn't inform Cassandra about it. Diana and Cassandra have not been able to discuss their past differences, leading to Cassandra to turn to Supergirl and the now resurrected Donna Troy instead for emotional support dealing with Connor's death. However it seems Cassandra has gotten over her anger towards Diana of late.

Following the resurrection of Jericho at the hands of Raven, Cassandra and Tim demand Raven use the same ceremony to resurrect Superboy. Raven angrily rejects their demand, due to the fact that Jericho's resurrection was a special circumstance scenerio where Jericho's soul was still on Earth, imprisoned inside of a computer disk. In the middle of this conversation, Cassandra is captured by [[Deathstroke]]'s villainous [[Titans East]] with [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Robin]] and [[Raven (comics)|Raven]] after an attack by [[Inertia (DC Comics)|Inertia]] and [[Match (DC Comics)|Match]].  Each member of Titans East has been recruited to negate a specific Titan.  Deathstroke selected Match, a Bizarro-type clone of Superboy, to counter Cassandra due to his strength and his warped visage as being a psychological edge against Cassandra.<ref name="tt43">''Teen Titans'' v3 #43 (2007)</ref>  

The Titans battle furiously against the Titans East, during which they are able to convince Batgirl and Duela Dent to switch sides.  Unfortunately the team is defeated by Slade's team a second, but thankfully Raven, Cyborg and Duela Dent manage to get aid from Nightwing, Donna Troy, Beast Boy and Flash (Bart Allen).  Together the two generations of Titans defeat Slade, who along with Inertia manages to escape. However, in the fall-out Tim and Cassandra shock their teammates by refusing to turn Match over the authorities and order Jericho to possess Match. While the move has allowed Jericho to regain his ability to speak while possessing Match, many have questioned the logical nature of this move, due to Match's dangerous nature as a villain and the fact that Cassandra herself seems to be uneasy around Match despite going along with Robin's latest attempt to create a replacement Superboy out of Match. 

In [[Countdown (DC Comics)|Countdown]], Cassandra attends [[Bart Allen]]'s funeral and she wants revenge.

Cassandra then becomes involved in the [[Amazons Attack]] DC Crossover. Supergirl and Cassandra discover friends and family have been placed in an internment camp due to their ties to the Amazons. After a failed attempt to aid them the two heroes agree to bring the U.S. President to [[Hippolyta (comics)|Queen Hippolyta]] in order to stop the war. They are ambushed by a group of Amazons in the process, which causes the President to become mortally wounded. Once U.S. citizens discover Cassandra's actions harmed the President, public outcry against Wonder Girl takes place. At the end of the series, Wonder Girl and Robin share another kiss. While they have not yet officially started dating, the pair seem more willing and comfortable in pursuing their budding romance. The question of the relationship between Tim Drake and Zoanne Brooks in ''Robin'' and the relationship of Cassandra Sandsmark and Tim Drake in ''Teen Titans'' is presently unknown.

Wonder Girl has recently appeared in a 6 issue self-title miniseries Written by [[J. Torres]]; Art and Covers by Sanford Greene and Nathan Massengill.  In this series, Cassandra attempts to make up for the mistakes made by the Amazons on her own.  However, as she attempts to apprehend a group of mystical beasts left over from the Amazon attack, she finds herself confronted by her half-brother [[Hercules (DC Comics)|Hercules]], who claims to want to help her become a 'true hero' and to rebuild Olympus. Cassandra, is of course reluctant to trust Hercules, considering his past history with Wonder Woman and the Amazons.  Hercules however is persistent, and chases after Cassandra, and changing his form in order to speak to her in assorted situations.  This accumulates to him taking on the form of Superboy, in order to make Cassandra believe that they could bring him back.  This enrages Cassandra, but also helps her come to realize that she has finally gotten past Conner's death.  Meanwhile, it appears that Hercules is working with [[Granny Goodness]]' [[Female Furies]].

==Powers and abilities==
*Cassandra originally received her powers from a number of mystical artifacts employed by [[Artemis of Bana-Mighdall|Artemis]] during her time as Wonder Woman.  These included the Gauntlet of [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] and the Sandals of [[Hermes]], which provided her with the powers of strength and flight/speed.<ref name="ww111">!</ref>
*She was eventually granted similar abilities by [[Zeus]] who granted "her fondest wish."<ref name="ww122-123" />  This gift message proves to be rather vague though, and Cassandra could arguably have access to more powers than what is already displayed (although it remains unclear whether she already had these abilities as a benefit of her divine heritage) and her powers still seem to be growing.  Discouraged by previously shown arrogance in his children ([[Ares (DC Comics)|Ares]] and [[Hercules (DC Comics)|Heracles]]), Zeus also blessed Cassandra's mother with the ability to take away her powers for a short time via a simple touch.  Shortly after joining the Teen Titans, Ares approached her and gave Cassandra her own magic lasso.<ref name="tt2">''Teen Titans'' v3 #2 (2003)</ref>  Unlike Wonder Woman's [[Lasso of Truth]], Cassandra's is a weapon which channels Zeus' lightning.<ref name="tt6">''Teen Titans'' v3 #6 (2003)</ref>
*When the Greek gods left the mortal plane as a result of ''Infinite Crisis'', Cassandra's powers slowly faded until disappearing altogether.  Ares stepped up and offered her some of his power, saying only that she would be "more powerful than [she's] ever been."  What this entails is not made entirely clear, though during the events of ''Infinite Crisis'', she appears to have retained all of her former abilities.<ref name="ic6">''Infinite Crisis'' #6 (2006)</ref><ref name="tt34">''Teen Titans'' v3 #34 (2006)</ref>
*In a storyline taking place "[[One Year Later]]", she is shown catching a falling [[Jet aircraft|jet]]. Afterwards she remarks that she didn't know she was that strong, which indicates that her physical strength is augmented.<ref name="tt40">''Teen Titans'' v3 #40 (2006)</ref> However soon after while trying to stop the military from detaining her mother, Cassandra found her powers fluctuating again at the whim of Ares who believed she was wasting her power on frivilous matters.

==Other media==
Almost all appearances of "Wonder Girl" in other media involve the [[Donna Troy]] version of the character.  However, in the [[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]] episode 'Paradise Lost', Wonder Woman rescues a young blonde girl named Cassandra, whom she refers to as "little sister".
