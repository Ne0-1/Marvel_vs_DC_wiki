'''The Web''' is a [[fictional character]], a superhero created by [[MLJ Comics]]' [[John Cassone]] as artist and an unknown writer in 1942.

==Details==
The Web's secret identity was that of '''John Raymond''', a college professor of [[criminology]], and mystery writer. Raymond's interest in studying the motives and behavior of criminals harked back to his youth, and the criminal leanings of his brother Tom. The Web debuted in issue #27 of ''[[Zip Comics]]'' in July [[1942]], having originally been intended for ''[[Top-Notch Comics]]'', the change occurring due to a decision to emphasize the humour of ''Top-Notch''. In that first issue, he rescues a woman named Rose Wayne from a Japanese terrorist named [[The Black Dragon of Death]]. Rose discovers his secret identity, and learns his motivation; the characters were later married, and The Web shortly retired from crimefighting and settled down into a domestic life. His last appearance in ''Zip'' was in issue #38, in July 1943, having appeared on several covers.

===Revival===
The Web came out of retirement in March [[1966]] in ''[[The Fly (Archie Comics)|Fly-Man]]'' #36, written by [[Jerry Siegel]] and drawn by [[Paul Reinman]] to combat the antics of an imposter. Soon - in ''[[Mighty Crusaders]]'' #4 (April 1966) - joining with [[The Fox (comics)|The Fox]] and [[Captain Flag]] to form [[The Ultra-Men]]. In ''[[Mighty Comics]]'' #40 (Nov. [[1966 in comics|1966]]), he is chastised by his wife, who no longer wanted him to be a superhero.<ref>[http://www.toonopedia.com/web.htm Don Markstein's ''Toonopedia'': "The Web"].

Despite this criticism, Raymond continues his crimefighting, while becoming increasingly [[hen-pecked]] domestically. His wife ultimately trains with [[The Fly (Archie)|Fly-Man]] and dons her own costume; as "Pow-Girl" (appearing in ''Mighty Comics'' #43) she fights crime alongside her husband, who is unaware of her real identity. The Web had several more issues' worth of appearances, before disappearing again.<ref>[http://www.mightycrusaders.net/handbook/web2.htm ''Mighty Crusaders.net'' page on "Web II"].

This first reappearance of the Web is often erroneously thought to be that of the original Web's son.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

===Later appearances===
In Archie's [[Red Circle Comics]] superhero revival of the 1980s, The Web made more appearances alongside the company's heroes. This Web is usually described as John Raymond Jr., the son of the original web.

In 2006, he appeared in a small [[cameo appearance]] in ''Archie and Friends'' #101, in the [[Katy Keene]] story. In 2007, he appeared again in the Katy Keene story in ''Archie and Friends'' #107.

[[DC Comics]]' upcoming 2009 revival of the Red Circle characters will include The Web.<ref>http://www.newsarama.com/comics/040929-JMS-Red-Cirlce.html</ref>

===2009 Revival===
After the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' and the ''[[Final Crisis]]'', despite the reinsurgence of a narrative multiverse, several super-hero characters acquired from MLJ and [[Milestone Media]] by DC Comics were folded into the new standard continuity of ''Earth-Zero''. The Red Circle Comics characters, aptly named ''The Red Circle'' were rebooted as well.
The new incarnation of '''John Raymond''' is a spoiled womanizer, fancying himself a [[socialite]]. No more a brilliant criminologist, brother of a criminal, he's now somewhat a slacker, having led a cushioned life of privileges, never applying in applying, barely passing through college between parties and booze, while his brother David distanced himself from his family, choosing to help the poorer as a social worker. Despite their differences, John always admired David, and when their father, on his death bed, willed John Raymond the heir of his fortune on the ground that the cold, privileged mindset of John could make him a better business man of the two, despite David having always been the best man, John desperately tried to prove him wrong.
So, while protecting his family heirloom by the countless kins of his late father, and keeping a profile as a spoiled socialite, he used part of his five billions worth fortune to set up a superpowered persona as '''The Web''', a ''common people'' superhero, this time deriving his name from the [[World Wide Web]]. Using an advanced supercomputer to select between the countless requests from help, he chooses to protect the people contacting him on his website ''summontheweb.com''.
Despite being accused, even as the The Web, to act as a glory hound, saving people in a sympathetic fashion to garner attention, he believes himself right, until usurers kidnap David. Failing to save him, he discovers with his dying breath that David had since fallen deep into the net of loan sharks, but was unwilling to ask for John's help out of fear to appear ''weak'' in his eyes. John, as The Web, decides than to change the focus of ''summontheweb.com'', refusing to help everyone having enough resources to help himself, or get help by his kins, and focusing over hopeless people, unable to get or even ask for help. <ref>''The Red Circle: The Web'' (2009)</ref> The first contractor of his ''new deal'' is ''Lieutenant Joseph Higgins'', stationed in Afghanistan and looking for his missing father. However, waiting for The Web reply, Higgins is grievously wounded while in a mission, and saved by an experimental warsuit: by the time The Web reviews email, and gives him a positive reply, Higgins has become [[Shield (Archie Comics)|The Shield]], superhero on his own and potential ally to his quest. <ref>''The Red Circle: The Shield'' (2009)</ref>

John eventually discovers that the man responsible for John's murder is a renowned scientist named Dr. Archer, who is using his knowledge of chemistry to creative addictive recreational drugs, which he then distributes through violent street gangs. Unable to hold off Archer and fight him actively alone, the Web resorts, like the previous [[Impact Comics]] character, to turn the Web identity into an organization of equally empowered crime fighters, a small army of ''Web Hosts'', receiving functional copies of his suit in exchange for enacting justice in his name<ref>''The Web'' (Vol. 3) #1-2</ref>. After a brief period of unrests and anarchy, [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]] and [[Stephanie Brown|Batgirl]] offer an upgrade to the ''Web Hosts'', in exchange for them pledging alliance to the [[Justice League of America]] rather than acting independently and thinning their number to expel the more rabunctious and rebellious members. The ''Web Hosts'' now receive their powers from a [[cloud computing]] server in the ''Web Lair'', making The Web able to shut their suits down remotely. Furthermore, every suit is fitted with an access to ''Twitterati'' (the DCU equivalent of [[Twitter]] featured into the ''Final Crisis: Dance'' miniseries), granting the Host a private [[social network]] to use for personal interactions and crimefighting as well, and John Raymond himself, as the current administrator, a permanent link to his ''Hosts'' and simple supporters (and a [[spyware]] implanted program to gain Oracle absolute control over the aptly named ''Interweb'').

With the help of his new hosts and his supporters The Web finally tracks down Dr. Archer, finally handing him down to the police with enough proofs to get him put on trial. However Alice, girlfriend of the late David, warns David of another hidden instigator behind Archer's actions, the mysterious ''Deuces Wilde''. <ref>''The Web'' (Vol. 3) #3</ref>


====Powers====
The DC Comics incarnation of The Web has no inherent superpowers, having in his '''John Raymond''' persona the strength of a man in his prime engaging in moderate physical exercises. Instead, he relies on an overtly technological suit, granting him several abilities, including but not limited to flight, bullet-proof armor, HUD interface connected to a GPS tracker and enhanced strength. However his most prized asset is his ''lair'', similar to the ''Batcave'' in containing his weaponry and a supercomputer, always connected to the website ''summontheweb.com'' and feeding him the data of people too desperate to get help from outside sources. <ref>''The Web'' (Vol. 3) #1</ref>

Unable to be effective alone, John Raymond has fully functional copies of his suit, with every single power of his original one, sent to willing followers of ''summontheweb.com'',<ref>''The Web'' (Vol. 3) #2</ref> along with an instruction manual and 120 days of [[tech support]], creating a super-hero [[franchise]] named the '''Web Hosts''' (obvious pun over the [[webhost]] concept, consistent with the image of The Web as an accessibile, [[Internet]]-savvy hero). When Oracle and Batgirl confronts him about his lack of control over the Hosts, John Raymond accepts to force upon them a stricter charter in exchange for upgrades provided by Oracle herself.

The current '''Web Hosts''' are now permanently connected to the '''Interwebs''', a [[Twitter]]ati-derived [[social network]], fully accessible from the suits, that constantly feeds in '''John Raymond''' administrator account and suit every shred of information the Hosts are willing to share about crime fighting, or simple socialization. As a programmed side-effect however everything The Web does is out on the display on the Interwebs, for everyone to view or comment upon. As a security measure, the Web Lair is upgraded with a [[cloud computing]] system linked to the Hosts, making Raymond able to remotely disable the Hosts Suits. <ref>''The Web'' (Vol. 3) #3</ref>
