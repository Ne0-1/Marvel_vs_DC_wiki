'''The Web''' is a [[fictional character]], a superhero created by [[MLJ Comics]]' [[John Cassone]] as artist and an unknown writer in 1942.

His secret identity was college professor of [[criminology]], '''John Raymond'''. He was interested in the field since his youth when his brother Tom engaged in criminal activity. He wanted to study the motives and behaviours of criminals.

He first appeared in issue #27 of ''[[Zip Comics]]'' in July [[1942]]. He was originally intended for ''[[Top-Notch Comics]]'' but was changed due to a decision to emphasize humour in the book. In the first issue he rescues a woman named Rose Wayne from a Japanese terrorist named [[The Black Dragon of Death]]. After she discovered his secret identity, John told Rose of his motivations for fighting crime and they were later married. The Web soon retired from crimefighting and settled down into a domestic life. His last appearance in ''Zip'' was in issue #38, in July 1943, having appeared on several covers.

His son appeared in March [[1966]] in ''[[The Fly (Archie Comics)|Fly-Man]]'' #36, written by [[Jerry Siegel]] and drawn by [[Paul Reinman]], taking up his father's name and costume. In April 1966, in ''[[Mighty Crusaders]]'' #4 he joined with [[The Fox (comics)|The Fox]] and [[Captain Flag]] to form [[The Ultra-Men]].

In November 1966, in ''[[Mighty Comics]]'' #40, as the cover feature, in which Rose had decided she no longer wanted him to be a superhero and chastised his efforts. After several more issues' appearances, he disappeared again.

In Archie's [[Red Circle Comics]] superhero revival of the 1980s, he made more appearances with the company's heroes, again with his wife's criticism.

In 2006, he appeared in a small [[cameo appearance]] in an issue of ''Archie and Friends'' #101, in the [[Katy Keene]] story. In 2007, he will appear in an issue of ''Archie and Friends'' #107, in the Katy Keene story.
