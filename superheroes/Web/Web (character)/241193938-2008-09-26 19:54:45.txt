'''The Web''' is a [[fictional character]], a superhero created by [[MLJ Comics]]' [[John Cassone]] as artist and an unknown writer in 1942.

==Details==
The Web's secret identity was that of '''John Raymond''', a college professor of [[criminology]], and mystery writer. Raymond's interest in studying the motives and behavior of criminals harked back to his youth, and the criminal leanings of his brother Tom. The Web debuted in issue #27 of ''[[Zip Comics]]'' in July [[1942]], having originally been intended for ''[[Top-Notch Comics]]'', the change occurring due to a decision to emphasize the humour of ''Top-Notch''. In that first issue, he rescues a woman named Rose Wayne from a Japanese terrorist named [[The Black Dragon of Death]]. Rose discovers his secret identity, and learns his motivation; the characters were later married, and The Web shortly retired from crimefighting and settled down into a domestic life. His last appearance in ''Zip'' was in issue #38, in July 1943, having appeared on several covers.

===Revival===
The Web came out of retirement in March [[1966]] in ''[[The Fly (Archie Comics)|Fly-Man]]'' #36, written by [[Jerry Siegel]] and drawn by [[Paul Reinman]] to combat the antics of an imposter. Soon - in ''[[Mighty Crusaders]]'' #4 (April 1966) - joining with [[The Fox (comics)|The Fox]] and [[Captain Flag]] to form [[The Ultra-Men]]. In ''[[Mighty Comics]]'' #40 (Nov. [[1966 in comics|1966]]), he is chastised by his wife, who no longer wanted him to be a superhero.<ref>[http://www.toonopedia.com/web.htm Don Markstein's ''Toonopedia'': "The Web"].

Despite this criticism, Raymond continues his crimefighting, while becoming increasingly [[hen-pecked]] domestically. His wife ultimately trains with [[The Fly (Archie)|Fly-Man]] and dons her own costume; as "Pow-Girl" (appearing in ''Mighty Comics'' #43) she fights crime alongside her husband, who is unaware of her real identity. The Web had several more issues' worth of appearances, before disappearing again.<ref>[http://www.mightycrusaders.net/handbook/web2.htm ''Mighty Crusaders.net'' page on "Web II"]. Accessed July 1, 2008</ref>

N.B. This first reappearance of the Web is often erroneously thought to be that of the original Web's son.

===Later appearances===
In Archie's [[Red Circle Comics]] superhero revival of the 1980s, The Web made more appearances alongside the company's heroes. This Web is usually described as John Redmond Jr., the son of the original web.

In 2006, he appeared in a small [[cameo appearance]] in an issue of ''Archie and Friends'' #101, in the [[Katy Keene]] story. In 2007, he will appear in an issue of ''Archie and Friends'' #107, in the Katy Keene story.
