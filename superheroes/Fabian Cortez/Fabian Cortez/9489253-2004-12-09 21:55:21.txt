'''Fabian Cortez''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]].  He was part of the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] (Also known as the acolytes). His ability was to enhance other mutants powers to extreme, and occasionally dangerous, limits. For example, if he enhanced a mutant whos powers were eye beams, like [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], the beam could level a mountain, but the recoil would kill him.
