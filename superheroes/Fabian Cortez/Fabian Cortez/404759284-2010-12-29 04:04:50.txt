'''Fabian Cortez''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[comic book]] [[supervillain]] from the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]] and an adversary of the [[X-Men]]. Created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and writer/illustrator [[Jim Lee]], he first appeared in ''[[X-Men, vol. 2|X-Men]]'' #1 ([[1991#October|October 1991]]).

==Fictional character biography==
===Acolytes===
Thought to be royalty from [[Spain]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}, Fabian Cortez organizes the original [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]], who pledge themselves to [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] and his cause, with Cortez goading and manipulating Magneto into combat with humanity and the [[X-Men]] at every turn, leading to the destruction of Magneto’s space-station, [[Asteroid M]], and the deaths of the other Acolytes, including Cortez’s own sister [[Anne-Marie Cortez|Anne Marie]].<ref>''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #1</ref>

Believing Magneto to be dead, and martyred for his cause, Cortez recruits a new group of Acolytes to follow him in Magneto’s name, now worshipping him as their god.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men 300</ref> They launch several strikes on humanity, ranging from attacks on a military base where new [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]] are being built, to slaughtering helpless humans in a hospital<ref>''X-Factor'' (vol 1) #92</ref>, but Magneto eventually resurfaced, sending his chosen heir [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]] to inform the Acolytes of Cortez’s betrayal. The Acolytes welcome Exodus as their new leader, and Cortez is left behind.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #304</ref>

===''[[Bloodties (comics)|Bloodties]]''===
Fearing Magneto’s wrath, Cortez flees to [[Genosha]]. Still claiming to speak in Magneto’s name, he incites the nation’s mutant population into starting a civil war against the humans, the world’s first instance of the long-threatened genetic war between man and mutant. With the aid of the mutates, Cortez kidnaps Magneto’s granddaughter [[Luna (comics)|Luna]], intending to use her as a shield to protect himself from Magneto, the X-Men, and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].  Cortez is unaware that Magneto had recently been [[mindwipe]]d by [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]], and Exodus comes to Genosha in his place, seemingly killing Cortez.{{Issue|date=January 2010}}

===Back with the Acolytes===
Cortez reappears months later, claiming to have been badly injured, yet not actually killed, despite all appearances. He manipulates [[Joseph (comics)|Joseph]] into posing as Magneto, pitting him against Exodus in an attempt to regain control of the Acolytes. Despite his scheme’s failure, he is allowed to return to the team. Months later, at a time when Exodus had briefly been imprisoned, the Acolytes split into two groups, each searching for Magneto. Cortez leads one group, but they abandon him during a battle with the X-Men, upon realising how he has been using them for his own purposes.{{Issue|date=January 2010}}

===Dark Seduction===
Alone again, Cortez is surprised to be recruited by Magneto himself, whom [[United Nations]] has given control of Genosha. Seeing as how Fabian Cortez had betrayed him earlier, Magneto only lets Fabian Cortez serve him on Genosha because his powers have been reduced and Cortez’s mutant power is to heighten the abilities of other mutants. After a further betrayal by Cortez, discovered by Magneto's [[UN]] advisor Alda Huxley to be the leader of the Genoshen cabinet assisting a rebellion in Carrion Cove, Magneto is restored to full power by one of the Genegineer’s machines and as he no longer needs Cortez, pulls him from a prison in Hammer Bay, Genosha fifty miles to Carrion Cove in less than 20 seconds. The impact kills Cortez instantly.{{Issue|date=January 2010}}

=== Necrosha ===
After the X-Men form [[Utopia]], Magneto joins them, saying he supports their efforts.{{Issue|date=January 2010}} [[Selene (comics)|Selene]] especially wants Magneto captured for his collaboration with Emma Frost to overthrow her from her position as Black Queen of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]. She has three of her recently resurrected mind-controlled soldiers—Acolytes Cortez, [[Marco Delgado|Delgado]], and [[Seamus Mellencamp|Mellencamp]]--go find Magneto. They try to torture [[Loa_%28comics%29|Loa]] to get the information out of her, but when she tries to hide in her room she finds [[Deadpool]] inside it. Deadpool battles the trio, but the techno-organic virus that is inside the Acolytes (which caused their resurrection) prevent him from killing them. At one point in the battle, Cortez grabs Loa by the throat and demands to know Magneto's location, saying that even though Selene wants Magneto alive he will fight the mind-control and kill him anyway. Loa begs Cortez not to make her hurt him, something Cortez doesn't believe possible. Deadpool knocks Loa out of Cortez's hands, but then is overpowered by the Acolytes. Loa uses her matter disruption powers to slide through Mellencamp, killing him. Deadpool, seeing that Loa's powers were able to slay Selene's minions, forces her to kill Cortez and Delgado too by throwing her into them (to survive, she has to slide through them, which causes them to crumble). Deadpool then tells [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] that he shouldn't be in trouble because Loa had done all the killing.<ref>''X-Force Annual'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Cortez possesses the ability to bolster another mutant’s power. He could enhance a mutant’s abilities to occasionally dangerous limits beyond their control (temporarily powering them up at the expense of burning out their bodies). In X-Men #1 (1991), while onboard Asteroid M, Magneto returned from a fight with the X-Men having suffered deep lacerations to his lower abdomen from Wolverine's claws. Cortez "healed" Magneto (As he said he had also done with his sister after an earlier battle) and temporarily brought him back to full health. This turned out to be "fake" healing in that Magneto needed to regularly be "healed" by Cortez to stay uninjured. Whether this was an offshoot of his main powers or that he was boosting their own natural healing abilities is not known. This ability was not used much or at all in his later history.

He was highly intelligent and an able military strategist. Cortez was also a skilled martial artist, and often carried a gun.

==Other versions==
===Marvel Zombies===
In an alternate reality ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'', Cortez is one of the survivors of a zombie-plague which bring humanity to a brink of extinction. Most of the Acolytes and a small group of humans survive as well; they all work together. <ref>"Marvel Zombies" #1-5 (2005)</ref> He lost the challenge of the leadership within the colony he established with Black Panther, and at some point he fathered a child, Malcolm. This child grows up to continue to challenge Black Panther for leadership of the colony. <ref>"Marvel Zombies 2"</ref>

===X-Men: Forever===
It is later revealed that shortly after the X-Men escaped the destruction of Asteroid M, Nick Fury enlists the X-Men in helping him find and capture Fabian Cortez. The X-Men successfully capture Cortez, though he nearly defeats them single-handedly. <ref>"X-Men: Forever" #1 (2009)</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
* Fabian Cortez first appears in the two-part ''[[X-Men Animated Series|X-Men]]'' episode “Sanctuary” voiced by [[Lawrence Bayne]]. As in the comics storyline, Cortez was the leader of the Acolytes and used his powers to bolster Magneto’s own abilities. However, Cortez’s extreme anti-human sentiments led him to betray Magneto and try to kill him, framing [[Professor X]], [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] and [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]], capturing and torturing the latter. Cortez threatened to destroy Earth but was stopped by the X-Men and [[Amelia Voght]], who revealed Cortez’s betrayal to the other Acolytes and the entire mutant population of Asteroid M. He was trapped in Asteroid M by a vengeful Magneto, but was rescued from its destruction by [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] and [[Deathbird]]. Apocalypse granted him the ability of altering the mutations of other mutants. Cortez then appeared in the final-season episode “The Fifth Horseman,” now turned into a servant and worshipper of his savior. Cortez assembled a cult worshipping Apocalypse as well as the [[Hounds (comics)|Hounds]], a foursome of altered mutants, in an attempt to find a new body for Apocalypse (who was defeated and left bodyless in “Beyond Good and Evil”). Cortez captured [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] and turned Beast into a feral monster but was stopped by [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]] (who was one of the Hounds). After being defeated, Cortez begged Apocalypse to be forgiven for his failure. However, Apocalypse was not angry and simply took possession of Cortez's body.
