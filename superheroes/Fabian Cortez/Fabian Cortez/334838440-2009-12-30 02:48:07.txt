'''Fabian Cortez''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[comic book]] [[supervillain]] from the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]] and an adversary of the [[X-Men]]. Created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and writer/illustrator [[Jim Lee]], he first appeared in ''[[X-Men, vol. 2|X-Men]]'' #1 ([[1991#October|October 1991]]).

==Fictional character biography==
===Acolytes===
Thought to be royalty from [[Spain]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}, Fabian Cortez organized the original [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]], who pledged themselves to [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] and his cause, with Cortez goading and manipulating Magneto into combat with humanity and the [[X-Men]] at every turn, leading to the destruction of Magneto’s space-station, [[Asteroid M]], and the deaths of the other Acolytes, including Cortez’s own sister [[Anne-Marie Cortez|Anne Marie]].{{issue}}

Believing Magneto to be dead, and martyred for his cause, Cortez recruited a new group of Acolytes to follow him in Magneto’s name, now worshipping him as their god. They launched several strikes on humanity, ranging from attacks on a military base where new [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]] were being built, to slaughtering helpless humans in a hospital, but Magneto eventually resurfaced, sending his chosen heir [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]] to inform the Acolytes of Cortez’s betrayal. The Acolytes welcomed Exodus as their new leader, and Cortez was left behind.{{issue}}

===Blood Ties===
Fearing Magneto’s wrath, Cortez fled to [[Genosha]]. Still claiming to speak in Magneto’s name, he incited the nation’s mutant population into starting a civil war against the humans, the world’s first instance of the long-threatened genetic war between man and mutant. With the aid of the mutates, Cortez kidnapped Magneto’s granddaughter [[Luna (comics)|Luna]], intending to use her as a shield to protect himself from Magneto, the X-Men, and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].  Cortez was unaware that Magneto had recently been [[mindwipe]]d by [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]], and Exodus came to Genosha in his place, seemingly killing Cortez.{{issue}}

===Back with the Acolytes===
Cortez reappeared months later, claiming to have been badly injured, yet not actually killed, despite all appearances. He manipulated [[Joseph (comics)|Joseph]] into posing as Magneto, pitting him against Exodus in an attempt to regain control of the Acolytes. Despite his scheme’s failure, he was allowed to return to the team. Months later, at a time when Exodus had briefly been imprisoned, the Acolytes split into two groups, each searching for Magneto. Cortez led one group, but they abandoned him during a battle with the X-Men, upon realising how he had been using them for his own purposes.{{issue}}

===Dark Seduction===
Alone again, Cortez was surprised to be recruited by Magneto himself, whom [[United Nations]] had given control of Genosha. Seeing as how Fabian Cortez had betrayed him earlier, Magneto had only let Fabian Cortez serve him on Genosha because his powers had been reduced and Cortez’s mutant power was to heighten the abilities of other mutants. After a further betrayal by Cortez, discovered by Magneto's [[UN]] advisor Alda Huxley to be the leader of the Genoshen cabinet assisting a rebellion in Carrion Cove, Magneto was restored to full power by one of the Genegineer’s machines and as he no longer needed Cortez, he pulled him from a prison in Hammer Bay, Genosha fifty miles to Carrion Cove in less than 20 seconds. The impact killed Cortez instantly.{{issue}}

=== Necrosha ===
After the X-Men formed [[Utopia]], Magneto joined them, saying he supported their efforts.{{issue}} [[Selene (comics)|Selene]] especially wanted Magneto captured for he had collaberated with Emma Frost to overthrow her from her position as Black Queen of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]. She had three of her recently ressurrected mind-controlled soldiers--Acolytes Cortez, [[Delgado]], and [[Mellencamp]]--go find Magneto. They tried to torture [[Loa]] to get the information out of her, but when she tried to hide in her room she found [[Deadpool]] inside it. Deadpool battled the trio, but the techno-organic virus that was inside the Acolytes (which caused their ressurrection) prevented him from killing them. At one point in the battle, Cortez grabbed Loa by the throat and demanded to know where Magneto was, saying that even though Selene wanted Magneto alive he would fight the mind-control and kill him anyway. Loa begged Cortez not to make her hurt him, something Cortez didn't believe was possible. Deadpool knocked Loa out of Cortez's hands, but then was overpowered by the Acolytes. Loa then used her matter disruption powers to slide through Mellencamp, killing him. Deadpool, seeing as Loa's powers were able to slay Selene's minions, forced her to kill Cortez and Delgado too by throwing her into them (to survive, she had to slide through them, which caused them to crumble). Deadpool then told [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] that he shouldn't be in trouble because Loa had done all the killing.{{issue}}

==Powers and abilities==
Cortez possesses the ability to bolster another mutant’s power. He could enhance a mutant’s abilities to occasionally dangerous limits beyond their control (temporarily powering them up at the expense of burning out their bodies).

He was highly intelligent and an able military strategist. Cortez was also a skilled martial artist, and often carried a gun.

==Other versions==
===Marvel Zombies===
In an alternate reality ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'', Cortez is one of the survivors of a zombie-plague which bring humanity to a brink of extinction. He lost the challenge of the leadership within the colony he established with Black Panther, and at some point he fathered a child, Malcolm. This child grows up to continue to challenge Black Panther for leadership of the colony.

===X-Men: Forever===
It is later revealed that shortly after the X-Men escaped the destruction of Asteroid M, Nick Fury enlists the X-Men in helping him find and capture Fabian Cortez. The X-Men successfully capture Cortez, though he nearly defeats them single-handedly.{{Issue|date=August 2009}}

==In other media==
===Television===
* Fabian Cortez first appears in the two-part ''[[X-Men Animated Series|X-Men]]'' episode “Sanctuary” voiced by [[Lawrence Bayne]]. As in the comics storyline, Cortez was the leader of the Acolytes and used his powers to bolster Magneto’s own abilities. However, Cortez’s extreme anti-human sentiments led him to betray Magneto and try to kill him, framing [[Professor X]], [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] and [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]], capturing and torturing the latter. Cortez threatened to destroy Earth but was stopped by the X-Men and [[Amelia Voght]], who revealed Cortez’s betrayal to the other Acolytes and the entire mutant population of Asteroid M. He was trapped in Asteroid M by a vengeful Magneto, but was rescued from its destruction by [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] and [[Deathbird]]. Apocalypse granted him the ability of altering the mutations of other mutants. Cortez then appeared in the final-season episode “The Fifth Horseman,” now turned into a servant and worshipper of his savior. Cortez assembled a cult worshipping Apocalypse as well as the [[Hounds (comics)|Hounds]], a foursome of altered mutants, in an attempt to find a new body for Apocalypse (who was defeated and left bodyless in “Beyond Good and Evil”). Cortez captured [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] and turned Beast into a feral monster but was stopped by [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]] (who was one of the Hounds). After being defeated, Cortez begged Apocalypse to be forgiven for his failure. However, Apocalypse was not angry and simply took possession of Cortez's body.
