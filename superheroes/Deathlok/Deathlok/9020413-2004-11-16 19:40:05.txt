'''Deathlok''' (also "The Demolisher") is a [[fictional character]], a [[cyborg]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The first Deathlok appeared in ''Astonishing Tales'' #25; there have been several subsequent characters to use the "Deathlok" identity.

* '''Col. Luther Manning''' was the "first" Deathlok, a cyborg in the post-apocalyptic future ("the future" being [[1985]] in his first appearance) who battled against an evil corporate and military regime. He encountered [[Spider-Man]] and [[Captain America]] in various time travel storylines; in the latter story, he was able to overthrow the megalomaniac who had taken over the [[USA]].
* '''Michael Collins''' was the first Deathlok to be created in the modern era; he was an [[African-American]] pacifist working for a cybernetics corporation whose brain was transplanted (against his will) into a robotic killing machine. Although his brain was intended to only serve as a medium for the robot's programming, he was able to assert his will over it and had a brief [[superhero]]ic career. This Deathlok's cyborg body first appeared in ''Marvel Comics Presents'' #62, and Collins' brain was placed in it in ''Deathlok'' (volume 1) #1.
* '''Jack Truman''' was an agent of the international espionage outfit [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] who was transformed into a cyborg to battle the [[Red Skull]].  He later swapped his minds into the body of another former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, '''Larry Young'''.  Truman is presumably living a normal human life in Young's body, while Young is presumably still trapped in the Deathlok body.
