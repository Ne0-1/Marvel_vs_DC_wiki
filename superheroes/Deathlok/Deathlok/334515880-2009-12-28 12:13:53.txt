'''Deathlok''' (also referred to as '''Deathlok the Demolisher''') is a [[fiction]]al [[cyborg]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He first appeared in ''[[Astonishing Tales]]'' #25 (Aug. [[1974 in comics|1974]]), and was created by [[Rich Buckler]] and [[Doug Moench]]. At least three subsequent Marvel characters have used the "Deathlok" identity since then.

==Publication history==
The first Deathlok series ran in the ''[[Astonishing Tales]]'' #25-36 (Aug. [[1974 in comics|1974]] - July [[1976 in comics|1976]]). This initial version of the character, Luther Manning, later guest-starred with [[Spider-Man]] in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #46 (June 1976) and the story from the cancelled ''Astonishing Tales'' feature was finished in ''[[Marvel Spotlight]]'' #33 (April 1977).

Deathlok subsequently appeared with the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], a member of the superhero team the [[Fantastic Four]]  in ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'' #27 & #54 (May [[1977 in comics|1977]] & Aug. [[1979 in comics|1979]]), although one appearance was actually a robot and not the genuine Deathlok. The Luther Manning Deathlok then appeared in ''[[Captain America]]'' #286-288 (Oct.-Dec. [[1983 in comics|1983]]).

A new Deathlok, Michael Collins, debuted in the [[limited series|miniseries]] ''Deathlok'' #1-4 (July-Oct. [[1990 in comics|1990]], reprinted as ''Deathlok Special'' #1-4 the following year). He was the second Deathlok to be created in the modern era and also the second to be created for the traditional [[Marvel Universe]]. This second Deathlok went on to a 34-issue series cover-dated July [[1991 in comics|1991]] to April [[1994 in comics|1994]], plus two [[annual publication|summer annuals]] in [[1992 in comics|1992]] and [[1993 in comics|1993]].

The third Deathlok, [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] espionage agent Jack Truman, debuted in an 11-issue [[limited series]] cover-dated Sept. [[1999 in comics|1999]] to June [[2000 in comics|2000]].

Deathlok has also appeared in four issues of the miniseries ''[[Beyond!]]'', and Michael Collins, in human form and not as Deathlok, appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #544-545 (May-June [[2007 in comics|2007]]). Multiple unnamed Deathlok units appear in ''[[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]'' vol. 4, #1-6. Possessing no human sentience, they were automatons created from corpses of soldiers killed in [[Iraq]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Luther Manning===
Colonel Luther Manning is an American soldier from [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], who, after being fatally injured, is reanimated in a post-apocalyptic future to find what remains of his dead body has been turned into the experimental Deathlok [[cyborg]] by Simon Ryker. He escapes from Ryker's control,<ref>''Astonishing Tales'' #25 (Aug. 1974)</ref> although he dreams he has regained his humanity.<ref>''Marvel Fanfare'' #4 (Sept. 1982)</ref> He battles the evil corporate and military regimes that have taken over the [[United States]], while simultaneously struggling not to lose his humanity.

He battles the [[Devil-Slayer]], but then battles demons alongside Devil-Slayer.<ref>''Marvel Spotlight'' #33 (April 1977)</ref> He later becomes controlled by [[Mentallo]] and the [[Fixer (comics)#Fixer/Techno|Fixer]] and is sent to assassinate the President, but is stopped by the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] and [[Nick Fury]].<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #26-27 (April-May 1977)</ref>  After his capture he becomes catatonic, and is taken to England for treatment by the Thing.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #28 (June 1977)</ref> He is cured by Louis Knort, and Nick Fury takes him into custody.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #54 (Aug. 1979)</ref>

Deathlok is rebuilt by [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon]] as a robot, and sent to sabotage [[Project Pegasus|Project: Pegasus]]. The robot battles the Thing and [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]], and self-destructs.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #54</ref> The real Deathlok, now working for the [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Brand Corporation]], battles [[Captain America]] and a time-traveling Luther Manning clone.  Alongside Captain America, Godwulf, and the Redeemers, he battles Hellinger.<ref>''Captain America'' #286-288</ref>

The Manning Deathlok eventually returns to his own time and overthrows the megalomaniac who had taken over the country. Manning remains in his near-future alternate reality, searching for a purpose in life and unable to disconnect himself from the machine bonded to him.

Eventually, Manning travels to the mainstream [[Marvel Universe]] and encounters [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] and the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]. He lives a life of solitude until being apprehended by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], from which he is later kidnapped by the supervillain [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]] and, immobilized, put up for auction as a weapon. Before a sale can be completed, he is stolen by the crimelord the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]], and sent on a [[kamikaze]] decoy run.

===John Kelly===
This version of Deathlok was originally controlled by Kelly until its systems determined that Kelly's brain function was detrimental to its completion of the "First Run" program. The Deathlok unit then completed its mission. Kellys brain was removed from the cyborg and disposed of. One Of Rykers assistants took the brain presumbly for use in the SIEGE unit. This version was made for the [[United States Army]] by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]'s Deathlok-program co-head, Harlan Ryker, after studying Luther Manning's cyborg body. The Kelly Deathlok later became known as the Michael Collins Deathlok [[Siege (character)|Siege]].<ref>Wright, Gregory; ''Deathlok'' vol. 2, #19 (Jan. 1993)</ref>

Kelly first appeared as Deathlok in ''Marvel Comics Presents'' #62.

===Michael Collins===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:DeathlokCollinsHead.jpg|thumb|Michael Collins as Deathlok.]] -->
Professor Michael Collins was born in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].  He was an [[African American]] pacifist and family man working for the [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon Oil]] cybernetics corporation Cybertek, whose brain was transplanted against his will into a robotic killing machine by agents of Harlan Ryker. The machine was used against rebels fighting against Roxxon's influence in the fictional South American country of Estrella.

Although his brain was intended to serve only as a medium for the robot's programming, he was able to assert his will over it (installing a "no-killing parameter" into its programming).<ref name=one>''Deathlok''  #1 (July 1990)</ref> The computer is fully willing to listen to Collins, though he must take care to present his orders in a way that helps fulfill the mission and keep people from dying. The computer is fully capable of understanding distinct concepts, such as bluffing, as when Collins is forced to pretend to take a hostage.

He met Jesus Badalamente, and helped the rebels as soon as he could, though of course they did not initially trust him. Roxxon utilized giant robot ants against Collins and his allies, though the robot's scanners were able to find weaknesses. The rebels soon came to trust Collins. The leader even tries to save Collins with his own dropped gun, though he learns it does not work for anyone but Collins. Collins also battles Mainframe.<ref>''Deathlok'' #2 (Aug. 1991)</ref>

Collins learns that his human body was still alive, and encounters [[Nick Fury]] and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]<ref>''Deathlok'' #3</ref> Harlan Ryker hides Collins's human body.  Collins aids Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D. in preventing a nuclear strike on the United States.<ref name=one />

With the [[Fantastic Four]], [[X-Men]], and [[Misty Knight]], Deathlok later battles Mechadoom.<ref>''Deathlok'' vol. 2, #2-5 (Aug.-Nov. 1991)</ref> He meets the [[Punisher]], and battles [[Silvermane (comics)|Silvermane]].<ref>''Deathlok'' vol. 2, #6-7 (Dec. 1991 - Jan. 1992)</ref> He next meets [[Moses Magnum]].<ref>''Deathlok'' vol. 2, #11 (May 1992)</ref> Collins finally reveals his existence as a cyborg to his family.<ref>''Deathlok'' vol. 2, #12 (June 1992)</ref>

Collins continues his brief [[superhero]]ic career as he desperately searched for his human body, hoping it still existed. During this time he fought [[Sleepwalker (comics)|Sleepwalker]],{{Issue|date=November 2009}} and helps [[Silver Sable]] retrieve a purloined Statue of Liberty.{{Issue|date=November 2009}} He assists a makeshift team of other heroes in the "[[Maximum Carnage]]" incident, protecting the people of New York from a mass-murdering group of supervillains.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}  Ultimately, Collins gained the ability to shift from his "Deathlok" body to human form at will.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

Later, the cosmic being [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]] (pretending to be the [[Beyonder]]) transported Collins to an [[Battleworld|alien planet]] where he was forced to live on for years until being rescued with the aid of several other heroes. However, his rescue required the sacrifice of Greg Willis, the superhero known as [[Gravity (comics)|Gravity]]. As an act of gratitude, Collins arranged Gravity's funeral.<ref>McDuffie, Dwayne ''[[Beyond!]]'' #s 2-6 (July-Dec. 2006)</ref>  When Willis' body was later stolen by a the cosmic entity known as Epoch, Collins enlisted the aid of the [[Fantastic Four]] in retrieving it.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

===Jack Truman/Larry Young===
Jack Truman was an agent of the international espionage outfit [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] who was transformed into a cyborg to battle the [[Red Skull]].  Through telepathic means, he eventually swapped his mind into the body of another former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, '''Larry Young'''. Young is being considered as a "potential recruit" for the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Initiative]] program.<ref>[[Anthony Flamini|Flamini, Anthony]] & Byrd, Ronald; ''Civil War: Battle Damage Report''; March 2007; Page 62</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2009}}
===Manning===
Contrary to popular belief and perhaps due to how Michael Collins was joined into the Deathlok cyborg, Luther Manning's brain was not transferred into another body, or cyborg.
Col Luther Manning's body was rebuilt into a cyborg body by Harlan Ryker. Deathlok's mechanical, cybernetic physiology granted him several superhuman powers including superhuman strength, stamina, agility, reflexes, and a computer augmented brain.  The right arm and left half of his face are armored cybernetic implants.  He wears a woven metal-mesh body suit of considerable durability. Deathlok also carried a helium-neon laser pistol designed by the U.S. Army of his time, and a throwing dagger.

Manning was a military academy graduate, and a brilliant military strategist. He is a formidable hand-to-hand combatant, and proficient with knives, daggers, handguns, and laser pistols.

He was later captured and upgraded by 616's S.H.I.E.L.D. and given jet boots that allowed him to leap at great heights and his other abilities were perhaps enhanced to greater levels.

===Collins===
Michael Collins' human brain was transplanted into a cyborg body by a group of scientists at Cybertek. His cyborg body grants him the same powers as Manning, only with much greater strength, speed, and resistance to injury. He possesses a broad spectrum of visual and auditory powers. Deathlok has the ability to interface with virtually any computer system. He is also able to project his consciousness and sensory projections directly into the Net, making him able to executing a kind of direct hacking of computer systems far more efficient than a traditional computer hacking. His body can also target (nearly infallibly) multiple objects and track them. He could scan the entire electromagnetic spectrum, as well as enter computer systems. He has learned to use internal nano-bots to repair and alter both his organic and inorganic parts, enabling him to appear as either a humanoid cyborg, or completely human.

He also has a very sophisticated A.I., capable of quickly making complex strategies and evaluating their chance of success. If requested, the A.I. can take control of the body to perform these operations. Collins himself possesses no combat skills, but under computer-guided combat routines, he is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant with an extensive database of combat techniques and strategies.

Collins is an excellent computer programmer with an advanced degree in computer science and prosthetics, and helped construct the Deathlok body, along with other Cybertek scientists including William Hansen, Ben Jacobs, Stanley Cross, Dr. Hu, and Jim Dworman.  After becoming Deathlok, Collins later modified his own systems.

Like Manning, Collins wears a woven metal-mesh body suit of considerable durability. He carries a plasma pistol which draws its energy from his internal power source. Thus, the weapon can only be fired if in contact with the outlets in Deathlok's hand. Deathlok also possesses a collapsible plasma rifle capable of greater firepower with the same limitations, a supply of fragmentation plasma grenades, and a molybdenum steel knife. He wears a wrist bracelet that allows Deathlok to override similar cybernetic operating systems, and an [[adamantium]]/[[vibranium]] alloy shock dampening helmet. He sometimes uses a refitted Cybertek Dragonfly fighter with a range of several hundred miles.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Deathlok===
In ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' #70 (Feb. 2005), the [[Ultimates]] fight a person they refer to as Luther Manning, who looks like Deathlok and whom [[Spider-Man]] describes as a "half-robot half-zombie guy". The superheroes take him into custody.
