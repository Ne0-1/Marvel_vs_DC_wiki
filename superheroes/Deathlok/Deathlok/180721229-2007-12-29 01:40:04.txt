'''Deathlok''' (sometimes also referred to as "Deathlok the Demolisher") is a [[fictional]] [[cyborg]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He first appeared in ''[[Astonishing Tales]]'' #25 (August 1974), and was created by [[Rich Buckler]] and [[Doug Moench]]. At least three subsequent Marvel characters have used the "Deathlok" identity since then.

==Publication history==
The first Deathlok series ran in the ''[[Astonishing Tales]]'' #25-36 (Aug. 1974 - July 1976). This initial version of the character, Luther Manning, later guest-starred with [[Spider-Man]] in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' vol. 1, #46 (June 1976). Deathlok subsequently appeared with the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], a member of the superhero team the [[Fantastic Four]]  in ''[[Marvel Two-In-One]]'' #27 & #54 (May 1977 & Aug. 1979), although one appearance was actually a robot and not the genuine Deathlok. The Luther Manning Deathlok then appeared in * ''[[Captain America]]'' #286-288 (Oct.-Dec. 1983).

A new Deathlok, Michael Collins, debuted in the [[miniseries]] ''Deathlok'' #1-4 (July-Oct. 1990, reprinted as ''Deathlok Special'' #1-4 the following year). He was the second Deathlok to be created in the modern era and also the second to be created for the traditional [[Marvel Universe]]. This second Deathlok went on to a 34-issue series cover-dated July 1991 to April 1994, plus two [[annual publication|summer annuals]] in 1992 and 1993.

The third Deathlok, [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] espionage agent Jack Truman, debuted in an 11-issue miniseries cover-dated Sept. 1999 to June 2000.

Deathlok has also appeared in four issues of the miniseries ''[[Beyond!]]'', and Michael Collins, in human form and not as Deathlok, appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #544-545 (May-June 2007). Multiple unnamed Deathlok units appear in ''[[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]'' vol. 4, #1-6. Possessing no human sentience, they were automatons created from corpses of soldiers killed in Iraq.

==Fictional character biography==
===Luther Manning===

Eventually, Manning travels to the mainstream [[Marvel Universe]] and encounters [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] and the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]. He lives a life of solitude until being apprehended by [[S.H.I.E.L.D]], from which he is later kidnapped by the supervillain [[Owl (comics)|Owl]] and, immobilized, put up for auction as a weapon. Before a sale can be completed, he is stolen by the crime lord the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]], and sent on a kamikaze decoy run.

===John Kelly===
This version was made for the [[U.S. Army]] by the [[C.I.A.]]'s Deathlok-program co-head, [[Harlan Ryker]], after studying Luther Manning's cyborg body. The Kelly Deathlok later became known as [[Siege (comics)|Siege]].<ref>Wright, Gregory; ''Deathlok'' vol. 2, #19 (Jan. 1993)</ref>

Kelly first appeared as Deathlok in ''Marvel Comics Presents'' #62. After his mind was later transferred into the Siege body, the brain of Michael Collins was placed in the Deathlok body.

===Michael Collins=== 
[[Image:DeathlokCollinsHead.jpg|thumb|Michael Collins as Deathlok.]]
Professor Michael Collins was born in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]].  He was an [[African-American]] pacifist and family man working for the [[Roxxon Oil]] cybernetics corporation Cybertek, whose brain was transplanted against his will into a robotic killing machine by agents of Harlan Ryker. The machine was used against rebels fighting against Roxxon's influence in the fictional South American country of Estrella.

Although his brain was intended to serve only as a medium for the robot's programming, he was able to assert his will over it (installing a "no-killing parameter" into its programming).<ref>''Deathlok Vol. 1 #1</ref> The computer is fully willing to listen to Collins, though he must take care to present his orders in a way that helps fulfill the mission and keep people from dying. The computer is fully capable of understanding distinct concepts, such as bluffing, as when Collins is forced to pretend to take a hostage.

He met Jesus Badalamente, and helped the rebels as soon as he could, though of course they did not initially trust him. Roxxon utilized giant robot ants against Collins and his allies, though the robot's scanners were able to find weaknesses. The rebels soon came to trust Collins. The leader even tries to save Collins with his own dropped gun, though he learns it does not work for anyone but Collins. Collins also battles Mainframe.<ref>''Deathlok Vol. 1 #2</ref>

Collins learns that his human body was still alive, and encounters [[Nick Fury]] and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]<ref>''Deathlok Vol. 1 #3</ref> Harlan Ryker hides Collins's human body.  Collins aids Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D. in preventing a nuclear strike on the United States.<ref>''Deathlok Vol. 1 #1</ref>

With the [[Fantastic Four]], [[X-Men]], and [[Misty Knight]], Deathlok later battles [[Mechadoom]].<ref>''Deathlok Vol. 2 #2-5</ref> He meets the [[Punisher]], and battles [[Silvermane (comics)|Silvermane]].<ref>''Deathlok Vol. 2 #6-7</ref> He next meets [[Moses Magnum]].<ref>''Deathlok Vol. 2 #11</ref> Collins finally reveals his existence as a cyborg to his family.<ref>''Deathlok Vol. 2 #12</ref>

Collins continues his brief [[superhero]]ic career as he desperately searched for his human body, hoping it still existed. During this time he fought [[Sleepwalker (comics)|Sleepwalker]] and helps [[Silver Sable]] retrieve a purloined Statue of Liberty. He assists a makeshift team of other heroes in the "[[Maximum Carnage]]" incident, protecting the people of New York from a mass-murdering group of supervillains.  Ultimately, Collins gained the ability to shift from his "Deathlok" body to human form at will. 

Collins was later transported to an alien planet where he was forced to live on for years until being rescued with the aid of several other heroes. However, his rescue required the sacrifice of Greg Willis, the superhero known as [[Gravity (comics)|Gravity]]. As a thank you, Collins arranged Gravity's funeral<ref>McDuffie, Dwayne ''[[Beyond!]]'' #s 2-6 (Jul-Dec 2006)</ref>. When Willis' body was later stolen by a living, alien planet known as Epoch, Collins enlisted the aid of the [[Fantastic Four]] in retrieving it.

===Jack Truman===
Jack Truman was an agent of the international espionage outfit [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] who was transformed into a cyborg to battle the [[Red Skull]].  Through telepathic means, he eventually swapped his mind into the body of another former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, '''Larry Young'''. Young is being considered as a "potential recruit" for the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Initiative]] program.<ref>[[Anthony Flamini|Flamini, Anthony]] & Byrd, Ronald; ''Civil War: Battle Damage Report''; March 2007; Page 62</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
===Manning===
Luther Manning's human brain was transplanted into a cyborg body by Harlan Ryker. Deathlok's mechanical, cybernetic physiology granted him several superhuman powers including superhuman strength, stamina, agility, reflexes, and a computer augmented brain.  The right arm and left half of his face are armored cybernetic implants.  He wears a woven metal-mesh body suit of considerable durability. Deathlok also carried a helium-neon laser pistol designed by the U.S. Army of his time, and a throwing dagger.

Maning was a military academy graduate, and a brilliant military strategist. He is a formidable hand-to-hand combatant, and proficient with knives, daggers, handguns, and laser pistols.

He was later captured and upgraded by 616's S.H.I.E.L.D. and given jet boots that allowed him to leap at great heights and his other abilities were perhaps enhanced to greater levels. 

===Collins===
Michael Collins' human brain was transplanted into a cyborg body by a group of scientists at Cybertek. His cyborg body grants him the same powers as Manning, only with much greater strength, speed, and resistance to injury. He possesses a broad spectrum of visual and auditory powers. Deathlok has the ability to interface with virtually any computer system. He is also able to project his consciousness and sensory projections directly into the Net, making him able to executing a kind of direct hacking of computer systems far more efficient than a traditional computer hacking. His body can also target (nearly infallibly) multiple objects and track them. He could scan the entire electromagnetic spectrum, as well as enter computer systems. He has learned to use internal nano-bots to repair and alter both his organic and inorganic parts, enabling him to appear as either a humanoid cyborg, or completely human.

He also has a very sophisticated A.I., capable of quickly making complex strategies and evaluating their chance of success. If requested, the A.I. can take control of the body to perform these operations. Collins himself possesses no combat skills, but under computer-guided combat routines, he is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant with an extensive database of combat techniques and strategies.

Collins is an excellent computer programmer with an advanced degree in computer science and prosthetics, and helped construct the Deathlok body, along with other Cybertek scientists including William Hansen, Ben Jacobs, Stanley Cross, Dr. Hu, and Jim Dworman.  After becoming Deathlok, Collins later modified his own systems.

Like Manning, Collins wears a woven metal-mesh body suit of considerable durability. He carries a plasma pistol which draws its energy from his internal power source. Thus, the weapon can only be fired if in contact with the outlets in Deathlok's hand. Deathlok also possesses a collapsible plasma rifle capable of greater firepower with the same limitations, a supply of fragmentation plasma grenades, and a molybdenum steel knife. He wears a wrist bracelet that allows Deathlok to override similar cybernetic operating systems, and an [[Adamantium (comics)|adamantium]]/[[vibranium]] alloy shock dampening helmet. He sometimes uses a refitted Cybertek Dragonfly fighter with a range of several hundred miles.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Deathlok===
In ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' #70 (Feb. 2005), the [[Ultimates]] fight a person they refer to as Luther Manning, who looks like Deathlok and whom [[Spider-Man]] describes as a "half-robot half-zombie guy". The superheroes take him into custody.
