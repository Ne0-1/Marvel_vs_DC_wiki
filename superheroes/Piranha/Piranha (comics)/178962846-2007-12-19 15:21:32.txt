'''Piranha''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]].

The Piranha was a normal piranha fish mutated by radiation into a semi-humanoid being with human intelligence.  The Piranha had superhuman strength, teeth that were strong and sharp enough to penetrate the [[Namor|Sub-Mariner]]'s skin, and the power to command other fish telekinetically.

The Piranha was created as a result of the experiments of Dr. [[Lemuel Dorcas]], having been exposed to remaining radiation from Dorcas's previous work.  After devouring Dorcas's deceased assistants and evolving from a normal fish into a humanoid fish, he ordered other fish into the radiation, creating more Men-Fish.  Piranha and his Men-Fish traveled to [[Hydro-Base]] in the hopes of researching more of Dorcas' work there.  They followed [[Namor]] and attacked him.  During the fight, Piranha was wounded, and his blood attracted his piranhas, which turned on him and devoured him.

These piranhas who ate the original Piranha evolved into identical versions of the original, eventually numbering in the hundreds.  They later captured Namor and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], forcing them to fight to the death.  The two combatants instead managed to crush the underwater stadium they fought in and crushed all the Piranhas.

The original Piranha eventually regenerated, and joined the team [[Deep Six (Marvel Comics)|Deep Six]] while [[Attuma]] had seized the throne of [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlantis]].  Deep Six defended Attuma's throne from the invading Prince Namor and the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] twice, but lost to the Defenders the second time.
