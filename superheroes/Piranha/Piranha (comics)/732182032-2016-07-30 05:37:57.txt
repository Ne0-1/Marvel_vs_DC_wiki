'''Piranha''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]].

==Fictional character biography==
The Piranha was created as a result of the experiments of Dr. [[Lemuel Dorcas]], having been exposed to remaining radiation from Dorcas's previous work.  After devouring Dorcas's deceased assistants and evolving from a normal fish into a humanoid fish, he ordered other fish into the radiation, creating more Men-Fish.  Piranha and his Men-Fish traveled to [[Hydro-Base]] in the hopes of researching more of Dorcas' work there.  They followed [[Namor]] and attacked him.  During the fight, Piranha was wounded, and his blood attracted his piranhas, which turned on him and devoured him.<ref>''Sub-Mariner'' #71 (May, 1974)</ref>

These piranhas who ate the original Piranha evolved into identical versions of the original, eventually numbering in the hundreds.  They later captured Namor and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], forcing them to fight to the death.  The two combatants instead managed to crush the underwater stadium they fought in and crushed all the Piranhas.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

The original Piranha eventually regenerated, and joined the team [[Deep Six (Marvel Comics)|Deep Six]] while [[Attuma]] had seized the throne of [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlantis]].  Deep Six defended Attuma's throne from the invading Prince Namor and the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] twice, but lost to the Defenders the second time.<ref>''Defenders'' vol. 2 #7 (September, 2001)</ref>

===Marvel Zombies===
After ''[[Marvel Zombies 3]]'', the zombie [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]]'s head was teleported to the bottom of the ocean along with the [[Zombie (comics)|Zombie]] (Simon Garth). The Deadpool head infected Piranha and all of the Men-Fish with the zombie plague. When the Men-Fish attacked a cruise ship, the new [[Midnight Sons]] arrived and destroyed them. As the Midnight Sons explored the ship, the now zombified Piranha attacked them.<ref>''Marvel Zombies 4'' #1</ref> [[Daimon Hellstrom]] causes the ship to explode, destroying all the Men-Fish; Piranha's fate is not shown.<ref>''Marvel Zombies 4'' #2</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Piranha was a normal piranha fish mutated by radiation into a semi-humanoid being with human intelligence.  The Piranha had superhuman strength, teeth that were strong and sharp enough to penetrate the [[Namor|Sub-Mariner]]'s skin, and the power to command other fish telepathically.
