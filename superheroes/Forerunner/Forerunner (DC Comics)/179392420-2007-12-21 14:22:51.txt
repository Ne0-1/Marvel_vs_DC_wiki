'''Forerunner''' is a [[fictional]] [[character]] published by [[DC Comics]]. She first appeared in ''[[Countdown (DC Comics)|Countdown]]'' #46 (August 2007), and was created by [[Jimmy Palmiotti]], Justin Gray and Jesus Saiz.


==Fictional character biography==
Viza Aziv's [[origin story]] as well as the history of her race is relayed in the pages of ''Countdown to Adventure'' #1, her first appearance outside the main ''Countdown'' series. The Forerunners' planet is the Earth of [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#The 52|an alternate universe]], ravaged after years of destructive war between humans and other planets in the solar system which ended their race. The other "Nine Houses" ([[planet]]s and [[dwarf planet]]s) of the [[Solar System]] declared the planet "War World" where they would battle for occupancy. Survivors of the wars - the strongest and fittest - remained on the planet and interbred, unknowingly coerced by [[the Monitors (comics)|the Monitors]] and forming the Forerunners, a species possessing traits of the other planets such as those of [[Martian Manhunter|Green Martians]] and [[Jemm|Saturnians]]. When the Nine Houses decided that the Forerunners were a threat that needed to be eliminated, the Monitors intervened and formed a pact with the Nine Houses 20 generations before Viza's birth: The Monitors would keep the Forerunners from moving against the Nine Houses, which would allow the Monitors to appoint one Forerunner as the Monitors' "Instrument of Righteous Death" called [[Harbinger (DC Comics)|Harbinger]].

Viza the Forerunner is a member of a genetically engineered race of warriors tasked with serving the Monitors. Viza Aziv was assigned by a Monitor to kill specific anomalies inhabiting the Multiverse.  In her first appearance she  battled [[Jason Todd]] and [[Donna Troy]] during their investigation into the death of [[Duela Dent]], the Joker's Daughter.  After failing in her mission she was denounced by one of the Monitors and suffered a crisis of confidence.  Vowing to stay on Earth until she regained the trust of the Monitors, the Forerunner was later contacted by the superhero [[Captain Atom]] (now called [[Monarch (comics)|Monarch]]) who was successful in recruiting her to aid him in his plans, granting her an entire [[Bleed (comics)|Bleed]]-based armada to bring in battle against the Monitors. He accused the Monitors of having employed their other Harbinger, [[Dark Angel (DC Comics)|Dark Angel]] as well as Shadow Demons to wipe the Forerunner race from Earth-48.<ref>http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=117857</ref>

===Countdown to Adventure===
{{main|Countdown to Final Crisis}}

Viza Aziv appears in the Countdown spin-off called ''Countdown to Adventure''. In #1, Monarch and Viza discuss her history and that of her race. Monarch discloses that she was chosen as the Monitors' warrior because he believes they feared something in her specifically; she was an unexpected outcome of the breeding program which created the Forerunners. Forerunner is sent by Monarch to recruit the JLAxis of Earth-10 and the Conjurers of Earth-33. Unfortunately, the Conjurers were forewarned of Viza's arrival by Dark Angel, disguised as an [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]], and she is captured. Dark Angel reveals herself, killing some of the mages, until Forerunner strikes her down. Dark Angel manages to escape, and Monarch arrives to try and recruit to mages. Forerunner rebukes him, saying they have suffered enough. When they return to the Bleed, Monarch attacks Forerunner for usurping his authority in front of others. She attempts to fight him, but the explosive threat from damaging Monarch's suit convinces her to stop. After briefly training some troops in the way of combat, and being propositioned by Earth-10's Nazi [[Batman]], Monarch approaches Forerunner and tells her that the [[Countdown: Arena|Arena]] tournament is about to begin, and that he doesn't need her anymore. He then teleports her to an unknown area of space.

==Powers and abilities==
* Viza Aziv possesses superhuman speed, strength, and resistance to injury. She was able to resist gunfire from an automatic rifle and is tough enough that Donna Troy was injured simply by punching her.
* She possesses telepathy and the ability to become temporarily invisible - from her Martian ancestry.
* She has also been seen throwing some sort of metal spikes at enemies, but it is not clear if this is a weapon or a special power.  
* At this point it is unclear if some of Viza Aziv's abilities are typical of her race, although evidence seems to suggest so.  
* The blue pigment of Forerunner skin resembles aliens from the Talokian star system such as [[Lyssa Drak]], [[Starman (comics)#Mikaal Tomas|Mikaal Tomas]], [[Shadow Lass]] etc.
* In addition all members of her race have a genetic fail safe which prevents them from attacking Monitors.
