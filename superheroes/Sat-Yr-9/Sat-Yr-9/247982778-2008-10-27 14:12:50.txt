===Dictator===

Opul Lun Sat-Yr-9 was a [[dictator]] who ruled Earth-794 with her lover [[Kaptain Briton]]. When he fled from her, traveling to [[Earth-616]] where he knew he had an identical looking counterpart, [[Earth-616]]'s [[Captain Britain]], she sent armored troops to retrieve him. They mistakenly attacked Captain Britain twice, but were repeled on each occasion, the first time by Britain and his ally [[Meggan]], the second by Britain's sister [[Psylocke|Betsy]]. Sat-Yr-9 next hired the interdimensional mercenary group, the [[Technet (comics)|Technet]], but Briton swapped places with Britain, and the Technet took the wrong man back to Earth-794. Britain later convinced the Technet of their error, but Sat-Yr-9 tried to stop them departing with him; the Technet slaughtered her soldiers, and the already psychotic Sat-Yr-9 became completely unhinged. After they departed, she started slaughtering her subjects, leading [[Roma (comics)|Roma]] to send [[Captain UK]] on a mission to overthrow and imprison her.

While Britain was on Earth-794, Briton was killed by Betsy when he tried to rape her.

===Courtney Ross===

Escaping to Earth-616 through a dimension gateway that had been opened by [[Widget (comics)|Widget]] for an unassuming civilian on Earth-616, Sat-Yr-9 killed her alternate reality counterpart, a businesswoman named [[Courtney Ross]], and took her place. An example of interdimensional similarities, Ross was Captain Britain's ex-girlfriend. As Ross, she tried to create a rift between Captain Britain and his current girlfriend [[Meggan]].

Sat-Yr-9 also knew about [[Jamie Braddock]]'s reality warping powers before anyone else including himself did (since she knew about the reality warping powers of Jamie's alternate reality counterpart in her timeline of origin), hiring the Technet through a proxy, Nigel Frobisher, to rescue the imprisoned Earth-616 Jamie, intending to use his great powers as a living weapon against difficult adversaries.

She used Jamie's powers to change Frobisher into a duplicate of the London Crime [[Vixen (Marvel Comics)|Vixen]], while changing Vixen herself into a fox. With Frobisher as Vixen, Sat-Yr-9 took over the Vixen's crime syndicate. 

With her powerbase built, she attacked [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]], revealing her true identity to them. She tried to enslave Captain Britain, against Frobisher's advice. Frobisher rebelled and was killed by her. Excalibur managed to defeat Jamie, and Sat-Yr-9 and her troops were forced to flee. Captain Britain swore to avenge Courtney's death, but was unable to track Sat-Yr-9 down.

===Hellfire===
As of late, she has joined the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] as its White Queen, with [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]], a former HYDRA assassin, as her self-proclaimed "White Princess" and bodyguard. She has been seen publicly appearing as Courtney Ross again, trying to convince Captain Britain that she somehow is the real Courtney Ross. So far Captain Britain remains unconvinced, but hasn't moved against her.

==Notes==
*Along with Courtney Ross, Sat-Yr-9 has another alternate reality counterpart; [[Saturnyne]], the Omniversal Majestrix of [[Otherworld (Marvel Comics)|Otherworld]] and a servant of Roma. 
*An alternate version of Sat-Yr-9 appears in ''[[Paradise X]]: Heralds'', where she displays the power to control men through pheromones. The regular Sat-Yr-9 never displayed this ability. This version is called Saturnyne, despite her appearance being that of Sat-Yr-9.
*Sat-Yr-9 can be distinguished visually from her alternate reality counterparts by a [[tattoo]] of her stylized knife emblem on her right thigh.
