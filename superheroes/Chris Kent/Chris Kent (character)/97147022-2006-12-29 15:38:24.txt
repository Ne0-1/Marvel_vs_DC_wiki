'''Chris Kent''' is a fictional [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonian]] in the [[DC Comics]] universe, who first appeared in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #844 by [[Richard Donner]], [[Geoff Johns]], and [[Adam Kubert]].

==Character history==
{{spoilers}}
When a spacecraft headed towards [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], it is diverted to a relatively safe landing by [[Superman]].  After it's crash, Superman is surprised to discover a young boy.  Echoing his own arrival in his youth, the boy is completely unharmed.  He is taken to the east coast lab of the Department of Metahuman Affairs for observation.

The boy exhibits super-human strength and can only speak Kryptonese.  He does not know his name or where he is from.  As with [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]], Superman instinctively knows the boy is Kryptonian before the tests are complete.  After he is confirmed as a Kryptonian, he is immediately taken to the Department of Metahuman Affairs headquarters in [[Washington, D.C.]] without informing Superman.  He removes the boy from their [[custody]], and he decides, with [[Lois Lane]], to raise the boy as '''Christopher Kent'''.

Afterwards, Superman holds a press conference to inform the world that he is under his care.  At this time, [[Bizarro]], sent by [[Lex Luthor]], attacks in an attempt to [[kidnap]] Chris, but he fails.  Later, it is revealed that Chris is the son of [[General Zod]] and [[Ursa (comics)|Ursa]]. His arrival released [[General Zod]], [[Non (DC comics)|Non]], and [[Ursa (comics)|Ursa]] from the [[Phantom Zone]]. 

==Powers and abilities==
Chris Kent is a Kryptonian and will develop [[Powers and abilities of Superman|Superman's powers]].  However, he has only exhibited several Kryptonian abilities:

*'''Flight:''' He flies in the [[Fortress of Solitude]], and at the Kent farm.
*'''Invulnerability:'''  He arrives on Earth unharmed, and a bus falls him during the Bizarro attack.
*'''Super strength:'''  He is able to left a television in the Metahuman Affairs lab.
