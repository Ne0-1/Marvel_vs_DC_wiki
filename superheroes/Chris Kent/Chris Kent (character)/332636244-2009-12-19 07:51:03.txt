'''Christopher Kent''' ('''Lor-Zod''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonian]] in the {{DC Universe}}, who first appeared in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #844 (2006), the first part of the ''Action Comics'' story arc "[[Superman: Last Son]]". He was created by [[Richard Donner]] and [[Geoff Johns]]. Currently, this character has assumed the role of '''[[Nightwing]]''' after abnormal spurts of aging due to his birth in the Phantom Zone.

==Fictional character biography==<!-- W:MOS -->
===Arrival on Earth===
When a spacecraft fell towards [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], it was diverted to a relatively safe landing by [[Superman]]. After its landing, Superman was very surprised to discover a young boy inside. Echoing his own arrival in his youth years before, Superman saw that the boy was completely unharmed. The Kryptonese writings on his ship stated that his Kryptonian name was "Lor-Zod", which was later confirmed in ''Action Comics'' #851. He was taken to the east coast lab of the Department of Metahuman Affairs for observation.

The boy exhibited super-human strength and could only speak [[Kryptonese]]. He did not know his name or where he came from.  As with [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]], Superman instinctively knew the boy was Kryptonian before the tests were completed. After he was confirmed as a Kryptonian, he was immediately taken to the Department of [[Metahuman]] Affairs headquarters in [[Washington, D.C.]] without informing Superman. He removed the boy from their [[Child custody|custody]], and he decided, with [[Lois Lane]], to raise the boy <ref name="ac844">''Action Comics'' #844 (2006)</ref>. Clark then contacted [[Batman]], who used his resources to create the identity '''Christopher Kent'''. The name is a tribute to [[Christopher Reeve]].

Chris remained in the custody of Lois and Clark as their foster son. He attended the Ellsworth School, an elite private school,<ref name="sm664">''Superman'' #664 (2007)''</ref> where he had some trouble concealing his powers, particularly during P.E. To aid him, Superman worked with Batman to develop an implant, concealed within a wristwatch, that used red sun radiation to block Chris' powers while in school until he learned how to control them.  While the watch was being created, Chris made friends with [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Tim Drake]], the current Robin, who treated him like a younger brother and offered to show him some gymnastics.<ref name="sm668">''Superman'' #668 (2007)''</ref>  Eventually, the wristwatch failed, due to it being calibrated on the metabolism of an adult Kryptonian, and the built-up energies exploded, wrecking Clark and Lois' apartment. Clark reassured the young boy that he wouldn't be sent away, and that they would find a way to cope with his growing powers. <ref name="sm673">''Superman'' #673 (2008)</ref> 

Afterwards, Superman held a press conference to inform the world that the Kryptonian child was under his care. At that time, [[Bizarro]], sent by [[Lex Luthor]], attacked in an attempt to [[kidnap]] Chris, but he failed. Later, it was revealed that Chris is the biological son of [[General Zod]] and [[Ursa (comics)|Ursa]]. His arrival released Zod, [[Non (DC comics)|Non]], and Ursa from the [[Phantom Zone]].<ref name="ac845">''Action Comics'' #845 (2007)</ref>  He was apparently conceived and raised there within a prison structure that is immune to the "timeless" effects of the zone, and Christopher himself was specially immune as well. It was insinuated by Phantom Zone resident [[Lar Gand|Mon-El]] that Zod and Ursa were abusive towards their son before sending him out of the Zone. In a battle with Superman, Zod and Ursa reclaimed their son and captured Lois. After sending Superman to the [[Phantom Zone]], General Zod's army invaded Earth.<ref name="ac846">''Action Comics'' #846 (2007)</ref>  Superman escaped with Mon-El's aid, and then sought an alliance with [[Lex Luthor]] to defeat Zod, who had captured a large portion of Earth's superhero population.  In Zod's custody, Chris used his powers to prevent Lois from being harmed.<ref name="ac851">''Action Comics'' #851 (2007)</ref>

Following the events of  ''Action Comics Annual'' #11, Zod and his army were defeated and Chris pursued them into the Phantom Zone in order to ensure that the passage between the Phantom Zone and the rest of the universe is closed properly, since it would remain weak for as long as he remained on Earth. He was aware of the cost of this action, and as he left he thanked Superman and Lois for giving him a proper family.  Afterward, Mon-El, asked by Superman to look for the child in the Zone, reported that he was unsuccessful so far although he knows that Zod does not have him, but vowed to continue searching.

===Nightwing===
After returning to the [[Phantom Zone]], Chris entered the Kryptonian prison where his parents had made shelter. Finding a piece of [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac's]] technology, Chris's mind interfaced with the device, expanding his consciousness, and somehow forging a connection with the mind of [[Thara Ak-Var]], security chief of [[Kandor]], which had recently been freed from Brainiac's ship by Superman. Thara used the connection between their minds to stage a successful rescue attempt with the added help of [[Non (DC comics)|Non]].<ref>''Action Comics Annual'' #12</ref> When the citizens of Kandor created [[New Krypton]], which was placed in orbit around the Sun at the opposite side of Earth, Chris and Thara tasked themselves with the mission bring in the Phantom Zone Kryptonian criminals hiding on Earth as sleeper agents. Since the belligerent government of [[Alura|Alura Zor-El]] and Zod had tarnished all Kryptonians' reputations on Earth, Chris and Thara decided to act as a new [[Nightwing]] and [[Flamebird]] duo, at first with simple cloth masks, then with fake power suits, to throw people off about the origins of their powers.

However Chris, due to his birth in the Phantom Zone, exhibited strange and uncontrollable growth spurts: despite when Thara saved him he was still the young boy left by [[Lois Lane]], as Nightwing he was shown being roughly 15 or 16, and after another debilitating growth spurt of about seven years, he had aged to 23 years old.<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=20543 Greg Rucka: Man of "Action"]</ref>

His mother, [[Ursa]], stalked him for vengeance. Chris had been shown refusing his heritage, and insisting Thara to address him with his "human" name, despising her attempts to transliterate it as a Kryptonian name, and never going by his birth name of Lor-Zod. <ref name="ac875">''Action Comics'' #875 (2009)</ref> After a brutal attack by Ursa, Thara is left gravely wounded by a frangible [[Kryptonite]] knife, and Chris is forced to bring her to Lois Lane for medical assistance.<ref name="ac876">''Action Comics'' #876 (2009)</ref>

Once he brought Thara to Lois, the two had a tearful reunion; although Lois was happy to see him again she was concerned about his advanced aging. Lois called [[Doctor Light (Kimiyo Hoshi)|Doctor Light]] for medical assistance while Chris went back to the fortress and was again confronted by his biological mother. Their conflict was cut short as UAVs sent by [[Sam Lane|General Lane]] arrived at the scene, forcing both to flee.<ref name="ac876">''Action Comics'' #877 (2009)</ref> 

While Chris returned home to Lois, he found that Thara had recovered and was being quizzed by Lois about their relationship. Before Lois was able to learn anything, the two flew away to confront a Kryptonian couple on a crime spree. The four battled, with Chris and Thara quickly gaining the upper hand; however their fight was interrupted by [[Codename: Assassin]] and what seemed to be a gang of "ogres". <ref name="ac876">''Action Comics'' #878(2009)</ref> The sleeper couple used the distraction to escape. Nightwing pursued them, but was forced to let them go in order to save some innocents from a falling bridge.<ref>''Action Comics'' #879</ref>

After the two had received a hero's thank you from a crowd in Hollywood, Thara noticed that one of the girls gave her phone number to Chris. Chris asks if she is jealous. Thara/[[Flamebird]] lies that she does not care if he goes around with hundreds of girls. Reacting on an impulse the two share a kiss. Before either of the two actually manages to respond they are attacked by [[Metallo]] and [[Reactron]] and captured.<ref name="ac880">''Action Comics'' #880 (2009)</ref>

However, Chris and Thara are teleported away, along with [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]]. Supergirl attacks Thara, for killing her father and trying to kill her. However, Chris stops her and tells her he is his cousin. The three are attacked by Guardian and the Science Police, for apparently killing Mon-El. Chris tries to tell Guardian that they did not murder Mon-El, but Guardian ignores him. The three manage to escape to Paris. Chris, Thara and Kara talk about what has happened. They then discover that the two sleepers they were fighting were Metallo and Reactron. However, they are attacked by Squad K.<ref name="ac881">''Action Comics'' #881 (2009)</ref>

Framed for the murder of [[Mon-El]], the two manage to escape from Squad K, and go to [[Lana Lang]]'s apartment. They decide to get Lois's help in clearing their names. Chris and Lana go to find Lois while Kara and Thara stay in Lana's apartment.<ref name="supergirl45">''Supergirl'' volume 5 #45 (2009)</ref>

Chris are Thara are discovered, and once more forced to flee. During the attempt to flee they once more encounter Squad K however the three opt to surender in order to clear their names. While they manage to persuade the Squad K commander, Reactron quickly murders his team-mates and attempts to kill the three.

During their conflict Thara is injured while atemptig to protect Supergirl. As Reactron is about to kill Chris and Kara, Thara manifests her Flamebird powers and personality in which she easily overpowers and defeats Reactron. The Flamebird decides to kill Reactron but is swayed to show mercy after Reactron reveals that Mon-El is alive and is talked down by Supergirl. The Flamebird is once more submerged after sharing a kiss with Chris.<ref>''Action Comics'' #882</ref>

Donning new costumes, Chris and Thara continue to save lives, despite their actions being twisted by the anti-Kryptonian media. Not long after, Chris experiences another aging spurt, becoming an old man. Doctor Light brings Chris to her colleague, Doctor Pillings, who, unbeknownst to any of them, is the Kryptonian sleeper agent [[Jax-Ur]].<ref>''Action Comics'' #883</ref>

==Continuity discrepancy==
Due to the pronounced scheduling problems with the release of the "[[Superman: Last Son]]" storyline, a line of dialogue in ''Action Comics Annual'' #11 is incorporated ("I even got to meet Robin.") which insinuates that the invasion of Zod's army takes place after Chris receives his red-sun watch, which places the events of ''Superman'' #664, 668, and 673 and all of Christopher Kent's other appearances chronologically between panels of ''Action Comics'' #846 (despite the fact that the latter was released earlier).

To explain the discrepancy, editor Matt Idelson theorized in an interview that "after the last panel of Issue #846, Page 9, Clark, Lois and Chris stepped out for lunch. Several weeks passed by, during which Clark and Lois struggled with raising Chris, Chris went to school, met Robin, helped the [[Superman: The Third Kryptonian|third Kryptonian]], etc., and then, on an off-day from school, Chris, Clark and Lois happened to all wear the same outfits they were wearing on Page 9 of #846 (they're extremely organized, methodical people, and Chris imitated his "parents") and took another trip to mom and dad's office, wherein Zod attacked."<ref name="interview">[http://www.supermanhomepage.com/inter-action/inter-action.php?topic=ask-editor/ask-matt-0408 Superman Homepage<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Other versions==
An alternate universe counterpart of Chris Kent (from Earth-16) appears in the ''[[Countdown: Arena]]'' mini-series, where he is depicted as a highly evolved (both physically and spiritually) individual with access to vast powers beyond those of standard Kryptonians.  Sacrificing himself in an attempt to kill [[Monarch (comics)|Monarch]] ([[Captain Atom|Nathaniel Adam]]), he is ultimately the first to fall in his battle against the Supermen of [[Superman: Red Son|Earth-30]] and [[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns|Earth-31]].

==Powers and abilities==
Chris has developed some of [[Powers and abilities of Superman|Superman's powers]]. His abilities are less powerful than the ones of the average [[Kryptonian]]. He has exhibited eight Kryptonian abilities so far:

* Flight: He flies in the [[Fortress of Solitude]] and at the Kent farm.<ref name="ac845"/>
* Heat vision: He burns [[General Zod]]'s hand when he attempts to harm [[Lois Lane]].<ref name="ac851" />
* Telescopic vision: He is able to combine this power with his x-ray vision to watch the main screens in the [[Batcave]] from afar.<ref name="sm668" />
* X-ray vision: He is able to combine this power with his telescopic vision to watch the main screens in the Batcave from afar.<ref name="sm668" />
* Invulnerability: He arrives on Earth unharmed, and a bus falls on him during the [[Bizarro]] attack.<ref name="ac845"/> However he has stated that he isn't as invulnerable as other Kryptonians.<ref name="ac876"/>
* Super strength: He is able to lift a television in the Metahuman Affairs lab.<ref name="ac844" /> He also caught the ''[[Daily Planet]]'' globe as it fell during the Bizarro attack.<ref name="ac845" /> He has stated that he is not as strong as other Kryptonians.<ref name="ac876"/>
* Intelligence: He is able to memorize a dictionary within an hour and learn the English language.<ref name="ac845" />
* Super breath: He is able to use this power to slow the falls of several cars, allowing [[Superman]] to catch them.<ref name="sm668">''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' #668</ref>

As [[Nightwing]], he has also demonstrated additional abilities due to his birth in the [[Phantom Zone]]:
* Tactile telekinesis: He is able to dismantle objects similarly to Conner Kent.<ref name="ac876"/> Although he also displays the skill to use his tactile telekinesis in a more traditional sense, such as moving objects without actually touching them.<ref>''Supergirl V.5'' #46</ref>
* Resistance to Kryptonite: He does not feel the effects of Kryptonite exposure as severely as other Kryptonians.<ref name="ac876"/>

He is also immune to the effects of the [[Phantom Zone]], because he was born there. He has a solid body within the zone and apparently ages normally while all other inhabitants are timeless and phantoms. For the same reason however, while living outside the Zone, he ages in sudden, debilitating, growth spurts, in which several years pass to him in mere minutes.<ref name="ac875"/>
