'''Medusa''' is a [[fictional]]  [[superhero]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. She first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' vol. 1 #36, and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

==Fictional character biography==
Medusa belongs to the race of [[Inhumans]], a species of prehistoric earthlings mutated by the [[Terrigen Mist]]s produced deep under the Inhuman city-state of [[Attilan]], presently located in the oxygen-rich Blue Area of the moon. [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]], the wife of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avenger]] [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], is Medusa's younger sister. Medusa was born to Quelin and Ambur, who were both Inhumans. Quelin was the brother of Rynda, wife of King Agon. Because of that family connection, Medusa was considered a member of Attilan's Royal Family. Her parents chose to expose her to the Terrigen Mists when she was a child, though currently the Inhumans' tradition dictates that exposure to the Mists must wait until puberty.

During her adolescent years Medusa would often visit her cousin [[Black Bolt]] during his confinement, and she learned to communicate with him through body language. During the course of these visits and following his release at the age of eighteen, the two fell in love and became engaged. Black Bolt's insane brother [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus the Mad]] also claims to be in love with Medusa, and has made frequent attempts to usurp both the throne of Attilan as well as his brother's bride-to-be.

Medusa first made her appearance in [[Fantastic Four]] as Madame Medusa<ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #36</ref>.  At that time, she suffered from amnesia and affiliated herself with the [[Frightful Four]], [[Silver Age of Comics|Silver Age]] nemeses of the Fantastic Four.  It was some time before the disastrous effects of worldly pollution on the Inhumans was known, but eventually Medusa regained her senses and joined forces with the Fantastic Four. She was reunited with Black Bolt, who had been searching for her, and returned to Attilan<ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #46-47</ref>. The Fantastic Four became friends and allies and aided the Inhumans on several occasions, such as during the frequent power struggles between Black Bolt and the deranged Maximus. 

Medusa has been known to join the Fantastic Four as a team member for brief periods of time. She became a temporary replacement for [[Invisible Woman|Susan Richards]]<ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #130</ref>, known as the Invisible Girl at that time, when she was on leave caring for her comatose son [[Franklin Richards]]. Through her relations with the Fantastic Four, Medusa and Black Bolt have sought to achieve an understanding and peace between the races of Earth and Attilan. Nevertheless, the Inhumans have been forced to relocate their home of Attilan several times due to unwarranted human hostility.

Black Bolt would eventually become the king of the Inhumans upon the death of his parents. After Attilan was moved to the Blue Area of the Moon, Medusa and Black Bolt were married and Medusa was made queen.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, Annual #18</ref> When Medusa became pregnant, Attilan's Genetics Council argued that the pregnancy should be terminated due to the possibility of the child inheriting Maximus' insanity coupled with Black Bolt's immense and destructive power. Medusa defied the Council and fled to Earth to live anonymously in the desert until the child was born, a son named [[Ahura (comics)|Ahura]]. Black Bolt reconciled with Medusa and the pair returned to Attilan and turned their infant son over to the Genetics Council. Following these events Ahura became [[retroactive continuity|retconned]] from the Marvel Universe for several years.

===Royalty===
Medusa's primary role among the Inhumans is as interpreter for her liege and husband, the silent but commanding Black Bolt. As such she is an experienced state figure within the quasi-feudal system of the Inhumans' government, and is used to speaking with awareness of regal issues of protocol and comportment. This imperial attitude is usually tempered by her strong sense of morality and fairness<ref>Inhumans Graphic Novel</ref><ref>Inhumans vol. 1, #6</ref>. For the protection of all Inhumans (her first priority) and to aid her allies (such as the Fantastic Four), she is a fierce warrior.

===[[Beyond!]]===
[[Image:Beyond medusa.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Medusa and Venom, by [[Scott Kolins]]]]
Medusa is featured in the six issue series ''[[Beyond!]]''. She is kidnapped along with other famous and infamous superhumans to the artificial planet known as [[Battleworld]]. After witnessing [[Venom (comics)|Venom]] apparently murder [[Spider-Man]], she passes royal judgement that he must undergo fifty lashes. She supersedes the authority of the Avenger's represenative, [[Wasp (comics)|Janet Van Dyne]], and uses the control over her hair to create a whipping motion so fast that it produces miniature sonic booms, which Venom is especially vulnerable to. While Henry Pym tries to dissuade Medusa from continuing the punishment, Venom is able to stab Medusa through the thigh. Later on in the issue, Medusa saves the team during the sudden crash landing of their space vessel by absorbing the majority of the impact with her hair. As stated by Wasp, Medusa is the team's primary short-range offense. Eventually the team triumphs over the [[Beyonder]] and returns to Earth. At the end of the series, Medusa can be seen alongside Black Bolt attending the funeral of her Beyond! teammate [[Gravity (comics)|Gravity]].   She gifts Gravity's parents with a precious statue, the highest honor amongst the Inhumans, in commemoration of Gravity's sacrifice.

===[[I Heart Marvel]]===

Medusa stars and narrates in a one-shot vignette appearing in issue #3 of the ''Marvel Ai'' edition. Entitled ''Silence of the Heart'', the story explores the relationship between Medusa and Black Bolt. Medusa explains that her husband's silence is a burden that she also bears. Black Bolt makes an appearance at this point and the two are shown to make love as Medusa contemplates her longing to hear a moan, whisper, or laugh from him.

===[[Son of M]]===

This title focuses on [[Quicksilver (comics)|Pietro Maximoff]] following the events of ''[[House of M]]''. After attempting to commit suicide, a dying Pietro is brought to Attilan by Crystal. While [[Gorgon (comics)|Gorgon]] protests, Medusa grants Pietro asylum in Attilan until he is fully recovered. Once healed, a depowered Pietro tries to convince Black Bolt and Medusa to allow him access to the Terrigen Mists, but Medusa firmly states that [[Terrigen Mists|Terrigenesis]] is a process forbidden to outsiders and that such a process upon a human could result in drastic mutations. Pietro manages to expose himself to the Mists regardless, and receives new powers before collecting both the Terrigen Crystals and his daughter, Luna, and returning to Earth. The crystals eventually end up in the possession of a black-ops sector of the United States government. The sector's subsequent refusal to return the crystals sparks a declaration of civil war between the Inhumans and the United States.

During this title it is made reference that Black Bolt and Medusa are childless.  Upon discovery that Luna has been taken to Earth by Pietro, Medusa advises Crystal that perhaps it is right that Pietro should spend time with his daughter. Crystal remarks that if Medusa had children of her own she might be able to understand how she felt over the matter. It is not apparent whether this is an example of Ahura's existence being retconned from the Marvel Universe, or if this is meant to be a sarcastic comment in reference to Ahura's supposed confinement.

===[[Silent War]]===
[[Image:Maximusmedusa.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Medusa and Maximus, by [[Frazer Irving]]]]
The events of ''Silent War'' immediately follow the events of ''Son of M''.

The Silent War series reveals a growing rift between Medusa and Black Bolt as the two disagree on his decision to declare war against the United States for failing to relinquish the Terrigen Crystals. Medusa finds herself no longer able to interpret her husband's wishes as she used to. While Medusa is issuing Black Bolt's war declarations to the Inhumans council he becomes frustrated and snaps his fingers to silence her, indicating that she wasn't relating what he intended. Medusa later confides to Black Bolt that he had never treated her that way before, as if she were a dog, and Black Bolt responds apologetically. 

Their son, Ahura, also reappears in this series as a mentally unstable adolescent. Medusa argues that Black Bolt seems not to care that their son is being kept in isolation, and advises him that despite his orders she has gone to visit Ahura in his cell on more than one occasion. Black Bolt is angered by this and becomes physically aggressive with Medusa, grabbing her face and mouth to silence her. In her growing confusion with her husband's actions, Medusa finds herself drawn to Maximus against her will and would visit him often in his prison cell. It is revealed by [[Luna (comics)|Luna]], Crystal's daughter, that Maximus had somehow implanted a "darkness" into Medusa's mind that was effecting her actions. Later on, Medusa and Maximus share a kiss as a distraught Black Bolt watches from the shadows. Medusa's thoughts at the time, however, reveal that she is not in control of her actions and that she only loves Black Bolt. The end of Silent War is left a cliffhanger with Black Bolt confined in prison, Ahura released, and Medusa now at Maximus' side as he assumes the throne of the Inhumans. It has not been confirmed whether the series will continue.

===[[World War Hulk]]===
Medusa appears alongside Black Bolt in issue #1 of the ''[[World War Hulk]]'' series.

Medusa is seen with Black Bolt when [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] attacks Attilan. She warns Hulk not to pursue a fight with her husband, as Black Bolt has defeated Hulk in past battles. The fight begins, and Medusa is not shown to interfere or assist. Black Bolt is subsequently defeated by Hulk, though the battle is not shown beyond Black Bolt's opening attack and it is made unclear as to how Hulk managed to win the fight.

===[[Secret Invasion]]===
It has recently been revealed that Black Bolt has been replaced by a [[Skrull]] impostor for an unknown amount of time.<ref>''New Avengers: Illuminati'' #5</ref> The impostor revealed himself to the [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]] and was killed. It remains to be seen whether Medusa is aware of the Skrull plot and what her part will be, if any, in the Secret Invasion storyline. Both the sudden rift between Medusa and Black Bolt apparent in Silent War and Black Bolt's later defeat at the hands of Hulk  in World War Hulk could be attributed to this development, for it is uncertain just when Black Bolt might have been replaced by his Skrull duplicate.

==Powers and abilities==

Medusa possesses a long, thick head of red hair, every strand of which has greater tensile strength, modulus of elasticity, and shear resistance than an iron wire of the same thickness (average hair diameter: .045 inches), as well as the psychokinetic ability to animate her hair for a number of feats including using her hair to lift and move heavy weights (up to 1.6 tons). A portion of her hair must be used to anchor the rest at these greater weights, so that more than her scalp/skull is used as a brace<ref>Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe vol. 1, #7</ref>.

[[Image:Medusahair.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Medusa and her hair, by [[Jae Lee]]]]
Medusa can control the movement of her hair as if it were countless thin appendages growing from her head. A psionic field permeates her mutagenically altered hair-cells, causing mutual attraction across the gaps between strands. These relatively small forces operate in conjunction to develop larger forces. Through concentration, she can psionically move her hair in any manner imaginable. She can snap the length of it through the air like a whip (the tip of which moves faster than the speed of sound), or rotate it in a fan-like manner. She can bind persons or objects with it as if it were rope or use it to lift objects which weigh more than she could lift with her arms. (Her scalp, skull, and neck do not support the weight of an object that she lifts: it is held aloft by the psionic force coursing through the hair.) Medusa can also perform delicate manipulations with her hair such as lock picking or threading a needle, and such complex acts of coordination as typing or shuffling a deck of cards. Although she has no nerve endings in her hair, she can "feel" sensations on all parts of her hair by a form of mental feedback from her psionic field<ref>Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe vol. 1, #7</ref>.

Medusa is also able to retain some degree of control over her hair after it has been cut or otherwise severed from her scalp.<ref>Inhumans Graphic Novel</ref>

Medusa presumably has the typical enhanced physical abilities of an Inhuman. She is also highly skilled at interpreting the gestures and body language of Black Bolt.

Medusa originally possessed an immunity to the pollutants of the outside world, which enabled her to join the Fantastic Four (as well as be a former member of the Frightful Four) in the first place.
This immunity has since gone unmentioned.

==Other versions==
===Marvel 1602===
{{main|Marvel 1602}}
Medusa appears in the Marvel 1602 miniseries: ''1602: Fantastick Four'' as a member of the "Four Who Are Frightful", and the Wizard's lover. Like her Ultimate counterpart, she has snakes for hair. She must also wear a veil, to prevent her gaze turning men to stone. While her introduction describes her as "inhuman" her origins are not mentioned. She appears to be a native French speaker (hence, "Madame" Medusa).

===Earth X===
In the alternate future of [[Earth X]], Medusa's hair volume has drastically increased. She has lost [[Black Bolt]] and fears the emotional loss of her son, Ahura. She is the acting ruler and Queen of the Inhumans. Many of her remaining friends and allies have mutated due to the incidents on Earth. As a way to tie together some of the powerful factions remaining on Earth, [[Captain Britain]] proposes to her.

===Heroes Reborn===
{{main|Heroes Reborn}}
Medusa's home city of Attilan plays host to the Fantastic Four. As in other realities, she speaks for her husband, Black Bolt. The Four are asked to help the Inhumans stop the plans of Maximus the Mad, who seeks out and plans to control the Terrigen Mists. The group at first does not understand the request, which leads to a battle. Medusa proves herself a capable fighter, helping to keep the battle at a stalemate. 

In this universe [[Galactus]] is worshipped, and the Royal Council pay reverence to him and his team of heralds in the form of finely crafted statues throughout Attilan.

===Mutant X===
{{main|Mutant X (comics)}}
After the Beyonder/Goblin Queen and the vampire Dracula lay waste to the Earth's heroes in an attempt to conquer the Multiverse, a team of Inhumans, Medusa included, and Eternals attack from above. They battle in the heart of Washington D.C. Dracula easily slays the entire group.

===Ultimate Medusa and Marvel Zombies===
[[Image:Ultimate couple.PNG|right|thumb|100px|Ultimate Medusa and Black Bolt, by [[Jae Lee]]]]
:''Main article: [[Ultimate Marvel]]''
A version of Medusa appears in the Ultimate Marvel series, first appearing in the [[Ultimate Fantastic Four]] issue ''Annual 1: Inhuman''. She is still the queen of the Inhumans and wife to their leader, Black Bolt. As with her namesake, in this universe her skin is green in color and she has actual snakes for hair. It is not stated whether her newly serpentine hair restricts or enhances her abilities in any way. Along with [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]], the Inhuman [[Gorgon (comics)|Gorgon]] is also Medusa's sister. Black Bolt's brother, [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus]], does not display any romantic feelings for Medusa in this universe.

Unlike other versions, Ultimate Medusa is against all associations with the [[Fantastic Four]] and believes that the two races of Inhumans and humans can never co-mingle in peace. She also exhibits an extreme degree of loyalty towards her people, stating that there can be no greater honor than to put aside one's individual happiness for the welfare of Attilan. Despite these sentiments, she expresses regret over her husband's inability to vocalize his feelings.
 
During a later issue of Ultimate Fantastic Four #22 where Reed Richards enters into the [[Marvel Zombies]] universe, an undead Medusa can be seen briefly amongst the crowd of attacking super-powered zombies. Her hair is not composed of snakes in this version.

While the Inhumans' army went to Earth to fight Doctor Doom, Black Bolt remained on Atillan to guard Dark Medusa in case Doctor Doom came to reclaim her. It is unknown whether Doom's defeat at the conclusion of the game cures Medusa.
