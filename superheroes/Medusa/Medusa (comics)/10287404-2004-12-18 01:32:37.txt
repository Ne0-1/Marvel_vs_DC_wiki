She is a member of the [[Inhumans]], the wife of [[Black Bolt]] and sister of [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]].   She at one time was a member of the [[Fantastic Four]] and the [[Frightful Four]].

The tensile strength of her hair is superhuman, though it has in the past been cut by a sufficiently sharp pair of scissors.
