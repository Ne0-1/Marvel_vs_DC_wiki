'''Medusa''' is a [[fictional]]  [[superhero]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. She first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' vol. 1 #36, and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

==Fictional character biography==
Medusa belongs to the race of [[Inhumans]], a species of prehistoric earthlings mutated by the [[Terrigen Mist]]s produced deep under the Inhuman city-state of [[Attilan]], presently located in the oxygen-rich [[Blue Area of the Moon]]. [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]] (who later became the wife of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avenger]] [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]]) is Medusa's younger sister. Medusa was born on the island of Attilan to Quelin and Ambur, who were both Inhumans. Quelin was the brother of [[Rynda (comics)|Rynda]], wife of King [[Agon (comics)|Agon]]. Because of that family connection, Medusa was considered a member of Attilan's Royal Family. Her parents chose to expose her to the Terrigen Mists when she was a child, though currently the Inhumans' tradition dictates that exposure to the Mists must wait until puberty.

During her adolescent years Medusa would often visit her cousin [[Black Bolt]] during his confinement, and she learned to communicate with him through body language. During the course of these visits, the two fell in love and became engaged. She attended Black Bolt's release from his isolation cell at the age of eighteen, and witnessed the first confrontation between Black Bolt and his insane brother [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus the Mad]].<ref>as revealed in ''Thor'' #149</ref> Maximus also claims to be in love with Medusa, and has made frequent attempts to usurp both the throne of Attilan as well as his brother's bride-to-be. It was in Maximus' first successful attempt to take the throne that Medusa was afflicted with amnesia. She left Attilan, and wandered Europe as a thief.<ref>as revealed in ''Inhumans Special'' #1</ref>

[[Image:MedusaFF99.jpg|right|thumb|100px|Medusa, by [[Jack Kirby]]]]

Medusa first made her appearance in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #36 as Madam Medusa.  At that time, she suffered from amnesia as a result from a plane crash. While wandering through Europe, she comes to the attention of The Wizard, who is seeking a worthy female to become the fourth member of his new quartet, the [[Frightful Four]], [[Silver Age of Comics|Silver Age]] nemeses of the Fantastic Four.  Wizard's partners Sandman and Paste-Pot Pete, aka The Trapster, ask him how he could come up with a suitable female. Wizard says that he knows of a female and that she'd be perfect. A few weeks later Wizard has another meeting with his male comrades.  Pete asks him if he found someone with a power great enough to match that of Susan Storm.  Wizard announces that the female that he has found may be even more powerful!  When they see Medusa, they are most impressed.  Mighty Medusa performs superbly in the Frightful Four's first battle with the Fantastic Four.  She wraps Sue Storm up in her scarlet tresses, while Wizard knocks her out with a can of sleep spray.  The Frightful Four then send Sue, Reed, Ben and Ben's girlfriend, Alicia, helplessly floating into the sky.  If not for the intervention of The Torch, who was away when the Frightful Four invaded the Baxter Building, Medusa and her comrades would have succeeded.  The next battle of the quartets takes place in ''Fantastic Four'' #38, "Defeated by the Frightful Four".  For a second straight time, Madam Medusa succeeds in her task of beating the Invisible Girl. She lures Sue to a fashion show and then captures Sue with her invincible hair, while the Trapster snares her with his sticky paste.  Wizard, Medusa and Trapster then abduct Sue.  They take her to an isolated Pacific atoll.  They go underground and Wizard tells Trapster to place the girl on the floor near the detonation mechanism of his atomic Q-bomb.  The Frightful Four then lure the rest of the Fantastic Four to the island, using Sue as the bait.  Medusa and her comrades escape before the bomb explodes.  The Fantastic Four's lives are saved, thanks to Reed's idea of having Sue use her force field.  However, all four of them have lost their powers.  Medusa and her comrades again battle the Fantastic Four in issues #41-43.  Wizard brainwashes the Thing in issue #41 and he joins the Frightful Four.  The Frightful Four then easily defeat Sue, Johnny and Reed.  Medusa initially grabs Sue with her hair, but Sue breaks free with her force field and hides inside of it.  The Thing, however, threatens to knock Sue into the middle of next week and she faints before he smashes her force field.  Medusa then brilliantly has Trapster place Sue in a chemically treated plastic bag, which is impervious to Sue's invisibility power, making the blonde girl helpless. In ''Fantastic Four'' #42, we begin by seeing Sue still helplessly imprisoned in the giant plastic bag Medusa had Trapster create.  When Torch frees Sue, Medusa again initially traps Sue with her hair, but then Sue turns the tables and captures Medusa in a force field. In ''Fantastic Four'' #43, Sue attacks Medusa with a series of force spheres, but then Medusa counters and wraps her up in her mighty hair.  She even captures the Torch in ''Fantastic Four'' #43 by soaking her hair with water and then drenching his flame. All in all, Medusa fared quite well while a member of the Frightful Four.  Her team almost beat the ''Fantastic Four'' in #36.  They did beat them in #38 and again in #41.  The scarlet villainess beat her blonde opponent, Sue Storm, in ''Fantastic Four'' #36 and in #38.  Their fight was a tie in #41, but Medusa still bested Sue by directing Trapster to imprison the blonde girl.  Sue won their fight in #42, but Medusa came back and was winning in #43 when Reed stopped the fight.  The most success the Frightful Four had was when Medusa was on the team! She was then pursued by [[Gorgon (Inhuman)|Gorgon]] on behalf of Maximus.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #44</ref> It was some time before the disastrous effects of worldly pollution on the Inhumans was known, but eventually Medusa regained her senses and joined forces with the Fantastic Four. She was reunited with Black Bolt, who had been searching for her, and returned to Attilan. However, she became trapped in Atillan by the "negative zone" barrier created by Maximus.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #45-48</ref> She was eventually freed from the barrier by Black Bolt, and left the Great Refuge to visit the outside world as an adventurer.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #59</ref> The Fantastic Four became friends and allies and aided the Inhumans on several occasions, such as during the frequent power struggles between Black Bolt and the deranged Maximus.

Medusa has been known to join the Fantastic Four as a team member for brief periods of time. She became a temporary replacement for [[Invisible Woman|Susan Richards]]<ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #130</ref>, known as the Invisible Girl at that time, when she was on leave caring for her comatose son [[Franklin Richards]]. Through her relations with the Fantastic Four, Medusa and Black Bolt have sought to achieve an understanding and peace between the races of Earth and Attilan. Nevertheless, the Inhumans have been forced to relocate their home of Attilan several times due to unwarranted human hostility.

Black Bolt would eventually become the king of the Inhumans upon the death of his parents. Medusa oversaw the moving of Attilan to the [[Blue Area of the Moon]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #240</ref> Alongside the Inhuman Royal Family, she battled the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] under Maximus's mind control.<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #12</ref> Medusa and Black Bolt were then married and Medusa was made queen, becoming both royal consort and royal interpreter.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, Annual #18</ref> When Medusa became pregnant, Attilan's Genetics Council argued that the pregnancy should be terminated due to the possibility of the child inheriting Maximus' insanity coupled with Black Bolt's immense and destructive power. Medusa defied the Council and fled to Earth to avoid the compulsory abortion and live anonymously in the desert until the child was born, a son named [[Ahura (comics)|Ahura]].<ref>''Inhumans Graphic Novel''</ref> Black Bolt reconciled with Medusa and the pair returned to Attilan and turned their infant son over to the Genetics Council. Following these events Ahura became [[retroactive continuity|retconned]] from the Marvel Universe for several years.

Later, alongside the Inhumans and the original [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], she battled [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #67-68</ref> Alongside the Inhumans and Avengers, she also battled the Brethren.<ref>''Avengers'' #334-335</ref>

===Royalty===
Medusa's primary role among the Inhumans is as interpreter for her liege and husband, the silent but commanding Black Bolt. As such she is an experienced state figure within the quasi-feudal system of the Inhumans' government, and is used to speaking with awareness of regal issues of protocol and comportment. This imperial attitude is usually tempered by her strong sense of morality and fairness.<ref name="Inhumans Graphic Novel">Inhumans Graphic Novel</ref><ref>Inhumans vol. 1, #6</ref> For the protection of all Inhumans (her first priority) and to aid her allies (such as the Fantastic Four), she is a fierce warrior.

===Beyond!===
{{Main|Beyond!}}
[[Image:Beyond medusa.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Medusa and Venom, by [[Scott Kolins]]]]
Medusa is featured in the six issue series ''[[Beyond!]]''. She is kidnapped along with other famous and infamous superhumans to the artificial planet known as [[Battleworld]]. After witnessing [[Venom (comics)|Venom]] apparently murder [[Spider-Man]], she passes royal judgement that he must undergo fifty lashes. She supersedes the authority of the Avenger's representative, [[Wasp (comics)|Janet Van Dyne]], and uses the control over her hair to create a whipping motion so fast that it produces miniature sonic booms, which Venom is especially vulnerable to. While Henry Pym tries to dissuade Medusa from continuing the punishment, Venom is able to stab Medusa through the thigh. Later on in the issue, Medusa saves the team during the sudden crash landing of their space vessel by absorbing the majority of the impact with her hair. As stated by Wasp, Medusa is the team's primary short-range offense. Eventually the team triumphs over the [[Beyonder]] and returns to Earth. At the end of the series, Medusa can be seen alongside Black Bolt attending the funeral of her ''Beyond!'' teammate [[Gravity (comics)|Gravity]].  She gifts Gravity's parents with a precious statue, the highest honor amongst the Inhumans, in commemoration of Gravity's sacrifice.

===I Heart Marvel===
{{Main|I Heart Marvel}}
Medusa stars and narrates in a one-shot vignette appearing in issue #3 of the ''Marvel Ai'' edition. Titled ''Silence of the Heart'', the story explores the relationship between Medusa and Black Bolt. Medusa explains that her husband's silence is a burden that she also bears. Black Bolt makes an appearance at this point and the two are shown to make love as Medusa contemplates her longing to hear a moan, whisper, or laugh from him.

===Son of M===
{{Main|Son of M}}
This title focuses on [[Quicksilver (comics)|Pietro Maximoff]] following the events of ''[[House of M]]''. After attempting to commit suicide, a dying Pietro is brought to Attilan by Crystal. While [[Gorgon (comics)|Gorgon]] protests, Medusa grants Pietro asylum in Attilan until he is fully recovered. Once healed, a depowered Pietro tries to convince Black Bolt and Medusa to allow him access to the Terrigen Mists, but Medusa firmly states that [[Terrigen Mists|Terrigenesis]] is a process forbidden to outsiders and that such a process upon a human could result in drastic mutations. Pietro manages to expose himself to the Mists regardless, and receives new powers before collecting both the Terrigen Crystals and his daughter, Luna, and returning to Earth. The crystals eventually end up in the possession of a black-ops sector of the United States government. The sector's subsequent refusal to return the crystals sparks a declaration of war between the Inhumans and the United States.

During this title it is made reference that Black Bolt and Medusa are childless.  Upon discovery that Luna has been taken to Earth by Pietro, Medusa advises Crystal that perhaps it is right that Pietro should spend time with his daughter. Crystal remarks that if Medusa had children of her own she might be able to understand how she felt over the matter. It is not apparent whether this is an example of Ahura's existence being retconned from the Marvel Universe, or if this is meant to be a sarcastic comment in reference to Ahura's supposed confinement.

===Silent War===
{{Main|Silent War}}
[[Image:Maximusmedusa.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Medusa and Maximus, by [[Frazer Irving]]]]
The events of ''Silent War'' immediately follow the events of ''Son of M''.

The Silent War series reveals a growing rift between Medusa and Black Bolt as the two disagree on his decision to declare war against the United States for failing to relinquish the Terrigen Crystals. Medusa finds herself no longer able to interpret her husband's wishes as she used to. While Medusa is issuing Black Bolt's war declarations to the Inhumans council he becomes frustrated and snaps his fingers to silence her, indicating that she wasn't relating what he intended. Medusa later confides to Black Bolt that he had never treated her that way before, as if she were a dog, and Black Bolt responds apologetically.

Their son, Ahura, also reappears in this series as a mentally unstable adolescent. Medusa argues that Black Bolt seems not to care that their son is being kept in isolation, and advises him that despite his orders she has gone to visit Ahura in his cell on more than one occasion. Black Bolt is angered by this and becomes physically aggressive with Medusa, grabbing her face and mouth to silence her. In her growing confusion with her husband's actions, Medusa finds herself drawn to Maximus against her will and would visit him often in his prison cell. It is revealed by [[Luna (comics)|Luna]], Crystal's daughter, that Maximus had somehow implanted a "darkness" into Medusa's mind that was affecting her actions. Later on, Medusa and Maximus share a kiss as a distraught Black Bolt watches from the shadows. Medusa's thoughts at the time, however, reveal that she is not in control of her actions and that she only loves Black Bolt. The end of Silent War is left a cliffhanger with Black Bolt confined in prison, Ahura released, and Medusa now at Maximus' side as he assumes the throne of the Inhumans. It has not been confirmed whether the series will continue.

Due to inconsistencies with other Marvel titles featuring Black Bolt during this time, it is unclear when, and if, ''Silent War'' takes place in relation to [[Illuminati (Marvel Comics)|The Illuminati]], [[World War Hulk]], and [[Secret Invasion]] storylines.

===World War Hulk===
{{Main|World War Hulk}}
Medusa appears alongside Black Bolt in issue #1 of the ''[[World War Hulk]]'' series.

Medusa is seen with Black Bolt when [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] attacks Attilan. She warns Hulk not to pursue a fight with her husband, as Black Bolt has defeated Hulk in past battles. The fight begins and Medusa is not shown to interfere or assist. Black Bolt is subsequently defeated by Hulk, though the battle is not shown beyond Black Bolt's opening attack and it is made unclear as to how Hulk managed to win the fight.

===New Avengers: Illuminati===
{{Main|New Avengers: Illuminati}}
It has recently been revealed that Black Bolt has been replaced by a [[Skrull]] impostor for an unknown amount of time.<ref>''New Avengers: Illuminati'' #5</ref> The impostor revealed himself to the [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]] and was killed. Both the sudden rift between Medusa and Black Bolt apparent in ''Silent War'' and Black Bolt's later defeat at the hands of Hulk in ''World War Hulk'' could be attributed to this development, for it is uncertain just when Black Bolt might have been replaced by his Skrull duplicate.

===Secret Invasion: Inhumans===
{{Main|Secret Invasion}}
This upcoming story by ''[[Heroes (television)|Heroes]]'' writer Joe Pokaski digs into how the Inhuman Royal Family deals with the news that the Black Bolt they knew was a Skrull impostor.<ref>''www.Marvel.com/news''</ref>. Medusa is shown fighting a Skrull that not only possesses her powers, but also possesses the powers of Mister Fantastic.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Inhumans'' #2</ref> Medusa heads into Kree space to get [[Ronan the Accuser]] to help look for the Skrull ship containing Black Bolt and her son.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Inhumans'' #3</ref> She succeeds in rescuing her family and returning to Attilan.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Inhumans'' #4</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Medusa possesses a long, thick head of red hair; thanks to her exposure to the mutagenic Terrigen Mist, every strand of her hair has greater tensile strength, modulus of elasticity, and sheer resistance than an iron wire of the same thickness (average hair diameter: .045&nbsp;inches). She possesses the psychokinetic ability to animate her hair for a number of feats, including elongating it to almost twice its normal length (Medusa's hair is approximately {{convert|6|ft|m}} in length when relaxed), and using her hair to lift and move heavy weights (up to 1.6 tons); a portion of her hair must be used to anchor the rest at these greater weights, so that more than her scalp/skull is used as a brace.<ref name="MU7">Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe vol. 1, #7</ref>

[[Image:Medusahair.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Medusa and her hair, by [[Jae Lee]]]]
Medusa can control the movement of her hair as if it were countless thin appendages growing from her head. A psionic field permeates her mutagenically altered hair-cells, causing mutual attraction across the gaps between strands. These relatively small forces operate in conjunction to develop larger forces. Through concentration, she can psionically move her hair in any manner imaginable. She can snap the length of it through the air like a whip (the tip of which moves faster than the speed of sound), or rotate it in a fan-like manner. She can bind persons or objects with it as if it were rope, or use it to lift objects which weigh more than she could lift with her arms. (Her scalp, skull, and neck do not support the weight of an object that she lifts: It is held aloft by the psionic force coursing through the hair.) Medusa can also perform delicate manipulations with her hair such as lock picking or threading a needle, and such complex acts of coordination as typing or shuffling a deck of cards. Although she has no nerve endings in her hair, she can "feel" sensations on all parts of her hair by a form of mental feedback from her psionic field.<ref name="MU7"/>

Medusa is also able to retain some degree of control over her hair after it has been cut or otherwise severed from her scalp.<ref name="Inhumans Graphic Novel"/> She presumably has the typical enhanced physical abilities granted by the genetically superior Inhuman physiology. She is also highly skilled at interpreting the gestures and body language of Black Bolt, and has a fluency in a special sign language used to communicate with Black Bolt.

Like all Inhumans, Medusa's immune system is weaker than that of an average human. However, due to her frequent ventures into the outside world, Medusa's immune system has been strengthened until it is no longer as weak as that of her fellow Inhumans. As such she has attained a resistance to the pollutants of the outside world, which enabled her to join the Fantastic Four (as well as be a former member of the Frightful Four) in the first place.

Medusa is an accomplished thief, using her hair.

==Other versions==
===Earth X===
In the alternate future of [[Earth X]], Medusa's hair volume has drastically increased. She has lost [[Black Bolt]] and fears the emotional loss of her son, Ahura. She is the acting ruler and Queen of the Inhumans. Many of her remaining friends and allies have mutated due to the incidents on Earth. As a way to tie together some of the powerful factions remaining on Earth, [[Captain Britain]] proposes to her.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Their story continues into the mini-series ''Paradise X'', where convienence has turned into love. However, the status of their relationship and their political positions is thrown into turmoil when Captain Britain's presumed lost wife [[Meggan]] is brought back to life.<ref>"Paradise X" #4</ref>

===Heroes Reborn===
{{Main|Heroes Reborn}}
Medusa's home city of Attilan plays host to the Fantastic Four. As in other realities, she speaks for her husband, Black Bolt. The Four are asked to help the Inhumans stop the plans of Maximus the Mad, who seeks out and plans to control the Terrigen Mists. The group at first does not understand the request, which leads to a battle. Medusa proves herself a capable fighter, helping to keep the battle at a stalemate.

In this universe [[Galactus]] is worshipped, and the Royal Council pay reverence to him and his team of heralds in the form of finely crafted statues throughout Attilan.

===Marvel 1602===
{{Main|Marvel 1602}}
Medusa appears in the Marvel 1602 miniseries: ''1602: Fantastick Four'' as a member of the "Four Who Are Frightful", and the Wizard's lover. Like her Ultimate counterpart, she has snakes for hair. She must also wear a veil, to prevent her gaze turning men to stone. While her introduction describes her as "inhuman" her origins are not mentioned. She appears to be a native French speaker (hence, "Madame" Medusa).

===Mutant X===
{{Main|Mutant X (comics)}}
After the [[Beyonder]]/[[Goblin Queen]] and the vampire [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]] lay waste to the Earth's heroes in an attempt to conquer the [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Multiverse]], a team of Inhumans, Medusa included, and [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]] attack from above. They battle in the heart of Washington D.C. Dracula easily slays the entire group.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

===Marvel Zombies 3===
In ''[[Marvel Zombies 3]]'' #2 she along with the [[Inhumans#Royal Family|Inhuman Royal Family]] are shown to be zombies have visited a zombie [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] to ask for food which they get.<ref>''[[Marvel Zombies 3]]'' #2</ref> In the next issue [[Machine Man]] blows up her head.<ref>''[[Marvel Zombies 3]]'' #3</ref>

===Ultimate Medusa===
[[Image:Ultimate couple.PNG|right|thumb|100px|Ultimate Medusa and Black Bolt, by [[Jae Lee]]]]
{{Main|Ultimate Marvel}}
A version of Medusa appears in the Ultimate Marvel series, first appearing in the [[Ultimate Fantastic Four]] issue ''Annual 1: Inhuman''. She is still the queen of the Inhumans and wife to their leader, Black Bolt. As with her namesake, in this universe her skin is green in color and she has actual snakes for hair. It is not stated whether her newly serpentine hair restricts or enhances her abilities in any way. Along with [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]], the Inhuman [[Gorgon (Inhuman)|Gorgon]] is female and also Medusa's sister. Black Bolt's brother, [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus]], does not display any romantic feelings for Medusa in this universe.

Unlike other versions, Ultimate Medusa is against all associations with the [[Fantastic Four]] and believes that the two races of Inhumans and humans can never co-mingle in peace. She also exhibits an extreme degree of loyalty towards her people, stating that there can be no greater honor than to put aside one's individual happiness for the welfare of Attilan. Despite these sentiments, she expresses regret over her husband's inability to vocalize his feelings.
