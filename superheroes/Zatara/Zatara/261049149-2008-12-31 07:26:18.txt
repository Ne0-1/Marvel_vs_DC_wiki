'''Giovanni Zatara''' is a fictional character in the [[DC Universe]]. He first appeared in ''[[Action Comics]]'' # 1 and was created by writer and artist [[Fred Guardineer]].

==History==
Zatara is introduced as a [[magic (paranormal)|magician]] in various publications of [[DC Comics]], beginning with 1938's ''[[Action Comics]]'' # 1, which also contains the first appearance of [[Superman]]. Like Mandrake who he was a copy of, Zatara had a large African as a friend/bodyguard called Tong to share his early adventures.

A descendant of the [[Homo Magi]], as well as being an [[magic (illusion)|illusionist]], Zatara also had genuine magical powers, which he focused through speaking backwards: he could do anything so long as he could describe it in ''sdrawkcab hceeps'' ("backwards speech"). This helped distinguish Zatara from the numerous [[Mandrake the Magician]] knockoffs that cluttered the [[comic]]s and [[pulp magazine]]s of the day, although [[Merlin the Magician (comics)|Merlin the Magician]] ([[Quality Comics]]) also had this attribute, and it was also given to him by Zatara's creator, [[Fred Guardineer]].

His love of magic began early when he was given a magic kit by his uncle, himself a professional illusionist. Although he began learning the craft in childhood, his early attempts at performing professionally were unsuccessful until he realized that he needed to work on his [[showmanship]]. 

To that end, he dug up old diaries of [[Leonardo Da Vinci]], who was a direct ancestor. While reading the diaries, which Da Vinci wrote in backwards spelling as a security precaution, Zatara learned that his family had the command of magic. He discovered this inadvertently when he accidentally gave a command to a [[mannequin]] to begin waving an arm wildly. Zatara realized that he could command it to stop by giving the order in backwards spelling.

With this new knowledge, Zatara developed a successful show. During the premiere performance a fire broke out on stage, forcing Zatara to use his command of real magic to put it out. While the audience mistook the incident as part of the act, Zatara realized that this power could be invaluable in helping people and he resolved to use it as such between shows.

At the conclusion of [[Alan Moore]]'s "American Gothic" storyline in ''[[Swamp Thing]]'' (which was loosely tied to the events of the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''), John Zatara, his daughter [[Zatanna]], [[John Constantine]] and [[Sargon the Sorcerer]], among others, come together to help demonic and divine forces in other hellish dimensions battle the Great Evil Beast. The Beast takes notice of their group twice. The first glimpse burns Sargon, whom Zatara convinces to 'die like a Sorcerer' and not break the holding of hands. Sargon burns to death nobly. The second glance literally heats up Zatanna but Zatara willingly takes the effect onto himself, dying but sparing his daughter's life. The Beast is ultimately neutralized by other forces. 

Since then he has made sporadic appearances in the afterlife, including resurrecting Mason O'Dare in ''[[Starman (comics)|Starman]]'' #80, and the ''Seven Soldiers: Zatanna'' miniseries.  In ''Reign of Hell'' #5, Zatara is slain a second time in Hell by a rampaging [[Lobo]].  Rather than let himself become fodder for Hell, he asks Zatanna to obliterate his soul, which she does with great anguish.

His nephew, [[Zachary Zatara|Zachary]], now uses the Zatara name as a stage magician, going so far, in the alternate future of the ''[[Titans Tomorrow]]'' timeline, to model his physically apperance and heroic getup on the vintage clothing and grooming of his late uncle.

==Other versions==
Another Zatara was featured in a supporting role in the miniseries ''[[Kingdom Come (comic)|Kingdom Come]]'' and its follow-up, ''[[The Kingdom (comic)|The Kingdom]]''. This Zatara is the son of Zatanna and magician [[John Constantine]], which makes him the grandson of the original. He is described as "a youthful Harry Houdini-like successor to the magician super-hero lineage."

The one broadcast depiction of the character was in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' in a flashback within the episode "[[Zatanna (Batman: The Animated Series)|Zatanna]]", where the (supposedly non-powered) character trained [[Bruce Wayne]] as an escape artist. Zatara has already died, of unspecified circumstances, by the time that episode took place. He was voiced by [[Vincent Schiavelli]].

In addition, in the ''Cartoon Monsoon'' contest, Zatara appeared in the ''Zatanna'' entry as the frustrated father of the title character. The story was set during Zatanna's teen years and took certain liberties.
