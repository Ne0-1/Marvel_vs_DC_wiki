'''Giovanni "John" Zatara''' is a fictional character in the [[DC Universe]]. He first appeared in ''[[Action Comics]]'' # 1 and was created by writer and artist [[Fred Guardineer]].

==History==
John Zatara is introduced as a [[magic (paranormal)|magician]] in various publications of [[DC Comics]], beginning with 1938's [[Action Comics 1|''Action Comics'' # 1]], which also contains the first appearance of [[Superman]]. Like the very similar [[Mandrake the Magician]], Zatara had a large African as a friend/bodyguard, called Tong, to share his early adventures.

As well as being an [[magic (illusion)|illusionist]], Zatara also had genuine magical powers (decades later ascribed to being a descendant of the [[Homo Magi]]), which he focused through speaking backwards: he could do anything so long as he could describe it in ''sdrawkcab hceeps'' ("backwards speech"). This helped distinguish Zatara from the numerous [[Mandrake the Magician]] knockoffs that cluttered the [[comic]]s and [[pulp magazine]]s of the day{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}, although [[Merlin the Magician (comics)|Merlin the Magician]] ([[Quality Comics]]) also had this attribute, and it was also given to him by Zatara's creator, [[Fred Guardineer]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}.

His love of magic began early when he was given a [[magic kit]] by his uncle, himself a professional illusionist. Although he began learning the craft in childhood, his early attempts at performing professionally were unsuccessful until he realized that he needed to work on his [[showmanship]]. 

To that end, he dug up old diaries of [[Leonardo Da Vinci]], who was a direct ancestor. While reading the diaries, which Da Vinci wrote in backwards spelling as a security precaution, Zatara learned that his family had the command of magic. He discovered this inadvertently when he accidentally gave a command to a [[mannequin]] to begin waving an arm wildly. Zatara realized that he could command it to stop by giving the order in backwards spelling.

With this new knowledge, Zatara developed a successful show. During the premiere performance a fire broke out on stage, forcing Zatara to use his command of real magic to put it out. While the audience mistook the incident as part of the act, Zatara realized that this power could be invaluable in helping people and he resolved to use it as such between shows.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

At the conclusion of [[Alan Moore]]'s "American Gothic" storyline in ''[[Swamp Thing]]'' (which was loosely tied to the events of the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''), John Zatara, his daughter [[Zatanna]], [[John Constantine]] and [[Sargon the Sorcerer]], among others, come together to help demonic and divine forces in other hellish dimensions battle the Great Evil Beast. The Beast takes notice of their group twice. The first glimpse burns Sargon, whom Zatara convinces to 'die like a Sorcerer' and not break the holding of hands. Sargon burns to death nobly. The second glance literally heats up Zatanna but Zatara willingly takes the effect onto himself, dying but sparing his daughter's life. The Beast is ultimately neutralized by other forces. (v2 issue #50)

===Afterlife problems===
Since then he has made sporadic appearances in the afterlife, including resurrecting Mason O'Dare in ''[[Starman (comics)|Starman]]'' #80, and the ''Seven Soldiers: Zatanna'' miniseries. In ''Reign of Hell'' #5, Zatara is part of a general resistance movement operating in Hell. He is caught up in the various conflicts and is slain a second time in Hell by a rampaging [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]]. As with most of the 'dead', he risks becoming fodder for Hell, a torment where the physicallity of the damned is used for general resources such as building material. By manipulating his blood to form words, he asks Zatanna to consign his soul to the 'abyss', a realm Hell cannot affect. Zatanna does so, tormented that she must now destroy her father's essence. 

His nephew, [[Zachary Zatara|Zachary]], now uses the Zatara name as a stage magician, going so far, in the alternate future of the ''[[Titans Tomorrow]]'' timeline, to model his physically appearance and heroic getup on the vintage clothing and grooming of his late uncle.

In an ''Justice League of America'' vol. 2 #39 tie-in to the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' crossover, Zatara was reanimated as a member of the [[Black Lantern Corps]], ready to attack his daughter, Zatanna in the [[Hall of Justice (comics)|Hall of Justice]].

==Other versions==
Another Zatara was featured in a supporting role in the miniseries ''[[Kingdom Come (comic)|Kingdom Come]]'' and its follow-up, ''[[The Kingdom (comic)|The Kingdom]]''. This Zatara is the son of Zatanna and magician [[John Constantine]], which makes him the grandson of the original. He is described as "a youthful Harry Houdini-like successor to the magician super-hero lineage."{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Rather than speak backwards just for his spells, however, he does it all the time, which annoys his colleagues no end{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}.

The one broadcast depiction of the character was in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' in a flashback within the episode "[[Zatanna (Batman: The Animated Series)|Zatanna]]", where the character trained [[Bruce Wayne]] as an escape artist. Zatara has already died, of unspecified circumstances, by the time that episode took place. He was voiced by [[Vincent Schiavelli]]. Zatara is also mentioned by Batman as his mentor in [[ventriloquism]], in the episode "Read my Lips".

In addition, in the ''Cartoon Monsoon'' contest, Zatara appeared in the ''Zatanna'' entry as the frustrated father of the title character. The story was set during Zatanna's teen years and took certain liberties.

Zatara is mentioned several times by his daughter in the ''[[Smallville]]'' episode "Hex." In that episode, his daughter, Zatanna attempts to bring him back to life with a magic spell, but in order to do that, she must sacrifice a life, which she intends to be her own.
