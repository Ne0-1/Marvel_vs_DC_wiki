'''Nightside''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]].

==Fictional character biography==
Nightside is a long-time member of the [[Shi'ar]] [[Imperial Guard (comics)|Imperial Guard]].  She possesses various abilities stemming from the [[Darkforce]] dimension, most notably the power to generate absolute darkness in an unspecified radius, and the ability to displace individuals into the Darkforce dimension, subjecting to a metaphysical sense of cold and fear, much like the power of [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)| Cloak]]. Her powers are apparently a natural attribute of her race. Though she wields her abilities with great skill, her greatest fear is that she will someday be consumed by them.

Like [[Oracle (Marvel Comics)|Oracle]], she was injured by [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]]. Unlike several of her fellow Guardsman, Nightside survived and was seen soon after battling the [[X-Men]] and the [[Starjammers]].
