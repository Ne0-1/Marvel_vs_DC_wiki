'''Nightside''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
Nightside first appeared in ''[[X-Men]]'' #107-109 (October 1977-February 1978), and was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Dave Cockrum]].

The character subsequently appears in ''X-Men: Spotlight on Starjammers'' #2 (June 1990), ''Avengers West Coast'' #81 (April 1992), ''Quasar'' #33 (April 1992), ''Thor'' #446 (April 1992), ''Starblast'' #2 (February 1994), ''Quasar'' #55 (February 1994), ''Starjammers'' #4 (January 1996), ''Imperial Guard'' #1-3 (January-March 1997), ''Inhumans'' Vol. 4 #4 (September 2000), ''JLA/Avengers'' #1 (September 2003), ''Uncanny X-Men'' #477 (October 2006), #480 (January 2007), #485-486 (June-July 2007), and ''X-Men: Emperor Vulcan'' #2-5 (December 2007-March 2008).

Nightside appeared as part of the "Imperial Guard" entry in the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition]]'' #6.

==Fictional character biography==
Nightside is a long-time member of the [[Shi'ar]] [[Imperial Guard (comics)|Imperial Guard]].

She was with the Imperial Guard the first time they fought the X-Men.{{issue|date=November 2011}}

Nightside was one of the Imperial Guard members stationed on Earth for a time.<ref>''Imperial Guard'' #1-4</ref>

Like [[Oracle (Marvel Comics)|Oracle]], she was injured by [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Unlike several of her fellow Guardsman, Nightside survived and was seen soon after battling the [[X-Men]] and the [[Starjammers]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}} However, during the attack on the Kree homeworld, she was slain by an [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] soldier.<ref>''War of Kings'' #1 (March 2009)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Nightside possessed various abilities stemming from the [[Darkforce]] dimension, most notably the power to generate absolute darkness in an unspecified radius, and the ability to displace individuals into the Darkforce dimension, subjecting them to a metaphysical sense of cold and fear, much like the power of [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak]]. Her powers were apparently a natural attribute of her race. Though she wielded her abilities with great skill, Nightside's greatest fear was that she would someday be consumed by them.

==Inspiration==
Several of the members of the Imperial Guard are at least partly based on members of the [[DC Comics]] team [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]. ([[Dave Cockrum]], co-creator of the Guard, also had a long run as artist on the Legion.) Nightside is based on LSH member [[Shadow Lass]].<ref>Moreels, Eric J.
