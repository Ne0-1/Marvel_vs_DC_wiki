'''Nightside''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]].

==Publication history==
Nightside first appeared in ''[[X-Men]]'' #107-109 (October 1977-February 1978), and was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Dave Cockrum]].

The character subsequently appears in ''X-Men: Spotlight on Starjammers'' #2 (June 1990), ''Avengers West Coast'' #81 (April 1992), ''Quasar'' #33 (April 1992), ''Thor'' #446 (April 1992), ''Starblast'' #2 (February 1994), ''Quasar'' #55 (February 1994), ''Starjammers'' #4 (January 1996), ''Imperial Guard'' #1-3 (January-March 1997), ''Inhumans'' Vol. 4 #4 (September 2000), ''JLA/Avengers'' #1 (September 2003), ''Uncanny X-Men'' #477 (October 2006), #480 (January 2007), #485-486 (June-July 2007), and ''X-Men: Emperor Vulcan'' #2-5 (December 2007-March 2008).

Nightside appeared as part of the "Imperial Guard" entry in the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition]]'' #6.

==Fictional character biography==
Nightside is a long-time member of the [[Shi'ar]] [[Imperial Guard (comics)|Imperial Guard]].  She possesses various abilities stemming from the [[Darkforce]] dimension, most notably the power to generate absolute darkness in an unspecified radius, and the ability to displace individuals into the Darkforce dimension, subjecting to a metaphysical sense of cold and fear, much like the power of [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)| Cloak]]. Her powers are apparently a natural attribute of her race. Though she wields her abilities with great skill, her greatest fear is that she will someday be consumed by them.

Nightside was one of the Imperial Guard members stationed on Earth for a time.<ref>''Imperial Guard'' #1-4</ref>

Like [[Oracle (Marvel Comics)|Oracle]], she was injured by [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]]. Unlike several of her fellow Guardsman, Nightside survived and was seen soon after battling the [[X-Men]] and the [[Starjammers]].

==Inspiration==
Several of the members of the Imperial Guard are at least partly based on members of the [[DC Comics]] team [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]. (Dave Cockrum, co-creator of the Guard, also had a long run as artist on the Legion.) Nightside is based on LSH member [[Shadow Lass]].{{Fact|date=June 2008}}
