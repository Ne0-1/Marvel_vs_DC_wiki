'''Hijacker''' is a [[Fictional character|fictional]] [[American comic book]] character owned by [[Marvel Comics]] who exists in that company's [[Marvel Universe]].

Hijacker was a gimmick-laden villain who specialized in stealing technology for later resale in criminal auctions.

==Publication history==
Hijacker first appeared in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' #40 (February 1963), and was created by [[Stan Lee]], [[Larry Lieber]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

The character subsequently appears in ''Marvel Two-In-One'' #24 (February 1977), #96 (February 1983), and ''Captain America'' #319 (July 1986), in which he was killed by the [[Scourge of the Underworld]].

==Fictional character biography==
Hijacker was first defeated by [[Henry Pym|Ant-Man]]<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #40</ref>, and later by [[Bill Foster (comics)|Black Goliath]] and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]].<ref>''Marvel Two-In-One'' #24</ref>  He was good at last-moment “rabbits out of the hat” tricks that no one expected. He returned for vengeance on the Thing after the hero was hospitalized. He used a tank similar in appearance to his last one, but it was not as durable and [[Iron Man]] made quick work of it.<ref>''Marvel Two-In-One'' #96</ref> 

Hijacker attended the “Bar With No Name” massacre. Without his gimmicks and protection, he proved easy prey for the [[Scourge of the Underworld]].<ref>''Captain America'' #319</ref> 

Hijacker was later among the seventeen criminals, all murdered by the Scourge, to be resurrected by [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] using the power of [[Dormammu]] as part of a squad assembled to eliminate the [[Punisher]].<ref>''Punisher'' Vol. 7 #5</ref> He carries over a dozen different kinds of gases in his backpack, and has his giant impenetrable tank.<ref>http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/preview2.php?image=previews/marvelcomics/punisher/villains/PunisherVillains-6.jpg</ref> Hijacker chases the Punisher in his tank, who uses Pym particles to shrink down and get into the tank; after taking control of the tank, Punisher crashes it into the building where [[Basilisk (comics)|Basilisk]] was holding [[G. W. Bridge]] and uses the gases on Basilisk.<ref>''Punisher'' Vol. 7 #9</ref>

==Equipment==
Hijacker gained his abilities from his heavy body-suit, which provided the power for his weapons. His heavy, brown, reinforced fabric suit provided protection against physical, energy, heat, fire, and cold attacks.  When sealed with his odd-looking helmet, Hijacker had his own 4-hour oxygen supply and was immune to gases.

Hijacker’s main weapon was a multifunction gun called a “Vario-Blaster,” attached to the belt of his outfit by a cable.  With his weapon, Hijacker could fire: “nuclear flame,” knock-out nerve gas, damaging projectiles, “ionic blasts,”, and an “activator beam” which activated any nearby machinery.

Hijacker’s “Crime-Tank” was a heavily armored fort on spiked treads.  This mobile base was an off-road vehicle, and had electromagnets as weapons. This tank was destroyed by the Thing and Black Goliath.
