'''Hijacker''' is a [[Fictional character|fictional]] [[American comic book]] character owned by [[Marvel Comics]] who exists in that company's [[Marvel Universe]].

Hijacker was a gimmick-laden villain who specialized in stealing technology for later resale in criminal auctions.

==Publication history==
Hijacker first appeared in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' #40 (February 1963), and was created by [[Stan Lee]], [[Larry Lieber]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

The character subsequently appears in ''Marvel Two-In-One'' #24 (February 1977), #96 (February 1983), and ''Captain America'' #319 (July 1986), in which he was killed by the [[Scourge of the Underworld]].

==Fictional character biography==
Hijacker was first defeated by [[Henry Pym|Ant-Man]], and later by [[Bill Foster (comics)|Black Goliath]] and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]].  He was good at last-moment “rabbits out of the hat” tricks that no one expected.

Hijacker attended the “Bar With No Name” massacre. Without his gimmicks and protection, he proved easy prey for the [[Scourge of the Underworld]].

==Equipment==
Hijacker gained his abilities from his heavy body-suit, which provided the power for his weapons. His heavy, brown, reinforced fabric suit provided protection against physical, energy, heat, fire, and cold attacks.  When sealed with his odd-looking helmet, Hijacker had his own 4-hour oxygen supply and was immune to gases.

Hijacker’s main weapon was a multifunction gun called a “Vario-Blaster,” attached to the belt of his outfit by a cable.  With his weapon, Hijacker could fire: “nuclear flame,” knock-out nerve gas, damaging projectiles, “ionic blasts,”, and an “activator beam” which activated any nearby machinery.

Hijacker’s “Crime-Tank” was a heavily armored fort on spiked treads.  This mobile base was an off-road vehicle, and had electromagnets as weapons. This tank was destroyed by the Thing and Black Goliath.
