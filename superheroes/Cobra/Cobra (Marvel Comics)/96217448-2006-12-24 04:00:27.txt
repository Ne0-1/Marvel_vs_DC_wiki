'''The Cobra''' (real name Klaus Voorhees), also known as '''The Human Cobra''' and '''King Cobra''', is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain]], most commonly associated with [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] and [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].

The character was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Don Heck]] in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #98 (November, [[1963]]) where he was confronted by Thor. The next issue saw him team up with [[Mister Hyde (comics)|Mister Hyde]] (with Hyde being the brains of the team) and the duo had a few encounters with the Thunder God before their first skirmish with Daredevil in ''Daredevil'' #30 (July, [[1967]]). Hyde and the Cobra were partners for years, although their partnership ended not long before the Cobra joined [[Sidewinder (comics)|Sidewinder]]'s [[Serpent Society]]. When Sidewinder retired, the Cobra became the leader of the Society under the name "[[King Cobra]]".  He still leads the Society (complete with a new Sidewinder) though he also partners with Hyde on occasion.

He was later forced to join the Thunderbolts and trained by Swordsman.

==Origins and powers==
Klaus Voorhees (born in [[Rotterdam]]) was the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] assistant to Professor Schecktor, a scientist working in [[India]] and looking for a cure to snake bites. Unsatisfied with his lower condition, and intent on stealing Schecktor's discoveries, Voorhees killed the professor by using a [[cobra (snake)|cobra]] and in order to make himself look less guilty, let the cobra bite him as well. He used an experimental antidote to cure himself, but denied it to Schecktor. The cobra was radioactive, and in a process similar to [[Spider-Man]]'s, Voorhees gained super-human abilities similar to a cobra's. Most notably his amazing [[contortionist]] powers and slithery body let him break in, and escape from, buildings. He also has the ability to stick to walls or ceilings. Combined with his super-strength and reflexes, they make him a formidable [[wrestler]].

Cobra is also armed with special gadgets that complete his cobra likeness: he is equipped with a "cobra cord" (an unbreakable cable) to tie up his enemies (solid enough to resist Thor's strength), can launch "cobra darts" ([[venom]]-filled projectiles) out of his wrists and release some toxic "cobra gas".

In the Mini-series ''Toxin: The Devil you know'', Cobra himself quotes:
{{cquote|''My bones are almost impossible to break. My tissue doesn't tear. I don't get [[hangover]]s, either.''}}
