'''The Cobra''' (real name Klaus Voorhees), also known as '''The Human Cobra''' and '''King Cobra''', is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain]], most commonly associated with [[Daredevil]] and [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].

The character was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Don Heck]] in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #98 (November, [[1963]]) where he was confronted by Thor. The next issue saw him team up with [[Mister Hyde (comics)|Mister Hyde]] and the duo had a few encounters with the Thunder God before their first skirmish with Daredevil in ''Daredevil'' #30 (July, [[1967]]). Hyde and the Cobra were partners for years, although their partnership ended not long before the Cobra joined [[Sidewinder (comics)|Sidewinder]]'s [[Serpent Society]]. When Sidewinder retired, the Cobra became the leader of the Society under the name "King Cobra". Much later, Sidewinder returned to lead the Society, and the Cobra and Hyde became partners again.

==Origins and powers==

Klaus Voorhees was the assistant to Professor Schecktor, a scientist working in India and looking for a cure to snake bite. Unsatisfied with his lower condition, and intent on stealing Schecktor's discoveries, Voorhees killed the professor. In the process, he was bitten by a radioactive [[cobra (snake)|cobra]] and gained super-human abilities. Most notably his amazing [[contortionist]] powers let him break in, and escape from, buildings. Combined with his super-strength, they make him a formidable wrestler.
