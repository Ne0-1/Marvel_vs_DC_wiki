'''Foxbat''' is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character was created by [[Chris Claremont]].

==Publication history==
'''Foxbat''' first appearance was in X-Factor #65.

==Fictional character biography==
Like other members of the [[Dark Riders (comics)|Riders of the Storm]], he originally came from [[Attilan]] and joined the team unwillingly when [[Apocalypse]] captured half of the city. After the city was liberated by the [[X-Men]] and Black Bolt, he retained membership in the team as he, like the others, was a deep believer in Apocalypse's [[Social Darwinism]] and wanted to rid the world of those unworthy.

The Riders of the Storm, now going by the name Dark Riders, came under the leadership of [[Genesis (Marvel comics)|Genesis]]. Genesis judged Foxbat unworthy of living. Chastised by his own teammates, Foxbat fled but was recaptured, and Genesis drained his lifeforce. Any hope of resurrecting him was lost when his remains were destroyed during the conflict between Genesis and his father, [[Cable (comics)|Cable]].<ref>http://www.comicvine.com/foxbat/29-26892/</ref>
