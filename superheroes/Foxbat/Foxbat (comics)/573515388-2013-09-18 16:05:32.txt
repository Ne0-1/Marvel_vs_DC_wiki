'''Foxbat''' is a [[comic book]] [[supervillain]] in the {{Marvel Universe}} created by [[Chris Claremont]].

==Publication history==
'''Foxbat''' first appearance was in X-Factor #65.

==Fictional character biography==
Like other members of the [[Dark Riders (comics)|Riders of the Storm]], he originally came from [[Attilan]] and joined the team unwillingly when [[Apocalypse]] captured half of the city. After the city was liberated by the [[X-Men]] and Black Bolt, he retained membership in the team as he, like the others, was a deep believer in Apocalypse's [[Social Darwinism]] and wanted to rid the world of those unworthy. An ironic twist would be that Foxbat would later in his life be considered unfit to survive in his own team.

The Riders of the Storm, now going by the [[Dark Riders (comics)|Dark Riders]], came under the leadership of [[Genesis (comics)|Genesis]], who was even more insane than any of their previous leaders. Genesis found Foxbat unworthy of living and he was chastised by his own teammates who caught him and brought him back to Genesis, who drained his lifeforce. Foxbat could had possibly been revived but during the conflict with Genesis' father [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], the base where his body rested was destroyed.<ref>http://www.comicvine.com/foxbat/29-26892/</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Foxbat had powers that granted him enhanced strength, speed, and reflexes as well as the ability to see in the dark and to use his fangs and claws as weapons.
