'''Gary Concord, the Ultra-Man''' was the name of two [[fictional character|fictional]], [[comic-book]] [[superheroes]], father and son, who [[first appeared]] during the 1940s period fans and historians call the [[Golden Age of comic books]]. Both were characters of [[All-American Publications]], which merged in 1946 with [[DC Comics]]-predecessor [[National Periodical Publications]].

They are separate from the [[DC Universe]] character [[Ultraman (comics)|Ultraman]], a [[supervillain]] and evil counterpart of [[Superman]], who was introduced in ''[[Justice League of America]]'' #29 (Aug. 1964) or the [[Japan]]ese superhero, [[Ultraman]].

==Publication history==
Created by [[writer]]-[[artist]] [[Jon L. Blummer]] under the [[pseudonym]] Don Shelby, Ultra-Man debuted in All-American's flagship title, ''[[All-American Comics]]'' #8 (Nov. 1939), in the first part of a two-part story. Part one, in ''All-American Comics'' #9 (Dec. 1939), continues the story with Gary Concord Jr. He would appear until issue #19 in 1940.

The latter Ultra-Man made a [[flashback (literary technique)|flashback]] appearance in "The Last Earth-Prime Story", in ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' #411 (Sept. 1985).

==Fictional character biographies==
Gary Concord Sr., a 20th-century scientist, had devoted his life to finding the means to end war. In 1950, an accident put him into [[suspended animation]]. He awoke as a chemically altered superhuman in the year 2174. His son, Gary Concord Jr., is born in 2214 to the lifespan-lengthened Gary Sr. and wife Leandra &mdash; daughter of the tyrant Rabborizon, whom Gary Sr. defeated. Rabborizon eventually returned to kill his own daughter, however, prompting Gary Sr. to kill Rabborizon in return. 

After Gary Sr. dies of natural causes in 2239, Gary Jr. succeeds him as both Ultra-Man and as High Moderator of the United States of North America, the country's chief executive. He battles the warlord Tor and other menaces, and is later put into suspended animation until the 100th century. An encounter with the superheroine [[XS (comics)|XS]] (Jenni Ognats) of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] inspires Ultra-Man to form his own such team with fellow heroes [[Avatar (comics)|Avatar]], [[Behemoth (comics)|Behemoth]], and [[Metallica (comics)|Metallica]] on the planet Almeer-5.
