'''Anthem''', real name Henry Hellrung,  is a fictional superhero appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by [[Matt Fraction]] and [[Barry Kitson]], he was an ordinary human who gained temporary powers due to special drugs that empowered normal humans with superhuman abilities. His superhero identity is an allusion to the god [[Apollo]].

==Origin==
A former actor who portrayed [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] on an unnamed show, Henry Hellrung enjoyed an extremely successful career and friendship with Stark until heavy drinking led to his downfall. Realizing he needed to turn his life around, he entered rehab, then [[Alcoholics Anonymous]]. When Tony Stark's drinking became too much, Henry was the man who convinced him to come to AA, and helped him get sober.

Henry became the leader of a superhero team known as [[The Order (comics)|The Order]], a group of superheroes coming out of the super-human [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]], as part of the [[Avengers: The Initiative|50 States Initiative]]. The superheroes where actually normal humans powered with drugs to give them superhuman abilities. The effects of the powers would however only last for about a year. After that, the team would have to find new recruits. The team had a massive Public Relations campaign and soon became great heroes. Henry was however never sure about his role as a leader in the team. His fears soon came to pass when almost his entire team was fired when half the team was caught on camera at a strip-club celebrating their victory over a defeated villain. He debated with Stark and co-leader [[Pepper Potts]] over whether to fire those members. While he didn't agree with Stark and Potts about the firing, he ultimately accepted it and fired the four members, replacing them with Mulholland Black, Milo Fields, Rebecca Ryan, and Magdalena Marie. It however did not last long. Due to internal conflicts and the deaths of two of their teammates, the group quietly dropped to the background.

==Fear Itself==

Some months later, during the events of ''Fear Itself'', Commander [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]] informs [[Prodigy (Ritchie Gilmore)|Prodigy]] of the unknown meteors that have fallen from the heavens and mass panic is on the horizon. Rogers asks Prodigy to gather heroes on a volunteer basis to help keep the peace and lead a new Initiative where there is no forced conscription or registration. Prodigy agrees to become the leader of the new Initiative and most of the former Initiative members including Anthem gather in Washington DC. During the ''Dark Reign'', Norman Osborn has Hellrung placed under arrest.

==Abilities==

Referred to as a "living super-cell thunderstorm", implying weather-based powers. He has demonstrated flight and electricity generation. Anthem's costume is composed of unstable molecules.
