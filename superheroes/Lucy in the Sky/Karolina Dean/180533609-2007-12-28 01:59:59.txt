'''Karolina Dean''', sometimes known as '''Lucy in the Sky''', is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[comic book]] series ''[[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]]''.  Karolina was created by author, [[Brian K. Vaughan]], and artist, Adrian Alphona.  She debuted in ''Runaways'' vol. 1 #1 with the other five original Runaways.

Karolina used to be the only [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] in the cadre of friends, but since her return to Earth with her [[Skrull]] fiancee [[Xavin]], Karolina now takes comfort in having another alien to relate and speak with.  However, Karolina still holds the distinction of being the sole [[homosexual]] within the group, and is among the ranks of openly [[LGBT comic book characters]] that have a leading role in a comic series.

===The Pride===
[[Image:Karolina.PNG|left|thumb|150px|Karolina Dean in art from Runaways #3 by Adrian Alphona]]
Karolina Dean is the daughter of Frank and Leslie Dean, two [[Hollywood]] actors who are secretly alien outcasts and members of a crime organization called the [[Pride (comics)|Pride]], along with the parents of [[Nico Minoru]], [[Chase Stein]], [[Molly Hayes]], [[Gertrude Yorkes]] and [[Alex Wilder]].  She joins the children in a mass escape from their parents to take shelter in a run-down mansion hideout that comes to be called "The Hostel."  During the escape, Karolina discovers her parents' last will and testament; they leave Karolina a piece of paper with the circular "[[no symbol]]" covering the [[Rod of Asclepius]], a symbol used in medical practice.  Alex convinces her to remove her [[medic alert bracelet]] because it is emblazoned with the symbol.  Karolina angrily concedes, thinking that she only wears the bracelet because she's allergic to penicillin, and her skin immediately glows with a fluid, rainbow-like light.  The group assumes that she is an alien and the bracelet is an "anchor" to hide her powers; Leslie Dean later confirms these theories for Karolina.  Karolina constantly struggles with her alien heritage in the runaways' early times together, feeling that it she is a "freak" amongst the group, the only one who needs to actively hide her true form.  Her insecurities even prompt Karolina to offer her life to the vampire, Topher, as Karolina expresses little desire to live.  Upon her first near-death experience at the hands of [[Alex Wilder]], the Pride's [[mole (espionage)|mole]] within the runaways, Karolina overcomes her [[death drive|death wish]] and helps the runaways escape the rampaging [[Gibborim (comics)|Gibborim]] as the Pride fight their former benefactors.  After the Pride's defeat, Karolina is sent to live with foster parents, but she organizes a secret reunion for the runaways, after which they run away again, this time to the Pride's old lair beneath the [[La Brea Tar Pits]].

===Runaway Bride===
[[Image:RUNAWAYS007.jpg|right|thumb|Cover to ''Runaways'' vol. 2 #7.  Art by Chris Bachalo.]]
In the early issues of ''Runaways'' vol. 2, Karolina fights under the command of [[Nico Minoru]], Alex's ex-girlfriend and de facto leader of the motley crew since Alex's demise.  Karolina expresses more comfort with being an extraterrestrial and makes strong hints at being a homosexual, especially as she stops to compliment [[Julie Power]] on her beauty during a battle with [[Loners|Excelsior]] over the custody of [[Victor Mancha]].  Soon after Victor joins the team, Karolina "comes out" to Nico with an attempted kiss, which Nico rejects outright.  Karolina's "outcast" insecurities resurface for a short while before her [[Skrull]] fiancee [[Xavin]] comes to Earth in search of Karolina.  Unbeknownst to her, Karolina's parents arranged Xavin's and Karolina's marriage as part of a peaceweaving effort between the Skrull and Majesdanian homeworlds.  Karolina leaves with Xavin, much to Nico's distress.  While on her home planet Majesdane, Karolina learns to control the shift between her Majesdanian and humanoid forms and how to further control her solar powers.  However, the wedding does not go as planned and the couple flees towards Earth as their homeworlds reignite the old war.  They crash land near the Hostel and return in time assist in the rescue of [[Molly Hayes]].  Karolina remains with the team and Xavin becomes accepted as a member after [[Gertrude Yorkes|Gertrude Yorkes']] death, and they both join the runaways in defeating the [[Gibborim]] for good and then fleeing [[Iron Man]] and the pro-registration forces of Marvel's [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]].

==Relationships==
===[[Nico Minoru]]===
It was subtly hinted throughout ''Runaways'' vol. 1 that Karolina had a crush on Nico, but Karolina did not make her feelings explicitly known until vol. 2 #7 when she attempted to kiss Nico.  When Nico refused, Karolina was distressed, having just gotten over the isolation of being the team's sole alien and now was outed as the team's only [[lesbian]].  Soon after, Karolina was taken away by Xavin to be wed, and left her medic alert bracelet with Nico as a token of remembrance.  When Karolina returned to Earth, it was revealed that Karolina still has feelings for and is attracted to Nico, but remains staunch in her devotion to Xavin, putting stress on the girls' friendship. Even so, they seem to remain good friends.

===[[Xavin]]===
Karolina met Xavin after suffering rejection from Nico, her crush for many months.  She initially rejected Xavin when he told her that Karolina was promised to be his bride, but after hearing that the marriage would be part of a peace treaty between her world and Xavin's, Karolina felt more inclined to accept the proposal.  She accepted fully when Xavin expressed no concern of changing physical appearance from male to female to please her.  The couple take solace in being the only two aliens and characters of different sexual orientation on the team and turn to each other for help in their common struggle to maintain a personal identity while disguising themselves from the public.  Xavin once took the form of Nico in order to please Karolina, but Karolina refused, reassuring Xavin that she loves her as she is.

==Powers and abilities==
[[Image:Karolina.jpg|left|thumb|Karolina in her true Majesdanian form.<br>''Runaways'' vol. 2 #16.  Art by Adrian Alphona]]
Like all Majesdanians, Karolina's natural form is luminous, iridescent, and visually fluid, often depicted with waves of rainbow-like light floating off her body, though body structure is essentially humanoid.  Originally, Karolina required a custom made [[medic alert bracelet]] constructed of an unspecified alien metal to revert to humanoid form.  However, after spending some months on Majesdane, Karolina learned to control the change and can make it at will.

In her Majesdanian form, Karolina is able to manipulate solar energy absorbed by her body to generate forcefields capable of stopping cave-ins & gunfire, large concussive blasts, and fine [[laser]]-like beams.  Karolina can also increase the heat of her concussive blasts to around 2500°F/1370°C, the melting point of [[steel]].  Though her parents were able to bind people and objects with the energy, Karolina has yet to demonstrate that ability.   Karolina's Majesdanian form also grants her the ability to fly.

Leslie Dean stated early in the ''Runaways'' series that Majesdanians' abilities do not affect one another.  

During an encounter with the vampire Topher, it is revealed that Karolina's blood also harbors solar energy-based properties, since drinking her blood caused Topher to combust.

==Conceptual changes==
In Brian K. Vaughan's original pitch for the series, Karolina was originally called Leslie. This name would eventually be given to the character's mother. Her parents were originally real estate magnates, as opposed to famous actors.<ref>Runaways Vol. 1 Hardcover</ref>

Karolina's Majesdanian form has been colored in two distinct styles.  Brian Weber, the first colorist of ''Runaways'', colored Karolina with many different colors of the [[visible spectrum]] from panel to panel.  [[Christina Strain]], the second colorist for ''Runaways'', colors Karolina in lighter tones, using primarily blue, yellow, and pink with a glitter-like effect.
