|}}'''Shooting Star''' is a comic book superhero appearing in [[Marvel Comics]].

==Biography==
Victoria Star was partnered with the [[Texas Twister]], working the rodeo circuit. Twister and she dreamed of using their powers to make a fortune. One night after a performance, Star and Twister heard a [[shortwave radio]] broadcast by [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] seeking help from [[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]. He and other members of the [[Teen Brigade]] had been taken captive by The [[Corruptor]], whose touch had enraged the Hulk. Thinking they could parley publicity from assisting the Avengers into financial gain, the pair answered the call. While the signal never reached the Avengers, Shooting Star and the Twister met up with [[Phantom Rider|Night Rider]], [[Red Wolf (comics)|Red Wolf]] and [[Firebird (comics)|Firebird]]. The five erstwhile heroes battled the Hulk, delaying the Corruptor's plans long enough for the Hulk to break the Corruptor's control. The five decided to continue to function as a team, calling themselves The Rangers. Their association was short-lived, however, because of the large distances between the various members.

At some point Shooting Star was replaced by a demon in the employ of [[Master Pandemonium]]. The demon claimed that there was no real Victoria Star.

==Powers==
Shooting Star has no known superhuman powers, although in her initial appearance she claimed to have "stellar powers."

Shooting Star wears a pair of specially-designed "star shooters," which look like six-shooters but which actually shoot projectiles made of an unknown material, shaped like five-pointed stars. The stars paralyze living beings they hit, with one star capable of paralyzing a six-foot tall man for approximately 30 minutes. She wears boots which contain miniature [[gyroscope|gyroscopes]], which keep her oriented correctly as she rides the winds generated by Texas Twister.

Shooting Star is an expert rodeo rider.
