Along with [[Ape-Man#Monk Keefer|Ape-Man]], [[Cat-Man (Marvel Comics)#Towshend Horgan|Cat-Man]], and [[Frog-Man (Ani-Men)#François Leblanc|Frog-Man]], Henry Hawk was recruited by a man named the Organizer to form the original [[Ani-Men]]. The Organizer supplied Henry with a winged costume enabling him to fly, and dubbed him Bird-Man. The Organizer was secretly Abner Jonas, a candidate for mayor of New York City, who sent the Ani-Men on missions to undermine the current administration. [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] defeated them and the Ani-Men and Organizer all went to prison.<ref>''Iron Man'' #10-11</ref> Later, Ape-Man, Bird-Man, and Cat-Man formed a team called the "Unholy Three" with the [[Death-Stalker|Exterminator]], and fought Daredevil again.<ref>''Daredevil'' #39-41</ref> The Unholy Three, as a team of independent thieves, fought Daredevil and [[Spider-Man]] and were defeated.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #25</ref>

Ape-Man, Bird-Man, and Cat-Man later rejoined the Ani-Men, and the Ani-Men went to work for [[Count Nefaria]]. Count Nefaria's scientists submitted the unwitting Ani-Men to processes that gave them superhuman powers and animal-like forms. The Ani-Men invaded the Cheyenne Mountain missile base for Count Nefaria, and fought the [[X-Men]].<ref>''X-Men'' #94-95</ref>

The Ani-Men lost their superhuman powers and reverted to normal. Count Nefaria sent the four original Ani-Men to kill [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]], however the [[Spymaster (comics)#Spymaster I|Spymaster]] detonated a bomb with which he had intended to kill Stark, and the resulting explosion killed the Ani-Men instead.<ref>''Iron Man'' #115-116</ref>

The [[Death-Stalker]] sometime later recruits a new team of Ani-Men, with a new Ape-Man, Bird-Man, and Cat-Man. He sends the new Ani-Men to capture [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock]]. The [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] defeats Bird-Man, and the Death-Stalker murders Ape-Man and Cat-Man upon the completion of their mission, effectively ending the Ani-Men.<ref>Daredevil #157-158</ref> The second Bird-Man is later murdered by the [[Scourge of the Underworld]], along with many other villains in the infamous "Bar with No Name" incident.<ref>{{cite comic|writer = [[Mark Gruenwald]]|penciller = [[Paul Neary]]|inker = [[Dennis Janke]]|story = Overkill|title = [[Captain America]]|volume = 1|issue = 319|date = July 1986|publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref>

[[Arnim Zola]] later created a proto-husk of him only for it to be killed by [[Deadpool]].<ref>''Deadpool'' vol. 3 #0</ref>

The second Bird-Man was among the eighteen criminals (that were murdered by the Scourge) who were resurrected by [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] using the power of [[Dormammu]] as part of a squad assembled to eliminate the [[Punisher]].<ref>''Punisher'' Vol. 7 #5</ref> Bird-Man was seen flying around New York alerting Punisher to his being alive.<ref>''Punisher'' Vol. 7 #7</ref> Bird-Man is seen rescuing the [[Human Fly (comics)|Human Fly]] from being beaten by the Punisher.

==Powers and abilities==
Originally, Hawk had no superhuman powers. He was an athletic man who wore a costume which incorporated a powered [[exoskeleton]] that amplified his strength sufficiently to utilize the costume's artificial wings to maneuver in flight. While employed by the Exterminator, Hawk wielded a "time-displacement ray" ("T-ray") gun that fired a ray which projected its victim into a limbo-like inter-dimensional void. The gun could thus "displace" a victim for a limited period of time, such as 30 minutes. A ray blast of sufficient intensity could exile a victim to the inter-dimensional void permanently. Hawk was later subjected to an unknown mutagenic process administered by [[Count Nefaria]]'s scientists which temporarily gave him natural feathered wings capable of bearing him aloft in flight and hollowed bones, as well as superhuman strength and enhanced speed, agility, stamina, durability and reflexes.

DiBacco possessed the same abilities as the first Bird-Man, including natural feathered wings capable of bearing him aloft in flight, hollowed bones, superhuman strength, and enhanced speed, agility, stamina, durability and reflexes.
