'''Man-Bull''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] from [[Marvel Comics]].

==Fictional character biography==
'''William "Bill" Taurens''' was born in [[Camden, New Jersey]]. He was hired by [[Mister Kline]] to round up people to test an experimental serum (taken from [[Cattle|bulls]]) made by his agent, The Professor. Although assisted by [[Itch (comics)|Itch]] and [[Freak Face]] his attempts were thwarted by [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]. As a result Bill ended up being a guinea pig for the serum which turned him in to [[humanoid]] bull, thus, Man-Bull was born. 

With his new powers, Man-Bull attempted to take his revenge on Daredevil and the two have clashed on several different occasions. He also clashed with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avenger]] [[Tigra]] in a bar fight. Man-Bull was later recruited by [[Melter]] and [[Blacklash|Whiplash]] to join the [[Death Squad (comics)#Black Lama's Death Squad|Death Squad]] where they ran afoul of [[Iron Man]] at a convention. 

Man-Bull eventually began to turn savage; he lost the power of speech, sprouted a tail, and grew more inhuman. In this state he was encountered by the [[Hulk (comics)#Grey Hulk ("Joe Fixit")|Grey Hulk]]. As Man-Bull continued to deteriorate, he was recruited by the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]] to join his [[Frightful Four]] alongside himself, [[Trapster]], and [[Dreadknight]]. They attacked a rodeo arena and ran afoul of [[Spider-Man]] and [[Turbine (comics)|Turbine]]. 

Man-Bull later regained the power of speech somehow and joined [[Armadillo (comics)|Armadillo]], [[Equinox (comics)|Equinox]], [[The Schizoid Man (comics)|Chip Martin]], and [[Big Wheel (comics)|Jackson Wheele]] at a [[Villains Anonymous]] meeting.

Man-Bull later joined the [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]], [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]], [[Warhawk (Marvel Comics)|Warhawk]], and a number of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents, in raiding an [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|AIM]] facility which was working on a Null android from technology stolen from [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]]. 

Later returning to villainy and now sprouting green-hair, he returned to New York City and fought The [[Thing (comics)|Thing]].
