==Fictional character biography==
'''William "Bill" Taurens''' was born in [[Camden, New Jersey]]. He was hired by [[Mister Kline]] to round up people to test an experimental serum (taken from [[bull]]s) made by his agent, The Professor. Although assisted by [[Itch (comics)|Itch]] and [[Freak Face]] his attempts were thwarted by [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]. As a result Bill ended up being a guinea pig for the serum which turned him in to [[humanoid]] bull, thus, Man-Bull was born.<ref>''Daredevil'' #78</ref>

With his new powers, Man-Bull attempted to take his revenge on Daredevil and the two have clashed on several different occasions.<ref>''Daredevil'' #79, 95-96</ref> He also clashed with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avenger]] [[Tigra]] in a bar fight.<ref>''Claws of the Cat'' #4</ref> Man-Bull was later recruited by [[Melter]] and [[Blacklash|Whiplash]] to join the [[Death Squad (comics)#Black Lama's Death Squad|Death Squad]] where they ran afoul of [[Iron Man]] at a convention.<ref>''Iron Man'' #72</ref>

Man-Bull eventually began to turn savage; he lost the power of speech, sprouted a tail, and grew more inhuman. In this state he was encountered by the [[Hulk (comics)#Grey Hulk ("Joe Fixit")|Grey Hulk]].<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #341</ref> As Man-Bull continued to deteriorate, he was recruited by the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]] to join his [[Frightful Four]] alongside himself, [[Trapster]], and [[Dreadknight]]. They attacked a rodeo arena and ran afoul of [[Spider-Man]] and [[Turbine (comics)|Turbine]].<ref>''Spider-Man: Chaos in Calgary'' #4</ref>

Man-Bull later regained the power of speech somehow and joined [[Armadillo (comics)|Armadillo]], [[Equinox (comics)|Equinox]], [[Hypno-Hustler]], [[The Schizoid Man (comics)|Chip Martin]], and [[Big Wheel (comics)|Jackson Wheele]] at a [[Villains Anonymous]] meeting.<ref>''Spider-Man Unlimited'' #12</ref>

Man-Bull later joined the [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]], [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]], [[Warhawk (Marvel Comics)|Warhawk]], and a number of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents, in raiding an [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|AIM]] facility which was working on a Null android from technology stolen from [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]].<ref>''Wolverine'' Vol. 3 #30</ref>

Later returning to villainy and now sprouting green-hair, he returned to New York City and fought The [[Thing (comics)|Thing]].<ref>''Gravity'' #1</ref>

He later battled Grizzly, who knocked him out and snapped off his left horn.<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' Vol. 2 #13-15</ref>

During the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline, Man-Bull was among the villains analyzed by [[Quasimodo (comics)|Quasimodo]] for [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]].<ref>Dark Reign Files</ref> When imprisoned at [[The Raft (comics)|The Raft]], Man-Bull later fought [[Absorbing Man]] in the Annual Raft Boxing Tournament and lost to him in the final round.<ref>Dark Reign: Lethal Legion #2</ref>
