'''Talisman''' is a fictional [[superhero]] featured in the publications of [[Marvel Comics]].  She first appeared in ''[[Alpha Flight]]'' (vol. 1) #5.  The character was created by [[John Byrne]].

==Character biography==
Elizabeth Twoyoungmen is the daughter of Michael Twoyoungmen, also known as [[Shaman (comics)|Shaman]] of the Canadian superhero team [[Alpha Flight]]. She became estranged from her father at the age of four following the death of her mother following an illness. Michael, a physician, had promised to save her and his failure led Elizabeth to be bitter and resentful toward him.

As a college [[archeology]] student, Elizabeth was excavating the site of the original [[Fort Calgary]] when she discovered a skull. When she touched it an apparition appeared that only she could see. Frightened, she sought out her father, whom she recognized as Shaman despite a spell he had cast to prevent himself from being so recognized. Together they investigated the skull, determining that it was the source of ancient anger or ancient evil.

Meanwhile, a young woman named Emily Strang was tending to her great-grandfather, Lucas Strang, when she was attacked by a mystical force manifesting itself through scrambled eggs (eggs being both a symbol of new life and a symbol of potential life unfulfilled). Shaman and Elizabeth travelled to the site of the manifestation and Shaman seemingly defeated it. However, the force again manifested itself, this time through Lucas, and possessed Emily. As the possessed Emily attacked Elizabeth, Shaman identified it as Ranaq the Devourer, one of the [[Great Beasts]] of the North. Under Ranaq's barrage, Elizabeth found herself growing stronger until she was able instinctively to turn the force of Ranaq's attack back against it. Shaman launched an attack on Ranaq as well and together they drove the beast out of Emily, saving her life. Shortly thereafter, Elizabeth reached into Shaman's mystical medicine pouch at his bidding and withdrew a coronet (later identified as the "Coronet of Enchantment"). Placing it on her brow, she was transformed into Talisman, with the power to manipulate vast magical energies and command the apirits of nature to do her will. Talisman joined with Alpha Flight, only to be horrified to later learn that she was unable to remove the Coronet without enduring unbearable, agonizing pain.

Her natural arrogance magnified by her new-found powers and with her bitterness toward her father rekindled both by his failure to tell her about the Coronet and his failure to save her from being consumed by the Void within his medicine pouch, Talisman became corrupted by her powers. She took the impending birth of fellow Alphan [[Snowbird (comics)|Snowbird's]] first child as her opportunity for revenge on him. She commanded the spirits to lead Shaman to a place of power required for the birth that was also a place of death, intending to let the malevolet spirit trapped there to defeat her father before saving the day herself. However, the spirit trapped there had never truly died and so was beyond her power to bind. Possessing Snowbird's baby and calling himself [[Pestilence (comics)|Pestilence]], the malevolent entity attacked Alpha Flight and tore the Coronet from Talisman's brow. In the continuing battle, Shaman donned the Coronet, claiming the name and powers of Talisman, and forced Pestilence to flee.

Several months later, Elizabeth regained the Coronet and her power as Talisman during a confrontation with the [[Dreamqueen]].

==Omega Flight?==

A promotional artwork of the new set-to-launch [[Omega Flight]] shows a character wearing what appears to be the Coronet of Enchantment and presents some resemblance to Elizabeth. Her membership is not confirmed.

==Powers and Abilities==
Talisman possesses vast supernatural powers, once described as "a mortal channel through which the gods can fight", as well as "a director of forces, not a combatant". Her father, Shaman has stated that her powers when properly developed would rival even that of the Sorcerer Supreme, [[Doctor Strange]]. Primary among her powers is the ability to command the Sprits of the Land, meaning she is literally part of the Spirit World itself. While Shaman could only implore the Spirits for help, Talisman can command them outright. Her other abilities include [[astral projection]], [[exorcism]], matter manipulation, the ablitity to see prophetic visions, [[telepathy]], [[teleportation]] over vast distances, animating the [[undead]], generating [[wind]] blasts and [[lightning]], summoning air spirits, calling forth spirit animals, creating magical shields of light, and generating blasts of magical energy.

All of Talisman's powers stem from the ancient Coronet of Enchantment, which she wears on her forehead. However, even without the Coronet, she has shown to possess the ability to asborb and redirect magical energy used against her, but her powers will always be greater when she wears the Coronet. Talisman cannot remove the Coronet without it causing her severe mental pain, however if someone else wears it, returning the Coronet to the true owner would spare them the pain.

==Other Talismen==
After Elizabeth Twoyoungmen was intially corrupted by her power, Shaman temporarily seized the Coronet of Enchantment, assuming the name and powers of Talisman.

Talisman was also the name of an [[Indigenous Australians|aboriginal]] hero from [[Australia]] who first appeared in ''[[Contest of Champions|Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions]]''. One of the heroes chosen by the [[Elder of the Universe]] known as the [[Grandmaster (comics)|Grandmaster]] to compete on his behalf, Talisman had various mystical powers, including the ability to enter "Dreamtime" by spinning a magical [[bullroarer (music)|bullroarer]].

Talisman was the name of a member of the [[Justice Machine]], a team published by a number of companies throughout the 1980s. He was a mutant with the power of "karma." As long as his cause was just good fortune would favor him and his teammates.
