'''Morgan le Fay''' is a fictional character in the {{Marvel Universe}}, based loosely on the [[Morgan le Fay]] of [[Arthurian]] legend.   In this version of the character, she is the half-elven half-sister of the mythic Arthur. Her elven heritage granted her immortality, and she used this time to master the mystic arts. She occasionally tries to take over the world. She has been an opponent of [[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]], and in the 1970s, she was the major villain in the original [[Spider-Woman]] comic, and was opposed by a reincarnation of her "ancient foe" and former lover of [[Magnus the Sorcerer|Magnus]] and [[Doctor Doom]]. She was a member of the [[Darkhold]]ers for a time.

==Fictional character biography==
Morgan Le Fay was born in Tintagil Castle, in Cornwall, England, in the days of Camelot, in the Sixth Century A.D. She became a high priestess, and the leader of the Sixth Century cult of the [[Darkhold]], as well as Queen of Gorre (a section of Britain).

Morgan Le Fay first projected her astral form from her physical body in the Sixth Century A.D. to the present day. She mentally dominated "Slapper" Struthers, transforming him into the superhuman Excaliber, and directed him to kill the original [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]].<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #2</ref> She sent her astral form to get the [[Darkhold]] from the [[Werewolf by Night|Werewolf]], and battled Spider-Woman and [[Magnus the Sorcerer]].<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #5-6</ref> Morgan later attempted to enlist Spider-Woman in her magical conquest of the 20th Century.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #41</ref> She held Spider-Woman's friends' souls hostage, but her physical body was destroyed in combat with Spider-Woman.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #50</ref>

[[Doctor Doom]] and [[Iron Man]] are flung back in time by the traitorous Hauptmann to the days of Camelot.  During this time, Doom met with Morgan Le Fay to enlist her in helping wrest his mother's soul from Hell.  Le Fay agreed on the condition that Doom become the general of her army, undead warriors of those slain by the sword Excalibur against her half-brother King Arthur.  Iron Man defeated Le Fay, causing her to flee to another realm.  Doom swore vengeance on Iron Man for this, vowing to see the hero dead.<ref>''Iron Man'' #150</ref>

Later, Morgan attempted to possess the body of Spider-Woman, and battled the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], [[Doctor Strange]], and the [[Shroud (comics)|Shroud]] on the astral plane.<ref>''Avengers'' #240-241</ref> Morgan then attempted to possess the body of Lisa Russell, but was repulsed by Iron Man.<ref>''Iron Man'' #209</ref> Morgan then allied with [[Mordred (comics)|Mordred the Evil]]. She dispatched [[Dreadknight]], [[Balor (comics)|Balor]], and other Celtic netherworld monsters against the [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]] and Doctor Strange. She attempted to turn Earth into a dimension ruled by black magic.<ref>''Black Knight'' #2-4</ref>

She served as the villain that reunited the Avengers (ironically, she did so in the manner of [[Loki (comics)| Loki]], the Norse god whose actions created the Avengers in the first place). Using the monsters of [[Norse mythology]], she and Mordred lured the [[Scarlet Witch]] (and a team of Avengers) to [[Tintagel]] in Cornwall. There, she kidnapped the Scarlet Witch and used her reality-warping powers to 'bridge the gap' between her elven magic and an [[Asgardian]] [[doomsday device]] known as the [[Twilight Sword (comics)|Twilight Sword]]. Using the Sword, she remade reality: the world was now a [[Middle Ages]] equivalent of itself, except that she ruled the world, and had done so for some time. However, the Avengers stepped in and freed the Scarlet Witch, thus negating the original spell the others were based on, and restoring reality.

[[Doctor Doom]] is revealed to be in a sexual/romantic relationship with Le Fay, traveling back to the past in order to carry on sexual liaisons with her.  Le Fay has told Doom to bring her back something "of value" as a gift the next time he comes to her time or not come back at all. He later returns, asking for her help in creating an army of loyal in-human warriors. She asks what she gets in return, to which Doom asks her what she wants, to which her response is currently unknown as Doom reappears in the present with his army of [[Mindless Ones]].  Later, Le Fay is seen sadly looking out her window for the return of Doom, who has been defeated and incarcerated by the [[Mighty Avengers]].<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #9</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Morgan le Fay possesses a natural affinity for magical forces which is a result of her half-faeries genetic structure. She also possesses a gifted intellect, and as a former pupil of [[Merlin (Marvel Comics)|Merlin]], she possesses a great deal of magical lore. She possesses the ability to manipulate the forces of magic for a variety of effects, including mind control, illusion-casting, astral projection, the projection of mystical bolts of force, creation of mystic force shields, the removal of spirits from their physical bodies and mental domination of those spirits, healing, and the ability to mentally manipulate the natural environment of Earth and the astral plane on which she presently exists. In her physical form, she was able to fly and change her shape into that of other people or animals.

Due to her hybrid nature (half-human and half-faerie), Morgan Le Fay has the faerie's vulnerability to "cold iron" or steel. These materials can cause her harm both in her physical form and astral form.
