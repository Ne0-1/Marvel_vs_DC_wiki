'''Morgan le Fay''' is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character, created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Joe Maneely]], is loosely based on the [[Morgan le Fay]] of [[Arthurian]] legend. In this version of the character, she is the half-faerie half-sister of the mythic [[King Arthur (Marvel Comics)|King Arthur]]. Her elven heritage granted her immortality, and she used this time to master the mystic arts. She occasionally tries to take over the world. She has been an opponent of [[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]], and in the 1970s, she was the major villain in the original [[Spider-Woman]] comic, and was opposed by a reincarnation of her "ancient foe" [[Magnus the Sorcerer|Magnus]]. She is a former lover of [[Doctor Doom]], and was a member of the [[Darkhold]]ers for a time.

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=April 2010}}
Morgan le Fay first appeared in [[Atlas Comics]] in ''Black Knight'' #1 (May 1955), written by [[Stan Lee]] and illustrated by [[Joe Maneely]]. She was introduced into Marvel Comics in ''Spider-Woman'' #2 (May 1978).

==Fictional character biography==
===Medieval times===
Morgan Le Fay was born in Tintagel Castle, in Cornwall, England, in the days of Camelot, in the Sixth Century A.D. She became a high priestess, and the leader of the Sixth Century cult of the [[Darkhold]], as well as Queen of Gorre (a section of Britain). She and the rest of the cult used the Darkhold to summon its author [[Chthon (Marvel Comics)|Chthon]]. When they found they could not control him, they sealed the dark god away in [[Wundagore]] Mountain.<ref>''Avengers'' #187</ref> By this time - convinced that Morgan was thoroughly corrupted by evil - her apprentice and lover [[Magnus the Sorcerer]] stole the Darkhold from her.<ref>''Avengers'' #241</ref> She, along with her lover, [[Mordred (comics)|Mordred]], was a nemesis for the original [[Black Knight (Sir Percy)|Black Knight]].

During this time, Morgan Le Fay was visited by a supervillain from the future named [[Doctor Doom]] to enlist her in helping wrest his mother [[Cynthia Von Doom]]'s soul from Hell. Le Fay agreed on the condition that Doom become the general of her army, undead warriors of those slain by the sword Excalibur against her half-brother King Arthur. [[Iron Man]] defeated Le Fay causing her to flee to another realm. Doom swore vengeance on Iron Man for this, vowing to see the hero dead.<ref>''Iron Man'' #150</ref>

===Conflict with the modern era===
Morgan Le Fay first projected her astral form from her physical body in the Sixth Century A.D. to the present day. She mentally dominated "Slapper" Struthers, transforming him into the superhuman Excaliber, and directed him to retrieve the Darkhold from Magnus.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #2</ref> When he failed, she sent her astral form to get the Darkhold from the [[Werewolf by Night|Werewolf]], and was defeated by [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]] and Magnus.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #5-6</ref> Impressed by her mettle in battle, Morgan attempted to enlist Spider-Woman into her eternal servitude, but was denied.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #41</ref> Seeking revenge, she began tormenting Spider-Woman with hallucinations, but Magnus came to her aid, and Le Fay's physical body was destroyed in combat with Spider-Woman's astral form. However, she was able to lock out Spider-Woman's astral form from her physical body,<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #50</ref> and attempted to possess it for herself. She was thwarted by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], Magnus, [[Doctor Strange]] and the [[Shroud (comics)|Shroud]] in a battle on the astral plane.<ref>''Avengers'' #240-241</ref>

Morgan then attempted to possess the body of Lisa Russell, but was repulsed by Iron Man.<ref>''Iron Man'' #209</ref> Morgan then allied with [[Mordred (comics)|Mordred the Evil]]. She dispatched [[Dreadknight]], Balor, and other Celtic netherworld monsters against the [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]] and Doctor Strange. She attempted to turn Earth into a dimension ruled by black magic.<ref>''Black Knight'' #2-4</ref>

===Avengers assemble again===
Using the monsters of [[Norse mythology]], she and Mordred lured the [[Scarlet Witch]] (and a team of Avengers) to [[Tintagel]] in Cornwall. There, she kidnapped the Scarlet Witch and used her reality-warping powers to 'bridge the gap' between her elven magic and an [[Asgardians (comics)|Asgardian]] [[doomsday device]] known as the Twilight Sword.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol 3 #1</ref> Using the Sword, she remade reality: the world was now a [[Middle Ages]] equivalent of itself, except that she ruled the world, and had done so for some time.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol 3 #2</ref> However, the Avengers stepped in and freed the Scarlet Witch, thus negating the original spell the others were based on, and restoring reality.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol 3 #3</ref>

[[Doctor Doom]] is revealed to be in a sexual/romantic relationship with Le Fay, traveling back to the past in order to carry on liaisons with her. Le Fay has told Doom to bring her back something "of value" as a gift the next time he comes to her time or not to come back at all. He later returns, asking for her help in creating an army of loyal inhuman warriors. She asks what she gets in return, to which Doom asks her what she wants, to which her response is currently unknown as Doom reappears in the present with his army of [[Mindless Ones]]. Later, Le Fay is seen sadly looking out her window for the return of Doom, who has been defeated and incarcerated by the [[The Mighty Avengers|Mighty Avengers]].<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #9</ref>

===Dark Reign===
During the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline, Morgan appears in ''[[Dark Avengers]]'' as the team's first nemesis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marvel.com/catalog/?id=11319 |title=Dark Avengers (2009) #3 &#124; Comic Books &#124; Comics |publisher=Marvel.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-28}}</ref> She used a spell to peer into the future and witnessed the formation of the [[Dark Illuminati|Cabal]]. She traveled into the future with an army of demons.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #1</ref> At first, she attempted to kill Doom when he was a child, but then decided to go ahead several decades, so that Doom could fully know why she was going to kill him, choosing after the [[Skrull]] [[Secret Invasion|invasion]] and engaged Doom in magical combat. As Doom begins to lose, a HAMMER soldier calls Osborn, and the Dark Avengers arrive to rescue Doom. The [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] tears off her head, but she subsequently violently reappeared in his place, and took control over the new [[Mac Gargan|Spider-Man]], who attacked [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]].<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #2</ref> She is killed again by the new [[Bullseye (comics)|Hawkeye]], but she reappears again. She and her demons are seen fighting the Dark Avengers, while Doom and [[Green Goblin|Iron Patriot]] travel back in time to kill her in her own time.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #3</ref> However, when they arrive, after an unsuccessful magical assault on the two men (due to the considerable amount of iron in their armor suits, the one substance her faerie enchantments cannot affect), she reveals to Osborn her knowledge that Doom plans to betray her and that if they kill her, it will affect Doom's own lifeline, claiming Doom will fall to his nature and betray Osborn; Doom responds by chanting a spell of a language that even she possesses no knowledge to forcibly send the sorceress into her own enchanted cauldron, despite her screams and pleas. Though Morgan lives, she is sent to 1,000,000 BC where she runs from a tribe of [[Caveman|cavemen]] fighting a ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''. Doctor Doom magically restores Latveria and the revived Dark Avengers head back to America.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #4</ref>

===Avengers World===
In the pages of ''[[Avengers World]]'', Morgan le Fay appears as the ruler of the souls that are haunting Velletai, Italy.<ref>''Avengers World'' #4</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Morgan le Fay possesses a natural affinity for magical forces which is a result of her half-faerie genetic structure. She possesses a gifted intellect, and as a former pupil of [[Merlin (Marvel Comics)|Merlin]] with centuries of study, she is considered one of the greatest sorceresses in Earth's history. Her magical powers are derived from three major sources. Due to her faerie heritage she possesses innate personal powers such as the ability to control minds. She also has the faerie ability to manipulate mystical energy, often through spells and enchantments of ancient Celtic origin, an ability she has honed through practice. She also possesses abilities all humans potentially have, such as the ability to engage in astral projection. Finally, she has abilities as a high priestess of the Earth goddess ([[Gaea (Marvel Comics)|Gaea]]) by invoking her Celtic name, Danu.

Morgan can mystically manipulate both the natural environment of Earth and the environment of the astral plane in which she once existed. She can cast illusions, project mystical bolts (which can affect physical beings and objects even when she is in astral form), create mystical force shields and remove spirits from their bodies and place those spirits under her control. When in physical form, she can fly and change her shape into other people or animals (both real and mythical). She also has healing powers which she might have used on her former foe King Arthur on transporting him to Otherworld.

Morgan can also tap into and manipulate powerful magical energies for powerful feats of magic without having to tax upon her normal magical abilities, such as when she used the power of the [[Norn Stones]] and the Twilight Sword to restructure reality, but needed the Scarlet Witch to bridge her Faerie heritage to the Asgardian magic.<ref>''Avengers'' vol.3, #1-3 (1997)</ref> Morgan has utilized the ''Crimson Bands of Cyttorak'' to bind Doctor Strange and Balor.{{Issue|date=December 2009}} She is also able to time travel.

Morgan is virtually immortal. Her spirit has restored her physical body at the various times it has been destroyed.

Due to her hybrid nature (half-human and half-faerie), Morgan le Fay has the faerie's vulnerability to "cold iron" or steel. These materials can cause her harm both in her physical and astral form.

In ''New Avengers'' #53, the Eye of Agamotto appeared to Morgan, as it considered her a possible replacement for Doctor Strange as Sorcerer Supreme.

===Age of Ultron===
During the ''[[Age of Ultron]]'' storyline, Wolverine and Invisible Woman's plans to kill [[Hank Pym]] to prevent the creation of [[Ultron]] caused an alternate reality in which Morgan le Fay had conquered half the world following a war between Asgard and Latveria and magic has overcome technology. Morgan le Fey later attacks with a swarm of magically-powered [[Doombot]]s. The Defenders fight them with Iron Man controlling hundreds of drones and accusing Morgan le Fey of having sent the time travelers back in time. She claims innocence and then points out to Iron Man how a pair of Helicarriers are crashing into the heart of New York City.<ref>''Age of Ultron'' #8</ref>
