'''Max Modell''' is a fictional character, and as of [[Amazing Spider-Man|The Amazing Spider-Man #648]], he is [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker's]] latest employer and the head of [[Horizon Labs]]. He was created by [[Dan Slott]] and [[Humberto Ramos]].

==Fictional character biography==
Max Modell is the head of Horizon Labs, and Peter Parker's latest employer. Horizon Labs develops amazing technology through the innovation and genius of their employees, and handsomely rewards them for their work. Even though Peter has no set schedule, and is able to work on his time, Max nonetheless begins to notice Peter's absence during emergencies - and comes to the most logical conclusion, which he confronts Peter with: that Peter Parker is Spider-Man's go-to guy for technology. Apparently it would stretch the imagination too much to imagine a super hero like Spider-Man also being smart enough to invent the various types of new armor the webcrawler has been sporting of late. Mr. Modell is fine with this arrangement, seeing as Spider-Man has recently saved all of Horizon Labs during an attack by the [[Phil Urich|Hobgoblin]]; Peter plays along with the story.
