'''Amethyst: Princess of Gemworld''' is the name of three [[comic book]] series published by [[DC Comics]] in the 1980s. The series tells of a teenage girl named Amy Winston who discovers that she is in fact the orphaned princess from the [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]al Gemworld. Amy learns that a evil ruler called Dark Opal is out to destroy her and so travels to Gemworld to overthrow him.

==Publication history==<!--needs splitting into separate fictional biography and publication history sections-->
Amethyst first appeared in a teaser story in ''[[Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' (vol. 2) #298 (April 1983). Her origin began shortly afterward in the twelve-issue ''Amethyst: Princess of Gemworld'' [[limited series]] in 1983, written and created by Dan Mishkin and Gary Cohn with [[Ernie Colón]] as the artist, the initial 12-issue [[limited series]] (identified by DC Comics as a "maxi-series") establishes Gemworld, who Amethyst is, and introduces several of her villains that she will face again later. The limited series was followed by a 1984 [[Annual publication|annual]] issue and a sixteen-issue ongoing series. The ongoing series was followed by the 1986 ''Amethyst Special'' one-shot and a four-issue limited series that ended the character's adventures. The series was oriented initially for younger female readers, but took on a more aggressive and darker tone over time. However, the character re-emerged after 18 years of sporadic appearances in 2005 during the [[Infinite Crisis]] miniseries.

==Fictional character biography==
Princess Amethyst, the daughter of the ruling House of Amesthyst, was left orphaned when Dark Opal of the House of Opal murdered her parents. The witch Citrina whisked away baby Amethyst to [[Earth]] to be raised by the Winston family in safety. 

At the age of thirteen, Amethyst was attacked by Dark Opal. Having been brought to Gemworld, Amethyst discovered her magical powers. 13-year-old Amethyst gained the appearance of a full-grown woman. The most powerful magic users in all of Gemworld are from the House of Amethyst. Amethyst decided to use her powers to rebel against Dark Opal's oppression over Gemworld. Princess Amethyst journeys to make allies among those of the twelve kingdoms who do not support Dark Opal. The first series ended with the defeat of Dark Opal and the liberation of Gemworld, after which Amethyst returned to Earth.

Later, during the second series in 1986, it was revealed that in the aftermath of Dark Opal's defeat, infighting among the other Royal House of Gemworld was occurring, causing friction throughout the other surrounding kingdoms. The Lords of Chaos, seeing this, threaten to overtake Gemworld by capitalizing on Amethyst's absence. It was during this time that Amethyst learned from [[Dr. Fate]] that she was in reality a Lord of Order herself and that her father was one as well. This made her unique among the Lords as she was the only one in creation with a truly human form. Amethyst, after struggling with this revelation, finally accepted her destiny and did battle with the Lord of Chaos known as The Child and his servant, the gemstone golem, Flaw. After defeating Flaw, Amethyst ended the battle between herself and the Child by merging him with Gemworld itself, but in doing so was forced to merge herself with him.

Recently, Amethyst has re-appeared in the DC Universe during the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' storyline. She was first seen battling the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] on Gemworld in ''Infinite Crisis'' #2 and survived the attack. She later appeared among the magical beings who were summoned to reconstruct the shattered Rock of Eternity in the ''[[Day of Vengeance]]'' Special. Amethyst was seen once again in ''Infinite Crisis'' #6 where she and other sorcerers pooled their powers to summon the restored Spectre to [[Stonehenge]]. In the aftermath of Infinite Crisis, all of the other Lords of Order were apparently destroyed by the Spectre, signaling the end of the Ninth Age of Magic. Amethyst is currently the only known surviving Lord of Order in the Tenth Age of Magic.

==Power and abilities==

Amethyst is the most powerful magic user on Gemworld, her power rivaled only by Mordru. She possesses a host of powers, including flight, spell-casting, energy manipulation, matter transmutation and can tap other sources of magical energy to amplify her own powers. She is powerful enough to engage in battle with the Spectre and survive.

==Other versions==
Amethyst appeared in the 1997 "[[Weirdoverse|Convergence]]" [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] that ran through ''[[Fate (comics)|Book of Fate]]'', ''[[Night Force]]'', ''[[Challengers of the Unknown (alternate series)#1996 series|Challengers of the Unknown]]'' and ''[[Scare Tactics (comics)|Scare Tactics]]''. This story depicts an alternate Gemworld experiencing a civil war. Here, Amethyst is portrayed as a villain who wants to unify all the family houses in Gemworld by any means.
