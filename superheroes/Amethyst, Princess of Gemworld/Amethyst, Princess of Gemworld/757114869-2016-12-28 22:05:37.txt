'''''Amethyst: Princess of Gemworld''''' is a [[comic book]] series published by [[DC Comics]] in the 1980s. The series tells the story of a teenage girl named Amy Winston who discovers that she is the orphaned princess of the magical [[Gemworld]]. Amy learns that an evil ruler called Dark Opal is out to destroy her and travels to Gemworld to overthrow him.

==Publication history==
''Amethyst'''s premise was initially pitched to DC comics under the title ''Changeling'', as its main character was left on earth as an infant. This name, however, was then in use by another DC teen hero, [[Beast Boy]]. Dan Mishkin decided on "Amethyst" as a replacement, which in turn inspired the jewel-themed naming of other characters in the series and nature of Gemworld as a whole.<ref>''Amethyst, Princess of Gemworld'' issue 2, page 26.</ref>

Amethyst first appeared as a [[DC Comics insert previews|special insert]] in ''[[Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' (vol. 2) #298 (April 1983).<ref>{{cite book|last=Manning|first= Matthew K.|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1980s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 201|quote = The other-dimensional Gemworld found a new princess in the form of Amy Winston, an ordinary young girl from a distant reality, in the pages of a sixteen-page insert comic by writers Dan Mishkin and Gary Cohn, and artist Ernie Colón."

The initial 12-issue [[limited series]] (identified by DC Comics as a "maxi-series") establishes Gemworld, Amethyst's identity, and introduces several of her recurring villains. The limited series was followed by a 1984 [[Annual publication|annual]] and a sixteen-issue ongoing series. The ongoing series was followed by the 1986 ''Amethyst Special'' one-shot and a four-issue limited series that ended the character's adventures (pencilled by [[Esteban Maroto]]). There was also a one-shot with [[Superman]] in ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' #63 (Nov. 1983).<ref>[http://www.tangognat.com/2010/12/26/when-amethyst-met-superman When Amethyst met Superman]</ref>

The character re-emerged in 2005 after 18 years of sporadic appearances, in the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' mini-series. In June 2012 it was announced that Amethyst would make her debut in the rebooted [[The New 52]] DC Universe as the main character of the new ''[[Sword of Sorcery]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/dc-new-52-four-series-didio-phantom-stranger.html |title=DC Adds Four to New 52, Including DiDio's ''Phantom Stranger'' |first=Vaneta |last=Rogers |date=June 8, 2012 |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/68Jch6vDY?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.newsarama.com%2Fcomics%2Fdc-new-52-four-series-didio-phantom-stranger.html |archivedate=June 10, 2012 |deadurl=no |accessdate=June 10, 2012 |quote=This new series...will launch with the return of Amethyst to the New 52.

==Fictional character biography==

}}
Princess Amethyst, the daughter of the ruling House of Amethyst, was orphaned by Dark Opal of the House of Opal. Following the death of Amethyst’s parents, the witch Citrina whisks her away to be reared in safety by the Winston family on [[Earth]].

At the age of thirteen, Amethyst is attacked by Dark Opal. After her return to Gemworld, Amethyst discovers her magical powers and gains the appearance of an adult woman. The most powerful magic users in all of Gemworld are from the House of Amethyst. Amethyst decides to use her powers to rebel against Dark Opal's oppression over Gemworld. Upon befriending the [[winged unicorn]] Max, Princess Amethyst journeys in search of allies among The Twelve Kingdoms of Gemworld that do not support Dark Opal. She is successful in rallying support from most of the other House and gains friendship in Lord Topaz, Lady Turquoise, and Princess Emerald (Emmy). The first series ends with the defeat of Dark Opal, the liberation of Gemworld, and Amethyst's returned to Earth.

During the second series released in 1986 it is revealed that in the aftermath of Dark Opal's defeat, conflict among the other Royal House of Gemworld causes friction throughout the surrounding kingdoms. The [[Lords of Chaos and Order|Lords of Chaos]] attempt to capitalize on Amethyst's absence and threatens to overtake Gemworld. During this time, Amethyst learns from [[Doctor Fate]] that she is a member of the Lords of Order as her father was. Amethyst is unique among the Lords as the only creation with a truly human form. After struggling with this revelation, she finally accepts her destiny and battles the Lord of Chaos known as The Child and his servant Flaw, the Gemstone [[Golem]]. After defeating Flaw, Amethyst ends the battle between herself and The Child by merging him with Gemworld. As a consequence, she is forced to merge with The Child.

The Amethyst miniseries sees the characters' return from their fates and takes place about two decades later (time passes differently in Gemworld). Lord Topaz and Lady Turquoise are married and have three children: twin sons Wrynn and Donal, and four-year-old daughter Amber. The miniseries also sees the rise of [[Mordru]] in the form of Wrynn when he accidentally summons Flaw back to life. With the help of Flaw and The Lords of Chaos, Mordru transforms himself into a powerful sorcerer. He would become Amethyst's greatest enemy and goes on to plague the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] in the 30th Century.

After his transformation into Mordru, Wrynn sets off on conquest which eventually leads to a confrontation with Amethyst and in which Flaw is destroyed. Amethyst pursues Wrynn across Gemworld where they battle a second time. Meanwhile, The Child has returned and abducted a now adult Emmy from Earth. He plans to use her as leverage for Mordru in order to defeat Amethyst. The ploy eventually fails as Donal arrives to help Amethyst, who is able to temporarily restore Wrynn to his former self. Wrynn begs Donal to free him from Mordru's influence by killing him. Before Donal is able to fulfil the request he is distracted by Topaz's objections. This distraction allows Mordru to regain control of Wrynn and kill Donal. Enraged, Amethyst pulls The Child out of Emmy's body and banishes him back to Gemworld.

In the final issue of the miniseries Mordru is sentenced to banishment from The Twelve Kingdoms of Gemworld following his defeat. Amethyst, dissatisfied with this sentence and angry over Donal's murder, banishes Mordru into Gemworld by merging him with the planet where he remains for many years. Amber is revealed to be Amethyst's daughter, not Topaz and Turqouise's. Realizing that the end of her time on Earth has brought imbalance to the forces between order and chaos, Amethyst charges Emmy with the care of her daughter and takes them both back to Earth. Amethyst then returns to Gemworld and merges with the planet until she would be needed again.

Recently, Amethyst has re-appeared in the DC Universe during the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' storyline. She is first seen battling the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] on Gemworld in ''Infinite Crisis'' #2 and survived the attack. She later appears among the magical beings who are summoned to reconstruct the shattered Rock of Eternity in the ''[[Day of Vengeance]]'' Special. Amethyst is seen once again in ''Infinite Crisis'' #6 where she and other sorcerers pool their powers to summon the restored Spectre to [[Stonehenge]]. In the aftermath of Infinite Crisis, all of the other Lords of Order are apparently destroyed by the Spectre, signaling the end of the Ninth Age of Magic. Amethyst is currently the only known surviving Lord of Order in the Tenth Age of Magic. Curiously, neither Emmy nor Amber have been seen or mentioned since the third miniseries, but are presumably still in existence in the aftermath of Infinite Crisis.

===The New 52===
In 2012, DC relaunched the long defunct ''Sword of Sorcery'' title as part of [[The New 52]] (a reboot of the DC Comics universe) with Amethyst as the lead story written by [[Christy Marx]] with art by [[Aaron Lopresti]].

Amethyst later joins the [[Justice League Dark]] upon being brought to Earth in an effort to reconnect Tim Hunter with magic.<ref>''Justice League Dark Annual'' #1</ref> Amethyst remains on the team in order to recover the portal stone that [[John Constantine]] has stolen. She is told not to trust any promises Constantine has made. Soon after, she has an adventure while exploring the [[House of Mystery]] with her allies [[Black Orchid (comics)|Black Orchid]] and [[Frankenstein (DC Comics)|Frankenstein]]. They destroy several malicious threats that try to devour them.<ref>''Justice League Dark'' #14 (Jan. 2013)</ref>

During the "[[Trinity War]]" storyline, Amethyst is among the superheroes that feels the disturbance in the magical plane when [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Shazam]] picks up Pandora's Box.<ref>''Justice League Dark'' #23</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Amethyst possesses a host of powers, including flight, spell-casting, energy manipulation, matter transmutation and can tap other sources of magical energy to amplify her own powers. She is powerful enough to engage in battle with [[Spectre (comics)|the Spectre]] and survive.<ref>Infinite Crisis #2</ref>
