'''Amethyst: Princess of Gem World''' was a series of [[DC comics]] in the [[1980s]]. They followed the adventures of a young girl named Amy Winston who discovers on her 13th birthday that she is in fact the Princess from a [[magic|magical]] world. Not only that, but Amy discovers her parents that she has known are not her real parents, her real parents are dead, and a dark figure from Gem World is out to destroy her. Now Amy must travel to Gem world, becoming older through the voyage (time moves differently in Gem World) and fight the evil that is attacking her.

Initially Amethyst appeared in a 12 issue [[Maxi-Series]] by DC in [[1983]]. Following from that, there was the sole Annual in [[1984]] and the on-going series that lasted 16 issues. That was wrapped up with the Amethyst Special in [[1986]] and the character's solo career ended in 1987 with a 4-issue mini. 

Unfortunately, the Amethyst series didn't last very long. Over all it was perfect for young girls, but too many writers and too many conflicting ideas have changed the concept over time. Currently, Amethyst has been portrayed rather badly. She's become more aggressive and just darker than she was ever atended to be.

==The Maxi-Series==
Written and created by Dan Mishkin & Gary Cohn with Ernie Col√≥n as the artist, the initial Maxi-Series establishes Gem World, who Amethyst is and introduces several of her villains that she will face again later.
 
The initial Maxi-Series has Amethyst facing against the evil Dark Opal. Amethyst is trained in her powers and learns more and more about Gem World, of which she is apparently the ruler. According to the series, the Amethyst family is the most powerful magical users in all of Gem World. They were the natural rulers until Dark Opal arose and slew Amethyst's parents. After that, the family's friend and a rather powerful witch herself, Citrine, whisked Amethyst off to [[Earth]] to be raised by the Winstons. The problem is that Amethyst was discovered, dragged back to Gem World, and discovered her magical powers. Amethyst, while looking like a full-grown woman, still has the mind of a 13 year old girl, decides that Gem World deserves to be free of Dark Opal's oppression. She tries to gather allies from each of the 12 kingdoms, each named after stones, but some have chosen to ally themselves with Dark Opal.
