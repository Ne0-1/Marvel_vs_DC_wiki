==Publication history==
[[File:Luke Cage.jpg|thumb|left|''Luke Cage, Hero for Hire'' #1 (June 1972). Cover artist disputed.<ref>[[John Romita, Sr.]] credited by [http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=25193 Grand Comics Database: ''Hero for Hire'' #1 (June 1972)]; [[George Tuska]] credited by [http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/powerman.htm#S967 The Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators: ''Hero for Hire'' (1972-1973)].</ref>]]

Luke Cage was created by [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]] and [[John Romita, Sr.]] shortly after [[Blaxploitation]] films emerged as a popular new genre.<ref name="back45">{{cite journal|last= Callahan|first= Timothy|date= December 2010|title= Power Man and Iron Fist|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 45|pages= 3–11|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> He debuted in his own series, ''Luke Cage, Hero for Hire'', which was initially written by Goodwin and [[pencilled]] by [[George Tuska]]. Cage's adventures were set in a grungier, more crime-dominated [[New York City]] than that inhabited by other Marvel superheroes of the time.<ref name="back45"/> The series was retitled to ''Power Man'' with issue #17.

As the Blaxploitation genre's popularity faded, Cage became unable to support his own series and was paired with another superhero whose popularity was based on a declining film genre, the [[martial arts]] hero [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], in an effort to save both characters from cancellation.<ref name="back45"/> Though the series title would remain ''Power Man'' in the indicia for a while longer, with issue #50 (April 1978) the cover title became ''[[Power Man and Iron Fist]]''. It would remain thus until the series's cancellation with issue #125 (September 1986). The series's final writer, [[James Owsley]], attempted to shed Cage's Blaxploitation roots by giving him a larger vocabulary and reducing usage of his [[catchphrase]], "Sweet Christmas!".<ref name="back45"/>

In 1992, Cage was relaunched in a new series, simply titled ''Cage'', set primarily in Chicago. The revived series updated the character for the Nineties, with Cage symbolically destroying his original costume on the cover of the first issue. The series was cancelled after twenty issues; the entire run was written by [[Marcus McLaurin|Marc McLaurin]]. Cage received exposure in other books at the time, including his own serial in the anthology series ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]''. In the aftermath of the "[[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]]" and "[[Heroes Reborn (comics)|Heroes Reborn]]" storylines, Cage was included in the series ''[[Heroes for Hire]]'', written by [[John Ostrander]], which lasted 19 issues.

Subsequently, Cage was featured in the [[Brian Michael Bendis]]-written series ''[[Alias (comics)|Alias]]'', ''[[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]]'', ''[[The Pulse (comics)|The Pulse]]'', ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]'', and ''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]''.

In 2010, Cage became a regular character in ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'', starting with issue #144,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Arrant|first1=Chris|title=Luke Cage Powers Into Thunderbolts as Heroic Age Leader|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/Thunderbolts-Luke-Cage-100209.html|website=Newsarama|accessdate=29 July 2014|date=February 9, 2010}}</ref> and continued as leader of the team when the title transitioned into ''Dark Avengers'' beginning with issue #175. Cage also reappeared as a regular character in the second volume of ''New Avengers'' series.<ref>{{cite web|title=Luke Cage Is a New Avenger Again|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=25026|website=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=29 July 2014|date=March 1, 2010}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==

===Origin===
Born and raised in [[New York City]]'s [[Harlem]] neighborhood, Lucas spends his youth in a gang called the Rivals. With his friend [[Diamondback (comics)#Willis Stryker|Willis Stryker]], he fights the rival gang the Diablos and commits petty crimes, often on the behalf of deformed mobster Sonny "Hammer" Caputo.<ref name = "CageMAX">{{Cite comic|writer = Brian Azzarello|penciller = Richard Corben|inker = Richard Corben|colorist = Jose Villarrubia|letterer = RS and Comicraft's Wes Abbott|editor = Axel Alonso||title = Cage|volume = 2|issue = #1-5|date = March 2002 - September 2002|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> In and out of juvenile homes throughout his teens, Lucas dreams of becoming a major New York racketeer until he finally realizes how his actions are hurting his family. He seeks to better himself as an adult by finding legitimate employment. Meanwhile, Stryker rises through the ranks of crime, but the two men remain friends. When Stryker's activities anger the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] / Syndicate, he is badly beaten in a mob hit, saved only by Lucas's intervention. When Stryker's girlfriend, Reva Connors, breaks up with him in fear of his violent work, she seeks solace with Lucas. Stryker is convinced that Lucas is responsible for the breakup, so he plants heroin in Lucas's apartment and tips off the police. Lucas is arrested and sent to prison where contact with his family is sparse due to the resentment of his brother James Jr., who intercepts Lucas's letters to their father James and eventually leads each to believe the other is dead.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Lucas is consumed by rage over Stryker's betrayal and his father's supposed death, engaging in frequent brawls and escape attempts. Eventually transferred to Seagate Prison off the coast of Georgia, he becomes the favorite target of sadistic guard Albert "Billy Bob" Rackham, whose brutality ultimately leads to a demotion that he blames on Lucas. Later, research scientist Dr. Noah Burstein recruits Lucas as a volunteer for experimental cell regeneration based on a variant of the Super-Soldier process he had previously used to empower [[Warhawk (Marvel Comics)|Warhawk]]. Burstein immerses Lucas in an electrical field conducted by an organic chemical compound; when he leaves Lucas unattended, Rackham alters the experiment's controls, hoping to maim or kill Lucas. Lucas' treatment is accelerated past its intended limits, inducing body-wide enhancements that give him superhuman strength and durability. He uses his new power to escape Seagate and makes his way back to New York, where a chance encounter with criminals inspires him to use his new powers for profit.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Adopting the alias Luke Cage and donning a distinctive costume, he launches a career as a Hero for Hire, helping anyone who can meet his price. He soon establishes an office above [[Times Square]]'s Gem Theater, where he befriends film student D. W. Griffith.<ref name="mnyc">{{cite book | last = Sanderson | first = Peter | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | year = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 74–75 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-4165-3141-6}}</ref> Burstein, aware of his friend's innocence, also relocates to New York and opens a medical clinic, assisted by Dr. [[Claire Temple]], whom Cage begins dating. Although Cage is content to battle strictly conventional criminals, he soon learns that New York is hardly the place to do so. Stryker himself has become a Maggia agent known as Diamondback and dies battling Cage.<ref>''Hero for Hire'' #1-2</ref> Subsequent opponents included [[Gideon Mace]], an embittered veteran seeking a U.S. takeover; [[Chemistro]] (Curtis Carr), whose Alchemy Gun is a weapon later used by others, including his brother after Curtis reformed; and [[Discus (comics)|Discus]], [[Stiletto (comics)|Stiletto]], Shades, and Commanche, all criminals with ties to Cage's prison days who face him repeatedly over the years.

===Superhero ties===
Although Cage has little in common with most of New York's other superhumans, an ill-conceived attempt to collect a fee from a reneging [[Doctor Doom]] leads him to befriend the [[Fantastic Four]].<ref>''Hero for Hire'' #9, 1973</ref> Via a later retcon, Cage also befriends [[Jessica Jones]], a young woman whose superhuman strength and unconventional style match his own.{{issue|date=July 2014}} During a mission in which Cage and [[Iron Man]] track down Orville Smythe, who had duped him into stealing an experimental starsuit from [[Stark Enterprises#Stark International|Stark International]], Cage follows the example of his new peers and takes the codename of Power Man.<ref>''Power Man'' #17</ref> Cage battles a rogue [[Erik Josten]] for the use of the Power Man name, winning the right.<ref>''Power Man'' #21</ref>

Shortly afterward, Luke Cage begins associating with the loose-knit super-team the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], alongside whom he battles the [[Wrecking Crew (comics)|Wrecking Crew]]<ref>''Defenders'' #17-19</ref> and the [[Sons of the Serpent]].<ref>''Defenders'' #24-25</ref> Called to assist the Defenders against the [[Plantman]], Cage begins to complain that his participation in their group is interfering with his paying work. Wealthy Defenders member [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Nighthawk]] solves this problem by placing Power Man on retainer, giving Luke a steady paycheck for his Defenders activities. For some time thereafter, Power Man serves as a core member of the Defenders. Together, they defeat minor threats including the [[Eel (comics)|Eel]] and the [[Porcupine (comics)|Porcupine]], and major menaces such as the [[Headmen]], [[Nebulon (comics)|Nebulon]], Egghead's [[Emissaries of Evil]], and the Red Rajah; but Cage feels out of place in the often-bizarre exploits of the Defenders and eventually resigns.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

===Power Man and Iron Fist===
{{Main|Power Man and Iron Fist}}

Having obtained proof of Cage's innocence in his original drug charges, the criminal [[Bushmaster (Marvel Comics)#John McIver|Bushmaster]] abducts Burstein and Temple, using their safety and the hope of acquittal to blackmail Cage into abducting detective [[Misty Knight]], who humiliated Bushmaster in an earlier encounter. Cage's efforts lead to a fight with Knight's boyfriend, the martial artist [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], who had spent most of his life in the extra-dimensional city of [[K'un-L'un]] and was unfamiliar with Earth society. Upon learning of Cage's situation, Iron Fist and Knight help him defeat Bushmaster and rescue his friends.<ref>''Power Man'' #48-49</ref> Cleared of criminal charges, Power Man legally changes his name to "Lucas Cage".<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #50</ref> He briefly works for Knight's detective agency, Nightwing Restorations, but soon elects to join Iron Fist in a two-man team, [[Heroes for Hire]],<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #54</ref> founded by attorney Jeryn Hogarth and staffed by administrative wunderkind Jennie Royce. Although the streetwise Power Man and the unworldly Iron Fist seem to have little in common, they soon become the best of friends. Cage's relationship with Claire Temple proves less durable, and he instead begins dating model Harmony Young.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Power Man and Iron Fist achieve great success with Heroes for Hire, earning an international reputation and fighting a wide variety of criminals. They have several struggles involving the nations of Halwan and Murkatesh, including incarnations of [[Scimitar (Marvel Comics)|Scimitar]] and the Black Tiger. Their partnership's downfall begins when the mysterious government agency S.M.I.L.E. manipulates Power Man and Iron Fist into the employment of Consolidated Conglomerates, Inc.; during their first CCI assignment, Iron Fist suffers [[radiation poisoning]]. Cage takes him to K'un-Lun for treatment. Iron Fist apparently recovers, and soon after their return to the outside world, he encounters a young boy named Bobby. Bobby can change the molecular structure of his body because of a meteorite that fell from the sky, granting him superhuman powers and calling himself Captain Hero. The meteorite that gave him the powers also gave him a deadly spore that was killing him. During a painful episode caused by his illness, Bobby transforms into Captain Hero and pummels Iron Fist, apparently killing him. Cage is charged with the murder of Iron Fist and flees.<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #125</ref>

===Chicago===
A fugitive again, Cage breaks contact with his New York friends and relocates to Chicago,<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #82</ref> but, with Hogarth's help, he is cleared of criminal charges when Iron Fist turns up alive.{{Issue|date=March 2010}} Cage discovers that Iron Fist had been replaced by a doppelganger of the plantlike [[H'ylthri]] race, K'un-Lun's ancient enemies during his treatment. This doppelganger's existence and destruction at the hands of the Super-Skrull are part of a bizarre scheme engineered by Iron Fist's enemy, [[Master Khan]].{{Issue|date=March 2010}}

Wanting a new start after his murder charge is dropped, Cage abandons his Power Man guise and begins operating out of Chicago as the plainclothes Luke Cage, Hero for Hire; he makes arrangements with the ''Chicago Spectator'' for exclusive reports of his adventures and frequently works with detective [[Dakota North (comics)|Dakota North]]. On his first mission in Chicago, he assists the [[Punisher]] in battling drug dealers.<ref>''Punisher'' #60-62</ref> Cage attracts the interest of the refined assassin [[Hardcore (comics)|Hardcore]], an employee of Cruz Bushmaster, son of the villain whose defeat cleared Cage's name the first time.<ref>''Cage'' #1</ref> Cage learns that Cruz, following in his father's extortion footsteps, has abducted Noah Burstein's wife Emma to force the scientist to recreate the process that had empowered Cage. Cruz undergoes the procedure himself, but the elder Bushmaster drains the power from his son, reversing his near-catatonia and declaring himself the Power Master. Cage teams with Iron Fist to thwart their plans, freeing the Bursteins while the Bushmasters apparently perish. Cage's power is augmented further by exposure to the Power Man virus.<ref>''Cage'' #6</ref>

While Cage tries to locate his surviving family members with the aid of Dakota North, his brother keeps moving his father around to keep Cage away from them. James, Jr., is eventually recruited by the criminal [[Corporation (comics)|Corporation]], whose power-enhancing scientist Doctor [[Karl Malus]] mutates him into the superhuman [[Coldfire (comics)|Coldfire]]. As Coldfire, James, Jr., hopes to be a match for his brother, whom he regards as a threat. Though James, Jr. works with the Corporation quite willingly, Malus has James, Sr. held hostage as extra insurance of Coldfire's cooperation. When Cage learns the Corporation is holding his family, he invades their headquarters and battles Coldfire. The brothers ultimately join forces to rescue their father from Malus, and Coldfire sacrifices himself to destroy the Corporation's headquarters.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

===Heroes for Hire return===

A few months later, Cage investigates the murder of Harmony Young and fights her killer, the demon Darklove, alongside [[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]].<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #131-136 (June–September 1993)</ref> The mystic [[Doctor Druid]] recruits Cage to serve in his [[Defenders (comics)#Secret Defenders|Secret Defenders]] against the sorcerer Malachi. Cage returns to New York and, deciding his heart is no longer in superheroics, becomes co-owner of the Gem Theater with his friend D.W. Griffith. Even an invitation from Iron Fist to join a new and expanded Heroes for Hire fails to interest him; yet when the [[Master of the World (comics)|Master of the World]] tries to recruit Cage as a spy within Iron Fist's team, destroying Cage's theater in the process, a curious Cage plays along. Cage joins Heroes for Hire and serves with them for some time while reporting to the Master. Cage begins to sympathize with the more benevolent aspects of the Master's goals, but in the end, Cage can neither betray Iron Fist nor reconcile himself to the tremendous loss of life the Master's plans of conquest will entail, and he helps Heroes for Hire destroy the Master of the World's plans. Cage remains with the group thereafter, and dates a fellow member, the [[She-Hulk]]. When the Stark-Fujikawa Corporation buys out Heroes for Hire, Cage and [[Ant-Man]] are fired because of their prison records, and the rest of the team quits in protest.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Cage, bitten by the hero bug once more, continues to share adventures with Iron Fist and other heroes. Briefly resuming his Power Man identity, he is hired by Moon Knight to join an unnamed team of street-level New York vigilantes, but mere days after he joins, the group dissolves following clashes with the forces of [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]] and [[Fu Manchu]]. Deciding that a return to basics is in order, he re-establishes his Hero for Hire activities, intervening in a gang war between Tombstone, Sonny "Hammer" Caputo,  and Clifford "Clifto" Townsend,<ref name = "CageMAX"/> and soon learns that, despite his international fame, he is almost forgotten on the streets where he originally made his reputation. He invests his money in a bar and sets about ridding his immediate neighborhood of criminal elements, deciding that the business of world-saving is best left to others.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

===Jessica Jones and the New Avengers===
After a one-night stand with a drunken [[Jessica Jones]], now a private investigator, Cage's life is briefly thrown into disarray by Jones's reaction to the fling.{{Issue|date=January 2011}} The two make peace while working as bodyguards for [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Matt Murdock]].{{Issue|date=January 2011}} Cage extends emotional support to Jones when she is forced to revisit past abuses by the villainous [[Purple Man]], and Cage's feelings for her grow.{{Issue|date=January 2011}} When Jones reveals that she is pregnant from their tryst, she and Cage move in together.{{Issue|date=January 2011}} Soon afterward, Jones becomes a superhuman consultant with the ''Daily Bugle''.{{Issue|date=January 2011}} After she is attacked by the [[Green Goblin]] during a ''Bugle'' investigation, Cage, helped by Spider-Man, deliberately attacks Norman Osborn in order to provoke him into revealing he is the Goblin.<ref>''The Pulse'' #5</ref>

Months afterwards, Cage is present at the breakout at the supervillain prison '[[The Raft (comics)|The Raft]]' and becomes a founding member of the re-formed [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>''New Avengers'' #1</ref> Luke and Jessica Jones then have a daughter, whom they named Danielle, in honor of [[Danny Rand]].<ref>''New Avengers'' #34</ref> Soon thereafter, he and Jessica are married.<ref>''New Avengers Annual'' #1</ref>

After the [[Superhuman Registration Act]] is enacted, Cage refuses to register, comparing the act to [[Jim Crow laws]]. He sends Jessica and his newborn daughter away to [[Canada]] where they can be safe, though he himself refuses to leave. [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] forces come to arrest Cage. He fights his way to safety with the help of [[Captain America]], the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], and [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] (posing as [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]), and joins Captain America's "Secret Avengers".<ref>''New Avengers'' #22</ref> He fights alongside them in opposition to the act until Captain America surrenders to U.S. authorities.<ref>''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' #7</ref>

Cage does not comply with the amnesty offered to the Secret Avengers, going underground and reforming the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] alongside [[Spider-Man]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], and [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Luke assumes leadership of the New Avengers after the assassination of Captain America, with the team now operating underground and provided with secure accommodation by [[Doctor Strange]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Following a [[Skrull]] invasion, Captain America (James "Bucky" Barnes) organizes a meeting with the New Avengers at his home, offering it as a base of operations.<ref>''New Avengers'' #48</ref> Cage is offered the role as leader of the New Avengers, but turns it down, giving the role to [[Hawkeye (comics)|Ronin]].<ref>''New Avengers'' #51</ref>

===Thunderbolts===
Following the Siege of Asgard, Steve Rogers appoints Luke Cage leader of the Thunderbolts program. Soon after, he begins to recruit new Thunderbolts, a balanced mix of former and older members, personally inducting the [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]], [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]], the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] and [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]], with [[Abner Jenkins|MACH-V]], [[Fixer (comics)#Fixer.2FTechno|Fixer]] and [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]]'s cooperation, and using the [[Man-Thing]]'s powers for long-distance transportation.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #144 (2010)</ref>

===Reforming the Avengers===
To convince Cage to rejoin the Avengers, Steve Rogers and Tony Stark sell the newly renovated mansion to Luke Cage for a dollar, allowing him freedom to recruit his own Avengers team and operate without directly taking orders from Rogers, though Rogers insists on having [[Victoria Hand]] join them as a liaison. Cage and his team are forced to assist [[Doctor Strange]], [[Daimon Hellstrom]], and [[Brother Voodoo]] in thwarting an attempt by Agamotto - the original owner of the [[Eye of Agamotto]] - to destroy existence, culminating in the apparent death of Brother Voodoo.<ref>''Heroic Age: New Avengers'' #1-#6</ref> Although initially against the idea of being paid for being on the team, Cage is convinced to accept the offer.<ref>''New Avengers'' #7</ref>

Following his imprisonment on Utopia,<ref>''New Avengers'' #28</ref> he decides, following a conversation with [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], to resign from his Avenger duties to ensure the security of his wife and child.<ref>''New Avengers'' #30</ref> After the X-Men are defeated, Cage, Jessica, [[Squirrel Girl]], and Iron Fist resign from the Avengers.<ref>''New Avengers'' (vol. 2) #34</ref>

===Marvel NOW!===
During the series ''[[The Superior Spider-Man]]'', Cage assembles an incarnation of the Mighty Avengers, and officially declares the new assembled group to be Avengers.<ref>[[Slott, Dan]] (w). ''Mighty Avengers'' Vol. 2 #1-3. Marvel Comics</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Luke Cage possesses superhuman strength and stamina, and has extremely dense skin and muscle tissue, which render him highly resistant to physical injury. Cage possesses these abilities as a result of a [[Regeneration (biology)|cellular-regeneration]] experiment which fortified the various tissues of his body. His skin can resist high-caliber bullets, puncture wounds, corrosives, biological attacks, and extreme temperatures and pressures without sustaining damage.<ref name="New Avengers #7">New Avengers #7</ref> A second exposure to said experiments further enhanced his strength and durability.<ref name="Cage #5-8">''Cage'' #5 - 8</ref>

The same experiment which granted him his great strength and durability has also given him a faster-than-normal recovery time from injury.<ref>''Civil War:'' Battle Damage Report (March 2007)</ref>

Luke Cage is an exceptional street fighter and was a gifted athlete before receiving superhuman abilities. He has also studied martial arts under [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]]'s instruction, learning how to couple leverage with his strength in order to increase his combat effectiveness against more powerful opponents.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

He owns a jacket that is as durable as his skin, having been exposed to the "Power Man" treatment during his second exposure.<ref name="Cage #5-8"/>
