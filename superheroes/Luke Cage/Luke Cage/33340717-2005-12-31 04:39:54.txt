'''Luke Cage''', a.k.a. '''Power Man''' (birth name Carl Lucas), is a [[comic book]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  He was the first [[African-American]] character to receive his own comic book series, which was Marvel's entry into the 1970s [[blaxploitation]] trend.  He first appeared in ''Luke Cage, Hero for Hire'' #1 (June 1972).

==History==

Luke Cage was a street tough who was framed and imprisoned for a crime he didn't commit.  While in prison, he was given the opportunity to undergo dangerous scientific experiments that would, if successful, grant him [[superhuman]] strength and endurance.  He accepted, broke out of jail, and cleared his name.  He then started a [[mercenary]] business of sorts, where he would do good deeds for others for a small fee.  Cage was a typical superhero who displayed many qualities bordering on [[minstrel show|minstrel-esque]]; one particular characteristic of Cage's that remains infamous is his [[catchphrase]], "Sweet Christmas!".

''Hero for Hire'' later changed its name to ''Power Man'', with Cage adopting that name.  Later, the series was suffering from low sales and merged with the equally low-selling series, ''[[Iron Fist]]'', in which Cage and Iron Fist teamed up and founded a new Heroes for Hire agency.  The merged series, ''[[Power Man and Iron Fist]]'', retained ''Power Man's'' numbering, and lasted from #50 to #125, when it and several other low-selling comics were cancelled to make way for Marvel's "[[New Universe]]" line of comics.  ''Power Man and Iron Fist'' also featured the first time Cage was written by a black writer, [[Jim Owsley]] (now known as Christopher Priest).

Cage returned in the comic book industry's "boom period" in the early 1990s, when he starred in the short-lived series ''Cage'', and later resurfaced as one of the principal players of the new ''Heroes for Hire'' series. A later revival in the form of a miniseries also called ''Cage'', written by [[Brian Azzarello]] in 2001, featured a [[controversy|controversial]] "mature readers" version of Cage under Marvel's [[MAX (comics)|MAX]] imprint, in which Cage displayed a [[thug]]gish persona that many fans considered [[stereotype]]d and possibly [[racist]].

Cage was then brought back from obscurity by writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]], who made Cage a major supporting character in the Marvel MAX series ''[[Alias (comics)|Alias]]'', and is a member of the cast of the new series ''[[The Pulse (comics)|The Pulse]]'', both of which feature retired superheroine [[Jessica Jones]], now pregnant with Cage's child, and was recently made a member of the relaunched Avengers under Bendis' pen.

===Ultimate Marvel===
A different version of Luke Cage appears in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe as a member of the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. In this universe, the Defenders consist of several people who want to be superheroes but have no useful superpowers. This version of Cage does not possess superhuman strength or any other apparent powers. He also has a different personality than the canonical Cage.

==Powers and abilities==
Luke Cage possesses superhuman strength, endurance, and resistance to injury as a result of his participation in dangerous (and highly controversial) experiments while in prison. In the begining, Luke Cage had sufficient strength to lift (press) 3 tons over his head. His power has seemingly increased since then, possibly in the 30-ton range. 

This same experiment has fortified the various tissues of Cage's body, granting him a high degree of resistance to injury.  Cage's skin is harder than [[titanium]] and can resist high caliber bullets, puncture wounds, corrosives, and extreme temperatures and pressures without sustaining damage.  Even though Cage is practically invulnerable to conventional weaponry, it is possible to injure him with armor piercing bullets or [[adamantium]] weapons.  The same experiment that granted him his great strength and durability, however, has dramatically, decreased his ability to heal.  His recovery time from trauma is roughly 1/3 that of an ordinary human.

Luke Cage is an exceptional street fighter and was a gifted athlete before he became superhumanly endowed.

==Trivia==
* [[United States|American]] [[actor]] [[Nicolas Cage]], born Nicholas Coppola, took his stage name from Power Man in order to prevent being immediately associated with his famous [[Film|movie]] [[director]] uncle, [[Francis Ford Coppola]].
* American [[heavy metal music|metal]] [[musical band|band]] [[Powerman 5000]] takes its name from Power Man.
* Marvel is expected to release a movie about Power Man in 2006 with [[Jamie Foxx]] as the title character.
