A streetwise youth, the man called "Lucas" was sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. In exchange for parole, Lucas clandestinely underwent an experimental procedure, originally intended to generate immunity to all illness; instead, it inadvertently granted him [[steel]]-hard skin and heavier, enhanced muscle. After escaping Seagate Prison, he forged the identity of "Luke Cage" becoming a "hero for hire," a sort of super-enhanced private detective—although Cage commonly refused money, or simply received none, for cases gone awry (a fair portion, for the unlucky Cage). Later, he formed a business partnership with the [[martial arts]] hero known as [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] in the series ''[[Power Man and Iron Fist|Power Man & Iron Fist]]''.

Cage was one of the first African American superheroes to star in an [[eponymous]] comic book series. (The first [[African American]] [[character (arts)|character]] to do so was [[Dell Comics]]' [[western (genre)|western]] hero [[Lobo (Dell Comics)|Lobo]].) Cage was a groundbreaking but controversial hero{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}. He was Marvel's entry into the 1970s [[blaxploitation]] trend, and much of "Hero for Hire" saw him using exaggerated slang, including the catch phrase "Sweet Christmas!" Brian Azzarello's ''Cage'' series was also criticized for an overly thuggish portrayal of the character.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Subsequently, Cage has been featured in the [[Brian Michael Bendis]]-written series ''[[Alias (comics)|Alias]]'', ''[[Secret War]]'', ''[[The Pulse (comics)|The Pulse]]'', ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]'', and ''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]''.

As of 2010, Cage is the leader of the ''[[Heroic Age (comics)|Heroic Age]]'' era [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], which was formed in the aftermath of [[Siege (comics)|Siege]].<ref><http://www.newsarama.com/comics/Thunderbolts-Luke-Cage-100209.html></ref> He also remains with the New Avengers.<ref><http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=25026></ref>

==Fictional character biography==
{{plot | date=February 2011}}

===Origin===
Born and raised in [[New York City]]'s [[Harlem]] neighborhood, Lucas spends his youth in a gang called the Rivals. With his friend [[Diamondback (comics)#Willis Stryker|Willis Stryker]], he fights the rival gang the Diablos and commits petty thefts, often on behalf of deformed crime lord Sonny Caputo, a.k.a. Hammer. In and out of juvenile homes throughout his teens, Lucas dreams of becoming a major New York racketeer until he finally realizes how his actions are hurting his family. He seeks to better himself as an adult by finding legitimate employment. Meanwhile, Stryker rises through the ranks of crime, but the two men remain friends. When Stryker's activities anger the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] (a.k.a. the Syndicate), he is badly beaten in a mob hit, saved only by Lucas' intervention. When Stryker's girlfriend, Reva Connors, breaks up with him in fear of his violent work, she seeks solace with Lucas. Stryker is convinced that Lucas is responsible for the breakup, so he plants heroin in Lucas' apartment and tips off the police. Lucas is arrested and sent to prison where contact with his family is sparse due to the resentment of his brother James, Jr., who intercepts Lucas' letters to their father James and eventually leads each to believe the other is dead.

In prison, Lucas is consumed by rage over Stryker's betrayal and his father's supposed death, engaging in frequent brawls and escape attempts. Eventually transferred to Seagate Prison off the coast of Georgia, he becomes the favorite target of sadistic guard Albert "Billy Bob" Rackham, whose brutality ultimately leads to a demotion that he blames on Lucas. Later, research scientist Dr. Noah Burstein recruits Lucas as a volunteer for experimental cell regeneration based on a variant of the Super-Soldier process he had previously used to empower [[Warhawk (Marvel Comics)|Warhawk]]. Burstein immerses Lucas in an electrical field conducted by an organic chemical compound; when he leaves Lucas unattended, Rackham alters the experiment's controls, hoping to maim or kill Lucas. Lucas' treatment is accelerated past its intended limits, inducing body-wide enhancements that gives him superhuman strength and durability. He uses his new power to escape Seagate and makes his way back to New York, where a chance encounter with criminals inspires him to use his new powers for profit.

Adopting the alias Luke Cage and donning a distinctive costume, he launches a career as a Hero for Hire, helping anyone who can meet his price. He soon establishes an office above [[Times Square]]'s Gem Theater, where he befriends film student D. W. Griffith.<ref name="mnyc">{{cite book | last = Sanderson | first = Peter | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | year = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 74–75 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-14653-141-6}}</ref> Burstein, aware of his friend's innocence, also relocates to New York and opens a medical clinic, assisted by Dr. Claire Temple, whom Cage begins dating. Although Cage is content to battle strictly conventional criminals, he soon learns that New York is hardly the place to do so. Stryker himself has become a Maggia agent known as Diamondback and dies battling Cage.<ref>''Hero for Hire'' #1-2</ref> Subsequent opponents included Gideon Mace, an embittered veteran seeking a U.S. takeover; [[Chemistro]] (Curtis Carr), whose Alchemy Gun is a weapon later used by others, including his own brother after Curtis reformed; and [[Discus (comics)|Discus]], [[Stiletto (comics)|Stiletto]], Shades, and Commanche, all criminals with ties to Cage's prison days who face him repeatedly over the years.

===Superhero ties===
Although Cage has little in common with most of New York's other superhumans, an ill-conceived attempt to collect a fee from a reneging [[Doctor Doom]] leads him to befriend the [[Fantastic Four]].<ref>''Hero for Hire'' #9, 1973</ref> He is subsequently hired by ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' publisher [[J. Jonah Jameson]] to capture [[Spider-Man]]. Cage, however, comes to sympathize with Spider-Man and forcibly returns Jameson's deposit, earning a place on the publisher's lengthy list of superhuman personae non grata.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #123</ref> Via much-later retcon, as the character Jewel did not exist at the time, Cage also befriends [[Jessica Jones]], a young woman whose superhuman strength and unconventional style match his own. During a mission in which Cage and [[Iron Man]] track down Orville Smythe, who had duped him into stealing an experimental starsuit from [[Stark Enterprises#Stark International|Stark International]] to "test his [Tony Stark's] factory's security system", Cage follows the example of his new peers and takes the codename of Power Man.<ref>''Power Man'' #17</ref> Cage battles a rogue [[Erik Josten]] (Atlas of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]) for the use of the Power Man name, winning the right.<ref>''Power Man'' #21</ref>

Shortly afterward, Luke Cage begins associating with the loose-knit super-team known as the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], alongside whom he battles the super-strong [[Wrecking Crew (comics)|Wrecking Crew]]<ref>''Defenders'' #17-19</ref> and the racist subversives known as the [[Sons of the Serpent]].<ref>''Defenders'' #24-25</ref> When the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] temporarily loses his superhuman powers, Power Man is hired to replace him in the Fantastic Four, but his tenure proves brief after the [[Puppet Master (comics)|Puppet Master]] takes control of him to fight his new teammates.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #168-170</ref> Meanwhile, Power Man continues in solo action against an odd assortment of villains, including the maddened professional wrestler X the Marvel, the uninspired Maggia agent [[Mr. Fish]], mobsters Dontrell "Cockroach" Hamilton and Ray "Piranha" Jones, the racist Wildfire, the vengeance-seeking Mangler and Spear (whose brother had died under Dr. Burstein's treatment), rival crime lords Baron and Big Brother, the obsessive [[Goldbug (comics)|Goldbug]], and [[Zzzax]] the Living Dynamo.

Called to assist the Defenders against the [[Plantman]], Cage begins to complain that his participation in their group is interfering with his paying work. Wealthy Defenders member [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Nighthawk]] solves this problem by placing Power Man on retainer, giving Luke a steady paycheck for his Defenders activities. For some time thereafter, Power Man serves as a core member of the Defenders alongside the likes of [[Doctor Strange]], the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], Brunnhilde the [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]], Nighthawk, and the [[Starlight (comics)|Red Guardian]] (Dr. Tania Belinskya). Together, they defeat minor threats including the [[Eel (comics)|Eel]] and the [[Porcupine (comics)|Porcupine]], and major menaces such as the [[Headmen]], [[Nebulon (comics)|Nebulon]], Egghead's [[Emissaries of Evil]], and the Red Rajah; but Cage feels out of place in the often-bizarre exploits of the Defenders and eventually resigns. He goes on to battle foes such as [[Moses Magnum]],<ref>''Power Man Annual'' #1</ref> and the second [[Chemistro#Archibald Morton|Chemistro]].<ref>''Power Man'' #37-38</ref>

===''Power Man and Iron Fist''===

Having obtained proof of Cage's innocence in his original drug charges, the criminal [[Bushmaster (Marvel Comics)#Bushmaster (John McIver)|Bushmaster]] abducts Burstein and Temple, using their safety and the hope of acquittal to blackmail Cage into abducting detective [[Misty Knight]], who humiliated Bushmaster in an earlier encounter. Cage's efforts lead to a fight with Knight's boyfriend, the martial artist [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], a native of the extra-dimensional city of [[K'un-L'un]] and a newcomer to Earth society. Upon learning of Cage's situation, Iron Fist and Knight help him defeat Bushmaster and rescue his friends. In the course of the encounter, Bushmaster forces Burstein to mutate him as he had Cage, but is nonetheless defeated.<ref>''Power Man'' #48-49</ref> Cleared of criminal charges, Power Man legally changes his name to "Lucas Cage".<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #50</ref> He briefly works for Knight's detective agency, Nightwing Restorations, but soon elects to join Iron Fist in a two-man team, [[Heroes for Hire]],<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #54</ref> founded by attorney Jeryn Hogarth and staffed by administrative wunderkind Jennie Royce. Although the streetwise Power Man and the unworldly Iron Fist seem to have little in common, they soon become the best of friends. Cage's relationship with Claire Temple proves less durable, and he instead begins dating model Harmony Young.

Power Man also helps [[Spider-Man]] battle a tenement fire.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #75</ref> With Iron Fist and the [[X-Men]], he battles the [[Living Monolith]].<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #57</ref> Alongside Iron Fist, he travels to K'un-L'un, and battles [[Master Khan]].<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #75</ref>

Power Man and Iron Fist achieve great success with Heroes for Hire, earning an international reputation and fighting a wide variety of criminals, including the genius [[Nightshade (Marvel Comics)|Nightshade]], the international crime lord Montenegro, [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] and the [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]],<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #84</ref> the third [[Chemistro#Calvin Carr|Chemistro]],<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #93-96</ref> Warhawk, and the drug lord [[Goldeneye (comics)|Goldeneye]]. They have several struggles involving the nations of Halwan and Murkatesh, including incarnations of [[Scimitar (Marvel Comics)|Scimitar]] and the Black Tiger. They occasionally work alongside fellow street-level heroes such as Spider-Man, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], and [[Moon Knight]], but rarely participate in the larger-scale crises that occupy the likes of the Fantastic Four and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. Their partnership's downfall begins when the mysterious government agency S.M.I.L.E. manipulates Power Man and Iron Fist into the employment of Consolidated Conglomerates, Inc.; during their first CCI assignment, Iron Fist suffers [[radiation poisoning]]. Cage takes him to K'un-Lun for treatment. Iron Fist apparently recovers, and soon after their return to the outside world, he encounters a young boy named Bobby. Bobby can change the molecular structure of his body because of a meteorite that fell from the sky, granting him superhuman powers and calling himself Captain Hero. The meteorite that gave him the powers also gave him a deadly spore that was killing him. During a painful episode caused by his illness, Bobby transforms into Captain Hero and pummels Iron Fist, apparently killing him. Cage is blamed for the apparent murder of Iron Fist and flees.<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #125</ref>

''The following passage refers to events in the 1992–1993 series '''Cage''', written by [[Marcus McLaurin]].''

A fugitive again, Cage breaks contact with his New York friends and relocates to Chicago;<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #82</ref> but, with Hogarth's help, he is cleared of criminal charges when the real Iron Fist turns up alive.{{Issue|date=March 2010}} Cage discovers that Iron Fist had been replaced by a doppelganger of the plantlike [[H'ylthri]] race, K'un-Lun's ancient enemies during his treatment. This doppelganger's existence and destruction at the hands of the Super-Skrull are part of a bizarre scheme engineered by Iron Fist's enemy, [[Master Khan]].{{Issue|date=March 2010}}

Wanting a new start after his murder charge is dropped, Cage abandons his Power Man guise and begins operating out of Chicago as the plainclothes Luke Cage, Hero for Hire; he makes arrangements with the ''Chicago Spectator'' for exclusive reports of his adventures and frequently works with detective [[Dakota North]]. On his first mission in Chicago, he assists the [[Punisher]] in battling drug dealers.<ref>''Punisher'' #60-62</ref> Cage soon attracts the interest of the refined assassin [[Hardcore (comics)|Hardcore]], an employee of Cruz Bushmaster, son of the very villain whose defeat clears Cage's name the first time.<ref>''Cage'' vol. 1 #1</ref> Cage learns that Cruz, following in his father's extortion footsteps, has abducted Noah Burstein's wife Emma to force the scientist to recreate the process that had empowered Cage, regardless of how many test subjects suffer in the process. Cruz undergoes the procedure himself, but the elder Bushmaster drains the power from his son, reversing his near-catatonia and declaring himself the Power Master. Cage teams with Iron Fist to thwart their plans, freeing the Bursteins while the Bushmasters apparently perish. Cage's power is augmented further by exposure to the Power Man virus.<ref>''Cage'' vol. 1 #6</ref>

While Cage tries to locate his surviving family members with the aid of Dakota North, his brother keeps moving his father around to keep Cage away from them. James, Jr., is eventually recruited by the criminal [[Corporation (comics)|Corporation]], whose power-enhancing scientist Doctor [[Karl Malus]] mutates him into the superhuman [[Coldfire (comics)|Coldfire]]. As Coldfire, James, Jr., hopes to be a match for his brother, whom he regards as a threat, and he uses his hatred of Cage as a focus for his energy powers. Though James, Jr. works with the Corporation quite willingly, Malus has James, Sr. held hostage as extra insurance of Coldfire's cooperation. When Cage learns the Corporation is holding his family, he invades their headquarters and battles Coldfire. The brothers ultimately join forces to rescue their father from Malus, and Coldfire sacrifices himself to destroy the Corporation's headquarters.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

===''Heroes for Hire'' (the second incarnation)===

''The following passage refers to events in the 1997–1999 series '''Heroes for Hire''', written by [[John Ostrander]].''

{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2008}}
A few months later, Cage investigates the murder of Harmony Young and fights her killer, the demon Darklove, alongside [[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]]. Not long afterward, the mystic [[Doctor Druid]] recruits Cage to serve in his [[Defenders (comics)#Secret Defenders|Secret Defenders]] against the sorcerer Malachi. Cage returns to New York and, deciding his heart is no longer in superheroics, becomes co-owner of the Gem Theater with his friend D.W. Griffith. Even an invitation from Iron Fist to join a new and expanded Heroes for Hire fails to interest him; yet when the would-be world conqueror called the [[Master of the World (comics)|Master]] tries to recruit Cage as a spy within Iron Fist's team, destroying Cage's theater in the process, a curious Cage plays along. Cage joins Heroes for Hire and serves with them for some time while reporting to the Master. Cage himself even begins to sympathize with the more benevolent aspects of the Master's goals, and the Master and Cage seem to become genuinely fond of each other; but in the end, Cage can neither betray his best friend Iron Fist nor reconcile himself to the tremendous loss of life the Master's plans of conquest will entail, and he ultimately helps Heroes for Hire destroy the Master of the World's plans. Cage remains with the group thereafter, and dates a fellow member, the [[She-Hulk]]. When the Stark-Fujikawa Corporation buys out Heroes for Hire, Cage and [[Ant-Man]] are fired because of their prison records, and the rest of the team quits in protest.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Cage, bitten by the hero bug once more, continues to share adventures with Iron Fist and other heroes. Briefly resuming his Power Man identity, he is hired by Moon Knight to join an unnamed team of street-level New York vigilantes, often referred to by fans as the "[[Marvel Knights#Marvel Knights as a team|Marvel Knights]]"; but mere days after he joins, the group dissolves following clashes with the forces of [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]] and [[Fu Manchu]]. Deciding that a return to basics is in order, he re-establishes his Hero for Hire activities, intervening in a gang war between Tombstone and [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]], and soon learns that, despite his international fame, he is almost forgotten on the streets where he originally made his reputation. He invests his money in a bar and sets about ridding his immediate neighborhood of criminal elements, deciding that the business of world-saving is best left to others.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

In the 2001 miniseries ''Cage'', written by [[Brian Azzarello]] under Marvel's [[MAX (comics)|MAX]] imprint, an alternate version of Cage is hired to investigate the murder of a teenage girl and becomes involved in a three-way gang war for control of the neighborhood.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

===Jessica Jones and the New Avengers===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Cagehoenswed.jpg|200px|thumb|left|The wedding of Luke Cage and Jessica Jones. Art by [[Olivier Coipel]].]] -->

After a one-night stand with a drunken [[Jessica Jones]], now a private investigator, Cage's life is briefly thrown into disarray by Jones' reaction to the fling.{{Issue|date=January 2011}} The two make peace while working as bodyguards for [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Matt Murdock]]. Matt's public denial of his Daredevil costumed identity and suing of the ''Daily Globe'' costs him a bit of Cage's respect, calling Matt a hypocrite to his face.{{Issue|date=January 2011}} Shortly afterward, Cage extends emotional support to Jones when she is forced to revisit past abuses by the villainous [[Purple Man]], and Cage's feelings for her grow.{{Issue|date=January 2011}} When Jones reveals that she is pregnant from their tryst, she and Cage move in together.{{Issue|date=January 2011}} Soon afterward, Jones becomes a superhuman consultant with the ''Daily Bugle'', where Jameson's ire at Cage has by no means dwindled over the years.{{Issue|date=January 2011}} After she is attacked by the [[Green Goblin]] during a ''Bugle'' investigation, Cage, helped by Spider-Man, deliberately attacks Norman Osborn in order to provoke him into revealing he is the Goblin.<ref>''The Pulse'' #5</ref>

It is revealed that Luke Cage has been one of the superheroes involved in [[Nick Fury]]'s ''[[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]]'' in [[Latveria]]. With the memories wiped from his mind, Cage is unprepared when he is attacked in his own home by [[Lucia von Bardas]]. Cage sustains internal injuries that prove difficult for doctors to treat since they are unable to perform necessary surgical procedures due to his highly durable skin. Months afterwards, Cage is present at the breakout at the supervillain prison '[[The Raft (comics)|The Raft]]' and becomes a founding member of the re-formed [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] team.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 1 #1</ref> Soon thereafter, following the birth of their daughter, he and Jessica are married.<ref>''New Avengers Annual'' #1</ref> He also meets the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] (revealed to be one of Luke's personal heroes), joining him and several other superhumans of African descent on a mission against vampires in New Orleans.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 4 #10-13 (2005–2006)</ref><ref>In a case of [[retroactive continuity]], this is depicted as the first encounter between Luke Cage and the Black Panther, even though they previously met when all of Earth's superheroes were abducted by the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]], as part of a cosmic game he was playing with [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]].

{{Main|Civil War (comics)}}
After the [[Registration acts (comics)#2006 Superhuman Registration Act|Superhuman Registration Act]] is enacted, Cage and his wife are confronted by [[Iron Man]] and [[Ms. Marvel]], who want them to register. Cage refuses, comparing the act to [[slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] [[Racial segregation|segregation]]. He then sends Jessica and his newborn daughter away to [[Canada]] where they can be safe, though he himself refuses to leave. As midnight strikes and the act goes into effect, [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] forces commanded by agent [[Gabe Jones]] immediately come to arrest Cage. He fights his way to safety with the help of [[Captain America]], the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], and [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] (posing as [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]), and joins Captain America's "Secret Avengers".<ref>''New Avengers'' #22</ref> He fights alongside them in opposition to the act until Captain America surrenders to U.S. authorities.<ref>''Civil War'' #7</ref>

===''New Avengers''===
Cage does not comply with the amnesty offered to the Secret Avengers, going underground and reforming the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] alongside [[Spider-Man]], [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], and [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Luke assumes leadership of the New Avengers after the assassination of Captain America, with the team now operating underground and provided with secure accommodation by [[Doctor Strange]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}} The New Avengers are driven by two goals; to save people "the way [they] want to", and to investigate the reason why the world has been turned upside-down recently. After a confrontation with [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]] and the [[Hand (comics)|Hand]] to rescue [[Echo (Marvel Comics)|Echo]], the team discovers that Elektra has been replaced with a [[Skrull]] some indeterminate time ago, but whether more prominent figures on Earth have been replaced with Skrulls by this point is unclear.<ref>''New Avengers'' #31</ref> However, after returning to Jessica following their mission in Japan, Cage is uncertain about whether she really loves him or if she is merely a Skrull impersonator. The revelation has also made him very suspicious of his fellow Avengers, especially Spider-Man, believing his switching sides during the Civil War makes him a prime suspect.<ref>''New Avengers'' #32</ref> More recently, he names his daughter Danielle, after [[Iron Fist (comics)|Danny Rand]].<ref>''New Avengers'' #34</ref>

==="World War Hulk"===
In the 2007 storyline "[[World War Hulk]]", Luke Cage, along with New Avenger member Spider-Man, tries to aid the Mighty Avengers in the evacuation of New York City. However, he makes it clear that he is not doing this because of Tony Stark's offer of amnesty to anyone who assists in preparations for the return of the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] to Earth, and simply sees this as uniting against a common enemy; in the second issue, Cage is defeated by the Hulk's [[Warbound]] ally [[Hiroim]] the Oldstrong.<ref>''World War Hulk: Frontline'' #2</ref>

After the New Avengers battle and defeat the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s empire, Jessica leaves Luke and takes baby Danielle to [[Stark Tower]] to be registered.

Afterward, another Skrull impersonating Avengers butler [[Edwin Jarvis]] disappears with Luke and Jessica's baby daughter, leaving the couple desperate and upset.<ref name="Secret Invasion #8">''Secret Invasion'' #8</ref>

Following the Siege of Asgard, Steve Rogers appoints Luke Cage leader of the Thunderbolts program. Soon after, he begins to recruit potential new Thunderbolts, a balanced mix of former and older members, personally inducting the [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]], [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]], the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] and [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]], with [[Abner Jenkins|MACH-V]], [[Fixer (comics)#Fixer.2FTechno|Fixer]] and [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]]'s cooperation, and using the [[Man-Thing]]'s powers for long-distance transportation.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #144 (2010)</ref>

====Reforming the Avengers====
When Steve Rogers asks Cage to rejoin the Avengers, Cage and several of the Avengers who opposed the Superhuman Registration Act felt as if opposing the registration act was pointless if they end up working for the government anyway. Steve Rogers and Tony Stark end up selling the mansion (which was recently renovated) to Luke Cage for a dollar, allowing him freedom to recruit his own Avengers team and operate without directly taking orders from Rogers, though Rogers insists on having [[Victoria Hand]] join them as a liaison. While inviting his team over for a discussion, Cage and his team are forced to assist [[Doctor Strange]], [[Daimon Hellstrom]], and [[Brother Voodoo]] in thwarting an attempt by Agamotto - the original owner of the [[Eye of Agamotto]] - to destroy existence, culminating in the apparent death of Brother Voodoo.<ref>''Heroic Age: New Avengers'' #1-#6</ref> Although initially against the idea of being paid for being on the team as it reminds him of the reasons they opposed the Act in the first place, Cage is convinced to accept the offer.<ref>''New Avengers'' #7</ref>

====''Shadowland''====
Luke Cage is amongst the heroes who battle Daredevil and the Hand. Luke Cage and Iron Fist are asked by Steve Rogers, Iron Man and Thor to speak to Daredevil concerning the Hand's martial law imposed in Hell's Kitchen. As the former Heroes for Hire make their way to Hell's Kitchen, they witness Daredevil brutally murder Bullseye.<ref>''Shadowland'' #1</ref>

Luke Cage and Iron Fist later has an encounter with someone who is going by the name of [[Power Man (Victor Alvarez)|Power Man]]. He and Iron Fist discover that this Power Man is Victor Alvarez, a survivor of the building that Bullseye blew up.<ref>''Shadowland: Power Man'' #1</ref>

The day after Bullseye's murder, Iron Fist and Luke Cage are discussing Murdock's actions when they are visited by the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]], who comes to warn them that soon they will need to take Murdock down. Iron Fist later joins Luke Cage and the other street heroes (namely Shang-Chi, Colleen Wing and Misty Knight, with Spider-Man joining later) when talking to Daredevil. When Kingpin unleashes Ghost Rider upon Shadowland, Daredevil suspects them behind Ghost Rider's attack and orders his ninjas to hunt them down.<ref>''Shadowland'' #2</ref>

Following the fight with Power Man, Luke Cage and Iron Fist end up dealing with Dontrell "Cockroach" Hamilton, Comanche, Specs, Señor Muerte, [[Discus (comics)|Discus]], and [[Stiletto (comics)|Stiletto]].<ref>''Shadowland: Power Man'' #2</ref>

Luke Cage is later visited by Lacy Kimbro, who informs him that her son Darris is among the cops that are prisoners of the Hand's Underhand faction (a group of ninjas who are already dead). Luke Cage later calls the Thunderbolts over to the mainland. He informs them that their mission is to locate Darris in the Hand's stronghold, assigning Fixer to lead the group while he goes to reason with Daredevil.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #148</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Luke Cage possesses superhuman strength and stamina, and has extremely dense skin and muscle tissue which render him highly resistant to physical injury. Cage possesses these abilities as a result of his participation in dangerous, and highly controversial, experiments while in prison. The [[regeneration (biology)|cellular regeneration]] experiment has fortified the various tissues of Cage's body, granting him a high degree of resistance to injury via skin that is as strong as [[titanium]] and can resist high caliber bullets, puncture wounds, corrosives, and extreme temperatures and pressures without sustaining damage (It has been noted that he has skin as "hard as steel", but when he went up against an adversary that was going to shoot him with bullets that "can pierce steel", he relates that the "steel" hardness of his skin is just a saying and its much tougher than that{{Issue|date=July 2010}}). Despite this, it is still possible to cause him injury. For example, it is possible to injure him with [[adamantium]] weapons. However, it has been shown that the supernatural fangs of a vampire are not able to pierce his skin.<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist #76</ref>

A second exposure to said experiments further enhanced his strength and durability to current levels. He is described as being significantly stronger than his first enhancement.<ref name="Cage vol. 1, #5 - 8">''Cage'' vol. 1, #5 - 8</ref>

The same experiment which granted him his great strength and durability has also given him a faster than normal recovery time from injury. Cage's recovery time from physical trauma is significantly shorter than that of a normal human.<ref>''Civil War:'' Battle Damage Report (Mar. 2007)</ref> A major drawback, however, to his superhuman durability is that when he does sustain serious injury beyond his ability to heal on his own, medical care is difficult, given doctors' inability to get past his hardened skin, as in the ''[[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]]'' limited series.

Luke Cage is an exceptional street fighter and was a gifted athlete before receiving superhuman abilities. He has also studied martial arts under Iron Fist's instruction, learning how to couple leverage with his strength in order to increase his combat effectiveness against more powerful opponents.

He owns a jacket that is as durable as his skin, having been exposed to the "Power Man" treatment during Cage's second exposure.<ref name="Cage vol. 1, #5 - 8"/>

====Development====
In June 2003, [[Columbia Pictures]] acquired the rights for a Luke Cage movie that would be penned by screenwriter Ben Ramsey (''[[The Big Hit]]'') and produced by [[Avi Arad]] of [[Marvel Studios]].<ref>{{cite news | first=Zorianna | last=Kit | url=http://hollywoodreporter.com/hollywoodreporter/film/brief_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1903480 | title=Col locks up 'Cage' rights | publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=2003-06-05 | accessdate=2006-10-24 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20030609230003/http://hollywoodreporter.com/hollywoodreporter/film/brief_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1903480 |archivedate = 2003-06-09}}</ref> In January 2004, producer Kevin Feige said that the Luke Cage movie would target a 2005 release.<ref name="movie">{{cite news | url=http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0401/14/index.htm | title=Luke Cage Movie | publisher=Comics Continuum | date=2004-01-14 | accessdate=2006-10-24 }}</ref> At Wizard World Los Angeles in March 2004, newly attached director [[John Singleton]] said that the villain [[Diamondback (comics)#Willis Stryker|Diamondback]] would make an appearance, and the director hoped to include other villains such as [[Chemistro]] and the [[Wrecking Crew (comics)|Wrecking Crew]].

And then [finds out] what's really inside him."<ref name="working">{{cite news | first=Larry | last=Carroll | url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1520415/01092006/story.jhtml | title=Tyrese Keeps Working Out In Case Superhero Role Works Out | publisher=[[MTV]] | date=2006-01-09 | accessdate=2006-10-24 }}</ref>
