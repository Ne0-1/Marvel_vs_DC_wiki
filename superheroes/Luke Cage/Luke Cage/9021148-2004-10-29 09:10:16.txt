'''Luke Cage''', a.k.a. '''Power Man''' (birth name Carl Lucas), is a [[comic book]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  He was the first [[African-American]] character to receive his own comic book series, which was Marvel's entry into the [[1970s]] [[blaxploitation]] trend.  He first appeared in ''Luke Cage, Hero for Hire'' #1.

Luke Cage was a street tough who was framed and imprisoned for a crime he didn't commit.  While in prison, he was given the opportunity to undergo dangerous scientific experiments that would, if successful, grant him [[superhuman]] strength and endurance.  He accepted, broke out of jail, and cleared his name.  He then started a [[mercenary]] business of sorts, where he would do good deeds for others for a small fee.  Cage was a typical superhero who displayed many qualities bordering on [[minstrel show|minstrel-esque]]; one particular characteristic of Cage's that remains infamous is his [[catchphrase]], "Sweet Christmas!"

''Hero for Hire'' later changed its name to ''Power Man'', with Cage adopting that name.  Later, the series was suffering from low sales and merged with the equally low-selling series, ''[[Iron Fist]]'', in which Cage and Iron Fist teamed up and founded a new [[Heroes for Hire]] agency.  The merged series, ''[[Power Man and Iron Fist]]'', retained ''Power Man's'' numbering, and lasted from #66 to #125, when it and several other low-selling comics were cancelled to make way for Marvel's "[[New Universe (Marvel Comics)|New Universe]]".  ''Power Man and Iron Fist'' also featured the first time Cage was written by a black writer, [[Jim Owsley]].

Cage returned in the comic book industry's "boom period" in the early [[1990s]], when he starred in the short-lived series ''Cage'', and later resurfaced as one of the principal players of the new ''Heroes for Hire'' series; a later ''Cage'' revival in [[2001]] featured a [[controversy|controversial]] "Mature Readers" version of Cage under Marvel's [[MAX (comics)|MAX]] imprint, in which Cage displayed a [[thug]]gish persona that many fans considered [[stereotype]]d and possibly [[racist]].  Cage was recently a major supporting character in the Marvel MAX series ''[[Alias (comics)|Alias]]'', and is a member of the cast of the new series ''[[The Pulse (comics)|The Pulse]]'', both of which feature retired superheroine [[Jessica Jones]], now pregnant with Cage's child.

[[American]] [[actor]] [[Nicolas Cage]], born Nicholas Coppola, took his stage name from Power Man in order to prevent being immediately associated with his famous uncle, [[Francis Ford Coppola]].

Marvel is expected to release a movie about Power Man in [[2005]].
