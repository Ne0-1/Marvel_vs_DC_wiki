The word '''Femizon''' may refer to one of two groups owned by [[Marvel Comics]] and appearing in their [[Marvel Universe]].

The first group to be called Femizons were the women of '''Femizonia''', a [[Matriarchy|matriarchal]] future world in an [[alternate timeline]] where women had become [[Amazons|Amazon]]-like warriors, ruling over male slaves. It was this world that produced [[Thundra]], a recurring enemy, and later ally, of [[Thing (comics)|The Thing]].

The second group to be called '''Femizons''' was a group of all-female villains in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe.  They were enemies mainly for [[Captain America]], and their goal was to conquer [[Earth]] and create a utopia where women ruled.  Led by [[Superia]], who claimed to be inspired by stories of Thundra's Femizons, the group was comprised of several established female criminals and super villainesses.
