The second group to be called Femizons was a group of all-female [[supervillain]]s in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe. They were enemies mainly for [[Captain America]], and their goal was to conquer [[Earth]] and create a utopia where women ruled. Led by [[Superia]], who claimed to be inspired by stories of Thundra's Femizons, the group consisted of a large number of established female criminals and super villainesses.<ref>''Captain America'' #386-388.
