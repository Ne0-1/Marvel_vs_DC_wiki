The first group to be called Femizons were the women of Femizonia, a [[Matrifocal family|gynarchic]] future world in an [[Alternate history|alternate timeline]] where women had become [[Amazons|Amazon]]-like warriors, ruling over male slaves. It was this world that produced [[Thundra]], a recurring enemy, and later ally, of [[Thing (comics)|The Thing]].<ref>''Savage Tales'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The second group to be called Femizons was a group of all-female [[supervillain]]s in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe. They were enemies mainly for [[Captain America]], and their goal was to conquer [[Earth]] and create a utopia where women ruled. Led by [[Superia]], who claimed to be inspired by stories of Thundra's Femizons, the group consisted of a large number of established female criminals and super villainesses.<ref>''Captain America'' #386-388.
