'''Mahr Vehl''' is a [[fictional character]], an [[extraterrestrial|alien]] and a [[superhero]] in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe. The character is a reimagining of [[Mar-Vell]] (also known as Captain Marvel), created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and penciller [[Gene Colan]].  Mahr Vehl was created by writer [[Warren Ellis]] and penciller [[Steve McNiven]]  in ''[[Ultimate Secret]]'' #1.  He is also known as ''Captain Mahr Vehl,'' and is referred to as "Ultimate Captain Marvel" outside of the comic continuum.

==Publication History==
Mahr Vehl was first introduced in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] limited series, ''[[Ultimate Secret]],'' and is a main character in ''[[Ultimate Extinction]]''.   Created by [[Warren Ellis]] and [[Steve McNiven]], Mahr Vehl is intended to be the Ultimate imprint version of [[Marvel Comics]]' original ''Captain Marvel'' (see [[Mar-Vell]]).  Mahr Vehl, ''Ultimate Secret'' and ''Ultimate Extinction'' are tied into the much larger ''Ultimate Gah Lak Tus'' saga, wherein members of the Ultimate universe first encounter a unique creature that threatens to devour Earth.  The three-part storyline began in ''[[Ultimate Nightmare]]'' (although Mahr Vehl does not appear in this installment).

==Fictional character biography==
As described by writer and creator [[Warren Ellis]] in ''[[Ultimate Extinction]]'' #1, Mahr Vehl is a member of the [[Kree]], an ancient and highly-intelligent fictional race who have mastered interstellar space travel.  He is given the title "Captain" as he is the rough equivalent, a Pluskommander, in the Kree's interstellar fleet, the Kree Void Navy.
Ellis further developes Mahr Vehl's history by including him as a member of the Halason family, who according to Kree religion are God's chosen. Mahr Vehl insists that his ancestor, Hala, was not a God; he merely preached that innocent life was worth saving, a creed Mahr Vehl carries on to this day. 

===A Spy on Earth===

Originally a spy sent to Earth in an attempt to prevent humans from developing interstellar travel, Mahr Vehl soon grows to admire the human race. In turn, he abandons his mission, takes the identity of physicist Dr. Philip Lawson, and aids in the development of an interstellar engineering program.

When the Kree send an attack force to destroy the space engine, Mahr Vehl retaliates by engaging them in combat.  Although he is eventually imprisoned by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.#Ultimate S.H.I.E.L.D.|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] after the battle, he is trusted to go on a fact-finding mission regarding the entity known as [[Galactus#Ultimate Marvel|Gah Lak Tus]].  Along with [[Iron Man#Ultimate Iron Man|Iron Man]], [[Mister Fantastic#Ultimate Mr. Fantastic|Reed Richards]], [[Susan Storm]], and [[Hawkeye (comics)#Ultimate Hawkeye|Hawkeye]], Mahr Vehl uses the back-up ''Asis'' ship to find and board a Kree vessel.  The mission is a success, and the team is able to access vital information on [[Galactus#Ultimate Marvel|Gah Lak Tus]] before the Kree ships explodes in space.

===The Fight against Gah Lak Tus===
Mahr Vehl solidifies his role as Earth's guardian through his attempts to combat Gah Lak Tus and its minions.  He uses his combat skills to defeat the deadly silver sentinels sent to Earth by the approaching threat.  In the final issue of ''[[Ultimate Extinction]]'', Mahr Vehl fights an army of bald, female clones that attack S.H.I.E.L.D.'s home base, the Triskelion.  Although wounded in the battle, Mahr Vehl's actions allow his teammates the opportunity to attack Gah Lak Tus before it reaches Earth.  As a result, [[Galactus#Ultimate Marvel|Gah Lak Tus]] retreats back into space.  Mahr Vehl survives the assault (although he is confined to a wheelchair for a month) and is debriefed with the rest of the team regarding the successful attack.

==Powers and abilities==
Mahr Vehl has had extensive surgery so that he could appear human during his time on earth.  Artist Tom Raney depicts the Kree as [[ichthyoid]] in appearance, with dark purple skin, an extended, serpent-like neck, a head fin, and razor sharp teeth.  They also have extended, four-fingered hands, under-arm webbing, and four-toed, bird-like feet.  Their throats are unable to speak English without surgical modification.  In his human form, he appears to be of average height with black hair and green eyes.  However, Mahr Vehl is implanted with a cybernetic battle suit that can be activated by a device located on his wrist.  The armor itself glows green with bio-electric energy.  The Kree technology in the suit gives Mahr Vehl increased strength and allows him to fly, create energy shields, turn invisible, view different fields of the light spectrum, and fire energy blasts through the ''totalkannon'' located on his lower arm.
