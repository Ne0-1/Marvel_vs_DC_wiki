''Geheneris HalaÂ´son Mahr Vehl'' or '''Mahr Vehl''', is a [[fictional character]], an [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|alien]] and a [[superhero]] in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe. The character is a reimagining of [[Mar-Vell]] (also known as Captain Marvel), created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and penciller [[Gene Colan]].  Mahr Vehl was created by writer [[Warren Ellis]] and penciller [[Steve McNiven]] and first appears in ''[[Ultimate Secret]]'' #1 (2005).  

==Fictional character biography==
Mahr Vehl is a member of the alien [[Kree]], an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] race. He is a "Pluskommander" in the Kree's interstellar fleet, the Kree Void Navy. Mahr Vehl is also a member of the Halason family, who according to Kree religion are God's chosen. Mahr Vehl denies this view and insists that his ancestor, Hala, was not a God - rather simply a man who believed that all that innocent life was worth saving. Although initially a spy sent to Earth in an attempt to prevent humans from developing interstellar travel, it is for this reason that Mahr Vehl abandons his mission. He adopts the identity of physicist Dr. Philip Lawson, and aids the human scientists in the development of an interstellar engineering program at a secret [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] installation in [[New Mexico]].

When the Kree attack the installation, Mahr Vehl is forced to reveal himself and battle the attackers. Although able to successfully defend the installation, Mahr Vehl is rendered unconscious and is eventually questioned by [[Nick Fury]]. Mahr Vehl explains he is a member of the Kree himself, and that they have been observing [[Earth]] to determine if humanity poses a threat to the Kree in the larger [[galaxy]]. Observing mankind's violent nature, Mahr Vehl reveals that the Kree have recently decided to confine humanity on Earth until the entity [[Gah Lak Tus]] can destroy them, so ending the potential threat.  

Another Kree force attacks the installation soon after, but is stopped by a combined team of superheroes. Another team of heroes - with Mahr Vehl's aid - storm the Kree ship while the aliens are on Earth. The commander, Yahn Rgg, activates the self-destruct mechanism, but not before Mahr Vehl hacks into the ship's database and downloads its contents into his memory banks. <ref>''Ultimate Secret'' (#1 - 4, Mar. 2005 - Oct. 2005)</ref> Mahr Vehl later aids the heroes against the "heralds" of Gah Lak Tus, the [[Silver Surfer#Ultimate Silver Surfer|Silver Surfers]]. Mahr Vehl is wounded in battle, but this diversionary action gives [[Mr. Fantastic|Ultimate Mr. Fantastic]] time to use the [[Ultimate Nullifier]], which repels Gah Lak Tus. Mahr Vehl then chooses to remain on Earth, and is given the title of "Captain" by Fury. <ref>''Ultimate Extinction'' (#1 - 5, Jan. 2006 - May 2006)</ref>

==Appearance==
Like all Kree, Mahr Vehl is [[ichthyoid]] in appearance, with dark purple skin, an extended, serpent-like neck, a head fin, and razor sharp teeth.  The Kree also have extended, four-fingered hands, under-arm webbing, and four-toed, bird-like feet.  Kree are also unable to speak terran languages without surgical modification to their throats. In human form, Mahr Vehl appears to be of average height with black hair and green eyes.

==Powers and abilities==
Mahr Vehl's body has been implanted with a cybernetic battle suit that can be activated by a device located on his wrist. In appearance the armour is green and flares with bio-electric energy, and provides Mahr Vehl with increased strength, flight, invisibility, an ability to view the entire light spectrum and the capability to create energy shields and project energy blasts via the ''totalkannon'' on his left forearm.
