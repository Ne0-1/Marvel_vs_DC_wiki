'''Jetstream (Haroun ibn Sallah al-Rashid)''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[Morocco|Moroccan]] [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] character in the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe. He was created for the group known as the [[Hellions]], and his first appearance was in ''New Mutants #16''.

==Fictional character biography==

Haroun ibn Sallah al-Rashid was born in the [[Rif Mountains]] in Morocco.  As Jetstream, he was a member of the original group of Hellions, the trainee group of mutants set up by the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] and led by [[Emma Frost]] to be a rival to the [[New Mutants]]. Jetstream was the [[antithesis]] of [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]], who could also propel himself through the air and was also the team leader. He engaged in several battles with the New Mutants—mostly petty competition—but occasionally got along with the students, sometimes having dances for socialization.

On the first mission of the Hellions, Jetstream helped to capture [[Cypher (comics)|Doug Ramsey]] and [[Shadowcat|Kitty Pryde]] from the [[X-Mansion]]. When the New Mutants came to reclaim their own, the two teams decided to solve the dispute their own way: a duel between Cannonball and Jetstream with the winner getting to keep the captives. Jetstream lost, but Emma Frost returned in time with [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]] to deter the New Mutants from retrieving their friends. Fortunately, Kitty was able to create a diversion for [[Magik (comics)|Magik]] to be able to transport the team to safety.
 
Later, when the New Mutants were in a state of emotional turmoil over being killed and resurrected by the [[Beyonder]], Emma Frost saw it as her opportunity to sweep in and take control. She convinced [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]—the current leader of the team—to allow the New Mutants to come to the Massachusetts Academy for psychic [[psychotherapy|counseling]], where she promptly accepted them into the ranks of her Hellions.  The two teams became quite fond of one another but were separated when Magneto realized that his emotions had been manipulated by [[Empath (comics)|Empath]] to convince him to relinquish the students. 

On the team's last mission, Jetstream went along with the Hellions in order to retrieve former-member [[Firestar]]. They found her in the ranks of the [[New Warriors]] and their leaders, Tai and the White Queen, decide to have a series of fights to see who would get her, whichever team defeated more of the other won. This deal was unknown to either team as they were already fighting. 

Jetstream was defeated by [[Nova (comics)|Nova]] who ended up punching him through a wall. The Hellions, as a team, lost and went home, not knowing that their young lives would soon be over.

Soon after, Emma threw another party which the Hellions as well as the [[X-Men]] Gold team attended. It was there that [[Trevor Fitzroy]]—a member of the villainous group known as the [[Upstarts (comics)|Upstarts]]—crashed the party with the goal of killing Emma in order to gain points within the group. The Hellions were mere formalities: some were killed in the crossfire and the rest, including Jetstream, were drained of their life energies in order to fuel his [[teleportation|teleportation portal]] in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #281 ([[1991]]).

==Powers and abilities==
Jetstream could generate thermo-chemical energy, accompanied by plasma, and release it through his skin. Jetstream could only release this energy beneath him, and the result was that it propelled him through the air like a human rocket. 

However, Jetstream's body was unable to withstand the tremendous energies he generated—one day his flesh even caught fire as he flew. To save him and enable him to use his power, the Hellfire Club provided Jetstream with a bionic system that enabled him to contain, focus, and control his power. Among these systems was a bionic backpack that could fold away into his body which contained computerized scanning devices and aerial navigation.

==Notes==
Jetstream made a [[postmortem]] appearance in the [[1997]] Annual of ''Generation X''. However, this was just a trick played by the [[demon]] [[D'Spayre]] to agitate Emma Frost.
