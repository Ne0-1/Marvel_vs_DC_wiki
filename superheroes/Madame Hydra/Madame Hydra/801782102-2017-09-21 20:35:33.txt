The sixth Madame Hydra was created by [[Bob Harras]] and [[Paul Neary]], and debuted in ''Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #3 (Aug 1988). Madame Hydra received an entry in the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update '89]]'' #4, under the heading "Madame Hydra VI".

This operative of Hydra impressed her superiors enough that, after only a short time in the organization, they promoted her to the level of Madame Hydra VI (The identities of Madames Hydra I through V, who rank above her, are unknown). One of her first missions as Madame Hydra was to capture [[Nick Fury]] and deliver him to the Deltites, a group of artificially created duplicates which were taking over [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] After failing in her mission and discovering that the Deltites were manipulating her, she allied with the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents against the takeover. She was later turned over to federal authorities and was found to be criminally insane, and sent to Arnold Sanitarium for psychiatric treatment (the same sanitarium that Bigfoot was later imprisoned in).<ref>''Nick Fury Vs.
