==Powers==

==Fictional history==
{{msg:spoiler}}
===The Hellfire Club and Massachusetts Academy=== [[Image:Uncanny131.jpg|thumb|left|125px|Cover to Uncanny X-Men #131. Art by John Byrne.]] 

Emma Frost first appeared as the White Queen of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]], a group of superhumans who dressed in [[18th Century]] clothing and plotted world domination. Frost and the Club's agents captured several members of the [[X-Men]]. Frost engaged the Phoenix in a psychic battle, which she lost badly, but recovered.

During her time with the Hellfire Club, Frost also ran the Massachusetts Academy, a school for mutants which served as a counterpoint to that of X-Men founder [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]]'s School for Gifted Youngsters. Frost&#8217;s trainees became the supervillain team the [[Hellions (comics)|Hellions]] and fought Xavier&#8217;s young students the [[New Mutants]]. 

Frost also had a rivalry with the X-Men's [[Storm (comics)|Storm]] for a time, which included an escapade in which their minds were switched between their bodies(''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #151-152).

===Death of the Hellions=== 

In ''Uncanny X-Men'' #281 ([[1991]]), the [[time travel]]ing mutant [[Trevor Fitzroy]] unleashed the mutant-hunting [[robot]]s called the [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]] on Frost and the Hellions. Frost was left in a [[coma]] by the attack and her students were killed. 

The X-Men cared for the comatose Frost at their headquarters. Later, she awoke and possessed the body of the X-Man [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]]. She escaped the X-Men, but she was devastated when she discovered the deaths of her students and Xavier was able to coax her back into her own body.

===Generation X===

Xavier paired Frost with the  X-Man [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]] to mentor the teenage mutant team [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]] at Frost&#8217;s Massachusetts Academy after the two had teamed up to stop the [[Phalanx]]. Banshee never fully trusted Frost, despite an undercurrent of sexual tension between the two, and even some of her students were skeptical of her.

After Frost&#8217;s business ventures took a bad turn, she turned to her estranged sister [[Adrienne Frost|Adrienne]] for help. Adrienne, also a telepath, offered financial assistance but demanded to be co-headmistress of the school. Adrienne secretly plotted against Emma and planted a bomb at the school, which killed [[Synch]], one of Emma's students. Emma tracked down and murdered Adrienne and then returned to the Academy, growing increasingly distant from her students in an effort to hide her crime. This, combined with Banshee's increasing depression and drunkenness following the death of his long-time lover [[Moira MacTaggert]], led the students to leave, disbanding Generation X.

Afterwards, Frost traveled to the mutant haven island of [[Genosha]].  There, Frost ran and taught at a mutant school until a genocidal Sentinel attack killed most the island&#8217;s population. Frost survived only due to her sudden manifestation of her secondary evolution; the power to turn to diamond.

Afterwards, Frost joined the X-Men and taught at the Xavier&#8217;s newly-reopened school. She also began an affair with the X-Man [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] who had became distant from his wife [[Jean Grey]].  She allow started to look after and train a group of telepathic quintuplets known as the Stepford Cuckoos. 

During a riot at the school, one of the Cuckoos was killed and the others left Emma, blaming her for the death. It was soon revealed that one of them, Esme, was responsible for the death. She had been working behind the scenes with Magneto (who would later be revealed to be an impostor of the man). After Esme turned on "Magneto" when he rejected her advances, she was killed by him. The three remaining Cuckoos have thus returned to Emma.

Following Jean Grey's apparent death, Cyclops and Emma became lovers, despite the criticism from their teammates, The two took over the school after [[Professor Xavier]] stepped down, where Frost became co-headmaster with Cyclops and advisor to the new [[Hellions (comics)|Hellions]], one of the many "squads" which have been set up in the student body as part of reforms introduced by her and Cyclops.
