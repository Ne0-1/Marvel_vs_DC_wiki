'''Emma Grace Frost''', also known as the '''White Queen''', is a [[fictional character]] appearing in the {{Marvel Universe}}. Created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist/co-writer [[John Byrne]], she first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #129 ([[1980#January|January 1980]]).

An urbane, [[Mutant (fictional)|mutant]] [[telepathy|telepath]] known for her revealing white attire, Frost has been both friend and foe of the X-Men. She was originally one of the wealthy, mutant elites who comprised the Inner Circle of [[Hellfire Club (comics)|the Hellfire Club]]. She has had a lifelong interest in teaching the next generation and led the club’s junior team the [[Hellions]].

After her students’ deaths, she joined [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]]’s cause, mentoring the X-Men junior team [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]]. She later joined the X-Men and became headmistress of the [[Xavier Institute student body|Xavier Institute]], although her ethics and loyalty remain in question.

==Character history==
[[Image:Uncanny131.png|thumb|135px|left|Cover to ''Uncanny X-Men'' #131. Art by John Byrne.]]
===White Queen of the Hellfire Club===
Emma Frost first appeared as the White Queen of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]], a group of superhumans who dressed in 18th century clothing and plotted world domination. Frost and the Club's agents captured several members of the [[X-Men]]. Frost engaged [[Jean Grey]] (as Phoenix) in a psychic battle, lost badly, but later recovered.

During her time with the Hellfire Club, Frost also ran the Massachusetts Academy, a school for mutants which served as a counterpoint to that of X-Men founder [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]]'s [[School for Gifted Youngsters]]. Frost's trainees became the super-villain team known as the [[Hellions (comics)|Hellions]] and fought Xavier's young students, the [[New Mutants]]. At one point, Frost began privately training a young mutant named Angelica Jones to be her personal [[bodyguard]] and [[assassin]] in reaction to political in-fighting among the Hellfire Club. Jones eventually discovered Frost was manipulating her and broke free from her control to later become the super-heroine [[Firestar]].

===Death of the Hellions===
When the [[time travel]]ing mutant [[Trevor Fitzroy]] unleashed the mutant-hunting [[robot]]s called the [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]] on Frost and the Hellions, Frost was left in a [[coma]] by the attack and nearly all of her students were killed. One of the Hellions, [[Tarot (comics)|Tarot]], somehow returned to life several months later. The two Hellions that managed to survive were [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]] and [[Empath (comics)|Empath]].

It was also during this period that Emma's egg cells were harvested by John Sublime.

The X-Men cared for the comatose Frost at the Xavier Academy. Later, she awoke and possessed the body of the X-Man [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] (Bobby Drake). In Drake's body, Frost made use of his ice powers in ways he had never dreamed and pushed the limits of his powers to escape the X-Mansion. When she discovered the deaths of her students, Xavier was able to coax the devastated Frost back into her own body.

===Generation X===
After being disrupted from her comatose state while the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]] invaded the mansion, Frost teamed up with the X-Man [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]] (Sean Cassidy) in order to stop the techno-organic lifeforms from capturing a select group of teenage mutants they referred to as "Generation X." After their success, Xavier asked Frost and Cassidy to mentor the young mutants. Emma agreed, after resolving that the Hellions might have survived Fitzroy's Sentinel siege had they been exposed to Xavier's teachings as well as her own.

The group of students became a superhero team known as [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]] and studied at Frost's Massachusetts Academy. Cassidy's trust of Frost was intermittent — at times he was suspicious of her, and at others he trusted her implicitly. Her students were also initially skeptical of her. Slowly, the headmistress earned their trust. Around this time, Frost also worked to earn back Firestar's trust.

After Frost's business ventures took a bad turn, she turned to her estranged sister [[Adrienne Frost|Adrienne]] for help. Adrienne, a [[psychometry|psychometrist]], offered financial assistance but demanded to be co-headmistress of the school in return. Adrienne secretly plotted against Emma and planted a bomb at the school, which killed Generation X member [[Synch]]. Frost tracked down and murdered Adrienne and then returned to the Academy, growing increasingly distant from her students in an effort to hide her crime. This, combined with Banshee's increasing [[clinical depression|depression]] and [[drunkenness]] following the death of his long-time lover [[Moira MacTaggert]], led the students to leave, disbanding Generation X.

===Joining the X-Men===
Afterwards, Frost traveled to the mutant haven island of [[Genosha]].  There, Frost ran and taught at a mutant school until a [[genocide|genocidal]] Sentinel attack killed most of the island's population. Frost survived only due to the sudden manifestation of her secondary mutation: the power to transform herself into a flexible, diamond-like substance that provides her near-invulnerability.

Frost then joined the X-Men and taught at Xavier's newly-reopened school and shortly thereafter dropped her "White Queen" codename. She also started to look after and train a group of telepathic quintuplets known as the [[Stepford Cuckoos]], who quickly became her prized pupils. As a member of the X-Men, Frost began a psychic sexual relationship with the X-Man [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] (Scott Summers), who had become distant from his wife Jean Grey as a result of his temporary physical and mental merger with the mutant immortal, [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]].

While quelling a [[Riot at Xavier's|riot at the school]], one of the Cuckoos was killed and the others left Frost, blaming her for the death. In the [[Murder At The Mansion|aftermath of the riot]], Jean Grey discovered Frost and Summers' affair, became enraged and confronted Frost.  Unleashing her re-ignited Phoenix abilities, Grey tore through Frost's mental defenses and forced her to face the self-denials of her past. Frost was traumatized after the attack, the experience left her humiliated and emotionally shattered.

Soon afterwards, fellow X-Man [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] found her physically shattered in her diamond form. While other members of the school investigated the murder, Beast and Jean Grey successfully reassembled and fused Frost's body back together. Alive again, Frost was able to name her murderer - Esme of the Stepford Cuckoos.  Esme had shot Frost in her single flaw with a diamond bullet, under the direction of [[Xorn|Xorn/Magneto]]. Esme fled, and after her subsequent death, the three remaining Cuckoos returned to Frost.

===Leading Xavier's===

Frost did not remain in such a state for long.  Following Jean Grey's apparent death, Cyclops and Frost became lovers, despite the criticism from their teammates. The two took over the school after Professor Xavier stepped down. Frost became co-headmaster with Cyclops and advisor to a new team of Hellions.  

Due to Frost's refined telepathic abilities, she beat the alternate future daughter of Jean Grey and Cyclops, [[Rachel Summers|Rachel Grey]], in a contest on the [[astral plane]]. Frost then rather peacefully offered Rachel the chance to help her hone her telepathic skills.  Rachel, though still wary, accepted the proposal.

In ''[[X-Men: Phoenix - Endsong]]'' the X-Men found themselves facing off against the [[Phoenix (comics)|Phoenix]] again. The Phoenix Force returned to Earth and resurrected Jean Grey from her grave. In a plan to trap the Phoenix Force, Frost offered her body as vessel.  Frost is temporarily possessed by the Phoenix, though she is unable to host it without being overwhelmed by it, as she's not an [[Omega-level mutant]]. The Phoenix refuses to leave Frost's body until Jean Grey removes it.

Following [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]] the student population has gone drastically down.  Frost and Cyclops decide to have one team of students to train as New X-Men.  To pick who is on this team they put all the students in the danger room to fight each other.  Frost chooses six students, four from her Hellions squad, to be New X-Men. Cyclops lets [[X-23]] join the New X-Men squad which Frost greatly opposes because X-23 is too dangerous. At this time the racist preacher [[William Stryker]] causes the subsequent deaths of most of the depowered students and tries to eliminate mutant kind.  Once again Frost feels responsible for the loss of young lives. 

====House of M and Civil War====

Frost was pivotal to the plot of the [[House of M]] event.  In this reality, she was married to Scott and the pair had three children.  Frost was the first X-Man [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] contacted for help after the [[Scarlet Witch]] altered reality.  She was the only other reawoken individual to side with Wolverine in a controversial opinion to kill the [[Scarlet Witch]] in order to return to the world to normal.

Frost announced to [[Iron Man]] that the Xavier Institute and the X-Men would not support the [[Superhuman Registration Act]] and remain neutral (see [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]) as she fears that the registration of mutants would put them in more danger. [[Carol Danvers|Ms. Marvel's]] visit to the Institute in order to convince the X-Men to support the pro-registration heroes caused Frost to harshly criticize the Avengers for not showing any kind of support following the Genoshan genocide, which she had already done with Iron Man, and the mass deaths of the depowered students while showing her psychic images to illustrate her point.

====A New Hellfire Club====
[[Image:Emmacassandra.PNG|thumb|225px|Emma Frost with Cassandra Nova. Art by [[John Cassaday]].|right]]
An ongoing subplot in ''[[Astonishing X-Men]]'' depicts Frost's unusually antagonistic relationship with [[Shadowcat|Kitty Pryde]] and possible domination of [[Cyclops (comics)|Scott Summers]] as possible evidence of disloyalty.  Her secretive relationship with the surviving [[Stepford Cuckoos]] has also been presented as "evidence," and accusations are frequently made by other characters having reason to distrust her motives. In issue #12 (August 2005), the question of Frost's "true loyalties" are brought into focus as Frost abandons the team during a fight to confer with a shadowy figure, revealed on the final page to be one of a group of four individuals watching from the shadows.  The group contains [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]], [[Cassandra Nova]], [[Negasonic Teenage Warhead]] (a young telepath and former student of Frost's, who apparently died in [[Genosha]]), and a cloaked figure called [[Perfection (comics)|Perfection]], who discuss among themselves Frost's impending betrayal of the team.

In ''Astonishing X-Men'' #13 (February, 2006), it was revealed that Frost's survival of the destruction of Genosha in ''[[New X-Men]]'' #115 was due to Cassandra Nova creating Frost's secondary mutation, while in exchange, she was to assist Nova as part of a scheme to infiltrate the X-Men as a sleeper agent (Nova having erased the memory of their encounter and only restoring it recently). This occurred when Emma allowed a part of Nova to escape into her brain while she was trapping Nova into the Alien form Stuff during the X-men's last battle with Nova. She then played up on Emma's [[Survivor's guilt|survivors guilt]] at surviving Genosha while her students died, her suppressed fear of her being evil while still seeking redemption, while trying to reconcile her real love for Cyclops and that she could possibly betray him by turning back to her roots. Using this and other elements of Emma's consciousness, she created physical manifestations of Cassandra in her human form, Sebastian Shaw, Emma's younger evil self in the Hellfire club calling itself "Perfection", and  Negasonic Teenage Warhead, a former student of hers that was killed in Genosha. First, she began using her telepathy on Cyclops to appear as [[Jean Grey|Phoenix]], trying to reveal the lack of control he had over his optic blasts. It was revealed that shortly after he fell out of a plane with his younger brother Havok, Scott placed a deep mental block in his mind which prevented the controlled use of his powers. Encouraged by Frost, Scott revisits that moment in his life and reverses the decision, leaving him comatose. With Cyclops out of the way Frost/Nova, and the physical manifestations calling themselves the "Hellfire Club", assault the X-Mansion, incapacitating every X-Man, with the exception of Shadowcat, who manages to elude capture, but was eventually tricked by Nova/Emma Frost into helping Emma/Nova retrieve the "Stuff" body containing the rest of Nova. A depowered Cyclops with the help of [[Blindfold (comics)|Blindfold]], and [[Hisako Ichiki]], were able to defeat the "Hellfire Club" by figuring out they were fake, while Emma herself tried to get Kitty to shoot her in order to block Cassandra's escape, but was stopped by Cyclops. Undeterred, Nova then attempted to transfer her mind into Hisako, but Emma tells her to go to hell. The ending was interrupted as everyone present was teleported away by [[S.W.O.R.D. (comics)|S.W.O.R.D.]] to the [[Breakworld]].

===="Mother" of the Stepford Cuckoos====
The third issue of [[X-Men: Phoenix - Warsong]] reveals that Emma's [[ovum|ova]] were the genetic templates used to clone thousands of identical female telepaths, five of which would become the [[Stepford Cuckoos]].  At the issue's conclusion, the encapsulated offspring; as well as Celeste Cuckoo; begin to refer to Frost as "mother"-- a title whose usage she later accepts.

===Background explored===
[[Image:EmmaFrost8.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Frost as a teenager.<br> Art by [[Greg Horn]].]]

In a flashback story told by Frost herself in ''Generation X #24'', Frost details a time she spent in a mental institution after being sent there by her parents. However, an ''Emma Frost'' ongoing series depicted Frost's early years, and seems to refute this. The series was supposed to cover Frost's life from high school until her first appearance as the White Queen, however, it was cancelled at issue #18.

''Generation X #-1'', a part of the "Flashback" event which showed the first meeting of Emma Frost and Banshee, seems to take place after the series.

In [[X-Men: Deadly Genesis]], Frost is shown after the events of her series and ''Generation X #-1''. As a stripper at the Hellfire Club, Frost was approached by Professor X and [[Moira MacTaggart]] to join a new team of X-Men along with other characters introduced in the series. When she refused Professor X erased her memory of the encounter.

==Powers and abilities==
Emma Frost is a transmorph capable of accessing both a human form with telepathic abilities or an organic diamond form with enhanced strength and durability. Since her introduction, Frost has displayed the telepathic standards of broadcasting and receiving thoughts, mind control, altering perceptions and memories, astral projection, etc. She is highly skilled at creating [[Electronics|electronic]] devices that amplify/block/engage psionic powers, as well as exploiting flaws in most electronic equipment.

Frost is also very adept at performing 'psychic surgery': the utilization of pin-pointed psionic energy to exert absolute control over individual brain functions such that the physical form can be manipulated (i.e., injuries healed, disabilities repaired, stimulation or retardation of growth and aging, etc). This is an unusual feat for even the most powerful of telepaths, but one that Frost is keen to utilize whenever the occasion suits her.

Upon their meeting in the rainforests of Ecuador, [[Cassandra Nova]] labeled Frost's psychic abilities as 'bush league' in comparison to herself. Regardless of that statement, Frost can formidably hold her own even against those of more considerable might. An example of this was her victory over [[Rachel Summers|Rachel Grey]] (Marvel Girl) on the Astral Plane; while Rachel may have had significantly more raw power, Frost's refined skills enabled her to claim victory over the relatively inexperienced Rachel. In contrast to Cassandra Nova's claim, Frost has been cited as a "Psi of High Order", capable of extraordinary telepathic feats.

During the massacre of over 16 million mutants in Genosha, Frost developed a secondary mutation: the ability to transform herself into a perfectly smooth, flexible, translucent [[diamond]]-like substance. Her abilities have been inconsistent in this form. Although initially only her skin turns into diamond, she was shattered by a diamond bullet, indicating that her entire body turns into organic diamond. Frost is virtually impervious to all forms of physical damage and can use her indestructible body to support incredible amounts of weight, though different writers have shown varying accounts of her strength. Recently, it has been revealed that Cassandra Nova was responsible for somehow catalyzing Frost's secondary mutation.

Frost's full range of abilities between her diamond state and regular form have also been inconsistent; while some occurrences would have some readers believe that due to a genetic flaw Frost cannot access her telepathy in diamond form, later stories have contradicted this. However, recent clarifications in X-Men #190 and Astonishing X-Men have shown that Morrison's initial depiction of her powers was correct: that Frost cannot access her psychic powers in diamond form and vice versa. Her mind's condition when in diamond form has also been inconsistent. ''[[X-Men: Phoenix - Warsong|Phoenix: Warsong #3]]'' however confirms that Emma's mind is completely immune to telepathy (both communication and assault) while diamond.

Throughout the years, it has been strongly hinted that Frost is also a latent [[psychokinesis|telekinetic]]. In a battle with the Phoenix Force, Frost channeled her mental energy into a "psi-bolt" that affected the physical realm, causing the building around her to collapse. To save herself from [[Trevor Fitzroy]], Jean Grey's displaced psyche was able to use Frost's brain to generate a strong telekinetic force-field and fly while it inhabited the White Queen's body.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #281</ref> ''[[Generation X]]'' #19 takes this even further, wherein an unconscious Frost telekinetically levitated several kitchen utensils around her while having a bad dream.

As Emma's mutant abilities are her telepathy and diamond form, it is still unclear as to how these feats were accomplished.  ''[[X-Man]]'' #28 offers a suggestion however: within which Hank McCoy explains to Nate Grey that there exists a "thin line between telekinesis and telepathy", one composed of "artificially defined distinctions" which quite possibly are subconsciously put in place by a psi (within his or her own mind) for any number of reasons.  This theory is well-supported throughout the history of the X-Men; as various psi-talents have indeed "switched" mental powers, or utilized various forms of psionic energies which they typically were not able to wield, particularly in times of extreme stress/duress.

==Alternate versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===

In the [[Age of Apocalypse]], Emma Frost never joined the Hellfire Club, and was part neither of the X-Men nor of Apocalypse's forces. Instead, she was a member of the High Human Council, despite being a mutant. The AoA Frost had no psychic powers due to a lobotomy, which, regardless of it having been forced, saved her from Apocalypse's psychic mutants purge.

Frost was one of the HHC leaders that lead the attack against Apocalypse, alongside [[Mariko Yashida]] and [[Captain Britain|Brian Braddock]], whom Frost both distrusted and disliked for his extreme anti-mutant stance.

===Ultimate Universe===
First appearing in ''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'' #42, the Emma Frost of the [[Ultimate Marvel Universe|Ultimate Universe]] is a former student of [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]]. The two became romantically involved, but they eventually split over ideological differences: Whereas Xavier believes in aggressive action and in protecting his students from society, Frost believes in an integrated approach to mutant/human relations. Frost believes Xavier to be too violent.

Frost returned to Chicago and became a teacher, giving mutant education seminars. The governor supported her cause and introduced her to the White House chief of staff. Through him, she meets the American president and organizes the New Mutants program, designed to educate humans about mutants and to cut the government's ties to Charles Xavier, whose reputation has been tarnished. During the group's first media appearance, they and the president are attacked by Sentinels and must be rescued by the X-Men. Xavier tries to convince Frost to stay with the X-Men, but she returns to her own school in Chicago. Her new program, the [[Academy of Tomorrow]], accepts all talented students, regardless of genetic status.

In the ''Ultimate X-Men'' comics, Frost can transform her skin into an organic [[diamond]] form, like her secondary mutation in the Marvel Universe; however, she does not display telepathic abilities.

==Appearances in other media==
===As ''White Queen''===
*She appears in the [[Marvel's X-Men (video game)|X-Men]] game for [[NES]], in at the end of the fourth level, "Battle on a Living Starship." As a boss, Frost morphs into the player's chosen character and mimics their attacks, periodically returning to her normal form. Unless players were able to decipher the hidden code written on the front of the game, this was the final level of the game.

*In the 1989 animated [[television pilot]], ''[[Pryde of the X-Men]]'', she was portrayed as a member of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]'s [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], with no mention of the Hellfire Club. Her power seemed to consist of psychic or energy attacks, with no demonstration of telepathy. [[Susan Silo]] provided her voice.

*She is the mid-boss of stage five in [[Konami]]'s [[X-Men (arcade game)|X-Men arcade game]], which was largely based on [[Pryde of the X-Men]] series. Susan Silo added her voice talents to the game with such infamous [[engrish]] quotes as, "The White Queen welcomes you to die!" In the final stage Frost returns, as the third boss of five, after [[Wendigo (comics)|Wendigo]] and before [[Master Mold]], inside of Avalon, Magneto's base in Asteroid M.

*Frost made appearances in the 1992 [[X-Men animated series]] as the White Queen of the Inner Circle Club (the name used for the Hellfire Club in the series). Frost appears in the first three parts of the series' adaptation of the '''[[Dark Phoenix Saga]]'''; and is shown briefly among a group of telepaths in the episode, ''Beyond Good and Evil Part 4: End and Beginning''.

*[[Finola Hughes]], with the help of a white wig, portrayed Emma Frost in a 1996 live-action television movie titled ''[[Generation X (film)|Generation X]]''. As in the Generation X series, Frost still went by the [[code name]] White Queen.

===As ''Emma Frost''===

*Emma Frost is a playable character in the [[computer role playing game]] ''[[X-Men Legends]]'' and returns as a [[non-player character]] in the sequel ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]''.

*In ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'', Frost appears as a [[non-player character|NPC]]. She is seen unconscious alongside other X-Men in Dr. Doom's castle.

*After the success of the ''X-Men'' trilogy of movies, there has been talk that an Emma Frost film being done by David O. Russell is being considered by 20th Century Fox.[http://www.usatoday.com/life/2006-06-01-coming-attractions_x.htm]
