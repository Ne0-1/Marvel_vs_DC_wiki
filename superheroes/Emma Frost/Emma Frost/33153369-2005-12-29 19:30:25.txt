'''Emma Grace Frost''', also known as the '''White Queen''', is a [[fictional character]], a [[Mutant (fictional)|mutant]] [[comic book]] [[superhero]]ine (and former [[supervillain]]ess) in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. She once fought against the [[X-Men]] as a member of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]], but later reformed and became a member of the superhero team. Created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne]], she first appeared in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #129 (January 1980).

==Character history==
[[Image:Uncanny131.png|thumb|135px|left|Cover to ''Uncanny X-Men'' #131. Art by John Byrne.]]

===The Hellfire Club and Massachusetts Academy===
Emma Frost first appeared as the White Queen of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]], a group of superhumans who dressed in 18th century clothing and plotted world domination. Frost and the Club's agents captured several members of the [[X-Men]]. Frost engaged the Phoenix in a psychic battle, which she lost badly, but recovered.

During her time with the Hellfire Club, Frost also ran the Massachusetts Academy, a school for mutants which served as a counterpoint to that of X-Men founder [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]]'s [[School for Gifted Youngsters]]. Frost's trainees became the supervillain team the [[Hellions (comics)|Hellions]] and fought Xavier's young students the [[New Mutants]]. At one point, Frost began privately training a young mutant named Angelica Jones to be her personal [[bodyguard]] and [[assassin]] in reaction to political in-fighting among the Hellfire Club. Jones eventually discovered Frost was manipulating her and broke free from her control to later become the super-heroine [[Firestar]]. (''[[Firestar Comics]]'')

===Death of the Hellions===
In ''Uncanny X-Men'' #281 (1991), the [[time travel]]ing mutant [[Trevor Fitzroy]] unleashed the mutant-hunting [[robot]]s called the [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]] on Frost and the Hellions. Frost was left in a [[coma]] by the attack and her students were killed, although one of the Hellions, [[Tarot (comics)|Tarot]], somehow returned to life several months later.

The X-Men cared for the comatose Frost at their headquarters. Later, she awoke and possessed the body of the X-Man [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]]. She escaped the X-Men, but she was devastated when she discovered the deaths of her students and Xavier was able to coax her back into her own body.

===Generation X===
Xavier paired Frost with the  X-Man [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]] to mentor the [[teenage]] mutant team [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]] at Frost's Massachusetts Academy after the two had teamed up to stop the [[Phalanx]]. Banshee never fully trusted Frost, despite an undercurrent of sexual tension between the two, and even some of her students were skeptical of her.

After Frost's business ventures took a bad turn, she turned to her estranged sister [[Adrienne Frost|Adrienne]] for help. Adrienne, a [[psychometry|psychometrist]], offered financial assistance but demanded to be co-headmistress of the school in return. Adrienne secretly plotted against Emma and planted a bomb at the school, which killed [[Synch]], one of Emma's students. Emma tracked down and murdered Adrienne and then returned to the Academy, growing increasingly distant from her students in an effort to hide her crime. This, combined with Banshee's increasing [[clinical depression|depression]] and [[drunkenness]] following the death of his long-time lover [[Moira MacTaggert]], led the students to leave, disbanding Generation X.

===X-Men===
Afterwards, Frost traveled to the mutant haven island of [[Genosha]].  There, Frost ran and taught at a mutant school until a genocidal Sentinel attack killed most the island's population. Frost survived only due to the sudden manifestation of her secondary mutation: the power to transform herself into a flexible, diamond-like substance that provides her near-invulnerability.

Frost then joined the X-Men and taught at Xavier's newly-reopened school. She began to have a sexual telepathic relationship with the X-Man [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] who had became distant from his wife [[Jean Grey]], due to his temporary physical and mental merger with the mutant immortal, [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]].  She also started to look after and train a group of telepathic quintuplets known as the [[Stepford Cuckoos]].

During a riot at the school, one of the Cuckoos was killed and the others left Emma, blaming her for the death. Soon afterword, she was found, by her fellow X-Man [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], in her diamond shape, totally shattered. It was soon revealed that one of the Cuckoos, Esme, was responsible. She had been working behind the scenes with Magneto (who would later be revealed to be an impostor of the man). After Esme turned on "Magneto" when he rejected her advances, she was killed by him. The three remaining Cuckoos have since returned to Emma, even though in another incarnation of the X-Men, [[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]], a video game, shows the remaining Stepford Cuckoos seeking revenge.

Following Jean Grey's apparent death, Cyclops and Emma became lovers, despite the criticism from their teammates. The two took over the school after [[Professor X|Professor Xavier]] stepped down, where Frost became co-headmaster with Cyclops and advisor to the new [[Hellions (comics)|Hellions]].

Due to Emma's well refined telepathic abilities, she beat the alternate future daughter of [[Jean Grey]] and [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], [[Rachel Summers]], in a contest on the [[astral plane]], despite Rachel's superior power. However, she then rather peacefully offered Rachel the chance to help her refine her telepathic skills since there isn't anyone else to do it now.  Rachel, though still wary, accepted the proposal. There has been no actual evidence of Rachel's training since.

Emma's appearance in [[House of M]] seems to be fairly important to the plot.  She has already shown her rather controversial opinion on the matter of [[Scarlet Witch]], deciding to side with [[Wolverine]] on killing her. Emma was also the first X-man Wolverine contacted for help after the Scarlet Witch altered reality to create a world dominated by mutants.

===Loyalties===
An ongoing subplot in [[Astonishing X-Men]] depicts Emma's unusually antagonistic relationship with [[Kitty Pryde]] and apparent domination of [[Scott Summers]] as possible evidence of disloyalty.  Her secretive relationship with the surviving [[Stepford Cuckoos]] has also been presented as "evidence" of this, and accusations are frequently made by other characters having reason to distrust her motives.  In issue #12 (August 2005), the question of Emma's "true loyalties" is brought into focus as Emma abandons the team during a fight to confer with a shadowy figure, revealed on the final page to be one of a group of four individuals watching from the shadows.  The group contains [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]], [[Cassandra Nova]], a girl who apparently died in [[Genosha]] and a cloaked unidentified figure, who discuss among themselves Emma's impending betrayal of the team.

==''Emma Frost'' series==

Following the success of some of the newer X-Men titles such as the New Mutants (Vol.2) and X-Treme X-Men, staff at Marvel considered a new title centered around the former White Queen. Marvel launched an ''Emma Frost'' ongoing series in 2003. It was cancelled in 2004. This series detailed Emma's early years, and was written by [[Karl Bollers]]. The earlier issues were drawn by [[Randy Green]], who left after #6. He was replaced with [[Carlo Pagulayan]] for the remaining issues up until the series was cancelled. 

''Emma Frost'' was reprinted in three digest-sized collections (the first of which released under the [[Marvel Age]] imprint). 

* ''Emma Frost Vol. 1: Higher Learning'' collects issues #1-6 and revolves around Emma's conflicts with her family, especially her father.

* ''Emma Frost Vol. 2: Mind Games'' collects issues #7-12 and features Emma's first forays into criminal activity.

* ''Emma Frost Vol. 3: Bloom'' collects issues #13-18, in which Emma goes to college and befriends another telepath, Astrid Bloom, and learns to use her powers. This was the last trade, as Marvel cancelled ''Emma Frost'' at #18.

==Powers and abilities==
Emma Frost is a [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]], a [[human]] who is born with  [[superhuman]] powers acquired through [[evolution]].  She is a powerful [[telepath]] and has some skill at creating [[Electronics|electronic]] devices. Recently, she developed a secondary mutation: the ability to transform herself into a flexible, translucent [[diamond]]-like substance. When she is in this state, she supposedly cannot use her telepathic powers (although this limitation has been portrayed inconsistently by different writers). In this state she has superhuman endurance and augmented physical strength. Her detailed list of powers is:

* '''Telepathic hearing/Telepathic Probe/Psi-Scan (General & Specific):''' listening in, viewing and or projecting another's thoughts, projecting her own thoughts, locating other people by their thoughts
* '''Compulsion/Mental Possession:''' commanding another to do/think something they normally wouldn't 
* '''Mind-Wipe (Partial & Total):''' erasing/blocking memories 
* '''Brain-Fry/Encephalon Pattern Disruption:''' Physically destroying another's brain, as well as manipulating the brain so other parts of the body feel extreme pain or pleasure. 
* '''Brain Freeze/Mental Shut Down:''' Turning another's mind off/rendering them unconscious 
* '''Psionic Anchor:''' Psionically holding another's mind to his or her body 
* '''Telepathic Ambush/Stun:''' a kind of "psi-bolt" used to stun an enemy, or simply disorient them. 
* '''Telepathic Illusion:''' Causing another to see something that isn't there
* '''Transformation:''' Turning herself into a complete diamond-hard substance (New X-Men, X-Men).

==Appearances in other media==
*Emma Frost has appeared in two television movies. The first, in 1989, was the animated ''[[Pryde of the X-Men]]'', with [[Susan Silo]] as the voice of the White Queen.  In a 1996 live-action television movie titled ''[[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]]'', [[Finola Hughes]], with the help of a blonde wig, portrayed Emma Frost.

*Emma Frost also briefly appeared in an episode of the [[X-Men animated series]] as a member of the Hellfire Club during the Dark Phoenix Saga.

*Emma is also playable in the [[role playing games]] [[X-Men Legends]] and a [[Non-player character]] in the sequel [[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]].

*Emma (as the evil White Queen) is one of the Level Boss characters in the Konami X-Men arcade game.

*Prior to [[Bryan Singer]]'s and [[screenwriter]] [[Dan Harris]]' decision to leave the X-movie franchise, it was rumoured [[Sigourney Weaver]] would play an empathic Emma Frost in [[X-Men 3 (film)|X-Men 3]]. [[Ashley Hartman]] has been rumoured for the role as well, although is unconfirmed.
