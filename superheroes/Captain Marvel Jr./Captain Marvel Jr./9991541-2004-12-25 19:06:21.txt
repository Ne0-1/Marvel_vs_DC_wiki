'''Captain Marvel Jr.''' is a [[fictional character]], derived from the [[DC Comics]] (formerly [[Fawcett Comics]]) character [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]].

Captain Marvel Jr. was an orphaned newsboy named Freddy Freeman who was fatally wounded in a battle between Captain Marvel and his enemy [[Captain Nazi]].  Marvel transformed into his civilian identity, Billy Batson, and brought the dying Freeman to the wizard Shazam, who had given Batson the powers of Captain Marvel.  Shazam granted this wish: when Batson transformed into Marvel again by shouting the magic word "Shazam!", Freeman shouted "Captain Marvel!" and was also transformed.  Freeman, who was now called Captain Marvel Jr., resembled a younger Captain Marvel, though with a yellow-on-blue costume with a red cape, rather than Marvel's yellow-on-red with a white cape.  Whenever Freeman says the magic words "Captain Marvel!" he transforms into Captain Marvel Jr. or returns from that form to that of Freddy Freeman.  However, as a result of Captain Nazi's near-fatal attack, Freddy is permanently [[lame]] in his left leg (although Captain Marvel Jr. bears no such impediment).

When DC Comics bought out the Marvel Family in the [[1970s]] and merged them into the [[DC Universe]] in the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]], Captain Marvel Jr. went as well.  As a part of the unified DC Universe, he became a member of the [[Teen Titans|Titans]] for a time, calling himself "Captain Marvel" or "CM3".
