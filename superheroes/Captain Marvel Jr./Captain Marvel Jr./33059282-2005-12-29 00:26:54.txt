'''Captain Marvel, Jr.''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] derived from the [[DC Comics]] (formerly [[Fawcett Comics]]) character [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]].  A member of the [[Marvel Family]] team of superheroes, he was created by Ed Herron and [[Mac Raboy]], and first appeared in ''Whiz Comics'' #25 in December 1941.

Junior is the super-powered alter-ego of '''Freddy Freeman''', a crippled newsboy that Captain Marvel saved from an attack by one of his enemies, [[Captain Nazi]].  Freddy was not granted his powers by the wizard [[Shazam (comics character)|Shazam]], but by Captain Marvel himself: whenever Freddy says the magic word "Captain Marvel," he is magically transformed into a super-powered version of himself.  Unlike Captain Marvel and the modern-era version of [[Mary Marvel]], Junior remains a young teenager in his transformed state.

==History==

===Fawcett origin: ''Whiz Comics'' #25===
During a battle with [[Captain Nazi]] in ''[[Whiz Comics]]'' #25 (December 1941), one of [[Captain Marvel]]’s punches sends the villain careening into a lake.  An elderly man, Jacob Freeman, and his grandson, Freddy, happened to be fishing in the lake near where Nazi has landed, and, not knowing who he is, lift the unconscious man into their boat to prevent him from drowning.  Nazi immediately comes to, tosses Jacob into the lake, and knocks Freddy out of the boat with an oar.  The old man immediately dies, but Captain Marvel is able to save an unconscious Freddy and bring him to a hospital.

Captain Marvel waits at the hospital in his regular form of young Billy Batson.  He is told by a nurse that Freddy’s injuries are so severe that he is not expected to last the night, and Billy devises a better way to help the boy.  At midnight, Billy sneaks Freddy out of the hospital and takes him to the secret underground lair of the wizard [[Shazam (comics character)|Shazam]], who first granted Billy the power to become Captain Marvel.

Billy asks the wizard to heal Freddy and save his life, but Shazam cannot, and instead tells Billy that he, as Captain Marvel, can pass along some of his powers to so that Freddy can walk again.  Shazam disappears and Billy transforms back into Captain Marvel, just as Freddy awakens.  Looking up, he exclaims “Why...it’s Captain Marvel,” and is instantly transformed into a super-powered version of himself.  Freeman, who was now called "Captain Marvel, Jr.", resembled a younger Captain Marvel, though with a yellow-on-blue costume with a red cape, rather than Marvel's yellow-on-red with a white cape.

Captain Marvel informs Junior that he cannot remain in his super-powered form at all times, but that he must allow his human form to heal as best it can.  With that, Freddy once again said his mentor's name and returned to his hospital bed.  Although his spine heals, Freddy remains permanently [[lame]] in his left leg and is forced to walk with a [[crutch]] (although Captain Marvel, Jr. bears no such impediment).  As a result, Captain Nazi became Junior’s main arch-enemy, and the two repeatedly battled over the years.

===Fawcett years===
Captain Marvel, Jr. proved to be a popular spin-off character for the Captain Marvel franchise, and appeared in solo adventures in both ''Master Comics'' and his own ''Captain Marvel, Jr.'' comic book.  The character's solo adventures feature an art style, devised by co-creator [[Mac Raboy]], that was more realistic and dramatic style than the style used by [[C.C. Beck]] and the other Fawcett artists for Captain Marvel.

In most of his adventures, Freddy Freeman is depicted as a character to be pitied for his injury, reminiscent of Tiny Tim from [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', until he transforms into his super-powered state.  As Captain Marvel, Jr., he is unable to introduce himself to anyone, since he'd transform back into Freddy Freeman after pronouncing the first two words in his name.

Junior, Captain Marvel, and newest Marvel Family member [[Mary Marvel]] began appearing together in The Marvel Family comic book beginning in 1945.  That title and Junior's own continued until 1953, when Fawcett was forced to cease publication of all Marvel Family related comic books because of a lawsuit from National Comics (later [[DC Comics]]).

===''Shazam!'' revival===
After Fawcett Comics folded, Captain Marvel, Jr. remained unpublished, alongside the rest of the [[Marvel Family]], for years.  In 1972, DC Comics purchased the rights to the Marvel Family characters and revived them in a new series entitled ''Shazam!''.  In his 1970s adventures, Captain Marvel, Jr. discovered that fellow superhero [[Kid Eternity]] was in fact his long-lost brother (both of their secret identities share the last name "Freeman").

===Current origin: ''The Power of Shazam!''===
[[Retconned]] out of existence after the 1985 ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' miniseries, Freddy Freeman was reintroduced in ''[[The Power of Shazam!]]'' #3 (although he makes a very brief cameo in the ''Power of Shazam!'' graphic novel).  The modern version of the Freddy/Captain Marvel, Jr. origin, depicted in Power of Shazam! #6 - 8, #37, and ''[[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]'' v3 #9 -10, closely follow his Fawcett origin, with the only major additions being details added to the main story.

As a young boy, Freddy Freeman grew up in [[New England]] with his parents and his foster brother, Timothy Karnes.  Freddy's parents were killed in an auto accident by a drunk driver en route to one of Freddy's [[Little League]] games.  Freddy was sent to live with his grandfather, Jacob Freeman, while Timothy was forced to live with a string of unstable foster homes.  Timothy would eventually grow to blame Freddy for his misfortune, and planned revenge against his former foster brother.

Freddy and his grandfather eventually moved to the Midwest and [[Fawcett City]], where Freddy became an all-star student at the Binder school.  An archetypical [[High school subcultures|jock]], Freddy was a featured member of both the [[football]] and [[baseball]] teams, made excellent grades, had several girlfriends, and was among the school's most popular students.  One of Freddy's schoolmates was Billy Batson, Captain Marvel's alter ego, who worked as a boy reporter for [[WHIZ]] radio.  Billy was the host of a regional spelling bee that Freddy entered, where he first met and immediately fell for one of the other contestants, Billy's sister, Mary Bromfield.

After one of his baseball games, Freddy and his grandfather went fishing in the Fawcett Bay.  At the same time, Captain Marvel was engaged in a battle with Captain Nazi, a [[World War II]]-era villain who had just awoken after fifty years in [[suspended animation]].  The modern origin story follows the Fawcett origin from this point on almost to the letter: Captain Marvel knocks Captain Nazi into the lake, the Freemans attempt to save Nazi, Nazi attacks the both of them, and Captain Marvel intervenes and rushes both injured bystanders to a hospital.  Jacob Freeman slips into a coma, and Freddy is found to have a severely injured spine and a broken leg.

Freddy is attacked once again by Captain Nazi before being taken to the wizard Shazam by Captain Marvel and [[Mary Marvel]], who grant the boy the power to become Captain Marvel, Jr.  After being granted his powers, Jacob Freeman dies, and Freddy goes on a rampage against Captain Nazi as Captain Marvel, Jr.  Nazi is eventually brought to justice after Mary gets Junior to calm down.

An attempt by Junior to ask Mary to be his girlfriend in ''Power of Shazam!'' #13 leads to a brawl between Junior and Captain Marvel, who, as Billy, had seen firsthand how Freddy treated his girlfriends.  As a result, Junior quits the Marvel Family and leaves to [[New York City]].  

===Teen Titans===
In New York. Junior he starts a new life, dating a middle-aged woman, Dr. Caitlin Russo, and battling both Captain Nazi and a schizophrenic villainess named Chain Lightning.  His Freddy Freeman body eventually healed, although he is left permanently lame in his right leg and forced to walk with a crutch.

During his time in New York, Junior became a member of the [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]], calling himself ''CM3'' (short for "Captain Marvel Three", with Billy being CM1 and Mary CM2) to allow him to identify himself without changing.  He also periodically ran into his former foster brother Timothy, who, as the super-powered [[demon]] [[Sabbac]], repeatedly attempted to kill him.  

After the Titans disbanded, Junior eventually returned to Fawcett and the Marvel Family after reconciling with Billy.  Much to Billy’s distaste, Freddy and Mary begin dating, although, heeding the wishes of his sister, Billy does not interfere.

Junior briefly served as a member of Titans L.A., a shortlived Teen Titans spin-off group.

===Young Justice===
[[Young Justice]] was created by Junior's friend [[Conner Kent|Superboy]], along with [[Tim Drake|Robin]] and [[Bart Allen|Kid Flash]]. Young Justice soon expanded with other members, and Junior was a reserve member for the team.

===The Outsiders===
In ''[[The Outsiders (comics)|The Outsiders]]'' (third version) #9 , Timothy Karnes was later killed by a man named Ishmael Gregor, who murdered Timothy during a satanic ritual in order to inherit his Sabbac powers.  Junior came to the aid of the Outsiders to stop the new and more feral Sabbac. In his current incarnation, Junior once again goes by the name "Captain Marvel Junior" (not "CM3"), and wears a white cape like that of the other two Marvels instead of his traditional red one.

Currently, Junior is now a member of the Outsiders, as of ''Outsiders'' #28, but seems apprehensive about the team's dark tone. Both he and Marvel Family nemeses Sabbac and Dr. Sivana play major roles in the current ''Outsiders'' comic book series. As an Outsider his first mission was to stop the [[Fearsome Five]] with their new member Sabbac.  Sabbac empowered by the [[Seven Deadly Sins]] stopped his own members and almost killed the Outsiders. With the help of [[Katana (comics)|Katana]] with her [[Soul Taker]], [[Donna Troy]] and Junior himself trapped Sabbac in the Soul Taker.  Donna Troy recruited Junior, [[Metamorpho#Shift|Shift]], [[Jade (comics)|Jade]] and [[Starfire (comics)|Starfire]] for a mission in outer space. Junior unexpectedly left [[New Cronos]] to head back to Earth because of the disruption of magic, brought about by the Spectre's murder of the wizard Shazam.

==Trivia==
*[[Elvis Presley]] was a big fan of Captain Marvel, Jr., and styled his trademark [[haircut]] after that of the comic book character.  In addition, Elvis' stage outfits (with a half-cape similar to those worn by the Marvels) and his TCB logo (with a Marvel-esque lightning bolt insignia) also show inspiration from Captain Marvel, Jr.

*An adult version of Captain Marvel, Jr. appears as a background character in the 1996 ''[[Kingdom Come (comic)|Kingdom Come]]'' miniseries by [[Mark Waid]] and [[Alex Ross]].  In this alternate future setting, Junior now goes by the name "King Marvel", and looks remarkably like Elvis Presley.  Mary Marvel, now called "Lady Marvel", is his wife, and the two have a superpowered son, "The Whiz", named after ''[[Whiz Comics]]''. 

*When the Titans tried returning home from the future they were caught in an alternate future where Freddy Freeman was an adult, and went by "Captain Marvel" instead of "Captain Marvel Junior".
