'''Captain Marvel Jr.''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] derived from the [[Fawcett Comics]] character [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], later purchased by [[DC Comics]]. A member of the [[Marvel Family]] team of superheroes, he was created by Ed Herron and [[Mac Raboy]], and first appeared in ''[[Whiz Comics]]'' #25 in December 1941. 

Captain Marvel, Jr.'s alter-ego is Freddy Freeman, a crippled newsboy saved by Captain Marvel, who derives his powers from Captain Marvel himself, while the other Marvels derive their powers from the wizard [[Shazam (comics)|Shazam]]. By saying the name Captain Marvel, Freddy is transformed into Captain Marvel Jr. Unlike Captain Marvel and the modern-era version of [[Mary Marvel]], Junior remains a teenager in his transformed state. It should be noted that Captain Marvel Jr. is the only member of the Marvel family who does not say “Shazam!” when transforming.

==Publication history==
===Character Publications===

Captain Marvel, Jr's first appearance in ''[[Whiz Comics]]'' #25 was part of a three-issue crossover between ''Whiz Comics'' and another Fawcett publication, ''[[Master Comics]]'', in late 1941. The crossover, printed during the height of [[World War II]], found [[Bulletman]] and [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] at odds with [[Adolf Hitler]]'s superpowered champion, [[Captain Nazi]]. During a battle with Captain Nazi in ''Whiz Comics'' #25, one of Captain Marvel’s punches sends the villain careening into a lake. An elderly man, Jacob Freeman, and his grandson, Freddy, happened to be fishing in the lake near the place Nazi has landed, and, not knowing who he is, lift the unconscious man into their boat to prevent him from drowning. Nazi immediately comes to, tosses Jacob into the lake, and knocks Freddy out of the boat with an oar. The old man immediately dies, but Captain Marvel is able to save an unconscious Freddy and bring him to a hospital.

Captain Marvel changes to his regular form of Billy Batson, and is told by a nurse that Freddy is not expected to last the night. Billy then devises a way to help the boy: he sneaks Freddy out of the hospital and takes him to the secret underground throne of the wizard [[Shazam (comics)|Shazam]], who first granted Billy the power to become Captain Marvel.

Billy asks the wizard to heal Freddy and save his life, but Shazam cannot, and instead tells Billy that he, as Captain Marvel, can pass along some of his powers to so that Freddy can walk again.  Shazam disappears and Billy transforms back into Captain Marvel, just as Freddy awakens. Looking up, he exclaims “Why...it’s Captain Marvel,” and is instantly transformed into a super-powered version of himself. Freddy, who was now called "Captain Marvel, Jr.", resembled a younger Captain Marvel, though with a yellow-on-blue costume with a red cape, rather than Marvel's yellow-on-red with a white cape.

Captain Marvel informs Junior that he cannot remain in his super-powered form at all times, but that he must allow his human form to heal as best it can. With that, Freddy once again said his mentor's name and returned to his hospital bed. Freddy remains permanently [[lame]] in his left leg and is forced to walk with a [[crutch]] (although Captain Marvel, Jr. bears no such impediment). As a result, Junior sought revenge against Captain Nazi, and the two repeatedly battled over the years.

===Fawcett years===
Captain Marvel Jr. proved to be a popular spin-off character for the Captain Marvel franchise, and appeared in solo adventures in both ''[[Master Comics]]'' and his own ''Captain Marvel, Jr.'' comic book. The character's solo adventures feature an art style, devised by co-creator [[Mac Raboy]], that was more realistic and dramatic style than the style used by [[C. C. Beck]] and the other Fawcett artists for Captain Marvel. 

The stories depicted the plight of working-class and working-poor people during the [[Great Depression|Depression]] and [[World War II]]. The atmosphere was generally much darker artistically and emotionally than the general run of Captain Marvel tales. Even as he fought Japanese air attacks, conferred with United States president [[Franklin Roosevelt]] and United Kingdom Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]], and even came close to capturing [[Adolf Hitler]] himself, Freddy continued to live in a run-down hovel and to dress in shabby rags. His one valuable possession appeared to be his diary, which was written in a large, richly ornamented book.

In most of his adventures, Freddy Freeman is depicted as a character to be pitied for his injury, reminiscent of Tiny Tim from [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', until he transforms into his super-powered state (co-author Beck described the character as resembling both Tiny Tim and [[Peter Pan]]). Ironically, as Captain Marvel Jr., he is unable to introduce himself to anyone, since he would transform back into Freddy Freeman after pronouncing the first two words in his name.

Junior, Captain Marvel, and [[Mary Marvel]] began appearing together in ''The Marvel Family'' comic book beginning in 1945. That title and Junior's own ran until 1953, when [[Fawcett Publications]] discontinued all the Marvel Family comic books as the result of a lawsuit brought by National Comics (later [[DC Comics]]).

===''Shazam!'' revival===
After Fawcett Comics folded, Captain Marvel Jr. remained unpublished, alongside the rest of the [[Marvel Family]], for years. In 1972, DC Comics purchased the rights to the Marvel Family characters and revived them in a new series entitled ''Shazam!'' In his 1970s adventures, Captain Marvel, Jr. discovered that fellow super hero [[Kid Eternity]] was in fact his long-lost brother. This [[retcon]] took place because of the characters' very similar origins. Both characters' origins involved the death of a grandfather, and both characters also rely on magic words that form part of their super hero names (and therefore neither hero can speak his name without triggering his powers). In reality, Kid Eternity had been published by another company, [[Quality Comics]], whose characters DC had also purchased.

===''Power of Shazam!''===<!--needs to include Freddy's post-Crisis publication history and the ''Power of Shazam!'' revival-->

Freddy Freeman was reintroduced in ''The Power of Shazam!'' #3 (although he makes a very brief cameo in the ''Power of Shazam!'' graphic novel). The modern version of Captain Marvel Jr.'s origin, depicted in ''Power of Shazam!'' #3–8, closely followed his Fawcett origin with several minor changes.

===''The Trials of Shazam!''===
The ''Trials of Shazam!'' maxi-series published by DC Comics, written by [[Judd Winick]] and drawn by [[Howard Porter]], is re-envisioning the Captain Marvel and Captain Marvel Jr. characters. The maxi-series focuses on Freddy's quest to become Captain Marvel's successor under the name Shazam. Rather than be blessed with the abilities of the gods by saying a magic word, Freddy must go through heroic quests to earn the favor of each deity.  Noteably, in this run there is a challenger for the powers in the form of Sabina.  Freddy has so far received the Wisdom of Solomon, the Courage of Achilles, half the Strenght of Hercules and half the Magic of Apollo.  Within the series, Sabina is stealling the gifts of the Gods, and kills Atlas stealing his stamina, steals half the strenght of Hercules, and is granted half the Magic of Apollo.  Freddy must now race for the Speed of Mercury, and then finally try for the Might of Zeus.  This story is on going

==Fictional character biography==
Freddy Freeman was reintroduced in ''[[The Power of Shazam!]]'' #3 (although he makes a very brief cameo in the ''Power of Shazam!'' graphic novel). The modern version of Captain Marvel, Jr.'s origin, depicted in ''Power of Shazam!'' #3-8, closely followed his Fawcett origin with several minor changes.

In this new origin story, Freddy Freeman was an all-star student and athlete at the Binder school. One of Freddy's friends was Billy Batson, Captain Marvel's alter ego, who worked as a boy reporter for [[WHIZ (comics)|WHIZ]] radio. At a WHIZ radio spelling bee hosted by Billy in ''Power of Shazam!'' #3, Freddy and Billy met Billy's long-lost sister Mary, whom Freddy immediately fell for.  

In ''Power of Shazam!'' #6, Freddy and his grandfather went on a fishing trip in the Fawcett Bay, while Captain Marvel was engaged in a battle with Captain Nazi. Just as in the Fawcett origin, Captain Marvel knocks Captain Nazi into the lake, and the Freemans are attacked when they attempt to save the villain. Captain Marvel intervenes and rushes both injured bystanders to a hospital. Grandpa Jacob slips into a coma, and Freddy is found to have a severely injured spine and a broken leg.

The injured Freddy is taken to the wizard Shazam by Captain Marvel and [[Mary Marvel]], who grant the boy the power to become Captain Marvel Jr. However, Grandpa Jacob dies, and Freddy goes on a rampage against Captain Nazi as Captain Marvel, Jr. until the other Marvels intervene.

====''Teen Titans''====
In ''Power of Shazam!'' #13, Captain Marvel Jr. was written out of the book so that he could begin appearing in ''[[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]]'' with issue #17 of that book. In the issue, Junior gets into a fight with Captain Marvel and quits the Marvel Family. Freddy leaves Fawcett and then receives help from Superboy to find out what to do with his life, which leads him to the Teen Titans.

Junior appeared in solo adventures in three special issues of ''Power of Shazam!'' (#14, #19, and #37), with art by guest artists such as [[Gil Kane]] and [[Joe Staton]]. These issues find Junior starting a new life in New York, where he joins the Titans team.

At this time, the character's name was changed to ''CM3'' (short for Captain Marvel Three, with Billy being CM1 and Mary CM2), so that he could identify himself without changing. After ''Teen Titans'' was canceled in mid-1998, Junior returned to ''Power of Shazam!'' until that book's cancellation at the end of the year.

====''Outsiders''====

After the demise of ''Power of Shazam!'', Captain Marvel Jr. made sporadic guest appearances throughout the DC Universe. Beginning in 2004, Junior was once again identified by the name Captain Marvel Junior (not "CM3") and now wears a white [[cape]] like that of the other two Marvels instead of his traditional red one.

During the ''[[Titans Tomorrow]]'' storyline in ''Teen Titans'' vol. 3, Captain Marvel Jr. was shown as a future version of himself called Captain Marvel, having dropped the "Junior" from his name (though he still obtains his powers with the magic words "Captain Marvel"). Later in the series, the present-day Captain Marvel Jr. joined the Titans in a battle against Dr. Light.

In ''[[Outsiders (comics)|The Outsiders]]'' (vol. 3) #10, Captain Marvel Jr. made a guest appearance to battle a new version of [[Sabbac]], named Ishamel Gregor who killed Freddy's ex foster brother Timothy Karnes, the first Sabbac, an old Fawcett Marvel Family foe. By ''Outsiders'' #28, Junior was a member of the Outsiders, although he was apprehensive about the team's dark tone. He and Marvel Family nemeses Sabbac, The Seven Deadly Sins and [[Dr. Sivana]] all played major roles in the series. Following the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' mini-series, Captain Marvel Jr. was no longer a member of the Outsiders.

====''Infinite Crisis'' and ''52''====
Junior also appeared briefly in DC's ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' mini-series in 2006, and as a minor supporting character in the year-long weekly maxi-series, ''[[52 (comics)|52]]''. Junior was sent to Earth-S when it was reformed. When '''New Earth''' was formed, he went with other heroes who could fly to fight Superboy-Prime. In events shown in the ''Infinite Crisis'' hardcover, Freddy joined alongside the other Titans to take down members of the Society who tried to kill Robin.

During the events of ''52'', Marvel Family foe [[Black Adam]] attempts to reform and forms a [[Marvel Family#Black Marvel Family members|Black Marvel Family]]. The Marvel Family attends Black Adam's wedding to [[Isis (DC Comics)|Isis]], and fight along side the Black Marvel Family as they battle Sabbac on Halloween. Seeing [[Osiris (DC Comics)|Osiris]], an analogue of himself, for the first time, Junior plans to investigate him. When Osiris tries to join the Teen Titans, Juniors sponsors him until a scandal results in Osiris being estranged from the Titans. Junior helps save many of Lex Luthor's Everymen who fall from the sky when Lex shuts off their powers on New Year's Day.

Freddy and Osiris have a small scuff in the Rock of Eternity. Following the deaths of Isis and Osiris, Junior and Mary carry Osiris's coffin to its tomb and the Marvels attempt to comfort Black Adam. Too angry for their help, Black Adam begins [[World War III (DC Comics)|World War III]] and Captain Marvel Jr. joins the fight to stop him.

====''The Trials of Shazam!''====

Freddy Freeman is the main character in [[Judd Winick]] and [[Howard Porter]]'s ''Trials of Shazam!'' limited series. In the aftermath of the wizard Shazam's death in the ''Day of Vengeance'' mini-series, Freddy and Mary lose their powers, which
are then channeled in Captain Marvel himself, causing Billy to change into a white costume and long white hair, taking the place of the deceased wizard Shazam under the name '''Marvel'''.

Bereft of his powers, Freddy finds himself required by the gods who empower the Marvels to undergo a series of trials (à la [[Heracles]]) to prove himself worthy of his powers and become their new champion and herald under the name '''Shazam'''. At the same time, the evil '''Council of Merlin''' backs its representative, a sorceress known as '''Sabina''', to challenge Freddy and attempt to win the power of Shazam in the name of the council. As of issue 9 (October 2007), Freddy has passed the trials of Solomon by undergoing the painful process of getting a tattoo, Achilles by going to Iraq and stopping a Hate Empath, Hercules, gaining knowledge, invulnerability, strength in the process. Atlas has been killed - He has undergone the trial of Apollo, whose healing/renewal ability have replaced Atlas's stamina. 

Note: The current gods that give Freddy his powers are in no way related to the Olympian counterparts. They are known as the Lords of magic, and simply share their names with them.

At some point after the Trials of Shazam, Freddy helps the [[Justice Society of America]] track down Black Adam by [[Mister Terrific (Michael Holt)|Mr. Terrific]]'s T-Sphere's testing Freddy's magic lightning signature (''Black Adam'' #2), and participated in the [[Sinestro Corps War]], seen in the fight with [[Superman-Prime]] (''Green Lantern'' #25).

==Other versions==
[[Image:King marvel-1-.gif|thumb|140px|right|A sketch of King Marvel, an adult version of Captain Marvel Jr. seen in ''[[Kingdom Come (comic book)|Kingdom Come]]'', drawn by [[Alex Ross]].]]
An adult version of Captain Marvel Jr. appears as a background character in the 1996 ''[[Kingdom Come (comic book)|Kingdom Come]]'' miniseries by [[Mark Waid]] and [[Alex Ross]]. In this alternate future setting, Junior now goes by the name '''King Marvel''', and resembles Elvis Presley. Mary Marvel, now called '''Lady Marvel''', is his wife, and the two have a superpowered son, '''The Whiz''', named after ''[[Whiz Comics]]''.

In December 2006, the [[VS System]] Card game released a ''Freddy Freeman <> Captain Marvel'' card. He also has a version known as "Freddy Freeman <> Captain Marvel Junior" version, his first and right now only version as Junior.

===''52''===
In the final issue of ''[[52 (comic book)|52]]'', a new Multiverse is revealed, originally consisting of 52 identical realities. Among the parallel realities shown is one designated Earth-5. As a result of [[Mister Mind]] "eating" aspects of this reality, it takes on visual aspects similar to the pre-Crisis Earth-S, including the Marvel Family characters. The names of the characters are not mentioned in the panel in which they appear, but a character visually similar to Captain Marvel, Jr. appears.<ref>

==Elvis Presley==
The musician [[Elvis Presley]] was a big fan of Captain Marvel Jr., and styled his trademark [[haircut]] after that of the comic book character. In addition, some of Elvis's stage outfits (with a half-cape similar to those worn by the Marvels) and his TCB logo (with a Marvel-esque lightning bolt insignia) also show inspiration from Captain Marvel Jr.<ref>

In reference to Elvis's admiration for the character, Captain Marvel, Jr. has often been shown as either a fan of Elvis or having been inspired by Elvis. In ''Teen Titans'' vol. 3, #23, Captain Marvel Jr. is revealed to be a huge fan of [[Elvis Presley]]. The narrator ([[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]]) states that "He's okay, just a little too into the retro thing for my tastes. Loves all that [[rockabilly]] crap. Flame shirts and hot dice belt buckles." Captain Marvel Jr. himself quotes Elvis (whom he refers to as "the greatest modern-day philosopher if you ask me", to which [[Hawk and Dove|Hawk]] immediately states that she likes [[Sex Pistols]] bass guitarist [[Sid Vicious]] better) as a role-model: "Do what's right for you as long as you don't hurt no one."
