'''Batwing''' ('''James "Jimmy" Santini''') is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe. He is a [[mutate (comics)|mutate]]. His first appearance was in ''[[Untold Tales of Spider-Man]]'' #2.

==Fictional character biography==
Young Jimmy Santini was with his father in an investigation of illegal [[toxic waste]] dumping in [[Carlsbad Caverns National Park]] where his father was either shot in the back by the polluters or fell to his death in the deep caverns (the full details were murky in Jimmy's diary). Jimmy was lost in the caverns and drank water that "tasted like metal." He was eventually rescued and returned to his mother. Soon the chemicals began to take effect, and Jimmy sprouted wings. His mother proclaimed him a [[demon]], causing Jimmy to run away. He continued to mutate and ended up stealing food to survive. He arrived in New York City and made his home under an old pier. Jimmy began stealing food from people dining on rooftops scaring people in the process. Thus, the people began to dub him "Batwing."

When New York City Councilman Randolph Cherryh was once dining with his girlfriend, Batwing appeared and stole some of his apples which humiliated Randolph. Randolph Cherryh placed a bounty on him which Peter Parker (alias [[Spider-Man]]) decided to take part on during his financial problems. Randolph arranged for a party as part of a trap. When Batwing came, the police sprang and began shooting only for Spider-Man to web up the guns and pursue Batwing. Batwing battled with Spider-Man before fleeing back to where he lived under the pier. 

When Spider-Man followed Batwing to the pier, he discovered that Batwing was just a scared kid who was stealing food to survive. Spider-Man read some of his history before Jimmy ran off right into the Councilman who secretly followed in his helicopter. Randolph did not care if Batwing was just a kid, and he was about to kill the boy when Spider-Man webbed down his men. Batwing fled despite Spider-Man's offer to get [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] or [[Henry Pym]] to help cure him. Randolph vowed to ruin Spider-Man's life before having his mouth webbed and himself being shoved into a garbage can.<ref>''Untold Tales of Spider-Man'' #2</ref>

Spider-Man continued to bring food to Jimmy who still fears people like Randolph Cherryh.<ref>''Untold Tales of Spider-Man'' #7</ref>

Spider-Man later asked Dr. Curt Connors (the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]]) to use his expertise to help cure Jimmy. When an accident causes Curt to become the Lizard again, Batwing helps Spider-Man track him down and cure Curt. Curt and Jimmy leave New York for someplace quiet where Jimmy can be cured.<ref>''Untold Tales of Spider-Man'' #9</ref> When Curt's cure fails, Batwing returns to New York and battles Spider-Man again. With his father dead and his mother rejecting him, Jimmy just wanted to die. Spider-Man tracks down Jimmy's mother and tells her that Jimmy is still her son, regardless of his condition, and that she was wrong to reject him. Just as Batwing is about to be shot by the [[New York Police Department]], Jimmy's mother intervenes and tells her son that she still loves him. Upon hearing this and knowing that he is loved, Jimmy reverts back to his human form, and the police back off. Jimmy goes home with his mother, finally receiving the love that he had needed so badly.<ref>''Untold Tales of Spider-Man'' #24</ref>
