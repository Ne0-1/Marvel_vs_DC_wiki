'''Skullfire (Timothy Fitzgerald)''' is a [[fictional character]] in [[Marvel Comics|Marvel Comics's]] [[Marvel 2099|2099 universe]], a look at superheroes in the year [[2099]]. He was one of the founding members of a future incarnation of the [[X-Men]] called [[X-Men 2099]]. The character was deemed worthy to have his own action figure.

==Fictional character biography==
'''Timothy Fitzgerald''' was a wealthy, [[young urban professional]] until his mutant powers manifested. An uncontrollable burst of energy destroyed his apartment and killed his girlfriend, Reiko. Timothy went into hiding, living on the streets. He was approached by [[Cerebra]], who gave him a card and told him to go to [[Las Vegas]].

In Las Vegas, Timothy joined the future X-team, [[X-Men 2099]]. He had his reservations about joining, but found he had little choice in the matter after using his mutant power of channeling the energy around him and helping to botch the assassination of X-Men 2099's leader, [[Xi'an (comics)|Xi'an Chi Xan]]; other members of the team rushed to Fitzgerald's aid and they all sped off in a van to get Xi'an medical help. From that point on, Tim was considered a mainstay in the team. He became close friends with '''Serpentina''', another X-Man, but she was killed by [[Junkpile]].

Tim struggled with controlling his powers, but after pent-up dramatic events were opened in his mind by the [[psychic vampire]], [[La Lunatica]], he became much more adept at refocusing energy at will. Tim also experienced a transformation in his personality, becoming much less shy and more of a daredevil, occasionally even suicidal.

Tim later encountered La Lunatica again and wanted to pay her back for her attack. Instead they ended up as romantic partners. Timothy offered to help her against the [[Theatre of Pain (comics)|Theatre of Pain]], but  found that his powers were no match for [[Brimstone Love]], the leader of the Theatre of Pain. The X-men's leader Xi'an decided to join the Theatre though and Brimstone Love left with him. With Xi'an gone, Timothy now took over leadership over the X-Men and Luna became a member. After restoring Xi'an to normal and defeating the Theatre of Pain, Timothy and his X-Men were offered to protect Halo City by [[Doom 2099|President Victor von Doom]]. The X-Men were now special police officers and under their protection Halo City became a place where humans and mutants could live in peace. 

The peace was short-lived though as a villain called the Graverobber resurrected several dead mutants, including Serpentina as the Undead. Dependent on the Graverobber for their continued existence, the Undead followed his orders and went to Halo City to kill [[Cerebra |Cerebra's]] father, '''Zail Haddad''', a ruthless businessman who had been responsible for the Graverobber's transformation from a normal human into a corpse-like being. The Undead used Serpentina to lure Timothy into a trap and killed him with a poison dart. They then stole his body from the morgue and the Graverobber resurrected Timothy. As one of the Undead, Timothy was used to take Halo City hostage: he entered the Halo City [[powerplant]] and absorbed all its output, causing a city-wide blackout. The Graverobber was defeated and knocked out. With the Graverobber unconscious, all of the Undead died again, except for Timothy, who now was powered by the absorbed energy of the entire city. 

Towards the end of the series, Tim died again in an attack by '''Vulcann''' and '''Darkson'''. This time his body was completely destroyed by the [[telekinesis|telekinetic]] Darkson, but an energy being in the form of Reiko informed Timothy about the true nature of his powers; Timothy's body had been just a shell for the being of pure energy living inside. She offered him to join a society of other energy beings, but Timothy returned to the X-men to be with Luna. He disappeared between the end of ''X-Men: 2099'' and the beginning of ''2099: World of Tomorrow'', and neither he nor his disappearance were ever mentioned, even by his girlfriend.

==Powers==
Originally Skullfire was capable of absorbing all forms of [[ambient]] energy particles into his body where he metabolized it to a usable form and then dispersed it in destructive energy blasts. He had no control over this power though and was only capable of using it during moments of great stress. [[Cerebra]]'s powers allowed her to trigger his powers at will, but she had to make physical contact with him. After [[La Lunatica]] made him relive Reiko's death, Timothy could control his powers at will. Absorbing the energy of Halo City's powerplants gave Timothy a permanent source of power, but as a side-effect he was constantly glowing with a green light. 

When his body was destroyed, Timothy existed as a small sphere of energy. Timothy managed to take a form that resembled his human form. He now was capable of levitation and could absorb and channel the energy around him with far more ease and control. 

==Notes==
* Tim never took the name '''Skullfire''' for himself in the comics.
* His face is not naturally white and black, but was painted on by him so that he could better "fit" with La Lunatica.
