==Fictional character biography==
===Post-Crisis===
Born (allegedly, see below) to a [[French people|French]] father and a [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] mother, Jade Nguyen had an unhappy childhood and was sold into [[slavery]]. As a young adult, after killing her master, Jade was informally adopted by Chinese freedom fighter Weng Chan, who taught her all he knew about [[guerrilla]] fighting. She acquired knowledge of [[poison]]s from Kruen Musenda, a famed African assassin known as the "Spitting Cobra", whom she was married to for the two years prior to his death.

She is a long-standing rival of the superhero team the [[Teen Titans]]. However, when Roy Harper, a.k.a. the archer [[Roy Harper (comics)|Speedy]], went undercover for the government in a mission to get her confidence and turn her over, the two fell passionately in love. Knowing he would not be able to turn her in, he walked out; Cheshire would not learn his true identity until later. The result of their romance was a daughter, Lian, whom Roy raised.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Returning to her mercenary ways after leaving Lian behind for Roy, Jade saved [[Deathstroke]]'s life so he could help her in stealing [[nuclear weapons]] from [[Russia]] in an attempt to blackmail the world. To prove she is not bluffing, she obliterates the fictional [[Middle East]] nation of [[Qurac]], reasoning that since Qurac is a stronghold of [[Muslim]] [[terrorist]]s, that Western countries would be secretly grateful.<ref>''Deathstroke'' #19 (Feb 1993) [[DC Comics]]</ref> Cheshire's plans were foiled when her base came under attack and she was forced to flee. She later created her own team, The Ravens.

Cheshire volunteered to join Tartarus, a group created by [[Vandal Savage]] with the objective of destroying the Titans. During a confrontation with the Titans and the H.I.V.E, Savage shot Cheshire to distract Arsenal. She recovered, but was taken into custody for crimes including destroying Qurac. Sentenced to life imprisonment, she was broken out by the Ravens. Arsenal, however, forced her back into custody.

Eventually, Cheshire discovers that her biological father was a Senator named Robert Pullman, and she attempted to torture and kill him. To that end, she defeated [[Lady Shiva]], and devised a plan to use her to fake her own death and flee the country with her daughter. Jade ties up Shiva, [[duct tape]]s her mouth shut, and locks her in the trunk of her car (which was wired to explode), hoping that the authorities will find the charred body of an Asian woman in the flaming car wreck and believe that Jade was killed while fleeing the Senator's murder. Unfortunately for her, [[Catwoman]] and [[Gypsy (comics)|Gypsy]] show up and untie Shiva, while [[Huntress (Helena Bertinelli)|Huntress]] and [[Black Canary]] stop Jade from murdering the Senator, and then took her into custody. While escaping the scene of the attempted assassination, Jade is punched in the face and thrown out of the helicopter the women were escaping in by Black Canary to avoid being beaten to death by an enraged Shiva.

In 2005, she appeared in the [[miniseries]] ''[[Villains United]]'' as a member of the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]]. Cheshire had been blackmailed into joining by Mockingbird, who claimed that there was a small bomb implanted in the back of Lian's head. During the series, she slept with Thomas Blake, a.k.a. [[Catman (comics)|Catman]], and became pregnant with a replacement child, thereby allowing her to leave the team and no longer needing to worry for Lian's safety. At the end of the miniseries, having betrayed the Six to [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.|Luthor]]'s Society, she is shot and critically wounded by Deathstroke. As the faux Luthor orders the Society's withdrawal, one of his last commands is to bring Cheshire with, provided she's still alive.

After the "Villains United" series, she later turned up alive, living in a mansion in the [[Himalaya Mountains]] with her son by Blake. Working with Vandal Savage again, she put out hits on the other members of the Secret Six except for Blake. Taking matters into her own hands, she stabs the [[Mad Hatter (comics)|Mad Hatter]], who is working with the Six. Her blade was poisoned (as usual) and she later bartered the antidote to the poison to Catman in exchange for her safety.

In ''[[Justice League of America]]'' (vol. 2) #12, Cheshire was shown in prison, receiving a visit from Roy Harper and Lian.

In the ''Justice League of America Wedding Special'', Cheshire was shown to be a member of the new [[Injustice League]]. She was later seen among the exiled villains in [[Salvation Run]].

Cheshire returned as a member of a small army of villains attempting to collect massive bounties on the heads of the Secret Six. She manages to poison the meals of her targets, but is defeated by [[Jeannette (comics)|Jeannette]].

Cheshire loses the will to fight and tearfully recalls the loss of her child. Roy comforts her and the two of them attempt to sleep together. However, due to Roy's [[impotence]] he is unable to please Cheshire in bed, which causes more turmoil in Roy's life forcing him to angrily leave.<ref>''Justice League: Rise and Fall of Arsenal'' #3 (May 2010)</ref>

In ''[[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]]'' Cheshire's son from her involvement with [[Catman (comics)|Catman]] (Thomas Blake) is kidnapped, chronologically this takes place after the death of Lian. Catman goes on a murderous rampage believing the child to already be dead only to find the man who orchestrated the kidnapping has given the boy to a loving childless couple and that the kidnapping itself was an act of revenge against Cheshire for murdering his family. Catman, after realizing the child is better left where he is, informs Cheshire that their son is dead. This sends her in to a sorrowful rage, while Catman tells his son to rest in peace after killing all of the kidnappers involved.<ref>''Secret Six'' (vol. 3) #22 (June 2010)</ref>

Cheshire is now a member of Deathstroke's new team of [[Teen Titans#Brightest Day: Titans- Villains for Hire|Titans]]. Their first assignment was murdering [[Atom (Ryan Choi)|Ryan Choi]].<ref>''Titans: Villains For Hire Special'' (May 2010)</ref> It is unforeseen how long she will stay on the team, but it seems one of Deathstroke's goals is to taunt her into overcoming her lost edge after Lian's death.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #25 (July 2010)</ref> She later contacts Roy, forcing him into joining Deathstroke's team so the two of them can kill Deathstroke. Cheshire rationalizes that Roy "owes" her for Lian's death, but while it appears Roy double-crosses her, it is part of Cheshire's plan.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #26 (August 2010)</ref> Afterward, Deathstroke and his team arrive at South Pacific Island to kill cult leader, Drago, over the arena production of blind warriors; however, his team, Cheshire, and Roy betray him, revealing that they had been working with Drago.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #33 (March 2011)</ref> Cheshire and Roy's plan backfired, because Drago never intended to give Cheshire her freedom back. Their attempt to defeat Drago and escape failed miserably. Later, Drago explained to Cheshire that he needs an heir,and she was going to provide him with one.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #34 (April 2011)</ref> Drago tries to convince Cheshire to succumb to him, but Drago was reading her mind and using her thoughts against her.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #35 (May 2011)</ref> Cheshire is rescue by Deathstroke and the Titans. When Drago was defeated, Deathstroke allows him to live and the Titans then leave from his island.

Cheshire accepts, but Roy refuses, saying that he has been punishing himself for his daughter's death and that Lian is in a better place. Cheshire joins [[Tattooed Man#Mark Richards|Tattooed Man]] and [[Cinder (comics)|Cinder]] in fighting the other Titans to destroy the Methuselah Device.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #37 (July 2011)</ref> After Cinder sacrifices to destroy the Methuselah, Cheshire leave and tells Roy that she will never forgive him.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #38 (August 2011)</ref>

Cheshire ultimately lets the woman live, but reveals that she has a past connection with [[Tigress (DC Comics)|Artemis]]. Later in "Targets", she and [[Sportsmaster]] are apparently hired by [[Ra's al Ghul]] to assassinate [[Lex Luthor]] and a pair of diplomats from warring nations. She is foiled by [[Aqualad]] and [[Roy Harper (comics)|Red Arrow]]. In the episode "Home Front," it is revealed that this version of Cheshire is Artemis' older sister who ran away from her father when she was young (she uses her mother's last name, "Nguyen", as hers, rather than her father's last name, "Crock"). In "Insecurity," Cheshire runs into Artemis when Young Justice is staking out Sportsmaster's activities; in the episode it is revealed that Sportsmaster is Artemis' father and that her mother used to be [[Huntress (comics)|The Huntress]].

In season two, In "Salvage," it is shown that Cheshire is married to Red Arrow and has a baby girl, Lian Nguyen-Harper. In "Bloodlines," Red Arrow and Chesire infiltrate a temple in Tibet where they believe the real Roy Harper is hidden. After fighting through the guards, Red Arrow and Cheshire find the real Roy Harper cryogenically frozen. In "Satisfaction," Sportsmaster and Cheshire oversee Paula Crock and Kid Flash visiting Artemis' grave. Sportsmaster tells her that [[Black Manta]] let Aqualad "kill" Artemis without permission, damaging Sportsmaster's image, and seeks payback. In "True Colors," Cheshire pilots a helicopter to help Sportsmaster escape from The Light's headquarters in the Mongolian Mountains. Afterwards, Sportsmaster tells Cheshire that they are free to pursue their goals of vengeance and/or restoration of Sportsmaster's reputation. In "Complications," Cheshire and Sportsmaster infiltrate Black Manta's ship in order to get revenge on Black Manta and Aqualad. After Tigress shuts down the controls of Miss Martian's Inhibitor Collar, Miss Martian uses her powers to stop the fighting, and to reveal that Artemis is alive posing as Tigress. Afterwards, Tigress and Miss Martian let Cheshire get away with Sportsmaster. After picking up her child, Cheshire starts to tell her mother about the truth of Artemis.
