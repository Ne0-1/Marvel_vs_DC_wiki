==Fictional character biography==
Born (allegedly, see below) to a [[French people|French]] father and a [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] mother, Jade Nguyen had an unhappy childhood and was sold into [[slavery]]. As a young adult, after killing her master, Jade was informally adopted by Chinese freedom fighter Weng Chan, who taught her all he knew about [[guerrilla]] fighting. She acquired knowledge of [[poison]]s from Kruen Musenda, a famed African assassin known as the "Spitting Cobra" and to whom she was married for the two years prior to his death.

She is a long-standing rival of the superhero team the [[Teen Titans]]. However, when Roy Harper, a.k.a. the archer [[Roy Harper (comics)|Speedy]], went undercover for the government in a mission to get her confidence and turn her over, the two fell passionately in love. Knowing he would not be able to turn her in, he walked out; Cheshire would not learn his true identity until later. The result of their romance was a daughter, Lian, whom Roy raised.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Returning to her mercenary ways after leaving Lian behind for Roy, Jade saved [[Deathstroke]]'s life so he could help her in stealing [[nuclear weapons]] from [[Russia]] in an attempt to blackmail the world. To prove she is not bluffing, she obliterates the fictional [[Middle East]] nation of [[Qurac]], reasoning that since Qurac is a stronghold of [[Muslim]] [[terrorist]]s, that Western countries would be secretly grateful.<ref>''Deathstroke'' #19 (Feb 1993) [[DC Comics]]</ref> Cheshire's plans were foiled when her base came under attack and she was forced to flee. She later created her own team, The Ravens.

Cheshire volunteered to join Tartarus, a group created by [[Vandal Savage]] with the objective of destroying the Titans. During a confrontation with the Titans and the H.I.V.E, Savage shot Cheshire to distract Arsenal. She recovered, but was taken into custody for crimes including destroying Qurac. Sentenced to life imprisonment, she was broken out by the Ravens. Arsenal, however, forced her back into custody.

Eventually, Cheshire discovers that her biological father was a Senator named Robert Pullman, and she attempted to torture and kill him. To that end, she defeated [[Lady Shiva]], and devised a plan to use her to fake her own death and flee the country with her daughter. Jade ties up Shiva, [[duct tape]]s her mouth shut, and locks her in the trunk of her car (which was wired to explode), hoping that the authorities will find the charred body of an Asian woman in the flaming car wreck and believe that Jade was killed while fleeing the Senator's murder. Unfortunately for her, [[Catwoman]] and [[Gypsy (comics)|Gypsy]] show up and untie Shiva, while [[Huntress (Helena Bertinelli)|Huntress]] and [[Black Canary]] stop Jade from murdering the Senator, and then took her into custody. While escaping the scene of the attempted assassination, Jade is punched in the face and thrown out of the helicopter the girls were escaping in by Black Canary to avoid being beaten to death by an enraged Shiva.

In 2005, she appeared in the [[miniseries]] ''[[Villains United]]'' as a member of the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]]. Cheshire had been blackmailed into joining by Mockingbird, whom claimed that there was a small bomb implanted in the back of Lian's head. During the series, she slept with Thomas Blake, a.k.a. [[Catman (comics)|Catman]], and became pregnant with a replacement child. At the end of the miniseries, having betrayed the Six to Lex Luthor's Society, she is shot and critically wounded by Deathstroke. As the faux Luthor orders the Society's withdrawal, one of his last commands is to bring Cheshire with, provided she's still alive.

After the "Villains United" series, she later turned up alive, living in a mansion in the [[Himalaya Mountains]] with her son by Blake. Working with Vandal Savage again, she put out hits on the other members of the Secret Six except for Blake. Taking matters into her own hands, she stabs the [[Mad Hatter (comics)|Mad Hatter]], who is working with the Six. Her blade was poisoned (as usual) and she later bartered the antidote to the poison to Catman in exchange for her safety.

In ''[[Justice League of America]]'' (vol. 2) #12, Cheshire was shown in prison, receiving a visit from Roy Harper and Lian.

In the ''Justice League of America Wedding Special'', Cheshire was shown to be a member of the new [[Injustice League]]. She was later seen among the exiled villains in [[Salvation Run]].

Cheshire returned as a member of a small army of villains attempting to collect massive bounties on the heads of the Secret Six. She manages to poison the meals of her targets, but is defeated by [[Jeannette (comics)|Jeannette]].

In ''[[Justice League: Cry for Justice]],'' Star City is destroyed by [[Prometheus (comics)|Prometheus]], killing Lian.<ref>''Justice League: Cry for Justice'' #7 (March 2010)</ref> Cheshire attacks Roy, outraged at him for not keeping Lian safe, injuring him in the process.<ref>''Justice League: Rise and Fall of Arsenel'' #2 (April 2010)</ref> Both Roy and Cheshire continue to fight however Roy manages to pin Cheshire against the wall. Cheshire loses the will to fight and tearfully recalls the loss of her child. Roy comforts her and the two of them attempt to sleep together. However, due to Roy's [[impotence]] he is unable to please Cheshire in bed, which causes more turmoil in Roy's life forcing him to angrily leave. <ref>''Justice League: Rise and Fall of Arsenal'' #3 (May 2010)</ref>

In ''[[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]]'' Cheshire's son from her involvement with [[Catman (comics)|Catman]] (Thomas Blake) is kidnapped, chronologically this takes place after the death of Lian. Catman goes on a murderous rampage believing the child to already be dead only to find the man who orchestrated the kidnapping has given the boy to a loving childless couple and that the kidnapping itself was an act of revenge against Cheshire for murdering his family. Catman, after realizing the child is better left where he is, informs Cheshire that their son is dead. This sends her in to a sorrowfull rage, while Catman tells his son to rest in peace after killing all of the kidnappers involved.<ref>''Secret Six'' (vol. 3) #22 (June 2010)</ref>

Cheshire is now a member of Deathstroke's new team of [[Teen Titans#Brightest Day: Titans- Villains for Hire|Titans]]. Their first assignment was murdering [[Atom (comics)#Ryan Choi|Ryan Choi]].<ref>''Titans: Villains For Hire Special'' (May 2010)</ref> It is unforeseen how long she will stay on the team, but it seems one of Deathstroke's goals is to taunt her into overcoming her lost edge after Lian's death.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #25 (July 2010)</ref> She later contacts Roy, forcing him into joining Deathstroke's team so the two of them can kill Deathstroke. Cheshire rationalizes that Roy "owes" her for Lian's death, but while it appears Roy double-crosses her, it is part of Cheshire's plan.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #26 (August 2010)</ref>

===Fatherhood question===
In the ''Birds of Prey'' story arc ''Sensei and Student'', Cheshire herself stated that she finally found out the real identity of her father. According to her, it was U.S. Senator Robert Pullman who raped her mother and left her alone with her unborn child. This would be a [[retcon]], but it remains to be seen whether Jade is really telling the truth.

==Powers and abilities==
Besides being a skilled hand-to-hand combatant trained in several martial arts thought forever lost, Cheshire is an expert triple-jointed acrobat and uses this skill to move quickly and unexpectedly. Of bigger concern are her artificial fingernails, which she dips in several varieties of poisons.  She gives her weapons and other accessories a similar treatment. In ''[[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]] #63'', Black Canary calls her "the second most deadly assassin in the world", only topped by Lady Shiva.

==Other versions==
A version of Cheshire appeared in ''Teen Titans Go!'' #34. In ''Teen Titans Go!'' #39, she appeared again, but her rematch with [[Speedy (comics)|Speedy]] (Roy Harper, in his original superheroic identity) was interrupted when [[Larry the Titan]] shot the two of them with [[Cupid]]'s arrows, causing them to (at least temporarily) fall in love. On the page where all the couples are creating chaos in the Titans Tower, it is seen in the back that Cheshire has taken off her mask to show Speedy her face, but it's shown from the back so the reader isn't able to see her face.

==In other media==
[[Image:Chesire.jpg|thumb|100px|Cheshire as seen in the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' episode "Calling All Titans."]]
Cheshire was one of the new villains appearing in season 5 of the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series. She appears as a recruit of the [[Brotherhood of Evil]]. She resembles her comic incarnation, just apparently younger with a cat mask. She has the ability to turn invisible except for the eyes and grin of her mask, much like the [[Cheshire Cat]] in ''[[Alice In Wonderland]]''. She is also extremely skilled at martial arts, and uses her long kimono sleeves, metal claws and her long hair as her primary weapons. She first captures [[Roy Harper (comics)|Speedy]] for the Brotherhood, and later helps in defeating [[Herald (comics)|Herald]] inside the Brotherhood HQ, but she is not seen for the remainder of the battle.

In an interview with ''[[IGN]]'', actress [[Kelly Hu]] confirmed that she will be playing both Cheshire's mother and older sister in ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]''.<ref>http://tv.ign.com/articles/113/1131283p1.html</ref>
