'''Cheshire''', real name Jade Nguyen, is a [[DC Comics]] villain, one of the world's top [[assassins]] and [[mercenaries]].  

==Biography==
Born to a [[French people|French]] father and a [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] mother, she had an unhappy childhood and was sold into [[slavery]]. This trauma made her [[psychotic]], mentally unstable and paved her way into becoming one of the world's most ruthless mercenaries.

She is a long-standing rival of the [[Teen Titans]], but despite their differences, had a passionate relationship with Roy Harper, AKA the superhero [[Speedy (comics)|Arsenal]]. They have a daughter, Lian.

Her single most notorious crime was without doubt the nuclear destruction of a nation. In an attempt to blackmail the world, she stole [[nuclear weapons]] from [[Russia]], and to prove she was not bluffing, she obliterated the fictional Middle-East nation of Qurac. Her reasoning was that Qurac was a stronghold of Muslim terrorists, thus western countries would be secretly grateful.

{{spoiler}}
In 2005 she appeared in the miniseries ''[[Villains United]]'' as a member of the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]]. At the end of the miniseries, having betrayed the Six to Lex Luthor's Society, she was shot and critically wounded by [[Deathstroke]], who reasoned that "We don't need any traitors in the Society." Her status remains unknown, but [[Lex Luthor|Luthor]] asked the Society to bring her in if she survived.

==Powers==
Cheshire is an absolutely lethal hand-to-hand fighter. In ''[[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]] #63'', [[Black Canary]] calls her "the second most deadly assassin in the world', only topped by [[Lady Shiva]]. In addition, she is also an expert on [[poison]]s, preferring to douse her fingernails into a vast variety of deadly chemicals.

==Animated Series==
Cheshire is one of the new villains appearing in season 5 of the [[Teen Titans (animated series)|Teen Titans animated series]].  She resembles her comic incarnation, just apparently younger with a cat-like mask.
