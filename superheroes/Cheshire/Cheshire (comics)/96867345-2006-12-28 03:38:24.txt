'''Cheshire''', real name Jade Nguyen, is a [[DC Comics]] villain, one of the world's top [[assassins]] and [[mercenaries]].  

==Fictional character biography==
Born (allegedly, see below) to a [[French people|French]] father and a [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] mother, she had an unhappy childhood and was sold into [[slavery]]. This trauma made her [[psychotic]], mentally unstable and paved her way into becoming one of the world's most ruthless mercenaries.

After killing her master, Jade is informally adopted by Chinese freedom fighter Weng Chan, who teaches her all he knows about [[guerrilla]] fighting. She acquires knowledge of [[poison]]s from Kruen Musenda, a famed African assassin known as the "Spitting Cobra" and to whom she is married for the two years prior to his death.

She is a long-standing rival of the superhero team the [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]]. However, when Roy Harper, a.k.a. the archer [[Arsenal (comics)|Arsenal]], goes undercover for the government in a mission to get her confidence and turn her over, the two fall passionately in love. Knowing he will not be able to turn her in, he walks out; Cheshire would not learn his true identity until later. The result of their romance is a daughter, Lian, whom Roy is raising. by Roy. Despite her own shortcomings, Jade loves her daughter.

Returning to her mercenary ways after leaving Lian behind for Roy, Jade saves [[Deathstroke]]'s life so he could help her in stealing [[nuclear weapons]] from [[Russia]] in an attempt to blackmail the world. To prove she is not bluffing, she obliterates the fictional [[Middle East]] nation of [[Qurac]], reasoning that since Qurac is a stronghold of [[Muslim]] [[terrorists,]] that Western countries would be secretly grateful.<ref>''Deathstroke'' #19 (Feb. 93)</ref>. Cheshire's plans are foiled when her base comes under attack and she is forced to flee. She later creates her own team, The Ravens. 

Cheshire volunteers to join Tartarus, a group created  by [[Vandal Savage]] with the objective of destroying the Titans. During a confrontation with the Titans and the H.I.V.E, Savage shoots Cheshire to distract Arsenal. She recovers, but is taken into custody for crimes including destroying Qurac. Sentenced to life imprisonment, she is broken out by the Ravens. Arsenal, however, forces her back into custody.

{{spoiler}}
In 2005 she appeared in the [[miniseries]] ''[[Villains United]]'' as a member of the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]]. During the series she had relations with Thomas Blake, a.k.a. [[Catman]], and became pregnant. At the end of the miniseries, having betrayed the Six to Lex Luthor's Society, she is shot and critically wounded by [[Deathstroke]]. Though apparently killed, she later turns up alive, living in a mansion in the [[Himalaya Mountains]] with her son by Blake. She put out hits on the other members of the Secret Six except for Blake. Taking matters into her own hands, she stabs [[Mad Hatter (comics)|The Mad Hatter]], who is working with the Six. Her blade was poisoned (as usual) and she later bartered the antidote to the poison to Catman in exchange for her safety.

== Fatherhood question ==
In the ''Birds of Prey'' story arc ''Sensei and Student'', Cheshire herself stated that she finally found out the real identity of her father. According to her, it was U.S. Senator Robert Pullman who raped her mother and left her alone with her unborn child. This would be a [[retcon]], but it has to be seen whether Jade is really telling the truth.

== Powers and abilities ==
Cheshire is an absolutely lethal hand-to-hand fighter. In ''[[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]] #63'', [[Black Canary]] calls her "the second most deadly assassin in the world', only topped by [[Lady Shiva]]. In addition, she is also an expert on [[poison]]s, possibly second only to [[Poison Ivy]] in the DC universe. She coats her fingernails, finger jewelery and weapons with a variety of deadly chemicals.

Cheshire is one of the new villains appearing in season 5 of the ''[[Teen Titans (animated series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series. She resembles her comic incarnation, just apparently younger with a cat mask. She is apparently one of the most skilled of the villains sent by the [[Brotherhood of Evil]] to capture the Titans. She uses her long kimono sleeves as a defense (at least against ranged projectiles such as Speedy's arrows) and metal claws as weapons as well as her long hair to pound her adversaries, and is extremely skilled at martial arts as she manages to defeat Speedy in combat and capture him. She later helps in defeating Herald inside the Brotherhood HQ.

She also appeared in ''Teen Titans Go!'' #34.
