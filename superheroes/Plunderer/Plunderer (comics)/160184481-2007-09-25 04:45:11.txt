The '''Plunderer''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]].

==Fictional character biography==
'''Parnival Plunder''' was the younger brother of [[Ka-Zar|Kevin Plunder]]. When their father discovered the [[Savage Land]], word leaked out and he sent Kevin to live there and Parnival to live as a sailor to keep them safe. Believing Kevin had been killed, Parnival established himself as the lord of Castle Plunder as a front for his criminal activities as the Plunderer. Upon learning that his step-brother had survived in the Savage Land as Ka-Zar, the two clashed on several occasions.

During the [[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]], the Plunderer sought out refuge with [[Captain America]]. However, the [[Punisher]] executed [[Goldbug (comics)|Goldbug]] and the Plunderer before Captain America could stop him.
