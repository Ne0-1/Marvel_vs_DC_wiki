'''Night Nurse''' is the name of a [[Marvel Comics]] [[comic-book]] series published in the early 1970s, as well the [[alter ego]] of a [[fictional character]], Linda Carter, known for her willingness to help injured [[superhero]]es. Carter was one of three central characters created by writer Jean Thomas, who [[first appeared]] in ''Night Nurse'' #1 (November 1972), though she was later identified as the lead of another Marvel series published in 1961.

Carter later adopted the name "Night Nurse" for herself, and in this incarnation first appeared in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]'' vol. 2, #58 (May 2004), written by writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]]. Although she uses the word "nurse" as part of her codename, she has since become a medical doctor.{{cn|date=December 2015}}

==Publication history==
''Night Nurse'' was a Marvel Comics title that lasted 4 issues cover-dated November 1972 to May 1973. The [[medical drama]] / [[romance comics|romance]] series focused on the adventures of three female roommates who worked the night shift at the fictional Metropolitan General Hospital in [[New York City]]: Linda Carter, Georgia Jenkins, and Christine Palmer.<ref>[http://www.toonopedia.com/nightnrs.htm Night Nurse] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]], [http://www.webcitation.org/66tWAUyPa Archived] from the original on April 13, 2012.</ref>

''Night Nurse'' was introduced in one of a trio of Marvel Comics aimed at a female audience, alongside ''[[Tigra|Claws of the Cat]]'' and ''[[Shanna the She-Devil]]''. Marvel writer-editor [[Roy Thomas]] recalled in 2007 that editor-in-chief [[Stan Lee]] "had the idea, and I think the names, for all three. He wanted to do some books that would have special appeal to girls. We were always looking for way to expand our franchise. My idea...was to try to get women to write them".<ref>''Alter Ego'' #70 (July 1970): Roy Thomas interview, pp. 49-50</ref>

The series was written by Jean Thomas, who was at the time married to Roy Thomas, and drawn by [[Win Mortimer|Winslow Mortimer]]. The stories, unlike most of Marvel's offerings at the time, contain no superheroes or fantastic elements. However, the night nurses encounter "danger, drama and death", as the cover tag proclaims, as they work to foil bomb plots, malpracticing surgeons, and mob hitmen. ''Night Nurse'', like the "relevant comics" of the early 1970s,{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} also attempted to address real-world social issues; ''Night Nurse'' #1 features a character asking why his poor neighborhood is the one always experiencing power outages. "Why not [[Park Avenue (Manhattan)|Park Avenue]] for a change?".

''Night Nurse'' #4 is the only issue of the series that takes place away from Metro General and New York City. This story shifts away from the urban drama of the first three issues and instead features Christine embroiled in a [[gothic fiction|gothic]] adventure, complete with a foreboding mansion, dusty secret passageways, and mysterious lights.

While nothing depicted in ''Night Nurse'' connected it to the mainstream [[Marvel Universe]], Christine Palmer reappeared in ''[[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]'' vol. 3, #1 (Sept. 2004 – 31 years after her last appearance, in ''Night Nurse'' #4). [[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa]], the writer of ''Nightcrawler'', said in an interview that he was "a huge fan" of ''Night Nurse'', and wanted to bring back the character when he realized that his first ''Nightcrawler'' story would take place in a hospital.<ref name="nc">{{cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=5445 | title=The Winding Way Back: Sacasa Talks "Nightcrawler" | author=Dave Richards | publisher=Comic Book Resources| accessdate=2006-09-01}}</ref> Linda Carter also reappeared in 2004, this time sporting Night Nurse as an actual codename.

Prior to ''Night Nurse'', the series ''Linda Carter, Student Nurse'' was published by [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], a precursor to Marvel Comics.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.netwrx1.com/CherryAmes/lindacarter.html | title=The Cherry Ames Page: Linda Carter, Student Nurse | accessdate=2006-09-02}}</ref> It ran nine issues, cover-dated September 1961 to January 1963.<ref>[http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/nurse.htm#S1752 The Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators: ''Linda Carter, Student Nurse'' (1961-1963)]</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
While the three roommates initially bicker amongst themselves, they soon bond over their shared loneliness, and become best friends. Originally, none of the three nurses then used "night nurse" as a label, though the "Next Issue" box in ''Night Nurse #1'' promises, "More true-to-life adventures of Linda Carter, Night Nurse!"

===Linda Carter===
'''Linda Carter''' is the daughter of a [[Physician|doctor]] in [[Allentown, Buffalo, New York|Allentown, New York]]. After moving to New York City and moving in with roommates Christine Palmer and Georgia Jenkins, she meets and falls in love with Marshall Michaels, a wealthy businessman. When he forces her to choose between marrying him or staying at Metro General as a nurse, she chooses her career.<ref name="Night Nurse #1">''Night Nurse'' #1</ref> In the following two issues of the series, Linda demonstrates that her skills are not limited to nursing practice, as she performs detective work to help expose an incompetent surgeon and prevents a hitman from murdering a patient. By the time the series was canceled, she had started a budding romance with Dr. Jack Tryon, a young resident doctor. Palmer is the protagonist of ''Night Nurse'' #4, with Carter making a one-panel cameo and Jenkins not appearing at all.

Some after the conclusion of the series, Carter is rescued by a superhero and afterward begins to pay the superhuman community back by ministering to heroes' health, often [[pro bono]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #656 (2011)</ref> When she first reappeared, she took care of a seriously injured [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] following his defeat by the [[Yakuza]]. Later, she took care of a badly injured [[Luke Cage]]. During this time, the Night Nurse became known for her catch phrase, "Go to the room on the right". During the superhero "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]" over government registration, the Night Nurse took [[Captain America|Captain America's]] side against the registration act, and joined his resistance group. Though she was hard to recognize in ''Civil War'' #2 (Aug. 2006), editor [[Tom Brevoort]] stated that it was her welcoming the superhero team the [[Young Avengers]] at the new headquarters.<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/marvelnew/CivilWar/WarRoom/02/CivilWarRoom2.html "Hellion for Hire #2: A Tale of Two Cities"], Newsarama.com<!-- Bot generated title -->] (dead link)</ref>

Carter teamed with [[Doctor Strange]] in the five-issue [[miniseries]] ''Doctor Strange: The Oath'' (Dec. 2006 - April 2007),<ref>Richards, Dave. [http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=7858 "Strange Medicine: Vaughan Talks 'Dr. Strange: The Oath'"], ComicBookResources.com, August 14, 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/drstran.htm#S6538 The Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators: ''Doctor Strange: The Oath'' (2006-2007)]</ref> By the end, Carter and Strange entered into a relationship, which later ended.<ref>''[[The New Avengers (comics)|The New Avengers]]'' #57 (Nov. 2009)</ref>

Carter is severely wounded after being abducted and tortured by the shapeshifting alien [[Skrulls]] during the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull Invasion]]. After a subsequent imprisonment by the newly formed [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]], she forms a bond with the ninja assassin [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]].<ref>''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign: Elektra]]'' #1-5</ref>
===Georgia Jenkins===
'''Georgia Jenkins''' is an [[African-American]] nurse who comes from an [[inner city]] neighborhood, blocks away from Metro General Hospital. On her days off from work, she provides free medical care to the people on her old block. She discovers that her older brother Ben was conned into nearly blowing up the hospital generator.<ref name="Night Nurse #1"/> Even though Ben has a change of heart and is shot while trying to protect the nurses, Georgia finds out in issue #3 that Ben has been sentenced to 10-to-20 years in prison. She angrily compares the harshness of his sentence with the fact that powerful mob criminals walk around free.

===Christine Palmer===
'''Christine Palmer''' leaves her home in "an exclusive Midwestern suburb" against her father's wishes, intending to "make a new life without her father's money".<ref name="Night Nurse #1"/> In issue #2, her father comes to New York to try to convince her to return to her life as a debutante, threatening "if you don't come home by Thanksgiving, then don't come home at all!" Though she considers his offer, she elects to stay in New York and becomes a surgical nurse for Dr. William Sutton. When Dr. Sutton's career ends in disaster, she leaves New York City and her friends behind, and travels the country, finding a job as a private nurse for a paraplegic at a spooky mansion. However, this particular position is short-lived. Palmer ended up returning to Metropolitan General Hospital, where she first encountered [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] and [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] of the [[X-Men]]. It is revealed in the ''Nightcrawler'' series that her mother lives in [[Tucson, Arizona]].
