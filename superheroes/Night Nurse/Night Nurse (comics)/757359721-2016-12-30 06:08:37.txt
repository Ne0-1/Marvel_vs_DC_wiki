'''''Night Nurse''''' is the name of a [[Marvel Comics]] [[comic book]] series published in the early 1970s, as well as the [[alter ego]] later taken on by one of its characters, Linda Carter. Carter was one of three central characters, created by writer Jean Thomas, who [[first appeared]] in ''Night Nurse'' #1 ([[cover-date]]d November 1972), though she was previously the lead of another Marvel series published in 1961. Carter later adopted the name "Night Nurse" for herself, and in this incarnation first appeared in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' vol. 2, #58 (May 2004), written by [[Brian Michael Bendis]], as a medical professional specializing in helping injured [[superhero]]es.

==Publication history==
''Night Nurse'' was a Marvel Comics title that lasted four issues (cover-dated November 1972 to May 1973). The [[medical drama]] / [[romance comics|romance]] series focused on the adventures of three female roommates who worked the night shift at the fictional Metropolitan General Hospital in [[New York City]]: Linda Carter, Georgia Jenkins, and Christine Palmer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/nightnrs.htm |title=Night Nurse |publisher=[[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]] |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/66tWAUyPa |archivedate=April 13, 2012 |accessdate=July 20, 2016 |deadurl=no}}</ref>

''Night Nurse'' was one of a trio of Marvel Comics of the time that were aimed at a female audience, alongside ''[[Tigra|Claws of the Cat]]'' and ''[[Shanna the She-Devil]]''. Marvel writer-editor [[Roy Thomas]] recalled in 2007 that editor-in-chief [[Stan Lee]] "had the idea, and I think the names, for all three. He wanted to do some books that would have special appeal to girls. We were always looking for way to expand our franchise. My idea...was to try to get women to write them".<ref>''Alter Ego'' #70 (July 1970): Roy Thomas interview, pp. 49-50</ref>

The series was written by Jean Thomas, who was at the time married to Roy Thomas, and drawn by [[Win Mortimer|Winslow Mortimer]]. The stories, unlike most of Marvel's offerings at the time, contain no superheroes or fantastic elements. However, the night nurses encounter "danger, drama and death", as the cover tag proclaims, as they work to foil bomb plots, expose incompetent surgeons, and confront mob hitmen. ''Night Nurse'', like the "relevant comics" of the early 1970s,{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} also attempted to address real-world social issues; ''Night Nurse'' #1 features a character asking why his poor neighborhood is the one always experiencing power outages. "Why not [[Park Avenue (Manhattan)|Park Avenue]] for a change?"

''Night Nurse'' #4 is the only issue of the series that takes place away from Metro General and New York City. This story shifts from the urban drama of the first three issues and instead features Christine embroiled in a [[gothic fiction|gothic]] adventure, complete with a foreboding mansion, dusty secret passageways, and mysterious lights. Issue #4 was also the last of the series. In a 2010 interview, Jean Thomas offered her theory on the series's early cancellation: "''Night Nurse'' was an attempt to create a comics book for the same audience of young girls who read such book series as ''[[Cherry Ames]]'', ''[[Sue Barton]]'', and ''[[Nancy Drew]]''. Maybe the comic-book format just didn't appeal to that group. It may also have been difficult to distribute or display: too serious to be with [[romance comics]] but not male-action oriented enough to be with [[superhero comics]], so, regrettably, low sales led to cancellation."<ref>{{cite journal|last= Weiss|first= Brett|date= October 2010|title= Spidey Super Stories|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 44| page= 25|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>

While nothing depicted in ''Night Nurse'' connected it to the mainstream [[Marvel Universe]], Christine Palmer reappeared 31 years later in ''[[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]'' vol. 3, #1 (September 2004). [[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa]], the writer of ''Nightcrawler'', said he was "a huge fan" of ''Night Nurse'', and wanted to bring back the character when he realized that his first ''Nightcrawler'' story would take place in a hospital.<ref name="nc">{{cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=5445 | title=The Winding Way Back: Sacasa Talks "Nightcrawler" | first=Dave |last=Richards | publisher=Comic Book Resources| accessdate=2006-09-01}}</ref> Linda Carter also reappeared in 2004, this time sporting Night Nurse as an actual codename. {{cn|date=April 2016}}

Prior to ''Night Nurse'', the series ''Linda Carter, Student Nurse'' was published by [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], a precursor to Marvel Comics.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.netwrx1.com/CherryAmes/lindacarter.html | title=The Cherry Ames Page: Linda Carter, Student Nurse | accessdate=2006-09-02}}</ref> It ran nine issues, cover-dated September 1961 to January 1963.<ref>[http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/nurse.htm#S1752 The Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators: ''Linda Carter, Student Nurse'' (1961-1963)]</ref>

==Characters==
While the three roommates initially bicker amongst themselves, they soon bond over their shared loneliness, and become best friends. Originally, none of the three nurses then used "night nurse" as a label, though the "Next Issue" box in ''Night Nurse #1'' promises, "More true-to-life adventures of Linda Carter, Night Nurse!"

===Linda Carter===
'''Linda Carter''' is the daughter of a [[Physician|doctor]] in [[Allentown, Buffalo, New York|Allentown, New York]]. After moving to New York City and moving in with roommates Christine Palmer and Georgia Jenkins, she meets and falls in love with Marshall Michaels, a wealthy businessman. When he forces her to choose between marrying him or staying at Metro General as a nurse, she chooses her career.<ref name="Night Nurse #1">''Night Nurse'' #1</ref> In the following two issues of the series, Linda demonstrates that her skills are not limited to nursing practice, as she performs detective work to help expose an incompetent surgeon and prevents a hitman from murdering a patient. By the time the series was canceled, she had started a budding romance with Dr. Jack Tryon, a young resident doctor. Palmer is the protagonist of ''Night Nurse'' #4, with Carter making a one-panel cameo and Jenkins not appearing at all.

Carter reappears in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' vol. 2, #58 (May 2004), takes care of the seriously injured hero following his defeat by the [[Yakuza]].<ref>{{cite comic |title=[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]] |volume=2 |issue=58 |date=May 2004}}</ref><ref name="Bustle">{{cite web |url=http://www.bustle.com/articles/75092-daredevil-nurse-claire-temple-is-from-the-comics-but-shes-not-from-the-matt-murdoch-chronicles |title=''Daredevil'' Nurse Claire Temple Is From The Comics, But She's Not From The Matt Murdoch Chronicles |work=[[Bustle (magazine)|Bustle]] |first=Jefferson |last=Grubbs |date=April 10, 2014 |accessdate=January 11, 2016}}</ref><ref name="DeKnight">{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/29/daredevil-showrunner-on-the-one-thing-marvel-made-him-change-due-to-movie-plans |title=''Daredevil'' Showrunner On The One Thing Marvel Made Him Change Due To Movie Plans |last=Goldman |first=Eric |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=July 29, 2015 |accessdate=July 29, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151211053321/http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/29/daredevil-showrunner-on-the-one-thing-marvel-made-him-change-due-to-movie-plans |archivedate=December 11, 2015 |deadurl=no}}</ref> Having been rescued by a superhero and wanting to pay the superhuman community back by ministering to heroes' health, often [[pro bono]], she becomes a character that superheroes—including [[Luke Cage]] and [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]]—seek out for off the record medical care.<ref name="Bustle"/><ref name="DeKnight"/><ref>{{cite comic |title=[[The Pulse (comics)|The Pulse]] |volume=1 |issue=9 |date=July 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic |title=[[Doctor Strange: The Oath]] |volume=1 |issue=1 |date=December 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic |title=[[The Amazing Spider-Man]] |volume=1 |issue=656 |date=March 2011}}</ref> During the superhero "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]" over government registration, the Night Nurse takes [[Captain America]]'s side against the registration act, and joins his resistance group.

===Georgia Jenkins===

She discovers that her older brother Ben was conned into nearly blowing up the hospital generator.<ref name="Night Nurse #1"/> Even though Ben has a change of heart and is shot while trying to protect the nurses, Georgia finds out in issue #3 that Ben has been sentenced to 10-to-20 years in prison.

When Dr. Sutton's career ends in disaster, she leaves New York City and her friends behind, and travels the country, finding a job as a private nurse for a paraplegic at a spooky mansion.
