'''Night Nurse''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[comic book]] series published in the early 1970s, as well as the [[alter ego]] later taken on by one of its characters, Linda Carter. Carter was one of three central characters who [[first appeared]] in ''Night Nurse'' #1 ([[cover-date]]d Nov. 1972), though she was previously the lead of another Marvel series, ''Linda Carter, Student Nurse'', published in 1961. Carter later adopted the name "Night Nurse" for herself, and in this incarnation, first appeared in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #58 (May 2004), as a medical professional specializing in helping injured [[superhero]]es.

==Publication history==
''Night Nurse'' was a Marvel Comics title that lasted four issues (cover-dated Nov. 1972  – May 1973). The [[medical drama]] / [[romance comics|romance]] series focused on the adventures of three female roommates who worked the night shift at the fictional Metropolitan General Hospital in [[New York City]]: Linda Carter, Georgia Jenkins, and Christine Palmer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/nightnrs.htm |title=Night Nurse |publisher=[[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66tWAUyPa |archivedate=April 13, 2012 |accessdate=July 20, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>

''Night Nurse'' was one of a trio of Marvel Comics of the time that were aimed at a female audience, alongside ''[[Tigra|Claws of the Cat]]'' and ''[[Shanna the She-Devil]]''. Marvel writer-editor [[Roy Thomas]] recalled in 2007 that editor-in-chief [[Stan Lee]] "had the idea, and I think the names, for all three. He wanted to do some books that would have special appeal to girls. We were always looking for way to expand our franchise. My idea...was to try to get women to write them".<ref>''Alter Ego'' #70 (July 2007): Roy Thomas interview, pp. 49-50</ref>

The series was written by writer Jean Thomas, who was at the time married to Roy Thomas, and by artist [[Win Mortimer|Winslow Mortimer]].<ref name=gcd>[https://www.comics.org/issue/111440/ ''Night Nurse'' (Marvel, 1972 series)] at the [[Grand Comics Database]].</ref> The stories, unlike most of Marvel's offerings at the time, contain no superheroes or fantastic elements. However, the night nurses encounter "danger, drama and death", as the cover tag proclaims, as they work to foil bomb plots, expose incompetent surgeons, and confront mob hitmen.

''Night Nurse'' #4 is the only issue of the series that takes place away from Metro General and New York City. This story shifts from the urban drama of the first three issues and instead features Christine embroiled in a [[gothic fiction|gothic]] adventure, complete with a foreboding mansion, dusty secret passageways, and mysterious lights. Issue #4 was also the last of the series. In a 2010 interview, Jean Thomas offered her theory on the series's early cancellation: <blockquote>"''Night Nurse'' was an attempt to create a comics book for the same audience of young girls who read such book series as ''[[Cherry Ames]]'', ''[[Sue Barton]]'', and ''[[Nancy Drew]]''. Maybe the comic-book format just didn't appeal to that group. It may also have been difficult to distribute or display: too serious to be with [[romance comics]] but not male-action oriented enough to be with [[superhero comics]], so, regrettably, low sales led to cancellation."<ref>{{cite journal|last= Weiss|first= Brett|date= October 2010|title= Spidey Super Stories|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 44| page= 25|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref></blockquote>

Linda Carter reappeared as a medical professional specializing in helping injured [[superhero]]es in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' vol. 2, #58 (May 2004), written by [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and drawn by [[Alex Maleev]]. Matt Murdock / Daredevil refers to her then as "the night nurse ... [who is] sympathetic to ... costumed persons who get a little nicked up in ... the call of duty."<ref>{{cite journal| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=HjW8DgAAQBAJ&pg=PA35&lpg=PA35&dq=night+nurse+daredevil+%2358&source=bl&ots=TWSWOFEYgw&sig=ENwEZ38fARSEYhW5ZCDTwjAUtLE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiWidmVzbbUAhWCTSYKHREmAPc4ChDoAQgzMAM#v=onepage&q=night%20nurse%20daredevil%20%2358&f=false| title=Enter the World of Danger, Drama and Death ...

''Night Nurse'' co-star Christine Palmer reappeared in ''[[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]'' vol. 3, #1 (Sept. 2004). [[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa]], the writer of ''Nightcrawler'', said he was "a huge fan" of ''Night Nurse'', and wanted to bring back the character when he realized that his first ''Nightcrawler'' story would take place in a hospital.<ref name="nc">{{cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=5445 | title=The Winding Way Back: Sacasa Talks "Nightcrawler" | first=Dave |last=Richards | publisher=Comic Book Resources| accessdate=2006-09-01}}</ref>

A [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot issue]], ''Night Nurse'' vol. 2 (July 2015), reprinted the 1970s series' four issues as well as ''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #80 (Feb. 2006).<ref>[https://www.comics.org/series/89266/ ''Night Nurse'' (Marvel, 2015 series)] at the Grand Comics Database.</ref>

Prior to ''Night Nurse'', writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Al Hartley]] created the series ''Linda Carter, Student Nurse'' for [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], Marvel's 1950s precursor.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.netwrx1.com/CherryAmes/lindacarter.html | title=The Cherry Ames Page: Linda Carter, Student Nurse | accessdate=2006-09-02}}</ref> It ran nine issues (Sept. 1961 – Jan. 1963).<ref>[https://www.comics.org/series/1483/ ''Linda Carter, Student Nurse''] at the Grand Comics Database.</ref>

==Characters==
While the three roommates initially bicker amongst themselves, they soon bond over their shared loneliness, and become best friends. Originally, none of the three nurses then used "night nurse" as a label, though the "Next Issue" box in ''Night Nurse #1'' promises, "More true-to-life adventures of Linda Carter, Night Nurse!"
