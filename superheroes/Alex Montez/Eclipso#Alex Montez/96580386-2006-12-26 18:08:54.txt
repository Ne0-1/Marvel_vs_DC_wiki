'''Eclipso''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[villain]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|Universe]].  He is portrayed as having been the incarnation of the Wrath of [[God]], the Angel of Vengeance who turned evil and was replaced by the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]].  He first appeared in ''[[House of Secrets]]'' #61 (Aug. 1963), and was created by [[Bob Haney]] and [[Lee Elias]].

==Publication history==
Originally, Eclipso was written as a generic villain with average superpowers, who would routinely enact an elaborate plot to fulfill his desires: money, power, etc.  However, the ''[[Eclipso: The Darkness Within|Darkness Within]]'' mini-series established that Eclipso is an extremely evil and power-hungry entity.  It has been shown repeatedly that Eclipso desires the kind of power he enjoyed while he served as a spirit of divine vengeance.  He would always seek to possess beings of incredible power like [[Superman]], [[Lar Gand]], and [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] to achieve his ends.  On several occasions, he would endanger, hurt, or even kill to achieve his goals with absolutely no remorse or hesitation.  Eclipso himself is a being of spite, cruelty and hate who shows nothing but disdain for all other creatures.  One of the most disturbing displays of just how evil Eclipso is was when he took control of Superman during the ''Lightning Strikes Twice'' arc.  While possessing Superman, Eclipso said things to Captain Marvel like, "I'll fill the Grand Canyon with corpses!", "I'll fly to the heart of Metropolis and make a nuclear bomb seem merciful!", as well as "I'll slaughter children and wear the skins of their fathers on my back!".  During the conflict, an Eclipso-possessed Superman threw an entire cruise ship (Captain Marvel managed to save the ship of people) in order to force Captain Marvel to surrender his body for possession.  Ultimately, the wizard [[Shazam]] managed to summon the Spectre to banish Eclipso back to his black diamond where it later came into possession of Jean Loring.

==Bruce Gordon==
Eclipso's early comics debut is tied to his first modern host, Bruce Gordon, a scientist specializing in solar energy.  While in the jungle in order to view a solar eclipse, Bruce was attacked by a tribal sorcerer named Mophir.  Before plunging to his death off of a cliff, Mophir managed to wound Bruce with a black diamond.  After this, Bruce would find himself transformed into the villanous Eclipso whenever he was in the presence of an eclipse.  An off-color (blue-grey or purple) circle would appear covering the rightmost two-thirds of his face, reminiscent of a partial eclipse.  From this point on, Bruce would go through many [[Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde|Jekyll-and-Hyde]]-style misadventures in ''[[House of Secrets]]''.  During this period, Eclipso was portrayed as a more conventional villain, possessing super-strength, partial invulnerability and eye blasts (aided by his black diamond).  Eventually, it would be found that Eclipso could be summoned by any type of eclipse: lunar, solar, or any other object blocking out a light source.  This was countered by the relatively easy way of banishing Eclipso; any bright flash of light would turn him back into Bruce Gordon.

===''The Darkness Within''===
{{main|Eclipso: The Darkness Within}}
[[Image:WWAnnual3.jpg|thumb|left|120px|[[Wonder Woman]] possessed by Eclipso.]]
In the early 1990s, DC revamped Eclipso in a company [[fictional crossover|crossover]] built around the [[miniseries]] ''Eclipso: The Darkness Within.''  Here it was [[retcon|retconned]] that Eclipso was not simply Bruce Gordon's dark half, but a vengeance demon who had possessed Gordon.  It also revealed that there was more than one black diamond like the one that allowed Eclipso to take possession of Bruce Gordon.  There were in fact 1,000 black diamonds that had been passed back and forth among people around the world without even knowing what they were.  Originally, Eclipso's soul had been bound inside a giant black gemstone called the 'Heart of Darkness' in deepest Africa, until a treasure-hunter found it, brought it to London and had it cut into one-thousand duplicate diamonds in the late 19th century.  This weakened the binding spell enough to allow Eclipso to possess anyone who became angry while holding one of the diamonds.

What's more, the established rules that had bound Eclipso were revealed to be a ruse.  He wasn't limited to possessing Gordon during an eclipse, he could possess anyone who became angry while they were holding one of his diamonds, provided it was under the cover of darkness.  He had pretended he could only take possession during an eclipse so that Bruce would not know the truth about the black diamond being triggered by anger.  He could also possess multiple people and control them simultaneously.  He could possess a person through a diamond and then pass it to someone else and possess them too.  Eclipso also had the ability to "evoke" shadow-beings rather than possess a person.  This happened when the person holding the diamond triggered it with anger, but that person remained passive, a shadow-being would leap forth from them, leaving the host in control of themself and Eclipso in control of the shadow-being.

When [[Lar Gand]], passing through space, discovered Eclipso's palace on the moon and wandered inside, Eclipso claimed it "gave him a new idea" about possessing all of Earth's heroes and using them towards his ultimate goal which was ostensibly the takeover of Earth and/or revenge against God for banishing him inside the Heart of Darkness.  Why Eclipso hadn't thought of this approach before was not answered; he merely claimed he had spent the last several years "posing as a B-level villain" in order to remain undetected by Earth's heroes and had limited himself to targeting Gordon for the purpose of quashing Gordon's research into solar science.  If Gordon had achieved his goal of making solar energy the planet's primary energy source, Eclipso would find it a very inhospitable place to live, as any solar-powered device could be used as a weapon against him.

The climax of the story saw several of Earth's heroes possessed by Eclipso and transported to the moon during an eclipse, another of his new abilities.  He then absorbed these heroes into his own body, gaining their mass and also their inherent powers.  Gordon led a group of heroes armed with solar weapons to the moon in an attempt to defeat Eclipso once and for all.  The absorbed heroes were freed in the end, but only after [[Starman (comics)|Starman]] Will Payton destroyed Eclipso's moon base by detonating his own solar-powered body, seemingly killing Payton.  Eclipso's diamonds still remained on Earth.

===''Eclipso'' series===
Following this successful miniseries, Eclipso received a solo series where he conquered the South American nation Parador.  Bruce Gordon tried leading a counterattack with a group of heroes dubbed [[Shadow Fighters (comics)|Shadow Fighters]], but in issue #13 of the series, Eclipso defeated them conclusively, killing [[Yolanda Montez|Wildcat II]] (Yolanda Montez), [[Doctor Mid-Nite#Beth Chapel|Dr. Midnight]], the [[Creeper (comics)|Creeper]], [[Commander Steel]], [[Manhunter (comics)#Mark Shaw|Manhunter IV]] (a Mark Shaw ringer), and [[Major Victory]]. (Manhunter and the Creeper have since returned to action.)

The [[Peacemaker (comics)|Peacemaker]] was also involved in this action, but died when he crashed the helicopter he was flying, in order to destroy some Eclipso-controlled tanks.  These tanks were attacking the sole surviving member of the Shadow Fighters, [[Nemesis (DC Comics)|Nemesis]].

This series did answer one nagging question created by the ''Darkness Within'' retcon.  If Eclipso sought to destroy Bruce Gordon's work in the solar energy field, and he didn't need Gordon as a host, why not just kill him? This led to the revelation that Bruce Gordon and his longtime girlfriend Mona Bennett would one day give birth to a child who would, as an adult, travel back in time and become the mysterious treasure-hunter who freed Eclipso from the Heart of Darkness in the 19th century.  Eclipso dared not kill Gordon or Bennett before they birthed this child, lest he create a paradox or at least alter the events which led to his freedom.

Eclipso's threat was finally removed from the Earth when the [[Phantom Stranger]] completed the long task of gathering all 1,000 black diamonds from around the Earth and fusing them back together into the Heart of Darkness by recreating the spell originally cast by God, trapping Eclipso's soul inside the giant gemstone.

Later in the '90s, the series ''[[Spectre (comics)|The Spectre]]'' gave key revelations about Eclipso.  The Spectre was not the first embodiment of the wrath of God, but was Eclipso's replacement.  Series writer [[John Ostrander]] chose to portray this as a distinction between the Spectre's pursuit of ''vengeance'' and Eclipso's pursuit of ''revenge''.  In a historical context, Eclipso was responsible for the [[Biblical Flood]], while the Spectre was the [[Death (personification)#Death .28angels.29 in religion|Angel of Death]] who slew the first-born Egyptian children.

The Spectre put the final nail in Eclipso's coffin by taking the Heart of Darkness from Earth, along with the remains of Eclipso's palace on the moon, burning them to ash with the holy power of God, and casting the ashes into space.

==Alex Montez==
Eclipso returned after several years' absence in the "Princes of Darkness" storyline in ''[[Justice Society of America|JSA]]'' as an ally of the other shadow-based villains [[Mordru]] and [[Obsidian (comics)|Obsidian]].  Alexander Montez, cousin of Yolanda, had vowed revenge on Eclipso for Yolanda's death.  To this end, he had gathered the 1,000 black diamonds, liquified them, and injected them into himself; all save one, which he kept to evoke Eclipso.  Exactly how Eclipso's diamonds had returned was unknown.  Alex had covered his body in tribal tattoos he claimed he had learned about on Diablo Island.  With these tattoos, Montez could summon all the powers of Eclipso by triggering the diamond with his anger, while remaining in control of himself and keeping Eclipso trapped within.  As the new Eclipso, he joined the short-lived team of loose-cannon heroes assembled by [[Black Adam]], which was the subject of the subsequent storyline "Black Reign".

During Adam's reign in [[Kahndaq]], Alex became romantically involved with his teammate [[Nemesis (DC Comics)|Nemesis]].  However, during a battle, one of Alex's binding glyphs (which kept Eclipso in control) was broken when his shoulder was cut, freeing Eclipso, who asserted himself by killing Nemesis.  Alex then committed suicide to prevent Eclipso from controlling him further.  This story was significant as it meant that Eclipso no longer had a limitless number of black diamonds waiting out in the world for him to utilize.

===''Lightning Strikes Twice''===
Despite the loss of the other black diamonds, the disembodied Eclipso then tried to possess Superman by antagonizing him through many deaths.  He eventually possessed Superman by upsetting him via his possession of [[Lois Lane]].  At this point, the wizard Shazam stepped in by sending Captain Marvel to fight the possessed Eclipso-Superman.  Thanks to Superman's weakness to magic, Captain Marvel was able to do a significant amount of damage to Eclipso; a prominent method of attack was to continuously trigger his transformations in close proximity to Superman, resulting in the lightning striking Eclipso.

Eventually, Shazam himself was forced to step in and removed Eclipso from Superman by calling upon the hostless Spectre himself to do it.  The Spectre forces Eclipso back into a lone black diamond.  The Spectre then warns Shazam that he's made an enemy of Eclipso and that the Spectre will no longer defend him.  At the end of this series, the black diamond is seen appearing in [[Jean Loring]]'s cell in [[Arkham Asylum]].

==Jean Loring==
{{main|Day of Vengeance}}
In the ''[[Day of Vengeance]]'' miniseries, which tied into the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' event, Jean Loring, ex-wife of [[Ray Palmer (comics)|Atom]] (Ray Palmer) and murderer of [[Sue Dibny]] as seen in the ''[[Identity Crisis (comics)|Identity Crisis]]'' miniseries, discovered the last black diamond in her prison cell, became the new Eclipso and tricks the Spectre into attacking magic-based heroes as her revenge against Shazam, who was eventually slain while fighting the Spectre.  After fending off multiple attacks upon herself, Eclipso-Loring was eventually teleported to a non-decaying [[orbit]] around the sun by [[Nightshade (comics)|Nightshade]].

In the pages of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', it was revealed by [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]] that he had sent [[Superboy-Prime]] to recover the black diamond, and that the [[Psycho-Pirate]] delivered it to Loring on Alex's orders and manipulated Eclipso into manipulating the Spectre.  This was all done in the interests of breaking magic down into raw magical energy, which Alexander could use for his own ends.  The death of Shazam was particularly useful, as his various champions than became a tether of power; all Alexander had to do was capture one of them, make them say 'Shazam', and they would summon their lightning bolt to power his machine.

{{Spoiler}}
In Week Twenty-Seven of ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', [[Elongated Man|Ralph Dibny]], on a quest to restore his wife Sue to life and guided by the helmet of [[Doctor Fate]], approaches the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] and promises to fulfil any bargain that the Spectre demands in order to restore his wife to life. 

The Spectre, desiring revenge on Eclipso for her manipulations of him during the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' but rendered incapable of taking it owing to his present lack of a host, orders Dibny to punish Eclipso in return for his wife's life; Dibny, realizing that this meant punishing [[Jean Loring]], his wife's murderer, and temporarily granted the power of the Spectre, takes Eclipso back to the point at which she (as Jean Loring) murdered his wife and, restoring Jean's sanity, ruthlessly intends to trap her in a permanent time loop and force her to watch herself murder Sue Dibny over and over for all eternity. 

Her sanity restored and Eclipso purged out of her, a terrified Loring tearfully begs for forgiveness, screaming that she 'was crazy' when she murdered Sue and that it 'wasn't me!'.  Dibny, affected by her pleas, his sense of compassion and his own feelings on watching his wife's death, finds himself incapable of such ruthlessness and refuses to complete his pact with the Spectre, returning Eclipso to her orbit around the sun.

==Other media==
*Eclipso has also appeared in a ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' episode called 'Eclipsed'.  Although never referred to by name, Eclipso was characterized as the collective souls of an evil race of snake people who imprisoned themselves in a black diamond to eventually destroy the human race.  One of Eclipso's possessed human hosts appears wearing the original Eclipso costume, having been told the best way to lure out the Justice League is to "put on a gaudy costume and threaten to hurt a lot of people". 
*This Eclipso attempted to permanently darken the sun, and possessed all of the Justice League but the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] and [[Batman]].  However, the Flash was able to drive the spirits out of his teammates - Batman was away at the time - and subsequntly helped them create a wormhole to drain away the black energy 'Eclipso' was using to darken the sun.
*Eclipso also appeared in the video game ''[[Justice League: Chronicles]]'', which, though based on the animated series, shown him closer to his comic version.  The game was released around the same time that "Eclipsed" aired, so it is likely that the game's makers were unaware of Eclipso's portrayal in the show while the game was in production.
