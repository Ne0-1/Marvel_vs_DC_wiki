'''Eclipso''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[villain]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|Universe]]. In the comics, Eclipso was the original God of Vengeance who turned evil after being replaced by [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]].  On TV, Eclipso is an evil god of revenge imprisoned by a barbaric primitive race of reptilians in a [[Black Diamond]]. 

==Eclipso in the beginning==
Eclipso's early comics debut is tied to another character, Bruce Gordon, a scientist specializing in solar energy.  While in the jungle in order to view a solar eclipse, Bruce was attacked by a tribal sorceror named Mophir.  Before plunging to his death off of a cliff, Mophir managed to wound Bruce with a black diamond.  After this, Bruce would find himself transformed into the villanous Eclipso whenever he was in the presence of an eclipse.  An off-color (blue-grey or purple) circle would appear covering the rightmost two-thirds of his face, reminiscent of a partial eclipse.  From this point on, Bruce would go through many [[Doctor_Jekyll_and_Mister_Hyde|Jekyll-and-Hyde]]-style misadventures in the pages of [[House of Mystery]].  During this period, Eclipso was portrayed as a more conventional villain, possessing super-strength, partial invulnerability and eye blasts (aided by his black diamond).  Eventually it would be found that Eclipso could be summoned by any type of eclipse: lunar, solar, or any other object blocking out a light source.  This was countered by the relatively easy way of banishing Eclipso; any bright flash of light would turn him back into Bruce Gordon.

==The Darkness Within==
In the early 1990s, DC decided to revamp Eclipso in a large crossover titled ''Eclipso: The Darkness Within.''  In this story, it was [[retcon|retconned]] that Eclipso wasn't just Bruce Gordon's dark half, but that he really was a vengance demon who had possessed Gordon.  Furthermore, there were thousands of black diamonds around the world, through which Eclipso could possess others by playing upon their darkest emotions.  It was further established that Eclipso was an extremely cruel and vindictive being, who had only been pretending to be a B-list villian in order to avoid detection by heroes.  In this story, Eclipso became weary of his [[modus operandi]] and decided to launch and all-out offense by using his myriad of black diamonds to possess heroes and villians directly or to manipulate them by possessing their loved ones.  During this conflict, Eclipso possessed even Batman and Superman (albeit two separate occasions and for a short time each).  Eventually the story led up to a massive confrontation at Eclipso's hideout on the moon, where despite the cast of many superpowers, Bruce Gordon played a key role in Eclipso's defeat.

==His own series==
After the success of the miniseries, Eclipso received his own series, where he conquered a South American nation.  Bruce Gordon tried leading a counterattack with group of heroes, but Eclipso slaughtered the group, including the second [[Wildcat (comics)|Wildcat]], the second Dr Mid-Nite, the Creeper and others.

==More revelations==
Later in the 90's [[Spectre (comics)|the Spectre's]] series made some key revelations about the history of Eclipso.  The Spectre was not the first embodiment of the wrath of God, but was the replacement for Eclipso.  The series writer [[John Ostrander]] chose to portray this as a distinction between the Spectre's pursuit of vengeance and Eclipso's pursuit of revenge. In a historical context, Eclipso was responsible for the biblical Flood, while the Spectre was the Angel of Death who slew the firstborn Egyptian children.

==Modern Eclipso==
After the end of his own series Eclipso has appeared as the villain in several storylines. He participated in the "Princes of Darkness" storyline from [[Justice Society of America]], teaming up with [[Mordru]] and [[Obsidian_(comics)|Obsidian]]. 

During "Princes...", Alexander Montez, whose cousin Yolanda ([[Wildcat (comics)|Wildcat II]]) was killed by Gordon/Eclipso, had gathered the black diamonds the world over, and with the help of witchcraft he learned from Diablo Island, contained Eclipso's entity--in effect, gaining his powers while retaining his own personality.  As the new Eclipso, he joined the short-lived team of loose-cannon heroes assembled by [[Black Adam]], which was the subject of the subsequent story-line "Black Reign".

During Adam's reign in Khandaq, Alex became romantically involved with his teammate [[Nemesis (DC Comics)]]. However, Eclipso eventually gained control of Alex, and asserted himself by killing Nemesis. Alex then committed suicide to prevent Eclipso from controlling him further.  This was significant because after this story arc, Eclipso no longer had a limitless number of black diamonds waiting out there for him to utilize.

==Lightning Strikes Twice==
Despite the loss of the other black diamonds, the disembodied Eclipso then tried to possess Superman by antagonizing him through many deaths.  He eventually possessed Superman by upsetting him via his possession of Lois Lane.  At this point the Wizard Shazam stepped in by sending Captain Marvel to fight the possessed Eclipso-Superman.  Eventually Shazam himself was forced to step in and removed Eclipso from Superman by calling upon the hostless Spectre himself to do it.  The Spectre forces Eclipso back into a lone black diamond.  The Spectre then warns Eclipso that he's made an enemy of Eclipso and that the Spectre will no longer defend him.  At the end of this series, the black diamond is seen appearing in Jean Loring's cell.

==Day of Vengeance==

In the current [[Day of Vengeance]] miniseries, which ties into the [[Infinite Crisis]], [[Jean Loring]], ex-wife of [[Atom (comics)|Atom]] (Ray Palmer) and murderer of [[Sue Dibny]] as seen in the [[Identity Crisis]] miniseries, discovers a black diamond in her prison cell, becomes the new Eclipso and tricks the Spectre into attacking magic-based heroes as her revenge against Shazam.  After fending off multiple attacks upon herself, Eclipso-Loring was eventually teleported to a non-decaying [[orbit]] around the sun by [[Nightshade (comics)|Nightshade]].

==Eclipso in other Media==
Eclipso has also appeared in a ''[[Justice League]]'' episode called 'Eclipsed'.  Although never referred to by name, Eclipso was characterized as an evil god of revenge imprisoned by a barbaric primitive race of reptilians in a Black Diamond.
