'''Morgan Stark''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] character who was the cousin and rival of [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]].

==Fictional character biography==
Growing up, Morgan Stark believed that his uncle ([[Howard Stark]]) cheated his father ('''Edward Stark''') out of the Stark company fortune. In truth, Edward asked Howard to be bought out—he didn’t want a part in the family business. Because of that, Morgan has always tried take [[Stark Industries]] from his cousin Tony.

Morgan Stark first appeared in [[Tales of Suspense]] vol. 1 # 68 (August [[1965 in comics|1965]]), a joint venture issues with [[Captain America]]. Having returned from [[Ireland]], [[Happy Hogan]] resumes work at [[Stark Industries]], and Tony Stark gets a letter from his cousin Morgan asking for help. What Tony doesn't realize is that his cousin Morgan is under the employ of [[Count Nefaria]] who is hoping to use Morgan in a plot to destroy Tony Stark, although Morgan would do it "for free". First traveling to the States to pretend to seek Tony's help, Morgan is introduced to the Stark Industries staff and shown around the building. That night as Tony is on his way to a party, he happens to spy a rocket and decides to investigate it as Iron Man. Finding there's a bomb inside, Iron Man rushed back to Stark Industries and calls a bomb squad as Tony Stark. Arriving on the scene, they find the field empty. This whole episode is part of Morgan's plan, and Morgan (hiding in the bushes) uses a visio-projector to make Stark hallucinate and think he's seeing aliens. Using the device on Tony, Morgan begins to make everyone doubt Tony's sanity, and causes Senator Hamilton Byrd (a skeptic who accused Stark deliberately of being a Communist spy) to begin demanding that Stark be stripped of his defense contracts with the US army for fear that he may become a threat to national security. Believing that he is not insane, Stark returns to the original location where he started seeing aliens as Iron Man and begins scanning the area, unaware that Morgan has followed him there as well. Just before Morgan can blast Iron Man with the visio-projector, real aliens from the planet Froma arrive to investigate Earth. They spot Iron Man and begin attacking him, and during the battle discover Morgan as well. Iron Man fights off the aliens and saves Morgan's life.

Afterwards, Morgan is forced to tell everyone that Stark is sane, and Senator Byrd retracts his demands as well. After everything is sorted out, Morgan is taken back to Europe to get punishment for failing Count Nefaria.

===Dark Reign===
During the "[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]", Morgan Stark (posing as his renegade cousin "Tony Stark") was the CEO of [[Stark Industries|Stark Solutions]] and (accidentally) converted [[Ultimo (Marvel Comics)|Ultimo]] into an "Ultimo Virus" capable of bestowing enhanced strength, speed, regeneration, and optic blast abilities to its victims. It is revealed that the virus was engineered from Ultimo himself by the Human Engineering Life Laboratories, which was acting on the commission of the Stark Solutions corporation, which itself had been contracted by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.|H.A.M.M.E.R.]] to study Ultimo's potential as a weapon. Having destroyed Ultimo's body, [[War Machine]] sets out to destroy the brain, which had been split up into three discrete units, stored at separate locations. Two of the units are destroyed by War Machine's allies, but the third is ingested (in the form of a crystalline liquid) turns out to be Morgan Stark. Stark is transformed by the liquid into a giant, humanoid robot, a quicksilver-like attempt at being Ultimo, and possessed of the Doomsday Machine's programming to destroy all life, and fights War Machine. However, the third component is destroyed when Rhodes uses Ultimo's own weapons technology - which he obtained when he destroyed the robot's body - against it. Stark then self-destructs, scattering Ultimo's liquid body all over the landscape, where it soon merges with the plant life. It was Ultimo's/Morgan's plan to convert all vegetation on Earth into metal, which would suffocate all life within two weeks. Rhodes was able to render Ultimo docile by forcing the Iron Patriot into showing his memories of his happiest moments. However, the [[Green Goblin|Iron Patriot]] then took advantage of this to take Ultimo for himself. Ultimo, having had his core programming erased, turned into a giant, floating ball of liquid metal that was essentially awaiting instructions. What happaned to Morgan is unknown while the robot to "raise" the blank slate it had become, hopefully instilling some other values into the artificial intelligence besides universal genocide then drops of Ultimo infected a nefarious group called the Bainesville Ten, which caused them to see the recordings of every person who was raped, tortured, or killed because of their orders.
