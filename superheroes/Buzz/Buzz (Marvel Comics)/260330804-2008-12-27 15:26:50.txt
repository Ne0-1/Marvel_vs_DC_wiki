'''The Buzz''' ('''Jack "JJ" Jameson''') is a [[fictional character]] in the ''[[Spider-Girl]]'' [[comic book]] series, published by [[Marvel Comics]]. JJ is the grandson of [[J. Jonah Jameson]] and the son of [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]]. His costume bears some similarites to [[Henry Pym]]'s ''Yellowjacket'' suit.

==Publication history==
First appearing in the [[MC2]] comic book series, [[Spider-Girl (comic series)|Spider-Girl]], The Buzz went on to have his own limited series.

==Fictional character biography==
Jack Jameson, or JJ as he is called by his friends, was attending a demonstration of ''Project Human Fly'' by his [[grandfather]] J. Jonah Jameson, C.E.O. of Jameson Communications (and publisher of the [[Daily Bugle]]). The goal of the project was the creation of a body armor that would grant wearer heavy metal-like superpowers. The staff of the project included Dr. Marla Jameson (Jonah's wife), [[biophysicist]] Dr. Sonja Jade and Robert Douglas, grandson of the late [[Joseph "Robbie" Robertson]]. It was on this day that JJ first met Buzz Bannon, a former [[United States Navy SEALs|Navy SEAL]] and the person chosen to use the Human Fly [[armor]]. In the following time they became close friends, almost like brothers. Then one day, as JJ and Buzz were in the gym, they got a message that Buzz should attend a meeting on the Project: Human Fly, but it was a trap.

Dr. Sonja Jade turned out to be a traitor who was holding Marla, Jonah Jameson and Buzz Bannon hostage. She was about to steal the project files and the armor itself. While her minions were going with Buzz to retrieve the armor, JJ and Richie Robertson learned of the situation and triggered the fire-alarm. Buzz used the distraction to overcome most of his adversaries, but during the fight he got a shot in the abdomen and Richie was beaten unconscious. Nevertheless, Buzz managed to knock down all the men and went for the armor, joined by JJ.

Suddenly, the Human Fly entered the scene, rescued the [[hostage]]s before they could get shot and went after the villains, Dr. Jade was able to get away due to an [[explosion]]. Later on that evening Buzz Bannon's body was discovered in the lab. JJ had donned the armor, but couldn't tell his grandfather (who in a fit a rage, accused the wearer of the Human Fly armor of killing Bannon). Although hearing this from a nearby rooftop, JJ knew that the body armor was his only chance at revenge for Buzz Bannon's death. He couldn't tell his grandfather anything about this and so kept it a secret. In memory of his friend, he decided to call himself The Buzz.

Later, JJ was joined by Richie, who knew he was The Buzz because, during the attack, he had regained consciousness and followed them to the lab, where from a distance he saw Buzz Bannon die. Richie agreed to help JJ with the armor, operating from a van equipped with a lot of [[electronics]]. They stay in contact via [[radio]] signal. With Ritchie's help, The Buzz was able to find and defeat Jade.

The Buzz soon encountered [[Spider-Girl]], and despite his good intentions, she was leery of him, since she had been reading articles in the Daily Bugle (written by Jonah Jameseon) that Buzz was a murderer (ironically, the same kind of articles he used to write about her father, [[Spider-Man]]). Buzz however was able to convince her, and even helped her form a new team of [[New Warriors]], (including [[Ladyhawk]], the [[Raptor (comics)|Raptor]], [[Darkdevil]], and [[Phil Urich]] (the good [[Green Goblin]]). He is currently considered to be on active duty. Recently, he was attacked by the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]], but thanks to his suit he suffered only minor damage.

==Powers and abilities==
Jack Jameson has no [[superhuman]] abilities of his own; his power came from The Human Fly armor. The armor gives The Buzz the powers of superhuman strength and [[flight]]. His [[Gauntlet (gloves)|gauntlet]]s can fire blasts of [[electricity]] (his "Bug Zapper") or ribbons of [[adhesive]] [[polymer]] (his "Fly Paper"). His goggles give him 360 degree vision.  

The neural interface of the armor is bonded specifically to Jack Jameson and will not work for anyone else.
