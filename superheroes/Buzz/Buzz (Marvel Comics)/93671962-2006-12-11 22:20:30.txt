'''The Buzz (Jack "JJ" Jameson)''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]]' series ''[[Spider-Girl]]''. His real name is '''Jack Jameson''', the grandson of [[J. Jonah Jameson]] and the son of [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]].

==History==
Jack Jameson, or JJ as he is called by his friends, was attending a demonstration of Project: Human Fly by his grandfather J. Jonah Jameson, C.E.O. of Jameson Communications (and publisher of the [[Daily Bugle]]). The goal of the project was the creation of a body armor that would grant wearer insect-like superpowers. The staff of the project included Dr. Marla Jameson (Jonah's wife), biophysicist Dr. Sonja Jade and Richie Robertson, grandson of the late [[Joseph "Robbie" Robertson]]. It was on this day that JJ first met Buzz Bannon, a former Navy S.E.A.L. and the person chosen to use the Human Fly armor. In the following time they became close friends, almost like brothers. Then one day, as JJ and Buzz were in the gym, they got a message that Buzz should attend a meeting on the Project: Human Fly, but it was a trap Dr. Sonja Jade turned out to be a traitor who was holding Marla and Jonah Jameson, and Buzz Bannon hostage. She was about to steal the project files and the armor itself. While her minions were going with Buzz to retrieve the armor, JJ and Richie Robertson learned of the situation and triggered the fire-alarm. Buzz used the distraction to overcome most of his adversaries, but during the fight he got a shot in the stomach, but managed to knock down all the men and went for the armor, joined by JJ. Suddenly, the Human Fly entered the scene, rescued the hostages before they could get shot and went after the villains, Dr. Jade was able to get away. Later on that evening  Buzz Bannon's body was discovered in the lab. JJ had donned the armor, but couldn't tell his grandfather (who in a fit a rage, accused the wearer of the Human Fly armor of killing Bannon). JJ decided he would redeem himself and carry on Bannon's legacy, as the Buzz (in honor of Buzz Bannon). Ritchie learned that JJ was the Buzz, and agreed to help him fully utilize the armor, even acting as JJ's mentor and partner. With Ritchies help, he was able to find and defeat Jade.

The Buzz soon encountered [[Spider-Girl]], and despite his good intentions, she was leary of him, since she had been reading articles in the Daily Bugle (written by Jonah Jameseon) that Buzz was a murderer (ironically, the same kind of articles he used to write about her father, [[Spider-Man]]). Buzz however was able to win her over, and even helped her form a new team of [[New Warriors]], (including [[Ladyhawk]], the [[Raptor (comics)|Raptor]], [[Darkdevil]], and Phil Urich (the good [[Green Goblin]]). He is currently considered to be active duty.  Recently, he was attacked by the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]] but thanks to his suit he suffered minor damage.

==Powers==
The Human Fly armor gives Buzz the powers of superhuman strength and flight. His gauntlets can fire blasts of electricity (his "Bug Zapper") or ribbons of adhesive polymer (his "Fly Paper"). His goggles give him 360 degree vision.
