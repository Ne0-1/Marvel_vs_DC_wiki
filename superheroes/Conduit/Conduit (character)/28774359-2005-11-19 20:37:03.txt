'''Conduit''', alias '''Kenny Braverman''', is a [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]] who became obsessed with the idea that he was always second-rate to [[Clark Kent]].  

===History===

Kenny suffered a high level of radiation poisoning due to exposure to [[kryptonite]].  While his health would fail from time to time, he would always manage to recover.  In order to get a handle on the changes his body went through, he volunteered to be thoroughly examined by the [[CIA]].  Not long after, he accepted a covert job in [[France]] that ended up getting thwarted by Clark, unknownst to him.

Kenny always despised Clark and once he got a handle on his powers (by focusing them through his suit), he tried to kill him and [[Lois Lane]]--as Conduit--with metal gauntlets on each arm that could fire beams of kryptonite radiation.  While he failed to kill them, he ended up dueling Superman (not knowing he and Clark were one in the same).

Later, when Conduit found out Superman's secret identity, he abducted him and placed him in a fake twenty-years-ago [[Smallville]] filled with android versions of its citizens, androids programmed to hate Superman. Several of them attacked Superman, including imitations of [[Jonathan Kent|Jonathan]] and [[Martha Kent]] and Lois. Once Superman figured out Conduit was waiting for him at a fake high school football stadium, they fought one-on-one as Clark versus Kenny; no powers.  Eventually, Kenny resorted to using his kryptonite powers and the hand-to-hand escalated to an all-out brawl that heavily damaged the stadium and resulted in Kenny getting overloaded with electrical energy and his own powers.
