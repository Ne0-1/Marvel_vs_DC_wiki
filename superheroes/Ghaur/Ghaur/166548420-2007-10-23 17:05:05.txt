'''Ghaur''' (pronounced "Gore") is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain]]. Created by [[Peter B. Gillis]] and [[Sal Buscema]], he first appeared in ''[[Eternals]]'' vol. 2, <!--W:MOS Volumes, not "series" --> #2 (November, 1985).

In the [[Marvel Universe]] he is the head of the [[Deviant (comics)|Deviant race]]'s [[priesthood]]. His [[superhuman]] powers include the ability to manipulate the minds and actions of any other Deviant whose genetic code is known to him.  Since he also has a [[photographic memory]], that effectively means every Deviant in existence, with the sole exception of the [[Kro (warlord)|Warlord Kro]].

In the 1985 / 1986 ''Eternals vol.2'' [[miniseries]] he plotted to steal the power of a member of the [[Celestials (comics)|Celestials]] ("The [[Dreaming Celestial]]") and briefly succeeded.

In the 1989 ''[[Atlantis Attacks]]'' [[fictional crossover|crossover]] he, in alliance with the [[Lemuria (comics)|Lemurian]] [[super-villainess]]  [[Llyra]], attempted to facilitate the return of the [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]] [[god]] [[Set (serpent god)|Set]] to [[Earth]].

He has since appeared in ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] #370-371, ''[[Heroes for Hire]]'' #5-7 (1997), ''The New Eternals: Apocalypse Now'' (2000) and ''[[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] Vol.3'' #26-29 (2001).
