'''Ghaur''' (pronounced "Gore") is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain]]. Created by [[Peter B. Gillis]] and [[Sal Buscema]], he first appeared in ''[[Eternals]] Vol.2'' #2 ([[November]], [[1985]]).

In the [[Marvel Universe]] he is the head of the [[Deviants|Deviant]] [[race]]'s [[priesthood]]. His [[superhuman]] powers include the ability to manipulate the minds and actions of any other Deviant, with the sole exception of the [[Kro|Warlord Kro]].

In the 1985 / [[1986]] ''Eternals vol.2'' [[miniseries]] he plotted to steal the power of a member of the [[Celestials (comics)|Celestials]] ("The Dreaming Celestial") and briefly succeeded.

In the [[1989]] ''[[Atlantis Attacks]]'' [[fictional crossover|crossover]] he, in alliance with the [[Lemuria|Lemurian]] [[super-villainess]]  [[Llyra]], attempted to facilitate the return of the [[serpent]] [[god]] [[Set (Serpent God)|Set]] to [[Earth]].

He has since appeared in ''[[Heroes for Hire]]'' #5-7 ([[1997]]), ''The New Eternals: Apocalypse Now'' ([[2000]]) and ''[[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] Vol.3'' #26-29 ([[2001]]).
