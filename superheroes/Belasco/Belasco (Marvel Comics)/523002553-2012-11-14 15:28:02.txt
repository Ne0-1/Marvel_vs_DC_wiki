'''Belasco''' is a [[Fictional character|fictional]] [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|Universe]]. The character's first appearance was in ''Ka-Zar the Savage'' #11; he was created by [[Bruce Jones (comics)|Bruce Jones]] and [[Brent Anderson]].

==Fictional character biography==
Belasco is an ancient, evil [[magic (paranormal)|sorcerer]] serving the [[Elder Gods (Marvel Comics)|Elder Gods]], and is perhaps best known for his kidnapping of [[Magik (comics)|Illyana Rasputin]].

===Early history===
Belasco's early history is told by the poet [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], though there is some dispute as to the veracity of these accounts. Allegedly, Belasco was a sorcerer in 13th Century [[Florence]], [[Italy]] who used his knowledge of [[alchemy]] and the black arts to contact the Elder Gods (actually extra-dimensional [[Demons (Marvel Comics)|demonic entities]]). He forged a pact with them enabling them to cross the barrier to our dimension using a pentagonal arrangement of five '''Bloodstones'''. In return, Belasco was granted [[immortality]] and immense mystical power. He was also given a demonic appearance, as he was intended to form a new race of Earth-dwelling demons.

To this end, he kidnapped Bice "Beatrice" dei Portinari, beloved of Dante, to give birth to the first of this new race. He fled with her to the [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlantean]] isle of Pangea, where the Elder Gods directed him to Mt. Flavius, where their summoning ritual could take place. While en route, Belasco raped Beatrice, and she was nine months pregnant by the time they arrived. He embarked onto the island, closely pursued by Dante, and took Beatrice into a network of underground passages designed to resemble [[Hell]]. Dante found them just in time to witness Beatrice dying in childbirth and, enraged, he attacked Belasco. During the battle, a pipe was accidentally struck, releasing an unknown liquid that placed Belasco in [[suspended animation]]. At some point on the island, Belasco also lost the locket containing the Bloodstones.

===Modern history===

In recent years, the volcano mountain became active again, releasing Belasco. He quickly located the locket and found a new sacrifice, [[Shanna the She-Devil|Shanna O'Hara]]. He placed her under his mental control and began the spell. He sought to make Shanna the mother of a demonic race he would father. However, just as he was almost finished, Shanna's mate [[Ka-Zar]] appeared and hurled the locket into the volcano, sealing away the Elder Gods and apparently destroying Belasco.<ref>''Ka-Zar the Savage'' #11-13</ref>

However, he instead was trapped in [[Otherplace|Limbo]], also called '''Otherplace''', where he spent his years conquering it. Once complete, he drew the young Illyana Rasputina to him and she was transported to Limbo. His intention was to make her his disciple and use her to open a gateway for the Elder gods he served. The [[X-Men]] followed and saved Illyana, transporting her back to Earth, but  at the cost of themselves becoming trapped in Limbo. For years they battled Belasco with the entire team succumbing to either temptation, corruption or death. Belasco then lured an alternate-dimensional Illyana to Limbo in a repeat of his earlier attempt.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #160</ref> This time the X-Men team escaped back to Earth and Illyana was trapped in Limbo. He made Illyana his apprentice in the dark arts, transforming her into a "demon sorceress." He forcibly shaped part of her [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] into the first Bloodstone, giving her great potential for power and allowing him to hold sway over her so that she willingly created a second. However, after guidance from the remaining X-Men in Limbo, she rebelled against him, driving him from Limbo.<ref>''Magik'' #1-4</ref> Now its new master, she returned to her own world only seconds after the X-Men had returned, and shortly after joined the [[New Mutants]] as Magik.<ref>''New Mutants'' (vol. 1) #14</ref> Magik was later deposed as the ruler of Limbo by the demons [[S'ym]] and [[N'astirh]], the latter of whom was destroyed in the "[[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]]" crossover, which also seemingly restored Illyana's lost childhood.<ref>''New Mutants'' (vol. 1) #71-73</ref>

During Illyana's seduction, Belasco also attempted to transform Ka-Zar and Shanna into demons to be parents to a new demonic race. He was seemingly defeated when Ka-Zar impaled Belasco on his own sword.<ref>''Ka-Zar the Savage'' #29</ref> Belasco was next revealed to be the new master of the [[Cat People (comics)|Cat People]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #314</ref>

Belasco eventually took control of Limbo once more. The cultist Sammy Smith, alias "[[Rev (comics)|the Rev]]", who was a [[Jim Jones]] analogue, worshipped Belasco as [[Lucifer]]. Belasco sought to wipe out humanity, using Smith as a pawn. The Rev fought the [[Punisher]] twice, the second time alongside the Punisher's longtime foe [[Jigsaw (Marvel Comics)|Jigsaw]]. When the Punisher killed Jigsaw, the Rev used his Belasco-granted powers to resurrect the thug, although both were defeated despite Smith's gift of demonic magic.<ref>''Punisher'' #35-40, Vol. II</ref>

Belasco also turned [[Alpha Flight]]-ally [[Witchfire (Marvel Comics)|Witchfire]] against her team by influencing her demonic side.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' (vol. 1) #122-124</ref> She finally was restored to normal and returned to [[Beta Flight]], Alpha Flight's support group. It was strongly suggested during this story that Belasco is Witchfire's father or at least that Witchfire believes so.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

Later, Belasco and the fear-demon [[D'Spayre]] contested to corrupt [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], the son of [[Madelyne Pryor]], who had been the ally of S'ym and N'astirh during "[[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]]". Belasco banished D'Spayre and summoned himself, Cable, and Cable's ally Lee Forrester to Limbo, where S'ym threw Belasco out of his way and fought with Cable. Cable won, and he and Lee returned to Earth.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

It was eventually revealed that Illyana's best friend [[Kitty Pryde]] had received Illyana's [[Soulsword]] after Illyana had died; in dying, she had bonded the Soulsword to Kitty's own essence. After Kitty's team [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] fought off several claimants to the sword, [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]'s girlfriend [[Amanda Sefton]] was given the sword. She then gave the sword to her mother, [[Margali Szardos]], who was in turn kidnapped by Belasco and brought to Limbo. Nightcrawler and Sefton freed her, and Sefton secretly took the sword and adopted the codename Magik for herself. Belasco and his allies, the [[N'Garai]] demons, fought the X-Men again soon after, but were defeated by the X-Men with the assistance of the new Magik.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

===Quest for Magik===
Cast into an even lower level of hell by his disappointed gods, Belasco used the life-force of a low level demon to regain access to the Limbo dimension. Once there he fought his way through Amanda Sefton's minions before battling the sorceress himself. As opposed to their first battle, Belasco was successful and cast her out of Limbo, becoming Limbo's ruler once again. Seeking to discover if the first Magik (Illyana Rasputin) was truly dead or simply hiding, Belasco summoned the [[New X-Men]] because he felt the scent of the [[House of M]] Magik on them. It is revealed that Belasco's fixation on Illyana is not simply for her powers, but also because he fell in love with her. Finally Belasco was defeated by Magik with the help of a reformed [[Pixie (X-Men)|Pixie]], who stabbed him with a 'Souldagger'.{{Issue|date=June 2011}} Now Magik is the new ruler of Limbo, served by S'ym and N'astirh and in search of her soul.{{Issue|date=June 2011}}

==Powers and abilities==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Mgk001a.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Belasco and his demons from ''Magik'' #1. Words by [[Chris Claremont]], art by [[John Buscema]] and [[Tom Palmer (comics)|Tom Palmer]]]] -->

Belasco is one of the most powerful sorcerers on Earth and possesses a wide knowledge of the mystical black arts. He possesses the ability to manipulate the forces of magic for a variety of effects, including the ability to fire concussive bolts of mystical energy, create protective shields of mystical energy, transform and transmute matter both living and inanimate, travel interdimensionally, shoot mystical rays, control the minds of humans and animals, and raise the dead under certain circumstances. He has an encyclopedic knowledge of spells from a variety of books of occult spells that he can use.

He was also endowed by the [[Elder Gods (Marvel Comics)|Elder Gods]] with immortality and some degree of invulnerability. His demonic form apparently also possesses augmented physical strength, as he was effortlessly able to overpower Ka-Zar with his one good arm, and pick him up by his throat using his tail. However, his own sword, which was forged by the Elder Gods themselves, has the power to harm him. It was this which cut off his right arm under unrevealed circumstances.

Belasco's powers are somehow linked to those of [[Magik (comics)|Magik]]. When they fought a battle in [[Otherplace]] and Magik took on her "Darkchilde" form, Belasco simultaneously reverted to human form, losing most of his power and his invulnerability in the process.

He has also come to possess a wide knowledge of the advanced technology left by the Atlanteans in Pangea.

Additionally, he is an exceptional swordsman and battle tactician and was seen wielding a battle axe with great skill.

==Appearance==
Originally he was a Caucasian human man.

As the demon lord, Belasco has red skin, a prehensile tail, pronounced fangs, glowing red eyes with no visible iris, small horns on his forehead, pointed ears, and as a result of an early conflict, only one arm (his left).

During the "Black Sun" conflict, he had a restored arm and his horns were more pronounced. He has since lost the arm and the longer horns.

==Other versions==
===Universe X Belasco (Nightcrawler)===
In the [[future|futuristic]] ''[[Earth X|Universe X]]'' maxi-series by [[Jim Krueger]] and [[Alex Ross]], it is revealed that Belasco is actually one and the same with his enemy [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] of the [[X-Men]], who had become amnesiac and was displaced in time. The original Belasco was found dead, frozen after his battle with Dante. The more demonic Belasco was actually Nightcrawler. After his origins are revealed to him by a resurrected [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]], Nightcrawler/Belasco finally joins the side of good.{{Issue|date=August 2009}}
