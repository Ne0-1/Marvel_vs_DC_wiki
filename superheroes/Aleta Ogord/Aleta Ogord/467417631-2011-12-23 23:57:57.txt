Aleta Ogord, an Arcturan, was born on the planet Arcturus IV, in the late 20th century of the [[Earth-691]] [[alternate timeline|timeline]]. She was trained to be aggressive and resented her weak and intellectual adoptive brother [[Starhawk (comics)|Stakar]].  When she was physically merged with Stakar, such that only one of them could exist physically at any one time, she spent much time suspended in limbo.  She grew passive and, in time, fell in love with Stakar.  The Hawk God allowed the two to separate for a time, and she gave birth to three children, Tara, Sita, and John.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol 1 #11</ref>

Aleta's father, Ogord, sought revenge on Starhawk for abandoning him, kidnapped his grandchildren, and turned them into [[psychic vampire]]s.

==Powers and abilities==
Aleta is a member of the alien race of the planet Arcturus IV who has merged into a composite being with her adoptive brother Stakar by an alien energy device. Aleta can focus [[photons]] into solid-light constructs (such as battering rams, bubbles, ramps, etc.). She can fly by standing on a disc of her solid light and mentally commanding it to rise upwards. Later she was shown to create more complicated constructions and manipulate them (moving and changing size). She was able to lift things weighing up to 50 tons, as well as increased stamina, durability and agility that are common among Arcturans. When she became [[Starhawk (comics)|Starhawk]], Aleta gained the ability to fly at speeds approaching that of light by tapping anti-gravitons, was able to survive in the vacuum of space, manipulation of light to fire concussive force blasts or create protective shields, and displayed limited [[precognition]]. She possesses an extremely long lifespan and in immunity to most known diseases and radiation sickness. She possesses extrasensory sensitivity to energy patterns and fluctuations. She is able to phase through solid matter by aligning her own molecules in a corresponding pattern to the molecules of the object she is attempting to pass through. After separating from Stakar, she retained the powers granted to her through their merging.

Aleta has knowledge of the archaeology of the planet Arcturus IV. She also has extensive knowledge of various civilizations throughout the Milky Way Galaxy.
