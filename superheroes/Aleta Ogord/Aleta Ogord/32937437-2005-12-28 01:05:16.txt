'''Aleta''' Ogord, briefly also known as '''Starhawk''', is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]]ine in a future of the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].

==Character biography==
Aleta Ogord, an Arcturan, was trained to be aggressive and resented her weak and intellectual half-brother [[Starhawk (comics)|Stakar]].  When she was physically merged with Stakar such that only one of them could exist physically at any one time, she spent much time suspended in limbo.  She grew passive and, in time, fell in love with Stakar.  The Hawk God allowed the two to separate for a time, and she gave birth to three children, Tara, Sita, and John.

Aleta's father, Ogord, sought revenge on Starhawk for abandoning him, kidnapped his grandchildren, and turned them into [[psychic vampire]]s.  The children were killed, and Aleta held it against Stakar for the rest of his life, as she felt he could have prevented it.

Eventually, Aleta and Starhawk were separated, and she began a relationship with [[Vance Astro]] until a dying Starhawk reabsorbed her to save his own life. For a time, the merged being existed only in Stakar's newly darkened form, even when Aleta was in control, until Aleta finally overpowered Stakar, sent him back to his infant body in the past, and assumed the mantle of Starhawk.  She held the title for a brief period, until Stakar returned during a visit to another timeline, after which she gave up the title and powers of Starhawk to be rid of Stakar's influence, which had made her cold and unfeeling.

==Powers and abilities==
Aleta can create solid light constructs, in a similar manner to the [[DC Comics]] [[Green Lantern]]s.
