'''Nocturne''' (Talia Josephine "TJ" Wagner) is a [[fictional character]], a member of the reality-hopping team of superheroes the [[Exiles (comics)|Exiles]].  She is from an [[Parallel universe|alternate reality]], where she is the daughter of [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] and the [[Scarlet Witch]].  

She had a romantic relationship with her teammate [[Thunderbird (comics)|Thunderbird]] and was pregnant with his baby, but she lost the child because of a supposed [[miscarriage]] shortly after his death.

Eventually, she was replaced on the Exiles team by [[Beak (comics)|Beak]], and was left in the main [[Marvel Universe]]. At first, it seemed as if it were a simple trade: as soon as Beak came back, Nocturne would return to the Exiles, and that would be that. However, Nocturne's recent appearences in [[X-Men]], [[Uncanny X-Men]], and [[New Excalibur]] indicate that she will become a permanent character in the Marvel Universe, and thus will never go home again.

Nocturne then infiltrated [[Black Tom Cassidy]]'s new [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants|Brotherhood]], but was sucked in to [[Xorn]]'s head along with several other characters while attempting to possess Black Tom. She ended up in [[Mojoworld]] with the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] (another Brotherhood mole) and was enslaved by [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]].  To escape, Nocturne took control of Mojo's henchman, [[Spiral (comics)|Spiral]], and opened a portal to the X-Men's [[Danger Room]], where they were reunited with the team. This, however, was a trap set by Spiral who was in more control of her body than thought, leaving a portal open to allow Mojo to cross over as well. Mojo turned the X-Men into [[X-Babies]], but they managed to overpower his forces anyway. The group was re-aged, and Nocturne remained with the X-Men for the time being.

During the House of M reality, Nocturne was sought after by [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]]'s Marauders for having royal Magnus blood (being an alternate daughter of the [[Scarlet Witch]]), but was protected by [[Psylocke]] and [[Marvel Girl]]. Marvel Girl allowed TJ to possess her in order to keep her out of the Marauder's reach, but Nocturne ended up taking control, and in a confused daze, flew up and out. Psylocke pursued, enventually culminating in a telekinetic blade battle, which Psylocke won. This allowed Marvel girl's own consciousness to resurface. After the [[House of M]] event, Nocturne will reppear in [[New Excalibur]], alongside [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]], [[Sage (comics)|Sage]], [[Dazzler]], [[Captain Britain]], and [[Peter Wisdom]].

==Powers and abilities==

Like her father, TJ has blue fur, though shorter and lighter than his; three fingers per hand and two toes per foot; and has a (retractable) prehensile tail. Nocturne's other powers include the ability to enter and possess another person's body for a limited amount of time; the experience leaves the other person temporarily comatose. Nocturne can also fire "hex bolts," destructive projectiles made up of extradimensional energy from the dimension Nightcrawler teleports through. Nocturne also has a degree of latent telepathy, but it was only usable to any degree when enhanced by a cerebro machine.

==Also==
There is also a [[Spider-Man]] charcter named Nocturne.
