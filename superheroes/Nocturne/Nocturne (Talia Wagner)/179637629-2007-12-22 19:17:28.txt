'''Nocturne''' is a code name used by four separate [[fictional characters]] in the [[Marvel Comics Universe]]. This article deals with '''Talia Josephine "T.J." Wagner''', formerly associated with the reality-hopping [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]] and currently a member of [[Excalibur (comics)#New Excalibur (2005)|New Excalibur]].

Other Marvel characters associated with the code name "Nocturne" include [[Angela Cairn]], [[Night Raven]], and a vampiric foe of [[First Line (comics)|First Line]] team member [[Black Fox (comics)#Black Fox (Dr. Robert William Paine)|Black Fox]].

==Fictional character biography==
Nocturne is from an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate reality]] outside the main [[Marvel Universe]] ([[Earth-616]]). She is the daughter of that reality's [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]<ref>''X-Men: Millennial Visions'' (August, 2000)</ref> and the [[Scarlet Witch]]<ref>''Exiles'' #4</ref>.

===Life in the X-Men=== 
T.J. grew up around the X-Men and under her father's care, but her mother remains a member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. In her reality [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], who is under the control of the [[Shadow King]], attacks [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]]. The Shadow King is expelled from Wolverine's mind, but Xavier is fatally wounded in the attack and Logan is left a cripple. [[Jean Grey]] dies shortly afterwards, and [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] blames Wolverine for both deaths, so he abandons the team. As a result, Wolverine and Nightcrawler take over as leaders of the [[X-Men]] and the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]]. Nocturne was an active member of the X-Men since she was seventeen years old, and has faced several of the team’s most dangerous foes, including [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] and a vengeance-seeking [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]]. Nocturne saves Wolverine's life during Cyclops’s attack by possessing her unconscious teammate [[Armageddon (comics)|Armageddon]] and using his telekinetic powers to move Wolverine's paralyzed arms to impale Cyclops<ref>''Exiles'' #42</ref>.

Nocturne has strong relationships with many of her fellow X-Men, including her "aunt" [[Kitty Pryde]] and her boyfriend [[Warpath (comics)|James Proudstar]], her reality's [[Thunderbird (comics)|Thunderbird]]. She is also very close to her father, despite feeling pressure to follow in his footsteps.

===Exiles===
[[Image:XMEN 05252005 0024.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Cover to ''Exiles'' #1. Nocturne is in the lower left corner. This is the first appearance of Nocturne on a cover to a comic book. Art by Mike McKone.]]At twenty years old, Nocturne is taken by the [[Timebroker]] and told she had become "unhinged from time."<ref>''Exiles'' #1</ref> The Timebroker tells Nocturne that if she does not work to right the wrongs that have occurred in a multitude of [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|alternate universes]], her own timeline would remain altered and she would be returned to a universe in which Nightcrawler was murdered some time ago by his mother, [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]. So Nocturne becomes a member of the reality-hopping [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]<ref>''Exiles'' #1</ref>. 

Over the course of the Exiles' first adventures, Nocturne develops a romantic relationship with teammate [[Thunderbird (comics)|John Proudstar/Thunderbird]], who is the former [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|horseman]] War for his reality’s [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. By the time the team is trapped for a month on a [[Skrull]]-dominated alternate Earth, Nocturne is pregnant with Thunderbird's child. However, John is horribly wounded during his efforts to repel [[Galactus]] during that mission, and is left behind when the team moves to the next reality<ref>''Exiles'' #8-10</ref>. Nocturne later miscarries the baby; it is unclear whether the miscarriage is natural, or whether she terminated the pregnancy herself. Although devastated by the loss of Thunderbird, Nocturne remains a competent member of the Exiles and eventually regains much of her sunny demeanor.

Nocturne, and the Exiles, go to the main [[Marvel Universe]] where they meet the [[X-Men]] after [[Havok (X-Men)|Havok]]'s cancelled wedding<ref>''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #425-426</ref>. The Exiles team up with the X-Men against an evil Havok from the ''[[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]]'' universe, who shares a body with the good Havok. After Havok is subdued, the Timebroker arrives to personally eliminate the ''Mutant X'' Havok's consciousness. During this mission Nocturne meets this version of Nightcrawler, whom she accidentally calls “Dad” at first. The demeanor of the main Marvel Universe Nightcrawler is very similar to that of the Nightcrawler from Nocturne’s reality, so the two develop a close bond that resembles a father-daughter relationship.<ref>''Exiles'' #28-30</ref>

After a few more missions the Exiles come back to the [[Marvel Universe]], and are given a new teammate, [[Namora#Exiles|Namora]], and a new mission from the Tallus: "Leave your possessions and earn your wings". [[Mister Fantastic|Mr. Fantastic]] of the [[Fantastic Four]] eventually deciphered the mission's meaning: [[Beak (comics)|Beak]] of the [[New X-Men]] has to go with the Exiles and Nocturne has to stay behind in the main [[Marvel Universe]].<ref>''Exiles'' #46-48</ref>

===Brotherhood/Return from Mojoworld===
Nocturne then infiltrates [[Exodus (comics)#Brotherhood of Mutants|Exodus]]'s new [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants|Brotherhood]], but is sucked into [[Xorn]]'s head, along with several other members of the Brotherhood, while possessing [[Black Tom Cassidy]]<ref>''X-Men'' #161-164</ref>. She ends up in [[Mojoworld]] with [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] (another Brotherhood mole), and is enslaved by [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]].  To escape, Nocturne takes control of Mojo's henchman, [[Spiral (comics)|Spiral]], and opens a portal to the X-Men's [[Danger Room]], where they were reunited with the X-Men<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #460</ref>. However, this is a trap set by Spiral who was in more control of her body than thought, leaving a portal open to allow Mojo to cross over as well. Mojo turns the X-Men into [[X-Babies]], but they manage to overpower his forces anyway. The group is re-aged, and Nocturne remains with the X-Men for the time being. <ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #461</ref>.

===House of M===
During the [[House of M]] reality, Nocturne is sought by [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]]'s [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]] for having royal Magnus blood (because she is an alternate reality daughter of [[Scarlet Witch]]), but is protected by [[Psylocke]] and [[Rachel Summers|Marvel Girl]]. Marvel Girl allows Nocturne to possess her in order to keep her out of the Marauders' reach, but Nocturne ends up taking control, and in a confused daze, flies away. Psylocke pursues, eventually culminating in a telekinetic blade battle, which Psylocke wins. This allows Marvel Girl's own consciousness to resurface. The three of them fight off the Marauders together and later help [[Captain Britain]] and [[Meggan]] prevent reality from being destroyed.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #462-465</ref>

===''New Excalibur''===
:''Main article: [[Excalibur (comics)#New Excalibur (2005)|New Excalibur]]''
Nocturne currently appears in [[Excalibur (comics)|New Excalibur]], alongside [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]], [[Sage (comics)|Sage]], [[Dazzler]], [[Captain Britain]], and [[Peter Wisdom]]. During her time with New Excalibur, Nocturne has developed the ability to possess people ''without'' knocking them unconscious.

More recently Nocturne suffered a [[stroke]]<ref>''New Excalibur'' #16</ref>. She is currently suffering aftereffects, such as [[hemiparesis]], partial [[Retrograde amnesia|memory loss]], and [[aphasia]]. She  is making great progress towards recovery<ref>''New Excalibur'' #20</ref>, but it is uncertain if she can ever fully recover. However, she was able to save numerous civilians in the battle against [[Albion (Marvel Comics)#Alternate Brian Braddock|Albion]] by possessing one of Albion's evil Captain Britains. She was recently reunited with the Exiles, including her lover Thunderbird who is no longer comatose<ref>''[[X-Men: Die by the Sword]]'' #1-5</ref>. However her return to the Exiles is short, because after defeating [[Mad Jim Jaspers]] Nocturne and Thunderbird leave to help their relationship grow and to help Nocturne more fully recover from her stroke<ref>''Exiles'' #100</ref>. Along with Blink, they go to [[Heather Hudson (Exiles)|Heather]]'s reality so Heather can keep track of Nocturne's health.

==Powers and abilities==
Like her [[Nightcrawler (comics)#Powers and abilities|father]], T.J. has a radically unique physiology. She has blue fur covering her body, three fingers per hand, two toes per foot, and a retractable<ref>''Exiles'' #42</ref> prehensile tail.  

Her agility, balance, bodily coordination and flexibility are at superhuman levels. She can move in manners that surpass those of an Olympic level gymnast, and a bone structure allowing great flexibility. She can remain in a crouched position for a long time and perform contortionist-type feats without causing any damage to her spine. She has an ability to cling to surfaces with her hands and feet in a manner similar to Spider-Man. Her fur provides near-invisibility when in the shadows, and she has excellent vision in dark conditions. 

Nocturne's powers include the ability to enter and [[Spiritual possession|possess]] another person's body for up to 12 hours; the experience usually leaves the other person comatose for up to 24 hours. Nocturne can also fire "hex bolts," destructive projectiles made up of extradimensional energy from the dimension Nightcrawler teleports through<ref>''Exiles'' #4</ref>.

Nocturne also has a degree of latent telepathy, but it was only usable to any degree when enhanced by a [[Cerebro]] machine<ref>''Exiles'' #1</ref>. She does not appear to possess any abilities related to her mother's [[Scarlet Witch#Powers and abilities|reality alteration abilities]], but the "hex bolts" that she derives from her father are named after her mother's powers as an homage.

==Other versions== 
===X-Men: The End===
In [[X-Men: The End]] Nocturne is captured by Tullamore Voge and turned into one of his slavers. [[Aliyah Bishop]] saves her from Voge, and Nocturne aids the X-Men in the final battle with [[Cassandra Nova]]. She is one of the lucky ones to survive the final battle, and lives with Nightcrawler and his family. She is seen among the survivors twenty years later at [[Alternate versions of Kitty Pryde#X-Men: The End|President Kitty Pryde]]'s speech to the mutants.

===Days of Future Present===
In the 1990 "Days of Future Present" annual crossover, a future version of Franklin Richards reveals the New Mutants of the future, including a similar appearing daughter of Nightcrawler named Blue.<ref>''New Mutants Annual'' #6</ref> This character, however, possesses her father's teleportation abilities, albeit at a greatly enhanced scale.
