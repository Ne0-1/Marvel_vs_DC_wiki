'''Luna Maximoff''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supporting character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. The daughter of [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]], she was born in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #240, written and drawn by [[John Byrne]]. She is named after the moon, having been born there.

The first child to be born to a [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] and [[Inhumans|Inhuman]], the genetic markers denoting these subgroups in humanity supposedly "cancelled out" in her, leaving her a normal human. While Quicksilver, aghast at the thought of having a flatscan, human daughter, initially sought to expose her to the Inhumans' mutagenic [[Terrigen Mist]]s, he was talked out of this by [[Gorgon (comics)|Gorgon]] and [[Karnak (comics)|Karnak]], impersonating [[Lockjaw (comics)|Lockjaw]] to make their point.

Years later, however, when Luna was six years old, Quicksilver was depowered by the [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation of mutantkind]]. Desperate to get his powers back, he exposed himself to the mists, and subsequently talked Luna into returning to Earth with him, where he exposed her to some collected mist too.  Thanks to the Mists, she can now see the feelings of the people she looks at in terms of colours, as a sort of visual empathy. Having trouble dealing with this, she now must wear shades at all times. Seemingly addicted to the mist, her continuing exposure to the mutagenic has apparently enhanced in a short time her newfound power, becoming a full fledged empath, able to sense, remove and alter emotions at will. After the whole ''[[Son of M]]'' ordeal, Quicksilver returned her to Crystal. Currently, the Inhumans are treating her addiction to the Mists, albeit is unknown how her half-inhuman body will react to her former addiction, and if she will retain her abilities longer than baseline humans.

==Alternate versions==
In [[Earth-98]] continuity, Luna is the name of the daughter of Crystal and the [[Human Torch]].
