==Fictional character biography==
The daughter of [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]], she is named after the moon, where she was born. Luna is the first child to be born to a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] and an [[Inhumans|Inhuman]]; the genetic markers denoting these subgroups in humanity supposedly "cancelled out" in her, leaving her a normal human.

Quicksilver, aghast at the thought of having a flatscan, human daughter, initially sought to expose her to the Inhumans' mutagenic [[Terrigen Mist]]s. He was talked out of this by [[Lockjaw (comics)|Lockjaw]] (or possibly an impersonation by [[Gorgon (Inhuman)|Gorgon]] and [[Karnak (comics)|Karnak]] to make their point<ref>''[[Thing (comics)|Thing]]'' #3 (September 1983)</ref>) who, like the Thing, prompted the idea that the mists could turn her into a monstrosity like them (or the amphibious [[Triton (comics)|Triton]]).{{issue|date=March 2013}}

Luna was considered an abomination by mutant extremist [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]], who sought to murder her on several occasions. Luna was protected by the [[High Evolutionary]] and his New Men.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

As seen in flashbacks, Luna and the New Men consider each other family.<ref>''Quicksilver'' #7 (May, 1998)</ref>

===Son of M===

Years later, however, when Luna was six years old, Quicksilver was depowered by the [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation of mutantkind]]. Desperate to get his powers back, he exposed himself to the Mists, and subsequently talked Luna into returning to Earth with him, where he exposed her, too. Thanks to the Mists, she can now see the feelings of the people she looks at in terms of colors, as a sort of visual empathy. Having trouble dealing with this, she now must wear shades at all times. Seemingly addicted to the Mist, her continued exposure to the mutagen has apparently enhanced her newfound power to the point of being a full-fledged empath, able to sense, remove, and alter emotions at will. After the events of ''[[Son of M]]'', Quicksilver returned her to Crystal. Currently, the Inhumans are treating her addiction to the Mists, although it is unknown how her body will react to her addiction and if she will retain her abilities longer than baseline humans.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

===Silent War===
In the ''[[Silent War]]'' miniseries, Luna still has her aura-sensing empathic ability, and is seen using it to defeat Karnak in a training session. She is used to track Terrigen Crystals. [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus]] used her to remove the mental shackles that were placed on his ability to use his mind control powers and also free the evil eye powers of [[Ahura (comics)|Ahura]]. She regrets that this has allowed Maximus to take control of the Inhumans away from [[Black Bolt]], who appears to have lost his sanity. When asking Black Bolt what she should do about [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus]] and her role in his ascendance, Black Bolt opens his mouth to answer her.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

===Secret Invasion===
Luna is endangered when one member of the invading Skrull army is disguised as one of her playmates.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Inhumans'' #1-4</ref> After the [[Skrull]]s were repelled from Attilan, Luna was seen with Maximus as [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]] heads into space to look for where the Skrulls are holding Black Bolt.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #3</ref>

===Dark Reign===
Luna was present in Attilan when Quicksilver brings the Xerogen Crystals to Medusa on Hala and claimed that a Skrull posed as him and stole the Terrigen Crystals; but he is then confronted by his daughter afterwards. Luna tells her father that she saw through his lie. Bidding Pietro farewell, she told him that she will always love him only because he is her father (and therefore will not expose the truth about him), but she will never respect him again.<ref>''The Mighty Avengers'' #31</ref>

Recently, when her father (now a member of [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]) was confronted in a press conference by [[Fatale (Marvel Comics)|Fatale]] about his actions, and finally acknowledged his actions and his lies, he was later visited by Luna; she was proud of him for owning up to what he did, and told him he had earned her respect back, much to his relief.<ref>''All-new X-Factor'' #12</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Luna can read and manipulate the state of nearby beings, including their emotional state, intentions, truthfulness, mental illness, and whether a person is under the mental control of [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus]]. These states are represented to her as various cascading colors that she learns to interpret and to change for various effects. Because her powers are essentially some kind of visual empathy they are generally limited to her line of sight. When her empathic powers emerged, her blue-colored eyes turned golden, and because she is forced to wear specialized shades most of the time, it is unknown if her eyes remained in this state.

Luna can manipulate these auras to effect a mental manipulation ability. She has been able to release beings from mental shackles that prevented them from using their superhuman powers. Magneto had to ask her not to remove his sense of despair at losing his powers.

Luna may be able to sense and track certain energy patterns from far distances as, from the Moon, she could track Terrigen Crystals in various locations on the Earth. However, this ability may be limited to the Terrigen Crystals because of their nature or the long period she spent inhaling Terrigen mists. Luna is able to sense from far distances whenever the crystals are being used and whether they are being used by humans, rather than Inhumans.

==Other versions==
In the alternate future of ''[[Earth X]]'', Luna has sprouted colorful wings. She is engaged to be married to [[Ahura (comics)|Ahura]], the son of Black Bolt and Medusa. The planned festivities are interrupted by the Inhumans not understanding what Earth has undergone.<ref>''Earth X'' #1-3 (Aprilâ€“June 1999)</ref>
