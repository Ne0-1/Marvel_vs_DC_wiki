==Fictional character biography==
The daughter of [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]], she is named after the moon, having been born there. Luna is the first child to be born to a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] and [[Inhumans|Inhuman]], the genetic markers denoting these subgroups in humanity supposedly "cancelled out" in her, leaving her a normal human. While Quicksilver, aghast at the thought of having a flatscan, human daughter, initially sought to expose her to the Inhumans' mutagenic [[Terrigen Mist]]s, he was talked out of this by [[Gorgon (comics)|Gorgon]] and [[Karnak (comics)|Karnak]], impersonating [[Lockjaw (comics)|Lockjaw]] to make their point.<ref>''[[Thing (comics)|Thing]]'' #3; September, 1983</ref>

As a normal human and granddaughter of Magneto, Luna was considered an abomination by mutant extremist [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]], who sought to murder her on several occasions. Luna was protected by the [[High Evolutionary]] and his New Men, who suffered multiple casualties in their successful efforts to shield her from harm.

===Son of M===

Years later, however, when Luna was six years old, Quicksilver was depowered by the [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation of mutantkind]]. Desperate to get his powers back, he exposed himself to the Mists, and subsequently talked Luna into returning to Earth with him, where he exposed her too. Thanks to the Mists, she can now see the feelings of the people she looks at in terms of colors, as a sort of visual empathy. Having trouble dealing with this, she now must wear shades at all times. Seemingly addicted to the Mist, her continued exposure to the mutagen has apparently enhanced her newfound power to the point of being a full fledged empath, able to sense, remove and alter emotions at will. After the events of ''[[Son of M]]'', Quicksilver returned her to Crystal. Currently, the Inhumans are treating her addiction to the Mists, although it is unknown how her body will react to her addiction and if she will retain her abilities longer than baseline humans.

===Silent War===
In the ''[[Silent War]]'' miniseries, Luna still has her aura-sensing empathic ability, and is seen using it to defeat Karnak in a training session. She is used to track Terrigen Crystals. [[Maximus]] used her to remove the mental shackles that were placed on his ability to use his mind control powers and also free the evil eye powers of [[Ahura (comics)|Ahura]]. She regrets that this has allowed Maximus to take control of the Inhumans away from [[Black Bolt]], who appears to have lost his sanity. When asking Black Bolt what she should do about Maximus and her role in his ascendance, Black Bolt opens his mouth to answer her.

===Secret Invasion===
After the [[Skrull]]s were repelled from Attilan, Luna was seen with Maximus as Medusa heads into space to look for where the Skrulls are holding Black Bolt.<ref>Secret Invasion #3</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Luna can read and affect the state of nearby beings including their emotional state, intentions, truth telling, mental illness, and whether a person is under the mental control of [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus]]. These states are represented to her as various cascading colors that she learns to interpret. She possesses additional healing or mental manipulation abilities, as she has also been able to release beings from mental shackles that prevented them from using their superhuman powers and Magneto had to ask her not to remove his sense of despair at losing his powers.  Because her powers are essentially some kind of visual empathy they are limited to her line of sight.

She may be able to sense energy patterns from far distances as, from the Moon, she could track Terrigen Crystals in various locations on the Earth. However, this ability may be limited to the Terrigen Crystals. She is even able to sense when the crystals are being used and whether they are being used by humans, rather than Inhumans.

==Other versions==
In the alternature future of ''[[Earth X]]'' Luna has sprouted colorful wings. She is engaged to be married to [[Ahura (comics)|Ahura]], the son of Black Bolt and Medusa. The planned for festivities are interrupted by the Inhumans not understanding what Earth has undergone.<ref>''Earth X'' #1-3 (April-June 1999)</ref>
