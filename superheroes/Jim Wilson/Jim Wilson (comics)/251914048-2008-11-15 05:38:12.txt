'''Jim Wilson''' is a [[fictional]] [[comic book]] character. A supporting character appearing in [[Marvel Comics]], Wilson was a longtime friend of [[Bruce Banner]] (aka the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]) and [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]].  In ''[[Incredible Hulk]]'' #388 (December 1991), it was revealed that Wilson was [[HIV]]-positive. He succumbed to the disease in ''Incredible Hulk'' #420 (August 1994).

==Fictional character biography== 
Jim Wilson first appeared in the ''[[Incredible Hulk]]'' #131 as an angry young man who befriends the Hulk.  Throughout the years, Jim Wilson would often appear as a friend of Bruce Banner, following Banner/Hulk throughout much of the 1970s as one of the few people that Banner could trust. ''The Incredible Hulk'' #232 revealed that Sam Wilson, the superhero [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], was Jim's uncle. 

In ''Incredible Hulk'' #388 Wilson enlists Rick Jones to play a benefit concert at a hospice for [[AIDS]] patients. On the drive from the airport, Wilson tells Jones that he is [[HIV]]-positive, and that his girlfriend left him. Wilson also informs Jones that an L.A. mob boss named Lang hired some thugs to kill Jefferson Wolfe, the longtime companion of his son, Tyler Lang. Lang blames Wolfe for giving Tyler the disease, and the fact that Wolfe still appears in good health himself. When that fails (thanks to some timely help from the Falcon), the mob boss hires a supervillain named [[Speedfreek]] to crash the charity concert and kill Lang.
During the assassination attempt, the palms of Jones' hands are badly slashed by Speedfreek, and Wilson receives a bloody chest wound. Rick is afraid to touch Wilson's wound, and after Hulk defeats Speedfreek, it is up to him to rush Wilson to a hospital. Jones and Hulk later secure evidence to send the mob boss to prison.

Wilson is again seen in ''The Incredible Hulk'' #420, in which he is attacked by a mob of bigots that are protesting the fact that a court has ordered an HIV-infected boy to be allowed into a public school. Hulk is able to rescue Wilson from the mob and take him to the hi-tech medical facilities at the Mount, the secret headquarters of the Pantheon, the superhero group in which Hulk is a member at the time. He learns that Wilson actually has full blown [[AIDS]], and has had it for some time. In addition to the broken ribs he sustained in the mob attack, he is suffering from [[pneumocystis carinii pneumonia]], and does not have long to live.  Remembering the blood transfusion that Hulk gave his cousin, Jennifer Walters (aka [[She-Hulk]]), Wilson asks Bruce Banner to give him a transfusion of his blood, knowing that the Hulk's immune system would act as a cure to the virus. Banner initially refuses to take the risk of creating another monster, but eventually pretends to be giving Wilson a blood transfusion.  Wilson reveals in private to Dr. Harr, the attending physician caring for him, that he was not fooled by Bruce's ruse, but played along anyway. 

After Wilson's death, Bruce donates a large sum of money to the hospice that Wilson worked at in order to allow them to comfortably exist for the next few decades.{{Fact|date=April 2008}}  
    
Jim Wilson's father, Gideon Wilson, blames the Hulk for Jim's death and joins [[Gamma Corps]] to seek revenge.{{Fact|date=April 2008}}

Jim Wilson is briefly mentioned in the 2008 film, ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'', where he (portrayed by P.J. Kerr) is shown in a news interview at Culver University.
