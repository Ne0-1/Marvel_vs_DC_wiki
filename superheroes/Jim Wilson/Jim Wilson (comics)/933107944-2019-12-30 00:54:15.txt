'''Jim Wilson''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supporting character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is a supporting character of the [[Hulk]].

==Publication history==
Created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Herb Trimpe]], the character made his first appearance in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' (vol. 2) #131 (September 1970) as an angry young man who befriends the [[Hulk]]. During the late 1970s, he became a regular supporting character of the series, usually appearing as a friend of Bruce Banner.

In ''The Incredible Hulk'' #232 (February 1979), it is revealed that Jim Wilson is the nephew of Sam Wilson, the superhero [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]]. Though this revelation occurred when [[Roger Stern]] was writing the series, Stern says that earlier ''Incredible Hulk'' writer [[Len Wein]] came up with the idea that they were related and simply didn't get around to it during his run.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Buttery|first= Jarrod|date= February 2014|title= Hulk Smash!: The Incredible Hulk in the 1970s|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 70|page= 16|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>

Wilson was dropped from the series by 1980, and did not return until ''The Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 2 #388 (December 1991), in which it is revealed that Wilson was [[HIV]]-positive. He dies of complications from [[AIDS]] in ''The Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 2 #420 (August 1994).

==Fictional character biography==
'''James "Jim" Wilson''' grew up in [[Harlem]] and wanted to travel where he was often at odds with his father Gideon Wilson who worked as a Catholic minister. Wilson enlists [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] to play a benefit concert at a hospice for [[AIDS]] patients. On the drive from the airport, Wilson reveals to Jones that he is [[HIV]]-positive and that his girlfriend left him. Wilson is injured while protecting Jefferson Wolfe from the assassin [[Speedfreek]] at the charity concert. Hulk rushes Wilson to a hospital. Jones and Hulk later secure evidence to send the mob boss who employed Speedfreek to prison.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 2 #388</ref>

Wilson is again seen in ''The Incredible Hulk'' #420 (August 1994), in which he is attacked by a mob protesting the fact that a court has ordered an HIV-infected boy to be allowed into a public school. Hulk is able to rescue Wilson from the mob, and takes him to the hi-tech medical facilities at the Mount, the secret headquarters of the [[Pantheon (Marvel Comics)|Pantheon]], the superhero group which Hulk is a member of. He learns that Wilson actually has AIDS, and has had it for some time. In addition to the broken ribs he sustained in the mob attack, he is suffering from [[pneumocystis carinii pneumonia]] and does not have long to live. Remembering the blood transfusion that the Hulk gave his cousin, Jennifer Walters (which turned her into the [[She-Hulk]]), Wilson asks Bruce Banner to give him a transfusion of his blood, hoping that the Hulk's blood would act as a cure to the virus. Banner initially refuses to take the risk of creating another monster, but eventually pretends to be giving Wilson a blood transfusion. Wilson reveals in private to Dr. Harr, the [[attending physician]] caring for him, that he was not fooled by Bruce's ruse, but played along anyway. Shortly afterward, Jim Wilson succumbs to the disease and dies.

After Wilson's death, Bruce donates a large sum of money to the hospice that Wilson worked at in order to allow them to comfortably exist for the next few decades.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> However, he ultimately admits to himself and the Hulk that he only blamed the Hulk for his son's death in order to avoid facing his own guilt for his failures as a father.{{issue|date=December 2019}}
