The Brain is the name of a [[DC Comics]] supervillain.

==History==
'''The Brain''' is a [[France|French]] mastermind and criminal genius. For an unknown reason, he is a disembodied [[brain]], typically found in a life-support tube, although he occasionally has used robot bodies and once even infiltrated the [[Doom Patrol]] by replacing [[Robotman (DC Comics)|Robotman]]'s brain with his own inside Robotman's robot body (this did not last, as he was too distracted by a romance with his associate, the superintelligent [[gorilla]] [[Monsieur Mallah]], to notice a self-destruct mechanism).

He is the founding member of the [[Brotherhood of Evil]] and is responsible for the operations that gave Monsieur Mallah his genius-level intelligence and [[Madame Rouge]] her evil personality and shapeshifting powers.  He has long been enemies with the [[Teen Titans|Titans]] and the [[Doom Patrol]].

In the [[Teen Titans (animated series)|Teen Titans]] animated series, '''The Brain''', described as "intellect personified and evil incarnate." Considered the leader of the Brotherhood of Evil, he, like his comic counterpart, is a [[brain]] perserved in a robotic jar. It is he who leads the Brotherhood in their attempt to destroy the Titans and their allies. He speaks in a computerized voice similar to [[Steven Hawking]]. It has been speculated that the Brain used his technology to make [[Mad Mod]] young again and [[Warp (comics)|Warp]] old again, thus explaining the continuity error in their appearances in "Homecoming Part Two". His appearance is very similar to a Dalek, the major antagonists from [[Doctor Who]], and indeed the producers mentioned the [[British]] television show in interviews about Season Five. He is voiced by [[Glenn Shadix]].
