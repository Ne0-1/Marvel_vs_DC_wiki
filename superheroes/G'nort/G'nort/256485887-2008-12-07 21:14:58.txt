'''Gnort''' (pronunciation: "nort"<ref>''[[Who's Who in the DC Universe]] (loose-leaf) #16 inside front cover equivalent</ref>)  '''Esplanade G'neesmacher''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]] created by [[Keith Giffen]] and [[J. M. DeMatteis]] during their [[Justice League]] period.<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation | last = Beatty | first = Scott | author-link = Scott Beatty | contribution = G'nort | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 139 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York  | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>

He resembles a [[humanoid]] [[dog]] and is thoroughly incompetent and generally disliked by other heroes; in fact, he is usually portrayed as being a loser and used as [[comic relief]]. He was a member of the [[Justice League Antarctica]].  Despite his comedic appearance, he has become somewhat of a cult favorite among comic book readers.{{Fact|date=November 2008}}

==Character Biography==

[[Hal Jordan]] explains that Gnort became a Green Lantern due to the influence of his relative who was a famous member of the Lantern Corps.<ref name=jli10/> Despite his obviously limited intelligence (not intelligent enough to read a map) and profoundly lacking tactical judgment, the character is consistently depicted as brave, loyal, and honorable. This fact is overlooked by most heroes, although [[Superman]] has pointed it out on occasion.

Early in his career, Gnort becomes inadvertently mixed up with the League's battle against the [[Manhunters (comics)|Manhunter]] planet.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Keith Giffen|Giffen, Keith]] | Cowriters = [[J.

===Working with the League===

Gnort's arch enemy, the [[Scarlet Skier]] (a take-off of [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]]'s [[Silver Surfer]]), is described as being the only felon Gnort ever managed to apprehend in his entire career. Also an idiot, the Skier was mistaken for a pan handling homeless person when travelling in the subway. Both Gnort and the Skier were founding members of [[Justice League Antarctica]], created by [[Maxwell Lord]] for the purpose of keeping both them and the reformed [[Injustice League]] out of his way.

The League, including Gnort, find their Antarctic headquarters overwhelmed by killer penguins. Their enemies are ultimately destroyed, but not before the facillity itself gets demolished. G'Nort keeps himself and his new-found allies alive via his power-ring until help arrives.

Gnort also goes on a mission to rescue [[Mister Miracle]] from the interstellar trader [[Manga Khan]]. Traveling in a spaceship, Gnort works with [[Big Barda]], [[Martian Manhunter]], and Dmitri of the [[Rocket Reds]]. They chase down Khan and survive an assassination attempt by his hired killer [[Lobo (comics)|Lobo]].

Gnort assists the League, this time consisting of Manhunter, [[Crimson Fox]] and [[Ice (comics)|Ice]], when [[Mr. Nebula]], the Skier's old boss, turns his dangerous, cosmic powered attention to [[Earth]]. 

Gnort ses himself as a "Green-Lantern-at-large", not bound to a single [[space sector]]. His most successful mission (apart from capturing the Skier) has been when a gang of humanoid cats who are interstellar bank-robbers surrender as soon as he appears.

===Qward Battle===

Eventually it is discovered that both Gnort and his uncle G'newman were actually given their rings by the Poglachians, who posed as the [[Guardians of the Universe]] while the real Guardians were with the [[Zamarons]]. A race of clowns, the Poglachians gave the rings to beings they thought would use them in amusing ways. They were actually pawns of the Weaponers of [[Qward]], who hoped to discredit the Green Lantern Corps by having the name associated with idiots. Gnort works with [[Guy Gardner]], ending up in Qward itself in ''[[Green Lantern]]'' #12 May '91, though Gnort loses his Qwardian-powered ring. Their confrontations against a Qwardian [[Sinestro]] cult goes badly. Faced with the threat of his beloved uncle being killed, Gnort gives up the location of Hal Jordan.

Soon after, powerless but free from a Qwardian cell, Gnort smells the soldier who took his ring and tracks him down. The soldier swiftly overpowers Gnort and makes the mistake of bragging how he would kill and torture Guy. Enraged, Gnort defeats the soldier, gains his ring and saves Guy. He destroys the source of his very own power and the two make it back to normal space as explosions devastate the local area.  Afterwards, Guy Gardner reluctantly tells the real Guardians that Gnort was the true hero on Qward, which earned Gnort status as a genuine Green Lantern.

===Post-League===

Gnort presumably lost his ring during [[Emerald Twilight]] and subsequently (like many former Lanterns) joined the [[Darkstars]]. He still wears his Darkstar uniform long after the organization collapses, when he is captured by [[Manga Khan]], who attempts to trade him to Maxwell Lord in exchange for [[L-Ron]]. This proves unsuccessful.

Gnort was seen as the sole member of [[Super Buddies]] Antarctica, exactly where Maxwell Lord wants him. He appeared later in the mini-series "Guy Gardner: Collateral Damage," where his homeworld had been destroyed by the [[Rann-Thanagar War]]. The character was portrayed more serious in this story, suffering heavily from the loss of his family. 

As of ''Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps Secret Files & Origins'' #1, Gnort is listed as "presumed dead."

==Alternate versions==
===I Can't Believe It's Not the Justice League===

In the alternate dimension visited by the ''Super Buddies'' in the ''[[Super Buddies#I Can't Believe It's Not the Justice League|I Can't Believe It's Not the Justice League]]'', populated by twisted counterparts of the main universe characters, Gnort is a rampaging flea-infested giant, whose body is used as a battleground.

===Justice League Unlimited===

In the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' comic spin-off Gnort starts his career as a regular Green Lantern Cadet, [[nephew]] of the famous G'Newt but lacking any skills and talents. He is brought to [[Qward]] by [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]] along with other Lanterns to stop [[Sinestro]]'s last plan to destroy Oa by flaring over the planet antimatter bursts.
Despite [[Boodikka]]'s prejudices against a rookie, Gnort is able to hold his own on combat, and uncover G'Newt himself as Sinestro's partner and accomplice. The Guardians, impressed by his courage, grant him the former sector of the deposed G'Newt to patrol.
