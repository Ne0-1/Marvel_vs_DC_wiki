'''G'nort''' (pronunciation: "nort"<ref>''[[Who's Who in the DC Universe]]'' (loose-leaf) #16 inside front cover equivalent</ref>)  '''Esplanade G'neesmacher''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]] created by [[Keith Giffen]] and [[J. M. DeMatteis]] during their [[Justice League]] period.<ref name="dc-ency">{{Cite book | last = Beatty | first = Scott | author-link = Scott Beatty | contribution = G'nort | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 139 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>

He resembles a [[humanoid]] [[dog]] and is thoroughly incompetent and generally disliked by other heroes; in fact, he is usually portrayed as being a loser and used as [[comic relief]]. He was a member of the [[Justice League Antarctica]].  Despite his comedic appearance, he has become somewhat of a cult favorite among comic book readers.{{Fact|date=November 2008}}

==Fictional character biography==

[[Hal Jordan]] explains that G'nort became a Green Lantern due to the influence of his relative who was a famous member of the Lantern Corps.<ref name=jli10/> Despite his obviously limited intelligence (not intelligent enough to read a map) and profoundly lacking tactical judgment, the character is consistently depicted as brave, loyal, and honorable. This fact is overlooked by most heroes, although [[Superman]] has pointed it out on occasion.

Early in his career, G'nort becomes inadvertently mixed up with the League's battle against the [[Manhunters (comics)|Manhunter]] planet.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Keith Giffen|Giffen, Keith]] | Cowriters = [[J.

===Working with the League===

Gnort's arch enemy, the [[Scarlet Skier]] (a take-off of [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]]'s [[Silver Surfer]]), is described as being the only felon G'nort ever managed to apprehend in his entire career. Also an idiot, the Skier was mistaken for a pan handling homeless person when traveling in the subway. Both G'nort and the Skier were founding members of [[Justice League Antarctica]], created by [[Maxwell Lord]] for the purpose of keeping both them and the reformed [[Injustice League]] out of his way.

The League, including G'nort, find their Antarctic headquarters overwhelmed by killer penguins. Their enemies are ultimately destroyed, but not before the facility itself gets demolished. G'Nort keeps himself and his new-found allies alive via his power-ring until help arrives.

G'nort also goes on a mission to rescue [[Mister Miracle]] from the interstellar trader [[Manga Khan]]. Traveling in a spaceship, G'nort works with [[Big Barda]], [[Martian Manhunter]], and Dmitri of the [[Rocket Reds]]. They chase down Khan and survive an assassination attempt by his hired killer [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]].

G'nort assists the League, this time consisting of Manhunter, [[Crimson Fox]] and [[Ice (comics)|Ice]], when [[Mr. Nebula]], the Skier's old boss, turns his dangerous, cosmic powered attention to [[Earth]]. 

G'nort sees himself as a "Green-Lantern-at-large", not bound to a single space sector. His most successful mission (apart from capturing the Skier) has been when a gang of interstellar bank-robbing humanoid cats surrender as soon as he appears.

===Qward battle===

Eventually it is discovered that both G'nort and his uncle G'newman were actually given their rings by the Poglachians, who posed as the [[Guardians of the Universe]] while the real Guardians were with the [[Zamarons]]. A race of clowns, the Poglachians gave the rings to beings they thought would use them in amusing ways. They were actually pawns of the Weaponers of [[Qward]], who hoped to discredit the Green Lantern Corps by having the name associated with idiots. G'nort works with [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]], ending up in Qward itself in ''[[Green Lantern]]'' #12 May '91, though G'nort loses his Qwardian-powered ring. Their confrontations against a Qwardian [[Sinestro]] cult goes badly. Faced with the threat of his beloved uncle being killed, G'nort gives up the location of Hal Jordan.

Soon after, powerless but free from a Qwardian cell, G'nort smells the soldier who took his ring and tracks him down. The soldier swiftly overpowers G'nort and makes the mistake of bragging how he would kill and torture Guy. Enraged, G'nort defeats the soldier, gains his ring and saves Guy by destroying the source of his very own power. The two make it back to normal space as explosions devastate the local area.  Afterwards, Guy Gardner reluctantly tells the real Guardians that G'nort was the true hero on Qward, which earned G'nort status as a genuine Green Lantern.

===Post-League===

G'nort presumably lost his ring during [[Emerald Twilight]] and subsequently (like many former Lanterns) joined the [[Darkstars]]. He still wears his Darkstar uniform long after the organization collapses, when he is captured by [[Manga Khan]], who attempts to trade him to Maxwell Lord in exchange for [[L-Ron]]. This proves unsuccessful.

G'nort was seen as the sole member of [[Super Buddies]] Antarctica, exactly where Maxwell Lord wants him. For a time, G'Nort lives behind Guy Gardner's New York 'Warriors' bar. <ref>Green Lantern 80-Page Giant #1</ref> He appeared later in the mini-series "Guy Gardner: Collateral Damage," where his homeworld had been destroyed by the [[Rann-Thanagar War]]. The character was portrayed more serious in this story, suffering heavily from the loss of his family. 

As of ''Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps Secret Files & Origins'' #1, G'nort is listed as "Presumed Dead." When asked whether G'nort would be making an appearance as a member of the [[Black Lantern Corps]] during ''[[Blackest Night]]'' at [[San Diego Comic-Con International|San Diego Comic Con]] 2009, Geoff Johns replied that the character was not dead and was still considered [[missing in action]].<ref name="ccilive1">[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=22236 CCI LIVE: Green Lantern Blackest Night Panel], [[Comic Book Resources]], July 25 2009</ref>

==Other versions==
===I Can't Believe It's Not the Justice League===
In the alternate dimension visited by the ''Super Buddies'' in the ''[[Super Buddies#I Can't Believe It's Not the Justice League|I Can't Believe It's Not the Justice League]]'', populated by twisted counterparts of the main universe characters, G'nort is a rampaging flea-infested giant, whose body is used as a battleground.

===Justice League Unlimited===
In the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' comic spin-off G'nort starts his career as a regular Green Lantern Cadet, [[nephew]] of the famous G'Newt but lacking any skills and talents. He is brought to [[Qward]] by [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]] along with other Lanterns to stop [[Sinestro]]'s last plan to destroy Oa by flaring over the planet with antimatter bursts.
Despite [[Boodikka]]'s prejudices against a rookie, G'nort is able to hold his own on combat, and uncover G'Newt himself as Sinestro's partner and accomplice. The Guardians, impressed by his courage, grant him the former sector of the deposed G'Newt to patrol.

==In other media==
===Television===
G'nort appears in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "The Eyes of Despero" voiced by [[Alexander Polinsky]]. He, [[Sinestro]], and [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]] work with [[Batman]] to stop [[Despero]]. His backstory is the same as originally presented in the comics, as Sinestro mentions G'nort's uncle had "pushed" him through Lantern training. Though G'nort is initially presented as somewhat incompetent, he proves vital in helping Batman stop the brainwashed [[Mogo]] by draining Mogo's internal Lantern Battery. Despite forgetting the Green Lantern oath necessary to begin the process, he comes through upon consulting the "cheat sheet" written on his arm. After Batman compliments him twice and helps G'nort earn the respect of the Corps, he jumps into his arms to lick him, only to get a reprimand ("No licking.").

G'Nort makes a non-speaking cameo in the episode "Revenge of The Reach!", wherein he is blasted by the mind-controlled [[Blue Beetle (Jaime Reyes)|Blue Beetle]].
