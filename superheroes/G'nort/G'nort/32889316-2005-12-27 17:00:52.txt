'''G'nort''' is a [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]], created by [[Keith Giffen]] and [[J. M. DeMatteis]] during their comedy [[Justice League]] period.

G'nort was a member of the [[Green Lantern Corps]] and later a [[Darkstars |Darkstar]]. He resembles a [[humanoid]] [[dog]] and is throughly incompetent and generally disliked by other heroes; in fact, he is usually portrayed as being a pathetic loser and used as [[comic relief]]. He was a member of the [[Justice League Antarctica]].  Despite his comedic appearance, he has become somewhat of a cult favorite among comic book readers.
