'''G'nort''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]] created by [[Keith Giffen]] and [[J. M. DeMatteis]] during their comedy [[Justice League]] period.

G'nort was a member of the [[Green Lantern Corps]] and later a [[Darkstars|Darkstar]]. He resembles a [[humanoid]] [[dog]] and is thoroughly incompetent and generally disliked by other heroes; in fact, he is usually portrayed as being a pathetic loser and used as [[comic relief]]. He was a member of the [[Justice League Antarctica]].  Despite his comedic appearance, he has become somewhat of a cult favorite among comic book readers. 

==Fictional character biography==

[[Hal Jordan]] explains that G'nort became a Green Lantern due to the influence of his relative who was a famous member of the Lantern Corp. Despite his obviously limited intelligence (not intelligent enough to read a map) and profoundly lacking tactical judgment, the character is consistently depicted as brave, loyal, and honorable. This fact is overlooked by most heroes, although [[Superman]] has pointed it out on occasion.

Early in his career, G'nort becomes inadvertently mixed up with the League's battle against the [[Manhunter (comics)|Manhunter]] planet. 

===Working with the League===

G'nort's arch enemy, the [[Scarlet Skier]] (a take-off of Marvel's Silver Surfer), is described as being the only felon G'nort ever managed to apprehend in his entire career. Also an idiot, the Skier was mistaken for a pan handling homeless person when travelling in the subway. Both G'nort and the Skier were founding members of [[Justice League Antarctica]], created by [[Maxwell Lord]] for the purpose of keeping both them and the reformed [[Injustice League]] out of his way.

The League, including G'Nort, find their Antarctic headquarters overwhelmed by killer penguins. Their enemies are ultimately destroyed, but not before the facillity itself gets demolished. G'Nort keeps himself and his new-found allies alive via his power-ring until help arrives.

G'Nort also goes on a mission to rescue [[Mister Miracle]] from the interstellar trader [[Manga Khan]]. Traveling in a spaceship, G'Nort works with [[Big Barda]], [[Martian Manhunter]], and Dmitri of the [[Rocket Reds]]. They chase down Khan and survive an assassination attempt by his hired killer [[Lobo (comics)|Lobo]].

G'nort assists the League, this time consisting of Manhunter, Crimson Fox and Ice, when [[Mr. Nebula]], the Skier's old boss, turns his dangerous, cosmic powered attention to Earth. 

G'nort ses himself as a "Green-Lantern-at-large", not bound to a single space sector. His most successful mission (apart from capturing the Skier) has been when a gang of humanoid cats who are interstellar bank-robbers surrender as soon as he appears.

===Qward Battle===

Eventually it is discovered that both G'nort and his uncle G'newman were actually given their rings by the Poglachians, who posed as the [[Guardians of the Universe]] while the real Guardians were with the [[Zamarons]]. A race of clowns, the Poglachians gave the rings to beings they thought would use them in amusing ways. They were actually pawns of the Weaponers of [[Qward]], who hoped to discredit the Green Lantern Corps by having the name associated with idiots. G'Nort works with Guy Gardner, ending up in Qward itself in ''[[Green Lantern]]'' #12 May '91, though G'Nort loses his Qwardian-powered ring. Their confrontations against a Qwardian [[Sinestro]] cult goes badly. Faced with the threat of his beloved uncle being killed, G'Nort gives up the location of Hal Jordan.

Soon after, powerless but free from a Qwardian cell, G'Nort smells the soldier who took his ring and tracks him down. The soldier swiftly overpowers G'Nort but makes the mistake of gloating about killing Guy. Enraged, G'nort defeats the soldier, gains his ring and saves Guy. He destroys the source of his very own power and the two make it back to normal space as explosions devastate the local area.

===Post-League===

G'nort presumably lost his ring during [[Emerald Twilight]] and subsequently (like many former Lanterns) joined the [[Darkstars]]. He still wears his Darkstar uniform long after the organization collapses, when he is captured by [[Manga Khan]], who attempts to trade him to Maxwell Lord in exchange for [[L-Ron]]. This proves unsuccessful.

G'nort is last seen as the sole member of [[Super Buddies]] Antarctica, exactly where [[Maxwell Lord]] wants him.
