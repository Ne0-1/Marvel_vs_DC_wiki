==Powers and abilities==

She has superhuman water speed, stamina, and durability. She has the ability to survive underwater for indefinite periods, and specially developed vision which gives her the ability to see clearly in the murky depths of the ocean.

Tamara is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant, and is trained in Atlantean forms of armed and unarmed combat. She speaks English, Atlantean, and Lemurian, and is a highly skilled business executive.
