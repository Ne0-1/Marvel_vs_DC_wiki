'''Tamara Rahn''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]].

Tamara Rahn is an alien of the water-breathing extraterrestrial Banari race from the planet Laab.  She is a red-skinned humanoid with blonde hair.

Tamara stowed away on the spacecraft which brought the males of her race to earth, where all except Tamara were killed by the [[Atlanteans (Marvel Comics)|Atlanteans]], who mistook them for enemies.  The other females of the race apparently perished on their dying home world.

Tamara eventually forgave the Atlanteans and has since become a citizen of [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlantis]] and an ally to [[Namor]].  Tamara has superhuman strength on Earth and can breathe Earth air for short periods.

Tamara was used by the [[Radioactive Man (comics)|Radioactive Man]] to infect At'la'tique with a radiation plague.
