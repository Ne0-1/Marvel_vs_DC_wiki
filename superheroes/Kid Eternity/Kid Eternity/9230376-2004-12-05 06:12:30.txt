'''Kid Eternity''' is a [[comic book]] [[superhero]] originally owned by [[Quality Comics]] and later acquired by [[DC Comics]].

The character was originally a boy who was killed in an accident and brought back to life with the mission of upholding the good in the world.  To that end, the boy gained the power to summon any historical or mythological figure who could be helpful to him.

The character was initially discontinued when DC bought the Quality characters.  He was later used as a supporting character in ''[[Shazam]]'' whose powers were helpful to the [[Marvel Family]].

In the [[1990s]], a very different and far darker version of the character was introduced in the [[Vertigo (comics)|Vertigo]] imprint.  This version learned that he was unwittingly a servant for the supernatural [[Lords of Chaos]] and the figures he summoned were actually [[demon]]s who assumed the form of the figures he desired.

Kid Eternity was killed by the sorcerer Mordru in the opening pages of JSA #1 (1999).  No further exploits have been recorded thus far.
