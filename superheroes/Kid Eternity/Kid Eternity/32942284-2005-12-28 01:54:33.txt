'''Kid Eternity''' is a [[comic book]] [[superhero]] who first premired in ''Hit Comics'' #25, published by [[Quality Comics]] in December, 1942. The character - as well as all of Quality's [[Intellectual Property|Intellectual Properties]] were sold to [[DC Comics]] in 1956.  The character has continued to appear - albeit infrequently - in DC comic books since his revival in the 1970s.

==Kid Eternity at Quality Comics==
''Hit Comics'', prior to issue #25, had a series of rotating cover features, including Hercules, the Red Bee, Stormy Foster and Neon the Unknown. However December 1942 saw the entire line-up of comics at Quality change their features (if not always the cover feature).  Kid Eternity was brought in from the start as the new cover feature for ''Hit''.

The character proved to be popular enough that when Quality Comics began expanding their post-war line, the Kid got his own self-titled comic book, ''Kid Eternity'', in the Spring of 1946.  Further illustrating the popularity of the character, his [[antagonists]], [[Her Highness and Silk]] were given their own series (''Hit Comics'' #29 to ''Hit Comics'' #57).

By the late 1940s, however, Quality Comics was experiencing the post-war bust that most [[superhero]] comics were.  In November 1949, Kid Eternity's self-titled magazine was discontinued (with issue #18) and his lead slot in Hit Comics was given over to Jeb Rivers, a riverboat captain (with issue #61).

===Character Origin and Powers===
The Kid was originally a nameless boy (who only ever remembered being called 'Kid' by his 'Gran'pa') who was killed when a [[U-Boat]] sank his grandfather's fishing boat during [[World War II]]. Due to a supernatural mix-up, however, he was killed seventy-five years too soon (most likely this origin was influenced by the 1941 film [[Here Comes Mr. Jordan]]).  

To rectify the error, the Kid was brought back to life for another seventy-five years with the mission of upholding good in the world. He was given the power to summon any good historical or mythological figure by saying the word [[Eternity]] as well as to use the same word to make himself material or immaterial. Kid Eternity was further assisted on his duties by the clerk who'd made the error, Mr. Keeper.   

===Notable Villains===
*Her Highness and Silk: An elderly woman - complete with glasses and white hair - and her young, attractive assistant.  Thieves and confidence scammers, the characters were humorous in nature, almost never succeeding in their plans but always willing to try another "get rich quick" scheme. (First Appearance: ''Hit Comics'' #27).  Her Highness made a cover appearance in Hit Comics #28.  In the 1982, she and Silk were used a [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] story guest-starring Kid Eternity (''World's Finest'' #282).

*Master Man: Kid Eternity's opposite number, Master Man was given powers similar to the Kids by the [[Devil]].  When Master Man said "Stygia", he could summon any evil historical or mythological figure (First Appearance: ''Kid Eternity'' #16)

==Kid Eternity at DC Comics==
In 1956, [[Everett "Busy" Arnold]], the owner of Quality Comics decided to leave the comic business entirely for the more profitable arena of [[Men's adventure|Men's Adventure Magazines]].  He sold the Quality Comics line to his competetor, DC Comics.  DC kept a number of Quality's titles running, but it wasn't until the 1970s that they went back to look at the long cancelled superhero characters (with the introduction of the [[Freedom Fighters (comics)| Freedom Fighters]])

In the early 1970s, DC had licensed the rights to the [[Marvel Family]] from [[Fawcett Comics]]. When it was decided to revive Kid Eternity, they [[retcon|retconned]] a name in for the previously nameless Kid - Christopher "Kit" Freeman.  Further it was revealed the Kid was the brother of [[Captain Marvel, Jr.]] (Freddy Freeman), with both living on [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Earth-S]].  Kid Eternity became a supporting character in ''Shazam!'' stories, and there was even a return visit from Her Highness and Silk.

==Kid Eternity's Modern Incarnation==
In the 1990s, a different and darker version of the character was introduced. This was done with a three-issue mini-series written by [[Grant Morrison]] with art by [[Duncan Fegredo]] in 1991. This version returned the Kid to his nameless roots and severed ties with the Marvel Family but made significant changes to the character's back story.  

When DC began their mature-readers [[Vertigo (comics)|Vertigo]] imprint, they went back to Kid Eternity, with a new series written by [[Ann Nocenti]] with art by [[Sean Phillips]].  This series quickly moved away from the continuity established by Morrison, and instead focused on the everyman qualities of the character.  It lasted 16 issues (May 1993 - September 1994)

===Kid Eternity's Revised Origin===
The boat captain the Kid referred to as his grandfather was actually a sexual-predator who'd picked up the young orphaned boy for his own purposes.  The fishing ship they were on was destroyed by a U-Boat and the Kid was killed.  The Kid arrived at a fake heaven created by the the supernatural [[Lords of Chaos and Order|Lords of Chaos]], who made the Kid their unwittingly servant by putting on a show that he'd been killed too early and they'd return him to life for the error.  

The Kid was given the power to summon people by saying "Eternity", but these people he summoned were actually [[demon|demons]] who assumed the form of the figures he desired. He could choose any person or fictional character, without regard to "good" or "evil" to bring back.  The Lords of Chaos gave the Kid a guide, a minor lord of chaos called "Mr. Keeper".  Mr. Keeper - who assumed the form of a pudgy, overweight human, was to guide the kid in setting up and turning on a series of "Chaos Engines", which was part of a plot by the Lords of Chaos to earn their way back into [[heaven]] by forcing the evolution of mankind, a deed for which they felt [[God]] would forgive their past transgressions.

==Kid Eternity's Current Status==
Kid Eternity was "killed" by the sorcerer [[Mordru]] in the opening pages of ''[[Justice Society of America|JSA]]'' #1 (1999). He later appeared in ''JSA'' #48 as either a spirit within [[Doctor Fate]]'s amulet or a hallucination (the story is unclear on this point).  No further exploits have been recorded [[as of 2005]].

==Trivia==
Kid Eternity may have caused the very first [[fictional crossover]] in comics, since in his second appearance (''Hit Comics'' #26) he used his power to summon fellow Quality Comics character [[Blackhawk (comics)|Blackhawk]].
