'''Cyclone''' (alias Maxine Hunkel) is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[superhero|superheroine]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC universe|universe]]. She is the granddaughter of the original [[Red Tornado (Ma Hunkel)|Red Tornado]] and a member of the [[Justice Society of America]].

==Creation==
Although not named as such at the time, the character who would eventually become known as Maxine Hunkel first appeared in ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'' #2 (1996) by [[Mark Waid]] and [[Alex Ross]]. In this possible future, she is presented as the latest version of the [[Red Tornado]]. A stunning [[redhead]] with the power of wind manipulation, she is little more than a background character in the story, filling out the ranks of the new [[Justice League of America|Justice League]]. Though little is revealed about her history, she appears to have some connection to the previous Red Tornadoes.

Some years later, prior to the relaunch of the ''Justice Society of America'' series, writer [[Geoff Johns]] created Maxine Hunkel, a heroine who would follow the legacy of the Red Tornado. Remembering the character he designed for ''Kingdom Come'', cover artist [[Alex Ross]] based his design for Maxine on the earlier character, retroactively making them one and the same. Maxine made her debut in the mainstream DC Universe in ''Justice Society of America'' #1 (December 2006).

DC Comics solicitations for the upcoming ''Justice Society of America'' #3 confirm that Maxine will eventually take the codename '''Cyclone''',[http://www.dccomics.com/comics/?cm=6810] to honor her grandmother as well as her aunt and uncle, who once operated as the Red Tornado's [[sidekick]]s the [[Cyclone Kids]].

==Fictional character history==

Maxine Hunkel is the granddaughter of the original Red Tornado, Abigail "Ma" Hunkel, an honorary member of the Justice Society and current caretaker of their headquarters. Maxine grew up idolizing her grandmother's allies in the JSA.

As a young girl, Maxine was once kidnapped by [[T.O. Morrow]], the [[mad scientist]] who created the second [[Red Tornado (android)|Red Tornado]], a powerful [[android]]. The specific details of the kidnapping are unknown.

Cheerful, bubbly, and extremely intelligent, Maxine excels in school (4.0 GPA and a 1300 SAT score). Now 19, Maxine is a student at [[Harvard University]] and an avid fan of [[musical theatre]]. However, her talkative nature and know-it-all personality often alienate her peers and leave the young woman isolated.  Her outcast status causes her to suffer from atypical [[depression]].

In recent months, she has begun to manifest unusual superhuman abilities. A sneeze demolished her grandmother's garage and, the next day, she awoke inside a [[tornado]] five hundred feet off the ground. The young woman soon realized that she has the power to manipulate wind.

When the Justice Society decides to expand its ranks and provide training to new heroes, Maxine is one of the first recruits on their list. She is invited to join the team by [[Power Girl]] and [[Mister Terrific (Michael Holt)|Mr. Terrific]] and accepts through extreme amounts of excitement (her motormouth response nearly causes them to revoke the offer). Shortly afterwards, she is introduced to the rest of the JSA and her fangirl personality becomes evident in her bubbling reaction to meeting her heroes, particularly fellow teen [[Stargirl]].

==Powers and abilities==
Maxine possesses the power of wind manipulation. She is able to mentally summon [[cyclone]]s and [[whirlwind]]s, project powerful bursts of air, and glide through the air on wind currents. The full extent and origin of her abilities are not known at this time.
