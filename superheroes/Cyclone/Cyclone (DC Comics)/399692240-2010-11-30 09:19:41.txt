'''Cyclone''' ('''Maxine Hunkel''') is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]], a [[comic book]] [[superhero]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC universe|universe]]. She is the granddaughter of the original [[Red Tornado (Ma Hunkel)|Red Tornado]] and a member of the [[Justice Society of America]]. Cyclone was created by [[Mark Waid]], [[Alex Ross]], [[Geoff Johns]] and [[Dale Eaglesham]].

==Publication history==
[[Image:RedTornadoKC.jpg|left|thumb|100px|Red Tornado III in ''Kingdom Come #2''.]]
Although not named as such at the time, the character who would eventually become known as Maxine Hunkel first appeared (as a new Red Tornado) in ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'' #2 (1996) by Mark Waid and Alex Ross. 

A decade later, prior to the relaunch of the ''Justice Society of America'' series, writer Geoff Johns created Maxine Hunkel, a hero who would follow the legacy of the Red Tornado. Remembering the character he designed for ''Kingdom Come'', cover artist Alex Ross based his design for Maxine on the earlier character, retroactively making them one and the same.

Johns is quoted by Newsarama.com:<ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=91761 HIGH SOCIETY II: THE JUSTICE SOCIETY'S NEW BLOOD] by Troy Brownfield, Newsarama.com, retrieved March 1, 2007</ref>

{{cquote|''I came up with the character and concept [of Maxine]. When I told Alex, he told me about this character that he’d put into Kingdom Come, and discussed Maxine being the ‘younger’ version of that one.''}}

Maxine made her debut in the DC Universe in ''Justice Society of America'' #1 (December 2006).

==Fictional character biography==
Maxine Hunkel is the granddaughter of the original Red Tornado, Abigail "Ma" Hunkel, an honorary member of the Justice Society and current caretaker of their headquarters. Maxine grew up idolizing her grandmother's allies in the JSA.

As a 6-year old, Maxine was once kidnapped by [[T.O. Morrow]], the [[mad scientist]] who created the second [[Red Tornado]], a powerful [[Android (robot)|android]].  Morrow infects Maxine with "nanobytes" that are the apparent source of her powers.

Cheerful, bubbly, and extremely intelligent (4.0 GPA and a 1300 SAT score in high school), Maxine is a 19-year-old student at [[Harvard University]] and an avid fan of the works of [[L. Frank Baum]], particularly [[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|The Wizard of Oz]], and linked works such as the musical ''[[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]]''. However, her talkative nature and know-it-all personality often alienates her peers and leave the young woman isolated.  Her outcast status causes her to suffer from atypical [[Depression (mood)|depression]].

In recent months, she has begun to manifest unusual superhuman abilities. A sneeze demolishes her grandmother's garage and, the next day, she awoke inside a [[tornado]] five hundred feet off the ground. The young woman soon realizes that she has the power to manipulate wind.

When the Justice Society decides to expand its ranks and provide training to new heroes, Maxine is one of the first on their list. She is invited to join the team by [[Power Girl]] and [[Mister Terrific (Michael Holt)|Mr. Terrific]] and accepts through extreme amounts of excitement (her motormouth response nearly causes them to revoke the offer). Shortly afterwards, she is introduced to the rest of the JSA and her fangirl personality becomes evident in her bubbling reaction to meeting her heroes, particularly fellow teen [[Courtney Whitmore (comics)|Stargirl]]. During the first meeting of the group, the current holder of the [[Mister America (DC Comics)|Mr. America]] literally falls into their midst and perishes. As a way to help her deal, fellow member Stargirl distracts her into building a superhero outfit.

Maxine officially debuts as Cyclone in ''Justice Society of America'' #3, honoring both the Red Tornado and her former sidekicks, the Cyclone Kids (Maxine's aunt and uncle). During this time, she also gains a pet monkey named "Frankie", whom she dresses up to look like on of the winged monkeys from [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]] (she also wears a green pointed hat from time to time, causing her to resemble both the [[Enchantress]] (who wore an identical hat) and the [[Wicked Witch of the West]]). She undergoes a brief crush on teammate [[Damage (comics) |Damage]] when he is made incredibly handsome temporarily, and slowly starts learning to become less of a motormouth.

Maxine is seen as part of the superhero army drafted by [[Alan Scott]] to defend various Earth interests from the conquering forces of [[Darkseid]]. <ref>"Final Crisis" 1-5 (2008)</ref>

After the JSA suffers a massive supervillain attack, the team divides into two. Cyclone joins the newly-formed '''JSA All-Stars''' team, and soon after finds her becoming attracted to her teammate [[King Chimera]].<ref>''JSA All-Stars''#1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
*Maxine possesses the power of wind manipulation. She is able to mentally summon [[cyclone]]s and [[whirlwind]]s, project powerful bursts of air, and fly through the air by riding [[wind current]]s.
*Recently, Maxine has unveiled that she can control sound currents as well, gathering and sending sound waves.

==Other versions==
*An alternate-reality version of Cyclone is seen in the [[Trinity (comic book)|Trinity]] series, as a member of the time-altered Justice Society International. She is killed in that timeline when she is sniped down while riding one of her cyclones.
