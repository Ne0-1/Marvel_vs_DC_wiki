'''Cyclone''' is a [[comic strip]] character capable of manipulating the [[wind]].

== The Golden Age Cyclones ==
The first Cyclone was a character published by Quality in National Comics #1. Founded by printer [[Everett M.Arnold]] in [[1939]], [[Quality Comics]] published a large number of titles during the [[1940s]]. Arnold launched the company with [[Feature Funnies]], which he had bought from another company, but this was soon joined by several additional titles, becoming one of the more prominent wartime comics groups. 
A second character with the same name was published by [[Nita Publications]], in Whirlwind #1, June [[1940]].

==Marvel's Cyclone==

===Cyclone I===
The first time Marvel used a character with the name Cyclone was in Amazing Spider-Man #143 published April 1975.
'''Background''' 
Formerly an [[engineer]] for [[NATO]], Cyclone had a falling out with his former employees, supposedly related to political decisions over implementing his research, based on the development of a wind-generating weapon.
Cyclone took his invention and used it for his own criminal ends, developing his Cyclone costume and other weapons.

Like many criminal masterminds in [[Spider-Man]] comics, he decided to form a gang and capture [[J. Jonah Jameson]], the owner of the Daily Bugle. Like so many criminal masterminds who follow this plan, he was defeated by Spider-Man.

He was subsequently employed by the Maggia, and was doing relatively well for himself (in spite of a subsequent defeat at the hands of Spider-Man), when he was in the wrong place at the wrong time, and met his death at the hands of [[Scourge of the Underworld|Scourge]].
