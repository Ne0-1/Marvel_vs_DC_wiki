==Fictional character biography==
===Alpha Squadron===
Born in Hawaii, '''Alani Ryan''' quickly developed a talent for surfing. She is a student at the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]], and has adopted the codename, Loa (named for a type of worm, which moves the same way she does when she uses her powers), and along with her fellow students, [[Anole (comics)|Anole]], [[Rubbermaid (comics)|Rubbermaid]], [[Kidogo]], [[Network (comics)|Network]], and [[Indra (comics)|Indra]], was assigned to [[Alpha Squadron (comics)|Alpha Squadron]], the training squad advised by former [[Alpha Flight]] member, [[Northstar]].   When Northstar was apparently killed by Wolverine, advising duties for Alpha Squadron were taken over by [[Karma (comics)|Karma]]. Of her classes at the Institute, she dislikes Chemistry the most and was voted "Most Laid Back" in the ''New X-Men: Academy X: Yearbook Special''.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

===Post M-Day===
After the [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]], Alani was one of the 27 students to retain her powers. She was also one of the students [[Emma Frost]] placed in the fateful all-out brawl that would determine who would become the new X-Men trainees, but lost. Before the fight, she was seen threatening to "crumble" Anole's tongue if he touched her with it. Despite this, Loa is close friends with Anole, as well as Rockslide.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

She is seen as one of the students listening to [[Blindfold (comics)|Blindfold]]'s tale about [[Magik (comics)|Illyana Rasputin]] and is sucked down into [[Otherplace|Limbo]] along with many of the other students. After the students land on a rocky outcrop, they are soon attacked by a huge number of demons, and Loa is, for the first time, shown using her powers. A demon attempts to punch her in the stomach, and his hand goes straight through, but is sliced to ribbons on the other side. She then moves to protect [[Anole (comics)|Anole]] as [[Magik (comics)|Magik]] decides she needs to take one of their souls to make a new [[Soulsword]]. When Magik goes to confront Pixie, Alani jumps to attack her, but Magik blasts her to the ground with her powers.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

She participated in the final fight against [[Belasco]], survived, returned to the school with the rest of the students.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

In the aftermath of Quest for Magik, and overcome with stress, Loa has shown an interest in Elixir and successfully initiates a physical relationship with [[Elixir (comics)|Elixir]].{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

===Manifest Destiny===
Alani relocated to [[San Francisco]] along with other former students.<ref>''X-Men: Manifest Destiny #2</ref> She is later seen trying to help cheer up Colossus who is still trying to come to terms with his loss of Shadowcat.<ref>''X-Men: Manifest Destiny #3</ref>  It's been confirmed in [[X-Force]] that she and Elixir are still romantically involved as well.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

Loa, along with fellow students [[Mercury (Marvel Comics)|Mercury]] and [[Onyxx (comics)|Onyxx]], was tasked with keeping peace at the riots on [[Telegraph Hill, San Francisco|Telegraph Hill]] after the mutant-hate group "Humanity Now!" marched from [[Sacramento]] to San Francisco to promote "Proposition X," displeasing many citizens of San Francisco, mutant and non-mutant alike.<ref>''Dark Avengers / Uncanny X-Men: Utopia #1''</ref>

===Nation X===
Whilst living on the island of Utopia, Magneto accompanies Anole, Loa and Rockslide as they search for Mercury, who claim has been captured by a ghost in the tunnels. They find Mercury, and Magneto deals with the ghost - a hologram recording of himself when he was younger.{{Issue|date=December 2010}} Loa is also a victim of the Stepford Cuckoos boredom as they trap her in a psychic illusion where she is hanging on to an edge of a cliff, where her fingers are 'tap danced' on until she plunges off a cliff into the churning waters of the cold pacific.{{Issue|date=December 2010}}

Later Loa teams up with Match and Rockside to steal some food from Warpath, who is on guard duty. After Warpath takes out Rockslide and Match, Loa puts him in his place by declaring ‘I came here for ice cream. I’ll leave when I get it’ as well as threatening to desolve Warpath's chest. Warpath realizes she isn't bluffing until Rockslide points out Warpath has been sneaking food as he had food in his mouth throughout the whole ordeal.{{Issue|date=December 2010}}

===Necrosha===
During the attack of Selene's undead force on Utopia, Alani was attacked by the reanimated Cortez, Mellencamp, and Delgado. She was saved by Deadpool who heard her screams and was actually in her room playing with her toys and reading her diary (which he denied). Discovering that the former Acolytes would reform after any injury, Deadpool spent 20 minutes "subduing them with lethal force" until he ran out of bullets. Finally, he was about to be eviscerated by Mellencamp, when Loa intervened and disintegrated the reanimated mutant. Finding that Mellencamp did not reform after Loa killed him, Deadpool picked her up and threw her at the remaining Acolytes, forcing her to use her powers on them.<ref>''X-Force vol. 3 Annual'' #1 </ref>

===Collision===
Loa joins Rogue, Magneto, Indra and Anole  on a trip to Mumbai due to Indra's family summoning him home. The group, minus Indra, venture into the city to see the sites. While roaming the streets the group experience a bizarre storm which causes lightning to bombard the city. Loa appears unharmed and the group encounter a strange girl called Luisa, who appears out of nowhere. The group is then attacked by three Sentinels.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #238</ref> Loa takes down a Sentinel on her own by phasing through it's head, something which impresses Rogue who says how proud of Alani she is. When they return to Indra's home, Indra reveals to them that he is to be married against his will. Loa and Anole try to talk him out of it, although it does not seem to change his mind as he plans to go through with the marriage.  
 
But before the marriage can happen, the Children of the Vault attack with the intention of reclaiming their "sister" Luisa, who reveals her name is actually Luz and they make quick work of Loa, Anole, Indra, Magneto and Rogue. After kidnapping Magneto, Rogue and Luz back to their city, Quitado, Indra, Anole and Loa are determined to rescue them. However Indra's father refuses to allow his son to leave before he is to be married. Indra then decides to marry Vaipala first that afternoon so they may rescue their teachers.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #239</ref>

As the wedding goes on it's revealed that Vaipala and Luz switched places and that the Children of the Vault have Vaipala instead.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #240</ref> Loa threatens Luz for information on the way to Quitado and after forming a plan, they sneak into the city. After rescuing Rogue, Magneto and Vaipala, Loa and Magneto work together in sending Quitado back to the reality where it came from.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #241</ref>

===The Curse of the Mutants===
Loa accompanies Emma Frost underwater to present Namor with data from Dr. Nemesis about the Atlantean vampires, the Aqueos. During the trip she reveals she would not only like to see New Atlantis for herself but she is well educated in Atlantean history and culture.{{Issue|date=December 2010}}  
  
During the final assault on the Aqueos city, Loa shows up with Logomancer as backup. They arrive with a spell that weakens the Aqueos but during the process an Aqueos breaks her diving helmet. A pendent she is wearing begins to glow, giving Loa the ability to breathe underwater. Loa then begins to proceed in destroying several of the Aqueos.{{Issue|date=December 2010}}

==Powers and abilities==
[[Image:Loapower.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Loa demonstrates her power]] 
Loa possesses a [[molecule|molecular]] distortion power that allows her to move through solid [[matter]] by disabling binding forces. This causes the matter to crumble, or break down around as she passes through it. It is unknown if the markings on her body are part of her mutant nature, or man-made tattooing.

Loa is very reluctant to use her powers unless absolutely necessary. This stems from the destructive nature of her powers and past experiences.<ref>''X-Force v3 Annual #1</ref>

Despite having very little field experience and never being sent on any X-Men missions. Loa has proven herself capable in battle, surviving the Purifiers assault on the Xavier Institute, defending herself against demons when sucked into Limbo, combating the reanimated dead during Necrosha alongside Deadpool during the attack on Utopia, holding her own against nimrod sentinels, and single-handedly defeating a full sized sentinel in combat.
