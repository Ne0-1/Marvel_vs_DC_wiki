==Character Biography==

Born in Hawaii, '''Alani Ryan''' quickly developed a talent for surfing.  When Ryan began to experience bigotry because of her newly-emerged mutant abilities, she was sent to enroll at the [[Xavier Institute]].  Once there, she adopted the codename, Loa, and along with her fellow students, [[Anole (comics)|Anole]], [[Rubbermaid (comics)|Rubbermaid]], [[Kidogo]], [[Network (comics)|Network]], and [[Indra (comics)|Indra]], was assigned to [[Alpha Squadron (comics) |Alpha Squadron]], the training squad advised by former [[Alpha Flight]] member, [[Northstar]].   When Northstar was apparently killed by Wolverine, advising duties for Alpha Squadron were taken over by [[Karma (comics)|Karma]].  After the [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]], she was one of the students [[Emma Frost]] placed in the fateful all-out brawl that would determine who would become the new X-Men trainees, but lost.  Recently, Anole encountered--and was subsequently beaten by--a mind-controlled Northstar, raiding the Institute.  It is unknown of Loa or Indra know their former mentor is alive.

==Powers==

Loa possesses a [[molecule|molecular]] distortion power that allows her to move through solid [[matter]] by disabling binding forces. This causes the matter to crumble, or break down around as she passes through it.
