'''Loa''' ('''Alani Ryan''') is a [[fictional character]] found in the [[Marvel Universe]].  A [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]], Loa is a student at the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]].  She made her debut in ''New X-Men: Academy X #5''.

==Fictional character biography==
===Alpha Squadron===
Born in Hawaii, '''Alani Ryan''' quickly developed a talent for surfing. She is a student at the at the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]], and has adopted the codename, Loa (named for a type of worm, which moves the same way she does when she uses her powers), and along with her fellow students, [[Anole (comics)|Anole]], [[Rubbermaid (comics)|Rubbermaid]], [[Kidogo]], [[Network (comics)|Network]], and [[Indra (comics)|Indra]], was assigned to [[Alpha Squadron (comics) |Alpha Squadron]], the training squad advised by former [[Alpha Flight]] member, [[Northstar]].   When Northstar was apparently killed by Wolverine, advising duties for Alpha Squadron were taken over by [[Karma (comics)|Karma]].  Of her classes at the Institute, she dislikes Chemistry the most and was voted "Most Laid Back" in the ''New X-Men: Academy X: Yearbook Special''.

===Post M-Day===
After the [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]], Alani was one of the 27 students to retain her powers.  She was also one of the students [[Emma Frost]] placed in the fateful all-out brawl that would determine who would become the new X-Men trainees, but lost. Before the fight, she was seen threatening to "crumble" Anole's tongue if he touched her with it. Despite this, Loa is close friends with Anole, as well as Rockslide. Recently, Anole encountered--and was subsequently beaten by--a mind-controlled Northstar, raiding the Institute.  It is unknown if Loa or Indra know their former mentor is alive.

===Quest for Magik===
She is seen as one of the students listening to [[Blindfold (comics)|Blindfold]]'s tale about [[Magik (comics)|Illyana Rasputin]] and is sucked down into [[Otherplace|Limbo]] along with many of the other students. After the students land on a rocky outcrop, they are soon attacked by a huge number of demons, and Loa is, for the first time, shown using her powers. A demon attempts to punch her in the stomach, and his hand goes straight through, but is sliced to ribbons on the other side. She then moves to protect [[Anole (comics)|Anole]] as [[Magik (comics)|Magik]] decides she needs to take one of their souls to make a new [[Soulsword]]. When Magik goes to confront Pixie, Alani jumps to attack her, but Magik blasts her to the ground with her powers.

She participated in the final fight against [[Belasco]], survived, and is now back at the school with the rest of the students.

===Children of X-Men===
In the aftermath of Quest for Magik, and overcome with stress, Loa has shown an interest in Elixir and successfully initiates a physical relationship with [[Elixir (comics)|Elixir]].

===Manifest Destiny===
Alani relocated to San Francisco along with other former students.<ref>''X-Men: Manifest Destiny #2</ref> She is later seen trying to help cheer up Colossus who is still trying to come to terms with his loss of Shadowcat.<ref>''X-Men: Manifest Destiny #3</ref>  It's been confirmed in [[X-Force]] that she and Elixir are still romantically involved as well.

==Powers and abilities==
[[Image:Loapower.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Loa demonstrates her power]] 
Loa possesses a [[molecule|molecular]] distortion power that allows her to move through solid [[matter]] by disabling binding forces. This causes the matter to crumble, or break down around as she passes through it.  It is unknown if the markings on her body are part of her mutant nature, or man-made tattooing, but given her age the former is more likely.
