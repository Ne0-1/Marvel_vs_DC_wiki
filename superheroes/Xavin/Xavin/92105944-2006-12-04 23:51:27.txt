'''Xavin''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[comic book]] series ''[[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]]''. Xavin is a [[Skrull]] who is training to become a [[Super-Skrull]].

==Character History==
Xavin journeys to Earth to find [[Karolina Dean]], whos parents betrothed her to him, assuming that Xavin and his parents would perish while fighting the Majesdanians, their alien race. Xavin encounters Dean shortly after her romantic advances are rejected by her friend [[Nico Minoru]]. Xavin, trying to convince Karolina to be his bride and return to unify their homeworlds, fights and pursues her runaway friends.  Xavin finally tells Dean that he won't force her to marry him, but he hopes that she will come with him to witness the animosity between their two races. He says that if their marriage might end the war between the Skrulls and the Majesdanians. Dean reveals that she is not attracted to men and doesn't want to live a lie, but Xavin alters his form to that of a human woman and persuades her to leave with him.

During the wedding ceremony, a fight breaks out between the two races, and Xavin and Karolina barely escape before the planet is destroyed. They return to Earth, where they help Dean's friends rescue their friend [[Molly Hayes]] from the new [[Pride (comics)|Pride]]. Xavin impersonates Minoru and takes a bullet for her, distracting [[Geoffrey Wilder]] long enough for Minoru to untie Hayes.

Xavin joins the group but has trouble adjusting to his new surroundings and getting along with his new teammates, particularly Victor, whom he often offends with condescending remarks about robots. Although he is aggressive and headstrong, Xavin is motivated to protect his new home by his love for Karolina. Though he spends much of his "down time" in female form, Xavin usually reverts to his male Skrull form when in battle, and spends some time in his male human form as well.

In ''[[Civil War: Young Avengers/Runaways]]'', [[Noh-Varr]], a Kree from an alternate reality, breaks Xavin's neck, and the Skrull is presumed dead. Xavin later rights his broken neck and attacks his captor, escaping the Cube prison facility with Karolina, Wiccan and Hulkling.

==Powers==
Xavin, being a Skrull, has the species' natural ability to shape-shift. Xavin was also a member of a [[Super-Skrull]]-training program to create a new generation of Skrull warriors. As such, Xavin has several other powers, including those of the [[Fantastic Four]]: [[elasticity|stretching]], super-strength, resistance, [[invisibility]], energy shield creation, fire manipulation, and self-immolation. He is only able to control one power at a time.
