==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
Jonas Greymalkin was the only child born to Charles and Marcia Greymalkin. His family lived on the land where the Xavier Institute would eventually be built. He was 16 years old when Jonas realized he was gay. His father caught him in the barn with another boy; calling him an abomination, his father beat him unconscious and cursed him and his mother's womb for bearing him. Later that evening, Jonas came to but his father was so consumed with disgust he buried Jonas alive. It was then his powers activated and he was placed in a state of suspended animation where he remained for 200 years.<ref>''X-Men: Manifest Destiny #3''</ref>

===Divided We Stand===
After the events of Messiah Complex, Jonas woke up after what he describes as: ''Some manner of apocalypse decimated the area, upsetting the very structure of the earth and unsettling me from my confinement.''<ref>''X-Men: Manifest Destiny #3''</ref>

He is first seen in [[Blindfold (comics)|Blindfold's]] vision, helping her while the other Young X-Men battle [[Donald Pierce]].<ref>''Young X-Men #1''</ref>

He is then seen from the shadows, watching the Young X-Men leave to confront Sunspots Brotherhood of Mutants.<ref>''Young X-Men #2''</ref> After Blindfold is captured, Greymalkin decides he must rescue her, kill the Cyclops and makes unexplained references to [[Cypher (comics)|Cypher]] while rambling to himself.<ref>''Young X-Men #3''</ref> He later confronts Cyclops and reveals not only his mutant powers—super-strength when in darkness—but that Cyclops is actually [[Donald Pierce]] in disguise.<ref>''Young X-Men #3''</ref>  Later, despite her defeating Pierce, Greymalkin is distrusting of [[Magma (comics)|Magma]] who earlier used her powers to solidify an attacking [[Dust (comics)|Dust]] into glass. She later convinces him to trust her by transforming Sooraya back to her normal form. He demonstrates an antiquated understanding of mutant abilities, calling Magma a witch and referring to her powers as "witchcraft". Later Magma gives him a uniform which he finds unusual and they go confront Donald Pierce. Ruths vision also comes to pass.<ref>''Young X-Men #5''</ref>

Greymalkin is very protective of the Young X-Men, though they are for the most part originally unaware of his existence.

===Manifest Destiny===
After the team dealt with Pierce, [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] announced that an analysis of Greymalkin's DNA revealed he is not only a mutant, but a member of Charles Xavier's family—from about 200 years in the past.<ref>''Young X-Men #6''</ref> Emma Frost explains some terms used in the X-Men, like telepathy. She asks Greymalkin if she has permission to look in his mind, that permission being emphatically refused.<ref>''Young X-Men #7''</ref> Whether this indicates a desire to withhold information or simple distrust of 'witchcraft' is unclear.<ref>''Young X-Men'' #5</ref>

He is later seen talking with Anole, another young gay mutant about his past. Meanwhile, through tests, Beast discovers that Jonas' powers activated when he was buried alive, which also extended his lifespan, but wonders what led to his premature burial, unaware of Jonas' homosexuality.<ref>''X-Men: Manifest Destiny'' #3</ref>

===Secret Invasion===
Greymalkin is seen fighting alongside the other X-Men in San Francisco during the Skrull invasion.<ref>''Secret Invasion: X-Men'' #3</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Greymalkin has a number of abilities that wax and wane with exposure to light. His powers appear to strengthen with a lack of light, and he is weaker with exposure to light, though he is not powerless. Beast discovered Jonas' powers activated when he was buried alive and he went into suspended animation for over 200 years. He also refers to a lot of modern technology such as the Danger cave and Magma's powers as devilry or witchcraft.

His primary ability is super-strength, which is made clear by the way he attacks Donald Pierce (in the guise of Cyclops). He also has a fair amount of agility, able to maneuver around rubble and dodge one of Cyclops' optic blasts, both with incredible ease. In addition to these abilities, he also possesses night vision, allowing him to see in total darkness. Beast lists invulnerability as an additional ability, this allowing him to survive the pressure and cold extremes of being buried alive.
