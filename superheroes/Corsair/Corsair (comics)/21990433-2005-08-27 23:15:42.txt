==History==

Summers, his wife Katherine Anne, and two sons Scott and Alex, lived in [[Alaska]].  One day Summers was taking the family for a flight in their [[airplane]], when it came under attack by an alien [[Shi'ar]] spaceship.  As the plane went down in flames, Summers strapped the boys into a [[parachute]] and ejected them from the plane.  Before the plane crashed, Summers and his wife were captured by the spaceship and taken away from Earth.

Summers was sent to the slave mines, the Shi'ar Emperor D'Ken was smitten with his wife, and held her in his personal court.  She was later killed in front of Summers' eyes by D'Ken, for the Emperor's own amusement.  Summers eventually escaped the mines and hooked up with a group of aliens rebelling against the Shi'ar.  The group formed the [[Starjammers]], a constant thorn in D'ken's side, and Summers took the name Corsair.

Years later, Corsair and the Starjammers met his son Scott, now the superhero [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and leader of the [[X-Men]], in the final battle against D'ken.  Though at first ignorant of each other's identities, they eventually learned the truth and were reconciled.  While Corsair has visited earth several times since, he now considers his life in the stars with the Starjammers to be his home, and has remained there.
