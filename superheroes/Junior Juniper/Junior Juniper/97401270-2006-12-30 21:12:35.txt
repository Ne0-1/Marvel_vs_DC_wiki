'''Jonathan "Junior" Juniper''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe. His first appearance was in ''Sgt. Fury and the Howling Commandos vol. 1 #1''.

==History==
'''Jonathon "Junior" Juniper''' was a founding member of the original [[Howling Commandos]] and fought alongside the team during [[World War II]].  He was the youngest on the team as he was still attending an unnamed [[Ivy League]] college before he enlisted in the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]].  Juniper was later transferred from the Air Force to the Commandos because he had flown [[B-17]] in bombing raids as a tail gunner.  He was the grand-uncle of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent, [[Roger Juniper]].  In Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos #1 he was killed.
