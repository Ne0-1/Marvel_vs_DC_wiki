'''Ch'p''' is a member of the [[Green Lantern Corps]] in the {{DC Universe}}. Like all H'lvenites, he resembled a somewhat [[anthropomorphic]] combination between a [[squirrel]] and a [[chipmunk]].<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation  | last = Wallace | first = Dan | author-link = | contribution = Ch'p | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 81  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = New York  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref> He was created by [[Paul Kupperberg]] and [[Don Newton]].<ref>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 2) #184</ref>
==Fictional character biography==
Ch'p's early history was recounted in ''[[Green Lantern Corps]]'' #203. A native of the planet [[H'lven]], he participated in the defense of his homeworld from an invasion by the Crabster army of [[Doctor Ub'x]]. He was captured and sentenced to death, but one of the [[Guardians of the Universe]] came secretly to induct him into the Corps with the power ring of his predecessor who fell attempting to stop the invasion. Using the ring, Ch'p was able to defeat Doctor Ub'x and free his homeworld. Shortly afterward<ref>''Green Lantern'' (current series<!--Current? Please clarify-->) #31</ref> he travelled to [[Oa]] where he was instructed by [[Kilowog]] in the same group of recruits as [[Hal Jordan]]. Ch'p went on to become the [[Green Lantern]] of sector 1014, and became good friends with Jordan, [[Mogo]], [[Salaak]] and other members of the [[Green Lantern Corps]]. Ch'p maintained a secret identity on H'lven until he married his longtime girlfriend M'nn'e. While not serving the Guardians on Oa, Ch'p defended H'lven from various threats, many of them engineered by his old nemesis Doctor Ub'x.

Ch'p's history as a [[Green Lantern]] was fairly typical until his participation in the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]. Since the crisis had affected the entire universe, it was thus also a Crisis on Infinite H'lvens, and when he returned to his home, he discovered that history had been rewritten so that he had died in an accident fifteen years earlier. In the new timeline, his wife M'nn'e had remarried his best friend, D'll. Stunned and disheartened, Ch'p abandoned H'lven for Earth, where he served with the team of Green Lanterns that were assigned to safeguard the planet. Unlike the rest of the universe, the members of the Corps were able to recall pre-Crisis events. They were thus the only people who recalled the Green Lantern from H'lven. During this period, Ch'p once again battled Doctor U'bx, the only other person from H'lven who recalled the pre-Crisis timeline. The two adversaries eventually realized the important connection they shared and set aside their differences.

Ch'p's experiences on Earth were primarily negative, such as his shocked realization that his Earthly counterparts were non-sapient animals, so he eventually returned to H'lven to start over. When the power battery on [[Oa]] was destroyed following the execution of Sinestro, Ch'p's ring was one of the few that still functioned. The strain of living on a world where nobody remembered him led to depression and a suicide attempt that was halted by his fellow Green Lantern, [[Salaak]], who became Ch'p's advisor and friend on H'lven. The two friends later travelled to [[Oa]] to participate in the reconstruction of the Green Lantern Corps. Ch'p was assigned to patrol Oa, specifically the makeshift city called [[Mosaic World]].<ref>''Green Lantern: Mosaic'' #2</ref> There he teams up with [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]] who is under the subtle influence of [[Sinestro]]. A yellow tractor-trailer hits and kills Ch'p.<ref name="dc-ency"/>  An image of the deceased Ch'p occasionally appears to the Green Lantern John Stewart, although the exact nature of the apparition was never fully explained. When the Corps was refounded following the defeat of [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]], another native of H'lven, [[B'dg]], was selected as the new Green Lantern of sector 1014.

Ch'p has appeared in numerous ways since his death. He is shown in an [[Alex Ross]] painting of the Green Lantern Corps; and in one of the last [[Kyle Rayner]] Green Lantern stories, where Kyle visits his sector. In an issue of the DC comic ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', the character [[Ambush Bug]] is shown enjoying a snack food called "Ch'ps" that apparently has a certain space squirrel as a mascot. Ch'p also appeared in a flashback story in the current Green Lantern series (#31) training in the same class as Hal Jordan.

===Blackest Night===
{{main|Blackest Night}}
Ch'p is one of the many fallen Lanterns to be risen from his grave on [[Oa]] to become a [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]]. He is one of the many Black Lanterns beginning a stand against the living Green Lanterns on Oa.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #1 (July 2009)</ref>
The re-animated Ch'p is destroyed by Guy Gardner wielding Red and Green power rings.

===Crisis survivor===
Ch'p's status as a surviving anomaly of the first Crisis has not been fully explained since his death. His existence in the timeline is confirmed just prior to [[Infinite Crisis]], as he is mentioned in a [[Kyle Rayner]] Green Lantern story from that period. He also appears in flashback panels in the current Green Lantern series. In effect, Ch'p would be a remnant of the [[Earth-One]] timeline just as [[Power Girl]] is a remnant of [[Earth-Two]]. While this point is generally rendered moot because of his demise, the character remains one of the few pre-crisis anomalies that has not been resolved by the events of [[Infinite Crisis]].

* He appears with other Green Lantern Corps members in the final issue of ''Justice'', responding to a call for help from Hal Jordan.

==In other media==
===Television===

* Ch'p has made several cameos on ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'': in the teaser of ''Day of the Dark Knight'', in ''The Eyes of Despero'' and in both episodes of the two-part ''Siege of Starro''.[http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/bravebold/guides/reviews/04dayoftheknight/02.jpg]

* Ch'p appears as a Lantern recruit, under the tutelage of Kilowog, in the second arc of ''[[Green Lantern: The Animated Series]]''. He is Kilowog's choice to spar with Hal as the result of a wager between the two: if Hal can beat Kilowog's top recruit, Kilowog will accompany Hal on a mission. Ch'p delivers a resounding and comedic trashing to Hal. Kilowog reveals he was planning on going anyway, but that he "just wanted to see Hal fight the squirrel." <ref>http://www.comicbookmovie.com/fansites/Jolt17/news/?a=63945&channelId=d57bac34ce3a47b4a7bcdf176c80196b&channelListId&mediaId=216bd44668ec47b1b6d1d10ba2f81901</ref> He later assists Hal in rescuing Aya from the Guardians' labs, where she is about to be dissected.  Slipping into the lab while Hal distracts Chaselon, Ch'p switches Aya's memory core with that of her replacement, allowing Hal to upload her into his ship, the "Interceptor".<ref>Green Lantern: The Animated Series: Season 2 Episode 2 "Reboot".</ref> By the time of the Battle of Ranx, Ch'p has been given a senior position in the Corps. He is one of the squadron leaders consulted by Guy Gardner after the first attack upon the Manhunters.<ref>Green Lantern: The Animated Series: Season 2 Episode "Ranx".</ref> In the series finale he saves Guy Gardner by expertly decapitating a Manhunter, much to Gardner's surprise. Ch'p is not mentioned by name in the series, but his home sector is identified as 1014, which is consistent with the comic books.

* Ch'p appears in background shots in the [[original animated video]], ''[[Green Lantern: Emerald Knights]]'', which uses the same character designs from ''[[Green Lantern: First Flight]]''.
