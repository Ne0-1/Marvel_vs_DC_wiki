In the [[DC Universe]], '''Ch'p''' of the planet '''H'lven''' was a member of the [[Green Lantern Corps]]; like all H'lvenites, he resembled a somewhat [[anthropomorphic]] combination between a [[squirrel]] and a [[chipmunk]]. He was created by [[Steve Englehart]] and [[Joe Staton]].

==History==
A native of the planet [[H'lven]], Ch'p participated in the defense of his homeworld from an invasion by the Crabster army of Doctor U'bx.  Captured and sentenced to death, Ch'p was given a Green Lantern power ring by one of the [[Guardians of the Universe]].  Using the ring, Ch'p was able to defeat Doctor U'bx and free his homeworld.  Ch'p went on to become the [[Green Lantern]] of sector 1014, and became good friends with [[Hal Jordan]], [[Mogo]], [[Salakk]] and other members of the [[Green Lantern Corps]].  Ch'p maintained a secret identity on H'lven until he married his longtime girlfriend M'nn'e.  While not serving the Guardians on Oa, Ch'p defended H'lven from various threats, many of them engineered by his old nemesis Doctor U'bx.

Ch'p's history as a [[Green Lantern]] was fairly typical until his participation in the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]] - since it had affected the entire universe, it was thus also a Crisis on Infinite H'lvens, and when he returned to his home, he discovered that history had been rewritten so that he had died in an accident fifteen years earlier, and his wife M'nn'e had remarried his best friend, D'll. Stunned and disheartened, Ch'p abandoned H'lven for Earth, where he served with the team of Green Lanterns that were assigned to safeguard the planet.  During this period, Ch'p once again battled Doctor U'bx, the only other person from H'lven who recalled the pre-crisis timeline.  The two adversaries eventually realised the important connection they shared and set aside their differences.

Ch'p's experiences on Earth were primarily negative, however, so he eventually returned to H'lven to start over.  When the power battery on [[Oa]] was destroyed following the execution of Sinestro, Ch'p's ring was one of the few that still functioned.  The strain of living on a world where nobody remembered him led to depression and a suicide attempt that was halted by his fellow Green Lantern, Salakk who became Ch'p's advisor and friend on H'lven.  The two friends later travelled to [[Oa]] to participate in the reconstruction of the Green Lantern Corps.  Ch'p was assigned to patrol the [[Mosaic World]] on Oa. There, he was struck and killed by a yellow tractor-trailer. An image of the deceased Ch'p occasionally appeared to the Green Lantern John Stewart, although the exact nature of the apparition was never fully explained.  When the Corps was refounded following the defeat of [[Parallax]], another native of H'lven, [[B'dg]], was selected as the new Green Lantern of sector 1014.

A near-identical character was seen on an episode of the new [[Duck Dodgers]] cartoon series (the Green Loontern) as the Green Lantern Chip, a humaniod squirrel only capable of communicating in squirrel-like chatterings.
