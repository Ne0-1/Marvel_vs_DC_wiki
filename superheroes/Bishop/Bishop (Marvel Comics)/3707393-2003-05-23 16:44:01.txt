'''Lucas Bishop''' is a [[comic book]] character in the [[Marvel Universe]].  He first appeared in Uncanny X-men 282.  Bishop's mutant ability enables him to absorb all forms of energy and fire them out again.  

Born about 60 years in the future of the comics, he was a member of the XSE, a law enforcement agency in a world where the war between humans and mutants was a reality.  Chasing a mutant criminal, he found himself in the past, in the time of his heroes, the [[X-Men]].  Bishop failed to capture his quarry, but was invited to join the team by [[Professor Xavier]].  

Although a little lacking in a sense of humour, he has been a loyal fighter, and most recently joined the team searching for the [[Books of Truth]].
