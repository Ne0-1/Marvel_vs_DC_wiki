'''Bishop (Lucas Bishop)''', is a fictional character, a [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]] who is a member of the [[X-Men]]. Created by writer [[Whilce Portacio]] and artist/co-writer [[Jim Lee]], he first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #282 ([[1991#November|November 1991]]).

Bishop was a member of the [[Xavier Security Enforcers]], a mutant [[police]] force from a [[dystopia]]n future of the [[Marvel universe]]. He traveled to the [[20th century]] and joined the X-Men, a team he knew only as legends. A brash [[anti-hero]], he had difficulty adjusting to the norms of the time period.

He was one of the most popular X-Men of the [[1990s]]{{fact}} and made frequent appearances on [[X-Men (animated series)|the era’s ''X-Men'' animated series]]. He starred in the series ''Bishop: The Last X-Man'' (1999-2001), in which he was trapped in another [[alternate timeline]], and ''[[District X]]'' (2004-2005), which cast him as a police officer in [[New York City]]’s "mutant town."

==Fictional character history==
Born about 60 years in the future of the Marvel Universe (in the parallel world of [[Earth-1191]]), Bishop has a distinctive M [[branding|brand]] over his right eye, used to identify [[Mutant (fictional)|mutants]] in his era. After his parents were killed, Bishop was raised by a man named LeBeau, also called [[Gambit (comics)#Bishop's Future|Witness]], who was reportedly the last man to see the legendary [[X-Men]] alive.  He was reunited with his grandmother and sister in a [[concentration camp]] in [[Nevada]], shortly before the Summers Rebellion, when mutants and humans joined forces to destroy the [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]].

After the Rebellion, the mutants were "emancipated," and sent out of the camps to fend for themselves. Bishop came across an anti-mutant group called the Exhumes, who took his sister [[Shard (comics)|Shard]] hostage when the [[Xavier Security Enforcers]] arrived. After the XSE defeated the Exhume members, Bishop knew he wanted to join the XSE. When he got the chance, he accepted only on the condition that Shard could join as well.

While on a mission to wipe out a nest of Emplates, mutant [[vampire]]s that feed on [[bone marrow]], Shard was critically injured. Bishop went to Witness for help, and Witness agreed to transfer Shard's essence into a holographic matrix, if Bishop would work for him for one year.

Bishop and his XSE group "Omega Squad" captured [[Trevor Fitzroy]], a murderous ex-XSE trainee in the ruins of the Xavier Institute War Room, where Bishop found a damaged recording of [[Jean Grey]], which said something about a traitor destroying the X-Men from inside. Witness gave him very few answers, and Bishop thought that Witness did more than just witness those events.

Fitzroy escaped from prison and used a large amount of mutant life-force to open a time portal and break out 93 "Lifers" in the process, Bishop found himself in the past, in the time of his heroes, the X-Men.  Bishop eventually "sanctioned" the Lifers, but did not get Fitzroy, and [[Professor X|Professor Xavier]] offered him a place in the X-Men.  When he met [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]], Bishop recognized him as possibly a young Witness, and the two even came to blows at one point.

When the insane mutant [[Legion (Marvel Comics character)|Legion]] went back in time to assassinate [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], Bishop was one of the X-Men sent to stop him.  When they failed, and Legion accidentally killed Professor Xavier, Bishop was the only time-traveler to remain when history was altered and became the [[Age of Apocalypse]].  He convinced the Magneto of that era that their existence was wrong, and with a great amount of sacrifice, managed to correct the error and stopped Legion. After the timeline reset itself, Bishop still had unsettling memories of the Age of Apocalypse.

The traitor in the X-Men was eventually revealed to be Professor X in the form of [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]].  Bishop's knowledge of the future was the only thing that stopped Onslaught from killing the X-Men, although it was not enough to prevent Onslaught from nearly destroying all of humanity.  He made peace with Gambit, who was not the traitor after all.

When trapped in deep space, Bishop became romantically involved with [[Deathbird]], but when she turned on him and the X-Men, he killed her. In [[X-Men: The End]], written by [[Chris Claremont]], it is revealed that [[Aliyah Bishop|Aliyah]] is his and Deathbird's daughter. Bishop spent some time in an [[alternate timeline]], where he finally defeated Fitzroy.

Although a little lacking in humour, he has been a loyal fighter, and rejoined the X-Treme X-Men searching for the Books of Truth, the diaries of the precognitive [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]]. He started using "Lucas" as a first name to go with his fake police ID. Even though the diaries became invalid due to a prediction being stopped, the team stayed together for a while before returning to the mansion. His team has recently formed their own XSE, the [[X-Treme Sanctions Executive]]. Bishop has also begun a friendship with the new X-Man [[Sage (comics)|Sage]]. Bishop has recently been seen getting close to [[Archangel (comics)|Angel]]'s ex-girlfriend Detective Charlotte Jones.

Recently, Bishop joined the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] and appeared regularly in [[District X]], a [[police procedural]] set in a mutant [[ghetto]] in [[New York City]]. 

Since the House of M, Bishop continues to visit New York, but since a majority mutant population of District X was wiped out by the [[Scarlet Witch]], Bishop has instead turned his attention back to the X-Men and school primarily. He has been going on missions with the team, such as taking down the Shi'ar Death Commandos, or fighting the Foursaken. Bishop helped Psylocke deal with the Foursaken and the First Fallen, as well as helped Storm save Africa from soldiers taking children from villages. 

In the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War: X-Men]] miniseries, Bishop is siding with the O*N*E* to bring in the X-Men and the 198. He even argued with Cyclops over letting them go. Val Cooper and Tony Stark let Bishop lead Micromax and Sabra into action against Domino, Shatterstar, and the 198. Bishop led them to the base where the 198 were hiding and told the X-Men to stand down. However, General Lazer betrayed him by ensuring that Cyclops attacked Bishop. Though at first he simply absorbed it, the power was too much for him to control as he was overwhelmed, and he was forced to direct the energy he had absorbed upwards in a powerful blast that would easily destroy a O*N*E* Sentinel.

==Powers and abilities==
Bishop's [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] ability enables him to absorb all forms of energy that are directed towards him and to release that energy from his hands.  This power is passive allowing Bishop to absorb energy at all times. When he releases the energy, he can release it as many different types of forms, usually in concussive blasts or in the same form as he had absorbed the energy although he can emit microwaves as well. He can also store energy in his personal reserves for increasing his strength, endurance and to an extent his healing. His powers make it difficult to harm him with energy-based attacks, making him invulnerable (although he can become overloaded from absorbing too much energy). 

He is also vulnerable to non-energy weapon attacks. If he were to be shot by a projectile weapon or hit with a crowbar, it could stop him.

He is also a skilled [[marksmanship|marksman]] and hand-to-hand fighter. He carries XSE guns that fire laser beams and plasma charges through which he can channel his personal energies.

He has also demonstrated the ability of instinctively knowing where he is and the present hour and date. This later aspect may be linked to some chronal energy remaining in his system, or possibly some aspect of being Gateway's descendant, but the only explanation he gives about it is that "his body knows it".

==Trivia and speculation==
Given that very little is known about Bishop's past before he appeared in the present time, much has been hinted at and speculated about regarding his origin.  One theory that has prevailed is that Bishop is one of [[Storm (comics)|Storm's]] descendants.  Some questioned this theory's legitimacy once Bishop and Storm began to have a romantic relationship.  Others have argued the possibility that a relationship between Storm and Bishop in the present might lead to descendants, one of which would become Bishop himself someday and creating a [[predestination paradox]]. 

In an early issue of ''[[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]]'', Bishop becomes disoriented and mistakes [[M (comics)|M]] for his mother. It has also been indicated that the [[Australia]]n [[indigenous Australians|aboriginal]] mutant [[Gateway (comics)|Gateway]] is his great-grandfather although it is not certain. {{fact}} Interestingly, Gateway was M's mentor prior to her joining Generation X. The matter of M being Bishop's mother is still speculation, as it has yet to be confirmed.

In the Marvel ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]'', a history is provided to explain Bishop's origin. It writes: 

:"Lucas Bishop was born in the late 21st Century A.D. of an alternate future timeline in which mutant-hunting robot [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]] had taken control of North America....Bishop's parents escaped to America shortly before the island nation of Australia was destroyed in a tactical nuclear strike. They were soon captured and interred in a mutant relocation camp in [[Sheepshead Bay]] in [[Brooklyn, New York]]. There, Bishop and his sister Shard were born and, like other mutants, they were branded with 'M' tattoos over their right eyes for identification." 

This sheds some light onto the possibility of Bishop and Shard being Aboriginal Australians, their great-grandfather being Gateway. However, back in 1991 during the early international releases of ''X-Men'', official trading cards from Marvel state that he is of American nationality but of Filipino ethnicity (the card says he was born in Tondo, an impoverished district of [[Manila]], the [[Philippines]]' capital city), which is not unlikely as Whilce Portacio, Bishop's creator is himself half Filipino.{{fact}} Many fans do consider him to be African American as that was  his intented ethinicity during his first appearances.{{fact}}

In the first ''Bishop'' [[miniseries]], Bishop is confronted by another escapee from his original timeline - a killer named [[Mountjoy (comics)|Mountjoy]]. This character had the ability to enter people's bodies and "ride" them using his own personality. At the climax of the fourth issue, Mountjoy planned to use Gambit to kill the X-Men, and then "ride" him back into his own timeline. Bishop prevented this from happening but not before he witnessed the real life occurrence of Jean Grey's emergency message that he'd uncovered in his own time, stating that they "knew so little" and "shouldn't have trusted" Gambit. This clarified the mystery of the [[X-Traitor (comics)|X-Traitor]] and also how Gambit (in the guise of the Witness) was the last person to see the X-Men alive, yet seemed to be completely forgotten by Marvel and its readers in favour of the Onslaught storyline.

This statement has been called into question, because during the Onslaught encounter, in the issue of Uncanny X-Men after Juggernaut sought asylum at the X-Mansion (running from Onslaught), it was revealed that the message from Jean was actually referring to Charles being overtaken by Onslaught.  The "knew so little" and "never should have trusted" was a reference to 'never should have trusted there was no effect of mindwiping Magneto', which has been recognized as the trigger to the 'birth' of Onslaught.  The "Professor Xavier" and "first to die" was a major gap, as that issue revealed that Jean actually stated it appeared [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] was the first to die.

==Alternate versions==
===Ultimate Bishop===
[[Image:Ultimatebishop.PNG|Ultimate Bishop. Art by [[Ben Oliver]].|thumb]]
In ''Ultimate X-Men'' #43 when [[Emma Frost]] introduces some of the candidates for the new, government-supported mutant team to the President, a muscular [[African American]] with braided hair and wearing a golden chain around his neck is shown on a screen. The President says, "No to Bishop with his criminal record." <!--Did this Bishop have an M on his eye? Because if he did, it would help to differentiate from the #76 Bishop who doesn't-->

A time-travelling Bishop appears in ''Ultimate X-Men'' #76; it is unknown if this Bishop is connected to the cameo from #43. Moments after the battle with [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] concludes, he appears asking if he's too late to stop Cable. Wolverine knocks him unconscious and the X-Men interrogate him. He is wearing the same uniform as the members of Cable's [[Six Pack (comics)|squad]].
