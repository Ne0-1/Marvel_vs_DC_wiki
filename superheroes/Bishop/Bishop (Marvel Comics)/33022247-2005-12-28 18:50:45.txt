'''Bishop''', alias "Lucas Bishop", is a [[comic book]] [[fictional character]] in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  He first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #282 (November 1991).  Bishop's mutant ability enables him to absorb all forms of energy and release the absorbed energy in the form of a burst of concussive force.

==Character history==
Born about 60 years in the future of the Marvel Universe, Lucas Bishop has a distinctive M brand over his right eye, used to identify [[Mutant (fictional)|mutants]] in his era. After his parents were killed, Bishop was raised by a man named LeBeau, also called '''Witness''', reportedly the last man to see the legendary [[X-Men]] alive.  He was reunited with his grandmother and sister in a [[concentration camp]] in [[Nevada]], shortly before the Summers Rebellion, when mutants and [[human]]s joined forces to destroy the [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]].

After the Rebellion, the mutants were "emancipated," sent out of the camps to fend for themselves. Bishop came across an anti-mutant group called the Exhumes, who took his sister [[Shard (comics)|Shard]] hostage when the Xavier Security Enforcers entered the situation. After the XSE defeated the Exhume member, Bishop knew he wanted to join the XSE. When he got the chance, he accepted only if Shard could join as well.

While on a mission to wipe out a nest of Emplates, mutant [[vampire]]s that feed on [[Bone marrow]], Shard was critically injured. Bishop went to Witness for help, and he agreed to transfer Shard's essence into a holographic matrix, if Bishop would work for him for one year.

Bishop and his XSE group "Omega Squad" captured [[Trevor Fitzroy]], a murderous ex-XSE trainee in the ruins of the Xavier Institute War Room, where Bishop found a damaged recording of [[Jean Grey]], which said something about a traitor destroying the [[X-Men]] from inside. Witness gave him very few answers, and Bishop thought that Witness did more than just witness those events.

Fitzroy escaped from prison and used a large amount of mutant life-force to open a time portal and break out 93 "Lifers" in the process, Bishop found himself in the past, in the time of his heroes, the X-Men.  Bishop eventually "sanctioned" the Lifers, but did not get Fitzroy, and [[Professor X|Professor Xavier]] offered him a place in the X-Men.  When he met [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]], Bishop recognized him as possibly a younger Witness, and the two even came to blows at one point.

When the insane mutant [[Legion (Marvel Comics character)|Legion]] went back in time to assassinate [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], Bishop was one of the X-Men sent to stop him.  When they failed, and Legion accidentally killed Charles Xavier, Bishop was the only time-traveller to remain when history was altered and became the [[Age of Apocalypse]].  He convinced the Magneto of that era that their existence was wrong, and with a great amount of sacrifice, managed to correct the error and stopped Legion. After the timeline reset itself, Bishop still had unsettling memories of the Age of Apocalypse.

The traitor in the X-Men was eventually revealed to be Professor X in the form of [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]].  Bishop's knowledge of the future was the only thing that stopped [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] from killing the X-Men, although it was not enough to prevent [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] from nearly destroying all of humanity.  He made peace with Gambit, who was not the traitor after all.

When trapped in deep space, Bishop became romantically involved with [[Deathbird]], but when she turned on him and the X-Men, he vented her.  Bishop spent some time in an [[alternate timeline]], where he finally defeated Fitzroy.

Although a little lacking in humour, he has been a loyal fighter, and most recently joined the team searching for the Books of Truth, the diaries of the precognitive [[Destiny (Marvel Comics)|Destiny]], and started using "Lucas" as a first name to go with his fake police ID. Even though the diaries became invalid due to a prediction being stopped, the team stayed together for a while before returning to the mansion. His team has recently formed their own X.S.E. - the [[X-Treme Sanctions Executive]] Bishop has also begun a friendship with the new X-Man [[Sage (comics)|Sage]].

Lately, Bishop joined the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] and now appears regularly in [[District X]], a [[police procedural]] set in a mutant [[ghetto]] in [[New York City]]. He still continues to work with the X-Men.

==Trivia and speculation==
Given that very little is known about Bishop's past before he appeared in the present time, much has been hinted at and speculated about regarding his origin.  One theory that has prevailed is that Bishop is one of [[Storm (comics)|Storm]]'s children, grandchildren, or great-grandchildren.  Some questioned this theory's legitimacy once Bishop and Storm began to have a relationship in the present.  Others have argued the possibility that a relationship between Storm and Bishop in the present might lead to descendants, one of which would become Bishop himself someday and creating a [[predestination paradox]]. 

In an earlier issue of [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]], Bishop becomes dizzy and mistakes [[M (comics)|M]] for his mother. It has also been revealed that the [[Australia]]n [[aborigine|aboriginal]] mutant [[Gateway (comics)|Gateway]] is his great-grandfather although it is not certain. It is interesting, as [[Gateway (comics)|Gateway]] was [[M (comics)|M's]] mentor prior to her joining [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]]. The matter of [[M (comics)|M]] being Bishop's mother is still speculation, as it has yet to be confirmned.
