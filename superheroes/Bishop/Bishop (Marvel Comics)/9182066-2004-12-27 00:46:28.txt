[[Image:Bishop-bigcostume7.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Bishop.Art by Alan Davis.]] '''Bishop''' is a [[comic book]] character in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  He first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #282.  Bishop's mutant ability enables him to absorb all forms of energy and release the absorbed energy in the form of a burst of concussive force.

Born about 60 years in the future of the Marvel Universe, he was a member of the XSE, a law enforcement agency in a world where the war between humans and mutants was a reality.  Chasing a mutant criminal, he found himself in the past, in the time of his heroes, the [[X-Men]].  Bishop failed to capture his quarry, but was invited to join the team by [[Professor X]].

When the insane mutant [[Legion (Marvel Comics character)|Legion]] went back in time to assassinate [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], Bishop was one of the X-Men sent to stop him.  When they failed, and Legion accidentally killed Charles Xavier, Bishop was the only time-traveller to remain when history was altered and became the [[Age of Apocalypse]].  He convinced the Magneto of that era that their existence was wrong, and with a great amount of sacrifice, managed to correct the error and get sent back to stop Legion.

Although a little lacking in humour, he has been a loyal fighter, and most recently joined the team searching for the Books of Truth, the diaries of the precognitive [[Destiny (Marvel Comics)|Destiny]]. Even though the diaries became invalid due to a prediction being stopped, the team stayed together for a while before returning to the mansion. His team has recently formed their own X.S.E. Bishop has also begun a friendship with the new x-man [[Sage (comics)|Sage]].

Given that very little is known about Bishop's past before he appeared in the present time, much has been hinted at and speculated about regarding his origin.  One theory that has prevailed is that Bishop is one of [[Storm]]'s children, grandchildren, or great-grandchildren.  Some questioned this theory's legitimacy once Bishop and Storm began to have a relationship in the present.  Others have argued the possibility that a relationship between Storm and Bishop in the present might lead to descendants, one of which would become Bishop himself someday.

It has been recently revealed that the [[Australia]]n [[aborigine|aboriginal]] mutant [[Gateway (comics)|Gateway]] is his great-grandfather, and that his first name is Lucas.

Lately, Bishop joined the FBI and now appears regularly in [[District X]], a [[police procedural]] set in Mutant ghetto in [[New_York_City|New York]].He still continues to work with the X-Men.
