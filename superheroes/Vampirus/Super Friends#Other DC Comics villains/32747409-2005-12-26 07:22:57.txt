'''''Super Friends''''' is an [[animated series]] about a team of [[superhero]]es which ran from [[1973]] to [[1985]].  It was produced by [[Hanna-Barbera]] and is based on the [[Justice League]] and associated [[comic book]] characters published by [[DC Comics]].

==History==

When animation company [[Hanna-Barbera]] licensed the animation rights to the DC Comics characters and adapted the ''[[Justice League of America]]'' comic book for [[television]], it made several changes in the transition, not the least of which was the change of name to ''Super Friends''. In part, it was feared that the name ''Justice League of America'' would have seemed too [[jingoistic]] during the post-[[Vietnam War]] Era.  Nevertheless, team members sometimes referred to themselves as the Justice League on the show. The violence common in [[superhero comics]] was toned down for a younger audience, as well as to fit with the restrictive broadcast standards regarding violence in [[1970s]] [[Saturday morning cartoons|children's television]]. 

The primary characters featured in the series were [[Superman]], [[Batman]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], [[Wonder Woman]], and [[Aquaman]]. These had long been DC Comics' most popular and [[iconic]] heroes, with the exception of Aquaman, who was included by virtue of having recently had a cartoon of his own, produced by [[Filmation]]. The team's first sidekicks were Wendy (voiced by [[Sherry Alberoni|Sherri Alberoni]]) and [[Marvin White (Super Friends)|Marvin]] (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]) and their [[dog]] [[Wonderdog]], none of whom had any special abilities (unless one counts the dog's unexplained ability to reason and "talk"). Later they were replaced by pointy-eared shape-shifting [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|aliens]] Zan and Jayna, the "[[Wonder Twins]]," and their "space [[monkey]]" [[Gleek (Super Friends)|Gleek]]. Earlier seasons occasionally introduced other members of the Justice League as guest stars, including [[The Flash|the Flash]], [[Plastic Man]], and [[Green Arrow]]. 

Initially, each episode was a single one-hour story, and the villians (mostly original creations not in the comics) were often misguided, rather than evil.  Subsequent seasons were a mix of one-hour and half-hour episodes, the one-hour episodes sometimes featuring two or more short stories in each hour, and made use of established villains from the DC comics. The ''Challenge of the Superfriends'' season introduced the [[Legion of Doom]], a team of 13 recurring foes comprised of the Super Friends' worst enemies. They used a swamp-based, vaguely mechanical, flying headquarters (the Hall of Doom) which suspiciously resembled the head of [[Darth Vader]], as a suitable contrast with the Super Friends's gleaming [[Hall of Justice]].

Hanna-Barbera's writers experimented with team composition as well. "Challenge of the Superfriends" eliminated the teen sidekicks, but added [[Hawkman]], [[Green Lantern]], and [[The Flash]] as well as three characters without previous comic-book [[antecedents]]. [[Black Vulcan]], [[Apache Chief]] and [[Samurai (superhero)|Samurai]], intended to be international heroes, were created for the show as well in order to encourage racial and [[cultural diversity]]. Critics felt that these attempts were awkward at best and very stereotypical and somewhat offensive at worst. Subsequent versions of the show resulted in a fourth "diversity" hero, [[El Dorado (Superhero)|El Dorado]], and guest stars who had also appeared in DC comics, including [[Rima]] (a jungle-queen character similar to [[Sheena, Queen of the Jungle]] and Marvel Comics' [[Shanna the She-Devil]]), [[Hawkgirl]] and [[The Atom]].
 
The final two seasons, "The Legendary Super Powers Show" and "Super Powers Team" made further refinements to the roster, adding teen members [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] and [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]], respectively, each with a comics history. [[Darkseid]] and his entourage became established as the team's main enemies.

==Trivia==
*The [[Wonder Twins]] were supposedly inspired by [[Donny Osmond|Donny]] and [[Marie Osmond]].
*Wendy, Marvin, and Wonder Dog were inspired by the [[Scooby-Doo]] gang.
*[[Black Vulcan]] was created to avoid having to pay [[Black Lightning]] creator [[Tony Isabella]] royalties.
*In one episode where a giant [[Krypton (planet)|Krypton]]ian [[pteranodon]] is rampaging on Earth, the team must choose whether they should acquire a massive supply of [[kryptonite]] to drive it off and risk Superman's life in the process. Superman asserts that the team has a long-standing principle of seeking "the greatest good for the greatest number" and insists that the kryptonite be used. The quote is taken from [[John Stuart Mill]] and introduced the ethical principles of [[utilitarianism]] to viewers. 
*At one point, [[Cartoon Network]] produced three commercials lampooning the Super Friends.  One dealt with the [[idiosyncratic]] nature of the Legion of Doom and [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]]'s odd manner of dress (''Brainiac: "Look, all I want is pants... a decent pair of pants!" [[Solomon Grundy]]: Solomon Grundy want pants, too!"'').  The second dealt with the [[Wonder Twins]]' uselessness in battle.  The third, co-starring the [[Powerpuff Girls]], dealt with [[Aquaman]]'s useless powers (''Aquaman: "My ability to talk to fish is of no use to us, [[Wonder Woman]]!"'').
*A first season episode of the [[Cartoon Network]] television series ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' featured The [[Ultimen]], a group of superheroes that are a [[pastiche]] of heroes unique to the Super Friends.  The members were [[Long Shadow]] (based on Apache Chief), [[Wind Dragon]] (Samurai), [[Juice (Justice League Unlimited)|Juice]] (Black Vulcan), [[Downpour]] (Zan of the Wonder Twins), and [[Shifter (Justice League Unlimited)|Shifter]] (Jayna of the Wonder Twins).  The headquarters of the Ultimen, although on top of a [[skyscraper]], resembled the Super Friends' Hall of Justice.
*The fifth season of "Justice League Unlimited" has shown [[Gorilla Grodd]] forming a massive Legion of villians. While not called "The Legion of Doom" on the show, thier [[headquarters]] is a craft similar to the Hall of Doom, located in a swamp.
*[[DC Comics]] published a [[comic book]] version of the Super Friends in the [[1970s]]. In the [[2000s]] DC satirized the Super Friends in two separate [[miniseries]], "Formerly Known As the Justice League" and "I Can't Believe It's Not the Justice League!," as the "Super Buddies," a team of various ex-[[Justice League]] members.
*The [[Hall of Justice]] from the Super Friends can be seen in the ''[[Teen Titans (animated series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series.  It appears behind the [[Titans Tower]] in the opening sequence and uses of the same shot in the show.
*[[Filipino]] comedian [[Rex Navarrete]] gave a satirized depiction of the Super Friends in his comedy routine ''[[Maritess vs the Super Friends]]'' about Maritess, a Filipina immigrant who worked as the Super Friends' [[maid]] at the Hall of Justice. This was made into a short [[Macromedia Flash]] animation by [[Dino Ignacio]]. [http://www.fractalcow.com/rex/]
*After [[Olan Soule]] served as the voice of [[Batman]] on the show for several years, he turned the part over to none other than the man who played Batman on the live action [[Batman (TV series)|60s TV]] series, [[Adam West]], for the 1983 Superpowers series. For this season, Olan instead played the voice of  professor Stein, one half of [[Firestorm the Nuclear Man]].
*Noted painter [[Alex Ross]] is an avowed fan of the show and has worked it into his various projects. In "Kingdom Come," the United Nations building resembles the [[Hall of Justice]] while the [[Gulag]] is obviously designed on the [[Hall of Doom]]. Ross is also helping to create the current 12-issue "Justice" series in which a new and improved [[Legion of Doom]] clashes with the [[JLA]].
*The frequent pairings of [[Wonder Woman]] and [[Aquaman]] has led some fans to speculate on a potential romance between the Amazon Princess and the Atlantean King.
