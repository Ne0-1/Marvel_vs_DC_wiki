'''''Super Friends''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[Cartoon series|animated television series]] about a team of [[superhero]]es, which ran from 1973 to 1986 on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] as part of its [[Saturday morning cartoon]] lineup. It was produced by [[Hanna-Barbera]] and was based on the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]] (JLA) and associated [[comic book]] characters published by [[DC Comics]].

The name of the program (and the JLA members featured with the Super Friends) have been variously represented (as ''Super Friends'' and ''Challenge of the Super Friends'', for example) at different points in its broadcast history. There were a total of [[List of Super Friends episodes|109 episodes]] and two [[Television pilot#Backdoor pilots|backdoor-pilot]] episodes of ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]'', with [[Batman]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] appearing in "The Dynamic Scooby Doo Affair" and "The Caped Crusader Caper."

==Writing==
Plot lines for the later series involved many of the familiar [[DC Comics]] super-villains but the first incarnation of the ''Super Friends'' did not. Instead, like the comic books, they focused on the far-fetched schemes of mad scientists and aliens, who were invariably revealed as being well-intentioned, and simply pursuing their goals through unlawful or disreputable means.<ref name="Vault">{{cite book |page=10 |title=The DC Vault |first=Martin |last=Pasko |publisher=Running Press |year=2008}}</ref> Typically, at the end of each story, a peaceful and reasonable discussion would typically be performed by the heroes to convince the antagonists to adopt more reasonable methods.<ref>{{cite news|title= A History of Batman on TV|work= IGN|date=|url= http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/891/891807p4.html|accessdate=2010-08-15}}</ref>

''The All-New Super Friends Hour'' departed somewhat from the previous series' formula by featuring villains using more elaborate methods to further their goals; as a rule they could not be reasoned with, requiring the heroes to use direct force to stop them. Beginning with ''Challenge of the Super Friends'', several of the heroes' arch-villains from the comic books (such as [[Lex Luthor]] and [[Riddler|The Riddler]]) began to feature prominently in comic-style stories. Throughout the series, plots often wrapped themselves up neatly in the final minutes of an episode in the fashion of the typical comic books and [[deus ex machina]].<ref name="Vault"/>

==Production history==
When animation company [[Hanna-Barbera]] acquired rights to the DC Comics characters and adapted the ''[[Justice League|Justice League of America]]'' comic book for [[television]] it made several changes in the transition, including the change of name to ''Super Friends.'' Nevertheless, team members sometimes referred to themselves as the Justice League on the show. The violence common in [[superhero]] [[Comic book|comics]] was toned down for a younger audience and to adhere to broadcast standards governing violence in 1970s [[Saturday morning cartoon|children’s television]].

Like most Hanna-Barbera shows, the rights to the ''Super Friends'' franchise are owned by DC's parent company ([[Warner Bros.]]); as a result, the series has been under Warner Bros. control. Thus, [[Cartoon Network]] was not able to air the series until after the merger of [[Time Warner]] and [[Turner Broadcasting System]] was completed.

===1973–1974 series===
{{Main|Super Friends (1973 TV series)}}
''Super Friends'' first aired on ABC on September 8, 1973,<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|last=Rupprecht |first=Michael C. |url=http://members.aol.com/SprFriends/chronology.htm#superfriends73-74  |title=Hanna-Barbera Superfriends Chronology |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-02 |archiveurl = //web.archive.org/web/20080128000006/http://members.aol.com/SprFriends/chronology.htm#superfriends73-74 |archivedate = 2008-01-28}}</ref> featuring well-known DC characters [[Superman]], [[Batman]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], [[Wonder Woman]], and [[Aquaman]]. Superman, Batman and Robin and Aquaman had each previously appeared in their own animated series produced by [[Filmation]], and voice talent from these prior programs was brought in to work on the new show. Shortly before the ''Super Friends'' series was developed, Superman and Wonder Woman also guest-starred in two episodes of ''[[The Brady Kids]]'', while Batman and Robin appeared in two episodes of ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]''.

In addition to the superheroes, a trio of sidekicks was introduced, each of whom were new characters not drawn from the comic books: [[Wendy and Marvin]] (voiced by [[Sherry Alberoni|Sherri Alberoni]] and [[Frank Welker]]) and [[Wonder Dog (Super Friends)|Wonder Dog]] (also voiced by [[Frank Welker]]), none of whom had any special abilities (save the dog's unexplained ability to reason and "talk"). Inspired by the [[Scooby-Doo]] gang, the trio—or at least its human members—were depicted as detectives and/or superheroes-in-training.

Each episode began with the heroes responding to an emergency detected by the massive TroubAlert computer in the [[Hall of Justice (comics)|Hall of Justice]], which served as the headquarters of the team. Colonel Wilcox, a [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] official, was a recurring character who would act as a government liaison with the Super Friends during emergencies. Colonel Wilcox was voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]].
Conflicts were usually resolved with the antagonists persuaded to adapt more reasonable methods to achieve their aims (with the assistance of the heroes). Natural disasters triggered by human (or alien) activity were often shown, and environmental themes featured strongly in the program. Three other DC Comics superheroes were featured as guest stars during this season: [[Flash (Barry Allen)|the Flash]], [[Plastic Man]], and [[Green Arrow]].

This first run of ''Super Friends'', consisting of 16 one-hour episodes which were rerun several times, concluded on August 24, 1974. At this point, the series was cancelled. However, interest in superheroes among ABC's prime-time viewers (with the success of ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'' and the live-action ''[[Wonder Woman (TV series)|Wonder Woman]]'' series) caused the network to revive ''Super Friends''.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> The original 16 episodes of the series were rebroadcast as a mid-season replacement, running from February 7, 1976, to September 3, 1977.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> These episodes were edited into half-hour versions. At the same time DC Comics published a ''Super Friends'' comic, which used Wendy and Marvin from issue #1 (Nov 1976) to #6 (Aug. 1977).  In the meantime, Hanna-Barbera began production on a revamped version of the show.

===1977–1978 season: ''The All-New Super Friends Hour''===
{{Main|The All-New Super Friends Hour}}
''The All-New Super Friends Hour'' featured four animated shorts per program.  Wendy, Marvin and Wonder Dog were dropped from this and all future TV iterations of ''Super Friends'', and were replaced by [[Wonder Twins]] Zan and Jayna, and their pet monkey, [[Gleek (Super Friends)|Gleek]].  Unlike Wendy and Marvin, Zan and Jayna had actual super powers.

The show followed a basic format each week. The first segment of every show featured two of the heroes (for the purposes of the team-ups in the first and fourth segments, Batman and Robin were considered "one hero") teaming up in a separate mini-story. The second segment featured a story with the Wonder Twins. The third segment was considered the "primary" adventure of the week, featuring the entire Super Friends roster (including the Wonder Twins) in a longer adventure. The fourth and final segment featured a story with one of the primary lineup and a "special guest star". This segment typically featured a problem that was solved using the guest star's unique abilities.

Between segments there were short spots with members of the Super Friends giving basic safety lessons, providing first-aid advice, demonstrating magic tricks, creating crafts, and presenting a two-part riddle featuring the week's primary plot line. This was the first season to feature two villains appearing in the comic books, [[Black Manta]] and [[Gentleman Ghost]]. Black Manta's costume was not black, and he was only referred to as "Manta"; both he and Gentleman Ghost only appeared in one episode this season, referred to as "Gentleman Jim Craddock".

===1978–1979 season: ''All-New Super Friends''/''Challenge of the Super Friends''===
{{Main|Challenge of the Super Friends}}
The next season of ''Super Friends'' featured two programs in an extended format. There was now a half-hour segment following the format of the previous season and a second half-hour segment, entitled ''[[Challenge of the Super Friends]]''.

====First segment: ''All-New Super Friends'' episodes====
The first half-hour of the program featured the established group of heroes: Superman, Batman and Robin, Aquaman, Wonder Woman, the Wonder Twins and Gleek. These 16 half-hour segments are seldom seen in syndication.

====Second segment: ''Challenge of the Super Friends''====
The next segment of the show introduced the [[Legion of Doom (Super Friends)|Legion of Doom]], a team of 13 recurring foes who are the Super Friends’ worst enemies. They used a swamp-based mechanical flying headquarters, the Hall of Doom (resembling the helmet of [[Darth Vader]]), as a contrast to the Super Friends’ gleaming Hall of Justice.

Additional heroes who had previously appeared as guest stars were added to the roster as well, to make a total of 11. These included the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] ([[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]]), [[Green Lantern]] ([[Hal Jordan]]) and [[Thanagar]]ian lawman [[Hawkman]] ([[Hawkman (Katar Hol)|Katar Hol]]) from DC Comics and three Hanna-Barbera creations: [[Black Vulcan]], [[Apache Chief]], and [[Samurai (Super Friends)|Samurai]]. Despite the Riddler showing a set of playing cards with (from left to right) Gleek, Zan, Aquaman, Wonder Woman, Robin, Batman, and Superman he then burns to ashes in his introduction in "Wanted: The Super Friends", the Wonder Twins and Gleek did not appear in ''Challenge''. Enthusiasts have expressed the view that the storylines for the ''Challenge'' episodes were the ''Super Friends'' era's best portrayal of the DC heroes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.aol.com/SprFriends/chronology.htm#challenge |title=Hanna-Barbera Superfriends Chronology |publisher=Members.aol.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-02}}</ref>

On January 18 and 25, 1979, Hanna-Barbera ran two, one-hour live-action specials under the umbrella title ''[[Legends of the Superheroes]]''. The first special, subtitled "The Challenge", was loosely based on the Super Friends and the 1960s ''Batman'' series (played for laughs, but this time, including a laugh track) and included several other DC characters who replaced Samurai, Black Vulcan, and Apache Chief: [[Black Canary]], the E-2 [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|Huntress]] Helena Wayne (a new DC character, gathering her own following in ''All-Star'' and ''Adventure Comics'' JSA runs as a JSA member), and [[Shazam!]] (Captain Marvel, who had previously had his own live action series through Filmation studios). The second special, entitled "The Roast", featured [[Ed McMahon]] as emcee of the roast, along the lines of ''[[The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast]]'' specials. Due to Warner Bros.' contracts on Wonder Woman (already being used in her own live action series) and Superman (in his own live-action movies at the time), they were unable to be featured on the specials.

===1979–1980 season: ''The World's Greatest Super Friends''===
{{Main|The World's Greatest Super Friends}}

In the fall of 1979, the ''Super Friends'' returned to their prior format, bringing back the original set of five DC superheroes and Zan, Jayna and Gleek. Eight one-hour episodes were created for this run, with the majority of the season consisting of repeats of ''The All-New Super Friends Hour'' from 1977 to 1978. Renamed ''The World's Greatest Super Friends'', this series began on September 22, 1979, and ran until September 27, 1980.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.aol.com/SprFriends/chronology.htm#worldsgreatest |title=Hanna-Barbera Superfriends Chronology |publisher=Members.aol.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-02}}</ref>

===1980–1982 seasons: ''Super Friends''===
{{Main|Super Friends (1980)}}
Renamed ''[[Super Friends (1980)|Super Friends]]'' in 1980, the series changed formats again, abandoning the production of half-hour episodes and producing seven-minute shorts. Each episode of ''Super Friends'' would feature a rerun from one of the previous six years and three new shorts. These new adventures featured appearances by the core group of five Super Friends and  Zan, Jayna & Gleek. There were also guest appearances from members previously depicted in ''Challenge of the Super Friends'' and the Hanna-Barbera-created hero [[El Dorado (Super Friends)|El Dorado]], who was added to the show in 1981 to provide cultural diversity.
This would prove to be one of the longer-lived incarnations of the series (three years).

===1982–1983 season: ''The Best of the Super Friends'' (reruns)===
For the 1982–1983 television season ABC ran half-hour reruns of shows from the previous seven seasons, with none of the seven-minute shorts rebroadcast. ABC called the rerun package ''The Best of the Super Friends''.

===1983–1984 season: Cancellation and the "lost episodes"===
Hanna-Barbera and Warner Bros. had created a [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] package of the earlier ''Super Friends'' series (co-distributed by [[Lexington Broadcast Services Company|LBS Communications]]); these were picked up by stations across the United States and typically broadcast on weekday afternoons. Not wishing to compete with the syndication programming, ABC dropped the series from the 1983–1984 Saturday morning television line-up. For the second time, ''Super Friends'' was cancelled.

However, during this time Hanna-Barbera continued to produce new episodes with the Super Friends. In total, 24 "lost episodes" were animated (but not aired) in the United States that season; the series appeared in Australia. Three of these episodes were aired when ''Super Friends'' returned to Saturday-morning ABC television the following year. The remainder aired on the USA network in 1995, as part of the ''[[The Superman/Batman Adventures|Superman/Batman Adventures]]'' show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.aol.com/SprFriends/chronology.htm#lost83-84 |title=Hanna-Barbera Superfriends Chronology |publisher=Members.aol.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-02}}</ref>

===1984–1985 season: ''Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show''===
{{Main|Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show|Super Powers Collection}}

''Super Friends'' returned to ABC Saturday, September 8, 1984, with a new 30-minute program typically featuring two 11-minute stories per episode. This incarnation featured Superman, Batman, Robin, Wonder Woman, the Wonder Twins and Gleek, this time teamed up with [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]]. In addition to this core group, episodes during this season also featured cameos by old (and new) Super Friends. The series ended August 31, 1985, and featured comic-book villains such as [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]], [[Lex Luthor]], [[Mirror Master]], [[Mr. Mxyzptlk]], [[Darkseid]] and his henchmen from [[Apokolips]]. This season and the next featured the "Super Powers" tagline, which was part of a marketing tie-in with a [[Super Powers Collection|toy line of the same name]] produced by [[Kenner]] and designed by [[Jack Kirby]].<ref>[http://toyotter.com/sp/ toyotter.com]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}</ref>

===1985–1986 season: ''The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians''===
{{Main|The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians}}

In fall 1985 the next version of Hanna-Barbera's depiction of the DC Comics heroes began, although it no longer carried the ''Super Friends'' name. This series returned to a conventional lineup for the team, with a focus on teen members [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] and Firestorm. Once again headquartered at the Hall of Justice in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], the heroes battled such familiar foes as [[Lex Luthor]], [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]], the [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]] and recurring villain [[Darkseid]]. It also contained the only appearances by [[Joker (comics)|The Joker]], [[Penguin (comics)|The Penguin]], the [[Royal Flush Gang]] and [[Felix Faust]].

''The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians'' lasted one season before being canceled. The final new episode aired was "The Death of Superman" on November 6, 1985. This third cancellation would be the final one, and ''Galactic Guardians'' marked the end of Hanna-Barbera's 13-year run of the series on September 30, 1986.

==References to the Justice League of America name==
Beginning with the original ''Super Friends'' season, the opening narration describes the team's headquarters as "the great hall of the Justice League." The opening credits of ''Challenge of the Super Friends'' names the Super Friends as the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]]. In addition to the appearance of a JLA emblem on a communicator and a reference to a mission to repair the Justice League satellite, the Super Friends are often linked with the JLA. The Justice League satellite under repair is clearly the same design as the [[Justice League Satellite]] that appeared in the comics at the time, but was shown to be substantially smaller than its comic book counterpart.

==Notable voice actors==
The voice of the Narrator was provided by actor [[Ted Knight]] during the early hour-long episodes.  [[Bill Woodson]] took over with the revival of the series in 1977.  His signature line was "Later, at the Hall of Justice...". The voices of Marvin and Wonder Dog as well as Mr. Mxyzptlk, Toyman, The Dollmaker, Darkseid, Kalibak and The Joker were performed by [[Frank Welker]]. [[Adam West]] provided the voice of Batman in ''[[Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show]]'' and ''[[The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians]]''. [[Casey Kasem]] provided the voice of Robin (and many others in the show). [[Rene Auberjonois]] lends his voice as Desaad.

==Reception==
In January 2009, [[IGN]] listed ''Super Friends'' as the 50th best animated television series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/top-100-animated-tv-series/50.html |title=IGN - 50. SuperFriends |publisher=Tv.ign.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-02}}</ref>

==Spin-offs==

===''The Plastic Man Comedy Adventure Show''===
{{Main|The Plastic Man Comedy/Adventure Show}}
Plastic Man first appeared in the first season of ''Super Friends'', in one episode. Later, [[Ruby-Spears|Ruby-Spears Productions]] released a series starring the character in his own solo adventures.

===''Batman''===
A Batman animated series was also considered in the mid-1980s, presumably with [[Adam West]] reprising his role as the voice of Batman.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} "The Fear" was written as a pilot episode for the series, but it was instead adapted in to an episode of ''[[The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians]]''.

===''The New Teen Titans''===
In 1983, a cartoon based upon ''[[Teen Titans|The New Teen Titans]]'' comics began development. It was created as a companion for the ''Super Friends'', to be set in the same continuity. Robin wasn't going to be featured in the cartoon though, at least not as a regular, since in the ''Super Friends'' universe, he was a member of the Justice League. Like ''Super Friends'', the show was to be developed by Hanna-Barbera for ABC, but since shows like ''[[The Smurfs (1981 TV series)|The Smurfs]]'' (airing on [[NBC]]) were so popular at the time, this show was never picked up by the network. The show would have featured [[Donna Troy|Wonder Girl]] as the leader, along with [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]], [[Wally West|Kid Flash]], [[Beast Boy|Changeling]], [[Raven (comics)|Raven]] and [[Starfire (comics)|Starfire]]. Although the show failed to get picked up, a television commercial with a [[substance abuse]] theme did feature the Titans, as they would have appeared in the animated series, along with a new superhero named "The Protector" who would have been the replacement character for Robin. A Teen Titans animated TV program was eventually [[Teen Titans (TV series)|produced]], adding Robin and removing Wonder Girl, Kid Flash, and The Protector.

===''Superman (1988 TV series)''===
{{Main|Superman (TV series)}}
In 1988, just two years after the [[The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians|final season]] of ''Super Friends'', a new series created by [[Ruby-Spears|Ruby-Spears Productions]] that featured a solo Superman aired on [[CBS]]. In the episode called "Superman and Wonder Woman vs. The Sorceress of Time", Wonder Woman guest stars, and [[B. J. Ward (actress)|B.J. Ward]] reprises her role as Wonder Woman.

===''DC Super Friends''===
{{Main|Imaginext#DC Super Friends}}
[[Fisher-Price]] developed a toy line named DC Super Friends featuring DC Comics characters as toys for young children. A comic book series and direct-to-video original animation called ''The Joker's Playhouse'' (2010) was developed to tie-in. The video features the World's Greatest Super Friends theme, allusions to the Legion of Doom, and the Super Friends and their Hall of Justice.

==Comic books==

===''Super Friends''===
The first use of the ''Super Friends'' name on a [[DC Comics]] publication was in ''[[Limited Collectors' Edition (comics)|Limited Collectors' Edition]]'' #C-41 (December 1975-January 1976) which reprinted stories from ''Justice League of America'' #36 and 61 and featured a new framing sequence by writer [[E. Nelson Bridwell]] and artist [[Alex Toth]].<ref>{{cite journal|last = Franklin|first = Chris|title = The Kids in the Hall (of Justice) A Whirlwind Tour with the Super Friends|magazine = [[Back Issue (magazine)|Back Issue]]|issue = 61|pages = 24–28|publisher = [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date = December 2012|quote=  }}</ref><ref>[http://www.comics.org/issue/68956/ ''Limited Collectors' Edition'' #C-41] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> DC published a [[comic book]] version of the ''Super Friends'' from November 1976 to August 1981. The comic book series was launched by E. Nelson Bridwell and artist [[Ric Estrada]].<ref>{{cite book|last=McAvennie|first= Michael|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 171 |quote = Hanna-Barbera's animated ''Super Friends'' proved so successful that DC brought the concept full circle, adapting the show into a comic. Scribe E. Nelson Bridwell and artist Ric Estrada crafted the inaugural issue.}}</ref> Zan and Jayna were given back stories and secret identities as a pair of blond-haired high school kids; they were more competent heroes than their cartoon counterparts.

While the television cartoons were not part of the same fictional universe as the DC comic books, writer E. Nelson Bridwell made the comic book accord with the other DC titles via [[footnote]]s. An example of trying to fit ''Super Friends'' into the DC Universe:
*Wendy, Marvin and Wonder Dog were the only ones active at the Hall of Justice, because the Justice League are in the 30th Century with the [[Justice Society]] (as shown in ''[[Justice League of America]]'' #147–148). Robin was busy helping the Titans in ''[[Teen Titans]]'' #50-52. Bridwell also gave them last names and ties to the other characters' histories; Wendy Harris was the niece of detective Harvey Harris (who helped trained [[Batman]]) and Marvin White was the son of Diana Prince (the woman who helped provide [[Wonder Woman]] with a secret identity upon her arrival in America). While the show never explained the departure of Wendy, Marvin and Wonder Dog, the story was found in ''Super Friends'' #6–9.

The argument for the comic being part of the Earth-One continuity also included the fact that certain elements of the series impacted other books in the DC line (such as TNT's appearance in Kandor in an issue of ''[[Superman Family]]'' that references events exclusively from ''Super Friends'', Sinestro's lack of a power ring in an issue of ''[[The Brave and The Bold]]'' after the ring was destroyed in a ''Super Friends'' issue, and Superman already being familiar with Dr. Mist and the international heroes in ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' after meeting them in ''Super Friends''). Because the Super Friends stories were referenced in and the events in them remembered by the characters in the core DC superhero titles - for example, in ''Justice League of America'' no. 155 (June 1978) - they have to be considered part of the pre-Crisis Earth 1 ensemble of stories.

In 2008, DC began publishing a new ''[[Imaginext#DC Super Friends|Super Friends]]'' comic book starring Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Flash and Green Lantern ([[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]]). Based on the eponymous [[Imaginext]] toyline, it is aimed at children, with an art style reminiscent to that of Marvel's ''[[Super Hero Squad]]''.

'''Collected Editions'''
*''Super Friends: For Justice!'' (Collects #1-7)
*''Super Friends: Calling All Super Friends'' (Collects #8-14)
*''Super Friends: Head of the Class'' (Collects #15-21)
*''Super Friends: Mystery In Space'' (Collects #22-28)

===''Extreme Justice''===
In the comics, the Wonder Twins were members of the short-lived ''[[Justice League International|JLI]]'' offshoot, ''[[Extreme Justice]]''.

===''Young Justice''===
''[[Young Justice]]'' was a comic series that followed the adventures of a group composed of the latest teen superheroes of the late 1990s and early 2000s, including [[Tim Drake|Robin]], [[Superboy]], [[Bart Allen|Impulse]] and [[Wonder Girl]].  Towards the end of the run, Young Justice was involved in a mission which required them to invade an island whose population was made up of super-villains.  In order to conduct a successful attack, the core team assembled all the then-known teen heroes (including the [[Wonder Twins]]).  As in ''Extreme Justice'', neither spoke English and both seemed to enjoy eating CDs.  Unlike their cartoon counterparts, the Wonder Twins were rude and sarcastic.

===''Super Buddies''===
{{Main|Super Buddies}}
The lighthearted nature of the show was spoofed in the 2000s with two DC [[miniseries]], ''Formerly Known as the Justice League'' and ''I Can’t Believe It’s Not the Justice League!'' (although these series were more direct take-offs on the 1980s [[Blue Beetle]]/[[Booster Gold]]-era [[Justice League]]). In these miniseries the group is known as the "Super Buddies", and consists of a team of ex-Justice League members. A television advertisement for the team shows them posing in the postures of the original ''Super Friends'' title card.

===''Teen Titans''===
As of issue #34 (2006), Wendy and Marvin were part of the DC continuity. They are now [[fraternal twin]]s (a nod to their ''Super Friends'' successors, the Wonder Twins), engineering geniuses (having graduated from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] at age 16), and are employed at [[Titans Tower]] as maintenance crew and mechanical troubleshooters. They were responsible for restoring Titans member [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] to full functionality after he sustained damage to his artificial body parts during the events of the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' mini-series.  Wonder Dog was also introduced into the series, although (unlike the cartoon) he was not a lovable sidekick but a murderous, shape-shifting demon dog who was sent to Titans Tower to kill the team. Wonder Dog killed Marvin and attacked Wendy, leaving her crippled from the waist down.  Wendy is a supporting character in the ''[[Stephanie Brown (comics)|Batgirl]]'' series, where she receives help accepting her disabilities from former Batgirl [[Barbara Gordon]].

===''Justice League of America''===
During the events of the 2005 company-wide ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' crossover the [[Justice League Watchtower]] was destroyed by [[Superboy-Prime]], leaving the JLA without a base of operations. To that end, the team established the Hall of Justice in Washington, D.C. to act as an embassy for the team and an emergency base of operations if needed. In the continuity of the comics, the Hall was designed by [[Green Lantern (John Stewart)|Green Lantern]] and Wonder Woman. In ''Justice League of America'' #46 (2010) [[Samurai (Super Friends)|Samurai]] made his first appearance in the [[DC Universe]], where he was shown as one of the heroes driven temporarily insane by [[Alan Scott]].

===''Wizard'' magazine===
An issue{{Issue|date=April 2009}} of ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' magazine parodied the Super Friends; the JLA was sent through a dimensional rift and met some of the Super Friends. After [[Martian Manhunter]] used his Martian vision to melt the villain and his machine (much to Green Lantern’s dismay: "You have to trick him into leaving, or shutting off his machine, NOT direct physical violence!"), the Super Friends decided to send the Justice Leaguers back to their own dimension. As a jest, the magazine also ran an [[April Fool's Day|April Fool's]] promotion for a Wonder Twins special by painter [[Alex Ross]]. The book, entitled ''Wonder Twins: Form of Water'', was to be one of Alex Ross' oversized books chronicling the Justice League. The plot would see Zan and Jayna using their powers to help the Earth's famine- and drought-stricken nations after their monkey, Gleek, contracted super-rabies from severe dehydration.

==Bumpers==
[[Cartoon Network]] produced three [[Bumper (broadcasting)|bumpers]] lampooning the Super Friends:
*One dealt with the [[idiosyncratic]] nature of the Legion of Doom and [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]]’s odd manner of dress (''Brainiac'': "Look, I just want some pants...a decent pair of pants!" ''[[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]]'': "Solomon Grundy want pants, too!").
*The second dealt with the [[Wonder Twins]]’ uselessness in battle (''Zan'': "I could get beaten by a sponge! It doesn’t even have to be an evil sponge!")
*The third, co-starring [[The Powerpuff Girls]], dealt with [[Aquaman]]’s useless powers (''Aquaman'': "My ability to talk to fish is of no use to us, [[Wonder Woman]]!") and the level of violence compared with recent cartoons. Wonder Woman and Aquaman look away while the Powerpuff Girls beat up the Legion of Doom, setting the Scarecrow on fire. Notable was Bubbles' double-entendre reply to Wonder Woman's compliment on how they were developing as superheroes: "One day we'll be as developed as you are". Lex Luthor (a villain with a salacious mind) began laughing; his underlings understood the joke and laughed as well. When a piece of the Hall of Doom's ceiling fell on Luthor's head, everyone laughed. When the Powerpuff Girls came crashing in, Luthor mispronounced their collective name as "The Powderpuff Girls", annoying the Powerpuff Girls and causing them to angrily correct him: "It's PowERpuff!" "No D!!"

[[Adult Swim]] has also produced bumpers parodying the Super Friends.  The first was a clip from the episode "The Time Trap", with [[Bleep censor|bleeping]] edited in to give the appearance of profanity. They produced similar clips using other [[Hanna-Barbera]] cartoons. In another bumper, they lampooned the manner in which the Super Friends described every action before completing it (e.g., "I need to reach my utility belt so that I may free myself!") In this commercial, the heroes went to a movie and struggled to find money for [[popcorn]].  Several bumpers consist of little more than Aquaman walking into a realistic photograph and then proceeding to dance to some rump-shaking music.

==Other DC programs==

===''Justice League Unlimited''===
The Legion of Doom appeared as the primary antagonists of the final season of ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', complete with the group's trademark skull-shaped lair from ''Super Friends''. Additionally, the Justice League's Metro Tower headquarters in Metropolis strongly resembled the Hall of Justice.

The '''Ultimen''', loosely based on characters created for the Super Friends, were briefly allies and later antagonists to the JLU. The Ultimen consisted of [[Apache Chief|Long Shadow]], [[Black Vulcan|Juice]], [[Samurai (Super Friends)|Wind Dragon]], [[Wonder Twins|Downpour and Shifter]]. The group appeared in the episode "Ultimatum", where it is revealed that they are clones created by [[Project Cadmus]].

===''The Batman''===
The animated series ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' featured a modified version of the ''[[JLA Watchtower]]'' which closely resembled the Hall of Justice.

===''Batman: The Brave and the Bold''===
The Hall of Justice appeared in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "Sidekicks Assemble!", with a pastiche of the music played when the Hall appeared in ''Super Friends''.

===''Smallville''===
The Wonder Twins appeared in the ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'' episode "Idol", with Zan played by [[David Gallagher]] and Jayna played by [[Allison Scagliotti]]. Gleek did not appear physically, but a cartoonish image of him was shown on each of the twins' cellphones.

===''Young Justice''===
The Hall of Justice was featured in ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' as the Justice League's decoy base of operations. Additionally, Wendy and Marvin appear as classmates of [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Conner Kent]] and [[Miss Martian|Megan Morse]]. The members of the [[Injustice League]] operate out of a base resembling the Legion's Hall of Doom.

In the second season, approximations of the minority members created for ''Super Friends'' (similar to the Ultimen example above) are introduced as teenagers given powers by the [[Reach (comics)|Reach]]. The group consists of Tye Longshadow (Apache Chief), Asami "Sam" Koizumi (Samurai), and Eduardo "Ed" Dorado Jr. (El Dorado). The exception is Black Vulcan, whose place is taken by [[Milestone Media]] hero [[Static (DC Comics)|Static]] (Black Lightning also appears in the series).

===''DC Nation Shorts''===
The title of the ''[[Super Best Friends Forever]]'' [[DC Nation Shorts]] is a play on the title ''Super Friends''. Additionally, Black Vulcan's costume can be seen in the background of the first ''[[Black Lightning]]'' short. The ''[[Just'a Lotta Animals#Farm League|Farm League]]'' carries several homages to the Super Friends including its narrator, characters used, and graphics.

==Video games==

===''Injustice: Gods Among Us''===
The Hall of Justice is a playable stage in ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]''.

==Toys==

===''Super Powers Collection''===
{{Main|Super Powers Collection}}
The Super Powers toy line (and associated tie-in merchandise) was based on the final two seasons of ''Super Friends''. Samurai, an original character from the show, and the Hall of Justice were both released. Plans for future waves from Super Powers would have also included El Dorado, Black Vulcan, and the Wonder Twins.

===''Justice League Unlimited''===
The toy line based on ''Justice League Unlimited'' released several figures created for ''Super Friends'', namely Apache Chief, Black Vulcan, and Samurai.

===''DC Super Friends''===
Fisher-Price began to produce DC Comics characters in a kid-friendly toyline named after the ''Super Friends''.

===''DC Universe Classics''===
{{Main|DC Universe Classics}}
Paying homage to Super Powers, DC Universe Classics produced original ''Super Friends'' characters such as Apache Chief, Black Vulcan, El Dorado, Samurai, and the Wonder Twins.

==Parodies==

===''Holy Musical B@man!''===
''Super Friends'' was mentioned at the end of the [[StarKid Productions]] musical ''[[Holy Musical B@man!]]''. At the end of the musical, Batman, Robin, Superman, and the Green Lantern form the Super Friends. This group consists of some of the members of the original Super Friends as well as some new additions.

===''That '70s Show''===
''Super Friends'' was spoofed in an episode of ''[[That '70s Show]]'' with a dream sequence where the "Super Pals" made fun of [[Eric Forman|Eric's]] Superman because [[Donna Pinciotti|Donna's]] Wonder Woman had given him a ring as a gift. "I got it at the mall!" she exclaims. The episode featured Eric Forman as Superman, Donna as Wonder Woman, Kelso as Batman, Fez as Aquaman and Hyde and Jackie as the Wonder Twins. Red was also featured as their nemesis "Dr. Bald", wearing Lex Luthor's green-and-purple costume.

===''The Fairly OddParents''===
In ''[[The Fairly OddParents]]'' episode "Power Pals", Timmy wished for better super-friends. As a result, he got a team of superheroes—the Power Pals—as "friends." The four characters parodied famous characters including Superman, Wonder Woman, Batman, and Aquaman, and came with their own narrator. Aspects of ''Super Friends'' were parodied such as randomly pressing beeping buttons (that flash in an equally random pattern) on any computer module, invisible vehicles (somehow the Power Pals could see a dent in the invisible rocket and could be seen from the outside, since only the rocket is invisible), the perceived uselessness of Aquaman parody Wet Willy’s ability to talk to fish and powerlessness outside of water and near-instantaneous travel to distant galaxies.

===MTV's ''The State''===
During a transition between two other [[sketch comedy|skit]]s on [[MTV]]'s ''[[The State (TV series)|The State]]'', there was a brief scene with members of the State dressed as Super Friends. The Flash ran in, informing them of an impending disaster. Superman then began assigning serious tasks to all of the members, finishing by saying "and Aquaman... go talk to some fish". The Super Friends then began laughing hysterically, while a visibly embarrassed Aquaman just stood there.

===''South Park''===
The ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[Super Best Friends]]" was a spoof of the series, depicting religious figures as a team of superheroes. The only member of the "Super Best Friends" who was not a religious figure is "Seaman", a spoof of Aquaman whose power was to talk to fish.
In "[[200 (South Park)|200]]" the parody was revisited. The opening sequence for the Super Best Friends took its cues from the ''Super Friends'' cartoon; each of the religious figures (except for [[Muhammad]], who was portrayed as a [[Pixelization#Alternative techniques|censor bar]] walking down a street) and Seaman's introductions resembled the ''Super Friends'' opening: [[Jesus]] was Superman, [[Buddha]] was Wonder Woman, [[Krishna]] was Batman and Seaman was [[Aquaman]]. [[Joseph Smith]] and [[Lao Tzu]] acted as Wendy and Marvin White.

In "[[201 (South Park)|201]]", [[Tom Cruise]]'s house was described as "The Legion of Doom Headquarters! (initially it is described as "The Legion of Doom Headquarters [awkward pause] which is Tom Cruise's house"). The episode "[[Krazy Kripples]]" features a Legion of Doom with [[Christopher Reeve]] as the leader. The episode "[[Spookyfish]]" featured a ''Super Friends''-style scene transition, with images of [[Barbra Streisand]]'s head superimposed over the trademark lens-flares.

===''Family Guy''===
In the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode "[[A Hero Sits Next Door]]", there was a cutaway joke involving [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] playing a game of strip poker with Wonder Woman. ''Super Friends''-style scene transitions appear twice in the episode.
In "[[Fast Times at Buddy Cianci Jr. High]]", Peter flashed back to the time he was a Wonder Twin, taking the form of Jayna's tampon.
In "[[Perfect Castaway]]", when Lois told Peter how well the family had been doing ever since she married Brian she mentioned that Meg went on a date with [[Ted Knight|the Super Friends' announcer]]. Then a scene shows Meg and the announcer in a car on a hill where the announcer says, "Meanwhile, underneath Meg Griffin's bra...".
In "[[No Meals on Wheels]]", Peter made a reference to the Mexican Super Friends; a non sequitur showed Mexican versions of superheroes, including "Mexican Superman" and "Mexican Batman".

In "[[It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One]]", when [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] ran for mayor she attempted to gain the "stupid vote" by claiming [[Adolf Hitler]] was working with the Legion of Doom to plot the assassination of [[Jesus]]. Shortly after this, the Legion of Doom's base rose from the lake and Lex Luthor asked the other Legion members how she knew their plans. Solomon Grundy admitted he "kinda dropped the ball on that one".
The opening of "[[Family Goy]]" parodied the opening sequence of ''Super Friends'' with Peter as Superman, Brian and Stewie as Batman and Robin respectively, Lois as Wonder Woman, Chris as Aquaman and Meg as....Meg.
In ''[[Something, Something, Something Dark Side]]'', shortly after Chris/Luke and Cleveland/R2-D2 landed on Dagobah, the Legion of Doom fortress rose from the swamp with the same narration and music. Chris/Luke yelled, "Not now!" and the fortress quickly sank.

===''Dexter's Laboratory''===
One of the backup segments in ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'' was called ''[[Dexter's Laboratory#The Justice Friends|Justice Friends]]''.  The title was derived from the [[Justice League of America|Justice League]] and ''Super Friends'', and the series made references to the superficial plot lines of the ''Super Friends'' shows.  However, the characters were parodies of [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] team (the Marvel equivalent of the Justice League/Super Friends).

===Heavy.com===
An ongoing animated series, featuring controversial celebrities [[Paris Hilton]], [[Nicole Richie]], [[Lindsay Lohan]], and the [[Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen|Olsen twins]] in the roles of tasteless superheroes, was created in 2006 by [[Heavy.com]]. Both the setting and some of the girls’ superpowers were plays on elements from ''Super Friends''.

===''Mad''===
In early episodes of the animated series ''[[Mad (TV series)|Mad]]'', a few of the PSAs were remade which it was called "Super Villains". There have currently been two of these, one about health and the other about safety. In one sketch, Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman are convinced to change the name of the Super Friends after a musical appeal by fellow heroes.
