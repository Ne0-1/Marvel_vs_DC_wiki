'''''Super Friends''''' is an [[animated series]] about a team of [[superhero]]es which ran from [[1973]] to [[1985]].  It was produced by [[Hanna-Barbera]] and is based on the [[Justice League]] and associated [[comic book]] characters published by [[DC Comics]].

==History==

When animation company [[Hanna-Barbera]] obtained the licensing rights to the DC Comics characters and adapted the Justice League comic to [[television]], it made several changes in the transition, not the least of which was the change of name to the "Super Friends." The violence common in superhero comics was toned down for a younger audience. The primary characters featured in the series were [[Superman]], [[Batman]], [[Robin (Batman)|Robin]], [[Wonder Woman]] and [[Aquaman]], along with original sidekicks Wendy and Marvin, and later sidekicks Zan and Jayna the [[Wonder Twins]]. The other members of the Justice League were not regularly featured except as guest stars.

The [[Legion of Doom]] was a team of recurring foes made up of the Super Friends' worst enemies. A number of original superheroes (such as [[Black Vulcan]] and [[Apache Chief]]), many of them intended to be international heroes, were created for the show as well in order to encourage racial and cultural diversity. Critics felt that these attempts were awkward at best and very stereotypical and somewhat offensive at worst.
