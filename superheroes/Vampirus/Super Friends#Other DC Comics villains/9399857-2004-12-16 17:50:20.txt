'''''Super Friends''''' is an [[animated series]] about a team of [[superhero]]es which ran from [[1973]] to [[1985]].  It was produced by [[Hanna-Barbera]] and is based on the [[Justice League]] and associated [[comic book]] characters published by [[DC Comics]].

==History==

When animation company [[Hanna-Barbera]] obtained the licensing rights to the DC Comics characters and adapted the Justice League comic to [[television]], it made several changes in the transition, not the least of which was the change of name to the "Super Friends." The violence common in superhero comics was toned down for a younger audience. The primary characters featured in the series were [[Superman]], [[Batman]] and [[Robin (Batman)|Robin]], [[Wonder Woman]], and [[Aquaman]]. Their first sidekicks were Wendy and Marvin and their mutt Wonderdog, none of whom had any special abilities; later these were replaced by Zan and Jayna the [[Wonder Twins]] and the space monkey [[Gleek (Superfriends)|Gleek]]. The other members of the Justice League were not regularly featured except as guest stars, such as [[The Flash]] and [[Green Lantern]].

In the earlier years, each episode was a single hour-long story, and the villians were often misguided, rather than evil.  In later episodes, there were two or more short stories in each hour.

The [[Legion of Doom]] was a team of recurring foes made up of the Super Friends' worst enemies.

A number of original superheroes (such as [[Black Vulcan]] and [[Apache Chief]]) intended to be international heroes, were created for the show as well in order to encourage racial and cultural diversity. Critics felt that these attempts were awkward at best and very stereotypical and somewhat offensive at worst.
