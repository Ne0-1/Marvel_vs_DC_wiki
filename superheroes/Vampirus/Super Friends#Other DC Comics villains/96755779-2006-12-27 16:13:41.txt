'''''Super Friends''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[animated television series]] about a team of [[superhero]]es which ran from [[1973 in television|1973]] to [[1986 in television|1986]]. It was produced by [[Hanna-Barbera]] and is based on the [[Justice League]] and associated [[comic book]] characters published by [[DC Comics]].

==History==
When animation company [[Hanna-Barbera]] licensed the animation rights to the DC Comics characters and adapted the ''[[Justice League|Justice League of America]]'' comic book for [[television]], it made several changes in the transition, not the least of which was the change of name to ''Super Friends''. In part, it was feared that the name ''Justice League of America'' would have seemed too [[jingoistic]] during the post-[[Vietnam War]] Era. Nevertheless, team members sometimes referred to themselves as the Justice League on the show. The violence common in [[superhero]] [[comic books|comics]] was toned down for a younger audience, as well as to fit with the restrictive broadcast standards regarding violence in [[1970s]] [[Saturday morning cartoons|children's television]]. 

The primary characters featured in the series were [[Superman]], [[Batman]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], [[Wonder Woman]], and [[Aquaman]]. Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman are generally considered DC's flagship characters. Aquaman had previously appeared in his own animated series produced by [[Filmation]], as had both Superman and Batman. Shortly before the ''Super Friends'' series was developed, Superman and Wonder Woman guest-starred in two episodes of ''[[The Brady Kids]]'', while Batman and Robin appeared in two episodes of [[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]. The team's first sidekicks were [[Wendy Harris (Super Friends)|Wendy Harris]] (voiced by [[Sherry Alberoni|Sherri Alberoni]]) and [[Marvin White (Super Friends)|Marvin White]] (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]) and their [[dog]] [[Wonderdog]], none of whom had any special abilities (save the dog's unexplained ability to reason and "talk"). Marvin and Wonderdog did exhibit a levitation ability in one episode; however, it was only for comedic effect, and never shown or mentioned again. Starting with the third season, they were replaced by pointy-eared [[shapeshifting]] [[extraterrestrials]] Zan and Jayna, the "[[Wonder Twins]]," and their "space [[monkey]]" [[Gleek (Super Friends)|Gleek]]. Earlier seasons occasionally introduced other members of the Justice League as guest stars, including [[Flash (comics)|The Flash]], [[Plastic Man]], and [[Green Arrow]].

Initially, during the Wendy and Marvin years, each episode was a single one-hour story, and the villains (mostly original creations not in the comics) were often misguided, rather than evil. Subsequent seasons were a mix of one-hour and half-hour episodes, the one-hour episodes sometimes featuring two or more short stories in each hour, and made use of established villains from the DC comics. The ''Challenge of the Superfriends'' season introduced the [[Legion of Doom]], a team of 13 recurring foes comprised of the Super Friends' worst enemies. They used a swamp-based, mechanical, flying headquarters, the Hall of Doom (which suspiciously resembled the helmet of [[Darth Vader]]), as a suitable contrast with the Super Friends' gleaming [[Hall of Justice]].

Hanna-Barbera's writers experimented with team composition as well. ''Challenge of the Superfriends'' kept the teen sidekicks, but they were not directly involved with the super-villain stories. It also added [[Hawkman]], [[Green Lantern]], and [[Flash (comics)|The Flash]] as well as three characters without previous comic-book [[antecedent]]s: [[Black Vulcan]] (who appears to have been based on a minor DC character, [[Black Lightning]]; see Trivia below), [[Apache Chief]] and [[Samurai (superhero)|Samurai]].  These last three were intended to be international heroes and were created in order to encourage racial and [[cultural diversity]]. Critics felt that these attempts were, at best, awkward and, at worst, very stereotypical and somewhat offensive. Subsequent versions of the show resulted in a fourth "diversity" hero, [[El Dorado (superhero)|El Dorado]], and guest stars who had also appeared in DC comics, including [[Rima|Rima the Jungle Girl]] (a Tarzan-like character similar to [[Sheena, Queen of the Jungle]] and Marvel Comics' [[Shanna the She-Devil]]), [[Hawkgirl]] and the [[Ray Palmer (comics)|Atom]]. During ''Challenge of the Superfriends'' original run, sixteen more episodes were made. These episodes were shown during the original season of the show (and possibly again during the 1980s in syndicated re-runs) but were not shown when Cartoon Network aired the show. These episodes may have been the "craft segment shorts" remembered by some who watched the show during its original run (or in syndication). In one episode, Aquaman demonstrates how to make a kazoo out of wax paper and a comb.

The final two seasons, ''Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show'' and ''Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians'', (the "''Super Powers''" tag reflected a marketing tie-in with a [[Super Powers Collection|toyline of the same name]] produced by [[Kenner]]<ref>[http://toyotter.com/sp/ toyotter.com]</ref>) made further refinements to the roster, adding teen members [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] and [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]], each with a comics history. The tone of these last two seasons, in particular the ''Galactic Guardians'' version, was notably more serious than ''Super Friends'' had been in the past (possibly due to the success [[NBC]] was having with their own Saturday morning cartoon series ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]''). This was reflected with the introduction of [[Darkseid]] and his minions on [[Apokolips]] as recurring villains in these episodes. The series in these last two seasons ceased trying to be so much a "kid-friendly" version of the DC characters and mythos, and began targeting a slightly older audience with more of an emphasis on action as opposed to morality lessons in the guise of superhero stories.  In particular, the ''Galactic Guardians'' series featured a notable first: in the episode "The Fear", Batman's origin is told for the first time outside of the actual comics.

==Trivia==
{{toomuchtrivia}}
*The commanding voice of the Narrator was provided by actor [[Ted Knight]] during the early hour-long episodes. His signature line was, "Meanwhile, at the Hall of Justice!" [[William Woodson]] took over once they dropped the original format.
*Wendy, Marvin, and Wonder Dog were inspired by the [[Scooby-Doo]] gang. The voice of both Marvin and  Wonder Dog were both performed by [[Frank Welker]] who also did the voice of the Scooby Doo gang's Fred.
*In one episode where a giant [[Krypton (planet)|Krypton]]ian [[pteranodon]] (based on [[Rodan]]) is rampaging on Earth, the team must choose whether they should acquire a massive supply of [[kryptonite]] to drive it off and risk Superman's life in the process. Superman asserts that the team has a long-standing principle of seeking "the greatest good for the greatest number" and insists that the kryptonite be used. The quote is taken from [[Frances Hutcheson]] and introduced the ethical principles of [[utilitarianism]] to viewers. 
*The [[Hall of Justice]] from the Super Friends can be seen in the ''[[Teen Titans (animated series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series. It appears behind the [[Titans Tower]] in the opening sequence and uses of the same shot in the show.
*After [[Olan Soule]] served as the voice of [[Batman]] on the show for several years, he turned the part over to none other than the man who played Batman on the live action [[Batman (TV series)|60s TV]] series, [[Adam West]], for the ''Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show'' and ''Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians'' series. For these seasons, Olan instead played the voice of [[Professor Martin Stein]], one half of [[Firestorm the Nuclear Man]].
*The opening credits of ''Challenge of the Super Friends'' names the Super Friends as the [[Justice League of America]]. In addition to the appearance of a JLA emblem on a communicator and a reference to a mission to repair the Justice League satellite, the Super Friends are often linked with the JLA.
*In that mission, the Justice League satellite under repair is clearly the same design as the [[Justice League Satellite]] that appeared in the comics at the time, but was shown to be substantially smaller than its comic book counterpart, and thus uninhabitable.
*The ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'' episode "MC Pee Pants" uses backgrounds taken from the ''Challenge of the Superfriends'' episode "Monolith of Evil" for the location of Hell.
* 'The Hall of Justice' as often seen in the cartoon, seems to have a striking resemblance to the [[Cincinnati Museum Center at Union Terminal|Union Terminal building]] in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]. Once a train station, it is now a museum. It seems likely that the animators copied the design from this or a similar building.

==Comics==
===Super Friends===
[[DC Comics]] published a [[comic book]] version of the Super Friends in the [[1970s]]. The ''Super Friends'' comic was written to a higher standard than the television show, and Zan and Jayna were given backstories and secret identities as a pair of blond-haired high school kids; they were more competent heroes in general than their cartoon counterparts.
*While the cartoons weren't canon with DC Comics, writer [[E. Nelson Bridwell]] would try to make it into canon by footnotes.  Though, many fans would address the matter in letter columns by addressing the SF stories on Earth-1A.[http://forums.toonzone.net/showthread.php?t=147426&page=2]  An example of trying to fit Superfriends into the DC Universe:
**Wendy, Marvin and Wonder Dog are the only ones active at the Hall Of Justice because the Justice League are in the 30th Century with the [[Justice Society]] as shown in [[Justice League Of America]] #147-148.  Robin is busy helping the Titans in [[Teen Titans]] #50-52.

While the show never explained the departure of Wendy, Marvin and Wonder Dog, the story is found in Super Friends #6-9.

===Super Buddies===
The lighthearted nature of the show was partially spoofed in the [[2000s]] with two DC [[miniseries]], ''Formerly Known As the Justice League'' and ''I Can't Believe It's Not the Justice League!'' (although these series were more direct take-offs on the 1980s Blue Beetle/Booster Gold-era [[Justice League]]). In these miniseries, the group is known as the "Super Buddies,"  and consists of a team of various ex-[[Justice League]] members. Writer Keith Giffen has stated that his original proposal was titled ''1-800-SUPERFRIENDS''.

===Teen Titans===
In #34 ([[2006]]), Wendy and Marvin are now part of DC continuity. They are now [[Twin#fraternal twins|fraternal twins]] (a possible nod to their ''Super Friends'' successors, the Wonder Twins), engineering geniuses (apparently having graduated from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] at sixteen), and are employed at [[Titans Tower]] as maintenance crew and all-around mechanical troubleshooters.  They were responsible for restoring Titans member [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] to full functions after he sustained damage to his artificial body parts during the events of the [[Infinite Crisis]] mini-series and publishing event.

===Wizard Magazine===
An issue parodied the Super Friends, in which the JLA is sent through a dimensional rift and meets some members of the Super Friends. After Martian Manhunter simply uses his martian vision to melt the villain and his machine, much to Green Lantern's dismay (''"You have to trick him into leaving, or shutting off his machine, NOT direct physical violence!"'') the Super Friends decided to send the JLA'ers back to their own dimension. The Wonder Twins turned into water and a bug and paddling, Green Lantern shone his ring on them, Flash ran around them a lot, and Aquaman stood around until water could be introduced at a convienent manner. Despite the fact that their plan made no sense scientifically, it worked and restored the JLA'ers to their proper world.

===Alex Ross===
Noted painter [[Alex Ross]] is an avowed fan of the show and has worked it into his various projects.
*''[[Kingdom Come]]'' - The United Nations building resembles the [[Hall of Justice]] while the [[Gulag]] is obviously designed on the [[Hall of Doom]]. Marvin can also be spotted in a brief cameo in that book.
*''Justice'' - A current 12-issue miniseries series in which a new and improved [[Legion of Doom]] clashes with the JLA.

==Bumpers==
[[Cartoon Network]] produced three commercials lampooning the Super Friends.
*One dealt with the [[idiosyncratic]] nature of the Legion of Doom and [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]]'s odd manner of dress (''Brainiac'': "Look, all I want is pants... a decent pair of pants!" ''[[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]]'': "Solomon Grundy want pants, too!").
*The second dealt with the [[Wonder Twins]]' uselessness in battle (''Zan'': "I could get beaten by a sponge! It doesn't even have to be an evil sponge!").
*The third, co-starring the [[Powerpuff Girls]], dealt with [[Aquaman]]'s useless powers (''Aquaman'': "My ability to talk to fish is of no use to us, [[Wonder Woman]]!") as well as the level of violence compared to today's cartoons, as Wonder Woman and Aquaman look away while the Powerpuff Girls beat up the Legion of Doom.

==Parody==
===Earthworm Jim Special Edition===
At the end of the game's Easy Mode ending, [[Doug TenNapel]] proclaims, ''"Meanwhile, at the Hall of Justice, Superman, Batman and Jan and Zeyna, uh- the Wonder Twins. They've... pronounced that it's the end. We're not kidding. Uhh... really!"''

===That '70s Show===
''Super Friends'' was spoofed in an episode with a dream sequence where the "Super Pals" made fun of [[Eric Forman|Eric's]] Superman because [[Donna Pinciotti|Donna's]] Wonder Woman had given him a ring as a gift. ''"I got it at the mall!"'' she exclaims.

===Maritess vs the Super Friends=== 
[[Philippines|Filipino]] comedian [[Rex Navarrete]] gave a satirized depiction of the Super Friends in his comedy routine about Maritess, a Filipina immigrant who worked as the Super Friends' [[maid]] at the Hall of Justice. This was made into a short [[Macromedia Flash]] animation by [[Dino Ignacio]]. [http://www.fractalcow.com/rex/]

===''Justice League''===
In '''Secret Origins, Part 3''', when Superman proposes the idea of a team, Flash responds "What, you mean like a bunch of... super friends?"

====Justice League Unlimited====
A first season episode of the [[Cartoon Network]] television series featured The [[Ultimen]], a group of superheroes that are a [[pastiche]] of heroes unique to the Super Friends. The members were [[Long Shadow]] (based on Apache Chief), [[Wind Dragon]] (Samurai), [[Juice (Justice League Unlimited)|Juice]] (Black Vulcan), [[Downpour]] (Zan of the Wonder Twins), and [[Shifter (Justice League Unlimited)|Shifter]] (Jayna of the Wonder Twins). The headquarters of the Ultimen, although on top of a [[skyscraper]], resembled the Super Friends' Hall of Justice. Of note also is that the JLU heroes featured in this episode was the line up of the original Superfriends, save for Robin as the concurrent [[Teen Titans]] cartoon series meant that no Bat-heroes beyond Batman himself could be used in the JLU.

===The Fairly Oddparents===
In the episode "Power Pals," Timmy wishes for bigger, better, super friends. As a result, he gets a team of superheroes - the Power Pals - as "friends." The four characters parody Superman, Wonder Woman, Batman, and Aquaman, and come with their own narrator. Various aspects of the Super Friends were parodied, such as randomly pressing beeping buttons (that flash in an equally random pattern) on any computer module, invisible vehicles (somehow, the Power Pals are able to recognize a dent in the invisible rocket, and can be seen from the outside as only the rocket is invisible), the uselessness of Aquaman's (Wet Willy's) ability to talk to fish and powerlessness outside of water, and near-instantaneous travel to distant galaxies.

===South Park===
The episode, ''[[Super Best Friends]]'', is a spoof on this series and depicts religious figures such as [[Jesus]], [[Krishna]] and so on as a team of superheroes. The only member of "The Super Best Friends" who is not a religious figure is "Seaman" (pronounced [[semen]]), a spoof on Aquaman whose power is to talk to fish (referring to the fact that fans have viewed Aquaman, as seen in Super Friends, as a joke).

===Superficial Friends===
An ongoing animated series featuring controversial celebrities [[Paris Hilton]], [[Nicole Richie]], [[Lindsay Lohan]], and [[Olsen Twins|The Olsen Twins]] in the roles of tasteless superheroes, created in [[2006]] by [[Heavy.com]].  Both the setting and the some of the girls' superpowers are plays on elements from the ''Super Friends.''
