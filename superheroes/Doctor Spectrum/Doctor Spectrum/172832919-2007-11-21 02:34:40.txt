'''Doctor Spectrum''' is the name of five different [[fictional character|fictional]] [[comic-book]] characters in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Multiverse|multiverse]]. <ref>This numbering is confirmed by the ''[[Official Handbook to the Marvel Universe]]: Alternate Worlds 2005''</ref> There have been five versions of the character to date - three supervillains from the mainstream Marvel universe belonging to the team [[Squadron Sinister]] ([[Earth-616]]) and two heroes from different alternate universes. The two heroes each belong to a version of the team Squadron Supreme (the [[Squadron Supreme]] of [[Earth-712]] and the [[Squadron Supreme (Supreme Power)|Squadron Supreme]] of [[Earth-31916]] respectively). 

== Publication history ==

The Doctor Spectrum ('''Joseph Ledger''') from Earth-3196 has featured in a limited series. <ref>''Doctor Spectrum: Full Spectrum'' #1 - 6 (2004 - 2005)</ref>

== Fictional character biography ==

''To avoid confusion, the biography is separated into two sections that describe both the villainous and heroic versions of Doctor Spectrum.''

=== Doctor Spectrum - the supervillains ===
==== Kenji Obatu ====
The first Doctor Spectrum appears as a member of the [[Squadron Sinister]], a group of supervillains assembled by the cosmic entity the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]] to battle the champions of the time-travelling [[Kang (comics)|Kang]] - the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. <ref>'''NOTE''' - It was revealed years later that the Grandmaster created the Squadron Sinister based on the ''already existing'' Squadron Supreme. The Avengers simply met the "copies" first. What adds to the confusion for readers is the fact that the covers of ''Avengers'' vol. 1, #85 and 141 promote the Squadron Sinister, when in fact it is the Squadron Supreme that appear on both occasions.</ref> In this first encounter, the hero [[Iron Man]] defeats Doctor Spectrum by exposing him to ultra-violet light, which neutralizes the abilities of his Power Prism (see '''Powers and abilities'''). <ref>''Avengers'' vol. 1, #69</ref> This version of Doctor Spectrum later seeks revenge against Iron Man, but is defeated once again after a lengthy battle. On this occasion Iron Man crushes the Power Prism, leaving the Obatu Doctor Spectrum powerless, who is subsequently arrested and deported back to his native Africa. <ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 1, #63 - 66</ref>

==== Billy Roberts ====
Unknown to Iron Man, the Power Prism reforms and is found by a sanitation worker, who eventually brings it to [[Evangelism|evangelist]] Billy Roberts, who after learning of the Prism's abilities becomes the second Doctor Spectrum. <ref>Seen in flashback in ''Avengers'' Annual #8 (1978)</ref> The second Doctor Spectrum then assists the original members of the Squadron Sinister, who together with the alien [[Nebulon (comics)|Nebulon]] attempt to flood the Earth, but are stopped by the superhero team the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. <ref>''Defenders'' vol. 1, #13 - 14</ref> After this defeat the Squadron Sinister are teleported off world by Nebulon, but are later returned to Earth. Having acquired an energy-draining weapon, the Squadron Sinister plan to threaten the Earth once more but are defeated by the Defenders and the Avenger [[Yellowjacket (comics)|Yellowjacket]]. <ref>''Giant-Size Defenders'' #4 (1974)</ref>

After this defeat, the Power Prism is kept by Yellowjacket, who decides to modify the gem and present it to his wife Janet Van Dyne (also a fellow Avenger - the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]]).
The Power Prism seizes control of the Wasp and transforms her into a mind-controlled female Dr. Spectrum, who battles several Avengers but is then defeated. The Power Prism bonds to the Wasp in an attempt to save itself, but is eventually removed by Billy Roberts after he is located by the Avengers. Roberts becomes Doctor Spectrum once more, although on this occasion the Power Prism is in control and seeks to bond with the most powerful Avenger, the Thunder God [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. The Power Prism succeeds in doing so, but fails to take into account that to wield the mystic hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]], Thor must be "worthy". Thor drops Mjolnir and reverts back to his mortal alter-ego [[Donald Blake]], which results in the Power Prism losing control and becoming inert, apparently forever. <ref>''Avengers'' Annual #8 (1978)</ref>

==== Alice Nugent ====
Years later, another Power Prism appears and bonds itself to Alice Nugent, a former lab assistant of [[Henry Pym]] (also known as the Avenger Yellowjacket). <ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 1, #191</ref> Becoming the third Doctor Spectrum, Nugent is coerced by the Grandmaster into joining a revamped Squadron Sinister, which battles the superhero team the [[New Thunderbolts]]. <ref>New Thunderbolts #15 - 16 + ''Thunderbolts'' #102 - 108</ref>

=== Doctor Spectrum - the superheroes ===
==== Joseph Ledger (Earth-712) ====<!-- This section is linked from [[America Redeemers]] -->
Joseph "Joe" Ledger is a former astronaut, who during a space mission saves the life of an alien called the [[Skrullian Skymaster]]. The grateful [[Skrull]] gives Joe Ledger the Power Prism, a gem capable of synthesizing energy. Ledge becomes the hero Doctor Spectrum and eventually joins the team the Squadron Supreme. Dr. Spectrum and the other members of the team are first encountered by four Avengers, who accidentally cross into the Earth-712 universe. The Avengers first battle then assist the Squadron Supreme against a global threat before returning to their own universe. <ref>''Avengers'' vol. 1, #85 - 86</ref> Doctor Spectrum and the Squadron Supreme later battle the Avengers once again, who help to free the Squadron's Earth from the influence of the artifact the [[Serpent Crown]]. <ref>''Avengers'' vol. 1, #141 - 144 + 147 - 149</ref>

Doctor Spectrum goes on to play a significant role when the Squadron Supreme decide to take over their Earth and fashion it into a [[utopia]], but after a deadly battle with several dissenting team members learns the error of his ways. <ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #1 - 12 (1985 - 1986)</ref>
He and the surviving members of the Squadron Supreme later cross over into the Earth-616 universe and assist the Avengers against the villain the [[Nth Man (comics)|Nth Man]], although after this mission the team find themselves unable to return to the Earth-712 universe. <ref>''Squadron Supreme:Death of a Universe'' (1989)</ref>

Doctor Spectrum and the Squadron Supreme reside at the government facility [[Project Pegasus]] for a time, before assisting the Avengers against the villain Imus Champion and then finding the means to return to their universe. <ref>''Quasar'' #13 - 16 + 19 and ''Avengers'' vol. 3, #5 - 6 + Annual 1998</ref> The team disband on returning home, then reunite to stop corporate corruption, with Doctor Spectrum being the first to assist fellow hero [[Hyperion (comics)|Hyperion]]. <ref>''Squadron Supreme:New World Order'' (1998)</ref> Soon after this Dr. Spectrum and the team also aid the team the [[Exiles (comics)|Exiles]]. <ref>''Exiles'' #77 - 78</ref>

==== Joseph Ledger (Earth-31916)====
[[Image:Dr.Spectrum-2.jpg|right|thumb|The Doctor Spectrum (Joseph Ledger) from the Earth-31916 universe in ''Doctor Spectrum'' #2 (2004). Art by [[Dale Keown]]]]
Joseph Ledger is a soldier in the United States Army who accidentally bonds with a crystal found in the vessel that brought Hyperion to Earth. <ref>''Supreme Power'' #1 - 6 (2003 - 2004)</ref> The experience places Ledger in a coma, and after reliving his life in his mind for the benefit of the apparently sentient crystal awakens and adopts the codename of Doctor Spectrum. <ref>''[[Doctor Spectrum: Full Spectrum]]'' #1 - 6 (2004 - 2005)</ref> Operating in a military-style uniform as opposed to a prismatic costume, Doctor Spectrum encounters and battles Hyperion, and later forms a truce with him to hunt down a super-powered serial killer. It is at this time that Doctor Spectrum also begins a tentative romance with fellow superhuman [[Amphibian (comics)|Amphibian]]. <ref> Supreme Power #7 - 18 (2005 - 2006)</ref> Both eventually join the US-backed [[Squadron Supreme (Supreme Power)|Squadron Supreme]]. <ref>''Squadron Supreme'' vol. 2, #1 (2006)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==

All versions of Doctor Spectrum derive their abilities from an alien gem called the Power Prism. The original prism, used by the Kenji Obatu and Billy Roberts versions of Doctor Spectrum, is in fact sentient. The Power Prism had previously been a [[Skrull]] called Krimonn, who after failing to usurp the Skrull Emperor was transformed into a prism. <ref>Shown in flashback in ''Iron Man'' vol. 1, #63 - 66</ref> When the Grandmaster requires champions to battle the Avengers, he retrieves the prism, and after granting Krimonn several energy-based powers that can be used in conjunction with a host, unites the prism with Kenji Obatu, who first uses the term "Power Prism." Although trapped in prism form, Krimonn remains aggressive and asserts his will via telepathy over Kenji Obatu, but is later "muted" by Nebulon when Billy Roberts is in possession of the Power Prism. Krimonn reasserts himself during his quest to find and use Thor, but when the plan fails and the gem is shattered, his consciousness apparently dissipated forever.

The powers bestowed on Krimonn in prism form include flight; energy projection and manipulation; protection from the rigors of space and in the case of the original Doctor Spectrum - Kenji Obatu - an ability to pass through solid objects. The Power Prisms of Earth-616 and Earth-712 have one weakness: being vulnerable to ultra-violet light. The alien Prism from Earth-31916 apparently does not have this weakness.
