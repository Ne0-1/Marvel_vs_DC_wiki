===Doctor Spectrum—the supervillains===

====Kenji Obatu====
The first villainous version appears in the final panel of ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' #69 (Oct. 1969), the first chapter of a three-issue storyline by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and penciller [[Sal Buscema]]. The story arc introduced the [[supervillain]] team the [[Squadron Sinister]], whose four members were loosely based on heroes in [[DC Comics]]' [[Justice League of America]], with Doctor Spectrum based on [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]].<ref>Interview with Roy Thomas and Jerry Bails in ''The Justice League Companion'' (2003) pp. 72 – 73</ref>

The Squadron Sinister are created by the cosmic entity the [[Grandmaster (comics)|Grandmaster]] to battle the champions of the time-traveling [[Kang (comics)|Kang]]—the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. Doctor Spectrum battles the Avenger [[Iron Man]], and is defeated when the hero deduces that the villain's '''Power Prism''' (a [[sentient]] entity called Krimonn) is vulnerable to [[ultra-violet light]]. The Avengers eventually defeat the Squadron and they in turn are abandoned by the Grandmaster.<ref>''Avengers'' #69–71 (Oct.–Dec. 1969)</ref> Doctor Spectrum reappears in the title ''Iron Man'' and after a series of battles is defeated when Iron Man crushes the Power Prism. A powerless Obatu is arrested and deported back to his native [[Uganda]].<ref name="autogenerated1973">''Iron Man'' #63–65 (Oct.–Dec. 1973) & 66 (Feb. 1974)</ref> During a subsequent battle with The [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] and [[Brother Voodoo]], Obatu accidentally falls to his death.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #41</ref>

====Billy Roberts====
Unknown to Iron Man, the Power Prism reforms and is found by a [[sanitation worker]], who eventually brings it to [[Evangelism|evangelist]] Billy Roberts, who after learning of the Prism's abilities becomes the second Doctor Spectrum.<ref>''Avengers'' Annual #8 (1978)</ref>

The Squadron reappear in the title [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], reunited by the [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[Nebulon (comics)|Nebulon]] (although the team is unaware of the fact that this a new Doctor Spectrum). The villains receive greater power in exchange for the planet Earth, and create a giant laser cannon in the [[Arctic]] to melt the [[polar ice caps]], thereby covering the entirety of the Earth's surface in water. The superhero team the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] prevent the scheme and defeat the Squadron (and Nebulon), with [[Doctor Strange]] defeating Doctor Spectrum.<ref>''Defenders'' #13–14 (May–July 1974)</ref> After this defeat Doctor Spectrum and his two remaining team mates are teleported off world by Nebulon, returning with an energy-draining weapon. The Squadron Sinister plan to threaten the Earth again but are defeated once again by the Defenders and the Avenger [[Hank Pym|Yellowjacket]].<ref>''Giant-Size Defenders'' #4 (1974)</ref>

The Power Prism is kept by Yellowjacket, who decides to modify the gem and present it to his wife [[Janet Van Dyne]] (also the Avenger known as the Wasp). Krimonn, the entity within the Power Prism, possesses Jan and transforms her into a villainous female Doctor Spectrum, who battles several Avengers but is then defeated by the Vision's use of the Prism's ultraviolet weakness (Krimonn assumed in his arrogance that Iron Man had kept that information to himself rather than sharing it with others, thus 'giving up an advantage'). The prism itself bonds to the Wasp in an attempt to save itself, but is eventually removed by Billy Roberts after he is located by the Avengers. Roberts becomes Doctor Spectrum once more, although on this occasion the Power Prism is in control and seeks to bond with the most powerful Avenger, the Thunder God [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. The Power Prism succeeds in taking Thor as a host, infecting [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]] to use as a focal point to control him and defeat the other Avengers, but fails to take into account that to wield Mjolnir, Thor must be "worthy". No longer worthy to wield the hammer due to him being tainted by the gem, Thor drops Mjolnir and reverts to his mortal alter-ego Donald Blake during a fight with Iron Man, which results in the Power Prism losing control and becoming inert, apparently forever.<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #8 (1978)</ref>

====Alice Nugent====
The Grandmaster reappears and reforms the Squadron Sinister: an apparently resurrected [[Hyperion (comics)|Hyperion]] is joined by the [[Whizzer (comics)|Whizzer]] (now called [[Speed Demon (comics)|Speed Demon]]); [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Nighthawk]] and a new Doctor Spectrum (complete with Power Prism)—Alice Nugent, former lab assistant of Henry Pym. Courtesy of a phenomenon known as the "Wellspring of Power"—an interdimensional source of superhuman abilities—the Grandmaster increases the Squadron Sinister's powers and they battle the New Thunderbolts. Thunderbolts team leader [[Baron Zemo]] defeats the Grandmaster, and in the ensuing chaos Doctor Spectrum and the members of the Squadron Sinister scatter and escape.<ref>''New Thunderbolts'' #15–16 (Jan.–Feb. 2006) and ''Thunderbolts'' #102–108 (July 2006 – Jan. 2007)</ref>

====Kenji Obatu II====
An alternate version of the original Doctor Spectrum later appears on [[Battleworld]]. This version of the character is Japanese rather than Ugandan.<ref name="Squadron Sinister #1">''Squadron Sinister'' #1</ref>

===Doctor Spectrum—the superheroes===
====Joseph Ledger (Earth-712)====<!-- This section is linked from [[America Redeemers]] -->
{{see also|Squadron Supreme}}
Roy Thomas and penciller [[John Buscema]] created an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate-universe]] team of heroes called the [[Squadron Supreme]], who debut in ''The Avengers'' #85 (Feb. 1971). After an initial skirmish with four Avengers, the teams unite to stop a common threat.<ref>''The Avengers'' #86 (Mar. 1971)</ref> The characters (including Doctor Spectrum) were identical in name and appearance to the Squadron Sinister, which caused confusion in Marvel's production department, as the covers of ''The Avengers'' #85 and #141 (Nov. 1975) "cover-blurbed" appearances by the Squadron Sinister, when in fact it was the Squadron Supreme that appeared in both issues.

The heroic Doctor Spectrum and the Squadron Supreme have another series of skirmishes with the Avengers engineered by the group the '''Serpent Cartel''', but eventually team together and prevent the use of the [[Magic item|artifact]] the [[Serpent Crown]].<ref>''Avengers'' #141–144 (Nov. 1975 – Feb. 1976) & #147–149 (May–July 1976)</ref> The character and his teammates briefly feature in the title ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'', when the evil version of [[Hyperion (comics)#Zhib-Ran|Hyperion]] attacks the Earth-712 version and then Thunder God Thor.<ref>''Thor'' #280 (Feb. 1979)</ref> The Squadron are mind-controlled by the entities the [[Overmind (comics)|Over-Mind]] and [[Null, the Living Darkness|Null the Living Darkness]], but are freed by the Defenders and aid the heroes in defeating the villains.<ref>''Defenders'' #112–114 (Oct.–Dec. 1982)</ref>

The character features with the Squadron Supreme in a self-titled 12-issue [[miniseries]] (Sept. 1985 – Aug. 1986) by writer [[Mark Gruenwald]].<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #1–12 (Sep. 1985 – Aug. 1986)</ref> Gruenwald revealed each member's origin, with Joseph Ledger being a former [[astronaut]] who saves a [[Skrull]] in [[space]]. The grateful Skrull, called the [[Skrullian Skymaster]], rewards Ledger with the Power Prism. The series also explains why the Squadrons Sinister and Supreme are similar: the Grandmaster creates the Squadron Sinister modelled on the already-existing Squadron Supreme of the [[Earth-712]] universe.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' #8 (May 1986)</ref>
Gruenwald, Ryan, and [[inker]] [[Al Williamson]] created a [[graphic-novel]] sequel<ref>''Squadron Supreme: Death of a Universe'' (1989)</ref> which [[marooning|maroons]] the team in the mainstream Marvel universe. Doctor Spectrum and teammates encounter the hero [[Quasar (Wendell Vaughn)|Quasar]], and relocate to the government facility [[Project Pegasus]]. After another encounter with the Overmind and a visit to the [[laboratory]] world of the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]],<ref>''Quasar'' #13–16 (Aug.–Nov. 1990)</ref> the group attempts to return to their universe,<ref>''Quasar'' #19 (Feb. 1991)</ref> and, alongside fellow members [[Hyperion (Marvel Comics)|Hyperion]] and the [[Whizzer (comics)|Whizzer]], battles the entity [[Deathurge]].<ref>''Quasar'' #25 (Aug. 1991)</ref>

The entire Squadron Supreme appear in a two-part story with the Avengers that finally returns them to their home universe, where they disband for a time.<ref>''Avengers/Squadron Supreme Annual '98'' and the [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''Squadron Supreme: New World Order'' (both Sept. 1998)</ref> Doctor Spectrum rejoins his teammates to aid the  [[interdimensional hypothesis|interdimensional]] team the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]].<ref>''Exiles'' vol. 2, #77 - 78 (Apr.–May 2006)</ref>

The mature-audience [[Marvel MAX]] imprint showcases the adventures of the Earth-31916 version of the Squadron Supreme. The title ''[[Supreme Power]]'' relates how Joseph Ledger, a [[soldier]] in the [[United States Army]], accidentally bonds with a crystal found in the vessel that brings Hyperion to Earth.<ref>''Supreme Power'' #1–6 (Oct. 2003 – Mar. 2004)</ref> The story continues in the limited series ''Doctor Spectrum'', written by Sara Barnes and art by [[John Dell]] and [[Travel Foreman]], with the experience placing Ledger in a [[coma]], and after reliving his life in his mind for the benefit of the apparently sentient crystal, the character awakens and adopts the codename of Doctor Spectrum.<ref>''Doctor Spectrum'' #1–6 (Oct. 2004 – Mar. 2005)</ref> Operating in a military-style uniform as opposed to a prismatic costume, Doctor Spectrum encounters and battles Hyperion, forming a truce with him to hunt down a super-powered [[serial killer]], [[Redstone (comics)|Michael Redstone]]. Doctor Spectrum also begins a tentative romance with fellow superhuman [[Amphibian (comics)|Amphibian]].<ref>''Supreme Power'' #7–18 (Apr. 2004 – Oct. 2005)</ref> Both eventually join the US-backed [[Squadron Supreme (Supreme Power)|Squadron Supreme]] in the 2006 title of the same name.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' vol. 2, #1 (May 2006)</ref> Joseph is later killed during a battle with [[Squadron Sinister]] after [[Whizzer (comics)|Whizzer]] slices his stomach open.

====Female Doctor Spectrum (Earth-4290001)====
An alternate, female version of Doctor Spectrum later appears as a member of the Great Society, a team of [[Justice League]] analogues from Earth-4290001. During a conflict with the [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]], she is defeated by [[Black Bolt]].<ref>''New Avengers'' (vol. 3) #16.NOW-21</ref> It has been confirmed that this version of Doctor Spectrum will be one of the leads in the upcoming ''Squadron Supreme'' relaunch.<ref>{{cite web|author=Gavin Jasper |url=http://www.denofgeek.us/books-comics/squadron-supreme/247273/squadron-supreme-1-to-assemble-this-fall |title=Squadron Supreme #1 to Assemble This Fall |publisher=Denofgeek.us |date=2015-06-30 |accessdate=2015-07-15}}</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
All versions of Doctor Spectrum derive their abilities from an alien gem called the Power Prism. The original prism, used by the Kenji Obatu and Billy Roberts versions of Doctor Spectrum, is a sentient being called Krimonn. Krimonn was originally a [[Skrull]] who, after failing to usurp the Skrull [[Emperor]], was transformed into a living prism as punishment.<ref name="autogenerated1973"/> When the Grandmaster requires champions to battle the Avengers, he retrieves the prism and grants Krimonn several energy-based powers that can be used in conjunction with a host.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} Kenji Obatu is the first to coin the term "Power Prism", and discovers that although trapped in prism form, Krimonn remains aggressive and asserts his will via [[telepathy]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} Krimonn's mind is "muted" by Nebulon when the Power Prism is given to Billy Roberts, although Krimonn reasserts itself during the quest to find and bond with the character Thor.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} When the plan fails and the gem is shattered, Krimonn's consciousness apparently dissipated forever.

Krimonn could bestow on a host the ability to project and manipulate light energy in various colors;{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} create light energy constructs of various shapes, sizes and colors;{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} flight; protection from the rigors of space and the ability to become intangible.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} The Power Prism is vulnerable to ultra-violet light.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

The Earth-712 Doctor Spectrum gains his power the Skrullian Power Prism given to him by the Skrullian Skymaster.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} When the Power Prism later exploded and fragments of it were embedded in Doctor Spectrum, his skin, hair, and costume were bleached chalk-white.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} The Earth-712 Power Prism possesses the same abilities as the Earth-616 version.

The Earth-31916 Power Prism is a sentient power source removed from the spacecraft that brings Hyperion to Earth.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

==In other media==

===Television===
* Doctor Spectrum appears in ''[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|Avengers Assemble]]'', voiced by [[Phil LaMarr]]. A member of the [[Squadron Supreme]], this version is the Billy Roberts iteration but visually modeled after the original Kenji Obatu iteration. In the episode "Dark Avengers", he uses the Reality Stone for [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Nighthawk]] to invert history so that the Avengers are the [[Dark Avengers|villains]] but the Avengers eventually restore reality. The episode "Spectrums" revealed that Doctor Spectrum was someone that was sold [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Ant-Man]]'s technology for the Power Prism. At his hideout, a fight with Ant-Man, [[Captain America]], [[Iron Man]] and [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] results in the destruction of Ant-Man's technology which supposedly suppressed the Power Prism. Out of vengeance, he harvested the feelings of Thor, Captain America and Iron Man to create spectral copies of [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], the [[Bucky Barnes|Winter Soldier]] and [[Ultron]]. After the three Avengers each overcome their respective spectral nemesis, the other Avengers discover that Nighthawk and [[Hyperion (comics)|Hyperion]] attached the Power Prism to Doctor Spectrum in order to destroy the Squadron Supreme's own planet, and that Ant-Man's technology in question had allowed Doctor Spectrum to get control of the Power Prism. After Ant-Man manages to free Doctor Spectrum from the Power Prism with [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]]'s information, he reverts to Billy. In the aftermath, Roberts is hooked up with a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] space program to help in space exploration and to find a suitable planet for Billy to reside on while the Power Prism, no longer needing a host and forms its own body modeled after Doctor Spectrum, makes its way back to Nighthawk. In the episode "Avengers' Last Stand", the Power Prism's Doctor Spectrum form is seen with the Squadron Supreme into enacting Nighthawk's plot against the Avengers. In the episode "Avengers Underground", the Power Prism's Doctor Spectrum form is defeated by Ant-Man as Captain America uses the Power Prism to turn the sun blue so that [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]] can defeat Hyperion. It was then used to bring the team to one location, but this ended up using the remainder of the prism's power, rendering it inert.
