'''Dr. Spectrum''' is a [[comic book]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], and a member of the [[Squadron Supreme]].  There are actually several different Marvel incarnations of Dr. Spectrum, one of whom was a [[supervillain]]. Dr. Spectrum was created by [[Roy Thomas]] as part of an homage to the [[Justice League]]. All incarnations are essentially based on the [[DC Comics]] character [[Green Lantern]].  Editors at DC were so impressed with Squadron Supreme that Thomas actually got to write stories for the Justice League comicbook later on.

==Various incarnations of Doctor Spectrum==

There are three versions of Dr. Spectrum from three different dimensions in the Marvel Universe, none of which come from the normal Marvel continuity. The version of Dr. Spectrum that had the most development was the version who was a member of the Squadron Supreme. The version of Dr. Spectrum in the "Supreme Power" comic is a rebooted version of this character. There is also an evil version of Dr. Spectrum who was a member of the Squadron Sinister, who had several incarnations. Although the Squadron Sinister Dr. Spectrum preceded the Squadron Supreme version in appearance, the former is considered the original as the latter was revealed to be just a copy. Below are more detailed descriptions of each version of the character.

{{spoiler}}

===Squadron Sinister===

Dr. Spectrum first appeared in ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' #70 (November [[1969]]) as a member of the Squadron Sinister, a group of supervillains assembled by the alien [[Grandmaster (comics)|Grandmaster]] to fight the Avengers. The Squadron Sinister was created by [[Roy Thomas]] and was broadly based on DC Comics' [[Justice League]]. This Dr. Spectrum had a hunger to rule the earth (''[[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]'' #13) and a power prism with its own personality, that it lost after it had been restored by Nebulon, the Celestial Man.

The first person to use the power prism in the Marvel Universe was Dr. Kenji Obatu, a ruthless African politician, who found the gem and merged with it. After the Squadron's defeat at the end of ''The Avengers'' #70, the prism sought another host, finding in it evangelist William Roberts. The Avengers took custody of the prism after defeating Roberts, and it took control of the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] and [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] before being destroyed.

A much later [[retcon]] revealed that the Doctor Spectrum of the Squadron Sinister had been created by the Grandmaster as a copy of the Squadron Supreme's Doctor Spectrum, and that the Squadron Sinister version's power prism was actually an alien [[Skrull]], named Krimonn, in a mutated crystalline form.

===Squadron Supreme===

In ''Avengers'' #85-86 (March-April [[1971]]), Thomas created the [[Squadron Supreme]], a group of heroes from a parallel world who were a more direct homage of the Justice League than their Squadron Sinister predecessors. This group had its own version of Dr. Spectrum, with a human secret identity of Joe Ledger.

Dr. Spectrum used to be an [[astronaut]], adventurer and something of a playboy. On one of his space missions he saved the life of a benevolent alien of the [[Skrull]] race. In gratitude for rescuing him, the Skrull gave Joe Ledger the Power Prism, an energy synthesizer his people had created.

Dr. Spectrum has the similar relationships to the other Squadron member as the Green Lantern character has to other members of the Justice Leage of America. His best friends are [[Golden Archer]] (based on [[Green Arrow]]) and [[the Whizzer]] (based on [[the Flash]]).

The Squadron implemented a Utopia project in the wake of their world being devastated by the Overmind.  During that period the distraught former Squadron member known as Nuke died in a fight with Dr. Spectrum and his best friend, Golden Archer, was killed in a fight about the Utopia project. Both events turned Dr. Spectrum's character into a more serious one.

At last note, Dr. Spectrum and a reformed Squadron were fighting to free their world from a global dictatorship which had taken it over while the team was stranded in the main Marvel Universe.

===Supreme Power===

In August [[2003]], the ''[[Supreme Power]]'' series began to chronicle a rebooted version of the [[Squadron Supreme]].

In this version, '''Joseph (Joe) Daniel Ledger''' is a [[Colonel]] in the [[United States Army]], the son of a prostitute named Mary Ledger, whose step-father Eddie [[Child abuse|physically abused]] him. He has an ex-wife named Mandy and a son named Jordan whom he doesn't know. He joined the Army at sixteen with a fake identity. Later in life [[Sergeant]] Joe Ledger was on a mission in South America, in which he shot and killed a boy and afterwards attacked a fellow soldier, being demoted to Corporal. After his mother was murdered, Joe discovered his mother didn't know who his real father is. He killed his step-father upon learning the truth. The government gave Joe Ledger an option, to perform [[covert operations]] missions or go to prison.

Ledger got the nickname ''Doctor'' because of the precision he performed his secret missions around the world, like a [[surgery|surgeon]]. He is considered the perfect soldier: an army man who follows any and all orders and is a natural killer. Joe Ledger was the only candidate who was focused and single minded enough to be able to control the power prism found in [[Hyperion (Supreme Power)|Hyperion]]'s space ship. It was absorbed into his skin and he lapsed into a [[coma]].

A mini-series titled ''Doctor Spectrum: Full Spectrum'' was launched in 2004 while the '''Supreme Power''' went on hiatus. The series was written by [[Samm Barnes]], and dealt with Joe Ledger's background, presented in flashback when the power prism was attempting to the take control of Joe's mind while he was in coma. Ledger learned what the power prism's real mission directive is and how much power he and the prism really has.

After recovering from his coma, Doctor Spectrum was once again used for covert missions for the government, missions Hyperion was being blamed for. The two fought a long battle in which Hyperion touched the crystal by accident and was given memories of his journey to Earth, after which he defeated Spectrum. Ledger then met [[Amphibian (comics)|Amphibian]] while healing after the fight. Doctor Spectrum found out doctors have used samples of Hyperion's DNA to create new superhumans like the super-human serial killer.

After taking the super-human serial killer Michael Redstone into custody, he was approached by the super-hero program's new official, General Richard Alexander, who ordered Spectrum to locate and capture Amphibian, showing him a picture of her killing two people. After capturing Amphibian and starting a romantic relationship with her, Doctor Spectrum meets [[Power Princess|Zarda]], who attempted to remove the power prism and retrieve her memories. But before that happened, she was attacked by Amphibian in retaliation for harming Spectrum.

==Powers and abilities==

Dr. Spectrum's power prism enables him to fly and create objects of some unknown form of energy.  He can create a force field around himself in order to withstand enormous concussive impacts and can use the prism to allow himself to withstand the vacuum of space.

==Additional Notes==

Joe Ledger's initials, JL, are very remniscent of Green Lantern's sometime nickname, GL.
