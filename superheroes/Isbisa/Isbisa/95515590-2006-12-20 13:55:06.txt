'''Isbisa''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe.  He first appeared in ''All-Winners Comics'' vol. 1 #19 (1946).  Isbisa was a criminal mastermind as well as an expert in chemistry and radioactivity.  He was not super-powered but instead relied on a series of 'suits' to battle his enemies.  He primarily battled the All-Winners Squad and was particularly obsessed with former Squad members the [[Whizzer]] and [[Miss America]].

== Character history ==
===Golden Age===
Meke started out as the secretary of museum curator Professor Saba.  In 1945, Meke decided to take up a life of villainy by attempting to take over the world.  He planned to do this by stealing an atom bomb.  Accordingly he took on an alias, in this case he started calling him Isbisa, after inventively combining the first letter of the Ice Age, the Stone Age, the Iron Age, the Steel Age and the Atomic Age.  

One year before putting his plans into action Isbisa poured over the details of how his scheme would be play out.  Meke suspected that he would run into difficulties as the newly formed All-Winners Squad would most likely attempt to foil his plans.  To countermand their involvement he assembled five villains and gave each one a plot to carry out.  This was meant to distract the All-Winner Squad long enough for Meke to steal the atomic bomb.

Exactly one year later Isbisa set his plan into motion.  He attacked the museum where his alter-ego was employed and destroyed many of the exhibits.  He left notes for the members of the All-Winner Squad to give them clues as to where his villains would strike next.  He also tried causing dissent amongst the Squad members by hinting that [[Namor]], the Sub-mariner was working for him.  This worked as Namor, angered by the suspicion of his team-mates, stormed off with Toro following.

While the All-Winner Squad was busy dealing with the villains, Isbisa created a concentrated sleeping gas which he proceeded to use on the workers at the Atom Smasher Vacuum Tube.  Moments before succeeding in his plot to steal the atom bomb, the All-Winner Squad triumphantly appeared and saved the day.  Isbisa made a run for it.

[[Captain America]] and [[Bucky]] chased after him and Miss America knocked him into a river.  Because of his special suit Meke was able to float in water.  He got to a boat but was eventually captured by Namor. The squad unmasked him and he was imprisoned.

In prison Meke became more and more obsessed with the All-Winners Squad, which had disbanded by that point.  In 1949, he escaped from prison and started devising a plan to exact his revenge on his most hated enemies.  He learned that Miss America and the Whizzer were acting as bodyguards for a nuclear project.  He tried to sabotage the project but failed at killing either hero.  He did, however, manage to exposed the then-pregnant Miss American to enough levels of high radiation which eventually caused irreparable damage to her unborn child.  Bova the cow woman who had days earlier delivered the twin babies of Magneto was asked to serve as midwife to Miss America during the birth of her son.  When the child was born he gave of lethal levels of radiation which resulted in his mothers death.  Bova decided to keep the death of the mother and seemingly the child from the Whizzer and instead presented him with ‘his’ healthy twin babies.  The government learned of the child’s existence and the possible threat he posed and decided to contain him by sealing him up and codenaming him Nuklo.  The Whizzer never suspected that his and his wife’s interaction with Isbisa was the result of Miss America’s death.

===Silver Age===
Years later, still not content with the destruction he had already caused, Meke infiltrated the government project tasked with curing Nuklo.  He assumed the position of Nuklo’s therapist, under the name I.S. Bishoff.  While there he created a new suit which possessed the ability to siphon off  Nyklo’s radiation.  This had the duel effect of both healing Nuklo and imbuing Isbisa with enough power to take on super-humans.

It was at this time that Robert Frank, previously known as the Whizzer had learned that his son had not died and planned to gain custody of the child.  He, Scarlet Witch and her then husband Vision had came to the hospital where Nuklo was kept and where Isbisa was working, in the hope of taking his son to Attilan for more advanced treatment.  

Isbisa saw his opportunity for revenge and as I.S. Bishoff, separated Bob Frank from the two Avengers by requesting to speak to him in private.  Isbisa took Frank to the Nursery where Nuklo was being kept .  When Bob Frank saw his son he started reminiscing about the events that let to his sons condition unaware that Isbisa was suiting up into his radiation gear.  Frank started to explain about the accident which had killed his wife and it was then that I.S. Bishoff exposed himself as Isbisa and elucidate to the Whizzer that he had caused Miss America’s death.  He then proceeded to attack Frank and even though Nuklo tried to warn his father it was to late.

The Scarlet Witch and the Vision were alerted to Bob Frank’s distress and rushed to his aid.  They found a luminous Isbisa, standing over the fallen Bob Frank.  Wanda acted first and severed the cables in his suit but he had already absorb enough of Nuklo’s radiation to take on both Avengers.  During the skirmish Bob Frank recovered and released Nuklo.  Isbisa defeated Wanda and the Vision and was then confronted by the enraged Whizzer who rushed him.  Isbisa easily murdered the aged hero.  Nuklo attempted an attack as well but his powers were absorbed.

Both Avengers recovered and quickly joined Nuklo to battle Isbisa.  Nuklo started to reabsorb his radiation after Wanda used her hex powers to remove Isbisa’ s masked.  Isbisa tried to escaped but was stopped by the Vision.  Sensing his imminent defeat Isbisa release all his stored-up radiation in a bid to kill the heroes but the only effect this had was leaving him powerless and curing Nuklo.  Isbisa was arrested, leaving behind the three heroes and a dead Bob Frank.

===Modern Age===
Years later, he escaped yet again and in the pages of The Sensational She-Hulk plotted to use the fourth wall, or dimension to tap into its power to rejuvenate himself and to move people through time and space.  During one of She-Hulk’s court cases he moved Venom from a past battle with Spiderman into the courthouse.  Later the Hulk was also moved from a past comic book battle and placed near an unsuspecting She-Hulks.  She-Hulk battled numerous time-displaced villains until her confidante and former Blonde Phantom Lousie Mason figured out who was behind everything.  When confronted Isbisa made a run for it yet again and escaped.
