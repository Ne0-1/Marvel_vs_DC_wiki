'''The Grey Gargoyle''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain]] and a perennial foe of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. The Grey Gargoyle was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' Vol. 1, #107 (August, [[1964]]).

==Fictional character biography==

'''Pierre Paul Duval''' was a French chemist and lab assistant who gained his powers by accidentally spilling an unknown concoction on himself. Imbued with a living granite body and a touch that could turn anything to stone, Duval turns to a life of crime. Duval eventually grows bored and seeks a new goal: immortality. Naming himself the '''Grey Gargoyle''', Duval finds and confronts [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], believing that Thor's hammer [[Mjolnir (Marvel Comics)|Mjolnir]] is the secret of his immortality. Thor, however, defeats the Grey Gargoyle and once again several month later. <ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' Vol. 1, #107 + 113</ref>

== Against the Marvels ==

The Grey Gargoyle goes on to fight a number of superheroes including [[Iron Man]], <ref>''Tales of Suspense'' Vol. 1, #95 - 96</ref> [[Captain America]], [[Falcon (comics)|the Falcon]], [[Nick Fury]], [[Spider-Man]] <ref>''Captain America'' Vol. 1, #139 - 142</ref> and [[Thor]] once again, this time in deep space. <ref>''Thor'' Vol. 1, #258 - 258</ref> He returns to Earth to fight the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and years later again as part of the [[Masters of Evil]]. <ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 1, #190 -191 + 271</ref> After having a scheme foiled by [[Iron Man]], <ref>''Iron Man'' Vol. 1, #235 - 236</ref> the Grey Gargoyle is employed by [[Doctor Doom]] to neutralise the [[Hulk (comics)|Incredible Hulk]], who humiliates the Grey Gargoyle by breaking his arm. <ref>''Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 1, #363 - 364</ref>

The Grey Gargoyle later attacks [[She-Hulk]] <ref>''Sensational She-Hulk'' Vol. 2, #27</ref> and then the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], and after turning the Thing to stone is defeated by the rest of the [[Fantastic Four]]. <ref>''Fantastic Four'' Vol. 2, #38 - 39</ref> The temporary transformation somehow allows the Thing the ability to now change between his stone and human form at will. After another bout with Thor <ref>''Thor'' Vol. 2, #47</ref> the Grey Gargoyle is incarcerated, and was last seen as an escapee. <ref>''New Avengers'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==

Originally, Duval spilled an unknown organic chemical combination on his right hand, turning that hand into living stone. Duval also gained the ability to instantaneously transform any substance to [[granite]] stone by touching it with that hand. Whether due to artistic error or evolution of powers, the Gargoyle has been depicted on occasion using his left hand to inflict his stone touch. Like [[Midas|King Midas]], Duval has no control over the results of his touch.

By using his stoning touch upon himself, Duval can transform himself into a being of living stone, possessing superhuman strength and durability. Duval is not invulnerable, however, having had an arm broken by the [[Hulk (comics)|Incredible Hulk]].

Duval's touch turns a limited amount of mass to stone for an hour. While stoned, the substance has durability approximate to granite. 

==In Other Media==

In the [[1994]] ''[[Iron Man]]'' [[animated series]], Grey Gargoyle served as one of the minions of [[Mandarin (comics)|the Mandarin]]. 

In the video game [[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]] the Grey Gargoyle appears as a mini-boss.
