== Powers and abilities ==
During an experiment Duval spilled an unknown organic chemical compound on his right hand, causing a mutagenic reaction that permanently transformed the hand into living stone. As a result, Duval can turn any matter touched with his "stone" hand to a similar substance. The effect lasts for approximately one hour. Duval can also use the effect to transform himself into a being of living stone - with no loss of mobility - possessing superhuman strength and durability. Duval is not invulnerable in granite form, having had an arm broken by the Hulk.

Magical objects are apparently impervious to the stone effect, as when Duval grasped the sword of the [[Black Knight (comics)|Black Knight]], it was unaffected and the Gargoyle was reverted back to human form. <ref name="Avengers #271 Sep. 1986"/>  

Duval also has a master's degree in chemistry.

==Other versions==
The Grey Gargoyle influences many events in the alternate future of ''[[Earth X]]''. He gets into a confrontation with most members of the team 'Excalibur', turning them into stone mid-battle. However, [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] had mostly teleported away, losing one arm in the process. This drives him mad, eventually turning him into the demon Belasco. The Grey Gargoyle is nuetralized and the heroes are thought lost to stone forever.{{issue}} However, as detailed in the '[[Paradise X]]' limited series, years later, yet another Grey Gargoyle is fetched from an alternate dimension and undoes this work. The unexpected return of Meggan and the other heroes threatens much more unintentional disruptions.{{issue}}
