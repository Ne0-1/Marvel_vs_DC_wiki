==Powers and abilities==
Originally, Duval spilled an unknown organic chemical combination on his right hand, turning that hand into living stone. By using his stoning touch upon himself, Duval can transform himself into a being of living stone, possessing superhuman strength and durability. Duval also gained the ability to instantaneously transform matter to [[granite]] stone by touching it with that hand. As stone, the substance has durability approximate to granite. Some objects, however, are impervious to the Grey Gargoyle's touch, possibly due to their magical nature. When grasping the sword of the [[Black Knight (comics)|Black Knight]], it was unaffected and the Gargoyle was reverted back to human form. <ref>''Avengers'' #271 (Sep. 1986)</ref> Duval is also not invulnerable in granite form, having had an arm broken by the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]].
