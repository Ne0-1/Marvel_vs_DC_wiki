'''The Grey Gargoyle''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain]], most commonly associated with [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].

==Origins and powers==

Pierre Paul Duval was a French chemist who gained his powers through contamination by some unkown substance. 
He can turn his body into stone, giving him super-strength and quasi-invulnerability. Additionally,
his touch  can transform anything, even an [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] god,
into inert stone for a few minutes (luckily for him his stone body is ''not inert''), making him a formidable menace.
