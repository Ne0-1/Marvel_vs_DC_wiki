The '''Puppet Master''', real name '''Phillip Masters''', is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] in the ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' comics. His first appearance was in ''Fantastic Four'' volume 1 #8. His origin was told in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' volume 1 #6.

The Puppet Master uses radioactive clay to make puppets of people that he can then control, attaching them to strings and moving them as puppets; presumably he has some sort of psionic ability that enables him to do this. He is the stepfather of [[Alicia Masters]], a blind girl who holds an attraction to the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]]. He once tried to take over the world but was thwarted in this effort by the Fantastic Four.

==Fictional character biography==
Phillip Masters, the man who would become the Puppet Master was born in the small fictional Balkan nation of Transia, in Dragorin. He moved to the United States at the age of eight. He was socially maladjusted and had no friends. (According to [[Spider-Man Family]] issue 4, his mother died when he was young and he was often picked on, causing him to turn to his puppets as "friends".)

After he finished college he went into business with Jacob Reiss. Philip was jealous of Reiss' wealth and of his family and decided to sabotage his workplace, but Reiss caught him in the act and when the two fought Reiss was accidentally killed in an explosion. Reiss' daughter Alicia was caught in the explosion and blinded as a result.

Playing the explosion off as an accident, he started a relationship with and then married Reiss' wife, Marcia, and adopted Alicia. When his wife died it was more than he could bear and he lost his sanity. It was at this time that he first began experimenting with radioactive clay that he was somehow able to use to psionically control specific individuals' bodies. He thought to exploit this talent to the fullest and drew up a plan to take over the world. He didn't get very far with the plan before the Fantastic Four stopped him.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #8</ref>

The Puppet Master then controlled [[Namor]], and used him to battle the Fantastic Four.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #14</ref> He also pitted the [[Human Torch]] and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] against each other.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #116</ref> He teamed with the [[Mad Thinker]], and used the original [[X-Men]] to battle the Fantastic Four.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #28</ref> Teaming up again with the Thinker, who would become his frequent ally, he battled the Thing and the Torch again,<ref>''Strange Tales'' #126</ref> and even used animated life size mannequins to battle the pair.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #133</ref>

The Puppet Master was later seen among a group of criminals assembled by [[Doctor Doom]].<ref>''Fantastic Four Annual'' #3</ref> He then controlled Namor again.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #78-79</ref> He opposed the original X-Men through the mind-controlled [[Mimic (comics)|Mimic]].<ref>''X-Men'' #27</ref> He also fomented a battled between the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and Namor by controlling the Hulk.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #100</ref>

The Puppet Master next allied with the Mad Thinker and [[Egghead (comics)|Egghead]] in their attempted blackmail of the U.S. He forced [[Iron Man]] to battle [[Mar-Vell|Captain Marvel]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #14; ''Avengers'' #63; ''Captain Marvel'' #14</ref> He again teamed with the Thinker, and attacked the Fantastic Four using androids of their past foes.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #100</ref> He controlled Ballox the Monstroid, and battled [[Spider-Man]] and the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]].<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #5</ref> With the Thinker, he battled Spider-Man and the Thing.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #6</ref> He then forced [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] to battle the Fantastic Four.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #9</ref> He then controlled the [[Wrecker (comics)|Wrecker]] and [[Luke Cage|Power Man]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #168-170</ref> Eventually, the Puppet Master returned to his homeland, where he encountered [[Modred the Mystic]].<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #74</ref>

With Doctor Doom, the Puppet Master trapped the Fantastic Four within the miniature artificial city of "Liddleville"; their minds were trapped inside tiny robot bodies.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #236</ref> He was defeated by Doom in Liddleville, however,<ref>''Micronauts'' #41</ref> and was seemingly destroyed by Doom.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #246</ref> His mind was then resurrected in a body of living radioactive clay.<ref>''Thing'' #4</ref> He battled the Thing on the mental plane, and his living clay body was destroyed.<ref>''Thing'' #6</ref> He was eventually resurrected in his original body by the [[Sphinx (comics)|Sphinx]].<ref>''Thing'' #34</ref>

He was once thought to have been killed when he fell out of the window of a fairly tall building, but he miraculously survived.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} The Puppet Master has exhibited an uncanny ability to cheat death, dodging mortal threats that have included bomb blasts,{{Issue|date=April 2009}} drownings,{{Issue|date=April 2009}} and even a giant squid attack.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Liddleville would later be used against the [[Micronauts]] and [[X-Force]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

On several occasions the jealous Puppet Master would use his clay to manipulate the lives of the Fantastic Four where his stepdaughter was concerned, in particular to "guard" his precious Alicia from marrying the likes of the Thing.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} But he was just as outraged when she became engaged to [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]], also a member of the FF.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

With the Thinker and the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]], Masters attempted to disrupt the wedding of the Human Torch and Alicia. The plan was to launch an attack on the church after the wedding ceremony, but Masters was so overcome with remorse when he saw how happy Alicia was to marry Johnny that he turned against his associates, launching the [[Dragon Man]] against them: his wedding gift to Alicia and Johnny.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #300</ref>

He was later revealed to have reformed, remarried, and to have a stepson; the toys he crafted for his son inadvertently caused a battle between [[Power Pack]] and the alien Ciegramites.<ref>''Power Pack'' #60</ref> Masters would later reveal to the Thing that he had discovered that the Alicia Johnny had married was actually a [[Lyja|Skrull]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #357</ref>

===Reformations===
The Puppet Master has been shown on two occasions attempting to leave his (overtly) criminal life behind. In the first, he found some measure of spiritual enlightenment in the service of the billionaire philosopher/cultist [[Satori]], who employed Masters to construct a "perfect man" from his clay that would then receive life and the power cosmic from the [[Silver Surfer]] and absorb Satori's mind, that he might survive his body's death and serve as a proper leader to his flock. Masters at some point left this cult, and entered a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]-maintained witness protection program, using his abilities to aid the government through the dulling of memories of other so-protected criminals' previous associates. Masters reached out through his powers to control Ben Grimm and Alicia, duping Ben into a "married life" with his despondent daughter, whom Ben had stopped seeing years before. Ben was freed, the FF were prevented from taking any measure of revenge upon Masters, given his S.H.I.E.L.D. affiliation.

===Return to Criminal life===
The Puppet Master was seen to have returned to criminal life and affiliated himself with the [[Mad Thinker]].  Utilizing a device constructed by The Thinker, he was able to control a large number of non super-humans, most notably members of the [[Yancy Street Gang]] to escalate a battle between the two different factions in the [[Civil War (comics)|Super Hero Civil War]].

He revealed in this issue that he always planned to kill the person he was working with in his past team-ups and that he has anger management problems. The Thinker gives him the number of a good therapist. This exchange seems to contradict previous interactions between the two.<ref>''Fantastic Four #538'' (''August, 2006'')</ref>

The Puppet Master is shown to now be in the business of selling slaves (primarily females). Some of them are superhuman females captured by members of the Chilean Army under his control. Among those held captive are [[Dusk (comics)|Dusk]], [[Tigra]], [[Silverclaw]], [[Cassandra Lang|Stature]], and [[Arana (comics)|Arana]]. The Puppet Master is shown having random male slaves fight to the death.<ref>''[[Ms. Marvel]] #18''</ref> The Puppet Master is presumed killed when he detonates explosives hidden beneath the house he used as a base while still inside.<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' #20</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Puppet Master has no revealed superhuman abilities, but he has a gifted intellect and was once a brilliant biologist with a doctorate in biology. He is an extremely talented craftsman and very gifted in experimental science. His greatest strength was his ability to create extremely lifelike marionette puppets with extreme speed that he modeled after real people. Through intense concentration, he is able to control the physical actions of anyone after whom he models one of his puppets. How he did this was never adequately explained other than he used some type of special radioactive mixture. The clay he used in this mixture was magical, slightly radioactive, and came from a remote area near [[Wundagore Mountain]], [[Transia]], site of the prison of the elder god [[Chthon (comics)|Chthon]]. The Puppet Master may have some type of psionic ability which complimented this process, enabling him to control his victims, although the process may be entirely the result of the magical properties of the clay. He cannot control the actions of essentially mindless creatures, and his control can be broken by beings with supremely strong will-power. His control is limited to one person at a time, and the degree of control decreases with the distance from the person controlled.

==In other media==
===Television===
* The Puppet Master appeared in the Sub-Mariner portion of ''[[The Marvel Superheroes]]''.
* The Puppet Master appeared in the 1982 ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1982 animated series)|Incredible Hulk]]'' cartoon. He appears in the episode '''Bruce Banner: Unmasked''' where he gets control of the residents in Mesa City while also attempting to control the Hulk- his Hulk 'doll' even allows him to exert some slight influence over Bruce Banner, although Banner simply feels uncomfortable rather than falling under the Puppet Master's control-, simultaneously causing the Hulk's true identity to be revealed. The only person he doesn't make a puppet of is his stepdaughter Alicia, which allows Bruce and [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick]] to track him down, Rick subsequently using the Puppet Master's equipment to erase all memory of the Hulk's true identity prior to its destruction.
* The Puppet Master appeared in the ''[[Fantastic Four (1994 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]'' TV series voiced by [[Neil Ross]]. He took control of the Thing and used him to capture Invisible Woman. Mister Fantastic freed the Thing from his control and defeated the Puppet Master. Upon returning to his apartment to reclaim his final doll, he ended up in a fight with Alicia, and then he apparently fell to his death from the apartment window. The Fantastic Four weren't able to find his body and claimed that he "vanished from Earth."
* The Puppet Master appears in ''[[Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes]]'' TV series voiced by [[Alvin Sanders]]. As is the case with Alicia, the Puppet Master is African-American in this series. Debuting in the episode "Puppet Master," he was a sculptor whose clay was hit from a fragment of the same space station where the Fantastic Four were in when they got their powers. After touching his clay, he discovered he can manipulate the person of whoever he sculpts, resulting in him taking over the Thing and kidnapping the award-winning artists and Alicia. When the other Fantastic Four members arrived, the Puppet Master sculpted the Human Torch and took control of him until Alicia broke the sculptures and the Puppet Master is jailed. However, the ending hints at him escaping, as he disguised some clay as a pair of sunglasses. In the episode "Strings," he had manipulated his guards into bringing him enough of his clay to control all of the city officials, allowing him to have the FF evicted and turned into wanted criminals. He ultimate goal was to have Reed Richards enhance his powers, but he was foiled. In the final scene, while locked up in the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]], he removes some clay from under his false teeth, only to have Sue Storm take it from him.

===Film===
* In the extended edition of the ''[[Fantastic Four (film)|Fantastic Four]]'' [[DVD]], the Thing notices puppets in a scene with Alicia Masters at her art gallery. She says they belong to her step dad.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} [[Don Payne]] has also expressed interest in making the Puppet Master, a villain in further, future installments if any of the Fantastic Four film franchise.{{Fact|date=November 2008}}

===Video game===
* The Puppet Master appeared in the 2005 ''[[Fantastic Four (video game)|Fantastic Four]]'' video game voiced by [[James C. Mathis III]]. Although you do not fight him directly, he sends several exhibits at a museum (ex. mummies and dinosaurs) after you to protect Alicia. In the end, after the heroes destroyed the statue of Horus, he escapes to the back door. His last line is "Next time, fantastic fools, the Puppet Master will not fail." The heroes aren't aware that he was responsible for the disaster, believing it instead to be a side-effect of the cosmic rays that gave them their powers. In the instruction booklet that comes with the game, The Puppet Master's bio is given, explaining that he uses radioactive clay to control whoever he chooses. This is probably how he made the exhibits in the museum come to life and attack the Fantastic Four.
