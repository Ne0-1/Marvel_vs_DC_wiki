'''Victor von Doom''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[publications]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], the character first appeared in ''Fantastic Four'' #5 (July 1962). A recurring [[supervillain]], he is the [[archenemy]] of the [[Fantastic Four]] and also the leader of the nation of [[Latveria]].  Doom is both a genius inventor and a sorcerer, and has fought numerous other superheroes in his various plots for power and/or revenge over the years. A frequent plot device is to reveal at a story's end that the heroes were actually fighting one of Doom's many robot doubles, either working on his behalf, or a [[Doombot]] gone rogue impersonating him.

The character of Doctor Doom has featured in other Marvel-endorsed products such as [[feature films]]; [[video games]]; [[television series]] and merchandise such as [[action figures]] and [[trading cards]].

==Publication history==
===Creation and development===

Like many of Marvel's [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] characters, Doctor Doom was conceived by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]]. With the ''Fantastic Four'' title performing well, Lee and Kirby were trying to dream up a "soul-stirring…super sensational new villain."<ref name="bad guys 12">{{Cite book|title=Bring On the Bad Guys! |last= Lee|first=Stan |authorlink=Stan Lee |year=1976 |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |location= New York|isbn= |page= 12}}</ref> Looking for a name, Lee latched onto "Doctor Doom" as "eloquent in its simplicity — magnificent in its implied menace."<ref name="bad guys 12"/>

[[Image:DrDoomkirbyff2.jpg|thumb|left|''Fantastic Four'' #5 (July 1962), Doctor Doom's first appearance.]]

Due to the rush to publish, the character was not given a full [[origin story]] in his debut<ref name="bad guys 12"/> (except when Reed mentions that he scarred his face while attempting to contact the Netherworld in Reed's university, he was expelled and last heard of searching Tibet for magical secrets) - until two years later in ''Fantastic Four Annual'' #2.<ref name="bad guys 13">{{Cite book|title=Bring On the Bad Guys! |last= Lee|first=Stan |authorlink=Stan Lee |year=1976 |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |location= New York|isbn= |page= 13}}</ref> Lee established Doom's origins as the son of gypsies, born decades ago in Latveria when it was ruled by an unnamed nobleman called the Baron. Doom's mother was a [[witchcraft|witch]], a fact his father tried to hide from the young boy; when his father is killed by the Baron's men unjustly after failing to cure their wife, Doom discovers his mother's occult instruments and swears revenge on the Baron. Doom grows into a headstrong and brilliant man, who attracts the attention of the dean of [[Empire State University]].<ref name=origin/> Offered the chance to study in America, Doom leaves his homeland behind and meets a fellow student named [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]], though Doom disregards his peers. Richards tries to warn Doom about continuing a flawed experiment to communicate with the dead, but Doom continues on; the resulting explosion severely damages Doom's face.<ref name=origin>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]] | Artist =[[Jack Kirby|Kirby, Jack]] | Story =''Origin of Doctor Doom'' | title = Fantastic Four Annual| Volume = | Issue =2 | year = 1964 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> Expelled after the accident, Doom travels the world, eventually being found by a clan of monks in [[Tibet]]. Mastering the monks' disciplines, he becomes their master and forges himself a suit of armor, complete with a mask that can only be removed by him.<ref name=origin/> Doom then returns to menace those he feels are responsible for his accident &mdash; including Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four.

Jack Kirby modeled Doom after [[Death (personification)|Death]], with the armor standing in for that character's skeleton; "It was the reason for the armor and the hood. Death is connected with armor and the inhuman-like steel. Death is something without mercy, and human flesh contains that mercy."<ref name=death>{{Cite book|title=The Silver Age of Comic Book Art | last = Schumer | first = Arlen |year=2003 |publisher=Collectors Press |isbn=1-888054-85-9 |page= 76}}</ref> Kirby further described Doom as being "paranoid", wrecked by his twisted face and wanting the whole world to be like him.<ref name=death/> Kirby went on to say that "Doom is an evil person, but he's not always been evil. He was [respected]…but through a flaw in his own character, he was a perfectionist."<ref name="kirby collected">{{Cite book|title=The Collected Jack Kirby Collector |last=Morrow |first=John |authorlink= |coauthors= Kirby, Jack|year=2006 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |location= |isbn=1-893905-57-8 |page= 101}}</ref> At one point in the Seventies, Kirby drew his interpretation of what Doom would look like under the mask, giving Doom only "a tiny scar on his cheek."<ref name="silver kirby">{{Cite book|title=The Silver Age of Comic Book Art | last = Schumer | first = Arlen |year=2003 |publisher=Collectors Press |isbn=1-888054-85-9 |page= 77}}</ref> Due to this slight imperfection, Doom hides his face not from the world, but from himself.<ref name="silver kirby"/> To Kirby, this is the motivation for Doom's vengeance against the world; because others are superior due to this slight scar, Doom wants to elevate himself above them.<ref name="kirby collected"/> Typical of Lee's writing characterization of Doom is his arrogance; his pride leads to Doom's disfigurement at the hands of his own machine, and to the failures of many of his schemes.<ref name="Marvel Encyclopedia">{{Cite book|title=Marvel Encyclopedia Vol. 6: Fantastic Four | last = Christiansen | first = Jeff |year=2004 |publisher=Marvel Entertainment Group|location=New York |isbn= |pages= 63–66}}</ref>

While the Fantastic Four had fought various villains such as the [[Mole Man]], [[Skrull]]s, the [[Miracle Man]], and [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]], Doctor Doom managed to overshadow them all and became the Fantastic Four's [[archnemesis]].<ref name="greatest villains of the FF"/>

During the 1970s, Doom branched out to more Marvel titles, with a battle between Doom and Prince Rudolfo over control of [[Latveria]] being featured in ''[[Astonishing Tales]]''.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Roy Thomas|Thomas, Roy]] | Artist =[[Wally Wood|Wood, Wally]] | Story =''Revolution!'' | title = Astonishing Tales | Volume = | Issue =2-6 | Date =October 1970-June 1971 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]| Page = }}</ref> Doom also attempts to use the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] as his slave during two issues of ''The Incredible Hulk''.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Roy Thomas|Thomas, Roy]] | Artist =[[Dick Ayers|Ayers, Dick]] | Story =''Sanctuary!'' | Title =Incredible Hulk| Volume = | Issue =143 | Date =September 1971 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> The character also made several appearances in the story arcs of ''[[Super-Villain Team-Up]]'', starting in 1975, as well as appearances in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'', beginning with issue #42 (February 1976). Doom's origin was further elaborated on; a childhood companion, Valeria, was introduced and it was established Cynthia von Doom had sold her soul to [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]].<ref>{{Cite comic | writer = [[Gerry Conway|Conway, Gerry]] | artist =[[Gene Colan|Colan, Gene]] | title = [[Astonishing Tales]] | volume = 1 | issue = 8 | year = 1971 | publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

===1980s-1990s===
1981 saw Marvel and [[DC Comics]] collaborate on another project.  In 1976 the two companies had published ''[[Superman vs. the Amazing Spider-Man]]'', and seeking to replicate that success the two companies again teamed the characters up, in ''[[Superman and Spider-Man]]''.  Marvel [[editor in chief]] [[Jim Shooter]] co-wrote the story alongside [[Marv Wolfman]], and recalled choosing Doom based on his iconic status: "I figured I needed the heaviest-duty bad guy we had to offer — Doctor Doom. Their greatest hero against our greatest villain."<ref>{{Cite book|last=Eury|first=Michael|title=The Krypton Companion|publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing|year=2006|page=77|isbn=1893905616}}</ref>

The same year saw [[John Byrne]] begin his six-year run writing and illustrating ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' in 1981, sparking a "second golden age" for the title<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Slings & Arrows Comic Guide | last = Plowright | first = Frank |year=1997 |publisher=Aurum Press |isbn= |pages= }}</ref> but also attempting to "''turn the clock back [...] get back and see fresh what it was that made the book great at its inception.''"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Current Biography Yearbook | last = Mari | first = Christopher |year=2000 |publisher=H.W.

After Byrne's departure Doctor Doom continued to be a major villain in ''Fantastic Four'', and as the 1980s continued Doom appeared in other comics such as ''[[Punisher]]'', ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', and ''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]''. Under Fantastic Four writer Steven Englehart, Doom became exiled from Latveria by his heir Kristoff, who was brainwashed into thinking he was Doom. Doom would spend most of his time in exile planning his return, but Englehart left the title before he could resolve the storyline. This storyline ultimately ended with the controversial  ''Fantastic Four'' #350, where writer [[Walt Simonson]] had the Doom who had been seen in the book during the Englehart run being revealed to be a Doombot and the real Doom, in a newly redesigned armor, returning to claim his country from his usurper. Simonson's [[retroactive continuity|retcon]] stated that Doom's last real appearance was in the famous "Battle of Baxter Building" though with occasional trips back home, though Doom was shown to be unaware of certain major changes at the time to the Fantastic Four. An [[urban legend]] states that Simonson drew up a list of official stories which featured the real Doom and those which did not<ref>{{Cite web| author = Cronin, Brian | title = Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #100 | work = [[Comic Book Resources]] | date = 2007-04-26 | url = http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/04/26/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-100/ | accessdate=2008-02-14}}</ref> but this plotline was dropped and never mentioned again by later writers, who ignored Simonson's declaration as subterfuge Doom stated for the sake of blaming past failures on Doombots.<ref>Fantastic Four #357</ref>

===Modern depictions===
{{in-universe|date=October 2010}}
In 2003, Doom was the sole villain in the ''Fantastic Four'' story arc "''Unthinkable''", in which Doom imprisons [[Franklin Richards]] in Hell and captures [[Valeria Richards]] and succeeds in catching the Fantastic Four. Writer Mark Waid sought to redefine Doom's character in a way that had not been seen before.<!-- add the interview ref here --> In Waid's reinterpretation, Doom hates Richards for knowing at his core he was right when Doom was wrong.<ref>{{Cite web|author=Brady, Matt|date=2003-01-23|url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=1041|title=Waid thinks the Unthinkable|work=[[Newsarama]]|accessdate=2008-02-20}}</ref><ref name="FFManifisto">{{Cite book|last=Waid|first=Mark|authorlink=Mark Waid|url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0785114866|title=Fantastic Four Volume One|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=2004-08-01|location=New York|pages=''The Fantastic Four Manifesto''|isbn=0785114866}}</ref> Waid was also convinced that the "''truism that Victor Von Doom is, despite his villainy, a noble man''" (as suggested in Byrne's run) "is absolute crap. [...] A man [Doom] whose entire motivating force is jealousy is ridiculously petty, not grandly noble. Yes, Doom is ''regal'', and yes, whenever possible, Doom likes to ''act'' as if he possesses great moral character, because to him that's what great men ''have''... — but when I hear Doom say it 'does not ''suit'' him to' do this-and-such, what I hear is, 'it has nothing to do with my hatred for Reed Richards, so it's not worth my time.'" Waid also stated that Doom "''would tear the head off a newborn baby and eat it like an apple while his mother watched if it would somehow prove he were smarter than Reed.''"<ref name="FFManifisto"/>

Waid punctuated this reinterpretation of Doom  during his "Unthinkable" saga (Vol 2 #66-70 & Vol 1 (restart) #500) as an absolute sadist by having Von Doom ruthlessly murder Valeria, his first love and granddaughter to his long serving faithful retainer Boris. He subsequently attempted to prove his superiority to Reed by giving him the chance to find his way out of a prison that could only be escaped by mastering magic, in the belief that Reed would fail to do so, but with the aid of the astral projection of Doctor Strange Reed learned to master magic by accepting that he couldn't understand it. This fight resulted in Doom being trapped in Hell until the events of Ragnarok, Thor's hammer [[Mjolnir (Marvel Comics)|Mjolnir]] falling through dimensions and giving Doom a way out of Hell when it was lost after Thor's apparent 'death'.

In 2005 and 2006, Doom was featured in his own limited series, ''Books of Doom'', a retelling of the origin story by [[Ed Brubaker]].<ref name="books of doom interview">{{Cite web|author=Brady, Matt|date=2005-10-27|url=http://www.newsarama.com/marvelnew/Nov_previews/BruDoom.htm|title=Brubaker on ''Books of Doom''|work=[[Newsarama]]|accessdate=2008-02-14}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> In an interview, Brubaker said the series was a way to elaborate on the earlier portions of Doom's life which had not been seen often in the comics. The series also set out to determine if Doom's path from troubled child to dictator was fated or Doom's own faults led to his corruption — in essence, a [[nature versus nurture]] question.<ref>{{Cite web|author=Tramountanas, George|date=2005-10-07|title=Brubaker of Deflowering Doom|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=6014|work=[[Comic Book Resources]]|accessdate=2008-02-13}}</ref> Brubaker's version of Doom was heavily influenced by the original Lee/Kirby version; responding to a question if he would show Doom's face, Brubaker stated "''following Kirby's example, I think it's better not to show it.''"<ref name="books of doom interview"/>

After an elaborate series of events, Dr. Doom finds his way to the last spot where ley lines remain from the passing of the Infinity Gems.  Here he makes a wish, to eliminate what he calls the greatest obstacle he has ever faced, and the greatest enemy he has ever known: his own guilt.  With it gone he says, there is nothing to stop him from being Victor Von Doom.<ref>Dr. Doom and the Masters of Evil, four part series released in 2009</ref>

[[The Mighty Avengers]] invaded Latveria, Doom's nation, due to his involvement in creating a chemical bomb that would infect people with the [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] (Although it was recently revealed that this attack was actually set up by [[Kristoff Vernard]] to put Doom out of the picture prior to Kristoff's future attempt at a coup)<ref>''Spider-Man/Fantastic Four'' #4</ref>. Due to [[Ultron]]'s interference, the bomb was dropped on [[Manhattan]], but the Mighty Avengers are able to stop the effects on the people. The Mighty Avengers proceed to invade Latveria. During the invasion, the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]], [[Iron Man]], and Doom are sent to the past thanks to Doom’s time platform. The Sentry is able to do whatever he wants due to the fact that everyone’s memory of him will be erased anyway. They escape, and arrest Doom for terrorist crimes against humanity after a brief struggle.

During [[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]] when Norman Osborn is in charge, Doom is released and sent back to Latveria. However, Morgan le Fay engages him in a magical battle, which he is losing until the [[Dark Avengers]] rescue him. He then magically rebuilds his kingdom.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #1-4</ref>

The character is also featured in ''[[Siege (comics)|Siege]]'' storyline<ref>Siege: The Cabal</ref> and is the lead antagonist in the five issue mini-series [[Doomwar]] written by [[Jonathan Maberry]].<ref name="Richards-12-09">{{cite web|last=Richards|first=Dave|title=MABERRY DECLARES "DOOMWAR"|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=23285|publisher=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=3 October 2010}}</ref> 

Doom soon allies himself with the isolationist group known as the Desturi, to take control of Wakanda. He attacked and wounded T'Challa, the current Black Panther, maiming him enough to prevent him from holding the mantle again. Doom's main objective was to secure Wakanda's store of vibranium, which he could mystically enhance to make himself unstoppable. Doom was also a part of the supervillain group known as the [[Intelligencia]], but was betrayed when they captured him to complete their plan. With the help of [[Bruce Banner]], he escaped, and returned to Latveria. He appears to have been damaged by this experiences.

At the start of Fantastic Four: Three, Doom felt he needed to be "reborn" and was making plans to abdicate his throne and give it to Kristoff when Valeria teleported to his room unexpectely asking for his assistant to help her father. Valeria quickly notices that Doom suffered a mental stroke and makes a deal with him. Valeria tells Doom that she can restore him if he helps Reed and the Fantastic Four. Doom agrees to her proposition.

Doctor Doom is a [[polymath]] scientific genius, depicted constructing numerous devices in order to defeat his foes or gain more power, including a [[Time travel|time machine]], a device to imbue people with superpowers, and numerous [[robot]]s; Doom's calculating and strategic nature leads him to use "Doombots," exact mechanical replicas of the real Doctor Doom, for many missions, typically those where he fears defeat. Sometimes the Doombots even believe themselves to be Doctor Doom.<ref name="FF#258"/> The character has also used his scientific talents to steal or replicate the power of other beings such as the [[Silver Surfer]], or in one case [[the Beyonder]]. Doctor Doom also possesses considerable mystical capabilities due to teachings from Tibetan monks, and tutoring from his lover [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan Le Fey]]. He is capable of energy projection, creating protective shields, and summoning hordes of demonic creatures.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #9-11</ref> The alien [[List of alien races in Marvel Comics#O|Ovoids]] taught Doom the process of psionically transferring his consciousness into another nearby being through a simple eye contact, as well as showing him other forms of technology<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.comiccollectorlive.com/LiveData/Issue.aspx?id=f1d9898a-de86-4635-a252-5459de32e56a |title=Fantastic Four 10 A, Jan 1963 Comic Book by Marvel |publisher=Comiccollectorlive.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-16}}</ref><ref>http://i388.photobucket.com/albums/oo326/OneDumbG0/Doom%20Stats/DoomPowers01-OvoidMindTransfer10.jpg</ref> which Doom uses to escape from [[incarceration]]s and to avoid getting killed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.comiccollectorlive.com/LiveData/Issue.aspx?id=1aeb4290-639e-428b-bcf7-c2c282f190a7 |title=Fantastic Four 287 A, Feb 1986 Comic Book by Marvel |publisher=Comiccollectorlive.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-16}}</ref><ref>http://i388.photobucket.com/albums/oo326/OneDumbG0/Doom%20Stats/DoomPowers05-OvoidMindTransfer287.jpg</ref>  Doom can exert technopathic control over certain machines, most notably, the Doombots. In addition, Doom has a remarkably strong will, as demonstrated in the [[graphic novel]], ''Emperor Doom'' when he dared his prisoner, the mind controlling [[Purple Man]], to attempt to control him and he successfully resists.

Doom's armor augments his natural physical strength to superhuman levels and is highly resistant to harm, at one point even surviving heat levels equal to that of the sun. Doom's armor has been shown to hold its own against Ironman's. In addition, the armor can generate a defensive [[force field]] <ref name="FF#40"/> and a lethal [[electric shock]] killing anyone who might come in contact with Doom.<ref name="FF#40">{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]] | Artist =[[Jack Kirby|Kirby, Jack]] | Story =''The Battle of the Baxter Building!'' | title = Fantastic Four | Volume = | Issue =40 | Date = July 1964 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]| Page = }}</ref> The armor is self-supporting, equipped with internal stores and [[recycling]] systems for [[Earth's atmosphere|air]], [[food]], [[water]], and [[energy]], allowing the wearer to survive lengthy periods of exposure [[underwater]] or in [[outer space]].

As the absolute monarch of Latveria, Dr. Doom has diplomatic immunity and total control of the nation's natural and technological resources, as well as its manpower, economy, and military.

In Fantastic Four 566-569 Doctor Doom received a significant power upgrade. He was thrown back in time (perhaps about 50 million years) by the Marquis of Death. Doom then fought through time and space to get back to present to seek revenge on the Marquis of Death. Doom stated, as he killed the Marquis, he had rebuilt every molecule of his being and increased his power all to destroy the Marquis.

Doctor Doom's status as one of the Fantastic Four's greatest villains<ref name="greatest villains of the FF">{{Cite book|title=Greatest Villains of the Fantastic Four: Introduction |last= Ashford|first=Richard |year= 1995|publisher= Marvel Comics|location= |isbn=0-7851-0079-2 |pages=ii }}</ref> has led to his appearance in many of Marvel's alternate universes and spinoffs, in which the character's history, circumstances and behavior vary from the mainstream setting.

==In other media==
Doctor Doom has been included in almost every  media adaptation of the ''Fantastic Four'' franchise, including [[film]], television, and [[Video game|computer and video games]].

===Television===
* Dr. Doom's first animated appearance was in 1966 on [[Namor|the Sub-Mariner's]] segment of ''[[The Marvel Super Heroes]]''.

* Doom subsequently appeared in several episodes of [[Hanna-Barbera]]'s ''[[Fantastic Four (1967 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]'' series from 1967, where he was voiced by Joseph Sirola.

* In 1978, Dr. Doom appeared in two episodes of [[DePatie-Freleng Enterprises]]' ''[[Fantastic Four (1978 TV series)|The New Fantastic Four]]'' voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]].

* Perhaps most significantly, Dr. Doom appeared in no less than six episodes of the 1981 ''[[Spider-Man (1981 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' series produced by [[Marvel Productions]]. Voiced by Ralph James (with heavy modulation akin to [[Darth Vader]]), the latter five episodes, written by Larry Parr, comprised a complete story arc, and four of them were at one point edited together into an animated feature. He was also the only villain other than [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] to appear in more than one episode.

* Dr. Doom's final 1980s animated appearance was in ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'' voiced by [[Shepard Menken]]. He appeared in an episode entitled "The Fantastic Mr. Frump!"

* In ''[[Fantastic Four (1994 TV series)|The Fantastic Four]]'' (1994–1996), he was voiced by [[John Vernon]] and [[Neil Ross]] in season one and by [[Simon Templeman]] in season two. In "Mask of Doom," he captured the Fantastic Four and forced [[Mister Fantastic]], [[Human Torch]], and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] to go back in time and obtain an object for him. In "Silver Surfer and the Return of Galactus," he steals the Silver Surfer's powers and tries to steal Galactus' powers, only to be thwarted by the planet devourer himself. In "And a Blind Man Shall Lead Them," he struck at a powerless FF and had his hand crushed by the Thing. In "Nightmare in Green," he directed the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] to attack the team. In "Doomsday," he again acquired the [[Power Cosmic]] in the series finale. Once again, he tries to go after Galactus only to hit the barrier that prevents the Silver Surfer from leaving Earth.

* Simon Templeman reprised his role for guest appearances in two episodes of ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1996 TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' (1996–1997), in which Doom held Washington, D.C. captive, only to be defeated by [[She-Hulk]], whom he later attempted to claim revenge upon. With his appearance on this show, it can be assumed that Doom survived the fate he met on the Fantastic Four series, if both shows are to be considered within [[Marvel animated universe|the same continuity]].

* [[Tom Kane]] took over the character for a three-part guest spot in the final season of ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' (1994–1998), reimagining Doom's role in the [[Secret Wars]]. In the third part of the episode, Doom turned part of the alien world he was on into "New Latveria" after overthrowing [[Doctor Octopus]] and renaming Octavia to New Latveria. However, he did not use his ruling powers to oppress, and allowed the aliens in his country to live in peace and harmony, protecting them from the other villains. He even kidnapped the Thing only to cure him of his deformity, turning him back to Ben Grimm, and healed his own face as an afterthought. With Ben's cooperation, he then stole the powers of the [[Beyonder]], and with this newfound power, Doctor Doom sent the other villains back to Earth and almost killed the superheroes that Ben fought along with. However, the Thing turned Doom's weapon on him, and the powers of the Beyonder were returned to the mystic figure himself. Doom was then returned to Earth with no memory of these events (as well as, presumably, his scarred face), along with every other villain and superhero apart from [[Spider-Man]].

* Doom is the main antagonist in ''[[Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes]]'' voiced by [[Paul Dobson (actor)|Paul Dobson]]. In the pilot, "Doomsday", he is revealed to have [[diplomatic immunity]] as a head of state, which means the American police cannot place him under arrest. In one episode where in one of his experiments his mind gets put into Reed Richards, and vice versa, more is revealed about Doom's life and ruling attitude. Doom (with Richards' mind) is now considerably more polite and respectful of others. Reed also commands the [[List of devices used by Doctor Doom#Doombots|Doombots]] to destroy themselves as "word of Doom is law", and releases the face mask. Though the viewer is not shown Doom's face, when Reed and Doom return to their proper bodies, Richards tells Doom that Doom's insecurity, in particular about his personal appearance, is his greatest adversary.

* Doctor Doom appears as the primmary antagonist in the first season of ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]'' voiced by [[Charlie Adler]].

===Film===

{{Main|Fantastic Four (film series)}}
Doctor Doom is the main antagonist from the unreleased [[The Fantastic Four (film)|film based on the Fantastic Four]], which was produced by [[Roger Corman]] in 1994. In it, Doom (portrayed by Joseph Culp) was a college classmate of Reed Richards, who was nearly killed in an accident when both he and Reed try to capture the power of a comet called Colossus. He is also the main [[antagonist]] in the 2005 film ''[[Fantastic Four (film)|Fantastic Four]]'' played by [[Julian McMahon]]. In the film Doctor Doom seems to be more based on his [[Alternate versions of Doctor Doom#Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate counterpart]]. He also returns as a villain in the sequel ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]'' with McMahon reprising the role.

===Video games===
[[Image:Dr Doom v Magneto.png|right|300px|thumb|Doctor Doom fights ''[[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]'' in the 1995 fighting game ''[[Marvel Super Heroes (arcade game)|Marvel Super Heroes]].'']]
* Doctor Doom has appeared in several [[video game]]s. He was the final [[boss (video games)|boss]] in the 1989 [[personal computer game|computer game]] ''[[Spider-Man and Captain America in Doctor Doom's Revenge]]'' and sub-boss in [[Sega]]'s 1991 ''[[Spider-Man: The Video Game|Spider-Man]]'' [[arcade game]]. Later, he was featured as a boss character in the [[Capcom]] [[fighting game]], ''[[Marvel Super Heroes (arcade game)|Marvel Super Heroes]]'', who only became playable after the game was beaten once and a code was entered. He returned as a selectable character in ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes|Marvel vs. Capcom 2]]''. He is particularly notorious for the so-called ''[[Strider (arcade game)|Strider]]/Doom trap'' in the latter game. He also appeared in ''[[Marvel Super Heroes: War of the Gems]]'' for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]].

* He appeared in [[Fantastic Four (2005 video game)|the game based upon the 2005 Fantastic 4 movie]] voiced by Julian McMahon.

* He is an exclusive character for the [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] version of ''[[Marvel Nemesis: Rise of the Imperfects]]''.

* He was confirmed to be a playable character in ''[[Marvel Nemesis 2|Marvel Nemesis 2: Fall of the Imperfects]]'', until the game was canceled.

* In the special edition of ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', the player will view concept art that shows [[Abner Jenkins#Ultimate Beetle|the Beetle]] presenting [[Ultimate Sandman|the Sandman vial]] to Doctor Doom after Beetle has evaded [[Spider-Man]].

* Doctor Doom is the primary antagonist of ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'' voiced by [[Clive Revill]]. [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]] and [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] have special dialogue with him. In the game, he attempts (and succeeds) in stealing the power of [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]]. To do this, he forms a new [[Masters of Evil]] and makes a pact with [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] to obtain his Twilight Sword. It was mentioned that Doctor Doom corrupted [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]] when she was looking for the [[Ultimate Nullifier]] on [[Muir Island]]. While the players were obtaining the Muonic Inducer and the [[M'Kraan Crystal]], Doctor Doom defeated every hero that tried to stop him and discovered that Odin's powers allowed him to corrupt the defeated heroes (such as [[Psylocke]], [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], [[Professor X]], [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]], [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], [[Emma Frost]], and the [[Punisher]], in the Doom's Day cutscene) into his dark superhero army, and then used it to corrupt Earth. It was also discovered that he can use the powers of Odin to create evil clones of superheroes out of nothingness resulting in the creations of Dark [[Captain America]], Dark [[Spider-Man]], Dark [[Iron Man]], Dark [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], and the Dark [[Fantastic Four]] and corrupted [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], [[Cyclops]] and [[Psylocke]]. At the end of the game, once Doom is defeated, Odin's powers are returned and he strikes Doom with a bolt of lightning, leaving only the villain's mask. Thor later states Doom is in the possession of Odin along with Loki (the reason as to which Odin is "occupied" as Thor put it.) Doom is a playable character downloadable for owners of the [[Xbox 360]] version of the game. If the player uses Doctor Doom and challenges himself in the last level, the game takes a strange but interesting turn. The Doctor Doom that is fought is, in reality, a Doctor Doom from a future in which [[Ragnarök]] has occurred, and all the gods of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] are dead. Doctor Doom, in an attempt to remedy this, travels to the present to usurp the power of Odin, and in the process, forms the Masters of Evil. However, the Doom from the present notices the presence of Doombots uncontrolled by himself, suspecting Reed Richards or [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]]. It is only until he meets his future self that he realizes that it is necessary to defeat the future Doom to keep the world from being destroyed, even though he is not without reluctance of relinquishing command over the power of Odin. This gives a complex and positive vision about the character and shows his high sense of honor.

* Doctor Doom appears in the ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer (video game)|Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]'' video game voiced by [[Gideon Emery]]. He plays a bigger role in the game than in the film as after he acquires the Surfer's powers, he intends to use them to fight [[Galactus]] and save Earth (though he only does this so he can conquer it afterwards). Unlike the film, he builds a machine to strip Galactus of most of his cosmic power for himself, but the F4 use his machine against him to defeat him.

* A statue of Doctor Doom is seen in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2]]''. When the player asks Thor on how Asgard is doing if one speaks to him after the Latverian mission, Thor mentions that he and Loki are still being punished by Odin. Though it is said Doom is dead. Doom is also mentioned as one of the villains who could control the nanite-infected humans, despite the fact he is considered deceased. A dossier on Doom can be found in Latveria.

* Doctor Doom appears in the ''[[Marvel Super Hero Squad (video game)|Marvel Super Hero Squad]]'' video game voiced by [[Charlie Adler]]. Regular, Ultimate, and Professor versions of Doom appear.

* Doctor Doom appears as a playable character in ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds]]''. He is one of the key characters in the game's plot, in which he joins forces with [[Albert Wesker]] (from ''[[Resident Evil (series)|Resident Evil]]'') to unite the Marvel and Capcom worlds so he can conquer both.

* Doctor Doom will appear in the ''[[Marvel Super Hero Squad: The Infinity Gauntlet]]'' video game.

Dr. Doom is mentioned in the song "Super Villain" by [[Powerman 5000]].

==Cultural impact==
In the book ''Superhero: The Secret Origin of a Genre'', [[Peter Coogan]] writes that Doctor Doom's appearance was representative of a change in the portrayal of "mad scientists" to full-fledged villains, often with upgraded powers.<ref name="Comics 166">{{Cite web|author=[[Peter Sanderson|Sanderson, Peter]]|date=2007-02-24|url=http://www.quickstopentertainment.com/2007/02/24/comics-in-context-166-megahero-vs-megavillain/|title=Comics in Context #166: Megahero Vs.

''Comic Book Resources'' ranks Doom as their fourth favorite Marvel character. Journalist Brent Ecenbarger cited him being able to "''stand up against entities like [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], the [[Beyonder]], and [[Galactus]] and often come out on top''", as well as the tragedy of any "''other number of circumstances could have led to Doom being a savior, but as it is, instead he remains Marvel’s greatest villain.''" Fellow journalist Jason Stanhope called his "''master[ing] of sorcery and technology an unusual combination''", and also felt "''his inner sense of nobility sets him apart from lesser villains, in a similar manner to [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]].''"<ref>{{Cite web| author = Brian Cronin | title = Top 50 Marvel Characters #4 | work = [[Comic Book Resources]] | date = 2007-09-26 | url = http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/09/26/top-50-marvel-characters-4/ | accessdate=2008-02-14}}</ref> Doom has also been favorably regarded by those who wrote for the character; Stan Lee declared Doom his favorite villain, saying "''[Doom] could come to the United States and he could do almost anything, and we could not arrest him because he has [[diplomatic immunity]].
