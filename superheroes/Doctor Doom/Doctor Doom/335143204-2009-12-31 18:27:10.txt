'''Victor von Doom''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[publications]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], the character first appeared in ''Fantastic Four'' #5 (July 1962). A recurring [[supervillain]] and leader of the [[Marvel Universe]] nation of [[Latveria]], Doom is both a genius inventor and a sorceror, and has fought numerous other superheroes in his various plots for power and/or revenge over the years. A frequent plot device is to reveal at a story's end that the heroes were actually fighting one of Doom's many robot doubles, either working on his behalf, or a [[Doombot]] gone rogue impersonating him.

The character of Doctor Doom has featured in other Marvel-endorsed products such as [[feature films]]; [[video games]]; [[television series]] and merchandise such as [[action figures]] and [[trading cards]].

==Publication history==
===Creation and development===

Like many of Marvel's first characters, Doctor Doom was conceived by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]]. With the ''Fantastic Four'' title performing well, Lee and Kirby were trying to dream up a "''soul-stirring…super sensational new villain.''"<ref name="bad guys 12">{{cite book |title=''Bring On the Bad Guys!'' |last= Lee|first=Stan |authorlink=Stan Lee |year=1976 |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |location= New York|isbn= |pages= 12}}</ref> Looking for a name, Lee latched onto "Doctor Doom" as "''eloquent in its simplicity — magnificent in its implied menace.''"<ref name="bad guys 12"/> 

[[Image:DrDoomkirbyff2.jpg|thumb|left|''Fantastic Four'' #5 (July 1962), Doctor Doom's first appearance.]]

Due to the rush to publish, the character was not given a full [[origin story]] in his debut<ref name="bad guys 12"/> (except when Reed mentions that he scarred his face while attempting to contact the Netherworld in Reed's university, he was expelled and last heard of searching Tibet for magical secrets) - until two years later in ''Fantastic Four Annual'' #2.<ref name="bad guys 13">{{cite book |title=''Bring On the Bad Guys!'' |last= Lee|first=Stan |authorlink=Stan Lee |year=1976 |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |location= New York|isbn= |pages= 13}}</ref> Lee established Doom's origins as the son of gypsies, born decades ago in Latveria when it was ruled by an unnamed nobleman called the Baron. Doom's mother was a [[witchcraft|witch]], a fact his father tried to hide from the young boy; when his father is killed by the Baron's men unjustly, Doom discovers his mother's occult instruments and swears revenge on the Baron. Doom grows into a headstrong and brilliant man, who attracts the attention of the dean of [[Empire State University]].<ref name=origin/> Offered the chance to study in America, Doom leaves his homeland behind and meets a fellow student named [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]], though Doom disregards his peers. Richards tries to warn Doom about continuing a flawed experiment to communicate with the dead, but Doom continues on; the resulting explosion severely damages Doom's face.<ref name=origin>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]] | Artist =[[Jack Kirby|Kirby, Jack]] | Story =''Origin of Doctor Doom'' | Title = ''Fantastic Four Annual''| Volume = | Issue =2 | year = 1964 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> Expelled after the accident, Doom travels the world, eventually being found by a clan of monks in [[Tibet]]. Mastering the monks' disciplines, he becomes their master and forges himself a suit of armor, complete with a mask that can only be removed by him.<ref name=origin/> Doom then returns to menace those he feels are responsible for his accident - including Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four.

Jack Kirby modeled Doom after [[Death (personification)|Death]], with the armor standing in for that character's skeleton; "''It was the reason for the armor and the hood. Death is connected with armor and the inhuman-like steel. Death is something without mercy, and human flesh contains that mercy.''"<ref name=death>{{cite book |title=''The Silver Age of Comic Book Art'' | last = Schumer | first = Arlen |year=2003 |publisher=Collectors Press |isbn=1-888054-85-9 |pages= 76}}</ref> Kirby further described Doom as being "paranoid", wrecked by his twisted face and wanting the whole world to be like him.<ref name=death/> Kirby went on to say that "''Doom is an evil person, but he's not always been evil. He was [respected]…but through a flaw in his own character, he was a perfectionist.''"<ref name="kirby collected">{{cite book |title=''The Collected Jack Kirby Collector'' |last=Morrow |first=John |authorlink= |coauthors= Kirby, Jack|year=2006 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |location= |isbn=1-893905-57-8 |pages= 101}}</ref> At one point in the Seventies, Kirby drew his interpretation of what Doom would look like under the mask, giving Doom only "''a tiny scar on his cheek.''"<ref name="silver kirby">{{cite book |title=''The Silver Age of Comic Book Art'' | last = Schumer | first = Arlen |year=2003 |publisher=Collectors Press |isbn=1-888054-85-9 |pages= 77}}</ref> Due to this slight imperfection, Doom hides his face not from the world, but from himself.<ref name="silver kirby"/> To Kirby, this is the motivation for Doom's vengeance against the world; because others are superior due to this slight scar, Doom wants to elevate himself above them.<ref name="kirby collected"/> Typical of Lee's writing characterization of Doom is his arrogance; his pride leads to Doom's disfigurement at the hands of his own machine, and to the failures of many of his schemes.<ref name="''Marvel Encyclopedia''">{{cite book |title=''Marvel Encyclopedia Vol. 6: Fantastic Four'' | last = Christiansen | first = Jeff |year=2004 |publisher=Marvel Entertainment Group|location=New York |isbn= |pages= 63–66}}</ref>

While the Fantastic Four had fought various villains such as the [[Mole Man]], [[Skrull]]s, the [[Miracle Man]], and [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]], Doctor Doom managed to overshadow them all and became the Fantastic Four's [[archnemesis]].<ref name="greatest villains of the FF"/> 

During the 1970s, Doom branched out to more Marvel titles, with a battle between Doom and Prince Rudolfo over control of [[Latveria]] being featured in ''[[Astonishing Tales]]''.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Roy Thomas|Thomas, Roy]] | Artist =[[Wally Wood|Wood, Wally]] | Story =''Revolution!'' | Title = ''Astonishing Tales'' | Volume = | Issue =2-6 | Date =October 1970-June 1971 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]| Page = }}</ref> Doom also attempts to use the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] as his slave during two issues of ''The Incredible Hulk''.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Roy Thomas|Thomas, Roy]] | Artist =[[Dick Ayers|Ayers, Dick]] | Story =''Sanctuary!'' | Title =''Incredible Hulk''| Volume = | Issue =143 | Date =September 1971 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> The character also made several appearances in the story arcs of ''[[Super-Villain Team-Up]]'', starting in 1975, as well as appearances in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'', beginning with issue #42 (February 1976). Doom's origin was further elaborated on; a childhood companion, Valeria, was introduced and it was established Cynthia von Doom had sold her soul to [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]].<ref>{{Cite comic | writer = [[Gerry Conway|Conway, Gerry]] | artist =[[Gene Colan|Colan, Gene]] | title = ''[[Astonishing Tales]]'' | volume = 1 | issue = 8 | year = 1971 | publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

===1980s-1990s===
1981 saw Marvel and [[DC Comics]] collaborate on another project.  In 1976 the two companies had published ''[[Superman vs. the Amazing Spider-Man]]'', and seeking to replicate that success the two companies again teamed the characters up, in ''[[Superman and Spider-Man]]''.  Marvel [[editor in chief]] [[Jim Shooter]] co-wrote the story alongside [[Marv Wolfman]], and recalled choosing Doom based on his iconic status: "I figured I needed the heaviest-duty bad guy we had to offer — Doctor Doom. Their greatest hero against our greatest villain."<ref>{{cite book|last=Eury|first=Michael|title=The Krypton Companion|publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing|year=2006|pages=77|isbn=1893905616}}</ref>

The same year saw [[John Byrne]] began his six-year run writing and illustrating ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' in 1981, sparking a "second golden age" for the title<ref>{{cite book |title=''The Slings & Arrows Comic Guide'' | last = Plowright | first = Frank |year=1997 |publisher=Aurum Press |isbn= |pages= }}</ref> but also attempting to "''turn the clock back [...] get back and see fresh what it was that made the book great at its inception.''"<ref>{{cite book |title=''Current Biography Yearbook'' | last = Mari | first = Christopher |year=2000 |publisher=H.W. Wilson, Co |isbn= |pages= 81}}</ref> Doom made his first appearance under Byrne's tenure with issue #236.<ref>{{Cite comic | Cartoonist = [[John Byrne|Byrne, John]]| Story =''Terror in a Tiny Town'' | Title = ''Fantastic Four'' | Volume = | Issue =236 | Date = November 1981 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | Page = }}</ref> Whereas Kirby had intimated that Doom's disfigurement was more a figment of Victor's vain personality, Byrne expressed that Doom's face was truly ravaged; only Doom's own robot slaves are allowed to see the monarch without his helmet.<ref name="FF#258"/> Byrne also emphasized other aspects of Doom's personality; despite his ruthless nature, Doom is a man of his word.<ref name=religion>{{cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/lit/comics/DoctorDoom.html |title=The Religious Affiliation of Comic Book Character Victor Von Doom|date=2005-12-10|accessdate=2008-02-12|work=Adherents.com|author=Staff}}</ref> However, some stories reveal he actually doesn't care about his devoted people of Latveria<ref>http://i388.photobucket.com/albums/oo326/OneDumbG0/DoomEvil03381.jpg</ref> (though they think he does) or his henchmen;<ref>http://i388.photobucket.com/albums/oo326/OneDumbG0/Doom%20Fights/DoomPowerCosmic0157.jpg</ref> returning to Latveria after being temporarily deposed, Doom abandons a scheme to wrest mystical secrets from [[Doctor Strange]] in order to oversee his land's reconstruction.<ref name="FF#258">{{Cite comic | Cartoonist = [[John Byrne|Byrne, John]]| Story =''Interlude'' | Title = ''Fantastic Four'' | Volume = | Issue =258 | Date = September 1983 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | Page = }}</ref> Though possessing a tempestuous temper, Doom also occasionally shows warmth and empathy to others; he tries to free his mother from [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] and treats [[Kristoff Vernard]] like his own son.<ref name="FF#258"/> Byrne also gave further detail regarding Doom's scarring; Byrne used the idea that the accident at Empire State University only left Doom with a small scar; when Doom puts on the armor forged for him when it had yet to cool, however, he truly damages his face.<ref>{{Cite comic | cartoonist = [[John Byrne|Byrne, John]] | Story =''True Lies'' | Title = ''Fantastic Four'' | Volume = 1 | Issue =278 | year = 1985 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

After Byrne's departure Doctor Doom continued to be a major villain in ''Fantastic Four'', and as the 1980s continued Doom appeared in other comics such as ''[[Punisher]]'', ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', and ''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]''. In ''Fantastic Four'' #350, writer [[Walt Simonson]] introduced the idea of Doom being on a journey through time and space, only returning to Earth on occasion. Simonson's [[retroactive continuity|retcon]] was done so readers could assume that any of the character's appearances that they found odd were in fact [[List of devices used by Doctor Doom#Doombots|Doombots]]. An [[urban legend]] states that Simonson drew up a list of official stories which featured the real Doom and those which did not.<ref>{{cite web | author = Cronin, Brian | title = ''Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed'' #100 | work = [[Comic Book Resources]] | date = 2007-04-26 | url = http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/04/26/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-100/ | accessdate=2008-02-14}}</ref>

===Modern depictions===
In 2003, Doom was the sole villain in the ''Fantastic Four'' story arc "''Unthinkable''", in which Doom imprisons [[Franklin Richards]] in Hell and captures [[Valeria Richards]] and succeeds in catching the Fantastic Four. Writer Mark Waid sought to redefine Doom's character in a way that had not been seen before.<!-- add the interview ref here --> In Waid's reinterpretation, Doom hates Richards for knowing at his core he was right when Doom was wrong.<ref>{{cite web|author=Brady, Matt|date=2003-01-23|url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=1041|title=Waid thinks the Unthinkable|work=[[Newsarama]]|accessdate=2008-02-20}}</ref><ref name="FFManifisto">{{cite book|last=Waid|first=Mark|authorlink=Mark Waid|title=[http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0785114866 ''Fantastic Four Volume One'']|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=2004-08-01|location=New York|pages=''The Fantastic Four Manifesto''|isbn=0785114866}}</ref> Waid was also convinced that the "''truism that Victor Von Doom is, despite his villainy, a noble man''" (as suggested in Byrne's run) "is absolute crap. [...] A man [Doom] whose entire motivating force is jealousy is ridiculously petty, not grandly noble. Yes, Doom is ''regal'', and yes, whenever possible, Doom likes to ''act'' as if he possesses great moral character, because to him that's what great men ''have''... — but when I hear Doom say it 'does not ''suit'' him to' do this-and-such, what I hear is, 'it has nothing to do with my hatred for Reed Richards, so it's not worth my time.'" Waid also stated that Doom "''would tear the head off a newborn baby and eat it like an apple while his mother watched if it would somehow prove he were smarter than Reed.''"<ref name="FFManifisto"/>  Waid punctuated this reinterpretation of Doom  during his "Unthinkable" saga (Vol 2 #66-70 & Vol 1 (restart) #500) as an absolute sadist by having Von Doom ruthlessly murder Valeria, his first love and granddaughter to his long serving faithful retainer Boris. Having renounced science, Doom sacrifices Valeria to a cabal of demons and turns her skin into a suit of leather armor, greatly augmenting his newly-found magical prowess.

In 2005 and 2006, Doom was featured in his own limited series, ''Books of Doom'', a retelling of the origin story by [[Ed Brubaker]].<ref name="books of doom interview">{{cite web|author=Brady, Matt|date=2005-10-27|url=http://www.newsarama.com/marvelnew/Nov_previews/BruDoom.htm|title=Brubaker on ''Books of Doom''|work=[[Newsarama]]|accessdate=2008-02-14}}</ref> In an interview, Brubaker said the series was a way to elaborate on the earlier portions of Doom's life which had not been seen often in the comics. The series also set out to determine if Doom's path from troubled child to dictator was fated or Doom's own faults led to his corruption — in essence, a [[nature versus nurture]] question.<ref>{{cite web|author=Tramountanas, George|date=2005-10-07|title=Brubaker of Deflowering Doom|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=6014|work=[[Comic Book Resources]]|accessdate=2008-02-13}}</ref> Brubaker's version of Doom was heavily influenced by the original Lee/Kirby version; responding to a question if he would show Doom's face, Brubaker stated "''following Kirby's example, I think it's better not to show it.''"<ref name="books of doom interview"/>

[[Image:Doomcosmicpower.jpg|thumb|right|Doctor Doom steals the [[Silver Surfer]]'s powers in ''Fantastic Four'' #57 (1966). Art by Jack Kirby.]]

Doctor Doom is a [[polymath]] scientific genius, depicted constructing numerous devices in order to defeat his foes or gain more power, including a [[Time travel|time machine]], a device to imbue people with superpowers, and numerous [[robot]]s; Doom's calculating and strategic nature leads him to use "Doombots," exact mechanical replicas of the real Doctor Doom, for many missions, typically those where he fears defeat, sometimes the Doombots even believe themselves to be Doctor Doom.<ref name="FF#258"/> The character has also used his scientific talents to steal or replicate the power of other beings such as the [[Silver Surfer]], or in one case the [[the Beyonder]]. Doctor Doom also possesses considerable mystical capabilities due to teachings from Tibetan monks, and tutoring from his lover [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan Le Fey]]. He is capable of energy projection, creating protective shields, and summoning hordes of demonic creatures.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #9-11</ref> The alien [[List of alien races in Marvel Comics#O|Ovoids]] taught Doom the process of psionically transferring his consciousness into another nearby being through a simple eye contact<ref>http://www.comiccollectorlive.com/LiveData/Issue.aspx?id=f1d9898a-de86-4635-a252-5459de32e56a</ref><ref>http://i388.photobucket.com/albums/oo326/OneDumbG0/Doom%20Stats/DoomPowers01-OvoidMindTransfer10.jpg</ref>, which Doom uses to escape from [[incarceration]]s and to avoid getting killed.<ref>http://www.comiccollectorlive.com/LiveData/Issue.aspx?id=1aeb4290-639e-428b-bcf7-c2c282f190a7</ref><ref>http://i388.photobucket.com/albums/oo326/OneDumbG0/Doom%20Stats/DoomPowers05-OvoidMindTransfer287.jpg</ref>  In addition, Doom has a remarkably strong will, as demonstrated in the [[graphic novel]], ''Emperor Doom'' when he dared his prisoner, the mind controlling [[Purple Man]], to attempt to control him and he successfully resisted the attempt.

Doom's armor augments his natural physical strength to superhuman levels and is highly resistant to harm, at one point even surviving heat levels equal to that of the sun. In addition, the armor can generate a defensive [[force field]] <ref name="FF#40"/> and a massive [[electric shock]] disabling anyone who might come in contact with Doom.<ref name="FF#40">{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]] | Artist =[[Jack Kirby|Kirby, Jack]] | Story =''The Battle of the Baxter Building!'' | Title = ''Fantastic Four'' | Volume = | Issue =40 | Date = July 1964 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]| Page = }}</ref> The armor is self-supporting, equipped with internal stores and [[recycling]] systems for [[Earth's atmosphere|air]], [[food]], [[water]], and [[energy]], allowing the wearer to survive lengthy periods of exposure [[underwater]] or in [[outer space]].

As the absolute monarch of Latveria, Dr Doom has diplomatic immunity and total control of the nation's natural and technological resources, as well as its manpower, economy, and military.

In Fantastic Four 556-559 Doctor Doom received a significant power upgrade. He was thrown back in time (perhaps about 30 million years) by the Marquis of Death. Doom then fought time and space to get back to present to seek revenge on the Marquis of Death. Doom stated, as he killed the Marquis, he had rebuilt every molecule of his being and increased his power all to destroy the Marquis.

Doctor Doom's status as one of the Fantastic Four's greatest villains<ref name="greatest villains of the FF">{{cite book |title=''Greatest Villains of the Fantastic Four: Introduction'' |last= Ashford|first=Richard |year= 1995|publisher= Marvel Comics|location= |isbn=0-7851-0079-2 |pages=ii }}</ref> has led to his appearance in many of Marvel's alternate universes and spinoffs, in which the character's history, circumstances and behavior vary from the mainstream setting.

==In other media==
{{Main|Doctor Doom in other media}}

Doctor Doom as an enemy of the Fantastic Four, has been included in almost every media adaptation of the Fantastic Four franchise—including film, television, and computer and video games—as well as other media set in the Marvel Universe.

==Cultural impact==
In the book ''Superhero: The Secret Origin of a Genre'', [[Peter Coogan]] writes that Doctor Doom's appearance was representative of a change in the portrayal of "mad scientists" to full-fledged villains, often with upgraded powers.<ref name="Comics 166">{{cite web|author=[[Peter Sanderson|Sanderson, Peter]]|date=2007-02-24|url=http://www.quickstopentertainment.com/2007/02/24/comics-in-context-166-megahero-vs-megavillain/|title=Comics in Context #166: Megahero Vs. Megavillain|work=QuickStopEntertainment.com|accessdate=2008-02-13}}</ref> Doom is also emblematic of a specific ''subset'' of supervillain, which comic book critic [[Peter Sanderson]] describes as a "mega[[villain]]".<ref name="Comics 166"/> These supervillains are genre-crossing villains who exist in adventures "in a world in which the ordinary laws of nature are slightly suspended"; characters such as [[Professor Moriarty]], [[Count Dracula]], [[Auric Goldfinger]], [[Hannibal Lecter]], and [[Darth Vader]], also fit this description.<ref name="Comics 166"/> Sanderson also found traces of [[William Shakespeare]]’s characters Richard III and [[Iago]] in Doctor Doom; all of them "are descended from the 'vice' figure of medieval drama", who address the audience in monologues detailing their thoughts and ambitions.<ref name="Comics 165">{{cite web|author=[[Peter Sanderson|Sanderson, Peter]]|date=2007-02-17|url=http://www.quickstopentertainment.com/2007/02/17/comics-in-context-165-the-supervillain-defined/|title=Comics in Context #165: The Supervillain Defined|work=QuickStopEntertainment.com|accessdate=2008-02-13}}</ref>

''Comic Book Resources'' ranks Doom as their fourth favorite Marvel character. Journalist Brent Ecenbarger cited him being able to "''stand up against entities like [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], the [[Beyonder]], and [[Galactus]] and often come out on top''", as well as the tragedy of any "''other number of circumstances could have led to Doom being a savior, but as it is, instead he remains Marvel’s greatest villain.''" Fellow journalist Jason Stanhope called his "''master[ing] of sorcery and technology an unusual combination''", and also felt "''his inner sense of nobility sets him apart from lesser villains, in a similar manner to [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]].''"<ref>{{cite web | author = Brian Cronin | title = Top 50 Marvel Characters #4 | work = [[Comic Book Resources]] | date = 2007-09-26 | url = http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/09/26/top-50-marvel-characters-4/ | accessdate=2008-02-14}}</ref> Doom has also been favorably regarded by those who wrote for the character; Stan Lee declared Doom his favorite villain, saying "''[Doom] could come to the United States and he could do almost anything, and we could not arrest him because he has [[diplomatic immunity]]. Also, he wants to rule the world and if you think about it, wanting to rule the world is not a crime.''"<ref name="voa q and a">{{cite web|date=2007-08-15|author=Brummett, Erin|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/15-August-2007-Chat-Transcript-Stan-Lee.cfm|title=VOA Online Discussion: Comic Book Heroes|work=[[Voice of America]]|accessdate=2008-02-02}}</ref> [[Mark Waid]] echoed Lee's assessment of the character, stating that Doom "''[has] got a great look, a great visual design [and] a dynamite origin.''"<ref>{{cite web|author=Contino, Jennifer|date=2003-05-29|title=Waid's Fantastic Quartet|url=http://www.comicon.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&f=36&t=001050|work=ComicCon.com|accessdate=2008-02-14}}</ref>
