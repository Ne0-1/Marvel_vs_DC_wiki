'''Doctor Doom''' ('''Victor von Doom''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] that appears in [[publications]] by [[Marvel Comics]]. The son of [[Romani people|Romani]] witch [[Cynthia Von Doom]], Doctor Doom is a recurring [[supervillain]], [[archenemy]] of the [[Fantastic Four]], and leader of the fictional nation of [[Latveria]]. He is both a genius inventor and a sorcerer. While his chief opponents have been the Fantastic Four, he has also come into conflict with [[Spider-Man]] and other superheroes in the [[Marvel Universe]].

Doctor Doom has made many appearances in [[video games]], [[television series]], and merchandise such as [[action figures]] and [[trading cards]]. He was ranked as the 4th Greatest Villain by [[Wizard (magazine)|''Wizard'']] on its 100 Greatest Villains of All Time list.<ref>McCallum, Pat (July 2006). "100 Greatest Villains Ever". ''[[Wizard magazine|Wizard]]'' (177)</ref> [[IGN]]'s list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time ranked Doctor Doom  as #3.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/3.html |title=Doctor Doom is Number 3 |publisher=Comics.ign.com |accessdate=2010-06-17}}</ref> He has also been featured in other Marvel-endorsed [[feature films]] such as ''[[The Fantastic Four (film)|The Fantastic Four]]'' played by [[Joseph Culp]], while actor [[Julian McMahon]] played him in the 2005 film ''[[Fantastic Four (film)|Fantastic Four]]'' and its 2007 sequel ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]'' as the film's antagonist. Doctor Doom will be featured again in the upcoming new 2015 reboot ''[[The Fantastic Four (2015 film)|The Fantastic Four]]'' portrayed by [[Toby Kebbell]].

==Publication history==
Created by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist/co-plotter [[Jack Kirby]], the character first appeared in ''The Fantastic Four'' #5 (July 1962) wearing his trademark metal mask and green cloak.

===Creation and development===
Like many of Marvel's [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] characters, Doctor Doom was conceived by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]]. With the ''Fantastic Four'' title performing well, Lee and Kirby were trying to dream up a "soul-stirring…super sensational new villain."<ref name="bad guys 12">{{Cite book|title=Bring On the Bad Guys! |last= Lee|first=Stan |authorlink=Stan Lee |year=1976 |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |location= New York|isbn= |page= 12}}</ref> Looking for a name, Lee latched onto "Doctor Doom" as "eloquent in its simplicity — magnificent in its implied menace."<ref name="bad guys 12"/>

[[File:DrDoomkirbyff2.jpg|thumb|left|''Fantastic Four'' #5 (July 1962), Doctor Doom's first appearance.]]

Due to the rush to publish, the character was not given a full [[origin story]]<ref name="bad guys 12"/> until ''Fantastic Four Annual'' #2, two years after his debut.<ref name="bad guys 13">{{Cite book|title=Bring On the Bad Guys! |last= Lee|first=Stan |authorlink=Stan Lee |year=1976 |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |location= New York|isbn= |page= 13}}</ref>

Jack Kirby modeled Doctor Doom after [[Death (personification)|Death]], with the armor standing in for that character's skeleton; "It was the reason for the armor and the hood. Death is connected with armor and the inhuman-like steel. Death is something without mercy, and human flesh contains that mercy."<ref name=death>{{Cite book|title=The Silver Age of Comic Book Art | last = Schumer | first = Arlen |year=2003 |publisher=Collectors Press |isbn=1-888054-85-9 |page= 76}}</ref> Kirby further described Doctor Doom  as being "paranoid", wrecked by his twisted face and wanting the whole world to be like him.<ref name=death/> Kirby went on to say that "Doctor Doom  is an evil person, but he's not always been evil. He was [respected]…but through a flaw in his own character, he was a perfectionist."<ref name="kirby collected">{{Cite book|title=The Collected Jack Kirby Collector |last=Morrow |first=John |authorlink= |author2=Kirby, Jack|year=2006 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |location= |isbn=1-893905-57-8 |page= 101}}</ref> At one point in the 1970s, Kirby drew his interpretation of what Doctor Doom  would look like under the mask, giving Doctor Doom  only "a tiny scar on his cheek."<ref name="silver kirby">{{Cite book|title=The Silver Age of Comic Book Art | last = Schumer | first = Arlen |year=2003 |publisher=Collectors Press |isbn=1-888054-85-9 |page= 77}}</ref> Due to this slight imperfection, Doctor Doom  hides his face not from the world, but from himself.<ref name="silver kirby"/> To Kirby, this is the motivation for Doctor Doom 's vengeance against the world; because others are superior due to this slight scar, Doom wants to elevate himself above them.<ref name="kirby collected"/> Typical of Lee's writing characterization of Doctor Doom  is his arrogance; his pride leads to Doctor Doom's disfigurement at the hands of his own machine, and to the failures of many of his schemes.<ref name="Marvel Encyclopedia">{{Cite book|title=Marvel Encyclopedia Vol. 6: Fantastic Four | last = Christiansen | first = Jeff |year=2004 |publisher=Marvel Entertainment Group|location=New York |isbn= |pages= 63–66}}</ref> There is also an idea that Doctor Doom placed his mask on his face before it was fully cool, burning his face. In some early stories glimpses of his face are shown, in which he appears to be bald.

While the Fantastic Four had fought various villains such as the [[Mole Man]], [[Skrull]]s, the [[Miracle Man]], and [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]], Doctor Doom managed to overshadow them all and became the Fantastic Four's [[archnemesis]].<ref name="greatest villains of the FF"/>

During the 1970s, Doctor Doom  branched out to more Marvel titles such as ''[[Astonishing Tales]]'',<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Roy Thomas|Thomas, Roy]] | Artist =[[Wally Wood|Wood, Wally]] | Story =''Revolution!'' | title = Astonishing Tales | Volume = | Issue =2-6 | Date =October 1970-June 1971 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]| Page = }}</ref> ''[[Hulk (comics)|The Incredible Hulk]]'',<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Roy Thomas|Thomas, Roy]] | Artist =[[Dick Ayers|Ayers, Dick]] | Story =''Sanctuary!'' | Title =Incredible Hulk| Volume = | Issue =143 | date =September 1971 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> and ''[[Super-Villain Team-Up]]'', starting in 1975, as well as appearances in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'', beginning with issue #42 (February 1976). Doctor Doom 's origin was also a feature in ''Astonishing Tales'' when his ties to the villain [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] were revealed.<ref>{{Cite comic | writer = [[Gerry Conway|Conway, Gerry]] | artist =[[Gene Colan|Colan, Gene]] | title = [[Astonishing Tales]] | volume = 1 | issue = 8 | date = 1971 | publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

===1980s-1990s===
1981 saw Marvel and [[DC Comics]] collaborate on another project. In 1976 the two companies had published ''[[Superman vs. the Amazing Spider-Man]]'', and seeking to replicate that success the two companies again teamed the characters up, in ''[[Superman and Spider-Man]]''.  Marvel [[editor in chief]] [[Jim Shooter]] co-wrote the story alongside [[Marv Wolfman]], and recalled choosing Doctor Doom  based on his iconic status: "I figured I needed the heaviest-duty bad guy we had to offer — Doctor Doom. Their greatest hero against our greatest villain."<ref>{{Cite book|last=Eury|first=Michael|title=The Krypton Companion|publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing|year=2006|page=77|isbn=1-893905-61-6}}</ref>

The same year saw [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] begin his six-year run writing and illustrating ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' in 1981, sparking a "second golden age" for the title<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Slings & Arrows Comic Guide | last = Plowright | first = Frank |year=1997 |publisher=Aurum Press |isbn= |pages= }}</ref> but also attempting to "''turn the clock back [...] get back and see fresh what it was that made the book great at its inception.''"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Current Biography Yearbook | last = Mari | first = Christopher |year=2000 |publisher=H.W. Wilson, Co |isbn= |page= 81}}</ref> Doctor Doom  made his first appearance under Byrne's tenure with issue #236.<ref>{{Cite comic | Cartoonist = [[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]]| Story =''Terror in a Tiny Town'' | title = Fantastic Four | Volume = | Issue =236 | date = November 1981 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | Page = }}</ref> Whereas Kirby had intimated that Doom's disfigurement was more a figment of Victor's vain personality, Byrne expressed that Doctor Doom 's face was truly ravaged; only Doctor Doom 's own robot slaves are allowed to see the monarch without his helmet.<ref name="FF#258"/> Byrne also emphasized other aspects of Doom's personality; despite his ruthless nature, Doctor Doom  is a man of honor.<ref name=religion>{{cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/lit/comics/DoctorDoom.html |title=The Religious Affiliation of Comic Book Character Victor Von Doom|date=2005-12-10|accessdate=2008-02-12|work=Adherents.com|author=Staff}}</ref><ref>http://i388.photobucket.com/albums/oo326/OneDumbG0/Doom%20Fights/DoomPowerCosmic0157.jpg</ref> returning to Latveria after being temporarily deposed, Doctor Doom  abandons a scheme to wrest mystical secrets from [[Doctor Strange]] in order to oversee his land's reconstruction.<ref name="FF#258">{{Cite comic | Cartoonist = [[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]]| Story =''Interlude'' | title = Fantastic Four | Volume = | Issue =258 | date = September 1983 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | Page = }}</ref> Though possessing a tempestuous temper, Doctor Doom  also occasionally shows warmth and empathy to others; he tries to free his mother from [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] and treats [[Kristoff Vernard]] like his own son.<ref name="FF#258"/> Byrne also gave further detail regarding Doom's scarring; Byrne used the idea that the accident at Empire State University only left Doctor Doom with a small scar that was exaggerated into a more disfiguring accident by Doctor Doom's own arrogance; when Doctor Doom  puts on the armor forged for him when it had yet to cool, however, he truly damages his face.<ref>{{Cite comic | cartoonist = [[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]] | Story =''True Lies'' | title = Fantastic Four | Volume = 1 | Issue =278 | date = 1985 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

After Byrne's departure Doctor Doom continued to be a major villain in ''Fantastic Four'', and as the 1980s continued Doom appeared in other comics such as ''[[Punisher]]'', ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', and ''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]''. Under Fantastic Four writer Steven Englehart, Doctor Doom  became exiled from Latveria by his heir Kristoff, who was brainwashed into thinking he was Doctor Doom. Doctor Doom  would spend most of his time in exile planning his return, but Englehart left the title before he could resolve the storyline. This storyline ultimately ended with the controversial  ''Fantastic Four'' #350, where writer [[Walt Simonson]] had the Doctor Doom  who had been seen in the book during the Englehart run being revealed to be a Doctor Doom bot and the real Doctor Doom, in a newly redesigned armor, returning to claim his country from his usurper. Simonson's [[retroactive continuity|retcon]] stated that Doctor Doom 's last real appearance was in the famous "Battle of Baxter Building" though with occasional trips back home, though Doctor Victor Von Doom   was shown to be unaware of certain major changes at the time to the Fantastic Four. An [[urban legend]] states that Simonson drew up a list of official stories which featured the real Doctor Doom  and those which did not<ref>{{cite web| author = Cronin, Brian | title = Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #100 | work = [[Comic Book Resources]] | date = 2007-04-26 | url = http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/04/26/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-100/ | accessdate=2008-02-14}}</ref> but this plotline was dropped and never mentioned again by later writers, who ignored Simonson's declaration as subterfuge Doctor Doom  stated for the sake of blaming past failures on Doombots.<ref>Fantastic Four #357</ref>

===Modern depictions===
In 2003 Doctor Doom  was the villain in the ''Fantastic Four'' story arc "''[[Unthinkable]]''", in which Doctor Victor Von Doom viscerally skins his childhood love Valeria alive to the bone, and turns her flesh into mystic armour, imprisons [[Franklin Richards]] in Hell, captures [[Valeria Richards]], and succeeds in de-powering and imprisoning the Fantastic Four. Writer Mark Waid sought to redefine Doctor Doom 's character in a way that had not been seen before. Waid punctuated this reinterpretation of Doctor Doom  during his "Unthinkable" saga (Vol 2 #66-70 & Vol 1 (restart) #500) as an absolute sadist by having Von Doom  ruthlessly murder Valeria (namesake of the Richards's daughter), his first love and granddaughter to his long serving faithful retainer Boris, in order to be granted access to powerful magic by a trio of demons, Valeria being the treasured possession that they demanded in exchange. He subsequently attempted to prove his superiority to Reed by giving him the chance to find his way out of a prison that could only be escaped by mastering magic, in the belief that Reed would fail to do so, but with the aid of the astral projection of Doctor Strange Reed learned to master magic by accepting that he could not understand it. This fight resulted in Doctor Doom  being trapped in Hell when Reed tricked him into rejecting the demons, until the events of Ragnarok, when Thor's hammer [[Mjolnir (Marvel Comics)|Mjolnir]] fell through dimensions and gave Doctor Doom  a way out of Hell when it was lost after Thor's apparent [[Comic book death|death]].

In 2005 and 2006, Doctor Doom  was featured in his own limited series, ''Books of Doom '', a retelling of the origin story by [[Ed Brubaker]].<ref name="books of doom interview">{{cite web|author=Brady, Matt|date=2005-10-27|url=http://www.newsarama.com/marvelnew/Nov_previews/BruDoctor Doom.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070416200903/http://www.newsarama.com/marvelnew/Nov_previews/BruDoctor Doom.htm|archivedate=2007-04-16|title=Brubaker on ''Books of Doctor Doom ''|work=[[Newsarama]]|accessdate=2008-02-14}}</ref> In an interview, Brubaker said the series was a way to elaborate on the earlier portions of Doctor Doom 's life which had not been seen often in the comics. The series also set out to determine if Doctor Doom 's path from troubled child to dictator was fated or Doctor Doom 's own faults led to his corruption — in essence, a [[nature versus nurture]] question.<ref>{{cite web|author=Tramountanas, George|date=2005-10-07|title=Brubaker of Deflowering Doctor Doom |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&old=1&id=6014|work=[[Comic Book Resources]]|accessdate=2008-02-13}}</ref> Brubaker's version of Doctor Doom  was heavily influenced by the original Lee/Kirby version; responding to a question if he would show Doctor Doom 's face, Brubaker stated "[F]ollowing Kirby's example, I think it's better not to show it."<ref name="books of doom interview"/>

The [[Mighty Avengers]] invaded Latveria, Doctor Doom 's nation, due to his involvement in creating a chemical bomb that would infect people with the [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] (though it was recently revealed that this attack was actually set up by [[Kristoff Vernard]] to put Doctor Doom  out of the picture prior to Kristoff's future attempt at a coup).<ref>''Spider-Man/Fantastic Four'' #4</ref> Due to [[Ultron]]'s interference, the bomb was dropped on [[Manhattan]], but the Mighty Avengers are able to stop the effects on the people. The Mighty Avengers proceed to invade Latveria. During the invasion, the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]], [[Iron Man]], and Doctor Doom  are sent to the past thanks to Doctor Doom ’s time platform. Eventually, the trio breaks into the Baxter Building and make use of a confiscated time machine to return to the present era, the Sentry taking advantage of the fact he will soon be forgotten by the world to easily defeat the Thing. Doctor Doom  transports himself to Morgana's castle to summon up a magical army and captures the Avengers, but they free themselves and he is arrested for terrorist crimes against humanity after a brief struggle that culminated with the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] tearing off Doctor Doom 's mask.

During [[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]] when Norman Osborn is in charge, Doctor Doom  is released and sent back to Latveria. However, Morgana le Fay engages him in a magical battle, which he is losing until the [[Dark Avengers]] rescue him. He then magically rebuilds his kingdom.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #1-4</ref>

The character is also featured in ''[[Siege (comics)|Siege]]'' storyline<ref name="Siege: The Cabal">Siege: The Cabal</ref> and in the five issue mini-series [[Doomwar]] written by [[Jonathan Maberry]].<ref name="Richards-12-09">{{cite web|last=Richards|first=Dave|title=MABERRY DECLARES "DOOMWAR"|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=23285|publisher=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=3 October 2010}}</ref>

Doctor Doom  soon allies himself with the isolationist group known as the Desturi, to take control of Wakanda.{{Issue|date=February 2011}} He attacked and wounded T'Challa, the current Black Panther, maiming him enough to prevent him from holding the mantle again.{{Issue|date=February 2011}} Doctor Doom 's main objective was to secure Wakanda's store of vibranium, which he could mystically enhance to make himself unstoppable.

In the Mark Millar penned ''Fantastic Four'' 566-569 Doctor Doom   received a significant power upgrade. He was thrown back in time (perhaps about 50 million years) by the Marquis of Death. Doctor Doom  then fought through time and space to get back to the present to seek revenge on the Marquis of Death. Doctor Doom  stated, as he killed the Marquis, he had rebuilt every molecule of his being and increased his power all to destroy the Marquis. In later issues this seems to have been ignored however, with writers treating Doctor Doom   the way they have always before in terms of power.

At the start of the story arc ''Fantastic Four: Three,'' Doctor Doom   felt that he needed to be "reborn" and was making plans to abdicate his throne and give it to Kristoff when Valeria teleported to his room unexpectedly asking for his assistance to help her father. Valeria quickly notices that Doctor Doom   has suffered brain damage and makes a deal with him to restore his mental capacities if he helps Reed and the Fantastic Four.

==Fictional character biography==
Victor von Doom was born decades ago to a tribe of [[Latveria]]n Romani people under the rule of an unnamed nobleman called the Baron. Victor's mother was [[witchcraft|witch]] [[Cynthia Von Doom]] who died by [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]'s hand while von Doom  was young. His father, Werner, was the leader of the tribe and a renowned medicine man who kept his wife's sorcerous life quiet in order to protect Victor from a similar fate. Soon after Cynthia's death, the Baron's wife grew incurably ill from cancer and Werner was called to the capital to heal her. When she succumbed to illness, the Baron labeled Werner a murderer and called for his death. Werner escaped with young Victor, having realized the night before the woman would die. He goes on to die of exposure on the mountainside, cradling the boy in a final embrace and giving him his garments to keep him warm. Victor survived and, on return to the gypsy camp, discovered his mother's occult instruments and swore revenge on the Baron. Victor grew into a headstrong and brilliant man, combining sorcery and technology to create fantastic devices to keep the Baron's men at bay and protect the gypsies. His exploits attracted the attention of the dean of [[Empire State University]], who sent someone to the camp.<ref name=origin/> Offered the chance to study in the United States, von Doom chooses to leave his homeland and his love, Valeria, behind.

Once in the United States, Victor met fellow student and future nemesis [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]], who was intended to be his roommate, but von Doom disliked him and asked for another roommate. After a time, Victor constructed a machine intended to communicate with the dead. Though Richards tried to warn him about a flaw in the machine, seeing his calculations were a few decimals off, Victor continued on with disastrous results. The machine violently failed and the resulting explosion seemingly severely damaged his face.<ref name=origin>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]] | Artist =[[Jack Kirby|Kirby, Jack]] | Story =''Origin of Doctor Doom'' | title = Fantastic Four Annual| Volume = | Issue =2 | date = 1964 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> It is later revealed that [[Thing (comics)|Ben Grimm]], a friend of Richards who despised Victor for his superior attitude, tampered with the machine. He would later blame himself for Doctor Doom 's eventual rise to power, but never revealed this information to anyone.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #5 AU</ref> Expelled after the accident, Victor traveled the world until he collapsed on a [[Tibet]]an mountainside. Rescued by a clan of monks, Victor quickly mastered the monks' disciplines as well as the monks themselves. Victor then forged himself a suit of armor, complete with a scowling mask, and took the name Doctor Doom.<ref name=origin/> As Doctor Doom, he would go on to menace those he felt responsible for his accident—primarily, Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four. He succeeded in taking over Latveria, taking an interest in the welfare of the Roma.

In his first appearance, Doctor Doom captures the [[Invisible Woman|Invisible Girl]], using her as a hostage so the Fantastic Four will travel back in time to steal the enchanted treasure of [[Blackbeard]] which will help him conquer the world, but he is fooled by Reed Richards, who swaps the treasure with worthless chains.<ref name="appearance">{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]] | Artist =[[Jack Kirby|Kirby, Jack]] | Story =Prisoners of Doctor Doom!| Title = Fantastic Four | Volume =  | Issue =5  | date = July 1962 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]| Page =  }}</ref> Doctor Doom then forms an alliance with the Sub-Mariner, who places a magnetic device in the Baxter Building. However Doctor Doom uses this to pull him and the Fantastic Four into space, thinking this will rid him of those capable of preventing him conquering the world. But the Sub-Mariner gets to Doctor Doom 's ship and returns the Baxter Building to New York, while Doctor Doom is left on an asteroid. Returning to Earth after learning the secrets of an advanced alien race, the Ovids, Doctor Doom exchanges consciousnesses with Mr. Fantastic; Richards, inhabiting Doctor Doom 's body, switches the two back, and Doctor Doom ends up trapped in a micro-world when he is hit with a shrinking ray he had intended to use on the rest of the Fantastic Four.<ref>[[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]] (w), [[Jack Kirby|Kirby, Jack]], "The Return of Doctor Doom " ''Fantastic Four'', #10, January 1963</ref> Doctor Doom takes over the micro-world, but leaves after the FF end his rule.

In the 2000s, Doctor Doom rediscovered his mystical heritage, using his powers in an attempt to destroy the Fantastic Four after making a deal with a group of demons called the Hazarath Three, but later is consigned to a hell dimension after Professor Richards manages to trick him into rejecting the idea that the demons aided him. He escapes and attempts to claim [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'s mystical hammer [[Mjolnir (Marvel Comics)|Mjolnir]] for himself, after the rift the hammer created as it fell to Earth following the destruction of Asgard allowed him to escape. The plot fails due to his inability to lift the hammer, and Doctor Doom returns to Latveria to rule once again.

When Franklin Richards was kidnapped by [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]], Doctor Doom joined the Fantastic Four, Avengers and the X-Men to battle Onslaught in Central Park. An enraged Hulk was able to crack open Onslaught's shell. However, Onslaught remained as pure psionic energy, separated Hulk and Banner, planning to spread across the planet. Thor plunged into Onslaught, trying to contain him. The Fantastic Four, the majority of Avengers, the Hulk-less Banner, and even Doom followed. Thanks to this sacrifice, the X-Men finally managed to destroy Onslaught. Doom, the Fantastic Four, and the Avengers and Banner were believed dead, but were instead saved by Franklin, who created a pocket dimension called Counter-Earth to keep them safe. After several months away, the missing heroes returned from [[Counter-Earth]], except for Doom, who remained there for a time. Doom uncovers the secret power at the heart of the planet, an avatar of his arch-foe Reed Richards' son, Franklin, the super-powered youth who conjured this globe and left a bit of himself behind to guide it from within. Doom manages to convince the little boy to relinquish control of this world with little more than a few errant promises of a better life.

Later, a Doombot was taken down by Reed Richards, [[Henry Pym]], [[Iron Man]], [[She-Hulk]] and others in New York City. Whether or not it was sent by Doctor Doom himself remains to be seen, as does his role in the overall conflict. Doctor Doom was not invited to the wedding of [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] and the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]. However, he did send a present: an invitation to form an alliance with Latveria, using the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] currently going on among the hero community as a reason to quite possibly forge an alliance between their two countries. When Black Panther, on a diplomatic mission to other countries with Storm, did show up in Latveria, he presented them with a real present, and extended another invitation to form an alliance with Black Panther. He demonstrated behavior very uncharacteristic of him, however, which may or may not become a plot point later. Panther spurned the invitation, detonating an EMP that blacked out a local portion of Latveria before Doctor Doom 's robots could destroy his ship. Later on, Doctor Doom is then shown collaborating with the Red Skull on a weapon which will only "be the beginning" of [[Captain America]]'s suffering. Doctor Doom gave the Red Skull the weapon because the Red Skull gave Victor pieces of technology from an old German castle. The castle was owned by a "Baron of Iron" centuries prior, who had used his technological genius to protect himself and his people. The map the Red Skull used to find the castle bore a picture of Doctor Doom. Doctor Doom states that the technology the Red Skull gave him is more advanced than what he currently has, and that he will become the Baron of Iron in his future. The Red Skull is currently in the process of reverse-engineering Doctor Doom 's weapon for multiple uses, rather than the single use Doctor Doom agreed to.

At the end of the first chapter of the X-Men event ''[[X-Men: Endangered Species|Endangered Species]]'', Doctor Doom is among the supervillain geniuses that [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] contacts to help him reverse the effects of [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]]. He spurns Beast by stating that genetics do not number among his talents.

In ''[[Spider-Man: One More Day]]'', Doctor Doom was among those that Spider-Man contacts to help save Aunt May.<ref>The Amazing Spider-Man #544</ref>

Doctor Doom also makes Latveria into a refugee camp for the [[Atlantis|Atlanteans]] following the destruction of their underwater kingdom<ref>Sub-Mariner vol. 2, #1-6 (Aug. 2007 - Jan. 2008)</ref> as well as becoming allies with [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] in his plot to manipulate [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] into unwittingly release his Asgardian enemies.<ref>Thor vol. 3, #5</ref>

Doctor Doom later defends Latveria from the [[The Mighty Avengers|Mighty Avengers]], following a revelation that it was one of Doctor Doom's satellites that carried the 'Venom Virus' released in New York City.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #8</ref> In a battle with Iron Man and the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]], the time travel mechanism within his armor overloads, trapping Doctor Doom and his opponents at some point in the past. Doctor Doom continues a relationship with [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fay]] using his time machine.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #9</ref> He and Iron Man managed to get back to the present, but Doctor Doom has left Iron Man in his exploding castle. Despite this, Doctor Doom ended up incarcerated at [[List of correctional facilities in comics#The Raft|The Raft]].

During the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline, Doctor Doom was among the villains who escaped the Raft when a virus was uploaded into its systems by the [[Skrull]]s.

In the aftermath of the Secret Invasion, Doctor Doom is a member of the Dark Illuminati alongside [[Norman Osborn]], [[Emma Frost]], Namor, Loki's female form, and [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]. At the end of this meeting, Namor and Doctor Doom are seen having a discussion of their own plans that have all ready been set in motion.<ref>Dark Reign #1</ref>

Doctor Doom soon allies himself with the isolationist group known as the Desturi, to take control of Wakanda. He attacked and wounded T'Challa, the current Black Panther, maiming him enough to prevent him from holding the mantle again. Doctor Doom 's main objective was to secure Wakanda's store of vibranium, which he could mystically enhance to make himself unstoppable. Doctor Doom was also a part of the supervillain group known as the [[Intelligencia]], but was betrayed when they captured him to complete their plan. With the help of [[Bruce Banner]], he escaped, and returned to Latveria. He appears to have been damaged by this experience.

At the start of the ''[[Siege (comics)|Siege]]'' storyline, Doctor Doom is with the Cabal discussing the current problems with the X-Men and both Avengers teams. Doctor Doom demands that Osborn at once reverse his course of action against his ally Namor, to which Osborn refuses, saying that he and Emma Frost had "crossed the line" with him. Doctor Doom, loathing Thor and the Asgardians all the more due to his recent defeat at their hands, claims that he will support Osborn's "madness" should Namor be returned to him, but Osborn refuses. Osborn's mysterious ally, the Void, violently attacks Doctor Doom, and an apparently amused Loki tells the Hood that he should go, as there is nothing here for either of them, which the Hood, now loyal to Loki due to his hand in the restoration of his mystical abilities, agrees. However, it is revealed that "Doctor Doom" is actually an upgraded Doctor Doom bot, which releases swarms of Doctor Doom bot nanites against the Cabal, tearing down Avengers Tower and forcing its denizens, such as the Dark Avengers, to evacuate. Osborn is rescued by the Sentry, who destroys the body. When Osborn contacts Doctor Doom, Doctor Doom tells him not to ever strike him again or he is willing to go further.<ref name="Siege: The Cabal"/>

It has been revealed that the Scarlet Witch seen in Wundagore Mountain is actually a Doctor Doom bot which apparently means that the real one has been captured by Doctor Doom sometime after the House of M event.<ref>''Avengers: The Children's Crusade'' #2</ref> It is revealed that Wanda's enhanced powers were a result of her and Doctor Doom's combined attempt to channel the Life Force in order to resurrect her children. This proves to be too much for Wanda to contain and it overtook her. With Wiccan and Doctor Doom's help, they seek to use the entity that is possessing Wanda to restore mutantkinds' powers. This is stopped by the Young Avengers (who are concerned at the fall-out that would ensue if the powerless mutants are suddenly re-powered) only to find out Doctor Doom 's real plan: to transfer the entity into his own body and gaining Wanda's god-like powers for himself.<ref>''Avengers: The Children's Crusade'' #7</ref> Doctor Doom  becomes omnipotent with powers surpassing those of beings as the [[Beyonder]] or the [[Cosmic Cube]]. The Young Avengers confront him, but Doctor Doom kills Cassie just before Wanda and Wiccan stole his new-found powers.<ref>''Avengers: The Children's Crusade'' #8</ref>

At the start of the story arc "Fantastic Four: Three," Doctor Doom felt that he needed to be "reborn" and was making plans to abdicate his throne and give it to Kristoff when Valeria teleported to his room unexpectedly asking for his assistance to help her father. Valeria quickly notices that Doctor Doom   has suffered brain damage and makes a deal with him to restore his mental capacities if he helps Reed and the Fantastic Four. Doctor Doom  agrees to her proposition.<ref name="Fantastic Four #583"/> Later, Doctor Doom appears among those in attendance at Johnny Storm's funeral.<ref name="Fantastic Four #588"/>

Due to the agreement, Doctor Doom was recommended by Nathaniel and Valeria Richards to be a member of the [[Future Foundation]].<ref name="FF #1"/> Objecting, Thing attacks Doctor Doom out of anger, but the fight was stopped by Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Woman, who welcomes Doctor Doom to their group. When Valeria asks Doctor Doom if he has a backup for restoring his memories, he reveals that [[Kristoff Vernard]] is his backup. Afterward, Mr. Fantastic, Spider-Man, Nathaniel, Valeria, and Doctor Doom head to [[Latveria]] to meet with Kristoff and request his help. Mister Fantastic sets up a brain transfer machine in order to help restore Doctor Doom's memories and knowledge, which is successful. When Kristoff wants to return the throne to him, Doctor Doom states that it is not time yet because of a promise he made to Valeria. When Mister Fantastic asks what promise Doctor Doom made to Valeria, Doctor Doom states that he made a promise to help defeat Mister Fantastic.<ref name="FF #2"/> Doctor Doom decides to hold a symposium on how to finally defeat Reed Richards. The Thing and the evolved Moloids give an invitation to the [[High Evolutionary]]. Dragon Man and Alex Power give an invitation to [[Diablo (Marvel Comics)|Diablo]]. Upon receiving an invitation from Spider-Man, [[Mad Thinker]] is convinced to take part in the event. Bentley 23 even gives an invitation to his creator, the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]], along with two [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] lieutenants. However, it is subsequently revealed that the 'Richards' they have been invited to defeat are actually members of the "Council of Reeds" (alternate versions of Reed who were trapped in this universe by Valeria a while back, possessing Reed's intellect while lacking his conscience).<ref>''FF'' #3</ref> While Spider-Man and [[Invisible Woman]] make sandwiches for the kids, [[Mister Fantastic]], Doctor Doom, Valeria, and Nathaniel Richards meet with the supervillain geniuses and [[Uatu]] the [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]] about what to do with the Council of Reeds.<ref>''FF'' #4</ref>

The child members of the Future Foundation used the panic room system to teleport themselves the top of the Baxter Building to near Latveria where they help Nathaniel Richards, Kristoff Vernard, Alpha-Reed Richards, and Doctor Doom to rebuild the Bridge, and the Alpha-Reed Richards could return home. The Mad [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]] from Earth-4280 try to enter Earth through the Bridge in order to destroy it. Doctor Doom and Alpha-Reed Richards tried to stop them although Alpha-Reed Richards was killed using the [[Ultimate Nullifier]] while Doctor Doom was apparently killed by the Mad Celestials.<ref>''FF'' #14</ref>

Doctor Doom managed to return to his Earth and Latveria. Unbeknownst to Doctor Doom, [[Lucia von Bardas]] and Red Ghost plan to use KGB super-spies (which had been previously in suspended animation) in a plot to kill Doctor Doom.<ref>''Winter Soldier'' #1</ref>

During the ''[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]'' storyline, Doctor Doom appears as a member of Magneto's unnamed supervillain group during the fight against [[Red Skull]]'s [[Onslaught (comics)|Red Onslaught]] form.<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #2</ref> Doctor Doom works with Scarlet Witch in order to use a spell to awaken the dormant part of Professor X's brain within Red Onslaught. The spell also caused some inversions which made the Avengers and X-Men evil and the bad guys good.<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #3</ref> In order to combat the now-evil Avengers and X-Men, Doctor Doom forms his team of Avengers by recruiting [[Delroy Garrett|3D Man]], [[Elsa Bloodstone]], [[Stingray (comics)|Stingray]], [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]], and [[U.S. Agent]]. Their first mission is to fight a now-evil Scarlet Witch when she invades Latveria.<ref>''Avengers World'' #15</ref> It is later revealed that he intends to use Scarlet's attack for his goal to atone for his sins, by absorbing during the fight her reality-altering powers with which he can undo all his crimes; being forced to choose only one act to set straight, as he obtains only a fraction of the power, and despite being tempted to use it to repair his face and resurrect his beloved mother, Doom elects to revive [[Cassie Lang]].<ref>''Avengers World'' #16</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
[[File:Doomcosmicpower.jpg|thumb|right|Doctor Doom steals the [[Silver Surfer]]'s powers in ''Fantastic Four'' #57 (1966). Art by Jack Kirby.]]
Doctor Doom is a [[polymath]] and scientific genius. Throughout most of his publication history, he has been depicted as one of the most intelligent humans in the [[Marvel Universe]]. This is shown on many occasions, most famously by actually curing Ben Grimm of his Thing form, which Reed Richards has never repeated.<ref>Fantastic Four (Vol. 1) #17</ref>  On the other hand, Reed Richards managed to process all the computer calculations necessary to save the life of a disintegrating [[Kitty Pryde]] by himself, which is a feat that Doctor Doom  at the time professed to be unable to do.<ref>''Fantastic Four Versus X-Men'', #1-4 (1987)</ref>

Doctor Doom also possesses originally minor mystical capabilities due to teachings from Tibetan monks, but later increased them to a considerable extent due to tutoring from his lover [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan Le Fay]]. He is capable of energy projection, creating protective shields, and summoning hordes of demonic creatures.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #9-11</ref> Even at a time his abilities were consistently referred to as minor, with assistance from his technology and by tag-teaming with Doctor Strange, Doctor Doom  managed to come second in a magic tournament held by the ancient sorcerer the Aged Genghis.<ref>Doctor Strange and Doctor Doom: Triumph and Torment</ref>

Doctor Doom has also used his scientific talents to steal or replicate the power of other beings such as the [[Silver Surfer]], or in one case the entity [[Galactus]]' world-ship.<ref>''Marvel Superheroes Secret Wars'' #1-12 (1985)</ref>

The alien [[List of alien races in Marvel Comics#O|Ovoids]] taught Doctor Doom the process of psionically transferring his consciousness into another nearby being through a simple eye contact, as well as showing him other forms of technology<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comiccollectorlive.com/LiveData/Issue.aspx?id=f1d9898a-de86-4635-a252-5459de32e56a |title=Fantastic Four 10 A, Jan 1963 Comic Book by Marvel |publisher=Comiccollectorlive.com |accessdate=2010-08-16}}</ref><ref>http://i388.photobucket.com/albums/oo326/OneDumbG0/Doctor Doom %20Stats/Doctor Doom Powers01-OvoidMindTransfer10.jpg</ref> which Doctor Doom  uses to escape from [[incarceration]]s and to avoid getting killed;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comiccollectorlive.com/LiveData/Issue.aspx?id=1aeb4290-639e-428b-bcf7-c2c282f190a7 |title=Fantastic Four 287 A, Feb 1986 Comic Book by Marvel |publisher=Comiccollectorlive.com |accessdate=2010-08-16}}</ref><ref>http://i388.photobucket.com/albums/oo326/OneDumbG0/Doctor Doom %20Stats/Doctor Doom Powers05-OvoidMindTransfer287.jpg</ref> however, if his concentration is broken, it can transfer his mind back, and he rarely uses this power unless absolutely necessary due to his own ego about his appearance.

Doctor Doom can exert technopathic control over certain machines, most notably the Doom bots. In addition, Doctor Doom has a remarkably strong will, as demonstrated in the [[graphic novel]], ''Emperor Doom '' when he dared his prisoner, the mind controlling [[Purple Man]], to attempt to control him and he successfully resists.

Without his armor he proved himself to be a skilled bare-handed fighter, even capable of killing a lion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.killermovies.com/forums/f98/t495216.html|title= Revamped Doctor Doom  Respect Thread/VIII. SKILL|publisher=Killer Movies Community Forums|accessdate=March 28, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=|title=Doctor Doom  #1|publisher=|accessdate=}}</ref>

Doctor Doom 's armor augments his natural physical strength to superhuman levels, to the point where he is able to hold his own against [[Spider-Man]] in hand-to-hand combat,<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #5">{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]] | Artist = [[Steve Ditko|Ditko, Steve]] | Story=''Marked For Destruction By Doctor Doom  '' | title = The Amazing Spider-Man | Volume = | Issue =5 | date = October 1963 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]| Page= }}</ref> although he tends to rely on long-range tactics when engaging physically stronger foes.

As the absolute monarch of Latveria, Dr. Doom has diplomatic immunity- allowing him to escape prosecution for most of his crimes- and total control of the nation's natural and technological resources, along with its manpower, economy, and military.

Doctor Doom is known for the frequent plot device wherein it is revealed that his actions were actually those of a "[[Doombot]]", one of Doctor Doom's many robot doubles, either working on his behalf or as a result of rogue [[artificial intelligence]].

On many occasions, Doctor Doom's only real weakness has been shown to be his arrogance, [[Layla Miller]] once reflecting that Doctor Doom is incapable of accepting that he himself might be the reason for his failures, as most keenly reflected in Doctor Doom's continued inability to accept that he himself was responsible for the accident that scarred his face, preferring to blame Reed Richards for sabotaging his experiment rather than accept that his calculations were wrong. While his high opinion of himself is generally accurate, he is notably generally unable to accept when others may have a better understanding of a situation than he does– although he has been noted to have enough respect for heroes such as Reed Richards or the Thing to at least listen to their recommendations about threats that he himself has not encountered rather than dismiss them instantly– and even when forced to team up with others to defeat a greater threat, Doctor Doom has been shown to be willing to try to gain a personal advantage when the more expedient course of action would be to stick to the plan and try for greater rewards later, such as when he tried to steal the Infinity Gauntlet from [[Thanos]] during the heroes' initial assault against the Titan rather than adhere to [[Adam Warlock]]'s plan of attack and simply attempt to acquire the Gauntlet after Thanos had been defeated.

Doctor Doom adheres to a strict code of honor at all times. However, Von Doom will keep his ''exact'' word, which may or may not be beneficial to the person to whom he has given his promise. For example, Doctor Doom  may swear that he will not harm an individual, but that only means he will not personally harm that person, it does not mean he will prevent others from harming that person.

Doctor Doom's honor code led him to save Captain America from drowning because Captain America had earlier saved his life, and on another occasion he thanked Spider-Man for saving him from terrorists attacking him in an airport by allowing him to leave alive despite Spider-Man subsequently insulting him. His code of honor also means that he will not attack a respected opponent who is weakened or at a severe disadvantage, as he regards any victory resulting from such circumstances as hollow and meaningless. He has even on several occasions battled opponents who were intent on killing the Fantastic Four, for no other reason than the fact that he does not want the ultimate defeat of the Fantastic Four to come from anyone's hands but his own.

Doctor Doom is shown to be devoted to the welfare and well being of his subjects.

==Inventions==
Doctor Doom  has constructed numerous devices in order to defeat his foes or gain more power including:

* '''[[Doombot]]s''' - Doombots have the face of the real Doctor Doom but with no hood and they have guns. Used for many missions, typically those where he fears defeat. Sometimes the Doctor Doom bots even believe themselves to be Doctor Doom.<ref name="FF#258"/>

* '''Servo-Guards''' - Robots that are programmed to attack the enemies of Doctor Doom.

* '''Time Platform''' - One of Doctor Doom's most ingenious creation is this functioning time machine. It consists of a platform 10 feet (3.0 m) by 10 feet (3.0 m) by 6 inches (150&nbsp;mm) and a separate control console. Subjects stand upon the platform, while an operator works the controls. The device can transport characters to virtually any time and place in Earth's timestream, and the operator can instantly return the travelers by manipulating the control console. Doctor Doom does not require the console to return to his own time—he can use the time-circuitry built into his own armor, allowing him to venture into time and return on his own without relying on someone to bring him back.

* A device to imbue people with superpowers.

Doctor Doom has been included in almost every media adaptation of the ''Fantastic Four'' franchise, including [[film]], television, and [[Video game|computer and video games]].

[[Comic Book Resources]] ranks Doctor Doom    as their fourth favorite Marvel character. Journalist Brent Ecenbarger cited him being able to "stand up against entities like [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], the [[Beyonder]], and [[Galactus]] and often come out on top", as well as the tragedy of any "other number of circumstances could have led to Doctor Doom being a savior, but as it is, instead he remains Marvel’s greatest villain." Fellow journalist Jason Stanhope called his "master[ing] of sorcery and technology an unusual combination", and also felt "his inner sense of nobility sets him apart from lesser villains, in a similar manner to [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]."<ref>{{cite web| author = Brian Cronin | title = Top 50 Marvel Characters #4 | work = [[Comic Book Resources]] | date = 2007-09-26 | url = http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/09/26/top-50-marvel-characters-4/ | accessdate=2008-02-14}}</ref> Doctor Doom  has also been favorably regarded by those who wrote for the character; Stan Lee declared Doctor Doom his favorite villain, saying that Doom "could come to the United States and he could do almost anything, and we could not arrest him because he has [[diplomatic immunity]].
