'''Doctor Doom''' (real name '''Victor von Doom''') is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain]]. Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], he first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four]] #5'' (July 1962).

A brilliant scientist, Doom was once a friend and colleague of the Fantastic Four's [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]]. However, he became embittered by his jealousy of Richards and scars he received on his face from an experiment gone awry (he has since donned an iron mask). 

Doom is considered the arch-enemy of the Fantastic Four, but has also been added to the rogue galleries of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], the [[Punisher]], the [[Silver Surfer]], the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], [[Iron Man]] and [[Spider-Man]]. He is one of the [[comic book]] industry's most recognizable and archetypal supervillains and many of his characteristics - his dominance over a small nation, his use of scientific and magical genius for evil and his eerie name - have often been copied and parodied. 

==Character history==
Victor was born to Werner von Doom, a noted [[Roma (people)|Roma]] healer, and Cynthia von Doom, who was said to be a witch. His mother was killed when Victor was an infant. She had attempted to gain power to protect her gypsy tribe from persecution by the reigning authorities of [[Latveria]]. Unfortunately, she bargained with the demon [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] for power (in the ''[[Earth X]]'' comic, it was stated that her bargain was that, in exchange for her soul, Mephisto would ensure that her son became notable, however ''Earth X'' is an alternate reality and therefore not canon); as is so often the case when dealing with demons, she was betrayed and killed. Later, Victor's father was hunted by the authorities for his failure to cure a Latverian baron's wife of terminal cancer. Werner von Doom died from exposure while fleeing, and the young Victor von Doom was placed in the care of the remaining gypsy tribe. Victor vowed to make the entire world pay for the loss of his parents.

While a child, he discovered his mother's magical artifacts and von Doom began his studies into the occult as well as developing his innate scientific abilities. His astounding reputation came to the attention of the dean of science at State University in America, and von Doom was offered a full scholarship. At State, von Doom first met both [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] and [[Thing (comics)|Ben Grimm]], two men who would go on to become his enemies in later years as Mister Fantastic and the Thing, respectively. Richards, in particular, represented a substantial threat to Doom's self-perceived superiority. Doom began conducting hazardous extra-dimensional experiments.
[[Image:Doctor-doom-mf.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Dr. Doom vs Mr. Fantastic. Art by Salvador Larroca.]] 
The focus of Doom's research was to construct a trans-dimensional projection device with which he could communicate with his dead mother. There was a flaw in the design which Richards pointed out to him, but Doom's pride prevented him from accepting Richards' advice and fixing the device before testing it. The machine worked perfectly for two minutes and 37 seconds, in which time Doom discovered that his mother was trapped in Mephisto's [[Hell]]. Then the device exploded, permanently marring his right cheek with a long, jagged scar, a scar that his incredible vanity magnified into a hideous disfigurement. Refusing to acknowledge his own fault in the matter, Doom blamed Richards for the accident, finding it easier to believe that Richards had sabotaged his work out of jealousy than admit to his own imperfection.

Doom was expelled from school afterward, and traveled the world searching for a cure for his scarred face. In some versions the scarring was not particularly severe, but Doom was overly sensitive about it as a symbol of his failure. Eventually Doom discovered a village of [[Tibet|Tibetan]] [[monk]]s amongst whom he lived for a number of years. They assisted him in crafting a suit of body armor that concealed his "deformity," and in some versions of the story (small-scar Doom), he seriously burned himself when he ordered the mask be put on while it was still red-hot. This suit would become his trademark, and thanks to his technological enhancements, it puts him on par in terms of personal power with most [[superhero|superheroes]] in the Marvel universe. After this, he returned to his homeland, overthrew the standing government, and crowned himself king. Ruling with an iron fist and an equally strong will, Doom began to redirect the small nation's resources to help him realize his goals.
[[Image:Ff247.png|Cover to ''Fantastic Four'' #247. Art by John Byrne.|210px|thumb]]
Doom was briefly deposed by Zorba, a prince from the royal family Doom had previously overthrown. Doom soon killed Zorba and reclaimed his throne, but in the process one of his loyal Latverian subjects was killed before his eyes. Doom adopted the fallen woman's son, Kristoff Vernard, and raised the boy as his heir. In addition, as Doom considers his genius and leadership to be priceless assets to the Earth, he used Kristoff as a fallback plan to be used in the unlikely event of his premature death. When Doom was indeed seemingly killed, his robots enacted this plan and copied Doom's knowledge and memories into young Kristoff's brain. For a time, Kristoff even believed himself to be Doom, but eventually realized the truth and submitted to the true Doom's rule. Ironically, Kristoff seems to be the half-brother of Doom's hated rival [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]], though none of the three seem to be aware of this fact.

Although Von Doom has significant scientific knowledge and ability, he lacks an advanced university degree. Von Doom apparently likes the sound of "Doctor Doom"; as the absolute ruler of a country, he simply started calling himself that. It has been suggested that Doom granted himself an honorary doctorate from a Latverian university, though he has never formally obtained a doctorate and considers it a mere technicality.

In 2003, Doom realized he was unnecessarily limiting himself by focusing on technology, and only occasionally his magical birthright. He sold his childhood sweetheart's soul to a trio of demons in exchange for unlimited magical ability and new leather armour made of her skin. As a direct result of this storyline, Doom was confined to Hell, but later recovered by Reed, who intended to trap him in a small [[Moebius strip]] dimension forever. To effect his escape, Doom's consciousness [[demonic possession|possessed]] [[Thing (comics)|Ben Grimm]], forcing Richards to kill them both. Ben Grimm was later brought back from the dead, but Doom's whereabouts are unknown - the [[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]] has claimed that Doom remains trapped in the Moebius dimension, but that does not seem accurate, as only his body would reside there, his consciousness having either died along with the Thing's body, or left disembodied; for it to be able to transcend dimensions return to Doom's body unaided seems unlikely.

==Goals==
[[Image:doomlee.jpg|225px|Cover to ''Heroes Reborn: Fantastic Four'' #5. Art by Jim Lee.|thumb]]
Doctor Doom is driven by three principal objectives: the destruction of Reed Richards, world domination, and the liberation of his mother's soul from the [[demon]] [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]'s realm. He has so far achieved two of these aims. With the help of [[Doctor Strange]], Master of the Mystic Arts and Earth's Sorcerer Supreme, he wrested his mother's spirit from Mephisto's grasp; a vital step in this process turned out to be tricking his mother into renouncing her love for Victor, and though it was difficult for him he was able to make that necessary sacrifice.

He has also achieved world domination several times, but has relinquished it for a variety of reasons, including boredom. In the graphic novel Emperor Doom, he achieved control of the world by using and amplifying the mind control power of the [[Purple Man]]. And when the world's mightiest heroes returned from the alternate [[Earth]] to which they had been shunted following their confrontation with the sentient psionic being [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]], Doctor Doom remained behind and conquered that planet, which he dubbed "Planet Doom." On both occasions he was by most accounts a very good ruler, leading this world into a period of unparalleled prosperity. And on both occasions he eventually abdicated as ruler, finding the task of world domination to be tedious once it had finally been achieved. In a short-lived series of comics set in the year [[Marvel 2099|2099]], Doctor Doom was transported to that time from some point in our current near future and upon seeing the decrepit state of Latveria he becomes the [[President of the United States]] in order to curb the power of the megacorporations based there that were oppressing his people. As a side effect he begins improving the quality of life in the United States as well, re-instituting democracy and an effective non-corrupt police force.

Despite repeated attempts through the years, Doom has been unable to completely defeat [[Mister Fantastic]], although several of their encounters have resulted in temporary victories for Doom. In hand-to-hand battle, he has also been physically humiliated by the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] and Doom has vowed to take revenge on both men. He has come close on several occasions; however, he has failed to permanently defeat either of them. 

Doctor Doom's plans are fueled by his ego and his conviction that he is not only capable of world domination, but also worthy and deserving of it. While he is utterly heartless and places little value on the lives of others, he also follows a strict code of honor. Several times he has struck bargains with various characters in the Marvel Universe, and he has always upheld those bargains, honoring his word and following through with his promises to the letter. He is a cruel and ruthless dictator; yet while he rules his nation of Latveria with an iron fist and is willing to deliver swift and cruel punishments, he also treats his subjects fairly (as long as they acknowledge his absolute rule) and at times has even put himself at risk to protect his kingdom and subjects. This complexity has made him one of the more interesting characters in the Marvel Universe.

==Adversaries==
Although he is primarily a [[Fantastic Four]] villain, Doctor Doom appears all over the Marvel Universe, casually stomping on anyone who gets in his way. He has faced the Avengers and the [[X-Men]] on numerous occasions. He is not above using them to get what he wants either. Only recently, Doom used the Avengers to add more territory to Latveria. 

Individual heroes such as [[Spider-Man]], [[Iron Man]], [[Dazzler]] and [[Squirrel Girl]] have become embroiled in his schemes (the latter handed him one of the most inglorious defeats of his career). In the past, he has managed to usurp the omnipotent power of the [[Silver Surfer]], [[Galactus]] and the [[Beyonder]].

Doom has occasionally helped the super-heroes as well. Seeing how he cannot abide by anyone else ruling Earth but him, Doom assisted Earth's super-heroes in the fight against [[Onslaught]] and [[Thanos]]. He would do anything to maintain his despotic rule over the kingdom of Latveria.

It could be reasoned that Doom is foremost of several villains who acts as an enemy for every Marvel hero, much like [[Darkseid]] in the [[DC Universe]]. Other examples include the [[Wizard]]'s [[Frightful Four]].

==Powers and abilities==
Doom's most dangerous weapon is his genius-level [[intelligence (trait)|intellect]]. He is easily one of the smartest men in the Marvel Universe, consistently beaten by Reed Richards largely due to his own arrogance and egocentrism. Doom has constructed hundreds of devices, including a working [[time machine]] (the first of its kind on Earth), devices which can imbue people with superpowers, and many types of [[robot|robots]]. His most frequently-used robots are his "Doombots," exact mechanical replicas of the real Doctor Doom. They look like him, talk like him, and even act like him. Individually, Doombots have an advanced [[artificial intelligence|A.I. program]] that causes them to believe themselves really to be Doctor Doom. In order to prevent his duplicates from harming or out-performing him, Doctor Doom installs each Doombot with a dampener program that reduces all of its abilities when activated. This program is triggered whenever a Doombot enters Von Doom's presence or the presence of other Doombots. These imitation Dooms have been created to impersonate Doctor Doom when he either cannot be present or is unwilling to risk his own life (such as when confronting powerful foes). They are also, in a way, a [[plot device]]: often, if Doom is apparently defeated, acts out of character in a story, or even seems to die, "it was only a robot". Another common sight around Latveria are the purple-and-grey Warrior Robots, who resemble hulking humans in metallic armor and enforce Doom's laws.

Doom also possesses a good deal of [[sorcery|sorcerous]] ability which he learned from his time with a Secret order of Monks in Tibet, able to fire blasts of mystical energy from his hands, create protective shields of magical energy, ensnare foes in bands of energy (the ''Crimson Bands of [[Cyttorak]]''), and create portals to other [[plane (cosmology)|planes of existence]], such as [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto's]] [[hell|hellish]] realm or the [[Dreamtime (mythology)|Dreamtime]] of the [[Australian Aborigine|Australian Aborigines]]. Doom has also developed the ability to transfer psionically his consciousness into another nearby human being with whom he's made [[eye]] contact, a process which he learned from the [[extraterrestrial life|alien]] Ovoids. However, Doom prefers his own body and only uses this transference power as a last resort.

[[Image:Armor doom.jpg|Doom's armor.|thumb|left]]

Dr. Doom's [[iron]]-clad [[face]] is instantly recognizable to most of the world's population, a fact attributable to his infamous, high-tech, [[nuclear power|nuclear powered]], [[computer]] assisted [[power armor|battle suit]]. Doom's first (and truly "original") set of [[armor]] was magically forged at a hidden monastery in the high mountains of [[Tibet]]; since then, his dark plated armor has been enhanced and repaired by normal technological means. Although a skilled practitioner of the mystic arts, Victor von Doom more often relies upon his armor for most of his powers. The armor is fashioned of a high-strength [[titanium]] [[alloy]]. Built into the right wrist is a video communicator, which he can use to stay in contact with all his bases from any point on Earth. To deal with those insignificant fools who would dare to touch Doom, the armor is built to generate a massive [[electric shock]] on command. The armor is equipped with twin jetpacks mounted at the waist which permit [[flight]], though some suits contain a back-mounted single jetpack. Concussive bolts of force can be fired from the gauntlets and faceplate of the armor, though the mask only generates force blasts when it is not being worn. The suit's best defense is the [[force field]] generated by the armor, which has a maximum radius of eight feet (and so can encompass others); Doom cannot attack without lowering his force field. [[Infrared]] scanners in the helmet allow the wearer to detect [[heat]] sources, permitting night vision and the ability to see [[invisibility|invisible]] persons (unless they do not give off or can somehow mask their heat signature). The armor is self-supporting, equipped with internal stores & [[recycling]] systems for [[air]], [[food]], [[water]], and [[energy]], allowing the wearer to survive lengthy periods of exposure [[underwater]] or in [[outer space]]. Optical scanners in the helmet allow the helmet's eyepieces to be used as high-powered [[telescope|telescopes]], and parabolic ear amplifiers fitted inside the helmet allow Doom to detect extremely faint [[sound|sounds]] and unusual frequencies within the audible range for humans. A thermo-energizer allows the armor to absorb and store [[solar Power|solar]] and heat energy, and use it to power the armor's other systems; this system can only be used while the force field is deactivated. In addition, Doom often carries a pistol (a [[C96|"Broomhandle Mauser"]], at least in older stories) to dispose of weaker enemies whom he considers unworthy to kill with his armor's weaponry.

Being the leader of a sovereign nation, Doctor Doom enjoys the grace of [[diplomatic immunity]] while in America during the few times he is there for non-pernicious, political actions and diplomacy. He has even been accompanied and escorted by [[Captain America]] himself.

===Character history===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, Doctor Doom is '''Victor Van Damme''', a direct descendant of [[Vlad III Dracula|Vlad Tepes Dracula]], and was part of the Baxter Building, a government think-tank of young geniuses, such as Reed Richards and Susan Storm. He worked to help Reed Richards develop a teleporter to the "N-Zone," but reprogrammed its coordinates without telling anyone. This caused the accident that gave the [[Ultimate Fantastic Four]] their powers. Van Damme was caught in the same accident, and his skin was changed into a [[metal|metallic]] hide (with a somewhat reduced ability to perceive tactile sensations and [[pain]]), clawed hands, his legs transmogrified into demonic [[goat]]-hooved legs, and he re-appeared on Earth at an undisclosed location in [[Europe]]. He is now leading a small [[micronation]] called "Free State", "Freezone", or "The Keep", a [[Permanent Autonomous Zone]] located in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]], where citizens live without rent in a [[shanty town]] under [[squatter's rights]], and are given free comforts and necessities in exchange for loyalty to Van Damme. There, a [[tattoo]] is given to new settlers, which is made up of microfibres that mate with the brain stem so Van Damme can control them. However, the Fantastic Four eventually freed them from Doom's control during their first battle, and all subsequently left. 

===Powers and abilities===
Whereas the Fantastic Four attained the powers of the four [[classical elements]] - earth, fire, air and water - the Ultimate version of Doctor Doom has gained the power of the Chinese fifth element, metal. Additionally, Doom could expel the remains of his internal organs as a [[poison|poisonous]] gas and could grow and fling [[porcupine]]-like volleys of quills from his forearms. He also possesses a regenerative power, but he cannot heal any wound caused by his own body. Therefore, the scar Reed made on Van Damme's face remains, because it was done with one of his own quills.

===Critical reaction===
Although ''[[Ultimate Fantastic Four]]'' has generally proved to be a critically successful title, [[Warren Ellis]]' reinvention of Doom was predominantly met with disapproval by fans. The reinvention of this character was generally held to be so radical as to bear little relation to the original and thus failing to be a satisfying example of [[Ultimate Marvel]]'s "remixing" premise. Particular points of dissatisfaction are that, by tying his origin directly into that of the Fantastic Four's, crucial elements of the classic FF mythos have been fundamentally altered for this new version. By making Victor and ''his'' hubris instead of Reed's be responsible for the accident that (in this version) brings about all their powers, Ellis has fundamentally altered major character dynamics that most fans deem essential to any version of these characters. With Victor now responsible for their accident, the crux of the classic relationship between [[Ben Grimm]] and Reed (whereby Ben blames Reed for his monstrous new form and Reed naturally feels guilty) is voided.

Furthermore, although the Ultimate Victor is essentially just as responsible for his own disfigurement as was the original Doom, the fact that in this version Victor is mutated through his tampering with a project of Reed's rather than by simply ignoring Reed's cautions about his own independent experiment makes Victor's subsequent blaming of Richards considerably more unreasonable. The classic Doom's total refusal to ever accept blame even when something is clearly his own fault is generally considered to be a cornerstone of the character. By making Ultimate Reed and Doom's fates so closely intertwined largely negates the essential character element whereby the original Doom so irrationally blames Reed for supposedly sabotaging his own experiment and thus causing its catastrophic failure and his subsequent facial injuries. Furthermore, the classic Doom's unrepentant egomania is given a far more psychotic twist in his Ultimate persona, this new, younger version depicted as much more clearly insane than the more sociopathic original.

One of the more obvious elements which perturbed fans was the reinvention of his (thus far) rather pathetic "kingdom". A significant aspect of the original Doom's appeal sprang from the grandeur of his literally royal status (albeit self-declared), whereas the re-imagined concept of his ruling a Copenhagen commune seemed to many fans as unworthy of such a traditionally major villain.

More superficial points of contention include his having post-human powers as opposed to relying only on his armor and genius (this mutated notion was repeated in the ''Fantastic Four'' film), the unintentionally comical appearance of his goat-like mutated legs, and especially his new surname "Van Damme", widely considered to be absurd, given the automatic (but presumably unintentional) pop-cultural association it conjures of washed-up action star [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]]. Recent 2005 issues of [[Toyfare]] magazine have ridiculed Ultimate Doom, in one instance asking what kind of hard drugs Warren Ellis was "smoking" when he recreated the villain.

==Appearances in other media==
[[Image:Drdoom.gif|Dr. Doom in Marvel vs. Capcom 2|thumb|left]]
{{wikibooks|Fighting Game Moves/Capcom/Dr_Doom}}

Doctor Doom has appeared in several [[video game]]s. He was the final [[boss (video games)|boss]] in the 1989 [[computer game]] "[[Spider-Man and Captain America in Doctor Doom's Revenge]]" and in [[Sega]]'s 1991 [[Spider-Man (arcade game)|Spider-Man]] [[arcade game]]. Later, he was featured as a boss character in the [[Capcom]] [[fighting game]], "[[Marvel Super-Heroes (video game)|Marvel Super-Heroes]]," who only became playable after the game was beaten once and a code was entered. He returned as a selectable character in "[[Marvel vs. Capcom series|Marvel vs. Capcom 2]]". He is particularly notorious for the so-called "[[Strider (arcade game)|Strider]]/Doom trap" in the latter game. He also appeared in Marvel Superheroes: War of the Gems for Super NES, and the various games based upon the 2005 Fantastic 4 movie.

Dr. Doom has also appeared in several cartoons, including "The Fantastic Four" (1967-1970), "The New Fantastic Four" (1978-1979), "Spider-Man" (1981-1982) and "[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]" (1981-1983). In "The Fantastic Four" (1994-1996), he was voiced by [[Neil Ross]] in season one, retelling his classic origin and his theft of the Silver Surfer's power, and by [[Simon Templeman]] in season two, as he struck at a powerless FF, had his hand crushed by the Thing, directed the Hulk to attack the team and once again acquired the Power Cosmic. Templeman reprised his role for guest appearances in two episodes of "The Incredible Hulk" (1996-1997), in which Doom held Washington DC captive, only to be defeated by She-Hulk, whom he later attempted to claim revenge upon. [[Tom Kane]] took over the character for a three-part guest spot in the final season of "Spider-Man" (1994-1998), re-imagining Doom's role in the [[Secret Wars]].

Dr. Doom was parodied in the animated TV series "[[The Venture Bros.]]" in the form of the menacing [[Baron Underbheit]]. Like Doom, Underbheit rules a small fictitious European country known as Unterland, and has a rivalry with one of the protagonists ([[Dr. Venture]] to be precise). Whereas Doom blames Reed Richards for scarring his face, Underbheit blames Venture for violating a so-called sacred pact of lab partners, resulting in the loss of his lower jaw. It should be noted that another villain of the series, [[The Monarch]], considers him a "Dime-store Dr. Doom".

A [[Fantastic Four (1994 film)|film based on the Fantastic Four]] was produced by [[Roger Corman]] in 1994, though never publicly released. In it, Doom (portrayed by [[Joseph Culp]]) was a college classmate of Reed Richards, who was nearly killed in an accident and brought back to life by loyal henchmen as a [[cyborg]]. 
[[Image:Doommovie.jpg|[[Julian McMahon]] as Dr.Doom in the 2005 movie 

===2005 film===
''[[Fantastic Four (2005 film)|Fantastic Four]].|245px|thumb]]
A [[Fantastic Four (2005 film)|new film version]] of Fantastic Four was released in July 2005, in which Doom is a billionaire industrialist and old college rival of Reed Richards. In addition to funding Richards' trip to space, he also accompanies the future Fantastic Four on the ship. In this newer film, Doctor Doom is played by [[Julian McMahon]] (''[[Charmed]]'', ''[[Nip/Tuck]]''), and, similar to Ultimate Doom, receives superpowers in the same accident that creates the Fantastic Four.

Here, he is endowed with two abilities by the cosmic rays - exposure to the rays imbues him with [[Electrokinesis]], and an injury caused by a piece of irradiated shrapnel from the shields intended to protect the station steadily begins to mutate his body into an organic-metallic compound. Doom accelerates the process to completion by exposing himself to a duplicated version of the cosmic rays, and, angered by the facial deformities the process induces, dons his familiar mask to hide his face. In another parallel with their Ultimate incarnations, the FF receive abilities based on the four classic elements, while Doom again gains the Chinese "fifth element" of metal as his power.

Similar to the Ultimate Doom, the film version of Doom was almost universally panned by comic fans. Whilst many debated the relative merits of the critically-unsuccessful film and its character depictions, general consensus holds that the script and McMahon's performance delivered an abysmal portrayal of the character, if not necessarily in the Victor persona, but unequivocally so as the fully-costumed Doom. Although similar arguments as those leveled against Ultimate Doom found fault with his radically altered origin, abilities and lack of monarchical status, most criticisms simply claimed that the portrayal was wholly uninspiring and not befitting such a seminal villain. Although the mask (and, for some, the rest of the costume) was generally considered to be acceptable, McMahon's physical and especially vocal performance delivered none of the grandeur and gravitas that made the classic character so enduringly popular. It is generally considered that for a fully-masked villain to be effective on film a complementarily imposing voice talent is required, as was successfully the case with [[James Earl Jones]] voicing the fearsome [[Darth Vader]] in ''[[Star Wars]]''. 

===Daniel Dumile as MF Doom===
[[Rapper]] [[Daniel Dumile]] has launched a career under the Dr. Doom-esque pseudonyms [[MF Doom]] and more recently, [[Viktor Vaughn]]. The covers of MF Doom albums portray a dark-skinned character with Dr. Doom's mask and green hood. In the 2004 release, ''[[MM..Food?]]'', Dumile used samples from old Fantastic Four read-along records, as well as featuring a fellow rapper named Mister Fantastik on the song 'Rapp Snitch Knishes'. Additionally, Dumile's album under the name Viktor Vaughn, [[Vaudeville Villain]], is ripe with samples from various [[Fantastic Four]] records. [[MF Doom]] has even performed live in a metal mask extremely similar to that of the comic book villain.

===Influences on other characters===
Some fans suspect that he was an inspiration for the ''[[Star Wars]]'' villain, [[Darth Vader]]. [[Mark Hamill]] noted that when he saw the preliminary designs for that character, he temporarily confused him for the Marvel supervillian. George Lucas has on rare occasions admitted the influnece, although not in recent years, as cited in the book ''The Science of Supervillains''.

In [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[Dark Tower]]'' series of books, robots wearing green hoods and iron wolf masks are apparently Doombots, according to [[Eddie Dean]], one of the main characters. They, however, carry [[lightsabers]] (probably a reference to the Doom/Vader comparison), along with other assorted weapons, and ride mechanical horses.

In [[Neil Gaiman|Neil Gaiman's]] alternate-universe tale, [[1602 (comic)|1602]], Dr. Doom is named "Count Otto von Doom", and is known as "Otto the Handsome".

In a ''[[Duck Dodgers]]'' episode titled Enemy Yours, Dodgers appears as Dr. Destructocon with the exact costume, minus the iron mask.

''[[South Park]]'' features a Doctor Doom parody named [[Professor Chaos]]. He wears a similar costume and also has similarly high ambitions, but he is limited by scale.

KRO and the House Band of the Apocalypse recorded a tune called "Doom (I'm the Doc)", an obvious reference. The song features a sample "Murdered by Doctor Doom" from the Fantastic Four comic as well as lyrics that relate to the villain.

The [[MMORPG]] [[City of Heroes]] features an [[Supervillain]] named Nemesis who is in many ways a homage to Doctor Doom. He is never seen outside of his steam-powered suit of Brass armor and even has duplicates of his armor that are autonomous and appear often in the game as Fake Nemesis. The player can fight the supposedly 'real' Nemesis three times in the game but never knows if he finally got the real one as Nemesis has a knack for faking his own death.
