'''Victor von Doom''' (also known as '''Doctor Doom''') is a [[fictional character]] who appears in [[Marvel Comics]] [[publications]] . Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], the character first appeared in ''Fantastic Four'' #5 (July 1962) wearing his trademark metal mask and green cloak. The son of a gypsy witch, Doom is a recurring [[supervillain]], [[archenemy|arch enemy]] of the [[Fantastic Four]], and leader of the fictional nation of [[Latveria]]. He is both a genius inventor and a sorcerer, and has served as a primary antagonist and occasional protagonist in the Marvel continuity since his creation. While Doom's chief opponents have been the Fantastic Four, he has also frequently battled [[Spider-Man]], [[Doctor Strange]], the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], the [[X-Men]], the [[Punisher]], [[Blade (comics)|Blade]], [[Iron Man]], and the [[Silver Surfer]], among others.

Doctor Doom has been featured in other Marvel-endorsed media such as [[feature films]]; [[video games]]; [[television series]] and merchandise such as [[action figures]] and [[trading cards]].  Doom was ranked as the 4th greatest villain by [[Wizard (magazine)|''Wizard'']] on its "100 Greatest Villains of All Time" list.<ref>McCallum, Pat (July 2006). "100 Greatest Villains Ever". ''[[Wizard magazine|Wizard]]'' (177)</ref> [[IGN]]'s list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time ranked Doom as #3.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/3.html |title=Doctor Doom is Number 3 |publisher=Comics.ign.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-17}}</ref>

==Publication history==
===Creation and development===
Like many of Marvel's [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] characters, Doctor Doom was conceived by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]]. With the ''Fantastic Four'' title performing well, Lee and Kirby were trying to dream up a "soul-stirring…super sensational new villain."<ref name="bad guys 12">{{Cite book|title=Bring On the Bad Guys! |last= Lee|first=Stan |authorlink=Stan Lee |year=1976 |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |location= New York|isbn= |page= 12}}</ref> Looking for a name, Lee latched onto "Doctor Doom" as "eloquent in its simplicity — magnificent in its implied menace."<ref name="bad guys 12"/>

[[Image:DrDoomkirbyff2.jpg|thumb|left|''Fantastic Four'' #5 (July 1962), Doctor Doom's first appearance.]]

Due to the rush to publish, the character was not given a full [[origin story]]<ref name="bad guys 12"/> until  ''Fantastic Four Annual'' #2, two years after his debut.<ref name="bad guys 13">{{Cite book|title=Bring On the Bad Guys! |last= Lee|first=Stan |authorlink=Stan Lee |year=1976 |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |location= New York|isbn= |page= 13}}</ref> 

Jack Kirby modeled Doom after [[Death (personification)|Death]], with the armor standing in for that character's skeleton; "It was the reason for the armor and the hood. Death is connected with armor and the inhuman-like steel. Death is something without mercy, and human flesh contains that mercy."<ref name=death>{{Cite book|title=The Silver Age of Comic Book Art | last = Schumer | first = Arlen |year=2003 |publisher=Collectors Press |isbn=1-888054-85-9 |page= 76}}</ref> Kirby further described Doom as being "paranoid", wrecked by his twisted face and wanting the whole world to be like him.<ref name=death/> Kirby went on to say that "Doom is an evil person, but he's not always been evil. He was [respected]…but through a flaw in his own character, he was a perfectionist."<ref name="kirby collected">{{Cite book|title=The Collected Jack Kirby Collector |last=Morrow |first=John |authorlink= |coauthors= Kirby, Jack|year=2006 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |location= |isbn=1-893905-57-8 |page= 101}}</ref> At one point in the Seventies, Kirby drew his interpretation of what Doom would look like under the mask, giving Doom only "a tiny scar on his cheek."<ref name="silver kirby">{{Cite book|title=The Silver Age of Comic Book Art | last = Schumer | first = Arlen |year=2003 |publisher=Collectors Press |isbn=1-888054-85-9 |page= 77}}</ref> Due to this slight imperfection, Doom hides his face not from the world, but from himself.<ref name="silver kirby"/> To Kirby, this is the motivation for Doom's vengeance against the world; because others are superior due to this slight scar, Doom wants to elevate himself above them.<ref name="kirby collected"/> Typical of Lee's writing characterization of Doom is his arrogance; his pride leads to Doom's disfigurement at the hands of his own machine, and to the failures of many of his schemes.<ref name="Marvel Encyclopedia">{{Cite book|title=Marvel Encyclopedia Vol. 6: Fantastic Four | last = Christiansen | first = Jeff |year=2004 |publisher=Marvel Entertainment Group|location=New York |isbn= |pages= 63–66}}</ref>- There is also an idea that Doom placed his mask on his face before it was fully cool, burning his face. In some early stories glimpses of his face is shown, in which he seems to be bald.

While the Fantastic Four had fought various villains such as the [[Mole Man]], [[Skrull]]s, the [[Miracle Man]], and [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]], Doctor Doom managed to overshadow them all and became the Fantastic Four's [[archnemesis]].<ref name="greatest villains of the FF"/>

During the 1970s, Doom branched out to more Marvel titles such as ''[[Astonishing Tales]]'',<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Roy Thomas|Thomas, Roy]] | Artist =[[Wally Wood|Wood, Wally]] | Story =''Revolution!'' | title = Astonishing Tales | Volume = | Issue =2-6 | Date =October 1970-June 1971 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]| Page = }}</ref> ''[[Hulk (comics)|The Incredible Hulk]]'',<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Roy Thomas|Thomas, Roy]] | Artist =[[Dick Ayers|Ayers, Dick]] | Story =''Sanctuary!'' | Title =Incredible Hulk| Volume = | Issue =143 | Date =September 1971 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> and ''[[Super-Villain Team-Up]]'', starting in 1975, as well as appearances in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'', beginning with issue #42 (February 1976). Doom's origin was also a feature in ''Astonishing Tales'' when his ties to the villain [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] were revealed.<ref>{{Cite comic | writer = [[Gerry Conway|Conway, Gerry]] | artist =[[Gene Colan|Colan, Gene]] | title = [[Astonishing Tales]] | volume = 1 | issue = 8 | year = 1971 | publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

===1980s-1990s===
1981 saw Marvel and [[DC Comics]] collaborate on another project.  In 1976 the two companies had published ''[[Superman vs. the Amazing Spider-Man]]'', and seeking to replicate that success the two companies again teamed the characters up, in ''[[Superman and Spider-Man]]''.  Marvel [[editor in chief]] [[Jim Shooter]] co-wrote the story alongside [[Marv Wolfman]], and recalled choosing Doom based on his iconic status: "I figured I needed the heaviest-duty bad guy we had to offer — Doctor Doom. Their greatest hero against our greatest villain."<ref>{{Cite book|last=Eury|first=Michael|title=The Krypton Companion|publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing|year=2006|page=77|isbn=1893905616}}</ref>

The same year saw [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] begin his six-year run writing and illustrating ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' in 1981, sparking a "second golden age" for the title<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Slings & Arrows Comic Guide | last = Plowright | first = Frank |year=1997 |publisher=Aurum Press |isbn= |pages= }}</ref> but also attempting to "''turn the clock back [...] get back and see fresh what it was that made the book great at its inception.''"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Current Biography Yearbook | last = Mari | first = Christopher |year=2000 |publisher=H.W. Wilson, Co |isbn= |page= 81}}</ref> Doom made his first appearance under Byrne's tenure with issue #236.<ref>{{Cite comic | Cartoonist = [[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]]| Story =''Terror in a Tiny Town'' | title = Fantastic Four | Volume = | Issue =236 | Date = November 1981 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | Page = }}</ref> Whereas Kirby had intimated that Doom's disfigurement was more a figment of Victor's vain personality, Byrne expressed that Doom's face was truly ravaged; only Doom's own robot slaves are allowed to see the monarch without his helmet.<ref name="FF#258"/> Byrne also emphasized other aspects of Doom's personality; despite his ruthless nature, Doom is a man of his word.<ref name=religion>{{cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/lit/comics/DoctorDoom.html |title=The Religious Affiliation of Comic Book Character Victor Von Doom|date=2005-12-10|accessdate=2008-02-12|work=Adherents.com|author=Staff}}</ref> However, some stories reveal he actually does not care about his devoted people of Latveria<ref>http://i388.photobucket.com/albums/oo326/OneDumbG0/DoomEvil03381.jpg</ref> (though they think he does) or his henchmen;<ref>http://i388.photobucket.com/albums/oo326/OneDumbG0/Doom%20Fights/DoomPowerCosmic0157.jpg</ref> returning to Latveria after being temporarily deposed, Doom abandons a scheme to wrest mystical secrets from [[Doctor Strange]] in order to oversee his land's reconstruction.<ref name="FF#258">{{Cite comic | Cartoonist = [[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]]| Story =''Interlude'' | title = Fantastic Four | Volume = | Issue =258 | Date = September 1983 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | Page = }}</ref> Though possessing a tempestuous temper, Doom also occasionally shows warmth and empathy to others; he tries to free his mother from [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] and treats [[Kristoff Vernard]] like his own son.<ref name="FF#258"/> Byrne also gave further detail regarding Doom's scarring; Byrne used the idea that the accident at Empire State University only left Doom with a small scar that was exaggerated into a more disfiguring accident by Doom's own arrogance; when Doom puts on the armor forged for him when it had yet to cool, however, he truly damages his face.<ref>{{Cite comic | cartoonist = [[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]] | Story =''True Lies'' | title = Fantastic Four | Volume = 1 | Issue =278 | year = 1985 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

After Byrne's departure Doctor Doom continued to be a major villain in ''Fantastic Four'', and as the 1980s continued Doom appeared in other comics such as ''[[Punisher]]'', ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', and ''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]''. Under Fantastic Four writer Steven Englehart, Doom became exiled from Latveria by his heir Kristoff, who was brainwashed into thinking he was Doom. Doom would spend most of his time in exile planning his return, but Englehart left the title before he could resolve the storyline. This storyline ultimately ended with the controversial  ''Fantastic Four'' #350, where writer [[Walt Simonson]] had the Doom who had been seen in the book during the Englehart run being revealed to be a Doombot and the real Doom, in a newly redesigned armor, returning to claim his country from his usurper. Simonson's [[retroactive continuity|retcon]] stated that Doom's last real appearance was in the famous "Battle of Baxter Building" though with occasional trips back home, though Doom was shown to be unaware of certain major changes at the time to the Fantastic Four. An [[urban legend]] states that Simonson drew up a list of official stories which featured the real Doom and those which did not<ref>{{cite web| author = Cronin, Brian | title = Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #100 | work = [[Comic Book Resources]] | date = 2007-04-26 | url = http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/04/26/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-100/ | accessdate=2008-02-14}}</ref> but this plotline was dropped and never mentioned again by later writers, who ignored Simonson's declaration as subterfuge Doom stated for the sake of blaming past failures on Doombots.<ref>Fantastic Four #357</ref>

===Modern depictions===
In 2003, Doom was the sole villain in the ''Fantastic Four'' story arc "''Unthinkable''", in which Doom imprisons [[Franklin Richards]] in Hell and captures [[Valeria Richards]] and succeeds in catching the Fantastic Four. Writer Mark Waid sought to redefine Doom's character in a way that had not been seen before.<!-- add the interview ref here --> In Waid's reinterpretation (very controversial for many fans), Doom hates Richards for knowing at his core he was right when Doom was wrong.<ref>{{cite web|author=Brady, Matt|date=2003-01-23|url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=1041|title=Waid thinks the Unthinkable|work=[[Newsarama]]|accessdate=2008-02-20}}</ref><ref name="FFManifisto">{{Cite book|last=Waid|first=Mark|authorlink=Mark Waid|url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0785114866|title=Fantastic Four Volume One|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=2004-08-01|location=New York|pages=''The Fantastic Four Manifesto''|isbn=0785114866}}</ref> Waid was also convinced that the "''truism that Victor Von Doom is, despite his villainy, a noble man''" (as suggested in both Lee's and Byrne's run) "is absolute crap. [...] A man [Doom] whose entire motivating force is jealousy is ridiculously petty, not grandly noble. Yes, Doom is ''regal'', and yes, whenever possible, Doom likes to ''act'' as if he possesses great moral character, because to him that's what great men ''have''... — but when I hear Doom say it 'does not ''suit'' him to' do this-and-such, what I hear is, 'it has nothing to do with my hatred for Reed Richards, so it's not worth my time.'" Waid also stated that Doom "''would tear the head off a newborn baby and eat it like an apple while his mother watched if it would somehow prove he were smarter than Reed.''"<ref name="FFManifisto"/>

Waid punctuated this reinterpretation of Doom  during his "Unthinkable" saga (Vol 2 #66-70 & Vol 1 (restart) #500) as an absolute sadist by having Von Doom ruthlessly murder Valeria, his first love and granddaughter to his long serving faithful retainer Boris. He subsequently attempted to prove his superiority to Reed by giving him the chance to find his way out of a prison that could only be escaped by mastering magic, in the belief that Reed would fail to do so, but with the aid of the astral projection of Doctor Strange Reed learned to master magic by accepting that he could not understand it. This fight resulted in Doom being trapped in Hell until the events of Ragnarok, Thor's hammer [[Mjolnir (Marvel Comics)|Mjolnir]] falling through dimensions and giving Doom a way out of Hell when it was lost after Thor's apparent 'death'.

In 2005 and 2006, Doom was featured in his own limited series, ''Books of Doom'', a retelling of the origin story by [[Ed Brubaker]].<ref name="books of doom interview">{{cite web|author=Brady, Matt|date=2005-10-27|url=http://www.newsarama.com/marvelnew/Nov_previews/BruDoom.htm|title=Brubaker on ''Books of Doom''|work=[[Newsarama]]|accessdate=2008-02-14}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> In an interview, Brubaker said the series was a way to elaborate on the earlier portions of Doom's life which had not been seen often in the comics. The series also set out to determine if Doom's path from troubled child to dictator was fated or Doom's own faults led to his corruption — in essence, a [[nature versus nurture]] question.<ref>{{cite web|author=Tramountanas, George|date=2005-10-07|title=Brubaker of Deflowering Doom|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=6014|work=[[Comic Book Resources]]|accessdate=2008-02-13}}</ref> Brubaker's version of Doom was heavily influenced by the original Lee/Kirby version; responding to a question if he would show Doom's face, Brubaker stated "''following Kirby's example, I think it's better not to show it.''"<ref name="books of doom interview"/>

[[The Mighty Avengers]] invaded Latveria, Doom's nation, due to his involvement in creating a chemical bomb that would infect people with the [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] (Although it was recently revealed that this attack was actually set up by [[Kristoff Vernard]] to put Doom out of the picture prior to Kristoff's future attempt at a coup).<ref>''Spider-Man/Fantastic Four'' #4</ref> Due to [[Ultron]]'s interference, the bomb was dropped on [[Manhattan]], but the Mighty Avengers are able to stop the effects on the people. The Mighty Avengers proceed to invade Latveria. During the invasion, the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]], [[Iron Man]], and Doom are sent to the past thanks to Doom’s time platform. Eventually, the trio breaks into the Baxter Building and make use of a confiscated time machine to return to the present era, the Sentry taking advantage of the fact he will soon be forgotten by the world to easily defeat the Thing. Doom transports himself to Morgana's castle to summon up a magical army and captures the Avengers, but they free themselves and he is arrested for terrorist crimes against humanity after a brief struggle that culminated with the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] tearing off Doom's mask.

During [[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]] when Norman Osborn is in charge, Doom is released and sent back to Latveria. However, Morgana le Fay engages him in a magical battle, which he is losing until the [[Dark Avengers]] rescue him. He then magically rebuilds his kingdom.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #1-4</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
{{Expand section|date=October 2011}}
Victor von Doom was born decades ago to a tribe of [[Latveria]]n gypsies under the rule of an unnamed nobleman called the Baron. Victor's mother was a [[witchcraft|witch]] named Cynthia who died by [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]'s hand while Doom was young. Victor's father, Werner, was the leader of the tribe and a renowned medicine man who kept his wife's sorcerous life quiet in order to protect Victor from a similar fate. Soon after Cynthia's death, the Baron's wife grew incurably ill from cancer and Werner was called to the capitol to heal her. When she succumbed to illness, the Baron labeled Werner a murderer and called for his death. Werner escaped with young Victor, having realised the night before the women would die, only to die of exposure on the mountainside, cradling the boy in a final embrace and giving him his garments to keep him warm. Victor survived and, on return to the gypsy camp, discovered his mother's occult instruments and swore revenge on the Baron. Victor grew into a headstrong and brilliant man, combining sorcery and technology to create fantastic devices to keep the Baron's men at bay and protect the gypsies. His exploits attracted the attention of the dean of [[Empire State University]], who sent someone to the camp.<ref name=origin/> Offered the chance to study in America, Doom chooses to leave his homeland and his love, Valeria, behind. Once in America, Victor met fellow student and future nemesis [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]], who was intended to be his roommate, but Doom disliked him and asked for another roommate. After a time, Victor constructed a machine intended to communicate with the dead. Though Richards tried to warn him about a flaw in the machine, seeing his calculations were a few decimals off, Victor continued on with disastrous results. The machine violently failed and the resulting explosion seemingly severely damaged his face.<ref name=origin>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]] | Artist =[[Jack Kirby|Kirby, Jack]] | Story =''Origin of Doctor Doom'' | title = Fantastic Four Annual| Volume = | Issue =2 | year = 1964 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> Expelled after the accident, Victor traveled the world until he collapsed on a [[Tibet]]an mountainside. Rescued by a clan of monks, Victor quickly mastered the monks' disciplines as well as the monks themselves. Victor then forged himself a suit of armor, complete with a scowling mask, and took the name Doctor Doom.<ref name=origin/> As Doom, he would go on to menace those he felt responsible for his accident&mdash;primarily, Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four. He succeeded in taking over Latveria, taking an interest in the welfare of the [[Roma (comics)|Roma]].

In his first appearance, Doom travels back in time to steal the enchanted treasure of [[Blackbeard]] and conquer the world, but he is fooled by Reed Richards, who swaps the treasure with worthless chains.<ref name="appearance">{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]] | Artist =[[Jack Kirby|Kirby, Jack]] | Story =Prisoners of Doctor Doom!  | Title = Fantastic Four | Volume =  | Issue =5  | Date = July 1962 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]| Page =  }}</ref> Returning to Earth after learning the secrets of an advanced alien race, Doom exchanges consciousnesses with Mr. Fantastic; Richards, inhabiting Doom's body, switches the two back, and Doom ends up trapped in a micro-world.<ref>[[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]] (w), [[Jack Kirby|Kirby, Jack]], "The Return of Dr. Doom" ''Fantastic Four'', #10, January 1963</ref> Doom takes over the micro-world and returns before being thrown into space.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]] | Artist =[[Jack Kirby|Kirby, Jack]] | Story =The Master Plan of Dr. Doom | Title = Fantastic Four | Issue = 23  | Date = February 1964 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> Doom is saved by [[Kang the Conqueror|Rama-Tut]], and he returns to Earth to destroy the Fantastic Four by turning each member against the other using a special berry juice.

During John Bryne's run in the 1980s, Doom attempts to steal cosmic powers on [[Terrax]], but Doom's body is destroyed in the resulting fight between Terrax and the Silver Surfer.<ref name="FF#258">{{Cite comic | Cartoonist = [[John Byrne|Byrne, John]]| Story =Interlude | Title = Fantastic Four | Volume = | Issue =258 | Date = September 1983 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | Page = }}</ref> Doom survives by transferring his consciousness to another human, and is returned to his original body by the [[Beyonder]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #287-288</ref>

In the 2000s, Doom rediscovered his mystical heritage, using his powers in an attempt to destroy the Fantastic Four after making a deal with a group of demons called the Hazarath Three, but later is consigned to a hell dimension after Richards manages to trick him into rejecting the idea that the demons aided him. He escapes and attempts to claim [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'s mystical hammer [[Mjolnir (Marvel Comics)|Mjolnir]] for himself, after the rift the hammer created as it fell to Earth following the destruction of Asgard allowed him to escape. The plot fails due to his inability to lift the hammer, and Doom returns to Latveria to rule once again.

Later, a Doombot was taken down by Reed Richards, Henry Pym, Iron Man, She-Hulk and others in New York City. Whether or not it was sent by Doom himself remains to be seen, as does his role in the overall conflict. Doom was not invited to the wedding of [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] and the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]. However, he did send a present: an invitation to form an alliance with Latveria, using the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] currently going on among the hero community as a reason to quite possibly forge an alliance between their two countries. When Black Panther, on a diplomatic mission to other countries with Storm, did show up in Latveria, he presented them with a real present, and extended another invitation to form an alliance with Black Panther. He demonstrated behavior very uncharacteristic of him, however, which may or may not become a plot point later. Panther spurned the invitation, detonating an EMP that blacked out a local portion of Latveria before Doom's robots could destroy his ship. Later on, Doctor Doom is then shown collaborating with the Red Skull on a weapon which will only "be the beginning" of [[Captain America]]'s suffering. Doctor Doom gave the Red Skull the weapon because the Red Skull gave Victor pieces of technology from an old German castle. The castle was owned by a "Baron of Iron" centuries prior, who had used his technological genius to protect himself and his people. The map the Red Skull used to find the castle bore a picture of Doctor Doom. Doctor Doom states that the technology the Red Skull gave him is more advanced than what he currently has, and that he will become the Baron of Iron in his future. The Red Skull is currently in the process of reverse-engineering Doom's weapon for multiple uses, rather than the single use Doom agreed to.

At the end of the first chapter of the X-Men event ''[[X-Men: Endangered Species|Endangered Species]]'', Doctor Doom is among the supervillain geniuses that [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] contacts to help him reverse the effects of [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]]. He spurns Beast by stating that genetics do not number among his talents.

In ''[[Spider-Man: One More Day]]'', Doctor Doom was among those that Spider-Man contacts to help save Aunt May.

Doctor Doom also makes Latveria into a refugee camp for the [[Atlantis|Atlanteans]] following the destruction of their underwater kingdom<ref>Sub-Mariner vol. 2, #1-6 (Aug. 2007 - Jan. 2008)</ref> as well as becoming allies with [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] in his plot to manipulate [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] into unwittingly release his Asgardian enemies.<ref>Thor vol. 3, #5</ref>

Doctor Doom later defends Latveria from the [[Mighty Avengers]], following a revelation that it was one of Doctor Doom's satellites that carried the 'Venom Virus' released in New York City.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #8</ref> In a battle with Iron Man and the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]], the time travel mechanism within his armor overloads, trapping Doom and his opponents at some point in the past.

Despite this, Doctor Doom ended up incarcerated at [[The Raft (comics)|The Raft]].

During the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline, Doctor Doom was among the villains who escaped the Raft when a virus was uploaded into its systems by the [[Skrull]]s.

In the aftermath of the Secret Invasion, Doctor Doom is a member of the Dark Illuminati alongside [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborne]], [[Emma Frost]], Namor, Loki's female form, and [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]. At the end of this meeting, Namor and Doctor Doom are seen having a discussion of their own plans that have all ready been set in motion.<ref>Dark Reign #1</ref>

Doom soon allies himself with the isolationist group known as the Desturi, to take control of Wakanda. He attacked and wounded T'Challa, the current Black Panther, maiming him enough to prevent him from holding the mantle again. Doom's main objective was to secure Wakanda's store of vibranium, which he could mystically enhance to make himself unstoppable. Doom was also a part of the supervillain group known as the [[Intelligencia]], but was betrayed when they captured him to complete their plan. With the help of [[Bruce Banner]], he escaped, and returned to Latveria. He appears to have been damaged by this experiences.

At the start of the ''[[Siege (comics)|Siege]] storyline, Doctor Doom is with the Cabal discussing the current problems with the X-Men and both Avengers teams. Doom demands that Osborn at once reverse his course of action against his ally Namor, to which Osborn refuses, saying that he and Emma Frost had "crossed the line" with him. Doom, loathing Thor and the Asgardians all the more due to his recent defeat at their hands, claims that he will support Osborn's "madness" should Namor be returned to him, but Osborn refuses. Osborn's mysterious ally, the Void, violently attacks Doctor Doom, and an apparently amused Loki tells the Hood that he should go, as there is nothing here for either of them, which the Hood, now loyal to Loki due to his hand in the restoration of his mystical abilities, agrees. However, it is revealed that "Doom" is actually an upgraded Doombot, which releases swarms of Doombot nanites against the Cabal, tearing down Avengers Tower and forcing its denizens, such as the Dark Avengers, to evacuate. Osborn is rescued by the Sentry, who destroys the body. When Osborn contacts Doom, Doom tells him not to ever strike him again or he is willing to go further.<ref name="Siege: The Cabal"/>

It has been revealed that the Scarlet Witch seen in Wundagore Mountain is actually a Doombot which apparently means that the real one has been captured by Doom sometime after the House of M event.<ref>''Avengers: The Children's Crusade'' #2</ref> It is revealed that Wanda's enhanced powers were a result of her and Doctor Doom's combined attempt to channel the Life Force in order to resurrect her children. This proves to be too much for Wanda to contain and it overtook her. With Wiccan and Doctor Doom's help, they seek to use the entity that is possessing Wanda to restore mutantkinds' powers. This is stopped by the Young Avengers (who are concerned at the fall-out that would ensue if the powerless mutants are suddenly repowered) only to find out Doom's real plan: to transfer the entity into his own body and gaining Wanda's god-like powers for himself.<ref>''Avengers: The Children's Crusade'' #7</ref>

At the start of the story arc Fantastic Four: Three, Doctor Doom felt that he needed to be "reborn" and was making plans to abdicate his throne and give it to Kristoff when Valeria teleported to his room unexpectedly asking for his assistance to help her father. Valeria quickly notices that Doctor Doom has suffered brain damage and makes a deal with him to restore his mental capacities if he helps Reed and the Fantastic Four. Doom agrees to her proposition.<ref name="Fantastic Four #583"/> Later, Doctor Doom appears among those in attendance at Johnny Storm's funeral.<ref name="Fantastic Four #588"/>

Due to the agreement, Doctor Doom was recommended by Nathaniel and Valeria Richards to be a member of the [[Future Foundation]].<ref name="FF #1"/> Objecting, Thing attacks Doom out of anger, but the fight was stopped by Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Woman, who welcomes Doctor Doom to their group. When Valeria asks Doctor Doom if he has a backup for restoring his memories, he reveals that [[Kristoff Vernard]] is his backup. Afterward, Mr. Fantastic, Spider-Man, Nathaniel, Valeria, and Doctor Doom head to [[Latveria]] to meet with Kristoff and request his help. Mister Fantastic sets up a brain transfer machine in order to help restore Doctor Doom's memories and knowledge, which is successful. When Kristoff wants to return the throne to him, Doctor Doom states that it is not time yet because of a promise he made to Valeria. When Mister Fantastic asks what promise Doctor Doom made to Valeria, Doctor Doom states that he made a promise to help defeat Mister Fantastic.<ref name="FF #2"/> Doctor Doom decides to hold a symposium on how to finally defeat Reed Richards.

Bentley 23 even gives an invitation to his creator, the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]], along with two [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] lieutenants. However, it is subsequently revealed that the 'Richards' they have been invited to defeat are actually members of the "Council of Reeds" (alternate versions of Reed who were trapped in this universe by Valeria a while back, possessing Reed's intellect while lacking his conscience).<ref>''FF'' #3</ref> While Spider-Man and Invisible Woman make sandwiches for the kids, Mister Fantastic, Doctor Doom, Valeria, and Nathaniel Richards meet with the supervillain geniuses and [[Uatu]] the [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]] about what to do with the Council of Reeds.<ref>''FF'' #4</ref>

[[Image:Doomcosmicpower.jpg|thumb|right|Doctor Doom steals the [[Silver Surfer]]'s powers in ''Fantastic Four'' #57 (1966). Art by Jack Kirby.]]

Doctor Doom is a [[polymath]] scientific genius. Throughout much of his publication history, he has been depicted as one of the most intelligent humans in the [[Marvel Universe]] -- second only to his archrival [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]]. He has constructed numerous devices in order to defeat his foes or gain more power, including a [[Time travel|time machine]], a device to imbue people with superpowers, and numerous [[robot]]s; Doom's calculating and strategic nature leads him to use "Doombots," exact mechanical replicas of the real Doctor Doom, for many missions, typically those where he fears defeat. Sometimes the Doombots even believe themselves to be Doctor Doom.<ref name="FF#258"/> The character has also used his scientific talents to steal or replicate the power of other beings such as the [[Silver Surfer]], or in one case [[the Beyonder]]. Doctor Doom also possesses considerable mystical capabilities due to teachings from Tibetan monks, and tutoring from his lover [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan Le Fey]]. He is capable of energy projection, creating protective shields, and summoning hordes of demonic creatures.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #9-11</ref> The alien [[List of alien races in Marvel Comics#O|Ovoids]] taught Doom the process of psionically transferring his consciousness into another nearby being through a simple eye contact, as well as showing him other forms of technology<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comiccollectorlive.com/LiveData/Issue.aspx?id=f1d9898a-de86-4635-a252-5459de32e56a |title=Fantastic Four 10 A, Jan 1963 Comic Book by Marvel |publisher=Comiccollectorlive.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-16}}</ref><ref>http://i388.photobucket.com/albums/oo326/OneDumbG0/Doom%20Stats/DoomPowers01-OvoidMindTransfer10.jpg</ref> which Doom uses to escape from [[incarceration]]s and to avoid getting killed;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comiccollectorlive.com/LiveData/Issue.aspx?id=1aeb4290-639e-428b-bcf7-c2c282f190a7 |title=Fantastic Four 287 A, Feb 1986 Comic Book by Marvel |publisher=Comiccollectorlive.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-16}}</ref><ref>http://i388.photobucket.com/albums/oo326/OneDumbG0/Doom%20Stats/DoomPowers05-OvoidMindTransfer287.jpg</ref> however, if his concentration is broken, it can transfer his mind back, and he rarely uses this power unless absolutely necessary due to his own ego about his apearance. Doom can exert technopathic control over certain machines, most notably, the Doombots. In addition, Doom has a remarkably strong will, as demonstrated in the [[graphic novel]], ''Emperor Doom'' when he dared his prisoner, the mind controlling [[Purple Man]], to attempt to control him and he successfully resists. Also, without his armor he proved himself to be a skilled bare-handed fighter, capable of killing someone and even a lion with a single hit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.killermovies.com/forums/f98/t495216.html|title= Revamped Dr. Doom Respect Thread/VIII.

As the absolute monarch of Latveria, Dr. Doom has diplomatic immunity- allowing him to escape prosecution for most of his crimes- and total control of the nation's natural and technological resources, as well as its manpower, economy, and military.

In ''Fantastic Four'' 566-569 Doctor Doom received a significant power upgrade. He was thrown back in time (perhaps about 50 million years) by the Marquis of Death. Doom then fought through time and space to get back to present to seek revenge on the Marquis of Death. Doom stated, as he killed the Marquis, he had rebuilt every molecule of his being and increased his power all to destroy the Marquis. In later issues this seems to have been ignored however, with writers treating Doctor Doom the way they have always before in terms of power (Although it may be that he had to expend his power to destroy the Marquis).

Doom is known for the frequent plot device wherein it is revealed the his actions were actually those of a "Doombot", one of Doom's many robot doubles, either working on his behalf or as a result of rogue [[artificial intelligence]].

On many occasions, Doom's only real weakness has been shown to be his arrogance, [[Layla Miller]] once reflecting that Doom is incapable of accepting that he himself might be the reason for his failures. While his high opinion of himself is generally accurate, possessing sufficient resources to stand up to virtually every hero and villain in the Marvel Universe and walk away despite their greater natural powers, he is notably generally unable to accept when others may have a better understanding of a situation than he does – although he has been noted to have enough respect for heroes such as Reed Richards or the Thing to at least listen to their recommendations about threats that he himself has not encountered rather than dismiss them instantly – and even when forced to team up with others to defeat a greater threat Doom has been shown to be willing to try to gain a personal advantage when the more expedient course of action would be to stick to the plan and try for greater rewards later, such as when he tried to steal the Infinity Gauntlet from [[Thanos]] during the heroes' initial assault against the Titan rather than adhere to [[Adam Warlock]]'s plan of attack and attempt to acquire the Gauntlet after Thanos had been defeated.

Doom adheres to a strict code of honor at all times, so much so that it is accepted by nearly every character in the Marvel Universe that he always keeps his word, no matter what the cost to himself or his plans may be. It is also understood that Doom will keep his ''exact'' word, which may or may not be beneficial to the person to whom he has given his promise. For example, Doom may swear that he will not harm an individual, but that only means he will not personally harm that person, it does not mean he will prevent others from harming that person. If someone saves his life, Doom will set aside ''any'' personal gain or goal in order to repay that debt. He once saved Captain America from drowning, despite the fact that Captain America had thwarted his plans many times in the past, because Captain America had earlier saved his life. On another occasion he thanked Spider-Man for saving him from terrorists attacking him in an airport by allowing him to leave despite Spider-Man subsequently insulting him. His code of honor also means that he will not attack a respected opponent who is weakened or at a severe disadvantage, as he regards any victory resulting from such circumstances as hollow and meaningless. He has even on several occasions battled opponents who were intent on killing the Fantastic Four, for no other reason than the fact that he does not want the ultimate defeat of the Fantastic Four to come from anyone's hands but his own.

==Other versions==
{{Main|Alternative versions of Doctor Doom}}

Doctor Doom's status as one of the Fantastic Four's greatest villains<ref name="greatest villains of the FF">{{Cite book|title=Greatest Villains of the Fantastic Four: Introduction |last= Ashford|first=Richard |year= 1995|publisher= Marvel Comics|location= |isbn=0-7851-0079-2 |pages=ii }}</ref> has led to his appearance in many of Marvel's alternate universes and spinoffs, in which the character's history, circumstances and behavior vary from the mainstream setting.

==In other media==
Doctor Doom has been included in almost every  media adaptation of the ''Fantastic Four'' franchise, including [[film]], television, and [[Video game|computer and video games]].

===Television===
* Dr. Doom's first animated appearance was in 1966 on [[Namor|the Sub-Mariner's]] segment of ''[[The Marvel Super Heroes]]''.

* Doom subsequently appeared in several episodes of [[Hanna-Barbera]]'s ''[[Fantastic Four (1967 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]'' series from 1967, where he was voiced by Joseph Sirola.

* In 1978, Dr. Doom appeared in two episodes of [[DePatie-Freleng Enterprises]]' ''[[Fantastic Four (1978 TV series)|The New Fantastic Four]]'' voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]].

* Perhaps most significantly, Dr. Doom appeared in no less than six episodes of the 1981 ''[[Spider-Man (1981 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' series produced by [[Marvel Productions]]. Voiced by Ralph James (with heavy modulation akin to [[Darth Vader]]), the latter five episodes, written by Larry Parr, comprised a complete story arc, and four of them were at one point edited together into an animated feature. He was also the only villain other than [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] to appear in more than one episode.

* In ''[[Fantastic Four (1994 TV series)|The Fantastic Four]]'' (1994–1996), he was voiced by [[John Vernon]] and [[Neil Ross]] in season one and by [[Simon Templeman]] in season two. In "Mask of Doom," he captured the Fantastic Four and forced [[Mister Fantastic]], [[Human Torch]], and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] to go back in time and obtain an object for him. In "Silver Surfer and the Return of Galactus," he steals the Silver Surfer's powers and destroy the Fantastic Four, but is tricked by the FF(who are in the fantastic car with the Silver Surfer) to follow them to outer space, but due to Galactus decree that the Silver Surfer may not surf the cosmos every again is thwarted by the planet devourer himself and the power of cosmic is return to the Surfer. In "And a Blind Man Shall Lead Them," he struck at a powerless FF and had his hands crushed by the Thing. In "Nightmare in Green," he directed the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] to attack the team. In "Doomsday," he again acquired the [[Power Cosmic]] in the series finale. Once again, he is tricked into going to outer space, only to hit the barrier that prevents the Silver Surfer from leaving Earth.

* Simon Templeman reprised his role for guest appearances in two episodes of ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1996 TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' (1996–1997), in which Doom held Washington, D.C. captive, only to be defeated by [[She-Hulk]], whom he later attempted to claim revenge upon. With his appearance on this show, it can be assumed that Doom survived the fate he met on the Fantastic Four series, if both shows are to be considered within [[Marvel animated universe|the same continuity]].

* [[Tom Kane]] took over the character for a three-part guest spot in the final season of ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' (1994–1998), reimagining Doom's role in the [[Secret Wars]]. In the third part of the episode, Doom turned part of the alien world he was on into "New Latveria" after overthrowing [[Doctor Octopus]] and renaming Octavia to New Latveria. However, he did not use his ruling powers to oppress, and allowed the aliens in his country to live in peace and harmony, protecting them from the other villains. He even kidnapped the Thing only to cure him of his deformity, turning him back to Ben Grimm, and healed his own face as an afterthought. With Ben's cooperation, he then stole the powers of the [[Beyonder]], and with this newfound power, Doctor Doom sent the other villains back to Earth and almost killed the superheroes that Ben fought along with. However, the Thing turned Doom's weapon on him, and the powers of the Beyonder were returned to the mystic figure himself. Doom was then returned to Earth with no memory of these events (as well as, presumably, his scarred face), along with every other villain and superhero apart from [[Spider-Man]].

* Doctor Doom is the most recurring antagonist in ''[[Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes]]'' voiced by [[Paul Dobson (actor)|Paul Dobson]]. In the pilot, "Doomsday", he is revealed to have [[diplomatic immunity]] as a head of state, which means the American police cannot place him under arrest. In one episode where in one of his experiments his mind gets put into Reed Richards, and vice versa, more is revealed about Doom's life and ruling attitude. Doom (with Richards' mind) is now considerably more polite and respectful of others. Reed also commands the [[List of devices used by Doctor Doom#Doombots|Doombots]] to destroy themselves as "word of Doom is law", and releases the face mask. Though the viewer is not shown Doom's face, when Reed and Doom return to their proper bodies, Richards tells Doom that Doom's insecurity, in particular about his personal appearance, is his greatest adversary.

* Doctor Doom appears as the primary antagonist in the first season of ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]'' voiced by [[Charlie Adler]]. He is after the Infinity Sword and has enlisted a number of villains to help him obtain it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0907/28/voices.htm |title=Comics Continuum |publisher=Comics Continuum |date=2009-07-28 |accessdate=2010-08-16}}</ref>

* Doctor Doom first appears in the ''[[Iron Man: Armored Adventures]]'' episode "The Might of Doom"<ref>"[http://marvel.toonzone.net/news.php?action=fullnews&id=538; Nicktoons Announces "Iron Man: Armored Adventures" Season Two 2011 Debut]". May 21, 2010</ref> voiced by [[Christopher Britton (actor)|Christopher Britton]].  The background and basis of the character is vastly different from his printed page version.  Here, Victor Von Doom is a member of the royal family of Latervia (not a gyspy), he was married, his scarring accident happened in Latveria (not as ESU with Reed Richards intervening) and resulted in him killing the ruling portion of his family thus inheriting the throne (not overthrowing the reigning Prince Zorba) and he has rarely visited the USA (unlike printed page Doom who has a scaled down version of his Castle Doom as his embassy in the USA).  No mention of the Fantastic Four are made in this episode regarding Doom's background, suggesting either the Fantastic Four do not exist in this reality or have no known interaction thus far with Doom.  Doom appeared in New York to meet up with [[Obadiah Stane]], in order to obtain the armor specifications from stolen Iron Man files, and in return would improve Stane's "Monger Core" generator. After the retrieval of the specs occurred, Doom fought Iron Man and put him into a three-hour deep sleep, also beating War Machine. After the core was upgraded, Doom activated a timer that would first have the generator absorb all the energy in New York then expel it in one enormous blast. Iron Man, however was able to stop the timer, angering Doom. War Machine landed Doom's plane, who returned the favor by nearly defeating the two armored heroes in a two-on-one battle. Doom was later picked up by SHIELD forces after War Machine's retreat, and was escorted back to Latveria. Doom's armor was declared so advanced that Tony stated it made his armor "look like a toaster with arms," later revealed due to the fact it was based off of Makluan technology.<br>Dr. Doom is confirmed to appear in at least one more episode of the second season.<ref>http://marvel.toonzone.net/news.php?action=fullnews&id=731</ref>

* Doctor Doom will appear in ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]''. Doctor Doom was already mentioned in this series in the episode "The Breakout" Pt. 1 when Iron Man talks to [[Pepper Potts]] saying "guess who I just ticked off this morning? Here's a hint: his name rhymes with "Boom". [[Lucia von Bardas]] had a cameo doing a trade with A.I.M on Doctor Doom's behalf.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dan Iverson |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/110/1108401p1.html |title=SDCC 10: The Avengers Assemble On The Small Screen - TV News at IGN |publisher=Tv.ign.com |date=2010-07-25 |accessdate=2011-04-12}}</ref> He will debut in the episode "The Private War of Dr. Doom". The episode has been shown as a promotion event at the 2011 San Diego and New York Comic-Con events.<ref>http://m.ign.com/articles/1200539</ref> It will be broadcast along with the other episodes of the second season in 2012.

* The Ultimate Universe version of Doctor Doom will appear in the upcoming ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' TV series.<ref>http://www.comicbookmovie.com/fansites/HillbillyShadow/news/?a=45771</ref>

===Film===
* Doctor Doom is the main antagonist from the unreleased [[The Fantastic Four (film)|film based on the Fantastic Four]], which was produced by [[Roger Corman]] in 1994. In it, Doom (portrayed by Joseph Culp) was a college classmate of Reed Richards, who was nearly killed in an accident when both he and Reed try to capture the power of a comet called Colossus.
* Doctor Doom the main [[antagonist]] in the 2005 film ''[[Fantastic Four (film)|Fantastic Four]]'' played by [[Julian McMahon]]. In the film Doctor Doom seems to be more based on his [[Alternative versions of Doctor Doom#Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate counterpart]].
* Doctor Doom returns as a villain in the sequel ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]'' with McMahon reprising the role.

===Video games===
[[Image:Dr Doom v Magneto.png|right|300px|thumb|Doctor Doom faces off against ''[[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]'' in the 1995 fighting game ''[[Marvel Super Heroes (arcade game)|Marvel Super Heroes]].'']]
* Doctor Doom has appeared in several [[video game]]s. He was the final [[boss (video games)|boss]] in the 1989 [[personal computer game|computer game]] ''[[Spider-Man and Captain America in Doctor Doom's Revenge]]''.

* He appeared as the main antagonist and second-to-last boss in [[Sega]]'s 1991 ''[[Spider-Man: The Video Game|Spider-Man]]'' [[arcade game]].

* Later, he was featured as a boss character in the [[Capcom]] [[fighting game]] ''[[Marvel Super Heroes (arcade game)|Marvel Super Heroes]]'', who only became playable after the game was beaten once and a code was entered. He returned as a selectable character in ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes|Marvel vs. Capcom 2]]''. He is particularly notorious for the so-called ''[[Strider (arcade game)|Strider]]/Doom trap'' in the latter game. He also appeared in ''[[Marvel Super Heroes: War of the Gems]]'' for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]].

* He appeared in [[Fantastic Four (2005 video game)|the game based upon the 2005 Fantastic 4 movie]] voiced by Julian McMahon.

* He is an exclusive character for the [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] version of ''[[Marvel Nemesis: Rise of the Imperfects]]''.

* He was confirmed to be a playable character in ''[[Marvel Nemesis 2|Marvel Nemesis 2: Fall of the Imperfects]]'', until the game was canceled.

* In the special edition of ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', the player will view concept art that shows [[Abner Jenkins#Ultimate Beetle|the Beetle]] presenting [[Ultimate Sandman|the Sandman vial]] to Doctor Doom after Beetle has evaded [[Spider-Man]].

* Doctor Doom is the primary antagonist of ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'', voiced by [[Clive Revill]]. [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]] and [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] have special dialogue with him. In the game, he attempts (and succeeds) in stealing the power of [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]]. To do this, he forms a new [[Masters of Evil]] and makes a pact with [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] to obtain his Twilight Sword. It was mentioned that Doctor Doom corrupted [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]] when she was looking for the [[Ultimate Nullifier]] on [[Muir Island]]. While the players were obtaining the Muonic Inducer and the [[M'Kraan Crystal]], Doctor Doom defeated every hero that tried to stop him and discovered that Odin's powers allowed him to corrupt the defeated heroes (such as [[Psylocke]], [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], [[Professor X]], [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]], [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], [[Emma Frost]], and the [[Punisher]], in the Doom's Day cutscene) into his dark superhero army, and then used it to corrupt Earth. It was also discovered that he can use the powers of Odin to create evil clones of superheroes out of nothingness resulting in the creations of Dark [[Captain America]], Dark [[Spider-Man]], Dark [[Iron Man]], Dark [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], and the Dark [[Fantastic Four]] and corrupted [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Psylocke]]. At the end of the game, once Doom is defeated, Odin's powers are returned and he strikes Doom with a bolt of lightning, leaving only the villain's mask. Thor later states Doom is in the possession of Odin along with Loki (the reason as to which Odin is "occupied" as Thor put it.) Doom is a playable character downloadable for owners of the [[Xbox 360]] version of the game. If the player uses Doctor Doom and challenges himself in the last level, the game takes a strange but interesting turn. The Doctor Doom that is fought is, in reality, a Doctor Doom from a future in which [[Ragnarök]] has occurred, and all the gods of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] are dead. Doctor Doom, in an attempt to remedy this, travels to the present to usurp the power of Odin, and in the process, forms the Masters of Evil. However, the Doom from the present notices the presence of Doombots uncontrolled by himself, suspecting Reed Richards or [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]]. It is only until he meets his future self that he realizes that it is necessary to defeat the future Doom to keep the world from being destroyed, even though he is not without reluctance of relinquishing command over the power of Odin. This gives a complex and positive vision about the character and shows his high sense of honor.

* Doctor Doom appears in the ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer (video game)|Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]'' video game voiced by [[Gideon Emery]]. He plays a bigger role in the game than in the film as after he acquires the Surfer's powers, he intends to use them to fight [[Galactus]] and save Earth (though he only does this so he can conquer it afterwards). Unlike the film, he builds a machine to strip Galactus of most of his cosmic power for himself, but the F4 use his machine against him to defeat him.

* A statue of Doctor Doom is seen in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2]]''. When the player asks Thor on how Asgard is doing if one speaks to him after the Latverian mission, Thor mentions that he and Loki are still being punished by Odin. Though it is said Doom is dead. Doom is also mentioned as one of the villains who could control the nanite-infected humans, despite the fact he is considered deceased. A dossier on Doom can be found in Latveria.

* Doctor Doom appears in the ''[[Marvel Super Hero Squad (video game)|Marvel Super Hero Squad]]'' video game voiced by [[Charlie Adler]]. Regular, Ultimate, and Professor versions of Doom appear.

* Doctor Doom appears as a playable character in ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds]]''. He is one of the key characters in the game's plot, in which he joins forces with [[Albert Wesker]] (from ''[[Resident Evil (series)|Resident Evil]]'') to unite the Marvel and Capcom worlds so he can conquer both. Paul Dobson reprises his role from ''World's Greatest Heroes''. He reappears as a playable fighter in the updated version of the game, ''[[Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3]].

* Doctor Doom appears in the ''[[Marvel Super Hero Squad: The Infinity Gauntlet]]'' video game, again voiced by Charlie Adler.

* Doctor Doom appears as a villain character in ''[[Marvel Super Hero Squad Online]]'', now voiced by [[John DiMaggio]].
* Doctor Doom appears in the ''[[Marvel Super Hero Squad: Comic Combat]]'' video game, voiced by Charlie Alder.

===Parodies===
* In the ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[Krazy Kripples]]", Dr. Doom has a brief cameo as part of a version of the [[Legion of Doom (comics)|Legion of Doom]] led by [[Christopher Reeve]] which includes [[David Blaine]], [[Saddam Hussein (South Park)|Saddam Hussein]], [[Osama bin Laden]], [[Butters Stotch#Professor Chaos|Professor Chaos]], and [[General Disarray]]. He is also parodied as Professor Chaos.

* In the comic series [[Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham]], the title character's main antagonist is the would-be world conqueror Ducktor Doom, a duck parody of Doctor Doom.

==Cultural impact==
In the book ''Superhero: The Secret Origin of a Genre'', [[Peter Coogan]] writes that Doctor Doom's appearance was representative of a change in the portrayal of "mad scientists" to full-fledged villains, often with upgraded powers.<ref name="Comics 166">{{cite web|author=Sanderson, Peter|date=2007-02-24|url=http://www.quickstopentertainment.com/2007/02/24/comics-in-context-166-megahero-vs-megavillain/|title=Comics in Context #166: Megahero Vs.

''Comic Book Resources'' ranks Doom as their fourth favorite Marvel character. Journalist Brent Ecenbarger cited him being able to "''stand up against entities like [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], the [[Beyonder]], and [[Galactus]] and often come out on top''", as well as the tragedy of any "''other number of circumstances could have led to Doom being a savior, but as it is, instead he remains Marvel’s greatest villain.''" Fellow journalist Jason Stanhope called his "''master[ing] of sorcery and technology an unusual combination''", and also felt "''his inner sense of nobility sets him apart from lesser villains, in a similar manner to [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]].''"<ref>{{cite web| author = Brian Cronin | title = Top 50 Marvel Characters #4 | work = [[Comic Book Resources]] | date = 2007-09-26 | url = http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/09/26/top-50-marvel-characters-4/ | accessdate=2008-02-14}}</ref> Doom has also been favorably regarded by those who wrote for the character; Stan Lee declared Doom his favorite villain, saying "''[Doom] could come to the United States and he could do almost anything, and we could not arrest him because he has [[diplomatic immunity]]. Also, he wants to rule the world and if you think about it, wanting to rule the world is not a crime.''"<ref name="voa q and a">{{cite web|date=2007-08-15|author=Brummett, Erin|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/15-August-2007-Chat-Transcript-Stan-Lee.cfm|title=VOA Online Discussion: Comic Book Heroes|work=[[Voice of America]]|accessdate=2008-02-02}}</ref> [[Mark Waid]] echoed Lee's assessment of the character, stating that Doom "''[has] got a great look, a great visual design [and] a dynamite origin.''"<ref>{{cite web|author=Contino, Jennifer|date=2003-05-29|title=Waid's Fantastic Quartet|url=http://www.comicon.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&f=36&t=001050|work=ComicCon.com|accessdate=2008-02-14}}</ref>
