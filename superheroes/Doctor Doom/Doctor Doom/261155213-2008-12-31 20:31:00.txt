'''Doctor Doom''' ('''Victor von Doom''') is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]], a [[comic book]] [[supervillain]] published by [[Marvel Comics]] and appearing as an enemy of the [[Fantastic Four]]. Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], the character first appeared in ''Fantastic Four'' #5 (July 1962).

After a failed experiment leaves his face disfigured, the brilliant but arrogant Victor von Doom casts a set of armor and sets out to dominate the world, as well as to destroy his archenemy [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] and the other members of the Fantastic Four. He is the absolute monarch of the fictional European nation of [[Latveria]], which he rules with an iron fist.

Doctor Doom is one of Marvel Comics' most recognizable and archetypal supervillains; the character has fought and opposed more heroes than any other Marvel villain.<ref>{{cite book|last=Conroy|first=Mike|title=500 Comicbook Villains|publisher=Collins & Brown|year=2004|isbn=184340205X}}</ref> Creator Stan Lee declared Doom his favorite villain of those he created.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} [[Wizard (magazine)|''Wizard'' magazine]] rated Doctor Doom the 4th greatest villain of all time.<ref name="Wizard177"/> 

==Publication history==

===Creation and development===
Like many of Marvel's first characters, Doctor Doom was conceived by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]]. With ''Fantastic Four'' performing well, Lee and Kirby were trying to dream up a "''soul-stirring…super sensational new villain.''"<ref name="bad guys 12">{{cite book |title=''Bring On the Bad Guys!'' |last= Lee|first=Stan |authorlink=Stan Lee |year=1976 |publisher=[[Simon and Schuster]] |location= New York|isbn= |pages= 12}}</ref> Looking for a name, Lee latched onto "Doctor Doom" as "''eloquent in its simplicity — magnificent in its implied menace.''"<ref name="bad guys 12"/> Due to the rush to publish, Doom was not given a full origin in the first issue he appeared in, or even in subsequent stories in which he menaced the Fantastic Four<ref name="bad guys 12"/> (after issue #5 he appeared in issues six, ten, sixteen and seventeen in succession.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicvine.com/comic/fantastic-four/2045/&i=1468&f=y|title=Issues by Cover: Doctor Doom|work= ComicVine.com|accessdate=2008-02-02}}</ref> Doom's origins were finally revealed in the ''Fantastic Four Annual'' #2, more than two years after his first appearance.<ref name="bad guys 13">{{cite book |title=''Bring On the Bad Guys!'' |last= Lee|first=Stan |authorlink=Stan Lee |year=1976 |publisher=[[Simon and Schuster]] |location= New York|isbn= |pages= 13}}</ref> While The Fantastic Four had fought villains such as the [[Mole Man]], [[Skrull]]s, the [[Miracle Man]], and [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]] before Doom's appearance, Doom managed to overshadow them all and became the Fantastic Four's arch-nemesis.<ref name="greatest villains of the FF"/>

Lee established Doom's origins as the son of gypsies, born decades ago in Latveria when it was ruled by an unnamed nobleman called the Baron. Doom's mother was a witch, a fact his father tried to hide from the young boy; when his father is killed by the Baron's men unjustly, Doom discovers his mother's occult instruments and swears revenge on the Baron. Doom grows into a headstrong and brilliant man, who attracts the attention of the dean of [[Empire State University]].<ref name=origin/> Offered the chance to study in America, Doom leaves his homeland behind and meets a fellow student named [[Reed Richards]], though Doom disregards his peers. Richards tries to warn Doom about continuing an experiment to communicate with the dead with flawed figures, but Doom continues on; the resulting explosion severely damages Doom's face.<ref name=origin>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]] | Artist =[[Jack Kirby|Kirby, Jack]] | Story =''Origin of Doctor Doom'' | Title = ''Fantastic Four Annual''| Volume = | Issue =2 | year = 1964 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> Expelled after the accident, Doom travels the world, eventually being found by a clan of monks in [[Tibet]]. Mastering the monk's disciplines, he becomes their master and forges himself a suit of armor, complete with a mask that can only be removed by him.<ref name=origin/> Doom then returns to menace those he feels are responsible for his accident - including Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four.

Jack Kirby modeled Doom after [[Death (personification)|Death]], with the armor standing in for that character's skeleton; "''It was the reason for the armor and the hood. Death is connected with armor and the inhuman-like steel. Death is something without mercy, and human flesh contains that mercy.''"<ref name=death>{{cite book |title=''The Silver Age of Comic Book Art'' | last = Schumer | first = Arlen |year=2003 |publisher=Collectors Press |isbn=1-888054-85-9 |pages= 76}}</ref> Kirby further described Doom as being "paranoid", wrecked by his twisted face and wanting the whole world to be like him.<ref name=death/> Kirby went on to say that "''Doom is an evil person, but he's not always been evil. He was [respected]…but through a flaw in his own character, he was a perfectionist.''"<ref name="kirby collected">{{cite book |title=''The Collected Jack Kirby Collector'' |last=Morrow |first=John |authorlink= |coauthors= Kirby, Jack|year=2006 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |location= |isbn=1-893905-57-8 |pages= 101}}</ref> At one point in the Seventies, Kirby drew his interpretation of what Doom would look like under the mask, giving Doom only "''a tiny scar on his cheek.''"<ref name="silver kirby">{{cite book |title=''The Silver Age of Comic Book Art'' | last = Schumer | first = Arlen |year=2003 |publisher=Collectors Press |isbn=1-888054-85-9 |pages= 77}}</ref> Due to this slight imperfection, Doom hides his face not from the world, but from himself.<ref name="silver kirby"/> To Kirby, this is the motivation for Doom's vengeance against the world; because others are superior due to this slight scar, Doom wants to elevate himself above them.<ref name="kirby collected"/> Typical of Lee's writing characterization of Doom is his arrogance; his pride leads to Doom's disfigurement at the hands of his own machine, and to the failures of many of his schemes.<ref name="''Marvel Encyclopedia''">{{cite book |title=''Marvel Encyclopedia Vol. 6: Fantastic Four'' | last = Christiansen | first = Jeff |year=2004 |publisher=Marvel Entertainment Group|location=New York |isbn= |pages= 63–66}}</ref>

In 1969 Marvel announced plans to launch Doom in his own comic book, ''Doctor Doom''.  The comic was due for release in September 1969, with the story and penciling by [[Jack Kirby]], and would be the first time a villain had received a solo title.  Pressure from parental groups and the adverse publicity caused by the news forced Marvel to cancel the title and pulp the entire print run, with only Kirby's file copy surviving.  Kirby's decision to leave Marvel shortly after was influenced to some extent by these events.<ref>{{cite book|last=Morrow|first=John|title=The Collected Jack Kirby Collector|publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing|year=2004|pages=27|isbn=1893905020}}</ref>

During the 1970s, Doom branched out to more Marvel titles, with a battle between Doom and Prince Rudolfo over control of [[Latveria]] being featured in ''[[Astonishing Tales]]''.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Roy Thomas|Thomas, Roy]] | Artist =[[Wally Wood|Wood, Wally]] | Story =''Revolution!'' | Title = ''Astonishing Tales'' | Volume = | Issue =2-6 | Date =October 1970-June 1971 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]| Page = }}</ref> Doom also attempts to use the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] as his slave during two issues of ''The Incredible Hulk''.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Roy Thomas|Thomas, Roy]] | Artist =[[Dick Ayers|Ayers, Dick]] | Story =''Sanctuary!'' | Title =''Incredible Hulk''| Volume = | Issue =143 | Date =September 1971 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> The character also made several appearances in the story arcs of ''[[Super-Villain Team-Up]]'', starting in 1975, as well as appearances in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'', beginning with issue #42 (February 1976). Doom's origin was further elaborated on; a childhood companion, Valeria, was introduced and it was established Cynthia von Doom had sold her soul to [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]].<ref>{{Cite comic | writer = [[Gerry Conway|Conway, Gerry]] | artist =[[Gene Colan|Colan, Gene]] | title = ''[[Astonishing Tales]]'' | volume = 1 | issue = 8 | year = 1971 | publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

===1980s-1990s===
1981 saw Marvel and [[DC Comics]] collaborate on another project.  In 1976 the two companies had published ''[[Superman vs. the Amazing Spider-Man]]'', and seeking to replicate that success the two companies again teamed the characters up, in ''[[Superman and Spider-Man]]''.  Marvel [[editor-in-chief]] [[Jim Shooter]] co-wrote the story alongside [[Marv Wolfman]], and recalled choosing Doom based on his iconic status: "I figured I needed the heaviest-duty bad guy we had to offer — Doctor Doom. Their greatest hero against our greatest villain."<ref>{{cite book|last=Eury|first=Michael|title=The Krypton Companion|publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing|year=2006|pages=77|isbn=1893905616}}</ref> 

The same year saw [[John Byrne]] began his six-year run writing and illustrating ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' in 1981, sparking a "second golden age" for the title<ref>{{cite book |title=''The Slings & Arrows Comic Guide'' | last = Plowright | first = Frank |year=1997 |publisher=Aurum Press |isbn= |pages= }}</ref> but also attempting to "''turn the clock back [...] get back and see fresh what it was that made the book great at its inception.''"<ref>{{cite book |title=''Current Biography Yearbook'' | last = Mari | first = Christopher |year=2000 |publisher=H.W. Wilson, Co |isbn= |pages= 81}}</ref> Doom made his first appearance under Byrne's tenure with issue #236.<ref>{{Cite comic | Cartoonist = [[John Byrne|Byrne, John]]| Story =''Terror in a Tiny Town'' | Title = ''Fantastic Four'' | Volume = | Issue =236 | Date = November 1981 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | Page = }}</ref> Whereas Kirby had intimated that Doom's disfigurement was more a figment of Victor's vain personality, Byrne expressed that Doom's face was truly ravaged; only Doom's own robot slaves are allowed to see the monarch without his helm.<ref name="FF#258"/> Byrne also emphasized other aspects of Doom's personality; despite his ruthless nature, Doom is a man of his word.<ref name=religion>{{cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/lit/comics/DoctorDoom.html |title=The Religious Affiliation of Comic Book Character Victor Von Doom|date=2005-12-10|accessdate=2008-02-12|work=Adherents.com|author=Staff}}</ref> He also genuinely cares for his people of Latveria, who in turn are devoted to their leader; returning to Latveria after being temporarily deposed, Doom abandons a scheme to wrest mystical secrets from [[Doctor Strange]] in order to oversee his land's reconstruction.<ref name="FF#258">{{Cite comic | Cartoonist = [[John Byrne|Byrne, John]]| Story =''Interlude'' | Title = ''Fantastic Four'' | Volume = | Issue =258 | Date = September 1983 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | Page = }}</ref> Though possessing a tempestuous temper, Doom also occasionally shows warmth and empathy to others; he tries to free his mother from [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] and treats [[Kristoff Vernard]] like his own son.<ref name="FF#258"/>Byrne also gave further detail regarding Doom's scarring; Byrne used the idea that the accident at State University only left Doom with a small scar; when Doom puts on the armor forged for him when it had yet to cool, however, he truly damages his face.<ref>{{Cite comic | cartoonist = [[John Byrne|Byrne, John]] | Story =''True Lies'' | Title = ''Fantastic Four'' | Volume = 1 | Issue =278 | year = 1985 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

After Byrne's departure Doctor Doom continued to be a major villain in ''Fantastic Four'', and as the 1980s continued Doom appeared other comics such as ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'', ''[[Punisher]]'', ''[[Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' and ''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]''. In ''Fantastic Four'' #350, writer [[Walt Simonson]] introduced the idea of Doom being on a journey through time and space, only returning to Earth on occasion. Simonson's [[retroactive continuity|retcon]] was done so readers could assume that any of the character's appearances that they found odd were in fact [[Doombots]]. An [[urban legend]] states that Simonson drew up a list of official stories which featured the real Doom and those which did not.<ref>{{cite web | author = Cronin, Brian | title = ''Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed'' #100 | work = [[Comic Book Resources]] | date = 2007-04-26 | url = http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/04/26/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-100/ | accessdate=2008-02-14}}</ref>

===Modern depictions===
In 2003, Doom was the sole villain in the ''Fantastic Four'' story arc "''Unthinkable''", in which Doom imprisons [[Franklin Richards]] in Hell and captures [[Valeria Richards]] before succeeding in fighting the Fantastic Four to a standstill. Writer Mark Waid sought to redefine Doom's character in a way that had not been seen before.<!-- add the interview ref here --> In Waid's reinterpretation, Doom hates Richards for knowing at his core he was right when Doom was wrong.<ref>{{cite web|author=Brady, Matt|date=2003-01-23|url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=1041|title=Waid thinks the Unthinkable|work=[[Newsarama]]|accessdate=2008-02-20}}</ref><ref name="FFManifisto">{{cite book|last=Waid|first=Mark|authorlink=Mark Waid|title=[http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0785114866 ''Fantastic Four Volume One'']|publisher=Marvel Comics|date=2004-08-01|location=New York|pages=''The Fantastic Four Manifesto''|isbn=0785114866}}</ref> Waid was also convinced that the "''truism that Victor Von Doom is, despite his villainy, a noble man''" (as suggested in Byrne's run) "is absolute crap. [...] A man [Doom] whose entire motivating force is jealousy is ridiculously petty, not grandly noble. Yes, Doom is ''regal'', and yes, whenever possible, Doom likes to ''act'' as if he possesses great moral character, because to him that's what great men ''have''... — but when I hear Doom say it 'does not ''suit'' him to' do this-and-such, what I hear is, 'it has nothing to do with my hatred for Reed Richards, so it's not worth my time.'" Waid also stated that Doom "''would tear the head off a newborn baby and eat it like an apple while his mother watched if it would somehow prove he were smarter than Reed.''" <ref name="FFManifisto"/>

In 2005 and 2006, Doom was featured in his own limited series, ''Books of Doom'', a retelling of the origin story by [[Ed Brubaker]].<ref name="books of doom interview">{{cite web|author=Brady, Matt|date=2005-10-27|url=http://www.newsarama.com/marvelnew/Nov_previews/BruDoom.htm|title=Brubaker on ''Books of Doom''|work=[[Newsarama]]|accessdate=2008-02-14}}</ref> In an interview, Brubaker said the series was a way to elaborate on the earlier portions of Doom's life which had not been seen often in the comics. The series also set out to determine if Doom's path from troubled child to dictator was fated or Doom's own faults led to his corruption — in essence, a [[nature versus nurture]] question.<ref>{{cite web|author=Tramountanas, George|date=2005-10-07|title=Brubaker of Deflowering Doom|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=6014|work=[[Comic Book Resources]]|accessdate=2008-02-13}}</ref> Brubaker's version of Doom was heavily influenced by the original Lee/Kirby version; responding to a question if he would show Doom's face, Brubaker stated "''following Kirby's example, I think it's better not to show it.''"<ref name="books of doom interview"/>

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
''Fantastic Four Annual'' #2 established that Doom's mother Cynthia, a [[witch]], was killed by a demon, and his father Werner, a healer, died after being pursued by the Baron of [[Latveria]] because Werner could not save the Baroness from death. The young Victor swears revenge and is raised by his father's friend Boris. He studies his mother's magical artifacts and science, using his skills to swindle the richer Latverians and avoiding soldiers who want to execute him (even using a robotic [[doppelgänger]] to escape a [[Execution by firing squad|firing squad]]). The Dean of [[Empire State University]] in [[United States|America]] offers Doom a scholarship. There Doom meets and grows to loathe [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]].<ref name=origin>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]] | Artist =[[Jack Kirby|Kirby, Jack]] | Story =Origin of Doctor Doom  | Title = Fantastic Four Annual| Volume =  | Issue =2  | Date = 1964 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

Using the scientific apparatus at his disposal, Victor creates a device to communicate with his dead mother. While Richards warns him his calculations are off, Doom spitefully ignores him activates the machine: he is horribly disfigured in the resulting explosion.<ref name=origin/> Refusing to acknowledge his own fault in the matter, Doom blames Richards for the accident, finding it easier to believe that Richards had sabotaged his work out of jealousy than to admit to his own imperfection. Expelled after the accident, Doom travels the world, eventually being found by a clan of monks in [[Tibet]]. Mastering the monk's disciplines, he becomes their master and forges himself a suit of armor, complete with a mask that can only be removed by him. After this, Doom returns to his homeland, overthrowing the standing government, and crowning himself king of Latveria. Ruling with an iron fist and an equally strong will, Doom begins to redirect the small nation's resources to help him realize his goals. He also brings the country a new age of prosperity.<ref name=origin/>

In 1969, Doom's childhood companion Valeria was introduced. It is revealed she and Doom parted ways after he left Latveria to study in America: symbolizing his abandoning of human love and compassion for knowledge and power.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Roy Thomas|Thomas, Roy]] | Artist =[[Larry Lieber|Lieber, Larry]] | Story =This Man, This Demon | Title = [[Marvel Super-Heroes (comics)|Marvel Super-Heroes]] | Volume = 2 | Issue =20  | Date = 1969 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> In 1971, it was established Cynthia von Doom had sold her soul to [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]].<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Gerry Conway|Conway, Gerry]] | Artist =[[Gene Colan|Colan, Gene]] | Story = Title = [[Astonishing Tales]] | Volume = 1 | Issue = 8 | Date = 1971 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> In 1985, [[John Byrne]] gave further detail regarding Doom's scarring. The story uses the idea that the accident at Empire State University only left Doom with a small scar; when Doom puts on the armor forged for him when it had yet to cool, however, he truly damages his face.<ref>{{Cite comic | cartoonist = [[John Byrne|Byrne, John]] | | Story =True Lies | Title = Fantastic Four | Volume = 1 | Issue =278  | Date = 1985 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> [[Ed Brubaker]]'s 2007 ''Books of Doom'' further revealed Doom was sent to learn in America after being drafted by the military to create weapons: after his accident he destroyed all his inventions. He was also pursued by the [[KGB]] before being advised to come to Tibet. The series also confirmed Doom led his people to revolt against the Latverian government.<ref>{{cite web | title = Books of Doom | publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | url = http://www.marvel.com/catalog/?id=5762 | accessdate=2008-02-28}}</ref>

In the 2000s, Doom rediscovered his mystical heritage, using his powers in an attempt to destroy the Fantastic Four after making a deal with a group of demons called the Hazarath Three, but later is consigned to a hell dimension after Richards manages to trick him into rejecting the idea that the demons aided him. He escapes and attempts to claim [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'s mystical hammer [[Mjolnir (Marvel Comics)|Mjolnir]] for himself, after the rift the hammer created as it fell to Earth following the destruction of Asgard allowed him to escape. The plot fails due to his inability to lift the hammer, and Doom returns to Latveria to rule once again.

===[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]===
Later, a Doombot was taken down by Reed Richards, Henry Pym, Iron Man, She-Hulk and others in New York City; whether or not it was sent by Doom himself remains to be seen, as does his role in the overall conflict. Doom was not invited to the wedding of [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] and the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]. However, he did send a present: an invitation to form an alliance with Latveria, using the Civil War currently going on among the hero community as a reason to quite possibly forge an alliance between their two countries. When Black Panther, on a diplomatic mission to other countries with Storm, did show up in Latveria, he presented them with a real present, and extended another invitation to form an alliance with Black Panther. He demonstrated behavior very uncharacteristic of him, however, which may or may not become a plot point later. Panther spurned the invitation, detonating an EMP that blacked out a local portion of Latveria before Doom's robots could destroy his ship. Later on, Doctor Doom is then shown collaborating with the Red Skull on a weapon which will only "be the beginning" of [[Captain America]]'s suffering. Doctor Doom gave the Red Skull the weapon because the Red Skull gave Victor pieces of technology from an old German castle. The castle was owned by a "Baron of Iron" centuries prior, who had used his technological genius to protect himself and his people. The map the Red Skull used to find the castle bore a picture of Doctor Doom. Doctor Doom states that the technology the Red Skull gave him is more advanced than what he currently has, and that he will become the Baron of Iron in his future. The Red Skull is currently in the process of reverse-engineering Doom's weapon for multiple uses, rather than the single use Doom agreed to.

===Post-Civil War events===
At the end of the first chapter of the X-Men event ''[[X-Men: Endangered Species|Endangered Species]]'', Doctor Doom is among the supervillain geniuses that [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] contacts to help him reverse the effects of [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]]. He spurns Beast by stating that genetics do not number among his talents.

In ''[[Spider-Man: One More Day]]'', Doctor Doom was among those that Spider-Man contacts to help save Aunt May.

Doctor Doom also makes Latveria into a refugee camp for the [[Atlantis|Atlanteans]] following the destruction of their underwater kingdom<ref>Sub-Mariner vol. 2, #1-6 (Aug. 2007 - Jan. 2008)</ref> as well as becoming allies with [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] in his plot to manipulate [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] into unwittingly release his Asgardian enemies.<ref>Thor vol. 3, #5</ref>

Doctor Doom later defends Latveria from the [[Mighty Avengers]], following a revelation that it was one of Doctor Doom's satellites that carried the 'Venom Virus' released in New York City.<ref> ''Mighty Avengers'' #8</ref> In a battle with Iron Man and the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]], the time travel mechanism within his armor overloads, trapping Doom and his opponents at some point in the past. Doctor Doom continues a relationship with [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fay]] using his time machine.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #9</ref> He and Iron Man managed to get back to the present, but Doctor Doom has left Iron Man in his exploding castle. Despite this, Doctor Doom ended up incarcerated at [[The Raft (comics)|The Raft]].

===[[Secret Invasion]]===
Doctor Doom was broken out of jail from the New Defenders. He was then captured and used as a powers source.

===[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]===
In the aftermath of the Secret Invasion, Doctor Doom is a member of the Dark Illuminati alongside [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborne]], [[Emma Frost]], Namor, Loki's female form, and [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]. At the end of this meeting, Namor and Doctor Doom are seen having a discussion of their own plans that have all ready been set in motion.<ref>Dark Reign #1</ref>

During this storyline, Doctor Doom will star in his own series called "Doctor Doom and the Masters of Evil."

[[Image:Doomcosmicpower.jpg|185px|thumb|left|Doom steals the [[Silver Surfer]]'s powers]]
Doom's most dangerous weapon is his [[intelligence|intellect]]. A true genius, he is considered to be one of the most intelligent human beings in the Marvel Universe, second only to his arch-nemesis [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]]. He has extensive knowledge of all sciences, and is an expert in robotics, genetic engineering, weapons technology, bio-chemistry, and other fields. Doom is depicted constructing numerous devices in order to defeat his foes or gain more power, including a [[Time travel|time machine]], a device to imbue people with superpowers, and numerous [[robot]]s. Doom's calculating and strategic nature leads him to use "[[Doombot#Robots|Doombots]]," exact mechanical replicas of the real Doctor Doom, for many missions, typically those where he fears defeat.<ref name="FF#258"/> Doom also possesses a limited amount of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] ability. This ability is due to knowledge of the mystic arts learned during his time with Tibetan monks and from his mother. His magical talents are limited by his lack of humility and refusal to admit that he is not a master of all arts. The [[extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[List of Marvel Comics alien races#O|Ovoids]] teach Doom the process of psionically transferring his consciousness into another nearby being, which Doom uses on several occasions, including to escape death at the hands of [[Terrax]].<ref name="FF#258"/> Doom also uses his scientific talents to steal and replicate the power of [[Galactus]]' heralds such as the [[Silver Surfer]] on several occasions.

Doom's armor, originally designed to hide his face from the world, is both menacing and powerful. As a defensive measure, his armor is built to generate a massive [[electric shock]], disabling anyone who might come in contact with Doom.<ref name="FF#40">{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]] | Artist =[[Jack Kirby|Kirby, Jack]] | Story =''The Battle of the Baxter Building!'' | Title = ''Fantastic Four'' | Volume = | Issue =40 | Date = July 1964 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]| Page = }}</ref> The suit is highly resistant to damage, and has the additional defense of a [[Force field (science fiction)|force field]] generated by the armor.<ref name="FF#40"/> The armor's exoskeleton augments Doom's natural physical strength, granting him low level superhuman strength. The armor is self-supporting, equipped with internal stores and [[recycling]] systems for [[Earth's atmosphere|air]], [[food]], [[water]], and [[energy]], allowing the wearer to survive lengthy periods of exposure [[underwater]] or in [[outer space]]. For weapons, Doom utilizes blasts of energy from his gauntlets, as well as some mystical powers like the ability to cast bolts of electric energy.

==Cultural impact==
In the book ''Superhero: The Secret Origin of a Genre'', [[Peter Coogan]] writes that Doctor Doom's appearance was representative of a change in the portrayal of "mad scientists" to full-fledged villains, often with upgraded powers.<ref name="Comics 166">{{cite web|author=[[Peter Sanderson|Sanderson, Peter]]|date=2007-02-24|url=http://www.quickstopentertainment.com/2007/02/24/comics-in-context-166-megahero-vs-megavillain/|title=Comics in Context #166: Megahero Vs. Megavillain|work=QuickStopEntertainment.com|accessdate=2008-02-13}}</ref> Doom is also emblematic of a specific ''subset'' of supervillain, which comic book critic [[Peter Sanderson]] describes as a "mega[[villain]]".<ref name="Comics 166"/> These supervillains are genre-crossing villains who exist in adventures "in a world in which the ordinary laws of nature are slightly suspended"; characters such as [[Professor Moriarty]], [[Count Dracula]], [[Auric Goldfinger]], [[Hannibal Lecter]] and [[Darth Vader]], also fit this description.<ref name="Comics 166"/> Sanderson also found traces of [[William Shakespeare]]’s characters Richard III and Iago in Doctor Doom; all of them "are descended from the 'vice' figure of medieval drama", who address the audience in monologues detailing their thoughts and ambitions.<ref name="Comics 165">{{cite web|author=[[Peter Sanderson|Sanderson, Peter]]|date=2007-02-17|url=http://www.quickstopentertainment.com/2007/02/17/comics-in-context-165-the-supervillain-defined/|title=Comics in Context #165: The Supervillain Defined|work=QuickStopEntertainment.com|accessdate=2008-02-13}}</ref>

Described as "iconic",<ref name="ugo"/> Doom is one of the most well-received super-villains of the Marvel universe, as well as one of the most recurring;<ref name="ugo">{{cite web|url=http://www.ugo.com/a/love-or-hate/?person=doctor-doom|title=Love Him or Hate Him: Doctor Doom|work=[[UGO Networks]]|accessdate=2008-02-10}}</ref> in his constant battles with heroes and other villains, Doom has appeared more times than any other villain.<ref name="greatest villains of the FF"/> The comics site Panels of Awesome ranked Doom as the number one villain in their listing of the top ten villains in comics;<ref>{{cite web|author=Haynes, Mike|url=http://www.panelsofawesome.com/2008/04/22/countdown-top-10-comic-book-villains/|title=Countdown: Top 10 Comic Book Villains|work=Panelsofawesome.com|date=2007-12-10|accessdate=2008-02-12}}</ref> ''Wizard Magazine'' went a step further by declaring Doom the fourth greatest villain of all time.<ref name="Wizard177">{{cite journal | last = McCallum | first = Pat | year = 2006 | month = July | title = 100 Greatest Villains Ever | journal = ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' | issue = 177}}</ref>

''Comic Book Resources'' ranks Doom as their fourth favorite Marvel character. Journalist Brent Ecenbarger cited him being able to "''stand up against entities like [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], the [[Beyonder]], and [[Galactus]] and often come out on top''", as well as the tragedy of any "''other number of circumstances could have led to Doom being a savior, but as it is, instead he remains Marvel’s greatest villain.''" Fellow journalist Jason Stanhope called his "''master[ing] of sorcery and technology an unusual combination''", and also felt "''his inner sense of nobility sets him apart from lesser villains, in a similar manner to [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]].''"<ref>{{cite web | author = Brian Cronin | title = Top 50 Marvel Characters #4 | work = [[Comic Book Resources]] | date = 2007-09-26 | url = http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/09/26/top-50-marvel-characters-4/ | accessdate=2008-02-14}}</ref> Doom has also been favorably regarded by those who wrote for the character; Stan Lee declared Doom his favorite villain, saying "''[Doom] could come to the United States and he could do almost anything, and we could not arrest him because he has [[diplomatic immunity]]. Also, he wants to rule the world and if you think about it, wanting to rule the world is not a crime.''"<ref name="voa q and a">{{cite web|date=2007-08-15|author=Brummett, Erin|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/15-August-2007-Chat-Transcript-Stan-Lee.cfm|title=VOA Online Discussion: Comic Book Heroes|work=[[Voice of America]]|accessdate=2008-02-02}}</ref> [[Mark Waid]] echoed Lee's assessment of the character, stating that Doom "''[has] got a great look, a great visual design [and] a dynamite origin.''"<ref>{{cite web|author=Contino, Jennifer|date=2003-05-29|title=Waid's Fantastic Quartet|url=http://www.comicon.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&f=36&t=001050|work=ComicCon.com|accessdate=2008-02-14}}</ref>
