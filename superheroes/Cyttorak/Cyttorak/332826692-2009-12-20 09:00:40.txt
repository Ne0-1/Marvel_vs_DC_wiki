'''Cyttorak''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. A mystical entity, he is the [[deity]] that powers [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] through the artifact known as [[Crimson Gem of Cyttorak]]. He was created by [[Stan Lee]], [[Jack Kirby]], and [[Alex Toth]]. He was first mentioned in ''Strange Tales I'' #124 (September 1964), a temple molded in his image was seen in ''X-Men I'' #12 (July 1965), and actually appeared in ''Dr. Strange III'' #44 (August 1992).

==Fictional character biography==
Cyttorak existed as a deity (or [[Demons (Marvel Comics)|demon]]) who received worship on Earth until under unknown circumstances he was banished from the Earth. He took up residence in a [[List of Marvel Comics dimensions|dimension]] known as the Crimson Cosmos, where time did not pass. Cyttorak has existed since the time of the ancient sorceress [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fay]] (during the time of the Seventh Century), and has even back then offered his magic to use as worshippers for power, as shown when Morgan utilized the Crimson Bands easily to bind Dr. Strange and Bolar.

Approximately one thousand years ago, a gathering of eight great magical beings took place. These beings -- [[Balthakk]], [[Farallah]], [[Ikonn]], [[Krakkan]], [[Raggadorr]], [[Valtorr]], [[Watoomb]], and Cyttorak -- disagreed as to who had the greatest power. Hence, they settled on the Wager of the [[Octessence]]. Each being created an artifact with a fraction of their respective power, which would transform the first human who made physical contact with it into an Exemplar, a living personification of the power. Using outside agents, to construct temples to house the artifacts, the magical beings planned that the first mortal to find the artifact would trigger a spell that would quickly draw others to the remaining artifacts, creating eight Exemplars. Then would come the Ceremony of the Octessence, where a gathering of the Exemplars would attend the construction of a great magical engine, which would overwhelm the wills of all human beings. After the enslavement of humanity, each Exemplar would rule an eighth of humanity, with subsequently a war between all Exemplars in which only one would be left standing. Cyttorak managed to build a temple in a Southeast Asian country. He had a thrall demon named Xorak protect this temple for him.

At some point in the past, the great adept, the [[Ancient One]], encountered and engaged in battle with Xorak near Cyttorak's temple.

"Centuries ago" (possibly before or after the aforementioned battle between the Ancient One and Xorak), a group of renegade monks tried to summon Cyttorak but instead brought his "most destructive aspect" to Southeast Asia. An adept named Gomurr, who served as the apprentice to "one of the most disreputable conjurers on the continent" opposed this avatar of Cyttorak. Gomurr received the aid of Tar, his friendly rival, as well as an "Initiate of the Ebon Vein." Gomurr and Tar, collaborating, succeeded in forcing this aspect of Cyttorak within the [[Crimson Gem of Cyttorak]]. Tar later attained the title of the "Proctor of the [[Crimson Dawn]]", but Gomurr would later hold this office.

Cyttorak  was last  seen been released from a magical prison by  pete wisdom during the  skrull invasion  of  otherworld.

==Juggernaut==

[[Image:Cyttor3.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Temple of Cyttorak]]During the Korean War, an American soldier named [[Juggernaut (comics)|Cain Marko]] hid in a cave to avoid an attack by the enemy. A fellow soldier, his stepbrother [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]], followed him in to convince him to rejoin the battle and avoid a court-martial (the inevitable result if his actions were to reach the attention of the commanding officers). The learned Xavier recognized that the cave contained the Temple of Cyttorak. Marko saw a ruby, remarking that it appeared to be living. He picked it up, despite Xavier's warning, to read the now famous inscription: "Whosoever touches this gem shall possess the power of the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak! Henceforth, you who read these words, shall become forevermore a human juggernaut!" Cain's transformation began as the Communists' constant shelling of the cave caused it to collapse. Xavier escaped, but Marko survived due to his new-found powers.

Probably the destruction of the Temple of Cyttorak and the subsequent incapacitation of the Juggernaut served to throw a monkey wrench in the Wager. No other Exemplars would appear until years later, after the Juggernaut had clawed his way through the rubble, made his way to America, and battled the X-Men led by Xavier several times. Also, Marko, unlike the other Exemplars when they were created, did not initially lose his will to his power source, but retained his full individuality.

===Infinity War===

In Dr. Strange III #44 (August 1992), an [[Infinity War]] crossover, Doctor Strange travels through the dimensional corridors with Galactus and other allies. One of many anamolies drew them into conflict with Cyttorak.

Juggernaut had been transported to Cyttorak's dimension and awoke to find Doctor Strange helping free him. Strange had summoned Juggernaut due to his ties to Cyttorak. Though low on actual power, Juggernaut promised to try to convince the entity to let them leave.

The two found Cyttorak, who had imprisoned Strange's comrade Nova, forcing her to give him adulation. He intended that Nova would serve as his priestess, as Cytorrak had created ebullient elves to serve as his worshippers. He also intended to press Strange into service as a priest. Strange confronted Cyttorak, informing him of the mission that he and Nova had before they were drawn into the Crimson Cosmos, as well as the crucial nature of that mission. The Juggernaut hid in a corner, recognizing the ruby affixed to Cyttorak’s head. Strange informed Cyttorak as to how he had, by invoking Cyttorak’s name, enhanced Cyttorak’s renown. Cyttorak decided to let Strange leave as long as he continues to invoke him. However, the Juggernaut took Cyttorak by surprise and ripped the Ruby off of his head, and started attacking him, intending that no one could stop him again with Cyttorak neutralized. He continued his attack on Cyttorak until Doctor Strange attempted to stop him, and then attacked Dr. Strange. Although he started to feel a slight vertigo, Marko continued with his plan, but Nova managed to free herself and blast the ruby from Marko’s hand. Strange levitated the ruby away from Marko and onto Cyttorak’s forehead. Cyttorak revived, and revealed that Marko’s plan amounted to pure tom-foolery, as Cyttorak himself served as the ultimate source for the ruby’s power, and thus, Marko’s power. Despite his brief apparent victory over Cyttorak, Marko simply cut off his own power source. Cyttorak went on to say that, despite the Juggernaut’s presumptuous antics, he would allow Marko to continue to wield his power, ostensibly to continue to spread Cyttorak’s fame. Cyttorrak returned all the human beings back to their original locations.

The Juggernaut, having been attacked by [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] earlier, was placed in the Crimson Cosmos. Doctor Strange discovered this. Within the gem, a demoness called Spite showed Marko an illusion where Cain was crippled before he gained the Juggernaut powers, but Gomurr the Ancient freed Marko from this false scenario. Gomurr had Cain relive the latter’s past, as a delinquent child and his causing the accident that killed his father, Dr. Kurt Marko. Spite, however, again projected to the Juggernaut illusions to persuade him to stay in the Crimson Cosmos. Spite, however, had simply manipulated Marko. Cyttorak desired to inhabit Cain's body and leave his dimension. Cyttorak and Cain battled each other. Cyttorak brutalized Cain severely, but Cain chose not to surrender. Gomurr and his friend Tar arranged things so that Juggernaut could now utilize Cyttorak's power against him. Cain defeated Cyttorak and exited the Crimson Cosmos with more vitality than before.

When certain charlatans had attempted to steal the Juggernaut’s power by using a false second gem of Cyttorak, the Juggernaut attempted to reabsorb his power from this second gem. However, he somehow was possessed by Cyttorak in the process. A being named Ejulp, dispatched by Juggernaut's confederate [[Black Tom Cassidy|Black Tom]], teleported the X-Men to aid the Juggernaut. Juggernaut's power was so heightened that he began shearing through dimensional boundaries. In this dimension, when Professor X and [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] made physical contact with each other, Xavier merged into Logan’s body. [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] and [[Shadowcat|Kitty Pryde]] returned to find a larger Juggernaut tearing through a dimensional wall. When Wolverine leaped into the mouthpiece of Juggernaut's headpiece, Logan and Xavier separated from one another. They found an entity pretending to be Cain Marko, but discovered the real Cain Marko hiding under the staircase. Xavier attempted to restore Cain's self-respect. The false Juggernaut happened upon them, but, upon this duplicate making contact with the true Cain Marko, Marko had his Juggernaut power returned to him and vanquished the entity controlling his mind. The Juggernaut started to feel his powers mysteriously increasing, and felt an irresistible urge to go somewhere. He easily shrugged off an attack by [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], but Thor persisted with the struggle.

Observing this elsewhere, [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] enquired of the Flame of Truth about the Juggernaut. The flame recalled to Loki how Cyttorak empowered Marko, to which Loki responded that he had not heard the name of Cyttorak mentioned for quite some time. The Flame further informed Loki that not only did Cyttorak and his confederates have human followers, but that across the Earth humans had recently begun to receive psychic calls drawing them to artifacts of these entities to become Exemplars. Two of these exemplars, Bedlam and Conquest, arrived to aid the Juggernaut in his battle against Thor. They teleported the Juggernaut away.

An Exemplar machine under the [[Daily Bugle]] was noted and destroyed by [[Spider-Man]], [[Iron Man]], Thor and the astral form of [[Professor X]]avier. The Exemplars moved to the North Pole to construct a new device.

The entities behind the Wager of the Octessence decided to implement the creation of the seven other Exemplars, and the Juggernaut once again was caught in Cyttorak’s machinations, as Cyttorak tormented him in his mind. At the North Pole, Thor, Iron Man, Spider-Man, and Xavier were trapped. Xaiver telepathically helps Marko resist. Marko decides, of his own free will to oppose the Octessence scheme. He subdues Bedlam and damages the engine. The heroes are freed and assist Marko in battling the others. Marko ultimately destroys the engine and the Exemplars are ejected to the far corners of the earth. As vengeance for opposing his will, Cyttorak causes the Juggernaut's powers to slowly fade.

Cyttorak granted the power and form of the Juggernaut to an unnamed youth, whom Cain knew. This child had attracted the attention of the X-Men by torturing animals. This new Juggernaut attacked Cain while he and the She-Hulk were enjoying the afterglow of sexual intercourse. Marko, who had only half of his original power fought with his brains instead of his brawn. Recognizing the kid, Cain thought of the Juggernaut persona as "an angry kid in a muscle suit."

In the She-Hulk series, it is shown that a piece of one of his gems was used to create a new creature from [[Man-Elephant]] calling itself Behemoth.

==Powers and abilities==
Cytorrak exists as a deity with enormous magical power. He has provided power to the titanic Juggernaut through an enchanted ruby, as well as provide indestructible bands (the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak) to [[Doctor Strange]] to use as a shield or to restrain enemies. In regards to the ruby, it has withstood being thrown into orbit by the Juggernaut, as well as re-entry when it was bumped out of orbit by Nova.


Stevie, a spoiled little boy from the Midwest, managed to use the Cyttorak Ruby to spectacular effects unimagined by [[Juggernaut (comics)|Cain Marko]], starting with using it to blast Marko. He used it to monitor events far away with his computer (presumably he utilized the ruby to enable him to access the feed of security cameras) as well as using the ruby to relay a message to the East Coast using a non-operational computer on the West Coast. Furthermore, he could alter mirrors so that the original Human Torch's flame was reflected and enhanced back against him. Even stranger, Stevie could animate inanimate objects, which could also turn intangible. These objects included wax statues, some which resembled monsters, others that resembled [[Spider-Man]], [[Doctor Doom]], [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], etc. However, the animated statues tended only to have diluted copies of the original’s abilities, and tended to move slowly.

As well, Cyttorak has demonstrated the ability to create life (''Dr. Strange'' (vol.3) #44), when he created an entire race of elves out of magical energy simply so he could have somebody to worship and adore him.
