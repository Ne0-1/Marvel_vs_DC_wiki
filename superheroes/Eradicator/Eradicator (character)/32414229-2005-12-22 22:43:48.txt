In the [[DC Comics]] universe, the '''Eradicator''' is a 200,000 year old [[artifact]] and [[weapon]]. It first appeared in ''[[Action Comics|Action Comics Annual]]'' #2 ([[1989]]).

{{spoiler}}

In the distant past, a dying [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] race created a number of devices to preserve their culture, and sent them into space, where they would encounter other civilization and link their colonies. When a small group of these aliens arrived on [[Krypton (planet)|Krypton]], a militaristic faction, led by Kem-L, killed them and corrupted one of their devices to preserve his ideal of Kryptonian culture; the device would eradicate alien influences, and hence he called it the "Eradicator."

One of the surviving aliens, ''[[Cleric (comics)|the Cleric]]'', took the Eradicator and a group of followers and left Krypton. Unfortunately, his followers died shortly after leaving; Kryptonians have a genetic link to their planet, and will die if they leave it.

The Cleric kept the Eradicator for 200,000 years, until he encounters [[Superman]] on [[Warworld]]. With the device, the two exchange memories, and the Cleric has a vision of Superman's death at the hands of [[Mongul]]. The Cleric wishes to prevent this from happening, and the Eradicator transports them to his asteroid. He notices that the device has changed to protect Krypton's sole survivor, and they use it to heal their wounds, physical and spiritual. When the Cleric gives the Eradicator to Superman to take care of, the old alien passes away.

Back on Earth, the Eradicator caused a number of bizarre events, including altering [[Jimmy Olsen]] into a malleable form, causing him extreme pain in the process. Superman threw the device into [[Antarctica]], where it altered the ice to create the [[Fortress of Solitude]], and possesses two scientists to create a portal to the [[Phantom Zone]], where it draws Kryptonian artifacts to the Fortress.

When Superman recovers the Eradicator, he learns that one of his ancestors, Kem-L, created it to prevent aliens from influencing Krypton's culture. It tries to turn Earth into a new Krypton, and erases Superman's memory of the device when he tries to interfere.

[[Professor Emil Hamilton]] (who had previously examined the Eradicator) restores Superman's memory, and he goes into the Phantom Zone to stop the device. He encounters a projection of Kem-L and learns that only the House of El can control the Eradicator, but he must first undergo a [[rite of passage]]. When he completes it, he commands the Eradicator to shut down, and it complies.

In the ''Day of the Krypton Man'' arc, the Eradicator altered Superman's psyche, turning him into the ideal Kryptonian and alienating his closest friends. He nearly kills [[Draaga]], and when he tries to kill [[Jonathan Kent|Jonathan]] and [[Martha Kent]], he breaks the programming, fights the Eradicator, and throws it into the [[Sun]].

The Eradicator returned in ''Superman: The Man of Steel'' #1 as an energy being. It tried to turn the Sun into a [[red dwarf]] (the type of [[star]] that Krypton [[orbit]]ed), but Superman stopped it, with help from Professor Hamilton.

The Eradicator returned again in ''Action Comics'' #687, part of the ''Reign of the Supermen'' story arc, as "the Last Son of Krypton." As a humanoid, the Eradicator joined forces with Superman to fight [[Cyborg Superman|the Cyborg]] and stop him from destroying [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]].  It was seemingly killed in an attempt to shield Superman from a lethal blast of Kryptonite-based fuel, fully recharging the Man of Steel's powers in the process.  

Following the return of Superman, the Eradicator's apparently dead body was examined at [[S.T.A.R. Labs]], and merged with Dr. David Connor. The merged Eradicator joined the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]], and occasionally teamed up with Superman. In a [[1996]] three-part [[miniseries]], the Eradicator dealt with Dr. Connor's personal life, and more of the device's history was revealed, some of which is hard to reconcile with the history from the annual.

Most recently the Eradicator has returned to his near original state of being however his new costume resembles an amalgam of his first appearance and that of Superman's. In Superman 220, released in August 2005, the Eradictor was seriously injured by an [[OMAC]]. At the end of the issue, his fate remained unknown.
