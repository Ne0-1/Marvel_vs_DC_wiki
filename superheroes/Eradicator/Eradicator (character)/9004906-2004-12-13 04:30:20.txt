In the [[DC Comics]] universe, the '''Eradicator''' is a 200,000 year old [[artifact]] and [[weapon]]. It first appeared in ''[[Action Comics Annual]]'' #2 ([[1989]]).

{{spoiler}}

In the distant past, a dying [[alien]] race created a number of devices to preserve their culture, and sent them into space, where they would encounter other civilization and link their colonies. When a small group of these aliens arrived on [[Krypton]], a militaristic faction, led by Kem-L, killed them and corrupted one of their devices to preserve his ideal of Kryptonian culture; the device would eradicate alien influences, and hence he called it the "Eradicator."

One of the surviving aliens, ''the Cleric'', took the Eradicator and a group of followers and left Krypton. Unfortunately, his followers died shortly after leaving; Kryptonians have a genetic link to their planet, and will die if they leave it.

The Cleric kept the Eradicator for 200,000 years, until he encounters [[Superman]] on Warworld. With the device, the two exchange memories, and the Cleric has a vision of Superman's death at the hands of Mongul. The Cleric wishes to prevent this from happening, and the Eradicator transports them to his asteroid. He notices that the device has changed to protect Krypton's sole survivor, and they use it to heal their wounds, physical and spiritual. When the Cleric gives the Eradicator to Superman to take care of, the old alien passes away.

Back on Earth, the Eradicator caused a number of bizarre events, including altering Jimmy Olsen into a malleable form, causing him extreme pain in the process. Superman threw the device into [[Antarctica]], where it altered the ice to create the Fortress of Solitude, and possesses two scientists to create a portal to the Phantom Zone, where it draws Kryptonian artifacts to the Fortress.

When Superman recovers the Eradicator, he learns that one of his ancestors, Kem-L, created it to prevent aliens from influencing Krypton's culture. It tries to turn Earth into a new Krypton, and erases Superman's memory of the device when he tries to interfere.

Professor Hamilton (who had previously examined the Eradicator) resotres Superman's memory, and he goes into the Phantom Zone to stop the device. He encounters a projection of Kem-L and learns that only the House of El can control the Eradicator, but he must first undergo a [[rite of passage]]. When he completes it, he commands the Eradicator to shut down, and it complies.

In the ''Day of the Krypton Man'' arc, the Eradicator altered Superman's psyche, turning him into the ideal Kryptonian and alienating his closest friends. He nearly kills Draaga, and when he tries to kill Ma and Pa Kent, he breaks the programming, fights the Eradicator, and throws it into the Sun.

The Eradicator returned in ''Superman: the Man of Steel'' #1 as an energy being. It tried to turn the Sun into a red dwarf (the type of star that Krypton orbited), but Superman stopped it, with help from Professor Hamilton.

The Eradicator returned again in ''Action Comics'' #687, part of the ''Reign of the Supermen'' story arc, as "the Last Son of Krypton." As a humanoid, the Eradicator joined forces with Superman to fight the Cyborg and stop him from destroying Metropolis.

Following the return of Superman, the Eradicator's apparently dead body is examined at S.T.A.R. Labs, and merges with Dr. David Connor. The merged Eradicator joins the Outsiders, and occasionally teams up with Superman. In a [[1996]] three-part miniseries, the Eradicator deals with Dr. Connor's personal life, and more of the device's history is revealed, some of which is hard to reconcile with the history from the annual.
