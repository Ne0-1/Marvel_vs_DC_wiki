==Fictional character biography==
In the distant past, a dying [[extraterrestrial life|alien]] race creates a number of containment devices in which to preserve their culture. They send them into space with contact teams, intent on meeting other civilizations. When a small group of these aliens arrive on the planet Krypton, they are met by the militant Kem-L, who kills them and corrupts one of the devices. Its new mission is to preserve his ideal of Kryptonian culture by eradicating all others — and thus the device becomes known as the "Eradicator."<ref name="dc-ency"/>

In its original form, the Eradicator resembles a stylized small rocket. Its top section is a [[prolate spheroid]], which exudes a blue glow and is approximately three times the size of an egg. This is connected via four thin mount brackets to a glossy orange tail fin section of equal length. The ten equally spaced fins each have the shape of a pointed quarter ellipse, with the tapered end extending slightly beyond the rear of the squat main cylindrical body tube.

On Krypton, the Eradicator does all that it could over the years to protect Kryptonians, even from themselves. When a group of Kryptonian explorers leave Krypton in search of a new planet to colonize, the Eradicator alters their birthing matrices and makes them fatally allergic to lead, thus creating [[Daxamites]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} To further ensure that nobody left Krypton, the Eradicator alters Kryptonians by encoding in them a genetic defect so that they will instantly perish if they leave their world.

One of the surviving aliens, known as the Cleric, takes the Eradicator and leaves Krypton with a group of followers. Unfortunately, they die soon thereafter, as the Kryptonian genetic link to their home planet precludes their survival off-world. The Cleric keeps the Eradicator for 200,000 years, until he encounters Superman on [[Warworld]], Superman currently in self-imposed exile from Earth due to his guilt over executing three Kryptonians from a pocket universe.<ref name="actionannual2" /> With the device, the two exchange memories- which explains that Kal-El was able to leave Krypton thanks to genetic treatments his father had undergone to cure his DNA of the Eradicator's defect- and the Cleric has a vision of Superman in combat with [[Mongul]]. The Cleric wishes to save Superman's life, and the Eradicator transports Superman to the Cleric's asteroid.<ref name="superman32">{{Cite comic

The Eradicator later alters Superman's psyche, turning him into the ideal Kryptonian and alienating his closest friends.

During this time, due to its enhanced senses, the Eradicator has to wear a special visor designed to cut down visible light, since its eyes are particularly sensitive to it; the Eradicator, unlike the real Superman, does not possess heat vision, although he can generate energy blasts from his hands. Also, he cannot absorb yellow sunlight directly, instead tapping into Superman's reserves and using him as a conduit for solar radiation.

However, Doomslayer absorbs his energies and rips his body apart, killing him.<ref>''Action Comics'' #901</ref> Eradicator is later revealed to have transferred his program into the body of Doomsday, who had been rendered comatose by Doomslayer. As Eradicator helps to battle the Doomsday clones that Doomslayer sent around the world, he notes that Doomsday's mind is beginning to awaken.<ref>''Action Comics'' #903</ref>
In the final battle, Eradicator and the heroes defeat the Doomsday clones and throw them back into the pit the Tower is located in, since the Tower wills teleport things that are close to it. Eradicator arrives and helps Superman fight Doomslayer, and as he tells Superman that it was an honor to fight alongside him, Eradicator throws him out of the Tower, allowing himself to be trapped and teleported away.<ref>''Action Comics'' #904</ref>

==Other versions==
In a 2001–2002 storyline, Superman visited a [[Krypton (comics)#Revisiting Krypton|version of Krypton]] which resembles the [[Krypton (comics)#Silver Age Krypton|Silver Age version]] of the planet.  However, unlike the Silver Age incarnation of the planet, this version includes "Eradicator assassins", giant robots used by [[General Zod#"Return to Krypton" Zod|General Zod]] and the Science Council as part of "the Eradicator solution", and later by Jor-El against Kryptonian religious zealots.<ref name="adventures589">{{Cite comic

The Eradicator's body is created from the genetic template of Superman's when the latter dies at the hands of Doomsday, giving the Eradicator physiology similar to a Kryptonian's (and to Superman's in particular). As a result, the Eradicator possesses similar powers to that of Superman, such as incredible strength, speed, invulnerability, and flight. He also possesses ultra-acute senses but to a limited degree. Being a program from Krypton, the Eradicator possesses extensive knowledge of Krypton and is extremely intelligent, as well as having the ability to compute and process information at incredible speed. After his adoption of a Superman-derived body, he retains at least some of Superman's memories, as described above. 

Eradicator has abilities to absorb, convert, and release various forms of energy greater than those of natural Kryptonians, typically projecting energy as powerful blasts from his hands or eyes. He was able to survive exposure to massive amounts of [[kryptonite]] radiation. After the Eradicator and [[Mr. Majestic]] fought, Mr. Majestic altered the Eradicator's programming to make him more aware. The full extent of his programming alteration is unclear, although it has been shown that he can sense beings and gateways from alternate realities such as [[Bleed (comics)|the Bleed]].

==In other media==

British radio producer [[Dirk Maggs]] produced a Superman radio series for [[BBC Radio 5 (former)|BBC Radio 5]] in the 1990s. When the "Death of Superman" story arc happened in the comics, Maggs presented a very faithful, though much pared down version of the tale, which featured [[Stuart Milligan]] as Clark Kent/Superman, [[Lorelei King]] as Lois Lane, and [[William Hootkins]] as Lex Luthor. In the death-and-rebirth storyline, Milligan was double-cast as the Eradicator. The story arc was packaged for sale on cassette and CD as ''[[Superman: Doomsday and Beyond]]'' in the UK and as ''[[Superman Lives!]]'' in the USA.

Eradicator is a playable character along with the other Supermen in ''[[The Death and Return of Superman]]'' video game for [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] and [[Sega Mega Drive|Sega Genesis]].

The Eradicator was in [[Kevin Smith]]'s script for ''[[Superman in film#Superman Lives|Superman Lives]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Kevin |authorlink=Kevin Smith |title=Superman Lives |url=http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/superman-lives-script.html |date=March 27, 1997 |publisher=Drew's Script-O-Rama |accessdate=August 14, 2009}}</ref>

In both ''[[Smallville]]'' and ''[[Superman The Animated Series]]'' (as well as the extended 'DCAU'), elements of the Eradicator's origin seem to have been incorporated into their respective versions of [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]]. The Smallville version in particular, including the origin of being originally a beneficial program before being corrupted by a militant Kryptonian (in this case, [[General Zod]]), and is responsible for Krypton's destruction by Zod's orders.

In the animated film ''[[Superman: Doomsday]]'', which was based on ''[[The Death of Superman|The Death and Return of Superman]]'', the Eradicator does not appear, but elements of his character are incorporated into the cloned Superman, and a [[Superman Robot|robot butler]] in the Fortress of Solitude fulfills some of the Eradicator's plot functions.<ref>{{cite web |last=Cornelius |first=David |title=Superman - Doomsday |url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/30604/superman-doomsday/ |date=September 18, 2007 |work=[[DVD Talk]] |accessdate=August 14, 2009}}</ref>

===Superman X===
In season two of the ''[[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)|Legion of Super Heroes]]'' cartoon, '''Superman X''' (voiced by [[Yuri Lowenthal]], who also voiced Superman) is introduced with several similarities to the Eradicator in its humanoid form; is a physical replica of Superman, he is created as a living weapon, possesses powers similar to Superman's as well as additional energy-based powers and resistance to Kryptonite, has a ruthless and cold-blooded attitude which is tempered over time, and wears a costume with similarities to that worn by the Eradicator following [[The Death of Superman]]<ref>''Action Comics'' #687</ref> Superman X also has aspects similar to [[Kal-El|Superman (Kal-El)]], and [[Mon-El]]. His own name is "'''Kell-El'''".
