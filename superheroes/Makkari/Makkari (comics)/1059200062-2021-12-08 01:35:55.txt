The character is depicted as a member of the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]], a race of [[superhumans]] in the [[Marvel Universe]]. He first appeared in the 1976–78 [[comic book]] series ''The Eternals'', where the name was spelled '''Makarri'''. He was also a member of the [[First Line (comics)|First Line]] and [[Monster Hunters]].

[[Lauren Ridloff]] portrays a deaf female version of Makkari in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], debuting in ''[[Eternals (film)|Eternals]]'' (2021).

==Publication history==
Originally, Makkari was a character in [[Jack Kirby]]'s ''[[Eternals (comics)|The Eternals]]''. [[Mark Gruenwald]] later reintroduced Makkari as a long-running supporting character in the ''[[Quasar (Wendell Vaughn)|Quasar]]'' series.

Hurricane reappears as a member of the [[Monster Hunters]] in ''Marvel Universe'' #4 (September 1998),<ref>''Marvel Universe'' #4 (Sept. 1998)</ref> in a story set in the 1950s. By the end of this three-issue story, it turns out the monsters they are hunting are actually [[Deviant (comics)|Deviants]] and Hurricane is [[retcon|revealed]] to be Makkari.<ref>''Marvel Universe'' #7 (Dec. 1998)</ref>

Marvel Comics continuity was later [[retcon]]ned so that the character presented as the [[mythological]] [[god (male deity)|god]] [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], introduced in ''[[Red Raven Comics]]'' #1 (August 1940; "Mercury In the 20th Century" by artist Kirby and writer Martin A. Bursten, [[pen name]] "Burstein"), was, in fact, Makkari.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Benton |first1=Mike |title=Superhero Comics of the Golden Age: The Illustrated History |date=1992 |publisher=Taylor Publishing Company |location=Dallas |isbn=0-87833-808-X |url=https://archive.org/details/superherocomicso0000bent/page/178 |access-date=8 April 2020 |page=179}}</ref> Mercury was only seen in that single story, in which he worked to thwart the machinations of [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nevins |first1=Jess |title=Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes |date=2013 |publisher=High Rock Press |isbn=978-1-61318-023-5 |page=179}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Makkari is the son of Verona and Mara, born in [[Olympia (comics)|Olympia]], capital city of the Eternals of Earth. He is a member of the Eternals' Technologist's Guild and is skilled at designing and building high-speed vehicles. Makkari has involved himself in [[Earth]]'s affairs more often than most Eternals.

Makkari accompanied [[Thena]] to New York City to help rescue [[Sersi]] and repulse the [[Deviant (comics)|Deviant]] invasion. He was with the Eternals who introduced themselves to the students at City College during the Fourth Host of the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]].<ref>''The Eternals'' #5-6</ref> He then returned to Olympia with [[Ikaris]] and [[Margo Damian]], where he encountered [[Sprite (Eternal)|Sprite]].<ref>''The Eternals'' #9</ref> He also participated in the [[Uni-Mind]] ritual.<ref>''The Eternals'' #11-13</ref> Alongside Ikaris and Sersi, he battled the [[Hulk Robot|Hulk robot]].<ref>''The Eternals'' #14-15</ref> Makkari then battled Ikaris, who was under the mental influence of [[Dromedan]].<ref>''The Eternals'' #16</ref>

Makkari later battled [[Hermes (Marvel Comics)|Hermes]] of [[Olympus (Marvel Comics)|Olympus]].<ref>''Thor'' #291</ref> He battled [[Maelstrom (comics)|Maelstrom]] alongside the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].

Makkari was later rescued by [[Quasar (Wendell Vaughn)|Quasar]] when he began running rampant, literally.<ref>''Quasar'' #11</ref> He revealed that he had traded his other Eternal abilities for greater speed and endurance. He became friends with Quasar when he enlisted Quasar to go to Lemuria to help him save Master Elo, who was tutoring Makkari in how to channel his cosmic energy into more speed.<ref>''Quasar'' #12</ref> He then accompanied Quasar to the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]]'s laboratory world. There, he encountered the [[Star-Dancer]], and battled Trikon and the [[Whizzer (comics)#Stanley Stewart|Whizzer]].<ref name="Quasar #17">''Quasar'' #17</ref> Makkari later worked in Quasar's office under the alias "Mike Khary." He participated in a marathon to the Moon sponsored by the [[Runner (comics)|Runner]], one of the [[Elders of the Universe]], and nearly won; he bested [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], [[Monica Rambeau|Captain Marvel]], [[Whizzer (comics)|Whizzer]], [[Speed Demon (comics)|Speed Demon]], [[Black Racer (Marvel Comics)|Black Racer]], and [[Super Sabre (comics)|Super Sabre]], only to lose the race in the last moments by an amnesiac, dimensions-spanning human being.<ref name="Quasar #17"/> Makkari then became Quasar's roommate.<ref>''Quasar'' #19</ref> He was killed when his heart was stopped by Maelstrom,<ref>''Quasar'' #21</ref> but returned to life,<ref>''Quasar'' #25</ref> as part of an agreement struck between [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]], [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]], [[Infinity (Marvel Comics)|Infinity]] and [[Oblivion (comics)|Oblivion]]. [[Maelstrom (comics)|Maelstrom]] later attempted to seize more power by draining the kinetic energy from Makkari, but Maelstrom was ultimately defeated by the other Eternals.{{Issue|date=August 2010}} However, he soon found he had become so fast that he could no longer move in synch with the rest of the universe.<ref>''Quasar'' #58</ref>

In the 2006 ''Eternals'' limited series, the Eternals are the victims of memory and reality manipulation by Sprite, and have thus forgotten their true identities. Makkari believes himself to be a medicine student named Mark Curry, and is the first Eternal shown in the series. He meets Ikaris, and causes his capture by the [[Deviant (comics)|Deviants]].{{issue|date=March 2013}} By issues #2 and #3, he finally begins to experience his powers of super-speed, and uses it to stop terrorists attacking a party. However, after telling him what has happened Sprite tricks Curry into opening a passageway to the long-dormant Celestial underneath San Francisco, and in doing so incapacitates Curry. During this time the [[Dreaming Celestial]] and Makkari began to talk in his dreams, firstly in the form of Sersi, and told him that it personally made him. By the end of the series he has become the Dreaming Celestial's [[prophet]].<ref>''Eternals'' vol. 3 #1-7. (2006) Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later when the Celestials' Final Host arrived on Earth, Makkari along with all the Eternals killed themselves after realizing the true purpose for which they were created.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 8 #4</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Makkari is a member of the race of superhumans known as [[Eternal (comics)|Eternals]]. He possesses superhuman strength, speed, and reflexes. He can create cyclones by running in circles, and can run up walls and across water. Makkari's body eventually accumulates fatigue poisons and is susceptible to injury.

Although in most of his appearances Makkari has the typical powers of an Eternal, his obsession with speed, starting in the [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]] series, causes him to focus most of his body's Cosmic Energy into enhancing his running speed. As a result, he lost his ability to fly and many of his other powers have been weakened in the process. Makkari possesses none of the psionic powers of the average Eternal (levitation, ocular force projection, and molecular rearrangement), having purposefully readapted all his specialized cell enclaves to speed and running-related attributes. At present, he can run at near [[light speed]] for extended periods, but his physical strength (while still far greater than human) has been reduced by half, and he seemingly cannot project energy or manipulate matter.

Makkari sometimes wears a protective crash helmet, though he does not truly need it. He wears synthetic stretch fabric, specially treated to resist the rigors of high velocity movement.

Makkari has great mechanical aptitude, and the ability to pilot most land and air vehicles. He has moderate experience at hand-to-hand combat; his fighting style incorporates his superhuman speed. He has finished the standard Eternal higher education, and underwent special tutoring in the applications of speed.
