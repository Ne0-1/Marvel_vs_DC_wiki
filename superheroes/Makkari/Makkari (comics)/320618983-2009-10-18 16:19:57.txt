'''Makkari''', formerly known as '''[[Hurricane (comics)|Hurricane]]''' and '''[[Mercury (comics)|Mercury]]''', is a member of the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]], a [[fictional character|fictional]] race of [[superhumans]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel universe|universe]]. He was created by [[writer]]-[[artist]] [[Jack Kirby]] in the 1976-1978 [[comic book]] series ''The Eternals'', where the name was spelled '''Makarri'''.

[[Marvel Comics]] continuity was later [[retcon]]ned so that the character presented as the [[mythological]] [[god (male deity)|god]] [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], introduced as a Marvel protagonist in ''[[Red Raven|Red Raven Comics]]'' #1 (Aug. 1940; "Mercury In the 20th Century" by artist Kirby and writer Martin A. Bursten, [[pen name]] "Burstein") was, in fact, Makkari.

==Publication history==
Originally, Makkari was a relatively minor character in Jack Kirby's ''The Eternals''. [[Mark Gruenwald]] later reintroduced Makkari as a long-running supporting character in the ''[[Quasar (Wendell Vaughn)|Quasar]]'' series.

Hurricane reappears as a member of the [[Monster Hunters]] in ''[[Marvel Universe (comic book)|Marvel Universe]]'' #4,<ref>''Marvel Universe'' #4 (September 1998)</ref> in a story set in the 1950s. By the end of this three-issue story, it turns out the monsters they are hunting are actually [[Deviant (comics)|Deviants]] and Hurricane is [[retcon|revealed]] to be Makkari.<ref>''Marvel Universe'' #7 (December 1998)</ref>

Makkari is featured as one of the the main character in the Marvel [[limited series]] ''Eternals'' (vol. 3), written by [[Neil Gaiman]] and penciled by artist [[John Romita, Jr.]].

==Fictional character biography==
Makkari is the son of Verona and Mara, born in [[Olympia (comics)|Olympia]], capital city of the Eternals of Earth. He is a member of the Eternals' Technologist's Guild and is skilled at designing and building high-speed vehicles.

Makkari has involved himself in [[Earth]]'s affairs more often than most Eternals. Under the name [[Thoth]], he taught writing to the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]]. He was taught [[philosophy]] by [[Plato]]. He rescued [[Sersi]] from "[[Nero]]'s [[Great Fire of Rome|big bonfire]]"; and spent some time as the [[charioteer]] of [[Darius I of Persia]]. He witnessed the [[Trojan War]], the reign of [[Vlad the Impaler]], and the [[Battle of the Alamo|Alamo]].

In the 1940s he worked on Earth, per [[Zuras]]' request, under the aliases "Hurricane" and "Mercury" (an example of [[retcon]], these [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] characters were not originally supposed to be related), and fought Warlord [[Kro (comics)|Kro]] and [[Deviant (comics)|Deviant]] Mutates alongside the [[Monster Hunters]], a team he formed using his identity as National Security Agent Jake Curtiss. Later on, he taught [[Elvis Presley]] a few guitar tricks.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Following the disbanding of the Monster Hunters, Makkari was convinced by [[Pixie (eternal)|Pixie]] to join the [[First Line (comics)|First Line]] as "Major Mercury".{{Issue|date=April 2009}} He and First Line fought against the original Skrull invasion of Earth, and, along with Yeti and Pixie, was one of the few members of First Line to survive the conflict.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Makkari accompanied [[Thena]] to New York City to help rescue [[Sersi]] and repulse the [[Deviant (comics)|Deviant]] invasion. He was with the Eternals who introduced themselves to the students at City College during the Fourth Host of the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]].<ref>''Eternals'' Vol. 1 #5-6</ref> He then returned to Olympia with [[Ikaris]] and [[Margo Damian]], where he encountered [[Sprite (Eternal)|Sprite]].<ref>''Eternals'' Vol. 1 #9</ref> He also participated in the [[Uni-Mind]] ritual.<ref>''Eternals'' Vol. 1 #11-13</ref> Alongside Ikaris and Sersi, he battled the [[Hulk Robot|Hulk robot]].<ref>''Eternals'' Vol. 1 #14-15</ref> Makkari then battled Ikaris, who was under the mental influence of [[Dromedan]].<ref>''Eternals'' Vol. 1 #16</ref>

Makkari later battled [[Hermes (Marvel Comics)|Hermes]] of [[Olympus (Marvel Comics)|Olympus]].<ref>''Thor'' #291</ref> Makkari battled [[Maelstrom (comics)|Maelstrom]] alongside the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. Makkari elected to remain while the majority of Eternals departed Earth.<ref>''Avengers'' #247-248</ref>

Makkari accompanied [[Ikaris]] on his mission to assemble the Eternals to wage war against the Deviants.<ref>''Eternals'' Vol. 2 #3-4</ref> Makkari then encountered Lord [[Ghaur]].<ref>''Eternals'' Vol. 2 #7</ref> Makkari accompanied the other Eternals to [[Lemuria (comics)|Lemuria]] to battle the Deviants.<ref>''Eternals'' Vol. 2 #10</ref> Makkari battled Ghaur alongside the Eternals, [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], and the [[West Coast Avengers]], and participated in the defeat of Ghaur.<ref>''Eternals'' Vol. 2 #12</ref>

Some time later, alongside the Eternals, Makkari fought the [[Super-Skrull]], and encountered the [[Silver Surfer]].<ref>''Silver Surfer Annual'' #1</ref>

Makkari was later rescued by [[Quasar (Wendell Vaughn)|Quasar]] when he began running rampant, literally.<ref>''Quasar'' #11</ref> He revealed that he had traded his other Eternal abilities for greater speed and endurance. He became friends with Quasar when he enlisted Quasar to go to Lemuria to help him save [[Master Elo]], who was tutoring Makkari in how to channel his cosmic energy into more speed.<ref>''Quasar'' #12</ref> He then accompanied Quasar to the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]]'s laboratory world. There, he encountered the [[Star-Dancer]], and battled Trikon, the [[Whizzer (comics)#Stanley Stewart|Whizzer]], and [[Gorr (comics)|Gorr]].<ref name="Quasar #17">''Quasar'' #17</ref> Makkari later worked in Quasar's office under the alias "Mike Khary."  He participated in a marathon to the Moon sponsored by the [[Runner (comics)|Runner]], one of the [[Elders of the Universe]], and nearly won; he bested [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], [[Monica Rambeau|Captain Marvel]], [[Whizzer (comics)|Whizzer]], [[Speed Demon (comics)|Speed Demon]], [[Black Racer (comics)|Black Racer]], and [[Super Sabre (comics)|Super Sabre]], only to lose the race in the last moments by an amnesiac, dimensions-spanning human being (who was actually a thinly-disguised [[Barry Allen]]; the issue was actually an homage to the legendary [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] from the [[DC Comics]] universe<ref>[http://www.hyperborea.org/flash/quasar.html Quasar: Reborn to Run (Fast Forward)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>.<ref name="Quasar #17"/> Makkari then became Quasar's roommate.<ref>''Quasar'' #19</ref> He was killed when his heart was stopped by Maelstrom,<ref>''Quasar'' #21</ref> but returned to life,<ref>''Quasar'' #25</ref> as part of an agreement struck between [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]], [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]], [[Infinity (Marvel Comics)|Infinity]] and [[Oblivion (comics)|Oblivion]]. However, he soon found he had become so fast that he could no longer move in synch with the rest of the universe.  [[Maelstrom (comics)|Maelstrom]] later attempted to seize more power by draining the kinetic energy from Makkari, but Maelstrom was ultimately defeated by the other Eternals.

In the recent ''Eternals'' limited series, the Eternals are the victims of memory and reality manipulation by Sprite, and have thus forgotten their true identities.  Makkari believes himself to be a medicine student named Mark Curry.  By issues #2 and #3, he finally begins to experience his powers of super-speed. However, Sprite tricks Curry into opening a passageway to the long-dormant Celestial underneath San Francisco, and in doing so incapacitates Curry.  During this time the [[Dreaming Celestial]] and Makkari began to talk in his dreams, and told him that it personally made him. By the end of the series he has become the Dreaming Celestial's [[prophet]].

==Powers and abilities==
Makkari is a member of the race of superhumans known as [[Eternal (comics)|Eternals]]. He possesses superhuman strength, speed, and reflexes. He can create cyclones by running in circles, and can run up walls and across water. Makkari's body eventually accumulates fatigue poisons and is susceptible to injury.

Although in most of his appearances Makkari has the typical powers of an Eternal, his obsession with speed, starting in the [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]] series, causes him to focus most of his body's Cosmic Energy into enhancing his running speed.  As a result, he lost his ability to fly and many of his other powers have been weakened in the process. Makkari possesses none of the psionic powers of the average Eternal (levitation, ocular force projection, and molecular rearrangement), having purposefully readapted all his specialized cell enclaves to speed and running-related attributes. At present he can run at near [[light speed]] for extended periods, but his physical strength (while still far greater than human) has been reduced by half, and he seemingly cannot project energy or manipulate matter.

Makkari sometimes wears a protective crash helmet, though he does not truly need it. He wears synthetic stretch fabric, specially treated to resist the rigors of high velocity movement.

Makkari has great mechanical aptitude, and the ability to pilot most land and air vehicles. He has moderate experience at hand-to-hand combat; his fighting style incorporates his superhuman speed. He has finished the standard Eternal higher education, and underwent special tutoring in the applications of speed.
