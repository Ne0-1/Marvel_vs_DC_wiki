'''Makkari''' is a member of the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]], a [[fictional character|fictional]] race of [[superhumans]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel universe|universe]]. He was created by [[writer]]-[[artist]] [[Jack Kirby]] in the 1976-1978 [[comic book]] series ''The Eternals''.

Marvel continuity was later [[retconned]] so that the [[mythological]] [[god (male deity)|god]] [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], introduced as a Marvel protagonist in ''[[Red Raven|Red Raven Comics]]'' #1 (Aug. 1940; "Mercury In the 20th Century" by artist Kirby and writer Martin A. Bursten, [[pen name]] "Burstein") was, in fact, Makkari.

==History==
Makkari is the son of [[Verona (comics)|Verona]] and [[Mara (comics)|Mara]]. He is a member of the Eternals' Technologist's Guild and is skilled at designing and building high-speed vehicles.

Makkari has involved himself in Earth's affairs more often than most Eternals. He was taught philosophy by [[Plato]]. He rescued [[Sersi]] from "[[Nero]]'s big bonfire"; and later spent some time as the charioteer of [[Darius I of Persia]]. He witnessed the [[Trojan War]], the reign of [[Vlad the Impaler]], and the [[Battle of the Alamo|Alamo]].

In the 1940s he worked on Earth, per [[Zuras]] request, under the aliases "Hurricane" and "Mercury" (an example of [[retcon]], these [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] characters were not originally supposed to be related), and fought Warlord [[Kro (comics)|Kro]] and [[Deviant (comics)|Deviant]] Mutates alongside the [[Monster Hunters]], a team he formed using his identity as National Security Agent Jake Curtiss. Later on, he taught [[Elvis Presley]] a few guitar tricks. 

Following the dis-banding of the Monster Hunters, Makkari was convinced by [[Pixie]] to join the [[First Line]] as "Major Mercury".

Makkari was with the Eternals who introduced themselves to the students at City College during the Fourth Host of the [[Celestials]]. He accompanied [[Ikaris]] in his battles against the [[Deviant (comics)|Deviants]], and participated in the defeat of [[Ghaur]].  He became friends with [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]] when he enlisted Quasar to help him save [[Master Elo]], who was tutoring Makkari in how to channel his cosmic energy into more speed; he later worked in Quasar's office under the alias "Mike Khary."  He was killed in ''Quasar'' #21, but returned to life in "Quasar" #25, as part of an agreement struck between Eternity, Death, Infinity and Oblivion.  He participated in a race against the [[Runner (comics)|Runner]], one of the [[Elders of the Universe]], and won. However, he soon found he had become so fast that he could no longer move in synch with the rest of the universe.  [[Maelstrom (comics)|Maelstrom]] later attempted to seize more power by draining the kinetic energy from Makkari, but Maelstrom was ultimately defeated by the other Eternals.

===Eternals mini-series (2006)===
{{spoiler}}
Makkari is featured in the Marvel mini-series ''Eternals'', written by [[Neil Gaiman]] and penciled by artist [[John Romita, Jr.]] The Eternals are the victims of memory and reality manipulation by [[Sprite (Eternal)|Sprite]], and have thus forgotten their true identities.  Makkari believes himself to be a young doctor named Mark Curry.  By issues #2 and #3, he finally begins to experience his powers of super-speed. However, Sprite tricks Curry into opening a passageway to the long-dormant Celestial underneath San Francisco, and in doing so incapacites Curry. The story is on-going.

==Powers and abilities==
Although in most of his appearances Makkari has the typical powers of an Eternal, his obsession with speed, starting in the [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]] series, causes him to focus most of his body's Cosmic Energy into enhancing his running speed.  As a result, he lost his ability to fly and many of his other powers have been weakened in the process. At present he can run at near [[light speed]] for extended periods, but his physical strength (while still far greater than human) has been reduced by half, and he seemingly cannot project energy or manipulate matter.

Makkari sometimes wears a protective crash helmet, though he does not truly need it.
