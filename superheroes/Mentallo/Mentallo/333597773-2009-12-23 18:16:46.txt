'''Mentallo''' (real name '''Marvin Flumm''') is a [[fictional]] [[comic book]] [[supervillain]], a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] who appears in books published by [[Marvel Comics]].

After having been fired for cause after attempting a covert takeover of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], he has since operated as both a freelance criminal and subversive and a high-ranking agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s enemy [[HYDRA]]. Flumm is usually depicted as using technology to increase his power. He once had a long-term partnership with the Fixer. This partnership effectively ended when the Fixer was invited to join the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].

==Fictional character biography ==
Marvin Flumm was born in [[Watford City, North Dakota]].  He once worked as a shoe salesman. As a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] telepath of moderate ability, Mentallo was recruited by the original [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] as a candidate for their ESP Division. However, he teamed with the [[Fixer (comics)|Fixer]] in an attempt to take over S.H.I.E.L.D., and clashed with [[Nick Fury]] for the first time.<ref>''Strange Tales'' Vol. 1 #141</ref> He then served as a division leader in the [[HYDRA]] fragment led by [[Silvermane (comics)|Silvermane]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #123</ref> Mentallo teamed with the Fixer again, and they placed [[Deathlok#Luther Manning|Deathlok]] under their control. They attempted to make the U.S. President their slave, but were thwarted by the [[Fantastic Four]].<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #26-27</ref> Mentallo and the Fixer were employed by HYDRA again, but Mentallo was rendered comatose by the [[Micronauts (comics)|Micronauts]].<ref>''Micronauts'' #24-25</ref> In the custody of [[Professor Power]], Mentallo battled [[Professor X]] on a psychic plane.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #118</ref> Mentallo was captured by the [[Super-Adaptoid]], who was impersonating the Fixer, but he was rescued by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>''Avengers'' #287</ref>

Under the name ''Think Tank'', Flumm was a member of the [[Resistants (comics)|Resistants]], which was originally an incarnation of the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]]. The Resistants opposed the [[Registration acts (comics)# Mutant Registration Act|Mutant Registration Act]]. As Think-Thank, he fought the then-current [[USAgent|Captain America]].<ref>''Captain America'' #346</ref> He was imprisoned, and resumed his identity as Mentallo. He started a mass breakout at the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]]. However, his powers were briefly amplified and used by [[Iron Man]] to compel the escapees to surrender.<ref>''Avengers: Death Trap, the Vault''</ref> He then directed an unsuccessful attack on the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]].<ref>''Incredible Hulk Annual'' #18</ref> Mentallo later attended the [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] weapons exposition.<ref>''Captain America'' #412</ref>

Mentallo once worked for the [[Red Skull]] and partnered with the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] in a successful attempt to brainwash the Hulk to attack the Avengers. Mentallo managed to mentally impersonate the Hulk's wife-killing father and bully him into submission.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #403</ref>

His most recent major role in the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe was using his telepathy as part of a conspiracy to break out of prison and acquire a device that would allow his employer to control all the supervillains who ever worked for [[Justin Hammer]]. Controlling the body of the villain [[Headlok]], while Mentallo himself remained in prison, he freed several prisoners who came to be informally known as the ''Chain Gang''. [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] was included in the breakout, and led to the plan failing, following it up by forming a new team of [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]. He is one of the few mutants who retained their powers after the Decimation.

Mentallo plays a small role in the "[[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]]" crossover event.

Shortly after the events of [[World War Hulk]], Mentallo was among the members of [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s Crime Syndicate.<ref>New Avengers #35 (2007)</ref> He remained with them until they were defeated by the New Avengers.<ref>New Avengers Annual #2 (2008)</ref>

Some time after, Mentallo was hired by [[MODOK]] to be part of a supervillain heist squad.{{Issue|date=December 2009}} Due to his psychic powers, he realised MODOK was creating a psychic illusion of money to secure everyone's loyalty, and MODOK secretly told him the "full extent" of the plans would be revealed to him, and several other villains.{{Issue|date=December 2009}} Mentallo quickly decided that instead he was going to sell the villain out to whoever stumped up the cash. After noticing "[[Chameleon (comics)|the Chameleon]]" had a telepathic shield and Spider-Man's powers & Spider-Sense, he went to him offering to betray MODOK's plans to the Avengers for cash.{{Issue|date=December 2009}} Unfortunately for Mentallo, it wasn't Spider-Man at all but A.I.M.'s [[Super-Adaptoid|Ultra-Adaptoid]] which incinerated him to protect its cover.{{Issue|date=December 2009}} He was presumed dead, but Mentallo was revealed to be alive when he appeared at Ryker's Island to inform the Fantastic Four and S.H.I.E.L.D. about the New Defenders.{{Issue|date=December 2009}}

In [[Secret Invasion]], a person who look likes Mentallo appears as part of the Hood's alliance with super-powered heroes. The group is intent on defeating the [[Skrull]] invasion force of New York City.<ref>''[[Secret Invasion]]'' #7</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Mentallo is a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] with limited psionic powers which can be augmented through scientific means (often provided by the Fixer). Mentallo has telepathy and can read the thought of any human mind within an approximate five mile (8&nbsp;km) radius. He has the ability to project "mental bolts" at opponents, create psionic screens to protect himself from psionic assault, control the bodies and minds of other humans, communicate telepathically and cast mental illusions. Mentallo has difficulty focusing his powers on moving targets. He is unusually vulnerable to psionic attack unless he erects a mental screen.

Mentallo wears a modified [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] battle-suit. He has used various weaponry, including conventional firearms, rocket-guns, and a "sonic whammer" which projects intense vibratory blasts. He usually wears a special helmet to protect him against telepathic feedback, background noise and psionic assault from other telepaths. The Fixer has supplied him with "electronic masks" (or "servo-pods") which adhere to victims' faces and places them under Mentallo's control. The Fixer's "mentascope" enables Mentallo to use his psionic power to locate and attack victims from afar. Mentallo is cabable of flight via the Fixer's "anti-grav propellant unit" or "flying discs" and a tank that can bore its way through the ground.

Mentallo also has the ability to send out mental probes to identify the shape and size of objects in his near vicinity, effectively creating some type of radar-sense. He can even locate invisible and intangible objects this way.

As the Resistants member Think Tank, he rode within a small tread-propelled vehicle in which he sat, with his upper body and head still exposed. This tank unit was armed with a wide range of weapons — machine guns, metal grappler arms etc. — which Mentallo directly controlled with his telepathic ability and a special interface helmet.
