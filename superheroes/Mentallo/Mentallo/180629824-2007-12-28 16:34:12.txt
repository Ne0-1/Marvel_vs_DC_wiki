'''Mentallo''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].

==Fictional character biography ==
Marvin Flumm was born in [[Watford City, North Dakota]].  As a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] telepath of moderate ability, Mentallo was recruited by the original [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] as a candidate for their ESP Division. Having been fired for cause after attempting a covert takeover of that organization, he has since operated as both a freelance criminal and a high-ranking agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s enemy [[HYDRA]]. Flumm is usually depicted as using technology to increase his power. He once had a longterm partnership with the [[Fixer (comics)|Fixer]]. This partnership effectively ended when the Fixer was invited to join the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].

Mentallo once worked for the [[Red Skull]] and partnered with the [[Juggernaut]] in a successful attempt to get the Hulk to attack the Avengers. Mentallo managed to mentally impersonate the Hulk's wife-killing father and bully him into submission.

Under the name ''Think Tank'', Flumm was a member of the [[Resistants (comics)|Resistants]], originally an incarnation of the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]]. The Resistants opposed the [[Registration Acts (comics)|Mutant Registration Act]]. 

His most recent major role in the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe was using his telepathy as part of a conspiracy to break out of prison and acquire a device that would allow his employer to control all the supervillains who ever worked for [[Justin Hammer]]. Controlling the body of the villain [[Headlok]], while Mentallo himself remained in prison, he freed several prisoners who came to be informally known as the ''Chain Gang''. [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] was included in the breakout, and led to the plan failing, following it up by forming a new team of [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]. He is one of the few mutants who retained their powers after the Decimation.

Mentallo was hired by [[MODOK]] to be part of a supervillain heist squad. Due to his psychic powers, he realised MODOK was creating a psychic illusion of money to secure everyone's loyalty, and MODOK secretly told him the "full extent" of the plans would be revealed to him. and several other villains. Mentallo quickly decided that instead he was going to sell the villain out to whoever stumped up the cash. After noticing "[[Chameleon (comics)|the Chameleon]]" had a telepathic shield and Spider-Man's powers & Spider-Sense, he went to him offering to betray MODOK's plans to the Avengers for cash. Unfortunately for Mentallo, it wasn't Spider-Man at all but A.I.M.'s [[Super-Adaptoid|Ultra-Adaptoid]] which incinerated him to protect its cover. He is presumed dead, though the MODOK's 11 recap page merely lists him as Missing In Action.

Someone that looks like Mentallo was among the members of [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s Crime Syndicate <ref>New Avengers #35 (2007)</ref>.
==Powers and abilities==
Mentallo is a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] with limited telepathic abilities, allowing him to read minds, control the bodies and minds of other humans, communicate telepathically and create illusions. He often uses scientific means (often provided by the Fixer) to enhance his telepathic abilities. 
He usually wears a special helmet to protect him against telepathic feedback, background noise and other telepaths. 
Mentallo also has the ability to send out mental probes to identify the shape and size of objects in his near vicinity, effectively creating some type of radar-sense. He can even locate invisible and intangible objects this way.

As the Resistants member Think Tank, he used a small tread-propelled vehicle in which he sat, with his upper body and head still exposed. This tank unit was armed with a wide range of weapons - machine guns, grappler arms etc. - which Mentallo directly controlled with his telepathic ability and a special interface helmet.
