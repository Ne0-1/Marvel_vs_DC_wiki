'''Darkstar''' ('''Laynia Petrovna''') is a [[fiction]]al [[character (arts)|character]], a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[Superhero#Female superheroes|superheroine]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. She has been a member of various super-teams in her career, including [[X-Corporation]] and [[Champions (comics)|Champions of Los Angeles]].

==Fictional character biography==
Laynia Petrovna and her twin brother [[Vanguard (Marvel Comics)|Nikolai]] were born in [[Minsk]], which at the time was part of the Soviet Union, and is now the capital of [[Belarus]]. When she grew up, she became a special operative of the Soviet government.

===Champions===
Darkstar was first seen as part of a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] super-team recruited to bring Natasha Romanoff (the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]]) back to the USSR.<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = [[Champions (comics)|The Champions]]|Issue = 7|Date = August 1976|Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> She turned sides<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = The Champions|Issue = 10|Date = Jan 1977|Publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref> and joined the Champions as a guest member,<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = The Champions|Issue = 11|Date = February 1977|Publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref> remaining with the team until its disbanding.

While with the Champions, she and Bobby Drake, the former [[X-Men|X-Man]] known as [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], were close to entering into a romantic relationship, but Laynia only liked Iceman as a friend, not as a love-interest.{{Issue|date=January 2012}} She quit the Champions and returned to Russia, leaving behind a devastated Iceman.<ref>''Peter Parker: The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #17 (April 1978)</ref>

===In Russia's employ===
Darkstar became a member of the [[Soviet Super-Soldiers]] with her brother, [[Vanguard (Marvel Comics)|Vanguard]], and the fifth [[Dmitri Bukharin|Crimson Dynamo]]. The Soviet Super-Soldiers battled [[Iron Man]] and [[Jack of Hearts]] on the moon. The Super-Soldiers wound up helping the heroes in battling renegade [[Rigellians (Marvel Comics)|Rigellians]] led by Commander Arcturus.<ref>''Iron Man'' #109, 112</ref>

Later, Darkstar and Vanguard were sent along with new Soviet Super-Soldier [[Ursa Major (comics)|Ursa Major]] by the [[KGB]] to defeat Sergei the [[Presence (Marvel Comics)|Presence]]. They fought Sergei and the second [[Starlight (comics)|Red Guardian]], but then Darkstar and Vanguard learned that Sergei was their father, and that [[Professor Phobos]] had exploited the Super-Soldiers.  Darkstar aided in freeing Sergei and Starlight, and defeating Phobos.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #258-259, by [[Bill Mantlo]]</ref>

Later on, she was a key player in the ''[[Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions|Contest of Champions]]'', in which she represented Russia as part of the international superhero contest.

The Soviet Super-Soldiers were then sent by the Soviet government to Khystym to battle the [[Gremlin (comics)|Gremlin]]. They fought the [[Spaceknights]] [[Rom (comics)|Rom]] and [[Starshine (comics)#Brandy Clark|Starshine]], but later allied with them against the [[Dire Wraith]]s. The Super-Soldiers wound up befriending the Gremlin instead of fighting him.<ref>''Rom'' #45-46</ref>

Later, the Soviet Super-Soldiers agreed to help bring [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] to justice.  They fought the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], but turned against the Crimson Dynamo when it turned out that he had been manipulating events.<ref>''X-Men Vs. Avengers'' #1-3</ref>

The former Soviet Super-Soldiers Darkstar, Vanguard, and Ursa Major eventually defected to the United States seeking political asylum. They arrived at [[Hydro-Base|Avengers Island]], asking for [[Captain America]]'s help.  They were beaten nearly to death by the [[Supreme Soviets]], who had disguised themselves as members of the Avengers. The comatose subconscious minds of the Super-Soldiers formed a "Great Beast" that followed the Supreme Soviets back to the USSR and tried to kill them. Captain America persuaded the "Great Beast" to stand down, and the three heroes later regained consciousness and began to recover from their injuries.<ref>''Captain America'' #352-353</ref>

The Soviet Super-Soldiers were eventually captured and returned to the Soviet Union. They were rescued by a man known as [[Blind Faith (comics)|Blind Faith]], and his team called the Exiles (not to be confused with the reality-hopping team the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]), whom she joined.<ref>''Soviet Super Soldiers'' #1 (November 1992)</ref>

Later, when the Supreme Soviets (who had changed their name to People's Protectorate) was rechristened the [[Winter Guard]], Darkstar was recruited back into the team. After that team also disbanded, Darkstar and Vanguard teamed with a Russian mutant team and later joined forces with their father, the [[Presence (Marvel Comics)|Presence]].

===Death===
Later, it is revealed that Darkstar joined the [[Paris]] branch of [[X-Corporation]],<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = [[New X-Men]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 130|Date = October 2002|Publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref> in which she was possessed by [[Huntsman (comics)|Weapon XII]], a creation of the [[Weapon Plus|Weapon Plus Project]], and was subsequently killed by [[Fantomex]]. A funeral was held in her honor at [[PÃ¨re Lachaise Cemetery]] in Paris, where she was buried.

During the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline, Darkstar is among the dead characters seen in Erebus when [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] travels to the Underworld.<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #129</ref>

Darkstar is temporarily resurrected by means of the [[Techno-organic virus#The Transmode Virus|Transmode Virus]] to serve as part of [[Selene (comics)|Selene]]'s army of deceased mutants.  Under the control of Selene and [[Eli Bard]], she takes part in the assault on the mutant nation of [[Utopia (comics)|Utopia]].<ref name ="XFv3i21">''X-Force'' (3rd Series) #21, January 2010</ref>

===New Darkstars===
A new, red-haired Darkstar first appeared as a member of the [[Winter Guard]] in ''Hulk'' #1. Her name was revealed to be Sasha Roerich.<ref name="WinterGuard">{{Comic book reference|Title = Hulk: Winter Guard|Volume = 1|Issue = 1|Date = December 2009|Publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref>
As she revealed during a counseling session, she was genetically modeled to resemble the previous Darkstar. After being again altered by The Presence, her body betrayed itself - and she was transformed into a multi-tentacled Darkforce beast. She was killed by [[Red Guardian]].<ref name="WinterGuard"/>

With Sasha's death, Reena Stanicoff took over the role.<ref name="WinterGuard"/> Reena was killed during an attack on Winter Guard headquarters by a [[Dire Wraith]], who then began to assume her form.<ref name="Darkstar & The Winter Guard">{{Comic book reference|Title = Darkstar & The Winter Guard|Volume = 1|Issue = 3|Date = August 2010|Publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref> Although the Winter Guard fought off the attack, Reena's death was subsequently covered up by the Government.

===Laynia Reborn===
The Dire Wraith who assumed Reena's form was on the verge of killing all the Winter Guard when it was suddenly overwhelmed and taken over by darkforce energy. To the astonishment of all present, the original Darkstar - Laynia Petrovna - seized control of the creature and resurrected herself.<ref name="Darkstar & The Winter Guard"/> Having brought herself back to life, she reunited with her brother Vanguard and has since returned to active duty alongside both her brother and Ursa Major.{{Issue|date=September 2010}} She was next seen fighting [[Hyperion (comics)|Hyperion]].<ref name="Age of Heroes">{{Comic book reference|Title = Age of Heroes|Volume = 1|Issue = 3|Date = August 2010|Publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref>

Laynia, along with the other members of the Winter Guard, was blasted into space by the Intelligencia, a team formed by some of the smartest villains of the Marvel Universe. <ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #676</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Darkstar is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who can psionically access the extra-dimensional energy of the [[Darkforce]] dimension, which grants her a number of superhuman abilities. She is connected to the [[Darkforce]] dimension by means of her consciousness being split between her physical body and a Darkforce representation of same, both symbiotically linked. Darkstar can thus utilize the Darkforce for various purposes. She can cause Darkforce to behave like either matter or energy. Most often she projected it as simple mentally-controlled solid objects possessing the density of steel such as pincers, rings, columns, and spheres, or as beams of concussive force. If Darkstar is rendered unconscious any Darkforce constructs of her making immediately dissipate. Darkstar can [[Teleportation|teleport]] herself and up to three others by opening a portal into the Darkforce dimension and travelling through it. The maximum distance she can teleport has never been revealed. Because crossing the Darkforce dimension disorients her sense of direction, and the light of Earth blinds her for several seconds upon reemergence, traveling in this manner is risky.

Darkstar can levitate herself and fly at subsonic speeds by generating a virtually invisible portal into the [[Darkforce]] dimension along the contours of her body without passing through it, then balancing the attractive force of the dimension against that of the Earth's gravity. The upper limits of her powers are still unknown.

Darkstar is a skilled hand-to-hand combatant, having been trained by the KGB, and from the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]]. She is fluent in both [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[English language|English]].

While the original Darkstar's costume was designed by the Soviet government and was made of a synthetic stretch fabric insulated against the cold, the other two Darkstars had costumes which were composed of Darkforce material.<ref name="WinterGuard"/>

==Other versions==
===Civil War: House of M===
Darkstar is seen as a member of the Soviet Super-Soldiers.<ref>Civil War: House of M #2</ref>

===Other===
* On Earth 3740, the native timeline of [[Heather Hudson (Exiles)|Heather Hudson]] of the dimension-jumping [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]], the Soviet Union still exists. Darkstar is part of the Soviet Super-Soldiers.<ref>''Exiles'' Vol. 1 #84</ref>

* An alternate version of Darkstar was shown in yet another universe. She was a member of the Republican Guard, Russia's superhuman team, alongside Crimson Dynamo, Omega Red, Gremlin, and the Titanium Man.<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = Exiles|Issue = 43|Date = Jan 2005|Publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
Darkstar guest-starred in the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' episode "Red Dawn".

After witnessing the crimes committed by Omega Red, Darkstar rebels against the generals and sides with the X-Men and [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]]. Curiously, Darkstar did not have her Darkforce powers here and instead manipulated energy as offensive blasts and force screens. She retained her power of flight, however.
