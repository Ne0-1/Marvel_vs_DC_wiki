'''Darkstar''' (real name Laynia Petrovna) is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. Her first appearance was in ''[[Champions (comics)|Champions]]'' #7 as part of a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] super-team recruited to bring Natasha Romanoff (the [[Black Widow (comics)|Black Widow]]) back to the USSR. She turned sides in #10, joined the Champions in #11, and remained with the team until its disbanding.

Later on, she was a key player in the ''[[Contest of Champions]]'' miniseries, in which she represented Russia as part of the international superhero contest. Her origin was revealed by [[Bill Mantlo]] in a ''[[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]'' storyline.  She made a number of further appearances, usually alongside the [[Soviet Super Soldiers]] with her brother, [[Vanguard (comics)|Vanguard]]. After the Soviet Super Soldiers disbanded, Darkstar and Vanguard teamed with a Russian mutant team and later joined forces with their father, the [[Presence (comics)|Presence]]. In ''[[New X-Men]]'' #130, she was possessed by Weapon XII, a creation of the [[Weapon Plus Project]], and was subsequently killed by [[Fantomex]].

Darkstar's power was control of the [[Darkforce]] energies. She could use this extra-dimensional energy to fly and to create forcefields.
