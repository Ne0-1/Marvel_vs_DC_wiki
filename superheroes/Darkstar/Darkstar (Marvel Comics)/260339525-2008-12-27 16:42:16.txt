'''Darkstar''' ('''Laynia Petrovna''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] [[superheroine]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. She has been a member of various super-teams in her career and ultimately died as a member of the [[X-Corporation]] in ''New [[X-Men]] #130''. A new Darkstar has since appeared several times as a member of the new [[Winter Guard]].<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 4 #1</ref><ref>''She Hulk'' vol.4 #32</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Laynia Petrovna was born in [[Minsk]], which at the time was part of the Soviet Union, and is now the capital of [[Belarus]]. When she grew up, she became a special operative of the Soviet government.

===Champions===
Darkstar was first seen as part of a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] super-team recruited to bring Natasha Romanoff (the [[Black Widow (comics)|Black Widow]]) back to the [[USSR]].<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = [[Champions (comics)|The Champions]]|Issue = 7|Date = (Aug 1976)|Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> She turned sides<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = The Champions|Issue = 10|Date = (Jan 1977)|Publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref> and joined the Champions a as guest member,<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = The Champions|Issue = 11|Date = (Feb 1977)|Publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref> remaining with the team until its disbanding.

While with the Champions, she and Bobby Drake, the former [[X-Men|X-Man]] known as [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], were close to entering into a romantic relationship, but Laynia only liked Iceman as a friend, not as a love-interest. She quit the Champions and returned to Russia, leaving behind a devastated Iceman.

===In Russia's employ===
Darkstar became a member of the [[Soviet Super-Soldiers]] with her brother, [[Vanguard (comics)|Vanguard]], and the fifth [[Dmitri Bukharin|Crimson Dynamo]]. The Soviet Super-Soldiers battled [[Iron Man]] and [[Jack of Hearts]] on the moon. The Super-Soldiers wound up helping the heroes in battling renegade [[Rigellians (Marvel Comics)|Rigellians]] led by Commander Arcturus.<ref>''Iron Man'' #109, 112</ref>

Later, Darkstar and Vanguard were sent along with new Soviet Super-Soldier [[Ursa Major (comics)|Ursa Major]] by the KGB to defeat Sergei the [[Presence (Marvel Comics)|Presence]]. They fought Sergei and the second [[Starlight (comics)|Red Guardian]], but then Darkstar and Vanguard learned that Sergei was their father, and that [[Professor Phobos]] had exploited the Super-Soldiers.  Darkstar aided in freeing Sergei and Starlight, and defeating Phobos.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #258-259, by [[Bill Mantlo]]</ref>

Later on, she was a key player in the ''[[Contest of Champions]]'', in which she represented Russia as part of the international superhero contest.

The Soviet Super-Soldiers were then sent by the Soviet government to Khystym to battle the [[Gremlin (comics)|Gremlin]]. They fought the [[Spaceknights]] [[Rom (comics)|Rom]] and [[Starshine (comics)#Brandy Clark|Starshine]], but later allied with them against the [[Dire Wraith]]s. The Super-Soldiers wound up befriending the Gremlin instead of fighting him.<ref>''Rom'' #45-46</ref>

Later, the Soviet Super-Soldiers agreed to help bring [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] to justice.  They fought the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], but turned against the Crimson Dynamo when it turned out that he had been manipulating events.<ref>''X-Men Vs. Avengers'' #1-3</ref>

The former Soviet Super-Soldiers Darkstar, Vanguard, and Ursa Major eventually defected to the United States seeking political asylum. They arrived at [[Hydro-Base|Avengers Island]], asking for [[Captain America]]'s help.  They were beaten nearly to death by the [[Supreme Soviets]], who had disguised themselves as members of the Avengers. The comatose subconscious minds of the Super-Soldiers formed a "Great Beast" that followed the Supreme Soviets back to the U.S.S.R. and tried to kill them. Captain America persuaded the "Great Beast" to stand down, and the three heroes later regained consciousness and began to recover from their injuries.<ref>''Captain America'' #352-353</ref>

The Soviet Super-Soldiers were eventually captured and returned to the Soviet Union. They were rescued by a man known as [[Blind Faith (comics)|Blind Faith]], and his team called the Exiles (not to be confused with the reality-hopping team the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]), whom she joined.

Later, when the Supreme Soviets (who had changed their name to People's Protectorate) was rechristened the [[Winter Guard]], Darkstar was recruited back into the team. After that team also disbanded, Darkstar and Vanguard teamed with a Russian mutant team and later joined forces with their father, the [[Presence (Marvel Comics)|Presence]].

===X-Corporation and Death===
Later it was revealed that she joined the [[X-Corporation]] [[Paris]] branch,<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = [[New X-Men]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 130|Date = (Oct 2002)|Publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref> in which she was possessed by [[Huntsman (comics)|Weapon XII]], a creation of the [[Weapon Plus Project]], and was subsequently killed by [[Fantomex]]. A funeral was held in her honor at [[PÃ¨re Lachaise]] Cemetery in Paris, where she was buried.

===The New Darkstar===

<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Winter Guard.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The new Darkstar alongside the Winter Guard]] -->

A new, red-haired Darkstar first appeared as a member of the [[Winter Guard (comics)|Winter Guard]] in ''Hulk'' #1. Her name, origin, and powers have yet to be shown.

==Powers and abilities==
Darkstar was a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who could psionically access the extra-dimensional energy of the [[Darkforce]] dimension, which granted her a number of superhuman abilities. She was connected to the [[Darkforce]] dimension by means of her consciousness being split between her physical body and a Darkforce representation of same, both symbiotically linked. Darkstar could thus utilize the Darkforce for various purposes. She could cause Darkforce to behave like either matter or energy. Most often she projected it as simple mentally-controlled solid objects possessing the density of steel such as pincers, rings, columns, and spheres, or as beams of concussive force. If Darkstar was rendered unconscious any Darkforce constructs of her making would immediately dissipate. Darkstar could [[teleport]] herself and up to three others by opening a portal into the Darkforce dimension and traveling through it. The maximum distance she could teleport was never revealed. Because crossing the Darkforce dimension disoriented her sense of direction, and the light of Earth blinded her for several seconds upon reemergence, traveling in this manner was risky. 

Darkstar could levitate herself and fly at subsonic speeds by generating a virtually invisible portal into the [[Darkforce]] dimension along the contours of her body without passing through it, then balancing the attractive force of the dimension against that of the Earth's gravity. The upper limits of her powers were unknown at the time of her death.

Darkstar was a skilled hand-to-hand combatant, having been trained by the [[KGB]], and from the [[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]]. She was fluent in both [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[English language|English]].

Darkstar's costume was made of synthetic stretch fabric insulated against the cold, which was designed by the Soviet government.

==Other media==
===Television===
Darkstar guest-starred in the ''[[X-Men Animated Series]]'' episode ''Red Dawn''. She's initially the mutant enforcer for a group of Russian generals seeking to reestablish the Soviet Union with the aid of [[Omega Red]]. After witnessing the crimes committed by Omega Red, Darkstar rebels against the generals and sides with the X-Men and [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]]. Curiously, Darkstar did not have her Darkforce powers here and instead manipulated energy as offensive blasts and force screens. She retained her power of flight, however.{{Fact|date=November 2008}}
