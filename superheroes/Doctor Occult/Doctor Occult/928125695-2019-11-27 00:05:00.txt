'''Doctor Occult''' is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. Created by [[Superman]]'s creators [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]], Doctor Occult, referred to by the epithet the "Ghost Detective", is a private investigator and user of magic who specializes in cases involving the supernatural.<ref name="dc-ency">{{Cite book | last=Wallace | first=Dan | contribution=Doctor Occult | editor-last=Dougall | editor-first=Alastair | title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page=105 | publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] | location=New York | year=2008 | isbn=0-7566-4119-5 | oclc=213309017}}</ref> Doctor Occult first appeared in 1935 and is the earliest character created by DC Comics still currently used in the [[DC Universe]].

==Publication history==
The character first appeared in the [[anthology]] comic books series originally entitled ''New Fun Comics'' (later retitled ''[[More Fun Comics]]'') in issue #6 by [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]] in October 1935 as one of the first depicted superheroes published by [[DC Comics]] and in [[American comic book]]s predating even [[Superman]] in publication. 

He was depicted as a [[supernatural]] detective, whose detecting style was very much in the style of [[Sam Spade]], only with supernatural abilities with a supporting character named Rose Psychic.<ref name="Time">{{cite web|last1=Wolk|first1=Douglas|title=75 Years of the First Comic Book Superhero (It’s Not Who You Think)|url=http://techland.time.com/2010/07/05/75-years-of-the-first-comic-book-superhero-its-not-who-you-think/|website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=23 April 2016}}</ref> Writers such as [[Les Daniels]] and others cited the character as what would be a prototype of Superman.<ref>{{cite web |title=New Book Reveals Secret History of Comic Heroes {{!}} CBR |url=https://www.cbr.com/new-book-reveals-secret-history-of-comic-heroes/ |website=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=4 April 2019}}</ref>

He also appeared in [[Centaur Publications]]' ''The Comics Magazine'' #1 under the name "Dr. Mystic". This was the same character because his story, "The Koth and the Seven", began in ''The Comics Magazine'' and continued in DC's ''More Fun Comics'' #14–17 (issues also designated as vol. 2, #2–5). In this story, he travels to a mystic realm where he flies and wears a cape, making him the first caped comic book superhero. Doctor Occult made his last [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] appearance in ''More Fun Comics'' #32 in 1938.

After years of obscurity the character was revived in the 1980s.  He appeared in ''[[All-Star Squadron]]'' (1985), a title set during [[World War II]] and on [[Earth-Two]]. He appeared later in crossover comics such as ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' (1986), [[Neil Gaiman]]'s ''[[The Books of Magic]]'' (1991), ''[[The Trenchcoat Brigade]]'' (alongside [[Mister E]], the [[Phantom Stranger]], and [[John Constantine]]) (1999) and "[[Day of Judgment (comics)|Day of Judgement]]". <ref>{{cite web |title=Dr. Occult |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/droccult.htm |accessdate=4 April 2019|website=[[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]]}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
The fictional character’s origin was that on New Year's Eve, 1899, Dr. Occult and his partner Rose Psychic had slated as [[human sacrifice]]s at the hands of a Satanic cult, but were rescued by a shadowy group called "The Seven". The two were later trained in the use of occult magics themselves. Thirty-six years later, Doctor Occult opened up his own detective agency, specializing in crimes of a mystical nature. During [[World War II]] he joined the All-Star Squadron. At some point, he and Rose become fused into one being. Doctor Occult has used sorcery to halt or greatly slow the aging process, so that he appears in modern comics to still be a man in his late thirties or early forties, even though he was born at the end of the 19th century.<ref name="dc-ency"/><ref>{{cite web |title=Doctor Occult of Earth-Two appearances|url=http://www.mikesamazingworld.com/mikes/features/character.php?page=appearances&characterid=5 |website=www.mikesamazingworld.com |accessdate=4 April 2019}}</ref>

In 1991, [[Neil Gaiman]] brought the character back into the spotlight with a prominent supporting role in ''[[The Books of Magic]]''. In the third issue he acts as [[Timothy Hunter|Tim Hunter]]'s guide to otherworlds. When visiting [[Faerie (DC Comics)|Faerie]], he transforms into Rose. Tim learns many important things from Dr. Occult, while nearly being trapped in the realm of the fae. This journey is meant to guide Timothy on the role to his becoming the most powerful magician of the current era. The other guides on this mission are [[Mister E]], the [[Phantom Stranger]], and [[Hellblazer|John Constantine]], the last of whom sarcastically nicknames the group the [[Trenchcoat Brigade]]. The four would return later at a summons from Timothy, who, having lost everything at that point, needs a new direction in life.

Later stories would continue the idea of Occult and Rose Psychic being one. There are two origin stories given to explain how they became one person.

The first appears in ''Superman Annual'' #7, a "year one" story to explain how Superman and Dr. Occult met. Dr. Occult explained that Rose had been severely injured battling a creature named Thahn. Occult leads Superman and the reader to believe that Rose had been killed. Later, Superman is very shocked to find Rose alive, and wonders where Occult is. When the story concludes, Superman and Occult defeat Thahn but Superman did not see the two switch back, although the reader does. It is then revealed that the Seven who trained them saved Rose by allowing them to "time-share".

Later, in the miniseries ''The [[Justice Society Returns]]'', a new version explained that Doctor Occult was killed in battle with an otherworldly entity, and Rose bonded their souls together to restore him.

===Sentinels of Magic===
Doctor Occult is one of the [[Sentinels of Magic]], a group created to prevent artifacts such as the [[Spear of Destiny]] falling into the wrong hands.

Dr. Occult/Rose plays a vital role in the [[Day of Judgement (comics)|Day of Judgement]] incident, helping to protect Earth from a full demonic invasion. Hell itself has emptied of demons and Earth was in danger from [[Asmodel]], a fallen angel who had stolen the power of the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]]. Battling on ravaged city streets, Occult works with other heroes, such as [[Katana (comics)|Katana]], [[Batman]], [[Phantom Stranger]] and Ragman but he specifically tries to protect [[Madame Xanadu]]. She had stolen some of Asmodel's power, weakening him considerably, and was hiding it behind a forcefield.

He would later be affected by the Spectre again. Confused and hostless, the Spectre destroys the "Rock of Eternity" scattering fragments all over [[Gotham City]]. Several dozen mystically attuned heroes, including Doctor Occult, [[Phantom Stranger]], [[Detective Chimp]] and [[Rex the Wonder Dog]] work together to free Gotham City from its demonic influence. Occult is briefly possessed by one of the semi-sentient "Seven Sins of Man", which had been imprisoned in the Rock for some time. Soon, Gotham, and Occult are both cleared of demonic influence.<ref>''Day of Vengeance: Infinite Crisis Special'' (March 2006)</ref>

In the limited series ''JLA: Black Baptism'' (May–August 2001), Doctor Occult assists the JLA in battling a group of demons who stylize themselves after American mafia/gangsters. Partly motivated by revenge, they go after the Sentinels of Magic and other entities who have assisted in the "Day of Judgement" incident. Occult is forced to go on the run, hiding as Rose in a magical hangout, 'the Scrap Bar'. He is attacked by three of the Diablos, who take the opportunity to try to kill the other magicians. [[Wonder Woman]] and [[Green Lantern]] rescue him and subdue the demons. He soon helps heal Superman, who had been injured by a magical "worm-bullet".

Doctor Occult later becomes a [[Justice Society of America|JSA]] reservist.

===''Reign in Hell''===
Doctor Occult is the main character in the backup story in the ''Reign in Hell'' mini-series where he enters [[Hell (DC Comics)|Hell]] in order to find [[Rose Psychic]]. Rose had been lost in a mysterious demon attack. Doctor Occult conjures up [[Yellow Peri]], as an expendable spirit guide for the realms of Hell. Despite this, he rescues her from a demonic attack that causes her to lose both legs from the knees down. Occult and Peri find Rose serving the Purgatory-based forces that are attempting to conquer hell.<ref>''Reign in Hell'' #2 (October 2008)</ref>

In a desperate gamble to stop [[Blaze and Satanus]] from conquering Purgatory, Rose enters Hell by her own will, condemning herself to eternal damnation. Despite Yellow Peri's contrary advice, Doctor Occult trusts her with the ''Unspoken Principum'', a mysterious and universal truth that every condemned soul knows, but s/he can never communicate by any means. The ''Unspoken Principium'' is later revealed as, "You can leave whenever you want", even if actually no condemned soul left Hell by his/her own will in the DCU, including Rose.<ref>''Reign in Hell'' #3–5 (November 2008&nbsp;– January 2009)</ref>

===The New 52===
In ''[[the New 52]]'' (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), Doctor Occult appeared in the final pages of ''[[Justice League Dark]]'' #12, where he is revealed to be the keeper of the House of Secrets. Nick Necro, whose identity is not revealed until the next issue, knocks on Doctor Occult's door. When Doctor Occult answers the door, he recognizes his visitor just before he is attacked and murdered by Necro.<ref>''Justice League Dark'' #12</ref>

===Injustice: Gods Among Us===

==Reception==
Bill Reed of [[Comic Book Resources]] praised the character saying that [[DC Comics]] could portray more of him despite him not having the staying power as other supernatural heroes such as [[Phantom Stranger]] or [[John Constantine]].<ref name="Reed">{{cite web |title=365 Reasons to Love Comics #84 {{!}} CBR |url=https://www.cbr.com/365-reasons-to-love-comics-84/ |website=www.cbr.com |accessdate=4 April 2019}}</ref>
