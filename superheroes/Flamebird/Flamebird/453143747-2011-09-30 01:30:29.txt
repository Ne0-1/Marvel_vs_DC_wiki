'''Flamebird''' is the name used by six different [[fictional]] [[comic book]] characters who have appeared in books published by [[DC Comics]], specifically from the ''[[Superman]]'' and ''[[Batman]]'' mythos.

The primary character to use the Flamebird name is '''[[Bette Kane]]''', who was the pre-''Crisis'' hero '''[[Batgirl#Betty Kane|Bat-Girl]]'''. However, the original pre-''Crisis'' Flamebird was [[Jimmy Olsen]], who was later succeeded by a [[Kandor]]ian scientist. Post-''Crisis'', Jimmy Olsen was never Flamebird, but a [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonian]] hero did use the name, and in a "[[One Year Later]]" storyline, so has [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Kara Zor-El]].

Flamebird characters are also often associated with characters who use the name [[Nightwing]].

==Pre-Crisis history==

In [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|pre-Crisis]] continuity, Flamebird was an alias used by [[Jimmy Olsen]] in adventures shared with [[Superman]] in the city of [[Kandor]], a [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonian]] city that had been shrunken and preserved in a bottle.

In Kandor, Superman had no powers and was branded an outlaw due to a misunderstanding. To protect themselves, Superman and Jimmy created vigilante identities inspired by [[Batman]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]; however, as neither bats nor robins existed on Krypton, Superman chose the names of two native avian species: [[Nightwing]] (for himself) and Flamebird (for Jimmy). At one point, Nightwing and Flamebird teamed up with their inspirations, Batman and Robin, for an adventure in Kandor which would prove especially important to the young Robin.

In ''Superman'' #166 (January 1964), the imaginary sons of Superman go to Kandor, and take on the Flamebird/Nightwing personas in order to combat a Kandorian villain by the name of Gann Artar, after finding the costumes used by their father and Jimmy Olsen.

===Ak-Var===<!-- This section is linked from [[List of DC Comics characters: F]] -->
While in Kandor, Nightwing and Flamebird met Van-Zee, a Kandorian scientist who looked strikingly similar to Superman. At one point, Van-Zee himself donned the Nightwing costume in order to rescue a captured Superman. After Superman and Jimmy's departure from Kandor, Van-Zee took up the role of Nightwing full-time.

Ak-Var, Van-Zee's lab assistant and husband of his niece Thara, later assumed the mantle of Flamebird. The two shared several distinct adventures, once teaming up with Superman and Jimmy.

==Post-Crisis==
===Bette Kane===

For a brief time in the 1970s, the young costumed adventurer Betty Kane had joined a west coast version of the [[Teen Titans]], Titans West, under her original moniker of "Bat-Girl". After the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]], "Bat-Girl" did not exist, though her team did. ''[[Secret Origins]] Annual'' #3 (1989) established the official post-Crisis history of Titans West. Instead of Betty Kane as Bat-Girl, fans were introduced to a similar character called Mary Elizabeth "Bette" Kane, also known as Flamebird.<ref name="dc-ency">{{Cite book | last=Beatty | first=Scott | author-link=Scott Beatty | contribution=Flamebird | editor-last=Dougall | editor-first=Alastair | title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page=128 | publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] | location=[[New York]] | year=2008 | isbn=0-7566-4119-5 | oclc=213309017}}</ref>

====The Krypton connection====
''Nightwing Secret Files'' #1 tells the post-Crisis tale of how [[Dick Grayson]] became [[Nightwing]], but retroactively erases the notion that Superman and Jimmy Olsen ever held the titles of Nightwing or Flamebird, respectively.

The connection between Bette Kane's "Flamebird" and Grayson's "Nightwing" was conjectural until 2001's ''Superman: The Man of Steel'' #111, wherein Superman and [[Lois Lane]] travel to [[Krypton (comics)#Revisiting Krypton|a version of the Kryptonian past]] and assume the names themselves. This once again associated Superman with the roles directly, and he revealed to Lois that he had indeed related tales of both Kryptonian legends to Dick and Bette.<ref name="mos111">{{Cite comic | writer=[[Mark Schultz (comics)|Schultz, Mark]] | penciller=[[Doug Mahnke|Mahnke, Doug]] | inker=Nguyen, Tom | story=Return to Krypton, Part Three: The Most Dangerous Kryptonian Game | title=[[Superman: The Man of Steel]] | issue=111 | date=April 2001 | publisher=DC Comics | location=New York}}</ref>

===Kara Zor-El===

In ''[[Supergirl]]'' #6, [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Kara Zor-El]] has assumed the Flamebird identity to fight crime in the city of [[Kandor]], along with [[Power Girl]] as [[Nightwing]].

===Thara Ak-Var===
{{main|Thara Ak-Var}}
In 2008, "[[Superman: New Krypton]]" has Superman coming to terms with the death of his adoptive father while also dealing with 100,000 Kryptonians now living on Earth as a result of the [[Brainiac (story arc)|Brainiac story arc]]. At the end of the fourth issue of the arc, a new Nightwing and Flamebird appear to stop two of [[General Zod]]'s followers (who were living on Kandor) from releasing the Kryptonian General from his [[Phantom Zone]] imprisonment. While guarding the projector in order to prevent any Zod loyalists from freeing him from the Phantom Zone, both Flamebird and Nightwing exhibited powers that are not inherent to normal Kryptonians, Flamebird shooting fire from her hands and Nightwing employing [[psychokinesis|telekinesis]] to dismantle his attackers' weapons. Furthermore, unlike in previous portrayals, Flamebird appears to be the dominant partner. It is later revealed that her real name is [[Thara Ak-Var]], chief of security for New Krypton, whom [[Alura]] partially blames for [[Zor-El]]'s death. Thara also apparently freed [[Chris Kent (comics)|Chris Kent]] from the Phantom Zone, making him the new Nightwing. Thara's name is a reference to the pre-Crisis Flamebird and his wife.<ref>''Action Comics'' #875 (May 2009)</ref> The Flamebird identity is based on a mythical Kryptonian creature, whose existence is intertwined with that of its partner beast, the Nightwing. Thara possesses a connection to the Flamebird, having had dreams and visions involving the creature for most of her life.<ref>''Action Comics Annual'' #12 (2009)</ref>
