'''The Rawhide Kid''' (real name: '''Johnny Bart''', originally given as '''Johnny Clay''') is a [[fiction]]al [[cowboy]] in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[shared universe]]. the [[Marvel Universe]]. The Rawhide Kid was a heroic gunfighter of the 19th Century American West, who was unjustly wanted as an outlaw.  He is one of Marvel's most prolific [[Western (genre)|Western]] characters, rivaled only by the [[Two-Gun Kid]] and [[Kid Colt]].  He and other Marvel western heroes have on rare occasions guest-starred through [[time travel]] in such contemporary titles as ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' and ''[[West Coast Avengers]]''.

==First version: Atlas Comics==
The Rawhide Kid debuted in a 16-issue series (March 1955-Sept. 1957) from Marvel's 1950s predecessor, [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]]. Most of its covers were by highly acclaimed artists, generally either [[Joe Maneely]] or [[John Severin]], but also [[Russ Heath]] and [[Fred Kida]]. Interior art for the first five issues was by [[Bob Brown (comics)|Bob Brown]], Jack Kirby's future successor on ''[[Challengers of the Unknown]]'', with [[Dick Ayers]] on the reins thereafter.

==Second version: Marvel Comics==
After a hiatus, the Rawhide Kid got revamped for the ramping-up Marvel by writer [[Stan Lee]], legendary penciler [[Jack Kirby]] and inker Ayers. Continuing the Atlas numbering with issue #17 (Aug. 1960), the title now featured a diminutive yet confident, soft-spoken fast gun constantly underestimated by bullying toughs, varmints, owlhoots, polecats, crooked saloon owners and other archetypes squeezed through the prism of Lee & Kirby's anarchic imagination. As in the outsized, exuberantly exaggerated action of the later-to-come [[World War II]] series ''[[Nick Fury|Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commandos]]'', ''The Rawhide Kid'' was now a freewheeling romp of energetic, almost slapstick action across cattle ranches, horse troughs, corrals, canyons and swinging chandeliers. Stringently moral, the Kid nevertheless showed a gleeful pride in his shooting and his acrobatic fight skills — never picking arguments but constantly forced to surprise lummoxes far bigger than he.

Through [[retcon]], bits of and pieces of the Atlas and Silver Age characters' history meshed, so that the unnamed infant son of settlers the Clay family, orphaned by a [[Cheyenne]] raid, was raised by [[Texas Ranger]] Ben Bart on a ranch near Rawhide, Texas. Older brother Frank Clay, captured by Indians, eventually escaped and became a [[gambling|gambler]], while eldest brother Joe Clay became sheriff of the town of Willow Flats; neither were in the regular cast, and each died in a guest appearance. Shortly after Johnny's 18th birthday, Ben Bart was murdered; Johnny, an almost preternaturally fast and accurate gunman, wounded the killers and left them to be taken into custody. A later misunderstanding between the Kid and a sheriff over a cattle rustler the Kid wounded in self-defense led to the hero's life as a fugitive.

Kirby continued as [[penciler]] through #32 (Feb. 1963) — remarkably, while helping to launch the [[Fantastic Four]], the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and other iconic characters of the "Marvel revolution" — and drew covers through issue #47. Issues #33-35 were drawn by [[EC Comics]] great [[Jack Davis (cartoonist)|Jack Davis]] and some of the very last color comics he would draw before gaining fame at [[MAD Magazine]] and as one of the 20th century's leading [[caricature|caricaturists]]. After several issues by stalwart Ayers, followed by a single issue by longtime ''Kid Colt'' artist [[Jack Keller (comics)|Jack Keller]], Stan Lee's brother [[Larry Lieber]] — who'd previously scripted the first appearances of "[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|The Mighty Thor]]", "[[Iron Man|The Invincible Iron Man]]" and other superhero features plotted by Lee — began his long, solid run as writer-artist of the much-liked, albeit minor series.

As superheroes become increasingly ascendant and sales of all companies' Western titles dropped, ''The Rawhide Kid'' became primarily a reprint title, though often bearing new covers by such top artists as [[Gene Colan]], [[Gil Kane]] and [[Paul Gulacy]]. It ended publication with issue #151 (May 1979).

The Rawhide Kid later appeared as a more middle-aged character in a four-issue [[limited series]] (Aug.-Nov. 1985) by writer [[Bill Mantlo]] and [[penciler]] [[Herb Trimpe]].

==2000s treatments==
The Rawhide Kid reappeared in the four-issue [[limited series]] ''[[Blaze of Glory (comics)|Blaze of Glory]]'' (2000), by writer [[John Ostrander]] and [[artist]] [[Leonardo Manco]], and a 2002 four-issue sequel, ''[[Apache Skies]]'', by the same creative team.

In contrast to the character's standard look till then — a small-statured, clean-cut redhead — these latter two series found him grizzled, taller, with shoulder-length dark hair, and wearing a slightly less stylized, more historically appropriate outfit than his classic one. In fact, ''Blaze of Glory'' specifically [[retconned]] that the naively clean-cut Marvel Western stories of years past were merely [[dime novel]] fictions of the characters' actual lives.

A [[controversy|controversial]] 2003 limited series from Marvel's [[MAX (comics)|MAX]] [[imprint]], the five-issue ''Rawhide Kid'' (the story itself titled "Slap Leather"), written by [[Ron Zimmerman]] and drawn by veteran artist [[John Severin]], depicted the character as a [[stereotype|stereotypical]] [[homosexual]], with a good portion of the dialogue dedicated to blatant innuendo. The series was labelled "Parental Advisory Explicit Content".

==Quotes==
'''Larry Lieber''' on ''The Rawhide Kid'': "I don't remember why I wanted to do it, particularly. I think I wanted a little more freedom. I didn't do enough of the superheroes to know whether I'd like them. What I didn't prefer was the style that was developing. It didn't appeal to me.... Maybe there was just too much humor in it, or too much something. ... I remember, at the time, I wanted to make everything serious. I didn't want to give a light tone to it. When I did ''Rawhide Kid'', I wanted people to cry as if they were watching ''[[High Noon]]'' or something.

"I'm a little unclear about leaving the superheroes and going to Rawhide Kid. I know that at the time I wanted — what's the expression? — a little space for myself or something, and I wanted to do a little drawing again."<ref>[http://www.twomorrows.com/alterego/articles/02lieber.html "A Conversation with Artist-Writer Larry Lieber"], conducted by former Marvel editor-in-chief [[Roy Thomas]], ''[[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]]'' vol. 3, #2 (Fall 1999)</ref>
