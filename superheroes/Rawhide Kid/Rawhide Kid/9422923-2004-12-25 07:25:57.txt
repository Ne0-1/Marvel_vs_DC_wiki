'''Rawhide Kid''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[cowboy]] in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  The Rawhide Kid is one of Marvel's most prolific [[Western fiction|Western]] characters, rivalled only by the [[Two-Gun Kid]], [[Kid Colt]] and the original [[Ghost Rider]] (later renamed the [[Phantom Rider]]).

A recent [[controversy|controversial]] series in the [[MAX (comics)|Marvel MAX]] imprint, ''Rawhide Kid: Slap Leather'', revealed him to be [[gay]].  Although the series was labelled "Parental Advisory Explicit Content", the series was actually quite tame and [[kitsch]]y.
