Superboy was originally simply [[Superman]] as a youth, and was essentially treated as a junior version of Superman.  To that end, Superboy wore the Superman costume and his alter ego Clark Kent wore glasses as a disguise for his civilian identity.  The character was created without the permission of Superman's creators, [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]], a fact which increased an already-growing rift between them and the publisher, DC Comics.

Superboy first appeared in ''[[More Fun Comics]]'' #101 (1944), and the feature soon moved to ''[[Adventure Comics]]''.  In 1949 Superboy was given his own self-titled comic-book.  It was at this point that a supporting cast began to grow up around the character.  The only major characters to appear in the early years were Jonathan and Martha (or "Ma and Pa") Kent.  The 8th issue of ''Superboy'' saw the first adventure of "Superbaby," a character which extended the "Junior Superman" concept to that of a super-powered toddler.  The 10th issue of ''Superboy'' featured the first appearance of [[Lana Lang]], a character which would become a romantic foil for both Superboy and for the grown-up Superman.  In the early 1960s, Clark Kent's best friend Pete Ross and Smallville Police Chief Parker rounded out the supporting cast.

Beginning in ''Superboy'' #2, the adventures of Superboy took place in [[Smallville]], USA, a town whose exact location was never specified in the Superboy stories, though it was usually placed close to [[Metropolis (Superman)|Metropolis]] (Smallville was placed in [[Kansas]] a few years after the original Superboy character ceased to be published, but Smallville's location, like other [[fictional cities]], is not permanent).

In the earliest stories, the time period in which Superboy's adventures were set was never clearly defined, with some adventures seemingly taking place in the same year the story was published (one example being a 1952 story with Lana Lang participating in a "Miss Smallville of 1952" contest).  In the late 1950s, Superman comic editor [[Mort Weisinger]] decided to place all of Superboy's adventures in an early-to-mid-1930s setting (in light of Superman's first comic appearance being in 1938).  In the early 1970s, the Superboy writing staff decided to "update" Superboy by setting his book on a "floating [[timeline]]," taking place perpetually 15 years or so behind whatever the then-current year was; this resulted in the 1970s stories featuring Superboy being set in the 1950s.  Starting with the debut in 1980 of a new Superboy comic, the Boy of Steel's era was moved up again, to take place in the late 1960s/early 1970s.

Some of Superman's foes, such as the [[Phantom Zone villains]], made their first appearance in Superboy stories, and some (such as [[Mr. Mxyzptlk]]) also appeared as younger versions of themselves in the Superboy stories.  The most famous example of this is the young [[Lex Luthor]].  In a story purporting to reveal the origin of the enmity between Luthor and Superman, Lex Luthor was a teenage boy the same age as Superboy, and the two became best friends after Lex moved to Smallville.  Superboy built a fully-stocked laboratory for Lex in order for the latter to conduct his experiments, while Lex searched for a cure for Superboy's weakness to Kryptonite.  However, when a fire in Lex's lab forced Superboy to destroy an important experiment Lex was working on in order to save his life, the chemicals used caused Lex to lose all of his hair.  Lex blamed Superboy for destroying his experiment and his hair loss, accusing the Boy of Steel of jealousy over his brilliance, with Lex swearing to prove to the world that he was superior to Superboy.  Lex did this by trying to implement a series of scientific quality-of-life improvements for Smallville's residents; however, each invention of Lex's wound up backfiring, resulting in the needed intervention of Superboy.  This series of setbacks, along with the earlier lab accident, resulted in Lex deciding to dedicate his life to destroying Superboy.  Thereafter, Lex Luthor and Superboy were arch-enemies.

A Superboy story called "The Legion of Super-Heroes" in a 1958 issue of ''Adventure Comics'' featured three super-powered teenagers from the 30th century who offered Superboy membership in their super-hero club, the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]].  Although this was intended as nothing more than a one-shot tale, the characters went on to spin off into their own series in ''Adventure Comics'' beginning in 1962.  In the [[1970s|early 1970s]] the ''Superboy'' comic began regularly featuring the Legion until the title was officially renamed first ''Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes'' and finally ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' in 1980, ousting Superboy from the comic altogether.  It was the most successful spin-off of the Superman titles and has endured throughout various incarnations over the years.

A new series called ''New Adventures of Superboy'' ran from 1980 to 1984, and a four-issue miniseries called ''Superman: The Secret Years'' (featuring Superboy in his junior year of college, and how he changed his name to Superman) was published in 1985, after which the character of Superboy was discarded from Superman's [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] after the 1985-1986 miniseries ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' and writer [[John Byrne]]'s 1986 revamp of Superman's origin.

==The Pocket Universe Superboy==
Following Byrne's revamp, a new version of Superboy was briefly used as a means of patching the Legion of Super-Heroes' continuity, which was undermined by Byrne's removal of Superman's Superboy career.  This version of Superboy was based on the pre-Crisis version, but was a resident of an alternate "pocket" universe created by Legion enemy the [[Time Trapper]].  However, this Superboy was soon killed (as seen in ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' (volume 3) #38).

==The Modern Superboy (Kon-El)==
{{main|Kon-El}}

A new Superboy, a [[human cloning|clone]] grafted with Superman's [[DNA]] (as opposed to a younger version of Superman), was introduced in 1993.  His initial abilities were based on a form of tactile telekinesis by which he could fly and simulate Superman's strength and durability to some extent. In recent comics, Superboy has begun to display more Kryptonian-style superpowers, including heat vision and x-ray vision. 

His initial incarnation was that of  a [[stereotype|stereotypical]] irreverent teenager, and in his early stories he seemed at least as interested in women and licensing his image as crimefighting; however, as Superboy's character has developed, he has matured considerably.

In ''Teen Titans'' (volume 3) #1, it was revealed that Superboy had been been created from both Superman's and Lex Luthor's DNA.

==The Hypertime Superboy==
During the situation known as ''[[Zero Hour]]'', Kon-El encountered a version of Superboy similar to the pre-Crisis version.  This was due to temporal disruptions involving what's now known in the DC Universe as [[Hypertime]]. Eventually, this version of Superboy vanished, reverting to his own alternate timeline.

Later, during a trip thru Hypertime, Kon-El once again encountered this version of Superboy when finding himself in this version's reality.  During this visit, Kon-El discovered this Superboy was a young Clark Kent, and by this means realized his own Superman must also be the adult Clark Kent. After returning to the mainstream DCU, Kon-El revealed to Superman he now knew his [[secret identity]].

==The Earth-Prime Superboy==

The Earth-Prime Superboy (also known as "Superboy Prime") was introduced during the ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' storyline, in ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' #87.

This Superboy came from the alternate Earth of [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Earth-Prime]], where Superman and the other DC superheroes only existed as fictional characters, and was the adopted son of a family named Kent who thought it would be amusing to name their new infant son "Clark".

What the Kents didn't know was that the baby, found abandoned in a forest, was actually a young Kal-El, who (in that reality) had been teleported to Earth moments before the planet Krypton exploded.

For years young Clark lived as a normal boy, through his mid-teens. One night, while Clark was attending a costume party dressed as Superboy, his Kryptonian powers suddenly manifested themselves (with the passing of [[Halley's Comet]]), at approximately the same time as meeting the Earth-One Superman, who had found his way into Earth-Prime's reality. The Earth-Prime Superboy soon joined Superman in the fight against the [[Anti-Monitor]], with Earth-Prime soon destroyed due to the effects of the Crisis. At the end of the Crisis, Superboy joined [[Alexander Luthor|Alex Luthor]] of Earth-Three and the Lois Lane and [[Kal-L|Superman of Earth-Two]] in a "paradise dimension."

Recently, however, the four were revealed to have been watching the DC Universe since they entered the dimension.  Unhappy with what they've been seeing, they decided to take action.  Superman of Earth-Two broke open a portal himself back to the main DC Universe, and the four have returned, making themselves known to some of the current DC characters, and suggesting that the current DC Universe is in need of being replaced with a "better world".  What role Superboy-Prime will play in the current ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' storyline remains to be seen.

{{spoiler}}

As of ''Infinite Crisis'' #3, Superboy-Prime has crossed the line from heroism to villany. Jealous of [[Kon-El]] for  living the life he never had, Superboy-Prime has allied with Alexander Luthor in a plot to alter the current [[DC Universe|DC universe]]. After the [[Justice League]] Watchtower had been blown apart by a mysterious entity, [[Batman]] managed to recover data from the Watchtower's [[black box]], and discovered that Superboy-Prime was the culprit. He's currently the trusted executor of Alex's orders, the only one to know about the Vibrational Fork built by the Earth-Three former hero, even beating and kidnapping the [[Martian Manhunter]] and [[Power Girl]] for the sake of the mysterious plan.

==Adaptations in other media==
