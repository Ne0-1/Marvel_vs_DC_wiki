'''Superboy''' is the name of several [[fictional characters]], [[DC Comics]] superheroes, most of them youthful incarnations of [[Superman]]. 

The first, and arguably best-known, Superboy was simply [[Superman]] as an [[adolescent]], acting as a superhero in his hometown of [[Smallville]]. The character was featured in several series from the [[1940s]] until the [[1980s]] and developed a mythos and [[supporting character|supporting cast]] of his own, including parents [[Martha Kent|Ma]] and [[Jonathan Kent|Pa Kent]], love interest [[Lana Lang]] and the [[time travel]]ing allies the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]].

When DC rewrote much of its [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] in 1985, Superman’s history was changed so that he never took a costumed identity until adulthood, erasing Superboy, although not all aspects of the backstory created in Superboy comics, from the current [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] history of Superman.

Still, the character was adapted into a [[Superboy (TV series)|''Superboy'' television series]] (1988&ndash;1992) and a teenaged Clark Kent, secretly using his powers in heroic acts, appears in the highly successful ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'' TV series (2001&ndash;present), drawing to a great extent on the present comicbook continuity in its depicting of young Clark's life.

In 1993, DC introduced a [[Superboy (Kon-El)|new, modernized Superboy]], a teenaged [[Clone (genetics)|clone]] of both Superman and [[Lex Luthor]], who was featured in an eponymous series from 1994 until 2002. 

Due to DC Comics’ complex [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|“Multiverse”]], several other Superboys have appeared, most notable of which is the mentally unstable [[Superboy-Prime]].
==Character history==
===Kal-El, the original Superboy===
Originally, Superboy was simply [[Superman]] as a youth and was essentially treated as a junior version of Superman. To that end, Superboy wore the Superman costume and his alter ego Clark Kent wore glasses as a disguise for his civilian identity. The character was created without the permission of Superman's original writer, [[Jerry Siegel]], a fact which increased an already-growing rift between him and the publisher, DC Comics.

Superboy first appeared in ''[[More Fun Comics]]'' #101 (1944), and the feature soon moved to ''[[Adventure Comics]]''. In 1949 Superboy was given his own self-titled comic-book. It was at this point that a supporting cast began to grow up around the character. The only major characters to appear in the early years were Jonathan and Martha (or "Ma and Pa") Kent. The 8th issue of ''Superboy'' saw the first adventure of "Superbaby," a character which extended the "Junior Superman" concept to that of a super-powered toddler. The 10th issue of ''Superboy'' featured the first appearance of [[Lana Lang]], a character that would become a romantic foil for both Superboy and for the grown-up Superman. In the early 1960s, Clark Kent's best friend Pete Ross and Smallville Police Chief Parker rounded out the supporting cast.

===Setting===
Superboy lives on 321 Maple Street. Beginning in ''Superboy'' #2, the adventures of Superboy took place in [[Smallville]], USA, a town whose exact location was never specified in the Superboy stories, though it was usually placed closer to [[Metropolis (Superman)|Metropolis]] (Smallville was placed in [[Kansas]] a few years after the original Superboy character ceased to be published, but Smallville's location, like other [[fictional cities]], is not permanent).

In the earliest stories, the time period in which Superboy's adventures were set was never clearly defined, with some adventures seemingly taking place in the same year the story was published (one example being a 1952 story with Lana Lang participating in a "Miss Smallville of 1952" contest).  In the late 1950s, Superman comic editor [[Mort Weisinger]] decided to place all of Superboy's adventures in an early-to-mid-1930s setting (in light of Superman's first comic appearance being in 1938). In the early 1970s, the Superboy writing staff decided to "update" Superboy by setting his book on a "floating [[timeline]]," taking place perpetually 15 years or so behind whatever the then-current year was; this resulted in the 1970s stories featuring Superboy being set in the 1950s. Starting with the debut in 1980 of a new Superboy comic, the Boy of Steel's era was moved up again, to take place in the late 1960s/early 1970s. This also explain Superman's shifting age within his comic book, and this was basically retroactive slide rule.

===Enemies of Superboy===
Some of Superman's foes, such as the [[Phantom Zone villains]], made their first appearance in Superboy stories, and some (such as [[Mr. Mxyzptlk]]) also appeared as younger versions of themselves in the Superboy stories. The most famous example of this is the young [[Lex Luthor]]. In a story purporting to reveal the origin of the enmity between Luthor and Superman, Lex Luthor was a teenage boy the same age as Superboy, and the two became best friends after Lex moved to Smallville. Superboy built a fully-stocked laboratory for Lex in order for the latter to conduct his experiments, while Lex searched for a cure for Superboy's weakness to Kryptonite. However, when a fire in Lex's lab forced Superboy to destroy an important experiment Lex was working on in order to save his life, the chemicals used caused Lex to lose all of his hair. Lex blamed Superboy for destroying his experiment and his hair loss, accusing the Boy of Steel of jealousy over his brilliance, with Lex swearing to prove to the world that he was superior to Superboy. Lex did this by trying to implement a series of scientific quality-of-life improvements for Smallville's residents; however, each invention of Lex's wound up backfiring, resulting in the needed intervention of Superboy. This series of setbacks, along with the earlier lab accident, resulted in Lex deciding to dedicate his life to destroying Superboy. Thereafter, Lex Luthor and Superboy were arch-enemies.

===Legion of Super-Heroes===
A Superboy story called "The Legion of Super-Heroes" in a 1958 issue of ''Adventure Comics'' featured three super-powered teenagers from the 30th century who offered Superboy membership in their super-hero club, the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]. Although this was intended as nothing more than a one-shot tale, the characters went on to spin off into their own series in ''Adventure Comics'' beginning in 1962. In the 1970s, the ''Superboy'' comic began regularly featuring the Legion until the title was officially renamed first ''Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes'' and finally ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' in 1980, ousting Superboy from the comic altogether. It was the most successful spin-off of the Superman titles and has endured throughout various incarnations over the years.

A new series called ''The New Adventures of Superboy'' ran from 1980 to 1984, and a four-issue miniseries called ''Superman: The Secret Years'' (featuring Superboy in his junior year of college, and how he changed his name to Superman) was published in 1985. Shortly after this miniseries was published, a Superboy career was discarded from Superman's [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] after the 1985-1986 [[limited series]] ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' and writer [[John Byrne]]'s 1986 revamp of Superman's origin, ''[[The Man of Steel (comic book)|The Man of Steel]]'', a decision Byrne would later regret.<ref>[http://www.byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=2&T1=Questions+about+Comic+Book+Projects#143 Why did JB remove Superboy from continuity with the MAN OF STEEL reboot? -- Byrne Robotics: FAQ]</ref>

==Post-Crisis appearances==

From 1989 to 1991, DC Comics published a new comic series based on the TV series ''[[Superboy (TV series)|Superboy]]'' (1988-1992). Its intent was to explore some of the unseen tales and events that the TV show's 26 half-hour episodes a year could not do, and would be based entirely on the TV show, but would tackle all-new adventures. The series was originally titled: ''[[Superboy: The Comic Book]]'', from #1 -10 (only the covers bearing that title; the book was simply officially titled as ''Superboy'' in the indicia). After issue #11, the series changed its cover title (as the TV show had done) to ''The Adventures of Superboy'' (but the comic book was not officially renamed under that title until issue #19, in the book's indicia information) as well as displaying a short-white box next to the title (logo) which read "As Seen on TV." The series concluded in a "One-Shot" Special, which wrapped up all the adventures and stories from the previous issues as having been daydream fantasies from the 'post-crisis' young Clark Kent. None of them had actually taken place, only in his imagination. It became a kind of companion piece to John Byrne's ''Man of Steel'' mini-series. 

===Pocket Universe===

Following John Byrne's revamp of Superman, a new version of Superboy was introduced as a means of patching the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]' continuity, which was undermined by the removal of [[Kal-El]]'s Superboy career. The new Superboy was said to have come from a Pocket Universe (created by a Legion enemy, the [[Time Trapper]]), who also wished to ensure his existence was preserved. This Superboy's history was much like that of the Pre-Crisis Earth-One (until the intervention of [[Phantom Zone]] criminals)ad his departure into the 30st century. The Pocket Universe Superboy was soon killed (as seen in ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' (volume 4) #38, taken by [[Neil Gaiman]]'s [[Death (DC Comics)|Death]]).

After the event known as [[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]], the original Legion were said to have come from a different timeline. 

A new Legion was then re-introduced as a part of the new post-Zero Hour timeline, with their origin being retold.  This version was said to have never interacted with the teenaged [[Clark Kent]], but rather with the modern clone Kon-El/Superboy.  Their main inspiration was said to have been [[Lar Gand]] of Daxam rather than a young Kal-El of Krypton. 

The Legion of Super-Heroes was revamped again later, retconning the second version as having come from yet another alternate timeline due to the shifting nature of DC's present. It is unknown if the third and current, revamped version of the Legion will ever meet a teenaged Clark Kent or a Superboy akin to the classic version using [[Hypertime]] as an explanation. While it remains possible, as [[Mark Waid]] (who introduced [[Grant Morrison]]'s creation of Hypertime in ''[[The Kingdom (comics)|The Kingdom]]''), is the current writer of the series, DC Comics editor-in-chief [[Dan DiDio]] said stories published in the near future will not re-visit the concept of Hypertime again. Nevertheless, recent titles have shown [[Supergirl]] interacting with this Legion.

===Zero Hour and Hypertime===
During the 1994 storyline known as ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]'', Conner Kent, the [[Superboy (Kon-El)|modern Superboy]], encountered a version of Superboy exactly like the original pre-crisis earth-one version, who had resurfaced due to temporal disruptions involving what's now known in the DC Universe as [[Hypertime]]. Eventually, this Superboy seemingly vanished, reverting to his own alternate timeline.

However, during a later trip through Hypertime, Kon-El accidentally once again discovered this Superboy while finding himself in that version's reality. During this visit, Kon-El discovered that this Superboy was a young Clark Kent, and by this means realized the Superman of his timeline must therefore be an adult Clark Kent. After returning to the mainstream DCU, Kon-El revealed to Superman that he now knew his [[secret identity]].

==Modern incarnations==
===Superboy-Prime===

{{main|Superboy-Prime}}

A version of Superboy was created in 1985 just before ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', who came from the parallel Earth known as [[Earth Prime|Earth-Prime]], where Superman and the other DC superheroes only existed as fictional characters.  At the end of the Crisis, Superboy joined [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]] of [[Earth-Three]] and the [[Lois Lane]] and [[Kal-L|Superman of Earth-Two]] in a "paradise dimension" which the tunnel was contained inside of Alexander Luthor. In DC's ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' miniseries, Superboy-Prime, Alex Luthor, and Superman and Lois Kent of Earth-Two were revealed to have been watching the DC Universe since they entered the "paradise dimension". Unhappy with what they've been seeing, they decided to take action, and returned to the post-Crisis DC Universe.

Superboy-Prime inspired [[Kurt Busiek]]'s miniseries ''[[Superman: Secret Identity]]'', a story about a man who exists in the "real world", where Superman is a fictional character and there are no superheroes. He is named Clark Kent after the comic book character and discovers he possesses powers similar to Superman.

===Kon-El, the modern Superboy===
{{main|Superboy (Kon-El)}}
[[Image:Connerkent.png|thumb|175px|right|Kon-El. Art by [[Mike McKone]] from Teen Titans #7.]]
A new Superboy, a [[human cloning|clone]] created to replace the seemingly dead Superman (as opposed to a younger version of Superman), was introduced in 1993. His initial abilities were based on a form of telekinesis ''(known as "tactile telekinesis")'' by which he could fly and simulate Superman's strength and invulnerability. He was spun off to his own series, which ran for 100 issues until it was cancelled following a drop in sales after a change in story direction by DC writer [[Joe Kelly]]. "The Kid" was created by [[Project Cadmus]]; most of the series had him living in Hawaii. Prior to Kelly's run, the character lived at Cadmus with reintroduced concepts originally created by [[Jack Kirby]]. 

Under Kelly's direction, Superboy attempted to update his trendiness to the opposite sex and the public, while deciding to move on to other things as Cadmus faced a shutdown by the US government. After Kelly's departure, Jimmy Palmiotti and Dan Didio co-wrote Superboy, and gave Superboy a new direction as the superintendent for a slum apartment building in a Metropolis ghetto area called "Suicide Slum". Sales improved but the book was cancelled nonetheless. 

Initially it had been thought Kon-El was created only from the genetically engineered human DNA of Cadmus Project director Paul Westfield.  Later it was revealed that Superboy had been created from both Superman's and the human DNA.  Westfield's DNA, however, had been replaced with that of Lex Luthor, and the developing clone brainwashed so that Luthor could have a sleeper agent among the superhero community.  This eventually led to near disaster, but Superboy eventually became free of Luthor's control.  Luthor, however, continued to at least claim that he viewed Kon-El as his son.

===Infinite Crisis===
In ''Infinite Crisis'' #7, [[Alexander Luthor]] finds that New Earth's history has changed once again, and there are several reports of Superman's activities prior to his first appearance in Metropolis.  In a 'flash-forward' scene in ''Justice League of America'' #0, Superman fills up the tunnel leading from his bedroom, much like the pre-crisis Silver Age Superboy used.  When asked about the status of Superboy in New Earth, Dan Didio and Geoff Johns replied "keep reading" at several comic cons, including the San Diego Comic Con, and Wizard World Chicago 2006.

In ''Superman'' #656 it is revealed that during Clark Kent's youth, there were reports throughout midwestern America of a 'super-boy' peforming super-powered good deeds, but quickly disappearing, no one getting a good look at him.  It seems this was indeed young Clark, but nothing has been said about him having used the familiar costume in that role. His actions may simply have been similar to what's seen on the show [[Smallville]], namely young Clark secretly using his abilities to help out where needed. Although continuity is no longer based on the Man of Steel or Birthright explanations, a true Superboy career would possibly complicate previous stories, resulting in large retcons.

==Legal status==
Superboy is currently the subject of a legal battle between Time Warner, the owner of [[DC Comics]] and the estate of [[Jerry Siegel]]. The Siegels argue that the creator of "Superboy" was an independent contractor at the time of the original Superboy pitch, and DC wasn't interested.  After returning from World War II, Siegel found that DC published a Superboy story using ideas from his original pitch.

Federal judge Ronald S. W. Lew issued a summary judgment ruling that the Siegel heirs had the right to revoke their copyright assignment to Superboy and had successfully reclaimed the rights as of [[November 17]], 2004. Warner Bros. replied that it "respectfully disagrees" with the ruling and will appeal.

===Consequences of the ruling===
*The ruling throws into question the ownership of ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'' episodes that have run since that date.{{fact}} At stake is a potentially sizable portion of profits from the ''Smallville'' TV program.{{fact}} Though Lew himself feels that ''Smallville'' infringes on the Superboy copyright, he has ruled that a jury will make the official decision.{{fact}}
*DC Comics may have been forced to kill off Superboy in ''[[Infinite Crisis]]''. [http://www.newsarama.com/SDCC06/DC/52/52Panel.html At the San Diego Comicon], however, Dan Didio and ''52'' editor Steve Wacker remarked the death of the modern Superboy (Kon-El) was not implemented because of the verdict, but for dramatic purposes, seeing as the character could simply have been renamed.
*The ''[[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)|Legion of Super Heroes]]'' cartoon was originally going to feature Superboy, but the ruling forced Warner Brothers to change it to "a young Superman".

==Adaptations in other media==
The Superboy character has made the transition to [[television]] and [[film]] on multiple occasions, both in live action and [[animated series]].

*''[[The Adventures of Superboy]]'' ([[1961]]) - television series (though only a [[pilot episode|pilot]] was produced)
*''Superboy'' ([[1966]]) - film by [[Andy Warhol]]
*''[[The Adventures of Superboy (animated series)|The Adventures of Superboy]]'' ([[1966]]&ndash;[[1969]]) - series of 34 six-minute Superboy adventures (his first animated appearances) that appeared as part of three different programs during that time, packaged with similar shorts featuring other DC Comics superheroes.
*''[[Superfriends]]'' - Superboy makes two appearances in the show's run.  The first one is when the Hall Of Justice computer runs a tape showing Lex Luthor's origin.  The other is in a short episode where [[Phantom Zone]] criminals go back in time to fight Superboy.  He's saved by the arrival of Superman and Hal Jordan/[[Green Lantern]].
*''[[Superboy (TV series)|Superboy]]'' ([[1988]]&ndash;[[1992]]) - television series starring [[John Haymes Newton]] (1988&ndash;[[1989]]) and [[Gerard Christopher]] (1989&ndash;1992), and [[Stacy Haiduk]] as Lana Lang
*''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'' ([[2001]]&mdash;) - television series starring [[Tom Welling]]; though not actually a "Superboy" series, this series stars a teenaged Clark Kent and features many aspects originally present in the Superboy mythos.
*''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' - In the episode [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episodes_of_Justice_League#First_season_2 Kid Stuff], [[Morgaine le Fey (DC Comics)|Morgan le Fay]] transforms [[Superman]], [[Batman]], [[Wonder Woman]], and [[John Stewart (comics)|Green Lantern]] into 8-year-olds after [[Mordred]] uses his magic to remove all adults from Earth.  While not referred to as Superboy, eight-year-old Superman is at the same age that young Clark Kent assumed the career in the comics.
*A "young Superman" appears in the ''[[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)|Legion of Super Heroes]]'' animated series. [http://news.toonzone.net/article.php?ID=9249][http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/news/networktv/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002384275] The original press releases stated Superboy would be featured. Due to legal issues, among other things, the "Teen of Steel" is now referred to on the series as "Superman". This version of the character comes from the time shortly before he left Smallville for Metropolis.
*'''[[Gladiator (Shi'ar)|Gladiator]]''' of the [[Shi'ar Imperial Guard]] is based partly on Superboy. The Shi'ar Imperial Guard, as a whole was created as an [[homage]]/[[parody]] of the Legion of Super-Heroes.
