'''Superboy''' is the name of several [[fictional characters]] that have been published by [[DC Comics]], most of them youthful incarnations of [[Superman]]. These characters have also been the main characters of four ongoing ''Superboy'' comic book series published by DC.

The first, and arguably best-known, Superboy was simply [[Superboy (Kal-El)|Superman as a boy]], acting as a superhero in [[Smallville (DC Comics)|Smallville]], where '''Kal-El''' (Superboy's [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonian]] name) lives under his [[secret identity]], '''[[Clark Kent]]'''. The character was featured in several series from the 1940s until the 1980s, with long runs appearing in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' and two eponymous series, ''Superboy'' and ''The New Adventures of Superboy''. He developed a mythos and [[supporting character|supporting cast]] of his own, including foster parents [[Ma and Pa Kent]], love interest [[Lana Lang]], and [[time travel]]ing allies the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]].

When DC Comics rewrote much of its [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] in 1986, Superman’s history was changed so that he never took a costumed identity until adulthood, erasing Superboy from the [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] history of Superman, although many aspects of the backstory created in Superboy comics, such as Clark's friendship with Lana Lang, remained. In the last few years, some additional features of Superboy's history, such as his tenure in the Legion, have also been reintroduced into the story of Superman's youth.

The character was adapted into a [[Superboy (TV series)|''Superboy'' television series]] (1988&ndash;1992), which also spawned another, short-lived ''Superboy'' comic book series; and a teenage Clark Kent, secretly using his powers in heroic acts, appears in the highly successful ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'' TV series (2001&ndash;present), drawing to a great extent on the comic book continuity in its depiction of young Clark's life.

In 1993, DC introduced a [[Superboy (Kon-El)|new, modernized Superboy]], a teenage [[Clone (genetics)|clone]] of both Superman and [[Lex Luthor]], also known by his Kryptonian name '''Kon-El''' and his secret identity as Clark's cousin, '''Conner Kent'''. The new Superboy was featured in his own series, ''Superboy'' (volume 3), from 1994 until 2002, and in several series devoted to teenage superhero groups. He is currently featured in DC's relaunch of ''[[Adventure Comics#Revival|Adventure Comics]]''.

Due to DC Comics’ complex [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]], several other Superboys have appeared over time, with the most notable being the mentally unstable [[Superboy-Prime]].

==Character history==

{{Main|Superboy (Kal-El)}}
[[Image:Superboy mfc101.jpg|thumb|180px|left|First appearance of Superboy. Art by [[Joe Shuster]] from ''More Fun Comics'' #101.]]
The original pitch for a "Superboy" character was made by [[Jerry Siegel]] (without [[Joe Shuster]]) in November 1938. The idea was turned down by [[DC Comics|Detective Comics, Inc.]],<!--believing the comic book audience would not be interested in a younger version of Superman,--> and the publisher again rejected a second, more detailed pitch by Siegel two years later.<ref name="sblegal0707">[http://www.trexfiles.com/superboy_0727.pdf Trexfiles: The latest Superboy/Superman copyright decision PDF file]. See pages 1-5 for early Superboy publication history.</ref> After the appeal of kid superheroes had been demonstrated by the success of [[Robin (comics)|Robin, the Boy Wonder]] and similar characters, Detective Comics reversed itself in late 1944 and started publishing a Superboy feature, in an effort to expand the Superman franchise by presenting a version of the character to whom younger readers could easily relate.<ref name="mileds">''Millennium Edition More Fun Comics'' #101 (2000) and ''Millennium Edition Superboy'' #1 (2001), inside cover commentaries</ref> Superboy first appeared in ''[[More Fun Comics]]'' #101 (1944, with a 1945 cover date). Though Joe Shuster supplied the art, the Superboy feature was published without the input or approval of Jerry Siegel, who was serving in [[World War II]]. This fact increased an already-growing rift between the publisher and Siegel and Shuster.<ref name="sblegal0707"/>

====Superboy in ''Adventure Comics''====
In early 1946, Superboy moved to ''[[Adventure Comics]]'', where he debuted in issue #103 (Apr 1946) as the lead feature for the [[anthology]] comic, and he remained the headlining feature for over 200 issues. Stories in ''Adventure Comics'' treat Superboy as essentially a junior version of Superman. To that end, he wears the Superman costume and his alter ego Clark Kent wears glasses as a disguise for his civilian identity. Superboy is the superhero of Clark's hometown of [[Smallville (DC Comics)|Smallville]] and grows up under the guidance of his foster parents, [[Ma and Pa Kent]]. Superboy's adventures in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' include the story of how he was reunited with his pet superdog, [[Krypto]];<ref name="adv210">''Adventure Comics'' #210 (Mar 1955)</ref> the story of how his friend, the teenage scientist [[Lex Luthor]], becomes his most bitter foe;<ref name="adv271">''Adventure Comics'' #271 (Apr 1960)</ref> and how Superboy joins the 30th-century [[Legion of Super-Heroes]].<ref name="adv247">''Adventure Comics'' #247 (Apr 1958)</ref>

The popular Legion [[Spin-off (media)|spun off]] from Superboy into its own feature, which debuted in ''Adventure Comics'' #300 (Sep 1962). The feature soon dominated the comic and forced out original Superboy features,  with the last new Superboy story appearing in #315 (Dec 1963).  Superboy continued to appear in the comic in reprinted stories and as a member of the Legion until the Legion's final issue, ''Adventure Comics'' #380 (May 1969).

====''Superboy'' (volume 1) (1949-1977)====
Four years after his debut, Superboy became only the sixth DC superhero to receive his own comic book when ''Superboy'' #1 (Mar-Apr 1949) was published. The series became the first new DC superhero title to succeed since World War II. ''Superboy'' saw the debuts of the first Superbaby story,<ref name="sboy8">''Superboy'' #8 (May-Jun 1950)</ref> (about Clark's adventures as a super-powered toddler), and of Clark's two closest friends: [[Lana Lang]],<ref name="sboy10">''Superboy'' #10 (Sep-Oct 1950)</ref> who also serves as a romantic interest for Superboy; and [[Pete Ross]],<ref name="sboy86">''Superboy'' #86 (Jan 1961)</ref> who later discovers and helps protect Clark's secret identity.<ref name="sboy90">''Superboy'' #90 (Jul 1961)</ref> Other notable stories to appear in ''Superboy'' include the story of the first [[Bizarro]]<ref name="sboy68">''Superboy'' #68 (Oct 1958)</ref> and the first appearances of [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] members [[Lar Gand|Mon-El]]<ref name="sboy89">''Superboy'' #89 (Jun 1961)</ref> and [[Ultra Boy]].<ref name="sboy98">''Superboy'' #98 (Jul 1968)</ref>

After the Legion pushed new Superboy stories out of ''Adventure Comics'' in 1963, ''Superboy'' became the only comic book to feature original Superboy stories. Less than two years after the Legion itself left ''Adventure Comics'', ''Superboy'' became the Legion's new home. Starting with ''Superboy'' #172 (Mar 1971), the Legion appeared as an occasional backup feature. Once again, the Legion feature proved so popular that by ''Superboy'' #197 (Sep 1973), the Legion had become the lead feature, and with the next issue, the title's only feature. Although from issue #197, the cover logo read "Superboy starring the Legion of Super-Heroes" ("and" replaced "starring" with #222), the official title (shown in the indicia) of the comic remained ''Superboy'' until #231 (Sep 1977), when the comic became ''Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes''. In issue #259 (Jan 1980), Superboy left the Legion and his name was dropped from the title altogether, which now became simply ''The Legion of Super-Heroes''. Though Superboy still periodically appeared in the series that once bore his name, the series remained a Legion title until its final issue, #354, in 1987.

====''The New Adventures of Superboy'' (1980-1984)====
After the Legion took over ''Superboy'', the Superboy feature was nearly moribund until the late 1970s, when it appeared in two short runs, first in ''Adventure Comics'' (again) and then in ''[[Superman Family]]''. Then, in the same month Superboy left the Legion in ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' #259 (Jan 1980), a new series entitled ''The New Adventures of Superboy'' debuted, with the first issue depicting Clark Kent celebrating his sixteenth birthday. Published monthly, this title lasted for 54 issues until 1984. Between issues #28 (Apr 1982) and #49 (Jan 1984), the series also featured "[[Dial H for Hero]]" as a backup. 

Several months after the last issue of ''The New Adventures of Superboy'', a four-issue miniseries was published called ''Superman: The Secret Years'' (1985), which tells the story of how Superboy becomes Superman during his junior year of college.

====Continuity changes====
Shortly after the miniseries was published, Superboy's career was discarded from Superman's [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] after the 1985-1986 [[limited series]] ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' and writer [[John Byrne]]'s 1986 revamp of Superman's origin, ''[[The Man of Steel (comic book)|The Man of Steel]]''.<ref>[http://www.byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=2&T1=Questions+about+Comic+Book+Projects#143 Why did JB remove Superboy from continuity with the MAN OF STEEL reboot?&mdash;Byrne Robotics: FAQ]</ref> Twenty years later, following the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' limited series, some elements of Superboy's history were restored to the story of Superman's youth (see the [[#Infinite Crisis|Infinite Crisis]] subsection).

===Post-Crisis appearances of Superboy (Kal-El)===
====The Legion's Superboy====
[[Image:SuperboyPocket.jpg|thumb|right|Superboy from the Pocket Universe.]]
Following John Byrne's revamp of Superman, a new version of Superboy was introduced as a means of patching the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]' continuity, which was undermined by the removal of Kal-El's Superboy career. This Superboy is said to have been created by the [[Time Trapper]], one of the Legion's greatest enemies, when he notices that the great youthful hero they take inspiration from does not start his career until he is an adult. So the Trapper takes a sliver of time from the ancient universe and uses it to craft a "pocket universe" in which Earth and Krypton are the only inhabited planets. Whenever the Legionnaires travel back in time, they travel to the 20th century of the Pocket Universe, not the main DC Universe. From birth until the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', Superboy's life is similar to the life of the original Superboy. When the universe-destroying ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]]'' strikes, Superboy lacks the power to save his Earth, but the Time Trapper can do so, provided Kal-El helps him capture the Legion. Superboy reluctantly agrees. After a battle with the post-''Crisis'' [[Superman]], Superboy realizes he can't turn on his friends and instead helps the Legionnaires defeat the Trapper. Using a device the Trapper employed to stave off Earth's destruction, Superboy saves his Earth, but only at the cost of his own life. His dying act is to return the Legion to their century (and Earth), where he is later buried.<ref name="lsh37">''Legion of Super-Heroes'' vol. 3 #37-38 (1987), ''Superman'' vol. 2 #8 (1987) and ''Action Comics'' #591 (1987)</ref> Later editorial mandates that removed Superboy from the history of the Legion<ref name="legcomp1">Cadigan, Glen: ''The Legion Companion'', pages 194 (interview with Keith Giffen) and 201 (interview with Tom Bierbaum), TwoMorrows Publishing: Raleigh, NC, 2003.</ref> led to a story where the Time Trapper is apparently erased from history, wiping the Pocket Universe and that universe's Superboy from existence.<ref name="lsh4">''Legion of Super-Heroes'' vol. 4 #4 (1990)</ref>

====''Superboy: The Comic Book'' (1990-1992)====
{{Main|Superboy: The Comic Book}}

From 1989 to 1991, DC Comics published a comic series based on the TV series ''[[Superboy (TV series)|Superboy]]'' (1988–1992) about a college-age Superboy. Originally entitled ''Superboy'' (volume 2) (as shown in the indicia), the cover logo read ''Superboy: The Comic Book'' from #1-10. From issue #11, the series changed its cover title (as the TV show had done) to ''The Adventures of Superboy'' (although the comic book was not officially renamed under that title until issue #18). as well as displaying a short-white box next to the title (logo) which read "As Seen on TV." After 22 regular issues, the series concluded in a one-shot special published in 1992 that wrapped up adventures and stories from previous issues and depicted them as having been the daydreams of the young post-''Crisis'' Clark Kent.<ref name="aosbsp1">''The Adventures of Superboy Special" #1 (1992)</ref>

====Zero Hour and Hypertime====
During the 1994 storyline known as ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]'', Kon-El, the [[Superboy (Kon-El)|modern Superboy]], encounters a version of the [[Superboy (Kal-El)|original Superboy]], who resurfaces due to temporal disruptions involving [[Hypertime]]. This Superboy soon seemingly vanishes, returning to his own alternate timeline.<ref name="sb8">''Superboy'' vol. 3 #8 (1994)''</ref>

During a [[Superboy (Kon-El)#Superboy in Hypertime|later trip]] through Hypertime, Kon-El accidentally discovers this Superboy while finding himself in that version's reality. During this visit, Kon-El discovers that this Superboy is a young Clark Kent, and by this means realizes the Superman of his reality must therefore be an adult Clark Kent.<ref name="sb62">''Superboy'' vol. 3 #62 (1999)</ref> Sometime after returning to the main DC Universe, Kon-El reveals to Superman that he now knows his [[secret identity]].<ref name="soy:sby">''Sins of Youth: Superman Jr & Superboy Sr." (2000)</ref>

====Infinite Crisis====
In the aftermath of the events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.|Alexander Luthor]] finds that Earth's history has changed once again and in particular, he notes that there are several reports of Superman's activities prior to his first appearance in Metropolis.<ref name="ic7">''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #7 (2006)</ref> Later comics have made some of the changes in the history of Kal-El's youth explicit. A year after ''Infinite Crisis'', a cinematic Superman retrospective states that young Kal-El gave rise to "a rarely-glimpsed American myth--the mysterious Super-Boy."<ref name="sm650">''Superman'' #650 (2006)</ref> Fourteen-year old Clark Kent is depicted using his superpowers to save lives in secret, wearing no costume other than his everyday clothes, much like the [[Clark Kent#Smallville|Clark Kent]] of the ''[[Smallville (TV Series)|Smallville]]'' TV series.<ref name="actan10">''Action Comics Annual'' #10 (2007)</ref>  

Several concepts and plot points associated with the original Superboy and ''Smallville'' have been reintroduced into post-''Infinite Crisis'' continuity as part of Superman's earlier years. As a teenager, Clark assists stranded space traveler [[Lar Gand|Mon-El]], whom he first believes to be his older brother from Krypton, in a story that is similar to Mon-El's first appearance in ''Superboy'' #89 (1961).<ref name="actan10"/> [[Krypto]] has been revealed as a companion to Clark in his youth.<ref name="act854">''Action Comics'' #854 (2007)</ref> Clark also joins the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]; Superman later recalls that "the Legion used to visit between school days. We had adventures in the future between classes."<ref name="act858">''Action Comics'' #858 (2007)</ref> As an adult, Superman still keeps a Legion flight ring and has statues of the Legion on display in the Fortress of Solitude.<ref name="jsa5">''Justice Society of America'' #5-6 (2007)</ref> 

[[Lex Luthor]]'s adolescence in Smallville, first as Superboy's friend and then his foe, was one of the elements of Superman's history removed by the ''[[The Man of Steel (comic book)|The Man of Steel]]''. Post-''Infinite Crisis'', a short biography has established that once again "Lex Luthor spent much of his teenage years in Smallville",<ref name="cd34">''[[Countdown to Final Crisis|Countdown]]'' #34 (2007)</ref> where he meets Lana Lang, Pete Ross, and Clark Kent, who befriends him.<ref name="act850">''Action Comics'' #850 (2007)</ref>  Unlike the Superboy story,<ref name="adv271" /> Lex does not lose his hair in a disfiguring lab accident that he blames on Clark. Rather, when he leaves Smallville "under a cloud of rumor and suspicion", he still has a full head of hair.<ref name="cd34"/> 

These aspects of Superman's [[History of Superman#The Silver Age|pre-1986 history]] have been restored, while many of the changes brought about by ''[[The Man of Steel (comic book)|The Man of Steel]]'', such as the survival of Clark's foster parents into his adulthood and his revelation to Lana about his powers, remain part of his story. Since ''Infinite Crisis'', while Clark has been depicted as having a youthful (if somewhat secretive) career as a superhero, he has not been depicted in costume—at least in his own time. As a member of the futuristic Legion, the teenage Clark does sport a "Superman" costume,<ref name="jsa6">''Justice Society of America'' #6 (2007)</ref> which he apparently begins wearing during his first adventure with the Legion.<ref name="act863">In a flashback sequence in ''Action Comics'' #863 (2008), after his first visit with the Legion, Clark returns to his own time wearing his costume under his everyday clothes.</ref> The Legion co-feature in the first issue of the revived ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' reveals that when Clark does join the Legion, he is known as Superboy.<ref name="adv1">''[[Adventure Comics]]'' (vol. 3) #1 (2009)</ref>

An upcoming miniseries, ''[[Superman: Secret Origin]]'', has been announced for release in 2009.  This series promises to outline Superman's origin as it stands post-''Infinite Crisis''.  His involvement as a young man with the Legion of Super-Heroes is one of the topics to be addressed.<ref name="secretorigin">[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/110828-Geoff-Secret-Origin.html Geoff Johns: Telling Superman's Secret Origin], [[Newsarama]], November 28, 2008</ref>

===Superboy-Prime===
{{Main|Superboy-Prime}}
[[Image:Dcp87p.jpg|thumb|left|Superboy-Prime's first appearance, in ''DC Comics Presents'' #87 (1985). Art by Eduardo Barreto.]]
In 1985, during the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] event, another Superboy was created. This Superboy hails from the parallel Earth known as [[Earth Prime|Earth-Prime]], where Superman and the other DC superheroes only exist as fictional comic book characters.<ref name="dccp87">''DC Comics Presents'' #87 (1985)</ref> Brought over from his dimension by [[Superman]] to aid in the universe-spanning battle at the heart of the Crisis, Superboy helps the [[Earth-Two]] [[Superman (Kal-L)]] defeat the [[Anti-Monitor]], the villain who spawned the Crisis. With their home dimensions destroyed, Superboy, Superman of Earth-Two, his wife [[Lois Lane]], and [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]] of [[Earth-Three]] journey to a "paradise dimension".<ref name="crisis12">''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' #12 (1986)</ref> In DC's 2006 ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' miniseries, Superboy, Alex, Kal-L and Lois are revealed to have been watching the DC Universe since they entered this "paradise". Unhappy with what they have been seeing, they decide to take action, and return to the post-''Crisis'' DC Universe. 

Superboy-Prime quickly becomes a supervillain. Feeling that this world's heroes were inferior, he feels no qualms about committing wanton acts of destruction, kidnapping, and murder. In the end, Superboy-Prime is pulled into the core of a red sun by both Superman of Earth-Two and Superman (Kal-El) of the main DC Universe. They crash land on [[Mogo]], the [[Green Lantern]] that is a living planet. Under a red sun, their powers rapidly vanish. On Mogo, Superboy-Prime beats the Earth-Two Superman to death before he is defeated by Kal-El. The [[Green Lantern Corps]] put Superboy-Prime in a maximum-security prison on their home world of Oa and guard him round-the-clock. While incarcerated, he carves the "S"-symbol into his chest and vows to escape.<ref name="ic7"/> 

One year later, Superboy is released from his prison by the newly-formed [[Sinestro Corps]] and joins them, becoming one of their heralds and wearing a Sinestro Corps uniform beneath his Anti-Monitor inspired armor.<ref name="glsc">''Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps Special'' #1 (2007)</ref> Now calling himself [[Superman Prime]], he becomes involved in the war between the Sinestro Corps and the [[Green Lantern Corps]]<ref name="tscsp">''Tales of the Sinestro Corps: Superman-Prime'' #1 (2008)</ref> and later in the events of ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]''. In the ''[[Final Crisis: Legion of Three Worlds]]'' miniseries, Prime leads an expanded [[Legion of Super-Villains]] into battle against [[Superman]] and versions of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] from three parallel Earths in the 31<sup>st</sup> century.<ref name="gjl3w1">[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/080722-Legion3Worlds.html Newsarama: GEOFF JOHNS - MORE ON LEGION OF 3 WORLDS]</ref>

====''Superman: Secret Identity''====
The Superboy-Prime character was the inspiration for [[Kurt Busiek]]'s miniseries ''[[Superman: Secret Identity]]'', which begins as a story about a teenage boy, named Clark Kent after the comic book character, who exists in the "real world" where there are no superheroes and discovers that he possesses powers similar to Superman's. In the first press reports about Clark's life-saving super-deeds, the press refers to Clark (whose identity is unknown) as "Superboy."<ref name="ssi1">''[[Superman: Secret Identity]]'' #1 (2004)</ref>

===Kon-El===
{{Main|Superboy (Kon-El)}}
[[Image:Connerkent.png|thumb|175px|right|Kon-El. Art by [[Mike McKone]] from Teen Titans #7.]]
In 1993, during [[DC Comics]]'s ''[[Death of Superman]]'' story, a new Superboy was introduced.<ref name="aos500">''Adventures of Superman'' #500 (1993)</ref> Unlike previous characters bearing the name, this Superboy is a [[human cloning|clone]] created to replace the seemingly-dead Superman, rather than simply being an adolescent Clark Kent. His initial abilities are based on a form of [[telekinesis]] (known as [[tactile telekinesis]]) by which he could fly and simulate Superman's strength and invulnerability. Nicknamed "the Kid", Superboy is distinguished from other "Supermen" who appear after the [[The Death of Superman|death of Superman]] by his youth and brash character. Though he prefers to be called Superman during the [[The Death of Superman#Reign of the Supermen!|Reign of the Supermen]], after Superman returns from the dead the Kid accepts the name Superboy for himself<ref name="aos506">''Adventures of Superman'' #506 (1993)</ref> and begins his own superhero career. He also learns that he is not a clone of Superman, but rather genetically-engineered from the human DNA of Paul Westfield, director of the government sector known as [[Project Cadmus]] that had created the Kid.<ref name="aos506"/> 

====''Superboy'' (volume 3) (1994-2002)====
Superboy then received his own series, the third series from DC Comics simply entitled ''Superboy''. In ''Superboy'' #1 (Feb 1994), Superboy settles in [[Hawaii]] with his supporting cast, becoming Hawaii's resident superhero for the next four years, until ''Superboy'' #48 (Feb 1998). Starting in ''Superboy'' #56 (Nov 1998), Superboy returns "home" when he begins working for Project Cadmus, the same project that created him. In ''Superboy'' #59 (Feb 1999), Superman gives him the [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonian]] name Kon-El, in effect making him part of the El family. After leaving Project Cadmus and living on his own for a brief time in Metropolis, in ''Superboy'' #100 (Jul 2002), the final issue of the series, at Superman's suggestion Kon-El goes to live with [[Ma and Pa Kent|Martha and Jonathan Kent]] in [[Smallville (DC Comics)|Smallville]], where he adopts a secret identity as their nephew (and Clark's cousin) Conner Kent.

====Teen Titans====
In the course of his career, Kon-El becomes involved with several teen superhero groups, notably the [[Superboy and the Ravers|Ravers]], [[Young Justice]], the [[Teen Titans#Teen Titans (vol. 3, 2003 - present)|Teen Titans]], and the [[Legion of Super-Heroes#Rebooted (1994-2004)|Legion of Super-Heroes]], and he was featured in comic series devoted to these groups. Through his association with them in both Young Justice and the Teen Titans, Kon-El becomes the best friend of [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Robin]], the Boy Wonder, a close friend of [[Bart Allen|Impulse (later Kid Flash)]], and becomes romantically involved with [[Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark)|Wonder Girl]]. 

Sometime before he joins the Teen Titans, Superboy learns that he had been actually created from the DNA of both Superman and a human. Though he had believed that human to be Paul Westfield, after he joins the Teen Titans he learns that the human is actually Superman's [[archnemesis]] [[Lex Luthor]].<ref name="tt1">''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #1 (2003)</ref> Moreover, as the clone Superboy was developing, he was brainwashed so that Luthor could have a sleeper agent among the superhero community. When Luthor unleashes Kon-El, Superboy comes close to destroying the Teen Titans, but he manages to free himself from Luthor's control before any tragedy occurs.<ref name="tt24">''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #24-25 (2005)</ref> Shortly thereafter, Kon-El sacrifices his life to save Earth in a battle with Superboy-Prime during the [[Infinite Crisis]].<ref name="ic6">''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #6</ref> After his death, statues are erected in his honor in [[Metropolis]] and [[Titans Tower]]. Though he coerced Superboy into serving his own purposes, Luthor continues to claim that he views Kon-El as his son.

In a story published after Kon-El's death, the alternate future Titans known as the [[Titans Tomorrow]], including an older Conner who was cloned from the original, come back in time to the present day.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #50 (2007)</ref>

====''Adventure Comics'' (volume 2)====
During the [[Legion of 3 Worlds]] storyline, [[Brainiac 5]] resurrects Conner in the 31st Century after arranging for him to spend 1000 years in the Kryptonian regeneration chamber that revived Superman after his battle with Doomsday and introducing into it a living hair from Lex Luthor.<ref name="fcl3w4">''Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds'' #4 (2009)</ref> In the aftermath of ''Legion of 3 Worlds'', Conner is back in the present, living with Martha Kent and Krypto in Smallville.<ref name="adv1" /> Currently, Superboy stars in his own feature in the revival of ''[[Adventure Comics#Revival|Adventure Comics]]'', which began publication in August 2009.

*Other versions:

====All Star Superman====
During an adventure in Smallville while he is still a youth, Clark Kent of ''[[All Star Superman]]'' is aided by the time-spanning Superman Squad featuring the present Superman in disguise as the Unknown Superman, [[Superman (Kal Kent)|Kal Kent]], and the 5th-dimension Superman. While aiding the Squad, Clark misses a chance to save the life of Jonathan Kent.<ref name="assm6">''All Star Superman #6''</ref>

In writing about the version of Superman in his series, writer [[Grant Morrison]] said, "Ma & Pa Kent—one dead. We're going with the version where Pa Kent has died. That's the day Superboy becomes a man."<ref name="gmquote">[http://superman.nu/a/ges/all-star/ Grant Morrison on ''All Star Superman''] at [http://superman.nu Superman.nu]</ref> Dialogue between several characters implies that young Clark is a costumed adventurer, but he is never referred to as "Superboy".<ref name="assm6"/>

==Legal status==
{{Out of date|date=August 2009}}
The Superboy character is currently the subject of a legal battle between Time Warner, the owner of [[DC Comics]], and the estate of [[Jerry Siegel]]. The Siegel estate claims that the original "Superboy" character published by DC Comics is an independent creation that used ideas from Jerry Siegel's original rejected pitch and was created without his consent.<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/DC/Superman/SuperboyCompl.htm Newsarama: THE BATTLE FOR THE BOY]</ref> 

On April 4, 2006, Federal judge Ronald S. W. Lew issued a [[summary judgment]] ruling that Jerry Siegel's heirs had the right to revoke their copyright assignment to Superboy and had successfully reclaimed the trademark to the name as of November 17, 2004. Warner Bros. replied that it "respectfully disagrees" with the ruling and will appeal.<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=7054 Comic Book Resources: JUDGE SAYS SIEGELS OWN SUPERBOY. WILL IT AFFECT "SMALLVILLE?"]</ref> Since the ruling, the name "Superboy" has rarely been used in print to refer to any version of the character. 

On July 27, 2007, the courts ruled in favor of Warner Bros' decision to appeal the previous ruling and dismissed some of the Siegel estate's claims about the Superboy character.<ref name="sblegal0707">[http://www.trexfiles.com/superboy_0727.pdf Trexfiles: The latest Superboy/Superman copyright decision PDF file]</ref><ref>[http://titanstowermonitor.blogspot.com/2007/08/superboy-case-update.html TitansTower.com: Superboy case update]</ref> The trial for the dispute over the Superman copyright was expected to begin on May 13, 2008,{{old fact}} with the trial for the Superboy copyright dispute to begin some time afterwards.<ref>[http://www.trexfiles.com/2007/09/the_latest_on_the_supermansupe.html Trexfiles: The latest on the Superman/Superboy Siegel lawsuits]</ref><ref>[http://blog.newsarama.com/2007/09/24/the-latest-on-the-supermansuperboy-lawsuits/ Blog@Newsarama: The latest on the Superman/Superboy lawsuits]</ref>

The legal dispute affected DC Comics' treatment of the various incarnations of Superboy, such as in the ''[[Secret Origins|Secret Origin of the Teen Titans]]'' back-up story in the weekly ''[[52 (comic book)|52]]'' limited series, where an illustration of Superboy was changed into [[Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark)|Wonder Girl]].<ref>[http://www.horhaus.com/weblogs/archives/v3/000427.html Horhaus: This is a job for...Wonder Girl?]</ref> In the ''[[Sinestro Corps War]]'' storyline in the [[Green Lantern]] titles and in the ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]'' limited series, the Superboy-Prime character was then known as [[Superman-Prime]], a development that came about in part because of the legal dispute.<ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=130914 Newsarama.com: A SINESTRO CORPS WAR REPORT].</ref>  Additionally, other stories, such as those in [[Teen Titans]], then referred to the modern version of Superboy as "Conner" or "Kon-El."

On June 28, 2008, [[Dan Didio]] said in reference to [[Final Crisis: Legion of Three Worlds|Legion of Three Worlds]] at the [[Wizard_Entertainment#Conventions|Wizard World Chicago]] convention, “We’ve got [[Geoff Johns|Geoff]], we’ve got [[George Perez|George]], we’ve got SuperBOY Prime (yes, we can say that again).”<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/080628-WWCDCCrisisPanel.html Newsarama.com: WWC: DCU: Crisis Panel Report]</ref>

In July 2009, Didio explained in the "DC Nation" column featured in the back of certain DC titles that [[Final Crisis: Legion of Three Worlds]] #4 "returned Conner to the land of the living, while Legion of Three Worlds #5 ... resolves the issue of the multiple Legions once and for all", and that in August DC would revive "Adventure Comics Starring Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes", with additional pages split-featuring Superboy and the Legion in separate stories.

The legal issues regarding the character may also be a factor in the decision by Warner Bros. not to release any further seasons of the syndicated ''[[Superboy (TV series)|Superboy]]'' TV series beyond season 1 to DVD; the first season was issued in 2006 at about the time the legal wrangling began. Warner, for its part, indicated in a Sept. 18, 2008 chat<ref>http://www.hometheaterforum.com/chat/chat.html</ref> that sales of season 1 weren't strong enough to justfy further releases.

==Adaptations in other media==
The Superboy character has made the transition to [[television]] on multiple occasions, both in live action and [[animated series]].

*''[[The Adventures of Superboy]]'' (1961): television series (though only a [[pilot episode|pilot]] was produced).
*''[[The Adventures of Superboy (TV series)|The Adventures of Superboy]]'' (1966&ndash;1969): series of 34 six-minute Superboy adventures (his first animated appearances) that appeared as part of three different programs during that time, packaged with similar shorts featuring other DC Comics superheroes. He was voiced by [[Bob Hastings]].
*''[[Super Friends]]'': Superboy makes two appearances in the show's run. The first one is when the Hall Of Justice computer runs a tape showing Lex Luthor's origin. He was voiced by [[Danny Dark]]. The other is in a short episode where [[Phantom Zone]] criminals go back in time to fight Superboy. He is saved by the arrival of Superman and [[Green Lantern (Hal Jordan)|Green Lantern]]. He was voiced by [[Jerry Dexter]].
*''[[Superboy (TV series)|Superboy]]'' (1988&ndash;1992): television series about Superboy (Clark Kent) during his college years. The series starred [[John Haymes Newton]] (1988&ndash;1989) and [[Gerard Christopher]] (1989&ndash;1992), and [[Stacy Haiduk]] as Lana Lang.
*The cloned [[Kon-El|Superboy]] appears in the video game ''[[The Death and Return of Superman]]'' as a playable character.
*''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'' (2001&mdash;): television series starring [[Tom Welling]]; though not a "Superboy" series by name, this series started with a teenage Clark Kent (a freshman in High School) and features many elements originally present in the Silver Age Superboy comics. Additionally, in a first season episode, Clark accidentally transfers his powers to a classmate named Eric Summers, who, before running amok with his newfound powers, is called "Superboy" by the local newspaper. 
*A "young Superman" appears in the ''[[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)|Legion of Super Heroes]]'' animated series. [http://news.toonzone.net/article.php?ID=9249][http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/news/networktv/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002384275] The original press releases stated Superboy would be featured. Due to the aforementioned legal issues, the "Superboy" character was instead referred to on the series as "Superman". This version of the character comes from the time shortly before Clark leaves Smallville for Metropolis. The second season takes place about two years after the first and features both an older Clark and a [[Superman X|Superman clone from the 41st century]], who has alien DNA and enhanced superpowers, as Legion members.<ref name="nr0807">[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=127093  Animated Shorts: Kids WB!'s Fall Line-Up, South Park, Robot Chicken and More] at [http://newsarama.com/ NEWSARAMA]</ref>
