'''Superboy''' is the name of several [[fictional characters]] that have been published by [[DC Comics]], most of them youthful incarnations of [[Superman]]. 

The first, and arguably best-known, Superboy was simply [[Superboy (Kal-El)|Superman as a boy]], acting as a superhero in [[Smallville (DC Comics)|Smallville]], where Kal-El (Superboy's [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonian]] name) lives under his [[secret identity]], [[Clark Kent]]. The character was featured in several series from the [[1940s]] until the [[1980s]] and developed a mythos and [[supporting character|supporting cast]] of his own, including foster parents [[Ma and Pa Kent]], love interest [[Lana Lang]] and the [[time travel]]ing allies the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]].

When DC Comics rewrote much of its [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] in 1986, Superman’s history was changed so that he never took a costumed identity until adulthood, erasing Superboy from the [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] history of Superman, although many aspects of the backstory created in Superboy comics, such as Clark's friendship with Lana Lang, remained. In the last few years, some additional features of Superboy's history, such as his tenure in the Legion, have been reintroduced into the story of Superman's youth.

The character was adapted into a [[Superboy (TV series)|''Superboy'' television series]] (1988&ndash;1992) and a teenage Clark Kent, secretly using his powers in heroic acts, appears in the highly successful ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'' TV series (2001&ndash;present), drawing to a great extent on the comic book continuity in its depiction of young Clark's life.

In 1993, DC introduced a [[Superboy (Kon-El)|new, modernized Superboy]], a teenage [[Clone (genetics)|clone]] of both Superman and [[Lex Luthor]], also known by his Kryptonian name Kon-El and his secret identity as Clark's cousin, Conner Kent. The new Superboy was featured in his own eponymous series from 1994 until 2002, and in several series devoted to teenage superhero groups. 

Due to DC Comics’ complex [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]], several other Superboys have appeared, with the most notable being the mentally unstable [[Superman-Prime|Superboy-Prime]], who is now known as Superman-Prime.

==Character history==
===Kal-El===
{{main|Superboy (Kal-El)}}
[[Image:Superboy mfc101.jpg|thumb|200px|right|First appearance of Superboy. Art by [[Joe Shuster]] from ''More Fun Comics'' #101.]]
The original pitch for a "Superboy" character was originally made by [[Jerry Siegel]] (without [[Joe Shuster]]) in November 1938. The idea was turned down by [[DC Comics|Detective Comics, Inc.]],<!--believing the comic book audience would not be interested in a younger version of Superman,--> and the publisher again rejected a second, more detailed pitch by Siegel two years later.<ref name="sblegal0707">[http://www.trexfiles.com/superboy_0727.pdf Trexfiles: The latest Superboy/Superman copyright decision PDF file]. See pages 1-5 for early Superboy publication history.</ref> After the appeal of kid superheroes had been demonstrated by the success of [[Robin (comics)|Robin, the Boy Wonder]] and similar characters, Detective Comics reversed itself in late 1944 and started publishing a Superboy feature, in an effort to expand the Superman franchise by presenting a version of the character to whom younger readers could easily relate.<ref name="mileds">''Millennium Edition More Fun Comics'' #101 (2000) and ''Millennium Edition Superboy'' #1 (2001), inside cover commentaries</ref> Superboy first appeared in ''[[More Fun Comics]]'' #101 (1944, with a 1945 cover date). Though Joe Shuster supplied the art, the Superboy feature was published without the input or approval of Jerry Siegel, who was serving in [[World War II]]. This fact increased an already-growing rift between the publisher and Siegel and Shuster.<ref name="sblegal0707"/>

In early 1946, Superboy moved to ''[[Adventure Comics]]'', where he debuted in issue #103 as the lead feature for the [[anthology]] comic, and he remained the lead for over 200 issues. Superboy received his own series, ''Superboy'', in 1949, where again he was the lead feature for nearly 200 issues. Stories in both comics treat Superboy as essentially a junior version of Superman. To that end, he wears the Superman costume and his alter ego Clark Kent wears glasses as a disguise for his civilian identity. Superboy is the superhero of Clark's hometown, [[Smallville (DC Comics)|Smallville]], where he grows up under the guidance of [[Ma and Pa Kent]]; has two close friends, [[Lana Lang]] and [[Pete Ross]], in both identities, and a pet superdog, [[Krypto]]; befriends and then battles a teenage [[Lex Luthor]];<ref name="adv271">''Adventure Comics'' #271 (1960)</ref> and joins the 30th-century [[Legion of Super-Heroes]].<ref name="adv247">''Adventure Comics'' #247 (1958)</ref>

The popular Legion feature, a [[spin-off]] from Superboy, eventually bumped the Superboy feature from both ''Adventure Comics'' (in the 1960s) and, after the Legion left ''Adventure'', from ''Superboy'' itself (issues #197-198, 1973). In both cases, Superboy continued to appear in the comic series as a Legion member. When Superboy left the Legion in 1980, he got a second series called ''The New Adventures of Superboy'', which ran for 54 issues until 1984. A four-issue miniseries called ''Superman: The Secret Years'' (1985) tells the story of how Superboy became Superman during his junior year of college. 

Shortly after the miniseries was published, Superboy's career was discarded from Superman's [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] after the 1985-1986 [[limited series]] ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' and writer [[John Byrne]]'s 1986 revamp of Superman's origin, ''[[The Man of Steel (comic book)|The Man of Steel]]''.<ref>[http://www.byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=2&T1=Questions+about+Comic+Book+Projects#143 Why did JB remove Superboy from continuity with the MAN OF STEEL reboot?&mdash;Byrne Robotics: FAQ]</ref> Twenty years later, following the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' limited series, some elements of Superboy's history were restored to the story of Superman's youth (see the [[#Infinite Crisis|Infinite Crisis]] subsection).

===Post-Crisis appearances of Superboy (Kal-El)===
====The Legion's Superboy====
[[Image:SuperboyPocket.jpg|thumb|right|Superboy from the Pocket Universe.]]
Following John Byrne's revamp of Superman, a new version of Superboy was introduced as a means of patching the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]' continuity, which was undermined by the removal of Kal-El's Superboy career. This Superboy is said to have been created by the [[Time Trapper]], one of the Legion's greatest enemies, when he notices that the great youthful hero they take inspiration from does not start his career until he is an adult. So the Trapper takes a sliver of time from the ancient universe and uses it to craft a "pocket universe" in which Earth and Krypton are the only inhabited planets. Whenever the Legionnaires travel back in time, they travel to the 20th century of the Pocket Universe, not the main DC Universe. From birth until the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', Superboy's life is similar to the life of the original Superboy. When the universe-destroying ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]]'' strikes, Superboy lacks the power to save his Earth, but the Time Trapper can do so, provided Kal-El helps him capture the Legion. Superboy reluctantly agrees. After a battle with the post-''Crisis'' [[Superman]], Superboy realizes he can't turn on his friends and instead helps the Legionnaires defeat the Trapper. Using a device the Trapper employed to stave off Earth's destruction, Superboy saves his Earth, but only at the cost of his own life. His dying act is to return the Legion to their century (and Earth), where he is later buried.<ref name="lsh37">''Legion of Super-Heroes'' vol. 3 #37-38 (1987), ''Superman'' vol. 2 #8 (1987) and ''Action Comics'' #591 (1987)</ref> Later editorial mandates that removed Superboy from the history of the Legion<ref name="legcomp1">Cadigan, Glen: ''The Legion Companion'', pages 194 (interview with Keith Giffen) and 201 (interview with Tom Bierbaum), TwoMorrows Publishing: Raleigh, NC, 2003.</ref> led to a story where the Time Trapper is apparently erased from history, wiping the Pocket Universe and that universe's Superboy from existence.<ref name="lsh4">''Legion of Super-Heroes'' vol. 4 #4 (1990)</ref> (See [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] and [[Supergirl (Matrix)]] for more about the history of Legion continuity and the story of the Pocket Universe.)

====''Superboy: The Comic Book''====
From 1989 to 1991, DC Comics published a comic series based on the TV series ''[[Superboy (TV series)|Superboy]]'' (1988-1992) about a college-age Superboy. The series was originally titled ''[[Superboy: The Comic Book]]'', from #1-10 (only the covers bearing that title; the book was simply officially titled as ''Superboy'' in the indicia). After issue #11, the series changed its cover title (as the TV show had done) to ''The Adventures of Superboy'' (but the comic book was not officially renamed under that title until issue #19, in the book's indicia information) as well as displaying a short-white box next to the title (logo) which read "As Seen on TV." The series concluded in a one-shot special which wrapped up adventures and stories from previous issues and depicted them as having been the daydreams of the young post-''Crisis'' Clark Kent.<ref name="aosbsp1">''The Adventures of Superboy Special" #1</ref>

====Zero Hour and Hypertime====
During the 1994 storyline known as ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]'', Kon-El, the [[Superboy (Kon-El)|modern Superboy]], encounters a version of the [[Superboy (Kal-El)|original Superboy]], who resurfaces due to temporal disruptions involving [[Hypertime]]. This Superboy soon seemingly vanishes, returning to his own alternate timeline.<ref name="sb8">''Superboy'' vol. 3 #8 (1994)''</ref>

During a [[Superboy (Kon-El)#Superboy in Hypertime|later trip]] through Hypertime, Kon-El accidentally discovers this Superboy while finding himself in that version's reality. During this visit, Kon-El discovers that this Superboy is a young Clark Kent, and by this means realizes the Superman of his reality must therefore be an adult Clark Kent.<ref name="sb62">''Superboy'' vol. 3 #62 (1999)</ref> Sometime after returning to the main DC Universe, Kon-El reveals to Superman that he now knows his [[secret identity]].<ref name="soy:sby">''Sins of Youth: Superman Jr & Superboy Sr." (2000)</ref>

====Infinite Crisis====
In the aftermath of the events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.|Alexander Luthor]] finds that Earth's history has changed once again and in particular, he notes that there are several reports of Superman's activities prior to his first appearance in Metropolis.<ref name="ic7">''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #7 (2006)</ref> Later comics have made some of the changes in the history of Kal-El's youth explicit. A year after ''Infinite Crisis'', a cinematic Superman retrospective states that young Kal-El gave rise to "a rarely-glimpsed American myth--the mysterious Super-Boy."<ref name="sm650">''Superman'' #650 (2006)</ref> Fourteen-year old Clark Kent is depicted performing super-deeds in secret, wearing no costume other than his everyday clothes (much like the [[Clark Kent#Smallville|Clark Kent]] of the ''[[Smallville (TV Series)|Smallville]]'' TV series).<ref name="actan10">''Action Comics Annual'' #10 (2007)</ref>  

Several concepts and plot points associated with the original Superboy have been reintroduced into post-''Infinite Crisis'' continuity as part of Superman's earlier years. Fourteen-year old Clark keeps his activities secret by using a tunnel leading from his bedroom, which is similar to the one the pre-''Crisis'' Silver Age Superboy used. He also assists stranded space traveler [[Lar Gand|Mon-El]], whom he first believes to be his older brother from Krypton, in a story that is similar to Mon-El's first appearance in ''Superboy'' #89 (1961).<ref name="actan10"/> [[Krypto]] has been revealed as a companion to Clark in his youth,<ref name="act854">''Action Comics'' #854 (2007)</ref> and young Clark joins a version of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]], wearing a Superman costume when he works with them in the future. As an adult, Superman still keeps a Legion flight ring and statues of the Legion on display within the Fortress of Solitude.<ref name="jsa5">''Justice Society of America'' #5-6 (2007)</ref>

Although many aspects of Superman's [[History of Superman#The Silver Age|Silver Age history]] have been restored, the current incarnation of Superman has not yet been referred to as "Superboy" (as opposed to "Super-Boy") in his youth.

===Superboy-Prime===
{{main|Superman-Prime}}
[[Image:Dcp87p.jpg|thumb|left|Superboy-Prime's first appearance, in ''DC Comics Presents'' #87 (1985). Art by Eduardo Barreto.]]
In 1985, during the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] event, another Superboy was created. This Superboy hails from the parallel Earth known as [[Earth Prime|Earth-Prime]], where Superman and the other DC superheroes only existed as fictional comic book characters.<ref name="dccp87">''DC Comics Presents'' #87 (1985)</ref> At the end of the Crisis, with his home dimension destroyed, Superboy joins [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]] of [[Earth-Three]] and the [[Earth-Two]] versions of [[Lois Lane]] and [[Superman (Kal-L)|Superman]] (named Kal-L) in a "paradise dimension".<ref name="crisis12">''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' #12 (1986)</ref> In DC's 2006 ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' miniseries, Superboy-Prime, Alex Luthor, Kal-L and Lois Lane are revealed to have been watching the DC Universe since they entered the "paradise dimension". Unhappy with what they had been seeing, they decide to take action, and return to the post-''Crisis'' DC Universe. 

Superboy-Prime quickly becomes a supervillain. Feeling that this world's heroes were inferior, he feels no qualms about committing wanton acts of destruction, kidnapping, and murder. In the end, Superboy-Prime is pulled into the core of a red sun by the Supermen of Earths One and Two, then they crash land on [[Mogo]], the [[Green Lantern]] that is a living planet. As they were under a red sun their powers rapidly vanish. While on Mogo, Superboy-Prime beats the Earth-Two Superman to death, but then is beaten by the Earth-One Superman. Superboy-Prime is later put in a maximum-security prison, guarded round-the-clock by a squadron of [[Green Lantern]]s. While incarcerated, he carves the "S"-symbol into his chest with what little power he has left, and vows to escape.<ref name="ic7">''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #7 (2006)</ref>

Superboy-Prime is released from his prison a year later by the newly formed [[Sinestro Corps]] and joins them, becoming one of the [[Anti-Monitor]]'s heralds and wearing the Sinestro Corps' uniform.<ref name="glsc">''Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps Special'' #1 (2007)</ref>
{{-}}

====Superman: Secret Identity====
The Superboy-Prime character was the inspiration for [[Kurt Busiek]]'s miniseries ''[[Superman: Secret Identity]]'', which begins as a story about a teenage boy, named Clark Kent after the comic book character, who exists in the "real world" where there are no superheroes and discovers that he possesses powers similar to Superman. In the first press reports about Clark's life-saving super-deeds, the press refers to Clark (whose identity is unknown) as "Superboy."<ref name="ssi1">''[[Superman: Secret Identity]]'' #1 (2004)</ref>

===Kon-El===
{{main|Superboy (Kon-El)}}
[[Image:Connerkent.png|thumb|175px|right|Kon-El. Art by [[Mike McKone]] from Teen Titans #7.]]
In 1993, during [[DC Comics]]'s ''[[Death of Superman]]'' story, a new Superboy was introduced.<ref name="aos500">''Adventures of Superman'' #500 (1993)</ref> Unlike previous characters bearing the name, this Superboy is a [[human cloning|clone]] created to replace the seemingly-dead Superman, rather than simply being an adolescent Clark Kent. His initial abilities were based on a form of [[telekinesis]] (known as [[tactile telekinesis]]) by which he could fly and simulate Superman's strength and invulnerability. Nicknamed "the Kid", Superboy was spun off to his own series, which ran for 100 issues (1994-2002). In issue #59 (1999) of the series, Superman gives him the [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonian]] name "Kon-El".

After Superman returns from the dead, Kon-El learns that he was genetically-engineered from the human DNA of Paul Westfield, director of a government sector known as [[Project Cadmus]].<ref name="aos506">''Adventures of Superman'' #506 (1993)</ref> Later, Superboy learns that he had been actually created from the DNA of both Superman and a human. However, the human was Superman's [[archnemesis]] [[Lex Luthor]], not Westfield.<ref name="tt1">''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #1 (2003)</ref> Moreover, as the clone Superboy was developing, he was brainwashed so that Luthor could have a sleeper agent among the superhero community. This eventually leads to near disaster, but Superboy eventually frees himself from Luthor's control.<ref name="tt24">''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #24-25 (2005)</ref> Luthor continues to claim that he views Kon-El as his son.

This version of Superboy becomes involved with several teen superhero groups, notably the Ravers, [[Young Justice]], the [[Teen Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]], and the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]], and was featured in comic series devoted to these groups. He is the best friend of [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Robin]], the Boy Wonder, and is romantically involved with [[Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark)|Wonder Girl]]. Kon-El later sacrifices his life in the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' series in a battle with Superboy-Prime.<ref name="ic6">''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #6</ref> After his death, statues are erected in his honor in [[Metropolis]] and [[Titans Tower]]. Robin is also secretly researching cloning techniques in order to clone a new Superboy.

In a current, ongoing story, the alternate future Titans known as the [[Titans Tomorrow]], including an older Conner who says that he was cloned from the original and grew up to become Superman, come back in time to the present day.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #50</ref>

===Alternate versions of Superboy===
Several other versions of Superboy originating from different parts of the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]] have also appeared in DC Comics.

*''Karkan'': In a 1972 [[Elseworlds#"Imaginary Stories"|imaginary story]], infant Kal-El lands in Africa and, like [[Tarzan]], is found and raised by [[gorilla]]s. As a teen, Karkan is found by an expedition to Africa and brought to Metropolis. When he finds that he can't adjust to "civilized" life, Karkan returns to the jungle.<ref name="sb183">''Superboy'' vol. 1 #183 and #188 (1972)</ref> Karkan also appeared in the "[[Superboy (Kon-El)#Superboy in Hypertime|Hypertension]]" story arc (1999).<ref name="sb60">''Superboy'' vol. 3 #60-64 (1999)</ref> 
*''Superboy'' of the ''Super Seven'': This [[Elseworlds]] version of Kon-El is one of the "Super Seven", a group of heroes which include [[Superman]], [[Batman]], [[Wonder Woman]], [[Wally West|Flash]], [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]], and a [[Lex Luthor]]/[[Metallo]] hybrid, who help humans fight off "The Horde", an alien race that occupies Earth.<ref name="sban1">''Adventures of Superman Annual'' #6 (1994) and ''Superboy Annual'' #1 (1994)</ref>
*''Superboy One Million'': The one millionth clone of Kon-El, he lives in the 853rd century and is a member of Justice Legions S, which consists exclusively of Superboy clones, and T, a future version of [[Young Justice]]. This Superboy is also known as Superboy OMAC, an acronym for "One Millionth Actual Clone" of Kon-El, and he resembles the original OMAC ([[One-Man Army Corps]]) in appearance. Superboy One Million was part of 1998's [[DC One Million]] [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] event. He reappeared the following year in "[[Superboy (Kon-El)#Superboy in Hypertime|Hypertension]]".<ref name="sb60"/>
*''Quetzal'': In a distant future on the colony world of Aztlan, Quetzal becomes the designated heir to Superman, who occupies a semi-divine position in this [[Aztec]]-like society. Realizing that "Superman" is corrupt, Superboy leads a rebellion against him.<ref name="sban3">''Superboy Annual'' #3 (1996)</ref>
*''Superboy'' of ''[[Superboy's Legion]]'': In this [[Elseworlds]] tale, the infant Kal-El is stranded in the [[Asteroid belt|Asteroid Belt]], and he remains there, in stasis, until found in 2987 by [[R. J. Brande]], a thousand years after Krypton's destruction. At the age of 14, "Kal Brande", also known as Superboy, joins [[Cosmic Boy]] and [[Saturn Girl]] in forming "Superboy's Legion", later known as the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]].<ref name="sl1">''Superboy's Legion'' #1-2 (2001)</ref>
*''Legion of Superboys'': Different versions of Superboy from throughout [[Hypertime]], including both Kon-El and Kal-El, team up in the unofficial "Legion of Superboys" to fight [[Black Zero (DC Comics)|Black Zero]] in the "[[Superboy (Kon-El)#Superboy in Hypertime|Hypertension]]" story arc.<ref name="sb60"/>

In addition, [[Marvel Comics]]' '''[[Gladiator (Shi'ar)|Gladiator]]''' of the [[Shi'ar Imperial Guard]] is based partly on Superboy. The Shi'ar Imperial Guard, as a whole, was created as an [[homage]]/[[parody]] of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]].

====All Star Superman====
During an adventure in Smallville while he is still a youth, Clark Kent of ''[[All Star Superman]]'' is aided by the time-spanning Superman Squad featuring the present Superman in disguise as the Unknown Superman, [[Superman (Kal Kent)|Kal Kent]], and the 5th-dimension Superman. While aiding the Squad, Clark misses a chance to save the life of Jonathan Kent.<ref name="assm6">''All Star Superman #6''</ref>

In writing about the version of Superman in his series, writer [[Grant Morrison]] said, "Ma & Pa Kent—one dead. We're going with the version where Pa Kent has died. That's the day Superboy becomes a man."<ref name="gmquote">[http://site.supermanthrutheages.com/History/all-star/ Grant Morrison on ''All Star Superman''] at [http://site.supermanthrutheages.com/welcome.php Superman Through the Ages]</ref> Dialogue between several characters implies that young Clark is a costumed adventurer, but he is never referred to as "Superboy".<ref name="assm6"/>

==Legal status==
The Superboy character is currently the subject of a legal battle between Time Warner, the owner of [[DC Comics]], and the estate of [[Jerry Siegel]]. The Siegel estate claims that the original "Superboy" character published by DC Comics is an independent creation that used ideas from Jerry Siegel's original rejected pitch and was created without his consent.<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/DC/Superman/SuperboyCompl.htm Newsarama: THE BATTLE FOR THE BOY]</ref> 

On [[April 4]] [[2006]], Federal judge Ronald S. W. Lew issued a [[summary judgment]] ruling that Jerry Siegel's heirs had the right to revoke their copyright assignment to Superboy and had successfully reclaimed the trademark to the name as of [[November 17]], [[2004]]. Warner Bros. replied that it "respectfully disagrees" with the ruling and will appeal.<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=7054 Comic Book Resources: JUDGE SAYS SIEGELS OWN SUPERBOY. WILL IT AFFECT "SMALLVILLE?"]</ref> Since the ruling, the name "Superboy" has rarely been used in print to refer to any version of the character. 

On [[July 27]] [[2007]], the courts ruled in favor of Warner Bros' decision to appeal the previous ruling and dismissed some of the Siegel estate's claims about the Superboy character.<ref>[http://titanstowermonitor.blogspot.com/2007/08/superboy-case-update.html TitansTower.com: Superboy case update]</ref><ref name="sblegal0707">[http://www.trexfiles.com/superboy_0727.pdf Trexfiles: The latest Superboy/Superman copyright decision PDF file]</ref> The trial for the dispute over the Superman copyright is expected to begin on [[January 28]], [[2008]], with the trial for the Superboy copyright dispute to begin some time afterwards.<ref>[http://www.trexfiles.com/2007/09/the_latest_on_the_supermansupe.html Trexfiles: The latest on the Superman/Superboy Siegel lawsuits]</ref><ref>[http://blog.newsarama.com/2007/09/24/the-latest-on-the-supermansuperboy-lawsuits/ Blog@Newsarama: The latest on the Superman/Superboy lawsuits]</ref>

The legal dispute has affected DC Comics' treatment of the various incarnations of Superboy, such as in the ''[[Secret Origins|Secret Origin of the Teen Titans]]'' back-up story in the weekly ''[[52 (comic book)|52]]'' limited series, where an illustration of Superboy was changed into [[Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark)|Wonder Girl]].<ref>[http://www.horhaus.com/weblogs/archives/v3/000427.html Horhaus: This is a job for...Wonder Girl?]</ref> In the ''[[Sinestro Corps War]]'' storyline in the [[Green Lantern]] titles and in the ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]'' limited series, the Superboy-Prime character is now known as [[Superman-Prime]], a development that came about in part because of the legal dispute.<ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=130914 Newsarama.com: A SINESTRO CORPS WAR REPORT].</ref>  Additionally, other stories, such as those in [[Teen Titans]], now only refer to the character as "Conner" or "Kon-El."

==Adaptations in other media==
The Superboy character has made the transition to [[television]] and [[film]] on multiple occasions, both in live action and [[animated series]].

*''[[The Adventures of Superboy]]'' ([[1961]]): television series (though only a [[pilot episode|pilot]] was produced).
*''Superboy'' ([[1966]]): film by [[Andy Warhol]].
*''[[The Adventures of Superboy (TV series)|The Adventures of Superboy]]'' ([[1966]]&ndash;[[1969]]): series of 34 six-minute Superboy adventures (his first animated appearances) that appeared as part of three different programs during that time, packaged with similar shorts featuring other DC Comics superheroes. He was voiced by [[Bob Hastings]].
*''[[Super Friends]]'': Superboy makes two appearances in the show's run. The first one is when the Hall Of Justice computer runs a tape showing Lex Luthor's origin. The other is in a short episode where [[Phantom Zone]] criminals go back in time to fight Superboy. He is saved by the arrival of Superman and [[Green Lantern (Hal Jordan)|Green Lantern]]. He was voiced by [[Danny Dark]].
*''[[Superboy (TV series)|Superboy]]'' ([[1988]]&ndash;[[1992]]): television series about Superboy (Clark Kent) during his college years. The series starred [[John Haymes Newton]] (1988&ndash;1989) and [[Gerard Christopher]] (1989&ndash;1992), and [[Stacy Haiduk]] as Lana Lang. 
*''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'' ([[2001]]&mdash;): television series starring [[Tom Welling]]; though not a "Superboy" series by name, this series stars a teenage Clark Kent and features many elements originally present in the Silver Age Superboy comics. Additionally, in a first season episode, Clark accidentally transfers his powers to a classmate named Eric, who, before running amok with his newfound powers, is called "Superboy" by the local newspaper.
*''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'': In the episode "Kid Stuff", Morgan le Fay transforms [[Superman]], [[Batman]], [[Wonder Woman]], and [[John Stewart (comics)|Green Lantern]] into 8-year-olds after [[Mordred]] uses his magic to remove all adults from Earth. While not referred to as Superboy, the eight-year-old Superman is at the same age that young Clark Kent assumed the career in the comics.
*A "young Superman" appears in the ''[[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)|Legion of Super Heroes]]'' animated series. [http://news.toonzone.net/article.php?ID=9249][http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/news/networktv/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002384275] The original press releases stated Superboy would be featured. Due to the aforementioned legal issues, the "Superboy" character was instead referred to on the series as "Superman". This version of the character comes from the time shortly before Clark leaves Smallville for Metropolis. The second season takes place about two years after the first and features both an older Clark and a Superman clone from the 41st century, who has alien DNA and enhanced superpowers, as Legion members.<ref name="nr0807">[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=127093  Animated Shorts: Kids WB!'s Fall Line-Up, South Park, Robot Chicken and More] at [http://newsarama.com/ NEWSARAMA]</ref>
