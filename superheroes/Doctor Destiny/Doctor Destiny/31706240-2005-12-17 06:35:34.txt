'''Dr. Destiny''' is a [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]].

==Background==
Doctor Destiny was once a petty criminal scientist who used his genius to create astounding devices for crime.  Doctor Destiny first encountered the Justice Leaguers shortly after he invented an anti-gravity device that allowed him to capture [[Green Lantern#Silver Age Green Lantern .28Hal Jordan.29|Green Lantern]], impersonate him, and infiltrate the [[JLA]].  Before Destiny could further his criminal ends, however, the Leaguers discovered his treachery and promptly imprisoned him.  He was a failure until his mother, Ethel Dee, gave him the [[The Sandman (DC Comics Modern Age)|Sandman]]’s Dreamstone.  He used the Ruby to power his ''Materioptikon'', which let him create reality from the fabric of dreams.  He manipulated the Dreamstone, forcing flaws and adding circuitry, until it was attuned to him and not the Sandman.  Morpheus was imprisoned by the Daemon King at the time, unaware of what Destiny was doing and unable to stop or prevent it.

His power was so great that the [[Justice League of America]] resorted to drastic measures to stop him.  They hypnotized him and manipulated his psyche to prevent him from [[dream|dreaming]].  This kept him from using the Materioptikon for criminal purposes but caused him to lose his mind and shrivel to a skeletal wreck of a man.  He was then sent to [[Arkham Asylum]], where his sanity eroded further.

When his mother died, he escaped Arkham, reclaimed the Ruby, and used it to initiate a psychopathic rampage where he killed dozens of people.  The Sandman, recently freed and searching for his stolen tokens  of power, could not stop Dee until the psychopath decided to leech all the Sandman’s power into the Ruby and destroy the gem.  The destruction of the Dreamstone returned all of its power back to the Sandman, including power the Lord of Dreams had been without for millennia.  Morpheus then returned Dee to Arkham, and returned his ability to dream.  Although he is able to dream once again, Destiny's sanity is still extremely shaky.

Dr. Destiny threatened the JLA once again by bringing his "dream self" into the real world and attacking them with bizarre and irrational dream-logic.  He was defeated and returned to his cell in Arkham.

Over the years, Doctor Destiny has proven one of the Justice League's most persistent foes. In his earliest appearances, before he lost his sanity, Doctor Destiny's goals were more rational: to acquire wealth and personal power, to eliminate all his enemies, and so on.  All of these schemes revolved around the creative and liberal use of the Materioptikon, a strategy which often caught his opponents unaware and off guard.   One can assume that he is still interested in attaining all of his former goals: the elimination of the Justice League, the restoration of his human appearance, and the reconstruction of the Materioptikon.

==Destiny outside of conventional continuity==
In Grant Morrison's 1989 Batman graphic novel, [[Arkham Asylum#Arkham Asylum:_A_Serious_House_on Serious_Earth|Arkham Asylum]], Destiny is refrenced to by the Joker, and later makes a brief appearance, in which he seems to have either been killed or severely injured by Batman.  Given the nature of the book, which features other characters suffering ambiguously lethal fates, this event likely does not occur in the "main" DC continuity.

==Dr. Destiny in other media==

In the second season ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'' episode "Only a Dream", John Dee (voiced by [[William Atherton]]) was a man imprisoned in Striker's Prison for smugling [[LexCorp]] weapons and kept in regular contact with his wife, Penny.  He volunteered to be a [[Guinea pig#In Scientific Research|guinea pig]] for a doctor's experiments with an "ESP Machine," and during the sessions he would dream of being a member of an ersatz [[Injustice Gang]] and single-handedly defeating the [[Justice League]].  When he found out that his parole request didn't go through, he was saddened.  His wife divorced him soon after, making a bad situation worse.  During a prison riot, he snuck into the doctor's office and exposed himself to an intensified burst from the ESP Machine.  The experience gave him the ability to not only read peoples minds, but to get inside them as well, wreaking havoc in their [[dreams]] and even forcing them to go insane and die.

Despite his love for his wife, when Dee found out she had found another man, he used his abilities to mentally torture both his ex-wife and her new boyfriend, in the process taking the new name ''Dr. Destiny''. Destiny later trapped all of the League members in their dreams, ''sans'' [[Martian Manhunter|J'onn]] and [[Batman]], and played out their deepest fears: [[Hawkgirl]] was trapped inside a coffin (claustrophobia); [[Flash (comics)#Modern Age Flash .28Wally West.29|Flash]] was trapped inside a world where he moved so fast, nobody else could see or hear him; [[Superman]] became so strong and out of control, he killed all those he loved; and [[John Stewart (comics)|Green Lantern]] wasn't accepted back in his old neighborhood because of his status as a Justice League member.

Batman eventually took down Destiny (keeping himself awake by humming ''[[Frère Jacques]]'') and the rest of the League woke up from their dreams, but not without memories of what it felt like to be trapped in those situations.  Destiny was last seen in a comatose condition, back at Striker's, after having accidentally injected himself with a massive overdose of a powerful [[sedative]].  Dr. Destiny, however, is confirmed to be a member of the new [[Legion of Doom]] shown on ''[[Justice League Unlimited]].'' How he recovered from the overdose is still unexplained.

==Trivia==
* It is believed that the design of ''[[He-Man and the Masters of the Universe]]'' villain [[Skeletor]] was based on the original design of Dr. Destiny.  Because of the relative obscurity of Dr. Destiny, however, many fans incorrectly believe that Dr. Destiny is a rip-off of Skeletor, despite his predating of Skeletor by nearly 20 years.

* [[John Dee]] is also the name of a noted Elizabethan [[Astrology|astrologer]] & [[Hermes Trismegistus|Hermetic philosopher]].
