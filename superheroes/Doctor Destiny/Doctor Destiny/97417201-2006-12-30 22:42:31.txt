'''Dr. Destiny''' (aka '''John Dee''') is a [[supervillain]] appearing in [[DC Comics]].

==Background==
Dr. Destiny was once a petty criminal scientist who used his [[genius]] to create astounding devices for crime. He first encountered the [[Justice League of America]] shortly after he invented an [[anti-gravity]] device that allowed him to capture [[Green Lantern#Silver Age Green Lantern .28Hal Jordan.29|Green Lantern]], impersonate him, and infiltrate the JLA. Before Dr. Destiny could further his criminal ends, however, the Leaguers discovered his treachery and promptly imprisoned him.

He then created the Materioptikon, a device which allowed him to create reality from the fabric of dreams. In a later retcon, his mother, Ethel (the former mistress of [[Characters of The Sandman#Roderick_Burgess|Roderick Burgess]]), gave him [[Dream (DC Comics)|Morpheus]]' Dreamstone, which powered the device. He manipulated the Dreamstone, forcing flaws and adding circuitry, until it was attuned to him and not the Dream King. Morpheus was imprisoned by the Burgess at the time, unaware of what Dr. Destiny was doing and unable to stop or prevent it. 

Dr. Destiny's power was so great that the [[Justice League of America|Justice League]] resorted to drastic measures to stop him. They hypnotized him and manipulated his psyche to prevent him from [[dream|dreaming]]; this kept him from using the Materioptikon for criminal purposes but caused him to lose his mind and shrivel to a skeletal wreck of a man. He was then sent to [[Arkham Asylum]], where his sanity eroded further.

When his mother died, Dr. Destiny escaped Arkham, reclaimed the Ruby, and used it to initiate a rampage where he killed dozens of people. The Sandman, recently freed and searching for his stolen tokens of power, could not stop Dr. Destiny until the villain decided to leech all of the Sandman's power into the Ruby and destroy the gem. The destruction of the Dreamstone returned all of its power back to the Sandman, including power the Lord of Dreams had been without for millennia. Morpheus then returned Dr. Destiny to Arkham and returned his ability to dream. Although he is able to dream once again, Dr. Destiny's sanity is still extremely shaky.

Dr. Destiny later learnt that continued use of the Materioptikon meant he still had some dream manipulation powers even without the Dreamstone. He warped the [[Atom (comics)#Silver Age Atom|Atom]]'s dreams of the original Justice League into a world where the [[superhero]]es were [[fascism|fascist]] bullies, as part of a plan to trap the then-current Justice League there. He was defeated when the comatose [[Blue Beetle]] was able to enter the dream world. Later, Dr. Destiny threatened the JLA once again by bringing his "dream self" into the real world and attacking them with bizarre and irrational dream-logic. He was defeated and returned to his cell in Arkham.

Over the years, Dr. Destiny has proven one of the Justice League's most persistent foes. In his earliest appearances, before he lost his sanity, his goals were more rational: to acquire wealth and personal power, to eliminate all his enemies, and so on. All of these schemes revolved around the creative and liberal use of the Materioptikon, a strategy which often caught his opponents off-guard. One can assume that Dr. Destiny is still interested in attaining all of his former goals: the elimination of the Justice League, the restoration of his human appearance, and the reconstruction of the Materioptikon.

==Dr. Destiny outside of conventional continuity==
In [[Grant Morrison]]'s [[1989]] [[Batman]] [[graphic novel]], ''[[Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth]]'', Dr. Destiny is referenced to by the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]], and later makes a brief appearance in which he seems to have either been killed or severely injured by [[Batman]]. Physically he is portrayed as being atrophied and feeble, restricted to a motorised wheelchair. Given the nature of the book, which features other characters suffering ambiguously lethal fates, this event likely does not occur in the "main" [[DC Comics|DC]] continuity.

==Dr. Destiny in other media==
[[Image:Dr Destiny Justice League.jpg|right|thumb|Dr. Destiny<br>as he appeared in the ''[[Justice_League_(animated_series)|Justice League]]'' episode, "Only a Dream"]]In the ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'' episode "Only a Dream", John Dee (voiced by [[William Atherton]]) was a man imprisoned in Stryker's Prison for guarding a supply of smuggled weaponry in a [[LexCorp]] storehouse. He kept in regular contact with his wife, Penny, and volunteered to be a [[Guinea pig#In Scientific Research|guinea pig]] for a doctor's experiments with the Materioptikon, a machine that gave people [[ESP]] abilities; during the sessions, he dreamt of single-handedly defeating the [[Justice League of America|Justice League]] and being a member of the [[Injustice Gang]]. When he found out that his parole request didn't go through, John was saddened. His wife divorced him soon after, making a bad situation worse.

During a prison riot, John snuck into the doctor's lab and exposed himself to an intensified burst from the Materioptikon. The experience gave him the ability to not only read people's minds, but to get inside them as well, wreaking havoc in their dreams and even forcing them to go insane and die. Despite his love for his wife, when he found out she had found another man, John used his abilities to mentally torture his ex-wife, in the process taking the new name "Dr. Destiny."

Dr. Destiny later trapped [[Superman]], [[Hawkgirl]], [[John Stewart (comics)|Green Lantern]], and the [[Flash (comics)#Modern Age Flash .28Wally West.29|Flash]] in their dreams, playing out their deepest fears: [[Hawkgirl]] was trapped inside a coffin ([[claustrophobia]]); [[Flash (comics)#Modern Age Flash .28Wally West.29|Flash]] was trapped inside a world where he moved so fast, nobody else could see or hear him; [[Superman]] became so strong and out of control that he killed all those he loved (possibly a reference to [[Larry Niven]]'s satirical essay ''[[Man of Steel, Woman of Kleenex]]''); and [[John Stewart (comics)|Green Lantern]] wasn't accepted back in his old neighborhood because of his status as a [[Green Lantern]].

While the [[Martian Manhunter]] telepathically entered his teammates' dream to try to get them to realize that what they were experiencing was not real, [[Batman]] eventually took down Dr. Destiny (keeping himself awake by humming ''[[Fr√®re Jacques]]'') and the rest of the [[Justice League of America|Justice League]] woke up from their dreams, but not without memories of what it felt like to be trapped in those situations. Dr. Destiny was last seen in a [[coma|comatose]] condition, back at Stryker's, after having accidentally injected himself with a massive overdose of a powerful [[sedative]]. He, however, is confirmed to be a member of [[Gorilla Grodd]]'s [[Legion of Doom]] shown on ''[[Justice League Unlimited]],'' making a cameo in "I Am Legion" and very briefly seen in a shot on Luthor's side in "Alive!"

This version of Dr. Destiny is the second character on ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'' to actually commit murder ([[Darkseid]] was the first, killing [[Dan Turpin]] and [[DeSaad]]); his ex-wife eventually dies from the torture he inflicts on her. The episode also featured some of the most graphic deaths of ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'' (such as [[Superman]] hugging [[Jimmy Olsen]] in his dream and breaking his spine). In the show's continuation, ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', however, deaths and murders are much more common (although most are, admittedly, implied and [[w:censorship|off-screen]]).

==Trivia==
* It is believed that the design of ''[[He-Man and the Masters of the Universe]]'' villain [[Skeletor]] was based on the original design of Dr. Destiny. Because of the relative obscurity of Dr. Destiny, however, many fans incorrectly believe that Dr. Destiny is a rip-off of [[Skeletor]], despite his predating [[Skeletor]] by nearly 20 years.
* [[John Dee]] is also the name of a noted [[Elizabethan]] [[occultist]], [[Astrology|astrologer]], and [[Hermes Trismegistus|Hermetic philosopher]].
* Dr. Destiny's ability to cause pain in a person's dream is similar to the powers of [[Freddy Krueger]].
