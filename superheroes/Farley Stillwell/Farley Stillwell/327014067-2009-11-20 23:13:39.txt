'''Farley Stillwell''' is a scientist in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe.

==Fictional character biography==
When [[J. Jonah Jameson]] first hired [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]], he was amazed at how he managed to obtain the pictures. He hired private investigator [[Mac Gargan]] to look into this. When J. Jonah Jameson saw an article about inducing animal mutations into humans, he visited the scientist that established this experiment: Dr. Farley Stillwell. Jameson first thought Stillwell was a crack-pot, but later saw him as an opportunity to take down Spider-Man. When he first went to see Dr. Stillwell in his lab, Jameson had him experiment on Gargan. Farley gave Gargan a high-tech scorpion-suit, and the Scorpion was born.

Shortly after the experiment, Farley ran some tests and found that his experiment wasn't a true success. He discovered that Scorpion would lose his sanity as he got stronger. Creating an antidote, Stillwell headed to where Spider-Man was fighting the Scorpion. Upon learning the side effects of the formula from Stillwell, Scorpion didn't want to lose his powers and climbed up a building. Stillwell went up after him and lost his grip. As he fell, Dr. Stillwell threw the serum at Gargan in a vain attempt to cure him. He missed and fell to his death.

It was later revealed that he had a brother named [[Harlan Stillwell]] who used the experiment to create the [[Human Fly (comics)|Human Fly]].
