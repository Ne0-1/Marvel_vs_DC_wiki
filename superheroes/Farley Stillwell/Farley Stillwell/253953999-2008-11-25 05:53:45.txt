'''Farley Stillwell''' is a scientist in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe.

==Fictional character biography==
When [[J. Jonah Jameson]] first hired [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]], he was amazed at how he managed to obtain the pictures. He hired private investigator [[Mac Gargan]] to look into this. When J. Jonah Jameson saw an article about inducing animal mutations into humans, he visited the scientist that established this experiment: Dr. Farley Stillwell. At first thinking that he's a crack-pot, he saw this as an opportunity to take down Spider-Man. When it came to first seen Dr. Farley Stillwell in his lab, J. Jonah Jameson had him experiment on Mac Gargan. With Farley giving Mac Gargan a high-tech scorpion-suit, the Scorpion was born.

Shortly after the experiment, Farley ran some tests and found out that his experiment wasn't a true success as he knew that Scorpion would lose his sanity as he got stronger. Creating an antidote, Farley headed to where Spider-Man was fighting the Scorpion. Upon learning the side effects of the formula from Dr. Farley Stillwell, Scorpion didn't want to lose his powers and climbed up a building. Farley went up after him and lost his grip. As he fell, Dr. Stillwell threw the serum at Gargan in a vain hope to cure him. He missed and fell to his death.

It is later revealed that he had a brother named [[Harlan Stillwell]] who used the experiment to create the [[Human Fly (comics)|Human Fly]].
