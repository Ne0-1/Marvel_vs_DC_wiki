::''For the other Marvel Comics character called "Ms. Marvel", see [[She-Thing]].''

'''Carol Danvers,''' perhaps best known as '''Ms. Marvel''', is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[Superhero|superheroine]]. Created by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and artist [[Gene Colan]], she first appears in ''[[Marvel Super-Heroes (comics)|Marvel Super-Heroes]]'' #13 (March 1968). 

Danvers is a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent and the love interest of the [[Extraterrestrial_life_in_popular_culture|extraterrestrial]] hero [[Mar-Vell|Captain Marvel]]. After exposure to technology from Marvel’s [[Kree]] home world, Danvers gains superhuman strength and the ability to fly, among other abilities, and becomes Ms. Marvel.

An eponymous series in the late [[1970s]] features Ms. Marvel, casting her as a distinctly [[feminism|feminist]] hero. After the series' short life span, the character associates with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and [[X-Men]], although a series of personal tragedies have complicated her career.  Throughout the years, she also uses the codenames '''Binary''' and '''Warbird'''.

==Fictional character biography==
===Early years===
{{unreferenced|section|date=December 2006}}
Carol Danvers, born in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] has two brothers, Steven and Joe. Steven died in the [[Vietnam War]] (years later, in ''Uncanny X-Men #246'', while Carol's memories were inside Rogue, she would visit his name on the [[Vietnam Memorial]], apologizing to him for not being able to visit him recently). Since her father didn't want her to go to college, Carol instead joins the [[United States Air Force]] to fulfill her love of flying. She's a pilot who later joins the [[Central Intelligence Agency]].  She serves alongside her lover Michael Rossi and encounters [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] and [[Nick Fury]] during this time.  She becomes a close ally and love interest of [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]] (Mar-Vell), an alien of the [[Kree]] military who gave up his mission of conquering the Earth and instead chose to protect it.

===Ms. Marvel===
Carol Danvers becomes Ms. Marvel after she is subjected to the "psyche-magnitron", a device of Kree origin.  The device alters her [[DNA]] to resemble that of the Kree, and in the process, she gains [[superhuman]] strength and durability, the ability to fly, and a precognitive "seventh sense" that provides her with a feeling of what is immediately about to happen (for example, where a foe is about to hit her etc.).  Her first costume is based directly on Mar-Vell's second costume, a red outfit with blue mask, gloves and boots; her second, more prominently featured costume is a blue ensemble with a stylized starburst across the chest, along with a red sash around her waist.

[[Image:Msmarvel1.jpg|Cover to ''Ms. Marvel'' #1.  Art by [[John Romita]].|thumb|left|150px]]
In the ''Ms. Marvel'' series, Danvers experiences blackouts, during which she transforms into her Ms. Marvel alter-ego.  Soon Danvers and Ms. Marvel learn of each other and act as one mind.  Danvers becomes editor of ''Woman Magazine'' under [[J. Jonah Jameson]] and dates her psychologist, Michael Burnett.  As Ms. Marvel, she fights a number of villains who go on to prominence, including [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], [[Deathbird]], [[MODOK]], [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|AIM]], and the [[Scorpion (comics)|Scorpion]].  Many of these villains were co-created by writer [[Chris Claremont]], who amplifies Ms. Marvel's already prominent [[feminism|feminist]] characteristics in the series.

Ms. Marvel's solo series was cancelled with #23.  ''Marvel Super-Heroes'' #10-11 (1990) reprint the stories originally intended for ''Ms. Marvel'' #24-25.  In the story for ''Ms. Marvel'' #24, Ms. Marvel battles Sabretooth in a NYC subway; and the story for ''Ms. Marvel'' #25 features a run-in with Pyro and Avalanche of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants.  Chris Claremont, the writer at the end of ''Ms. Marvel'''s run, originally intended for the villain Mastermind to entrance Danvers into becoming evil.  He used the plot for Jean Grey in the "Dark Phoenix Saga".

===Avengers===
Ms. Marvel joins the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] shortly after her solo series folded, but several months later is sidelined due to a surprise pregnancy.  As shown in ''Avengers #200'', her pregnancy progresses at an abnormal speed, and she gives birth to a son within weeks.  Her son, Marcus, quickly grows to adulthood and reveals that he is from [[Limbo (comics)|Limbo]], a dimension outside of time and that he has fallen in love with Danvers.  The story reveals that Marcus kidnapped Danvers during a previous mission and used mind-control devices to force her to fall in love with him.  He seduced and impregnated her, transferred his essence into her womb, becoming his own son.  After he makes this revelation to Danvers and her fellow Avengers, she inexplicably agrees to be his partner and leaves the team with him.  It is later revealed in ''Avengers Annual'' #10 (1981) that she is still under Marcus' influence.  After Danvers leaves with him, his accelerated aging continues until he withers away to a husk, at which point she uses his technology to return to Earth. Writer Carol Strickland criticized the Marcus storyline in an essay titled "The Rape of Ms. Marvel" in comics fanzine ''LOC'' #1 (1981).  In ''Avengers Annual'' #10, Danvers berates the Avengers for allowing her to leave with Marcus.

===Loss of powers to Rogue===
[[Image:RogueVs Warbird.jpg|thumb|Rogue vs. the Ms. Marvel Persona on the cover of ''Uncanny X-Men'' #269, art by [[Jim Lee]].]]
Danvers is not seen again until ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] [[Annual publication|Annual]]'' #10, in which Ms. Marvel loses her powers when the mutant [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] ambushes her and steals them.  ''Marvel Super-Heroes (vol. 2) #11'' later reveals that Rogue's foster mother [[Mystique]] had sent [[Pyro (comics)|Pyro]] and [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]] to fight Danvers, but Danvers defeated them.  Mystique's partner, the precognitive mutant [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]], warned Mystique not to pursue her vendetta against Danvers any further, but Mystique reminded Destiny of an earlier prediction that Ms. Marvel would be involved in a tragedy that would harm Rogue, and said she would not allow that to happen.  Rogue overheard Mystique and decided to deal with Ms. Marvel herself. 

Rogue attacks Danvers at her home in San Francisco.  The fight continues longer than Rogue expects, and she permanently absorbs Danvers' abilities and memories and throws Danvers off the Golden Gate bridge.  The intervention of [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]] saves Danvers' life, and while [[Professor X]] helps Danvers recover her memories, he can not restore her emotional connection to them.  Danvers is unable to feel the emotions she once felt for friends and family.  When the Avengers attempt to express their sorrow, she berates them for letting her go with Marcus so easily. This was how the writers and editors at Marvel responded to Stickland's "Rape of Ms. Marvel" and the controversy it sparked.{{fact}}

Carol would continue on without the emotional connection to her memories; her personality and memories would haunt Rogue's psyche for the remainder of the decade. In ''Uncanny X-Men #182'', an urgent answering machine message left for Xavier causes Carol's personality to supplant Rogue's and rescue Michael Rossi from rogue agents. She nurses Rossi back to health at an old family home. The transfer is so complete that Rogue has not only Carol's memories, but her accent and mannerisms. When Rossi fully recovers, he's horrified to see a total stranger with the voice and familiarity of the woman he loved. Rossi harshly rejects her, which causes Rogue's true personality to break through. Guilt-ridden and devastated, Rogue flees the scene. In ''Uncanny X-Men #236-#238'', while being held prisoner in [[Genosha]] Rogue's powers are temporarily taken from her and the trauma causes her to shut down mentally. She sees the ghosts of those she absorbed identities from over the years. Carol sees her vulnerable state and takes over, freeing Rogue from her captors and then assisting the X-Men in their fight against the Genoshans. After this return to prominence, Carol is reluctant to go back to the shadows, and Rogue is upset by the changes Carol tries to make to her life. In ''Uncanny X-Men #244-#246'',  Rogue is again possessed by Carol, going back to tidy up a few odds and ends in Carol's life and exchanging her usual costume for the Ms. Marvel costume. Rogue's personality again asserts control right before a battle with [[Master Mold]] which sends both Rogue and Master Mold hurling through the interdimensional portal [[Siege Perilous (comics)|Siege Perilous]]. In issue #269, as a result of the trip, Rogue and Carol Danvers are split into two separate bodies. Rogue flees from the Australian Outback and via Gateway, is sent to the [[Savage Land]]. Carol follows her, but is sent to [[Muir Isle]], where the villainous [[Shadow King]] brainwashes her to make her kill Rogue. After the trip through the Siege Perilous, Rogue is initially rendered powerless, but as she gains strength, Danvers takes the form of a rotting corpse. The two battle, but [[Magneto]] destroys Danvers' form and restores her powers to Rogue. Thereafter, Carol Danvers' memories no longer inhabit Rogue, but Rogue still shares a certain psychic bond with the real Carol Danvers, as seen in ''Contest of Champions (vol 2)''.

===Binary and the X-Men===
[[Image:Uncanny164.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Cover to ''Uncanny X-Men'' #164, Danvers' first appearance as Binary.  Art by [[Dave Cockrum]].]]
Danvers stays away from the Avengers for quite some time and has a series of adventures with the [[X-Men]] that culminate in the entire team’s being kidnapped and sent to outer space by the war-mongering alien race known as the [[Brood (comics)|Brood]].  The Brood perform painful medical experiments on Danvers which cause her to gain tremendous superpowers, including the ability to survive in space, the ability to manipulate cosmic energy, and superhuman strength; the source of these powers are attributed to a "[[white hole]]" – a virtually limitless source of cosmic power.  Danvers becomes known as '''Binary'''; in her Binary form, her hair becomes a corona of flame and she dons a red-and-white costume with a stylized black [[Starburst (symbol)|starburst]] on the breast.  When the X-Men choose to let the severely disturbed Rogue join their school, Danvers cuts all ties to the group and spends several years in space, often battling alongside the [[Starjammers]].

===Warbird===
Eventually, Danvers' link to the white hole is broken, and as a result, she loses her cosmic-level powers as Binary.  She retains a level of superhuman strength, flight, resistance to injury, and enhanced senses comparable to those she once possessed before her battle with Rogue, as well as the power to manipulate and absorb energy.  She rejoins the Avengers and changes her code name to '''Warbird''', again donning her classic blue Ms. Marvel costume.  She is no longer as powerful as she was as Binary, but she is considerably more powerful than she was in her early days as Ms. Marvel. 

Insecurity about her powers no longer being what they once were causes her to become an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]].  When she is unable to function in a coherent capacity, a humiliated Danvers quits the team rather than be expelled.  With the help of fellow alcoholic [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]], Danvers curbs her drinking and stabilizes her powers.  She rejoins the Avengers for a few missions but leaves again in 2003 to work for [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.  She works as a parole officer for the newest incarnation of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].

===Ms. Marvel reborn===
When [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] convinces his sister [[Scarlet Witch]] to create [[House of M|a world where mutants are the dominant species on Earth]], most normal humans are viewed as second-class citizens with some exceptions.  Danvers is one of these, and she becomes the "greatest hero" on this Earth, going by the name [[Captain Marvel]].  Once the world reverts, Danvers is motivated by the realization of her potential, and she concentrates on reinvigorating her career.  Danvers retakes the name Ms. Marvel and strikes out on her own, turning down an offer to join the reformed Avengers and leaving her Homeland Security job.  Danvers hires a public relations firm.  The new ''Ms. Marvel'' comic book series debuted in March 2006, and one of her first battles was a rematch with the [[Brood]] and a new enemy: the alien hunter known as [[Cru (comics)|Cru]].

Also new to the Ms. Marvel rogues gallery is [[Warren Traveler]], the sorcerer supreme of the [[House of M]].

{{spoiler}}
[[Image:SHRCard.png|Ms. Marvel Superhuman Registration Card|thumb]]
In ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' #2, Ms. Marvel joins the faction of superheroes aligned with [[Iron Man]] in enforcing the Superhuman Registration Act.  In ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #538, she battles fellow Avenger [[Silverclaw]]. In her own series, Danvers works with [[Wonder Man]] and [[Julia Carpenter|Arachne]] to train novice superheroes and hunt down anti-Registration heroes.  Her first recruit is [[Araña]]. Arachne is revealed to be acting against the Superhuman Registration Act, which results in Carol arresting her. Carol believes she has done the right thing but is upset by the trauma the incident causes Arachne's daughter. 

A week after the incident, Carol returns home to find Rogue in her apartment. Rogue informs Carol there's a problem between them, and that they're going to solve it. 

It is revealed in ''Ms. Marvel'' #9 that the problem in question is the discovery of another woman in Carol's apartment, who is later revealed at the Xavier Institute by [[Beast (comics)|the Beast]] to be an alternate-Earth Carol Danvers.  The alternate Carol, named Warbird, earlier attacked Rogue. 

Warbird, who had never fully recovered from the battle with her Earth's Rogue, is an embittered alcoholic.  When the Avengers sent out a call for assistance in fighting off the Brood, she ignored it and, consequently, her Earth was destroyed.   A combination of the shockwave released by the planet's destruction and her own energy absorption powers tossed Warbird across several universes before bringing her to the 616 Earth. 

Upon learning of Warbird's behavior, Carol does not hide her disgust, and a fight between the two ensues. During the course of the battle, Rogue tries to intervene, but in a fit of anger, Carol attacks her and breaks some of her ribs. Warbird tells Carol that since her world was destroyed, she had been to dozens of alternate Earths, and not only did she kill every version of Rogue she found there, she also killed every version of Carol Danvers as well. Infuriated, Carol finally defeated Warbird and she was taken into custody. Carol later returned to the Xavier Institute to check on Rogue, and found herself questioning whether of not she had truly forgiven her.

==Powers==
Ms. Marvel possesses a wide array of superhuman powers.  Initially, they include superhuman strength, endurance, formidable resistance to physical injury, the ability to fly, and a precognitive sense.

As Binary, she can manipulate every form of energy in the electromagnetic spectrum on a cosmic level, has vastly increased strength, and can fly at speeds exceeding [[light speed]].  After her link to the white hole from which she drew her powers is severed, she loses the bulk of her cosmic powers, but still retains her energy manipulation powers on a smaller scale.  In addition to her original powers of superhuman strength, injury resistance, and flight, Ms. Marvel can absorb and manipulate any kind of energy.  She can focus this energy into her others abilities like her photonic powers, explosive blasts of radiant energy, which she fires from her fingertips.  These blasts are comparable in power to her fellow Avenger Iron Man's repulsor rays.  By focusing her powers outward in all directions, she can surround herself with an energy aura which deflects most attacks.  She also has some gravitational powers which allow her to boost her already tremendous strength by absorbing the gravitational forces around her.  She also demonstrates the ability to absorb other forms of energy, such as electricity, to further magnify her strength and energy projection.  As seen in ''Avengers'' (vol. 3) # 41, when augmented by enough energy, she can withstand 92 tons of pressure and strike with a similar level of force. Hank Pym theorized that probably would still not be her limit, although absorbing too much at once or being taken by surprise by an energy-based assault can overwhelm her and/or cause her physical pain.  On at least one occasion, Binary is able to use her power to force open a [[Shi'ar]] Stargate, a feat which only [[Firestar]] and hosts of the [[Phoenix (comics)|Phoenix Force]] are shown to manage.

[[Image:Ms._Marvel_Repowered.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Ms. Marvel temporarily repowered into her Binary form by the [[Collective (comics)|Collective]].  From ''New Avengers'' #17.  Art by Mike Deodato.]]

Originally, in ''Avengers'' (vol. 3) #4, Hank McCoy, the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], after performing several biological tests, theorizes Ms. Marvel will never be able to access her cosmic-level powers again.  However, recent events have proven this to be incorrect.  It is shown in ''[[New Avengers (comic)|New Avengers]]'' #17 and #18 that Ms. Marvel still possesses all the abilities she had as Binary, but lacks a suitable power supply to maintain them at that level.  When Ms. Marvel battles the sentient energy being [[The Collective (comics)|the Collective]], she is struck by a bolt of its energy, which causes her skin to turn fiery red, a side-effect of her cosmic powers.  The flaming energy corona that manifests around her head when she uses them also appears.

==Alternate versions==
*An [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate]] version first appears as a high-ranking officer of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] in the ''[[Ultimate Secret]]'' [[limited series]] and becomes [[Mahr Vehl|Captain Marvel's]] girlfriend shortly after being assigned to him as his security detail.{{issue}}

* In the "[[Marvel Mangaverse]]” series, Lt. Carol Danvers ([[USAF]]) is the sole survivor of her squad after the Hand's attack. (Her call sign is "Warbird" in homage to her Marvel Universe identity.)  In her hospital room, she realizes she now has superpowers and swears revenge on those who killed her fellow soldiers.  After killing [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]], she dons the identity of [[Captain America]] and proceeds to rescue the captured heroes ([[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]], [[Iron Man]], [[Spider-Man]], [[Spider-Woman]] ([[Mary Jane Watson]]), Torchie (this reality's [[Human Torch]]), and [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], so that they can face down the enemy.

* In ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]'', an alternate version of Carol Danvers, calling herself Ms. Marvel, is forced to join [[Weapon X (Exiles)|Weapon X]] and to repair broken worlds by killing people, as seen in ''Exiles'' #38.  Danvers accomplishes all tasks with ruthlessness and delight.  When [[Hyperion (comics)|Hyperion]] joins Weapon X, Danvers becomes his lover and henchwoman.  She is later killed in combat with [[Morph (comics)|Morph]] in ''Exiles'' #45 and her dead body is later returned to her homeworld of Earth-4732, as seen in ''Exiles'' #83.

==Appearances in other media==
===Television===
*There were plans for an X-Men cartoon in the mid-eighties (not to be confused with ''Pryde Of The X-Men'', a pilot for a different series concept).  Among the X-Men is a character called Lady Lightning, who basically is Carol Danvers.  The cartoon was, however, rejected.[http://www.tv.com/spider-man-and-his-amazing-friends/the-x-men-adventure/episode/223016/trivia.html#notes]

*Carol Danvers appears in the ''[[X-Men (TV series)#Season 2|X-Men]]'' animated series in the Season 2 episode "A Rogue's Tale".  Her encounter with [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] in the flashback of the episode is similar to in the ''Avengers Annual'', minus the involvement of [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Jessica Drew/Spider-Woman]] and [[Avengers (comics)|the Avengers]].  Danvers is critically injured in the engagement and is comatose.  Rogue and Danvers have a mental fight over control of Rogue's body, which Rogue wins (with a telepathic assist from Jean Grey).  Danvers is not seen again, but the episode implies that she will recover.  And yet Binary appears with the [[Starjammers]] and doesn't appear to recognize Rogue.

===Video games===
*Carol/Ms. Marvel appears in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'' as one of the playable characters. Her comic book mission is against ''[[Super-Skrull]]''. Her powers include flight, and the ability to shoot energy.
