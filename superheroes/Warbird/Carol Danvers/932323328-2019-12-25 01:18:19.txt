Danvers resurfaces with superhuman abilities and becomes the hero [[Ms. Marvel]] (created by writer [[Gerry Conway]] and artist [[John Buscema]]) in a self-titled series in January 1977, at first written by [[Gerry Conway]] and later by [[Chris Claremont]]. In the series, it is revealed that the energy exposure from the explosion of a device called the "Psyche-Magnetron" caused Danvers's genetic structure to meld with Captain Marvel's, effectively turning her into a human-Kree hybrid.<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' #1–23 (Jan. 1977 – April 1979).

At the time of the publication of ''Ms. Marvel'' #1 in 1977, the title was self-consciously socially progressive for its time. This was reflected in the use of the word "[[Ms.]]", then associated with the [[feminist movement]],<ref name="Comics Alliance 10 November 2014">{{cite news|last1=Weeler |first1=Andrew |title=Oh Captain My Captain: How Carol Danvers Became Marvel's Biggest Female Hero |url=http://comicsalliance.com/captain-marvel-carol-danvers-marvel-biggest-female-hero/|work=[[Comics Alliance]]|date=November 10, 2014|accessdate=December 7, 2014|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209034738/http://comicsalliance.com/captain-marvel-carol-danvers-marvel-biggest-female-hero/|archivedate=December 9, 2014  }}</ref> and in Danvers fighting for [[equal pay for equal work]] in her civilian identity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/comics/22834/marvel_women_of_the_70s_ms_marvel|title=Marvel Women of the 70: Ms. Marvel|last1=White|first1=Brett|website=Marvel.com|date=July 9, 2014|accessdate=December 7, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170724104758/https://news.marvel.com/comics/22834/marvel_women_of_the_70s_ms_marvel/|archivedate=July 24, 2017}}</ref>

===1980s===
[[File:Uncanny164.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Cover to ''Uncanny X-Men'' #164 (Dec. 1982). Carol Danvers's first appearance as Binary. Art by [[Dave Cockrum]].]]

In ''The Avengers'' #200 (Oct. 1980), which was written by [[Bob Layton]], [[David Michelinie]], [[George Pérez]], and [[Jim Shooter]], Ms. Marvel is kidnapped by a character named Marcus (the apparent son of Avengers foe [[Immortus]]) and taken to an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate dimension]], where she is brainwashed, raped, and impregnated. She gives birth on Earth to a child that rapidly ages into another version of Marcus, who is ultimately unable to remain on Earth after [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] mistakenly damages his machine and takes Ms. Marvel back to the alternate dimension with no opposition from the Avengers, who perceive Ms. Marvel and Marcus to have fallen in love. Comic book historian [[Carol A. Strickland]] criticized the storyline in an essay titled "The Rape of Ms. Marvel".<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.carolastrickland.com/comics/msmarvel/index.html|title=The Rape of Ms. Marvel|last=Strickland|first=Carol A.|journal=LoC|issue=1|date=January 1980|accessdate=April 15, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327101150/http://www.carolastrickland.com/comics/msmarvel/index.html|archivedate= March 27, 2019}}</ref> Citing Marcus' line, "Finally, after relative weeks of such efforts—and admittedly, with a subtle boost from Immortus' machines—you became mine", Strickland posited that this constituted rape. As a former writer of the solo title, Chris Claremont also commented on the inappropriateness of the storyline.<ref>Chris Claremont, quoted in ''X-Men Companion'' #2 (Fantagraphics Books, 1982): "Actually, my reaction was a lot stronger than that. But how callous! How cruel! How unfeeling! Considering that <nowiki>[the Avengers]</nowiki> must have seen Ms. Marvel only a couple of days before, or even a couple of months before. She wasn't pregnant then. How could she be eight months pregnant now?"</ref>

Claremont wrote a follow up to the Marcus story in ''Avengers Annual'' #10 (1981). In that story, Danvers is revealed to have returned to Earth—courtesy of Immortus's technology after Marcus continued to age and die of old age—but is attacked by the mutant [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], who permanently absorbs the character's abilities and memories. Danvers' memories are restored by [[Professor X]], and an angry confrontation with the Avengers concerning their failure to realize Marcus had brainwashed her follows.<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #10 (1981). Marvel Comics.</ref> Claremont continued to develop the character in the title ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]''. Danvers enters [[the Pentagon]] and, while wiping the government's files on the [[X-Men]], also deletes all records of herself in a symbolic break with her life as Ms. Marvel.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #158 (June 1982). Marvel Comics.</ref> During an adventure in space with the X-Men, Danvers is changed courtesy of experimentation by the alien race, the [[Brood (comics)|Brood]], into a newly-empowered character called Binary (created by writer Chris Claremont and artist [[Dave Cockrum]]).<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #164 (Dec. 1982). Marvel Comics.</ref> Drawing on the power of a cosmic phenomenon called a [[white hole]], Danvers becomes capable of generating the power of a star. As Binary, the character has a number of encounters with the X-Men,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #166–167 (Feb.–March 1983); #171, 174 (July, Oct. 1983); #200–201 (Dec. 1985 – Jan. 1986).

Marvel Comics.</ref>

Claremont expanded on the incident with the character Rogue by having the Carol-Danvers persona manifest itself within Rogue's mind, sometimes overpowering Rogue's personality. This happens to Rogue on several occasions, which results in an uneasy armistice between the personalities within Rogue's mind.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #182 (June 1984); #203 (March 1986); #235–239 (Oct. 1988 – Feb. 1989).

===1990s===
Carol Danvers continued to make sporadic appearances,<ref>''X-Men Spotlight On... Starjammers'' #1–2 (May–June 1990).

Marvel Comics.</ref> That same year she appeared extensively in the storyline "[[Operation Galactic Storm]]". By the conclusion of the story, she lost her connection to the white hole she drew her powers from, reverting to her original Ms. Marvel powers. She did retain the energy manipulation and absorption powers she had as Binary, but on a smaller scale.<ref>''Quasar'' vol. 1, #34 (May, 1992). Marvel Comics.</ref>

After several more team and solo appearances<ref>''Avengers'' #350–351 (both Aug. 1992); ''Starblast'' #1 (Jan. 1994); ''[[X-Men Unlimited]]'' #1 (Dec. 1996); ''Excalibur'' #116 (Jan. 1998).

Busiek explored the character by having her develop [[alcoholism]], struggling to come to terms with the loss of her cosmic powers and memories. Danvers disgraces herself during the "Live Kree or Die" storyline<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 3, #7; ''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' vol. 3 #8; ''[[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]]'' #10; ''Avengers'' vol. 3, #7 (Aug. 1998).

In the course of the fight, Warbird kills the Master, and after the final victory over Kang she demands a court martial to review her actions. The court martial finds her killing justified as an act of war, and Carol continues as an Avenger. After the [[Avengers Disassembled|Avengers disband]], Warbird leaves the group, and, along with other prominent former Avengers like [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], [[Hank Pym]], [[Falcon (Marvel Comics)|Falcon]] and [[Wonder Man]], is not included in the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] group soon formed by [[Iron Man]] and [[Captain America]].<ref>''Avengers'' #500–503 (Sept.–Dec. 2004), ''Avengers: Finale'' #1 (Jan. 2005)</ref>

During the 2015 "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]" storyline, Danvers headlined her own tie-in series, ''Captain Marvel and the Carol Corps'' co-written by DeConnick and [[Kelly Thompson]] and drawn by López. In the series, Danvers leads an elite squadron of female fighter pilots stationed at an airbase called Hala Field, where she is the only superpowered being; this leads the corps to help Danvers answer questions about her origin, which puts her in conflict with the controlling forces of [[Battleworld#Third Battleworld|Battleworld]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3043329/exclusive-first-look-at-marvels-newest-women-driven-comic|title=Exclusive First Look At Marvel's Newest Women-Driven Comic|last=Nagy|first=Evie|publisher=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]|date=March 10, 2015|accessdate=August 25, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180110054535/https://www.fastcompany.com/3043329/exclusive-first-look-at-marvels-newest-women-driven-comic|archivedate=January 10, 2018}}</ref> During the storyline, Danvers becomes a member of [[A-Force]], Battleworld's all-female team of Avengers.

Continuing with the All-New, All-Different Marvel" initiative, Danvers starred in the ninth volume of ''Captain Marvel'', written by ''[[Agent Carter (TV series)|Agent Carter]]'' showrunners [[Tara Butters]] and [[Michele Fazekas]], with artwork by [[Kris Anka]], which debuted in October 2015. The series, set eight months after "Secret Wars", sees Danvers taking over the responsibilities of [[S.W.O.R.D.

[She has] seen the highs and the lows of the superhero business, and come out the other side. Right now, Carol's in the ascendant, culturally, both in-universe and outside it...

In 2016, Danvers played a predominant role in the storyline "[[Civil War II]]", the core miniseries of which was written by Brian Michael Bendis and illustrated by [[David Marquez (comics)|David Marquez]]. In the story, Danvers is the leader of a faction of superheroes who wish to use [[Ulysses (comics)#Ulysses (Inhuman)|Ulysses']] precognitive power to profile people who in his visions, will commit future crimes. About her position Bendis stated, "From Carol's point of view, she is like, 'You're telling me the world is still turning at the end of the day and everyone is safe? I don't care...

Stohl explained, "She will be one of the most popular heroes on the planet—but that's not something she is very comfortable with. And of course she's lost a lot of folks that she's loved so she has to cope with that, too. That being said, she still has a job to do as commander of the Alpha Flight.

Beginning in July 2018, Danvers headlined a limited series titled, ''The Life of Captain Marvel'', by Stohl and artist [[Carlos Pacheco]]. The series is described as a "retelling" of Danvers' origin story but Stohl insisted that it is not a "reinvention" explaining, "You look through a different lens. It's nothing you'll expect and nothing you've seen happen but there will be parts of her life that change the context of what you've seen before, so it's telling the other side of the story, of how she came to be." Stohl also said that there would be similarities with the [[Captain Marvel (film)|2019 film]], but the film is "its own thing".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/captain-marvel-author-margaret-stohl-origin-story-expect/story?id=53421255|title='Captain Marvel' author Margaret Stohl says new origin story is 'nothing you'll expect'|last=Rothman|first=Michael|work=[[ABC News]]|date=March 1, 2018|accessdate=March 3, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180619190018/https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/captain-marvel-author-margaret-stohl-origin-story-expect/story?id=53421255|archivedate=June 19, 2018}}</ref> The series reveals that Danvers' mother is Kree and that the blast that was responsible for her powers only awakened her preexisting Kree genes, and did not fuse her human DNA with Mar-Vell's Kree DNA as [[Retroactive continuity|originally written]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/marvel-just-added-another-twist-to-captain-marvels-orig-1829205937|title=Marvel Just Added Another Twist to Captain Marvel's Origin Story|last=Whitbrook |first=James|publisher=[[iO9]]|date=September 20, 2018|accessdate=October 2, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190305234430/https://io9.gizmodo.com/marvel-just-added-another-twist-to-captain-marvels-orig-1829205937|archivedate=March 5, 2019}}</ref>

Danvers is scheduled to star in the tenth volume of ''Captain Marvel'' written by [[Kelly Thompson]] and drawn by [[Carmen Carnero]].

==Characterization==
With ''Ms. Marvel'' #1 in 1977, writer [[Gerry Conway]] played a significant role in the character's development, writing in his introduction to the series, "you might see a parallel between ''her'' quest for identity, and the modern woman's quest for raised consciousness, for self-liberation, for identity".<ref name="MsPrint">{{Cite comic | writer=Conway, Gerry | story=Ms. Prints | title=Ms. Marvel | issue=1 | date=Jan. 1977}}</ref>

Ms. Marvel's uniform and abilities, however, were derived from the character's then-contemporary male counterpart: Captain Marvel. The ''Ms. Marvel'' [[comic book letter column|letters page]] ("Ms. Prints") featured letters debating whether or not the character was feminist. Reader (and frequent [[letterhack]]) Jana C. Hollingsworth took issue with Ms. Marvel's entire origin:

{{quote|For the eleven years I've been a comics fan, I've been proud of how Marvel resisted the temptation to create male-based heroines à la Supergirl. It's been proudly proclaimed that Ms. Marvel is ''not'' [[Jean Grey|Marvel Girl]]; well, maybe the early Marvel Girl did have weak powers and an insipid personality, but at least her powers were ''her'' powers and her personality was ''her'' personality.... I hope you can change her costume if it's all possible, and keep her on her own instead of associating her with Captain Marvel....<ref>{{Cite comic | writer=Hollingsworth, Jana C. | story=Ms. Prints | title=Ms. Marvel | issue=5 | date=May 1977}}</ref>}}

Another reader had issue with the character's outfit: "Question: where is a woman who wears long sleeves, gloves, high boots and a scarf (winter wear), and at the same time has a bare back, belly, and legs? The Arctic equator? That costume requires a few alterations."<ref>{{Cite comic | writer=Lipp, Debbie | story=Ms. Prints | title=Ms. Marvel | issue=8 | date=Aug. 1977}}</ref> These questions, and the controversial rape in ''Avengers'' #200, caused many readers to question the character's portrayal, and whether she was a good role model for female readers:<ref>Chris Claremont, quoted in ''X-Men Companion'' #2 (Fantagraphics, 1982)</ref>

{{Blockquote|As Carol [Strickland] pointed out in her article in ''LOC'' [#1], women tend to get very short shrift in comics. They are either portrayed as wallflowers or as supermacho insensitive men with different body forms, who almost invariably feel guilty about their lack of femininity. And it's always seemed to me that, why does this have to be exclusive? Can you not have a woman who is ruthless and capable and courageous and articulate and intelligent and all the other buzz-words—heroic when the need arises, and yet feminine and gentle and compassionate, at others? That was what I tried to do with Ms. Marvel. I tried to create a character who had all the attributes that made her a top-secret agent yet at the same time was a compassionate, warm, humorous, witty, intelligent, attractive woman.}}

It has been noted that "Danvers' initial appearances portrayed her as a strong character, but that changed over time—even after she gained super powers."<ref>{{Cite news | title=Heroines shine in 3 titles | last=Munguia | first=Shawn | newspaper=Valley Morning Star | location=Harlingen, Texas | date=March 25, 2008 | url=http://www.valleymorningstar.com/articles/marvel-22310-character-new.html}}</ref> When Ms. Marvel received her own title in the 2000s, Marvel Comics was "determined to have the character take center stage in the Marvel Universe", with "Joe Quesada and the other powers [having] had the character play major roles in their huge 'House of M' crossover, in the 'New Avengers' and in the gargantuan success that is 'Civil War'."

==Powers and abilities==
As Ms. Marvel, Carol Danvers initially possessed superhuman strength, endurance, stamina, physical durability, a limited precognitive "seventh sense" and a perfectly amalgamated human/Kree physiology that rendered her resistant to most toxins and poisons. She originally only had the power of flight thanks to a contraption under her suit.  As Binary, the character could tap the energy of a "[[white hole]]", allowing full control and manipulation of stellar energies, and therefore control over heat, the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] and [[gravity]]. [[Speed of light|Light speed]] travel and the ability to survive in the vacuum of space were also possible.<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' #1–3</ref>

Although the link to the white hole was eventually severed, Danvers retains her Binary powers on a smaller scale, enabling her to both absorb energy and project it in photonic form. She can also still survive in space. While she lacks a constant source of energy to maintain the abilities at their previous cosmic level, she can temporarily assume her Binary form if empowered with a high enough infusion of energy.

Danvers possesses superhuman strength and durability, can fly at roughly six times the speed of sound,<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #1 (Aug. 2012)</ref> retains her "seventh sense", and can discharge explosive blasts of radiant energy, which she fires from her fingertips. She also demonstrates the ability to absorb other forms of energy, such as electricity, to further magnify her strength and energy projection, up to the force of an exploding nuclear weapon.<ref name="The Mighty Avengers 6"/> When sufficiently augmented, she can withstand the pressure from a ninety-two-ton weight and strike with a similar level of force, although [[Henry Pym|Hank Pym]] theorized that this likely was not her limit.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3, #41 (June 2001)</ref> Danvers cannot absorb magical energy without consequence, though she aided Dr. Stephen Strange in the defeat of the mystic menace, Sir Warren Traveler.<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' vol. 2, #5 (Sept. 2006)</ref>

She displays superhuman strength and a near-invulnerability in the miniseries. No genuine explanation is given to how her powers came to exist in the Mangaverse (though it is implied that she somehow gained them after exposure to attacks from the Rings of the Mandarin, as she claims she can feel the power of the Rings while climbing Mt.

She receives help from [[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Spider-Man]] (Peter Parker) after she arrests him in public, hoping that it would lure Norman to her. She summoned a press release and had [[Harry Osborn]] tell the reporters the truth that Norman was a horrible person for experimenting on himself and killing his mother.<ref name="Ultimate Spider-Man #111-117"/> Outraged, Norman went to the S.H.I.E.L.D.

Spider-Man becomes angry at Danvers because Harry died on her watch and told her to stay out of his life. She did not do as he asked, but she still felt sorry for him.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #117. Marvel Comics.</ref>

As S.H.I.E.L.D. Director, Danvers was put in command of the newly formed New Ultimates. When Loki attempted another invasion of Earth, Danvers and the women of the team ([[Power Princess|Zarda]] and [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]]) were placed under a spell by [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Amora]]. Danvers, using technology, was able to resist the spell and was able to free the rest of the team to battle Loki's forces.<ref>''New Ultimates'' #1–6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After Spider-Man was captured and replaced by the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]], Danvers decided that having Peter, untrained, loose in the city was doing more harm than good. She approached [[Aunt May|May Parker]] and they both agreed that Peter would attend training lessons from individual members of the New Ultimates.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #150. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Danvers and her New Ultimates battled Nick Fury and his Avengers while each side accused the other of being traitors to S.H.I.E.L.D. and the United States of America. During the fight, Danvers was hit by a Police Cruiser, leaving her in critical condition. Her role as S.H.I.E.L.D. Director was then passed on to [[Gregory Stark]], the one that had in fact engineered the events from the start.<ref>''Avengers vs New Ultimates'' #4.

The Kree kill Mar-Vell, but Danvers successfully destroys the engine. The explosion of the engine, which draws its power from the [[Cosmic Cube|Tesseract]], leaves Danvers with powerful energy-manipulation abilities, but [[Amnesia|wipes her memory]]. After a period in the Kree [[Starforce]] (with her being referred to simply as "Vers", the only part of her name legible from the remains of her broken [[dog tag]]), she returns to Earth, discovers her origins while working with [[Nick Fury]], and unlocks the full potential of her powers. The film concludes with her departing with the Skrull refugees to find them a new planet, but she leaves a modified pager with Nick Fury that he can use to call her in the event of a major emergency. Fury is inspired by her example to propose gathering exceptional individuals together to defend Earth from unconventional threats; he names this protocol "the Avengers Initiative" after Danvers' old callsign.
