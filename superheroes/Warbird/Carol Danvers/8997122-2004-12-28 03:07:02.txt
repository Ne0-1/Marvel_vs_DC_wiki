==Carol Danvers==

Carol Danvers, a.k.a. Ms. Marvel, is a fictional character created by [[Marvel]] comics.<P>
First Appearance: Marvel Super Heroes #13<P>

Powers and Abilities: 
superhuman reflexes, speed, strength, endurance, durability, and flight <P>

===Ms.Marvel and the Avengers===

Carol Danvers became Ms. Marvel after she was injected with [[Kree]] DNA. She gained physical strength,  the ability to fly, and a 7th sense (which provided her with premonitions). Danvers joined the [[Avengers]] but several months later was sidelined due to a surprise pregnancy (a surprise because she had not been intimate with any men for some time). The pregnancy progressed at freakish speed and within weeks she gave birth to a son. The son quickly became a man, Marcus, who came from another dimension and had fallen in love with Carol. Somewhat inexplicably, she agreed to be his partner and left the team for this other dimension. 

===Rogue=== 

Carol was not seen again until [[Avengers]] Annual #10, Ms. Marvel lost her powers permanently when the X-Man [[Rogue (comics) | Rogue]] ambushed her outside her [[San Francisco]] apartment building.

This was due to before, Carol had once stumbled upon an arms deal that [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], Rogue's foster mother and the leader of the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], was coordinating behind the scenes and foiled her carefully laid plans. Mystique's partner and lover, the precognitive mutant [[Destiny (comics)|Destiny]], glimpsed Carol's future and warned Mystique that Ms. Marvel was intimately tied to a great tragedy which would harm Rogue. Determined to shield her daughter from this danger, Mystique developed an obsessive hatred for Carol. When she learned that Carol had resurfaced in San Francisco following her departure from the ranks of the Avengers, she plotted to end this threat to Rogue once and for all. Rogue overheard her mother's angry words and concerns and determined to deal with Ms. Marvel herself. 

The fight continued far longer than Rogue expected, and when she permanently and absorbed Danvers' abilities and memories. She dumped Danvers off the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] and only the intervention of [[Spider-Woman (comics) | Spider-Woman]] saved Danvers' life. [[Professor X (comics) | Professor X]] helped Danvers recover her memories, but she was unable to feel the emotions she once felt for friends and family (what was once was love would now be only mild affection). When the Avengers attempted to express their sorrow, she berated them for letting her go so easily. She had been under Marcus' mind control. She only managed to escape after his various machinations caused him to rapidly age and wither into a husk. 

===The X-Men===

Danvers stayed away from the Avengers for quite some time and had a series of adventures with the [[X-Men]] which culminated in the entire team being kidnapped and sent to outer space by the war-mongering alien race known as the [[Brood (comics)|Brood]]. Painful medical experiments on Danvers caused her to gain extensive superpowers, including the ability to survive in space, to fire energy bolts, and superhuman strength. Danvers became known as Binary. When the X-Men chose to let a severely disturbed Rogue join their school, Danvers cut all ties to the group and spent the next several years in space with the [[Starjammers (comics) | Starjammers]]. 

===Warbird===

Eventually Danvers lost her Binary superpowers and maintained only heightened senses a limited ability to fire energy bolts. She rejoined the Avengers and changed her code name to Warbird. Insecurity about her continually diminishing powers caused her to become an alcoholic. When she was unable to function in any coherent capacity, a humiliated Danvers quit the team. With the help of fellow alcoholic Tony Stark ([[Iron Man (comics) | Iron Man]]), Danvers curbed her drinking and stabilized her powers. She rejoined the Avengers for a few missions but left again in [[2003]] to work for [[SHIELD (comics) | SHIELD]].
