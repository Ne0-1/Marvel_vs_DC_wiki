'''Ms. Marvel''' ('''Carol Susan Jane Danvers''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[comic book]] [[superhero]]ine from the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. Created by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and artist [[Gene Colan]], she first appeared (as the non-super-powered Carol Danvers) in ''[[Marvel Super-Heroes (comics)|Marvel Super-Heroes]]'' #13 (March 1968) and as Ms. Marvel in ''Ms. Marvel'' #1 (January 1977). 

Danvers is a retired U.S. Air Force Intelligence agent turned NASA Security Chief, and a romantic interest to the [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] hero [[Mar-Vell|Captain Marvel]]. After exposure to technology from Marvelâ€™s [[Kree]] home world, Danvers gains superhuman strength and the ability to fly, among other abilities, and becomes Ms. Marvel.

An eponymous series in the late [[1970s]] features Ms. Marvel, casting her as a distinctly [[feminism|feminist]] hero. After the series' short life span, the character associates with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and [[X-Men]], although a series of personal tragedies have complicated her career. Throughout the years, she also uses the [[code name]]s '''Binary''' and '''Warbird'''.

==Publication history==
Carol Danvers has had two on-going series named ''Ms Marvel''.  She has also featured prominently in the ''Spotlight on...the Starjammers'' as Binary and in both the ''X-Men'' and ''Avengers'' titles.

Ms. Marvel's first solo series was cancelled after issue #23.  ''Marvel Super-Heroes'' #10-11 (1990) printed the stories originally intended for ''Ms. Marvel'' #24-25, though much of #11 is new material.  In the story for ''Ms. Marvel'' #24, Ms. Marvel battles Sabretooth in a NYC subway; and the story for ''Ms. Marvel'' #25 features a run-in with Pyro and Avalanche of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. 

The new ''Ms. Marvel'' comic book series debuted in March 2006, and one of her first battles was a rematch with the [[Brood (comics)|Brood]] and a new enemy: the alien hunter known as [[Cru (comics)|Cru]].

Also new to the Ms. Marvel rogues gallery is [[Warren Traveler]], the sorcerer supreme of the [[House of M]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Early years===
Carol Danvers was born in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] to Joseph and Marie Danvers and has two brothers, Steven and Joseph, Jr. (Joe). Steven died in the [[Vietnam War]]. Years later, while Rogue was in possession of Carol's memories, Carol would visit the [[Vietnam Memorial]], apologizing to him for not being able to visit recently.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men #246''</ref>

When Carol was a young girl, she hitchhiked to [[Cape Canaveral]] to see a shuttle launch. Her father "beat the tar out of her," but she never stopped wanting to fly.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men #164''</ref>  Since her father didn't want her to go to college, Carol instead joined the [[United States Air Force]] to fulfill her love of flying. She was a pilot who later becomes an Air Force intelligence operative.  She later became the NASA security chief.<ref>''Marvel Super-Heroes'' Vol. 1 #13</ref> She served alongside her mentor/lover Michael Rossi and encountered [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], [[Nick Fury]], and [[Thing (comics)|Ben Grimm]] during this time. She became a close ally and romantic interest to [[Mar-Vell|Captain Marvel]] (Mar-Vell), an alien of the [[Kree]] military who gave up his mission of conquering the Earth and instead chose to protect it.

===Ms. Marvel's 1st Solo Series===
[[Image:Msmarvel1.jpg|Cover to ''Ms. Marvel'' #1.  Art by [[John Romita]].|thumb|left|200px]]
Carol Danvers becomes Ms. Marvel after she is caught in the radiation emitted by the explosion of the Kree "Psyche-Magnitron" device. Being carried in Captain Marvel's arms as he rushes her from the cave containing the Psyche-Magnitron, the radiation washes through both their bodies, somehow imbuing Carol with powers similar to Captain Marvel's.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #18</ref> The device alters her [[DNA]] to resemble that of the Kree, and in the process, she gains [[superhuman]] strength and durability, the ability to fly, the ability to instantly change to her costume and back, and a precognitive "seventh sense" that provides her with a feeling of what is immediately about to happen (for example, when a foe is about to attack her).

At first Ms. Marvel's strength and flight are enabled by circuitry built into the costume, however an overload to the circuitry during battle soon transfers the powers to Ms. Marvel permanently, and the "powers through circuitry created by radiation" explanation has never been mentioned since.

Her first costume is based directly on Mar-Vell's second costume, a red outfit with blue mask, gloves and boots, though with her legs and belly bare, and a long red scarf around her neck; this costume has appeared on numerous "Worst Of" comic book related lists as the Worst Female Superhero Costume Ever. Her later, more prominently featured costume is a blue ensemble with a stylized lightning bolt across the chest, along with a red sash around her waist.

At first not aware of being Ms. Marvel, Danvers experiences blackouts, during which she transforms into her Ms. Marvel alter-ego.  Soon Danvers and Ms. Marvel learn of each other and re-meld into one mind.  Danvers becomes editor of ''Woman Magazine'' under [[J. Jonah Jameson]] and considers dating her psychologist, Michael Burnett.  As Ms. Marvel she fights a number of villains, including [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], [[Deathbird]], [[MODOK|M.O.D.O.K.]], [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]], and the [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]].

===Avengers===
Ms. Marvel joins the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] shortly before her solo series folds, but several months later is sidelined due to a surprise pregnancy.  As shown in ''Avengers #200'', her pregnancy progresses at an abnormal speed, and she gives birth to a son within weeks.  Her son, Marcus, quickly grows to adulthood and reveals that he is from [[Limbo (comics)|Limbo]], a dimension outside of time and that he has fallen in love with Danvers.  The story reveals that Marcus kidnapped Danvers during a previous mission and used mind-control devices to force her to fall in love with him.  He seduced and impregnated her, transferred his essence into her womb, becoming his own son.  After he makes this revelation to Danvers and the Avengers, she agrees to be his partner, and leaves the team to be with him.

Only Hawkeye sees anything amiss in the normally strong-willed and sensible Carol Danvers suddenly professing love for a man who's just confessed to kidnapping, brainwashing, and, essentially, impregnating her through rape, and being willing to leave her entire world and timeline to be with him, but he is overridden by the other Avengers. 

[[Carol A. Strickland]] harshly criticized the Marcus storyline in an essay titled "The Rape of Ms. Marvel" that appeared in comics fanzine ''LOC'' #1 (1981).  [[Chris Claremont]], writer of the ''Avengers Annual'' #10 (the next story involving Danvers) noted in 1982 that he had read, and found himself in agreement with, Strickland's analysis.<ref>Claremont commented upon Danvers and the events of ''Avengers'' #200 in the ''X-Men Companion 2,'' (Fantagraphics Books, 1982); quoted at http://www.carolastrickland.com/msmrape3.html</ref>

It is later revealed that Carol's departure with Marcus occurred against her will while she was under his control.<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #10 (1981)</ref>  After their departure, Marcus' accelerated aging continues until he withers away to a husk.  This allows Carol to appropriate his advanced technology so that she can return to Earth.

===Loss of powers to Rogue===
In ''Avengers Annual'' #10 (1981), Ms. Marvel loses her powers when the mutant [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] ambushes her and steals them.  Later it is revealed that Rogue's foster mother [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] had sent [[Pyro (comics)|Pyro]] and [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]] to fight Danvers,<ref>''Marvel Super-Heroes vol. 2 #11'' </ref> but Danvers defeated them. Mystique murdered Dr. Michael Barnett and then read his personal medical files regarding Ms. Danvers. Mystique's partner, the precognitive mutant [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]], warned Mystique not to pursue her vendetta against Danvers any further, but Mystique reminded Destiny of an earlier prediction that Ms. Marvel would be involved in a tragedy that would harm Rogue, and said she would not allow that to happen.  Rogue overheard Mystique and decided to deal with Ms. Marvel herself. 

Rogue attacks Danvers at her home in San Francisco.  The fight continues longer than Rogue expects, and she permanently absorbs Danvers' abilities and memories and throws Danvers off the Golden Gate bridge.  The intervention of [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]] saves Danvers' life, and while [[Professor X]] helps Danvers recover her memories, he can not restore her emotional connection to them; Danvers is unable to feel the emotions she once felt for friends and family.  

When re-united with the Avengers, the members of the team express sorrow over Marcus' demise: they fail to comprehend that Carol was under Marcus' power when she left the team as his companion.  Carol berates the Avengers for having allowed her to leave with Marcus in the first place.

Carol would continue on without an emotional connection to her memories; her personality and memories would haunt Rogue's psyche for years.

===Binary and the X-Men===
[[Image:Uncanny164.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Cover to ''Uncanny X-Men'' #164, Danvers' first appearance as Binary.  Art by [[Dave Cockrum]].]]
Danvers stays away from the Avengers for quite some time and engages in a series of adventures with the [[X-Men]].

Her adventures with the X-Men culminate in the entire teamâ€™s forced transportation to outer space by the alien race known as the [[Brood (comics)|Brood]].  The Brood perform painful medical experiments on Danvers which cause her to gain tremendous superpowers, including superhuman strength and the abilities to survive in space and manipulate cosmic energy.  The source of these powers is attributed to a "[[white hole]]" â€” a limitless source of cosmic power.

Danvers is known as '''Binary'''. In her cosmic energy form her hair becomes a corona of flame and she dons a red-and-white costume with a stylized black [[Starburst (symbol)|starburst]] on the breast.  When the X-Men choose to let the disturbed Rogue attend their school, Danvers cuts all ties to the group and spends several years in space, often battling alongside the [[Starjammers]].

===The "second Ms. Marvel"===
[[Image:RogueVs Warbird.jpg|225px|thumb|[[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] vs. the Ms. Marvel Entity.<br>Cover to ''Uncanny X-Men'' #269.<br>Art by [[Jim Lee]].]]
When Rogue passes through the mystical device, the [[Siege Perilous (comics)|Siege Perilous]], she emerges on the other side with the essence of the powers she had stolen from Carol Danvers split off into a separate entity. Believing itself to be Carol Danvers (who is currently in space with the Starjammers), and with only enough life force between them to sustain one life, the Ms. Marvel entity battles Rogue for her continued existence. Overcoming her foe, and about to kill Rogue, the entity is blasted and disabled by Magneto, who then uses his machinery to reintegrate the Ms. Marvel power into Rogue's body, thus ending the brief career of "the second Ms. Marvel".

===Warbird===
Eventually, Danvers' link to the white hole is broken, and as a result, she loses her cosmic-level powers as Binary.  She retains a level of superhuman strength, flight, resistance to injury, and enhanced senses comparable to those she once possessed before her battle with Rogue, as well as the power to manipulate and absorb energy.  She rejoins the Avengers and changes her code name to '''Warbird''', again donning her classic Ms. Marvel costume. She does not use the codename Ms. Marvel because, during her absence from Earth superhero work, [[Sharon Ventura]], a member of the [[Fantastic Four]], has assumed the name.  

Insecurity about her powers no longer being what they once were, combined with a brief restoration of the emotional ties that Rogue had drained, cause Carol to become an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]].  When she is unable to function in a coherent capacity, a humiliated Danvers quits the Avengers rather than be expelled.  With the help of fellow alcoholic [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]], Danvers curbs her drinking and stabilizes her powers.  She rejoins the Avengers for a few missions but leaves again in 2003 to work for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.  She works as a parole officer for the newest incarnation of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].

===House of M===
When [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] convinces his sister [[Scarlet Witch]] to create [[House of M|a world where mutants are the dominant species on Earth (House of M)]], most normal humans are viewed as second-class citizens with some exceptions.  Danvers is one of these but still becomes the "greatest hero" on this Earth, going by the name "Captain Marvel". She even has her own arch-nemesis, Sir Warren Traveler.
[[Image:SHRCard.png|Ms. Marvel Superhuman Registration Card|thumb]]

===Ms. Marvel Reborn===
When the world reverts, Danvers retains her memories and is motivated by the realization of her potential, and she concentrates on reinvigorating her career.  Danvers retakes the name Ms. Marvel and strikes out on her own, turning down an offer to join the reformed Avengers and leaving her Homeland Security job.  Danvers hires a public relations firm.

Ms. Marvel joins forces with the New Avengers during the New Avengers/Transformers crossover. Because of her Kree nature, her anger is amplified as a result of the aggression machine that Megatron stole.  

===Civil War and Arachne===
Ms. Marvel joins the faction of superheroes aligned with [[Iron Man]] in enforcing the [[Superhuman Registration Act]].<ref>''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' #2</ref>  She battles fellow Avenger [[Silverclaw]].<ref>''[[Fantastic Four]]'' vol. 1 #538</ref> Danvers then works with [[Wonder Man]] and [[Julia Carpenter|Arachne]] (Julia Carpenter, formerly Spider-Woman II) to train novice superheroes and hunt down anti-Registration heroes.  Her first recruit is [[AraÃ±a]]. 

AraÃ±a is later critically injured while attempting to help Carol against [[Doomsday Man]], as he rips off the carapace which becomes part of her body when she is in battle. <ref>Ms Marvel vol. 2 #12</ref> AraÃ±a recovers, but her father takes out a restraining order against Carol. Arachne is revealed to be acting against the Superhuman Registration Act, which results in Carol arresting her. Carol believes she has done the right thing but is upset by the trauma the incident causes Arachne's daughter.<ref>Ms Marvel vol. 2 #1</ref> 

Arachne escapes and confronts Carol about the whereabouts of her daughter. Carol tells Julia her daughter was left at the Carpenter family home with her parents. When Julia tells her the house is empty, Carol reluctantly uses her government connections to help Julia track down her daughter, and to take her from Julia's parents, even though they have legal custody. Carol and Tony Stark work out an agreement in which Julia will serve her time in government service by joining the Canadian super-team [[Omega Flight]].  Julia agrees, although she says she can neither forget nor forgive what Carol did to her and her daughter.

===Carol vs. Carol===
[[Image:MSMARVELWARBIRD.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Cover art to ''Ms. Marvel'' #10.<br>Art by [[Mike Wieringo]].]]
Shortly following the arrest of Julia Carpenter, Carol returns home to find Rogue in her apartment. Rogue informs Carol there's a problem between them, and that they're going to solve it. 

The problem is the discovery of another woman in Carol's apartment, whom [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] deduces to be an alternate-Earth Carol Danvers.  The alternate Carol, named Warbird, earlier attacked Rogue.<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' vol. 1 #9</ref> 

Warbird, who has never fully recovered from her battle with her Earth's Rogue, is an embittered alcoholic.  When the Avengers send out a call for assistance during the Brood's assault, she ignores it and, consequently, her Earth is destroyed.   A combination of the shockwave released by the planet's destruction and her own energy absorption powers tosses Warbird across several universes before bringing her to the "real" Earth. 

Upon learning of Warbird's behavior, Carol does not hide her rage and disgust, and a fight between the two ensues. During the course of the battle, Rogue intervenes; in a fit of anger Carol attacks her and breaks her ribs. Warbird tells Carol that since her world was destroyed, she has been to dozens of alternate Earths, and not only did she kill every version of Rogue she has found, she has murdered every version of Carol Danvers as well.  (Each Carol would intervene on Rogue's behalf.) Infuriated, Carol defeats Warbird, who is taken into custody. 

Carol later returns to the Xavier Institute to check on Rogue, and questions whether she has truly forgiven her. After the ordeal, Carol flies into space where she can unleash her rage in a place that "nobody can hear her scream."

===Mighty Avengers===
Carol accompanies [[Tony Stark]] as he investigates an [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] terrorist attack in [[Indianapolis]] that killed ninety-six people, and the two argue over the Civil War.  Carol punches Tony, knowing his armor will protect him.  She is surprised when he later offers her leadership of the [[Mighty Avengers]]. Carol's publicist, who had suggested the new team name to Tony in the first place, encourages her to accept the job. Carol is tempted by the chance of leading such a prominent team, but is disturbed by the number of smaller attacks that go unanswered due to bureaucratic red tape. Tony agrees to allow her access to S.H.I.E.L.D. files and personnel (Agents Locke, Baines, and Sum) in order to take out developing threats. Carol announces the Initiative (''Operation: Lightning Storm'') at a press conference, announcing that in their first mission, they took down the A.I.M. cell responsible for the Indianapolis attack. <ref>Ms Marvel vol. 2 #13</ref>

Carol assumes leadership of the [[Mighty Avengers]], despite her reluctance to work against some of her old comrades who are members of the [[New Avengers]].

==Powers and abilities==
Ms. Marvel possesses a wide array of superhuman powers.  Initially, they include superhuman strength, endurance, formidable resistance to physical injury, the ability to fly, energy absorption (including sound waves), energy projection, and a limited precognitive "seventh sense".
[[Image:Ms. Marvel Repowered.jpg|thumb|right|Ms. Marvel temporarily re-powered into her Binary form by the [[Collective (comics)|Collective]].  From ''New Avengers'' #17.<br>Art by [[Mike Deodato]].]]

As Binary, she could tap the energy of a "white hole", allowing her to manipulate stellar (or "cosmic" energies, which she could radiate as heat, light, and the rest of the electromagnetic spectrum as well as gravity fields, on a scale with a [[Herald of Galactus]].  After a massive expenditure of stellar energies, she would revert to human form and needed to rest in that state. She possessed strength far greater than her original level, and when flying could shunt herself to [[hyperspace]] to exceed [[light speed]], and could exist in the vacuum of space unprotected. Binary managed to force open a [[Shi'ar]] Stargate, a feat only [[Firestar]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], [[Nova (comics)|Nova]] and hosts of the [[Phoenix (comics)|Phoenix Force]] have been shown to accomplish.

After Carol's link to the white hole from which she drew her powers was severed, she lost the bulk of her cosmic powers, but still retained her potential for energy manipulation in addition to her original powers of superhuman strength, injury resistance, and flight. Ms. Marvel can discharge explosive blasts of radiant energy, which she fires from her fingertips. These blasts are comparable in force to her fellow Avenger Iron Man's repulsor rays. By focusing her powers outward in all directions, she can surround herself with an aura which deflects most attacks.{{Fact|date=September 2007}} She also has some gravitational powers which allow her to boost her already great strength by absorbing the gravitational forces around her.{{Fact|date=September 2007}} She also demonstrates the ability to absorb other forms of energy, such as electricity, to further magnify her strength and energy projection. When sufficiently augmented, she can withstand the pressure from a 92-ton weight, and strike with a similar level of force.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3, #41</ref> Hank Pym theorized that this likely was not her limit. Carol was unsure if she could absorb magical energy, but managed to do so when she helped Stephen Strange defeat the mystic menace [[Sir Warren Traveler]]. 

[[Beast (comics)|Hank McCoy]] had theorized that Ms. Marvel would no longer be able to access her cosmic-level powers,<ref>''Avengers'' vol.3, #4</ref> however she was apparently briefly restored to Binary status, after being exposed to great power while battling the sentient energy being [[Xorn#The Collective|The Collective]].<ref>''New Avengers'' #17-#18</ref> According to February 2008 solicitations from Marvel, Carol will regain her cosmic powers in Issue #24.<ref>http://www.marvel.com/catalog/?id=8174</ref>

Aside from her superhuman powers, Carol is an extraordinary espionage agent, and has received considerable training in armed and unarmed combat in military intelligence, making her an excellent hand-to-hand combatant.  She is also a highly talented writer, and worked for a time as a freelance writer.

==Other versions==
===[[Age of Apocalypse]]===
Carol Danvers works with the Human Defense League and guards [[Gateway (comics)|Gateway]] during his work at [[Wundagore|Wundagore mountain]]. She helps Weapon X (this reality's [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]) in battle with the Reavers. She accompanies Wolverine and Gateway on a trip to help the humans destroy the North American Apocalypse forces but she seemingly dies in a battle with [[Donald Pierce]]. Her form is infected with a techno-organic virus and she is forced to fight on the other side.

===[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]===
An alternate version of Carol Danvers, calling herself Ms. Marvel, is forced to join [[Weapon X (Exiles)|Weapon X]] and to repair broken worlds by killing people, as seen in ''Exiles'' #38.  Danvers accomplishes all tasks with ruthlessness and delight.  When [[Hyperion (comics)|Hyperion]] joins Weapon X, Danvers becomes his lover and henchwoman.  She is later killed in combat with [[Morph (comics)|Morph]] in ''Exiles'' #45 and her dead body is later returned to her home-world of Earth-4732 (''Exiles'' #83). 

===[[Marvel Mangaverse]]===
Lt. Carol Danvers ([[USAF]]) is the sole survivor of her squad after an attack by the Hand. (Her call sign is "Warbird" in homage to her Marvel Universe identity.)  In her hospital room, Carol realizes she now has superpowers, and swears revenge on those who killed her fellow flyers.  After killing [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]], she assumes the identity of [[Captain America]] and proceeds to rescue the captured heroes ([[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]], [[Iron Man]], [[Spider-Man]], [[Spider-Woman]]/[[Mary Jane Watson]], a female version of the [[Human Torch]], and [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]).

===[[Marvel Zombies]]===
The Avengers were the first on the scene to the site of the crash, and Ms. Marvel is one of the first infected, and the one to infect [[Angel (comics)|Angel]] and [[Nova (comics)|Nova]].

===Ultimate Carol Danvers===
[[Image:Danvers2.jpg|Ultimate Carol Danvers|thumb|{{deletable image-caption|1=Friday, 30 November 2007}}]]
An [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate]] version first appears as a high-ranking officer of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] in the ''[[Ultimate Secret]]'' [[limited series]] and becomes [[Mahr Vehl|Captain Marvel's]] security detail<ref>Ultimate Extinction #1 pg. 5</ref>.  Carol appears as a S.H.I.E.L.D. officer in the [[Silver Surfer]] story arc in [[Ultimate Fantastic Four]].   She also made an appearance in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' #112, running S.H.I.E.L.D. in the absence of Nick Fury.  She has since been in the recent  issues of Ultimate Spider-Man.

==In other media==
===Television===
*There were plans for an X-Men cartoon in the mid-eighties (not to be confused with ''Pryde of the X-Men'', a pilot for a different series concept).  Among the X-Men is a character called Lady Lightning, who basically is Carol Danvers.  The cartoon was, however, rejected.[http://www.tv.com/spider-man-and-his-amazing-friends/the-x-men-adventure/episode/223016/trivia.html#notes]

*Carol Danvers appears in the ''[[X-Men (TV series)#Season 2|X-Men]]'' animated series in the Season 2 episode "A Rogue's Tale".  Her encounter with [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] in the flashback of the episode is similar to in the ''Avengers Annual'', minus the involvement of [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]] and [[Avengers (comics)|the Avengers]].  Danvers is critically injured in the engagement and is comatose.  Rogue and Danvers have a mental fight over control of Rogue's body, which Rogue wins (with a telepathic assist from Jean Grey).  Danvers is not seen again, but the episode implies that she will recover. Nevertheless Binary appears with the [[Starjammers]].

===Video games===
* Carol/Ms. Marvel appears in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'' voiced by [[April Stewart]]. She appears as one of the playable characters. Her comic book mission is against ''[[Super-Skrull]]''. Her powers include flight, super-strength, and the ability to shoot energy beams/blasts. Optional costumes for the character include her Binary form, Classic (her original costume), Warbird (her current suit, default when starting game), and Ventura (Sharon Ventura, most recently known as [[She-Thing]], who went by Ms. Marvel in the [[1980]]'s). She has special dialogue with [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] and [[Volla (Marvel Comics)|Volla]].
