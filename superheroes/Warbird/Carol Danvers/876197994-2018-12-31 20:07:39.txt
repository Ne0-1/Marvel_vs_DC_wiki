The character debuted in the title ''[[Marvel Super-Heroes (comics)|Marvel Super-Heroes]]'' as an [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] in the [[United States Air Force]] and Security Chief of a restricted military base, where Danvers meets Dr. Walter Lawson, the human [[Pseudonym|alias]] of [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[Kree]] hero [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Captain Marvel]].<ref>''Marvel Super-Heroes'' #13 (March 1968)</ref> In a later story, Danvers is caught in the explosion of a Kree device after trying to get close to Captain Marvel.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #1 (May 1968)</ref> Although Captain Marvel manages to save her life, Danvers sustains serious injuries.<ref>''[[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]]'' #18 (November 1969)</ref>

===1970s===
Danvers resurfaces with superhuman abilities and becomes the hero Ms. Marvel in a self-titled series in January 1977, at first written by [[Gerry Conway]] and later by [[Chris Claremont]]. In the series, it is revealed that the energy exposure from the explosion of a device called the "Psyche-Magnetron" caused Danvers's genetic structure to meld with Captain Marvel's, effectively turning her into a human-Kree hybrid.<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' #1-23 (January 1977 – April 1979)</ref> Ms. Marvel had a series of semi-regular appearances in ''The Avengers'', with additional appearances with the Defenders,<ref>''Defenders'' #62-63 (August–September 1978)</ref> [[Spider-Man]],<ref>''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #77 (January 1979)</ref> the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]],<ref>''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'' #51 (May 1979)</ref> and [[Iron Man]].<ref>''Iron Man'' #125-126 (August–September 1979)</ref> In one of these stories, the mutant terrorist [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] kills [[Michael Barnett (comics)|Michael Barnett]], Ms. Marvel's lover.<ref>''Marvel Super-Heroes'' vol. 2, #11 (October 1992)</ref>

At the time of the publication of ''Ms. Marvel'' #1 in 1977, the title was self-consciously socially progressive for its time. This was reflected in the use of the word "[[Ms.]]", then associated with the [[feminist movement]],<ref name="Comics Alliance 10 November 2014">{{cite news|last1=Weeler |first1=Andrew |title=Oh Captain My Captain: How Carol Danvers Became Marvel's Biggest Female Hero |url=http://comicsalliance.com/captain-marvel-carol-danvers-marvel-biggest-female-hero/ |accessdate=December 7, 2014 |work=[[Comics Alliance]] |date=November 10, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209034738/http://comicsalliance.com/captain-marvel-carol-danvers-marvel-biggest-female-hero/ |archivedate=December 9, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> and in Danvers fighting for [[equal pay for equal work]] in her civilian identity.<ref>{{cite web|last1=White|first1=Brett|title=MARVEL WOMEN OF THE 70'S: MS.

===1980s===
In ''The Avengers'' #200 (October 1980), Ms. Marvel is kidnapped by a character named Marcus (the apparent son of Avengers foe [[Immortus]]) and taken to an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate dimension]], where she is brainwashed, seduced, and impregnated. She gives birth on Earth to a child that rapidly ages into another version of Marcus, who is ultimately unable to remain on Earth after [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] mistakenly damages his machine, takes Ms. Marvel back to the alternate dimension with no opposition from the Avengers, who perceive Ms. Marvel and Marcus to have fallen in love. Comic book historian [[Carol A. Strickland]] criticized the storyline in an essay titled "The Rape of Ms. Marvel".<ref>{{Cite journal | last=Strickland | first=Carol A. | title=The Rape of Ms. Marvel | journal=LoC | issue=1 | date=January 1980 | url=http://www.carolastrickland.com/comics/msmarvel/index.html}}</ref> Citing Marcus' line, "Finally, after relative weeks of such efforts—and admittedly, with a subtle boost from Immortus' machines—you became mine", Strickland posited that this constituted rape. As a former writer of the solo title, Chris Claremont also commented on the inappropriateness of the storyline.<ref>Chris Claremont, quoted in ''X-Men Companion'' #2 (Fantagraphics Books, 1982): "Actually, my reaction was a lot stronger than that. But how callous! How cruel! How unfeeling! Considering that <nowiki>[the Avengers]</nowiki> must have seen Ms. Marvel only a couple of days before, or even a couple of months before. She wasn't pregnant then. How could she be eight months pregnant now?"</ref>

Claremont effectively "undid" the Marcus story in ''Avengers Annual'' #10 (1981). In that story, Danvers is revealed to have returned to Earth—courtesy of Immortus's technology after Marcus continued to age and die of old age—but is attacked by the mutant [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], who permanently absorbs the character's abilities and memories. Danvers' memories are restored by [[Professor X]], and an angry confrontation with the Avengers concerning their failure to realize Marcus had brainwashed her follows.<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #10 (1981). Marvel Comics.</ref> Claremont continued to develop the character in the title ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]''. Danvers enters [[the Pentagon]] and, while wiping the government's files on the [[X-Men]], also deletes all records of herself in a symbolic break with her life as Ms. Marvel.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #158 (June 1982). Marvel Comics.</ref> During an adventure in space with the X-Men, Danvers is changed by courtesy of experimentation by the alien race, the [[Brood (comics)|Brood]], into a newly-empowered character called "Binary".<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #164 (December 1982). Marvel Comics.</ref> Drawing on the power of a cosmic phenomenon called a [[white hole]], Danvers becomes capable of generating the power of a star. As Binary, the character has a number of encounters with the X-Men,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #166-167 (February–March 1983); #171, 174 (July, October 1983); #200-201 (December 1985 – January 1986).

Marvel Comics.</ref>

Claremont expanded on the incident with the character Rogue by having the Carol-Danvers persona manifest itself within Rogue's mind, sometimes overpowering Rogue's personality. This happens to Rogue on several occasions, which results in an uneasy armistice between the personalities within Rogue's mind.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #182 (June 1984); #203 (March 1986); #235-239 (October 1988 – February 1989).

Within the same issue, the Ms.-Marvel persona is killed by [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #269 (October 1990). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===1990s===
The character continued to make sporadic appearances,<ref>''X-Men Spotlight On... Starjammers'' #1-2 (May–June 1990). Marvel Comics.</ref> and two additional issues planned for the original title—prevented by cancellation—were printed in a quarterly anthology series.<ref>''Marvel Super-Heroes'' vol. 2 #10-11 (July–October 1992). Marvel Comics.</ref> The same year the character was also used extensively in the storyline "[[Operation Galactic Storm]]". By the conclusion of the story, the character had lost her connection to the white hole she drew her powers from, reverting to the use of the original Ms. Marvel powers, but retaining the energy manipulation and absorption powers she had as Binary, albeit on a smaller scale.{{issue|date=January 2017}}

After several more team and solo appearances<ref>''Avengers'' #350-351 (both August 1992); ''Starblast'' #1 (January 1994); ''[[X-Men Unlimited]]'' #1 (December 1996); ''Excalibur'' #116 (January 1998). Marvel Comics.</ref> the character then rejoins the Avengers<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3, #4 (May 1998). Marvel Comics.</ref> with the new alias ''Warbird''. Writer [[Kurt Busiek]] explored the character by having her develop [[alcoholism]], struggling to come to terms with the loss of her cosmic powers and memories. Danvers disgraces herself during the "Live Kree or Die" storyline<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 3, #7; ''[[Captain America]]'' vol. 3 #8; ''[[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]]'' #10; ''Avengers'' vol. 3, #7 (August 1998).

Marvel Comics.</ref> the character was featured in ''Iron Man'',<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 3 #12, 18 (January, July 1999). Marvel Comics.</ref> ''[[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]]'',<ref>''Wolverine'' #133-134 (January–February 1999)</ref> and ''The Avengers''<ref>''The Avengers'' vol. 3 #17-18, 21 (June–July, October 1999). Marvel Comics.</ref> before making a cameo appearance in ''[[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]]''.<ref>''[[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]]'' #14 (November 1999). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===2000s===
As Warbird, the character returns to the Avengers and plays a key role in the "[[Kang Dynasty]]" plotline.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3 #41-54 (June 2001 - July 2002)</ref> [[Kang the Conqueror|Kang]]'s son Marcus, the [[Scarlet Centurion]], falls in love with her, but she rejects him, in part because he reminds her of Marcus, son of Kang's older alter ego Immortus, who raped her. The Scarlet Centurion nonetheless helps her to defeat the [[Master of the World (comics)|Master of the World]], a supervillain whose alien technology becomes the key to defeating Kang. In the course of the fight, Warbird kills the Master, and after the final victory over Kang she demands a court martial to review her actions. The court martial finds her killing justified as an act of war, and Carol continues as an Avenger. After the [[Avengers Disassembled|Avengers disband]], Warbird leaves the group, and, along with other prominent former Avengers like [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], [[Hank Pym]], [[Falcon (Marvel Comics)|Falcon]] and [[Wonder Man]], is not included in the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] group soon formed by [[Iron Man]] and [[Captain America]].<ref>''Avengers'' #500-503 (September–December 2004), ''Avengers: Finale'' #1 (January 2005)</ref>

The character was then featured as "Captain Marvel" in a false reality created by the mutant [[Scarlet Witch]] in the 2005 miniseries ''[[House of M]]''.<ref>''House of M'' #1-8 (August–December 2005)</ref> This reality pandered to Danvers' subconscious desire to be accepted, as she proved to be the most popular superhero on Earth. Ms. Marvel then came to prominence again when the character was launched in a second self-titled volume.<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' vol. 2, #1 (March 2006)</ref> Together with fellow Avenger Iron Man, Danvers also becomes a principal advocate of the [[Registration acts (comics)#2006 Superhuman Registration Act|Superhuman Registration Act]] during the events of the 2006-07 "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]" storyline.<ref>''Civil War'' #1-7 (July 2006 – January 2007).

Marvel Comics.</ref>

Ms. Marvel is captured by the Brood on Monster Island, whereupon she found the Brood Queen. An intense confrontation ensued during which Ms. Marvel's powers are temporarily disabled, forcing her to fight the Brood Queen as Carol Danvers. At one point, she is stripped of her civilian [[clothing]] and was forced to drift through space until she was able to access her powers.<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' vol. 2 #23. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Ms. Marvel also plays a significant role in the 2008 storyline "[[Secret Invasion]]",<ref>''Secret Invasion'' (June 2008 – January 2009).

The increased use of Carol Danvers as a prominent character in many story arcs throughout this decade eventually prompted one commentator to note that "she's now the House of Ideas' premier heroine".<ref name="Wiz220">Andy Serwin (January 2010).

In July 2012, Carol Danvers assumed the mantle of [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]] in an ongoing series written by [[Kelly Sue DeConnick]] with art by [[Dexter Soy]]. Danvers dons a [[jumpsuit]] and explores her own past. When describing her pitch for the series at [[WonderCon]] 2012 DeConnick said it could be "pretty much be summed up with 'Carol Danvers as [[Chuck Yeager]].'" She said the series would contemplate what Captain Marvel's legend means to Danvers, how she will wield it, and how the rest of the [[Marvel Universe]] reacts.<ref name=Beard120317>{{cite web |last=Beard |first=Jim |date=March 17, 2012 |title=WonderCon 2012: Captain Marvel |url=http://marvel.com/news/story/18290/wondercon_2012_captain_marvel |website=marvel.com |publisher=Marvel |accessdate=March 19, 2012}}</ref>

Danvers also rejoined the main Avengers team as Captain Marvel in vol. 5 of ''The Avengers'' and in the spin-off series, ''[[Avengers Assemble (comics)|Avengers Assemble]]'', also written by DeConnick.<ref>''The Avengers'' Vol. 5 #2 (December 2012)</ref> Editor Lauren Sankovitch said that Marvel editors liked DeConnick's work and that adding her to the team would "get some lady power in the Avengers lineup".

In the series, Danvers leads an elite squadron of female fighter pilots stationed at an airbase called Hala Field, where she is the only superpowered being; this leads the corps to help Danvers answer questions about her origin, which puts her in conflict with the controlling forces of [[Battleworld#Third Battleworld|Battleworld]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Nagy |first=Evie |date=March 10, 2015 |title=Exclusive First Look At Marvel's Newest Women-Driven Comic |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/3043329/strong-female-lead/exclusive-first-look-at-marvels-newest-women-driven-comic |work=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]] |accessdate=August 25, 2015}}</ref> During the storyline, Danvers becomes a member of [[A-Force]], Battleworld's all-female team of Avengers.

In 2016, Danvers played a predominant role in the storyline "[[Civil War II]]", the core miniseries of which was written by Brian Michael Bendis and illustrated by [[David Marquez (comics)|David Marquez]]. In the story, Danvers is the leader of a faction of superheroes who wish to use [[Ulysses (comics)#Ulysses (Inhuman)|Ulysses']] precognitive power to profile people who in his visions, will commit future crimes. About her position Bendis stated, "From Carol's point of view, she is like, 'You're telling me the world is still turning at the end of the day and everyone is safe? I don't care...

Stohl explained, "She will be one of the most popular heroes on the planet—but that's not something she is very comfortable with. And of course she's lost a lot of folks that she's loved so she has to cope with that, too. That being said, she still has a job to do as commander of the Alpha Flight.

Beginning in July 2018, Danvers headlined a limited series titled, ''The Life of Captain Marvel'', by Stohl and artist [[Carlos Pacheco]]. The series is described as a "retelling" of Danvers' origin story but Stohl insisted that it is not a "reinvention" explaining, "You look through a different lens. It's nothing you'll expect and nothing you've seen happen but there will be parts of her life that change the context of what you've seen before, so it's telling the other side of the story, of how she came to be."

==Characterization==
With ''Ms. Marvel'' #1 in 1977, writer [[Gerry Conway]] played a significant role in the character's development, writing in his introduction to the series, "you might see a parallel between ''her'' quest for identity, and the modern woman's quest for raised consciousness, for self-liberation, for identity".<ref name="MsPrint">{{Cite comic | writer=Conway, Gerry | story=Ms. Prints | title=Ms. Marvel | issue=1 | date=January 1977}}</ref>

Ms. Marvel's uniform and abilities, however, were derived from the character's then-contemporary male counterpart: Captain Marvel. The ''Ms. Marvel'' [[comic book letter column|letters page]] ("Ms. Prints") featured letters debating whether or not the character was feminist. Reader (and frequent [[letterhack]]) Jana C. Hollingsworth took issue with Ms. Marvel's entire origin:

{{quote|For the eleven years I've been a comics fan, I've been proud of how Marvel resisted the temptation to create male-based heroines à la Supergirl. It's been proudly proclaimed that Ms. Marvel is ''not'' [[Jean Grey|Marvel Girl]]; well, maybe the early Marvel Girl did have weak powers and an insipid personality, but at least her powers were ''her'' powers and her personality was ''her'' personality.... I hope you can change her costume if it's all possible, and keep her on her own instead of associating her with Captain Marvel....<ref>{{Cite comic | writer=Hollingsworth, Jana C. | story=Ms. Prints | title=Ms. Marvel | issue=5 | date=May 1977}}</ref>}}

Another reader had issue with the character's outfit: "Question: where is a woman who wears long sleeves, gloves, high boots and a scarf (winter wear), and at the same time has a bare back, belly, and legs? The Arctic equator? That costume requires a few alterations."<ref>{{Cite comic | writer=Lipp, Debbie | story=Ms. Prints | title=Ms. Marvel | issue=8 | date=August 1977}}</ref> These questions, and the controversial rape in ''Avengers'' #200, caused many readers to question the character's portrayal, and whether she was a good role model for female readers<ref>Chris Claremont, quoted in ''X-Men Companion'' #2 (Fantagraphics, 1982)</ref>:

{{Blockquote|As Carol [Strickland] pointed out in her article in ''LOC'' [#1], women tend to get very short shrift in comics. They are either portrayed as wallflowers or as supermacho insensitive men with different body forms, who almost invariably feel guilty about their lack of femininity. And it's always seemed to me that, why does this have to be exclusive? Can you not have a woman who is ruthless and capable and courageous and articulate and intelligent and all the other buzz-words—heroic when the need arises, and yet feminine and gentle and compassionate, at others? That was what I tried to do with Ms. Marvel. I tried to create a character who had all the attributes that made her a top-secret agent yet at the same time was a compassionate, warm, humorous, witty, intelligent, attractive woman.}}

It has been noted that "Danvers' initial appearances portrayed her as a strong character, but that changed over time—even after she gained super powers."<ref>{{Cite news | title=Heroines shine in 3 titles | last=Munguia | first=Shawn | newspaper=Valley Morning Star | location=Harlingen, Texas | date=March 25, 2008 | url=http://www.valleymorningstar.com/articles/marvel-22310-character-new.html}}</ref> When Ms. Marvel received her own title in the 2000s, Marvel Comics was "determined to have the character take center stage in the Marvel Universe", with "Joe Quesada and the other powers [having] had the character play major roles in their huge 'House of M' crossover, in the 'New Avengers' and in the gargantuan success that is 'Civil War'."<ref name="Maida">{{Cite news | title=She's just Marvel-ous | first=Jerome | last= Maida | newspaper=Philadelphia Daily News | page=35 | date=January 8, 2007}}</ref> "Writer Brian Reed has had Ms. Marvel overcome worthy challenges ranging from alien invasions, time-traveling sorcerers and former teammates turned enemy."<ref name="Maida"/> Brian Reed's characterization of Ms. Marvel (in the "War of the Marvels" story arc<ref name="War of the Marvels"/>) has been said to be "an engaging mix of bravado and aggression juxtaposed with compassion and empathy."<ref name="Wiz220"/>

==Powers and abilities==
Carol Danvers initially possessed superhuman strength, endurance, stamina, flight, physical durability, a limited precognitive "sixth sense", and a perfectly amalgamated human/Kree physiology that rendered her resistant to most toxins and poisons. As Binary, the character could tap the energy of a "[[white hole]]", allowing full control and manipulation of stellar energies, and therefore control over heat, the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] and [[gravity]]. [[Speed of light|Light speed]] travel and the ability to survive in the vacuum of space were also possible.

Although the link to the white hole was eventually severed, Danvers retains her Binary powers on a smaller scale, enabling her to both absorb energy and project it in photonic form. She can also still survive in space. While she lacks a constant source of energy to maintain the abilities at their previous cosmic level, she can temporarily assume her Binary form if empowered with a high enough infusion of energy.

Danvers possesses superhuman strength and durability, can fly at roughly six times the speed of sound,<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #1 (August 2012)</ref> retains her sixth sense, and can discharge explosive blasts of radiant energy, which she fires from her fingertips. She also demonstrates the ability to absorb other forms of energy, such as electricity, to further magnify her strength and energy projection, up to the force of an exploding nuclear weapon.<ref name="The Mighty Avengers 6"/> When sufficiently augmented, she can withstand the pressure from a ninety-two-ton weight, and strike with a similar level of force, although [[Henry Pym|Hank Pym]] theorized that this likely was not her limit.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3, #41 (June 2001)</ref> Danvers cannot absorb magical energy without consequence, though she aided Dr. Stephen Strange in the defeat of the mystic menace, Sir Warren Traveler.<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' vol. 2, #5 (September 2006)</ref>

==Other versions==
==="Age of Apocalypse"===
In the 1995 "[[Age of Apocalypse]]" storyline, a powerless Carol Danvers helps Logan and [[Gateway (comics)|Gateway]] escape at the price of her life, only to be "healed" and used by [[Donald Pierce]] as a living weapon against her friends.<ref>''Weapon X'' #3-4 (May–June 1995). Marvel Comics.</ref>

==="Age of Ultron"===
In the 2013 "[[Age of Ultron]]" storyline, a version of Captain Marvel was seen vacationing in London when the [[Ultron]] Sentinels arrive. Captain Marvel is assisted in the fight against the Ultron Sentinels by [[Captain Britain]] and [[MI-13 (comics)|MI-13]]. After Computer Graham and Magic Boots Mel are killed in battle, Captain Marvel and Captain Britain sacrifice their lives to stop the Ultron Sentinels that were invading London.<ref>''Avengers Assemble'' #15AU.

In the [[Amalgam Comics]] universe, Carol was combined with [[Helena Bertinelli]] of DC Comics and became this reality's [[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} She's a rogue ex-government solo agent (although that may merely have been a cover story for a deep mission{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}) who uses her specialized skills and training as an agent for hire. Her crossbow was developed for her by [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] (Clint [[Green Arrow|Archer]]) of the Judgment League Avengers. She shows up in [[Dark Claw]], where she discovers [[Batman|Dark]] [[Wolverine (character)|Claw's]] secret identity and aids him in tracking down [[Joker (comics)|the]] [[Sabretooth (comics)|Hyena]].<ref>''Legends of the Dark Claw''.

===Marvel Mangaverse===
{{Main|Marvel Mangaverse}}
A version of Danvers appears in the title ''New Mangaverse: The Rings of Fate'' briefly using the callsign Warbird.<ref>''New Mangaverse: The Rings of Fate'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> She later adopts the shield, costume, and name of Captain America at the end of the series.<ref>''New Mangaverse: The Rings of Fate'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> She displays superhuman strength and a near-invulnerability in the miniseries. No genuine explanation is given to how her powers came to exist in the Mangaverse (though it is implied that she somehow gained them after exposure to attacks from the Rings of the Mandarin, as she claims she can feel the power of the Rings while climbing Mt. Fuji in the final issue of the series, indicating she followed them back to their present location on foot from the air base.), as she appears at first as a normal human, piloting what appears to be a variant design of an F-22 while assigned to the Yokota Air Force base and survives her plane being destroyed by agents of the [[Hand (comics)|Hand]], as well as a number of direct attacks which leave her briefly hospitalized, only to awaken with her injuries more or less fully healed and exhibiting superhuman strength as she destroys a heart monitor and needle, then lifts up a bed one handed with no effort. She further displays this enhanced strength when she cleaves Elektra in half with a single swing after climbing Mount Fuji with little real effort, making handholds on her own due to her new strength.<ref>''New Mangaverse: The Rings of Fate'' #4-5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] imprint features a version of the character without superhuman abilities named '''Captain Carol Danvers''' in the "[[Ultimate Galactus Trilogy]]" storyline. As a [[U.S. Air Force]] officer, she was assigned to work on [[Mahr Vehl]]'s security detail with [[Ultimate Nick Fury|General Nick Fury]] when Earth was threatened by [[Galactus#Ultimate Marvel|Gah Lak Tus]].<ref>''Ultimate Exctinction'' #1-5. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Ultimate Nightmare'' #1-5. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Ultimate Secret'' #1-4.

Marvel Comics.</ref> In ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', she works on apprehending [[Alternative versions of the Green Goblin#Ultimate Marvel|Norman Osborn]] after he escapes from the Triskelion.<ref name="Ultimate Spider-Man #111-117">''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #111-117. Marvel Comics.</ref> Things got difficult for her when Norman lied to the press that S.H.I.E.L.D. wrongly imprisoned him for trying to make the world a safer place, putting the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents out of a job.<ref name="Ultimate Spider-Man #111-117"/>

She receives help from [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Spider-Man]] (Peter Parker) after she arrests him in public, hoping that it would lure Norman to her. She summoned a press release and had [[Harry Osborn]] tell the reporters the truth that Norman was a horrible person for experimenting on himself and killing his mother.<ref name="Ultimate Spider-Man #111-117"/> Outraged, Norman went to the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier and attacked his son along with her, Spider-Man, and the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents on board. Norman accidentally killed Harry and, feeling guilty, tells the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents to kill him. Spider-Man becomes angry at Danvers because Harry died on her watch and told her to stay out of his life. She did not do as he asked, but she still felt sorry for him.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #117. Marvel Comics.</ref>

As S.H.I.E.L.D. Director, Danvers was put in command of the newly formed New Ultimates. When Loki attempted another invasion of Earth, Danvers and the women of the team ([[Power Princess|Zarda]] and [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]]) were placed under a spell by [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Amora]]. Danvers, using technology, was able to resist the spell and was able to free the rest of the team to battle Loki's forces.<ref>''New Ultimates'' #1-6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After Spider-Man was captured and replaced by the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]], Danvers decided that having Peter, untrained, loose in the city was doing more harm than good. She approached [[Aunt May|May Parker]] and they both agreed that Peter would attend training lessons from individual members of the New Ultimates.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #150. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Danvers and her New Ultimates battled Nick Fury and his Avengers while each side accused the other of being traitors to S.H.I.E.L.D. and the United States of America. During the fight, Danvers was hit by a Police Cruiser, leaving her in critical condition. Her role as S.H.I.E.L.D. Director was then passed on to [[Gregory Stark]], the one that had in fact engineered the events from the start.<ref>''Avengers vs New Ultimates'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> After Stark is killed, Fury replaced Danvers as director.<ref>''Avengers vs New Ultimates'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===X-Men: The End===
The 2004-2006 miniseries trilogy ''[[X-Men: The End]]'' features a version of the character that exists as pure energy and controls the spaceship the ''Starjammer''.<ref>''X-Men: The End'' vols. 1–3 (October 2004 – July 2006). Marvel Comics.</ref>
