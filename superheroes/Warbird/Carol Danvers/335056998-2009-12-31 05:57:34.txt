'''Ms. Marvel''' is the name of a [[fictional character]] appearing in comic books published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and designed by artist [[Gene Colan]], the non-powered '''Carol Danvers''' debuted as a member of the [[US Air Force]] in ''[[Marvel Super-Heroes (comics)|Marvel Super-Heroes]]'' #13 (1968) and as Ms. Marvel — a fusion of alien [[Kree]] and human [[genes]] — in ''Ms. Marvel'' #1 (Jan. 1977).

Debuting in the [[Silver Age of comic books]], the character featured in a self-titled series in the late 1970s before becoming associated with superhero teams the ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' and ''[[X-Men]]''.  The character has also been known as '''Binary''' and '''Warbird''' at various points in her history, and has featured in other Marvel-endorsed products including arcade and [[video games]]; [[animated]] [[television series]] and merchandise such as [[trading cards]].

==Publication history==
=== 1960s ===
The character debuts in the title ''[[Marvel Super-Heroes]]'' as an [[officer]] in the [[United States Air Force]] and Security Chief of a restricted military base, where Danvers meets "Dr. Henry Lawson", the [[alias]] of [[Extraterrestrial life|Alien]] [[Kree]] hero ''[[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]]''.<ref>''Marvel Super-Heroes'' #13 (Mar. 1968)</ref>

===1970s===
Caught in the explosion of a Kree device, the character gains superhuman abilities and becomes the hero Ms. Marvel. In January 1977, she is featured in a self-titled series<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' #1 - 23 (Jan. 1977 - April 1979)</ref> at first written by [[Gerry Conway]] and later by [[Chris Claremont]]. Ms. Marvel guest-starred alongside the [[wikt:maverick|maverick]] superhero team the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]<ref>''Defenders'' #57 (Mar. 1978)</ref> before assisting the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]<ref>''Avengers'' #171 (May 1978)</ref> against the robot villain [[Ultron]]. The character then had a series of semi-regular appearances in ''The Avengers'', with additional appearances with the Defenders,<ref>''Defenders'' #62 - 63 (Aug. - Sep. 1978)</ref> [[Spider-Man]],<ref>''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #77 (Jan. 1979)</ref> the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]],<ref>''[[Marvel Two-In-One]]'' #51 (May 1979)</ref> and [[Iron Man (comics)|Iron Man]].<ref>''Iron Man'' #125 - 126 (Aug. - Sep. 1979)</ref>

===1980s===
The 200th issue of the ''Avengers''<ref>''Avengers'' #200 (Oct. 1980)</ref> proved controversial when Ms. Marvel was kidnapped by a character named Marcus — the apparent son of Avengers foe [[Immortus]]‚ and taken to an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate dimension]], where she was brainwashed, seduced, and impregnated. The character gives birth on Earth to a child that rapidly ages into another version of Marcus,  who takes Ms. Marvel back to the alternate dimension with no opposition from the Avengers. [[Feminist]] and comic book historian [[Carol A. Strickland]] criticized the storyline in an essay titled "The Rape of Ms. Marvel."<ref>Strickland, Carol A. "The Rape of Ms. Marvel," ''LoC'' #1 (1981).</ref>  Citing Marcus's line ". . . Finally, after relative weeks of such efforts — and admittedly, with a subtle boost from Immortus' machines — you became mine," Strickland posited that Ms. Marvel's impregnation was simply rape by another name. As former writer of the solo title, Chris Claremont also commented on the inappropriateness of the storyline,<ref>In the publication ''X-Men Companion 2'' (Fantagraphics Books, 1982): "Actually, my reaction was a lot stronger than that. But how callous! How cruel! How unfeeling! Considering that <nowiki>[the Avengers]</nowiki> must have seen Ms. Marvel only a couple of days before, or even a couple of months before. She wasn't pregnant then. How could she be eight months pregnant now?"</ref> and effectively "undid" the story in ''Avengers'' Annual #10 (Dec. 1980).<ref>''Avengers'' Annual #10 (Dec. 1980)</ref>

Danvers is revealed to have returned to Earth — courtesy of Immortus' technology after Marcus continued to age and die of old age — but is attacked by the mutant [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], who permanently absorbs the character's abilities and memories. Danvers' memories are later restored by [[Professor X]], and an angry confrontation with the Avengers concerning their apathy follows. Claremont continued to develop the character in the title ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'', as using [[espionage]], Danvers enters [[the Pentagon]] and wiped old government files on the X-Men.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #158 (June 1982).</ref> During an adventure in space with the mutant team the [[X-Men]], Danvers is changed courtesy of experimentation by the alien race the [[Brood (comics)|Brood]] into a newly empowered character called ''Binary''.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #164 (Dec. 1982).</ref> Drawing on the power of a cosmic phenomenon called a [[white hole]], Danvers becomes capable of generating the power of a star. As Binary, the character has a number of encounters with the X-Men,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #166 - 167 (Feb. - Mar. 1983); #171 + 174 (July + Oct. 1983) & #200 - 201 (Dec. 1985 - Jan. 1986)</ref> [[New Mutants]],<ref>''New Mutants'' #19 (Sep. 1984) & #50 - 51 (Apr. - May 1987).</ref> a solo adventure,<ref>''[[Marvel Fanfare]]'' #24 (Jan. 1986)</ref> and with the offbeat team [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]].<ref>''Excalibur'' #17 (Dec. 1989)</ref>

Claremont expanded on the incident with the character Rogue by having the Ms. Marvel persona slowly assert itself on the villain-turned-hero. This happened to Rogue on two occasions<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #182 (June 1984); #203 (Mar. 1986) & #235 - 239 (Oct. 1988 - Feb. 1989)</ref> before she eventually completely falls under its control to the extent of donning an old Ms. Marvel costume.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #246 - 247 (July - Aug. 1989)</ref> [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] is eventually able to destroy the persona and free Rogue.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #269 (Oct. 1990).</ref>

===1990s===
The character continued to make sporadic appearances,<ref>''X-Men Spotlight On... Starjammers'' #1 - 2 (May - June 1990)</ref> and two additional issues planned for the original title — prevented by cancellation — were printed in a quarterly anthology series.<ref>''Marvel Super-Heroes'' #10 - 11 (1992)</ref> The same year the character was also used extensively in the storyline ''[[Operation Galactic Storm]]''.<ref>A multi-issue arc that was published from March to May and spanned the titles Avengers and [[Avengers West Coast]], and the individual hero titles [[Captain America]]; [[Iron Man (comics)|Iron Man]]; [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]]; [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and [[Wonder Man]]</ref> By the conclusion of the story the character has expended almost all her new abilities, reverting to use of the original Ms. Marvel powers, but retaining the energy manipulation powers she had as Binary, albeit on a smaller scale.

After several more team and solo appearances<ref>''Avengers'' #350 - 351 (both Aug. 1992); ''Starblast'' #1 (Jan. 1994); ''[[X-Men Unlimited]]'' #1 (Dec. 1996) & 'Excalibur'' #116 (Jan. 1998)</ref> the character then rejoins the Avengers<ref>''Avengers'' (vol. 3), #4 (May 1998)</ref> with the new alias ''Warbird''. Writer [[Kurt Busiek]] adds a new dimension to the character and casts her as an [[alcoholic]], struggling to come to terms with the loss of her cosmic powers and memories. Danvers disgraces herself during the "Live Kree or Die" storyline<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 3, #7; [[Captain America]] vol. 3, #8; ''[[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]]'' #10 and ''Avengers'' #7 (all Aug. 1998)</ref> and is soon suspended from active duty.<ref>''Avengers'' #8 (Sep. 1998)</ref>

After a brief appearance in Marvel's [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] title ''[[What If (comics)|What If?]]'',<ref>''[[What If (comics)|What If?]]'' vol. 2, #111 (Aug. 1998)</ref> the character features in Iron Man,<ref>''Iron Man'' #12 (Jan. 1999)</ref> [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]],<ref>''Wolverine'' #133 - 134 (Jan. - Feb. 1999)</ref> the Avengers, and Iron Man once more<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3, #17 - 18 (June - July 1999) & #21 (Oct. 1999); ''Iron Man'' #18 (July 1999)</ref> before making a cameo appearance in [[X-Man]].<ref>''[[Mutant X]]'' #14 (Nov. 1999)</ref>

===2000s===
The character then featured as "Captain Marvel" in a false reality created by mutant the [[Scarlet Witch]] in limited series [[House of M]].<ref>''House of M'' #1 - 8 (Aug. to Dec. 2005)</ref> This reality pandered to Carol's subconscious desire to be accepted as she proved to be the most popular superhero on Earth. Ms. Marvel then came to prominence again when the character was launched in a second self-titled volume<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' vol. 2, #1 (Mar. 2006)</ref> Together with fellow Avenger Iron Man, Carol also becomes a principal advocate of the [[Registration acts (comics)#2006 Superhuman Registration Act|Superhuman Registration Act]] during the events of ''[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]''.<ref>''Civil War'' #1 - 7 (July 2006 - Jan. 2007)</ref> The story also continues in Ms. Marvel's own title as the character battles the anti-registration heroes led by Captain America.<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' vol. 2, #6 - 8 (Oct. - Dec. 2006)</ref>

The storyline has major consequences for the [[New Avengers]], with the team splitting and the pro-registration heroes - including Ms. Marvel - forming their own team, debuting in ''[[Mighty Avengers]]''.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #1 (May 2007)</ref> Carol enters into a relationship with fellow member [[Wonder Man]],<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #6 (Sep. 2007)</ref> appears in a [[intercompany crossover|crossover]] series with the robot [[Transformers]],<ref>''New Avengers/Transformers'' #1 - 4 (Sep. - Dec. 2007)</ref> and becomes leader of the Mighty Avengers.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #7 (Oct. 2007)</ref> The character makes an agreement with [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]], director of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], to lead a covert strike team called ''Operation: Lightning Storm'', its' designated mission the elimination of super villains before they become global threats.<ref>''Ms Marvel'' vol. 2, #13 (May 2007)</ref>

After teaming with [[Spider-Man]]<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' Annual (2008)</ref> Ms. Marvel also plays a significant role in the limited series ''[[Secret Invasion]]''<ref>''Secret Invasion'' (June 2008 - Jan. 2009)</ref> against the alien shape-shifting [[Skrull]]s. At the conclusion of the war with the Skrulls, [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] is placed in charge of the registered Avengers team. Refusing to serve under Osborn, Ms. Marvel flees Avengers Tower<ref name="Dark Avengers #1 Jan. 2009">''Dark Avengers'' #1 (Jan. 2009)</ref> and joins the ''[[New Avengers]]'',<ref>''New Avengers #48'' (Dec. 2008)</ref> becoming second-in-command.<ref>''New Avengers'' #51 (Mar. 2009)</ref>  Osborn appoints former [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolt]] member [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]] (Karla Sofen) as the "new" Ms. Marvel to his [[Dark Avengers]] team; Moonstone wears a variation of Ms. Marvel's original costume.<ref name="Dark Avengers #1 Jan. 2009"/> Osborn engineers a battle that results in Danvers' powers overloading, causing her apparent death.  The character Moonstone takes over the title role in the ongoing ''Ms. Marvel'' series.<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' #38 (June 2009)</ref>

Carol Danvers returns with the aid of the New Avengers, a group of [[MODOK]] [[embryos]] (creations of organization [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|Advanced Idea Mechanics (AIM)]]) and a character known as the '' Storyteller'' and reclaims the title of Ms. Marvel from Karla Sofen.<ref>''Ms. Marvel'' vol. 2, #41 - 46 (Nov. 2009)</ref>

==Characterization==
Writer [[Gerry Conway]] played a significant role in the character's subsequent development, writing in his introduction to the series, ". . . you might see a parallel between ''her'' quest for identity, and the modern woman's quest for raised consciousness, for self-liberation, for identity."<ref name="MsPrint">Conway, Gerry. "Ms. Prints," ''Ms. Marvel'' #1 (Jan. 1977).</ref>

Ms. Marvel's costume and powers, however, were derived from the character's then-contemporary male counterpart: Captain Marvel. Furthermore, the character's blonde hair and civilian name of '''Carol Danvers''' form a clear connection to DC Comics's [[Linda Lee Danvers|Supergirl]], a character created entirely in imitation of a male counterpart (and whose secret identity was '''''Linda Lee'' Danvers''').<ref>Klorese, Roger. "Ms. Prints," Ms. Marvel #6 (Marvel Comics, June 1977): "Even the colors of her costume . . . suggest that another Danvers was there first, before Carol-come-lately."</ref>

The ''Ms. Marvel'' [[comic book letter column|letters page]] ("Ms. Prints") featured letters debating whether or not the character was feminist. Reader (and frequent [[letterhack]]) Jana C. Hollingsworth took issue with Ms. Marvel's entire origin: {{cquote|For the eleven years I've been a comics fan, I've been proud of how Marvel resisted the temptation to create male-based heroines à la Supergirl. It's been proudly proclaimed that Ms. Marvel is ''not'' [[Jean Grey|Marvel Girl]]; well, maybe the early Marvel Girl did have weak powers and an insipid personality, but at least her powers were ''her'' powers and her personality was ''her'' personality. . . . I hope you can change her costume if it's all possible, and keep her on her own instead of associating her with Captain Marvel. . .  .<ref>Hollingsworth, Jana C. "Ms. Prints," ''Ms. Marvel'' #5 (Marvel Comics, May 1977).</ref>}}

Another reader had issue with the hero's costume: "Question: where is a woman who wears long sleeves, gloves, high boots and a scarf (winter wear), and at the same time has a bare back, belly, and legs? The Arctic equator? That costume requires a few alterations."<ref>Lipp, Debbie. "Ms. Prints," ''Ms. Marvel'' #8 (Marvel Comics, Aug. 1977).</ref> These questions, and the controversial rape of ''Avengers'' #200, caused many readers to question the character's portrayal, and whether she was a good role model for female readers.<ref>Chris Claremont, quoted in ''X-Men Companion'' #2 (Fantagraphics, 1982):
{{blockquote|As Carol [Strickland] pointed out in her article in ''LOC'' [#1], women tend to get very short shrift in comics. They are either portrayed as wallflowers or as supermacho insensitive men with different body forms, who almost invariably feel guilty about their lack of femininity. And it's always seemed to me that, why does this have to be exclusive? Can you not have a woman who is ruthless and capable and courageous and articulate and intelligent and all the other buzz-words — heroic when the need arises, and yet feminine and gentle and compassionate, at others? That was what I tried to do with Ms. Marvel. I tried to create a character who had all the attributes that made her a top-secret agent yet at the same time was a compassionate, warm, humorous, witty, intelligent, attractive woman.}}</ref>

It has been noted that "Danvers' initial appearances portrayed her as a strong character, but that changed over time — even after she gained super powers."<ref>'Heroines shine in 3 titles.'' Shawn Munguia. ''Valley Morning Star'' (Harlingen, Texas). LIFESTYLE. March 26, 2008.</ref> When Ms. Marvel received her own title in the 2000s, Marvel was "determined to have the character take center stage in the Marvel Universe" with "Joe Quesada and the other powers [having] had the character play major roles in their huge 'House of M' crossover, in the 'New Avengers' and in the gargantuan success that is "Civil War."<ref name="Maida">''She's just MARVEL-ous.''

==Powers and abilities==
Ms. Marvel initially possessed superhuman strength, endurance, stamina, flight, physical durability and a limited precognitive "seventh sense". As Binary, the character could tap the energy of a "[[white hole]]", allowing manipulation of stellar energies, and therefore control over heat, the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] and [[gravity]]. [[speed of light|Light speed]] travel and the ability to exist in the vacuum of space were also possible.

Although the link to the white hole was eventually severed, Ms. Marvel retains her Binary powers on a smaller scale, enabling her to both absorb energy and project it in photonic form. The character, however, lacks a constant source of energy to maintain the abilities at their previous cosmic level.

Carol Danvers is also an exceptional espionage agent, hand-to-hand combatant and markswoman.

==Other versions==

The [[Ultimate Marvel]] imprint features a powerless version of the character. In the title ''[[Ultimate Power]]'' the character becomes acting Director of spy organization [[S.H.I.E.L.D.#Ultimate_S.H.I.E.L.D.|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] after [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]]'s disappearance.<ref>''Ultimate Power'' #9 (Feb. 2008)</ref>

===X-Men: The End===
