'''Andromeda Attumasen''' is a character in [[Marvel Comics]] fictional [[Marvel Universe]].

==History==
A member of the [[Homo mermanus]] race, Andromeda is the first born daughter of [[Attuma]] of [[Atlantis (comics)|Atlantis]] by his [[Lady Gelva]]. She was raised by her father as a boy, trained in the arts of hunting and war and she exceeded any other male except for her father in these skills. Despite her skills, she was considered unworthy of being his successor, because she was a woman. Andromeda left her father's kingdom and went to the underwater kingdom of [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]]. Namor gave her a position in his army and even awarded her with the rank of [[Major]] for her bravery, but again she was denied any further career advancement because of her gender. 

Andromeda, inspired by Namor's tales, moved to the surface world, where she used a serum to give herself a human appearance and the ability to breathe out of water. She took the name Andrea McPhee. She quickly abandoned her charade and became a member of the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]

She died battling the Defender [[Moondragon]], who had become possessed by the '''Dragon of the Moon'''. Moondragon sacrificed herself to stop the Dragon, but the Dragon would later return, this time without a body. 
To stop the Dragon of the Moon, [[Doctor Strange]] cast a spell which returned the souls of the Defenders fallen in the battle against the Dragon to the bodies of several recently deceased humans, changing them into duplicates of the Defenders. Andromeda's soul entered the body of '''Genevieve Cross''' and the Defenders now called themselves the '''Dragon Circle'''. Together the Dragon Circle banished the Dragon from Earth and Andromeda returned to the oceans.  

In the [[1989]] ''[[Atlantis Attacks]]'' crossover, Andromeda lead a rebellion to stop her father Attuma from invading the surface world, but she was one of the "Seven Brides of [[Set (Serpent God)|Set]]" kidnapped by the [[Deviants|Deviant]] priest [[Ghaur]]. In the end the Brides of Set gained their freedom. 

Andromeda joined her forces with those of Namor. She was part of the short-lived '''Deep Six''', a group of underwater heroes. During this time her mind and that of Genevieve Cross would repeatedly exchange control and even turn her body into a copy of Genevieve's. Andromeda sacrificed her own mind to save Namor's soul, leaving Genevieve in control of Andromeda's body. Months later, either Genevieve in Andromeda's body or a restored Andromeda herself assisted Namor and the Defenders against Attuma's own Deep Six. Andromeda was last seen as an ally of Namor, living in Atlantis.

==Powers and abilities==
Andromeda has all the powers inherent to the ''[[Homo mermanus]]'', but her strength is far greater than that of any regular ''Homo mermanus'', though not as great as that of her father or Namor. She is adapted to live underwater, having gills that allow her to breathe underwater, she can swim at high speeds and her body is resistant against the pressure and the cold of the deep oceans. 
She can survive only for 10 minutes out of water though, unless she uses a special serum that gives her the ability to breathe air.
She is very skilled in the arts of hunting and war, wielding a trident as her weapon of choice.

* Genevieve Cross is called Genevieve Cass in the Dragon Circle entry in the Handbook of the Marvel Universe '89 edition.
