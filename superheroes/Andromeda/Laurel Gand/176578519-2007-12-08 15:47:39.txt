'''Laurel Gand''', codenamed '''Andromeda''', is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]]ine in the future of the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]], and a member of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]].  She was initially created as a replacement for [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]] in [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|post-Crisis]] Legion continuity, but is very different from her.  She was also inspired by elements of [[Superman]]'s supposed descendant [[Laurel Kent]] (who, in post-Crisis, pre-[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]] continuity, was revealed to be a [[Manhunters (comics)|Manhunter]] android).

==Fictional character biography==
===Pre-Zero Hour===
In the Glorithverse continuity, Laurel Gand essentially replaced Supergirl in Legion history; wherever Kara Zor-El had made an appearance, now Laurel was there instead.  The pre-''Zero Hour'' Laurel was similar to the pre-Crisis Supergirl in that she was a distant relative of the Glorithverse's [[Superboy (Kal-El)|Superboy]] analogue, [[Lar Gand|Valor]], and upon arriving on Earth had posed as a shy, bookish young woman, complete with glasses.  As a child, Laurel fought off a [[Khund]]ish attack force threatening to invade [[Daxam]].  Living in exile on Earth and fearing vengeance from the Khunds, Laurel jumped at the chance to join the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]].

Where the pre-Crisis Supergirl had been romantically linked to [[Brainiac 5]], so too was Laurel Gand.  However, Laurel and Brainy eventually parted ways, and after the "Five Year Gap" it was revealed (much to Brainiac's dismay) that Laurel had married [[Rond Vidar]] and borne a daughter, Lauren.  Laurel spent her years away from the Legion singlehandedly beating Khund forces back from the United Planets systems, and rejoined the reunited Legionnaires when her husband Rond disappeared while on a mission to rescue [[Mysa Nal]], the White Witch, from [[Mordru|Mordru the Merciless]].  Laurel proved a tremendous asset to the new Legion during the war against Earthgov and the Dominators.  When the mysterious "Batch SW6" doppleganger Legion appeared, the younger "SW6" Laurel distinguished herself from her adult counterpart by taking on the codename "Andromeda" and wearing a colorful gold and black costume.  It is unknown whether the adult Laurel ever used "Andromeda" or any other codename during her own youth in the Legion.

The adult Laurel stayed with her Legion when it was forced to go underground to fight corruption in the Science Police, taking on the de facto codename "Gand".  Tragically, Laurel was killed by a terrorist bomb during one of the renegade Legion's early missions.  Shortly thereafter, Laurel, her younger self, and the rest of the Legion(s) were erased from history following the [[Zero Hour (comics)|''Zero Hour'']] [[Reboot (continuity)|reboot]].

===Post-Zero Hour Reboot===
Laurel Gand spent most of her life in a White Triangle community, being indoctrinated in the "horrors" of interspecies co-operation before the Triangle's political clout led her to become the Daxamite representative in the Legion.  Away from [[Daxam]]'s red sun, she gained powers similar to [[Superman]]'s, but the race-wide hypersensitivity of Daxamites to lead that meant even minuscule amounts could prove fatal even to a powered-up Daxamite, forcing her to wear a transuit at all times.  This did not trouble her, since it meant she never had to actually touch any non-Daxamites.

Her Triangle-derived beliefs hampered her effectiveness as a Legionnaire, thanks to her reluctance to physically engage with any enemies, but the real problems started after she let several Triangle members go after a mugging, shortly after which they beat and almost killed [[Triad (comics)|Triad]].  Angered more for their defiance of her than for the beating, when she was ordered away to prevent the Composite Man gaining her powers, she flew after them.  Immediately, they tore her transuit and directly exposed her to lead, and she barely managed to turn them over to the [[Science Police]] before crashing through the walls of Legion HQ.

While [[Brainiac 5]] worked on devising an anti-lead serum, he confronted her about her beliefs, and after discovering the serum [[Vril Dox II]], his direct ancestor, had created for [[Lar Gand|Valor]] and tailoring it to her genetic structure to allow it to work properly on her (much to her surprise, as she had been taught that all members of the same race were identical), he forced her to confront the fact that he wasn't her inferior before giving her the serum.  While this was happening, however, [[Violet (comics)|Shrinking Violet]] discovered a White Triangle necklace in her room and connected it to the group which had assaulted Triad and destroyed [[Trom]], telling the rest of the team.

Confined to quarters after an unsuccessful attempt by [[Cosmic Boy]] to have her removed from the team, she used her super-senses to see Ambassador Roxxas gloating, but he managed to bully her into giving him the anti-lead serum.  Taking it himself and giving it to four other Daxamites, they proceeded to cause mass destruction on Earth.  When Andromeda herself confronted Roxxas over what he was doing and had made her do, she was almost defeated when Violet began thrashing around in his head, before coming out and telling Andromeda to take him down.  As she pummelled him repeatedly, he destroyed the covering of an "atomic furnace", and both were thought to have died in the resulting inferno (causing Brainiac 5 severe depression).  Only Cosmic Boy was told that she had survived and voluntarily exiled herself to Planet Hell.

Later, she was brought out of this exile by [[Live Wire (DC Comics)|Live Wire]] after Cosmic Boy had told him where she was as part of a way to build up a "Legion Rescue Squad", and she was awed by Valor, himself being another member.  However, she declined to rejoin the Legion after the Squad had served its purpose, preferring to head off into deep space. She eventually joined a religious convent.

After the events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Andromeda, (as well as [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Catalogued Earths|Earth-247]], the home of the Post-Zero Hour Legion), was erased from continuity.

===1001 Years Later===
Laurel has yet to make an appearance in the new version of the Legion. Considering that [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Kara Zor-El]], the character Andromeda was created to replace is now back in continuity, it remains to be seen whether or not Laurel Gand will return.

==Powers and abilities==
As a Daxamite, Andromeda has the full range of [[Powers and abilities of Superman|Kryptonian-like powers]], including great super-strength, the ability to fly unaided, to move in space without breathing apparatus and at superluminal speed, heat vision, telescopic vision and super-hearing.

Following the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]], Superman was greatly depowered as compared to his earlier power levels.  During the ''Time After Time'' story arc, when he was careening through time, he went to the 30th Century and fought a super-powered Daxamite; it was clearly established that Daxamites were more powerful than Kryptonians. (However, since then, Superman has had a steady gradual power creep and his power levels would now almost certainly equal or exceed a Daxamite.)

==Andromeda in other media==
Andromeda appears with [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] in ''[[Justice League Adventures]]'' (the comic book adaptation of the modern [[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League animated series]]) #28.  She is shown as girlfriend of Brainiac 5. 

In ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', she made a cameo appearance in the episode "New Kids In Town".

Whether or not Andromeda will have a role in the [[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)]] remains to be seen.  Not only is a young Superman a team member in the series, but in one of the final episodes of ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', Supergirl is shown not only meeting but joining the Legion (though the ''Legion'' series is separate from the [[DC animated universe]] that ''JLU'' was included in, much like ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'').
