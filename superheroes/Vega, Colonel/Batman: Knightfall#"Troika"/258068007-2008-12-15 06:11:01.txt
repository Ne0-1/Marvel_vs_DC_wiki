'''''Batman: Knightfall''''' is the title given to a major [[Batman]] [[story arc]] published by [[DC Comics]] that dominated [[Batman]]-related serial [[comic book]]s in the spring and summer of 1993. ''Knightfall'' is also the umbrella title to the trilogy of storylines that ran from 1993 to 1994. They consisted of "'''''Knightfall'''''", "'''''Knightquest'''''", and "'''''KnightsEnd'''''"; on the comic book covers, only the third part had its title written in [[CamelCase]], perhaps to keep it from being read as Knight-Send. The entire ''Knightfall'' storyline took over a year to complete in the comic book serials, and in later years, the comics were compressed into a series of trade paperbacks, although these paperbacks do not include the ''Knightquest'' portion of the story with the exception of ''Robin: Flying Solo'', which contains ''Robin'' #1, a part of ''Knightquest''.  

==Storyline==
===Prelude===
The prelude to ''Knightfall'' began with the introduction of two new characters key to its storyline in issues prior to the release of ''Knightfall'':

*[[Azrael (comics)|Azrael]], aka Jean-Paul Valley, introduced in ''Batman: The Sword of Azrael'' (October 1992 to January 1993) by [[Dennis O'Neil]] and [[Joe Quesada]].
*[[Bane (comics)|Bane]], introduced in ''Batman: Vengeance of Bane'' (January 1993) by [[Chuck Dixon]] and [[Graham Nolan]].

The two characters were quickly added to the cast in the monthly ''Batman'' titles, with Azrael being a superhero-in-training who fights alongside Batman, while Bane was introduced as a villain. 

Within the regular series, the buildup to ''Knightfall'' begins with a five-issue run in ''Batman'' #484-488 (September 1992 - January 1993), in which Batman (at the onset of a personal psychological [[mid-life crisis]]) is forced to deal, in rapid succession, with the returning villain [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]] and his gang (who target Bruce Wayne and [[Lucius Fox]]), a crazed killer called Metalhead, and a [[sharpshooter]] assassin hired by Vincent Morelli to murder Commissioner Gordon. Batman begins to feel he has lost his edge, especially after his failure to capture Black Mask. He finds himself unable to [[meditate]] or even focus. As Bruce Wayne, he contacts [[holistic]] therapist [[Shondra Kinsolving]] for treatment. He also assigns Robin (Tim Drake) to train Jean-Paul Valley in detective work to aid them as an ally, hoping to guide his brainwashing away from making him a villainous threat. Despite the advice of everyone in his life, including Dr. Kinsolving, Bruce refuses to rest, and continues to pursue his self-imposed duty despite his worsening condition.

The next storyline, in ''Detective Comics'' #654-656 (December 1992 - February 1993), involves a young military student usurping power in Gotham's underworld and assaulting a police station, with Bruce's fatigue continuing to worsen. At the conclusion of this story, Bane and his henchman are shown monitoring Batman's performance.

Bane begins a series of encounters letting Batman know of his presence and his intentions. In the following issues, Bane interferes with encounters pitting villains [[Killer Croc]] and [[Riddler]] against Batman, and, to test Batman's limits, goes so far as to inject Riddler with the [[List of comic book drugs#Venom|Venom]] drug. This escalation culminates in an assault on [[Arkham Asylum]] in ''Batman'' #491 (April 1993), where Bane breaks the inmates free and supplies them with numerous weapons to escape. (Despite being included in the ''Knightfall'' trade paperbacks, ''Batman'' #491 is not marked as a part of ''Knightfall'' in the monthly comic book format.) Meanwhile, Robin finds it difficult to work with Jean-Paul, due to the man's violent subconscious training and lack of social skills, and also finds himself being shut out from working alongside Batman.

The plot of ''Knightfall'' begins with the master criminal Bane freeing all of the maximum-security inmates of [[Arkham Asylum]], a notorious psychiatric facility in [[Gotham City]]. Aware that he would lose in a direct assault against Batman, Bane's plan consists of weakening Batman by forcing him to deal with the deadly villains simultaneously. Among the freed inmates, there are numerous high-profile villains, such as the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]], who trapped Arkham's administrator [[Jeremiah Arkham]], and the [[Scarecrow (comics)|Scarecrow]], as well as many less known villains, such as the [[Mad Hatter (comics)|Mad Hatter]], [[Ventriloquist (comics)|The Ventriloquist]], [[Firefly (comics)|Firefly]], [[Cavalier (comics)|Cavalier]], and [[Zsasz|Victor Zsasz]]. The scenario creates a rift in the relationship between [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] and Batman, as Batman seeks to face the outbreak alone. Indeed, in later issues, [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Tim Drake]], the current Robin, asks Batman if he is even needed as his sidekick anymore.

Over the next few issues, Batman becomes weaker and weaker as each criminal is put away. The combination of the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] and [[Scarecrow (comics)|Scarecrow]] takes Batman to his mental and physical limits. After this encounter, Bane makes his move and attacks Batman (by this time, Bane had deduced the identity of Batman to be [[Batman|Bruce Wayne]]) at [[Wayne Manor]], where he is most vulnerable as his alter-ego. The fight between Bruce Wayne and Bane is detailed in ''Batman'' #497, and ends in Bane breaking Wayne's back over his knee.<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation  | last = Beatty  | first = Scott | author-link =  | contribution = Batman | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 40-44  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = London  | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5}}</ref>  With Batman supposedly out of the way, Bane assumes control of Gotham City and begins to take over a number of illegal operations within it.

After his defeat, Bruce Wayne enlists the aid of [[Shondra Kinsolving|Dr. Shondra Kinsolving]] to rehabilitate him and asks [[Azrael (comics)|Jean-Paul Valley (Azrael)]] to take up the mantle of Batman so that Gotham has a protector. Tim Drake argues with Bruce to allow [[Dick Grayson]] (the former Robin) to become Batman, as he is more experienced and mentally competent. However, Bruce says that Dick is his own man now, with his own responsibilities and would only do so reluctantly; Dick later expressed resentment at not being asked to stand in as Batman. Bruce's rationale for this decision is revealed in later issues - secretly, he doesn't want Dick to have to face Bane, as he knows Dick's character will compel him to try. Bruce gives Jean-Paul strict orders never to engage Bane in combat; indeed, when Jean-Paul faces Bane, only his modified gloves save him from being thrown to his death.

Soon after, Kinsolving and Tim's father [[Jack Drake]] are kidnapped and Bruce and [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]] leave the country to find them - their story is continued in ''Knightquest: The Search'', whilst the happenings in Gotham are recorded in ''Knightquest: The Crusade''. Paul is shown as a different but not dangerous Batman until an encounter with the Scarecrow, which culminates in Jean-Paul being infected by Scarecrow's fear gas and the "System" - his programming as Azrael - taking over, in order to combat Jean-Paul's fear. Following this, Jean-Paul is unable to shake the influence of the System, giving into it completely after his first defeat at Bane's hands, and being increasingly influenced by it during the rest of his tenure as Batman. Gradually, Jean-Paul alienates Robin and becomes paranoid and arrogant, the opposite of what Bruce had chosen him for. In ''Batman'' #500, Jean-Paul in his new mechanical Batsuit, confronts Bane in a vicious battle and eventually prevails. Jean-Paul leaves Bane broken mentally and physically, although he struggles with the choice of whether to simply kill Bane or hand him over to the police. Stating that he will let Bane go to Blackgate Prison, Jean-Paul continues to watch over Gotham after the fight, but grows increasingly unstable.

The massive story was quickly collected into two volumes of [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]]s. Volume one was subtitled ''Broken Bat'' and the second was ''Who Rules the Night''.

===''Knightquest''===
"''Knightfall''" was immediately followed by "''Knightquest''" in the monthly serials. "''Knightquest''" is divided into two storylines, one following Bruce Wayne (''Knightquest: The Search'') and the other on the new Batman (''Knightquest: The Crusade''). The stories were not treated as crossovers and the ''Batman'' titles continued as they had before ''Knightfall'' where the creative teams each pursued their own storylines. This however leads to some contradictions within the story between the different comic titles. 

The issues that make up the ''Knightquest'' saga are highly sought after by comic completists{{Fact|date=June 2008}} as they were never collected into trade paperback format; "''KnightsEnd''" was released as a trade paperback directly after the two "''Knightfall''" collections.

====''The Crusade''====
[[Image:Det667.jpg|right|thumb|Jean-Paul as Batman. Cover to ''Detective Comics'' #667.  Art by Kelley Jones.]]
'''''Knightquest: The Crusade''''' follows the story of Jean-Paul Valley as he becomes increasingly violent and mentally unbalanced as he replaces Bruce Wayne as Batman in Gotham. During this time, he drives Robin away because he believes Gotham post-Bane to be so tough that only violence could answer its criminals. Indeed, in several issues Robin is left horrified as Jean-Paul ferociously attacks common criminals, often with a weapon and sometimes nearly to death. This surge of violence from Gotham's defender put pressure on Batman's relationship with Police Commissioner Gordon, who begins to distrust and even fear the new Batman and eventually comes to realize he is not the original. 

All of Jean-Paul's actions are compelled by "The System"; on numerous occasions, he sees the ghosts of his ancestors giving him advice on how to run Gotham and he is driven to near insanity by the time the saga ends. He repeatedly redesigns his Batman costume, adding more [[gadget]]s and lethal weapons, including laser, razor-sharp [[Batarang]]s and a flame-thrower. Eventually, he also adds a Bat-symbol, matching the one used for the series' logo. Valley expresses desire, through narrative, to be a better Batman than Bruce Wayne, especially when he discovers his lack of interest in detective work caused him to make false assumptions about Catwoman (he thought she would sell a powerful nerve gas to terrorists when she merely wanted to dispose of it so it couldn't be used to hurt anyone). His questionable actions culminate when he encounters the [[serial killer]] [[Abattoir (comics)|Abattoir]], who is keeping an innocent prisoner in a secret [[torture chamber]]. Jean-Paul purposely lets Abattoir die, thereby condemning the prisoner to death as well. Other notable villains Jean-Paul faces include [[Mr. Freeze]], Joker, and [[Clayface]]. Of these villains, the most notable encounters are with Catwoman and the Joker, both of whom could tell Valley wasn't the original Batman (Catwoman because he didn't give out the pheromones that Bruce did and Joker mainly because of his psychotic bond with Batman but also by judging his movements and seeing that they weren't as graceful as Bruce's).

====''The Search''====
'''''Knightquest: The Search''''' follows Bruce Wayne and Alfred's search for [[Jack Drake]] and [[Shondra Kinsolving]], with whom Bruce Wayne falls in love in the midst of his rehabilitation sessions. Kinsolving's brother-by-adoption Benedict Asp kidnapped her to use her [[superpower (ability)|special powers]] to kill people at a distance. Asp demonstrates this new form of mass murder on a small English village. When Bruce Wayne finds Kinsolving, he finds himself caught in the middle of a telekinetic tug-of-war between Asp and Kinsolving. The battle climaxes with her refocusing her energy to defeat Asp, with a side effect of the battle being that Bruce's broken spine becomes healed. However, the drugs forced onto her by Asp, not to mention the effects of the fight with Asp, reduce her mind to that of a child, and Wayne reluctantly puts her into a [[Psychiatric hospital|mental institution]].

Bruce eventually leaves England to return home to a civilian life in Gotham, but Alfred remains in England, not wanting to see Bruce Wayne damage his body further. He does not return to Gotham until a while later, when [[Dick Grayson]] persuades him to do so in later issues.

===''KnightsEnd''===
Although previous parts of ''KnightSaga'' had taken considerable time to run their course, the entirety of ''KnightsEnd'' was published within two months, as the ''Batman'' books had to prepare themselves for the impending ''Zero Hour'', which would immediately follow the ''KnightSaga'' (the Zero issues focusing on aspects of Batman and Robin's origins). As a result, nothing was truncated and the ''Batman'' series made use of all of the Batman related titles at their disposal, such as ''Catwoman'', ''Robin'' and the (usually set in Year One) ''Legends of the Dark Knight'' that led the story to its conclusion.  

Jean-Paul Valley sees visions of his dead father, who had programmed him at birth to be a deadly weapon. These visions tell Jean-Paul to avenge his father's death, and Jean-Paul searches Gotham for his father's killer. Though the killer, Carlton Lehah, had already been encountered and defeated in ''Sword of Azrael'', Jean Paul's conditioning had warped his mind to the extent that he no longer remembered the incident. He eventually comes to believe that Selkirk, a Gotham mobster who has taken over the remnants of Lehah's organization, is his father's murderer.

Returning to Gotham, Bruce meets Robin. He is impressed enough with Jean-Paul to let him remain as Batman but when Robin tells him of Abattoir's death, Bruce sneaks into the Batcave and demands that Jean-Paul step down. Jean-Paul refuses and threatens to kill Bruce if he ever returns. In response, Bruce asks the deadly assassin [[Lady Shiva]] to retrain him. Since Bruce had once been the only person capable of surviving a fight with her, he figures that nobody could better prepare him to fight Jean-Paul. Shiva pits Bruce against several expert martial artists after killing their master in what would become Bruce's disguise, the Mask of Tengu (a bat spirit).<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Shiva's caveat is that these attacks will continue indefinitely until Bruce Wayne breaks his solemn vow to never take a life. Finally, in the midst of another attack, Bruce uses the deadly [[Leopard Blow]] Shiva had taught him, leaving his would-be assailant dead and Shiva finally declaring him worthy of fighting her (at some point in the future). Without Bruce noticing, [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Robin]] and [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] had tailed him and saw the whole thing. As Shiva departed and Wayne was left to hear Nightwing chastise him over how everything Batman had ever taught was a lie, the man struck by the Leopard Blow came back around, as Bruce had merely struck him hard enough that Shiva would believe for the time being that Wayne had killed the man. Bruce had figured out that Shiva put a radio transmitter in his mask, and decided that he was back to peak physical condition and thus did not need any more from Shiva. 

Bruce returns to the Batcave and dons the new-look [[Batsuit]]. Along with Robin and Nightwing, he tracks Valley down to Selkirk's penthouse, as the other heroes had been watching Jean-Paul for a while and knew he sought his father's killer. Coincidentally, [[Catwoman]] is chasing the same man because he owns a neural enabler that might allow a paraplegic to walk again. Selkirk already wants to kill Jean-Paul for destroying a valuable weapons cache in Gotham Harbor.

When they eventually all meet, mass fighting and gunfire ensue. The battle ends in the mobster's helicopter as Jean-Paul's grapnel gun locks one of the rotors and Catwoman knocks away a gun intended to kill Bruce and Jean-Paul. Selkirk's helicopter crashes into the Gotham Narrows Bridge; coupled with fuel from the chopper mixing with Jean-Paul's flame-thrower, Jean-Paul falls into the Gotham River. Bruce and Catwoman save Selkirk and his aides just before the helicopter explodes from the leaking gasoline. When Bruce tries to find Jean-Paul using the Batmobile, it explodes. Having realized that Jean-Paul would have booby-trapped the car, Bruce escapes just in time. After the explosion, Nightwing fears Bruce dead and takes his vengeance out on Jean-Paul on a party boat. The police arrive in time to prevent Nightwing's murder, but Jean-Paul escapes. However, to his shock, Jean-Paul finds Bruce waiting at Wayne Manor.

The final battle of the ''Knightfall'' saga takes place in the caverns surrounding the Batcave between Jean-Paul and Bruce Wayne: rather than beating Jean-Paul at hand-to-hand combat, Bruce escapes into a passage too narrow for Jean-Paul to go through in his armor, forcing him to remove most of it. Bruce then opens a hatch to the outside, which covered the very hole he fell into as a child, allowing sunlight to stab at the night lenses in Jean-Paul's helmet. After being momentarily blinded, Jean-Paul sees Bruce staring down at him in the original Batman costume and concedes defeat, saying "''You are Batman...and I am nothing.''" Bruce comforts Jean-Paul, who leaves Gotham to travel the world and find his purpose as had Bruce. Bruce decides not to take Jean-Paul to the police because it was his decision to make Jean-Paul the Batman.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

''KnightsEnd'' was collected into a trade paperback about a year later. Originally released as ''Batman: KnightsEnd'', recent editions retitled it as volume three of the ''Knightfall'' saga.

A side note of interest is that in ''KnightsEnd'', Jean-Paul Valley references defeating [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Jigsaw (Marvel Comics)|Jigsaw]] in the ''Batman/Punisher'' crossover. This is a very rare mention of a character from another company in a non-intercompany capacity, made possible by the insanity of Jean-Paul.

===Aftermath===
====Prodigal====
Bruce reaffirms his partnership with Tim, resolving the tension caused by Bruce's unwillingness to accept help during the Arkham prison break. Bruce passes the mantle of Batman to Nightwing so he can re-evaluate what it will take to restore his aura of invincibility. This begins the ''Prodigal'' storyline, a reference to Dick Grayson essentially being Bruce's prodigal son; Bruce had adopted Dick after his parents were murdered.

Because of the events of ''KnightSaga'' and ''Prodigal'', considerable time passes before [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]] restores his trust in the idea of a Batman working for good. Gordon can tell that he is not looking at the original Batman (based on Jean-Paul's costume and Dick's height, and the fact that Jean-Paul was more than ready to kill people), and he refuses to place blind trust in people. The ''Prodigal'' storyline was utilized as a way of tying up the numerous loose ends that ''Knightfall'' left, with [[Killer Croc]], [[Two-Face]], and many other released inmates being returned to prison. In doing so, Dick avenges his worst mistake from his days as Robin, one that caused a man to die and nearly killed Bruce. He also comes to appreciate the incredible physical and mental burden Bruce places on himself in donning the Batsuit. During the story, a firm bond arises between Dick and Tim as they share Wayne Manor together in Bruce's and Alfred's absence.

It's revealed in the later ''No Man's Land'' storyline that Bruce also used this time to set up contingency bases throughout Gotham.

====Troika====
When Bruce finally returns for good, he wears a sturdier (made of Kevlar), darker costume (quite similar to the costume of the Tim Burton ''Batman'' movies), and drives a new, state-of-the-art Batmobile. He again fights Colonel Vega (who teamed with Asp in ''Knightquest: The Search''), KG Beast, Dark Rider and their Troika group, in order to foil a plot to nuke Gotham City with a device the size and shape of a baseball. ''Troika'' comes from the Russian word for ''Triad''. The saga also shows how Batman makes changes to his life as Bruce Wayne, his relationships with his 'family', plans to live without Alfred, and copes with the decision of making Jean-Paul his replacement.

====''Nightwing: Alfred's Return''====

A One-Shot that features the return of Alfred after his resignation during ''KnightQuest: The Search''. It has Nightwing going to England in order to track Alfred down.

==Reading order and release dates==
Each story arc of the ''Knightfall'' saga ran across a number of Gotham City-related comics.  This created a fairly complex reading order, which is summarized below.

==Influence and legacy==
DC Comics published ''Knightfall'' around the same time as the "''[[The Death of Superman]]''" storyline. Knightfall started almost immediately after "''The Funeral For a Friend''" storyline in the ''Superman'' books. It can be seen that during the break out at Arkham Asylum, Batman was wearing a black arm band with the S-shield engraved on it as well as Robin whilst cutting Jean-Paul Valley's hair. The two stories involved [[DC Comics]]' most prominent characters in what some regarded as bold, daring stories and others as stunts designed to sell extra comics through [[sensationalism]] (although then-President [[Jenette Kahn]] denied this on the ''Superman: Doomsday'' feature.).  Similar stories followed for [[Green Lantern]], [[Wonder Woman]], [[Aquaman]], and [[Green Arrow]].

''Knightfall'' was, in terms of number of titles and issues it encompassed and the duration of the storyline, the most ambitious ''Batman'' story ever at the time it was published. Its success paved the way for other year-or-longer crossovers, such as "''[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]''".

[[IGN]] Comics ranked ''Batman: Knightfall, Part One: Broken Bat'' #24 on a list of the 25 greatest Batman graphic novels, saying: "What makes ''Knightfall, Part One'' so memorable is not the actually snapping of Batman's back. It's the quick fall into despair that proves most shocking. The ending is a foregone conclusion as Batman is worn down both physically and mentally. The Batman's spirit is broken before his vertebrae and that's a feat you'll never see accomplished anywhere else."<ref>[http://comics.ign.com/articles/624/624619p1.html The 25 Greatest Batman Graphic Novels], Hilary Goldstein, IGN, June 13, 2005</ref> 

In an interview with Dennis O'Neill, the writer stated that part of the reason ''Knightfall'' was written was due to the recent popularity of more 'ruthless' heroes such as the [[Terminator (character)|Terminator]] and [[James Bond (film series)|James Bond]] in films, as producers were starting to wonder if readers would prefer a Batman who was willing to kill his opponents; the subsequent response to Jean Paul Valley's Batman proved this not to be the case.

==Adaptations==
===Novels===
[[Dennis O'Neil]] adapted the entire storyline trilogy into a 1994 novel which was released by Warner Books in hardcover form and then in mass paperback later on (Hardcover ISBN 0-553-09673-7, Paperback ISBN 0-553-57260-1).  The novel does however leave out Nightwing who was present throughout the story in the comics. To distinguish between the two in their climatic battle, Jean Paul is referred to as Batman and Bruce by his first or last name. Wayne is only referred to as Batman when he defeats Valley.  A young adults book version was also released, this one written by [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]] and titled ''Batman: Knightfall and Beyond'' (ISBN 0-553-48187-8).

===Animation===
The character Bane was quickly added to the roster of villains in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''. He appeared in the episode "''Bane''" as a muscular thug rather than the mastermind as he was in the comics. He was hired by the mobster [[Rupert Thorne]] to eliminate Batman, and in turn by Thorne's mole to eliminate Thorne afterwards. Bane eventually fought Batman onboard a boat (where Robin had been kidnapped and tied up), but before he could break his back as he did in the comics, Batman thrusts a crumpled [[batarang]] into the controls that inject Bane with Venom. This action caused a rapid and uncontrollable feed into Bane's body before Batman pulls out the tube, stopping a fatal overdose of the drug.

In 1994, there was also a radio-play adaptation transmitted on [[BBC Radio 1]], later also released on audio-tape (ISBN 0-563-39520-6) and CD by BBC Audiobooks on March 5, 2007). It was adapted, produced and directed by [[Dirk Maggs]] - with music composed by [[Mark Russell (composer)|Mark Russell]] - who had  recently made ''[[Superman: Doomsday & Beyond]]'' on [[BBC Radio 5 (former)|BBC Radio 5]]. This show, however was not commissioned of its own, but rather to be three minute episodes on the [[Mark Goodier]] Show. This meant it was written with a sense of immediacy; having to make an instant effect and each three minute segment contains a major plot development or sound effect stunt and end on a cliffhanger. DC acknowledged the effort in an issue ''Shadow of The Bat'' by having villains jump past a sign that read Dirk Maggs Radio.
