'''Lieutenant Martin Soap''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[police officer]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He served as a [[supporting character]] and [[comic relief]] for the [[Punisher]] throughout the character's [[The Punisher (2000 series)|2000 miniseries]] and [[The Punisher (2001 series)|2001 ongoing series]].

==Fictional character biography==
Soap is abandoned as a child by his unwed teenage mother and raised in an [[orphanage]].<ref>''The Punisher'' (vol. 4) #1</ref> He joins the [[New York Police Department]] and despite being promoted to detective becomes known as a screw-up, describing himself as "the department's biggest loser." When the police department became pressured by [[Ma Gnucci]] to crack down on the Punisher, Soap is placed on the "Punisher Task Force", so the department could look like it was after the Punisher without really putting him in danger, as the Punisher is quite popular among most police officers.

Soap soon partners up with Lieutenant Molly Von Richthofen, who was assigned to a similar task force after Ma Gnucci. After the Punisher's assault on Ma Gnucci's compound, Soap and Von Richthofen corner the Punisher, but let him go in exchange for compromising pictures of the mayor and police commissioner. Using the pictures for [[blackmail]], Soap gets promoted to [[police commissioner]].<ref>''The Punisher'' (vol. 3) #12</ref>

At the beginning of ''The Punisher'' (vol. 5), Soap is demoted to lieutenant after being blackmailed with pictures of him with a prostitute. He is again assigned to the "Punisher Task Force". Distraught over the dead end his life has become, Soap attempts to commit suicide, but is approached by the Punisher.  Soap agrees to become a [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] for him, supplying the Punisher with information on his targets from the police database.

In ''The Punisher'' (vol. 5) #37, Soap leaves the force and becomes a [[porn star]].

==In other media==
Soap was voiced by [[Michael Gough (voice actor)|Michael Gough]] in [[The Punisher (2005 video game)|2005 ''Punisher'' video game]].
