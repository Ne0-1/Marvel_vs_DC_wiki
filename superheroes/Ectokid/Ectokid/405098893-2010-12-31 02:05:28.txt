'''''Ectokid''''' is a [[fantasy]] [[comic book]] series published by [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Razorline]] [[imprint]], created by filmmaker and [[horror fiction|horror]]/[[fantasy]] novelist [[Clive Barker]].

==Publication history==
''Ectokid'' ran nine issues (Sept. 1993 - May 1994) before being discontinued with the rest of the Razorline titles. The art for all nine issues was by [[penciller]] [[Steve Skroce]] and [[inker]] [[Bob Dvorak]]. The writing was split between [[James Robinson (comics)|James Robinson]] (issues #1-3) and [[Wachowski brothers|Larry Wachowski]] (issues #3-9), future co-creator of ''[[The Matrix]]'' film trilogy. Although uncredited, Wachowski's brother and filmmaking partner [[Wachowski brothers|Andy Wachowski]] co-wrote with him.<ref>Ojumu, Akin. [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,6903,958269,00.html "Brothers Grim"], ''[[The Observer]]'', May 18, 2003. [http://www.webcitation.org/5vNNyh97h WebCitation archive].</ref>

Though carrying the [[Comics Code]] seal, ''Ectokid'' and the other Razorline titles were often racked with horror and unrated comics, a factor that entered into the imprint's demise.{{Fact|date=April 2008}} A subsequent one-shot, ''Ektokid Unleashed'' (Oct. 1994), was written by [[Dan Abnett]] and [[Andy Lanning]], with artwork by penciler [[Hector Gomez]] and inker [[John Strangeland]]. It included a prose short story starring another Razorline character, [[Saint Sinner (comics)|Saint Sinner]], written by [[Elaine Lee]].

==Fictional character biography==
''Ectokid'' is centered around 14-year-old Dextor Mungo, whose father was a ghost. Dex, as he is called, sees the world as it normally is through his right eye, but through his left he can see into the Ectosphere, a dimension similar to Earth but with a number of crucial differences. All the regular-Earth buildings are in the same places, but have a crusted and coral-covered appearance, and this world is populated by creatures and races out of myths, legends and nightmares.

As Barker described, "''Ectokid'', which is perhaps the second weirdest of the bunch, is a kind of dream story for the 15-year-old that's still alive to me â€” the tale of an adolescent who lives in two worlds and has access to a whole other sphere of reality".<ref>[http://www.clivebarker.info/ints93b.html "Interviews 1993 (Part Two)"], Clive Barker Revelations.
