'''''Ectokid''''' is a [[fantasy]] [[comic book]] series published by [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Razorline]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] that ran from 1993 to 1994. Created by filmmaker and [[horror fiction|horror]]/[[fantasy]] novelist [[Clive Barker]] as one of the imprint's four interconnected series, it starred teenaged Dexter Mungo, the child of a mortal and a ghost, who is able to see and interact with the dangerous, interdimensional Ectosphere.

==Publication history==
''Ectokid'' ran nine issues (Sept. 1993 - May 1994) before being discontinued with the rest of the Razorline titles. All art was by [[penciller]] [[Steve Skroce]] and [[inker]] [[Bob Dvorak]]. The writing was split between [[James Robinson (comics)|James Robinson]] (issues #1-3) and [[Wachowski brothers|Lana Wachowski]] (issues #3-9), future co-creator of ''[[The Matrix]]'' film trilogy.<ref name=gcd>{{gcdb series|id=4692|title=Ectokid}}</ref> Although uncredited, Wachowski's brother and filmmaking partner [[Wachowski brothers|Andy Wachowski]] co-wrote with her.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ojumu|first= Akin| url = http://observer.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,6903,958269,00.html | title= Brothers Grim | work=[[The Guardian]] | location = UK |date=May 18, 2003| archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vNNyh97h | archivedate= December 31, 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref>

The final Razorline release was the subsequent one-shot ''Ektokid Unleashed'' (Oct. 1994), written by [[Dan Abnett]] and [[Andy Lanning]], with artwork by penciler [[Hector Gomez (comics)|Hector Gomez]] and inker John Strangeland. It included a prose [[short story]] by [[Elaine Lee]] starring another Razorline character, [[Saint Sinner (comics)|Saint Sinner]].<ref>[http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/razor.htm#S1570 ''Ectokid Unleashed'' #1] at The Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators.

==Fictional character biography==
''Ectokid'' is  centered on 14-year-old Dexter Mungo, whose father was a ghost. Dex, as he is called, sees the world as it normally is through his right eye, but through his left he can see into the Ectosphere, a dimension similar to Earth but with a number of crucial differences. All the regular-Earth buildings are in the same places, but have a crusted and coral-covered appearance, and this world is populated by creatures and races out of myths, legends and nightmares.

As Barker described, "''Ectokid'', which is perhaps the second weirdest of the bunch, is a kind of dream story for the 15-year-old that's still alive to me â€” the tale of an adolescent who lives in two worlds and has access to a whole other sphere of reality".<ref>Barker, Clive, in {{cite news| title=Razorline| first=Tom |last=Russo| work=[[Marvel Age]]| issue= 126|date= July 1993}} Quote excerpted in {{cite web|url=http://www.clivebarker.info/ints93b.html | publisher=Clive Barker (official site) | title=Interviews, Part Two| archiveurl =http://www.webcitation.org/5qpSos8Nt | archivedate= June 28, 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref>
