'''''Ectokid''''' is a [[fantasy]] [[comic book]] series published by [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Razorline]] [[imprint]], created by filmmaker and [[horror fiction|horror]]/[[fantasy]] novelist [[Clive Barker]].

''Ectokid'' ran nine issues (Sept. 1993 - May 1994) before being discontinued with the rest of the Razorline titles. The art for all nine issues was by [[penciller]] [[Steve Skroce]] and [[inker]] [[Bob Dvorak]]. The writing was split between [[James Dale Robinson|James Robinson]] (issues #1-3) and [[Wachowski brothers|Larry Wachowski]] (issues #3-9), future co-creator of ''[[The Matrix]]'' film trilogy. Although uncredited, Wachowski's brother and filmmaking partner [[Wachowski brothers|Andy Wachowski]] co-wrote with him. [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,6903,958269,00.html].

Though carrying the [[Comics Code]] seal, ''Ectokid'' and the other Razorline titles were often racked with horror and unrated comics, a factor that entered into the imprint's demise. A subsequent one-shot, ''Ektokid Unleashed'' (Oct. 1994), was written by [[Dan Abnett]] and [[Andy Lanning]], with artwork by penciler [[Hector Gomez]] and inker [[John Strangeland]]. It included a prose short story starring another Razorline character, [[Saint Sinner (comics)|Saint Sinner]], written by [[Elaine Lee]].

==Setting==
As Barker described, [http://www.clivebarker.info/ints93b.html]:
<blockquote>
''Ectokid'', which is perhaps the second weirdest of the bunch, is a kind of dream story for the 15-year-old that's still alive to me â€” the tale of an adolescent who lives in two worlds and has access to a whole other sphere of reality.
</blockquote>

''Ectokid'' is centered around 14-year-old Dextor Mungo, whose father was a ghost. Dex, as he's called, sees the world as it normally is through his right eye, but through his left he can see into the Ectosphere, a dimension similar to Earth but with a number of crucial differences. All the regular-Earth buildings are in the same places, but have a crusted and coral-covered appearance, and this world is populated by creatures and races out of myths, legends and nightmares.
