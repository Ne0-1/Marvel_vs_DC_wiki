===Film===
* Aldrich Killian is the main antagonist of ''[[Iron Man 3]]'', where he is portrayed by [[Guy Pearce]]. Killian is the creator of the [[Extremis]] virus<ref name="Pearce">{{cite news |date=April 20, 2012 |first1=Marc |last1=Graser |first2=Justin |last2=Kroll |title=Guy Pearce bonds with 'Iron Man 3' |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118052904 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6APHN98XU |archivedate=September 3, 2012 |accessdate=April 20, 2012 |deadurl=no}}</ref> and the founder of [[Advanced Idea Mechanics]].<ref name="Pearce3">{{cite news |date=March 22, 2013 |title=Iron Man 3: Under the Armor with Guy Pearce |url=http://marvel.com/news/story/20330/iron_man_3_under_the_armor_with_guy_pearce |publisher=Marvel.com |accessdate=March 23, 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6FKyoT3FD |archivedate=March 23, 2013 |deadurl=no}}</ref> On why he took the role, Pearce said, "I feel a little more experimental in what I'll take on these days, but I still don't know that I would want to play the superhero myself, since I'm playing a different kind of character in this film... The main difference was that, when I did ''[[The Time Machine (2002 film)|The Time Machine]]'', I was pretty much in all of it, so it was a really grueling experience. ''[[Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus]]'' and ''Iron Man'' are really kind of cameo stuff, so the experience of shooting them... I mean, on some level, it's tricky because you feel like a bit of an outsider. You don’t really live the experience that you do when you're there all day every day with everybody. But at the same time, it can be more fun sometimes because you're just working in concentrated spurts." <ref name="Pearce2">{{cite news |date=August 30, 2012 |first=Kyle |last=Buchanan |title=Guy Pearce on Lawless, Prometheus, and Finely Calibrated Camp |url=http://www.vulture.com/2012/08/guy-pearce-prometheus-and-camp.html |publisher= ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' / Vulture.com | accessdate=September 3, 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6APR6KGUq |archivedate=September 3, 2012 |deadurl=no}}</ref> Pearce described his character as a man "who came into this world with a number of physical disabilities. He’s never been able to accept those limitations though and has spent most of his life trying to overcome them in any way he can. His tenacity and blind determination in fighting for a better life are seen by some as irritating, as he often comes across as obnoxious. He just won’t accept the cards he was dealt, and being as intelligent as he is, has real drive to change and become a different person."<ref name="Pearce3" /> Of the character Mandarin, Kevin Feige stated, "The Mandarin is [Iron Man's] most famous foe in the comics mainly because he’s been around the longest. If you look, there’s not necessarily a definitive Mandarin storyline in the comics. So it was really about having an idea." <ref name="Collider">{{cite news |date=November 26, 2012 |title=Producer Kevin Feige Talks 'Iron Man 3', How It Relates to 'The Avengers', The Mandarin, Iron Patriot, and More | url=http://collider.com/iron-man-3-avengers-mandarin-iron-patriot/213638/ | publisher=''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' via Collider | accessdate = November 27, 2012 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/6Cv8N9mCH | archivedate = December 14, 2012 | deadurl = no}}</ref> As the film's version of the Mandarin as signified by the dragon tattoos on Killian's chest, he uses Trevor Slattery as a public face for his actions. Killian's scheme is to eliminate President Ellis, convincing Vice President Rodriguez to follow him in exchange for Rodriguez's daughter getting Extremis to restore her missing right leg.<ref>[http://www.latinospost.com/articles/17153/20130421/iron-man-3-spoilers-mandarin-twist-unveiled-will-fans-upset.htm "'Iron Man 3' Spoilers: The Mandarin Twist Unveiled? Will Fans Be Upset?"]. Latinos Post, April 21, 2013</ref> Though he overpowers Stark, Killian ends up getting killed by Pepper after she is exposed to the Extremis.

* The ''[[Marvel One-Shot]]'' titled "All Hail the King" revealed that Killian was never the Mandarin. It turns out that the real Mandarin of the Ten Rings is still out there and is unhappy with impostors acting under the name.

===Video games===
* The ''[[Iron Man 3 (video game)|Iron Man 3]]'' video game shows Aldrich Killian's subconscious is downloaded by A.I.M. to become [[MODOK]] after his death in the film. After Iron Man defeated him in combat, he attempted to survive by uploading his consciousness into Stark Industries' network but Iron Man willingly sacrifices the network (and Stark Industries), destroying Killian for good.

* The ''Iron Man 3'' version of Aldrich Killian appears in ''[[Lego Marvel Super Heroes]]'', voiced by [[Robin Atkin Downes]]. He and his Extremis soldiers accompany Mandarin in his attack on Stark Tower. He and Mandarin are defeated by Iron Man and [[Captain America]].

* The "Iron Man 3" version of Aldrich Killian is set to appear in ''[[Lego Marvel's Avengers]], to be voiced by [[Greg Miller]]
