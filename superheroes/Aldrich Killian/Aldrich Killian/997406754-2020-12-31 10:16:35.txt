Dr. Aldrich Killian was a brilliant scientist working for the FuturePharm Corporation in [[Austin, Texas]] alongside Dr. [[Maya Hansen]]. Together they developed [[Extremis]], a [[Techno-Organic Virus]] that completely rewrites the body's genetic code, making entire organs more efficient and giving the body healing abilities in an attempt to create a new super soldier with super human strength, speed, endurance, reflexes and the ability to project electricity and breathe fire. He stole a sample and sold it to a terrorist group (based in a slaughterhouse in Bastrop, Texas) with Mallen as a willing test subject.<ref name="IMv4_1">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Warren Ellis]] | penciller = [[Adi Granov]] | inker = Adi Granov | story = Extremis (Part I of VI) | title = Iron Man | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | date = January 2005 | publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref> Days later at Futurepharm Corporation offices, Dr. Killian committed suicide at his computer; his suicide note informed Hansen that he had stolen the Extremis serum for an undisclosed purpose.<ref name="IMv4_6">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Warren Ellis]] | penciller = [[Adi Granov]] | inker = Adi Granov | story = Extremis (Part VI of VI) | title = Iron Man | volume = 4 | issue = 6 | date = April 2006 | publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref>
