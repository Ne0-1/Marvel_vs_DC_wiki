The main difference was that, when I did ''[[The Time Machine (2002 film)|The Time Machine]]'', I was pretty much in all of it, so it was a really grueling experience. ''[[Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus]]'' and ''Iron Man'' are really kind of cameo stuff, so the experience of shooting them... I mean, on some level, it's tricky because you feel like a bit of an outsider. You don’t really live the experience that you do when you're there all day every day with everybody. But at the same time, it can be more fun sometimes because you're just working in concentrated spurts."<ref name="Pearce2">{{cite news|date=August 30, 2012 |first=Kyle |last=Buchanan |title=Guy Pearce on Lawless, Prometheus, and Finely Calibrated Camp |url=http://www.vulture.com/2012/08/guy-pearce-prometheus-and-camp.html |publisher=''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' / Vulture.com |accessdate=September 3, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6APR6KGUq?url=http://www.vulture.com/2012/08/guy-pearce-prometheus-and-camp.html |archivedate=September 3, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> Pearce described his character as a man "who came into this world with a number of physical disabilities. He’s never been able to accept those limitations though and has spent most of his life trying to overcome them in any way he can. His tenacity and blind determination in fighting for a better life are seen by some as irritating, as he often comes across as obnoxious. He just won’t accept the cards he was dealt, and being as intelligent as he is, has real drive to change and become a different person."<ref name="Pearce3" /> Of the character Mandarin, Kevin Feige stated, "The Mandarin is [Iron Man's] most famous foe in the comics mainly because he’s been around the longest. If you look, there’s not necessarily a definitive Mandarin storyline in the comics. So it was really about having an idea."<ref name="Collider">{{cite news|date=November 26, 2012 |title=Producer Kevin Feige Talks 'Iron Man 3', How It Relates to 'The Avengers', The Mandarin, Iron Patriot, and More |url=http://collider.com/iron-man-3-avengers-mandarin-iron-patriot/213638/ |publisher=''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' via Collider |accessdate=November 27, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Cv8N9mCH?url=http://collider.com/iron-man-3-avengers-mandarin-iron-patriot/213638/ |archivedate=December 15, 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref> As the film's version of the '''[[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]]''' as signified by the dragon tattoos on Killian's chest, he uses [[Trevor Slattery]] as a public face for his actions. Killian's scheme is to eliminate President Ellis, convincing Vice President Rodriguez to follow him in exchange for Rodriguez's disabled daughter getting Extremis to restore a missing right leg.<ref>[http://www.latinospost.com/articles/17153/20130421/iron-man-3-spoilers-mandarin-twist-unveiled-will-fans-upset.htm "'Iron Man 3' Spoilers: The Mandarin Twist Unveiled?
