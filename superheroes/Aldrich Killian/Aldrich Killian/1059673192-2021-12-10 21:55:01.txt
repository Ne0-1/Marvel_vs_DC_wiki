Dr. Aldrich Killian was a brilliant scientist working for the FuturePharm Corporation in [[Austin, Texas]] alongside Dr. [[Maya Hansen]]. Together they developed [[Extremis]], a [[Techno-Organic Virus]] that completely rewrites the body's genetic code, making entire organs more efficient and giving the body healing abilities in an attempt to create a new super soldier with super human strength, speed, endurance, reflexes and the ability to project electricity and breathe fire. He stole a sample and sold it to a terrorist group (based in a slaughterhouse in Bastrop, Texas) with Mallen as a willing test subject.<ref name="IMv4_1">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Warren Ellis]] | penciller = [[Adi Granov]] | inker = Adi Granov | story = Extremis (Part I of VI) | title = Iron Man | volume = 4 | issue = #1 | date = Jan. 2005 | publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref> Days later at Futurepharm Corporation offices, Dr. Killian committed suicide at his computer; his suicide note informed Hansen that he had stolen the Extremis serum for an undisclosed purpose.<ref name="IMv4_6">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Warren Ellis]] | penciller = [[Adi Granov]] | inker = Adi Granov | story = Extremis (Part VI of VI) | title = Iron Man | volume = 4 | issue = #6 | date = April 2006 | publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref>

Over the years, through A.I.M. and with the aid of co-conspirator Maya Hansen's designs, Killian created a team to further research and develop the Extremis formula, which imparts varying levels of strength and resiliency to human subjects. While these tests backfired and resulted in death among the test subjects, they allowed Killian to eventually recruit [[Coldblood|Eric Savin]] and [[Ellen Brandt]] to his cause. At some point, he also funded the [[Ten Rings (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Ten Rings]] organization by masquerading as their leader, the Mandarin, without the real Mandarin's knowledge. To maintain this illusion, Killian used British actor [[Trevor Slattery]] to impersonate the "Mandarin". Additionally, the organization would cover up Killian's Extremis experiments as terrorist attacks in case the former subjects degenerated and exploded. After kidnapping President [[Matthew Ellis]] with the intention of executing him on live television, Killian and his Extremis-soldiers are defeated by Stark, [[James Rhodes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|James Rhodes]], and [[Pepper Potts (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Pepper Potts]].
