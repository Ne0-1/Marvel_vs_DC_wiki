'''Groot''' (also known as the '''Monarch of Planet X''') is a [[fictional character]], an extraterrestrial in the {{Marvel Universe}} and member of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (modern)|Guardians of the Galaxy]].

==Publication history==
Groot first appeared in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' Vol.1 #13 (November 1960), and was created by [[Stan Lee]], [[Jack Kirby]], and [[Dick Ayers]]. 

==Fictional character biography==
''Groot'' is an [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]] plant monster who initially came to [[Earth]] seeking humans to capture and study.  However he was seemingly destroyed by termites by [[Leslie Evans]].  

[[Xemnu]] made a duplicate of Groot and was used to fight the [[Incredible Hulk]], however the Hulk destroyed him.<ref>''Incredible Hulk Annual'' #5</ref>

Through unknown means, he was later captured by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and assigned to their Paranormal Containment Unit, nicknamed the [[Nick Fury's Howling Commandos|Howling Commandos]].

Groot played a part in [[Annihilation: Conquest]], at which time he may the be last remaining member of his race. Groot seemingly died buying his team some time to escape the battle. However, he survived as a sprig offshoot. In time, he regenerated his body from the twig, growing back to full size, and participated in an assault on the Babel Spire. When the original  plan of laying explosives in the Spire failed, Groot was forced to sprout inside the Spire, growing to colossal size and filling a large portion of the building. Mantis was able to remix his sap in a way as to make it extremely flammable, and again Groot sacrificed his life for his friends, igniting himself, the resulting fire destroying the Babel Spire. A cutting of Groot was kept by Rocket Raccoon, though, and he was able to regrow. He then joined the new [[Guardians of the Galaxy (Modern)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] (or as Groot would have it "Groot and Branches"), and began regrowing under the care of Mantis.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. two #1</ref><ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=156983 Greeting the Guardians: Rocket Raccoon, Groot], [[Newsarama]], May 14, 2008</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Groot can absorb wood to feed, to rebuild himself (which also requires water) and to enhance his strength. He can also control trees, using them to attack others. Groot also appears to be resistant to fire. He is able to Sprout, massively increasing his mass but also severely inhibiting his movement. 

Groot has also been seemingly killed on three occasions, each time regrowing from a sprig.

It was revealed by [[Black Bolt]]'s mad brother [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus]] that whenever Groot is saying his trademark "I am Groot!" he has actually been saying any number of things, ranging from the mundane to theories of Quasi-Dimensional super-positional engineering. Due to the hardened formation of his larynx, people who cannot understand subtle nuances just cannot understand him.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. two #17</ref>
