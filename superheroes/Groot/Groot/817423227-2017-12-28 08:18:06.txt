'''Groot/Grover''' ({{IPAc-en|g|r|uː|t}}) is a [[fictional superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by [[Stan Lee]], [[Jack Kirby]], [[Larry Lieber]], and [[Dick Ayers]], the character first appeared in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' #13 (November 1960). An [[extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]], sentient [[tree]]-like creature, the original Groot first appeared as an [[alien invasion|invader]] that intended to capture humans for experimentation.

The character was reintroduced as a heroic, noble being in 2006, and appeared in the [[fictional crossover|crossover]] comic book storyline "[[Annihilation: Conquest]]". Groot went on to star in its [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series, ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'', joining the team of the same name. Groot has been featured in a variety of associated Marvel merchandise, including [[animation|animated]] [[television series]], [[toy]]s, and [[trading card]]s. [[Vin Diesel]] voices Groot in the 2014 film ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' and its 2017 sequel, ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]'', and Krystian Godlewski plays the character via [[performance capture]] in the first film. Since his film premiere and animated series debut, Groot has become a [[pop culture]] icon, with his repeated line "I am Groot" becoming an internet meme.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.dailydot.com/geek/i-am-groot-and-other-limited-vocabulary-characters/|title= Like 'Hodor,' 'I Am Groot' is already becoming a loved Internet meme|first= Mike|last= Fenn|date= August 5, 2014|work= [[The Daily Dot]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150819055317/http://www.dailydot.com/geek/i-am-groot-and-other-limited-vocabulary-characters/|archivedate= August 19, 2015|deadurl= no}}</ref>

Groot is one of the stars of ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 3, a part of the [[Marvel NOW!]] relaunch.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=41610|title= NYCC: Bendis, McNiven & Wacker Relaunch the ''Guardians of the Galaxy''|last= Richards|first= Dave|date= October 14, 2012 |publisher= [[Comic Book Resources]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131206000000/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=41610|archivedate= December 6, 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate =October 15, 2012}}</ref>

In March 2015, it was announced that Groot would be getting his very first solo series by writer Jeff Loveness and artist [[Brian Kesinger]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/comics-newcomers-declare-i-am-groot-with-new-marvel-spinoff-series|title= Comics Newcomers Declare 'I Am Groot' With New Marvel Spinoff Series|first= Kiel|last= Phegley|date= March 7, 2015|publisher= Comic Book Resources|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150905150237/http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/comics-newcomers-declare-i-am-groot-with-new-marvel-spinoff-series|archivedate= September 5, 2015|deadurl= no}}</ref>

The Groot that debuted in ''Tales to Astonish'' and the one that was introduced in ''Annihilation: Conquest'' were [[Retroactive continuity|retroactively]] established as being separate members of the same species in the sixth and final issue of the ''Groot'' ongoing series that launched in June 2015.<ref name = "Groot6">{{Cite comic|writer= Loveness, Jeff|penciller= Kesinger, Brian|inker= Kesinger, Brian|title = Groot|issue= 6|date= January 2016}} </ref>

==Origins==
Groot is a ''Flora colossus'' from Planet X, the capital of the branch worlds. The ''Flora colossi'' are tree-like beings whose language is almost impossible to understand due to the stiffness of their [[larynges]], causing their speech to sound like they are repeating the phrase "I am Groot". Other beings try to be friendly but become angry with the ''Flora colossi'' for not being able to speak. (Groot was shown to be capable of speaking not just understandably but eloquently throughout ''Annihilation: Conquest''.) The ''Flora colossi'' are ruled over by the "Arbor Masters" and teach the children of the species with "Photonic Knowledge", which is the collected knowledge of the Arbor Masters of the generations and is absorbed through [[photosynthesis]]; this is a highly advanced education method, making the ''Flora colossi'' geniuses. Planet X's [[biome]] is managed by "Maintenance Mammals" which are small squirrel-like beings.{{issue|date=August 2014}}

The ''Flora colossus'' sapling that would come to be known as "Groot" came from an "Ennobled Sap-line" and gifted with a tremendous grasp of quasi-dimensional super-positional engineering. Groot did not get along with fellow saplings but instead preferred the company of the "Maintenance Mammals", which the other saplings treated with prejudice. Groot was exiled by the "Arbor Masters" in GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY #14<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.marvel.com/comics/75383/groot-hardwood-history/|title=I Am Groot: Hardwood History|website=News - Marvel.com|accessdate=24 November 2017}}</ref> after killing another sapling to defend a maintenance mammal it was brutalizing.

An alternate origin was presented in the ''Groot'' ongoing series. In the story, it is revealed that the other ''Flora colossi'' had been abducting organisms from other planets, including a young human girl named Hannah. After seeing Hannah, Groot realized what his people were doing was wrong and managed to save the child and send her back to Earth. However, for his disobedience, Groot was exiled from Planet X and forced to wander the universe until he met [[Rocket Raccoon]] many decades later where this version of Groot later became a member of the Guardians of the Galaxy.<ref name = "Groot6"/>

Yet another alternate origin was presented in "Guardians of Infinity", written by [[Edgardo Miranda-Rodriguez|Edgardo Miranda Rodriguez]], wherein a woman makes the claim that Groot is a [[ceiba]] tree from Ponce, Puerto Rico. According to Puerto Rican folklore, a ceiba tree is believed to possess the spirits of the indigenous Taino population that formerly thrived on the Caribbean island. By her logic, the woman considers Groot to be Puerto Rican.<ref>{{Cite web|title= Guardians of the Galaxy's Groot is Puerto Rican|url= http://www.theflama.com/marvel-comics-groot-is-puerto-rican-1607884485.html|website= ''The Flama''|access-date= February 18, 2016|first= Ronel|last= Puello|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161007061417/http://www.theflama.com/marvel-comics-groot-is-puerto-rican-1607884485.html|archivedate= October 7, 2016|deadurl= no}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
===Original Groot===
Groot is an [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]] tree monster who initially came to [[Earth]] seeking humans to capture and study. Groot was seemingly destroyed by termites used by Leslie Evans.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]]|penciller= [[Jack Kirby|Kirby, Jack]]|inker= [[Dick Ayers|Ayers, Dick]]|story= I Challenged...

Groot was later revealed to have survived, but was a captive of the [[Collector (comics)|Collector]] and held in his zoo in Canada until Groot and the other captive creatures were freed by the [[Mole Man]]. Groot and the other creatures rampaged in New York City until they were stopped by a band of superheroes, and were then dumped through a portal to the [[Negative Zone]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Steve Niles|Niles, Steve]]|penciller= [[Duncan Fegredo|Fegredo, Duncan]]|inker= Fegredo, Duncan|story= Good Monsters|title= Marvel Monsters: Monsters on the Prowl|issue= 1|date= December 2005}}</ref>

Groot was later tracked down and captured by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s Paranormal Containment Unit, nicknamed the [[Nick Fury's Howling Commandos|Howling Commandos]] when his tree scent was detected by [[Sasquatch (comics)#Howling Commandos|Sasquatch]] and [[List of Marvel Comics characters: A#Abominable Snowman|Abominable Snowman]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Keith Giffen|Giffen, Keith]]|penciller= Francisco, Eduardo|inker= Campanella, Robert|story= Creature Feature|title= [[Nick Fury's Howling Commandos]]|issue= 2|date= January 2006}}</ref> While Groot was being held captive, [[Gorilla-Man#Ken Hale|Gorilla-Man]] talked to Groot about joining the Howling Commandos.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Giffen, Keith|penciller= Aucoin, Derec|inker= Aucoin, Derec|story= Assault on Area 13|title= Nick Fury's Howling Commandos|issue= 4|date= March 2006}}</ref> When [[Merlin (Marvel Comics)|Merlin]] and his forces attacked the base, the Howling Commandos let Groot and their other captives free and they stampeded on Merlin's army; Groot was the only one to turn back and offered to join the Howling Commandos.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Giffen, Keith|penciller= Donovan, Derec|inker= Donovan, Derec|story= Destroy All Monsters!|title= Nick Fury's Howling Commandos|issue= 5|date= April 2006}}</ref> Groot aided the Howling Commandos as they assaulted Merlin's forces.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Giffen, Keith|penciller= [[Mike Norton|Norton, Mike]]|inker= Aucoin, Derec; Lee, Norman|story= I thought you said this was a precision science|title= Nick Fury's Howling Commandos|issue= 6|date= May 2006}}</ref>

===Guardians of the Galaxy's Groot===
A different Groot played a part in ''[[Annihilation: Conquest]]'', at which time it was shown Groot may be the last remaining member of the Flora Colossi, and was under arrest by the [[Kree]] for an unknown reason. Groot earned freedom by joining [[Star-Lord]]'s strike force, where Groot and [[Rocket Raccoon]] formed a bond, Rocket being one of the few beings with the ability to understand Groot's language.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Giffen, Keith|penciller= [[Timothy Green II|Green II, Timothy]]|inker= Olazaba, Victor|story= Starlord Part 1|title= [[Annihilation: Conquest]] - [[Star-Lord|Starlord]]|issue= 1|date= September 2007}}</ref> Star-Lord's team fought their way through the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]], but after the death of [[Deathcry]] the team decided to escape through a drainage pipe that Groot could not fit into.

In time, Groot's body regenerated from the twig, growing back to full size.

Groot and the team returned to Hala to prepare another assault against the Phalanx, but their agent [[Blastaar]] was captured by the Phalanx and taken to their Babel Spire as he tried to carry Groot's pollen spores.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Dan Abnett|Abnett, Dan]]; [[Andy Lanning|Lanning, Andy]]|penciller= [[Tom Raney|Raney, Tom]]|inker= Hanna, Scott|story= Together Alone|title= Annihilation: Conquest|issue= 2|date= February 2008}}</ref> Groot and Rocket Raccoon continued their mission by sneaking into the sub-basement of the Babel Spire.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Abnett, Dan; Lanning, Andy|penciller= Raney, Tom|inker= Hanna, Scott|story= Together Alone|title= Annihilation: Conquest|issue= 3|date= March 2008}}</ref> When Star-Lord was captured by [[Ultron]], the original  plan of laying explosives in the Spire failed, so Rocket Raccoon and Groot needed to come up with a new plan.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Abnett, Dan; Lanning, Andy|penciller= Raney, Tom|inker= Hanna, Scott|story= Hopeless|title= Annihilation: Conquest|issue= 4|date= April 2008}}</ref> Groot decided to sprout inside the Spire, growing to colossal size and filling a large portion of the building.

Mantis was able to remix Groot's sap in a way as to make it extremely flammable, and again Groot died for the team, this time by purposefully igniting so the resulting fire would destroy the Babel Spire.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Abnett, Dan; Lanning, Andy|penciller= Raney, Tom|inker= Hanna, Scott|story= In the Flesh|title= Annihilation: Conquest|issue= 5|date= May 2008}}</ref> A cutting of Groot was kept by Rocket Raccoon, though, and Groot was again able to regrow.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Abnett, Dan; Lanning, Andy|penciller= Raney, Tom; Alves; Wellinton|inker= Hanna, Scott|story= Last Stand|title= Annihilation: Conquest|issue= 6|date= June 2008}}</ref> Groot then joined the new [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] (or, as Groot would have it, "Groot and Branches"), and began regrowing under the care of Mantis.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Abnett, Dan; Lanning, Andy|penciller= [[Paul Pelletier|Pelletier, Paul]]|inker= Magyar, Rick|story= Somebody's Got to Do It|title= [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]|volume= 2|issue= 1|date= July 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Vaneta |last=Rogers |url= http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=156983 |title= Greeting the Guardians: Rocket Raccoon, Groot|publisher= [[Newsarama]]|date=May 14, 2008|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090221174749/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=156983|archivedate= February 21, 2009|deadurl= yes}}</ref>

During the 2015 ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, Groot is with the Guardians of the Galaxy when they take part in the incursion between Earth-616 and Earth-1610.

==Powers and abilities==
Groot can absorb wood as food, and has the ability to [[Regeneration_(biology)|regenerate]]. Groot can control trees and plants, using them to attack others, and appears to be resistant to fire. Groot is able to sprout dramatically increasing mass which then severely inhibits movement.{{issue|date=September 2014}}

Groot has been seemingly killed on multiple occasions, each time regrowing from a sprig.{{issue|date=September 2014}}

=="I am Groot"==
[[Black Bolt]]'s brother [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus the Mad]] asserted that whenever Groot is saying the trademark "I am Groot!" he has actually been saying a number of things, and his varying inflections of the sentence are the equivalent of words and sentences. People who have interacted with Groot are gradually able to decipher the meaning of the inflections and can carry on full conversations with Groot as time goes on. The mature form of Groot's species is robust and heavyweight, which causes the organs of acoustic generation to become stiff and inflexible. It is this hardened nature of Groot's larynx that causes people, who are oblivious to the subtle nuances of Flora Colossi speech, to misinterpret Groot as merely repeating his name. It could not be determined whether Maximus's claim was true or merely another manifestation of his madness, though Groot did genuinely seem to be assisting Maximus with highly advanced engineering.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Abnett, Dan; Lanning, Andy|penciller= Walker, Brad|inker= Olazaba, Victor; Hanna, Scott|story= Adam Magus|title= Guardians of the Galaxy|volume= 2|issue= 17|date= October 2009}}</ref> Later, in ''All New X-Men'' #23, [[Jean Grey]] telepathically links with Groot, showing that Groot's thought processes are indeed complex, and the declaration of "I am Groot!" usually represents attempts at highly intelligent communication.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Bendis, Brian Michael|penciller= [[Stuart Immonen|Immonen, Stuart]]|inker= [[Wade Von Grawbadger|Von Grawbadger, Wade]]|story= The Trial of Jean Grey Part 3 of 5|title= [[All-New X-Men]]|issue= 23|date= April 2014}}</ref>

He is briefly captured by the Ravagers, along with Rocket and Yondu, while Quill, Drax and Gamora are visiting Quill's father [[Ego the Living Planet|Ego]], but when the Ravagers mockingly decide to make him their mascot, Groot is able to help Rocket and Yondu escape capture and go to assist the other Guardians in the confrontation with Ego. In the final battle, Groot is entrusted with planting a bomb on Ego's core as the only person small enough to fit through the cracks, although he was initially unable to remember which button on the bomb would start the timer and which would set it off immediately. In a mid-credits sequence, Groot has grown to a pre-teen level.
