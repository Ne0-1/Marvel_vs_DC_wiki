'''Groot''' (also known as the '''Monarch of Planet X''') is a [[fictional character]], an extraterrestrial who appears in the [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. 

Groot first appeared in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' Vol.1 #13.

==Fictional character biography==
''Groot'' is an [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]] plant monster who initially came to [[Earth]] seeking humans to capture and study.  However he was seemingly destroyed by termites by [[Leslie Evans]].  

Through unknown means, he was later captured by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and assigned to their Paranormal Containment Unit, nicknamed the [[Nick Fury's Howling Commandos|Howling Commandos]].

In ''Incredible Hulk Annual'' #5, [[Xemnu]] made a duplicate of Groot and was used to fight the [[Incredible Hulk]], however the Hulk destroyed him.

The real Groot currently plays a part in [[Annihilation Conquest]] at which time he may be last remaining member of his race. In issue 2 of StarLord, Groot seemingly died buying his team some time to escape the battle. However issue 3 reveals that he survived as a sprig offshoot. In time he should be able to regrow his body.

==Powers and Abilities==

Groot can absorb wood to feed, to rebuild himself (which also requires water) and to enhance his strength. He can also control trees, using them to attack others. Groot also appears to be resistant to fire.

Groot has also been seemingly killed on two occasions, both times regrowing from a sprig.
