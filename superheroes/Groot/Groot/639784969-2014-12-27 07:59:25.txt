===Origins===
Groot is a ''Flora Colossus'' from Planet X, the capital of the branch worlds. The ''Flora Colossi'' are [[Ent|tree-like beings]] whose language is almost impossible to understand due to the stiffness of their [[larynx]]es, causing their speech to sound like they are repeating the phrase "I am Groot". Other beings try to be friendly but become angry with the ''Flora Colossi'' for not being able to speak. Groot was shown to be capable of speaking not just understandably but eloquently throughout ''Annihilation: Conquest''. The ''Flora Colossi'' are ruled over by the "Arbor Masters" and teach the children of the species with "Photonic Knowledge", which is the collected knowledge of the Arbor Masters of the generations and is absorbed through [[photosynthesis]]; this is a highly advanced education method, making the ''Flora Colossi'' geniuses. Planet X's [[biome]] is managed by "Maintenance Mammals" which are small squirrel-like beings.{{issue|date=August 2014}}

The ''Flora Colossus'' sapling that would come to be known as "Groot" came from an "Enobled Sap-line" and gifted with a tremendous grasp of quasi-dimensional super-positional engineering. Groot did not get along with fellow saplings but instead preferred the company of the "Maintenance Mammals", which the other saplings treated with prejudice. Groot was exiled by the "Arbor Masters".{{issue|date=August 2014}} after killing another sapling to defend a maintenance mammal it was brutalizing.

===Annihilation and Guardians of the Galaxy===
Groot played a part in ''[[Annihilation: Conquest]]'', at which time it was shown Groot may be the last remaining member of the Flora Colossi, and was under arrest by the [[Kree]] for an unknown reason.  Groot earned freedom by joining [[Star-Lord]]'s strike force where Groot and [[Rocket Raccoon]] formed a bond. Rocket has the ability to understand Groot's language.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Giffen, Keith|penciller= [[Timothy Green II|Green II, Timothy]]|inker= Olazaba, Victor|story= Starlord Part 1|title= [[Annihilation: Conquest]] - [[Starlord]]|issue= 1|date= September 2007}}</ref> Starlord's team fought their way through the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]], but after the death of [[Deathcry]] the team decided to escape through a drainage pipe that Groot could not fit into.

In time, Groot's body regenerated from the twig, growing back to full size. Groot and the others intended to carry on as part of Starlord's team.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Giffen, Keith|penciller= Green II, Timothy|inker= Olazaba, Victor|story= Starlord Part 4|title= Annihilation: Conquest - Starlord|issue= 4|date= December 2007}}</ref> Groot and the team returned to Hala to prepare another assault against the Phalanx, but their agent [[Blastaar]] was captured by the Phalanx and taken to their Babel Spire as he tried to carry Groot's pollen spores.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Dan Abnett|Abnett, Dan]]; [[Andy Lanning|Lanning, Andy]]|penciller= [[Tom Raney|Raney, Tom]]|inker= Hanna, Scott|story= Together Alone|title= Annihilation: Conquest|issue= 2|date= February 2008}}</ref> Groot and Rocket Racoon continued their mission by sneaking into the sub-basement of the Babel Spire.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Abnett, Dan; Lanning, Andy|penciller= Raney, Tom|inker= Hanna, Scott|story= Together Alone|title= Annihilation: Conquest|issue= 3|date= March 2008}}</ref> When Starlord was captured by [[Ultron]], the original  plan of laying explosives in the Spire failed, so Rocket Raccoon and Groot needed to come up with a new plan.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Abnett, Dan; Lanning, Andy|penciller= Raney, Tom|inker= Hanna, Scott|story= Hopeless|title= Annihilation: Conquest|issue= 4|date= April 2008}}</ref> Groot decided to sprout inside the Spire, growing to colossal size and filling a large portion of the building.

When the Guardians reformed, Groot joined with Star-Lord, Rocket Raccoon, [[Drax the Destroyer]] and [[Gamora]], whom Groot counted as friends.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Brian Michael Bendis|Bendis, Brian Michael]]|penciller= [[Steve McNiven|McNiven, Steve]]|inker= Dell, John|story= What exactly do you think you're doing, Mister Quill?"|title= Guardians of the Galaxy|volume= 3|issue= 1|date= May 2013}}</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Groot can absorb wood as food, and has the ability to regenerate. Groot can control trees, he can form plants, using them to attack others, and appears to be resistant to fire. Groot is able to sprout, dramatically increasing mass but also severely inhibiting movement.{{issue|date=September 2014}}

Groot has been seemingly killed on multiple occasions, each time regrowing from a sprig.{{issue|date=September 2014}}

[[Maximus (comics)|Maximus the Mad]], [[Black Bolt]]'s brother, asserted that whenever Groot is saying the trademark "I am Groot!" he has actually been saying any number of things, and his varying inflections of the sentence are the equivalent of words and sentences. People who have interacted with Groot are gradually able to decipher the meaning of the inflections and can carry on full conversations with Groot as time goes on. The mature form of Groot's species is robust and heavyweight, which causes the organs of acoustic generation to become stiff and inflexible. It is this hardened nature of Groot's larynx that causes people, who are oblivious to the subtle nuances of Flora Colossi speech, to misinterpret Groot as merely repeating his name.  It could not be determined whether Maximus' claim was true or merely another manifestation of his madness, though Groot did genuinely seem to be assisting Maximus with highly advanced engineering.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Abnett, Dan; Lanning, Andy|penciller= Walker, Brad|inker= Olazaba, Victor; Hanna, Scott|story= Adam Magus|title= Guardians of the Galaxy|volume= 2|issue= 17|date= October 2009}}</ref> Later, in ''All New X-Men'' #23, [[Jean Grey]] telepathically links with Groot, showing that Groot's thought processes are indeed complex, and the declaration of "I am Groot!" usually represents attempts at highly intelligent communication.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Bendis, Brian Michael|penciller= [[Stuart Immonen|Immonen, Stuart]]|inker= [[Wade Von Grawbadger|Von Grawbadger, Wade]]|story= The Trial of Jean Grey Part 3 of 5|title= [[All-New X-Men]]|issue= 23|date= April 2014}}</ref>

He agrees with [[Star-Lord|Peter Quill]]'s plan to stand up to Ronan, and later seemingly sacrifices himself to save the rest of the team by enveloping them in a wooden ball grown from himself as Ronan's ship crashes. At the film's conclusion, Rocket has recovered a twig from Groot, which is shown to be re-growing into a miniature Groot. When sacrificing himself, he actually speaks another phrase, "We are Groot", which implies a bond formed between the heroes. Early in the film, Rocket explains that Groot hasn't really grasped speech, and his vocabulary only includes the phrase "I am Groot", thus changing the reason for the repeated line.  The film also shows, however, that Groot ''is'' articulating complex thoughts, it is simply that every phrase in his native language is composed of the phrase "I am Groot" - with the meaning apparently changing depending on the inflections he uses.  Rocket himself can actually understand what Groot is saying:  for example, when Quill says he has only "12%" of a plan, Groot remarks, "I am Groot", to which Rocket responds "So what 'it's better than 11%', what the hell does that have to do with anything?"
