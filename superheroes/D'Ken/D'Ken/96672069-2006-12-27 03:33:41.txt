'''D'Ken Neramani''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He is best known for being the evil brother to [[Lilandra|Lilandra Neramani]] and the villain [[Deathbird]] , two important characters in the X-Men franchise. He first appeared in [[X-Men]] v1 #97 (''February 1976'')

==History==
D'Ken was the first known ruler of the outerspace "[[Shi'ar]] Empire". He was responsible for the kidnapping of [[Corsair (comics)|Corsair]] and Katherine Anne Summers, the parents to X-Men members [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], [[Havok]] and as later revealed, Vulcan. When he had first kidnapped Corsair and Katherine, D'Ken disposed of Corsair and tried to rape Katherine. As Corsair escaped from his holding pen, D'Ken made the poor man pay by witnessing how he murdered his wife and unborn third child. Little did D'Ken know that Corsair had two surviving sons back on Earth, but even Corsair himself believed his sons to be all dead at the time.

As Corsair was brought into slavery, D'Ken had the child he just killed patched-up by his advanced machinery so he could make a slave out of the boy. Eventually, as Vulcan grew older, he escaped from his master's clutches and made it back to his homeplanet Earth, where he was welcomed by [[Professor X]] and [[Moira MacTaggart]]. D'Ken didn't care about [[Vulcan (comics)|Vulcan]] anymore, and sought out to gain more power in the [[M'Kraan Crystal]]. He didn't care that he had intervention of his family, and eventually located the Crystal, but its immense power rendered the villain comatose and he, presumably, still is that way until today. With D'Ken out of the picture, his younger sister Lilandra became the new heir to the Shi'ar throne.

D'Ken is also believed to have some connection to the mysterious [[Adam X the X-Treme|Adam X]] , a human-Shi'ar hybrid whom, according to Davan Shakari, was fathered by D'Ken, which led fans to believe he was the so-called Third Summers Brother.

With Vulcan now on the loose and aware of his horrible past, the former X-Man is heading back into outer space and can only think about two things: his father Corsair and revenge on D'Ken. February 2007 solicitations from Marvel have confirmed D'Ken will return during The Rise and Fall of the Shi'Ar Empire storyline in Uncanny X-Men.

D'Ken was seen in the third season of the [[X-Men: The Animated Series|X-Men (1992 Animated Series)]], in the episode [[Phoenix Saga (X-Men: Animated Series)|Phoenix Saga]] five parter, where his history was very much alike as it was in the comics. He was also responsible for the death of Cyclops' parents abduction and him becoming an orphan on Earth. D'Ken gained control over the M'Kraan Crystal though, which gave him powers. But, those powers drove him completely insane. When he was fighting his sister Lilandra, the X-Men and the Imperial Guard, D'Ken was eventually killed by the M'Kraan itself which didn't like the idea of its powers being abused.
