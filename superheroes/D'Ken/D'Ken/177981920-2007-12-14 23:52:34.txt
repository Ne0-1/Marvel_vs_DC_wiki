'''D'Ken Neramani''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He is best known for being the evil brother to both [[Lilandra]] and Cal'syee (the villain [[Deathbird]]), two important characters in the X-Men franchise. He first appeared in [[X-Men]] v1 #97 (''February 1976'')

==Fictional character biography==
'''D'Ken''' was the first known ruler of the outerspace '''[[Shi'ar Empire]]'''. He was responsible for the kidnapping of [[Corsair (comics)|Corsair]] and Katherine Anne Summers, the parents to X-Men members [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], [[Havok (X-Men)|Havok]], and [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]]. When he had first kidnapped Corsair and Katherine, D'Ken disposed of Corsair and tried to rape Katherine. As Corsair made an unsuccessful attempt to escape from his holding pen, D'Ken punished him by making Corsair witness the murder his wife and the ripping of the unborn third child (Vulcan) from the dead mother's womb. Little did D'Ken know that Corsair had two surviving sons back on Earth (note that even Corsair himself believed his sons to be all dead at the time). As Corsair was made a slave, D'Ken kept Vulcan alive with the Shi'ar technology in order to make a slave out of the boy. Eventually, as Vulcan grew older, he escaped from his master's clutches and made it back to his home planet Earth, where he was welcomed by [[Professor X]] and [[Moira MacTaggert]]. 

D'Ken didn't care about [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]], however, and sought out to gain more power in the [[M'Kraan Crystal]]. Regardless of his family's concerns, he eventually located the Crystal, placed on an abandoned planet, known only as The World (the Crystal was considered sacred by the [[Shi'ar]], a symbol of their faith). D'Ken wanted to use its legendary power for his own ends, and so D'Ken's sister [[Lilandra Neramani]] allied herself with the [[X-Men]] to stop her brother's mad quest, knowing that the Crystal was nicknamed '''"The End of All That Is"''' for a reason.  The Phoenix Force, still weakened and unexperienced in using the new host body of [[Jean Grey]], flew to the crystal to try and stop D'Ken, but was sucked into it, with everyone else. Inside the crystal, they found a large endless city, at the center of which was the heart of the Crystal - a sphere which contained a Neutron Galaxy. The X-Men, along with D'Ken, were rendered immobile by a ray coming out of the orb, which caused everyone to live out their greatest nightmares. Only Phoenix was unaffected. Using her empathic link she had with the crystal, Phoenix discovered an energy field in the form of a latticework, which acted as a living shield - for the Neutron Galaxy was deteriorating and due to its intense gravity, would cause all of creation to be sucked into it. Phoenix used her powers to try and repair the latticework but found she wasnâ€™t strong enough, so she reached out telepathically to her fellow X-Men for aid, and with their combined power Phoenix was able to repair the Crystal and thus save the universe from ultimate destruction. But the crystal's immense power rendered the D'Ken comatose and he remained in a coma for a very long time. With D'Ken out of the picture, his younger sister Lilandra became the queen of the Shi'ar.

=== Rise and Fall of the Shiar Empire ===
Recently, however, [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]], reawakened after barely surviving the failed rescue of the original X-Men from [[Krakoa]] and aware of his horrible past, swore revenge on D'Ken and headed back into outer space (also in search of his father Corsair). When told of D'Ken's coma, Vulcan just swore revenge on the entire Shi'ar empire and continued his journey into space. While Vulcan was initially captured by the Emperial Guard, he was helped to escape and release [[Deathbird]] by those loyal to D'Ken. Vulcan planed to resume his goal of vengeance, but Deathbird managed to convince him to delay his plans for a while, succeeding partly in part because the two became romantically involved. When the two traveled to the planet where a comatose D'Ken was being protected and treated as part of Deathbird's plan to revive D'Ken, Vulcan had to be restrained from killing D'Ken. As a favor to Deathbird, who did not want to rule the empire (but did want to overthrow her sister), Vulcan restrained himself and was able to revive D'Ken. <ref>''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' # 483 (Part 9 of 12 of the Rise and Fall Arc)</ref>

D'Ken was grudingly grateful to Vulcan for reviving him. After he observed that Deathbird and Vulcan were romantically involved, D'Ken thought to make everything right, so to speak, by invoking an ancient Shi'ar law allowing Vulcan to marry Deathbird and become part of the Shi'Ar royalty. Vulcan agreed, but, at the wedding, when given the chance, he killed D'Ken, saying that since he and Deathbird were now married, he could claim the Shi'ar throne as his own "By right of blood and combat! By right of succession!" <ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' # 485 (Part 11 of 12 of Rise and Fall Arc)</ref>

=== Adam-X connection ===
It should also be noted that D'Ken was at one point believed to have some connection to the mysterious [[Adam X the X-Treme|Adam X]], a human-Shi'ar hybrid whom, according to [[Davan Shakari]], was fathered by D'Ken and Katherine Summers, which led fans to believe he was the so-called [[Third Summers brother]]. With the revelation that Katherine was pregnant with Vulcan at the time D'Ken abducted her and the fact that he killed her soon after ripping Vulcan out of her womb, the Adam X scenereo remains conjecture.

D'Ken was seen in the third season of the [[X-Men: The Animated Series|X-Men (1992 Animated Series)]], in the five episode series [[Phoenix Saga (X-Men: Animated Series)|Phoenix Saga]], where his history was very similar to that of the comics. He was also responsible for the abduction of Cyclops's parents with Cyclops becoming an orphan on Earth. He also killed Cyclops's mother and imprisoned his father. D'Ken gained control over the [[M'Kraan Crystal]] in the series, however, which gave him overwhelming powers that drove him completely insane. When D'Ken was fighting Lilandra, the X-Men, and the Imperial Guard, D'Ken was eventually trapped by the Phoenix inside the M'Kraan crystal itself, in control of its vast power but unable to escape it.
