'''Aurora''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[universe]]. She first appeared in [[X-Men]] (volume 1) #120 as a member of [[Alpha Flight]]. She is the sister of [[Northstar]] and the former lover of [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]]. She has the powers of flight and superhuman speed.  While in contact with her brother, the pair can emit bursts of light.

Aurora (real name Jeanne-Marie Beaubier) has a split personality for some time: Jeanne-Marie represented her normal persona, while Aurora represented Jeanne-Marie's "darker" repressed personality traits. The personalities were later merged into one healthy personality, although her sanity has deteriorated in recent years. She was once manipulated by the [[Dark Beast]] into joining a short-lived incarnation of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]]. Aurora is currently a [[mind control]]led agent of [[Weapon X]].
