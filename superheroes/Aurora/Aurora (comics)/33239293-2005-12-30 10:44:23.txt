|}} '''Aurora''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[superhero]]ine in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[universe]]. She first appeared in Uncanny [[X-Men]] #120 as a member of [[Alpha Flight]]. She is the twin sister of [[Northstar]] and the former lover of [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]]. 

==Character Biography==
Jeanne-Marie Beaubier and her twin brother Jean-Paul were separated in infancy after their parents died. Jean-Paul was adopted by Mr. and Mrs. Louis Martin, who were cousins of his mother. The Martins could not afford to adopt Jeanne-Marie as well and arranged for Jeanne-Marie to be raised at Madame DuPont's School for Girls in LaVelle, Quebec, a reactionary religious school. Soon afterward the Martins moved to Northern Quebec. The Martins were killed in an accident several years later and Jean-Paul was placed in a foster home, unaware that he had a sister.

Extremely nervous and introverted, Jeanne-Marie Beaubier was miserable at Madame DuPont's School and at the age of thirteen, she attempted [[suicide]] by throwing herself from the roof of one of the school's buildings. Instead of falling to her death, Beaubier discovered that she could fly at great speed. Unaware that she was a [[mutant (comics)|mutant]], the deeply religious Beaubier believed that her flight was the result of a divine miracle. The next morning she explained to the school's headmistress, what she believed had happened. Believing the young girl to be guilty of [[blasphemy]], the headmistress had Beaubier [[corporal punishment|severely disciplined]]. This incident triggered a [[dissociative identity disorder]] in Jeanne-Marie. A second personality, extroverted and far more uninhibited, emerged. Under the influence of this second personality, Beaubier secretly left the school that same night. On returning three days later, she had no memory of where she had been or what she had done and she was again physically punished. The resulting trauma was so great that Beaubier repressed her second personality.

Five years later, Beaubier's application to become a teacher at the school was accepted. By this time Beaubier had adjusted to life at the school and her everyday personality was that of a prim, proper, repressed woman. But the same night that her application was accepted, her second personality re-emerged and she left to enjoy herself in Montreal. Confronted by muggers, she knocked one unconscious by moving at superhuman speed. This was the first time that she had used her superhuman powers in five years. The second mugger was halted by [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], who had witnessed the attempted assault. Recognizing that Beaubier had superhuman powers, Wolverine invited her to go to Ottawa to meet [[Guardian (comics)|James MacDonald Hudson]], who was organizing a team of superhumanly powerful agents for the Canadian government's Department H. Hudson accepted her as a recruit and reunited her with her brother. After a period of training, both Beaubier siblings joined the team that Hudson created, [[Alpha Flight]], under the code names Aurora and Northstar.

[[Image:Aurorasplit.png|130px|Jeanne-Marie mentally confronts Aurora. Art by John Byrne.|thumb|left]]Aurora has suffered from [[dissociative identity disorder]] for some time: Jeanne-Marie represented her normal persona while Aurora represented Jeanne-Marie's "darker" repressed personality traits. The personalities were later merged into one healthy personality although her sanity has deteriorated in recent years and they resplit.

Recently, Beaubier underwent still further personality changes. For a time, her "Aurora" and "Jeanne-Marie" personae have each manifested traits of the other while nevertheless remaining distinctly separate personalities. Most of the time now, she manifests a third personality which is basically Aurora's but with more of a sense of responsibility than before. 

Recently, Aurora  became a [[mind control]]led agent of [[Weapon X]] and was in an abusive relationship with the Weapon X director, who beat her. Aurora managed to retaliate against her mind-control by creating a third personality that wasn't affected. She beat the director up and managed to escape.

In addition, an alternate Aurora from relatively early in her Alpha Flight career was recently brought to the present-day with her teammates, apart from Sasquatch. At last report, this group was continuing to act as Alpha Flight in the present day.

==Powers==
She has the powers of flight and superhuman speed, theoretically able to approach light-speed.  Originally, while in contact with her brother, the pair could emit bursts of light but at one point, she had her powers altered by Walter Langkowski (Sasquatch), her lover at the time to "cloak" her from mutant-detection devices such as Sentinels. She soon discovered that she could produce light independently and touching her brother actually ''cancelled'' the ability. It appears that this may have become undone in recent years, returning this ability to its original state.
