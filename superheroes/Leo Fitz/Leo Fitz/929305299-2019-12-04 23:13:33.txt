'''Leopold James Fitz''' is a [[character (arts)|fictional character]] that originated in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] before appearing in [[Marvel Comics]]. The character, created by [[Joss Whedon]], [[Jed Whedon]] and [[Maurissa Tancharoen]], first appeared in the [[Pilot (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|pilot episode]] of ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' in 2013, and has continually been portrayed by [[Iain De Caestecker]].

In the series, Fitz is one of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s top scientific minds. His scientific knowledge is vast, and as an engineer and inventor has developed many of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s staple devices and gadgets. Many of his storylines involve his relationship with his best friend, and later lover, [[Jemma Simmons]]. Over the course of the series, Fitz suffers multiple traumas, and becomes aware of a darker and more ruthless side to his character.

== Concept and creation ==
[[Iain De Caestecker]] was cast as Leo Fitz in November 2012.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/elizabeth-henstridge-iain-de-caestecker-shield-joss-whedon-389604 |title=Joss Whedon's 'S.H.I.E.L.D.'

When I found out about it, I did my own research and correlated it together. It's just something that should never be trivialized. It's a real and serious thing to a lot of people, brain trauma, so we just have to constantly be respectful towards it. We talk about it all the time. Even if you don't see it or it's not obvious, it's always something that's in our heads that we're keeping going. It's the realization that you never get fully better, it's about embracing the new side of you and making that work in the world that you're in. I suppose the idea of a cure—I don't know if that could happen."<ref name="HenstridgeDeCaesteckerS2" /> For Fitz's costume design, Foley tried to have his clothes reflect his personality, without "getting too cliché...we try and play up his "heritage style"...using classic design details on him like paisley & leather elbow patches and mixing them with different plaids."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://tyrannyofstyle.com/agents-of-shield-costume-design |title=Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

== Characterization ==
De Caestecker, in describing the character, said that "Fitz has got this funny kind of temper. He’s quite passionate about what he does. So those moments where—I don’t think he’s someone that really responds very quickly to emotion; he doesn’t really understand emotions as much".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://shieldsite.net/s-h-i-e-l-d-on-set-iain-de-caestecker-on-character-development-sif-a-monkey-for-fitz/21186 |title=S.H.I.E.L.D.

He’s consumed within that world, and he works very closely with Simmons, who’s Biochem. They’ve got this kind of weird chemistry together, and they just kind of fit each other in a very weird way."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://au.ign.com/articles/2013/07/17/marvels-agents-of-shield-iain-de-caestecker-on-agent-leo-fitz |title=Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Iain De Caestecker on Agent Leo Fitz |last=Goldman |first=Eric |date=July 16, 2013 |website=[[IGN]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6SY6rR6sr?url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/17/marvels-agents-of-shield-iain-de-caestecker-on-agent-leo-fitz |archive-date=September 13, 2014 |access-date=July 5, 2019}}</ref> Regarding the changing dynamic over time between Fitz and Simmons, De Caestecker said "I suppose what's happened from the start of season two up to midseason is, they've become a lot stronger as individuals, I think. But I think they still care for and need each other a lot, and they also work better together when they are together. But I think there's a lot of things that have still been unsaid and will hopefully come out, certain confrontations that are still bubbling under."<ref name="HenstridgeDeCaesteckerS2" /> Fitz also develops a close friendship with [[Mack (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Alphonso "Mack" MacKenzie]], beginning when the latter joins the cast in season two.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://comics2film.com/marvel-s-agents-of-s-h-i-e-l-d-fitz-mack-s-bromance |title=Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. {{!}} Fitz + Mack's Bromance |date=July 31, 2019 |website=Comics2Film |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190812161246/https://comics2film.com/marvel-s-agents-of-s-h-i-e-l-d-fitz-mack-s-bromance |archive-date=August 12, 2019 |access-date=August 12, 2019}}</ref>
