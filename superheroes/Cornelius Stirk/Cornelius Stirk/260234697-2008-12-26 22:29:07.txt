'''Cornelius Stirk''' is a fictional character in the [[DC Universe]].  He first appeared in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #592 ([[November 1988]]) as an enemy of [[Batman]].

==Character overview==

Stirk, like [[Scarecrow (comics)|Scarecrow]], uses fear to get to his victims. Stirk has the ability to make other people see him as someone else, allowing him to get close to his victims. He operates under the [[delusion]] that he requires the [[nutrient]]s and [[hormone]]s from peoples' hearts in order to stay alive, and these are best prepared with [[norepinephrine]] by inducing fear in the victim prior to death. 

In his first appearance, Stirk is released from [[Arkham Asylum]], where he is confined at the age of 16 for trying to kill a classmate, after being certified as [[sanity|sane]] &mdash; probably following his use of his [[psychic]] abilities on his doctors. He then subsequently stops taking his medication and begins his escalation into a [[serial killer]]. 

===Knightfall===
During the "[[Knightfall]]" storyline, Stirk works with the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] in an attempt to kidnap [[Commissioner Gordon]]. However, Stirk tries to kill Gordon rather than kidnap him, much to Joker's dismay. Gordon hallucinates that Stirk is actually Batman as Stirk tried to kill Gordon with a knife. Batman stops Stirk, but Gordon is still screaming in fear. In order to capture Stirk, Batman is forced to leave a terrified Gordon with [[Sarah Essen Gordon|his wife]], who brings him to a hospital.
