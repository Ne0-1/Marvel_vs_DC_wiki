'''Cornelius Stirk''' is a fictional criminal in the [[DC Universe]].  He first appeared in ''Detective Comics'' #592 (November 1988).

==Fictional character biography==

A [[sociopath]] who takes [[Sadism and Masochism|sadistic]] pleasure in the pain of others, Stirk, like [[Scarecrow (comics)|Scarecrow]], uses fear to get to his victims. Stirk has the ability to make other people see him as someone else, allowing him to get close to his victims. He operates under the delusion that he requires the [[nutrient]]s and [[hormone]]s from peoples' hearts in order to stay alive, and these are best prepared with [[norepinephrine]] by inducing fear in the victim prior to death. Stirk was released from [[Arkham Asylum]], where he was confined at the age of 16 for trying to kill a classmate, after being certified as sane &mdash; probably following his use of his [[psychic]] abilities on his doctors. He then subsequently stopped taking his medication and began his escalation into a [[serial killer]]. 

===Knightfall===
During the "[[Knightfall]]" storyline, Stirk worked with the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] in an attempt to kidnap [[Commissioner Gordon]]. However, Stirk needed norepinephrine to survive, so he tried to kill Gordon rather than kidnap him, much to Joker's dismay. Gordon hallucinated that Stirk was actually Batman as Stirk tried to kill Gordon with a [[knife]]. Batman managed to stop Stirk, but Gordon was still screaming in fear. With no time to help his friend, Batman had to leave a terrified Gordon with his wife, who led him to a hospital.
