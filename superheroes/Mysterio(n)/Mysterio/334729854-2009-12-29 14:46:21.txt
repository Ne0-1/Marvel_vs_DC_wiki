'''Mysterio''' is the name of three [[fictional character]]s, all [[supervillain]]s and enemies of [[Spider-Man]] in the {{Marvel Universe}}. The original Mysterio ('''Quentin Beck''') was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]] and [[first appearance|first appears]] in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #13, although it was later [[retroactive continuity|retconned]] that the aliens seen in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #2 had been Mysterio and his men in disguise; it was revealed that he had been hired by the [[Tinkerer]] to disguise himself as an extraterrestrial and uncover military and industrial secrets.  <ref> {{Cite comic

==Fictional character biography==
===Character overview===
Debuting in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #13, Mysterio is '''Quentin Beck''', a [[special effect]]s wizard and stunt man working for a major Hollywood studio with dreams of making a name for himself in the film industry. However, he came to see his career in special effects as a dead-end job, but realized that his expertise in illusions could make him an effective supervillain.

In his first battle with Spider-Man, Mysterio obstructs the hero's [[Spider-Man's powers and equipment#Spider-sense|spider-sense]] with gas and dissolves his webbing with a chemical abrasive.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #13</ref> He later joins the [[Sinister Six]] in an attempt at revenge on Spider-Man.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #1</ref> Mysterio later creates the alias of world-renowned psychiatrist Dr. Ludwig Rinehart, using technology and [[hypnosis]] in an attempt to make Spider-Man lose his mind.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #24</ref> Mysterio then establishes a brief partnership with the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]] in a plot to kill Spider-Man and the [[Human Torch]] on a Hollywood movie set.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #4</ref> He goes on to convince Spider-Man he is {{convert|6|in|mm}} tall using a post-hypnotic suggestion.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #66-67</ref>

While incarcerated, Beck's cellmate Daniel Berkhart briefly becomes Mysterio on the original's behalf.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #141</ref> Out of prison, Beck resumes his Ludwig Rinehart identity to manipulate Spider-Man's [[Aunt May]] into revealing the whereabouts of a lost fortune hidden in her house.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #198-199</ref> Beck used bogus alien disguises to frighten May Parker into revealing the location of the fortune, but then learned that the money had long ago been eaten by [[silverfish]].<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #50-51</ref> In his next appearance, Mysterio tricks Spider-Man into believing that he had caused the death of a bystander.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #311</ref> Mysterio then attempts to scare the tenants from an apartment complex in real estate thwarted by the preteen superhero team, [[Power Pack]].<ref>''Power Pack'' #55</ref> He is recruited by [[Doctor Octopus]] to form the second Sinister Six, and battles Spider-Man.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #335-339</ref>

In other encounters, Mysterio has faked the death of Spider-Man's [[Aunt May]], and made deals with demons from [[Otherplace|Limbo]]. Despite this, however, Mysterio was constantly beaten by Spider-Man and usually arrested. He joined Doctor Octopus' Sinister Six on several occasions, but this never gave him the edge against his foe that he desired.  Eventually, he began to lose credibility as a supervillain with his defeat at the hands of Power Pack, being a particularly humiliating moment.

After his final imprisonment, Mysterio was given an early release, as he had been diagnosed with a [[brain tumor]] and [[lung cancer]], both caused by the chemicals and radiation from his equipment. He was given one year to live. Obsessed with enacting his final revenge on Spider-Man, he was disappointed when he deduced from newspaper articles that the current Spider-Man was just a [[Ben Reilly|clone]], and saw no dignity in overpowering a 'copy' of the real thing (even though by then, the clone had been killed, and the current Spider-Man was indeed the original). Mysterio decided to change his plan and focus on [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], who he had encountered recently during an insurance scam that the Man Without Fear had thwarted; he believed that he had found a 'kindred spirit' in Daredevil, in the sense that both were second stringers with little reputation outside their homes. 

After the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] gave Mysterio all the information he possessed about Daredevil's past, Mysterio developed an elaborate plot to drive Daredevil insane. Daredevil was nearly manipulated into killing an innocent baby (falsely accused of being the [[Antichrist]]), [[Karen Page]] was killed by [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] after Mysterio had convinced her that she was suffering from [[HIV]] due to her time as a [[pornographic actor|porn star]], Matt Murdock's partner [[Foggy Nelson]] was framed for murder after cheating on his current lover, and Daredevil nearly lost his mind as he appeared to be tormented by the forces of Hell. 

However, Daredevil's will proved stronger than Mysterio expected, and he unmasked Mysterio as the mastermind, shattering the villain's helmet in fury and revealing his now languishing appearance. Beck had thought Daredevil would kill him upon discovery, which in his eyes, was a "grand way to end his final show". Daredevil denied him this and instead verbally abused Mysterio's plot and very existence, dismissing Mysterio's scheme as a basic 'B-Movie' plot and calling Mysterio a 'human xerox', incapable of having an original thought in his life; if nothing else, the Kingpin had already attempted to drive Daredevil insane, and he had used the 'supernatural intruding on our world' idea in a previous attack on [[J. Jonah Jameson]]. Broken in every sense of the word, Mysterio, saying he was stealing an idea from [[Kraven the Hunter]], pulled out a gun and shot himself dead. While Mysterio has faked his own death several times in the past, this act was legitimate, as Mysterio had nothing left to live for.

===Daniel Berkhart===
[[Image:Mysterio1.jpg|left|185px|thumb|Daniel Berkhart as Mysterio.]]Someone claiming to be Mysterio appeared later with the revised [[Sinister Six]], making references to his 'death', stating how after fighting Daredevil he had exited in a 'most spectacular fashion'. There was some confusion to this Mysterio's identity until ''Spider-Man: The Mysterio Manifesto'' hinted that it was '''Daniel Berkhart''', an old friend of Beck and a previous [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)#Mad Jack(s)|Jack-O-Lantern]] who had taken over the mantle of Mysterio during a period when Beck had previously faked his death, and has reassumed it after Beck's death. This issue was not addressed again until a Mysterio briefly fought Spider-Man and was captured in ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited (comics)|Spider-Man Unlimited]]'' (Vol. III) #7. In a recent storyline in ''[[Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man]]'' #12, Berkhart was confirmed to be this second Mysterio by [[#Return of Beck|Quentin Beck]].

===Return of Beck===
[[Image:Mysterio02.png|145px|Mysterio unmasked in ''[[Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man]]'' #12. Art by [[Todd Nauck]].|right|thumb]]
In ''[[Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man]]'' #11-13, a teleporting [[mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] named '''[[Mysterio (Francis Klum)|Francis Klum]]''' plots to destroy the recently unmasked Spider-Man in revenge for events shown in ''[[Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil that Men Do|The Evil That Men Do]]''. Klum purchases the Mysterio costume, and turns the school Peter Parker teaches at into a 'haunted house', filling it with death-traps. Klum's actions bring the attention of Daniel Berkhart, who arrives and prepares to team up with Spider-Man in order to defeat Klum. 

Beck appears in the school auditorium in a dark red version of his costume and confronts Klum, before leaving him for Berkhart to deal with. Beck then confronts [[Miss Arrow]], revealing that half his head is missing from the gunshot wound, and explains that, having gone to Hell for suicide, his "superiors" in the afterlife sent him back to Earth to maintain a cosmic balance. He also believes Miss Arrow to have a similar role, for the "other side", although she denies this.

In ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #581, a flashback shows that prior to his suicide, Beck had been hired by Norman Osborn to fake his son Harry's death.  According to the letters page of #589.

Beck is scheduled to make a return in [[Spider-Man: Enter the Gauntlet|a future Spider-Man story]]. According to writer [[Dan Slott]], Mysterio will also return with his "fishbowl" helmet.<ref>http://comics.ign.com/articles/102/1026877p6.html</ref> He will also bring members of the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] crime syndicate with him.<ref>http://marvel.com/news/comicstories.9900.FIRST_LOOK~colon~_January_2010_Spidey_Previews</ref>

==Powers, abilities and equipment==
Quentin Beck did not possess superhuman abilities but was an expert designer of special effects devices and stage illusions, a master [[hypnosis|hypnotist]] and [[Magic (illusion)|magician]], and an amateur chemist and [[roboticist]]. He had extensive knowledge of hand-to-hand combat techniques learned as a stuntman. 

Daniel Berkhart, a former friend and protégé of Beck's, had some of the same training and skills as Beck.

Francis Klum has the mutant ability to teleport both himself and other objects, and the ability to control other people's body parts, as well as an understanding of the technologies in the Mysterio suit.

Mysterio's suit has personal weaponry which include a helmet with a [[holography|holographic]] projector and gloves and boots armed with nozzles which emit [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogenic]] gas. He developed a gas that can cancel Spider-Man's spider-sense, and when he is cloaked in his mist gases, he uses sonar to detect objects and beings nearby.

==In other media==
===Television===
*Mysterio was a villain in the 1960s ''[[Spider-Man (1967 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' animated series in two popular episodes from the first season, ''The Menace of Mysterio'' (one of two half-hour episodes of the season) and ''Return of the Flying Dutchman''.  Mysterio also appears in a third-season episode ''The Madness of Mysterio'', although he appears out of costume and has red hair and green skin.  In all three episodes, he was voiced by [[Chris Wiggins]]; this portrayal of the character has since inspired later actors to give Mysterio a British accent. 

*He later appeared in the ''[[Spider-Man (1981 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' episode "The Pied Piper of New York Town", hypnotizing the youth of New York.  He then made an appearance in ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'', in the episode "Spidey Goes Hollywood" voiced by [[Peter Cullen]].<ref>[http://voicechasers.com/database/showactor.php?actorid=1268]</ref> He blackmails a director to persuade Spider-Man to star in a movie, rigged with devices he created.

*[[Image:Spidermanep5.jpg|180px|Mysterio in [[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]].|right|thumb]] In ''[[Spider-Man: The Animated Series]],'' Mysterio, voiced by [[Gregg Berger]]<ref>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112175/fullcredits#cast</ref>, was a supervillain who blames Spider-Man for ruining his reputation.  In [[The Menace of Mysterio|his first appearance]], Mysterio frames Spider-Man for various crimes, but his plan is exposed by Spider-Man and [[Characters in Spider-Man (1994 TV series)#Detective Terri Lee|Detective Terri Lee]], and he is jailed.  Later, he becomes a member of the [[Sinister Six|Insidious Six]] in the episodes ''The Insidious Six'' and ''Battle of the Insidious Six''.  In Mysterio's final appearance in the series, ''The Haunting of Mary Jane Watson'', he creates a studio in secret. Spider-Man discovers that Mysterio was in love with a woman named Miranda Wilson, a former actress who was disfigured and planned the entire kidnapping to swap bodies with the similar-looking Mary Jane.  The studio exploded, Spider-Man saved the Mary Jane clone, and Mysterio apparently died in the explosion, staying with Miranda to the end.  In the five-part ''Six Forgotten Warriors'' storyline, in which the Kingpin hires the Insidious Six again, the Vulture replaces the late Mysterio.

At the end, Mysterio is freed from the police by the Tinkerer and it turns out that they are both working for the enigmatic Master Planner. He returns in the episode "Reinforcement". Joining the Sinister Six, he attacks Spider-Man alongside Kraven the Hunter, and the trio end up in a mall. He doesn't really fight, but helps the hunter with robot duplicates of himself. When Kraven is defeated, Mysterio tries to escape but is stopped by Spidey's web fluid. He is the only member to be captured because the others are extracted by the [[Tinkerer]] before the police can arrive. In the episode ''Identity Crisis'' the reporter [[Ned Leeds|Ned Lee]] is interviewing Quentin Beck when Peter Parker was rumored to be Spider-Man. Quentin Beck states that he hopes that Parker is Spider-Man and that a lot of people in the [[prison]] would know what to do with that info.
