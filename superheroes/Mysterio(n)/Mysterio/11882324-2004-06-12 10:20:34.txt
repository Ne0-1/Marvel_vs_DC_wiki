'''Mysterio''' (Quentin Beck) is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  He is a frequent adversary of [[Spider-Man]].  He first appeared disguised as an alien in ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #2, and appeared as Mysterio in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #13.  He is an expert designer of special effects devices and stage illusions, a master hypnotist and prestidigitator, and an amateur chemist and roboticist. He has extensive knowledge of hand-to-hand combat techniques learned as a stuntman but doesn't otherwise possess superhuman abilities. His personal weaponry includes a one-way plexiglass helmet with holographic projector and gloves and boots armed with nozzles which emit hallucinogenic gas. He does have some more advanced technology (not of his own design) at his disposal.

Recently, Mysterio apparently committed suicide following a failed plot to drive [[Daredevil (comics)|Daredevil]] insane (''Daredevil'' volume 2 #7).  However, a Mysterio reappeared with the [[Sinister Six]] soon afterward.  This may have been Quentin Beck, having faked his own death; Beck's former assistant Daniel Berkhart; Beck's cousin Maguire "Terry" Beck; or an entirely different person using the Mysterio identity.
