'''Mysterio''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]] and an enemy of [[Spider-Man]]. Mysterio was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]]. His first appearance was in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #13, although it was later [[retcon]]ned that the aliens seen in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #2 were actually Mysterio and his men in disguise.

==Biography==

Mysterio's true identity was Quentin Beck, a special-effects wizard who worked for a major studio and had dreams to make a name for himself in the film industry. However, he lacked the looks and talent to be a star and the patience to be a director, and saw his career in special-effects to be a dead-end job. When a friend jokingly suggested that the quickest way to become famous is to take out a costumed hero, Beck realized that his expertise in illusions could make him an effective supervillain. Choosing Spider-Man, a relatively weak and inexperienced target, Beck prepared his resources for a few months before attempting to eliminate the wall-crawler. Mysterio, his chosen identity, became one of Spider-Man's most elusive and persistent foes.

Mysterio showed his full range of talents in his first battle with Spider-Man, fogging the hero's Spider-Sense with a special gas and dissolving his webbing with a chemical abrasive. In other encounters, Mysterio has faked the death of Spider-Man's [[Aunt May]], impersonated a world-reknowned psychiatrist to convince Spider-Man that he was losing his mind, and made deals with demons from Limbo. Despite this, however, Mysterio was constantly bested by Spider-Man and usually arrested. He joined [[Doctor Octopus]]' [[Sinister Six]] on several occasions, but this never gave him the edge against his foe that he desired.  Eventually, he began to lose creditibilty as a supervillain with his defeat at the hands of the preteen superhero team, [[Power Pack]], being a particularly humiliating moment.

After his final imprisonment, Mysterio was given an early release, as he had been diagnosed with a [[brain tumor]] and [[lung cancer]], both caused by the chemicals and radiation from his equipment. He was given one year to live. Obsessed with enacting his final revenge on Spider-Man, he discovered that the current Spider-Man was just a [[Ben Reilly|clone]]. Mysterio decided to change his plan and focus on [[Daredevil]], who he had encountered recently, instead. 

Working with the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]],  he developed an elaborate plot to drive Daredevil insane. Daredevil was nearly manipulated into killing an innocent baby (falsely accused of being the [[Antichrist]]), [[Karen Page]] was killed by [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]], and Daredevil nearly lost his mind as he appeared to be tormented by the forces of Hell. However, Daredevil's will proved stronger than Mysterio expected, and he unmasked Mysterio as the mastermind, shattering the villain's helmet in fury and revealing his now languishing appearance. With nothing left to live for, Mysterio, saying he was stealing an idea from [[Kraven the Hunter]], pulled out a gun and committed suicide before Daredevil could stop him. While Mysterio has faked his own death several times in the past, it is likely that this death was the real thing.

==Powers and Abilities==
  
Quentin Beck was an expert designer of special effects devices and stage illusions, a master hypnotist and prestidigitator, and an amateur chemist and roboticist. He had extensive knowledge of hand-to-hand combat techniques learned as a stuntman but didn't otherwise possess superhuman abilities. His personal weaponry included a one-way plexiglass helmet with holographic projector and gloves and boots armed with nozzles which emit hallucinogenic gas. He did have some more advanced technology (not of his own design) at his disposal. 

==New Mysterio==

Another Mysterio appeared later with the revised [[Sinister Six]]. There was some confusion as to who it was until ''Spider-Man: The Mysterio Manifesto'' hinted that it was '''Daniel Berkhart''', an old friend of Beck and a previous [[Jack-O-Lantern (comics)|Jack-O-Lantern]] who had taken over the mantle of Mysterio before and has reassumed it after Beck's death. This issue has not been addressed since, although a Mysterio briefly fought Spider-Man and was captured in ''Spider-Man Unlimited (Vol. III) #7''.

==Mysterio in Other Media==

Mysterio was a villain in the 1960s ''Spider-Man'' animated series in two of the better received episodes, voiced by [[Chris Wiggins]].  There was also a later appearance of the villain even though he looks completely different. Wiggins' portrayal of the character has since inspired later actors to also give Mysterio a somewhat camp British accent.

Mysterio was the main villain in the [[video game]] ''Spider-Man: Mysterio's Menace'', a henchman of Doctor Octopus in Spider-Man: The Return of the Sinister Six, and the 2000 ''Spider-Man'' game (voiced by [[Daran Norris]]), the main villain in the old pc game "The Amazing Spider Man", and was Spider-Man's rival in the game based on ''Spider-Man 2'' (voiced by [[James Arnold Taylor]]). Oddly, in this latter appearance, Mysterio's face is clearly visible through his helmet, a look completely antithetical to the established character.

In [[Spider-Man: The Animated Series]], Mysterio, voiced by Greg Berger, was a supervillain did Spider-Man encountered.  His origin is that he blames Spider-Man for ruining his reputation.  In his first appearance, Mysterio began framing Spider-Man for doing crimes.  Later, he became a member of the Insidious Six.  Later, Mysterio created a studio. Then, he began kidnapping Mary Jane.  In the end of his final appearance, Mysterio died by the explosion of his own studio, which in ''Six Forgotten Warriors'', [[Vulture (comics)|Vulture]] was replaced as a member of the Insidious SIx.
