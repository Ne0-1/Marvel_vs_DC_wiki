'''Mysterio''' is the name of three [[fictional character]]s, all of which are [[supervillain]]s and enemies of [[Spider-Man]] in the {{Marvel Universe}}. The original Mysterio ('''Quentin Beck''') was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]] and [[first appearance|first appears]] in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #13, although it was later [[retroactive continuity|retconned]] that the aliens seen in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #2 had been Mysterio and his men in disguise; it was revealed that he had been hired by the [[Tinkerer]] to disguise himself as an extraterrestrial and uncover military and industrial secrets.<ref>{{Cite comic

==Fictional character biography==
===Character overview===
Debuting in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #13, Mysterio is '''Quentin Beck''', a [[special effect]]s wizard and stunt man working for a major Hollywood studio with dreams of making a name for himself in the film industry. However, he came to see his career in special effects as a dead-end job, but realized that his expertise in illusions could make him an effective supervillain.

In his first battle with Spider-Man, after he frames him for robbing the Midtown Museum, Mysterio obstructs the hero's [[spider-sense]] with gas and dissolves his webbing with a chemical abrasive. However Spider-Man tricked him into revealing he robbed the museum, then revealed he had captured it on tape. Mysterio was then jailed.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #13</ref> He later joins the [[Sinister Six]] in an attempt at revenge on Spider-Man, and battles him using robots of the [[X-Men]]. After this Spider-Man gets a card that enables him to go on to battle Sandman.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #1</ref> Mysterio later creates the alias of world-renowned psychiatrist Dr. Ludwig Rinehart, using technology and [[hypnosis]] in an attempt to make Spider-Man lose his mind, and nearly convincing him to unmask, though ironically Spider-Man was helped by [[J. Jonah Jameson]] suddenly bursting into the house. Spider-Man then unmasked Mysterio.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #24</ref> Mysterio then establishes a brief partnership with the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]] in a plot to kill Spider-Man and the [[Human Torch]] on a Hollywood movie set by pretending to enroll them in a film. However they were both defeatd and arrested.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #4</ref> He threatens to destroy the city while on TV, and goes on to convince Spider-Man he is {{convert|6|in|mm}} tall using a post-hypnotic suggestion and a miniature funfair, but Spider-Man sees through the illusion and captures Mysterio.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #66-67</ref>

While Beck is incarcerated, his cellmate Daniel Berkhart briefly becomes Mysterio on the original's behalf.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #141</ref> Out of prison, Beck resumes his Ludwig Rinehart identity to manipulate Spider-Man's [[Aunt May]] into revealing the whereabouts of a lost fortune hidden in her house.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #198-199</ref> Beck used bogus alien disguises to frighten May Parker into revealing the location of the fortune, but then learned that the money had long ago been eaten by [[silverfish]].<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #50-51</ref> In his next appearance, Mysterio tricks Spider-Man into believing that he had caused the death of a bystander.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #311</ref> Mysterio then attempts to scare the tenants from an apartment complex in real estate thwarted by the preteen superhero team, [[Power Pack]],<ref>''Power Pack'' #55</ref> much to his later humiliation. He is recruited by [[Doctor Octopus]] to form the second Sinister Six, and battles Spider-Man.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #335-339</ref>

In other encounters, Mysterio has faked the death of Spider-Man's [[Aunt May]], and made deals with demons from [[Otherplace|Limbo]]. Despite this, however, Mysterio was constantly beaten by Spider-Man and usually arrested. He joined Doctor Octopus' Sinister Six on several occasions, but this never gave him the edge against his foe that he desired.  Eventually, he began to lose credibility as a supervillain, with his defeat at the hands of Power Pack being a particularly humiliating moment.

After his final imprisonment, Mysterio was given an early release, as he had been diagnosed with a [[brain tumor]] and [[lung cancer]], both caused by the chemicals and radiation from his equipment. He was given one year to live, but this imminent death caused prison psychiatrists to grant him early release. Obsessed with exacting his final revenge on Spider-Man, he was disappointed when he deduced from newspaper articles that the current Spider-Man was just a [[Ben Reilly|clone]], and saw no dignity in overpowering a 'copy' of the real thing (even though by then, the clone had been killed, and the current Spider-Man was indeed the original). Mysterio decided to change his plan and focus on [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], who he had encountered recently during an insurance scam that the Man Without Fear had thwarted; he believed that he had found a 'kindred spirit' in Daredevil, in the sense that both were second stringers with little reputation outside their homes. 

After the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] gave Mysterio all the information he possessed about Daredevil's past, Mysterio developed an elaborate plot to drive Daredevil insane using a special designed drug. Daredevil was nearly manipulated into killing an innocent baby (falsely accused of being the [[Antichrist]]), [[Karen Page]] was killed by [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] after Mysterio had convinced her that she was suffering from [[HIV]] due to her time as a [[pornographic actor|porn star]], Matt Murdock's partner [[Foggy Nelson]] was framed for murder after cheating on his current lover, and Daredevil nearly lost his mind as he appeared to be tormented by the forces of Hell.  

However, Daredevil's will proved stronger than Mysterio expected, and once [[Doctor Strange]] discovers and magically removed the drug from Daredevil's blood stream, Daredevil unmasked Mysterio as the mastermind, shattering the villain's helmet in fury and revealing his now languishing appearance. Beck had thought Daredevil would kill him upon discovery, which in his eyes, was a "grand way to end his final show". Daredevil denied him this and instead verbally abused Mysterio's plot and very existence, dismissing Mysterio's scheme as a basic 'B-Movie' plot and calling Mysterio a 'human xerox', incapable of having an original thought in his life; if nothing else, the Kingpin had already attempted to drive Daredevil insane, and he had used the 'supernatural intruding on our world' idea in a previous attack on [[J. Jonah Jameson]]. Broken in every sense of the word, Mysterio, saying he was stealing an idea from [[Kraven the Hunter]], pulled out a gun and shot himself dead. While Mysterio has faked his own death several times in the past, this act was legitimate, as Mysterio had nothing left to live for.<ref>''Daredevil'' Vol. 2 #1-7</ref>

===Daniel Berkhart===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Mysterio1.jpg|left|185px|thumb|Daniel Berkhart as Mysterio.]] -->Someone claiming to be Mysterio appeared later with the revised [[Sinister Six]], making references to his 'death', stating how after fighting Daredevil he had exited in a 'most spectacular fashion'. There was some confusion to this Mysterio's identity until ''Spider-Man: The Mysterio Manifesto'' hinted that it was '''Daniel Berkhart''', an old friend of Beck and a previous [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)#Mad Jack(s)|Jack-O-Lantern]] who had taken over the mantle of Mysterio during a period when Beck had previously faked his death, and has reassumed it after Beck's death. This issue was not addressed again until a Mysterio briefly fought Spider-Man and was captured in ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited (comics)|Spider-Man Unlimited]]'' (Vol. III) #7. In ''[[Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man]]'' #12, Berkhart was confirmed to be this second Mysterio by [[#Return of Beck|Quentin Beck]].

===Francis Klum===
{{Main|Mysterio (Francis Klum)}}
[[Image:Mysterio2.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Francis Klum as Mysterio . Art by [[Todd Nauck]].]]
In ''[[Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man]]'' #11-13, a teleporting [[mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] named '''Francis Klum''' plots to destroy the recently unmasked Spider-Man in revenge for events shown in ''[[Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil that Men Do|The Evil That Men Do]]''. Klum purchases the Mysterio costume, and turns the school Peter Parker teaches at into a 'haunted house', filling it with death-traps. Klum's actions bring the attention of Daniel Berkhart, who arrives and prepares to team up with Spider-Man in order to defeat Klum.

===Return of Beck===
[[Image:Mysterio02.png|150px|Mysterio unmasked in ''[[Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man]]'' #12. Art by [[Todd Nauck]].|left|thumb]]
Beck appears in the school auditorium in a dark red version of his costume and confronts Klum, before leaving him for Berkhart to deal with. Beck then confronts [[Miss Arrow]], revealing that half his head is missing from the gunshot wound, and explains that, having gone to Hell for suicide, his "superiors" in the afterlife sent him back to Earth to maintain a cosmic balance. His superiors want Spider-Man to continue working at the school and Beck knows Miss Arrow has a similar role for the "other side".

Berkhart and Klum briefly battle one another before Spider-Man captures Berkhart. While trying to escape, Klum runs into Arrow and tries to take her as a hostage, only to be stabbed by one of her stingers. He then teleports away, badly bleeding.<ref>''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' #11-13</ref> Neither Berkhart nor Klum have been seen since. Though Berkhart was incarcerated, Klum's status is uncertain.

In ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #581, a flashback shows that prior to his suicide, Beck had been hired by Norman Osborn to fake his son Harry's death.  
[[Image:Spider-Man Enter-the-Gauntlet Mysterio.jpg|145px|Mysterio returns in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' Art by [[Marcos Martin]].|right|thumb]]
Mysterio reappears during ''[[The Gauntlet and Grim Hunt|The Gauntlet]]'' storyline in Amazing Spider-Man, which re-introduces several past Spider-Man villains with new twists. This Mysterio claims to be a returned Quentin Beck who had faked his death, though it's unclear how this fits in with his aforementioned appearance. He is under the employ of Maggia crime member Carmine, creating androids of various deceased Maggia (including their dead leader [[Silvermane (comics)|Silvermane]]) to give them a credibility boost in their gang war with [[Mister Negative]]. Beck controls the Silvermane robot himself and plants seeds of rebellion in [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]], who had left the Maggia under the belief that Silvermane was deceased. He also tries to drive Spider-Man mad by making him think he's accidentally killed several gang members, while trying to convince him that a returning [[George Stacy|Captain George Stacy]], who claims to have always been the gangster known as The [[Big Man]], also faked his death years earlier. This turn makes Spider-Man realize that Mysterio must be behind the recent mysterious return of so many deceased individuals, and he vows to have Mysterio pay for making it personal. Shortly after, Mysterio uses the Silvermane robot to murder Carmine in an attempt to secretly seize control of the Maggia and its fortune. Spider-Man eventually exposes and confronts Mysterio, who flees.  He later runs into [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]], who tells him that he has some friends who are "dying" to meet him.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #618-620</ref>

The "friends" Chameleon was talking about happens to be the Kravinoffs.  He was present at the ritual where Spider-Man is seemingly sacrificed in order to revive [[Kraven the Hunter]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #635</ref>

During the ''Origin of the Species'' storyline, Mysterio is among the supervillains invited by Doctor Octopus to join his villains' team where he is promised that he will receive a reward.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #642</ref> Mysterio went after Spider-Man for [[Menace (Marvel Comics)|Menace]]'s infant. He tries to use illusion effects to frighten Spider-Man but fails, thus leaving him a reminder.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #644</ref>

==Powers, abilities, and equipment==
Quentin Beck does not possess superhuman abilities but he is an expert designer of special effects devices and stage illusions, a master [[hypnosis|hypnotist]] and [[Magic (illusion)|magician]], and an amateur chemist and [[roboticist]]. He had extensive knowledge of hand-to-hand combat techniques learned as a stuntman, allowing him to engage in combat with Spider-Man despite his foe's superior physical abilities. 

Mysterio's suit has personal weaponry which include many devices that aid him in his many agendas. His most striking feature, his helmet, is made of a one way plexiglass material, meaning he can see out but no one can see in. The helmet also includes an air supply to protect him from his own gasses, a Sonar to navigate within his own mist cloak and a [[holography|holographic]] projector to aid in 3D illusions that can be used to fool the weak willed. His boots contain magnetic coil springs which allow him impressive leaps as well as the ability to cling to surfaces. His most distinctive and persistant trademark however is his smokescreen cloak. Mysterio's costume contains nozzles in the boots and wrists that can release a constant stream of smoke, that shields his movements as well as enhancing his mystique. He can mix various other chemicals into this smokescreen for various effects. Such chemicals include; a gas that dullens and inhibits Spider-Man's spider-sense, a gas that causes paralysis in those that breath it for 30 minutes, a chemical abrasive that eats away Spider-Man's webbing, hypnogens that make those around him more susceptible to his will and halloucinogens to cause vivid halloucinations in those who experience it. A combination of the hypnogens and halloucinogens along with his holographic projectors are how Mysterio achieves most of his illusions. The costume sometimes also includes offensive weaponry, such as lasers or knockout gas nozzles in eye emblems on his shoulders, or electric coils within his cape to electrocute those who touch it. He also employs many different weapons, such as handheld hypnotic aids or robotic drones, to further his aims in battle. 

Daniel Berkhart, a former friend and protégé of Beck's, had some of the same training and skills as Beck.

Francis Klum has the mutant ability to teleport both himself and other objects, and the ability to control other people's body parts, as well as an understanding of the technologies in the Mysterio suit.

[[Image:SpectacularMysterio.jpg|175px|left|thumb|Mysterio in [[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|''The Spectacular Spider-Man'']].]]
* Mysterio first appears in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' episode "Persona" voiced by [[Xander Berkeley]]. He is one of the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]]'s henchmen alongside Phineas Mason.

Quentin takes on the identity of Mysterio in the season two episode "Blueprints". He steals tech from Tricorp and Oscorp, pretending to be a sorcerer "saving" man kind from technology. He defeats Spider-Man twice but Spidey discovers his lair and defeats him after realising that he does not use magic but technology and illusions, the tech itself is not a threat while the illusions could not fool Spider-Man's spider sense. Mysterio is seemingly taken to jail, but in the end, it's revealed it was actually a [[robot]] made in Beck's image; when asked why he did this he stated that he did not want anyone else taking the credit for his performance as Mysterio. The real Mysterio is also revealed to be working with the Tinkerer for the enigmatic Master Planner. He returns in the episode "Reinforcement" as part of the new Sinister Six. He attacks Spider-Man alongside Kraven the Hunter, and the trio end up in a mall. He does not really fight, but helps Kraven the Hunter with robot duplicates of himself.

After unmasking him, Spider-Man questions Quentin Beck about who is the Master Planner. He is arrested by the police, while the others villains were extracted by the [[Tinkerer]].

Quentin Beck states that he hopes that Parker is Spider-Man and that a lot of people in the [[prison]] would know what to do with that info. In the episode "Opening Night," however, it is revealed that the Quentin Beck that was imprisoned in the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]] was actually a [[robot]] that can switch between Quentin Beck and Mysterio (since [[Montana (comics)|Montana]], or [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]] knew how to do this, It's implied that the two were in an alliance). The robotic Mysterio aides the other villains in the Vault in fighting Spider-Man, but is accidentally destroyed by [[Molten Man]]. The real Quentin Beck's whereabouts remain unrevealed.

* Mysterio has been reproduced as a mini-bust and as a thirteen-inch (330&nbsp;mm)  statue by [[Bowen Designs]]. He has likewise been crafted as a mini-bust by [[Art Asylum]] as part of their Rogues Gallery line. He also makes up one-seventh of the "Sinister Six" statue set from Diamond Select.
* Hasbro will be adding a [[Spider-Man 2]] game version Mysterio to their [[Spider-Man 3]] Movie figures series as well as [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]] and [[Vulture (comics)|Vulture]]. Source can be found on Cooltoyreview.com.
