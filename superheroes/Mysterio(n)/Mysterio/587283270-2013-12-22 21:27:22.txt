Debuting in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #13, Mysterio is Quentin Beck, a [[special effect]]s wizard and stunt man working for a major Hollywood studio with dreams of making a name for himself in the film industry. However, he came to see his career in special effects as a dead-end job. His attempts to become an actor were poorly received, but he realized that his expertise in illusions could make him an effective supervillain.

In his first battle with Spider-Man, after he frames him for robbing the Midtown Museum, Mysterio obstructs the hero's [[spider-sense]] with gas and dissolves his webbing with a chemical abrasive. However Spider-Man tricked him into revealing he robbed the museum, then revealed he had captured it on tape. Mysterio was then jailed, blaming Spider-Man for his ruined career.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #13</ref> He later joins the [[Sinister Six]] in an attempt at revenge on Spider-Man, and battles him using robots of the [[X-Men]]. After this Spider-Man gets a card that enables him to go on to battle [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #1</ref>

Mysterio later creates the alias of world-renowned psychiatrist '''Dr. Ludwig Rinehart''', using technology and [[hypnosis]] in an attempt to make Spider-Man lose his mind, and nearly convincing him to unmask, though ironically Spider-Man was helped by [[J. Jonah Jameson]] suddenly bursting into the house. Spider-Man then unmasked Mysterio.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #24</ref> Mysterio then establishes a brief partnership with the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]] in a plot to kill Spider-Man and the [[Human Torch]] on a Hollywood movie set by pretending to enroll them in a film. However they were both defeated and arrested.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #4</ref> He threatens to destroy the city while on TV, and goes on to convince Spider-Man he is {{convert|6|in|mm}} tall using a post-hypnotic suggestion and a miniature funfair, but Spider-Man sees through the illusion and captures Mysterio yet again.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #66-67</ref>

While Beck is incarcerated, his cellmate Daniel Berkhart briefly becomes Mysterio on the original's behalf.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #141</ref> Out of prison, Beck resumes his Ludwig Rinehart identity to manipulate Spider-Man's [[Aunt May]] into revealing the whereabouts of a lost fortune hidden in her house.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #198-199</ref> Beck used bogus alien disguises to frighten May Parker into revealing the location of the fortune, but then learned that the money had long ago been eaten by [[silverfish]].<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #50-51</ref> In his next appearance, Mysterio tricks Spider-Man into believing that he had caused the death of a bystander.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #311</ref> Mysterio then attempts to scare the tenants from an apartment complex in real estate thwarted by the preteen superhero team, [[Power Pack]],<ref>''Power Pack'' #55</ref> much to his later humiliation. He is recruited by [[Doctor Octopus]] to form the second Sinister Six, and battles Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #335-339</ref>

In other encounters, Mysterio has faked the death of Spider-Man's [[Aunt May]],{{issue|date=March 2012}} and made deals with demons from [[Otherplace|Limbo]].{{issue|date=March 2012}} Despite this, however, Mysterio was constantly beaten by Spider-Man and usually arrested. He joined Doctor Octopus' Sinister Six on several occasions, but this never gave him the edge against his foe that he desired. Eventually, he began to lose credibility as a supervillain, with his defeat at the hands of Power Pack being a particularly humiliating moment.{{issue|date=March 2012}} Mysterio was also one of the villains present on [[Ryker's Island]] during [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]] and [[Shriek (comics)|Shriek]]'s takeover. He attempted to drive Spider-Man insane with his hallucinations, but was brutally beaten and nearly killed by the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]].{{issue|date=March 2012}}

After his final imprisonment during the ''[[Guardian Devil]]'' storyline, Mysterio was given an early release, as he had been diagnosed with a [[brain tumor]] and [[lung cancer]], both caused by the chemicals and radiation from his equipment. He was given one year to live, but this imminent death caused prison psychiatrists to grant him early release.{{issue|date=July 2012}} Obsessed with exacting his final revenge on Spider-Man, he was disappointed when he deduced from newspaper articles that the current Spider-Man was just a [[Ben Reilly|clone]], and saw no dignity in overpowering a 'copy' of the real thing (even though by then, the clone had been killed, and the current Spider-Man was indeed the original).{{issue|date=July 2012}} Mysterio decided to change his plan and focus on [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], whom he had encountered recently during an insurance scam that the hero had thwarted; Mysterio believed that he had found a 'kindred spirit' in Daredevil, in the sense that both were second stringers with little reputation outside their homes.{{issue|date=July 2012}}

After the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] gave Mysterio all the information he possessed about Daredevil's past, Mysterio developed an elaborate plot to drive Daredevil insane using a special designed drug.{{issue|date=July 2012}} Daredevil was nearly manipulated into killing an innocent baby (falsely accused of being the [[Antichrist]]),{{issue|date=July 2012}} [[Karen Page]] was killed by [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] after Mysterio had convinced her that she was suffering from [[HIV]] due to her time as a [[pornographic actor|porn star]],{{issue|date=July 2012}} Matt Murdock's partner [[Foggy Nelson]] was framed for murder after cheating on his current lover,{{issue|date=July 2012}} and Daredevil nearly lost his mind as he appeared to be tormented by the forces of Hell.{{issue|date=July 2012}}

However, Daredevil's will proved stronger than Mysterio expected, and once [[Doctor Strange]] discovers and magically removed the drug from Daredevil's blood stream, Daredevil unmasked Mysterio as the mastermind, shattering the villain's helmet in fury and revealing his now languishing appearance. Beck had thought Daredevil would kill him upon discovery, which in his eyes, was a "grand way to end his final show". Daredevil denied him this and instead dismiss Mysterio's scheme as a basic 'B-Movie' plot and calling Mysterio a 'human xerox', incapable of having an original thought in his life; if nothing else, the Kingpin had already attempted to drive Daredevil insane, and he had used the 'supernatural intruding on our world' idea in a previous attack on [[J. Jonah Jameson]]. Broken in every sense of the word, Mysterio, saying he was stealing an idea from [[Kraven the Hunter]], pulled out a gun and shot himself dead. While Mysterio has faked his own death several times in the past, this act was legitimate, as Mysterio had nothing left to live for.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #1-7</ref>

Sometime later, Quentin Beck suddenly appears alive in the school auditorium in a dark red version of his costume and confronts Klum before leaving him for Berkhart to deal with. Quentin Beck then confronts [[Miss Arrow]], revealing that half his head is missing from the gunshot wound, and explains that, having gone to Hell for suicide, his "superiors" in the afterlife sent him back to Earth to maintain a cosmic balance. His superiors want Spider-Man to continue working at the school and Beck knows Miss Arrow has a similar role for the "other side".

Berkhart and Klum briefly battle one another before Spider-Man captures Berkhart. While trying to escape, Klum runs into Arrow and tries to take her as a hostage, only to be stabbed by one of her stingers. He then teleports away, badly bleeding.<ref name="FNS-M11"/><ref name="FNS-M12"/><ref name="FNS-M13"/> Neither Berkhart nor Klum have been seen since. Though Berkhart was incarcerated, Klum's status is uncertain.

In ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #581, a flashback shows that prior to his suicide, Beck had been hired by Norman Osborn to fake his son Harry's death.

[[Image:Spider-Man Enter-the-Gauntlet Mysterio.jpg|145px|Mysterio returns in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' Art by [[Marcos Martin]].|right|thumb]]
Mysterio reappears during ''[[The Gauntlet and Grim Hunt|The Gauntlet]]'' storyline in Amazing Spider-Man, which re-introduces several past Spider-Man villains with new twists. This Mysterio claims to be a returned Quentin Beck who had faked his death, though it's unclear how this fits in with his aforementioned appearance. He is under the employ of Maggia crime member Carmine, creating androids of various deceased Maggia (including their dead leader [[Silvermane]]) to give them a credibility boost in their gang war with [[Mister Negative]]. Beck controls the Silvermane robot himself and plants seeds of rebellion in [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]], who had left the Maggia under the belief that Silvermane was deceased. He also tries to drive Spider-Man mad by making him think he's accidentally killed several gang members, while trying to convince him that a returning [[George Stacy|Captain George Stacy]], who claims to have always been the gangster known as The [[Big Man]], also faked his death years earlier. This turn makes Spider-Man realize that Mysterio must be behind the recent mysterious return of so many deceased individuals, and he vows to have Mysterio pay for making it personal. Shortly after, Mysterio uses the Silvermane robot to murder Carmine in an attempt to secretly seize control of the Maggia and its fortune. Spider-Man eventually exposes and confronts Mysterio, who flees. He later runs into [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]], who tells him that he has some friends who are "dying" to meet him.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #618-620</ref>

The "friends" Chameleon was talking about happens to be the Kravinoffs. He was present at the ritual where Spider-Man is seemingly sacrificed in order to revive [[Kraven the Hunter]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #635</ref>

During the ''Origin of the Species'' storyline, Mysterio is among the supervillains invited by Doctor Octopus to join his villains' team where he is promised that he will receive a reward.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #642</ref> Mysterio went after Spider-Man for [[Menace (Marvel Comics)|Menace]]'s infant. He manages to trick Spider-Man into giving him the child by projecting an image of Avengers' Mansion, and uses his illusions to try to frighten Spider-Man. Ultimately, Spider-Man recovers the baby from Mysterio after figuring out the villain's involvement.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #644</ref>

Mysterio is next seen as part of the new Sinister Six organized by Doctor Octopus. He first works with Chameleon to distract Spider-Man and the Future Foundation, faking an attack in the Caribbean by zombie pirates while the rest of the Six steal something from the Fantastic Four's headquarters.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #659-660</ref> He also participates in an attack by the Six on the [[Avengers Academy]].<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #14</ref> When the Sinister Six launch an attack on the [[Intelligencia (comics)|Intelligencia]] and their new doomsday weapon, Mysterio is responsible for taking down the [[Red Ghost]] and his Super-Apes.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #676</ref>

Doctor Octopus and Mysterio later coordinate the Octobots that have infiltrated the Apogee 1 Space Station. When Mysterio notices that some of the Octobots were disabled, Doctor Octopus orders the Octobots to finish their mission and then destroy the space station. Spider-Man, Human Torch, and [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]] later discover that some of the space station's crew members have been taken over by the Octobots making them Octobot-controlled Zombies that obey Doctor Octopus' commands.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #680</ref> While in their undersea base, Doctor Octopus and Mysterio discover that their Octobot-controlled zombies have passed out. After Apogee 1 Space Station is destroyed and the crew is evacuated by Spider-Man, Human Torch, and John Jameson, Doctor Octopus tells the rest of his Sinister Six that his master plan is about to begin.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #681</ref>

Although Mysterio aids Doctor Octopus in his attack against the Avengers and his plan to 'heal' the world during the ''[[Ends of the Earth (Marvel Comics)|Ends of the Earth]]'' storyline, he agrees to help Spider-Man, [[Silver Sable]] and [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] defeat Doctor Octopus's plans after Spider-Man convinces him that Doctor Octopus won't honor any deal he has made with the Six as he will almost certainly scorch Earth if his plan succeeds. Mysterio leads Spider-Man and his allies to a Mayan temple where Doctor Octopus's base is located (claiming that he was responsible for the choice of location due to the [[2012 Doomsday Prophecy|supposed Mayan prophecies of the world ending in 2012]]), leaving them to face the mind-controlled Avengers.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #686</ref> After disabling the Octobots that were controlling the Avengers, Mysterio lends Spider-Man and Silver Sable his vehicle and provides them with the location of Dr. Octopus' base. He then disappears in a cloud of smoke and leaves the heroes to deal with Octavius.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #687</ref>

During the ''[[Spider-Men]]'' storyline, Mysterio has crossed over to the [[Ultimate Marvel Universe]] multiple times only to encounter the mainstream Spider-Man after his last travel. In the struggle, Spider-Man is transported to the Ultimate Universe, where Mysterio reveals that his Ultimate counterpart is simply a [[Life Model Decoy|robotic avatar]] controlled remotely.<ref>''Spider-Men'' #1</ref> Refusing to allow Spider-Man to escape, Mysterio sends a robot avatar after Peter and [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|the new Spider-Man]].<ref>''Spider-Men'' #2</ref> Despite using chemical weapons to create the hallucination that both Spider-Men are fighting an army of their greatest foes, Peter's greater experience allows him to focus through Mysterio's illusions and destroy the avatar. Mysterio subsequently departs, reflecting that it is more appropriate to leave Spider-Man trapped in a world where he is dead, leaving [[Ultimate Iron Man (character)|Iron Man]] to examine his discarded technology.<ref>''Spider-Men'' #3</ref> Mysterio is preparing to cement his victory by destroying the portal and trapping Spider-Man in the Ultimate universe forever. But unable to resist the temptation to see how his enemy is faring, he keeps the portal open long enough for Peter and the Ultimates to capture him. Despite his best efforts to throw them off with their worst fears, Mysterio is quickly defeated. Fury decides to keep him prisoner in the Ultimate universe due to his knowledge of Peter's secret identity.<ref name="Men4">''Spider-Men'' #4</ref>

Someone claiming to be Mysterio appeared later with the revised [[Sinister Six]], making references to his 'death', stating how after fighting Daredevil he had exited in a 'most spectacular fashion'.{{issue|date=February 2013}} There was some confusion to this Mysterio's identity until ''Spider-Man: The Mysterio Manifesto'' hinted that it was '''Daniel Berkhart''', an old friend of Beck and a previous [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)#Mad Jack(s)|Jack-O-Lantern]] who had taken over the mantle of Mysterio during a period when Beck had previously faked his death, and has reassumed it after Beck's death.{{issue|date=February 2013}} This issue was not addressed again until a Mysterio briefly fought Spider-Man and was captured.<ref>''[[Spider-Man Unlimited (comics)|Spider-Man Unlimited]]'' vol. 3 #7</ref> Berkhart was later confirmed to be this second Mysterio by Quentin Beck.<ref name="FNS-M12">''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' #12</ref>

'''Francis Klum''' was sexually abused by his older brother Garrison (Mr. Brownstone) and forced to use his powers to assist Garrison's illegal activity as a heroin dealer. Determined not to let his older brother sexually assault anyone else, Francis teleported within and exploded Garrison's body before Garrison could rape the [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]], whom he had dosed with heroin.<ref name="SMBC4">''Spider-Man/Black Cat: Evil That Men Do'' #4</ref>

Eventually learning the details of Francis' abusive relationship with Garrison and his role in his brother's death, Felicia nearly convinced Francis to turn himself into the authorities; but [[Spider-Man]], believing that Francis was trying to throw the Cat from the bridge on which they were talking, brutally attacked Klum. Believing that Felicia set him up, he fell from the bridge, teleported in mid-fall and sustained severe physical injuries, losing his left leg below the knee.<ref>''Spider-Man/Black Cat: Evil That Men Do'' #6</ref>

Hungry for revenge against Spider-Man, he contacted the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] and purchased the paraphernalia of the currently-deceased Mysterio (Quentin Beck). He reasoned that by using an old enemy's costume, he could put Spider-Man off-guard; Spider-Man would assume he knew what he was dealing with until Klum demonstrated his powers and it was too late for the wall-crawler to do anything about it.<ref name="FNS-M11">''[[Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man]]'' #11</ref>

However, Klum's plans to kill Spider-Man at Midtown High were interrupted when he was stabbed in the chest by school nurse [[Miss Arrow]]'s stingers after an altercation with the two other Mysterios (Quentin Beck having returned from death).<ref name="FNS-M12"/> Klum teleported to safety, although Arrow (who was later revealed to be Ero, a being composed of hundreds of spiders) would later state that her stingers were fatal to anyone except Spider-Man.<ref name="FNS-M13">''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' #13</ref> Klum has not been seen since.

===Mysterion===
An unknown African-American individual purchases the suit and alter ego of Mysterio from [[Roderick Kingsley]] and calls himself Mysterion. He fights the [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] (Doctor Octopus's mind in Spider-Man's body) and [[Punisher]]. While keeping Punisher from killing Mysterion, Superior Spider-Man captures Mysterion and places him in containment with Sandman, Electro, and Chameleon in his hidden underwater lab.<ref>''[[Avenging Spider-Man]]'' #22</ref>

==Powers, abilities, and equipment==
Quentin Beck does not possess superhuman abilities but he is an expert designer of special effects devices and stage illusions, a master [[hypnosis|hypnotist]] and [[Magic (illusion)|magician]], and an amateur chemist and [[roboticist]]. He had extensive knowledge of hand-to-hand combat techniques learned as a stuntman, allowing him to engage in combat with Spider-Man despite his foe's superior physical abilities. Mysterio's suit has personal weaponry which include many devices that aid him in his many agendas. His most striking feature, his helmet, is made of a one way plexiglass material, meaning he can see out but no one can see in. The helmet also includes an air supply to protect him from his own gasses, a Sonar to navigate within his own mist cloak and a [[holography|holographic]] projector to aid in 3D illusions that can be used to fool the weak willed. His boots contain magnetic coil springs which allow him impressive leaps as well as the ability to cling to surfaces. His most distinctive and persistent trademark however is his smokescreen cloak. Mysterio's costume contains nozzles in the boots and wrists that can release a constant stream of smoke, that shields his movements as well as enhancing his mystique. He can mix various other chemicals into this smokescreen for various effects. Such chemicals include; a gas that dulls and inhibits Spider-Man's spider-sense, a gas that causes paralysis for 30 minutes in those that breathe it in, a chemical abrasive that eats away Spider-Man's webbing, hypnogens that make those around him more susceptible to his will and hallucinogens to cause vivid hallucinations in those who experience it. A combination of the hypnogens and hallucinogens along with his holographic projectors are how Mysterio achieves most of his illusions. The costume sometimes also includes offensive weaponry, such as lasers or knockout gas nozzles in eye emblems on his shoulders, or electric coils within his cape to electrocute those who touch it. He also employs many different weapons, such as hand-held hypnotic aids or robotic drones, to further his aims in battle.

Francis Klum is a mutant with the ability to control people's bodies to do anything he wants them to without actually controlling their minds. He is also a long-range teleporter who can teleport his body to other locations, as well as other objects to and from his present location. His costume features an electrically-charged cloak, boots with magnetic plate springs and mechanical smoke ejectors that produce a concealing mist, and gloves which emit a web-dissolving acid spray and electric bolts. He is self-educated in the use of mechanical/visual special effects and illusion. Klum has an artificial leg.<ref name="SMBC4"/> It has been confirmed that Francis kept his powers after [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].<ref name="FNS-M11"/>

* Mysterio appears in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' voiced by [[Xander Berkeley]]. In the episode "Persona", Quentin Beck is one of the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]]'s henchmen alongside Phineas Mason. After Chameleon impersonates Spider-Man, using Beck's special effects tech, and goes on a crime spree, the group are taken down by the real Spider-Man and the [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]]. Quentin takes on the Mysterio identity in the season two episode "Blueprints". He steals tech from Tricorp and Oscorp, pretending to be a sorcerer "saving" man kind from technology. He defeats Spider-Man twice but Spidey discovers his lair and defeats him after realising that he does not use magic but technology and illusions, the tech itself is not a threat while the illusions could not fool Spider-Man's spider sense. Mysterio is seemingly taken to jail, but in the end, it is revealed it was actually a [[robot]] made in Beck's image; when asked why he did this he stated that he did not want anyone else taking the credit for his performance as Mysterio. The real Mysterio is also revealed to be working with the Tinkerer for the enigmatic Master Planner. He returns in the episode "Reinforcement" as part of the new Sinister Six. He attacks Spider-Man alongside Kraven the Hunter, and the trio end up in a mall. He does not really fight, but helps Kraven the Hunter with robot duplicates of himself. When Kraven is defeated by one of the exploding robots, Mysterio tries to escape but is stopped by Spidey's web fluid whom made sure that Mysterio was not a robot this time. After unmasking him, Spider-Man questions Quentin Beck about who the Master Planner is. He is arrested by the police, while the others villains were extracted by the [[Tinkerer]]. In the episode "Identity Crisis", reporter [[Ned Leeds|Ned Lee]] is interviewing Beck when Peter Parker was rumored to be Spider-Man. Beck states that he hopes that Parker is Spider-Man and that a lot of people in the [[prison]] would know what to do with that info. In the episode "Opening Night", however, it is revealed that the Quentin that was imprisoned in the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]] was actually a [[robot]] that can switch between Quentin and Mysterio (since [[Montana (comics)|Montana]] ([[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]]) knew how to do this which implies that the two were in an alliance). The robotic Mysterio aides the other villains in the Vault in fighting Spider-Man, but is accidentally destroyed by [[Molten Man]]. The real Quentin's whereabouts remain unrevealed.
