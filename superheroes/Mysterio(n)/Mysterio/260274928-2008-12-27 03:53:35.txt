'''Mysterio''' is the name of three [[fictional characters]] that appear in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The original Mysterio was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]] and [[first appearance|first appears]] in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #13, although it was later [[retroactive continuity|retconned]] that the aliens seen in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #2 had been Mysterio and his men in disguise; it was revealed that he had been hired by the [[Tinkerer]] to disguise himself as an extraterrestrial and uncover military and industrial secrets.  <ref> {{Cite comic

==Fictional character biography==
===Quentin Beck===
Quentin Beck was born in [[Riverside, California]].  Before becoming Mysterio, Beck was a [[special effect]]s wizard and stunt man who worked for a major Hollywood studio and had dreams to make a name for himself in the film industry. However, he lacked the looks and talent to be a star and the patience to be a director, and saw his career in special effects to be a dead-end job. When a friend jokingly suggested that the quickest way to become famous is to take out a costumed hero, Beck realized that his expertise in illusions could make him an effective supervillain. Choosing [[Spider-Man]], a relatively weak and inexperienced target, Beck prepared his resources for a few months before attempting to eliminate the wall-crawler. Mysterio, his chosen identity, became one of Spider-Man's most elusive and persistent foes.

Mysterio showed his full range of talents in his first battle with Spider-Man, fogging the hero's [[Spider-Man's powers and equipment#Spider-sense|Spider-Sense]] with a special gas and dissolving his webbing with a chemical abrasive.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #13</ref> He later joined the original [[Sinister Six]] in a failed attempt at revenge on Spider-Man.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #1</ref> Mysterio created the alias of world-renowned psychiatrist Dr. Ludwig Rinehart and used technology and [[hypnosis]] in an attempt to convince Spider-Man that he was losing his mind.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #24</ref> Mysterio later established a brief partnership with the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]] in a failed plot to kill Spider-Man and the [[Human Torch]] on a Hollywood movie set.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #4</ref> He convinced Spider-Man into believing he was 6 inches tall using a post-hypnotic suggestion.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #66-67</ref>

Some time later, Beck's cellmate [[#Daniel Berkhart|Daniel Berkhart]] briefly became the new Mysterio on the original's behalf.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #141</ref> Much later, Beck resumed his Ludwig Rinehart identity to manipulate Spider-Man's [[Aunt May]] into revealing the whereabouts of a supposed fortune hidden in her house.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #198-199</ref> Beck used bogus alien disguises to frighten May Parker into revealing the location of the fortune, but then learned that the money had long ago been eaten by [[silverfish]].<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #50-51</ref> Some time later, Mysterio tricked Spider-Man into believing that he had caused the death of a bystander.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #311</ref> Mysterio then attempts to scare the tenants from an apartment complex in real estate thwarted by the preteen superhero team, [[Power Pack]].<ref>''Power Pack'' #55</ref> He was recruited by [[Doctor Octopus]] to form the second Sinister Six, and battled Spider-Man.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #335-339</ref>

In other encounters, Mysterio has faked the death of Spider-Man's [[Aunt May]], and made deals with demons from [[Otherplace|Limbo]]. Despite this, however, Mysterio was constantly beaten by Spider-Man and usually arrested. He joined Doctor Octopus' Sinister Six on several occasions, but this never gave him the edge against his foe that he desired.  Eventually, he began to lose credibility as a supervillain with his defeat at the hands of Power Pack, being a particularly humiliating moment.

After his final imprisonment, Mysterio was given an early release, as he had been diagnosed with a [[brain tumor]] and [[lung cancer]], both caused by the chemicals and radiation from his equipment. He was given one year to live. Obsessed with enacting his final revenge on Spider-Man, he was disappointed when he deduced from newspaper articles that the current Spider-Man was just a [[Ben Reilly|clone]], and saw no dignity in overpowering a 'copy' of the real thing (even though by then, the clone had been killed, and the current Spider-Man was indeed the original). Mysterio decided to change his plan and focus on [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], who he had encountered recently during an insurance scam that the Man Without Fear had thwarted; he believed that he had found a 'kindred spirit' in Daredevil, in the sense that both were second stringers with little reputation outside their homes. 

After the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] gave Mysterio all the information he possessed about Daredevil's past, Mysterio developed an elaborate plot to drive Daredevil insane. Daredevil was nearly manipulated into killing an innocent baby (falsely accused of being the [[Antichrist]]), [[Karen Page]] was killed by [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] after Mysterio had convinced her that she was suffering from [[HIV]] due to her time as a [[pornographic actor|porn star]], Matt Murdock's partner [[Foggy Nelson]] was framed for murder after cheating on his current lover, and Daredevil nearly lost his mind as he appeared to be tormented by the forces of Hell. 

However, Daredevil's will proved stronger than Mysterio expected, and he unmasked Mysterio as the mastermind, shattering the villain's helmet in fury and revealing his now languishing appearance. Beck had thought Daredevil would kill him upon discovery, which in his eyes, was a "grand way to end his final show". Daredevil denied him this and instead verbally abused Mysterio's plot and very existence, dismissing Mysterio's scheme as a basic 'B-Movie' plot and calling Mysterio a 'human xerox', incapable of having an original thought in his life; if nothing else, the Kingpin had already attempted to drive Daredevil insane, and he had used the 'supernatural intruding on our world' idea in a previous attack on [[J. Jonah Jameson]]. Broken in every sense of the word, Mysterio, saying he was stealing an idea from [[Kraven the Hunter]], pulled out a gun and shot himself dead. While Mysterio has faked his own death several times in the past, this act was legitimate, as Mysterio had nothing left to live for.

===Daniel Berkhart===
[[Image:Mysterio1.jpg|left|185px|thumb|Daniel Berkhart as Mysterio.]]Someone claiming to be Mysterio appeared later with the revised [[Sinister Six]], making references to his 'death', stating how after fighting Daredevil he had exited in a 'most spectacular fashion'. There was some confusion to this Mysterio's identity until ''Spider-Man: The Mysterio Manifesto'' hinted that it was '''Daniel Berkhart''', an old friend of Beck and a previous [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)#Mad Jack(s)|Jack-O-Lantern]] who had taken over the mantle of Mysterio during a period when Beck had previously faked his death, and has reassumed it after Beck's death. This issue was not addressed again until a Mysterio briefly fought Spider-Man and was captured in ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited (comic book)|Spider-Man Unlimited]]'' (Vol. III) #7. In a recent storyline in ''[[Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man]]'' #12, Berkhart was confirmed to be this second Mysterio by [[#Return of Beck|Quentin Beck]].

===Francis Klum===
A teleporting [[mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] named '''[[Mysterio (Francis Klum)|Francis Klum]]''' was seen purchasing Mysterio's costume from the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]], swearing revenge on Spider-Man for the events in ''[[Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil that Men Do|Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil That Men Do]]''. This would make him the third Mysterio, and the first Mysterio to have actual powers instead of using illusions.

===Return of Beck===
[[Image:Mysterio02.png|145px|Mysterio unmasked in ''[[Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man]]'' #12. Art by [[Todd Nauck]].|right|thumb]]
In ''[[Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man]]'' #11, Klum plots to destroy the recently unmasked Spider-Man in revenge for the events that took place in ''[[Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil that Men Do|The Evil That Men Do]]''. Enacting his plot by turning the school Peter Parker worked in into a 'haunted house', Klum fills it with hauntings and death-traps, including luring the children away from Peter's protection. To prevent interference, Klum cordons off the school with a barrier of toxic smoke, which only served as a beacon to Daniel Berkhart, who recognized the trick and was incensed that someone was stealing his Mysterio act. Penetrating the barrier, Berkhart prepares to team up with Spider-Man in order to defeat Klum.

Before the fight began, however, Klum had already encountered a third man in a more radical, purple and red Mysterio costume. Lecturing Klum on the aspects of showmanship, he eventually removes his helmet to reveal that he was apparently Quentin Beck, back from the dead, still with half of his head missing. The full nature of this alleged resurrection has yet to be revealed (although Beck did cryptically state "While I was done with life, it appears life was not yet done with me", implying that the resurrection was not intentional on his part and Beck had meant to stay dead).

In a conversation with [[Miss Arrow]], he revealed that his "bosses" and her "bosses" had further plans for Peter Parker and that she should keep him employed in the school.

==Powers, abilities and equipment==
Quentin Beck was an expert designer of special effects devices and stage illusions, a master [[hypnosis|hypnotist]] and [[Magic (illusion)|magician]], and an amateur chemist and [[roboticist]]. He had extensive knowledge of hand-to-hand combat techniques learned as a stuntman but didn't otherwise possess superhuman abilities. 

Daniel Berkhart, a former friend and protégé of Beck's, presumably has much of the same training and skills that Beck does, though to what extent is unknown.

Francis Klum, having purchased the identity from the Kingpin, has not been identified as having any such training. He is, however, depicted as being at least knowledgeable enough to operate some of the Mysterio equipment and techniques.  Additionally, he has the mutant ability to teleport both himself and other objects, and the ability to control other people's body parts.

Mysterio (in any incarnation) has personal weaponry that includes a one-way plexiglass fishbowl helmet (with 30 minute air supply) with [[holography|holographic]] projector and gloves and boots armed with nozzles which emit [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogenic]] gas. He developed a gas that can cancel Spider-Man's spider-sense, and when he is cloaked in his mist gases, he uses sonar to detect objects and beings nearby. He also has more advanced technology (not of his own design) at his disposal.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Mysterio===
An Ultimate version of Mysterio has introduced in ''Ultimate Spider-Man Annual'' #3.  In his first appearance, he had a police technician to set up surveilance equipments to the police department. However, after NYPD's police captain Frank Quiad asked Spider-Man to aid them to find the crook who somehow able to stay ahead of his unit, [[Mary Jane Watson]], Spider-Man's love interest, figured out how the criminal does it after the hero informed her of the situation. After the police arrested his [[accomplice]],  the villain vowed to get even with Spider-Man and then escapes.      

The character was also alluded to in the "Hollywood" arc of ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' (which poked fun at the ''Spider-Man'' movies) as a villain in a movie about Spider-Man.  It is implied that the actor in the Mysterio costume was [[Bruce Campbell]].{{issue}}
