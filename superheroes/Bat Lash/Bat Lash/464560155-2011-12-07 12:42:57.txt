'''Bartholomew "Bat" Alouysius Lash''' is a fictional [[Western comics|Western]] character in the [[DC Universe]]. A self-professed pacifist, ladies' man, and gambler, Bat Lash's adventures have been published by [[DC Comics]] since 1968.

==Character origin==
In 1968, [[Carmine Infantino]], newly installed Editorial Director of DC Comics, and his editor, [[Joe Orlando]], were looking for something new. Western movies  were popular at the moment, with the [[spaghetti western]]s of [[Clint Eastwood]] breathing new life into a genre that had fallen into disrepute. Western heroes were few in comic books at the time, it was felt they could be revived.

Joe Orlando and Carmine Infantino came up with the name and basic premise of the loner whose family had been wiped out by murderous thugs, and then brought in [[Sheldon Mayer]] (former DC editor and creator of ''[[Sugar and Spike]]'') and [[Sergio Aragonés]] to further flesh out the concept. Shelly Mayer would write the first appearance (''Showcase'' #76). Infantino claimed to have greatly rewritten it. The assignment was then handed to Aragonés, with [[Denny O'Neil]] doing the dialog over Aragonés' plots, and [[Nick Cardy]] providing the art.<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation  | last = Wallace  | first = Dan | author-link =  | contribution = Bat Lash | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 37  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = London  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5}}</ref> As Sergio Aragonés recalled later:

{{cquote|They called me and said 'Sergio, we need a western, we need a cowboy, called Bat Lash. Think about it'. So I did, I thought the character. The way I work, things pop in my head pretty fast, so as I was sitting with them in the restaurant, I was describing how the character was. So Bat Lash was born right there, in the restaurant.... One of the things they wanted, they wanted to be 'different,' a different Western, but they didn't know how, so I came up with a guy that had good taste for food, and music, and loved flowers and nature. And was a crack shot.... But he was no clown. The idea when I wrote it was that he was man with a sense of humor, but he was not a clown. He would do things that will (make) other people become the butt of humor, but not him. The humor should be the result of (Bat Lash's') action.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}}}

==Publication history==
Bat Lash first appeared in 1968, in a house ad running in [[Superman]] [[DC Comics]]. It featured a [[wikt:gangly|gangly]] figure, in silhouette, stalking toward the reader, with the legend, "Bat Lash. Will he save the West, or RUIN it?".

The character's first published story appeared in ''[[Showcase (comic book)|Showcase]]'' #76. It featured a devil-may-care character, a peaceful, violence hating man who attracted trouble wherever he went. He wanted to be left alone ... with the exception of the many females that crossed his path. ''Bat Lash'' the book possessed a sense of humor that has often been compared by fans to the TV series ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'', starring [[James Garner]].

Bat Lash's own series only lasted seven issues. Even though Editorial Director (later Publisher) Infantino claimed it sold well in Europe, sales in the States were not enough to sustain a run of the title.  The character and the series bearing his name have been recognized in the industry, including the 1968 and 1969 [[Alley Awards]] for Best Western Titles.<ref>[http://users.rcn.com/aardy/comics/awards/ Comic Book Awards Almanac].</ref>

Bat Lash made several other appearances after his cancellation in issues of ''[[Weird Western Tales]]'' and other titles. He had a story in ''[[DC Special Series]]'' #16 and a brief backup series in ''Jonah Hex'' #49 & 51-52 in 1981.  He appears in an alternate time-line in ''Justice League Europe'' Annual #2, written in 1991. An older [[Crimson Fox]], through a time travel accident, appears in the middle of a card game, allowing Bat Lash the opportunity to save himself (and her) from Bat's own cheating. During the chase, Bat encounters one 'Miss Sally', who is sad that she has not seen Bat in months.

In 2006, writers [[Jimmy Palmiotti]] and [[Justin Gray]] wrote Lash into ''[[Jonah Hex]]'' #3.  For Halloween 2007 Bat Lash rides with Jonah Hex to save Lazarus Lane the host Body of [[El Diablo (comics)|El Diablo]] in ''Jonah Hex'' #24. He also appears in ''Jonah Hex'' #70.

In 2008, Bat Lash appeared in a new self-titled, six issue mini-series from DC, written by Aragones, with dialog by acclaimed western novelist [[Peter Brandvold]], art by [[John Severin]] and covers by [[Walt Simonson]].  It was reprinted in trade paperback as ''Bat Lash: Guns and Roses'' in 2008.

In the ''Weird Western Tales'' #71 tie-in to the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' crossover, Bat Lash was reanimated as a member of the [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]] along with Black Lantern [[Jonah Hex]] and [[Scalphunter (DC Comics)|Scalphunter]].

*Bat Lash has appeared in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "The Once and Future Thing" voiced by [[Ben Browder]]. He teamed up with [[Pow Wow Smith]], [[El Diablo (comics)|El Diablo]], [[Jonah Hex]], [[Wonder Woman]], [[Batman]], and [[Green Lantern]] ([[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]]) to stop [[Terra-Man|Tobias Manning]]. He is portrayed as easy going and good mannered.  He says Manning cheats at cards. In this incarnation, Lash's dialogue is sprinkled liberally with sage quotes from his father ("My pappy always said...") which, along with his gambling skills and laid-back attitude, refer directly to ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'', the light-hearted Western series which, like ''Justice League Unlimited'', was produced by [[Warner Bros.]]

*During a segment on [[Conan (TV series)|Conan]], [[Conan O'Brien]] discussed with Peter Girardi (Creative Director of [[Warner Bros. Animation]]) characters from DC Comics that sucked. One of the characters discussed was Bat Lash.<ref>http://teamcoco.com/content/conan-gets-animated</ref>
