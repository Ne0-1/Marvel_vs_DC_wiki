==Publication history==
{{expand section|date=September 2015}}
The character has described by Hickman as "Thanos' most favored. Corvus is cruel, arrogant and the most loyal of the Black Order. A warrior who betrayed his people and sold his soul to Thanos to pursue a different kind of glory."<ref name="corvus-cbr">{{cite web |first=Steve |last=Sunu |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=45325 |title=EXCLUSIVE: Introducing the Generals of Marvel's "Infinity" |work=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=May 6, 2013 |accessdate=September 11, 2015 }}</ref>

Editor [[Tom Breevort]] has said:

{{quote|He was the one character among the generals who was designed by Jim, and he was designed by Jim specifically because this story was being done and Jim had to get to him first. In essence, this is no different than any other design challenge. Jonathan laid the particulars of the characters out on the table, Jim went to town and did a few designs — different roughs for the head and so forth. We selected from that and away he went. He's the most prominent of the five lieutenants. He's Thanos' second-in-command and the one who most readily speaks for him, and yet you want him to have a certain amount of visual contrast to Thanos. While Thanos is a fairly big, blocky character and really became that over the years, Corvus — he's not skinny, but he's more slender, more lithe, more wiry — sort of in reflection of the glaive weapon that he carries. He's like the physical personification of that in a sense.<ref name="corvus-cbr" />}}

==Fictional character biography==
Corvus Glaive is one of the [[Black Order (comics)|Black Order]], the first of the five and the most favored by [[Thanos]].<ref>''New Avengers'' Vol. 3 #9</ref> He is the emissary to the worlds Thanos razes and demands tributes in the form of the heads of their children in exchange for leniency. Thanos and his followers learn that the Illuminati possess the [[Infinity Gems]] and that Black Bolt of the Inhumans has knowledge of the whereabouts of Thanos' remaining child [[Thane (comics)|Thane]], and they set forth to invade Earth.<ref>''Infinity'' #1</ref> Corvus Glaive and [[Supergiant (comics)|Supergiant]] lead an attack on the [[X-Mansion|Jean Grey School for Higher Learning]] in search of an Infinity Gem and its holder, during which Corvus grievously injures Wolverine.<ref>''New Avengers'' Vol. 3 #8-9</ref> Corvus later meets with the [[Inhumans]] in [[Attilan]] and demands a tribute, but is rebuffed.<ref>''Infinity'' #2</ref> Corvus, alongside [[Proxima Midnight]] and Supergiant, attack Wakanda in search of the Black Panther, who they believe to be in possession of an Infinity Gem after being misled by Namor. They discover the anti-matter bombs the Illuminati have been building as well their prisoners.<ref>''New Avengers'' Vol.3 #9</ref><ref>''New Avengers'' Vol.3 #11</ref> Corvus and Proxima accompany Thanos to the Inhuman city of Orollan after being informed by Ebony Maw of Thane's capture. As Thanos prepares to finish off Thane, Corvus receives word that their forces are being attacked by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and their interstellar allies.<ref>''Infinity'' #5</ref> A squad of Avengers led by [[Captain America]] confront Thanos, Corvus and Proxima in Orollan. Corvus is seemingly obliterated by [[Hyperion (comics)|Hyperion]] and his glaive was recovered by Promixa. She and Thanos were subsequently placed by his son Thane in a state of "living death", leaving them frozen in amber. They are imprisoned by the Illuminati alongside the [[Black Swan (comics)|Black Swan]] and [[Terrax|Terrax the Truly Enlightened]].<ref>''Infinity'' #6</ref>

Corvus secretly reconstitutes himself with the help of [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus]].<ref>''New Avengers'' Vol. 3 #15</ref><ref>''New Avengers'' Vol. 3 #19</ref> They were later freed by [[Namor]] to form a new [[Cabal (comics)|Cabal]] that he feels could carry out the necessary destruction of worlds that the Illuminati and the other heroes could not do.<ref>''New Avengers'' Vol. 3 #23</ref> The Cabal proceeds to halt multiple Incursions by destroying world after world, but alienate Namor with their penchant for needless slaughter.<ref>''New Avengers'' Vol. 3 #24</ref> As a result, Namor later conspires with the Illuminati and the other heroes in killing the Cabal in the next Incursion by trapping them in the doomed world during its destruction. Black Panther and Black Bolt double-cross Namor and condemn him to death alongside the Cabal.<ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 5 #40</ref> Because the Earth was in an Incursion with two worlds simultaneously, the Cabal with Namor manages to escape into Earth-1610 where they encounter the Maker (that reality's version of [[Mister Fantastic]]).<ref>''Avengers'' Vol. 5 #41</ref>

During the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, the final incursion claims both Earth-616 and Earth-1610 where the Maker and the Cabal escape the destruction using a specially-designed lifeboat, ending up in [[Battleworld]]. Corvus, along with Proxima and Terrax, murder King Thor of the Thor Corps after he opens their raft.<ref>''Secret Wars'' #1-2</ref> The villains proceed to wander aimlessly over the seemingly endless wasteland, at which point Corvus suggests that they split apart in order to cover more ground. They are shortly confronted by a squad of Thor Corps members, the surviving heroes, and Stephen Strange. The fighting is interrupted by the [[Doctor Doom|God Emperor Doom]] who demands their fealty. However, as Doom is soon preoccupied with subduing the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]]-possessed Cyclops, Strange casts a spell that scatters the other heroes and villains into the wind in order to spare them from Doom's wrath.<ref>''Secret Wars'' #3-4</ref> Corvus and Proxima are later captured by Apocalypse and presented before Doom.<ref>''Secret Wars'' #6</ref>
