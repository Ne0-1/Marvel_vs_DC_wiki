The '''Anti-Monitor''' is a [[fiction]]al [[character (arts)|character]], a [[comic book]] [[supervillain]] and the [[antagonist]] of the 1985 [[DC Comics]] [[miniseries]] ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]].'' He first appeared in ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' #2 (although he remained in shadow until ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' #5), and was destroyed in ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' #12, only to return after a long absence in ''Green Lantern: [[Sinestro Corps]] Special'' #1 (Aug. 2007). In 2009, Anti-Monitor was ranked as [[IGN]]'s 49th greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.<ref>[http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/49.html Anti-Monitor is number 49], [[IGN]].</ref>

==Fictional character biography==

===Origins===
The Anti-Monitor is an enemy not only of the [[Green Lantern Corps]], but also of the entire Multiverse. Billions of years ago, on the planet Maltus, there existed a race of blue-skinned and immortal beings later to be called the [[Maltus (comics)|Guardians of the Universe]]. One of these beings, [[Krona (comics)|Krona]], was a scientist obsessed with the origins of the universe, even though a taboo existed amongst his people concerning the viewing of the origins of the universe.

Krona created a machine that allowed him to see into the moment of creation. Somehow, his experiment disrupted the process of creation, with terrible consequences.<ref>{{cite web|title=Krona (DC Comics)|url=http://www.music.us/education/K/Krona-(DC-Comics).htm|publisher=Music Entertainment Network|accessdate=3 July 2012}}</ref> The exact consequences have been rewritten over the years; originally, it was the unleashing of evil itself in the universe;{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} later, it was assumed to be the creation of the evil [[antimatter]] universe of [[Qward]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

During the ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', it was also revealed to be the cause of the existence of all [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universes]] in the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]]; several villains were sent back in time to stop him, but were defeated by Krona and the other Oans.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} In a [[Ganthet|final revision]], it was established that it increased [[entropy]] in the universe, shortening its existence by a [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] years (see [[heat death of the universe|heat death]]).<ref>Green Lantern version 4</ref> In any event, two beings were created, one on the moon of [[Oa]] and the other on the moon of Qward. On the moon of Oa, the being known as the [[Monitor (comics)|Monitor]] was instantly aware of his counterpart, the Anti-Monitor (although his official name is the Monitor (of his universe), and he is often addressed as such, the name Anti-Monitor is used to distinguish him from his heroic positive matter counterpart). By this time the Anti-Monitor had quickly conquered Qward, as well as the rest of the Antimatter universe.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} In searching for other places to conquer, he also became aware of his counterpart. These two beings battled for a million years, unleashing great powers against each other, but to no avail. At the end of their stalemate, they simultaneously attacked one another, rendering both inert for nine billion years.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

In ''Final Crisis'', it was revealed that, in the wake of the birth of the original Multiverse, an unfathomable being of limitless imagination, the original Monitor, or ''Overmonitor'', became aware of the life germinating in the budding Multiverse occupying the void space in which he resided, and which he encompassed. Curious about it, and wanting to interact with and know better the lesser life-forms birthed by the Multiverse, he fashioned a probe, a ''smaller Monitor''. Unprepared to deal with the complexity of life and the passing of time, the probe-Monitor was instantly split into two symmetrical, opposite beings upon coming into contact with the Multiverse itself: the Monitor, embodying the positive matter and ''goodness'', and the Anti-Monitor, embodying anti-matter and ''evil''.<ref>''Final Crisis: Superman Beyond'' #2</ref>

The Anti-Monitor, who appears monstrous, barely resembles the Monitor, who bears a physically near-human appearance. The Anti-Monitor has empty, sometimes luminous eye sockets, and a wide, wrinkled mouth, often mistaken for a mass of teeth. When his armor is destroyed by Supergirl, his form appears not dissimilar to that of the Monitor, but unstable, and surrounded by a coruscating aura of radiant energy - his life force, leaking out like water from a failing vessel, explaining the need for the armor. The Anti-Monitor himself refers to the armor as his "Life Shell".<ref>''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' #7</ref> When the Manhunters re-build his armor, it is revealed his body is little more than a churning mass of energy.<ref>''Tales of the Sinestro Corps: Superman-Prime'' #1 (Dec. 2007)</ref> Much later, when his helmet is disintegrated by Firestorm, the Anti-Monitor's head is revealed to be featureless except for his eyes and mouth.<ref>Brightest Day #22 (2011)</ref>

[[Image:Antimonitorcoie.png|left|195px|thumb|The Anti-Monitor fights heroes from [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|eight Earths]]. Cover to ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' #12. Art by [[George Pérez]].]]
In more modern times, the being known as [[Pariah (comics)|Pariah]] performed an experiment similar to the one Krona attempted long ago on a parallel Earth (this was changed later to an alternate world in the post-''Crisis'' single universe).{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} This experiment resulted in the reawakening of both the Monitor and the Anti-Monitor, and the destruction of Pariah's Earth and his universe.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The Anti-Monitor rebuilt his army, taking over Qward and using the Thunderers as his own private army, as well as creating the Shadow Demons from the elite of the Thunderers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

The Anti-Monitor then released a massive antimatter wave, absorbing the energies of the destroyed positive matter universes and growing stronger even as his counterpart grew weaker, and employed the second [[Psycho-Pirate]], using his emotion control powers to terrorize the populations of the planets he sought to conquer and destroy.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The Monitor, along with his aide [[Harbinger (DC Comics)|Harbinger]], gathered a group of heroes and villains from various alternate universes in order to combat the threat of the Anti-Monitor.<ref>''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' #1</ref> One of Harbinger's duplicates was taken control of by the Anti-Monitor and apparently killed the Monitor.

After defeats from various heroes, including the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] ([[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]]) and [[Supergirl]] sacrificing themselves to destroy an antimatter cannon<ref>''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' #8</ref> and to save [[Superman]]<ref>''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' #7</ref> respectively, the Anti-Monitor absorbed the entirety of the antimatter universe and traveled to the beginning of time, intending to stop the formation of the positive matter Multiverse and to create a Multiverse where antimatter prevailed. When the heroes followed him there, he began to drain the power from most of them.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

However, the actions of the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]], empowered by the sorcerers of the surviving Earths, brought the Anti-Monitor to a stalemate. The villains of said Earths, sent to stop Krona from viewing the origins of the universe, failed due to squabbling, allowing Krona to see the hands of the Anti-Monitor and the Spectre struggling for domination, which collapsed the current Multiverse.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

From the ashes rose a new, singular universe. While various persons adjusted to the newly singular Earth (including those whose worlds and histories had been destroyed with the loss of the Multiverse), the Anti-Monitor, enraged, drew this new Earth into the antimatter universe, intending to destroy this last bastion of positive matter once and for all.<ref>''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' #11</ref> What followed was the Shadow Demon War, wherein many heroes and villains lost their lives against the Anti-Monitor's forces. Finally, the combined efforts of various superheroes and villains, ([[Doctor Light (Kimiyo Hoshi)|Doctor Light]], the heroic Alexander Luthor, Jr. of [[Earth-Three]], [[Darkseid]], [[Superboy-Prime|Superboy]] of [[Earth Prime]], and [[Superman (Earth-Two)|Kal-L]], the [[Superman]] of [[Earth-Two]]), who struck the final blow, destroyed the Anti-Monitor by punching him into a star. The star went nova and caused anti-matter waves to erupt, threatening to destroy the entire antimatter universe. Kal-L and Superboy-Prime were willing to resign themselves to their final fates, when Alexander Luthor, using his power to open dimensions, revealed that he had created a "paradise dimension", and he used it to prevent the [[Lois Lane#Golden Age|Lois Lane Kent]] of Earth-Two from being erased from existence when the post-Crisis universe was formed, as he foresaw how events would unfold and refused to allow Superman to have to deal with such a terrible loss. Using his own body as a portal, Alexander Luthor, Kal-L, and Superboy-Prime went into the "paradise dimension" alongside Lois.<ref>''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' #12</ref>

Among the other beings who died because of his actions were the [[Crime Syndicate of America]]; [[Kid Psycho]]; [[Nighthawk (DC Comics)|Nighthawk]]; the [[Losers (comics)|Losers]]; Flower of [[Easy Company (comics)|Easy Company]]; [[Starman (comics)#Prince Gavyn|Starman]]; the [[Immortal Man]]; [[Hawk and Dove#Hank and Don Hall|Dove]]; [[Kole]]; [[Clayface#Matt Hagen|Clayface]]; [[Bug-Eyed Bandit]]; [[Angle Man]]; [[Prince Ra-Man]]; [[Sunburst (comics)|Sunburst]]; [[Lori Lemaris]]; [[Earth-Two|Earth-2]]'s [[Green Arrow]], [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|Huntress]], and [[Alternative versions of Robin#Dick Grayson (Earth Two)|Robin]]; and [[Alternative versions of Lex Luthor#Earth-Three|Alexander Luthor, Sr.]] of Earth-Three just to name a few.

===''Infinite Crisis''===
{{main|Infinite Crisis}}
[[Image:Crisistower.jpg|The Anti-Monitor's corpse turned into a tower. Panel from ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' #3 (February 2006).<br>Art by [[Phil Jimenez]].|185px|thumb]]
The Superman (and Lois Lane) of Earth-Two, Superboy of Earth-Prime, and [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]] of Earth-Three, from their home in the hidden pocket universe, were revealed to be observing the events of the newly formed universe as well as the actions of its heroes. Upon observing the events leading up to ''Infinite Crisis'', the heroes returned to the universe in an attempt to restore Earth-Two's existence, at the expense of Earth-One.<ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #2</ref>

The Anti-Monitor's remains were then used as part of a tuning fork, similar to the ones used during the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|first Crisis]]. This construct then created the vibrational frequency that Earth-Two was on prior to its nonexistence, which in turn recreated Earth-Two with no visible expense to Earth-One, save the movement of characters who originated on Earth-Two to the recreated Earth-Two.<ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #4</ref> Alexander Luthor then recreated the other Earths with his tuning fork, with their respective heroes forcibly migrating to said Earths.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Superboy-Prime (followed soon by Bart Allen) then returned from the [[Speed Force]] wearing what appeared to be select elements of the Anti-Monitor's armor, using it as a yellow sunlight collector.<ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #5</ref> Ultimately, the tower was destroyed when [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Kon-El]], the modern Superboy, and Superboy-Prime crashed into it while fighting each other; Kon-El died in the arms of [[Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark)|Wonder Girl]] as Superboy-Prime fled.<ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #6</ref>

===Post-Crisis Impact===
Despite his extremely limited exposure (he only appeared in the ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' mini-series, a single issue of ''[[Wonder Woman]]'',{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} and ''Flash'' (vol. 2) #149-150),{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} the Anti-Monitor was responsible for one of the most profound changes in the entire history of DC Comics, the DC Universe, and all of its parallel universes. The anti-matter universe still existed, now with both Qward (said to be the counterpart of Oa) and an alternate Earth populated by counterparts of the positive matter heroes and villains (each taking the opposite role) known as Earth-2.<ref>''JLA: Earth 2'' Graphic Novel (2000), by [[Grant Morrison]]</ref> 

Perhaps the most notable impact the Anti-Monitor had on the post-''Crisis'' universe was the elimination of the Multiverse aspect of the DC Universe. Previously, there existed an infinite number of Earths, each one with a unique history, that could be accessed through various means, the most common being vibrational attunement. During Post-''Crisis'', with the restart of the universe as one thanks to the machinations of the Anti-Monitor, a simpler, more streamlined DC Universe seemed imminent, with characters acquired from [[Charlton Comics]], [[Fawcett Comics]], and [[Quality Comics]] all becoming incorporated into the new DC Universe.

===Post-''Infinite Crisis''===
[[File:Monitors.png|235px|thumb|left|The Anti-Monitor resemblance seen in the background in ''Brave New World'' #1.<br> Art by [[Ariel Olivetti]].]]
At the end of [[DC Comics]]' 2006 special ''[[One Year Later|Brave New World]]'' it is revealed that there are five figures calling themselves "the [[Monitors (comics)|Monitors]]" watching over the new post-''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' Earth. Four of the figures resemble the original Monitor from ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' and the fifth figure resembles the Anti-Monitor.<ref>''DCU: Brave New World'' #1 (Aug. 2006)</ref> In the pages of ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis|Countdown]]'', it has been revealed that there are fifty-two Monitors, with each of them representing one of the new alternate realities in the new Multiverse, each with a slightly different appearance. A Monitor was shown in ''Supergirl'' recalling Dark Angel, one of his agents. This Monitor was dressed like the Anti-Monitor, but appeared to have no other connection.<ref>''Supergirl'' (vol. 5)  #18 (Aug. 2007)</ref>

===Sinestro Corps===

It was revealed that the Anti-Monitor was reborn following the recreation of the Multiverse and that he had been fueling [[Sinestro]]'s ideology since the return of [[Hal Jordan]], acting as the Sinestro Corps' "Guardian of Fear".<ref>"The Second Rebirth" ''Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps Special'' #1 (Aug. 2007) [[DC Comics]]</ref> His body was rebuilt by the [[Manhunters]], and in addition, he recruited [[Superboy-Prime]], the [[Hank Henshaw|Cyborg Superman]], and [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]], who was using Kyle Rayner as its host, along with Sinestro as his heralds.
<ref>"The Greatest Once, the Greatest Again" ''Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps Special'' #1 [[DC Comics]] (Aug 2007)</ref>

During the war between the Sinestro Corps and the [[Green Lantern Corps]], the Anti-Monitor contacted [[Hank Henshaw|Cyborg Superman]] to inquire about the status of [[Warworld|New Warworld]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The cosmic tyrant stated that he would soon abandon Qward and that he would kill Henshaw for his services, allowing him the peace that had for so long evaded the Cyborg.<ref>" "Green Lantern vol 1, # 22 [[DC Comics]] (October 2007)</ref>

When the Lost Lanterns made their way to the Antimatter universe to save Hal Jordan and the Ion power, they inadvertently stumbled upon the Anti-Monitor in a basement chamber of his stronghold on Qward.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} He was seemingly experimenting on or torturing the [[Ion (comics)|Ion]] entity previously inhabiting [[Kyle Rayner]]. He proceeded to kill [[Ke'Haan]] before the other Lanterns forced him back, taking the Ion entity from the planet and the Antimatter universe.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The Anti-Monitor pursued the Lanterns for a short while, long enough for Hal Jordan, [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]], [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]], and the other Lanterns to learn of his return.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Having this vital information, they then leave Qward.

Shortly after, the Sinestro Corps launched its attack on Earth. The Anti-Monitor traveled to the planet aboard New Warworld, and landed shortly thereafter, along with Sinestro.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} He was attacked by [[Sodam Yat]] and other members of the Green Lantern Corps, but the tyrant killed the two unnamed beings and severely injured the [[Daxam]]ite Lantern.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

The Anti-Monitor began to siphon the positive matter of New York City to create his Antimatter waves. However, he was attacked by the [[Guardians of the Universe]], angry at being impotent during his first war. The Anti-Monitor was able to counter the vicious attack, permanently scarring the face of [[Scar (comics)|Scar]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} John Stewart and Guy Gardner brought down New Warworld and the Yellow Central Power Battery, which were detonated next to the Anti-Monitor, and contained by a shield created by hundreds of Green Lanterns to contain the explosion; even this was not enough to kill him. Superboy-Prime, seeing an opportunity to defeat the now-weakened Anti-Monitor, flew through the Anti-Monitor's chest and hurled his shattered body into space.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

The Anti-Monitor's crash landed on the planet Ryutt in Sector 666,<ref>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #33 (Sept. 2008)</ref> where a [[Nekron|voice]] acknowledged him and told him to rise.  Before he could escape, the Anti-Monitor found himself imprisoned inside a large Black Power Battery.<ref>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #25 (January 2008)</ref> Soon afterwards, the Guardian Scar, corrupted by the Anti-Monitor's energies, dispatched the Green Lanterns [[List of Green Lanterns#Ash|Ash]] and [[List of Green Lanterns#Saarek|Saarek]] to locate and recover the Anti-Monitor's body.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

===Blackest Night===
Green Lanterns Ash and Saarek find the Black Central Power Battery on Ryut and try to escape just before two monstrous hands emerge from below them and drag them into the planet, killing them.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} 

When the Black Central Power Battery is later brought to Earth, the Anti-Monitor stirs within, demanding to be let out. He begins draining the white energies of [[Hawk and Dove|Dove]] in order to effect an escape.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #7 (February 2010)</ref> The Anti-Monitor is revived as a Black Lantern independent from Nekron's control. The Anti-Monitor is attacked by the various Lantern Corps just as he is about to put itself out of the battery. Combining their energies, the various Lantern Corps use Dove as a human bullet shooting the Anti-Monitor through the head and pulling it back into the Battery.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #46 (March 2010)</ref>

The Anti-Monitor is eventually resurrected by a White Power Ring, and breaks free of the battery, fighting Nekron in revenge from imprisoning him. Nekron then banishes the Anti-Monitor back to the Antimatter universe.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #8 (March 2010)</ref>

===Brightest Day===
Later the Anti-Monitor is confronted by the [[White Lantern Corps|White Lantern]] [[Deadman|Boston Brand]].<ref>''Brightest Day'' #2 (July 2010)</ref> As Brand is forced by the White Ring to "fight for his life", damaging the Anti-Monitor's chest plate armor, the Anti-Monitor retaliates by firing a burst of antimatter energy at Brand, who evades the blast. The Anti-Monitor resumes his duties in the Antimatter Universe while Brand leaves.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #3 (August 2010)</ref>
He also prevented Deathstorm, the Black Lantern version of Firestorm, in his attempt to destroy the White Lantern Battery and instead commands him to bring the lantern to him as well as an army, at which point Deathstorm brings back the Black Lantern versions of Professor Zoom, Maxwell Lord, Hawk, Jade, Captain Boomerang, Martian Manhunter, Aquaman, Hawkman, Hawkgirl, Deadman and Osiris.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #11 (October 2010)</ref>

Deathstorm eventually brought the White Lantern Battery to him, and he tried to access the White Lantern power, however his efforts are prevented by Firestorm who after engaging in battle with the Anti-Monitor and the Black Lanterns is able to regain the White Power Battery from the Anti-Monitor. Its also revealed that the "Entity" allowed itself to be captured so it could obtain unspecified information from the Anti-Monitor.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #22</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Anti-Monitor was one of the most formidable foes ever faced by the heroes of the DC Universe (or "[[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]]", as it was then and now). He is directly responsible for more deaths than any other known DC supervillain, having destroyed nearly all of an infinite number of universes.<ref>While the actual number of universes the Anti-Monitor destroyed was not literally infinite, the Monitor did state that "more than three thousand" universes had been lost.</ref> He was powerful enough to kill a distracted [[Supergirl]] almost effortlessly, though it could be suggested that when the universe 'restarted', most of the deaths attributed to him, in effect, never happened. He consumed thousands of positive-matter universes to increase his power, and was able to personally battle scores of the multiverse's strongest heroes simultaneously.

The Anti-Monitor was also responsible for the death of [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]], the hero better known as the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]]. After capturing Barry because his ability to traverse the multiverse unaided made him a dangerous variable, the Anti-Monitor created an Anti-Matter cannon that would destroy the then-five remaining earths with a concentrated beam much faster than the wave of entropy he had originally unleashed. The cannon was destroyed by the Flash when he escaped and forced the energies of the weapon's power source into itself, causing it to explode and Barry to disintegrate. 

In addition to possessing vast size (varying from about nine feet, to hundreds of meters tall), vastly superhuman strength, extraordinary durability (by the end of the ''Crisis'' series he was able to effortlessly withstand blows from [[Superman]], and even surviving a [[Stellar classification#Hot blue emission star classes|blue star]] going [[supernova]]), the ability to project destructive bolts of energy, and greatly augmenting another beings' powers (as he did with [[Psycho-Pirate]], whose powers were increased to levels too much for him to handle), the Anti-Monitor also possessed reality-warping abilities, which he displayed by removing Psycho-Pirate's face. The Anti-Monitor also commanded an army of Qwardians and shadow demons, and had access to highly advanced technology capable of shifting, merging, or destroying entire universes.  

By far, his most devastating power was the ability to absorb the energies of his surroundings into himself, once he fused with his antimatter universe, he went even as far as absorbing the energies of entire universes.  In addition to devouring the energies of untold numbers of universes, he also absorbed the energy of "over one million worlds" in his own anti-matter universe in order to gain the power to travel to the beginning of time, to attempt to stop the creation of the positive matter universe.  When Earth's heroes followed him to the beginning of time, he then absorbed all of their power and energy; this made him strong enough to alter the creation of the universe until he was opposed by the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]].  During his final battle in ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' #12, the Anti-Monitor maintained his power by "feeding on" a nearby star; and when his power was drained and he was reduced to a state of near-death, he absorbed his own anti-matter demons to rejuvenate himself.

The Anti-Monitor is not immortal, but may be ultimately indestructible so long as the anti-matter universe exists; having been destroyed with immense effort at the end of the Crisis, he was recreated by his universe, just as he had been formed originally.

==Other versions==
* In the "Chain Lightning" arc of the Flash comics,<ref>''Flash'' (vol. 3) #145-150 (February–July 1999)</ref> history is altered when Barry Allen is killed before the events of ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''. This forces [[Wally West]] into a timeline where the Anti-Monitor was never defeated and only the Antimatter Universe remains.
* A parody of the Anti-Monitor, called the "Aunty Monitor", appeared in [[Marvel Comics]]' ''What The--?!'' satire comic.<ref>''What The--?!'' #2 (September 1988)</ref> Marvel's ''[[Mighty Mouse]]'' comic featured another parody, the "Anti-[[Minotaur]]".<ref>''Mighty Mouse'' #4-5 (Jan-Feb. 1991)</ref>
* The Anti-Monitor makes a cameo appearance in ''[[DC animated universe (comics)#Justice League Adventures/Justice League Unlimited|Justice League Unlimited]]'' #32 (June 2007). He is described by [[Darkseid]] to be a "celestial being composed of negative energy" which Darkseid sought to gain to fuel the [[Anti-Life Equation]].
* The Monitor and Anti-Monitor both appear in ''[[Tiny Titans]]'' #12 (March 2009), with the Monitor telling [[Dick Grayson|Robin]] that he needs a hall pass, and the Anti-Monitor contradicting him because he is the "Anti" Monitor, until the two start having a "do not, do too" argument, and the Monitor says that everyone likes the Anti-Monitor better.

==In other media==

===Television===
* The Anti-Monitor appears as the main villain of the second story arc of ''[[Green Lantern: The Animated Series]]'',<ref>http://www.comicbookmovie.com/fansites/Jolt17/news/?a=63945&channelId=d57bac34ce3a47b4a7bcdf176c80196b&channelListId&mediaId=216bd44668ec47b1b6d1d10ba2f81901</ref> voiced by [[Tom Kenny]].<ref>"http://www.eldoblaje.com/datos/FichaPeliculaES.asp?id=25305</ref> The animated version of the Anti-Monitor features a more machine-like face, with glowing blue eyes and a flat surface where the mouth is. He is first shown in "The New Guy" entering the show's universe by splitting open the fabric of space and then heading down to a nearby junkyard planet, destroying one of many automated security ships which tells him otherwise before declaring to several defunct Manhunters that he is their new master before unleashing a signal that reactivates all Manhunters across space for his own motives. The heroes engage him in the second episode of the arc, where he is shown as a giant, stating he consumed the planets of his universe and hungers for more. He shrugged off the most powerful attacks of both the Lanterns and their starship. The episode ends with him hitting Hal Jordan with an energy attack, and blasting him through a [[dimensional rift]]. The next episode reveals he was blasted into Anti-Monitor's original universe, completely empty except for a single planet which was spared in return for sending Anti-Monitor into a new universe for him to consume. His portrayal as a being who devours planets for nourishment is similar to [[Unicron]] and [[Galactus]].
