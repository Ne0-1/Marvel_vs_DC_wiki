The '''Anti-Monitor''' is the arch-villain in the [[DC Comics]] mini-series ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''.  The Anti-Monitor lives in an [[antimatter]] universe.  Of course, being a comic book the antimatter physics are not perfect.  But the author, [[Marv Wolfman]] used the idea that when antimatter and matter reacted they annihilated each other.
