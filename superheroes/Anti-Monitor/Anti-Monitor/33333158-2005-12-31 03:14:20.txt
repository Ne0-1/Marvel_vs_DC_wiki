==History==
Billions of years ago, on the planet [[Oa]], there existed a race of beings, blue-skinned and immortal. One of these beings, [[Krona (comics)|Krona]], was a scientist obsessed with the origins of the universe, even though a taboo existed amongst the ancient Oans concerning the viewing of the origins of the universe. Krona created a machine that allowed him to see into the moment of creation. Somehow, his experiment disrupted the process of creation, with terrible consequences. The exact consequences have been rewritten over the years; originally, it was the unleashing of evil itself in the universe; later, it was assumed to be the creation of the evil [[anti-matter]] universe of [[Qward]]. During the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]], it was also revealed to be the cause of the existence of all [[parallel universe]]s in the DC [[multiverse]]; several villains were sent back in time to stop him, but were defeated by Krona and the other Oans. In a final revision, it was established that it increased [[entropy]] in the universe, shortening its existence by a [[billion]] years (see [[heat death]]). In any event, two beings were created on both the moon of Oa and the moon of Qward. On the moon of Oa, the being known as the Monitor was instantly aware of his counterpart, the Anti-Monitor (although his official name is the Monitor, and is addressed as such, the name Anti-Monitor is used to distinguish him from his heroic postive matter counterpart). The two beings battled for a million years, unleashing great powers against each other, but to no avail. At the end of their stalemate, the two beings rendered each other inert for nine million years.

In more modern times, the alien being known as [[Pariah (comics)|Pariah]] performed an experiment similar to the one Krona attempted long ago. The end result was the reawakening of both the Monitor and the Anti-Monitor, and the destruction of Pariah's home planet. The Anti-Monitor rebuilt his army, taking over Qward and using the Thunderers as his own private army, as well as creating the Shadow Demons from the Thunderers. He then released a massive anti-matter wave, absorbing the energies of the destroyed positive matter universes. The Anti-Monitor also employed the second Psycho Pirate, using his emotion control powers to terrorize the populations of the planets he sought to conquer and destroy. The Monitor, along with his aide [[Harbinger (DC comics)|Harbinger]], gathered a group of heroes from various alternate universes in order to combat the threat of the Anti-Monitor.

After defeats from various heroes, including heroic sacrifices from both [[Barry Allen|the Flash (Barry Allen)]] and [[Supergirl]], the Anti-Monitor absorbed the entirety of the anti-matter universe and travelled to the beginning of time, intending to stop the formation of the positive matter multiverse and to create a multiverse where anti-matter prevails. However, the actions of the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]], backed by the heroes of all the remaining Earths, brought the Anti-Monitor to a stalemate. The villains of said Earths, sent to stop Krona from viewing the origins of the universe, failed, allowing Krona to see the hand of the Anti-Monitor rising from the darkness, which shattered the current multiverse.

From the ashes rose a new, singular universe. While various persons adjusted to the newly singular Earth, the Anti-Monitor, enraged, drew this new Earth into the anti-matter universe, intending to destroy this last bastion of postive matter once and for all. What followed was the Shadow Demon War, wherein many heroes and villains lost their lives against the Anti-Monitor's forces. Finally, the combined efforts of various superheroes, [[Doctor Light (DC Comics superheroine)|Doctor Light]], the heroic Alexander Luthor, Jr. of Earth-3, [[Darkseid]], [[Superboy]] of Earth-Prime, and Kal-L, the [[Superman]] of Earth-2 destroyed the Anti-Monitor by punching him into a star. The star went nova and caused anti-matter waves to erupt, threatening to destroy the entire anti-matter universe. Kal-L and Superboy-Prime were willing to resign to their final fates, when Alexander Luthor, using his power to open dimensions, revealed that he had created a "paradise dimension", and he used it to prevent the [[Lois Lane]] of Earth-2 from being erased from existence when the post-Crisis universe was formed. Using his own body as a portal, Alexander Luthor, Kal-L, and Superboy-Prime went into the "paradise dimension" alongside Lois. (Source: ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' #12)

===Infinite Crisis===
The 2005 series [[Infinite Crisis]] reveals that Superman (and Lois Lane) of Earth-2, Superboy of Earth-Prime, and [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]] of Earth-3, from their home in the hidden pocket universe, are able to observe the events of the newly-formed universe, as well as the actions of its heroes. Upon observing the events leading up to [[Infinite Crisis]], the heroes return to the universe in an attempt to restore Earth-2's existence, at the expense of Earth-1. In ''Infinite Crisis'' #3 (2005), the Anti-Monitor's remains are revealed to be part of a tower-like apparatus presumably intended for this purpose.

==Post-Crisis Impact==
The Anti-Monitor, despite only being in the ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' mini-series and one issue of ''[[Wonder Woman]],'' left a far-reaching impact on the DC universe post-Crisis. Most notably, his hand from the beginning of the universe is still utilized in comics, directly and indirectly. The [[Swamp Thing]] storyline "American Gothic" revolved around Swamp Thing, [[John Constantine]], and various allies (including [[Phantom Stranger]], [[Demon (comics)|the Demon]], Baron Winters, [[Deadman]], [[Doctor Occult]], [[Doctor Fate]], [[Cain and Abel]], [[Spectre (comics)|the Spectre]], [[Sargon the Sorcerer]], [[Zatara]], [[Zatanna]], and Mento of the [[Doom Patrol]]) attempting to stop a group of male witches known as the Brujera from using the Anti-Monitor's hand to destroy God. At the climax of the storyline in ''Swamp Thing'' #50, Swamp Thing convinces God and the hand of darkness to compromise, although Zatara and Sargon are killed, Zatanna's relationship with Constantine permanently damaged, and Mento driven insane. <br>

The hand of darkness involved in this story was also revealed to be the source of power behind many superheroes and supervillains in the DC universe. Called both "the Shadowlands" and "the Primordial Darkness," the hand empowers [[Obsidian (comics)|Obsidian]], Ian Karkull, [[Shade (comics)|the Shade]], Shadow Thief, [[Eclipso]], and others, either directly or indirectly. <br>

The anti-matter universe still exists, now with both Qward (said to be the counterpart of Oa) and an alternate Earth populated by counterparts of the positive matter heroes and villains (each taking the opposite role, of course). <br>

The heroes and villains killed by the Anti-Monitor or his agents affected many of the survivors, with the impact being felt even today, especially with characters such as [[Flash (comics)|the Flash]]. Barry Allen's death is considered by many to elevate him to a sort of martyrdom, with some proclaiming him the first saint of comics. His successor, Wally West, still struggles with living in the shadow of such a hero.<br>

Perhaps the most notable impact the Anti-Monitor had on the post-Crisis universe was the elimination of the multiverse aspect of the DC Universe. Previously, there existed an infinite number of Earths, each one with a unique history, that could be accessed through various means, the most common being vibrational attunement. Post-Crisis, with the destruction of all but one Earth thanks to the machinations of the Anti-Monitor, a simpler, more streamlined DC Universe seemed imminent, with characters acquired from [[Charlton Comics]], [[Fawcett Comics]], and [[Quality Comics]] all becoming incorporated into the new DC Universe.
