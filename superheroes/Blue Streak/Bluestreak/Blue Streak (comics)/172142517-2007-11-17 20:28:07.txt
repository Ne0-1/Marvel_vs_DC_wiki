When he first began his criminal career, it was revealed that Blue Streak was a foreign spy who served as an operative of the [[Corporation (comics)|Corporation]], which wanted him to infiltrate [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] S.H.I.E.L.D. later decided to put together their own group of Super-Agents, and Blue Streak became a member of that group. Once the group was founded, [[Nick Fury]] introduced [[Captain America]] and [[Falcon (comics)|the Falcon]] to these agents. Blue Streak proudly demonstrated his prowess, and after testing Blue Streak Cap was impressed. However, Cap refused Fury's offer to train these against but the Falcon did want to do it. During a mission for S.H.I.E.L.D., Blue Streak cried out after a near-miss blast from Marvel Man.

When the Falcon ended up being captured by the Corporation, Blue Streak didn't care much figuring the Falcon could take care of himself. The other Super-Agents also didn't take much effort to go find the Falcon and went on with their training alone.When S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Manhattan base was slated for demolition, the Super-Agents were reassigned to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Los Angeles base.

Captain America later interrupted a training session of the Super-Agents by video communication, asking about the Falcon, and the Blue Streak told Cap that the Falcon had last said to him that an "old contact told him Jim <Wilson>'s in trouble." The Blue Streak then told Cap to get off his back, as he didn't owe the Falcon anything. Cap was subsequently ambushed by Corporation agent [[Constrictor (comics)|the Constrictor]]. As only Jasper Sitwell and the Super-Agents knew that he had been in S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Manhattan base, he correctly figured one of them must be a double agent for the Corporation.

Cap confronted the Super-Agents in S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Los Angeles base's training room, telling them that one of them was a spy and he could prove it. In an effort to prevent Cap from questioning him further, the Blue Streak told the others that Cap was just provoking them as another test, and led the other Super-Agents to attack him. The Blue Streak slammed into Cap first, but his second charge was halted with a boot to the gut. After Captain America defeated the rest of the Super-Agents, the Blue Streak panicked and attempted to flee, admitting his guilt in the process, but Cap dropped him with his shield. The Blue Streak possibly broke his arm in the fall, but the [[Vamp (comics)|Vamp]] &mdash; also a Corporation double agent &mdash; decided to kill the Blue Streak to prevent him from giving her away, too. Pretending to be trying to force the Blue Streak to talk, the Vamp began savagely beating him. Captain America tore off her belt (which allowed her to duplicate the abilities of others), and the sudden change in her energy level weakened her. Captain America then confronted the battered Blue Streak, who &mdash; feeling he had nothing else to lose &mdash; told Cap that the Falcon was being held on Alcatraz.

[[Justin Hammer]] later designed Blue Streak's equipment and funded his operations in exchange for a percentage of his profits<ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Deluxe Edition'' #5</ref>. After leaving prison, the Blue Streak led a successful career as a professional criminal in the American Midwest. His rocket skates and laser weaponry enabled him to pursue moving vehicles on highways and rob them. This too was only revealed in the ''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Deluxe Edition'' #20 and never backed up in a comic.

After this, Blue Streak visited the Medina County, Ohio branch of the Bar with No Name every other night for six months.At the Bar with No Name, Blue Streak checked his equipment with Charlie at the door, then ordered a drink from bartender Bart (secretly the [[Scourge of the Underworld]]), who pointed him towards someone who wanted to see him. Gary Gilbert (formerly Firebrand) told Blue Streak about the series of super-villains being assassinated, and he invited Blue Streak to join his underground network to locate and eliminate the killer, but Blue Streak refused: "Sorry, Gilbert. I ain't a joiner."

That same night, Blue Streak raced down a highway in the mountains, whipping past Captain America, who was traveling cross-country by van, and a highway patrol car wrecked trying to pursue the Blue Streak. After rescuing the two injured officers, Cap followed the skater's trail and happened across the uncostumed Blue Streak at a rest stop. Recognizing Blue Streak's face, the similarly uncostumed Steve Rogers confronted and identified the Blue Streak, then dodged a punch and dropped him with a submission hold. Fearing his opponent was the villain-killer, Blue Streak managed to pull out one of his gauntlets, fire on Rogers, and break free from his grip. Cap ducked the blast, but it hit and blew up a car - which happened to be Blue Streak's own - and the distraction allowed the Blue Streak to change into costume (which Cap did as well). Cap dodged a volley of laser blasts, then hurled his shield at the Blue Streak, knocking his feet out from under him and damaging one of his boot-jets. 

Deciding to cut his losses, Blue Streak fled, but Cap pursued him on his motorcycle and caught up to him. Blue Streak fired at him a few more times, then took off around a bend and tried to ambush Cap as he turned the corner. Cap blocked him with his shield, after which Blue Streak tossed some razor sharp jacks across the road in front of him. While Cap cleared these with his shield, Blue Streak took off again, this time faking his death by damaging the guard rail and leaving pieces of his equipment on the cliff below. Captain America climbed down the cliff to see if he was still alive, and the Blue Streak decided it was best to escape while he could, rather than risking everything by trying to kill Captain America. Hitching a ride in a passing semi-truck, Blue Streak unwittingly got into the cab with the disguised [[Scourge of the Underworld]], who executed him.

==Powers and abilities==
Blue Streak I's equipment included rocket-powered roller skates which allowed forward and backward movement and leaping, lasers mounted on the arms of his suit, and caltrops that he used to puncture the tires of pursuing cars.
