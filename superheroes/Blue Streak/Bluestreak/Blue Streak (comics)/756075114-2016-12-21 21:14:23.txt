===Bluestreak (psychic)===
A new character named Bluestreak has appeared as a [[Registration acts (comics)#2006 Superhuman Registration Act|Superhuman Registration Act]] violator. When [[Mind-Wave#Caged Angels|Mindwave]] was imprisoned by the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], he began a telepathic conversation with fellow prisoners Caprice, Bluestreak, and [[Mirage (Marvel Comics)#Caged Angels|Mirage]]. Bluestreak only remarked that he wanted all of the Thunderbolts to die.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #117</ref>

[[Mac Gargan|Venom]] killed and ate a number of Thunderbolts Mountain guards,<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #118</ref> and it was revealed that Bluestreak was telepathically controlling Venom. He also mentally prevented the Thunderbolts from remembering that they could stop the rampaging Venom, as well as the rebelling [[Andreas von Strucker|Swordsman]], with the nanochains.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #119</ref> [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] killed Bluestreak and his allies in their cells by throwing scalpels into their heads.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #121</ref>

It is unknown at this time what connection, if any, the new [[Hellrazor#Caged Angels|Hellrazor]] has to these other prisoners of the Thunderbolts.

==Powers and abilities==
The original Blue Streak's equipment included rocket-powered roller skates which allowed forward and backward movement and leaping, lasers mounted on the arms of his suit, and caltrops that he used to puncture the tires of pursuing cars.

'''Bluestreak''' (Blue Kelso) is a [[fictional character]] who appeared in the [[Marvel Comics]] series ''[[A-Next]]''. Though not related to [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], her powers and costume certainly invoke him, in the same way many of the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] universe characters resemble those of [[Earth-616]].

Little is known about the energetic Bluestreak's past. It is known that she is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] gifted with incredible speed, who left the newest incarnation of the [[X-Men]] (the [[X-People]]) because they were not "flashy" enough for her. Bluestreak's real name is later revealed as Blue Kelso.<ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' (2006) #2.</ref>

Bluestreak joins the '''Dream Team''', who soon become part of the new [[Avengers (comics)#Avengers Next|Avengers]] team. She quickly develops a crush on teammate [[J2 (comics)|J2]] (a fact to which he is completely oblivious). Cocky and impulsive, Bluestreak often has problems following the orders of [[Mainframe (comics)|Mainframe]]. The only thing that surpasses her exuberant attitude is her skill at using her speed. When Mainframe's inert body needs to be taken across the city in less than a minute, she places him on a gurney and covers the needed distance in virtually no time at all, even remarking afterwards that she could have stopped for a sandwich, but did not want to show off.

Bluestreak is not to be confused with the deceased similarly named, techno-based villain Blue Streak.

===Powers and abilities===
Bluestreak is a mutant capable of running at superhuman speeds. Her top velocity is unknown, but she can exceed the speed of sound. She also possesses incredible stamina and can run for long periods of time without showing any signs of fatigue.
