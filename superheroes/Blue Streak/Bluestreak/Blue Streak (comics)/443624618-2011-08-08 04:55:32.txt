'''Blue Streak''' ('''Don Thomas''') is a fictional character from the Marvel Universe.

===Publication history===
Blue Streak first appeared in ''Captain America'' #217-218 (Januaryâ€“February 1978), created by [[Roy Thomas]], [[Don Glut]], and [[John Buscema]].

The character subsequently appeared in ''Captain America'' #228-229 (December 1978-January 1979).  He was killed by the [[Scourge of the Underworld]] in ''Captain America'' #318 (June 1986).

Blue Streak received an entry in the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition]]'' #16.

===Fictional character biography===
When he first began his criminal career, it was revealed that Blue Streak was a foreign spy who served as an operative of the [[Corporation (comics)|Corporation]], which wanted him to infiltrate [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] S.H.I.E.L.D. later decided to put together their own group of Super-Agents, and Blue Streak became a member of that group. Once the group was founded, [[Nick Fury]] introduced [[Captain America]] and the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] to these agents. Blue Streak proudly demonstrated his prowess, and after testing Blue Streak Captain America was impressed. However, Captain America refused Fury's offer to train these against but the Falcon did want to do it. During a mission for S.H.I.E.L.D., Blue Streak cried out after a near-miss blast from Marvel Man.{{Issue|date=June 2011}}

When the Falcon ended up being captured by the Corporation, Blue Streak didn't care much figuring the Falcon could take care of himself. The other Super-Agents also didn't take much effort to go find the Falcon and went on with their training alone.When S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Manhattan base was slated for demolition, the Super-Agents were reassigned to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Los Angeles base.{{Issue|date=June 2011}}

Captain America later interrupted a training session of the Super-Agents by video communication, asking about the Falcon, and the Blue Streak told Captain America that the Falcon had last said to him that an "old contact told him Jim <Wilson>'s in trouble." The Blue Streak then told Captain America to get off his back, as he didn't owe the Falcon anything. Captain America was subsequently ambushed by Corporation agent [[Constrictor (comics)|the Constrictor]]. As only Jasper Sitwell and the Super-Agents knew that he had been in S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Manhattan base, he correctly figured one of them must be a double agent for the Corporation.{{Issue|date=June 2011}}

Captain America confronted the Super-Agents in S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Los Angeles base's training room, telling them that one of them was a spy and he could prove it. In an effort to prevent Captain America from questioning him further, the Blue Streak told the others that Captain America was just provoking them as another test, and led the other Super-Agents to attack him. The Blue Streak slammed into Captain America first, but his second charge was halted with a boot to the gut. After Captain America defeated the rest of the Super-Agents, the Blue Streak panicked and attempted to flee, admitting his guilt in the process, but Captain America dropped him with his shield. The Blue Streak possibly broke his arm in the fall, but the [[Vamp (comics)|Vamp]] &mdash; also a Corporation double agent &mdash; decided to kill the Blue Streak to prevent him from giving her away, too. Pretending to be trying to force the Blue Streak to talk, the Vamp began savagely beating him. Captain America tore off her belt (which allowed her to duplicate the abilities of others), and the sudden change in her energy level weakened her. Captain America then confronted the battered Blue Streak, who &mdash; feeling he had nothing else to lose &mdash; told Captain America that the Falcon was being held on Alcatraz.{{Issue|date=June 2011}}

[[Justin Hammer]] later designed Blue Streak's equipment and funded his operations in exchange for a percentage of his profits.<ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Deluxe Edition'' #5</ref> After leaving prison, the Blue Streak led a successful career as a professional criminal in the American Midwest. His rocket skates and laser weaponry enabled him to pursue moving vehicles on highways and rob them.<ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Deluxe Edition'' #20</ref> Blue Streak also visited the Medina County, Ohio branch of the Bar with No Name every other night for six months. At the bar, Blue Streak was contacted by Gary Gilbert (formerly Firebrand), who told Blue Streak about the serial killings of super-villains by the hand of [[Scourge of the Underworld|an unknown assassin]], and invited Blue Streak to join his underground network to locate and eliminate the killer, but Blue Streak refused.{{Issue|date=August 2011}}

That same night, Blue Streak raced down a highway in the mountains, whipping past Captain America, who was traveling cross-country by van. Later on, Captain America happened across the uncostumed Blue Streak at a nearby rest stop. Recognizing Blue Streak's face, the similarly uncostumed Steve Rogers confronted him, and fearing his opponent was the villain-killer, Blue Streak managed to disctract the Captain long enough to change into costume (which Captain America did as well). During their subsequent fight, Captain America hurled his shield at the Blue Streak, damaging one of his boot-jets. Deciding to cut his losses, Blue Streak fled, but Captain America pursued him to a cliffside highway. After a few futile attempts to stop the Captain's pursuit, Blue Streak resorted to faking his death by damaging the guard rail and leaving pieces of his equipment on the cliff below. Captain America climbed down the cliff to see if Streak was still alive, and the Blue Streak decided to escape. Hitching a ride in a passing semi-truck, Blue Streak unwittingly got into the cab with the disguised [[Scourge of the Underworld]], who immediately executed him.<ref>''Captain America'' #318 (June 1986)</ref>

Blue Streak was later among the eighteen criminals, all murdered by the Scourge, to be resurrected by [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] using the power of [[Dormammu]] as part of a squad assembled to eliminate the [[Punisher]].<ref>''Punisher'' Vol. 7 #5</ref> Blue Streak wound up fighting the Punisher's partner Henry instead, who broke Blue Streak's neck and apparently killed him.<ref>''Punisher'' Vol. 7 #9</ref>

===Powers and abilities===
Blue Streak's equipment included rocket-powered roller skates which allowed forward and backward movement and leaping, lasers mounted on the arms of his suit, and caltrops that he used to puncture the tires of pursuing cars.
