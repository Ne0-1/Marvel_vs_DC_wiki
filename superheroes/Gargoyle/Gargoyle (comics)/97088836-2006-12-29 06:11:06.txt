'''Isaac Christians''', was a human/[[Demons (Marvel Comics)|demon]] composite and a member of the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. He was created by writer [[J. M. DeMatteis]] and artist [[Don Perlin]]. Christians was an elderly man who sold his soul to an alliance of minor demons styling themselves as "[[Demons (Marvel Comics)|The Six-Fingered Hand]]" in exchange for prosperity for the town that his ancestors had founded. The demons of the Hand transferred Christians' life force into the body of an ancient gargoyle and sent him on a mission to capture [[Patsy Walker]], at that time operating as Defenders member Hellcat. Christians rebelled against the Hand and allied himself with the Defenders to defeat them.

Christians was later released from the Gargoyle body and the original demon spirit re-inhabited it. Christians, to prevent the chaos being wreaked by the gargoyle, re-assumed the body and killed his original human body to prevent the demon from returning.

[[Moondragon]], under the influence of the Dragon of the Moon, separated Christians' life force from the gargoyle body. The body became larger and more grotesque. It was transformed into a statue of ash.

Christians' life force came to reside in a crystal. Eventually, the former Defender known as [[Cloud (comics)|Cloud]] created a new body for Christians, with the ability to change back and forth between his gargoyle and human form. 

===Powers===
Gargoyle II possessed superhuman strength in his gargoyle form, enabling him to lift approximately two tons. His leathery hide offered resistance to various forms of physical attack. He could manipulate "biomystical" energy to numerous effects, including concussinve blasts. He could siphon biomystical energy from others, causing temporary debilitating weakness. Surrounding himself in a field of biomystical energy granted Gargoyle limited immunity to certain types of spells. Gargoyle could fly (levitate); his wings were non-functional for flight but could be used for navigation. Gargoyle could regenerate lost or damaged limbs, although they would differ wildly in appearance from the original limb. Prior to his transformation, Christians had some ability to manipulate mystical forces, including rudimentary spell-casting and summoning demons.

==Other Media==
Gargoyle appeared in the 1996 [[The Incredible Hulk (1996 TV series)|Incredible Hulk cartoon series]] voiced by [[Mark Hamill]]. He is seen as the assistant to the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]]
