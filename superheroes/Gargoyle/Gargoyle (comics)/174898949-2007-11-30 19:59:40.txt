'''Yuri Topolov''', was a [[Soviet]] scientist and the first foe of the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]].  An atomic accident caused by working with radiation mutated him into a grotesque, large-headed dwarf of extremely high intelligence. [[Bruce Banner]] managed to cure him and he managed to destroy several [[Soviet]] generals and 'die like a man', transforming back into a normal human before his death.<ref>Hulk #1</ref> However, he passed this deformity on to his son, the [[Gremlin (comics)|Gremlin]].

Note that the Gargoyleâ€™s appearance in ''Rampaging Hulk'' #1 is merely part of one of [[Bereet]]'s fictional techno-art films.

'''Isaac Christians''', was a human/[[Demons (Marvel Comics)|demon]] composite and a member of the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. He was created by writer [[J. M. DeMatteis]] and artist [[Don Perlin]]. 

===Fictional character biography===
Isaac Christians was an elderly man who sold his soul to an alliance of minor demons styling themselves as "[[Demons (Marvel Comics)#The Six-Fingered Hand|The Six-Fingered Hand]]" in exchange for prosperity for the town that his ancestors had founded (the fictional town of Christiansboro, Virginia). The demons of the Hand transferred Christians' life force into the body of an ancient gargoyle and sent him on a mission to capture [[Patsy Walker]], at that time operating as Defenders member Hellcat. Christians rebelled against the Hand and allied himself with the Defenders to defeat them.

Christians was later released from the Gargoyle body and the original demon spirit re-inhabited it. Christians, to prevent the chaos being wreaked by the gargoyle, re-assumed the body and killed his original human body to prevent the demon from returning. 
[[Moondragon]], under the influence of the Dragon of the Moon, separated Christians' life force from the gargoyle body. The body became larger and more grotesque. It was transformed into a statue of ash.

Christians' life force came to reside in a crystal. Eventually, the former Defender known as [[Cloud (comics)|Cloud]] created a new body for Christians, with the ability to change back and forth between his gargoyle and human form.

=== Civil War/The Initiative ===
Christians has been identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes who appear on the cover of the comic book [[Avengers: The Initiative]] #1 . <ref>[http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 Avengers: The Initiative #1 Character Map]</ref> He was shown flying in an attack against [[HYDRA]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #4</ref> He was then seen aiding [[Patsy Walker|Hellcat]] in [[Marvel Comics Presents]].{{issue}}

===Powers and abilities===
Gargoyle possessed superhuman strength in his gargoyle form. His leathery hide offered resistance to various forms of physical attack. He could manipulate "bio-mystical" energy to numerous effects, including concussive blasts. He could siphon bio-mystical energy from others, causing temporary debilitating weakness. Surrounding himself in a field of bio-mystical energy granted Gargoyle limited immunity to certain types of spells. Gargoyle could fly (levitate); his wings were non-functional for flight but could be used for navigation. Gargoyle could regenerate lost or damaged limbs, although they would differ wildly in appearance from the original limb. Prior to his transformation, Christians had some ability to manipulate mystical forces, including rudimentary spell-casting and summoning demons.

==In other media==
* Gargoyle was seen in the intro to the theme song of the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' TV series when Magneto and his cadre of mutants charge toward the X-Men near the end.

* Gargoyle appeared in the 1996 ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1996 TV series)|Incredible Hulk]]'' cartoon series voiced by [[Mark Hamill]]. This Gargoyle was more closely related to the original Gargoyle from the Silver Age comics, and was always trying to find a cure for his mutation, even allying himself with The [[Leader (comics)|Leader]]. In one episode he accidentally released a gamma virus, infecting amongst others [[Betty Ross Banner|Betty Ross]]. When Ross was dying from the virus, Gargoyle gave [[Bruce Banner]] the antidote, warning that the next time they met he would not be so favorable. His position with The Leader was one of subservience, although he did become the dominant member when The Leader temporarily lost his powers at the beginning of the second season. From then on, like [[MODOK]] in the Iron Man cartoon, he became the bumbling [[comic relief]], with a crush on [[She-Hulk]]. Oddly, in the TV series, his name was changed to Gorgon for unknown reasons.
