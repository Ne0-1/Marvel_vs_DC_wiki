In [[DC Comics]]' [[comic books]], '''Desaad''' is one of the followers of [[Darkseid]] from the planet of [[Apokolips]] in [[Jack Kirby's Fourth World]] meta-series.<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation | last = Wallace | first = Dan | author-link = | contribution = Demons Three | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 98  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = New York  | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>

Darkseid's master torturer, his name is a play on the [[Marquis de Sade]].  At one point Desaad had an assistant named '''Justeen''', a reference to de Sade's novel ''[[The Misfortunes of Virtue|Justine]]'', although she bore little resemblance to the title character.

==Fictional character biography==
[[Image:Youngdesaad.PNG|Darkseid with a young Desaad. Art by [[Colleen Doran]].|thumb|left]]
Desaad's first recorded appearance in the history of the [[DC Universe]] was as a hanger-on at the side of Drax, heir to Apokolips. He had already taken his "god-name", which he claimed to have taken in tribute to a being from the future "who has taught me much in my chosen field".

Desaad's origins were revealed during Darkseid's chess game with [[Eclipso]]. After Eclipso told Darkseid of how he had caused the Biblical flood, Darkseid shared how he had corrupted an innocent youth by tricking him into believing the youth's cat had killed his other pet, a bird. Goading the boy to avenge the bird, Darkseid manipulates the youth into burying the cat alive. The bird returned, having flown off, and in a rage, the youth killed the bird and left New Genesis to become Darkseid's lackey.

Desaad appeared to be helping Drax with his attempt to master the Omega force. In fact, he was plotting with Drax's brother Uxas. As a result Drax was presumed killed, and Uxas mastered the Omega force, taking the god-name Darkseid. Desaad went on to serve as Darkseid's torturer.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Desaad is a sadist and a coward. He is naturally treacherous, but is sufficiently afraid of Darkseid that he will not turn against his master unless someone else takes the lead (and will probably switch sides again if it looks like they will fail). He spent some time posing as Darkseid to keep [[Intergang]] going. While Darkseid had been involved with Intergang as part of his search for the [[Anti-Life Equation]], Desaad simply wanted to cause suffering.

Desaad was seemingly killed during an attempt by Darkseid to penetrate the Source. He was subsequently found to have "bonded" with [[Orion (comics)|Orion]], causing the latter to become cruel and manipulative. They were later separated. While missing, his second-in-command Justeen plots to overthrow Desaad's position and become closer to her beloved Darkseid.<ref>''Orion'' #1 June 2000)</ref>

In the [[Superman/Batman]] story ''Torment'', Desaad is tasked by Darkseid to retrieve [[Highfather]]'s staff from the [[Source Wall]], and use it to restore Darkseid's waning powers. Working with the Batman villain [[Scarecrow (comics)|Scarecrow]] he brainwashes [[Superman]].  However, when the time came to recharge Darkseid's powers, using the staff as a conduit to the Omega Realm, Desaad betrays Darkseid and tried to take the power for himself. The Omega Effect, however, possessed a horror within it that Desaad could not stand, and Darkseid simply siphoned the energy off him.

At the end of issue #25 of ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]'' Desaad, who had captured and tortured [[Professor Martin Stein]], is able to take over the mantle and the power of [[Firestorm]] for himself. He is defeated and separated from the Firestorm matrix by the [[Atomic Knights]], but flees before he could be captured. After disrupting a battle between Darkseid and [[Mary Marvel]], Desaad gives Darkseid a compound that was unsuccessfully used to access the Anti-Life Equation.  Desaad is then released from Darkseid's service. However, Desaad has transported the [[Pied Piper (comics)|Pied Piper]] to Apokolips as [[Brother Eye]] arrives. Desaad claims the Piper can channel the Anti-Life Equation and control the planet. Before the Piper can do so, Brother Eye finishes assimilating Apokolips. After recovering, Desaad confesses to masterminding Trickster and Piper's ordeal. However, they are attacked by an OMAC and Piper is captured. Desaad continues to pursue Piper and convinces him to finally play. However, Piper's first act is to kill Desaad.

In ''[[Salvation Run]]'', it is revealed that Desaad oversees the training of the New Gods of Apokolips on a planet where [[Amanda Waller]]'s [[Suicide Squad]] had dumped the exiled villains. When he discovers them on this planet, he arranges for the Parademons to eliminate the least powerful villains so that he can train the stronger ones for an unknown goal. During the Final Crisis series, many of the evil gods have taken human form in an attempt to control and rule earth.

In ''[[Final Crisis]]'' #5, it has been hinted that [[Mary Marvel]] has been possessed by Desaad, in the same sense that [[Dan Turpin]] is now Darkseid's new host. When Black Adam attacked Mary, he noted that he saw a "leering old man" in her eyes.

==Powers and abilities==
Desaad has no powers, relying instead on his intellect and Darkseid's protection. He is immortal.

==Other media==
===Television===
* Desaad appeared in two of the 1980s incarnations of the ''[[Superfriends]]'' cartoon, ''[[The Legendary Super Powers Show]]'' and ''[[Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians]]'', and was voiced by [[Rene Auberjonois]].
* The character also appeared on the 1990s ''[[Superman: The Animated Series|Superman]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Robert Morse]].
* Desaad appears in ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' where Auberjonois re-assumed the role. In the ''Justice League'' episode, "Twilight", Desaad comments that Darkseid's most recent military action to gain the Anti-Life Equation (which left their military devastated by New Genesis), was foolish, leading Darkseid to kill him with the Omega force, saying, "No one questions me, Desaad."
