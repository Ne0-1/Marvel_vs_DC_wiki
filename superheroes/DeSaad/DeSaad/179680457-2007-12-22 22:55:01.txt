In [[DC Comics]]' [[comic books]], '''Desaad''' is one of the followers of [[Darkseid]] from the planet of [[Apokolips]] in [[Jack Kirby's Fourth World]] meta-series. 

Darkseid's master torturer, his name is a play on the [[Marquis de Sade]]. Physically, he stands at 5 feet, 11 inches, and weighs 152 pounds.

At one point Desaad had an assistant named '''Justeen''', a reference to de Sade's novel ''[[The Misfortunes of Virtue|Justine]]'', although she bore little resemblance to the title character.

==Fictional character biography==
Desaad's first recorded appearance in the history of the [[DC Universe]]
was as a hanger-on at the side of Drax, heir to Apokolips. He had already taken his "god-name", which he claimed to have taken in tribute to a being from the future "who has taught me much in my chosen field" (presumably the Marquis).

Desaad's origins were revealed during Darkseid's chess game with [[Eclipso]]. After Eclipso told Darkseid of how the former caused the Biblical flood, Darkseid shared how he had corrupted an innocent youth by tricking him into believing the youth's cat had killed his other pet, a bird. Goading the boy to avenge the bird, Darkseid manipulated the youth into burying the cat alive. The bird returned, having flown off, and in a rage, the youth killed the bird and left New Genesis to become Darkseid's lackey.

Desaad appeared to be helping Drax with his attempt to master the Omega force. In fact, he was plotting with Drax's brother Uxas. As a result Drax was presumed killed, and Uxas mastered the Omega force, taking the god-name Darkseid. Desaad went on to serve as Darkseid's torturer.

Desaad is a sadist (as the name implies) and a coward. He is naturally treacherous, but is sufficiently afraid of Darkseid that he will not turn against his master unless someone else takes the lead (and will probably switch sides again if it looks like they will fail). He spent some time posing as Darkseid to keep [[Intergang]] going. While Darkseid had been involved with Intergang as part of his search for the [[Anti-Life Equation]], Desaad simply wanted to cause suffering.

Desaad was seemingly killed during an attempt by Darkseid to penetrate the Source. He was subsequently found to have "bonded" with [[Orion (comics)|Orion]], causing the latter to become cruel and manipulative. They were later separated. While missing, his second-in-command Justeen plots to overthrow Desaad's position and become closer to her beloved Darkseid (''Orion'' #1 June 2000).

In the [[Superman/Batman]] story ''Torment'', Desaad iss tasked by Darkseid to retrieve [[Highfather]]'s staff from the [[Source Wall]], and use it to restore Darkseid's waning powers. Using a brainwashed [[Superman]], Desaad accomplishes this, but when the time came to recharge Darkseid's powers, using the staff as a conduit to the Omega Realm, Desaad betrayed Darkseid and tried to take the power for himself. The Omega Effect, however, possessed a horror within it that Desaad could not stand, and Darkseid simply siphoned the energy off him.

At the end of issue #25 of ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]'' Desaad, who had captured and tortured [[Professor Martin Stein]], was able to take over the mantle and the power of [[Firestorm]] for himself. He was defeated and separated from the Firestorm matrix by the [[Atomic Knights]], but fled before he could be captured.

==Powers and abilities==
Desaad has no powers, relying instead on his intellect and Darkseid's protection.  He is immortal.

==Other media==
Desaad appeared in two of the 1980s incarnations of the ''[[Superfriends]]'' cartoon, ''[[The Legendary Super Powers Show]]'' and ''[[Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians]]'', and was voiced by [[Rene Auberjonois]]. The character also appeared on the 1990s ''[[Superman: The Animated Series|Superman]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Robert Morse]], as well as ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'', where Auberjonois re-assumed the role. In the ''Justice League'' episode, "Twilight", Desaad comments that Darkseid's most recent military action to gain the Anti-Life Equation (which left their military devastated by New Genesis), was foolish, leading Darkseid to kill him with the Omega force, saying, "No one questions me, Desaad."
