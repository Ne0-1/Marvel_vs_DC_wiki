In [[DC Comics]]' [[comic books]], '''Desaad''' is one of the followers of [[Darkseid]] from the planet of [[Apokolips]] in [[Jack Kirby's Fourth World]] meta-series. 

Darkseid's master torturer, his name is a play on the [[Marquis de Sade]]. Physically, he stands at 5 feet, 11 inches, and weighs 152 pounds.

At one point Desaad had an assistant named '''Justeen''', a reference to de Sade's novel ''[[The Misfortunes of Virtue|Justine]]'', although she bore little resemblance to the title character.

==Fictional biography==
Desaad's first recorded appearance in the history of the [[DC Universe]]
was as a hanger-on at the side of Drax, heir to Apokolips. He had already taken his "god-name", which he claimed to have taken in tribute to a being from the future "who has taught me much in my chosen field" (presumably the Marquis).

Desaad appeared to be helping Drax with his attempt to master the Omega force. In fact, he was plotting with Drax's brother Uxas. As a result Drax was presumed killed, and Uxas mastered the Omega force, taking the god-name Darkseid. Desaad went on to serve as Darkseid's torturer.

Desaad is a sadist (as the name implies) and a coward. He is naturally treacherous, but is sufficiently afraid of Darkseid that he will not turn against his master unless someone else takes the lead (and will probably switch sides again if it looks like they will fail). He spent some time posing as Darkseid to keep [[Intergang]] going. While Darkseid had been involved with Intergang as part of his search for the [[Anti-Life Equation]], Desaad simply wanted to cause suffering.

Desaad was seemingly killed during an attempt by Darkseid to penetrate the Source. He was subsequently found to have "bonded" with [[Orion (comics)|Orion]], causing the latter to become cruel and manipulative. They were later separated.

Recently, following the destruction of Apokolips in the final battle of the New Gods War, Desaad has taken the role of a psychotherapist, proficient in "Dark Side Therapy." Dark Side Therapy consists of a [[telephone]] call to Darkseid, who uses the Anti-Life Equation to destroy the humanity within the "patient." Desaad used this role to manipulate [[Shilo Norman]], the current [[Mister Miracle]].

It was revealed later on that Desaad was once a citizen of New Genesis, the 'purest soul in all of New Genesis' before he was corrupted.

==Powers and abilities==
Desaad has no powers, relying instead on his intellect and Darkseid's protection.  He is immortal.

==Other media==
Desaad appeared in two of the [[1980s]] incarnations of the ''[[Superfriends]]'' cartoon, ''The Legendary Super Powers Show'' and ''Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians'', and was voiced by [[Rene Auberjonois]]. The character also appeared on the [[1990s]] ''[[Superman: The Animated Series|Superman]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Robert Morse]], as well as ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'' where Auberjonois re-assumed the role.  In the Justice League episode, "Twilight of the Gods", Desaad comments that Darkseid's most recent military action to gain the Anti-Life Equation (which left their military devastated by New Genesis), was foolish, leading Darkseid to kill him with the Omega force, saying, "No one questions me, Desaad."
