The '''Man-Thing''' ('''Dr. Theodore "Ted" Sallis''') is a [[Character (arts)|fictional]] [[monster]], appearing in books published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by writers [[Stan Lee]], [[Roy Thomas]], and [[Gerry Conway]] and artist [[Gray Morrow]], the character first appeared in ''[[Savage Tales]]'' #1 (May 1971), and went on to be featured in various titles and in his own series, including ''[[Adventure into Fear]]'', which introduced the character [[Howard the Duck]].

[[Steve Gerber]]'s 39-issue run on the series<ref>Gerber's run is continuous from ''Fear'' #11-19, and ''Man-Thing'' #1-22, as well as the concurrent ''Giant-Size Man-Thing'' #1-5, and ''Monsters Unleashed'' #8-9, and these were followed quickly by a story in the ''The Rampaging Hulk'' #7 for a total of 39 issues. In addition, Gerber also wrote Man-Thing into ''Marvel Two in One'' #1, three issues of ''Daredevil'' as well as ''Iron Man Annual'' #3, which are not here counted among the 39.</ref> is a [[cult classic]] that was influential on such writers as [[Neil Gaiman]].<ref>[http://journal.neilgaiman.com/2008/02/steve-gerber.html Neil Gaiman Journal: "Steve Gerber", February 11, 2008]</ref>

Man-Thing is a large, slow-moving, [[empathy|empathic]], [[humanoid]] creature living in the [[Florida]] [[Everglades]] near the [[Seminole]] [[Indian reservation|reservation]] and the fictitious town of [[Citrusville]]. He was portrayed by [[Conan Stevens|Mark Stevens]] in the 2005 made-for-TV film ''[[Man-Thing (film)|Man-Thing]]''.

==Publication history==
As described in the text featurette "The Story Behind the Scenes" in ''[[Savage Tales]]'' #1 ([[cover-date]]d May 1971), the black-and-white adventure fantasy magazine in which the character debuted in an 11-page origin story, Man-Thing was conceived in discussions between [[Marvel Comics]] editor [[Stan Lee]] and writer [[Roy Thomas]], and that together they created five possible origins. Lee provided the name, which had previously been used for unrelated creatures in Marvel's early science-fiction/fantasy anthology ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #7 (Jan. 1960) and #81 (Sept. 1966),<ref>[http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=15469 ''Tales of Suspense'' #7 (Jan. 1960)]: "I Fought the [[Molten Man-Thing]]!", writer unknown, at the [[Grand Comics Database]]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://chronologyproject.com/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=4073&sid=37aa7778a4232117321b5e4ac8a3eee3&p=25609#p25609 |title=Marvel Chronology Project • View topic - Man-Thing I |publisher=Chronologyproject.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-12}}</ref> as well as the concept of the man losing sentience.

As Thomas recalled in 2002:
{{blockquote|Stan Lee called me in; it would've been late '70 or early '71. [...] He had a couple of sentences or so for the concept — I think it was mainly the notion of a guy working on some experimental drug or something for the government, his being accosted by spies, and getting fused with the swamp so that he becomes this creature. The creature itself sounds a lot like the [[Heap (comics)|Heap]], but neither of us mentioned that character at the time.... I didn't care much for the name 'Man-Thing', because we already had the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] [of the superhero team the [[Fantastic Four]]], and I thought it would be confusing to also have another one called Man-Thing.<ref>Roy Thomas interview, ''[[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]]'' #81 (October 2008), p. 20</ref>}}

Thomas worked out a detailed plot<ref>The three-page, single-spaced plot for the 11-page story is reprinted in ''Alter Ego'' #81 (October 2008), pp. 22-23</ref>  and gave it to [[Gerry Conway]] to script. Thomas and Conway are credited as writers, with [[Gray Morrow]] as artist. A second story, written by [[Len Wein]] and drawn by [[Neal Adams]], was prepared at that time, but, upon ''Savage Tales''<nowiki>'</nowiki> cancellation after that single issue,<ref>The magazine was later revived, beginning with issue #2 (Oct. 1973)</ref> "took a year or two to see print", according to Thomas.<ref>Thomas interview, p. 21</ref> That occurred in ''[[Astonishing Tales]]'' #12 (June 1972), in which the seven-page story was integrated in its entirety within the 21-page feature "[[Ka-Zar (comics)|Ka-Zar]]", starring Marvel's jungle-lord hero. This black-and-white interlude (with yellow highlighting) segued to Man-Thing's introduction to color comics as Ka-Zar's antagonist-turned-ally in this and the following issue (both written by Thomas, with the first [[penciler|penciled]] by [[John Buscema]] and the second by Buscema and [[Rich Buckler]]).

The Wein-written Man-Thing story appeared in-between Wein's first<ref>The character Alex Olsen, introduced in DC's ''[[House of Secrets (DC Comics)|House of Secrets]]'' #92 (July 1971)</ref> and second<ref>The character Alec Holland, introduced in DC's ''Swamp Thing'' #1 (Nov. 1972)</ref> version of his [[DC Comics]] character [[Swamp Thing]]. Wein was Conway's roommate at the time, and as Thomas recalled in 2008,

{{blockquote|Gerry and I thought that, unconsciously, the origin in ''Swamp Thing'' #1 was a bit too similar to the origin of Man-Thing a year-and-a-half earlier. There was vague talk at the time around Marvel of legal action, but it was never really pursued. I don't know if any letters even changed hands between Marvel and DC. [...] We weren't happy with the situation over the ''Swamp Thing'' #1 origin, but we figured it was an accident. Gerry was rooming with Len at the time and tried to talk him into changing the Swamp Thing's origin. Len didn't see the similarities, so he went ahead with what he was going to do. The two characters verged off after that origin, so it didn't make much difference, anyway.<ref>Thomas interview, p. 25</ref>}}

Man-Thing received his own 10-page feature, again by Conway (with Morrow inking pencils by [[Howard Chaykin]]), in ''[[Adventure into Fear]]'' #10 (Oct. 1972), sharing that anthological title with reprinted 1950s [[horror fiction|horror]]/[[fantasy]] stories. [[Steve Gerber]], who would become Man-Thing's signature writer, succeeded Conway the following issue, with art by Rich Buckler (Mayerik began with issue #13). The feature expanded to 15 pages with #12 (art by [[Jim Starlin]]), became 16 pages two issues later, and reached the then-standard 19-page length of Marvel [[superhero]] comics with issue #15, at which point the series also went from bi-monthly to monthly. In ''Fear''  #11 (Dec. 1972), page 11, Gerber created the series' narrative tagline, used in captions: "Whatever knows fear burns at the Man-Thing's touch!"

After issue #19 (Dec.1973), Man-Thing received a solo title, which ran 22 issues (Jan. 1974 - Oct. 1975). Following Morrow, the main series' primary [[penciller]]s were, successively, [[Val Mayerik]], [[Mike Ploog]], John Buscema, and [[Jim Mooney]]. A sister publication was the larger, quarterly ''Giant-Size Man-Thing'' #1-5 (August 1974 - August 1975), which featured 1950s horror-fantasy and 1960s [[science fiction]]/monster reprints as back-up stories, with a [[Howard the Duck]] feature added in the final two issues. The unintentional [[double entendre]] in the sister series' title became a joke among comics readers.<ref>As Thomas, for one, recalled: "''Giant-Size Man-Thing'' later had a decidedly funny ring to it, but not 'Man-Thing' in itself". (Thomas interview, p. 21)</ref>

In the final issue, writer Gerber appeared as a character in the story, claiming he had not been inventing the Man-Thing's adventures but simply reporting on them and that he had decided to move on. Gerber continued to write Man-Thing guest appearances in other Marvel titles, as well as the serialized, eight-page Man-Thing feature in the omnibus series ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' #1-12 (Sept. 1988 - Feb. 1989), and a supporting role in ''[[The Evolutionary War]]'', coming to the aid of [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''[[Web of Spider-Man]] Annual'' #4</ref> Gerber also wrote a graphic novel that [[Kevin Nowlan]] spent many years illustrating, but he did not live to see it published.<ref name="lonely.geek.nz">[http://www.lonely.geek.nz/fording_the_mainstream/man-thing/infernal.html]</ref>

A second ''Man-Thing'' series ran 11 issues (Nov. 1979 - Jan. 1981). Writer [[Michael Fleisher]] and penciller Mooney teamed for the first three issues, with the letters page of #3 noting that Fleisher's work had received a great deal of negative criticism and that he had been taken off the book. He was succeeded by, primarily, writer [[Chris Claremont]] and illustrators [[Don Perlin]] (breakdowns) and [[Bob Wiacek]] (finished pencils).  Claremont's stories introduced Man-Thing and [[Jennifer Kale]] to [[Doctor Strange]] (whose series he was concurrently writing), after which his material focused on two new supporting characters: John Daltry, Citrusville's new sheriff, and Bobbie Bannister, a formerly wealthy girl who is the only survivor when her parents' yacht is attacked.  These characters' stories he resolved by tying them to a resolution for his own ''[[War Is Hell (comics)|War Is Hell]]'' series.<ref>''Man-Thing'' vol. 2, #10-11, guest starring John Kowalski</ref>

Black and white Man-Thing stories, and some covers, also appeared in the Marvel magazine [[Monsters Unleashed]] as well.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

[[Simon Jowett]] provided a Man-Thing story in ''Marvel Comics Presents'' #164-168 (Early Oct.-Late Nov. 1994). The story was set soon after Sallis' transformation, yet depicted Sallis using a standard [[personal computer]] with up-to-date graphics rather than hard-copy files, an example of the [[floating timeline]] effect.

[[J.M. DeMatteis]] began writing the character in a backup story in ''Man-Thing'' vol. 2, #9 (March 1981), which opened with a fill-in by Dickie McKenzie.<!--He is credited as "Dickie" in the issue--> DeMatteis would go on to write Man-Thing stories in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'', ''[[Defenders (comics)|The Defenders]]'', ''[[Marvel Fanfare]]'', and the [[limited series]] ''Daydreamers'', as well as the eight-issue ''Man-Thing'' vol. 3 (Dec. 1997 - July 1998), illustrated by [[Liam Sharp]]. The two would re-team for the Man-Thing feature in the two-issue ''Strange Tales'' vol. 4 (Sept.-Oct. 1998). Four issues were written, but #3 and 4 were never published. Their stories were summarized briefly in ''[[Peter Parker: Spider-Man]] Annual '99'', also by DeMatteis, with art by Sharp and others.<ref name=ebrandt>[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix2/brandtellenmt.htm Ellen Brandt] at the Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe</ref><ref name=kadmon>[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/spyrosad.htm K'Ad-Mon of the Fallen Stars] at the Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe</ref><ref>[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix2/cleitoatlantismt.htm Cleito] at the Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe</ref>

In the 2000s, Man-Thing has starred in a handful of stories appearing in [[One-shot (comics)|one-shots]] and limited series, including ''Marvel Knights Double Shot'' #2 (July 2002) by [[Ted McKeever]], and ''Legion of Monsters: Man-Thing'' #1 (May 2007) by [[Charlie Huston]] and [[Klaus Janson]].

In 2008, writer [[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa]] retold Man-Thing's origin in ''[[Dead of Night (comics)|Dead of Night]] Featuring Man-Thing'' #1-4 (April–July 2008), from the [[Marvel MAX]] [[imprint]].<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=12531 Aguirre-Sacasa talks "Dead of Night featuring Man-Thing"], [[Comic Book Resources]], February 13, 2008</ref> This was followed by an eight-page story in ''Marvel Comics Presents'' vol. 2, #12 (Oct. 2008), by writer Jai Nitz and artist Ben Stenbeck.

Man-Thing appeared regularly during [[The Punisher]]'s ''[[Franken-Castle]]'' story arc and became a regular member of ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' with issue #144.  The series was retitled ''Dark Avengers'' with #175, and Man-Thing continued to appear as a regular character until issue #183. Steve Gerber's posthumous Man-Thing story ''The Screenplay of the Living Dead Man'', with art by [[Kevin Nowlan]], originally planned as a 1980s graphic novel before being left uncompleted by the artist,<ref name=bigwait>{{cite web | url = http://robot6.comicbookresources.com/2011/09/the-next-big-wait-project-emerges-man-thing-by-gerber-and-nowlan/ | date = September 21, 2011 | first = Chris | last = Arrant | title = The Next Big-Wait Project Emerges: Man-Thing by Gerber and Nowlan | publisher = [[Comic Book Resources]] | accessdate = February 14, 2013 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20120101035505/http://robot6.comicbookresources.com/2011/09/the-next-big-wait-project-emerges-man-thing-by-gerber-and-nowlan/ | archivedate = January 1, 2013 | deadurl = no}}</ref> was revived in the 2010s and appeared as a three-issue miniseries cover-titled ''The Infernal Man-Thing'' (Early Sept.-Oct. 2012).<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/66559/ ''Infernal Man-Thing''] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]</ref> The story was a sequel to Gerber's “Song-Cry of the Living Dead Man” in ''Man-Thing'' #12 (Dec. 1974).<ref name=bigwait />

==Fictional character biography==
Young [[biochemist]] '''Dr. Theodore "Ted" Sallis''', a native of [[Omaha, Nebraska]],<ref>Noted only in ''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe''</ref> is working in the [[Everglades]] as part of Dr. Wilma Calvin's Project: Gladiator team, which includes Dr. [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Barbara Morse]] and her [[fiancé]] Dr. Paul Allen. A Dr. Wendell is later cited as being on the staff after Dr. Calvin is shot.<ref>[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/calvin_wilma.htm Dr. Wilma Calvin] at the Appendix to the Marvel Universe</ref> The group is attempting to recreate the "Super-Soldier Serum" that had created [[Captain America]].{{Issue|date=April 2010}} ''Web of Spider-Man'' vol. 2, #6 revealed that Sallis at one point treated and worked alongside [[Lizard (comics)|Dr. Curt Connors]] shortly after Connors' arm was  amputated, driving the research that would eventually transform Connors into the [[Spider-Man]] foe the Lizard.

Though warned that the technological terrorist group [[Advanced Idea Mechanics]] (AIM) has been operating in the area, Sallis breaches security by bringing with him his lover, [[Ellen Brandt]] (referred to here as "Miss Brandt", but later [[retcon]]ned to be his wife). He destroys his notes to his formula, which he has memorized. Later, he is ambushed and learns Brandt has betrayed him. Fleeing with the only sample of his serum, he injects himself with it in hopes of saving himself. However, he crashes his car into the swamp where chemical and, as ''Man-Thing'' #1 later explained, magical forces instantly transform him into a slow-moving plant-matter creature with large, solid red eyes,<ref>They were yellow in ''Fear'' #10-13, but red in the ''Astonishing Tales'' issues, and all subsequent issues from ''Fear'' #14.</ref> Unable to speak, and with dim memories, he attacks the ambushers and Brandt, burning and scarring part of her face with an acid he now secretes in the presence of violent emotions. The Man-Thing then wanders away into the swamp.<ref name=origin>''Savage Tales'' #1 (May 1971) / ''Astonishing Tales'' #12 (June 1972; Wein/Adams segment</ref>

Sallis' mind was apparently extinguished, although on rare occasions he could briefly return to consciousness within his monstrous form, as in ''Doctor Strange'' vol. 2, #41 (June 1980) and ''Peter Parker: Spider-Man Annual '99'',  and even to his  human form, as in ''Adventure into Fear'' #13 (April 1973), ''Marvel Two-in-One'' #1 (Jan. 1974), ''Marvel Comics Presents'' #164 (Oct. 1994), and ''Man-Thing'' vol. 3, #5, 7, 8 (April, June–July 1998).

Under writer [[Steve Gerber]], the Man-Thing encounters the sorceress [[Jennifer Kale]], with whom he briefly shared a psychic link and who knew his true identity, in a story arc in ''Fear'' #11-13 — the final issue of which established that the swamp had mystical properties as the Nexus of All Realities. Through an interdimensional portal in ''Fear'' #19, he meets [[Howard the Duck]], who becomes stranded in this reality. Man-Thing became the guardian of the nexus, and found himself facing demons, ghosts, and time-traveling warriors, while continuing to encounter such non-supernatural antagonists as rapacious land developers, fascist vigilantes, and common criminals. He formed a bond with young  [[radio DJ]] [[Richard Rory]] and nurse Ruth Hart. Issue #12's "Song-Cry of the Living Dead Man", about institutionalized writer named Brian Lazarus, spawned Gerber's posthumously published 2012 sequel, "The Screenplay of the Living Dead Man", in three-issue miniseries ''The Infernal Man-Thing''.

In ''Man-Thing'' vol. 2 (Nov. 1979 - July 1981), writer [[Chris Claremont]] introduced himself as a character in the final issue, as Gerber had in the finale of the first series. Additionally, Claremont temporarily ''became'' the Man-Thing after being stabbed to death. His and other characters' deaths were later resolved with the intervention of the ''War Is Hell'' series lead, [[John Kowalski (comics)|John Kowalski]], now an aspect of Marvel Comics' manifestation of [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]]. In vol. 3 (Dec. 1997 - July 1998), Ellen Brandt Sallis returns to the Citrusville area, still half-scarred from the Man-Thing's touch. (The existence of the scars contradicts the story in ''Monsters Unleashed'' #5 in which her second husband, Leonard, a plastic surgeon, fixes her.) The Nexus of All Realities has shattered and the Man-Thing must reassemble the pieces with Ellen as his guide. In issue #4, they encounter a little boy,  Job Burke, who is actually the Sallis' son, who had been put up for adoption. Following this series, the story continued in ''Strange Tales'' vol. 4, #2, and was projected to continue in the unpublished issues #3-4. Summaries based on DeMatteis' unillustrated scripts appear on the K'Ad-mon and Ellen Brandt pages on Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe.<ref name=ebrandt /><ref name=kadmon /> The Sallises eventually save the [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|multiverse]] by merging fully with the Nexus.{{issue|date=March 2013}}

During the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' storyline, two [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents are sent to the Everglades to register the Man-Thing with the [[Superhuman Registration Act]]. As the Man-Thing is mentally unfit to sign documents, this is actually a cover for a corrupt S.H.I.E.L.D. boss to take out one disreputable member and put another in his place while he retires on stolen gold. The attempt to destroy Man-Thing fails.<ref name="ReferenceA">''Marvel Comics Presents'' vol. 2, #12</ref> In '' [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' #144, [[Captain America]], operating as Captain Steve Rogers, has the Man-Thing serve as the transportation for the titular team of supervillains attempting to reform. Later, after traveling to the beginning of time and being exposed to the primordial waters, his physical form is restored, and he is now able to speak the Universal Language, which is heard in a comprehensible form by all who hear him.{{issue|date=August 2012}}

==Powers and abilities==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2008}}
Man-Thing is a former scientist who was transformed into a creature composed of vegetable matter through the synergistic interaction of mystical energy and swamp mutagens. Though the beast now lacks a normal human intellect and has shed any desire to communicate with human society, it nevertheless often becomes an accidental hero as it stumbles upon various [[crime fiction|crime]] and [[horror fiction|horror]] scenarios.

In the pages of the Thunderbolts, Dr. Henry Pym has expressed the view that the Man-Thing is sentient, though difficult to communicate with.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #144,</ref> For example, he once rescued an infant and left the child with a doctor (which would require an understanding of the function of a doctor and the ability to navigate to a specific address).<ref>As demonstrated in such issues as ''Fear'' #10, ''Man-Thing'' vol. 2, #9, and ''[[Heroes Reborn]]: The Return'' #1.</ref> He is shown to understand concepts such as how to ring a doorbell,<ref name="Fear #10">''Fear'' #10</ref> how to put an arm in a sling,<ref>''Fear'' #12</ref> and even how to flip an auto-destruct switch.<ref name="Astonishing Tales #13">''Astonishing Tales'' #13</ref> The change in Man-Thing's intellect can partly be explained by fact that its brain, sensory organs, and central nervous system are now organized in a completely different fashion than a human; for instance, Man-Thing's auditory receptors are in his forehead.<ref name="Fear #17">''Fear'' #17</ref> Regardless of what level of humanity the creature still possesses, it can discern when a person's motivations are evil, which causes it pain and motivates it to lash out.<ref>''Fear'' #12; ''Man-Thing'' #1, etc.</ref>

The Man-Thing possesses a variety of superhuman powers, described below, that are derived from the interaction of the scientific formula created by Ted Sallis and the mystical energies of the Nexus of Realities.

It is able to sense human emotions, and is enraged by fear and automatically secretes a poisonous chemical; anyone feeling fear and clutched by the Man-Thing is prone to be burned (either chemically or mystically), hence the series' tag-line, "Whatever knows fear burns at the touch of the Man-Thing." Though fear is understandably most people's response to the creature, both for his monstrous appearance and the physical danger of his touch, typically only villains end up meeting an immolating death at its hands.  Many survive being burned, notably Ellen Brandt,<ref>''Savage Tales'' #1, ''Monsters Unleashed'' #5, ''Man-Thing'' vol. 3, #1-8</ref> [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Kurt "Nightcrawler" Wagner]],<ref>''Nightcrawler'' vol. 3, #10</ref> whom he does not even scar,<ref name="Nightcrawler vol. 3 #12">''Nightcrawler'' vol. 3 #12</ref> and Mongu, whose hand he permanently attaches to his axe,<ref name="Fear #14">''Fear'' #14</ref> either due to intervention or dissipation. Unusual psychic and mystical forces react in what passes as the "brain" cells located throughout his body. These unique forces render the Man-Thing extremely sensitive to emotions. Emotions that are mild and generally considered positive arouse curiosity and the Man-Thing will sometimes observe from a distance. However, emotions that are often viewed as negative, such as violent emotions, rage, anger, hatred, and fear, cause the Man-Thing great discomfort and might provoke him to attack. Once provoked into violent actions, his body secretes highly concentrated acid that can burn human beings to ashes within a matter of seconds. Even individuals that have high levels of superhuman durability have proven unable to withstand this potent acid. While the Man-Thing is devoid of violent emotions, his body produces a type of foamy, soapy mucus that neutralizes the acid.

Although Man-Thing's superhuman strength, speed, intelligence, durability, immortality, give the monster powers it is his spiritual ability that makes him immune to any other disease, it has been established that the creature possesses physical stamina beyond the limitations of any human athlete. Initially, the Man-Thing is only slightly stronger than Captain America,{{Issue|date=April 2009}} but in later appearances, the Man-Thing possesses sufficient superhuman weight to stand toe to toe with much stronger villains.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} He is able to lift a 2,000 pound automobile when sufficiently moved to do so.<ref name="Man-Thing #1">''Man-Thing'' #1</ref>

The Man-Thing's body is practically invulnerable to harm. Because his body is not entirely solid, but composed of the muck and vegetative matter of the swamp, fists, bullets, knives, energy blasts, etc. will either pass entirely through him or will harmlessly be lodged within his body. Even if a vast portion of the Man-Thing's body were to be ripped away or incinerated, he would be able to reorganize himself by drawing the necessary material from the surrounding vegetation. [[Devil-Slayer]] once sliced him nearly in half,<ref>''Man-Thing'' vol. 3, #4</ref> and he has survived being incinerated by a [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]],<ref>''Heroes Reborn: The Return'' #1 / ''Marvel Team-Up'' vol. 2, #4</ref> although his healing from the latter has been the longest and most complex in his lifetime.<ref name=mtu4>''Marvel Team-Up'' vol. 2, #4</ref>

Due to the construction of his body, the Man-Thing is able to ooze his body through openings or around barriers that would seem too small for him to pass though. The smaller the opening, the longer it will take for him to reorganize his mass upon reaching the other side. This ability,<ref>First demonstrated in ''Astonishing Tales'' #13</ref> can be defeated mystically.<ref name="Fear #14"/>

The Man-Thing was once dependent upon the swamp he inhabits for his continued survival; his body would slowly weaken and eventually lapse into dormancy if not returned to the swamp or would be greatly damaged if exposed to clean water. His exposure to the Citrusville waste treatment plant<ref>''Man-Thing'' #17 (May 1975)</ref> greatly enhanced his ability to leave the swamp, as he became a self-contained ecosystem, feeding off his own waste products.<ref>''Man-Thing'' #19</ref> He generally leaves the swamp of his own accord only if he senses a mystical disturbance. Man-Thing has also demonstrated himself susceptible to possession by other entities.<ref>''Defenders'' #98; ''Man-Thing'' vol. 3 #4; Strange Tales vol. 4 #1-2; ''Peter Parker: Spider-Man Annual '99''</ref>

Although the Man-Thing lacks a normal human intellect, in its life as Ted Sallis, it possessed a Ph.D. in biochemistry.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}  Sallis is legally dead, but his identity is known to numerous living people, including Wilma Calvin, Ellen Brandt, Stephen Strange, [[Molecule Man|Owen Reece]], [[Thing (comics)|Ben Grimm]], [[Thog]], and Jennifer Kale, and anyone they may have told. His identity as Man-Thing could not be considered secret, but his existence is generally believed to be a hoax, and an obscure one at that.<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref name=mtu4 /> [[In-universe]], knowledge of his existence is rarely tied to the experiments of Sallis, as are speculations as to any human identity he may have had. Despite having appeared in Citrusville many times, many there still believe him to be a rumor.<ref>''Shadows & Light'' #2; ''Man-Thing'' vol. 3 #1</ref>

==Other Man-Things==
In the pages of ''[[Savage Wolverine]]'' as part of the ''[[Marvel NOW!]]'' event, a different Man-Thing appeared where it resided on a mysterious island somewhere in the [[Savage Land]]. Amadeus Cho confirmed that this Man-Thing isn't Ted Sallis as it has been rooted on the island for a long time. The Neanderthals on the island used the blood of this Man-Thing to resurrect [[Shanna the She-Devil]].<ref>''Savage Wolverine'' #4</ref>

==Comic book spin-offs==
Dr. Barbara Morse was introduced in the second Man-Thing story by Len Wein/Neal Adams, although because of publication delays, she was introduced in ''Astonishing Tales'' #6, with the Wein/Adams story presented as flashback. Morse became the costumed hero [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]] in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #95 and went on to become a prominent member of [[Avengers West Coast]], eventually sacrificing her life to save her husband, [[Hawkeye (comics)|Clint "Hawkeye" Barton]], from [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]].<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #100.</ref>  Until recently, her spirit fought alongside Daimon Hellstrom to eliminate demons from his Hell;<ref>''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' Annual '00; ''Hellcat'' (2000) limited series 1-3</ref> however, she has appeared alive during the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' crossover.{{Issue|date=March 2011}}  At the end of Secret Invasion, Mockingbird was revealed to be alive and had been one of the early captures of the Skrulls.{{Issue|date=March 2011}}  Morse has joined the New Avengers and has had adventures alongside Hawkeye.{{Issue|date=March 2011}}

[[Jennifer Kale]] debuted in ''Fear'' #11, which was the first story Steve Gerber wrote for Marvel after his initial tryout. She went on to appear in two team books, ''[[The Legion of Night]]'', created and written by Gerber and partially composed of several other Gerber-created supporting cast members such as Martin Gold and Dr. Katherine Reynolds, and Bronwyn Carlton and Bryan Walsh's ''[[Witches (Marvel Comics)|Witches]]'' in which she teamed with [[Satana (Marvel Comics)|Satana]] and [[Topaz (Marvel Comics)|Topaz]] under the tutelage of Doctor Strange.

Gerber introduced [[Howard the Duck]] in a Man-Thing story in ''Adventure into Fear'' #19. Howard, who was displaced from a planet of [[anthropomorphics]] in another dimension via the swamp's Nexus of All Realities, later acquired his own series, which was written by Gerber for the first 27 issues.

The [[Foolkiller]], a vigilante who used a ray-gun to disintegrate not only criminals but anyone he considered foolish, was introduced in issue #3 of this series, bent on slaying [[disc jockey]] [[Richard Rory]], introduced in the previous issue. When Rory served time for trumped-up kidnapping charges, he accidentally created another Foolkiller when he revealed too much detail about the previous incarnation and the whereabouts of his gear. This Foolkiller became an occasional villain in other Marvel comics. Both Rory and this second Foolkiller, along with nurse Ruth Hart (who appeared in ''Man-Thing'' # 2-7) were supporting characters in Gerber's ''[[Omega the Unknown]]'', while [[David Anthony Kraft]] made Rory a potential [[love interest]] for [[She-Hulk]]. A third version of the character, who was in [[internet]] communication with the second, starred in Gerber's 1990 ''Foolkiller'' miniseries. A second series by Greg Hurwitz, featuring a fourth Foolkiller, appeared in 2008.

==Other versions==
===The Adventures of the X-Men===
In ''[[X-Men (TV series)#Spin-offs|The Adventures of the X-Men]]'', which is set in the world of the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' [[animated series]] (Earth-921031), [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] and [[Jean Grey]] are inadvertently teleported to Man-Thing's swamp from the [[Mojoverse]]. The three battle [[D'Spayre]], who appears as a fake preacher trying to lead people up a suicide tower that is drawing energy out of the Nexus of All Realities. D'Spayre, working for the [[Dweller-in-Darkness]], is burned by Man-Thing when he fears failure. After their defeat of D'Spayre, Jean makes a psychic link with Man-Thing (which she had done earlier to learn his origin) and is imparted information that she believes is the most important thing in the world. Jean is forced to become the Phoenix once more, using the information obtained from Man-Thing, destroys the [[M'Kraan Crystal]], and in doing so, ends the universe. However, one survivor is sent into the universe to come, [[Galactus]], thereby implying that the animation continuity takes place eons before the mainstream Marvel continuity.<ref>''[[X-Men (TV series)#Spin-offs|The Adventures of the X-Men]]'' #11-12</ref>

===Mutant X===
The ''[[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]]'' comic book series depicts a Marvel Universe in which characters' counterparts are vastly different.

===Earth-691===
''[[Amazing Adventures]]'' volume 2 #38 tells the story of what happened when [[Killraven]] stumbled across the Miami Museum of Cultural Development and became caught up in the projected dreams of an astronaut from the "Mars launch in 1999." During the hallucination, Killraven encountered distorted versions of numerous Marvel characters. Rather ambiguously, the awakened astronaut later described the figures as "all the heroes from my youth" but he also often referred to them as "myths." The only Marvel character that is definitely "real" in the projected nightmare is the Man-Thing who appears as part of an actual memory of an encounter that the astronaut had with the creature in the Florida Everglades.{{issue|date=February 2013}}
