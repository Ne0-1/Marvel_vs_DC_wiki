The '''Man-Thing''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[comics|comic book]] creature created by [[Stan Lee]], [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Gerry Conway]], and featured in various [[Marvel Comics]] titles, the most prominent of which was written by [[Steve Gerber]].

Man-Thing is a large, slow-moving muck-monster with a vaguely humanoid appearance living in the [[Florida]] [[Everglades]] near the [[Seminole (tribe)|Seminole]] [[Indian reservation|reservation]].  Man-Thing debuted a month before a one-shot version of [[DC Comics]]' [[Swamp Thing]], in which Alex Olsen was killed by his wife's lover and resurrected as a plant-based monster.  [[Swamp Thing]] creator [[Len Wein]] was Conway's roommate at the time, but they did not discuss their work too much.  When the ongoing Swamp Thing, Alec Holland, debuted in November (after Wein had contributed a Man-Thing story of his own), his origin was very similar to Man-Thing's.

Unlike the intelligent Swamp Thing, Man-Thing is a former scientist who became a nearly mindless mass of slime with no particular affinity to any living thing, but who nevertheless often becomes an accidental hero as it stumbles upon various [[crime fiction|crime]] and [[horror fiction|horror]] scenarios. It is able to sense human [[emotion]]s, and is enraged by [[fear]] and automatically secretes a strong chemical [[corrosive]]; anyone feeling fear and clutched by the Man-Thing is prone to be burned (either chemically or mystically), hence the series' tag-line, "Whatever knows fear burns at the Man-Thing's touch." Though fear is understandably most people's response to the creature, typically only villains end up meeting an immolating death at its hands.

==Origin==
The Man-Thing first appeared in ''Savage Tales'' #1 (1971), written by Thomas and Conway and illustrated by [[Gray Morrow]]. This story explained the creature's origin, which was roughly similar to [[Swamp Thing]]'s: Betrayed by his lover, Ellen Brandt, [[biochemist]] Ted Sallis, while fleeing from agents from [[Advanced Idea Mechanics]] (AIM) who wanted his formula for a miracle drug (later defined as the "super-soldier serum" used on [[Captain America]]), drowned in the swamp and was transformed into the Man-Thing by a combination of his own formula and (it was later explained) magical forces extant in the area. Sallis's mind was apparently extinguished, although it was later shown that he could briefly return to consciousness within his monstrous form,<ref>''Doctor Strange'' vol. 2 #41</ref> and indeed he has been briefly returned to his human form several times.<ref>''Fear'' #13, ''Marvel Two-in-One'' #1, ''Marvel Comics Presents'' #164</ref>  A story intended for the much-delayed ''Savage Tales'' #2 was ultimately published in ''[[Astonishing Tales]]'' #12, written by [[Len Wein]] (before ''Swamp Thing'' #1).  The story introduced us to Sallis's assistant, an [[elderly]] [[Black (people)|black]] [[scientist]] named [[Dr. Wilma Calvin]].  [[Ka-Zar]] was the featured lead in that issue, written by [[Roy Thomas]], and the story became a flashback, with Ka-Zar meeting Man-Thing at the end of the issue.  In issue #13, also by Thomas, Ka-Zar and Man-Thing destroy the base used by AIM.  Issues #15-20 of ''Astonishing Tales'' (#14 was a colorized and censored reprint of the Ka-Zar story in ''Savage Tales'' #1) deal with Ka-Zar's efforts to destroy the remainder of the serum, aided by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s [[Nick Fury]] and [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Bobbi Morse]], and Dr. Calvin, who by the end, was the only one with a copy of the formula, in her head alone.  The remainder of Ka-Zar's ''Astonishing Tales'' run was written by [[Mike Friedrich]].

==Man-Thing in comics==
{{Spoiler}}

The character next appeared in a story by Conway and Morrow in ''[[Adventure into Fear]]'' #10 (1972), sometimes erroneously said to be a reprint since it had the same authors, which recapped the origin and had Man-Thing rescue a baby and take it to the local physician.  Man-Thing continued to appear in that series for nine more issues, with Steve Gerber taking over as writer starting in #11. 
===Steve Gerber===
Gerber expanded on the notion of the swamp having mystical properties and in issue #14 made it the "Nexus of all Realities", thus supplying numerous demons, ghosts, time-travelling warriors, etc., to serve as the Man-Thing's antagonists&mdash;though he continued to encounter non-supernatural villains as well, including land developers, fascist vigilantes, and common criminals. The ''Fear'' stories introduced a large supporting cast, including the demon [[Thog]] the Nether-Spawn, the benevolent [[Dakimh the Enchanter]], and several humans, including members of the Cult of Zhered-Na (led by [[Jennifer Kale]]'s father, Joshua; Gerber would feature more of Zhered-Na, whom he named after then-girlfriend Edna, in his "Tales of Atlantis" stories in ''[[Sub-Mariner]]'' and in his [[Daimon Hellstrom|Son of Satan]] stories for ''Marvel Spotlight''), who became allies of Dakimh and the Man-Thing, thus circumventing the difficulty of having a protagonist with no mind and no goals.  A major villain named Franklin Armstrong Schist ([[F.A. Schist]]) was introduced in issue 16, attempting to build an airport in Citrusville.  The Man-Thing series in ''Fear'' ended in a cliffhanger to introduce Man-Thing's own series in issue #19, a bizarre story involving Thog with characters from all times and places (including, briefly, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] and the [[Black Widow (comics)|Black Widow]]).  In one particularly bizarre scene, Korrek, Warrior Prince of Katharta, emerges from a jar of peanut butter partially eaten by Andy Kale, with a knife that becomes his sword!  After that, Gerber needing something even weirder to join the forces of good, a talking duck named [[Howard the Duck|Howard]] soon stepped onto the scene.  Dakimh declares Man-Thing, Jennifer, Korrek, and Howard to be part of a chosen five need to defeat Thog, though Howard stumbles and disappears and Man-Thing does much of the task himself.

Beginning in January 1974, Gerber wrote his own ''Man-Thing'' series for Marvel, illustrated mostly by [[Val Mayerik]] at first and later [[Mike Ploog]], [[John Buscema]] and [[Jim Mooney]]. The series became Marvel's chief non-[[superhero]] fantasy title, and — again like DC's Swamp Thing — was flexible enough to accommodate horror, [[fantasy]], [[science fiction]], crime, and occasional [[fictional crossovers|crossovers]] with superhero characters. 
The first story arc after concluding the cliffhanger introduced us to [[Richard Rory]] and [[Ruth Hart]], and the first concerted attempt by F.A. Schist to destroy the creature.  In the following issue, we learnt Rory was fleeing the [[Foolkiller]].  Ruth, a nurse involved with a biker gang slain by the Foolkiller soon left for [[New York City]] without Rory<note>see ''[[Omega the Unknown]]''</note>, who continued to deal with the strange forces in the swamp, and formed a bond with Man-Thing.

In ''Man-Thing'' #7, reality set in and the [[energy crisis]] prevented F.A. Schist from completing his airport.  The reason for the airport was then revealed: Schist wanted to find the [[Fountain of Youth]].  Unfortunately, he learned the hard way that the desired effects of the fountain's water come from bathing in it, not drinking it, and with a newly fragile body, was done in by Man-Thing.

Gerber also wrote five longer issues of a parallel series, ''Giant-Size Man-Thing'', whose apparently unintentional [[double-entendre]] title became a common joke among comics readers (a "giant-size" comic is one with more pages than a standard comic book).  The first issue introduced the [[Cult of Entropy]], who would later be foes of the [[Incredible Hulk]] and Howard the Duck, even reaching the latter's newspaper strip.  In the second issue, Schist's widow and daughter arrange to have the Man-Thing captured, but he escapes and runs amok in [[Manhattan]].  The third issue featured the death of Dakimh's physical form, though his spirit would continue to appear, while the fourth began the solo adventures of Howard the Duck.  In the fifth issue, we see that Ted Sallis had prior knowledge of his future as Man-Thing from a [[fortune teller]], who outraged him rather than making him pay heed.

In one story (#13&ndash;14), an astral pirate ship headed by Captain Fate, ended up in the Nexus.  A scientist, Dr. Maura Spinner, was the [[reincarnation]] of a pirate queen and both were linked with a [[satyr]] named Khordes.  In a controversial ending which Gerber expressed regrets about having written, Spinner stayed with Khordes.

Soon, Gerber was delving into Ted Sallis's past.  In a text story in ''[[Monsters Unleashed]]'' #8 and #9, Sallis was revealed to have slept with an underage girl, whose father sought to kill the current occupant of his shack.  In ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]'' #108, Gerber introduced [[Foggy Nelson]]'s sister Candace, who was being harassed over research she was doing at Empire State University.  In issue #113, this was revealed to be the ''Sallis Papers'', research that could have turned the human race into smog-breathing monsters and allow industry to proceed unchecked.  In ''Man-Thing'' #15, we are introduced to Sainte-Cloud, a young woman who helped Sallis decide to abandon the project.  Sometimes this has been erroneously cited as the project that created Man-Thing, though it is made clear in the stories that this is an earlier project.

The final arc of the Gerber series (16, GS4, 17-22) dealt with a [[hypermasculinity|hypermasculine]] laborer named Sorensen forced into [[retirement]] at age 65.  He went on a rampage as a Mad Viking, killed his daughter Astrid's artist boyfriend, and allied himself with Olivia Selby, who led a bookburning riot at Citrusville High School, leading to the slaughter of several teachers.  Man-Thing's involvement led to him being dumped in the local sewage treatment plant, which only increased his ability to leave the swamp, while Richard Rory got fired by the local radio station for speaking out against the book burning on air. Rory attempted to leave for [[Atlanta]], and Man-Thing and Carol Selby, Olivia's daughter, demanded to go with him.  In Atlanta, they met Robert Nicolle, a man with neither feeling nor physical sensation, who appeared as the costumed criminal the Scavenger, whose sister, Dani Nicolle, has her sensations on overload and must project them into objects called Nightmare Boxes.

''Man-Thing'' #22 was the last of the series, and justified its end with an unusual device: Gerber appeared as a character in the story, and admitted that he had not been inventing the Man-Thing's adventures but simply reporting on them. After witnessing the near-end of the universe&mdash;in which the minds of everyone except Gerber, Dakimh, and Thog (who was attempting to control the universe with a pyramid of Dani's Nightmare Boxes) were destroyed but then restored&mdash;Gerber decided he had to move on to other things. Gerber continued to write cameo appearances for the Man-Thing in other Marvel titles, including [[The Evolutionary War]] crossover, in which Man-Thing came to the aid of [[Spider-Man]], and a 12-part Man-Thing serial in the anthology series ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'', through 1989, which was largely a commentary on the [[Iran-Contra]] scandal, and the most violent and graphic Man-Thing story then published.

===Michael Fleischer===
A second ''Man-Thing'' series began in November 1979, written by [[Michael Fleisher]] and later, [[Chris Claremont]], and illustrated by [[Jim Mooney]] and [[Don Perlin]].

Fleischer introduced a scientist, Dr. Oheimer, who attempted to restore Ted Sallis's mind, now scattered about in [[Ganglion|ganglia]] throughout Man-Thing's body.  A series of plot holes lead to the end of the project and Dr. Oheimer's death, and a negative result was predicted in [[What If (comics)|What If]] Vol. 1, #26.  The next issue introduced a melodramatic love triangle that took Man-Thing to the [[Himalayas]].  Fleischer's work received a great deal of negative criticism and he was taken off the book.[reference]

===Chris Claremont===
Chris Claremont began writing the series with issue #4 (the story which was concluded in ''[[Doctor Strange]]'' vol. 2, #41, to tie it with a series he was already writing), after previously working with the character in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #68, in which he introduced a concept many fans found ludicrous:  certain supernatural creatures, in this case, [[D'Spayre]], who appeared for the first time in that issue, could cause Man-Thing to feel fear and [[spontaneously combust]].  This concept appeared again, with much severer effects, in ''What If'' #26 and ''Heroes Reborn:  The Return'' #1.  Many found [[Tom Peyer]]'s revival of the character, in his following appearance, ''Marvel Team-Up'' vol. 2 #4, after his apparent destruction in ''Heroes Reborn'', to be quite awkward.

As Gerber had kept the focus on his own original characters, Claremont's arc focused on newly-orphaned upper-class cheerleader Bobbie Bannister and Citrusville Sheriff John Daltry.  The series lasted through issue #11, in which Claremont not only introduced himself as a character as Gerber had, but, after being stabbed to death by John Daltry (possessed by the sword of Captain Fate), temporarily ''became'' the Man-Thing.  The temporary deaths of all the characters, including [[Dr. Strange]], guided by a version of Claremont's earlier character, [[John Kowalski (comics)|John Kowalski]], now an aspect of [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]], resolved the issue.  At about the same time, Claremont gave Man-Thing a guest appearance in ''[[The Uncanny X-Men]]'' #144, which re-introduced D'Spayre as a major [[X-Men]] foe.  Ironically, Steve Gerber would later tie D'Spayre to the origin of [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]].  Claremont also misspelled Gerber's first name as "Steven" in Dakimh's dialogue in issue #11.

===J.M. DeMatteis===
[[J.M. DeMatteis]] began writing the character in a backup story in ''Man-Thing'' Vol. 2, #9, which opened with a fill-in by [[Richard McKenzie|Dickie McKenzie]]<!--He is credited as "Dickie" in the issue-->.  After writing him in ''Marvel Team-Up'', ''[[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]'', sporadic stories in ''Marvel Fanfare'', and the [[limited series]], ''[[Daydreamers]]'', DeMatteis wrote a third series with the character in 1997, illustrated by [[Liam Sharp]], for eight issues, the two-issue ''[[Strange Tales]]'' volume 5, and ''[[Peter Parker: Spider-Man]]'' Annual '99.  His series returned to the beginning, bringing Ellen Brandt back into the story, half of her face hideously scarred by Man-Thing on their first encounter (apparently ignoring [[Tony Isabella]]'s story in ''[[Monsters Unleashed]]'' #5).  Man-Thing was also reunited with Howard the Duck, met [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]], again incorporating the Zhered-Na mythos, and finally united Ellen and Ted with [[K'Ad-Mon]], revealed to be Spyros, from Gerber's [[Daimon Hellstrom|Son of Satan]] arc in ''[[Marvel Spotlight]]'', who is in fact the Biblical [[Adam]].

===Other Appearances===
Man-Thing also appeared as a cameo in issue #19 ("Retreat" by [[Steve Englehart]] and [[Paul Gulacy]]) of the [[martial arts]] comic book ''[[Master of Kung Fu]]'', which starred [[Shang-Chi]], the son of [[Fu Manchu]]. Man-Thing was accompanied by a man called Lu Sun who looked after him. The Man-Thing saved Lu Sun and Shang-Chi from Fu Manchu's assassins when Shang-Chi fell into a sandpit trap. The assassins died from being burned by Man-Thing when they attacked him while feeling fear.

By the time Man-Thing appeared in ''Hulk'' #4, K'Ad-Mon had apparently left.  What happened to Ellen Brandt is unclear.

In one of the earliest [[What If (comics)|What If...?]] storylines, several issues were devoted to the question of "What if the [[Fantastic Four|Fantastic 4]] all received the same powers?" (such as all of them being able to control fire). During the story where they all became "Things", [[Invisible Woman|Susan Storm]] became a mute monstrosity that appeared nearly identical to the Man-Thing.

==Superhuman abilities==
The Man-Thing possesses a variety of superhuman powers that are derived from the interaction of the scientific formula created by Ted Sallis and the mystical energies of the Nexus of Realities.

Man-Thing's superhuman strength varies considerably in his comic book appearances.  Initially, the Man-Thing is only slightly stronger than Captain America, but in later appearances, the Man-Thing possesses sufficient superhuman strength to stand toe to toe with much stronger villains.

The Man-Thing's body is practically invulnerable to harm.  Because his body is not entirely solid, but composed of the muck and vegetative matter of the swamp, fists, bullets, knives, energy blasts, etc. will either pass entirely through him or will harmlessly be lodged within his body.  Even if a vast portion of the Man-Thing's body were to be ripped away or incinerated, he would be able to reorganize himself by drawing the necessary material from the surrounding vegetation.

The Man-Thing is also able to ooze his body through openings or around barriers that would seem too small for him to pass though.  The smaller the opening, the longer it will take for him to reorganize his mass upon reaching the other side.

Unusual psychic and mystical forces react in what passes as the "brain" cells located throughout his body.  These unique forces render the Man-Thing extremely sensitive to emotions.  Emotions that are mild and generally considered positive arouse curiosity and the Man-Thing will sometimes observe from a distance.  However, emotions that are often viewed as negative, such as violent emotions, rage, anger, hatred and fear, cause the Man-Thing great discomfort and might provoke him to attack. Once provoked into violent actions, his body secretes highly concentrated sulfuric acid that can burn human beings to ashes within a matter of seconds.  Even individuals that have high levels of superhuman durability have proven unable to withstand this potent acid (except, perhaps the Hulk.)  While the Man-Thing is devoid of violent emotions, his body produces a type of foamy, soapy mucus that neutralizes the acid.

The Man-Thing is dependent upon the swamp he inhabits for his continued survival.  He is able to leave the swamp, and has done so on many occasions, sometimes for a considerable length of time.  However, his body will slowly weaken and eventually lapse into dormancy if not returned to the swamp or exposed to clean water.  His exposure to the Citrusville waste treatment plant (in Vol. 1, #17) greatly enhanced his ability to leave the swamp.

==Ultimate Man-Thing==
In his first [[Ultimate Marvel]] appearance, Man-Thing teamed with [[Spider-Man]] in ''Ultimate Marvel Team Up'' #10, unwittingly saving the superhero from Ultimate [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]]. Additionally, in ''Ultimate Fantastic Four'' #7, during a flashback that transformed Reed and his colleagues into the Fantastic Four, the Man-Thing is shown for a moment. It has been hypothesized that Man-Thing and the FF share some elemental bound, being as they are representations of earth (Thing), fire (Human Torch), water (Mr. Fantastic), and air (Invisible Woman). Alternatively, this is perhaps just a reference to the aforementioned ''What If...?'' issue.

Ultimate Man-Thing is similar to his traditional counterpart and seems to share the same abilities and possibly origin.

==Mutant X==
The ''[[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]]'' comic book series depicts a Marvel Universe in which characters' counterparts are vastly different. In the ''Mutant X '99'' annual, [[Dr. Strange]], the sorcerer supreme of Earth, reveals himself to be the Man-Thing.

==Comic book spin-offs==
Gerber introduced [[Howard the Duck]] in a Man-Thing story in ''Adventure into Fear'' #19. Howard, who was displaced from a planet of [[anthropomorphics]] in another dimension via the swamp's Nexus of All Realities, later acquired his own series.

The [[Foolkiller]], a vigilante who used a ray-gun to disintegrate not only criminals but anyone he considered foolish, was introduced in issue #3 of this series, bent on slaying [[disc jockey]] [[Richard Rory]], introduced in the previous issue. When Rory served time for trumped-up kidnapping charges, he accidentally created another Foolkiller when he revealed too much detail about the previous incarnation and the whereabouts of his gear. This Foolkiller became an occasional villain in other Marvel comics. Both Rory and this second Foolkiller, along with nurse Ruth Hart (who appeared in ''Man-Thing'' # 2-5) were supporting characters in Gerber's ''[[Omega the Unknown]]'', while [[David Anthony Kraft]] made Rory a potential love interest for [[She-Hulk]].  A third version of the character, who was in [[internet]] communication with the second, starred in Gerber's [[1990]] ''Foolkiller'' miniseries.

==Film==
A ''[[Man-Thing (film)|Man-Thing]]'' [[telefilm]], directed by [[Brett Leonard]] and based loosely on a Gerber storyline involving the unscrupulous land developer F.A. Schist, appeared on the [[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi Channel]] in 2005 under the [[Sci Fi Channel (United States)#Sci Fi Pictures original movies|Sci Fi Pictures]] label.

The Man-Thing has often been described as Marvel's attempt to imitate the similar and more famous [[DC Comics]] character [[Swamp Thing]], but this is unlikely given that both debuted within a few months of one another, Man-Thing, in fact, appearing first. Gerry Conway and Len Wein were good friends and roommates at the time that they created both Man-Thing and Swamp-Thing. They merely took their ideas to different comics.  Further discrediting the idea that Man-Thing is an imitation of Swamp Thing is the fact that Len Wein wrote the second Man-Thing story before he wrote the first story of the ongoing Swamp Thing, although its publication was severely delayed and appeared afterwards, after a change in the [[Comics Code]] allowed the more brutal nature of Man-Thing to appear in a color comic.

A predecessor of both was [[Hillman Publications]]' the [[The Heap (comics)|Heap]], who debuted in what was intended as a one-time appearance in the feature "[[Skywolf]]" in ''[[Air Fighters]]'' #3 (Dec. 1942). Created by writer [[Harry Stein]] and artist [[Mort Leav]], the Heap became a popular character in return appearances and later an ongoing solo feature. Early depictions of the Heap look highly similar to the [[Looney Tunes]]/[[Merrie Melodies]] character [[Gossamer (Looney Tunes)|Gossamer]], a orange-furred, practically featureless monster in [[sneakers]] who menaced [[Bugs Bunny]] in the 1946 [[animated short]] "Hair-Raising Hare" before going on to other appearances (named "Rudolph" in one).

A literary predecessor was the title creature of "It", a [[Theodore Sturgeon]] [[short story]] that first appeared in the [[pulp magazine]] "Unknown" in 1940.
