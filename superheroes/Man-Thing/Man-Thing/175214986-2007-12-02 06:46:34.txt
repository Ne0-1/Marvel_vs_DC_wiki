The '''Man-Thing''' is a [[fictional character]] in the {{Marvel Universe}}, created by writers [[Stan Lee]], [[Roy Thomas]], and [[Gerry Conway]] and artist [[Gray Morrow]] in ''[[Savage Tales]]'' #1 (May 1971). He went on to be the protagonist of a feature in various titles and of his own series. The most prominent, ''Man-Thing'' vol. 1, written primarily by [[Steve Gerber]], introduced the popular character [[Howard the Duck]]. Man-Thing was the star of a namesake 2005 [[TV-movie]].

Man-Thing is a large, slow-moving, vaguely humanoid creature living in the [[Florida]] [[Everglades]] near the [[Seminole (tribe)|Seminole]] [[Indian reservation|reservation]].  

==Publication history==
Following the Man-Thing's 11-page debut in the black-and-white adventure-fantasy magazine ''Savage Tales'' #1 (May 1971), the character next appeared as an antagonist of Marvel's jungle-lord hero [[Ka-Zar]] in a two-part story in ''[[Astonishing Tales]]'' #12-13 (June-Aug. 1972). Man-Thing received his own 10-page feature shortly thereafter, beginning in ''[[Adventure into Fear]]'' #10 (Oct. 1972), sharing that anthological title with reprinted 1950s [[horror fiction|horror]]/[[fantasy]] stories. Steve Gerber, who would become Man-Thing's most prominent writer, succeeded Conway the following issue. The feature expanded to 15 pages with #12, became 16 pages two issues later, and reached the standard 19-page length of Marvel [[superhero]] comics with issue #15. After issue #19 (Dec. 1973), Man-Thing received his own solo title, which ran 22 issues (Jan. 1974 - Oct. 1975). A sister publication was the quarterly ''Giant-Size Man-Thing'' #1-5 (Aug. 1974 - Aug. 1975), which featured 1950s horror-fantasy and 1960s [[science fiction]]/monster reprints as back-up stories, with a [[Howard the Duck]] feature added in the final two issues. The fifth issue was a prequel, with [[Madame Swabada]] showing Ted Sallis (with Ellen Brandt) his future as Man-Thing, including stories by writers other than Gerber in a Gerber frame, with Gerber also writing the first story). Following Morrow, the main series' primary [[pencilers]] were, successively, [[Val Mayerik]], [[Mike Ploog]], [[John Buscema]], and [[Jim Mooney]].

In the final issue, writer Gerber appeared as a character in the story, claiming he had not been inventing the Man-Thing's adventures but simply reporting on them and that he had decided to move on. Gerber continued to write Man-Thing guest appearances in other Marvel titles, as well as the serialized, eight-page Man-Thing feature in the omnibus series ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'' #1-12 (Sept. 1988 - Feb. 1989).

A second ''Man-Thing'' series ran 11 issues (Nov. 1979 - Jan. 1981). Writer [[Michael Fleisher]] and penciller Mooney teamed for the first three issues, with the letters page of #3 noting that Fleischer's work had received a great deal of negative criticism and that he had been taken off the book. He was succeeded by, primarily, writer [[Chris Claremont]] and illustrators [[Don Perlin]] (breakdowns) and [[Bob Wiacek]] (finished pencils).

[[J.M. DeMatteis]] began writing the character in a backup story in ''Man-Thing'' vol. 2, #9, which opened with a fill-in by [[Richard McKenzie|Dickie McKenzie]]<!--He is credited as "Dickie" in the issue-->.  DeMatteis would go on to write Man-Thing stories in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'', ''[[Defenders (comics)|The Defenders]]'', ''Marvel Fanfare'', and the [[limited series]] ''[[Daydreamers]]'', as well as the eight-issue ''Man-Thing'' vol. 3 (Dec. 1997 - July 1998), illustrated by [[Liam Sharp]]. The two would re-team for the Man-Thing feature in the two-issue ''Strange Tales''vol. 3 (Sept.-Oct. 1998).

In the 2000s, Man-Thing has starred in a handful of stories appearing in [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]]s and limited series, including ''Marvel Knights Double Shot'' #2 (July 2002) and ''Legion of Monsters: Man-Thing'' #1 (May 2007).

Marvel has announced in the MAX Preview that [[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa]] will be writing a revamped Man-Thing storyline in ''[[Dead of Night (comics)|Dead of Night]]'' (vol. 2), hosted by [[Digger (comics)|Digger]].  Aguirre-Sacasa previously gave the character a cameo in ''[[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]'' vol. 3.

==Fictional character biography==
{{comics-in-universe}}
Ted Sallis, a native of [[Omaha, Nebraska]], is a [[biochemist]] working in the [[Everglades]] who develops a "miracle drug" later defined as an attempt at recreating the "super-soldier serum" that created [[Captain America]]. Betrayed by his lover, Ellen Brandt, Sallis flees from agents from [[Advanced Idea Mechanics]] (AIM), who covet his formula and research. He injects himself with the serum, but after crashing in a swamp and apparently drowning is transformed into a swamp creature through a combination of his formula and (it was later explained) magical forces extant in the area. Sallis' mind was apparently extinguished, although it was later shown that he could briefly return to consciousness within his monstrous form,<ref>''Doctor Strange'' vol. 2 #41</ref> and indeed he has been briefly returned to his human form several times.<ref>''Fear'' #13, ''Marvel Two-in-One'' #1, ''Marvel Comics Presents'' #164</ref>     Sallis's assistant, introduced later, was an [[elderly]] [[African-American]] [[scientist]], [[Dr. Wilma Calvin]]. Also later, Man-Thing and [[Ka-Zar]] together destroy the local AIM base.

Gerber expanded on the notion of the swamp having mystical properties and in issue #14 made it the "Nexus of all Realities", thus supplying numerous demons, ghosts, time-traveling warriors, etc., to serve as the Man-Thing's antagonists&mdash;though he continued to encounter non-supernatural villains as well, including land developers, fascist vigilantes, and common criminals. The ''Fear'' stories introduced a large supporting cast, including the demon [[Thog]] the Nether-Spawn, the benevolent [[Dakimh the Enchanter]], and several humans, including members of the Cult of Zhered-Na (led by [[Jennifer Kale]]'s father, Joshua; Gerber would feature more of Zhered-Na, whom he named after then-girlfriend Edna, in his "Tales of Atlantis" stories in ''[[Sub-Mariner]]'' and in his [[Daimon Hellstrom|Son of Satan]] stories for ''Marvel Spotlight''), who became allies of Dakimh and the Man-Thing, thus circumventing the difficulty of having a protagonist with no mind and no goals.  A major villain named Franklin Armstrong Schist ([[F.A. Schist]]) was introduced in issue 16, attempting to build an airport in [[Citrusville]].  The Man-Thing series in ''Fear'' ended in a cliffhanger to introduce Man-Thing's own series in issue #19, a bizarre story involving Thog with characters from all times and places (including, briefly, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] and the [[Black Widow (comics)|Black Widow]]).  In one particularly bizarre scene, [[Korrek]], Warrior Prince of Katharta, emerges from a jar of peanut butter partially eaten by Andy Kale, with a knife that becomes his sword!  After that, Gerber needing something even weirder to join the forces of good, a talking duck named [[Howard the Duck|Howard]] soon stepped onto the scene.  Dakimh declares Man-Thing, Jennifer, Korrek, and Howard to be part of a chosen five need to defeat Thog, though Howard stumbles and disappears and Man-Thing does much of the task himself.

The first story arc after concluding the cliffhanger introduced us to [[Richard Rory]] and [[Ruth Hart]], and the first concerted attempt by F.A. Schist to destroy the creature.  In the following issue, we learnt Rory was fleeing the [[Foolkiller]].  Ruth, a nurse involved with a biker gang slain by the Foolkiller soon left for [[New York City]] without Rory,<ref>see ''[[Omega the Unknown]]''</ref> who continued to deal with the strange forces in the swamp, and formed a bond with Man-Thing.

In ''Man-Thing'' #7, reality set in and the [[energy crisis]] prevented F.A. Schist from completing his airport.  The reason for the airport was then revealed: Schist wanted to find the [[Fountain of Youth]].  Unfortunately, he learned the hard way that the desired effects of the fountain's water come from bathing in it, not drinking it, and with a newly fragile body, was done in by Man-Thing.

Gerber also wrote five longer issues of a parallel series, ''Giant-Size Man-Thing'', whose unintentional [[double entendre]] title became a common joke among comics' readers (a "giant-size" comic is one with more pages than a standard comic book).  The first issue introduced the [[Cult of Entropy]], who would later be foes of the [[Incredible Hulk]] and Howard the Duck, even reaching the latter's newspaper strip.  In the second issue, Schist's widow and daughter arrange to have the Man-Thing captured, but he escapes and runs amok in [[Manhattan]].  The third issue featured the death of Dakimh's physical form, though his spirit would continue to appear, while the fourth began the solo adventures of Howard the Duck.  In the fifth issue, we see that Ted Sallis had prior knowledge of his future as Man-Thing from a [[fortune teller]], who outraged him rather than making him pay heed.

In one story (#13&ndash;14), an astral pirate ship headed by [[Captain Fate]], ended up in the Nexus.  A scientist, Dr. Maura Spinner, was the [[reincarnation]] of a pirate queen and both were linked with a [[satyr]] named Khordes.  In a controversial ending which Gerber expressed regrets about having written, Spinner stayed with Khordes.

Soon, Gerber was delving into Ted Sallis's past.  In a text story in ''[[Monsters Unleashed]]'' #8 and #9, Sallis was revealed to have slept with an underage girl, whose father sought to kill the current occupant of his shack.  In ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]'' #108, Gerber introduced [[Foggy Nelson]]'s sister Candace, who was being harassed over research she was doing at [[Empire State University]].  In issue #113, this was revealed to be the ''Sallis Papers'', research that could have turned the human race into smog-breathing monsters and allow industry to proceed unchecked.  In ''Man-Thing'' #15, we are introduced to Sainte-Cloud, a young woman who helped Sallis decide to abandon the project.  Sometimes this has been erroneously cited as the project that created Man-Thing, though it is made clear in the stories that this is an earlier project.

The final arc of the Gerber series (16, GS4, 17-22) dealt with a [[hypermasculinity|hypermasculine]] laborer named Sorensen forced into [[retirement]] at age 65.  He went on a rampage as a Mad Viking, killed his daughter Astrid's artist boyfriend, and allied himself with Olivia Selby, who led a [[book burning]] riot at Citrusville High School, leading to the slaughter of several teachers.  Man-Thing's involvement led to him being dumped in the local sewage treatment plant, which only increased his ability to leave the swamp, while Richard Rory got fired by the local radio station for speaking out against the book burning on air. Rory attempted to leave for [[Atlanta]], and Man-Thing and Carol Selby, Olivia's daughter, demanded to go with him.  In Atlanta, they met Robert Nicolle, a man with neither feeling nor physical sensation, who appeared as the costumed criminal the Scavenger, whose sister, Dani Nicolle, has her sensations on overload and must project them into objects called Nightmare Boxes.

A scientist, Dr. Oheimer, attempted to restore Ted Sallis's mind, now scattered about in [[Ganglion|ganglia]] throughout Man-Thing's body.  A love triangle then took Man-Thing to the [[Himalayas]]. Chris Claremont, the writer by this point, introduced himself as a character in the final issue of Volume 2, as Steve Gerber had in the finale of Volume 1. Additionally, Claremont temporarily ''became'' the Man-Thing after being stabbed to death by a possessed Sheriff John Daltry. His and other characters' deaths were later resolved with the intervention of the ''War is Hell'' series lead, [[John Kowalski (comics)|John Kowalski]], now an aspect of Marvel Comics' manifestation of [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]]. Man-Thing later appeared briefly alongside the superhero  [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], aiding him in a battle against the supernatural villain [[D'Spayre]].

==Powers and abilities==
Man-Thing is a former scientist who became a nearly mindless mass of slime with no particular affinity to any living thing, but who nevertheless often becomes an accidental hero as it stumbles upon various [[crime fiction|crime]] and [[horror fiction|horror]] scenarios. It is able to sense human [[emotion]]s, and is enraged by [[fear]] and automatically secretes a strong chemical [[corrosive]]; anyone feeling fear and clutched by the Man-Thing is prone to be burned (either chemically or mystically), hence the series' tag-line, "Whatever knows fear burns at the Man-Thing's touch." Though fear is understandably most people's response to the creature, typically only villains end up meeting an immolating death at its hands.

The Man-Thing possesses a variety of superhuman powers that are derived from the interaction of the scientific formula created by Ted Sallis and the mystical energies of the Nexus of Realities.

Man-Thing's superhuman strength varies considerably in his comic book appearances.  Initially, the Man-Thing is only slightly stronger than Captain America, but in later appearances, the Man-Thing possesses sufficient superhuman strength to stand toe to toe with much stronger villains.

The Man-Thing's body is practically invulnerable to harm.  Because his body is not entirely solid, but composed of the muck and vegetative matter of the swamp, fists, bullets, knives, energy blasts, etc. will either pass entirely through him or will harmlessly be lodged within his body.  Even if a vast portion of the Man-Thing's body were to be ripped away or incinerated, he would be able to reorganize himself by drawing the necessary material from the surrounding vegetation.

The Man-Thing is also able to ooze his body through openings or around barriers that would seem too small for him to pass though.  The smaller the opening, the longer it will take for him to reorganize his mass upon reaching the other side.

Unusual psychic and mystical forces react in what passes as the "brain" cells located throughout his body.  These unique forces render the Man-Thing extremely sensitive to emotions.  Emotions that are mild and generally considered positive arouse curiosity and the Man-Thing will sometimes observe from a distance.  However, emotions that are often viewed as 
negative, such as violent emotions, rage, anger, hatred and fear, cause the Man-Thing great discomfort and might provoke him to attack. Once provoked into violent actions, his body secretes highly concentrated sulfuric acid that can burn human beings to ashes within a matter of seconds.  Even individuals that have high levels of superhuman durability have proven unable to withstand this potent acid (except, perhaps the Hulk.)  While the Man-Thing is devoid of violent emotions, his body produces a type of foamy, soapy mucus that neutralizes the acid.

The Man-Thing is dependent upon the swamp he inhabits for his continued survival.  He is able to leave the swamp, and has done so on many occasions, sometimes for a considerable length of time.  However, his body will slowly weaken and eventually lapse into dormancy if not returned to the swamp or exposed to clean water.  His exposure to the Citrusville waste treatment plant (in Vol. 1, #17) greatly enhanced his ability to leave the swamp.

==Comic book spin-offs==
Gerber introduced [[Howard the Duck]] in a Man-Thing story in ''Adventure into Fear'' #19. Howard, who was displaced from a planet of [[anthropomorphics]] in another dimension via the swamp's Nexus of All Realities, later acquired his own series.

The [[Foolkiller]], a vigilante who used a ray-gun to disintegrate not only criminals but anyone he considered foolish, was introduced in issue #3 of this series, bent on slaying [[disc jockey]] [[Richard Rory]], introduced in the previous issue. When Rory served time for trumped-up kidnapping charges, he accidentally created another Foolkiller when he revealed too much detail about the previous incarnation and the whereabouts of his gear. This Foolkiller became an occasional villain in other Marvel comics. Both Rory and this second Foolkiller, along with nurse Ruth Hart (who appeared in ''Man-Thing'' # 2-5) were supporting characters in Gerber's ''[[Omega the Unknown]]'', while [[David Anthony Kraft]] made Rory a potential [[love interest]] for [[She-Hulk]].  A third version of the character, who was in [[internet]] communication with the second, starred in Gerber's 1990 ''Foolkiller'' miniseries.

===Mutant X===
The ''[[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]]'' comic book series depicts a Marvel Universe in which characters' counterparts are vastly different. In the ''Mutant X '99'' annual, [[Dr. Strange]], the sorcerer supreme of Earth, reveals himself to be the Man-Thing. He would later be part of the final battle against the [[Beyonder]], which threatens all realities, even going so far as to recruit [[Baron Mordo]], who here is the Ancient One and [[Reed Richards]], who had been evil for some time.  The Man-Thing Doctor Strange also appear in Mutant X Annual '01 and Mutant X #32.

===Ultimate Man-Thing===
In his first [[Ultimate Marvel]] appearance, Man-Thing teamed with [[Spider-Man]] in ''Ultimate Marvel Team Up'' #10, unwittingly saving the superhero from Ultimate [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]]. Additionally, in ''Ultimate Fantastic Four'' #7, during a flashback that transformed Reed and his colleagues into the Fantastic Four, the Man-Thing is shown for a moment. It has been hypothesized that Man-Thing and those affected by the N-Zone share some elemental bond, being as they are representations of earth (Thing), fire (Human Torch), water (Mr. Fantastic), air (Invisible Woman), and metal (Dr Doom). 

Ultimate Man-Thing is similar to his traditional counterpart.

===''What If''===
The second story in the [[alternate-reality]] [[anthology]] ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'' #26 (April 1981) asked, "What if the Man-Thing had Regained Ted Sallis' Brain?" Written by [[Steven Grant]], with art by [[penciler]] [[Herb Trimpe]] and [[inker]] [[Bob Wiacek]]. ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'' vol. 2, #11 (March 1990) featured the [[Fantastic Four]] in four scenarios written and penciled by [[Jim Valentino]], showing what might have happened if the team-members had all had the same powers as one another. In "What if the Fantastic Four had All Become Monsters Like the Thing?", [[Sue Storm]]'s appearance was that of the Man-Thing. In this form she had lost all but her very basic intelligence and could no longer speak.

==Film==
{{main|Man-Thing (film)}}
''Man-Thing'', a [[TV-movie]] directed by [[Brett Leonard]] and written by [[Hans Rodinoff]], premiered on the U.S. [[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi Channel]], under the [[Sci Fi Channel (United States)#Sci Fi Pictures original movies|Sci Fi Pictures]] label, on April 30, 2005.<ref name="cbm">[http://www.comicbookmovie.com/news/articles/1757.asp  ComicBookMovie.com (March 8, 2005): "Man-Thing Web Page is Online", by Bob Gough]</ref> <ref>[http://www.toonopedia.com/manthing.htm Don Markstein's Toonopedia: Man-Thing]</ref> An uncut version appeared on DVD June 14, 2005.<ref name="cbm" />. Produced by the studio [[Lionsgate]], it is based loosely on a [[Steve Gerber]] storyline involving the unscrupulous land developer F.A. Schist.{{Fact|date=May 2007}} Three characters are named after some of the original comics' creators: [[Robert Mammone]] as "[[Mike Ploog]]", [[William Zappa]] as "Steve Gerber", and director Leonard himself as "[[Val Mayerik]]" (misspelled "Mayerick" in the credits).

The Man-Thing has often been described as Marvel's attempt to imitate the similar and more famous [[DC Comics]] character [[Swamp Thing]], but this is unlikely given that both debuted within a few months of one another, Man-Thing, in fact, appearing first. Gerry Conway and Len Wein were good friends and roommates at the time that they created both Man-Thing and Swamp-Thing. They merely took their ideas to different comics.  Further discrediting the idea that Man-Thing is an imitation of Swamp Thing is the fact that Len Wein wrote the second Man-Thing story before he wrote the first story of the ongoing Swamp Thing, although its publication was severely delayed and appeared afterwards, after a change in the [[Comics Code]] allowed the more brutal nature of Man-Thing to appear in a color comic.

A predecessor of both was [[Hillman Publications]]' the [[The Heap (comics)|Heap]], who debuted in what was intended as a one-time appearance in the feature "[[Skywolf]]" in ''[[Air Fighters]]'' #3 (Dec. 1942). Created by writer [[Harry Stein]] and artist [[Mort Leav]], the Heap became a popular character in return appearances and later an ongoing solo feature. Early depictions of the Heap look highly similar to the [[Looney Tunes]]/[[Merrie Melodies]] character [[Gossamer (Looney Tunes)|Gossamer]], an orange-furred, practically featureless monster in [[sneakers]] who menaced [[Bugs Bunny]] in the 1946 [[animated short]] "Hair-Raising Hare" before going on to other appearances (named "Rudolph" in one).

A literary predecessor was the title creature of "It", a [[Theodore Sturgeon]] [[short story]] that first appeared in the [[pulp magazine]] "Unknown" in 1940.-->
