The '''Man-Thing''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[comics|comic-book]] creature created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Gerry Conway]], and featured in various [[Marvel Comics]] titles, most often written by [[Steve Gerber]].

Man-Thing is a large, vaguely humanoid, slow-moving green monster that lives in the [[Florida]] [[Everglades]] near the [[Seminole (tribe)|Seminole]] reservation. Unlike the intelligent and plant-based Swamp Thing, the Man-Thing is a nearly mindless mass of slime with no particular affinity to any living thing, but nevertheless it often becomes an accidental hero as it stumbles upon various [[crime fiction|crime]] and [[horror fiction|horror]] scenarios. It is able to sense human [[emotion]]s, and is enraged by [[fear]]; anyone clutched by the Man-Thing while in the throes of fear experiences [[spontaneous human combustion|spontaneous combustion]], hence the series' tag-line, "Whatever knows fear burns at the Man-Thing's touch." Though fear is understandably most people's response to the creature, typically only villains end up meeting fiery death at its hands.

==Origin==
The Man-Thing first appeared in ''Savage Tales'' #1 ([[1971]]), written by Thomas and Conway and illustrated by [[Grey Morrow]]. This story explained the creature's origin, which was roughly similar to Swamp Thing's: a biochemist, Ted Sallis, while fleeing from evil agents who wanted his formula for a miracle drug (later defined as the "super-soldier serum" used by [[Captain America]]), drowned in the swamp and was transformed into the Man-Thing by a combination of his own formula and magical forces extant in the area. Sallis's mind was apparently extinguished, although it was later shown that he could briefly return to consciousness within his monstrous form.

==Man-Thing in comics==
The character next appeared in a story by Conway and Morrow in ''Adventures into Fear'' #10 ([[1972]]) and continued in that series for nine more issues, with Steve Gerber taking over as writer starting in #11. Gerber expanded on the notion of the swamp having mystical properties and made it the "nexus of all realities", thus supplying numerous demons, ghosts, time-travelling warriors, etc., to serve as the Man-Thing's antagonists&mdash;though he continued to encounter non-supernatural villains as well, including land developers, fascist vigilantes, and common criminals. The ''Fear'' stories introduced a large supporting cast, including the demon Thog, the benevolent sorcerer Dakimh, and several humans who became allies of Dakimh and the Man-Thing, thus circumventing the difficulty of having a protagonist with no mind and no goals.

Beginning in January [[1974]], Gerber wrote his own ''Man-Thing'' series, illustrated most often by [[Val Mayerik]] and [[Mike Ploog]]. The series became Marvel's chief non-[[superhero]] fantasy title, and&mdash;again like DC's Swamp Thing&mdash;was flexible enough to accomodate horror, [[fantasy]], [[science fiction]], crime, and occasional [[fictional crossovers|crossovers]] with superhero characters. Gerber also wrote five longer issues of a parallel series, ''Giant-Size Man-Thing'', whose apparently unintentional double-entendre title became a common joke among comics readers.

''Man-Thing'' #22 was the last of the series, and justified its end with an unusual device: Gerber appeared as a character in the story, and admitted that he had not been inventing the Man-Thing's adventures but simply reporting on them. After witnessing the near-end of the universe&mdash;in which the minds of literally everyone except Gerber, Dakimh, and Thog were destroyed but then restored&mdash;Gerber decided he had to move on to other things. He continued to write brief cameos for the Man-Thing in other Marvel titles, chiefly ''Marvel Comics Presents'', through [[1989]].

A second ''Man-Thing'' series began in November [[1979]], written by [[Michael Fleisher]] and [[Chris Claremont]] and illustrated by [[Jim Mooney]] and [[Don Perlin]]; the series lasted through issue #11, in which Claremont not only introduced himself as a character as Gerber had, but temporarily ''became'' the Man-Thing. The character was revived in a third series in [[1997]], written by [[J. M. DeMatteis]] and illustrated by Lian Roger Sharp, for eight issues.

==Spin-offs==
Gerber introduced [[Howard the Duck]] in a Man-Thing story in ''Adventures into Fear'' #19. Howard, who was displaced from an all-duck planet via the swamp's nexus of realities, later acquired his own series.

The [[Foolkiller]], a vigilante who used a ray-gun to disintegrate not only criminals but anyone he considered foolish, was succeeded by another Foolkiller who became an occasional villain in other Marvel comics. A third version of the character starred in Gerber's [[1990]] ''Foolkiller'' miniseries.

==Film==
A ''Man-Thing'' movie, directed by [[Brett Leonard]] and based loosely on a Gerber storyline involving the unscrupulous land developer F.A. Schist, is scheduled for release in [[2005]].

==Similar characters==

The Man-Thing has often been eroneously described as Marvel's attempt to imitate the similar and more famous [[DC Comics]] character [[Swamp Thing]], but this is unlikely given that both debuted within a few months of one another.  It is more likely that both were inspired by the earlier character [[The Heap]], who was in turn probably inspired by [[Theodore Sturgeon]]'s short story "[[It (short story)|It]]").
