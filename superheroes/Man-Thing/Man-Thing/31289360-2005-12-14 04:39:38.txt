The '''Man-Thing''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[comics|comic-book]] creature created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Gerry Conway]], and featured in various [[Marvel Comics]] titles, most often written by [[Steve Gerber]].

Man-Thing is a large, vaguely humanoid, slow-moving green monster that lives in the [[Florida]] [[Everglades]] near the [[Seminole (tribe)|Seminole]] reservation. Unlike the intelligent and plant-based [[Swamp Thing]] of [[DC Comics]], the Man-Thing is a nearly mindless mass of slime with no particular affinity to any living thing, but nevertheless it often becomes an accidental hero as it stumbles upon various [[crime fiction|crime]] and [[horror fiction|horror]] scenarios. It is able to sense human [[emotion]]s, and is enraged by [[fear]] and automatically secretes a strong chemical [[corrosive]]; anyone clutched by the Man-Thing is prone to be chemically acid burned, hence the series' tag-line, "Whatever knows fear burns at the Man-Thing's touch." Though fear is understandably most people's response to the creature, typically only villains end up meeting an acidic death at its hands.

==Origin==
The Man-Thing first appeared in ''Savage Tales'' #1 ([[1971]]), written by Thomas and Conway and illustrated by [[Grey Morrow]]. This story explained the creature's origin, which was roughly similar to [[Swamp Thing]]'s: a biochemist, Ted Sallis, while fleeing from evil agents who wanted his formula for a miracle drug (later defined as the "super-soldier serum" used by [[Captain America]]), drowned in the swamp and was transformed into the Man-Thing by a combination of his own formula and magical forces extant in the area. Sallis's mind was apparently extinguished, although it was later shown that he could briefly return to consciousness within his monstrous form.

==Man-Thing in comics==
The character next appeared in a story by Conway and Morrow in ''[[Adventure into Fear]]'' #10 ([[1972]]) and continued in that series for nine more issues, with Steve Gerber taking over as writer starting in #11. Gerber expanded on the notion of the swamp having mystical properties and made it the "nexus of all realities", thus supplying numerous demons, ghosts, time-travelling warriors, etc., to serve as the Man-Thing's antagonists&mdash;though he continued to encounter non-supernatural villains as well, including land developers, fascist vigilantes, and common criminals. The ''Fear'' stories introduced a large supporting cast, including the demon Thog, the benevolent sorcerer Dakimh, and several humans who became allies of Dakimh and the Man-Thing, thus circumventing the difficulty of having a protagonist with no mind and no goals.

Beginning in January [[1974]], Gerber wrote his own ''Man-Thing'' series, illustrated most often by [[Val Mayerik]] and [[Mike Ploog]]. The series became Marvel's chief non-[[superhero]] fantasy title, and&mdash;again like DC's Swamp Thing&mdash;was flexible enough to accommodate horror, [[fantasy]], [[science fiction]], crime, and occasional [[fictional crossovers|crossovers]] with superhero characters. Gerber also wrote five longer issues of a parallel series, ''Giant-Size Man-Thing'', whose apparently unintentional [[double entendre]] title became a common joke among comics readers.

''Man-Thing'' #22 was the last of the series, and justified its end with an unusual device: Gerber appeared as a character in the story, and admitted that he had not been inventing the Man-Thing's adventures but simply reporting on them. After witnessing the near-end of the universe&mdash;in which the minds of literally everyone except Gerber, Dakimh, and Thog were destroyed but then restored&mdash;Gerber decided he had to move on to other things. He continued to write brief cameos for the Man-Thing in other Marvel titles, chiefly ''Marvel Comics Presents'', through [[1989]].

A second ''Man-Thing'' series began in November [[1979]], written by [[Michael Fleisher]] and [[Chris Claremont]] and illustrated by [[Jim Mooney]] and [[Don Perlin]]; the series lasted through issue #11, in which Claremont not only introduced himself as a character as Gerber had, but temporarily ''became'' the Man-Thing. The character was revived in a third series in [[1997]], written by [[J. M. DeMatteis]] and illustrated by Lian Roger Sharp, for eight issues.

Recently appeared in [[Ultimate Marvel Team Up]] #10.  Where he unwittingly saves Spider-Man from the Lizard.  His first Ultimate Marvel appearance.

==Superhuman abilities==
The Man-Thing possesses a variety of superhuman powers that are derived from the interaction of the scientific formula created by Ted Sallis and the mystical energies of the Nexus of Realities.

He possesses some degree of superhuman strength that has varied considerably during his comic book appearances.  Initially, the Man-Thing was only slightly stronger than Captain America, who can lift approximately 800 pounds.  During later appearances, the Man-Thing possessed sufficient superhuman strength to stand toe to toe with villains who were able to lift in excess of 100 tons.

The Man-Thing's body is practically invulnerable to harm.  Because his body isn't entirely solid, but composed of the muck and vegetative matter of the swamp, fists, bullets, knives, energy blasts, etc. will either pass entirely through him or will harmlessly be lodged within his body.  Even if a vast portion of the Man-Thing's body were to be ripped away or incinerated, he would be able to reorganize himself by drawing the necessary material from the surrounding vegetation.

The Man-Thing is also able to ooze his body through openings or around barriers that would seem too small for him to pass.  The smaller the opening, the longer it will take for him to reorganize his mass upon reaching the other side.

Unusual psychic and mystical forces react in what passes as the "brain" cells located through out his body.  These unique forces render the Man-Thing extremely sensitive to emotions.  Emotions that are mild and generally derived as positive, arouse curiosity and the Man-Thing will sometimes observe from a distance.  However, emotions that are often viewed as negative, such as violent emotions, rage, anger, hatred, fear, cause the Man-Thing great discomfort and might provoke him into an attack.  Once provoked into violent actions, his body secretes highly concentrated sulfuric acid that can burn human beings to ashes within a matter of seconds.  Even individuals that have high levels of superhuman durability have proven unable to withstand this potent acid.  While the Man-Thing is absent of violent emotions, his body produces a type of foamy, soapy mucus that neutralizes the acid.

The Man-Thing is dependent upon the swamp he inhabits for his continued survival.  He is able to leave the swamp, and has done so on many occasions, for a considerable length of time.  However, his body will slowly weaken and eventually lapse into dormancy if not returned to the swamp or exposed to clean water.

==Comic spin-offs==
Gerber introduced [[Howard the Duck]] in a Man-Thing story in ''Adventures into Fear'' #19. Howard, who was displaced from an all-duck planet via the swamp's nexus of realities, later acquired his own series.

The [[Foolkiller]], a vigilante who used a ray-gun to disintegrate not only criminals but anyone he considered foolish, was succeeded by another Foolkiller who became an occasional villain in other Marvel comics. A third version of the character starred in Gerber's [[1990]] ''Foolkiller'' miniseries.

==Film==
[[Image:Manthing.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Man-Thing, as portrayed in the 2005 movie]]
A ''Man-Thing'' movie, directed by [[Brett Leonard]] and based loosely on a Gerber storyline involving the unscrupulous land developer F.A. Schist, is now available on [[DVD]]. The movie appeared on the Sci-Fi channel in 2005 as a Sci-Fi original movie, and starred [[Matthew Le Nevez]], [[Rachel Taylor]], and [[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]].

The film's plot took many liberties with the source material, among them the depiction of Man-Thing's origin and moving the setting from the Florida Everglades to Louisiana.  The movie character is also represented in a significantly more antagonistic light than the comic book version. One important detail that was not altered, however, was that the Man-Thing's former identity was still Ted Sallis, though in the film he is portrayed as a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] shaman instead of a scientist.

==Similar characters==

The Man-Thing has often been erroneously described as Marvel's attempt to imitate the similar and more famous [[DC Comics]] character [[Swamp Thing]], but this is unlikely given that both debuted within a few months of one another.  It is more likely that both were inspired by the earlier character [[The Heap]], who was in turn probably inspired by [[Theodore Sturgeon]]'s short story "[[It (short story)|It]]").
