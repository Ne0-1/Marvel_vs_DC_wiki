'''''Angel and the Ape''''' was a humour [[comic book]] published by [[DC Comics]]. The characters first appearance in ''[[Showcase (comic book)|Showcase]]'' #77 then graduated to their own title, with art by comic artist [[Bob Oksner]], most often inked by [[Wally Wood]]. The title lasted for seven issues.

Angel O'Day was a [[private investigator]] who managed a small agency with her partner, Sam Simeon. Sam differed from many [[stereotype|stereotypical]] detectives; besides helping Angel, Sam was both a comic book artist and a talking [[gorilla]]. 

In later appearances, Angel was revealed to be related to [[Dumb Bunny]] a harmless member of the super-heroic [[Inferior Five]]. Sam was changed, too; he was not only now employed by [[DC Comics]] as an artist, but was also related to [[Gorilla Grodd]], the mortal nemesis of [[The Flash]]. As such, Sam had mental powers that he could use to make a limited number of people see him as a human being. However, a break in his concentration would force people to see him in his true form.

The series has been revived twice. The first was by [[Phil Foglio]] in the 90's, where ''Angel and the Ape'' stuck true to its zany roots. Although critically acclaimed by fans, plans for a regular series were shelved when DC company politics dictated a move away from humor titles. A second attempt at a revival was made in early 2001 under DC's [[Vertigo (comics)|Vertigo]] imprint, with a slightly different take. The title was not a big seller, and plans for an ongoing series were shelved.
