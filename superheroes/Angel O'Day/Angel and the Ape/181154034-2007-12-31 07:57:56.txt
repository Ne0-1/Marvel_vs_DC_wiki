'''''Angel and the Ape''''' was a humour [[comic book]] created by [[E. Nelson Bridwell]] published by [[DC Comics]]. The characters first appeared in 1968 in ''[[Showcase (comic book)|Showcase]]'' #77 then graduated to their own title, with art by comic artist [[Bob Oksner]], most often inked by [[Wally Wood]]. The title lasted for seven issues.

Angel O'Day was a [[private investigator]] who managed a small agency with her partner, Sam Simeon. Sam differed from many [[stereotype|stereotypical]] detectives; besides helping Angel, Sam was both a comic book artist and a talking [[gorilla]]. 

In later appearances, Angel was revealed to be related to [[Dumb Bunny]] a harmless member of the super-heroic [[Inferior Five]], also created by Bridwell. Sam was changed, too; he was not only now employed by [[DC Comics]] as an artist, but was also related to [[Gorilla Grodd]], the mortal nemesis of [[The Flash]]. As such, Sam had mental powers that he could use to make a limited number of people see him as a human being. However, a break in his concentration would force people to see him in his true form. This was in contrast to the original series, wherein people saw Sam's true form but convinced themselves he was simply an unusually ape-like human male, since it was "impossible" for there to be such a thing as a talking gorilla.

The series has been revived twice. The first was by [[Phil Foglio]] in the 90's, where ''Angel and the Ape'' stuck true to its zany roots. Although critically acclaimed by fans, plans for a regular series were shelved when DC company politics dictated a move away from humor titles. A second attempt at a revival was made in early 2001 under DC's [[Vertigo Comics|Vertigo]] imprint, with a slightly different take. The title was not a big seller, and plans for an ongoing series were shelved.
