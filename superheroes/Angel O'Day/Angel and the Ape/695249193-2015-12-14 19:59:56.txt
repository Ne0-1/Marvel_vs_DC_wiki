'''''Angel and the Ape''''' was a humor [[comic book]] created by [[E. Nelson Bridwell]] published by [[DC Comics]]. The characters first appeared in [[1968 in comics|1968]] in ''[[Showcase (comic book)|Showcase]]'' #77<ref>{{cite book|last=McAvennie|first= Michael|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 130 |quote = [E. Nelson Bridwell] and artist Bob Oksner injected pretty primitive humor into the classic 'beauty and the beast' concept when they opened the O'Day and Simeon Detective Agency for business.}}</ref> then graduated to their own title, with art by comic artist [[Bob Oksner]], most often inked by [[Wally Wood]]. The title lasted for seven issues, changing its name to ''Meet Angel'' for its final appearance.

==Series overview==
Angel O'Day is a [[private investigator]] who manages the O'Day and Simeon Detective Agency with her partner, Sam Simeon. Sam differs from many [[stereotype|stereotypical]] detectives; besides helping Angel, Sam is both a comic book artist and a talking [[gorilla]].<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation  | last = Wallace  | first = Dan | author-link =   | contribution = Angel and the Ape | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 15  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = London  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5}}</ref> Sam's last name is a play on the word "simian" ("of or pertaining to an ape or monkey").

==Revivals==
The series has been revived twice. The first was by [[Phil Foglio]] in the [[1990s in comics|1990s]], where ''Angel and the Ape'' stuck true to its zany roots. In [[Phil Foglio]]'s [[1991 in comics|1991]] [[limited series|mini-series]], Angel is revealed to be the half sister of [[Dumb Bunny]], a member of the super-heroic group the [[Inferior Five]], also created by Bridwell. Sam is changed, too; he is not only employed by "[[DC Comics|DZ Comics]]" as an artist, but is also the grandson of [[Gorilla Grodd]], a nemesis of [[The Flash]]. As such, Sam has mental powers that he can use to make a limited number of people see him as a human being. However, a break in his concentration allows people to see him in his true form. This is in contrast to the original series, wherein people see Sam's true form but convince themselves he is simply an unusually ape-like human male, since it is "impossible" for there to be such a thing as a talking gorilla.

A second revival was made in early [[2001 in comics|2001]] under DC's [[Vertigo Comics|Vertigo]] imprint, with a vastly different take.  The four issue limited series was written by [[Howard Chaykin]] and [[David Tischman]], with art by [[Philip Bond]] and covers by [[Arthur Adams (comics)|Arthur Adams]].

The two appeared in a one-page story in ''DC Holiday Special 09'', written and drawn by [[Andrew Pepoy]].

In 2012, they appeared in a segment of the anthology title, ''Joe Kubert Presents''.

==Alternate versions==
In the continuity of the 2004 miniseries ''[[JLA: Another Nail]]'', [[Clark Kent|Karl]] and Lois go to see an ''Angel and the Ape'' film.

Angel and the Ape made an appearance in an issue of the [[Batman: The Brave and the Bold (comics)|comic book tie-in]] to ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]''. They helped Batman to apprehend some criminals in the first portion on the comic.{{issue|date=September 2014}}
