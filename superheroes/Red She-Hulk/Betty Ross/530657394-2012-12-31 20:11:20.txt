==Fictional character biography==
The only daughter of the renowned General [[Thunderbolt Ross|Thaddeus E. "Thunderbolt" Ross]], Betty spends her formative years firmly under her father's strict supervision. After her mother died during Betty's teenage years, she is sent away to [[boarding school]]. After graduating, the introverted young woman returns to her father's side while he is in charge of a top-secret project to create a new type of weapon involving [[gamma radiation]]. The head scientist on the project was [[Hulk (comics)|Robert Bruce Banner]], whom her father detested because he felt Banner was both a physical and emotional weakling. The General's hatred for Banner intensified when Betty fell in love with him.

But their relationship forever changes when Banner is caught in the detonation of a gamma radiation bomb after saving a teenager named Rick Jones from the restricted test area and becomes the Incredible Hulk. For years Banner's efforts to keep his condition a secret from Betty would only serve to alienate her from him. She was then romantically pursued by [[United States Air Force|Major]] [[Glenn Talbot]], the new aide attached to her father's [[Hulkbusters|Hulkbuster]] task force.{{issue|date=August 2012}}

After his dual identity becomes public knowledge, Banner becomes a hunted fugitve. But when he later gains control over his transformations, and the Hulk is no longer deemed a menace to the world, Banner is pardoned and becomes engaged to Betty. During the wedding ceremony, the Hulk's archenemy the Leader causes Banner to transform back into the savage Hulk. General Ross is seriously injured when the Hulk ran amok and Banner became a fugitive once again.

Believing Banner to be lost forever to her as a potential husband, not only because of the Hulk, but because she believed Banner instead loved a green-skinned alien from a sub-atomic world named [[Jarella]], Betty married Glenn Talbot on the rebound. While Betty and Talbot were on their honeymoon, her father continued his global pursuit of the Hulk and is captured and sent to a Soviet prison. Talbot takes part in a successful rescue mission, but is captured in the process and believed dead. When Betty learned of her husband's supposed death, she suffers a nervous breakdown.

It was at this time that the villain M.O.D.O.K. came across her saw her condition and kidnapped and hypnotised her because he wanted to create a weapon powerful enough to defeat the Hulk, by subjecting her to gamma radiation, more than what Banner was subjected to, and transforms her into the insane and lethal Harpy creature.

The Harpy broke forward from a containment shell and immediately went after to the Hulk, so that she could destroy him. MODOK told the Harpy where to find the Hulk and she flew off in search of him, she first ambushes him and then the two of them fight each other to a standstill. Right when the Hulk is about to hit her while she's down, she tells him she's Betty, while Hulk is shocked and confused by her claim, she blasts him and knocks him out.

General Ross sees the Harpy and the Hulk fighting on TV and recognizes Harpy as his daughter Betty. He makes it to the battlesite and rushes to talk to her right before she blasts the Hulk, he tries to talk her down by telling her that she's a human being and that she's kind & gentle, and just when it seems to be working, MODOK's brainwashing start to take affect on her again, and finally she grabs the Hulk and flies away. Military jets take off after her but she manages to destroy one of them, before anything else can happen, a tornado appears out of nowhere and graps the Harpy and uncionscious Hulk, the tornado disappears and drops the two of them off on a city in the sky. The city is home to the the [[Bi-Beast]], he steps out and reveals himself to them, after which both Harpy and Hulk attack him after he grabs the Harpy. The Bi-Beast manages to knock the Harpy unconscious and the Hulk reverts back to Bruce Banner, Bi-Beast tells Banner he brought them there to keep him company but then asks Banner to try and repair the machines that are slowly stopping which will cause his city to fall out of the sky. Banner agrees to help, and since he doesn't know how Betty got turned into the Harpy, figures he can use the advanced equipment to help her at the same time. He goes to find the Bi-Beast and finds him trying to talk to the Harpy, who is trapped in a cage, Banner says he'll help repair the equipment if the Bi-Beast lets him take the Harpy with him, to which Bi-Beast agrees. Banner puts some equipment together which he thinks will cure Betty, but unbeknownst to him, MODOK came about the island and tricked the Bi-Beast into thinking Bruce was going to do him harm. The Bi-Beast attacks Banner just as he hits the switch to start the equipment, after that a fight ensues as Banner gets mad and becomes the Hulk and then MODOK doublecrosses the Bi-Beast and attacks him too. As the Bi-Beast hits the self-destruct button as a last resort, the Hulk turns back to Banner and goes to search for Betty, he finds her in the eqiupment and she still hasn't turned back to normal, thinking that it didn't work, nevertheless he grabs her and they make a run for it as the island falls apart. Banner, as the Hulk, rescues them both as they land, while at the same time parts of a building land on the Harpy as they run and when the dust clears, it is revealed that the Harpy has reverted back to Betty Ross showing that the equipment Banner used was successful.

Unknown to Betty, her father and everyone else, Talbot was still alive and being held prisoner by the Gremlin at Bitterfrost, a top secret Soviet installation in Siberia. A man named Gregori Kronski was subjected to surgery that made him a double of Talbot. The Gremlin used his Psiclone device to imprint the memories and personality of Talbot in Kronski's mind, and those of Kronski's in Talbot's. Kronski was then sent to the United States, claiming to be an escaped Talbot. However, a bomb was concealed within Kronski's body. Gremlin's plan was to use the bomb to assassinate the President of the United States when the latter came to visit Gamma Base, where Talbot was stationed. Colonel Jack D. Armbruster saved the President's life, but both Armbruster and Kronski were killed when the bomb exploded. The real Talbot was eventually later rescued by General Ross, Clay Quartermain and the Hulk.{{issue|date=August 2012}}

During his time in captivity by the Gremlin, Talbot was made into a mindless husk. In order to unblock Talbot's mind, [[Doctor Leonard Samson]] had the Hulk (who was Banner under control by a special helmet) unblock what was keeping him in a mindless state. The process was a success. However, The Talbots' marriage later became strained.{{issue|date=August 2012}}

When General Ross suffered a nervous breakdown, Talbot returned to the military as a Colonel and it was later revealed that he had fired a ray gun that sent the Hulk to the Sub-Atomic universe after the Hulk stormed into Gamma Base looking for Jarella, now deceased, who was cryogenically frozen. This incident proved to be the last straw in Talbot's already deteriorating relationship with Betty, and their marriage later ended in divorce. Blaming the failure of his marriage on Banner, whom he also tried to have court-martialed, Talbot died in Japan while trying to destroy the Hulk there. Betty admitted to Rick Jones afterwards that she had never stopped loving Banner all the while she was married to Talbot.{{issue|date=August 2012}}

When Betty learned that her father conspired with M.O.D.O.K to kill the Hulk, Betty accused him of treason. Realizing Betty was right, Ross nearly committed suicide and then disappeared.{{issue|date=August 2012}}

Banner again achieved a state in which he could control his transformations and maintain his normal personality and intelligence while in the form of the Hulk. But this time, however, Betty was upset because she wanted Banner to be rid of the Hulk, not to control him, and left him once again. Banner then briefly became romantically involved with his new assistant and S.H.I.E.L.D. agent [[Kate Waynesboro|Dr. Katherine "Kate" Waynesboro]]. But due to the influence of the evil dream demon [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]], he once again lost control over the Hulk, who had become more savage than ever before, and his relationship with Kate ended shortly after.{{issue|date=August 2012}}

The Hulk disappeared from Earth for an extended period, and Betty began dating a man named Ramon. Upon learning that the Hulk had been sighted on Earth once again, Betty left Ramon and returned to Gamma Base, where the Hulk was subjected to a process that split Banner and the Hulk into separate entities. Believing himself finally cured, Banner proposed to Betty, and she accepted. Betty's father appeared at the wedding, armed with a gun and demanding that the marriage not take place before shooting Rick Jones, who tried to stop him. Courageously, Betty confronted her father, accusing him of domineering her throughout her life, as well as calling him out on his hostility towards Banner over the years, and cowered him into surrendering the gun. Then finally, Banner and Betty were pronounced husband and wife.{{issue|date=August 2012}}

However, Banner began dying as a result of being physically separated from the Hulk. The two were secretly merged once more and Betty soon discovered this. General Ross later died before his daughter's eyes when he sacrificed his life to destroy an unnamed mutant that nearly killed both Betty and Banner seeking a strong host to be parasitically linked to.{{issue|date=August 2012}}

Betty later became distraught on learning that Banner had sometimes consciously triggered his transformation in the past and was even now willing to become the Hulk in order to deal with very menacing threats. Betty left her husband and returned to Ramon, but then changed her mind and abandoned Ramon as well. She was then captured by the Leader, who set her free after learning that she was pregnant with Banner's child, but after being tormented with terrible nightmares by the demons [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]] and [[D'Spayre]], Betty loses her unborn baby.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #360</ref>

She was eventually reunited with Banner, but soon afterward the Hulk seemingly perished in a tremendous explosion at Gammatown. Believing Banner and the Hulk dead, Betty left for New York City, where she eventually began training to become a nun. Betty spent some months in a convent to recover from the ordeal, but eventually reunites with Banner. They spent years living together as fugitives until the Hulk's enemy [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]] used his own blood to poison Betty, which would appear to be the work of the Hulk himself (due to the high levels of gamma radiation present in both of their bodies). Betty was placed in [[cryogenics|cryogenic]] suspension by her father.{{issue|date=August 2012}}

In a later retconned storyarc Betty was seemingly revived by the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]]; underwent surgery which considerably altered her appearance; was granted superhuman strength; and for a time aided her fugitive husband as his shadowy contact, '''Mr. Blue'''.{{issue|date=August 2012}}

The "Tempest Fugit" [[story arc]] explains her resurrection as a reality-distorting hallucination created by Nightmare, and also introduces Betty's daughter '''Daydream''', supposedly magically conceived when the entity raped her in her sleep.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 3 #81</ref> This version of events was confirmed in stories by later writers.<ref>''World War Hulk'' #3</ref><ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 3 #110</ref>

===Becoming Red She-Hulk===
[[File:sherulk.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Betty Ross as Red She-Hulk. Art by [[Ian Churchill]].]]
During the 2010 "[[Fall of the Hulks]]" storyline, Betty is revealed to have been resurrected by the Leader and [[MODOK]], due to the urgings of their new ally, her father Thunderbolt Ross, who had previously kept her body in [[cryonic]] stasis. She also undergoes the same process that turned her father into the Red Hulk, which grants her vast superhuman physical power. The now villainous [[Doc Samson]] also helps Leader to brainwash Betty into an extremely confused and aggressive state.{{issue|date=January 2012}} Ross' allies are aware of his intentions to betray them and send Betty, as the "Red She-Hulk", to help assassinate her father, who was hunting the [[mercenary]] [[Domino (comics)|Domino]], after she witnessed him transform from his human form. Their encounter ended with Red She-Hulk kicking Red Hulk off the [[Empire State Building]].<ref>[[Loeb, Jeph]]. ''Hulk'' vol. 2 #15-17 (November 2009-January 2010)</ref>

After Ross fakes his own death, Betty also appears as herself at his "funeral", accompanied by a [[Life Model Decoy]] of Glenn Talbot to constantly monitor and control her, and expresses distrust of Bruce due to his recent marriage to [[Caiera]] on [[Sakaar]] and his subsequent [[World War Hulk|attack on Manhattan]].<ref>''Fall of the Hulks: Gamma'' (December 2009)</ref> During the 2010 "[[World War Hulks]]" storyline, after Skaar stabs her with his sword, the new She-Hulk reverts to her human form, officially revealing her true identity.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #609</ref> Betty explains how she was brought back to life, and asks that Bruce allow her to die. However, when Samson arrives, Betty's anger at his betrayal transforms her back into the Red She-Hulk, thus healing her injuries.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #610</ref> Now once again in control of her own mind Betty (as Red She-Hulk) helps Bruce/Hulk to reconcile with his son [[Skaar]].<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #611</ref> When Bruce gains the upper hand in the ensuing final battle against Ross, Betty becomes worried for her father, which, combined with her heightened aggression when transformed, leads into conflict with the original She-Hulk, who prevails. After Ross is defeated and imprisoned, Betty nonetheless convinces Bruce to grant her father an opportunity for rehabilitation and redemption.<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 2 #24</ref>

In the aftermath of the Leader's attempted takeover, Betty tells Bruce that they are no longer married, since she was declared legally dead and everyone else knows that Bruce had married Caiera.<ref>''Incredible Hulks'' #612 (September 2010)</ref> However in the last series, the Hulk family defeat [[Fin Fang Foom]]. Afterwards Betty and Bruce resume their relationship<ref>''Incredible Hulks'' #635 (August 2011)</ref> until Banner was separated from the Hulk by Dr. Doom.

Red She-Hulk is also present in the "[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]"<ref>''Incredible Hulks'' #618</ref> and "[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]" storylines<ref name=CoreMiniseries#7>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Matt Fraction]]|penciller=[[Stuart Immonen]]|inker=Wade Von Grawbadger|story=Thor's Day|title=Fear Itself|volume=1|issue=7|date=December 2011|publisher=Marvel Comics|page=|panel=}}</ref> in 2010 and 2011 respectively. She is subsequently a cast member in the ongoing ''[[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]'' series (volume 4) that debuted in December 2011 under writer [[Matt Fraction]] and came to close in November 2012 with issue #12 being billed as the final issue.

In October 2012 as part of [[Marvel NOW!]], the title of Hulk vol. 2 was changed to Red She-Hulk starting from issue #58.

==Powers and abilities==
As the Harpy, Betty had superhuman strength, stamina, speed and durability which were enough to fight the Hulk with. She also had big Bird-like wings from her back that she used to fly at high speeds through the air and perform aerial attacks. In addition to that, she also had razor sharp Talons which were so strong that she could use them to cut through and tear apart rock, metal and carry heavy objects.

As the Red She-Hulk, Betty has enormous superhuman strength, stamina, durability, and a [[healing factor]] that allows her to easily survive what would normally be fatal injuries to humans, such as stab wounds to the leg and abdomen by [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]'s claws.<ref name=Hulkv2#16>Loeb, Jeph. ''Hulk'' vol. 2 #16 (December 2009)</ref> Similarly to her ex-husband, Betty's strength level is so vast that it warps the [[laws of physics]] even further than standard for other characters in the same fictional continuity, for example allowing her to punch her way through dimensional barriers between different universes, and was far stronger than the regular [[She-Hulk]].<ref name=Hulk607>''Incredible Hulk'' #607</ref> This level of power did not last however as she was then later defeated easily by [[She-Hulk]].<ref name=Hulk24>''Hulk'' #24</ref>She shares the Red Hulk's ability to absorb energy, such as the [[gamma radiation]] from other Hulks, thereby reverting those beings to human form, and at least temporarily boosting herself. According to Banner, there were plans to remove this ability through the same process that removed the Red Hulk's based on the fact that this ability would eventually kill her.<ref>Loeb, Jeph. ''Hulk'' vol. 2 #22 (July 2010)</ref> Also like her father, Red She-Hulk has yellow blood, produces yellow energy from her eyes when angry,<ref name=Hulkv2#16/> and can discharge energy by touch.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #24</ref> Red She-Hulk can be reverted to human form if she is suddenly startled or frightened, though she can revert to her Hulk form at will.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=Matt Fraction|penciller=[[Terry Dodson]]|inker=[[Rachel Dodson]]|story=Breaker of Worlds Part 2: The Prize of New Avalon|title=[[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]|volume=4|issue=2|publisher|Marvel Comics|date=March 2012}}</ref>

In the "[[Heroes Reborn]]" Universe created during 1996-1997 storyline by [[Franklin Richards]] in the aftermath of the [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] crisis, Betty was known as Liz Ross, and served as the head of security for [[Stark Industries|Stark International]]. As a result, she took [[Iron Man]]'s apparent appointment as Tony Stark's personal bodyguard as a personal insult, and was also present when Bruce Banner was exposed to the gamma radiation that would turn him into the Hulk (The same accident that resulted in Stark donning the Iron Man armor in the first place). Shortly before the heroes returned to their world, it was revealed that Liz was dying of cancer as a result of the gamma exposure, Banner being particularly affected by news of the disease to the extent that he turned back from the Hulk to embrace her as Banner after learning about her condition.

==="House of M"===
In the alternate universe seen in the 2005 "[[House of M]]" storyline, Betty Ross is married to Major Glenn Talbot.<ref>''Hulk: Broken Worlds'' #1</ref>

She earned a degree in communications at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] and dated [[Ultimate Hulk|Bruce Banner]] until his failed attempts at cracking the super soldier problem turned him into the [[Ultimate Hulk|Hulk]].<ref>''Ultimates'' #3</ref>

When the [[Ultimates]] were assembled, she became their Director of [[Communication]]s/[[Public Relations]] Officer. After being spurned by Betty, Bruce responded by injecting himself with a version of the Hulk formula that incorporated the recently discovered Captain America's blood, and went on a rampage as the Hulk, during which he killed more than 800 civilians. During his trial, Betty declared her love for Bruce, who was eventually convicted, and sentenced to death, but Bruce escaped the nuclear bomb intended to execute him by turning into the Hulk and escaping.<ref>''Ultimates'' 2 #5</ref> Bruce returned during the ''Ultimates 2'' miniseries after Fury, the President of the United States, Washington D.C. and New York had been captured by the [[The Liberators (Marvel Comics)|Liberators]]. Bruce, now exhibiting greater control over his transformations, helped repel the Liberators, and Betty was seen tending to an exhausted Bruce after the battle with the Liberators and [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] in [[Washington DC]].<ref>''Ultimates'' 2 # 13</ref>
