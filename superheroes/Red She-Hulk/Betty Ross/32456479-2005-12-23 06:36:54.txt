Betty has been a love interest, co-worker and later wife of Bruce Banner, the human identity of the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]].  She is the daughter of General [[Thunderbolt Ross]], a longtime foe of the Hulk.  She was once married to Colonel [[Glenn Talbot]], a military man who served under her father.  At once point she was briefly mutated into the '''Harpy''' by [[MODOK]] and battled the Hulk, but Banner was able to reverse this with the aid of [[Red Raven]]'s technology, after which she continued being romantically involved with Banner.  She was poisoned by the [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]] and believed killed, although she later resurfaced, having been given [[plastic surgery]] and a new identity by a mysterious [[conspiracy]] fronted by the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]]. It is said that Betty was murdered with gamma-ray poisnsing, and Bruce Banner and the Hulk worked together to find the murderer, which to this day has not been found. 

===Other media===
The original animated series depicted Betty as a civilian hanger on with no apparent function in the Gamma Bomb as in the comics.  However, later adaptations have Betty as a professional scientific colleague to Banner who devotes much of her time trying to address and treat her love's bizarre medical condition.

In the [[2003]] ''[[Hulk (film)|Hulk]]'' film, Betty Ross is played by [[Jennifer Connelly]].
