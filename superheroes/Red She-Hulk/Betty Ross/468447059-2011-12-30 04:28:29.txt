==Publication history==
Betty Ross first appeared in ''The Incredible Hulk'' #1 (May 1962), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

In ''Hulk'' vol. 2 #15 (September 2009) Betty Ross for the first time appears as Red She-Hulk, who was created by writer [[Jeph Loeb]] and artist [[Ed McGuinness]].

Red She-Hulk's existence was revealed at the 2009 [[Comic-Con International]], where promotional photos were released of her wearing a torn black [[jumpsuit]], wielding an [[assault rifle]] and a [[sai (weapon)|sai]], leading to immediate speculation towards her identity.<ref>[http://marvel.com/news/comicstories.8916.SDCC_2009~colon~_Introducing_Red_She-Hulk Strom, Marc "SDCC 2009: Introducing Red She-Hulk" Marvel.com July 25, 2009]</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
The only daughter of the renowned General [[Red Hulk|Thaddeus E. "Thunderbolt" Ross]], Betty spent her formative years firmly under her father's strict supervision. Thunderbolt Ross had wanted a son, and his disappointment at having a daughter was reflected in the way he raised her. After her mother died during Betty's teenage years, she was sent away to [[boarding school]]. After graduating, the introverted young woman returned to her father's side. Thunderbolt Ross was then in charge of a top-secret project to create a new type of weapon involving [[gamma radiation]]. The head scientist on the project was [[Hulk (comics)|Robert Bruce Banner]], whom her father detested. An attraction between Betty and Bruce soon developed.

Their relationship was forever changed when, during the test of a gamma radiation bomb, Bruce was struck by the full force of the detonation and became the Hulk. Banner tried to keep his condition secret from Betty, which alienated them. Betty was then romantically pursued by [[United States Air Force|Major]] [[Glenn Talbot]], the new aide attached to her father's [[Hulkbusters|Hulkbuster]] task force. Eventually, the secret of Banner's dual identity became public knowledge, and his transformations and rampages created a rift between him and Betty. Betty married Major Talbot out of desperation. Their union soon ended in divorce, however, and Talbot died trying to destroy the Hulk.

Betty continued to find herself entangled in the lives of Bruce Banner and the Hulk. At one point she was transformed by the villainous [[MODOK]] into a gamma-empowered flying menace known as the Harpy. In this form, she was an insane green creature with a woman's head and arms, but the wings and body of a giant bird of prey. She could fly and fire energy blasts.<ref>''Hulk'' #167-168</ref>

Despite these events, and the protestations of her father, she eventually married Bruce Banner.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' v.2, #319</ref> The two conceived a child, but after being tormented with terrible nightmares by the demons [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]] and [[D'Spayre]], Betty loses her unborn baby.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #360</ref>

Betty spent some months in a monastery to recover from the ordeal, but eventually reunites with Bruce.  They spent years living together as fugitives until the Hulk's enemy [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]] used his own blood to poison Betty, which would appear to be the work of the Hulk himself (due to the high levels of gamma radiation present in both of their bodies). Betty was placed in [[cryogenics|cryogenic]] suspension by her father.

In a later retconned storyarc Betty was seemingly revived by the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]]; underwent surgery which considerably altered her appearance; was granted superhuman strength; and for a time aided her fugitive husband as his shadowy contact, '''Mr. Blue'''.

The ''Tempest Fugit'' [[story arc]] explains her resurrection as a reality-distorting hallucination created by Nightmare, and also introduces Betty's daughter '''Daydream''', supposedly magically conceived when the entity raped her in her sleep.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 3 #81</ref> This version of events was confirmed in stories by later writers.<ref>''World War Hulk'' #3</ref><ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 3 #110</ref>

===Red She-Hulk===
[[File:sherulk.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Betty Ross as Red She-Hulk. Art by [[Ian Churchill]].]]
During the ''[[Fall of the Hulks]]'' storyline, Betty is revealed to (this time truly) have been resurrected by the Leader and [[MODOK]], due to the urgings of their new ally, her father Thunderbolt Ross, who had previously kept her body in [[cryonic]] stasis. She also undergoes the same process that turned her father into the Red Hulk, which grants her vast superhuman physical power. The now villainous [[Doc Samson]] also helps Leader to brainwash Betty into an extremely confused and aggressive state.

Ross' allies are aware of his intentions to betray them and send Betty, as the "Red She-Hulk", to help assassinate her father, who was hunting the [[mercenary]] [[Domino (comics)|Domino]], after she witnessed him transform from his human form. Their encounter ended with Red She-Hulk kicking Red Hulk off the [[Empire State Building]].<ref>[[Loeb, Jeph]]. ''Hulk'' vol. 2 #15-17 (November 2009-January 2010)</ref>

After Ross fakes his own death, Betty also appears as herself at the "funeral", accompanied by a [[Life Model Decoy]] of Glenn Talbot to constantly monitor and control her, and expresses distrust of Bruce due to his recent marriage to [[Caiera]] on [[Sakaar]] and his subsequent [[World War Hulk|attack on Manhattan]].<ref>''Fall of the Hulks: Gamma'' (December 2009)</ref> 

In her She-Hulk identity Betty captures [[Henry Pym|Hank Pym]] for the Intelligencia.<ref name="Pym capture">''Incredible Hulk'' #607</ref>

During the ''[[World War Hulks]]'' storyline, after Skaar stabs her with his sword, the new She-Hulk reverts back to her human form, officially revealing her true identity.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #609</ref> Betty explains how she was brought back to life, and asks that Bruce allow her to die. However, when Samson arrives, Betty's anger at his betrayal transforms her back into the Red She-Hulk, thus healing her injuries.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #610</ref> Now once again in control of her own mind Betty (as Red She-Hulk) helps Bruce/Hulk to reconcile with his son [[Skaar]].<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #611</ref> When Bruce gains the upper hand in the ensuing final battle against Ross, Betty turns worried for her father, which, combined with her heightened aggression when transformed, leads into conflict with the original She-Hulk, who prevails. After Ross is defeated and imprisoned, Betty nonetheless convinces Bruce to grant her father an opportunity for rehabilitation and redemption.<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 2 #24</ref>

In the aftermath of the Leader's attempted takeover, Betty is having a hard time to cope with being brainwashed and turned into a Red She-Hulk. During one conversation with Bruce, Betty states that they are no longer married, since she was declared legally dead and everyone else knows that Bruce had married Caiera. He tries telling her that everything will be alright, only to get her worked up and transform into Red She-Hulk.<ref>''Incredible Hulks'' #612 (September 2010)</ref>

During the ''[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]'' storyline, Betty as Red She-Hulk joined Hulk, Skaar, A-Bomb, and Korg in their fight against Abomination, a Zom-possessed Doctor Strange, and the forces of [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (comics)|Amatsu-Mikaboshi]].<ref>''Incredible Hulks'' #618</ref>

Following the resolution of the Chaos War, Betty again goes on the run, with Banner - who has discovered that her gamma levels are unstable and that if she transforms just a few more times, she may be permanently stuck in her Red She-Hulk form - finally catching up with her in Rome, only to find out that she has teamed up with his old nemesis Tyrannus to steal Pandora's box, subsequently framing the Hulk for its theft.<ref>''Incredible Hulks #626''</ref> Subsequently, when Banner confronts Betty and Tyrannus with the help of the museum curator, Dr. Sofia Di Cosmo (an expert on artefacts of antiquity) - who plans to use Pandora's box to form a new Roman empire - they are attacked by a pair of men in armour claiming to be the "Knights of Rome", who disappear with Tyrannus, Dr. Di Cosmo and Pandora's box, forcing Betty to team up with the Hulk.<ref>''Incredible Hulks #627''</ref>

The Hulk and Betty are able to track down and defeat the Knights of Rome but Tyrannus uses the opportunity to transform their magical floating fortress into a giant impregnable stone golem while keeping Dr. Di Cosmo his captive.<ref>''Incredible Hulks #628''</ref> He immediately flings Hulk away, with Betty following - to Tyrannus' obvious dismay. She arrives to find the Hulk unhurt and both revert to their human forms and Betty confesses she is struggling to keep the Red She-Hulk at bay.

They return to the Colosseum, with Banner having reverted to the Hulk but Betty still human. Tyrannus has gathered thousands of locals to witness the opening of Pandora's Box. With Amadeus Cho having disabled the mystical defenses of the fortress, Hulk is able to rescue Dr. Di Cosmo and Pandora's Box. Tyrannus and Hulk fight with Tyrannus having the upper hand, prompting Dr. Di Cosmo to ask Betty to become Red She-Hulk to help the Hulk. Both Amadeus and the Hulk tell her not to - because of the risk of her being unable to become human again. Instead, the Hulk throws Pandora's Box to her so that she can keep it away from Tyrannus.

Tyrannus exits the golem and shoots Pandora's Box, unleashing the corrupted spirit of hope which was contained inside - possessing Betty. The Hulk is able to absorb and overcome it, freeing Betty from its hold but momentarily returning to human form. Betty realizes that she and Bruce will never be able to have a normal life together and gives in to her Red She-Hulk persona, who tells Hulk she doesn't care - before fleeing with Tyrannus.<ref>''Incredible Hulks #629''</ref>

Betty, still in R-Hulk form, is shown in Tyrannus's underground lair being shown around after they had slept together. When he shows her his fountain of youth they are attacked by A.I.M lead by Monica Rappaccini and are momentarily immobilized while she runs tests on the fountain to create a wishing well. <ref>''Incredible Hulks #630''</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
As the Red She-Hulk, Betty has enormous superhuman strength, stamina, durability, and a [[healing factor]] that allows her to easily survive what would normally be fatal injuries to humans, such as stab wounds to the leg and abdomen by [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]'s claws.<ref name=Hulkv2#16>Loeb, Jeph. ''Hulk'' vol. 2 #16 (December 2009)</ref> Similarly to her ex-husband, Betty's strength level is so vast that it warps the [[laws of physics]] even further than standard for other characters in the same fictional continuity, for example allowing her to punch her way through dimensional barriers between different universes.<ref name="Pym capture"/> She shares the Red Hulk's ability to absorb energy, such as the [[gamma radiation]] from other Hulks, thereby reverting those beings to human form, and at least temporarily boosting herself. According to Banner, there were plans to remove this ability through the same process that removed the Red Hulk's based on the fact that this ability would kill her in the end.<ref>Loeb, Jeph. ''Hulk'' vol. 2 #22 (July 2010)</ref> Also like her father, Red She-Hulk has yellow blood, and produces yellow energy from her eyes when angry.<ref name=Hulkv2#16/> It is known that she can also discharge energy by touch as he can.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #24</ref>

==Other versions==
===Heroes Reborn===
In the ''[[Heroes Reborn]]'' Universe created by [[Franklin Richards]] in the aftermath of the [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] crisis, Betty was known as Liz Ross, and served as the head of security for [[Stark Industries|Stark International]]. As a result, she took [[Iron Man]]'s apparent appointment as Tony Stark's personal bodyguard as a personal insult, and was also present when Bruce Banner was exposed to the gamma radiation that would turn him into the Hulk (The same accident that resulted in Stark donning the Iron Man armor in the first place). Shortly before the heroes returned to their world, it was revealed that Liz was dying of cancer as a result of the gamma exposure, Banner being particularly affected by news of the disease to the extent that he turned back from the Hulk to embrace her as Banner after learning about her condition.

===House of M===
In the ''[[House of M]]'' universe, Betty Ross is married to Major Glenn Talbot.<ref>''Hulk: Broken Worlds'' #1</ref>

===Ultimate Betty Ross===
[[Image:Ultimateshehulk.png|thumb|right|Ultimate She-Hulk (Betty Ross) in Ultimate Wolverine vs. Hulk #3. Art by [[Leinil Francis Yu]].]]
In the Ultimate Marvel Universe, Betty is the daughter of [[Red Hulk|General "Thunderbolt" Ross]]. She was the roommate of fellow "Army brat" [[Wasp (comics)#Ultimate Wasp|Janet van Dyne]] during her college years when Jan started seeing [[Henry Pym#Ultimate Henry Pym|Hank Pym]] at [[New York University|NYU]]. She earned a degree in communications at [[University of California at Berkley|Berkeley]]  and started dating the Super-Soldier Program's head scientist, [[Ultimate Hulk|Bruce Banner]]. Her relationship with Bruce soured after Bruce's failed attempts at cracking the super soldier problem turned him into the Hulk. After the Hulk was captured by her father, she ended her relationship with Bruce and temporarily moved to [[SoHo]].

When the [[Ultimates]] were assembled, she became their Director of [[Communication]]s/[[Public Relations]] Officer. During this time, Bruce attempted to rekindle their relationship but was spurned and belittled by Betty who boasted of having dinner with [[Freddie Prinze, Jr.]] This caused Banner to take some of Captain America's recently rediscovered blood, combine it with his Hulk formula and inject it into himself- publicly defending his actions as giving the team a monster to fight to justify their existence while also admitting that he just 'missed being big'-, resulting in his transformation into the grey-skinned Hulk, who went after Betty stating that she was the only person that he had left. Bruce was eventually brought down by the Ultimates, but not before killing more than 800 civilians. Ironically, seeing Bruce's desperate devotion to her and being perversely attracted to his savage Hulk persona, she took a new romantic interest in Bruce.

When it was leaked to the public that Bruce Banner was in fact the Hulk, she was devastated knowing that no jury would acquit him of his crime and it was a certain death sentence.  Though she coldly went along with the government's plan to execute Bruce, she broke down during the trial. She declared her love for Bruce, offering to have sex with him while she still had the chance, and asked him for forgiveness. Bruce granted neither wish (partly because the dialogue was being broadcast live, making him feel inhibited).

When S.H.I.E.L.D. discovered that Bruce was still alive, [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]] asked [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] to find and kill the Hulk. Betty didn't approve of this but it was beyond her control. She had recently shown interest in Nick Fury but they both, along with almost all the Ultimates, were captured during the [[The Liberators (Marvel Comics)|Liberators]]' attack on U.S. soil. They were later freed when Bruce Banner returned. Betty was seen tending to an exhausted Bruce after the battle with the Liberators and [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] in [[Washington DC]].

She becomes [[She-Hulk]] in ''Ultimate Wolverine vs. Hulk'' #3, interrupting the fight between [[Ultimate Hulk|Hulk]] and [[Alternative versions of Wolverine#Ultimate Marvel|Wolverine]].<ref>''Ultimate Wolverine vs. Hulk'' #3</ref> In issue #4, it is revealed that Ross gives herself a dose of the Hulk serum and becomes She-Hulk.<ref>''Ultimate Wolverine vs. Hulk'' #4</ref> Later in the series, [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]] reveals that S.H.I.E.L.D. is working to keep her transformations under control.<ref>''Ultimate Wolverine vs. Hulk'' #6</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
* In "The Incredible Hulk" portion of the 1966 animated ''[[The Marvel Superheroes]]'', voiced by [[Peg Dixon]], it depicted Betty as a civilian hanger on with no apparent function in the Gamma Bomb as in the comics, other than the fact that she was General Thaddeus E. "''Thunderbolt''" Ross' daughter and only child.
* In the [[The Incredible Hulk (1982 animated TV series)|1982 ''Incredible Hulk'' animated series]] voiced by [[Betty Jean Ward|B.J. Ward]]. In this incarnation, Betty is a research scientist working alongside Bruce Banner at Gamma Base. Like the 1966 series, Betty (as are most of the series regulars, other than [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]]) is unaware that Banner transforms into the Hulk.
* Betty Ross appears in the 1996 ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1996 TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' TV series voiced originally by [[Genie Francis]] and later voiced by [[Philece Sampler]]. Like in many comic book incarnations, Betty is seen here trying to find a cure for Bruce Banner, who becomes the Hulk whenever enraged. She is a main character, appearing throughout the entire series.

===Film===
* In the 2003 film, ''[[Hulk (film)|Hulk]]'', Betty Ross is played by [[Jennifer Connelly]] and by [[Rhiannon Leigh Wryn]] (as a child). She is Bruce's girlfriend and scientific colleague. She is the second person to learn about the Hulk, when Banner saves her from his father's gamma-enhanced dogs, and is the only person capable of calming the Hulk down. At the conclusion of the film, when Banner has been declared dead, she is contacted by her father, asking if she has heard from Banner, but she coldly informs him that, even if Bruce was alive, she hopes he ''wouldn't'' contact her (her phone lines are all being tapped), and that she loves him.

* Betty Ross appears in the animated films ''[[Ultimate Avengers]]'' and ''[[Ultimate Avengers 2]]'' voiced by [[Nan McNamara]].

* In the 2008 ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' (which is not directly related to the 2003 film) film, Betty Ross is played by [[Liv Tyler]]. Like Banner, Ross is a Harvard graduate and is now a cell biology professor. In the time she and Banner were separated (clips in the opening credits sequence imply that she was injured during Banner's initial transformations into the Hulk, although she doesn't seem to hate or distrust him for his actions), she began dating [[Doc Samson|Dr. Leonard Samson]]. After Bruce's sudden return, she begins desperately trying to help him in any way she can. She believes that the Hulk isn't a true monster (though Bruce still sees it that way), due to him not hurting her in his second transformed state, and even takes him to Samuel Sterns, who attempts to cure him, but with no success; Sterns's treatment merely halts Banner's transformation at the time rather than curing him permanently. By the end of the movie she and Bruce are separated once more, although the two remain in contact with each other in secret.
* An older Betty Ross appears in ''[[Next Avengers: Heroes of Tomorrow]]'' voiced by [[Nicole Oliver]]. She helps an elderly Tony Stark and the children of the dead Avengers convince Hulk to help fight Ultron and his Iron Avengers.

* In ''[[Hulk Vs.|Hulk vs. Thor]]'', Betty (again voiced by Nicole Oliver) appears in Bruce's dream in which he's married and has a young son.

===Video games===
* Betty Ross first appears in the [[Hulk (video game)|Hulk]] video game voiced by [[Katie Bennison]]. She has been captured by [[Madman (Marvel Comics)|Madman]] as a hostage to prevent the Hulk attacking them. She later helps Bruce escape captivity in the military base and develop an antidote for the serums they have given him to suppress his transformation into the Hulk.
* Betty Ross appears in video game adaption of ''[[The Incredible Hulk (2008 video game)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' voiced by [[Liv Tyler]]. One mission features Banner attempting to rescue her from military forces after arriving at her university. Another mission has her captured by Hulkbusters on Glenn Talbot's orders. When she tells the Hulkbuster fighting Hulk that she is General Thunderbolt Ross' daughter, the Hulkbusters stop their attack and free her. One side-mission not related to the story has Hulk taking Betty on a shopping spree while out running the military.
* The Red She-Hulk and Ultimate She-Hulk forms, both Betty Ross, are available as alternate costumes for [[She-Hulk]] in ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds]]''.
