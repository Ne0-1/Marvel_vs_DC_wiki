==Characters==

*'''Golgoth''' - the [[Emperor]] of the world. He is human and at the beginning of the series it is revealed that his wife is dead but his daughter is still alive, who he visits often. He is ruthless and ensures the loyalty of his Ministers through the use of a highly addictive, booster drug called ''Eucharist''. His powers seemingly come from his armour and he is never in the series seen without his mask. His powers include hand blasts and [[teleportation]], a technology that greatly helped his fight against the world.
*'''Delfi''' - Golgoth's daughter resides in the Empire's citadel and is treated by the Emperor and its people, as basically a secluded princess. Golgoth keeps his business and ruthlessness secret from her and she seemingly knows nothing about his real actions that he does in pursuit of his goals. She spends the majority of her day studying or seemingly reading books that are recommended to her by the Emperor.
*'''Xanna''' - Minister of Execution. She is the Emperor's chief assassin but she is bored with her position because the Emperor has killed most of his enemies and instead chooses to ponder the origins of the Eucharist drug.
*'''Tumbril''' - Minister of Discipline. The Emperor's chief Torturer who uses all manners of acquiring information from the enemies of the Empire.
*'''Lohkyn''' - The newly appointed Minister of Espionage. 
*'''Lucullan''' - The Minister of War. He is known for frequently fumbling his words. He first met Golgoth in Australia 10 years prior to the events of issue 0.
*'''Kafra''' - Head of the Ministry of Information. Kafra has been modified and bound to his workstation for the purpose of co-ordinating and editing the news of the world to best represent the intentions and goals of the Empire.
*'''Sebirus''' - the Emperor's Domestic Advisor and an old friend of the Emperor. He knew the Emperor's wife before she died, and is close to Delfi. Due to his friendship and loyalty to the Emperor, he believes that he is the only indispensable member of the cabinet.
