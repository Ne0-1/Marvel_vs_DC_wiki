'''Malekith the Accursed''' is a [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Universe]].  He is ruler of the [[Elves (Marvel Comics)|Dark Elves]] of [[Svartalfheim (comics)|Svartalfheim]], and has come into conflict with [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].  He once wielded the [[Casket of Ancient Winters]].

==Fictional character biography==
Malekith struck an alliance with [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] on behalf of the fire demon [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]].<ref>''Thor'' #344</ref> He took control of a number of Earth humans using special food of the faerie provided by [[Hela (Marvel Comics)|Hela]]. Malekith then killed Eric Willis, guardian of the [[Casket of Ancient Winters]], after learning its location.<ref>''Thor'' #345</ref> As Master of the Hounds, Malekith hunted down Roger Willis, Eric's son and new guardian of the Casket. Malekith battled Thor, and kidnapped [[Lorelei (Asgardian)|Lorelei]].<ref>''Thor'' #346</ref> Using Lorelei as bait, Malekith forced Thor to battle [[Kurse|Algrim the Strong]], one of his Dark Elf followers, then attempted to destroy both combatants by plunging them into a pool of magma. He then captured the Casket of Ancient Winters from Roger Willis.<ref>''Thor'' #347</ref> Malekith was ultimately defeated by Thor, but not before he destroyed the Casket of Ancient Winters, releasing magical frigid force all over the Earth.<ref>''Thor'' #348</ref> Malekith was then brought as a captive by Thor to [[Asgard (Marvel Comics)|Asgard]].<ref>''Thor'' #349</ref>

Malekith later disguised Loki as himself to take his place in the dungeon, while he disguised himself as [[Balder (Marvel Comics)|Balder]], who was about to be crowned ruler of Asgard. [[Kurse]], the being formerly known as Algrim, saw through Malekith's disguise when he reached Asgard City. Kurse then broke Malekith's neck, apparently slaying him.<ref>''Thor'' #367</ref>

Years later, Malekith was revealed to be alive once again. Disguising himself as Balder once again, he enlisted [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] to attack Alflyse, the Dark Elf Queen of the Eastern Spires, while disguised as Thor.  His scheme unravels (partially due to the appearance of Thor disguised as Hercules), and he is easily defeated by [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]].<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #132, 136</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Malekith has all the normal attributes of a member of the race of dark elves, although his abilities are as a result of above average development. He possesses a gifted intellect, and superhuman strength, speed, stamina, durability, agility, and reflexes.

As a dark elf, Malekith also has the ability to manipulate the forces of magic for a variety of effects, including teleportation, energy projection, physical malleability, flight (by transforming into mist) illusion casting, and the ability to change the shape and appearance of other beings or objects.

Malekith has a vulnerability to iron, which disrupts or cancels his magical spells.

==Other versions==
Malekith appeared in an issue of ''[[Marvel Adventures]]: [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' where he tries to take over [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] with the help of the [[Giants (Marvel Comics)|Frost Giants]], but he was defeated with the combined efforts of the Avengers and Thor.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Malekith appears in ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]'' episode "The Casket of Ancient Winters", voiced by [[Quinton Flynn]]. He has discovered Odin's hiding place for the Casket of Ancient Winters on the orders of Loki (who had released him from the Realm of the Dead) and Enchantress. When Enchantress and Executioner meet Malekith to retrieve the Casket, he uses it on them in order "to see if it's the true casket," unleashing a harsh everlasting winter on the Earth. Thor, Iron Man, and Black Panther encounter Malekith. After freezing Thor, Malekith states that his plan is to release the other dead Dark Elves and make Midgard their own realm. Malekith then unleashed his hounds on Iron Man and Black Panther. Through the battle Iron Man finally frees Thor as he attacks Malekith. With advice from Black Panther to combine their powers of magic and science, Thor uses his lightning on Iron Man's armor to take down Malekith. Thor then closes the Casket of Ancient Winters reversing its effects across the globe. Before they can secure the Casket of Ancient Winters, a thawed-out Enchantress steals it from the Avengers and disappears.

===Film===
* In the Marvel animated feature ''[[Hulk Vs|Hulk vs Thor]]'', Malekith makes a brief cameo at the start of the film.<ref>''Hulk vs Thor''</ref>
