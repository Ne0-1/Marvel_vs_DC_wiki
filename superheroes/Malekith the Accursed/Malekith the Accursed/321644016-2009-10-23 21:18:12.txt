'''Malekith the Accursed''' is a [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Universe]].  He is ruler of the [[Svartálfar|Dark Elves]] of [[Svartalfheim (comics)|Svartalfheim]], and has come into conflict with [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].  He once wielded the [[Casket of Ancient Winters]]. He was slain while trying to take the crown of Asgard, disguised as Balder.

==Fictional character biography==
Malekith struck an alliance with [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] on behalf of [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]].<ref>''Thor'' #344</ref> He took control of a number of Earth humans using special food of the faerie provided by [[Hela (Marvel Comics)|Hela]]. Malekith then killed Eric Willis, guardian of the [[Casket of Ancient Winters]], after learning its location.<ref>''Thor'' #345</ref> As Master of the Hounds, Malekith hunted down Roger Willis, Eric's son and new guardian of the Casket. Malekith battled Thor, and kidnapped [[Lorelei (Asgardian)|Lorelei]].<ref>''Thor'' #346</ref> Using Lorelei as bait, Malekith forced Thor to battle [[Kurse|Algrim the Strong]], one of his Dark Elf followers, then attempted to destroy both combatants by plunging them into a pool of magma. He then captured the Casket of Ancient Winters from Roger Willis.<ref>''Thor'' #347</ref> Malekith was ultimately defeated by Thor, but not before he destroyed the Casket of Ancient Winters, releasing magical frigid force all over the Earth.<ref>''Thor'' #348</ref> Malekith was then brought as a captive by Thor to [[Asgard (Marvel Comics)|Asgard]].<ref>''Thor'' #349</ref>

Malekith later disguised Loki as himself to take his place in the dungeon, while he disguised himself as [[Balder (Marvel Comics)|Balder]], who was about to be crowned ruler of Asgard.  [[Kurse]], the being formerly known as Algrim, saw through Malekith's disguise when he reached Asgard City.  Kurse then broke Malekith's neck, apparently slaying him.<ref>''Thor'' #367</ref>

Years later, Malekith was revealed to be alive once again.  Disguising himself as Balder once again, he enlisted [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] to attack Alflyse, the Dark Elf Queen of the Eastern Spires.  His scheme humorously unravels, and he is easily defeated by [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]].<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #132, 136</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Malekith has all the normal attributes of a member of the race of dark elves, although his abilities are as a result of above average development. He possesses a gifted intellect, and superhuman strength, speed, stamina, durability, agility, and reflexes.

Malekith also has the ability to manipulate the forces of magic for a variety of effects, including teleportation, energy projection, physical malleability, flight (by transforming into mist) illusion casting, and the ability to change the shape and appearance of other beings or objects.

Malekith has a vulnerability to iron, which disrupts or cancels his magical spells.

==Other versions==
Malekith appeared in an issue of ''[[Marvel Adventures]]: [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' where he tries to take over [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] with the help of the [[Jötunn|Frost Giants]], but he was defeated with the combined efforts of the Avengers and Thor.
