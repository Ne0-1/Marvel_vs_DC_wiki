'''Malekith the Accursed''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|æ|l|ə|k|ɪ|θ}}) is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is the ruler of the [[Elves (Marvel Comics)|Dark Elves]] of [[Svartálfar|Svartalfheim]], and has come into conflict with [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. He once wielded the Casket of Ancient Winters.

The character was portrayed by [[Christopher Eccleston]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]''.

==Publication history==
Created by [[Walt Simonson]], Malekith first appeared in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' #344–349 (June–November 1984). He subsequently appeared in issues #363 (January 1986), 366-368 (April–June 1986), 485–487 (April–June 1995), and 489 (August 1995) of ''Thor''.

He made guest appearances in ''[[X-Force]] and [[Cable (comic book)|Cable Annual]]'' 1997 and ''[[Heroes for Hire]]'' #14 (August 1998) before again battling Thor in ''Thor'' vol. 2, #29-32 (November 2000 – February 2001). He later appeared in ''[[The Incredible Hercules]]'' #134 (November 2009) and #136 (December 2009).

In 2012, Jason Aaron revived him in the ''Thor: God of Thunder'' series and he became the main antagonist in the "All New, All Different" ''Thor'' volume 4.

==Fictional character biography==
Malekith grew up during a time of war in [[Svartalfheim]]. Twelve of his older brothers died during a war with the trolls. His mother eventually sold him for two sacks of snake livers and half a barrel of pickled toads. He worked as a body burner, who cremated bodies after a battle, until he was captured by trolls. In his prison he met a wizard, who helped him escape and took him as an apprentice. Eventually the Wizard wanted to combine their powers for peace, but Malekith refused because he felt that any peace would mean that the war which forged him would have been pointless, making his existence something which wasn't meant to be. He then killed the wizard, who before dying scarred his face, and then his mother, taking the dogs of the Wild Hunt.<ref>''Thor: God of Thunder'' # 25</ref>

Later, Malekith struck an alliance with [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] on behalf of the fire demon [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]].<ref>''Thor'' #344</ref> He took control of a number of Earth humans using special food of the faerie provided by [[Hela (Marvel Comics)|Hela]]. Malekith then killed Eric Willis, guardian of the [[Casket of Ancient Winters]], after learning its location.<ref>''Thor'' #345</ref> As Master of the Hounds, Malekith hunted down Roger Willis, Eric's son and new guardian of the Casket. Malekith battled Thor, and kidnapped [[Lorelei (Asgardian)|Lorelei]].<ref>''Thor'' #346</ref> Using Lorelei as bait, Malekith forced Thor to battle [[Kurse|Algrim the Strong]], one of his Dark Elf followers, then attempted to destroy both combatants by plunging them into a pool of magma. He then captured the Casket of Ancient Winters from Roger Willis.<ref>''Thor'' #347</ref> Malekith was ultimately defeated by Thor, but not before he destroyed the Casket of Ancient Winters, releasing magical frigid force all over the Earth.<ref>''Thor'' #348</ref> Malekith was then brought as a captive by Thor to [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]].<ref>''Thor'' #349</ref>

Malekith later disguised Loki as himself to take his place in the dungeon, while he disguised himself as [[Balder (comics)|Balder]], who was about to be crowned ruler of Asgard. [[Kurse]], the being formerly known as Algrim, saw through Malekith's disguise when he reached Asgard City. Kurse then broke Malekith's neck, apparently slaying him.<ref>''Thor'' #367</ref>

Years later, Malekith was revealed to be alive once again. Disguising himself as Balder again, he enlisted [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] to attack Alflyse, the Dark Elf Queen of the Eastern Spires, while disguised as Thor. His scheme unraveled (partially due to the appearance of Thor disguised as Hercules), and he was easily defeated by [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]].<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #132, 136</ref>

Malekith has resurfaced again intent on collecting [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]]'s rings.<ref>''Iron Man'' Vol. 5 #22, Kieron Gillen, 2014</ref> The other ring-bearing hosts were later to meet their demise or mutilation at the hands of Malekith. In the storyline "Rings of the Mandarin", it is revealed that after reclaiming his kingdom Svartalfheim he was approached by a ring seeking a host, but bent its will to his rather than letting it control his mind. He has now begun a campaign to attack all other "Mandarins" and take their rings, desiring "the full set" before attacking Tony Stark. Though he is usually a foe of Thor and other magical beings, his opposition to Iron Man is rooted in Elves' traditional weakness towards iron.<ref>''Iron Man'' Vol. 5 #23.NOW</ref>

Malekith, who escaped from his prison in [[Niffleheim]], rampages across the nine-realms in a path of revenge, targeting any Dark Elf who isn't loyal to him. Despite this fratricide, the dark elf council ends up electing him as his king, as Dark Elves respect those they fear. However, the opposition to Malekith had drawn together the other races of the realms, causing a new level of understanding and cooperation. The enemies of the realms made note of this and drew together as well.<ref>''Thor: God Of Thunder'' #13 - #17 (2013 - 2014)</ref>

Malekith the Accursed later causes Thor to lose his left arm in combat after a woman (later revealed to be [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]]<ref>''Thor'' vol.4 #8</ref>) lifted Mjolnir and gained Thor's powers. Malekith's plans crossed over with the [[Minotaur (comics)|Minotaur]] of [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon]]'s desires for more power sources.<ref>''Thor'' Vol. 4 #1-4</ref> Malekith and Minotaur came to a deal: Dario would give him the Skull of [[Laufey (comics)|Laufey]] in exchange of the mineral rights of all realms Malekith conquers. Thor appeared in the roof of Roxxon Island to stop their deal, but she was attacked by the [[Serpent (comics)|Serpent]] who was possessing the [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer Armor]].<ref>''Thor'' Vol 4 #6</ref> The Serpent threw Thor out of Roxxon Island and they continued battling in the oil fields below. After flying away, Malekith convinced Minotaur to celebrate their deal in the Dark Elf way and he teleported the two of them to Alfheim where they slaughtered various Light Elves.<ref>''Thor'' Vol. 4 7</ref> Then Malekith and Minotaur went to Jotunheim. Using the blood of a hundred murdered Light Elves, Malekith performed a spell that resurrected King Laufey.<ref>''Thor'' Vol. 4 #8</ref>

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event, Malekith the Accursed appears as a member of the Dark Council alongside Minotaur, [[Ulik]], Laufey, and some unnamed Fire Demons.<ref>''Mighty Thor'' Vol. 2 #1 (2016)</ref> As before, Malekith is focusing on murdering Light Elves.

==Powers and abilities==
Malekith has all the normal attributes of a member of the race of dark elves, although his abilities are a result of above-average development. He possesses superhuman intellect, strength, speed, stamina, durability, agility and reflexes.

As a dark elf, Malekith also has the ability to manipulate the forces of magic for a variety of effects, including teleportation, energy projection, physical malleability, flight (by transforming into mist), illusion casting, and the ability to change the shape and appearance of other beings or objects.

Malekith, like all Dark Elves, has a vulnerability to iron, which disrupts or cancels his magical spells.
