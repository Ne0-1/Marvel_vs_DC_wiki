==Fictional character biography==
Malekith struck an alliance with [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] on behalf of the fire demon [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]].<ref>''Thor'' #344</ref> He took control of a number of Earth humans using special food of the faerie provided by [[Hela (Marvel Comics)|Hela]]. Malekith then killed Eric Willis, guardian of the [[Casket of Ancient Winters]], after learning its location.<ref>''Thor'' #345</ref> As Master of the Hounds, Malekith hunted down Roger Willis, Eric's son and new guardian of the Casket. Malekith battled Thor, and kidnapped [[Lorelei (Asgardian)|Lorelei]].<ref>''Thor'' #346</ref> Using Lorelei as bait, Malekith forced Thor to battle [[Kurse|Algrim the Strong]], one of his Dark Elf followers, then attempted to destroy both combatants by plunging them into a pool of magma. He then captured the Casket of Ancient Winters from Roger Willis.<ref>''Thor'' #347</ref> Malekith was ultimately defeated by Thor, but not before he destroyed the Casket of Ancient Winters, releasing magical frigid force all over the Earth.<ref>''Thor'' #348</ref> Malekith was then brought as a captive by Thor to [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]].<ref>''Thor'' #349</ref>

Malekith later disguised Loki as himself to take his place in the dungeon, while he disguised himself as [[Balder (comics)|Balder]], who was about to be crowned ruler of Asgard. [[Kurse]], the being formerly known as Algrim, saw through Malekith's disguise when he reached Asgard City. Kurse then broke Malekith's neck, slaying him.<ref>''Thor'' #367</ref>

Years later, Malekith was revealed to be alive once again. Disguising himself as Balder again, he enlisted [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] to attack Alflyse, the Dark Elf Queen of the Eastern Spires, while disguised as Thor.  His scheme unraveled (partially due to the appearance of Thor disguised as Hercules), and he was easily defeated by [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]].<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #132, 136</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Malekith has all the normal attributes of a member of the race of dark elves, although his abilities are as a result of above-average development. He possesses superhuman intellect, strength, speed, stamina, durability, agility, and reflexes.

As a dark elf, Malekith also has the ability to manipulate the forces of magic for a variety of effects, including teleportation, energy projection, physical malleability, flight (by transforming into mist), illusion casting, and the ability to change the shape and appearance of other beings or objects.

Malekith has a vulnerability to iron, which disrupts or cancels his magical spells.

==Other versions==
Malekith appeared in an issue of ''[[Marvel Adventures: The Avengers]]'' where he tries to take over [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] with the help of the [[Giants (Marvel Comics)|Frost Giants]], but he was defeated with the combined efforts of the Avengers and Thor.{{issue|date=August 2012}}
