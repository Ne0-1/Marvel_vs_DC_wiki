'''Beta Ray Bill''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appears in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]''  #337 (Nov. 1983) and was created by writer-artist [[Walt Simonson]].

==Publication history==
== Origin ==
Beta Ray Bill was created by [[Walt Simonson]] as a new concept for the title ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' :

{{cquote|I wanted to start fresh, and I thought a new character would be the way to go on that. My thinking was that comics are a short form, and one of the things that's mostly true about comics characters are what they look like ... I designed Bill deliberately as a monster, because I knew that people would look at it and go, "Oh my God, it's this evil guy." I deliberately wrote them so you weren't sure in the beginning if he was a good guy or a bad guy ... I chose the name for its alliterative qualities. Originally I was going to call him 'Beta Ray Jones' because I really wanted a common name. My feeling was Bill was [[Everyman]] for this alien race .... I deleted 'Jones' because ... there were too many Joneses floating around the Marvel Universe.<ref>Cooke, John B. (June 2004) "Walt Simonson Interviewed" in ''Jack Kirby Collector'' #14, collected in ''Collected Jack Kirby Collector Volume 3'', ISBN 1893905020, page 114</ref>}}

Bill debuted in ''Thor'' #337 (Nov. 1983), being established the character as an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] belonging to a race known as the [[List of Marvel Comics alien races#K|Korbinites]].

==Biography==
=== 1980s ===
Spy organization [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] detect an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] fleet passing through Earth's solar system, with Director [[Nick Fury]] asking Thor to investigate. When Thor finds the advance ship, it scans the Thunder God and perceives him to be a threat.  Unable to stop Thor, the sentient ship - called "Skuttlebutt" -  revives Beta Ray Bill, who is in [[suspended animation]]. Bill battles Thor to standstill until the ship reaches Earth's orbit, where one of the mystical enchantments of Thor's hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]] comes into effect, being that the Thunder God will revert back to his mortal persona of Donald Blake if separated from the hammer for more than sixty seconds. Blake is knocked unconscious by Bill, who examines Blake's cane (Mjolnir's "shell" when Thor is in Blake's form) and on striking the cane receives Thor's power and costume. 

Once Skuttlebutt arrives on Earth, Bill easily defeats an approaching S.H.I.E.L.D. team and is then transported to Asgard by the King of the Norse Gods, [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]], who mistakes Bill for Thor. After some initial confusion, Odin returns Thor to Asgard, and Bill's origin is revealed. Bill's race, the Korbinites, who are almost rendered [[extinct]] when their  [[galaxy]] explodes. The remnants of the Korbonite race flee in a fleet of warships, guarded by a [[sentient]] ship called "Skuttlebutt" and a dedicated champion, Beta Ray Bill. Via Korbonite science, Bill was physically augmented and given the attributes of an [[indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] wild beast (a process that kills all of Bill's predecessors). Skuttlebutt also attacked Thor as the ship recognizes the Asgardian magic as similar to that the previous global threat, and assumed the Korbonites are being threatened once again. 

On discovering that Bill was worthy enough to lift Mjolnir, Odin proposes a battle to the death in the Asgardian realm of ''Skartheim'' to decide who will wield the hammer. Bill and Thor render each other [[unconsciousness|unconscious]], although Bill's resistance to heat allows him to recover first, and is deemed the winner. Odin, however, bestows upon Bill a different hammer — Stormbreaker — which is equal in power to Mjolnir. Odin also bestows the ability upon Bill to return to his original Korbinite form by striking Stormbreaker upon the ground. After learning that the mishap that killed most of Bill's people was caused by the fire [[demon]] [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]], Bill agrees to join the Asgardians in a war to stop Surtur and his armies.<ref>''Thor'' #337-340 (Nov. 1983 - Feb. 1984) </ref>

Bill leads many of Earth's heroes against Surtur's forces on Earth while Thor, Odin, and Thor's adopted brother [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] confront Surtur in Asgard. Surtur is eventually defeated, but apparently kills Odin.<ref>''Thor'' #341-353 (Dec. 1983 - Dec. 1984)</ref> Bill remains on Earth, aiding the [[Spaceknights|spaceknight]] [[Rom (comics)|Rom]] against the threat of the alien [[Dire Wraith]]s<ref>''Rom'' #65 (Apr. 1985)</ref> and foes such as [[Iron Man]] opponent [[Titanium Man]].<ref>''Thor'' #354 (Apr. 1985); #357 - 358 (July - Aug. 1985)</ref>

=== 2000s ===

Although Bill attempts to aid the Asgardians, Thor [[teleport]]s Bill away as it is not his destiny to die in Ragnarök.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #83 - 85 (Oct. - Dec. 2004)</ref>

Bill visits his people's new homeworld, where he is attacked by his [[insane]] predecessor, ''Alpha Ray'', defeating him just as the [[cosmic entities (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entity]] [[Galactus]] and his herald [[Stardust (Marvel Comics)|Stardust]] arrive. Despite Bill's efforts, Galactus consumes the world and almost kills him, with Bill drifting in space until recovered by Skuttlebutt. After finding an [[orb]] containing the [[soul]]s of many of the Korbinites, Bill revisits a desolate Asgard, and joins forces with Stardust to battle a new demonic menace named ''Asteroth''. 

Although victorious, Bill is mortally wounded, and while near death is healed by an unknown entity that also claims the remaining souls in the orb. Placed in the recently-deceased body of a [[war veteran]] named ''Simon Walters'' (a reference to his creator, Walt Simonson) on Earth, Bill has a brief encounter with the villain ''Boar'' and hero [[Spider-Man]]. <ref>''Stormbreaker: The Saga of Beta Ray Bill'' #1-6 (March-Aug. 2005)</ref> Bill eventually finds and joins [[Canadian]] superhero team ''[[Omega Flight]]'' against the supervillain team the [[Wrecking Crew (comics)|Wrecking Crew]], who release the [[supernatural]] [[Great Beasts]]. The battle ends with Bill and the Beasts trapped in an alternate dimension.<ref>''Omega Flight'' #1-5 (April-Aug. 2007)</ref> 

During the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline,<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #1-8 (June 2008 - Jan. 2009)</ref> Bill is wounded and captured by the alien [[Skrull]]s, who bestow his hammer Stormbreaker on a warrior [[Super-Skrull]] called the ''Godkiller''. Thor rescues Bill, and after being nursed back to health, the character retrieves his hammer then tricks and defeats the Godkiller.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Thor'' #1-3 (Oct.-Dec. 2008)</ref> 

Bill decides to hunt the cosmic entity, [[Galactus|Galactus]] to avenge the destruction of the Korbinites' second homeworld, and the seeming eradication of his species. After a brief confrontation with the herald, Stardust, Bill is intercepted by the [[Silver Surfer]], who is puzzled by the Korbinite's apparently futile quest to destroy Galactus. During a brief battle, Bill explains that while he understands he cannot hope to destroy Galactus with his power alone, he intends to destroy Galactus by annihilating any and all worlds Galactus seeks to feed from, thus starving him to death. The character's obsession with stopping Galactus eventually results in him being unable to lift his own enchanted weapon, an object that can only be wielded by the worthy.<ref>''Beta Ray Bill: Godhunter'' #1-2 (Aug.-Sept. 2009)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Beta Ray Bill's life force and consciousness were transferred by scientists of his race into the body of an alien carnivorous equine-like beast that had been bionically restructured into a cyborg. Courtesy of highly advanced genetic engineering, the character possesses superhuman strength; reflexes; stamina, and durability and a highly extended lifespan. Beta Ray Bill's weapon, Stormbreaker, also has the same properties as Thor's hammer, [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]], and includes the ability to transform into a cane when struck upon the ground and return Bill to his unaltered Korbinite form. Bill also possesses the advanced and sentient warship Skuttlebutt.
