'''Beta Ray Bill''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appears in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]''  #337 (Nov. 1983) and was created by writer-artist [[Walt Simonson]].

Debuting in the [[Bronze Age of Comic Books]], Beta Ray Bill has featured in other Marvel-endorsed products such as [[:category:Marvel Comics animation|animated television series]]; [[video game]]s, and merchandise such as [[action figure]]s and [[trading card]]s. 

==Publication history==
Beta Ray Bill was created by [[Walt Simonson]] as a new concept for the title ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]''. Simonson said,

{{blockquote|''I wanted to start fresh, and I thought a new character would be the way to go on that. My thinking was that comics are a short form, and one of the things that's mostly true about comics characters are what they look like ... I designed Bill deliberately as a monster, because I knew that people would look at it and go, "Oh my God, it's this evil guy." I deliberately wrote them so you weren't sure in the beginning if he was a good guy or a bad guy ... I chose the name for its alliterative qualities. Originally I was going to call him 'Beta Ray Jones' because I really wanted a common name. My feeling was Bill was [[Everyman]] for this alien race ... I deleted 'Jones' because ... there were too many Joneses floating around the Marvel Universe.''<ref>Cooke, John B. (June 2004) "Walt Simonson Interviewed", ''Jack Kirby Collector'' #14, collected in ''Collected Jack Kirby Collector Volume 3'', ISBN 1-893905-02-0, page 114</ref>}}

During a "Thor Spotlight" panel at the Baltimore Comic Con, August 28, 2010, Simonson further stated:

{{blockquote|''One of the cool things about Thor was the enchantment around Mjolnir and the original inscription on it. So I thought, well that means someone else can pick up this hammer and get this power, if they're worthy! So since then, some other big characters, people's favorites, have picked up the hammer, Captain America, Superman, whoever. But at this point, no one had ever picked up the hammer. I liked the idea of Cap walking to the bathroom and seeing it, and grabbing and just tugging, not being able to. So this had to be someone new. This is the most powerful weapon of the Norse gods. This hammer is a killing weapon. It's used to kill Frost Giants and others. So, Superman couldn't pick it up, cause he's never going to kill anyone, and the hammer knows that. Captain America, he's too patriotic. He's too much a symbol of America to be chosen by this Norse artifact. So he couldn't get it. So I created Bill because he's noble, and he's designed to kill. He's got a great purpose as a warrior, and also the noble ability. That makes him "worthy" whatever that may be.''

''As far as appearance, back then, comics were these self-contained stories. So for Bill, I had to this in short form. This was a four-issue story, and that was my longest on my entire run on Thor. We had to take him, make him into a character that the Hammer would recognize. So I wanted for Bill, I wanted him to have a "monstrous" look as a visual, so that everyone would think he's a bad guy, and I got letters after the first issue that said "What on earth? Why is this monster picking up the hammer, what's wrong with you?" and I said "I got it!" So I basically started with a skull, and then I made him a bit like a horse, with the gap behind the teeth. But horses are beautiful creatures. So what I was aiming for is a sense of death, a sense of monster, underlined by beauty. His costume was the same so that the minute you see that image, when he strikes the stick and becomes "Beta Ray Thor" or whatever, you know: OK, that guy has the powers of Thor. So that's why Bill had the monstrous face, that's why that stuff was done the way it was done.''<ref>[http://www.cosmicbooknews.com/news/wsimonson_brbill "Thor Spotlight" panel; Baltimore Comic Con; August 28, 2010.

Bill debuted in ''Thor'' #337 (Nov. 1983), being established as an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] belonging to a race known as the [[List of Marvel Comics alien races#K|Korbinites]].

==Character biography==
=== 1980s ===
Spy organization [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] detect an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] fleet passing through Earth's solar system, with Director [[Nick Fury]] asking Thor to investigate. When Thor finds the advance ship, it scans the Thunder God and perceives him to be a threat.  Unable to stop Thor, the sentient ship - called ''Skuttlebutt'' -  revives Beta Ray Bill, who is in [[suspended animation]]. Bill battles Thor to standstill until the ship reaches Earth's orbit, where one of the mystical enchantments of Thor's hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]] comes into effect, being that the Thunder God will revert back to his mortal persona of Donald Blake if separated from the hammer for more than sixty seconds. Blake is knocked unconscious by Bill, who examines Blake's cane (Mjolnir's "shell" when Thor is in Blake's form) and on striking the cane receives Thor's power and costume. 

Once ''Skuttlebutt'' arrives on Earth, Bill easily defeats an approaching S.H.I.E.L.D. team and is then transported to Asgard by the King of the Norse Gods, [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]], who mistakes Bill for Thor. After some initial confusion, Odin returns Thor to Asgard, and Bill's origin is revealed. Bill's race, the Korbinites, are almost rendered [[extinct]] when their  [[galaxy]] explodes. The remnants of the Korbonite race flee in a fleet of warships, guarded by a [[sentient]] ship called ''Skuttlebutt'' and a dedicated champion, Beta Ray Bill. Via Korbonite science, Bill was physically augmented and given the attributes of an [[indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] wild beast (a process that killed all of Bill's predecessors). ''Skuttlebutt'' attacked Thor because the ship recognized the Asgardian magic as similar to that of the previous global threat, and assumed the Korbonites were being threatened once again. 

On discovering that Bill was worthy enough to lift Mjolnir, Odin proposes a battle to the death in the fiery Asgardian realm of Skartheim to decide who will wield the hammer. Bill and Thor render each other [[unconsciousness|unconscious]], although Bill's resistance to heat allows him to recover first, and is deemed the winner, he saves Thor from going over a lava flow, believing he is too worthy an opponent to die. After Bill reconsiders his claim to the hammer, Odin creates a compromise by bestowing upon Bill a different hammer — Stormbreaker — which is equal in power to Mjolnir. Odin also bestows the ability upon Bill to return to his original Korbinite form by striking Stormbreaker upon the ground. After learning that the mishap that killed most of Bill's people was caused by the fire [[demon]] [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]], Bill agrees to join the Asgardians in a war to stop Surtur and his armies.<ref>''Thor'' #337-340 (Nov. 1983 - Feb. 1984)</ref><ref>{{Cite web |first=Brian |last=Cronin |url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/07/21/a-year-of-cool-comics-day-202/ |title=A Year of Cool Comics – Day 202 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] CSBG Archive |date=July 21, 2010 |accessdate=September 28, 2010 }}</ref>

Bill leads many of Earth's heroes against Surtur's forces on Earth while Thor, Odin, and Thor's adopted brother [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] confront Surtur in Asgard.

=== 2000s ===
Bill also participates in a battle between the heroes of Earth and several alien races such as the [[Kree]], [[Shi'ar]], and [[List of Marvel Comics alien races#Z|Z'Nox]].<ref>''Maximum Security'' #1-2 (Dec. 2000); #3 (Jan. 2001)</ref> and after several adventures with Thor <ref>''Thor'' #30 - 33 (Dec. 2000 - Mar. 2001); #39 - 41 (Sep. - Nov. 2001)</ref> guest starring in the final storyline, when Thor - determined to end the perpetual cycle of death and rebirth the Asgardians are trapped in - brings about [[Ragnarök]] (in [[Norse mythology]] this event means the end of Asgard and its gods, as they die in battle against the armies of evil). Although Bill attempts to aid the Asgardians, Thor [[teleport]]s Bill away as it is not his destiny to die in Ragnarök.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 2, #83 - 85 (Oct. - Dec. 2004)</ref>

Bill visits his people's new homeworld, where he is attacked by his [[insane]] predecessor, ''Alpha Ray'', defeating him just as the [[cosmic entities (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entity]] [[Galactus]] and his herald [[Stardust (Marvel Comics)|Stardust]] arrive. Despite Bill's efforts, Galactus consumes the world and almost kills him, with Bill drifting in space until recovered by Skuttlebutt. After finding an [[orb]] containing the [[soul]]s of many of the Korbinites, Bill revisits a desolate Asgard, and joins forces with Stardust to battle a new demonic menace named ''Asteroth''. 

Although victorious, Bill is mortally wounded, and while near death is healed by an unknown entity that also claims the remaining souls in the orb. Placed in the recently-deceased body of a [[war veteran]] named ''Simon Walters'' (a reference to his creator, Walt Simonson) on Earth, Bill has a brief encounter with the villain ''Boar'' and hero [[Spider-Man]].<ref>[[Daniel Berman]] (w), [[Michael Oeming]] (w), [[Andrea Di Vito]] (p), ''Stormbreaker: The Saga of Beta Ray Bill'' #1-6 (March-Aug. 2005)</ref> Bill eventually finds and joins [[Canadian]] superhero team ''[[Omega Flight]]'' against the supervillain team the [[Wrecking Crew (comics)|Wrecking Crew]], who release the [[supernatural]] [[Great Beasts]]. The battle ends with Bill and the Beasts trapped in an alternate dimension.<ref>''Omega Flight'' #1-5 (April-Aug. 2007)</ref><ref>{{Cite web |first=Brian |last=Cronin |url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/07/29/a-year-of-cool-comics-day-210/ |title=A Year of Cool Comics – Day 210 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] CSBG Archive |date=July 29, 2010 |accessdate=September 28, 2010 }}</ref>

During the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline,<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #1-8 (June 2008 - Jan. 2009)</ref> Bill is wounded and captured by the alien [[Skrull]]s, who bestow his hammer Stormbreaker on a warrior [[Super-Skrull]] called the ''Godkiller''. Thor rescues Bill, although Loki starts a rumor that Bill may be a Skrull, causing some Asgardians to go against him despite Balder telling them to stop. Thor throws Mjolnir at Bill, who catches it proving he really is Bill. After being nursed back to health, the character retrieves his hammer. Although the Godkiller defeats him, with Thor's help he tricks the Godkiller, meaning Asgard falls onto it, killing the Skrull. Thor and Bill then raise the city again.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Thor'' #1-3 (Oct.-Dec. 2008)</ref> 

Bill decides to hunt the cosmic entity, [[Galactus]] to avenge the destruction of the Korbinites' second homeworld, and the seeming eradication of his species. After a brief confrontation with the herald, Stardust, Bill is intercepted by the [[Silver Surfer]], who is puzzled by the Korbinite's apparently futile quest to destroy Galactus. During a brief battle, Bill explains that while he understands he cannot hope to destroy Galactus with his power alone, he intends to destroy Galactus by annihilating any and all worlds Galactus seeks to feed from, thus starving him to death. The character's obsession with stopping Galactus eventually results in him being unable to lift his own enchanted weapon, an object that can only be wielded by the worthy.  Equipped with alien weapons, Bill finds Galactus  but discovers the entity already under attack by another race. In a moment of conscience, Bill saves Galactus. The grateful entity rewards Bill by creating a Korbinite mate for him, with Bill also regaining the ability to wield Stormbreaker.<ref>''Beta Ray Bill: Godhunter'' #1 - 3 (Aug.-Oct. 2009)</ref>

In ''[[The Thanos Imperative]]'' #3, he joins Nova's select group to travel across the Fault and into the Cancerverse.<ref>''[[The Thanos Imperative]]'' #3</ref>

Bill also helps save the Earth from an alien invasion, mostly by threats. As told to the aliens about Earth 'his girlfriend lives there'. <ref>S.W.O.R.D. Volume 1: No Time To Breathe (120 pages, July 2010, ISBN 0-7851-4076-X) (2010)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Beta Ray Bill's life force and consciousness were transferred by scientists of his race into the body of an alien carnivorous equine-like beast that had been bionically restructured into a cyborg. Courtesy of highly advanced genetic engineering, the character possesses superhuman strength; reflexes; stamina, and durability and a highly extended lifespan. Beta Ray Bill's weapon, Stormbreaker, also has the same properties as Thor's hammer, [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]], and includes the ability to transform into a cane when struck upon the ground and return Bill to his unaltered Korbinite form. Bill also possesses the advanced and sentient warship ''Skuttlebutt''.
