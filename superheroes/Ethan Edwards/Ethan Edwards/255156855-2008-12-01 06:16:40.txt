'''Ethan Edwards''' is a fictional character, a [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe. He is a [[pastiche]] of the [[DC Comics]] character [[Superman]]. He first appeared in ''[[Marvel Knights Spider-Man]]'' #13.

==History==
===Early life===
Ethan is a [[Skrull]], whose father created the [[Super-Skrull]], and was sent to Earth to conquer it in the aftermath of the Skrull homeworld's destruction at the hands of [[Galactus]]. On the night of his arrival, Ethan's Earth parents-to-be were driving home to their [[Iowa]] farm when a large metal object seemingly from space crashed with him inside. The couple decided that a [[miracle]] had occurred, that they were judged to be worthy and a child was given to them as a gift from [[God]]. The Edwards's gave him a strong [[moral]] background, taught him the [[Value theory|value]] of hard work and [[humility]]. Years later, Ethan told them he wanted to leave the farm and go to the city. As he prepared to leave, Mr. Edwards gave him a piece of advice he would never forget: that "with great power, there must also come great responsibility".

===[[Marvel Knights Spider-Man]]===
Arriving in [[New York City]], Ethan began work as the new star reporter at ''[[The Daily Bugle]]''. He also began fighting crime as a costumed [[superhero]], calling himself '''Virtue''', which soon brought him into contact with fellow Bugle employee and [[NYC]] superhero, [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]], the Amazing [[Spider-Man]], when the two heroes independently attempted to confront the [[Absorbing Man]], currently carrying out a series of hits on the orders of the [[Owl (comics)|Owl]].

Recognizing that he needs assistance in learning how to be a hero, Ethan approaches Peter for aid, with Peter reluctantly agreeing to take Ethan on as an 'apprentice'. To learn more about Ethan's powers, Spider-Man takes him to the [[Baxter Building]], where [[Reed Richards]] of the [[Fantastic Four]] performs tests on Ethan to uncover the origin of his powers. Reed discovers Ethan is as fast as the [[Human Torch]], can see [[Invisible Woman|Sue]] when she's invisible, lift as much weight as [[Thing (comics)|Ben]] and heal injuries.  

After a fight, the press show up and Virtue takes off to protect his identity, but the press got a full facial photograph of Ethan as Virtue. On the roof, Peter Parker tells Ethan they've got a picture of him, but he says it's okay because his glasses will hide his identity. They go inside and, as the two of them step out of the elevator, the press surrounds Ethan and want to talk to him.  Reed calls Peter to explain that Ethan is a [[Skrull]], whose father created the [[Super-Skrull]], and that Ethan was sent to Earth to conquer it in the aftermath of the Skrull homeworld's destruction at the hands of [[Galactus]].

Jonah calls Ethan into his office and tells him he'll let things go if he gives the paper the exclusive story on Virtue.  Ethan refuses and flies through the window. Peter goes after him but Ethan takes off again for Iowa, leaving Pete to wonder how he's going to get there. The [[Fantastic Four]] are examining the ship Ethan arrived in when a bright yellow light comes out of it. It shines on Ethan, who begins speaking another language until the Thing smashes it into the atmosphere. When Ethan re-awakens, he lashes out at the FF, then begins to have some sort of nervous breakdown before flying off, donning a new leather costume and brutally attacking the Absorbing Man.

Back at the Daily Bugle, Ethan Edwards researches who and what the [[Skrull]] are, coming to think he is a "murderous Skrull". Confused and angry, he searches the Baxter Building for Reed Richards, but the man isn't home. When [[Spider-Man]] and [[New Avengers (comic book)|The New Avengers]] arrive (Spider-Man having defeated the Absorbing Man thanks to a trap set up by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] when the Owl tried to escape his now-rogue 'employee'), a fight starts, but "[[Aunt May|a little old lady]]" (Aunt May) tells Ethan he's not a monster but a good man. Spider-Man tells Ethan he has something no one does, "healing power", and a lot of people out there need healing. Following this advice Ethan moved overseas to help the less fortunate. Later, Reed Richards revealed that the starship didn't give Ethan his ability to heal others, leaving Spider-Man to wonder where it actually came from.

===Secret Invasion===
At the Wizard World Chicago panel, ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' writer Brian Michael Bendis stated that Ethan Edwards has nothing to do with and will not be appearing in SI. Whether he's lying or not remains to be seen.

== Inspirations ==
The character's similar origins and abilities show the influence of Superman (albeit [[parody|parodied]] so that everything that works for Superman just seems stupid when Ethan does it), particularly with regards to an alien origin, a sole survivor of a race, and his arrival in the countryside of earth, where he was taken in by an older couple.  His powers also reflect those of Superman, such as super strength, flight, super speed and manoeuvrability, x-ray vision, and the ability to project beams (though from his hands rather than his eyes). However, he lacks the character's invulnerable 'aura', meaning that although he himself is never injured his costumes always end up in tatters.

His name may be derived from [[John Wayne]]'s character from [[John Ford]]'s ''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]]''.
