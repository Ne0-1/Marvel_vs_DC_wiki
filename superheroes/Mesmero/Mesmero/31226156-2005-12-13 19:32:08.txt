'''Mesmero''' is a [[Mutant (fictional)|fictional mutant]] character in the [[Marvel Universe]] of comics.  The character first appeared in ''[Uncanny] X-Men'' #49.

==History==
Mesmero was originally a small time crook who posed as a hypnotist at high society parties.  He would use his mutant powers to 'mesmerize' guests into giving him their possessions and then making them forget about them.  Mesmero drew the attention of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], who wanted him to hypnotize [[Polaris (comics)|Lorna Dane]] into believing that she was Magneto's daughter.

Mesmero succeeded in performing this task, however, a [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinel]] attack revealed that the Magneto who had approached Mesmero was actually a robot. Mesmero then attacked the X-Men, the real Magneto appeared.  The Master of Magnetism rendered Mesmero unconscious and stranded him in South America.

Mesmero has encountered the X-Men on a few other occasions as well as teams such as [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]], [[Fenris (comics)|Fenris]], the [[Dark Riders (comics)|Dark Riders]], and [[Alpha Flight]].

When Mesmero joined the latest incarnation of the [[Weapon X]] program, the [[Director (comics)|Director]] offered to increase Mesmero's hypnotic powers. Mesmero agreed and gained the ability to control entire crowds with a mere glance, instead of a mere handful of people.

To keep the public unaware of the "Neverland" mutant concentration camp, Mesmero posed as a government liaison. With this identity, he informed news reporters that "Neverland" doesn't exist nor is the government involved in abducting mutants.

While he was a member of Weapon X, Mesmero visited his dying mother. He had doctors help her as much as they could and used his powers to mesmerise his mother into believing she was healthy as ever. His mother knew it was an illusion, though, and she told him that she knew shortly before she died. Subsequently, Mesmero began to lose confidence in himself which caused him to lose his powers. Mesmero was transported to Neverland upon the Director's discovery of his power loss.

Brent Jackson, planning on raising a coup on Weapon X, rescued Mesmero. Mesmero spent several months in seclusion as Jackson helped him get his confidence back, and with it his powers.

But it was all naught; due to the [[Scarlet Witch]]'s magicks, Mesmero was on of the many mutants to lose his powers.

==Powers==
Mesmero is a mutant who has the ability to read and control other's minds. Mesmero has the ability to hypnotize others into doing what he wants them to do.  He can also make them see him as a different person.

===X-Men: Evolution===

In the ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'' animated series, Mesmero used the young X-Men to steal three rings. The three rings connected together with a golden rod to form a key that would open the first of three doors sealing away the oldest and most powerful being of all time... Apocalypse. 

After using [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] to steal half of a spider stone, Mesmero had a run-in with Magneto. [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] and Mastermind attempted to probe his memories and find out who he was. When Magneto found out about the spider and the doors, he did everything in his power to stop Mesmero. The second half of the spider stone was found in a museum. When Magneto put both halves of the spider stone together, a giant green spider appeared. It turned out that the spider stone was the key for the second door. Mesmero was able to trick Mastermind and, when Magneto destroyed the spider, he ended up opening the second of three doors that contains [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. 

With only one door left, Mesmero was closer than ever to his goal. He tricked [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] into helping him. Telling her that she and [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] would be safe if they helped him to release Apocalypse. Mystique believed him and was sneaked in as the key to the third door. Mystique turned into a snake and went through a hole in the door and touched the symbol of Apocalypse causing her to turn to stone. Apocalypse was released. But it seems all of Mesmero's loyalty was for nothing, because when Apocalypse forced his way past the teams and gained his freedom, he left Mesmero behind.
