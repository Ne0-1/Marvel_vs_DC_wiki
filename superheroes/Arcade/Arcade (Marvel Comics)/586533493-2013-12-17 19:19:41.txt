'''Arcade''' is a [[fiction]]al [[character (arts)|character]], a [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|Universe]] created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]. Arcade first appeared in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'', vol. 1, issue #65 (the same storyline was reprinted shortly thereafter in the black-and-white comic [[Marvel UK]] title ''[[Super Spider-Man & Captain Britain]]'' #248).<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #65 bears a cover date of January 1978. During this period, comic books published by Marvel Comics U.S.A. carried a [[cover date]] three months ''in advance'' of the actual date of publication. This means the actual publication date of ''Marvel Team-Up'' #65 was October 1977. The first issue of ''Super Spider-Man and Captain Britain'' to feature the Arcade storyline was published in England on November 8, 1977.</ref>

Arcade became one of the more popular villains in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]] during the 1980s, and did battle with many other superheroes. Although confrontations with him rarely last more than one or two issues (making him more of a "guest villain") he has done battle with numerous superheroes from various corners of the Marvel Universe, although he has never once defeated any of them.

==Fictional character biography==
A combination of [[villain#The evil genius villain|evil genius]] and [[hitman]], Arcade affects a manner of dress and speech that makes him appear to be a comedic character. This is part of his overall theme, which extends into his preferred method of [[murder]], an underground funhouse of colorful [[deathtrap (plot device)|deathtrap]]s, usually decked out in cheery colors and disguised as an [[amusement park]], which he has dubbed "'''Murderworld'''."

Arcade's [[back-story]], up to and including his real name, remains largely unknown even to this day. This is mainly the result of his knack for escaping once he has been defeated. According to the man himself, he was born into an extremely wealthy family and lived for much of his early life in, depending on the telling, a [[ranch]] in [[Texas]], or a [[mansion]] in [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]].<ref>''All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update'' #1</ref> At the age of either eighteen or twenty-one, again depending on the telling, his [[allowance (money)|allowance]] was cut off by his father, who declared that he did not deserve it. In retaliation, Arcade murders his father, thus inheriting all of the man's vast [[estate (law)|estate]]. Given his propensity for deception, this origin story can hardly be taken at face value.

Now independently wealthy and free to do as he pleased, Arcade became a freelance [[assassination|assassin]], traveling across the world, killing people in rather mundane fashions, and amassing even more wealth than he already had. He quickly grew bored with doing business as an ordinary hired killer and resolved to find a way to continue his work in a manner more suited to his sensibilities.

Discovering an aptitude for technology, Arcade designed and built his first Murderworld, a subterranean evil lair disguised as a very deadly amusement park. From this base, and with the help of two mysterious assistants named '''Miss Locke''' and '''Mr. Chambers''', he reemerged as the world's most expensive hitman. For the price of $1 million (actually a token sum, since Arcade doesn't need the money and, in any case, never turns a profit), he will tailor Murderworld to exploit the specific weaknesses of his target and then watch, with unconcealed [[happiness|glee]], as they are killed by the variety of colorful deathtraps strewn throughout the facility.

However, one of his "gimmicks" is that he always deliberately leaves each target a small chance of survival. In one instance, when the girlfriend of one of his captives begged him "If you're going to kill them, at least have the decency to do it quickly, painlessly!" Arcade laughs and replied, "Decency's dull... besides, miss, your way, they're dead and that's that. My way, they've got a chance. Not much of one, but a chance." This sets Arcade notably apart from most other villains who use [[deathtrap (plot device)|deathtrap]]s; while most villains believe that their death machines are infallible, Arcade likes to give them a chance on purpose, for the sport of it.

Since his first attempt to slay the unlikely duo of [[Spider-Man]] and [[Captain Britain]],<ref>''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' (Vol. 1)#65-66</ref> Arcade has tangled, at one time or another, with a large number of heroes and teams of heroes.

In addition to battling the [[X-Men]], [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], [[X-Force]] and [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] as groups, he has attempted to kill many individual members, usually in pairs. Examples of this include [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] and [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]],<ref>''Wolverine/Gambit: Victims'' #1-4</ref> [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] and [[Kitty Pryde|Shadowcat]],<ref>''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #197</ref> [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] and [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]],<ref>''[[Marvel Fanfare]]'' (Vol. 1) #50</ref> [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] and [[Spider-Man]],<ref>''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' (Vol. 1) #89</ref> [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] and [[Meggan (comics)|Meggan]],<ref>''[[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]]''#1</ref> [[Deadpool]] and Hercules, and [[Iron Man]] and [[Thing (comics)|The Thing]].

Other would-be victims of Murderworld have included [[Green Goblin]] ([[Phil Urich]]),<ref>''Green Goblin'' #10</ref> [[Doctor Doom]], [[Northstar]],<ref>''Northstar'' #1-4</ref> [[Courtney Ross]], [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]], and the [[Micronauts (comics)|Micronauts]].<ref>''Micronauts'' (Vol. 1) #45</ref>

Courtney Ross is one of the few non-super-powered civilians to escape Arcade's attention alive. She survives for some time due to outwitting multiple opponents (such as the [[Crazy Gang (comics)|Crazy Gang]]) and discovering a talent for improvisational comedy. In the end, she is rescued by the superhero team Excalibur. The entire situation gives her a new outlook and appreciation for life (which doesn't last long, as she is soon killed by an unrelated villain).<ref>''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' (Vol. 1) 04-05 (1988)</ref>

In another confrontation with Excalibur, Arcade trapped the team in a Murderworld programmed as a Looney Tune parody, called the Loonies. He was revealed to be the "Wizard of Oz" of this world after Excalibur had to go down the yellow brick road.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' (Vol. 1) #31-38</ref>

At one point Arcade entraps the two otherworldly warriors, [[Adam X the X-Treme|Adam X]] and [[Shatterstar]], who team up to survive his plans. Arcade finds himself astonished as the two (mostly Adam) literally kill several of his employees. This causes him to state that the clients will be receiving a refund and the two are not to be dealt with in the future. Shatterstar attempts to kill Arcade, but he only destroys a robotic double.<ref>''[[X-Force]]'' (Vol. 1) #29-30</ref>

The battle with Ghost Rider came when Arcade, having taken his show on the road, joins up with Blaze's Quentin Carnival. This particular Murderworld folded out from the back of a semi. As with many people associated with Blaze, Arcade had become deeply entangled with supernatural horrors at this point. Blaze rampages through the fold-out Murderworld, destroying all the obstacles in his sight. Two allies of Blaze, Kody and [[Princess Python]], arrive to assist but are subdued by knock-out gas. It is discovered that this particular Murderworld is infested with demonic beings. Blaze kills what he can, then leaves Arcade trapped in its depths. Arcade's trailer, now more normal-shaped, is driven out into the desert and abandoned.<ref>''Blaze'' #8</ref>

Prior to a confrontation with [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] and [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]], he murdered his assistant Miss Locke in a fit of rage. During the struggle, she wounded him with a carving knife and scarred much of his face. Over time, Arcade recovered from the physical trauma (presumably through facial surgery, though that has never been confirmed or even addressed in future stories) and even built a series of Miss Locke androids, virtually identical to her in ever way, to replace his now-dead companion.

He is responsible for the destruction of [[District X|Mutant Town]], as part of a botched plan to kidnap X-Factor's [[Rictor]].<ref>''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' (Vol. 2) #29-31</ref> He has since resurfaced, confronting [[Deadpool]] and [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]],<ref>Deadpool Team-Up #899</ref> [[Dazzler]],<ref>X-Necrosha: Dazzler</ref> [[Human Torch]] and the [[Impossible Man]].<ref>Fantastic Four #580</ref> and the [[Young Allies (Marvel Comics)|Young Allies]] and [[Avengers Academy]].<ref>Avengers Academy Giant-Size #1</ref>

As part of the ''[[Marvel NOW!]]'' event, Arcade is the main villain in the pages of ''[[Avengers Arena]]''.<ref name="AvengersArena">{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=40986 |title=Hopeless and Walker Populate "Avengers Arena" For Marvel NOW! |last=Sunu |first=Steve |date=13 September 2012 |publisher=Comic Book Resources |accessdate=13 September 2012}}</ref> Arcade has abducted 16 teenage superheroes (consisting of Cammi, [[Darkhawk]], [[Hazmat (comics)|Hazmat]], [[Mettle (comics)|Mettle]], [[Nico Minoru]], [[Reptil]], [[Juston Seyfert]] and his [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]], [[Chase Stein]], [[X-23]] Apex, Nara, Kid Briton, [[Red Raven]] III, Ryker, Bloodstone, and Anarchronism) in order to force them to fight for his own amusement as his latest version of Murderworld that is somewhere in Antarctica (which he has full control over the environment). When the teenage superheroes tried to fight him, Arcade demonstrated new abilities where one of them sends Hazmat flying. Arcade then states that he will take out the weakest of the teenage superheroes. Hazmat then attacks Arcade again, but Arcade elects her as the weakest and starts to kill her. To save her life, Mettle sacrifices himself as Arcade apparently kills Mettle. Arcade then declares that the games have begun.<ref>''Avengers Arena'' #1</ref> After several days had passed, Arcade seemingly shut off the food supply making survival more difficult.<ref>''Avengers Arena'' #4</ref> Arcade makes the weather conditions hazardous in Murderworld, but notes there are safe zones at the edge of each quadrant for the competitors to rest, as well as food and medicine in Quadrant 2.<ref>''Avengers Arena'' #5</ref> After X-23 goes feral upon the trigger scene causing her to attack Reptil and Hazmat enough for them to get away, Arcade comments on how his new trigger scent was a success and how amazed he was that X-23 would kill anyone with it on them.<ref>''Avengers Arena'' #6</ref> Arcade then begins to reflect on the events that led up to him kidnapping the teenage superheroes. Throwing a party at his estate for his birthday, Arcade realized it was made fun of him by the super-villains community and was wounded by his new assistant Miss Coriander after having asked her to try to kill him. He then give his Murder Island to her and flees to his bar called the Hole in the central parts of [[Bagalia]] where he was burgled by [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]] (who was one of the villains who had made fun of Arcade). Arcade defeated him with a giant hammer-like trap and possibly killing him. Arcade decided to create a new project inspired by children's novels. Helped by Miss Coriander, he created a new Murderworld in Antartica and was provided with powers from cybernetics, magic stuff, [[Stark Industries]] tech, and gamma radiation.<ref name="Avengers Arena #7">''Avengers Arena'' #7</ref> Arcade had replaced the captive teens with [[Life Model Decoy]]s to prevent anyone from becoming suspicious of their disappearance.<ref>''Avengers Arena'' #13</ref> 
Arcade speaks to his robot about the progress in the teenage heroes' fight against each other. Deathlocket and Apex end up going further into Arcade's lair where they are attacked by Arcade. During the fight, Christopher Powell (who is revealed to still be alive) is awakened when Deathlocket releases him. Christopher then attacks Arcade and manages to knock him out.<ref>''Avengers Arena'' #16</ref> Apex, Deathlocket and Christopher corner Arcade who ends up teleporting away. When Apex tries to hack Arcade's computers, Arcade talked Apex into letting the game play out in order to position herself as the sole survivor.<ref>''Avengers Arena'' #17</ref> One week after Murderworld was shut down, Arcade is shown in a bathrobe within one of his safehouses where he has uploaded the footage of the Murderworld fights on [[YouTube]].<ref>''Avengers Arena'' #18</ref>

==Arcade's Other Impacts==
One of his old facilities was used as a headquarters by the superhero team [[X-Force]].<ref>''[[X-Force]]'' (Vol. 1) #40</ref> They planned to base crimefighting and even attendance in a nearby college out of it. Arcade later destroys the base remotely; X-Force barely escapes with their lives.<ref>''X-Men Prime''</ref> Another old Murderworld location was converted into a training room by an incarnation of the New Warriors.<ref>''[[New Warriors]]'' (Vol. 4) #3</ref>

In ''[[Agent X (Marvel Comics)|Agent X]]'' #5, it was revealed that Arcade also has some medical skills which he uses to save Agent X's life.<ref>''[[Agent X (Marvel Comics)|Agent X]]'' #5</ref>

[[Madripoor]] Island-ruler [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]] had bought one of Arcade's Murderworld facilities. She uses it to deceive the X-Men, threatening the city of London with nuclear weapons. Though restricted in the use of their powers, they manage to overcome the challenges and save lives.<ref>''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #448-449</ref>

Since then, Arcade has apparently returned to his criminal status, and had formed Murderland. He captured the [[Fantastic Four]]'s [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] in it, together with some other costumed individuals, including the likes of [[Iron Man]], [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Nighthawk]], and the [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]]. He has the Thing battle robot-versions of all of the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk's]] past forms, such as Mr. Fixit and Maestro.<ref>''[[Thing (comics)|Thing]]'' (Vol. 2) #1-3</ref>

In the three-part miniseries called ''"Claws",'' Arcade secretly creates a [[Kraven the Hunter]] robot, with the "assistance" of [[White Rabbit (comics)|White Rabbit]], in an attempt to kill both Wolverine and [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]]. The two heroes overwhelm Arcade and the White Rabbit and strand them in the dinosaur-filled wilds of the [[Savage Land]].<ref>''Wolverine/Black Cat: Claws'' #1-2</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Arcade has no superhuman powers but is a bona fide genius with knowledge of technology far ahead of conventional science, particularly in the fields of robotics and mechanical and electrical engineering. Usually when he appears to be captured, it turns out to be a robot.

In the "Avengers Arena" series, Arcade easily held back a cadre of 16 high-powered teenage superheroes seemingly without having to resort to mechanical or technological devices of any sort. He displayed the ability to create force fields, proved to be nearly invulnerable to energy blasts without the force field, controlled the motor functions of his 16 captives all at the same time, employed telekinesis, caused nearby matter to form into a throne for him to sit on, and effortlessly blew apart an almost invulnerable mutant with a simple gesture. These abilities though, are the result of technology provided by his henchwoman, Miss Coriander and can only be manifested within the confines of the Antarctica Murderworld.<ref name="Avengers Arena #7"/>

==Associates==
* '''Miss Locke''' - Arcade's bodyguard and chief enforcer, is an expert in martial arts and gun combat. According to a flashback sequence in "Avengers Arena" #7 (2013), he murdered her in cold blood despite her years of faithful service once she, in Arcade's mind, had tried to get "too close" to him by having an emotional and physical relationship.

* '''Mr. Chambers''' - Arcade's henchman who has displayed electronic and mechanical skill and is thus in charge of Murderworld's system operations and maintenance. Chambers has displayed electronic and mechanical skill and is thus in charge of Murderworld.

* '''Miss Coriander''' - Arcade's latest henchman, she claims to be responsible for the vast array of powers that Arcade currently employs in his underground base seen in the "Avengers Arena" storyline. She appears to far surpass even Arcade in terms of knowledge about superhuman powers and how to counter them, and has gifted Arcade with a vastly powerful set of abilities that she has purloined from cutting-edge technology, exotic energy sources, and magical power.

==Other versions==

===Age of Apocalypse===
In the [[Age of Apocalypse]] timeline, Arcade is a member of the [[Marauders (comics)#Age of Apocalypse|Marauders]], a heavily armed group of human traitors who work for [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]], alongside [[Alternative versions of the Green Goblin#Age of Apocalypse|Red]], [[Kingpin (comics)#Age of Apocalypse|Dirigible]], and the [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]]. He is killed by [[Gwen Stacy#Age of Apocalypse|Gwen Stacy]] and [[Hawkeye (comics)|Clint Barton]].<ref>''X-Universe'' #1</ref>

===Age of X===
In the ''[[Age of X (comics)|Age of X]]'' universe, Arcade was the [[Superintendent of Jail|prison governor]] of the mutant prison. He was responsible for making [[Cyclops (comics)|Basilisk]] kill his brother Havok. Basilisk later escaped and killed Arcade.<ref>''Age of X'' one-shot</ref>

===Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe===
It is revealed that Arcade has been captured by Deadpool and forced to build deathtraps used to kill various members of the X-Men. He begs Wolverine to save him, horrified by the things Deadpool wants him to build. Wolverine instead kills Arcade for his involvement.<ref>Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe #3</ref>

===Marvel Adventures===
In this version, Arcade has an actual amusement park in order to entertain the kids; he is skillful in robots and highly arrogant. After [[Mister Fantastic]] ruins his robots, he decides to prove to be superior to Mr. Fantastic and lure him into his Murderworld. There, Mr. Fantastic defeats all the traps and turns all the robots against Arcade. Arcade is taken into custody and Mr. Fantastic learns to be more tactful.<ref>''Marvel Adventures: Fantastic Four'' #19</ref>

Later, Arcade traps high school student [[Flash Thompson]] in a new arcade machine and uses the young video gamer as a tester to destroy New York City. Eventually, Spider-Man breaks up Arcade's scheme and saves his fellow schoolmate.<ref>''Marvel Adventures: Spider-Man'' #49</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, Arcade is portrayed as a taller, fitter [[Video game|gaming]] [[Child prodigy|prodigy]] who invented a literal [[first-person shooter]] (which in this continuity, is called Murderworld). His sister was killed by [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] in the bridge explosion in [[Ultimate War]], giving him a hatred of mutants. He is apparently a skilled hunter and tracker, equipped with various high tech weapons and equipmentWhen the Ultimate Universe version of [[Longshot]] is found guilty of murdering a [[Genosha]]n politician, he is sentenced to participate in a [[reality television|reality TV]] show in which he is [[Survivor (TV series)|stranded on an island]] and [[Human hunting|hunted by opponents]]. As Arcade makes his way through the island jungle, he encounters three [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Men]] trying to save the prisoner. He subdues them and is about to kill [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] when Longshot knocks him unconscious. He is last seen being tied to a tree by [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] with some scraps of iron.<ref>''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'' #55-56</ref>

===What If?===
In a reality where Wolverine was transformed into the Horseman of War by [[Apocalypse]] and then killed his maker and ran rampant on the Marvel Universe, Arcade was one of many X-foes (and even allies) who was slain by the rampaging mutant.<ref>''[[What If (comics)|What If?]]'' (Vol. 1) #111</ref>

==In other media==

===Television===
* The television series ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'' reimagines Arcade (voiced by [[Gabe Khouth]]) as a high school gamer named '''Webber Torque''' (who calls himself Arcade) who is tricked by a disguised [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] into believing that the X-Men's mansion security console and [[Danger Room]] is an elaborate video game. He uses it to attack the X-Men, who he believes to be game characters. Despite nearly killing the X-Men, this version of Arcade is not evil and apologizes for having played the "video game" without permission. Oddly, he does not recognize any of the X-Men to be his schoolmates.

* Fans believe that Arcade is the person responsible for the breakout in [[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]].

* Arcade appears in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' episode "Game Over" voiced by [[Eric Bauza]]. This version is an Asian [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[Technopathy|who can communicate with any type of technology]], while Murderworld is referred to as "Madland". In this version, Arcade is willing to use his abilities to lure superheroes to Madland for his own childish amusement, regardless of possible consequences of his actions. Arcade plans to crack the codes to nuclear missiles where he plans to cause World War III. He started by sending a [[Life Model Decoy]] of [[Nick Fury]] which is defeated by Nick Fury as Arcade speaks through the Life Model Decoy. [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] traces Arcade's transmission to [[Madripoor]] as Spider-Man joins up with Captain America to head to Madripoor. Upon the approach to Madripoor, Arcade takes control of Captain America's plane in order to crash them. Spider-Man and Captain America bail out as they fight off Arcade's drones. Upon meeting up with Wolverine after he had defeated some ninja Life Model Decoys, they help him when Wolverine is also hunting for Arcade. Arcade then unleashes Life Model Decoys of Captain America, Spider-Man, and Wolverine which the real ones defeated. Captain America and Wolverine discover that Arcade had stolen some S.H.I.E.L.D. Life Model Decoys. After the three Life Model Decoys are defeated, Arcade unleashes three Life Model Decoys modeled after Hulk. Captain America and Wolverine defeat the Hulk Life Model Decoys while Spider-Man destroys the lasers. When escaping to the next level upon evading the Life Model Decoys of [[Thunderbolt Ross|Red Hulk]], Arcade unleashes the [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]]s and other robots. Spider-Man reprograms the Sentinel to take out the other robots. Afterwards, Arcade is angered that Spider-Man is in his game which he designed for Captain America and Wolverine. Arcade then unleashes a giant robot that resembles Arcade's head to attack until Spider-Man destroys the laser cannon on its head. Captain America, Spider-Man, and Wolverine then confront Arcade as Wolverine threatens him to cancel the codes. Arcade is then arrested by the S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents.

===Video games===
* Arcade was one of the main villains in the video game ''[[X-Men: Madness in Murderworld]]''.

* Arcade appears as the main villain in the [[1992 in video gaming|1992]] [[video game]] ''[[Spider-Man/X-Men: Arcade's Revenge]]'' for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Nintendo]] and [[Mega Drive|Sega Genesis]] and Sega Game Gear game systems.

* Arcade appears as one of the enemies in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'' voiced by [[Quinton Flynn]]. He is a member of [[Doctor Doom]]'s [[Masters of Evil]]. Here, Arcade and [[Baron Mordo]] divert the heroes from their attempt to attack Dr. Doom's castle to rescue the X-Men [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] and [[Jean Grey]]. Mordo uses his magic to disrupt [[Doctor Strange]]'s Orb of Teleportation and send the heroes to Murderworld instead of Castle Doom. Although the first area is a replica of Castle Doom, players can tell something is wrong by a few minor details (such as the carnival-like music playing, treasure chests with mallets that pop out, skeletons with clown noses, broken pillars revealing striped poles, and portraits of Dr. Doom wearing Arcade-like wigs, even though Arcade appears blond instead of redheaded in his in-game portraits). Besides having the normal Murderworld traps, Arcade also has [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]] and [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] working for him, uses mind control to force Jean Grey to attack the heroes, captures [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] and [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Senator Kelly]], and finally attacks the heroes himself in a giant robot called the Arcade-Bot. After beating Arcade, he tells the player that Dr. Doom has Nightcrawler, and has taken him to [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto's]] Realm. His fate is unknown after that. Arcade was also the villain on [[Deadpool]]'s simulator disc, where he is irritated greatly by Deadpool's refusal to accept that Murderworld isn't a normal theme park (although this ''probably'' is Deadpool's taunting rather than an actual lack of understanding, Deadpool's borderline insanity makes this uncertain), and forcing the mercenary to fight Dark Spider-Man (who Arcade referred to as his creation). He is also the villain in [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther's]] disc, threatening T'Challa to give the secret codes to [[Wakanda (comics)|Wakanda]]'s [[vibranium (comics)|vibranium]] facility (which of course he doesn't tell) and forcing Black Panther to fight Dark [[Captain America]]. [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm's]] disc where she fights [[Hussar (comics)|Hussar]] and the versus [[Mysterio]] simulator take place in Murderworld as does Mr. Fantastic's in his fight against [[Bulldozer (comics)|Bulldozer]]. Arcade has special dialogue with [[Mister Fantastic]] (at the Pinball Machine), and [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] (in via [[Xbox 360]] DLC and Gold Edition), [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]] (at the Disco Drop), [[Luke Cage]] (before the fight), [[Captain America]] (after the fight), and [[Deadpool]] (in his simulation disk).

* A [[Marvel 2099]] version of Arcade appears as one of the villains in the [[Nintendo DS]] version of ''[[Spider-Man: Edge of Time]]'' voiced by [[Jim Cummings]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Posted Oct 3, 2011 7:35&nbsp;pm |url=http://marvel.com/news/story/16765/spider-man_edge_of_time_available_now |title=Spider-Man: Edge of Time Available Now |publisher=Marvel.com |date=October 3, 2011}}</ref> He control a game cyber-arena in the year 2099 to hunt down and destroy heroes in front of a live-audience. He seeks to challenge Spider-Man (who is stranded in the year 2099), but is defeated.

* Arcade appears in the [[Facebook]] game ''[[Marvel: Avengers Alliance]]''. He is featured in the 15th Spec-Ops that is loosely based off ''[[Avengers Arena]]''.
