'''Arcade''' is a [[fictional character]] and [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He first appeared in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'', Volume 1, Issue #65 (January 1978). Due to the unique nature of both his mannerisms and deathtraps, Arcade became one of the most popular villains in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], and went on to do battle with many other superheroes. Although confrontations with him rarely last more than one or two issues (making him more of a "guest villain") he has done battle with more superheroes from more franchises than any other Marvel comics villain{{Fact|date=February 2007}}, although he has never once successfully defeated any of them.

==Fictional character biography==
A combination of [[villain|evil genius]] and [[hitman]], Arcade affects a manner of dress and speech that makes him appear to be a comedic character. This is part of his overall theme, which extends into his preferred method of [[murder]], an underground funhouse of colorful [[deathtrap (plot device)|deathtrap]]s, usually decked out in cheery colors and disguised as an [[amusement park]], which he has dubbed "'''Murderworld'''".

Arcade's [[backstory]], up to and including his real name, remains largely unknown even to this day. This is mainly the result of his knack for escaping once he has been defeated. Given his propensity for deception, this origin story can hardly be taken at face value.

According to the man himself, he was born into an extremely wealthy family and lived for much of his early life in, depending on the telling, a [[ranch]] in [[Texas]] or a [[mansion]] in [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]]. At the age of either eighteen or twenty-one, again depending on the telling, his [[allowance]] was cut off by his father, who declared that he did not deserve it. In retaliation, Arcade murders his father, thus inheriting all of the man's vast [[estate (law)|estate]].

Now independently wealthy and free to do as he pleased, Arcade became a freelance [[assassination|assassin]], traveling across the world, killing people in rather mundane fashions, and amassing even more wealth than he already had. He quickly grew bored with doing business as an ordinary hired killer and resolved to find a way to continue his work in a manner more suited to his sensibilities.

Discovering an aptitude for technology, Arcade designed and built his first Murderworld, a subterranean [[Evil Lair|evil lair]] disguised as a very deadly amusement park. From this base, and with the help of two mysterious assistants named '''Miss Locke''' and '''Mr. Chambers''', he reemerged as the world's most expensive hitman. For the price of $1 million (actually a [[token sum]], since Arcade doesn't need the money and, in any case, never turns a profit), he will tailor Murderworld to exploit the specific weaknesses of his target and then watch, with unconcealed [[glee]], as they are killed by the variety of colorful deathtraps strewn throughout the facility.

However, one of his "gimmicks" is that he always deliberately leaves each target a small chance of survival. In one instance, when the girlfriend of one of his captives begged him "If you're going to kill them, at least have the decency to do it quickly, painlessly!" Arcade laughs and replied, "Decency's dull... besides, miss, your way, they're dead and that's that. My way, they've got a chance. Not much of one, but a chance." This sets Arcade notably apart from most other villains who use [[deathtrap (plot device)|deathtrap]]s, because while most villains believe that their death machines are infallible Arcade likes to give them a chance on purpose, for the sport of it.

===Victims===

Since his first attempt to slay the unlikely duo of [[Spider-Man]] and [[Captain Britain]], Arcade has tangled, at one time or another, with a large number of heroes and teams of heroes. In addition to battling the [[X-Men]], [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], [[Alpha Flight]], and [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] as groups, he has attempted to kill many individual members, usually in pairs. Examples of this include [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] and [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] and [[Shadowcat]], and [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] and [[Angel (comics)|Angel]]. Other would-be victims of Murderworld have included [[Longshot]], [[Green Goblin]] (Phil Urich), [[Doctor Doom]], [[Courtney Ross]], [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]] and the [[Micronauts]]. 

Courtney Ross is one of the few non-super-powered civillains to escape Arcade's attentions alive. She survives for some time due to outwitting multiple opponents (such as the [[Crazy Gang (comics)|Crazy Gang]]) and discovering a talent for improvisational comedy. In the end she is rescued by the superhero team Excalibur. The entire situation gives her a new outlook and appreciation for life (which doesn't last long, as she is soon killed by an unrelated villain).

At one point Arcade entraps the two otherworldly warriors, [[Adam X the X-Treme|Adam X]] and [[Shatterstar (comics)|Shatterstar]], who team up to survive his plans. Arcade finds himself astonished as the two (mostly Adam) literally kill several of his employees. This causes him to state that the clients will be receiving a refund, the two are not to be dealt with in the future. Shatterstar attempts to kill Arcade, but he only destroys a robotic double.

The battle with Ghost Rider came when Arcade, having taken his show on the road, joins up with Blaze's Quentin Carnival. This particular Murderworld folded out from the back of a semi. As with many people associated with Blaze, Arcade had become deeply entangled with supernatural horrors at this point. Blaze rampages through the fold-out Murderworld, destroying all the obstacles in his sight. Two allies of Blaze, Kody and [[Princess Python]], arrive to assist but are subdued by knock-out gas. 

It is discovered that this particular Murderworld is infested with demonic beings. Blaze kills what he can, then leaves Arcade trapped in its depths. Arcade's trailer, now more normal-shaped, is driven out into the desert and abandoned.

===Other Effects===

One of his old facillities was used as a headquarters by the superhero team [[X-Force]]. They planned to base crimefighting and even attendance in a nearby college out of it. Arcade later destroys the base in ''X-Men Prime''. X-Force barely escapes with their lives. 

In ''[[Agent X]]'' #5, it was revealed that Arcade also has some medicinal skills which he uses to save Agent X's life.

[[Madripoor]] Island-ruler [[Viper (comics)|Viper]] had bought one of Arcade's Murderworld facilities. She uses it to deceive the X-Men, threatening the city of London with nuclear weapons. Though restricted in the use of their powers, they manage to overcome the challenges and save lives.

Since then, Arcade has apparently returned to his criminal status, together with Ms. Locke, and had formed Murderland. He captured the [[Fantastic Four]]'s [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] in it, together with some other costumed individuals, including the likes of [[Iron Man]], [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Nighthawk]] and [[Constrictor (comics)|the Constrictor]]. He has the Thing battle robot-versions of all of the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk's]] past forms, such as Mr. Fixit and Maestro.

In the three-part miniseries called ''"Claws",'' Arcade secretly creates a [[Kraven the Hunter]] robot, with the "assistance" of [[White Rabbit (comics)|White Rabbit]], in an attempt to kill both Wolverine and the [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]]. The two heroes overwhelm Arcade and the White Rabbit and strand them in the dinosaur-filled wilds of the [[Savage Land]].

===New Warriors===

Arcade has not been seen since then, but #3 of ''[[New Warriors]]'' (Vol. 4) reveals  that one of his old Murderworlds has been converted into a training room by the team's newest incarnation.

==Powers and abilities==
Arcade has no superhuman powers but is a bona fide genius with knowledge of technology far ahead of conventional science, particularly in the fields of robotics and mechanical and electrical engineering. Usually, when he appears to be captured it turns out to be a robot.

==Other versions==

=== Age of Apocalypse ===

In the [[Age of Apocalypse]] timeline, Arcade is a member of the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]], a heavily armed group of human traitors who work for [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]], alongside [[Green Goblin|Red]], [[Kingpin (comics)|Drigible]] and the [[Owl (comics)|Owl]]. This incarnation of Arcade is killed by [[Gwen Stacy]] and [[Hawkeye (comics)|Clint Barton]].

===Marvel Adventures Fantastic Four===
In this version, Arcade has an actual amusement park in order to entertain the kids, he is skillful in robots and highly arrogant. After Mr. Fantastic ruins his robots, he decides to prove to be superior to Mr. Fantastic and lure him into his Murderworld. There Mr. Fantastic defeats all the traps and turns all the robots against Arcade. Arcade is taken into custody and Mr. Fantastic learns to be more tactful.

===Ultimate Arcade===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Universe]], Arcade is portrayed as a taller, fitter [[Video game|gaming]] [[Child prodigy|prodigy]] who invented a literal [[first-person shooter]] (which in this continuity, is called Murderworld). His sister was killed by Magneto in the bridge explosion in [[Ultimate War]], giving him a hatred of mutants.  When the Ultimate Universe version of [[Longshot (comics)|Longshot]] is found guilty of murdering a [[Genosha]]n politician, he is sentenced to participate in a [[reality television|reality TV]] show in which he is [[Survivor (TV series)|stranded on an island]] and hunted by opponents. As Arcade makes his way through the island jungle, he encounters three [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Men]] trying to save the prisoner. He subdues them and is about to kill [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Ultimate Nightcrawler]] when Longshot knocks him unconscious.  He is last seen being tied to a tree by Colossus with some scraps of iron.

Ultimate Arcade is equipped with various high tech weapons and equipment, given his financial status, and is apparently a skilled hunter and tracker. During his fight on [[Krakoa]], he is seen to employ an automatic rifle, handgun, sonic emitter, and web fluid ("one of my programmers reverse engineered this thing from some polymer he scraped off a wall in Manhattan").

==In other media==
===Television===
The television series ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'' re-imagines Arcade (voiced by [[Gabe Khouth]]) as a high-school gamer named Webber Torque (who calls himself Arcade), who is tricked by a disguised Mystique into believing that the X-Men's mansion security console and [[Danger Room]] is an elaborate video game. He uses it to attack the X-Men, who he believes to be game characters. Despite nearly killing the X-Men, this version of Arcade is not evil, and apologizes for having played the "video game" without permission. Oddly, he does not recognize any of them to be the X-Men, or as his friends.

===Video games===

* Arcade was one of the main villains in the video game ''[[X-Men: Madness in Murderworld]]''.

*Arcade appears as the main villain in the [[video game]] ''Spider-Man & X-Men: Arcade's Revenge'' (1992) for the [[Super Nintendo]] and [[Sega Genesis]] game systems. 

* Arcade appears as one of the enemies in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'' voiced by [[Quinton Flynn]]. He is a member of [[Doctor Doom|Dr. Doom]]'s [[Masters of Evil]]. Here, Arcade and [[Baron Mordo]] divert the heroes from their attempt to attack Dr. Doom's castle to rescue the X-Men [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] and [[Jean Grey]]. Mordo uses his magic to disrupt [[Doctor Strange]]'s Orb of Teleportation and send the heroes to Murderworld instead of Castle Doom. Although the first area is a replica of Castle Doom, players can tell something is wrong by a few minor details (such as the carnival-like music playing, treasure chests with mallets that pop out, skeletons with clown noses, and portraits of Dr. Doom wearing Arcade-like wigs). Besides having the normal Murderworld traps, Arcade also has [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]] and [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] working for him, uses mind control to force Jean Grey to attack the heroes, captures [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] and [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Senator Kelly]], and finally attacks the heroes himself in a giant robot called the Arcade-Bot. After beating Arcade, he tells the player that Dr. Doom has Nightcrawler, and has taken him to [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto's]] Realm. Arcade is presumably arrested by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], killed by his exploding Arcade-Bot or escapes after. Arcade was also the villain on [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool's]] simulator disc, where he is irritated greatly by Deadpool's refusal to accept that Muderworld isn't a normal theme park (Although this ''probably'' is Deadpool's taunting rather than an actual lack of understanding, Deadpool's borderline insanity makes this uncertain), forcing the mercenary to fight Dark Spider-Man (who Arcade referred to as his creation). He is also the villain in [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther's]] disc, threatening T'Challa to give the secret codes to Wakanda's vibrainium facility (which of course doesn't tell), forcing players to fight Dark [[Captain America]]. [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm's]] disc where she fights [[Hussar (comics)|Hussar]] and the versus [[Mysterio]] simulator take place in Murderworld, as does Mr. Fantastic's in his fight against [[Bulldozer (comics)|Bulldozer]].
