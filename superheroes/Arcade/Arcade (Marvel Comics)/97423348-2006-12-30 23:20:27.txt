'''Arcade''' is a [[fictional character]] and [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He first appeared in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'', Volume 1, Issue #65 (January 1978). Due to the unique nature of both his mannerisms and deathtraps, Arcade became one of the most popular villains in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], and went on to do battle with many other superheroes. Although confrontations with him rarely last more than one or two issues (making him more of a "guest villain") he has done battle with more superheroes from more franchises than any other [[comic book]] villain{{fact}}, although he has never once successfully defeated anyone.

==Fictional character biography==
A combination of [[evil genius]] and [[hitman]], Arcade affects a manner of dress and speech that makes him appear to be a comedic character. This is part of his overall theme, which extends into his preferred method of [[murder]], an underground funhouse of colorful [[deathtrap (plot device)|deathtrap]]s, usually decked out in cheery colors and disguised as an [[amusement park]], which he has dubbed "'''Murderworld'''".

Arcade's [[backstory]], up to and including his real name, remains largely unknown even to this day. This is mainly the result of his uncanny knack for escaping once he has been defeated. Because of this dubious talent, Arcade has never once been captured and, consequently, all information about his life prior to his first appearance is what he has decided to disseminate. Given his propensity for deception, this origin story can hardly be taken at face value.

According to the man himself, he was born into an extremely wealthy family and lived for much of his early life in, depending on the telling, a [[ranch]] in [[Texas]] or a [[mansion]] in [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]]. At the age of either eighteen or twenty-one, again depending on the telling, his [[allowance]] was cut off by his father, who declared that he did not deserve it. In retaliation, Arcade murdered his father, thus inheriting all of the man's vast [[estate (law)|estate]].

Now independently wealthy and free to do as he pleased, Arcade became a freelance [[assassination|assassin]], traveling across the world, killing people in rather mundane fashions, and amassing even more wealth than he already had. But he quickly grew bored with doing business as an ordinary hired killer and resolved to find a way to continue his work in a manner more suited to his sensibilities.

Discovering an aptitude for technology, Arcade designed and built Murderworld, a subterranean [[Evil Lair|evil lair]] disguised as a very deadly amusement park. From this base, and with the help of two mysterious assistants named '''Miss Locke''' and '''Mr. Chambers''', he reemerged as the world's most expensive hitman. For the price of $1 million (actually a [[token sum]], since Arcade doesn't need the money and, in any case, never turns a profit), he will tailor Murderworld to exploit the specific weaknesses of his target and then watch, with unconcealed [[glee]], as they are killed by the variety of colorful [[trap]]s strewn throughout the facility.

However, one of his "gimmicks" is that he always deliberately leaves each target a small chance of survival. One time, when the girlfriend of one of his captives begged him "If you're going to kill them, at least have the decency to do it quickly, painlessly!" Arcade laughed and replied, "Decency's dull... besides, miss, your way, they're dead and that's that. My way, they've got a chance. Not much of one, but a chance." This sets Arcade notably apart from most other villains who use [[deathtrap (plot device)|deathtrap]]s, because while most villains believe that their death machines are infallible (an overconfidence that usually betrays them), Arcade likes to give them a chance on purpose, for the sport of it. This is one similarity with [[Batman]]'s nemesis, [[Joker (comics)|The Joker]], another villain who uses [[deathtrap (plot device)|deathtrap]]s just for the challenge.

Since his first attempt to slay the unlikely duo of [[Spider-Man]] and [[Captain Britain]], Arcade has tangled, at one time or another, with a large number of heroes and teams of heroes. In addition to battling the [[X-Men]], [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], [[Alpha Flight]], and [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] as groups, he has attempted to kill many individual members, usually in pairs. Examples of this include [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] and [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] and [[Shadowcat]], and [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] and [[Angel (comics)|Angel]]. Other would-be victims of Murderworld have included [[Longshot]], [[Green Goblin]] (Phil Urich), [[Doctor Doom]], [[Ghost Rider]], and the [[Micronauts]].

In ''Agent X'' #5, it was revealed that Arcade also has some medicinal skills which he used to save Agent X's life.

In recent comics, it was revealed that Madripoor Island-ruler Viper had bought one of Arcade's Murderworld facilities, and caught the Queen of England and Storm's X.S.E.-team in it, though they eventually managed to escape from it even without their powers. Since then, Arcade has apparently returned to his criminal status, together with Ms. Locke, and had formed Murderland. He captured the Fantastic Four's Thing in it, together with some other costumed individuals, in the likes of Iron Man, Nighthawk and the Constrictor. He had the Thing battle robot-versions of all of the Hulk's past forms, such as Mr. Fixit and Maestro.

In the three-part miniseries called ''"Claws",'' Arcade secretly creates a [[Kraven the Hunter]] robot, with the "assistance" of [[White Rabbit (comics)|White Rabbit]], in an attempt to kill both Wolverine and the Black Cat on an island, but this backfires and the two end up in the savage land.

==Powers and abilities==
Arcade has no superhuman powers but is a bona fide genius with knowledge of technology far ahead of conventional science, particularly in the fields of robotics and mechanical and electrical engineering. Usually, when he appears to be captured it turns out to be a robot.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Arcade===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Universe]], Arcade is portrayed as a [[computer and video games|gaming]] [[Child prodigy|prodigy]] who invented a literal [[first-person shooter]] (which in this continuity, is called Murderworld). His sister was killed by Magneto in the bridge explosion in [[Ultimate War]], giving him a hatred of mutants.  When the Ultimate Universe version of Longshot is found guilty of murdering a [[Genosha]]n politician, he is sentenced to participate in a [[reality television|reality TV]] show in which he is [[Survivor (TV series)|stranded on an island]] and hunted by Arcade. As Arcade makes his way through the island jungle, he encounters three X-Men trying to save the prisoner. He dispatches them easily, though, and is about to kill [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Ultimate Nightcrawler]] when Longshot knocks him unconscious.  He is last seen being tied to a tree by Colossus with some scraps of iron.

Arcade is equipped with various high tech equipment, given his financial status. During his fight on Krakoa, he is seen to employ an automatic rifle, handgun, sonic emitter, and web fluid ("one of my programmers reverse engineered this thing from some polymer he scraped off a wall in Manhattan").

==Appearances in other media==
===Television===
The television series ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'' re-imagines Arcade as a high-school gamer named Webber Torque (who calls himself Arcade), who is tricked by a disguised Mystique into believing that the X-Men's mansion security console and [[Danger Room]] is an elaborate video game. He uses it to attack the X-Men, who he believes to be game characters. Despite nearly killing the X-Men, this version of Arcade is not evil, and apologizes for having played the "video game" without permission. Oddly, he does not recognize any of them to be the X-Men, or as his friends.

===Video games===

* Arcade was one of the main villains in the video game  X-Men: Madness in Murderworld

*Arcade appears as the main villain in the [[video game]] ''Spider-Man & X-Men: Arcade's Revenge'' (1992) for the [[Super Nintendo]] game system. 

*He also appears as one of the enemies in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]''. Here, Arcade and [[Baron Mordo]] divert the heroes from their attempt to attack [[Dr. Doom]]'s castle to rescue the X-Men [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] and [[Jean Grey]]. Mordo uses his magic to disrupt [[Dr. Strange]]'s Orb of Teleportation and send the heroes to Murderworld instead of Castle Doom. Although the first area is a replica of Castle Doom, players can tell something is wrong by the slight carnival-like music. Besides having the normal Murderworld traps, Arcade also has [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]] and [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] working for him, uses mind control to force Jean Grey to attack the heroes, captures [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] and [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Senator Kelly]], and finally attacks the heroes himself in a giant robot. After beating Arcade, he tells you that Dr. Doom has Nightcrawler, and has taken him to [[Mephisto]]'s Realm. Arcade is presumably arrested by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] after.
