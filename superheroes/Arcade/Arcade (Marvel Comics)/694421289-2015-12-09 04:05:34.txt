'''Arcade''' is a [[fiction]]al [[character (arts)|character]], a [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He first appeared in 1978's ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' (vol. 1) #65.

==Publication history==
{{expand section|date=June 2014}}

[[File:Marvel Team-Up 66.jpg|thumb|Arcade's first full appearance in [[Marvel Team-Up]] #66.]]
Arcade was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]. Arcade first appeared in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'', vol. 1, issue #65 (the same storyline was reprinted shortly thereafter in the black-and-white comic [[Marvel UK]] title ''[[Super Spider-Man & Captain Britain]]'' #248).<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #65 bears a cover date of January 1978. During this period, comic books published by Marvel Comics U.S.A. carried a [[cover date]] three months ''in advance'' of the actual date of publication. This means the actual publication date of ''Marvel Team-Up'' #65 was October 1977. The first issue of ''Super Spider-Man and Captain Britain'' to feature the Arcade storyline was published in England on November 8, 1977.</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
A combination of [[villain#The evil genius villain|evil genius]] and [[hitman]], Arcade affects a manner of dress and speech that makes him appear to be a comedic character. This is part of his overall theme, which extends into his preferred method of [[murder]], an underground funhouse of colorful [[deathtrap (plot device)|deathtrap]]s, usually decked out in cheery colors and disguised as an [[amusement park]], which he has dubbed "'''[[Murderworld (comics)|Murderworld]]'''."

Arcade's [[back-story]], up to and including his real name, remains largely unknown even to this day. According to the man himself, he was born into an extremely wealthy family and lived for much of his early life in, depending on the telling, a [[ranch]] in [[Texas]], or a [[mansion]] in [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]].<ref>''All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update'' #1</ref> At the age of either eighteen or twenty-one, his [[allowance (money)|allowance]] was cut off by his father, who declared that he did not deserve it. In retaliation, Arcade murders his father, thus inheriting all of the man's vast [[estate (law)|estate]]. Given his propensity for deception, this origin story can hardly be taken at face value.

Arcade became a freelance [[assassination|assassin]], traveling across the world, killing people in rather mundane fashions, and amassing even more wealth than he already had. Discovering an aptitude for technology, Arcade designed and built his first Murderworld, a subterranean evil lair disguised as a very deadly amusement park. From this base, and with the help of two mysterious assistants named '''Miss Locke''' and '''Mr. Chambers''', he reemerged as the world's most expensive hitman. For the price of $1 million, he would tailor Murderworld to exploit the specific weaknesses of his target and then watch as they are killed by the variety of colorful deathtraps strewn throughout the facility.

However, one of his "gimmicks" is that he always deliberately leaves each target a small chance of survival. In one instance, when the girlfriend of one of his captives begged him "If you're going to kill them, at least have the decency to do it quickly, painlessly!" Arcade laughs and replied, "Decency's dull... besides, miss, your way, they're dead and that's that. My way, they've got a chance. Not much of one, but a chance." This sets Arcade notably apart from most other villains who use [[deathtrap (plot device)|deathtrap]]s; while most villains believe that their death machines are infallible, Arcade likes to give them a chance on purpose, for the sport of it.

[[Image:Arcade.PNG|250px|thumb|left|Arcade, from ''[[X-Men (comics)|X-Men]]'' #122 (June 1979).<br />Art by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] and [[Terry Austin (comics)|Terry Austin]].]]
Since his first attempt to slay the unlikely duo of [[Spider-Man]] and [[Captain Britain]],<ref>''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' (Vol. 1) #65-66</ref> Arcade has tangled, at one time or another, with a large number of heroes and teams of heroes.

In addition to battling the [[X-Men]], [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], [[X-Force]] and [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] as groups, he has attempted to kill many individual members, usually in pairs. Examples of this include [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]],<ref>''Wolverine/Gambit: Victims'' #1-4</ref> [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] and [[Kitty Pryde|Shadowcat]],<ref>''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #197</ref> [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] and [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]],<ref>''[[Marvel Fanfare]]'' (Vol. 1) #50</ref> [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] and [[Spider-Man]],<ref>''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' (Vol. 1) #89</ref> [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] and [[Meggan (comics)|Meggan]],<ref>''[[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]]''#1</ref> [[Deadpool]] and Hercules, and [[Iron Man]] and [[Thing (comics)|The Thing]].

Other would-be victims of Murderworld have included [[Green Goblin]] ([[Phil Urich]]),<ref>''Green Goblin'' #10</ref> [[Doctor Doom]], [[Northstar]],<ref>''Northstar'' #1-4</ref> [[Courtney Ross]], [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]], and the [[Micronauts (comics)|Micronauts]].<ref>''Micronauts'' (Vol. 1) #45</ref>

Courtney Ross is one of the few non-super-powered civilians to escape Arcade's attention alive. She survives for some time due to outwitting multiple opponents (such as the [[Crazy Gang (comics)|Crazy Gang]]) and discovering a talent for improvisational comedy. In the end, she is rescued by the superhero team Excalibur. The entire situation gives her a new outlook and appreciation for life (which doesn't last long, as she is soon killed by an unrelated villain).<ref>''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' (Vol. 1) 04-05 (1988)</ref>

In another confrontation with Excalibur, Arcade trapped the team in a Murderworld programmed as a Looney Tunes parody, called the Loonies. He was revealed to be the "Wizard of Oz" of this world after Excalibur had to go down the yellow brick road.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' (Vol. 1) #31-38</ref>

At one point Arcade entraps the two otherworldly warriors, [[Adam X the X-Treme|Adam X]] and [[Shatterstar]], who team up to survive his plans. Arcade finds himself astonished as the two (mostly Adam) literally kill several of his employees. This causes him to state that the clients will be receiving a refund and the two are not to be dealt with in the future. Shatterstar attempts to kill Arcade, but he only destroys a robotic double.<ref>''[[X-Force]]'' (Vol. 1) #29-30</ref>

The battle with Ghost Rider came when Arcade, having taken his show on the road, joins up with Blaze's Quentin Carnival; his Murderworld folded out from the back of a semi. Blaze rampages through the fold-out Murderworld, which he discovers is infested with demonic beings, destroying all the obstacles in his sight and killing what he can. He then leaves Arcade trapped in its depths. Arcade's trailer, now more normal-shaped, is driven out into the desert and abandoned.<ref>''Blaze'' #8</ref>

Prior to a confrontation with [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]], he murdered his assistant Miss Locke in a fit of rage. During the struggle, she wounded him with a carving knife and scarred much of his face. Over time, Arcade recovered from the physical trauma (presumably through facial surgery, though that has never been confirmed or even addressed in future stories) and even built a series of Miss Locke androids, virtually identical to her in ever way, to replace his now-dead companion.

He is responsible for the destruction of [[District X|Mutant Town]], as part of a botched plan to kidnap X-Factor's [[Rictor]].<ref>''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' (Vol. 2) #29-31</ref> He later surfaced, confronting [[Deadpool]] and [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]],<ref>Deadpool Team-Up #899</ref> [[Dazzler]],<ref>X-Necrosha: Dazzler</ref> [[Human Torch]] and the [[Impossible Man]].<ref>Fantastic Four #580</ref> and the [[Young Allies (Marvel Comics)|Young Allies]] and [[Avengers Academy]].<ref>Avengers Academy Giant-Size #1</ref>

In a shift from his usual modus operandi, Arcade is responsible for the "[[Avengers Arena]]." He and a new associate named '''Miss Coriander''' abduct 16 teenage superheroes (several with ties to the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], including several members of [[Avengers Academy]]) and strands them on a deserted island, re-modified as an elaborate Murderworld location, forcing them to fight to the death.<ref name="AvengersArena">{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=40986 |title=Hopeless and Walker Populate "Avengers Arena" For Marvel NOW! |last=Sunu |first=Steve |date=13 September 2012 |publisher=Comic Book Resources |accessdate=13 September 2012}}</ref><ref>Avengers Arena #1-18</ref>

Months later, in the pages of ''[[Avengers Undercover]]'', several survivors gather in Bagalia and are convinced by fellow hero [[Cullen Bloodstone]] to kill Arcade at the Massacrer Casino in revenge for his actions.<ref>''Avengers Undercover'' #2</ref> After a chaotic battle, Hazmat finally kills Arcade by blowing him to bits with a concentrated radiation burst (as a way to avenge her boyfriend Mettle and those who died in his "Avengers Arena" Murderworld.<ref>''Avengers Undercover'' #3</ref> However, it was revealed later that Arcade  was actually alive the entire time, imprisoned in a Masters of Evil cell (with assistance from his now former comrade Ms. Coriander) and that Hazmat had in reality killed a clone made by members of the Masters of Evil.<ref>''Avengers Undercover'' #7</ref>

==Arcade's other impacts==
One of his old facilities was used as a headquarters by the superhero team [[X-Force]].<ref>''[[X-Force]]'' (Vol. 1) #40</ref> They planned to base crimefighting and even attendance in a nearby college out of it. Arcade later destroys the base remotely; X-Force barely escapes with their lives.<ref>''X-Men Prime''</ref> Another old Murderworld location was converted into a training room by an incarnation of the New Warriors.<ref>''[[New Warriors]]'' (Vol. 4) #3</ref>

In ''[[Agent X (Marvel Comics)|Agent X]]'' #5, it was revealed that Arcade also has some medical skills which he uses to save Agent X's life.<ref>''[[Agent X (Marvel Comics)|Agent X]]'' #5</ref>

[[Madripoor]] Island-ruler [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]] had bought one of Arcade's Murderworld facilities. She uses it to deceive the X-Men, threatening the city of London with nuclear weapons. Though restricted in the use of their powers, they manage to overcome the challenges and save lives.<ref>''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #448-449</ref>

In the three-part miniseries called ''"Claws",'' Arcade secretly creates a [[Kraven the Hunter]] robot, with the "assistance" of [[White Rabbit (comics)|White Rabbit]], in an attempt to kill both Wolverine and [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]]. The two heroes overwhelm Arcade and the White Rabbit and strand them in the dinosaur-filled wilds of the [[Savage Land]].<ref>''Wolverine/Black Cat: Claws'' #1-2</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Arcade has no superhuman powers but is a bona fide genius with knowledge of technology far ahead of conventional science, particularly in the fields of robotics and mechanical and electrical engineering. Usually when he appears to be captured, it turns out to be a robot.

In the "Avengers Arena" series, Arcade easily held back a cadre of 16 high-powered teenage superheroes seemingly without having to resort to mechanical or technological devices of any sort. He displayed the ability to create force fields, proved to be nearly invulnerable to energy blasts without the force field, controlled the motor functions of his 16 captives all at the same time, employed telekinesis, caused nearby matter to form into a throne for him to sit on, and effortlessly blew apart an almost invulnerable mutant with a simple gesture. These abilities though, are the result of technology provided by his henchwoman, Miss Coriander and can only be manifested within the confines of the Antarctica Murderworld.

==Associates==
* '''Miss Locke''' - Arcade's bodyguard and chief enforcer, is an expert in martial arts and gun combat. According to a flashback sequence in "Avengers Arena" #7 (2013), he murdered her in cold blood despite her years of faithful service once she, in Arcade's mind, had tried to get "too close" to him by having an emotional and physical relationship.
* '''Mr. Chambers''' - Arcade's henchman who has displayed electronic and mechanical skill and is thus in charge of Murderworld's system operations and maintenance. In several appearances he is the driver of a vehicle (disguised as a garbage truck) that would often capture Arcade's victims for transport back to Murderworld.
* '''Miss Coriander''' - Arcade's latest henchman, she claims to be responsible for the vast array of powers that Arcade currently employs in his underground base seen in the "Avengers Arena" storyline. She appears to far surpass even Arcade in terms of knowledge about superhuman powers and how to counter them, and has gifted Arcade with a vastly powerful set of abilities that she has purloined from cutting-edge technology, exotic energy sources, and magical power. She later betrays Arcade after his supposed death and is currently in league with [[Baron Zemo|Baron Zemo's]] Masters of Evil.

==Other versions==

===Age of Apocalypse===
In the [[Age of Apocalypse]] timeline, Arcade is a member of the [[Marauders (comics)#Age of Apocalypse|Marauders]], a heavily armed group of human traitors who work for [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]], alongside [[Alternative versions of the Green Goblin#Age of Apocalypse|Red]], [[Kingpin (comics)#Age of Apocalypse|Dirigible]], and the [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]]. He is killed by [[Gwen Stacy#Age of Apocalypse|Gwen Stacy]] and [[Hawkeye (comics)|Clint Barton]].<ref>''X-Universe'' #1</ref>

===Age of X===
In the ''[[Age of X (comics)|Age of X]]'' universe, Arcade was the [[Superintendent of Jail|prison governor]] of the mutant prison. He was responsible for making [[Cyclops (comics)|Basilisk]] kill his brother Havok. Basilisk later escaped and killed Arcade.<ref>''Age of X'' one-shot</ref>

===Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe===
It is revealed that Arcade has been captured by Deadpool and forced to build deathtraps used to kill various members of the X-Men. He begs Wolverine to save him, horrified by the things Deadpool wants him to build. Wolverine instead kills Arcade for his involvement.<ref>Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe #3</ref>

===Marvel Adventures===
In this version, Arcade has an actual amusement park in order to entertain the kids; he is skillful in robots and highly arrogant. After [[Mister Fantastic]] ruins his robots, he decides to prove to be superior to Mr. Fantastic and lure him into his Murderworld. There, Mr. Fantastic defeats all the traps and turns all the robots against Arcade. Arcade is taken into custody and Mr. Fantastic learns to be more tactful.<ref>''Marvel Adventures: Fantastic Four'' #19</ref>

Later, Arcade traps high school student [[Flash Thompson]] in a new arcade machine and uses the young video gamer as a tester to destroy New York City. Eventually, Spider-Man breaks up Arcade's scheme and saves his fellow schoolmate.<ref>''Marvel Adventures: Spider-Man'' #49</ref>

===Secret Wars (2015)===
In the Marvel Universe recreated by Doctor Doom, Arcade is the master of ceremonies at the Killiseum, an arena on the outskirts of Doomstadt built to entertain the masses of Battleworld. Here he encountered such heroes as Captain America and the Hulk<ref>Planet Hulk #1</ref> and Thunderbolt Ross the War Machine.<ref>Battleworld #2</ref> He also oversees the Ghost Racers event, which pit the various individuals possessed by the Spirit of Vengeance (including Carter Slade, Johnny Blaze, Danny Ketch, Alejandra Blaze, and Robbie Reyes) against one another in violent races around a booby-trapped track. Thanks to the determined leadership of the unbeaten Reyes, the Ghost Racers would eventually break free of their captivity and kill Arcade.<ref>Ghost Racers #1-4</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, Arcade is portrayed as a taller, fitter [[Video game|gaming]] [[Child prodigy|prodigy]] who invented a literal [[first-person shooter]] (which is called Murderworld). His sister was killed by [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] in the bridge explosion in [[Ultimate War]], giving him a hatred of mutants. He is apparently a skilled hunter and tracker, equipped with various high tech weapons and equipment. When the Ultimate Universe version of [[Longshot]] is found guilty of murdering a [[Genosha]]n politician, he is sentenced to participate in a [[reality television|reality TV]] show in which he is [[Survivor (TV series)|stranded on an island]] and [[Human hunting|hunted by opponents]]. As Arcade makes his way through the island jungle, he encounters three [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Men]] trying to save the prisoner. He subdues them and is about to kill [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] when Longshot knocks him unconscious. He is last seen being tied to a tree by [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] with some scraps of iron.<ref>''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'' #55-56</ref>

===What If?===
In a reality where Wolverine was transformed into the Horseman of War by [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] and then killed his maker and ran rampant on the Marvel Universe, Arcade was one of many X-foes who were slain by the rampaging mutant.<ref>''[[What If (comics)|What If?]]'' (Vol. 1) #111</ref>

==In other media==

===Television===
* Arcade appeared in ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'', voiced by [[Gabe Khouth]]. This television  reimagines Arcade as high school gamer '''Webber Torque''' (who calls himself Arcade) and is tricked by a disguised [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] into believing that the X-Men's mansion security console and [[Danger Room]] is an elaborate video game. He uses it to attack the X-Men which he believes to be game characters. Despite nearly killing the X-Men, this version of Arcade is not evil and apologizes for having played the "video game" without permission. Oddly, he does not recognize any of the X-Men to be his schoolmates.
* Arcade appears in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' cartoon series, voiced by [[Eric Bauza]]. This version is an Asian [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[Technopathy|who can communicate with any type of technology]], while Murderworld is referred to as "Madland". In this version, Arcade is willing to use his abilities to lure superheroes to Madland for his own childish amusement, regardless of possible consequences of his actions. In the episode "Game Over", he plans to crack the codes to nuclear missiles where he plans to cause World War III. He started by sending a [[Life Model Decoy]] of [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]] which is defeated by [[Captain America]] as Arcade speaks through the Life Model Decoy. [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] traces Arcade's transmission to [[Madripoor]] as Spider-Man joins up with Captain America to head to Madripoor. Upon the approach to Madripoor, Arcade takes control of Captain America's plane in order to crash it. Spider-Man and Captain America bail out to fight off Arcade's drones. Upon meeting up with [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] after some ninja Life Model Decoys are defeated. Arcade then unleashes Life Model Decoys of Spider-Man, Captain America and Wolverine. After the three Life Model Decoys are defeated, Arcade unleashes three Life Model Decoys modeled after the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]. Captain America and Wolverine defeat the Life Model Decoys of Hulk while Spider-Man destroys an array of lasers. When escaping to the next level upon evading the Life Model Decoys of [[Thunderbolt Ross|Red Hulk]], Arcade unleashes a [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] and other robots. Spider-Man reprograms the Sentinel to take out the other robots. Afterwards, Arcade is angered that Spider-Man is in his game which he designed for Captain America and Wolverine. Arcade then unleashes a giant robot that resembles Arcade's head to attack until Spider-Man destroys the laser cannon on its head. Spider-Man, Captain America and Wolverine then confront Arcade as Wolverine threatens him to cancel the codes. Arcade is then arrested by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.

===Video games===
* Arcade was one of the main villains in the video game ''[[X-Men: Madness in Murderworld]]''.
* Arcade appears as the main villain in the [[1992 in video gaming|1992]] [[video game]] ''[[Spider-Man/X-Men: Arcade's Revenge]]'' for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Nintendo]] and [[Mega Drive|Sega Genesis]] and Sega Game Gear game systems.
* Arcade appears as one of the enemies in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'', voiced by [[Quinton Flynn]]. He is a member of [[Doctor Doom]]'s [[Masters of Evil]]. Here, Arcade and [[Baron Mordo]] divert the heroes from their attempt to attack Dr. Doom's castle to rescue the X-Men [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] and [[Jean Grey]]. Mordo uses his magic to disrupt [[Doctor Strange]]'s Orb of Teleportation and send the heroes to Murderworld instead of Castle Doom. Although the first area is a replica of Castle Doom, players can tell something is wrong by a few minor details (such as the carnival-like music playing, treasure chests with mallets that pop out, skeletons with clown noses, broken pillars revealing striped poles, and portraits of Dr. Doom wearing Arcade-like wigs, even though Arcade appears blond instead of redheaded in his in-game portraits). Besides having the normal Murderworld traps, Arcade also has [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]] and [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] working for him, uses mind control to force Jean Grey to attack the heroes, captures [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] and [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Senator Kelly]], and finally attacks the heroes himself in a giant robot called the Arcade-Bot. After beating Arcade, he tells the player that Dr. Doom has Nightcrawler, and has taken him to [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto's]] Realm. His fate is unknown after that. Arcade was also the villain on [[Deadpool]]'s simulator disc, where he is irritated greatly by Deadpool's refusal to accept that Murderworld isn't a normal theme park (although this ''probably'' is Deadpool's taunting rather than an actual lack of understanding, Deadpool's borderline insanity makes this uncertain), and forcing the mercenary to fight Dark Spider-Man (who Arcade referred to as his creation). He is also the villain in [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther's]] disc, threatening T'Challa to give the secret codes to [[Wakanda (comics)|Wakanda]]'s [[vibranium (comics)|vibranium]] facility (which of course he doesn't tell) and forcing Black Panther to fight Dark [[Captain America]]. [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm's]] disc where she fights [[Hussar (comics)|Hussar]] and the versus [[Mysterio]] simulator take place in Murderworld as does Mr. Fantastic's in his fight against [[Bulldozer (comics)|Bulldozer]]. Arcade has special dialogue with [[Mister Fantastic]] (at the Pinball Machine), and [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] (in via [[Xbox 360]] DLC and Gold Edition), [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]] (at the Disco Drop), [[Luke Cage]] (before the fight), [[Captain America]] (after the fight), and [[Deadpool]] (in his simulation disk).
* A [[Marvel 2099]] version of Arcade appears as one of the main villains in the [[Nintendo DS]] version of ''[[Spider-Man: Edge of Time]]'', voiced by [[Jim Cummings]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Oct 3, 2011 7:35&nbsp;pm |url=http://marvel.com/news/story/16765/spider-man_edge_of_time_available_now |title=Spider-Man: Edge of Time Available Now |publisher=Marvel.com |date=October 3, 2011}}</ref> He control a game cyber-arena in the year 2099 to hunt down and destroy heroes in front of a live-audience. He seeks to challenge Spider-Man (who is stranded in the year 2099), but is defeated.
* Arcade appears as one of the main villains in the [[Facebook]] game ''[[Marvel: Avengers Alliance]]''. He is featured in the 15th Spec-Ops that is loosely based on ''[[Avengers Arena]]''.
