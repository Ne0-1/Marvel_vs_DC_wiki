'''Arcade''' is a [[fictional character]] and [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He first appeared in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' volume 1 #65 (January 1978).

==Character biography==
A combination of [[evil genius]] and [[hitman]], Arcade affects a manner of dress and speech that makes him appear to be a comedic character. This is part of his overall theme, which extends into his preferred method of [[murder]], an underground complex of [[deathtrap (plot device)|deathtrap]]s, disguised as an [[amusement park]], which he has dubbed "'''Murderworld'''".

Arcade's [[backstory]], up to and including his real name, remains largely unknown even to this day. This is mainly the result of his uncanny knack for escaping once he has been defeated. Because of this dubious talent, Arcade has never once been captured and, consequently, all information about his life prior to his first appearance is what he has decided to disseminate. Given his propensity for deception, this origin story can hardly be taken at face value.

According to the man himself, he was born into an extremely wealthy family and lived for much of his early life in, depending on the telling, a [[ranch]] in [[Texas]] or a [[mansion]] in [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]]. At the age of either eighteen or twenty-one, again depending on the telling, his [[allowance]] was cut off by his father, who declared that he did not deserve it. In retaliation, Arcade allegedly murdered his father, thus inheriting all of the man's supposedly vast [[estate (law)|estate]].

Now independently wealthy and free to do as he pleased, Arcade became a freelance [[assassination|assassin]], traveling across the world, killing people in rather mundane fashions, and amassing even more wealth than he already had. Eventually, he grew bored with doing business as an ordinary hired killer and resolved to find a way to continue his work in a manner more suited to his sensibilities.

Discovering an aptitude for technology, Arcade designed and built Murderworld, a subterranean [[Evil Lair|evil lair]] disguised as a very deadly amusement park. From this base, and with the help of two mysterious assistants named '''Miss Locke''' and '''Mr. Chambers''', he reemerged as the world's most expensive hitman. For the price of $1 million (actually a [[token sum]], since Arcade doesn't need the money and, in any case, never turns a profit), he will tailor Murderworld to exploit the specific weaknesses of his target and then watch, with unconcealed [[glee]], as they are killed by the variety of [[trap]]s strewn throughout the facility.

Since his first attempt to slay the unlikely duo of [[Spider-Man]] and [[Captain Britain]], Arcade has tangled, at one time or another, with a large number of heroes and teams of heroes. In addition to battling the [[X-Men]], [[X-Factor]], [[Alpha Flight]], and [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] as groups, he has attempted to kill many individual members, usually in pairs. Examples of this include [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] and [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] and [[Shadowcat]], and [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] and [[Angel (comics)|Angel]]. Other would-be victims of Murderworld have included [[Longshot]], [[Green Goblin]] (Phil Urich), [[Doctor Doom]], [[Ghost Rider]], and the [[Micronauts]].

==Powers and abilities==
Arcade has no superhuman powers but is an bona fide genius with knowledge of technology far ahead of conventional science, particularly in the fields of robotics and mechanical and electrical engineering. Usually, when he appears to be captured it turns out to be a robot.

==Other versions==
In the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Universe]], Arcade is portrayed as a [[computer and video games|gaming]] [[prodigy]] who invented a literal [[first-person shooter]]. When the Ultimate Universe version of Longshot is found guilty of murdering a [[Genosha]]n politician, he is sentenced to participate in a [[reality television|reality TV]] show in which he is [[Survivor (TV series)|stranded on an island]] and hunted by Arcade. As Arcade makes his way through the island jungle, he encounters three X-Men trying to save the prisoner. He dispatchs them easily, though, and is about to kill [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] when Longshot knocks him unconscious.

Similarly, the television series ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'' reimagines Arcade as a high-school gamer named Webber Torque (who calls himself Arcade), who is tricked by a disguised Mystique into believing that the X-Men's mansion security console is an elaborate video game and using it to attack the X-Men, who he believes to be game characters. Despite nearly killing the X-Men, this version of Arcade is not evil, and apologizes for having played the "video game" without permission.
