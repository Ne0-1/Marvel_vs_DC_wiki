'''Hawkgirl''' and '''Hawkwoman''' are the names of several [[fictional character]]s, [[superheroine]]s in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC universe|universe]].  They are partners, and sometimes spouses or lovers, of the various incarnations of [[Hawkman]].

==Shiera Sanders (Hawkgirl)==
The [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] Hawkgirl was Shiera Sanders (or Saunders), the [[reincarnation]] of the [[Egypt|Egyptian]] princess Chay-Ara, and partner of Carter Hall, the Golden Age Hawkman.  The Hawks were members of the [[All-Star Squadron]], and while Hawkman was a member of the [[Justice Society of America]], Hawkgirl was not a member, only assisting the group on occasion, although recent [[retcon|retcons]] seem to point to Hawkgirl being formally inducted into the JSA at some time. Eventually, Carter and Shiera married and had one son, [[Silver Scarab|Hector Hall]], who is the current [[Doctor Fate]].

Through retcon Carter and Shiera joined the [[Justice League of America]] in the early 1980s.

Shiera died when she was merged with Carter and Katar Hol to form a new Hawkman version, a "hawk god" creature, during the events of [[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]].

==Shayera Hol (Hawkwoman)==
{{splitsection|Hawkwoman}} 
The [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] Hawkwoman was Shayera Hol, a law enforcement officer from the planet [[Thanagar]] and wife of Katar Hol, the Silver Age Hawkman.  She was a member of the [[Justice League]].

She was born on Thanagar, a planet orbiting the star [[Polaris]]. Thanagar had a scientifically advanced civilization in which crime was virtually unknown. As an adolescent, Shayera joined the Thanagarian police force and was assigned to assist the force's most decorated officer, Katar Hol, in capturing the Rainbow Robbers. At first, Katar was furious at being assigned an inexperienced young woman as a partner, but he nevertheless became strongly attracted to her. 

Together, they captured the Rainbow Robbers in their stronghold found behind a waterfall; and a few weeks later, Katar proposed to Shayera in front of the same waterfall. She accepted and they were married. Sometime later, the couple was sent to Earth in pursuit of the criminal [[Byth]] Rok. Upon reaching Earth, they were befriended by [[Midway City]] police commissioner George Emmett, who established cover identities for them as Carter and Shiera Hall. After capturing Byth and bringing him back to their planet, Katar and Shayera chose to return to study Earth's crimefighting methods, and they fought against evil as the superheroes Hawkman and Hawkwoman. 

As Hawkwoman, Shayera eventually joined her husband as a member of the Justice League. As Shiera, she first worked as Carter's secretary, but later became co-director of the Midway City Museum. Recently, Thanagar had established itself as a military dictatorship bent on conquering other planets. Hawkman and Hawkwoman thwarted Thanagarian plans to invade Earth, destroying their own starship in the process. Hawkman and Hawkwoman remain on Earth, regarded as traitors by everyone on Thanagar.

Following ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', Shayera Hol (and Hawkman II) was wiped out of DC Comics [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]].

==Sharon Parker "Hall" (Hawkwoman)==
Years before the events told in the ''Invasion'' story arc, Fel Andar, a hybrid Human-[[Thanagarian]] [[spy]], was sent to Earth to infiltrate among humans. Eventually he met and married an Earth woman, '''Sharon Parker''', who would soon give birth to Charles Parker -- later the [[Golden Eagle (comics)|Golden Eagle]].

When Charlie was four years old, Thanagar called Andar to active duty, so he joined the [[Justice League|JLI]] claiming to be Carter and Shiera Hall's son Carter Hall, Jr. Andar never told the Thanagarian Empire of his own son, so they mindwiped Sharon, forcing her to take the identity of '''Hawkwoman Sharon Hall''', wife of Carter Hall Jr.

When Sharon learnt about the masquerade she exposed the truth to [[J'onn J'onzz]] and [[Maxwell Lord]]. Confronted by both, Andar escaped back to Thanagar but not before murdering Sharon for her betrayal.

==Shayera Thal (Hawkwoman II)==
In the early 1990's, Thanagarian policemen partners Katar Hol and Shayera Thal arrived on Earth with the mission to capture the Thanagarian shape-shifting criminal Byth. They were part of a force which used the hawk as their symbol, and also had a winged, gravity-defying harness. Together they fought crime on Earth for some time until their tempestuous working relationship led them to break up their partnership.

Then came the events of [[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]] where Katar was merged with Carter and Shiera Hall in a new Hawkman version, which briefly created the "hawk god" creature. This Hawkman adventured for a brief time before going insane and being banished into [[limbo]].

Shortly after that, Kendra Saunders became the new Hawkgirl, and Carter Hall, the original Hawkman, was resurrected. Shayera met them on her final battle against Byth when the three Hawks, aided by [[Animal Man]], defeated the Thanagarian criminal for good.

Shayera's mission on Earth was ended and she went back to Thanagar.

In the ''[[Rann-Thanagar War]]'' miniseries, Shayera Thal reappeared as a reinstated soldier of the Thanagarian Army, last seen fighting with the invasion force of Polara. She considered reborn Hawkman Carter Hall and Hawkgirl Kendra Saunders friends of [[Thanagar]], but grew angry with their ally [[Adam Strange]] blaming Rannian science for the destruction of her birth world. Despite this, she reluctantly served alongside him as a comrade-in-arms during the war.

In ''[[Rann-Thanagar War]]'' #5, Shayera was betrayed and murdered by [[Tamaranean]] Queen [[Blackfire|Komand'r]]. Her body was sent on a trajectory into the [[Polaris|Sun Polaris]], the heroes' resting place in Thanagarian tradition.

==Kendra Saunders (Hawkgirl II)==
The current Hawkgirl is Kendra Saunders, a young woman who committed [[suicide]]. When Kendra's [[soul]] left her body, that of her grandaunt, Shiera Hall, the Golden Age Hawkgirl, entered it. She currently has all of Kendra's memories, but almost none of Shiera's.  She is a member of the Justice Society.

Kendra will be taking over Hawkman's series with #50, renaming the title ''Hawkgirl'' in the process.

==Hawkgirl (animated)==

Hawkgirl, based on the Silver Age version, made a few appearances in the animated "Super Friends" cartoon of the 1970s and 1980s. She did not appear as often as her husband Hawkman. She was never called anything but Hawkgirl on "Super Friends." No real name, secret identity, etc... was revealed.

==Shayera Hol (animated)==
Hawkgirl appears in the animated ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'' series on [[Cartoon Network]]. This version of Hawkgirl, who fell in love with the [[John Stewart (comics)|Green Lantern]], was a regular member of the Justice League throughout the series, but in the end was revealed as a Thanagarian advance scout/spy for an invasion force.

In the last episode of the original ''Justice League'' series (the show continued in a new incarnation as ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''), she betrays the League and helps the Thanagarian invaders defeat them, but switches sides at the very last minute when the Thanagarian leader, Hro Talak, tries to kill all life on Earth.

Despite her change of heart, Hawkgirl resigned from the team. She stayed at the tower of [[Doctor Fate]] for some time, but in the ''Justice League Unlimited'' episode "Wake the Dead," Hawkgirl assists the League in defeating [[Solomon Grundy (DC Comics)|Solomon Grundy]] and rejoins. The founding members of the Justice League form a governing council in ''Unlimited'', and Hawkgirl is accorded this status after rejoining.

In the future of [[Batman Beyond]], Hawkgirl eventually married Green Lantern and had a son, [[Warhawk (Justice League Unlimited)|Warhawk]], who serves in the Justice League of that era.

Recently, Hawkgirl was tracked down by an archaeologist named Carter Hall who, it was later revealed, believed himself to be the reincarnation of her Thanagarian lover from ages past. Hall took on the mantle of [[Hawkman]]. As of September 2005, their status remains unresolved.
