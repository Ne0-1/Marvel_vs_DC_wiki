'''Hawkgirl''' is the name of several fictional [[superheroines]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. The original Hawkgirl, Shiera Sanders Hall, was created by writer [[Gardner Fox]] and artist [[Dennis Neville]], and first appeared in ''[[Flash Comics]]'' #1 (January 1940). Shayera Hol was created by writer [[Gardner Fox]] and artist [[Joe Kubert]], and first appeared in ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' #34 (March 1961). Kendra Saunders was created by writer [[David S. Goyer]] and artist [[Stephen Sadowski]], and first appeared in ''JSA Secret Files and Origins'' #1 (August 1999). One of DC's earliest super-heroines, Hawkgirl has appeared in many of the company's flagship team-up titles including [[Justice Society of America]] and [[Justice League of America]].

Several incarnations of Hawkgirl have appeared in DC Comics, all of them characterized by the use of archaic weaponry and artificial wings, attached to a harness made from the special [[Nth metal]] that allows flight. Most incarnations of Hawkgirl work closely with a partner/romantic interest [[Hawkman]].

Since DC’s [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] was rewritten in the 1985 series ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', Hawkgirl history has become muddled with several new versions of the character appearing throughout the years, some associated with ancient Egypt and some with the fictional planet [[Thanagar]]. These versions of the character have starred in several series of various durations.

Hawkgirl has been adapted into various media, including [[DC Universe Animated Original Movies|direct-to-video animated films]], video games, and both live-action and animated television series, featuring as a main or recurring character in the shows ''[[Justice League Animated]]'', ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'', ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'', ''[[DC Super Hero Girls]]'' and ''[[DC's Legends of Tomorrow]]''. [[IGN]]'s list of the ''"Top 25 Heroes of DC Comics"'' ranked Hawkgirl as ''#22''.<ref>http://www.ign.com/articles/the-top-25-heroes-of-dc-comics</ref> She was ranked ''80th'' in [[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'s ''"100 Sexiest Women in Comics"'' list.<ref>https://comicvine.gamespot.com/comics-buyers-guide-presents-2-100-sexiest-women-i/4000-463770/</ref>

==Publication history==

===Golden Age===
Created by writer [[Gardner Fox]] and artist [[Dennis Neville]], Shiera Sanders first appeared in ''[[Flash Comics]]'' #1 (Jan. 1940), in the same 12-page story in which Fox and Neville introduced [[Hawkman]].<ref>[http://www.comics.org/issue/615/ ''Flash Comics'' #1] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]</ref> Archaeologist [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Carter Hall]] has a dream that he is an ancient [[Egypt]]ian prince, Khufu, who has a lover, named Shiera in the original story, or Princess Chay-Ara in modern retellings. The next day, Carter meets a woman named Shiera who looks exactly like the woman in his dream. Carter dons the identity of Hawkman and Shiera becomes Carter's girlfriend. Shiera first appears as Hawkgirl in ''[[All Star Comics]]'' #5 (July 1941), in a costume created by [[Sheldon Moldoff]],<ref>[http://www.comics.org/character/name/hawkgirl/sort/chrono/ Hawkgirl] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> based on Neville's Hawkman costume. During Hawkman's solo segment of the [[Justice Society of America]] story, Shiera dons a spare set of [[Nth metal]] wings developed by Hawkman, and masquerades as Hawkman in order to trick some criminals. Shiera continues to wear the costume and wings in later stories, eventually adopting the identity of Hawkgirl.

===Silver Age===
{{Main|Hawkwoman}}
With the fading popularity of superheroes during the late 1940s, the Hawkman feature ended in the last issue of ''Flash Comics'' in 1949. In 1956, DC Comics resurrected the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] by revamping the character with a new identity and backstory. Following the success of the new Flash, DC Comics revamped Hawkman in a similar fashion with ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' #34 in 1961. The Silver Age versions of Hawkman and Hawkgirl became married alien police officers from the planet [[Thanagar]] who come to Earth in order to study police techniques. Silver Age Hawkgirl is introduced as Shayera Hol (phonetically identical to Shiera Hall), who appears in costume as of her first appearance. Although Silver Age Hawkman joins the [[Justice League]] in ''Justice League of America'' #31 in 1964, Silver Age Hawkgirl was not offered membership because Justice League rules only allowed for one new member to be admitted at a time. Several years later, Silver Age Hawkgirl joined the Justice League of America with issue #146 in 1977. In 1981, Silver Age Hawkgirl changed her name to [[Hawkwoman]] in the Hawkman backup feature of ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' #274.

With the establishment of DC's [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]] system, the Golden Age Hawkgirl was said to have lived on [[Earth-Two]] and the Silver Age Hawkgirl on [[Earth-One]]. Although Golden Age Hawkman makes his first Silver Age appearance during the first JLA/JSA teamup in 1963 and continues making appearances during the annual JLA/JSA teamups, Golden Age Hawkgirl does not reappear until 1976, in the revival of the ''All Star Comics'' monthly comic. During the publication gap between the cancellation of Hawkman at the end of the Golden Age and the reintroduction of Earth-Two Hawkman during the Silver Age, Golden Age Hawkman and Hawkgirl are married off-panel. Golden Age Hawkgirl made further appearances as the mother of [[Hector Hall|Silver Scarab]] in the ''Infinity Inc.'' comic and as Hawkgirl as a member of the [[All-Star Squadron]], a retroactive team of Golden Age heroes active in the 1940s.

===Post-Crisis and One Year Later===
Following the events of DC's miniseries, ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', the histories of Earth-One, Two, Four, S, and X were merged into one single Earth with a consistent past, present, and future. As a result, both the Golden Age and the Silver Age versions of Hawkman and Hawkgirl live on the same Earth. Shortly after ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', DC decided that having the Justice Society on the same Earth as all of the other superheroes was redundant and most of the team, including Golden Age Hawkman and Hawkgirl were given a sendoff in the ''Last Days of the Justice Society'' [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]]. The Justice Society were trapped in another dimension, [[Limbo (DC Comics)|Limbo]], where they would battle for all of eternity to prevent [[Ragnarök]] from occurring on the Earth.

Initially, the Silver Age Hawkman and Hawkwoman were kept in continuity unchanged after ''Crisis on Infinite Earths''. However, DC reversed this decision and [[reboot (continuity)|rebooted]] Hawkman continuity after the success of the ''[[Hawkworld]]'' miniseries. Originally, ''Hawkworld'' was a miniseries set in the past that revised the origins of Hawkman and Hawkwoman, but after the series became a success, DC Comics made ''Hawkworld'' an ongoing series set in the present, with both heroes only recently appearing on Earth after the events in the ''Invasion!'' miniseries, resulting in a complete reboot of Hawkman continuity. Several continuity errors regarding Hawkman and Hawkgirl's Justice League appearances then needed to be fixed, including their appearance in the ''Invasion!'' miniseries. All previous appearances by the Silver Age Hawkgirl in the Justice League were explained by the Golden Age Hawkgirl taking the Silver Age Hawkgirl's place. However, Hawkwoman continued to appear in some pre-''Hawkworld'' Justice League adventures during the time Golden Age Hawkgirl was trapped in Limbo. To explain this continuity error, a new Hawkwoman, [[Hawkwoman#Sharon Parker "Hall"|Sharon Parker]], was created and retconned into the Justice League during the time Golden Age Hawkgirl was in Limbo.

After the Hawkworld reboot, Hawkgirl (Hawkwoman) was now Shayera Thal and not married to Katar Hol, instead merely his police partner. In post-Hawkworld continuity, Shayera adopts the name Hawkwoman from the very beginning of her costumed career and never uses the name Hawkgirl. The Golden Age Hawkgirl is eventually returned from Limbo, but during the ''[[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time|Zero Hour]]'' miniseries she is merged with Katar Hol and Golden Age Hawkman into a new persona.

A new Hawkgirl was introduced as part of the 1999 revival of the JSA monthly title. The new Hawkgirl is Kendra Saunders, granddaughter of the Golden Age Hawkgirl's cousin, [[Speed Saunders]]. Hawkgirl would continue to appear regularly in the monthly ''JSA'' series and later in the ''Hawkman'' monthly. In 2006, the ongoing ''Hawkman'' monthly series was retitled ''Hawkgirl'' starting with issue #50 as part of the "[[One Year Later]]" jump forward; Kendra replaced Hawkman as the lead character. The ''Hawkgirl'' comic book series was finished with issue #66.

Kendra was a recurrent member of the [[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]. [[Oracle (DC Comics)|Oracle]] first solicits her assistance in issue #104 in dealing with the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]], for which Oracle rewards her with a car. Throughout the Russian arc, Hawkgirl serves as a team member and develops a rivalry with Secret Six member [[Scandal (comics)|Scandal]].

She was a member of the [[Justice League of America]] at its relaunch, but left the team due to injuries sustained in ''[[Final Crisis]]''. Kendra and the original Hawkman (Carter Hall) were killed during the ''Blackest Night'' storyline; Katar Hol had been killed previously in a final battle with the Hawkgod, and Carter Hall, who had reincarnated in a new body, replaced him as Hawkgirl's partner. Carter and Shiera were resurrected after ''Blackest Night'', but Kendra has since been killed again.

==Fictional character biography==
===Shiera Sanders Hall===<!-- This section is linked from [[Justice Society of America]] -->
[[File:HawkgirlShieraHall.jpeg|thumb|Hawkgirl (Shiera Hall).<br/>Art by [[Fernando Pasarin]].]]
The [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] Hawkgirl was Shiera Sanders Hall, the [[reincarnation]] of the [[Egypt]]ian princess Chay-Ara, and partner of [[Carter Hall (comics)|Carter Hall]], the Golden Age Hawkman. Centuries ago, Chay-Ara and her lover Prince Khufu were killed by [[Hath-Set]] with a knife forged from [[Nth metal]]. The properties of the metal and the strength of the duo's love created a bond between them, causing them to be reborn multiple times throughout the centuries. Some of her incarnations are:

* Lady Celia Penbrook, alive during 5th century [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and love of [[Silent Knight]]
* [[Cinnamon (comics)|Cinnamon]] (also known as Kate Manser), an [[American Old West|Old West]] gunslinger, and love of [[Nighthawk (DC Comics)|Nighthawk]]
* Sheila Carr, lady love of [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkerton]] detective James Wright

In the early 20th century, Chay-Ara was reborn as Shiera Sanders. She was kidnapped by Dr. Anton Hastor (reincarnation of Hath-Set), but subsequently rescued by Hawkman (her reborn lover Khufu). Shiera became the hero's frequent ally and love interest. Eventually, she was granted a costume of her own and a belt of gravity-defying Nth metal, and joined him at his side as Hawkgirl.

The Hawks were members of the [[All-Star Squadron]], and while Hawkman was a member of the [[Justice Society of America]], Hawkgirl was not, only assisting the group on occasion. [[Retroactive continuity|Retcons]] indicate that Hawkgirl is formally inducted into the JSA at some point. Eventually, Carter and Shiera married and had one son, [[Hector Hall]], the previous [[Doctor Fate]].

Through retcon, Carter and Shiera also joined the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]] in the late 1980s, serving as liaisons between that group and the Justice Society.

Shiera died when she was merged with Carter and [[Hawkman (Katar Hol)|Katar Hol]] to form a new Hawkman version, a "hawk god" creature, during the events of ''[[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time|Zero Hour]]'', but was revived during the events of ''[[Blackest Night]]'' by the White Lantern ring.

===Kendra Saunders===
[[File:HawkmanCv42.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Hawkgirl (Kendra Saunders).<br>Art by [[Matt Haley]].]]
Kendra Saunders was a young woman who committed [[suicide]]. When Kendra's [[soul]] left her body, that of her grandfather's first cousin Shiera Hall, the Golden Age Hawkgirl entered it, making Kendra a [[walk-in]]. Her grandfather, former OSS agent and globe-trotting adventurer [[Speed Saunders]], recognized this, in part due to a change in eye color, and encouraged his granddaughter to embrace her destiny as the "new" Hawkgirl.

Kendra had a daughter named Mia, who is not shown but mentioned.

Still believing herself to be Kendra, she debuted as a hero using the original Hawkgirl's equipment and set out in search of a being called the Fate-Child (actually her own reincarnated son, [[Hector Hall]]). This led to a meeting with the [[Justice Society]] and Kendra's induction to that team.

She currently has all of Kendra's memories, but almost none of Shiera's save for fighting experiences. This creates tension with Hawkman since he remembers all of their past lives together and believes they are destined for each other. Kendra has been presented as a very troubled young woman, haunted by the murder of her parents by a corrupt cop and confused by her jumble of memories and feelings. She has operated as [[Hawkman]]'s partner but only recently begun to actually admit her attraction to him. The truth about Kendra's identity was eventually revealed to her by the angel [[Zauriel]].

She is one of the heroes who fought in space during the [[Rann-Thanagar War]]. Following the events of Infinite Crisis, a [[Rann#Rannian technology|Zeta Beam]] transporter malfunction injured many of the superheroes in space, including Hawkgirl, causing her to grow over twenty feet tall. [[One Year Later|Some time later]], her proper stature restored, Kendra was shown living in [[St. Roch, Louisiana]], working in Stonechat Museum and protecting the city as Hawkgirl.

She is also a returning member of the new [[Justice League]], having effectively served with the team when the original members were previously missing. A brewing relationship between Hawkgirl and [[Roy Harper (comics)|Red Arrow]] become one of the major subplots in the series though it appears to have ended. Hawkgirl is now 100% Kendra Saunders. Shiera Sanders' soul left Kendra's body and moved on to the afterlife. Shiera hopes her passing on will finally remove the curse of Hath-Set.<ref>''HawkGirl'' #66 (September 2007)</ref>

====''Hawkman Vol. 4 (2002–2006)''====
Lasting four years and forty-nine issues, ''[[Hawkman]]'' was an ongoing monthly comic book series. In the first issue, Kendra is featured having a discussion with her grandfather, [[Speed Saunders]], wanting to know more about her parents murder, he tells her to search after Danny Evans, an archaeologist working in Stonechat Museum that was in a mission in India trying to save the Museum from shutting down. Hawkgirl decides to go after him with [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Hawkman]]'s assist, when they encounter Danny they fight against [[Shadow Thief]], Tigress and Copperhead, the three were trying to stole the diamond Danny was looking for, during the fight [[Tigress (DC Comics)|Tigress]] escapes with the diamond and Hawkman, Shadow Thief and [[Copperhead (DC Comics)|Copperhead]] are taken to the Battlelands, a hidden fold in reality created by Shiva to protect Ganesha's descendants. Still in India, Kendra and Danny have a conversation about Kendra's parents and why they were murdered, much for Hawkgirl's dismay he didn't knew much about it, after this they retrieved the diamond and put it back in his place, opening a portal to Battlelands, rescuing Hawkman and the others.<ref>''Hawkman'' #1 (January 2002)</ref>

During the events of ''Slings and Arrows'', Kendra and Carter started working in Stonechat Museum, as field agents. Hawkgirl also meets [[Green Arrow]] for the first time while he is in city looking for [[Alias the Spider|The Spider]], a killer that was trying to incriminate him. Working together to find him, they fight against the criminal and Green Arrow shoots the Spider in his aiming eye with an arrow, hoping to end the criminal's career by maiming him. Later on is shown that Spider manages to re-learn archery from a new perspective.<ref>''Hawkman'' #6 (August 2002)</ref>

One of Kendra past lives is revealed, as the bounty hunter [[Cinnamon (comics)|Cinnamon]], a reincarnation of the Egyptian princess Chay-Ara. As such, she becomes the lover of Prince Khufu's reincarnation, the hero [[Nighthawk (DC Comics)|Nighthawk]]. When Cinnamon is assaulted by the burglar [[Gentleman Ghost|"Gentleman Jim" Craddock]], Nighthawk hangs him up, thereby tying his destiny to theirs. Cinnamon, along with Nighthawk, is killed by the latest incarnation of Hath-Set, their biggest enemy.<ref>''Hawkman'' #7 (September 2002)</ref>

Kendra and Carter travel to Mount Kailas, Tibet, to save her grandfather that was kidnapped by a mysterious figure that was later revealed as being [[Hath-Set]] latest reincarnation, Helena Astar.<ref>''Hawkman'' #10 (November 2002)</ref> Helena discovered that [[Speed Saunders|Speed]] was in Tibet searching for the [[Thanagar|absorbascon]], an ancient device from [[Thanagar]] that had the abilities to absorb knowledge and souls, alongside the power to restore lost memories, being the reason why Speed was looking for it, in the hopes to bring Kendra lost memories, when he found the device he was captured by Helena.<ref>''Hawkman'' #11 (December 2002)</ref> Later the Hawks were taken by her in an attempt to kill them, unsuccessfully, since the [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]] shows up and saves them from being murdered, Hawkgirl defeats Helena all by herself proving to Carter that she had more determination than he had given her credit of. After Kendra destroys the absorbascon Helena is transformed in a statue of salt, during a fight against Helena's henchmen the statue is broken, supposedly killing her. Hawkgirl develops a friendship with the Atom, after saving him twice from being killed during the fight against Hath-Set latest reincarnation. After this events Kendra started seeing [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Hawkman]] as a friend rather than just a partner, as shown in the earlier chapters, marking a big step in there relationship.<ref>''Hawkman'' #12 (February 2003)</ref>

Haunted by nightmares of her past, when she and her mother were assaulted by two police officers. Though only a child, she fought back and during the chaos, one of the attackers accidentally shot and killed the other and fled, years later, her parents tracked the surviving attacker to St.Roch, where he ambushed and murdered them. Kendra finally encounters the attacker, chief of police Albert Nedal, that would later be killed at the hands of [[Gentleman Ghost]].<ref>''Hawkman'' #14 (April 2003)</ref>

Sometime after the events of [[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]], where [[Katar Hol]] was merged with [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Carter]] and Shiera Hall in a new [[Hawkman]] version, who was then possessed by a creature from the red known as the Hawk Avatar.<ref>''Hawkman'' #15 (May 2003)</ref> [[Hawkwoman]] retired from superhero work to become a cop in Detroit, she met with Hawkgirl while searching for her missing partner, later on Shayera Thal would be captured by [[Byth|Byth Rok]], leading for Shayera's final battle against him when she, aided by Hawkgirl, defeated the Thanagarian criminal for good.<ref>''Hawkman'' #16 (June 2003)</ref> Hawkwoman gave Hawkgirl her harness as a symbol of their recently formed partnership before departing to [[Thanagar]] with Byth as her prisoner.<ref>''Hawkman'' #17 (July 2003)</ref>

Hawkgirl always felt that she wasn't the first person [[Hawkman]] would turn to in a moment of crisis, treating her as damsel in distress incapable of holding her own against dangers she might come to face, degrading her position in both the eyes of the [[Justice Society of America]] and in their partnership, where he would frequently treat her as a [[sidekick]], something Kendra declares she's not, wanting to be seeing as his equal.<ref>''Hawkman'' #42 (October 2005)</ref> Towards the end of the series Hawkgirl reveals all of her feelings to [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Carter]], causing the hero to apologize, saying he was treating her wrongly all along, the story finishes in a romantic tone with the Hawks fighting together during the ''[[Rann-Thanagar War]]''.<ref>''Hawkman'' #49 (April 2006)</ref>

====''Hawkgirl, the series''====
After ''Hawkman'' ongoing monthly series is retitled, changing to ''[[Hawkman|Hawkgirl]]'', Kendra replaces Carter as the lead character. Hawkgirl is seen protecting [[St. Roch, Louisiana]], in the absence of Hawkman and working in Stonechat Museum. She fought Khimaera several times,<ref>''HawkGirl'' #50 (May 2006)</ref> and finally killed her.<ref>''HawkGirl'' #56 (November 2006)</ref> She was later abducted and put on trial for high treason against her people by a group of rogue Thanagarians.<ref>''HawkGirl'' #57 (December 2006)</ref> After being found guilty, one of the rogues tied her hands behind her back and covered her mouth with a piece of duct tape, and then attempted to lynch her. Kendra found that she could hover without her wings and was able to fake her death and escape by using this new power.<ref>''HawkGirl'' #58 (January 2007)</ref> Kendra was also a target of [[Blackfire]] which decided to go to Earth in order to kill Hawkgirl and Hawkman, but the Hawks defeated her and took away her powers.<ref>''HawkGirl'' #59 (February 2007)</ref>

Kendra also fought alongside the furies of [[Darkseid]] while St.Roch was being attacked by an evil weapon of [[Apokolips]], the gizmoid. The Furies were assigned a squadron of Parademons in order to find a stolen Beta-3 Gizmoid. They discover that the gizmoid has landed in St. Roch. According to their readings, the gizmoid has been activated and Bernadeth wants the gizmoid because Darkseid can't allow Earth to be destroyed by anything from Apokolips or it will mean war with High Father. It turns out [[Desaad]] designed these gizmoids to be a planet killer but production of the device was put on hold when a rogue Parademon escaped with a gizmoid through a Boom Tube. The Parademon landed in Ancient Egypt and hid the gizmoid before he was killed by Desaad's trackers.<ref>''HawkGirl'' #60 (March 2007)</ref>

The gizmoid finds itself near Stonechat Museum and it spots Hawkgirl soaring through the air. Its acquisition is computed as prognosticative Boolean algebra. The gizmoid decides that Hawkgirl would be a suitable template to begin Earth's eradication but before it could replicate itself, the Furies converge on its location by via Boom Tube. The gizmoid narrowly escapes by releasing radion gas to slow them down. Hawkgirl spots the disturbance and notices the [[Female Furies]] are barely conscious. The gizmoid comes up from behind Hawkgirl and pacifies her then it optimizes for template replication.<ref>''HawkGirl'' #61 (April 2007)</ref>

When the gizmoid was finished replicating, it disposed of Hawkgirl like a ragdoll and it became a mechanized version of Hawkgirl. The gizmoid begins attacking St. Roch with an arsenal of weaponry. [[Bernadeth]] tries to destroy the gizmoid with a series of centiblades but her attempt was unsuccessful. Fortunately, the Nth metal on Hawkgirl's wings became advanced by the gizmoid's brief attachment to her. Hawkgirl soars toward St. James Parish because the gizmoid was getting near that direction. Hawkgirl tells the Furies to focus their fire power on certain sections that she cuts off thereby cauterizing the wounds because the gizmoid can heal itself with nano machines.<ref>''HawkGirl'' #62 (May 2007)</ref>

Hawkgirl's plan worked and the gizmoid fell to pieces after sustaining the Furies' relentless punishment. As for Hawkgirl, the gizmoid's advancements wore off on her Nth metal because of its destruction and she became overly fatigued. Hawkgirl crashed near Mr. Dooley's Tavern and Bloody Mary followed soon after. Fortunately, Danny Evans was watching Hawkgirl's every move and he stopped Bloody Mary before she could sink her teeth into Hawkgirl's neck. The Female Furies collect [[Bloody Mary (DC Comics)|Bloody Mary]] and reluctantly thanked Hawkgirl for her efforts.

Kendra finally decides to fight against her mortal enemy, [[Hath-Set]], who had been watching her for some time, Hawkgirl started getting closer to finding him with the assistance of friends, such as [[Batman]], [[Superman]] and [[Batgirl|Oracle]].<ref>''Hawkgirl'' #63(June 2007)</ref> During her search Kendra is kidnapped by Hath-Set, aware of this [[Hawkman]] goes in a rescue mission, meanwhile Hawkgirl is able to free herself and encounter Hath-Set, who had imprisoned [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Carter]], after a final battle against the villain Kendra kills him and saves Hawkman, the two now finally in peace see themselves falling in love again, but with Hawkgirl saying that he must earn her love.<ref>''Hawkgirl'' #66 (September 2007)</ref>

====''Justice League of America''====
{{Main|Justice League}}
[[File:Justice League of America Vol 2 12 textless.jpeg|thumb|Hawkgirl on the cover of ''[[Justice League of America]]'' #12. Art by [[Alex Ross]].]]
Hawkgirl's main story arc in the early issues of [[Justice League of America|Justice League of America Vol. 2]], centered around her relationship with [[Roy Harper (comics)|Red Arrow]]. Initially both were looking for a fling, but then found themselves quickly in love, with Hawkgirl even meeting his daughter Lian, a result of his former romance with [[Cheshire (comics)|Cheshire]].<ref>''Justice League of America'' #11 (July 2007)</ref>

Their relationship became one of the major subplots of the series, [[Black Canary]] disapproval of the relationship brought some tension to it, alongside [[Powergirl|Power Girl]] advising Red Arrow to not get involved with Hawkgirl, since she was destined to eventually return to [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)]]. Despite of this they started dating, with the [[Justice League]] later finding out after [[Red Tornado]] caught Hawkgirl and Red Arrow sleeping together.<ref>''Justice League of America'' #12 (August 2007)</ref>

This was the beginning of a turbulent relationship, but past relationships, parenting, and being unable to express their feelings to each other caused problems. Red Arrow constantly suffering from [[Cheshire (comics)|Cheshire's]] absence, Hawkgirl conflicted feelings regarding [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Hawkman]] brought stress in their romance, making the couple fight regularly. Eventually the relationship dissolved and Red Arrow left the [[Justice League]].<ref>''Justice League of America'' #30 (February 2009)</ref>

While in a mission with the [[Justice League]] inside the ''[[Salvation Run|Prison Planet]],'' Hawkgirl discovered another ability provided by the [[Nth Metal]], the power to weaken forces drawn from the fabric of space-time, due to this Kendra was the only member not affected by [[Kanjar Ro]], making her capable of fighting against the villain and rescuing her friends. Hawkgirl left the [[Justice League]] due to injuries sustained in [[Final Crisis]].<ref>''Justice League of America'' #31 (March 2009)</ref>

====Blackest Night====
{{Main|Blackest Night}}
In ''Blackest Night'' #1, Kendra is shown having an argument with Hawkman over whether or not to visit [[Jean Loring]]'s grave with the [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]]. As the two heroes quarrel, the reanimated corpses of [[Elongated Man|Ralph]] and [[Sue Dibny]], now members of the [[Black Lantern Corps]], enter Hawkman's sanctuary. The Black Lanterns attack, Sue impaling Hawkgirl on a spear. Ralph taunts Hawkman, telling him that Hawkgirl never loved him; a claim she refutes with her dying breath. Hawkman is killed shortly afterward, and both heroes are reanimated as Black Lanterns by [[Black Hand (comics)|Black Hand]] himself.<ref name="bn1">''Blackest Night'' #1 (July 2009)</ref>

During the battling at Coast City, the Atom is chosen by the [[Indigo Tribe]] to be more effective against [[Nekron]]'s forces.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #6 (December 2009)</ref> The Atom tells Indigo-1 to keep his involvement in the deployment of the troops a secret, and asks that she help him find a way to legitimately resurrect Hawkman and Hawkgirl.<ref>''The Atom and Hawkman'' #46 (January 2010)</ref> In the final battle, the duo are transformed by Hal Jordan into the White Lantern Corps and upon Nekron's destruction, they are both resurrected.

====Brightest Day====
{{Main|Brightest Day}}
In the ''[[Brightest Day]]'' crossover, Carter and Shiera follow Hath-Set, who has collected the bones from all of their past bodies, and created from them a portal to [[Hawkworld]]. While there, Shiera is told by the [[White Lantern Corps|Entity]] to stop Hath-Set from killing Carter, because if he dies one more time, he will not undergo the cycle of resurrection again.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #7 (August 2010)</ref> Shiera is attacked in Hawkworld's dungeon and captured by Hath-Set. She is then taken to the Queen of Hawkworld who reveals to Shiera that she is her mother.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #8 (August 2010)</ref> Hawkgirl is tied by Hath-Set and Queen Khea to the gateway and they strike her in order to lure Hawkman to the location. Hawkman and his group of the panthera attack the Manhawks homeworld. When Hawkman arrives and draws his attention, Shiera turns the tables on Hath-Set and uses her legs to snap his neck, killing him. In the meantime, Hawkman is held by Queen Khea's control of Nth metal mace and armor, and she puts Carter with Shiera. Queen Khea opens the gateway and enters the portal to the [[Zamaron]] homeworld.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #13 (November 2010)</ref> When she arrives on the Zamaron homeworld, Star Sapphire ([[Carol Ferris]]) frees them both to stop Queen Khea's invasion. Hawkgirl soon faces her mother, but the [[Emotional spectrum|Predator]] feels the lack of love inside Khea's heart bond with her and does not know if she truly is able to contain the power of true love.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #17 (January 2011)</ref>

The Predator makes Khea his host, but Shiera and Carter manage to separate both of them by stabbing Khea at the same time with weapons made of Zamaronian crystals. The bones of the past lives of Hawkman and Hawkgirl separate from the gateway, and, animated by the power of the violet light of love, grab Khea and imprison her in the Zamaronian Central Power Battery. Shiera and Carter, with both of their missions accomplished, have their lives returned and Carol teleports both of them back to the museum of St. Roch. There, the couple, happy for finally defeating the curse, start to take off their clothes in order to make love, but they are suddenly interrupted by the apparition of [[Deadman]], brought there by his white ring. The ring gives Shiera and Carter an order that they must live separately to live life stronger (because they appreciate love more than life itself), but when Carter replies by saying they are not going to live apart again, the ring responds "So be it" and unleashes a blast of white light that turns Hawkman and Hawkgirl into white dust, while Deadman looks in horror.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #18 (January 2011)</ref> Deadman orders the ring to resurrect both Hawkman and Hawkgirl, but the ring refuses, and tells him that Hawkgirl is unique and that she was brought back life to overcome what held her back in her past life because she is essential in saving Earth.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #19 (February 2011)</ref>

When the "Dark Avatar" made his presence known, Hawkgirl and Hawkman are revealed to be part of the Elementals. They were transformed by the Entity to become the element of air and protect the Star City forest from the Dark Avatar, which appears to be the Black Lantern version of the [[Swamp Thing]].<ref>''Brightest Day'' #23 (April 2011)</ref> The Elementals are then fused with the body of Alec Holland in order for him to be transformed by the Entity into the new Swamp Thing and battle against the Dark Avatar. After the Dark Avatar is defeated, Swamp Thing appears to have brought the Elementals back to normal; however, as Hawkman looks around for Shiera, he discovers that she was not brought back like he was. He is later told by Swamp Thing that Shiera is everywhere, revealing that she's still the elemental of air. Afterward, Hawkman returns home yelling "Shiera".<ref>''Brightest Day'' #24 (April 2011)</ref>

===The New 52===
[[File:Earth 2 Vol 1 4 Textless.jpg|thumb|Hawkgirl on the cover of ''[[Earth-Two|Earth 2]]'' #4 (October, 2012). Art by [[Ivan Reis]].]]
In 2011, [[DC Comics]] rebooted its continuity as part of the publishing event "[[The New 52]]". Following this, a reimagined Kendra Saunders version of Hawkgirl features in the comic book ''[[Earth-Two|Earth 2]]'', set in the parallel reality of that designation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=38543 |title=EXCLUSIVE: "Earth 2" #4 Cover Introduces Hawkgirl |publisher=Comic Book Resources |date= |accessdate=2015-03-30}}</ref>  Her full origin has not been revealed other than some insinuation of her background as part of a secret program that included [[Al Pratt (comics)|Al Pratt]].<ref>''Earth 2'' #6 (January 2013)</ref> It is later revealed that Kendra Munoz-Saunders is a professional treasure hunter, and was hired by the World Army before an unrevealed event occurred in Egypt that resulted in the grafting of wings to Kendra's back, the same time [[Doctor Fate#Khalid Ben-Hassin|Khalid Ben-Hassin]] found the Helmet of Fate.

Some time later, Kendra met with [[the Flash]] in Europe. She was guided by a certain Fate as to where she might find him. Together, they went to Washington, D.C. and fought [[Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]], without much success.<ref>''Earth 2'' #4 (October 2012)</ref> They were later joined by Green Lantern, and subsequently by the Atom. To defeat Grundy, [[Green Lantern]] carried him out of the Earth's atmosphere, and stranded him on the moon.<ref>''Earth 2'' #5 (December 2012)</ref>

Despite his help against Grundy, the Atom, under orders from the World Army, tried to capture Hawkgirl, but she escaped with the help of the Flash. Green Lantern then returned to Earth after removing the danger of the nuclear missiles that the World Army launched under the advice of [[Mister Terrific (Terry Sloane)|Terry Sloan]]. Unfortunately, he had run out of power, after using so much of it to defeat Grundy. He was saved by Hawkgirl, who caught him in mid-free fall.<ref>''Earth 2'' #7 (February 2013)</ref>

Hawkgirl then visited the apartment of Alan Scott who was still mourning over the death of his partner Sam. Hawkgirl's detective skills allowed her to discover that Alan and Green Lantern were one and the same. She tried to convince him to join she and the Flash to form a team against the coming danger.<ref>''Earth 2'' #7 (February 2013)</ref> Since then, Hawkgirl alongside [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|the Flash]], [[Alan Scott|Green Lantern]] and [[Doctor Fate#Khalid Ben-Hassin|Doctor Fate]] formed the [[Justice Society of America|Wonders of the World]].

During the events of ''The Tower of Fate'' Hawkgirl is seen New Orleans trying to make Khalid join her in an attempt to fight against the war with [[Apokolips]], later she is shown in Louisiana locating a parademon cell, Green Lantern appears and asks for her help with finding why his husband was murdered. Together with Kendra, Alan manages to learn much more about Sam, and within the span of a few hours the treasure huntress has completely outclassed all of the detectives earlier hired by Mr. Zhao. They're flying above the Chinese harbor when Kendra notes that they've reached the point where there was supposed to be a clue, as one of the containers contain something which is connected to Sam's death. Once they open the container however, Alan and Kendra discover to their shock numerous dead [[Parademons]] heaped atop one another. Surprised by their findings and wondering how this got Sam killed, they decide to backtrack to their previous source, the mob leader Eddie Kai.

Unfortunately, before they can continue their search [[the Green (comics)|the Green]] reaches out to Alan and implores him to return to America. While Alan resists as much as he can, the force of the command proves too irresistible and he's forced to leave Kendra behind despite her protests, when he leaves however he begs Kendra to keep looking in his place. Still helping Alan with his problem, Hawkgirl is seen in a graveyard searching for answers, there she is attacked by genetically enhanced Apokorats ridden by Apokolips warriors, [[Dr. Thomas Wayne|Batman]] assists her and tells her to go search for Kanto, the assassin of Apokolips. She finds out that Alan's dead husband, was mixed up with Apokolips battle tech.<ref>Earth 2 #13 (August 2013)</ref>

When the second invasion of Apokolips in Earth-2 happened, the Wonders of the World, tried to save Earth-2 from destruction, unsuccessfully, they had to evacuate to an Earth twin, only two million survived the war.<ref>Earth 2 #32 (May 2015)</ref> In 2015, the follow-on series called ''Earth 2: Society'' showed the survivors of Earth-2's war with Apokolips, such as Hawkgirl, Green Lantern and The Flash, finding themselves on a new world having to create a fresh life there.<ref>Earth 2: Society #1 (August 2015)</ref>

In stories set on DC's Prime Earth, the ''Savage Hawkman'' story arc "Hawkman Wanted" (''Savage Hawkman'' issues 13, 14, 15 and 16, and optionally issues 0 and 12) explains the character's place in the New 52. Shayera Thal is revealed as the princess of Thanagar, former lover of [[Katar Hol]] and sister of the Emperor Corsar. Initially, she is depicted as a villain, seeking revenge against Katar and coming to Earth to bring Katar to justice for his crimes against [[Thanagar]] and the murder of Corsar. It is later evident that Katar was innocent and Shayera is surprised when she discovers her brother alive and behind Katar's arrest in the attempt to part Katar from the [[Nth metal]] and own it for himself. She then sacrifices herself in order to save Katar's life.<ref>Savage Hawkman #16</ref>

Following DC's ''[[Convergence (comics)|Convergence]]'' storyline, [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] version of Hawkgirl is featured in a [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Pre-Crisis]] universe. With the story keeping place right after the events of the acclaimed ''[[Hawkman (Katar Hol)|Shadow of War]]'' mini-series, [[Hawkman (Katar Hol)|Hawkman]] and [[Shayera Hol|Hawkgirl]] have been captured inside a domed [[Gotham City]].<ref>''Hawkman:
 Convergence'' #1 (June 2015)</ref> They are featured working as curators in the city's museum, while also fighting crime against hidden [[Thanagarians]] that had the original intent of conquest over the [[DC Multiverse|Earth]], admitting later that they abandoned it when the dome came down. One of the rogues explains that they have seen the future, and that their universe will not survive. Hawkman and Hawkgirl watch as their world starts collapsing due to the Crisis, but they also realize that there might be a new beginning and they fly off with hope in their hearts.<ref>''Hawkman: Convergence'' #2 (July 2015)</ref>

===DC Rebirth===
In March 2016, [[DC Comics]] developed [[DC Rebirth]], as a relaunch of its entire [[line (comics)|line]] of ongoing monthly superhero [[American comic books|comic books]]. Using the end of [[The New 52]] initiative in May 2016 as its launching point, DC Rebirth restored the [[DC Universe]] to a form much like that prior to the "[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]" storyline while still incorporating numerous elements of The New 52, including its continuity.

Following this, Hawkgirl, as Shiera Hall, made her first appearance in ''Dark Days: The Forge'' and ''Dark Days: The Casting'', which served as a prelude to ''[[Dark Nights: Metal]]''.

In ''[[Dark Nights: Metal|Dark Days: The Forge]]'' , Shiera is introduced as Carter's princess through his journal. Shiera and Carter are in Egypt where they discover a falling [[Thanagarian]] spaceship filled with Nth Metal, which Carter describes as ''one of the greatest mysteries of mankind''. The [[Nth Metal]] they discovered in the ship gave Carter, Shiera, and their mortal enemy [[Hath-Set]] eternal life, sending them into an eternal cycle of reincarnation. Thanks to this, Carter and Shiera decided to be heroes fighting together as [[Hawkman]] and Hawkgirl, with the powers that were granted to them thanks to the exposure of Nth Metal.<ref>Dark Days: The Forge(June 2017)</ref>

''[[Dark Nights: Metal|Dark Days: The Casting]]'' shows Hawkgirl in the first decades of the 20th century, where she is an archaeologist alongside her husband in St. Roch. They have an encounter with the ''13 Immortals'', during this the Hawks tells them what they knew about from their previous reincarnations, that I didn't started in Egypt, that they began generations earlier and Hath-Set only obscured their past lives and the true meaning of the metal they wore. The ''13 Immortals'' assisted them by sending them to various locations around the world that would tell the same story involving the metal, that the metal was cursed. Hawkgirl and Hawkman recruited adventurers to help them solve this mystery, the [[Blackhawk (DC Comics)|Blackhawks]].
During some investigations they found the [[Shazam (wizard)|Wizard's knife]], using the power of the knife, they decided to follow deep in the darkness that surrounded the mystery. The power of the Wizard's knife was so tremendous that caused an earthquake around Challengers Mountain. As a result, the search space they built to uncover the mystery was destroyed and right in front of them they saw a great evil, eyes that were waiting in the dark, as described by [[Hawkman]] in his journal.<ref>Dark Days: The Casting(July 2017)</ref>

Kendra Saunders made her DC Rebirth debut in ''[[Dark Nights: Metal]] #1'', she is now called [[Lady Blackhawk]] and is the leader of the current Blackhawks, an anti apocalyptic team. She first appears when the [[Justice League]] finds a bunker in a recently destroyed location in [[Gotham City]], she introduces herself to them and warns them of an upcoming full-scale invasion, she asks the Justice League to follow her to the [[Blackhawk (DC Comics)|Blackhawk Island]].

There she explains hers and Hawkman's origin, showing them the last piece of pure Nth Metal, Kendra tells them the powers that the metal can give, she also exposes a map of the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]] saying that what they thought was the back of the map is actually a dark multiverse filled with dark energy that cannot be seen or felt. During the age of stone there were three great tribes of man: Wolf, Bear and Bird. They shared a dream of discovery and were nomadic.
But then a fourth tribe rose, a dark tribe and with its terrible rise so began the age of metal, Kendra talks about this tribe from a Dark Multiverse and how a great beast called Barbatos, was an enemy of the Bird tribe that Hawkman and Hawkgirl were part of. She then reveals that [[Batman]] is the human doorway through which Barbatos can come to this Earth. Due to this Kendra apologizes to Batman and says that she must prevent this from happening, since she destroyed her wings and devoted her life to ending Nth Metal, and attempts to trap him. However, [[Red Tornado]], one of Hawkman's assistance in the search of the Dark Multiverse is reactivated, causing a major distraction enabling Batman to escape with the last piece of Nth Metal, leaving the [[Justice League]] and Kendra to deal with an uncontrolled Red Tornado.<ref>Dark Nights: Metal #1 (August 2017)</ref>
[[File:Lady_Blackhawk.png|thumb|220x220px|Kendra Saunders as [[Lady Blackhawk]] in [[Dark Nights: Metal|Dark Nights: Metal]].]]
Some time after, Kendra is seen in the Antarctic lava pits located in Finisterre. She goes there to join in a secret meeting formed by the Immortals, a group of the oldest beings of Earth, with many of them descending from the original tribes, such as [[Vandal Savage]], [[Morgaine Le Fey (DC Comics)|Morgaine Le Fey]], [[Ra's Al Ghul]]. As the latest reincarnation of Hawkgirl, Kendra reluctantly associates with Savage, she warns him that the Dark Multiverse arrival is imminent, since Batman is gone missing with the last piece of [[nth metal|Nth Metal]] and [[Doctor Fate]] started having visions, she also claims that she is interested in contacting with [[Plastic Man]], considering he may be the key to understand what is happening. Savage says that they must use their ultimate option to save Earth, the [[Anti-Monitor]] astral brain, capable of destroying the Dark Multiverse, with Kendra being the one chosen to fire the weapon. Even though Kendra tries to dissuade them on finding other options, Savage declares that the Immortals choice is final, during the meeting she discovers that [[Batman]] is in what he believes to be the tomb of prince [[Hawkman|Khufu]], Kendra attempts to tell him that she destroyed his tomb years ago, revealing that Batman is actually in [[Hath-Set|Hath-Set's]] tomb, set up to fall in a trap, he is captured by members of the ''[[Court of Owls]]'', using him they open the door to the Dark Multiverse, bringing all of his nightmares to Earth.<ref>Dark Nights: Metal #2 (September 2017)</ref>

Seven days after the ''[[Dark Knight Universe|Dark Nights]]'' invasion on [[Earth-0|Earth]], Kendra is seen at the ''[[Oblivion Bar]]'', one of the only safe places left in the universe, gathered with a few surviving [[Justice League|heroes]]. In order to stop ''[[Dark Knight Universe|Barbatos]]'', the heroes decide to go after the last artifacts that can fight back against the invasion of the Dark Multiverse, [[Nth Metal]], following coordinates giving by [[Plastic Man]] the survivors divide themselves in groups, with Kendra teaming-up with [[Wonder Woman]] and [[Doctor Fate]] as they go to the center of the multiverse that lies at the [[Rock of Eternity]].<ref>Dark Nights: Metal #3 (October 2017)</ref> Arriving at the [[Rock of Eternity]], Kendra follows the mission given by the Immortals and attempts to use the [[Anti-Monitor]] astral brain, but is interrupted by ''[[Dark Knight Universe|Barbatos]]'' who transforms her in a evil dark hawk, called [[Lady Blackhawk]].<ref>Dark Knights: Metal #4 (December 2017)</ref> 

Hawkgirl is also going to be featured in the one-shot ''Hawkman Found'', a Tie-In comic to ''[[Dark Nights: Metal]]''.

==Powers and abilities==
[[File:Hawkgirl-past-lives.jpeg|thumb|Some of [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Hawkman]] and Hawkgirl past lives. Art by [[Fernando Pasarin]].]]
Hawkgirl owes her powers to a belt of [[Nth metal]], a substance native to the planet [[Thanagar]] (once home of another pair of Hawk-heroes, [[Hawkman (Katar Hol)|Katar Hol]] and [[Hawkwoman]]). The metal is psycho-reactive, responding to its bearer's thoughts and in its base form has a number of electromagnetic/gravitational properties. To the Hawks, it grants the power of flight, superhuman strength, super-acute vision, and an enhanced healing/regeneration ability.

Additionally, she displays advanced hand-to-hand combat skills. Like [[Hawkman]], she retains the knowledge of several lifetimes worth of fighting. Her preferred weapons are a [[spear]] or [[mace (bludgeon)|mace]], but she has also been depicted using swords, axes, warhammers, shields, and other melee weapons. She possesses shooting skills from her times as the gunfighter, [[Cinnamon (comics)|Cinnamon]].

In addition, the [[Nth metal]] knife which murdered Hawkgirl in her original incarnation as Chay-Ara had an unusual effect upon her soul and that of her lover Khufu ([[Hawkman]]). The pair are locked in a seemingly endless cycle of death and rebirth throughout the centuries. While not a superhuman power per se, this propensity for reincarnation has allowed Hawkgirl to cheat death and return to active duty in her current incarnation.

Like all modern Thanagarians, [[Shayera Hol]] has a pair of wings growing from her back which allowes her to fly. As a Thanagarian, she has considerable physical strength, endurance and durability.
As a former member of the [[Thanagarian]] military, she had extensive training in tactics, military science, and personal combat skills. Additionally, her focus in espionage can make her a difficult opponent to track, and provides her with an advantage when tracking villains.

Hawkgirl carries a mace made of [[Nth metal]], which can generate electric currents and repel magical energies, her mace is highly effective against magic, as shown when Hawkgirl defeated [[Doctor Fate]], a powerful [[Magician (fantasy)|magician]] of the [[DC Universe]]. Hawkgirl is skilled at wielding and throwing the mace accurately. She has creatively used the mace as a shield to deflect incoming projectiles as well as a makeshift defibrillator unit.

Hawkgirl is fluent in many Earth languages, through the use of the [[Thanagar|Absorbascon]]. Her unique Thanagarian physiology also enables her to verbally communicate with birds.<ref>''Hawkman Vol. 1'' #3 (August 1964)</ref>

The [[Nth metal]] also regulates the body temperature of the wearer, preventing the need for heavy protective clothing while in high altitudes. It also has the property of radiating heat, which can be controlled to warm the wearer in colder climates.<ref>''Flash Comics'' #18 (June 1941).</ref>

Recently, Kendra has discovered that she had enhanced healing, strength, vision and limited hover abilities when not wearing Nth metal. She speculates that this is due to her prolonged exposure to the substance. It remains to be seen if she still possesses these abilities now that she is Shiera Hall once again.<ref>''HawkGirl'' #58 (January 2007)</ref>

==Other versions==

===''Flashpoint''===

Later, when the Furies attack [[Grifter (comics)|Grifter]] and the Resistance, Hawkgirl pins Grifter down, but he pulls Hawkgirl down and then stabs her chest with a trench knife.<ref>''Flashpoint: Lois Lane and the Resistance'' #2 (July 2011)</ref>

As Hawkgirl, she uses a jetpack rather than fly with wings, though when [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]] forces her to build weapons out of ancient technology, she designs one with wings as well as a powerful mace.

Shiera grew up in an orphanage in Mexico. From a young age she had a passion for history and ancient cultures, as well as the magnificent structures that they built. She became an archaeologist and her work caught the eye of Hans Garber. He informed her of the Zambesi Amulets and the power that they possessed.<ref>http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Shiera_(DC_Bombshells)</ref>

Intrigued, Shiera goes to [[Zambesi]] to try to discover the secret of the amulets. There she met [[Vixen (comics)|Queen Mari of Zambesi]] and the two of them fell in love. Shiera stayed in Zambesi with Mari and became her personal mechanic, building gadgets to assist Mari against her enemies.

Hawkgirl discovers her true [[Thanagarian]] origins while fighting against [[Baroness Paula von Gunther]]. After connecting herself with an ancient mechanic god it's revealed to Shiera that her parents were members of the [[Wingmen of Thanagar]], they sought to warn the humans upon the intentions of [[Thanagar]] who wished to conquer the Earth; due to their actions they were captured and murdered.<ref>''DC Bombshells'' #24 (June 2017)</ref>

===''Injustice: Gods Among Us''===
In the comic book adaptation of ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'', Hawkgirl (Shiera Hall) appears as a member of Superman's Regime. She first appears to answer [[Wonder Woman]]'s call for heroes at the Watchtower. After being informed of the situation, the kidnapping of Superman's parents at the hands of [[Mirror Master]], she is one of the many heroes to agree to help locate the Rogue. She battles [[Weather Wizard]] in Central City, and is later seen waiting outside the villain's bar. Hawkgirl next appears to help Wonder Woman battle the attacking Atlanteans and [[Aquaman]]. Hawkgirl battles the forces of Atlantis as Wonder Woman orders her to rescue the people who had been knocked off the boat by Aquaman's attack. She watches Arthur's forces suddenly retreat and notices the massive tsunami fast approaching. She is the first to realize there is something behind the wave. Hawkgirl spots what she believes are mountains rising out of the water, but are in fact the massive tentacles of the Kraken Aquaman called to his aid. Hawkgirl is ensnared by one of the Kraken's tentacles and dragged underwater, slowly drowning while Wonder Woman struggles to save her. After Superman arrives and forces Aquaman to call his beast off, Hawkgirl is ordered by the Man of Steel to help the sailors while Superman and the League go to give their response to Aquaman's ultimatum. Hawkgirl removes the leader of a country from his limousine during a parade before she loses him to [[Captain Atom]]. Shocked, Shiera lets her guard down and is struck by a blast of electricity, causing her to fall to the streets below.  Collapsed, Hawkgirl sees [[Black Lightning]] and [[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]] before the latter knocks her unconscious with an arrow bolt. Hawkgirl is later seen being held in a cell in the Batcave, glaring at Batman and Catwoman as they discuss the League's reaction to her kidnapping. When [[Catwoman]] points out the League will be searching for her, Batman disagrees and the scene cuts to the Watchtower, where to many heroes shock, a second Hawkgirl is seen arriving. The true Hawkgirl has remained trapped within the Batcave while her imposter has been revealed as the Martian Manhunter, shape-shifted into her form. Exactly a week later, the [[Martian Manhunter]] is exposed thanks to Batman's son Damian, and Bruce releases Hawkgirl as promised. Shiera makes her way to the crashed Watchtower and confirms her identity by easily putting out a lit match.

Hawkgirl goes to the Hall of Justice to question [[Lex Luthor]] over whether [[Sinestro]] truly willingly gave up his ring and powers before allowing himself to be imprisoned. Luthor confirms her questions before saying he still believes Sinestro has something else to play before Sinestro responds that the Green Lanterns will soon arrive to capture Superman and that the League will need his help to stop them.Hawkgirl is next seen waiting for Superman and [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Shazam]] in Utah at the Great Salt desert, mace at the ready as she answers Shazam's question of what the Man of Steel thinks they're dealing with by replying "He thinks we're dealing with Green Lanterns." When Superman asks how she knows, she tells him she was talking with their 'guest' at the Hall of Justice. When she sees Superman staring up into the sky, she asks how many Lanterns are on the way, with Superman replying, "Too many."
After the Green Lanterns arrive in front of them and Superman and Kilowog have a brief conversation, Shiera demands to know where Hal Jordan is, and when Kilowog doesn't respond, Superman has Cyborg fire a beam down on the Green Lanterns from the Watchtower.
The Green Lanterns survive and engage the three, with Hawkgirl fighting the Green Lanterns Isamot Kol and RRU-9-2, when she sees Superman suddenly go down, calling out his name. Shortly after, Hawkgirl is defeated, her Nth Metal mace taken by Green Lantern Tomar-Re, and her unconscious body trapped in a bubble construct alongside Shazam. Before any of them can be taken to Oa, Sinestro arrives, killing [[Ch'p]]. Shiera is freed and recovers her mace before engaging Tomar-Re and Procanon Kaa in a battle until the arrival of the Sinestro Corps. Hawkgirl flies above the captured Green Lanterns, silently observing as they remove their rings in surrender and she witnesses the Sinestro Corps depart the Earth on Sinestro's orders. During the lost seven months, Hawkgirl worked alongside fellow League members Superman and Shazam as well as Lanterns Hal, John and Sinestro in toppling more 'rogue nations' to continue establishing peace across the world.

When [[Hawkman]] returns to [[Thanagar]] and does not find Hawkgirl he goes to Earth. There he tries to force Hawkgirl to leave Superman's Regime and return home, but, loyal to Superman, Shiera fights against Hawkman; after defeating him she asks him to leave or she will kill him.

===''Elsewords''===
Shayera and Katar are featured in the [[Elseworlds]] three-part series ''Legend of the Hawkman'' (2000). The story takes place in the Earth-One timeline, some time after ''The Brave and the Bold'' #34. She is shown wanting to return home to [[Thanagar]] while Katar has grown accustomed to life on Earth. Although this mini-series was never labelled as an ''Elseworlds'' project when originally published, it is now accepted as being one, with this story clearly based on the Silver Age versions of Hawkman and Hawkgirl during the pre-''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' era.

===''Legend of the Hawkman''===
Hawkgirl ([[Shayera Hol]]) and [[Hawkman]] feature in this mini-series set soon after their arrival on Earth as the duo faces an ancient menace with connections to their [[Thanagarian]] heritage. In the first chapter, ''"The Fallen One"'', Shayera has been anxious to return to [[Thanagar]], but Katar feels a responsibility to the museum, especially its upcoming extraterrestrial treasure exhibit. While [[Hawkman (Katar Hol)|Katar]] has adopted Earth as his home Shayera doesn't feel like they belong there. In [[Tibet]] a group of archaeologists discovers a [[Thanagarian]] gateway carved into a cliff side, after being informed of this [[Shayera Hol|Hawkgirl]] and [[Hawkman]] travel to the location.<ref>''Legend of the Hawkman'' #1 (July 2000)</ref>

[[Hawkman]] deciphers the writing on the gateway and it depicts the life of [[Thanagar|Thasaro]], a Thanagarian child so evil that he threatened the existence of [[Thanagar|Thanagar's]] ancient gods. The ancient gods of Aerie condemned Thasaro into a mystic urn. Shayera's ancestor was entrusted with burying the urn so no one could release Thasaro. The archeologists and Katar want to examine the gateway but [[Hawkwoman|Shayera]] insists that the gateway be left alone. [[Hawkman]] and Shayera get into a fight until Shayera flies away heartbroken because Katar cares more about archeology than her feelings. Katar's fingerprints genetically opens the gateway. Shayera hears an explosion and heads back to the site. Thasaro appears and makes the stone sentries throughout his chamber come to life. The sentries attack Hawkgirl but she manages to defeat his enforcers and finds [[Hawkman|Katar]] within Thasaro's grip. Thasaro then summons corpses like talons that rise up from the ground and pull Hawkgirl into a cavern beneath [[List of Hawkman enemies|Thasaro]]'s chamber.

Shayera's ancestor channels his aura into Shayera and gives her the edge she needs to subdue Thasaro. Thasaro is banished once again into the urn.

===''Justice League Adventures''===
''[[Justice League Adventures]]'' is a [[DC Comics|DC]] comic book series featuring the Justice League, but set in the continuity (and style) of the television shows ''[[Justice League Animated]]'' and ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''; as opposed to the regular DC Universe. [[Hawkwoman|Shayera Hol]] is featured in the comic, this version of Hawkgirl is really similar to the one introduced in the television show, as the comics serves as a spin-off of the series, with Hawkgirl being one of the founding members of the [[Justice League]].

===''JLA: The Nail & JLA: Another Nail''===
In ''[[JLA: The Nail]]'' and ''[[JLA: Another Nail]]'', Hawkgirl is a member of a much-hated Justice League, and remains so even after her husband's death by [[Amazo]]. In ''Another Nail'', she appears to be close friends with [[Zatanna]]. She has forgiven [[Green Arrow|Oliver Queen]] (in Amazo's body) after he admits feeling responsible for getting Katar killed. Her role as the sole Hawk with League membership is much like her animated counterpart in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' animated series.

===''Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again''===
In ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'', the Hawks tried to return to Thanagar to flee from [[Lex Luthor]]'s military dictatorship, only to crash in the rain forests of [[Costa Rica]].

Katar and Shayera were killed in a military strike ordered by Lex Luthor, embracing each other in their final moments. The children were brought up in the jungle ever since. They were bent on revenge against Lex.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fanboyplanet.com/ontv/justiceleague/mg-jluONCEANDFUTURETHING2.php |title=mg-jluONCEANDFUTURETHING2 : |publisher=Fanboplanet.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-13}}</ref> As '''Hawkboy''', the son ultimately kills Lex with Batman's permission, since he understands what he has been through.

===''Justice''===

With the entire JLA's secrets and weaknesses in hand, the [[Legion of Doom]] stages a simultaneous attack on nearly every member of the League. Hawkgirl and [[Hawkman]] are surprised by [[Toyman#Winslow Schott|Toyman]] in the [[Midway City|Midway City Museum]], but manage to survive and decide to investigate his warehouse, where they are assaulted by his forces, and discover that he is making multiple [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]] androids. She also appears in ''Secret Origins'' and ''Liberty and Justice''.

===''Gotham City Garage''===
Hawkgirl is set to appear in the new comic series called ''Gotham City Garage''. Kendra Saunders is shown briefly in Episode #2. She is the youngest member of a very old team. This new series is inspired by the DC Collectibles statue line.

===''DC New Talents Showcase''===
Hawkgirl was chosen for one of the seven features in the one-shot comic book. She lives in Chicago, working as a police detective. She is from [[Thanagar]], her mace vibrates like a smartphone when [[Nth metal|Nth-Metal]] Thanagarian weapons are near and she has a secret Hawkroom. It is revealed that she did not leave Thanagar on good terms, after some time collecting Thanagarian weapons from crime scenes she started suspecting something was wrong. This led to her fighting against an ancient Thanagarian that wanted her dead since she chose humans instead of Thanagarians.

[[Erica Schultz]], said she was inspired by [[Justice League Animated]] version of the character, ''"I've always been drawn to strong characters, but what really solidified my love for Shayera was the [[Justice League]] cartoon show."'' <ref>DC New Talent Showcase ( January 2017)</ref>

===''Scooby-Doo Team-Up #17''===

==In other media==

===Television===

====''Super Friends''====
Hawkgirl has appeared in a few episodes of ''[[The All-New Super Friends Hour]]'' and ''[[Super Friends (1980)|Super Friends]]'' paired alongside her husband Hawkman. In her appearances on the show, she looked like the Silver Age version of the character. However, in her last appearance during the "lost season", Hawkgirl got a new costume (a totally black mask, a yellow one piece with a red belt, and grey boots) and her hair was changed to blonde. She was voiced by [[Shannon Farnon]] and [[Janet Waldo]].

====''Justice League'' and ''Justice League Unlimited''====
[[File:Hawkgirl.png|thumb|Hawkgirl as she appeared in ''[[Justice League Animated|Justice League]]''.]]
Hawkgirl appears in the animated series ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' and ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', voiced by [[Maria Canals-Barrera]]. She is based on [[Hawkwoman|Shayera Hol]], the Silver Age version of the character. Her personality was completely redesigned for the series by the producers, who wanted a second female superhero for the team to contrast with [[Wonder Woman]]. While [[Black Canary]] is traditionally more associated with the Justice League, the producers preferred to have the Hawk family represented. In the animated continuity, Hawkgirl's wings are organic and she wields an Nth metal mace which disrupts magical forces and other forms of energy, she is also depicted as having superhuman strength, endurance, durability and is an expert hand-to-hand combat, as shown in "In Blackest Night Part.II" when she defeated four members of the [[Green Lantern Corps]] single-handedly. It can be assumed that she also has some hover capability, as at times she is seen to hang in midair without the visible use of her wings. In the episode "Only a Dream Pt. 1" she is seen hovering with [[Copperhead (DC Comics)|Copperhead]] clinging to her back.

In "Secret Origins", the [[Martian Manhunter]] gathers the future League to battle against an alien invasion on Earth. After the defeat of the invasion, the seven remained a team and officially formed the Justice League, dedicated to the defense of Earth against attack both within and without. To the rest of the League, Shayera was a mysterious woman with angelic wings from another world. She explained that she found herself on Earth when, while pursuing some criminals who were trafficking in forbidden technology, she was accidentally transported by the rays of a dimensional transporter known to her people as a Zeta Beam, which has been traditionally associated with DC's science fiction hero [[Adam Strange]].

Throughout the series, she slowly builds a relationship with Green Lantern ([[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]]). In the two-part episode "Wild Cards", John is nearly killed by a bomb the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] has set off while protecting Shayera. She just barely manages to bring him back to life by shocking him with her mace, then leaves the city to treat him. Later, in the Watchtower, John and Shayera show their true feelings for each other, and Shayera allows John to remove her mask, giving the viewer their first look at Hawkgirl's face beneath the mask, and the two share a kiss.

In the second-season finale "Starcrossed", Shayera reveals herself to be a military officer of her planet's armed forces, working as an advance scout on Earth. When her people suddenly arrive in force on Earth, she works to help the Thanagarians gain the support of Earth's leaders to protect it from the Thanagarians' mortal enemies, the Gordanians. She is also reunited with her commanding officer and fiance Hro Talak (an anagram for the name of the Silver Age Hawkman Katar Hol), with both her now-revealed spy mission and this unmentioned romance creating considerable friction between herself and John. Information she has given to the Thanagarians enables them to take the League prisoner, though Shayera says they should not be killed. They later escape.

Unbeknownst to Shayera, the Thanagarians' true intent is to transform Earth into the final link in a hyperspace bypass, which will destroy Earth but allow the Thanagarians to strike a mortal blow at the Gordanians' home world. When Shayera learns of this plan, she betrays her people and informs the Justice League of the Thanagarian plot, proving this by returning John's ring which the Thanagarians had taken. The Thanagarian forces are eventually defeated by the League and forced to leave Earth, with Shayera left behind as a traitor. (For this reason, Shayera is later ambushed by a band of rogue Thanagarian resistance fighters seeking revenge in "Hunter's Moon".) The other six members of the League take a vote on whether to allow Shayera to stay on the team, but before they can tell her the result, she resigns from the League and departs (in "Wake the Dead", it is revealed that the decision, while split, was in favor of letting her stay, with John abstaining and [[Superman]] breaking the tie). She eventually comes to reside with [[Doctor Fate]] and his wife [[Inza Nelson|Inza]] in Fate's tower stronghold in an effort to decide what to do with her life.

In the episode "Wake the Dead", [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy's]] corpse is reanimated, and he wreaks havoc. Shayera takes the responsibility of killing Grundy, whom she once considered to be a friend. After this, she returns to the League, but it is some time before she is properly re-accepted among its members, particularly Wonder Woman and [[Batman]] (who were likely the two who had previously voted against her remaining on the team). After she is allowed to rejoin the [[Justice League]], Shayera reclaims her seat among the seven founding members and opts to dress in simple civilian clothing as opposed to her previous, more militaristic costume.

[[File:ShayeraJLU.png|thumb|left|Hawkgirl as she appeared in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''.]]
After returning to the [[Justice League]], Shayera found conflict with [[Wonder Woman]], the [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazon warrior]] had reluctantly allowed Shayera to join the team again, however holding a grudge against her. She would sustain that feeling until the episode "The Balance", when she was forced to take Shayera along to [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]] and Tartarus due to [[Felix Faust]]'s return and his usurping of Hades' throne, Shayera was vital to this mission because her [[Nth Metal]] mace was the only weapon capable of stopping Faust. During this mission, Shayera and Wonder Woman settled their differences once and for all. Shayera still met conflict with [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]]. Once, they, during the episode "Hunter's Moon", along with [[Vigilante (comics)|Vigilante]], were assigned to a rescue mission on a distant moon where alien miners were having problems due to the supposed high levels of unstable Nth metal. However, it turned out to be a trap set by Paran Dul, who was leading a group of [[Thanagar|Thanagarians]] soldiers including the mentally disabled Kragger. During their confrontation on the moon, Paran revealed that Shayera's betrayal had led to [[Thanagar]]'s defeat by the Gordanians and that [[Hawkman (Katar Hol)|Hro Talak]] had been killed while fighting back. A distressed Shayera was tempted to turn herself in and let them pass judgment on her, but Vixen and Vigilante refused to let her go.

Shayera even offered to surrender in exchange for Vixen who had been captured by the Thanagarians but then fought back when they almost killed Vixen by dropping her from mid-air. The Thanagarians were defeated and the three League members stole a Thanagarian Scout Ship and returned to the [[Watchtower (comics)|Watchtower]]. Upon their arrival, John Stewart rushed over to both Vixen and Shayera, but they walked straight past, implying that they were going to settle their dispute over him. Stewart feared the worse, but they merely laughed over drinks during which the two women discussed his quirks and habits. Shayera did reveal that she still loved him while Vixen revealed that he still loved Shayera and that she just wanted to see things through until the end. They agreed to a friendly contest for his affections, with a toast to en garde.

The show ends with Shayera and Green Lantern (who is by this point in a relationship with League member Vixen) having resolved to be friends for the time being. Series creator [[Bruce Timm]] said in an interview that while he was deliberately ambiguous about the future of their relationship and understood while some fans disliked where it was left at the series finale, it was his opinion that "You can put two and two together and imagine what happens",<ref>http://www.tvpast.org/forum/toons-superheroes/4007-interview-bruce-timm.html</ref> especially since Green Lantern has at this point met his future son, [[Warhawk (Batman Beyond)|Warhawk]] (Rex Stewart) who indicates that his mother is Shayera. A resolution to this storyline occurs in the fifth issue of the ''Batman Beyond Unlimited'' comic book, in which John and Shayera finally reconcile and settle down to raise a family in Africa. Though these events are not considered canonical to the [[DC Animated Universe]] storyline as the issues were created by independent writers not associated with the original production.

In addition to John, Shayera shows a strong friendship with the Flash that is touched on several times through both the ''JL'' and ''JLU'' series, usually in a sisterly way, including him being the only one to hug her goodbye after her decision to resign. She is also the first one try and pull him back from the [[Speed Force]] in the episode "Divided We Fall."  In the ''Justice League Unlimited'' fifth season's debut episode, "I Am Legion", Flash says, "She loves me. She's like the big sister I never had. Only, you know... short."

Later Hawkgirl meets archaeologist Carter Hall, who claims they are the re-incarnations of two Thanagarians, Khufu and Chay-Ara, who landed on Earth thousands of years ago, and became rulers of Egypt. The [[Shadow Thief]] captures them and Green Lantern and uses Thanagarian technology from that era to show them what happened. After Shayera had an affair with the military leader and closest friend of Katar Bashari, apparently the past John Stewart, due to her husband not spending enough time with her, they were poisoned by the Priest Hath-Set who heard Carter wish they were dead. When he found out he poisoned himself.

====''Static Shock''====
Hawkgirl appears in the ''[[Static Shock]]'' episode, "A League of Their Own", with [[Maria Canals]] reprising her role. Within the [[Justice League Watchtower|Watchtower]], [[Batman]] is checking the stasis field shielding a left-over module from [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]] from its environs. As Batman explains to Hawkgirl Brainiac's nature as a regenerative program, a virus that will not die, an alarm goes off and [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] calls everyone to the control room. As it turns out, the Watchtower is in the path of a cosmic super string, and even with the shield up, most of the power is drained from the station's generator. Brainiac manages to take advantage of this, escaping from his drained stasis field. Hawkgirl and the [[Justice League]] call in [[Static (comics)|Static]] and [[Rick Stone (comics)|Gear]] to assist in the fight against Brainiac.

====''Smallville''====
In the ''[[Smallville]]'' episode "[[Absolute Justice]]", Hawkgirl's weaponry and mask are on display at the JSA brownstone. Her hawk helmet has a crack across the right side, and Hawkman notes that she has been dead for several years. He confirms that she is his wife, Shayera Hall, and that both have been reincarnated many times through the ages. She is later featured in the second episode of the show's [[Smallville (season 10)|tenth and final season]], entitled "Shield". She appears in a brief flashback cameo while Carter Hall tells [[Lois Lane (Smallville)|Lois Lane]] about their past lives as [[Prince Khufu]] and Chay-Ara. She is portrayed by [[Sahar Biniaz]]. In the episode "Icarus", Carter Hall is killed while saving Lois from General [[Slade Wilson]] and a gas explosion in [[Oliver Queen (Smallville)|Oliver Queen]]'s office at the [[LuthorCorp]] building. Members of the show's nascent [[Justice League (Smallville)|Justice League]] lay Carter to rest in an Egyptian tomb alongside the body of Shayera.
