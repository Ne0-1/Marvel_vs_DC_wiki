The first character to use these names was a criminal who called himself "Senor Suerte" (which means "Mr. Luck" in English) in his role as head of criminal gambling operations in New York.  He used the name "Senior Muerte" (which means "Mr. Death" in English) when he killed his opponents.

Ramon had Frank Jenks killed.  He was electrocuted by his own device while battling [[Luke Cage]].<ref>''Hero For Hire'' #11</ref>

After Ramon's death, his younger brothers Jaime and Phillip took over his operations.  Jaime became "Senor Suerte" and Phillip became "Senor Muerte".  Phillip was a professional assassin and was formerly allied with the [[Tarantula (Marvel Comics)#Anton Miguel Rodriguez|Tarantula]] in an attempt to hijack the Madbombs.  Phillip wore gloves that were able to release spider venom into his victims.
