'''Frankenstein's Monster''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] based on the character in the novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'' by [[Mary Shelley]]. The character has been [[Frankenstein (comics)|adapted often]] in the [[comic book]] [[mass media|medium]]. This version is that published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
The first appearance of Frankenstein's Monster in the [[Marvel Comics Universe]] came in the five-page [[horror comics]] story "Your Name Is Frankenstein", by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Joe Maneely]] in ''Menace'' #7 (Sept. 1953),<ref>[http://www.comics.org/issue/215837/ Grand Comic-Book Database: ''Menace'' #7 (September 1953)]</ref><ref>Baron Frankenstein, though not the Monster, had appeared earlier, in the story "Horror at Haunted Castle" in ''[[Blonde Phantom]] Comics'' #14 (Summer 1947), from Marvel's 1940s predecessor, [[Timely Comics]]. [http://www.comics.org/issue/6012/#61077]</ref> from Marvel's 1950s forerunner, [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]]. The following decade, a [[robot]] replica of Frankenstein's Monster appeared as an [[antagonist]] in ''[[The X-Men]]'' #40 (Jan. 1968), by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and [[penciler]] [[Don Heck]],<ref name=gcdx40>[http://www.comics.org/issue/21601/ Grand Comic-Book Database: ''X-Men'' #40 (January 1968)]</ref> and was destroyed by the titular team of [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[superheroes]]. The actual Monster first appeared in Marvel Comics continuity in a [[cameo appearance|cameo]] [[flashback]] in "The Heir of Frankenstein" in ''[[The Silver Surfer]]'' #7 (Aug. 1969), by writer-editor Lee and penciler [[John Buscema]].<ref>[http://www.comics.org/issue/22912/#161063 Grand Comic-Book Database: ''Silver Surfer, The'' #7 (August 1969)]</ref>

The character received an ongoing series, titled ''Frankenstein'' in the postal [[indicia]] and initially ''The Monster of Frankenstein'' (issues #1-5) and later ''Frankenstein's Monster'' as the cover logo, that ran 18 issues (Jan. 1973 - Sept. 1975)<ref>{{gcdb series|id=2119|title=''Frankenstein''}}</ref><ref>{{comicbookdb|type=title|id=8463|title=''Frankenstein''}}</ref> This series began with a four-issue retelling of the original novel, by writer [[Gary Friedrich]] and artist [[Mike Ploog]]. Several more issues continued his story into the 1890s, until he was placed in [[suspended animation]] and revived in modern times.

Thomas, by this point Marvel Comics' editor-in-chief, recalled in 2009: "I'd been working with [artist] [[Dick Giordano]] adapting [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula (novel)|Dracula]]'' [in the black-and-white horror-comics magazine ''Vampire Tales'', published by Marvel sister company [[Curtis Magazines]]<nowiki>]</nowiki>, so I wanted to start with the Shelley ''Frankenstein'' [novel], then bring [Frankenstein's Monster] into the present. But eager as I was to work with Mike Ploog on ''Frankenstein'', I just didn't have the timer. So I turned the project over to Gary, who did a fine job with it".<ref>Roy Thomas interviewed in Browning, Michael. "The Monster of Frankenstein", ''Back Issue'' #36 (October 2009), p. 11</ref> Friedrich in 2009 said he did not recall "whose idea it was to do a Frankenstein book", noting that "at this time, Marvel was cranking up the gears on the monster mags", which were introducing such new characters as [[Werewolf by Night]] and [[Ghost Rider]].<ref>Gary Friedrich interviewed in Browning. p. 11</ref> Ploog based his rendition of the Monster on a drawing by [[John Romita, Sr.]], Marvel's [[art director]], who was instructed to make the character dissimilar to the familiar [[Universal Pictures]] movie version.<ref>Browning, pp. 11-12</ref>

Ploog drew the first six issues, self-[[inker|inked]] except for issues #4-5, which were embellished by Marvel [[production manager]] and occasional inker [[John Verpoorten]]. The following four issues were penciled by John Buscema. After a final Friedrich-written issue, drawn by [[Bob Brown (comics)|Bob Brown]], the creative team of writer [[Doug Moench]] and penciler [Val Mayerik]] brought the Monster from the 19th century to the present day, beginning with issue #12 (Sept. 1974). The duo continued through the final issue, with [[Bill Mantlo]] rather than Moench writing the finale.<ref>[http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/frankst.htm#S927 The Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators: ''Frankenstein • The Monster of Frankenstein • The Frankenstein Monster'' (1973-1975)]</ref>

Ploog had departed, Thomas recalled, because "Marvel was in a great surge of growth at that time, which resulted in frequent changes on artist/writer lineups on many, if not most of the titles. Mike was quite busy then".<ref>Thomas in Browning, p. 13</ref> Ploog recalled disliking the planned change to bring the Monster into the present-day Marvel Universe. "I couldn't see Frankenstein battling with [[Spider-Man]] on [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]]".<ref>Mike Ploog interviewed in Browning, p. 13</ref> His successor, Buscema, was an established veteran and one of Marvel's premier artists. Friedrich said, "Working with Buscema [on the series] was a wonderful experience. John could draw about any type [of] book you could imagine. ... We never had a disagreement about anything, and his storytelling sense was superb".<ref>Friedrich in Browning, p. 13</ref> The series ended "because sales weren't good enough", Thomas recalled. "At the start, the book [had] sold well".<ref>Thomas in Browning, p. 14</ref>

Concurrent with the color-comics series, the character appeared in his own modern-day feature in two of Curtis' black-and-white horror-comics magazines: ''[[Monsters Unleashed]]'' #2, 4-10 (Sept. 1973, Feb. 1975 - Feb. 1975), by the Friedrich/Buscema team initially, followed by the Moench/Mayerik team; and in ''Legion of Monsters'' #1 (Sept. 1975), by Moench and Mayerik.

During the 1970s, the Monster guest-starred in the [[superhero]] titles ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' #131-132 (Jan.-Feb. 1975); ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #36-37 (Aug.-Sept. 1975), appearing in the latter series opposite [[Spider-Man]]; and ''[[Iron Man]]'' #101-102 (Aug.-Sept. 1977); and in the supernatural title ''[[Tomb of Dracula]]'' #49 (Oct. 1976). As well, writer John Warner and artist [[Dino Castrillo]] adapted the Shelley novel in ''[[Marvel Classics Comics]]'' #20 (1977), in a 48-page story outside mainstream Marvel continuity. The character made only two Marvel appearances in the 1980s.<ref>''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #274 (Jan. 1985), continued in the spin-off title ''[[Ben Grimm|The Thng]]'' #19 (Jan. 1985)</ref> The first four issues of ''The Monster of Frankenstein'' were reprinted in the [[miniseries]]  ''[[Book of the Dead (comics)|Book of the Dead]]'' #1-4 (Dec. 1993 - March 1994). Also that decade, he again confronted Spider-Man in ''Spider-Man Unlimited'' #21 (Aug. 1998).

In the 21st century, the Monster appeared prominently in the four-issue miniseries ''[[Elsa Bloodstone|Bloodstone]]'' (Dec. 2001 - March 2002), and starred in a 14-page story, "To Be a Monster" by writer-artist [[Skottie Young]]'' in ''Legion of Monsters: Werewolf by Night'' #1 (April 2007).

==Fictional character biography==
Frankenstein's Monster was built from human corpses by a scientist named Victor Frankenstein, in Ingolstadt, Bavaria, in the late 1700s.  His efforts to fit in with regular humanity were futile due to his horrific form, and he was infuriated.  Victor Frankenstein created and subsequently killed a mate for the Monster, who killed Frankenstein's bride Elizabeth in retaliation. After killing several people, the Monster fled to the Arctic.  His creator pursued him, but died due to the cold.  The Monster, anguished, tried to kill himself but only went into a state of suspended animation from the cold.<ref>The Monster related these events to 19th Century Captain Robert Walton in ''The Monster of Frankenstein'' #1-3</ref>

In the 1890s, heat revived the Monster and he wandered again. He searched for the descendant of Victor Frankenstein and finally ended up in Transylvania. The Monster clashed with [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]], and his vocal cords were injured.  Vincent Frankenstein finally found him and tried to give him a new brain, dying in the process—shot by an angry maidservant before the Monster could kill him.  Frustrated, the Monster returned to a state of suspended animation.<ref>''The Frankenstein Monster'' #8-9</ref>

The Monster eventually emerged from suspended animation in a glacier to the modern world.<ref>''Monsters Unleashed'' #2</ref> He was aided by [[Victoria Frankenstein]], a distant relative of his creator.  This woman was kindly, and repaired his vocal cords.<ref>''The Frankenstein Monster'' #16</ref>  The Monster joined Victoria Von Frankenstein and her mutant charges, the [[The Children (Marvel Comics)|Children of the Damned]], beings who were mutated by Basil and Ludwig Von Frankenstein's failed human experiments.<ref>''The Frankenstein Monster'' #18</ref> The Monster allied with [[Spider-Man]] against the Monster Maker, Baron Von Shtupf and his pawn the Man-Wolf.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #35-36</ref>

Victoria discovered the man who would become the [[Dreadknight]] while he was dying in the wilderness.  While under her care, he gained a variety of weapons and took possession of the flying mutant horse employed by the original, criminal [[Black Knight (Nathan Garrett)|Black Knight]]. He attempted to force more resources from Victoria and attacked the new Castle Frankenstein, but was defeated by the Monster and [[Iron Man]] and the Children.<ref>''Iron Man'' #101-102</ref> The Dreadknight, left a wounded shell at the finale of the battle, was returned to Victoria's custody though he later escaped with his steed and personal weaponry.

The Monster later departed from Victoria's company.<ref>As related in ''Doctor Strange'' Vol. 2 #37</ref>

[[Ulysses Bloodstone]] later befriended the Monster, who came to occasionally stay at his mansion, eventually acting as its caretaker. The Monster, sometimes using the name Adam, accompanied Bloodstone on missions. Bloodstone trusted Adam to give his daughter [[Elsa Bloodstone|Elsa]] a fragment of the Bloodgem in the Bloodstone choker when she was old enough.

When exploring Bloodstone House, an adult Elsa discovers a secret chamber in which she encounters Adam who tells Elsa about her father. Adam gives her the Bloodstone Choker, which attaches itself to her neck. Adam later designs a costume for Elsa, patterned after her father's. The two have a number of adventures together, encountering beings such as Dracula and [[N'Kantu, the Living Mummy]]. Elsa lives in Bloodstone Manor with her mother and ally Adam the Frankenstein Monster, while pursuing a monster-hunting occupation.<ref>''[[Elsa Bloodstone|Bloodstone]]'' #1-4</ref>

At some point, an intelligent clone of the monster, simply named [[Clone of Frankenstein|Frankenstein]], was created. The clone became a member of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s Paranormal Containment Unit, nicknamed the [[Nick Fury's Howling Commandos|Howling Commandos]].<ref>''Nick Fury's Howling Commandos'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Frankenstein Monster is a result of a biological experiment by Baron Victor Frankenstein which grafted pieces of various corpses together which were animated through an undisclosed procedure involving electricity. The Monster has [[superhuman strength]] and stamina, and can be placed in suspended animation when exposed to intense cold without suffering any physical damage.

==Other versions==
In ''[[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]]'' #31 (Aug. 1978), Dr. Basil Frankenstein creates a similar creature for Nazi Germany, but this creature destroys itself. An intelligent [[clone]] of the Monster was a member of the Paranormal Containment Unit of the international law-enforcement agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] in issues of the series ''[[Nick Fury's Howling Commandos]]''.<ref>Browning, p. 14</ref>
