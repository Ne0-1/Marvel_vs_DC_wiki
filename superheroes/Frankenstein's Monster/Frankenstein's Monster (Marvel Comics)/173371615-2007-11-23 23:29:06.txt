'''Frankenstein’s Monster''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]].  He is based on the character from the novel [[Frankenstein]], by [[Mary Shelley]].

==Publication history==
In [[X-Men]] #40 (Jan 1968), an android version of the Monster appeared, and was destroyed by the X-Men.  

The Monster first appeared in Marvel Comics continuity in a cameo in Silver Surfer #7 (Aug 1969).  

He later appeared a number of times throughout the 1970s, and received a full series of his own beginning in January 1973, entitled '''Monster of Frankenstein'''.  This series began with a 4-issue retelling of the original novel, by [[Gary Friedrich]] and [[Mike Ploog#Marvel Comics|Mike Ploog]].  Several more issues continued his story into the 1890s, until he was placed in suspended animation and revived in modern times.

In [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]] #31 (Aug 1978), Dr. Basil Frankenstein created a similar creature for Nazi Germany, but this creature destroyed itself.

==Fictional character biography==
Frankenstein’s Monster was built from human corpses by a scientist named Victor Frankenstein, in Bavaria, in the late 1700s.  His efforts to fit in with regular humanity were futile due to his horrific form, and he was infuriated.  After killing several people, the Monster fled to the Arctic.  His creator pursued him, but died due to the cold.  The Monster, anguished, tried to kill himself but only went into a state of suspended animation from the cold.

In the 1890s, heat revived the Monster and he wandered again.  The Monster clashed with [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]], and his vocal cords were injured.  Frustrated, he returned to a state of suspended animation.

The Monster was revived again in modern times by [[Victoria Frankenstein]], a distant relative of his creator.  This woman was kindly, and repaired his vocal cords.  Victoria discovered the man who would become the [[Dreadknight]] while dying in the wilderness.  While under her care, he gained a variety of weapons and took possession of the flying mutant horse employed by the original, criminal [[Black Knight (Nathan Garrett)|Black Knight]]. He attempted to force more resources from Victoria, but was defeated by the Monster and [[Iron Man]] and Victoria's mutant charges, [[The Children (Marvel Comics)|The Children]]. The Dreadknight, left a wounded shell at the finale of the battle, was returned to Victoria's custody though he later escaped with his steed and personal weaponry.

[[Bloodstone (comics)|Bloodstone]] later befriended the Monster, who came to occasionally stay at his mansion, eventually acting as its caretaker. The Monster, sometimes using the name Adam, sometimes accompanied Bloodstone on missions. Bloodstone trusted Adam to give his daughter [[Elsa Bloodstone|Elsa]] a fragment of the Bloodgem in the Bloodstone choker when she was old enough.

When exploring '''Bloodstone House''', an adult Elsa discovers a secret chamber in which she encounters Adam who tells Elsa about her father. Adam gives her the Bloodstone Choker, which attaches itself to her neck. Adam later designs a costume for Elsa, patterned after her father's. The two have a number of adventures together, encountering beings such as [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]] and [[N'Kantu, the Living Mummy]]. Elsa lives in Bloodstone Manor with her mother and ally Adam the Frankenstein Monster, while pursuing a monster-hunting occupation.

At some point, an intelligent clone of the monster, simply named '''[[Clone of Frankenstein|Frankenstein]]''', was created.  The clone became a member of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s Paranormal Containment Unit, nicknamed the [[Nick Fury's Howling Commandos|Howling Commandos]].
