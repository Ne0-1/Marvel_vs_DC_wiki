'''Lady Lotus''' is a [[fictional character]] from [[Marvel Comics]]. She first appeared in ''[[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]]'' <!-- only denote volume number after first --> #37 (February 1979).

==Fictional character biography==
Lady Lotus was a [[Imperial Japan|Japanese]] agent during [[World War II]] who possessed strong [[psychic]] powers, including [[telepathy]], [[clairvoyance]], [[precognition]], and a form of hypnotic [[mind control]]. She posed as a shopkeeper in [[Chinatown]], [[New York]], where she used her powers to gather up several anti-American agents (including [[U-Man]]) to form a group called the [[Super-Axis]]. She also mind-controlled the [[Human Torch (Golden Age)|Human Torch]] into briefly joining forces with them, but he soon regained his senses and turned against her, disrupting her concentration and thus freeing her mind-slaves.

Lady Lotus has not made any further appearances since that time; her present status is unknown. It was implied that the villain [[U-Man]] raped her to get revenge for his enslavement, and that their daughter is [[Nia Noble]], but these things have not been confirmed.

==Powers and abilities==
Lady Lotus possesses the ability to hypnotise others from miles away, forcing them to obey her will. She can cast mental illusions and has limited precognitive powers.
