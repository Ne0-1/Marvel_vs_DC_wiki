'''Ruckus''' ('''Clement Wilson''') is a fictional [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] super villain in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe and flamboyant leader of the [[Nasty Boys]].

==Fictional character biography==
Given Ruckus's ability to absorb the [[sound waves]] around him and send them back with concussive force by screaming, [[Mister Sinister]] favored Ruckus and often kept him in reserve.  Unfortunately, Ruckus' youth makes him arrogant, as seen when he and his comrade, [[Ramrod (comics)|Ramrod]], robbed a convenience store and obliterated a group of police officers.  The act did not go unpunished, and when returning to base, Ruckus was put in his place.  While working with a renegade [[Multiple Man|Madrox]] dupe, Ruckus was put in direct conflict with the mutant group [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]].  Flying in a hovercraft, he went after [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]], using the sound of a firecracker to amplify and literally rock her world.  Polaris was eventually able to take him out, but he escaped with teammate [[Gorgeous George (comics)|Gorgeous George]].{{issue|date=December 2012}}

He appeared much later, along with the rest of the Nasty Boys, on a mission to stop [[Malice (comics)#Malice|Malice]] who had inhabited [[Havok (comics)|Havok]]'s body. During the battle, Ruckus was the first to strike, using his power to catch Malice off guard.  Eventually, X-Factor joined the battle and Ruckus was taken out by [[Strong Guy]].  After the battle, Mr. Sinister grabbed his Nasty Boys and fled.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Ruckus was eventually hired by [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] to assassinate [[Senator Kelly]], but failed to when the [[X-Men]] showed up.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Ruckus retained his mutant powers after the [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], but eventually grew disillusioned with being a mutant and ashamed at all the evil deeds he had done. He then came to the San Francisco Institute of Bio-Social Studies who had developed a mutant cure, one which caused irreparable brain damage to any that take it. Ruckus voluntarily took the cure on camera, losing his powers like he wanted, but forced to live the life of an invalid afterward.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' vol. 2 #11</ref>

Later, Ruckus had somehow recovered from his injuries and was caught attempting to rob a bank in England with his former teammate Ramrod. He and Ramrod were taken into custody. However, when a cloud of [[Terrigen Mist]] threatened the lives of the two mutants in the British prison, [[Storm (comics)|Storm]] sent the X-Men to rescue the pair. [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] easily found Ruckus inside his cell, but the trio had to fight their way through a prison riot to find Ramrod. Ruckus escaped with Ramrod and the X-Men to X-Haven, their base of operations. The X-Men placed Ruckus and Ramrod in prison cells to serve out the rest of their sentences.<ref>''Extraordinary X-Men Annual'' #1 (2016)</ref>
