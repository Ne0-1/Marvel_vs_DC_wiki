'''Ruckus''' ('''Clement Wilson''') is a fictional [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] super villain in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe and flamboyant leader of the [[Nasty Boys]].  

==Fictional character biography==
With the ability to absorb the [[sound waves]] around him and send them back with concussive force by screaming, [[Mister Sinister|Mr. Sinister]] favored Ruckus and often kept him in reserve.  Unfortunately, Ruckus' youth makes him arrogant, as seen when he and his comrade, [[Ramrod (comics)|Ramrod]], robbed a convenience store and obliterated a group of police officers.  The act did not go unpunished, and when returning to base, Ruckus was put in his place.  While working with a renegade [[Multiple Man|Madrox]] dupe, Ruckus was put in direct conflict with the mutant group [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]].  Flying in a hovercraft, he went after [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]], using the sound of a firecracker to amplify and literally rock her world.  Polaris was eventually able to take him out, but he escaped with teammate [[Gorgeous George (comics)|Gorgeous George]].

He appeared much later, along with the rest of the Nasty Boys, on a mission to stop [[Malice]] who had inhabited [[Havok (X-Men)|Havok's]] body.  During the battle, Ruckus was the first to strike, using his power to catch Malice off guard.  Eventually, X-Factor joined the battle and Ruckus was taken out by [[Strong Guy]].  After the battle, Mr. Sinister grabbed his Nasty Boys and fled.

A skrull duplicate of Ruckus was eventually hired by [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] to assassinate [[Senator Kelly]], but failed to when the [[X-Men]] showed up.  His current whereabouts are unknown, and whether or not he still serves Mr. Sinister remains a mystery. It is unknown if Ruckus retained his mutant powers after the [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].

==Powers and abilities==
Ruckus has the ability to absorb the sound waves around him and send them back with concussive force using his vocal cords. 

==Other versions==
===What If?===
Ruckus appeared in a ''[[What If? (comics)|What if?]]'' storyline where [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] took over the [[United States of America]].  He was eventually killed by [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] along with the other Nasty Boys.

==In other media==
===Television===
====X-Men Animated Series====
Ruckus played a prominent role in the [[X-Men Animated Series]], as leader of the Nasty Boys.  He seemed to be older, but the others often cracked jokes at him being Sinister's "lapdog." He was played by [[Dan Hennessey]], who was also the voice director for the show.  He also appeared in several issues of ''X-Men Adventures'', a comic book based on the animated series.
