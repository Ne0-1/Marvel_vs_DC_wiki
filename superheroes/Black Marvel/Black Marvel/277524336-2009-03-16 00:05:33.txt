'''The Black Marvel''' ('''Daniel Lyons''') is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[comic book]] [[superhero]]  in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel universe|universe]]. Created by writer [[Stan Lee]]<ref name="lee">[http://www.lambiek.net/artists/l/lee_s.htm Lambiek Comiclopedia: Stan Lee]</ref> and artist [[Al Gabriele]],<ref>[http://comics.org/details.lasso?id=1315#1 Grand Comics Database: ''Mystic Comics'' #5]</ref> he [[first appeared]] in ''[[Mystic Comics]]'' #5 (March 1941), published by Marvel's 1940s forerunner [[Timely Comics]] during the period fans and historians call the [[Golden Age of comic books]].

==Publication history==
The Black Marvel &mdash; one of the first creations of future Marvel editor-in-chief and publisher [[Stan Lee]] &mdash; appeared in the multi-character omnibus title ''Mystic Comics'' #5-9 (March 1941 - May 1942). His first-appearance [[origin story]] was reprinted in ''[[Marvel Super-Heroes (comics)|Marvel Super-Heroes]]'' #15 (July 1968).

The character also starred in a story in ''[[All Winners Comics]]'' <!--no hyphen per cover logo--> #1 (Summer 1941), the cover of which was reprinted in ''Giant-Size Invaders'' vol. 2, #2 (Dec. 2005).

==Fictional character biography==
He was chosen by a "Black Feet" ([[sic]]) Indian chief (not specifically tied to the real-life [[Blackfoot]] tribe) to be a champion of justice, after besting 100 challengers by outrunning a deer, outswimming a salmon upstream, hitting the bullseye while blindfolded and then catching arrows that were fired at him, and then wrestling a bear, finally winning by breaking its neck with his bare hands. He was given a [[long bow]] into which he carved a notch whenever he performed a good deed. When he had attained 100 notches, would be judged worthy of having taken the mantle of the Black Marvel.

In later years, Lyons made a [[Faustian bargain]] with the demonic being [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] that allowed Lyons to obtain four superpowered costumes abandoned by the superhero [[Spider-Man]], and to use them to launch the superhero team the [[Slingers (comics)|Slingers]].<ref>''[[Slingers (comics)|Slingers]]'' # 0<!--"0" is correct-->-12 (Nov. 1998 - Nov. 1999)</ref> The heroes eventually helped release Lyons from his demonic contract, allowing him to die in peace.

The Black Marvel appeared on ''[[Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'' in the five-part episode ''[[Six Forgotten Warriors]]'', voiced by [[Paul Winfield]]. Here the Black Marvel is Omar Mosely, and a friend and former teacher of ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' editor [[Joseph "Robbie" Robertson|"Robbie" Robertson]].<ref>[http://marvel.toonzone.net/spideytas/bios/heroes/sfw/ Marvel Toonzone: ''Spider-Man: The Animated Series'']</ref> The Black Marvel and four other superheroes — the [[Whizzer (Robert Frank)|Whizzer]], [[Miss America (Marvel Comics)|Miss America]], the [[Thunderer]], and the [[Destroyer (Timely Comics)|Destroyer]] — gained their powers as the result of an attempt during [[World War II]]  to recreate the experimental process that empowered [[Captain America]]. His employer and friend Dan Lyons had intended to participate until Lyons' father forbade Lyons; Mosely took his place, gaining superhuman strength and wearing a face-covering black hood so that no one would know Mosely was [[African American]] during those racially divisive times. Lyons allowed others to believe that he was the hero and Mosely his [[sidekick]], in order to protect Omar's [[secret identity]].
