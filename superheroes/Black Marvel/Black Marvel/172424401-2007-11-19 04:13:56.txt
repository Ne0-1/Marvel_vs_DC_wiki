==Publication history==
The Black Marvel &mdash; one of the first creations of future Marvel editor-in-chief and publisher [[Stan Lee]] &mdash; appeared in the multi-character omnibus title ''Mystic Comics'' #5-9 (March 1941 - May 1942). His first-appearance [[origin story]] was reprinted in ''[[Marvel Super-Heroes (comics)|Marvel Super-Heroes]]'' #15 (July 1968).

==Fictional character biography==
He was chosen by a "Black Feet" ([[sic]]) Indian chief (not specifically tied to the real-life [[Blackfoot]] tribe) to be a champion of justice, after besting 100 challengers. He was given a bow to notch whenever he performed a good deed, and when attaining 100 notches would be allowed to take the mantle of the Black Marvel.

In later years, Lyons made a [[Faustian bargain]] with the demonic being [[Mephisto]] that allowed Lyons to obtain four superpowered costumes abandoned by the superhero [[Spider-Man]], and to use them to launch the superhero team the [[Slingers (comics)|Slingers]].<ref>''[[Slingers (comics)|Slingers]]'' # 0<!--"0" is correct-->-12 (Nov. 1998 - Nov. 1999)</ref> The heroes eventually helped release Lyons from his demonic contract, allowing him to die in peace.
