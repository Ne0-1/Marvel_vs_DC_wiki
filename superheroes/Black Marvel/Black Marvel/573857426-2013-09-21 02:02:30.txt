'''The Black Marvel''' ('''Daniel Lyons''') is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[comic book]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel universe|universe]]. Created by artist [[Al Gabriele]] with an unknown writer,<ref>Not [[Stan Lee]] as reported by some sources such as at "[http://www.lambiek.net/artists/l/lee_s.htm Stan Lee]" at the [[Lambiek Comiclopedia]]. See [http://comics.org/details.lasso?id=1315#1 ''Mystic Comics'' #5] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]: "Note that some sources claim that Stan Lee co-created the Black Marvel, but Lee's first writing credit, for a text filler, has been established as being in ''[[Captain America Comics]]'' #3, with his first comic scripting credit a few issues after that."</ref> he [[first appeared]] in ''[[Mystic Comics]]'' #5 (March 1941), published by Marvel's 1940s forerunner [[Timely Comics]] during the period fans and historians call the [[Golden Age of comic books]].

==Publication history==
The Black Marvel appeared in the multi-character omnibus title ''Mystic Comics'' #5-9 (March 1941 - May 1942). His first-appearance [[origin story]] was reprinted in ''[[Marvel Super-Heroes (comics)|Marvel Super-Heroes]]'' #15 (July 1968).

The character also starred in a story in ''[[All Winners Comics]]'' <!--no hyphen per cover logo--> #1 (Summer 1941), which was written by Lee and reprinted in ''The Golden Age of Marvel Comics, Vol. 2''.  The cover was also reprinted in ''Giant-Size Invaders'' vol. 2, #2 (Dec. 2005).

==Fictional character biography==
He was chosen by a "Black Feet" ([[sic]]) native American chief (not specifically tied to the real-life [[Blackfoot]] tribe) to be a champion of justice, after besting 100 challengers by outrunning a deer, outswimming a salmon upstream, hitting the bullseye while blindfolded and then catching arrows that were fired at him, and then wrestling a bear, finally winning by breaking its neck with his bare hands. He was given a [[long bow]] into which he carved a notch whenever he performed a good deed. When he had attained 100 notches he would be judged worthy of having taken the mantle of the Black Marvel.

In later years, Lyons made a [[deal with the Devil|Faustian bargain]] with the demonic being [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] that allowed Lyons to obtain four superpowered costumes abandoned by the superhero [[Spider-Man]], and to use them to launch the superhero team the [[Slingers]].<ref>''[[Slingers]]'' # 0<!--"0" is correct-->-12 (Nov. 1998 - Nov. 1999)</ref> The heroes eventually helped release Lyons from his demonic contract, allowing him to die in peace.
