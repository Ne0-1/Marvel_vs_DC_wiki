'''Lady Shiva''' is a [[fictional character]] created by [[DC Comics]]. Her real name is Sandra Woosan.

She is a [[martial art]]ist who first appeared in ''[[Richard Dragon, Kung Fu Master]]''. She works as an assassin selling her skill to anyone who can afford her price. There is an ongoing debate among comics fans on whether or not she or [[Batman]] is the greatest martial artist in the [[DC Universe]].

Amoung her most significant appearances were in the ''[[The Question]]'' where in the employ of an insane [[pastor]], she defeated The Question in combat.  However, for reasons of her own, she immediately rescued him from being murdered and arranged for extensive martial arts and [[philosophical]] instruction for him by Richard Dragon.  In addition, in the first ''[[Robin]]'' mini series where the Tim Drake Robin was abroad for advanced training, Lady Shiva insisted on training him herself.

There has been some fan speculation that Lady Shiva was the mother of [[Cassandra Cain]], the newest Batgirl. However, nothing has been confirmed.
