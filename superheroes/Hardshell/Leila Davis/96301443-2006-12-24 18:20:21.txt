'''Leila Davis''' was a [[super villain]] and later costumed hero in the [[Marvel Universe]], first under the name '''Hardshell''' and later as the second '''Beetle'''.  She was primarily an enemy of [[Spider-Man]] and the original [[MACH-IV (Marvel Comics)|Beetle]]

== Character history ==
Leila was at first the wife of Anthony Davis, a.k.a. the [[Ringer (comics)|Ringer]]. After Anthony was manipulated by Abner Jenkins (the original Beetle) into a life of crime (which included multiple conflicts with Spider-Man), he was eventually killed by the anti-hero [[Scourge (comics)|Scourge]].  Leila swore revenge on all three of them. She would eventually join the [[Sinister Syndicate]] (a team led by Jenkins), in order to get close to him.  Posing as [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]]'s girlfriend, she also served as the group's getaway driver.

Once Boomerang was captured by Spider-Man on the group's first mission, she began dating [[Speed Demon]].  Eventually, the [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]] would engineer a breakout for Boomerang and the team would fracture, with Boomerang, [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]],  and Leila (using her husband's old weapons) battling the Beetle, Speed Demon, and [[Hydro-Man]] in the middle of [[New York City]].  

After attempting to kill the Beetle, Leila was diasrmed by Spider-Man and arrested along with Jenkins and Boomerang.

Sometime later, she was paroled from prison and immediately went back to her old ways. Donning a new red and black suit of weaponize armor and referring to herself as '''Hardshell''', she this time allied herself with Boomerang, Rhino, and the [[Vulture (comics)|Vulture]].  The group became involved in a massive fight that also involved [[Stegron]], [[Doctor Octopus]], [[Swarm (comics)|Swarm]], the [[Answer (comics)|Answer]], Jenkins, and Spider-Man, with each party trying to gain control of a highly experimental gun.  Naturally Spider-Man eventually stood victorious and most of the costumed criminals, including Leila, were taken into custody. 

She reappeared years later taking on the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] (the superhero team a reformed Jenkins helped found), ironically now referring to herself as the Beetle and wearing a tank-like exoskeleton painted in the same paint scheme as both of Jenkins' previous Beetle costumes--a new iteration of the Beetle armor which Jenkins himself had designed while working for the [[Commission on Superhuman Activities]].

==Death==

As the second Beetle, she would eventually join the group known as the Redeemers, which actually included several former members of the Thunderbolts.  The group would take on the incredibly powerful super villain [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]], who would nonchalantly use his power to crush the Beetle armor into a small cube, almost certainly killing Leila in the process.
