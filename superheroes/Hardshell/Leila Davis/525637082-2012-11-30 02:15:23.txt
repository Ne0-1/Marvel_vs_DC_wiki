'''Leila Davis''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]], a [[comic book]] [[supervillainess]] and later costumed hero in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. She first went by the name '''Hardshell''' and later as the second '''Beetle'''. She was primarily an enemy of [[Spider-Man]] and the original [[Beetle (comics)|Beetle]].

==Fictional character biography==
Leila is at first the wife of the [[Ringer (comics)|Ringer (Anthony Davis)]]. After Anthony is manipulated by [[Abner Jenkins]] (the original Beetle) into a life of crime (which included multiple conflicts with Spider-Man), he is eventually killed by the anti-hero [[Scourge (comics)|Scourge]].  Leila swears revenge on all three of them. She joins the [[Sinister Syndicate]] (a team led by Jenkins), in order to get close to him. She also serves as the group's [[crime scene getaway|getaway driver]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #56 (2001)</ref> 

Once Boomerang was captured by Spider-Man on the group's first mission, she began dating [[Speed Demon (Marvel Comics)|Speed Demon]].  Eventually, the [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]] engineers a breakout for Boomerang and the team fractures, with Boomerang, [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]],  and Leila (using her husband's old weapons) battling the Beetle, Speed Demon, and [[Hydro-Man]] in the middle of [[New York City]].{{Issue|date=August 2009}} 

After attempting to kill the Beetle, Leila is disarmed by Spider-Man and arrested along with Jenkins and Boomerang.<ref>''Deadly Foes of Spider-Man'' #1</ref> 

Sometime later, she is paroled from prison and immediately went back to her old ways. Donning a new red and black suit of weaponize armor and referring to herself as '''Hardshell''', she allies herself with Boomerang, Rhino, and the [[Vulture (comics)|Vulture]].  The group became involved in a massive fight that also involves [[Stegron]], [[Doctor Octopus]], [[Swarm (comics)|Swarm]], the [[Answer (comics)|Answer]], Jenkins, and Spider-Man, with each party trying to gain control of a highly experimental gun. Spider-Man eventually stood victorious and most of the costumed criminals are taken into custody. Leila is teleported away by her husband Anthony, who had been turned into the cyborg Strikeback by the criminal organization 'Advanced Idea Mechanics'.<ref>''Lethal Foes of Spider-Man'' #1</ref>

She reappears years later taking on the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] (the superhero team a reformed Jenkins helped found), ironically now referring to herself as 'the Beetle'. She is wearing a tank-like exoskeleton painted in the same paint scheme as both of Jenkins' previous Beetle costumesâ€”a new iteration of the Beetle armor which Jenkins himself had designed while working for the [[Commission on Superhuman Activities]].

===Death===
As the second Beetle, she eventually joins the group known as the Redeemers, which actually includes several former members of the Thunderbolts.  The group takes on the powerful super villain [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]], who would nonchalantly use his power to crush the Beetle armor - with Leila inside - into a small cube.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #48</ref>
