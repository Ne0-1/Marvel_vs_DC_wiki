'''Nathaniel Richards''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He is the father of Reed Richards, [[Mister Fantastic]] of the [[Fantastic Four]], and the grandfather of [[Franklin Richards]].

He is a scientific [[genius]], and his son Reed's aptitude for science is inherited from him, though Reed has proven himself to exceed his father's ability.

Nathaniel Richards is a [[time traveler]]. Though his son Reed is a [[superhero]], Nathaniel Richards is not; his agenda is always clouded and often sinister, though not outright villainous. He clearly has many plans in motion, but exactly what those are is unknown.

There is evidence which has fueled long-term speculation among the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and Fantastic Four fan community that he is somehow related to [[Kang the Conqueror]]: either he is an ancestor of Kang the Conqueror or, possibly, a future variant of himself became Kang the Conqueror.
