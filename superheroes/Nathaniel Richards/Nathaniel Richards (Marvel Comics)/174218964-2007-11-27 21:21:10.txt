'''Nathaniel Richards''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He is the father of Reed Richards, [[Mister Fantastic]] of the [[Fantastic Four]], and the grandfather of [[Franklin Richards]] and [[Valeria Richards]]. It is speculated that he is also the secret identity of [[Iron Lad]]/[[Kang the Conqueror]]/[[Immortus]], or alternatively this person could have been named Nathaniel Richards to honor Reed's father. He has other children besides Reed. In an alternate timeline he visited and fathered an unnamed son with a woman named Cassandra (this has long been assumed to be the ancestor of Kang). He also claims to have fathered Tara Richards aka [[Huntara]] as well as [[Kristoff Vernard]].

==Fictional character biography==
He is a scientific [[genius]], and his son Reed's aptitude for science is inherited from him, though Reed has proven himself to exceed his father's ability.

Nathaniel Richards is a [[time traveler]]. Though his son Reed is a [[superhero]], Nathaniel Richards is not; his agenda is always clouded and often sinister, though not outright villainous. He clearly has many plans in motion, but exactly what those are is unknown.

During one of [[Doctor Doom]]'s absences, Nathaniel actually impersonates him, convincing even Doom's technologically advanced servitor robots. 

After Doom vanishes during the [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] incident, Nathaniel teams up with [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] and his team, [[X-Force]]. Both men agree Doctor Doom's time platform should be made secure against those who would mis-use this. During the course of this endeavor, Nathaniel assists in helping [[Meltdown (comics)|Meltdown]] out of Doom's Liddleville. It is a shrunken town, where many of Doom's enemies had been imprisoned.

Unfortunately, a SHIELD squadron follows the X-Force group into Doom's castle. A firefight results in Nathaniel, his companions and the entire castle vanishing in a teleportation effect.  

===Relatives===

In the miniseries [[Avengers Forever]], Kang himself explains his own origins, claiming to be the future descendant of Nathaniel Richards. It has been strongly hinted at that he is the biological father of Doctor Doom's adopted son [[Kristoff Vernard]]. Despite this speculation, current evidence states that Kang is not to be confused with Reed Richards' father, after whom he is named. In fact, he was born in an alternate timeline. The Earth there had been transformed into a paradise thanks to Mister Fantastic's father, the Nathaniel Richards after whom he was named.

One of Nathaniel's most famous moments was kidnapping his grandson [[Franklin Richards| Franklin]] and raising him in the future. This was 'neutralized' when the younger Franklin reappears after some time away.

== Ultimate Marvel ==

In [[Ultimate Marvel]], Reed's father is named Gary.  Unlike Nathaniel, Gary is a cruel man with no knowledge in science who treated his own son like dirt because of how he never developed as an athlete.  He praised the athletic [[Ben Grimm]] like the son he wanted, but wasn't as kind as Ben.  He would have treated Reed much worse than the bullies at his school.  When Reed was accepted into the [[Baxter Building]] think tank, his father only agreed because Reed's family would be paid to send him.
