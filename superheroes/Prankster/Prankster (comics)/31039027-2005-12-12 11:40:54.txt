[[Image:Prankster.jpg|thumb|The Prankster and [[Superman]], from the cover of ''[[Action Comics]]'' #95.]]'''The Prankster''' (real name: '''Oswald Loomis''') is a [[fictional character]] and [[villain]] who appears in [[Superman]] stories published by [[DC Comics]]. The Prankster's first appearance was in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #51 in [[1942]].

The Prankster's particular gimmick was the use of various [[practical jokes]] and [[gag]]s in committing his crimes. This, coupled with his cartoonish appearance, caused many to write him off as a "joke villain", until the early [[2000]]s, when writers improved upon the character by giving him a more svelte appearance, as well as high tech weaponry that made him a more serious threat.

==Post Crisis==

Comedian Oswald Loomis had his own sitcom called "Uncle Oswald", which was specifically tailored for his brand of comedy. Though successful for many years, the ratings eventually fell, leading to the show's cancellation. Due to typecasting, he found it difficult to find new employment. Angered and bitter that his gravy train had come to an end, Loomis sought revenge on the network executives that were responsible for his show's cancellation, but was foiled by Superman.

He was eventually given a younger, more athletic body presumably by [[Neron]]. His personality was changed as well, no longer an inept goofball, he was now an eccentric madman seeking to unleash his twisted brand of laughter upon the world. By this time, Metropolis had been upgraded by [[Brainiac (comics)|Brianiac 13]]. The Prankster took advantage of the new technology, creating high tech gadgets and weaponry, which retained a comical theme. He quickly challenged Superman again. By this time, Superman was suffering from [[kryptonite]] poisoning during their battle, and was hospitalized in [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] shortly therafter. 

During the ''Critical Condition'' storyline, scientists learned that the cause of Superman's illness was a [[nanotechnology|nanovirus]] carrying a small grain of kryptonite. They proposed to shrink [[Steel (comics)|Steel]], [[Superboy]], and [[Supergirl]] to microscopic size, and send them into Superman's bloodstream to destroy the virus. However, the Prankster subdued Steel, stole his armor, and attempted to sabotage their efforts. Though he failed, he escaped, with Steel's armor still in his possession. He used the armor to attack Supergirl, before Steel reaquired it via a remote failsafe.

The Prankster next performed a series of criminal favors for [[Lord Satanus]], before losing favor with the demon. Later on, when [[Manchester Black]] revealed Superman's identity, the Prankster was one of many villains involved in the campaign to destroy Superman's life, though he forgot Superman's identity when Black was defeated.

==Other media==

The Prankster appeared on two episodes of ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]''. His name was changed to Kyle Griffin. He was played by [[Bronson Pinchot]].
