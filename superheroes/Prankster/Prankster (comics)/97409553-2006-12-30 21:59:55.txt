'''The Prankster''' (real name: '''Oswald Loomis''') is a [[fictional character]] and [[villain]] who appears in [[Superman]] stories published by [[DC Comics]]. The Prankster's first appearance was in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #51 in [[1942]].

The Prankster's particular gimmick was the use of various [[practical jokes]] and [[gag]]s in committing his crimes. This, coupled with his cartoonish appearance, caused many to write him off as a "joke villain", until the early [[2000]]s, when writers improved upon the character by giving him a more svelte appearance, as well as high tech weaponry that made him a more serious threat.

==History==
===Golden and Silver Age versions===

===Modern Age version===

Comedian Oswald Loomis had his own sitcom called "Uncle Oswald", which was specifically tailored for his brand of comedy. Though successful for many years, the ratings eventually fell, leading to the show's cancellation. Due to typecasting, he found it difficult to find new employment. Angered and bitter that his gravy train had come to an end, Loomis sought revenge on the network executives that were responsible for his show's cancellation, but was foiled by Superman.

He was eventually given a younger, more athletic body presumably by [[Lord Satanus]]. His personality was changed as well, no longer an inept goofball, he was now a manic trickster seeking to unleash his twisted brand of laughter upon the world. By this time, Metropolis had been upgraded by [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac 13]]. The Prankster took advantage of the new technology, creating high tech gadgets and weaponry, which retained a comical theme. He quickly challenged Superman again. Superman was suffering from [[kryptonite]] poisoning during the battle, and was hospitalized in [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] shortly thereafter. 

During the ''Critical Condition'' storyline, scientists learned that the cause of Superman's illness was a [[nanotechnology|nanovirus]] carrying a small grain of kryptonite. They proposed to shrink [[Steel (comics)|Steel]], [[Superboy]], and [[Supergirl]] to microscopic size, and send them into Superman's bloodstream to destroy the virus. However, the Prankster subdued Steel, stole his armor, and attempted to sabotage their efforts. Though he failed, he escaped with Steel's armor still in his possession. He used the armor to attack Supergirl, before Steel reaquired it via a remote failsafe.

The Prankster was later hired by [[Lord Satanus]] to kidnap metahumans with dual personalities, particularly those with a light/dark duality. Satanus had hoped to gain strength by drawing power from the darker personalities of these individuals. Superman foiled this scheme, and the Prankster disappeared after Satanus was defeated. Later on, when [[Manchester Black]] revealed Superman's identity, the Prankster was one of many villains involved in the campaign to destroy Superman's life, though he forgot Superman's identity when Black was defeated.

In a [[One Year Later]] storyline, the Prankster is hired by [[Lex Luthor]] to wreak havoc in Metropolis.  While [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]] and [[Hawkgirl]] bring down Loomis and his army of traffic-light-men, his rampage is just a distraction while Luthor breaks [[Kryptonite Man]] out of prison.

The Prankster was portrayed by [[Bronson Pinchot]] in two episodes of ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]''. Here his name was Kyle Griffin, a man who was sent to jail five years earlier due to one of Lois Lane's articles. In the first episode titled ''The Prankster '' he breaks out of prison and goes after Lois posing as her secret admirer. The Prankster's comic book identity was referenced when Lois suspected the admirer was an old school acquaintance named Loomis.

He returned later in the season, with light ray capable of paralyzing people (including Superman). He attempted to use this device to kidnap the President of the United States, who was visiting Metropolis.

The Prankster also appeared in the 1988 animated series of Superman. His look and modus-operandi were taken straight from the comics. In the story he organized a base-ball game of professional players against Superman alone.
