'''The Vision''' was a [[comic book]] character created by [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]] and published by [[Timely Comics]] during the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]], the historical predecessor of what is now called [[Marvel Comics]]. He made his debut in ''[[Marvel Mystery Comics]]'' #13 ([[November]] [[1940]]).

The original Vision was an entity named '''Aarkus''' who either lived in or was native to another dimension.  On his planet, known simply as Smoke World, the Vision was a "Keeper of Law".  He was asked by an Earth scientist to come to Earth to act as a super-powered guardian over humanity.  The Golden Age Vision possessed vaguely defined powers, including but not limited to the ability to travel through dimensions via smoke, flight, and matter transmutation.  He was a frequent feature and one of the star attractions in ''Marvel Mystery Comics'' throughout the 1940s, but disappeared when superheroes fell out of fashion at the end of the decade.

His only major appearance in modern comics was in the second series of ''[[Invaders (comics)|The Invaders]]'' ([[1993]]), in which he was summoned to Earth and manipulated by [[Nazi Germany]] into attacking the Allies.  He realized his mistake, and soon returned home. Few original stories of the Vision have been republished in modern times, the most notable example being the ''Golden Age of Marvel Comics'' trade paperback reprint collections.

Writer [[Roy Thomas]], a fan of Golden Age character, used the Vision as a visual template for its [[Vision (comics)|modern incarnation]], but the resemblances stop there.
