==Fictional character biography==
The Golden Age Vision, also known as Aarkus, is an alien [[law enforcement officer]] from a dimension called Smokeworld. While Aarkus is looking for a suitable place to exile a prisoner, he is accidentally contacted by an Earth scientist named Markham Erickson. Leaving the prisoner on the planet Jupiter, Aarkus accepts Erickson's invitation to fight crime on Earth.<ref>''[[Marvel Mystery Comics]]'' #13 (Nov. 1940)</ref> Aarkus does so for several years, although during World War II is briefly manipulated by the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]] powers into fighting the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. The superhero team the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]], however, manage to help Aarkus realize his mistake.<ref>''[[Invaders (comics)|The Invaders]]'' vol. 2, #3 (July 1993)</ref>

A [[simulacrum]] of the Vision was temporarily created from the mind of [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]], along with those of the [[Blazing Skull]], the [[Fin (comics)|Fin]], and the Golden Age [[Angel (Thomas Halloway)|Angel]] and [[Jeffrey Mace|Patriot]], to aid the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] during the [[Kree-Skrull War]].<ref>''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' #97 (March 1972)</ref>

In the present day, it is revealed that he inhabits the sewers under New York, taking care of a Cosmic Cube that is feeding off the feelings of people affected by the death of [[Captain America]], at the end of a stint with time traveling, we last see him with the newly resurrected [[Toro (comics)|Toro]].<ref>''Torch'' # 1</ref> He also plays a supporting role in 2012's ''[[X-Men: Legacy]]'', opposing and later aiding main character [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|Legion]]. This leads to Aarkus ending up comatose and confined to the medical wing of the [[Jean Grey School for Higher Learning]].

After awaking from his coma, Aarkus is approached by the [[Bucky Barnes|Winter Soldier]] for help in getting the surviving members of the Invaders to the [[Kree]] home world to rescue [[Namor]]. It is revealed during this time that in World War 2, Aarkus had mindwiped the Invaders (with their consent) in order to hide the location of an ancient Kree weapon that had granted [[Baron Von Strucker]] the power to control Gods.<ref>''All-New Invaders'' #2-3 (February-March 2014)</ref>

== Powers and abilities==
The Vision can generate illusory images of himself, fly, generate ice and extreme cold, and teleport wherever there is smoke.{{fact|date=September 2015}}
