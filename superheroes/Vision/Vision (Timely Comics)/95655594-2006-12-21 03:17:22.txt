'''The Vision''' ('''Aarkus''') is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[superhero]] created by [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]] during the 1930-'40s [[Golden Age of comic books]]. He [[first appeared]] in ''[[Marvel Mystery Comics]]'' #13 (Nov. 1940), published by [[Timely Comics]] a predecessor of [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
One of Timely's successful second-tier characters, the Vision starred in a generally seven-page feature in ''Marvel Mystery Comics'' #13-48 (Nov. 1940 - Oct. 1943) and in an eight-page story in ''Kid Comics'' #3 (1943, no month given; previous issue dated Summer 1943). He also starred in a text story, "The Vision Speaks", by [[Stan Lee]], in ''Marvel Mystery Comics'' #23 (Sept. 1941), in which the ruler of Smoke-World was revealed as The Law-Giver.

His only major appearance in modern comics is in ''[[Invaders (comics)|The Invaders]]'', Vol. 2, #3 (July 1993), in which he was summoned to Earth and manipulated by [[Nazi Germany]] into attacking the [[Allies]].  He realized his mistake and soon returned home.

Marvel writer-editor [[Roy Thomas]], a fan of the Golden Age character, used the Vision as a visual template for the [[Vision (comics)|modern-day Vision]], but the characters are otherwise unrelated.

==Fictional character biography==
'''Aarkus''' either lived in or was native to another dimension.  On his planet, known simply as Smoke-World, the Vision was a "Keeper of Law".  He was asked by an Earth scientist to come to Earth to act as a super-powered guardian over humanity.  The Vision possessed vaguely defined powers, including flight, matter transmutation, and the ability to travel through dimensions via smoke.

A [[simulacrum]] of the Vision was temporarily created from the mind of [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]], along with those of the [[Blazing Skull]], the [[Fin (comics)|Fin]], the [[Jeffrey Mace|Patriot]], and the Golden Age [[Angel (Golden Age)|Angel]], to aid the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] during the [[Kree-Skrull War]]<ref>''The Avengers'' (first series) #97 (March 1972)</ref>.

==Trivia==
*An anecdote states that the Vision was inspired by the cigar-smoke-filled office in which his creator was sitting, trying to think up new characters.{{fact}}
