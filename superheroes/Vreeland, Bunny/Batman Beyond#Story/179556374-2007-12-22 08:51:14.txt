'''''Batman Beyond''''' (known as '''''Batman of the Future''''' in [[Europe]], [[Latin America]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[India]]) is an [[United States of America|American]] [[animated television series]] created by [[The WB Television Network]] in collaboration with [[DC Comics]] as a continuation of the [[Batman]] legacy.

''Batman Beyond'' began airing on [[January 10]], [[1999 in television|1999]] and ended its run on [[December 18]], [[2001 in television|2001]]. With 52 episodes and one [[direct-to-video]] movie under its belt, the series was then put on hold for the new ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'' animated series. As of [[2007]], ''Batman Beyond'' remains on hiatus with no plans to revive the series in the near future. However, there was a short-lived spin-off, ''[[The Zeta Project]]''. It is worth noting that in ''The Zeta Project'''s first season episode "Shadows", there is a crossover with ''Batman Beyond''; in this [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]], the story takes place between the episode "Countdown" and the series finale "Unmasked."

==Story==
In the pilot episode, we see approximately 30 years into the future an aging [[Batman]] is having increasing difficulty handling criminals he once subdued with ease. One night, a [[heart attack]] forces Batman to betray a lifelong principle by threatening a criminal with a [[gun]], despite already wearing a new, high-tech [[Batsuit]]. Subsequently, [[Bruce Wayne]] decides to retire the Batman persona, and crime fighting in general, permanently.

The story then fast-forwards another 20 years. [[Gotham City]] is now a futuristic megalopolis equipped with staggering high rises and hovering/flying vehicles. Bruce Wayne is now a virtual recluse, spending his latter years living in bitter isolation with no companion but his guard dog, [[Ace the Bat-Hound|Ace]]. It is implied by virtue of his continuing to fight crime long after he should have, and his retaining of the costumes worn by [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], [[Nightwing]], and [[Batgirl]], that even before he had a heart attack, something horrible transpired that caused Bruce to sever his ties with the [[Justice League]] and forbid his disciples from ever again assuming their alter-egos. The events which caused all of this was finally revealed in ''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]''.

In [[2040]], [[Batman (Terry McGinnis)|Terry McGinnis]] (born on [[June 27]], [[2023]]) is an athletic 17-year-old high school student and reformed troublemaker with a deeply ingrained sense of personal justice. During the pilot episode, he saves a fellow passenger on a commuter rail from being hassled by one of the [[Jokerz]], and later single-handedly takes on an entire gang of them to defend his girlfriend, ultimately resulting in a harrowing high-speed motorcycle chase through Neo-Gotham's expressways. The chase ultimately ends at the doorstep of [[Wayne Manor]], where a fleeing Terry runs into the elderly Bruce Wayne. Bruce and Terry fend off the Jokerz side-by-side, but the exertion aggravates his heart condition. Terry helps Bruce back to the manor, and while staying there, he discovers the entrance to the [[Batcave]], and later returns to "borrow" the Batsuit to avenge the death of his father. As crime and corruption are beginning once again to rear their ugly heads in [[Gotham City|Gotham]], Bruce ultimately allows Terry to assume the mantle of Batman.

Terry continues the battle against crime tutored by Bruce, and aided by a new black-and-red, high-tech Batsuit that augments his abilities, fires Batarangs from the wrists, flies using jets fired from the feet, allows eavesdropping through a hypersensitive touch microphone, and provides [[camouflage]] abilities. He comes to have his own [[rogues gallery]], such as the seductive shape-shifter [[Inque]], the hypnotist [[Spellbinder (DC Comics)|Spellbinder]], the bitter, deaf sound expert [[Shriek (Batman Beyond)|Shriek]], the deadly assassin [[Curare (comics)|Curare]], the insane terrorist [[Mad Stan]], and the [[African people|African]] hunter [[Stalker (Batman Beyond)|Stalker]], and the [[Jokerz]], a gang idolizing the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]. However, on occasion, Terry is also forced to face his mentor's old foes, such as the atrophying [[Mr. Freeze]], [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] (elderly, wasted, and dying from his consumption of Venom, the substance that gave him his strength), the [[immortality|immortal]] [[Ra's al Ghul]], and even a reborn [[Joker (comics)|Joker]].

[[Image:Batmanbeyondminiseries03.jpg|left|175px|thumb|Cover art by [[Bruce Timm]] from the ''Batman Beyond'' comic book miniseries, depicting [[Terry McGinnis|Batman]] battling [[Derek Powers|Blight]].]]
Terry's greatest initial foe is [[Derek Powers]], a ruthless billionaire who took over Wayne Industries and was later accidentally mutated into a radioactive monstrosity known as [[Derek Powers|Blight]]. Powers had Terry's father, [[Warren & Mary McGinnis|Warren]], murdered after Warren discovered that Powers was in the process of developing a [[biological warfare|biological weapons]] program. The first season ended with a showdown between Batman and Blight aboard an abandoned nuclear submarine, where Powers was in hiding after his identity as Blight was revealed to the world by his ambitious son Paxton, who planned to usurp his father as chairman of Wayne-Powers.

[[Maxine "Max" Gibson]] (born [[October 28]], [[2023]]) is a 17-year old computer [[genius]] who discovers Batman's secret identity, and helps Terry with everything from [[computer hacking]], to babysitting, to coming up with excuses for Terry's girlfriend, Dana Tan. Max plays an integral part in Batman's war on crime, essentially as his [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]].

Terry also finds one other ally, though a begrudging one: [[Barbara Gordon]], the former [[Batgirl]]. Having followed in the footsteps of her father, [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]], Barbara is now Police Commissioner of [[Gotham City]], and she is unhappy with the idea of a new Batman, especially a teenager, as she is still haunted by the same event that caused Bruce to go into isolation. However, knowing from personal experience that she cannot deter Terry anymore than she could have been deterred from being Batgirl, she relents, possibly also out of respect for her mentor, the original Batman. Also, passing conversation between Barbara and Bruce suggested that at the time of Batgirl's retirement, the suit had bullet holes in it that had been repaired. It is implied early on in the series that Barbara was in love with Bruce for a period of time.

==Lexicon==
To help carry off the feel of a world 50 years in the future, Batman Beyond employed a group of slang terms either specifically invented or with altered usage.
*Shway: An adjective generally synonymous with "cool".
*Twip: An insult implying immaturity or scrawniness. Likely a corruption of "Twerp".
*Slag: General purpose expletive used as both noun and verb. Originally a mining term. Interestingly, this term may have been inspired by the use of the same word by characters in [[Beast Wars]], who used the word in much the same manner.
*Dreg: generally meaning "lowlife".

==Justice League connection==
In the third season of ''Batman Beyond'', a two-part story featuring the [[Justice League]] entitled "The Call" formed an early basis for Timm's next series, ''Justice League'', which was in turn succeeded by ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''. The setting and characters of ''Batman Beyond'' were also briefly revived in [[2004]] for an episode of ''[[Static Shock]]'' in which [[Static (superhero)|Static]] is accidentally transported forty years into the future.

''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' revisited the world of ''Batman Beyond'' twice in [[2005]]. The first time featured Batman, [[Wonder Woman]], and [[Green Lantern]] transported 50 years into the future to stop a time-traveling villain with the help of the future ''Justice League Unlimited'' cast, including [[Terry McGinnis]] as Batman. The second time occurred during the episode "[[Epilogue (Justice League Unlimited episode)|Epilogue]]", where the true secret origin of the future Batman is learned in a story meant to be the [[de facto]] [[series finale]] for this Batman's story.

==Project ''Batman Beyond''==
The ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "[[Epilogue (Justice League Unlimited)|Epilogue]]", set 15 years after the conclusion of ''Batman Beyond'', reveals that [[Bruce Wayne]] is actually [[Terry McGinnis]]' biological father. The episode is told largely in flashbacks.

Over the years Amanda Waller came to respect Batman and even trust him. She especially admired the fact that he always was two steps ahead of everybody. In her job as [[government]] [[liaison]] to the Justice League Waller met some extraordinary people, but none of them were the equal of Batman. She saw him save the day dozens of times, with nothing but his wits, body, and will. But she saw something else as the years passed, he was getting older and slower. Soon he would have to retire or more likely someone would finally manage to kill him. The thought of a world without Batman was unacceptable, so she decided to make a new one.

She used her old Cadmus connections to gather the technology for "Project Batman Beyond." Bruce Wayne's [[DNA]] was easy to obtain since he literally left it all over [[Gotham City]] being injured in his crime fighting. Then she found a young Neo Gotham couple with psychological profiles nearly identical to those of Bruce's parents. When [[Warren & Mary McGinnis|Warren McGinnis]] thought he was getting a [[Influenza vaccine|flu shot]], he actually received a [[nanotechnology|nanotech]] solution programmed to rewrite his [[reproductive]] material into an exact copy of Bruce Wayne's. A little over a year later, Mary McGinnis gave birth to Terry, a child sharing half her [[genetic]] material and half Bruce's.

When Terry was eight years old, his parents took him to the rousing adventure film, ''The Grey Ghost Strikes''. Waller hired [[Andrea Beaumont]] (the title character from ''[[Mask of the Phantasm]]'') as an assassin. Waller's plan was simple, Beaumont would leap out and kill Terry's family. The trauma would put him on the path to becoming Batman. However, at the last minute Beaumont refused to do it, arguing with Waller that Batman would never resort to murder to achieve his goals. Eventually Waller agreed. Tragically, [[Derek Powers]] would later instigate Terry's path towards becoming the new Batman anyway by having Warren murdered.

Fifteen years after Terry McGinnis became the new Batman, Bruce Wayne's kidneys fail and doctors need a tissue donor to [[Cloning|clone]] him new ones. It turned out that Terry was a perfect histo-compatibility match with Bruce. Since the odds of that were 111 to 1, Terry ran a DNA test and found out that half his DNA was from Bruce. Terry assumed that Bruce set the whole thing up, using some old Cadmus nanotechnology to have Terry's [[gene]]s rewritten to match Bruce's, similar to what the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] did to [[Tim Drake]].

He tracked Amanda Waller down and broke into her house where she revealed his origins to him. She also reminded him that he was Bruce Wayne's son, not his clone, and that despite of his genetics he still had free will and made his own choice in becoming Batman. Waller also pointed out to him that even though he held many similarities to Bruce Wayne, that there were more than a few differences too: he didn't "quite have his (Bruce Wayne's) magnificent [[brain]]", but that he did have Bruce's [[heart]] and sense of responsibility.

Terry, who had been contemplating abandoning Bruce, the mantle of Batman, and his girlfriend Dana Tan (the two were still in a relationship), eventually opts to return home and continue on as Batman as he has. He also calls Dana and asks her to meet him, with the implication that he intends to ask her to [[Marriage|marry]] him.

According to writer [[Dwayne McDuffie]], Bruce was aware that Terry was his son, but would never bring it up as he wanted Terry to be his own man.[http://jl.toonzone.net/episode50/episode50.htm]

It should be noted that the black and white sequences of "Epilogue" are intended to represent a dream and not flashbacks.{{Fact|date=November 2007}}

Though it is not specified in the episode, as Warren McGinnis' [[sperm]] was genetically reprogrammed to contain Bruce's DNA, Terry's brother, [[Matt McGinnis|Matt]], is also the biological son of Bruce Wayne. [[Bruce Timm]] himself stated, "Well, we didn't come right out and say it,... yes, Matt is also Bruce's biological son."[http://jl.toonzone.net/episode50/episode50.htm]

It is interesting to note that this episode marks the first time that the title "Batman Beyond" was actually mentioned in the context of a ''Batman Beyond'' story. While in costume, Terry identifies himself simply as Batman. In some parts of the world, the title itself was dropped, and the show is called ''Batman of the Future''.

It should be noted that the story in "Epilogue" does not justify the coincidence of Terry ending up at Wayne Manor and eventually stumbling upon the Bat Cave. Waller, in the episode, posits that maybe it was fate that led Terry to Wayne Manor and to assume the mantle of Batman.

==Movies==
* ''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]'' - A direct-to-video feature in which the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] makes his return to [[Gotham City|Gotham]]. The original release was censored for elements of violence and death, and a second, uncensored release came later.

*There was also a planned ''Batman Beyond'' live action feature, to be written by [[Paul Dini]], however [[Warner Bros.]] shelved the project and eventually went with the ''[[Batman Begins]]'' concept instead. In August 2000, [[Warner Bros.]] announced that it was developing a [[live action]] [[film adaptation]] of the TV series ''Batman Beyond'' with [[Boaz Yakin]] attached to co-write and direct. The TV series' creators [[Paul Dini]] and [[Alan Burnett]] were hired to write a screenplay for the feature film, with author [[Neal Stephenson]] consulting the duo.<ref>{{cite news | author=Dana Harris | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117785384.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | title=There's new 'Batman' in WB's belfry | publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=[[2000-08-22]] | accessdate=2007-05-17 }}</ref>  By July 2001, a first draft was turned in to the studio, and the writers were waiting to see if a rewrite would be needed.

*Finally, a Direct-to-DVD sequel to ''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]'' was to feature [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle/Catwoman]]. This project never made it off the ground; however, much of the concept of this film eventually made it into the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "[[Epilogue (Justice League Unlimited)|Epilogue]]."

==Comics==
After an initial 6-issues [[limited series]] released in [[March]] [[1999]], ''Batman Beyond'' had its own comic book series, running through [[November]] [[1999]] until [[October]] [[2001]], for a total of 24 issues. They were set in the same world of the show and aimed at younger readers.

Originally, ''Batman Beyond'' #3 (the monthly series) was to focus on The Terrific Trio from the ''Batman Beyond'' episode "Heroes." The story would have 2-D Man and Magma trying to revive their former teammate, Freon. It was rejected due to their resemblance to the [[Fantastic Four]].[http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/beyond/guides/comic/01.php]

Terry also appeared in ''Superman Adventures'' #64. The story has Terry/Batman traveling to the present and teaming up with [[Superman]] against a futuristic version of [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]].

More recently, in ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' #22 (written by [[Jeph Loeb]]), a Batman wearing the ''Beyond'' costume appears, making his first foray into the regular [[DC Comics]] continuity. The plot involves [[Bizarro]] being transported to an alternate version of [[Gotham City]]. It would appear from #23 that this Batman is someone named "Tim" (presumably [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Tim Drake]]). However, the writers admitted to the mistake of misnaming the character,{{Fact|date=August 2007}} and although the name was rumored to be changed to "Terry" in the trade paperback, it still reads "Tim" (see first page of "Smoke and Mirrors" chapter in the trade paperback). Furthermore, the packaging for the action figure created by DC Direct based on this appearance in Superman/Batman also erroneously identifies Batman Beyond as Tim Drake instead of Terry McGinnis. Another oddity is the [[Batwing]] pictured is the version from [[Batman: The Animated Series]], not ''Batman Beyond''. Whether this is the regular [[DC Comics universe|DC universe]] or a parallel one is still to be seen. It seems possible that this may be an alternate reality as the same story has [[Batzarro]] transported to the world of ''[[Superman: Red Son]]'', an [[Elseworlds]] [[communism|communist]] version of [[Superman]].

On March 3, 2007 [[Dan DiDio]] announced that Terry McGinnis may be showing up in the DCU sometime this year.<ref>[http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0703/03/dcnationpanel.htm]</ref> This turned out to be true, as Terry McGinnis will be appearing in [[Countdown to Final Crisis]] #21. He will be an inhabitant of [[List of DC Multiverse worlds|Earth-12]]<ref>http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?p=4800627&posted=1</ref>. It's unknown at the moment whether Earth-12 will be the home Earth of the entire [[DC Animated Universe]], or just the home Earth of the ''Batman Beyond'' TV series.

A [[Green Lantern]] implied to be from a universe within the multiverse similar to that of Batman Beyond (though not the same GL represented in the animated series) is a participant in the [[Countdown: Arena]] series leading towards [[Final Crisis]].

One cannon contribution of Batman Beyond to the DC Universe is establishing that [[Barbara Gordon]] eventually becomes Commissioner of Gotham Police following in her father's footsteps.

==Spin-offs==
''Batman Beyond'' had a spin-off called ''[[The Zeta Project]]'', featuring the [[android]] Zeta from the ''Batman Beyond'' episode "Zeta." Batman would guest star in the episode "Shadows."

The supervillain [[Stalker (Batman Beyond)|Stalker]] was to have appeared in ''[[The Zeta Project]]'' episode "Taffy Time," but didn't make it. The second season episode, "Ro's Gift," has an appearance made by the [[Brain Trust]] from the ''Batman Beyond'' episode "Mind Games." [[Terry McGinnis|Terry McGinnis/Batman]] was originally slated to appear in this episode as well, but was cut since Timm and company were working on ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]''.
