'''''Batman Beyond''''' (known as '''''Batman of the Future''''' in Europe, Latin America, Australia, and Asia) is an American animated television series developed by Bruce Timm, Paul Dini, and Alan Burnett and produced by [[Warner Bros. Animation]] in collaboration with [[DC Comics]] as a continuation of the [[Batman]] legacy.<ref>{{cite news|title= A History of Batman on TV|work= IGN|url= http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/891/891807p8.html|accessdate=August 15, 2010}}</ref> Depicting a teenaged [[Batman (Terry McGinnis)|Batman]] in a futuristic [[Gotham City]] under the tutelage of an elderly [[Bruce Wayne]], the series began airing on January 10, 1999, and ended its run on December 18, 2001. After 52 episodes spanning three seasons and one [[direct-to-video]] [[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker|film]], the series was put on hold for the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' animated series, despite the network having announced plans for a fourth season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0102/09/index.htm |title=News |publisher=Comics Continuum |date=February 9, 2001 |accessdate=January 2, 2011}}</ref>

''Batman Beyond'' is set in the chronological future of the [[DC animated universe]] (despite being released before ''[[Static Shock]]'', ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'', and ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''), and serves as a continuance of both ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' and ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]''.

''Batman Beyond'' is said to explore the darker side of many Batman projects, playing on key elements such as emotions, personal relations, fear of the unknown, to [[cyberpunk]] and [[sci-fi]] themed elements such as issues and dilemmas of innovation and technological and scientific progress affecting society, and to the disturbing psychological elements of the character of Bruce Wayne. As such, it was considerably darker than most other children's programs at the time, although producer [[Bruce Timm]] recalls it was conceived as a kid-friendly ''Batman'' cartoon.<ref name="mmv3">{{cite book |title= Modern Masters Volume 3: Bruce Timm |last= Nolen-Weathington |first= Eric |authorlink= |date= June 1, 2004 |publisher= TwoMorrows Publishing |location= |isbn= 978-1-893905-30-6 |page= 67 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=EMwn_4llWK0C&pg=PA67&lpg=PA67&dq=Bruce+Timm+kid-friendly+Batman+Beyond+cartoon#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate= July 18, 2010}}</ref> It is also the first ''Batman'' series to portray the hero as a teenager. [[IGN]] named the show 40th on their list of "Top 100 Animated TV Series."<ref name="ign"/> The premise of ''Batman Beyond'' has been used in [[Batman Beyond (comics)|various comic book stories]] published by DC Comics, including an ongoing series beginning in 2011.

==Story==
{{See also|List of Batman Beyond episodes}}
The pilot episode begins in the year 2019. [[Batman]], despite his aging, continues to fight crime in a new high-tech [[Batsuit]]. In the rescue of a kidnapped heiress, Batman suffers a mild heart attack and, at risk of being beaten to death by one of the kidnappers, is forced to betray a lifelong principle by threatening to use a gun. Ultimately, Bruce reluctantly decides that his time as Batman is over and vows "never again" as he shuts down the [[Batcave]]. By this time, his allies ([[Alfred Pennyworth]], [[Lucius Fox]], [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner James Gordon]], [[Leslie Thompkins]], [[Renee Montoya]] and [[Harvey Bullock (comics)|Harvey Bullock]]) have died of natural causes or retired. His partners [[Dick Grayson]], [[Barbara Gordon]], [[Selina Kyle]] and [[Tim Drake]] are still alive and have grown up and left or had falling-outs after their retirement from their alter-egos. All of his enemies such as [[Joker (comics)|The Joker]], [[Harley Quinn]], [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]], [[Two-Face]], [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], [[The Riddler]], [[Clayface]], and [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]] are either retired, in prison, in exile, or dead, and he has severed his ties with the [[Justice League]].

The story fast-forwards 20 years later to 2039 in [[Gotham City|Neo-Gotham]], a futuristic [[megalopolis (city type)|megalopolis]] featuring staggering high rises and flying vehicles. Bruce is now an old man and a recluse living in bitter isolation in [[Wayne Manor]], with no companion but his guard dog [[Ace the Bat-Hound|Ace]]. [[Batman (Terry McGinnis)|Terry McGinnis]] is an athletic 16-year-old high school student and reformed troublemaker with a deeply ingrained sense of personal justice. Living on poor terms with his father Warren McGinnis, Terry disobeys his curfew one night to meet up with his girlfriend Dana Tan, only to incur the wrath of a group of the [[Jokerz]] gang harassing them. A high-speed motorcycle chase between Terry and the Jokerz leads them to the grounds of Wayne Manor, where they run into the elderly Bruce Wayne. Bruce and Terry fend off the Jokerz side-by-side, but the exertion aggravates Bruce's heart condition. Terry helps Bruce back to the manor and, while exploring the mansion, stumbles upon the entrance to the Batcave and thus discovers Bruce's secrets, only to be chased out by a recovered and angered Bruce.

Terry returns home to discover that his father has been murdered, apparently by the vengeful Jokerz. Soon after, though, he discovers that his father had stumbled onto information about the production of [[biological warfare|illegal chemical weapons]] by [[Derek Powers]] through [[Wayne Enterprises|Wayne-Powers]] (Wayne Enterprises now merged with Powers's company) and that the man actually responsible for his father's murder is Powers's personal assistant/bodyguard Mr. Fixx. Terry goes to Bruce for help but he refuses, feeling he is too old and too weak to be of any use and instead tells Terry to take the evidence to Barbara Gordon (who has become the new Police Commissioner). After the evidence of the illegal weapon production is forcibly taken from Terry by Derek Powers, Terry subsequently steals the Batsuit, intending to bring Powers to justice. Bruce initially opposes all of Terry's efforts and vehemently demands he return the suit but Terry convinces Bruce to let him take on the Batman mantle, partially by drawing on the fact they both lost a parent to criminals, and subsequently defeats Mr. Fixx. During the battle, Powers is exposed to the chemical and forced to flee into hiding to receive treatment which subsequently mutates him into a radiation-emitting entity, though he uses artificial skin to hide the accident. Realizing that crime and corruption are running rampant in Gotham without Batman's presence, Bruce offers Terry the chance to assume the role of Batman in addition working as Bruce's chauffer and assistant so that Terry can support his family.

The new Batman soon develops his own rogues gallery, with both new villains (the radiation-emitting metahuman Blight; seductive shape-shifter [[Inque]]; hypnotist [[Spellbinder (DC Comics)|Spellbinder]]; [[Sonic weapon|sound weaponizer]] Shriek; deadly assassin Curare; insane terrorist Mad Stan; cybernetically-enhanced African [[Big-game hunting|big game hunter]] Stalker; nerdy [[psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] Willie Watt; and a new version of the [[Royal Flush Gang]]) as well as some of the original Batman's old foes, such as a rejuvenated [[Mr. Freeze]]; [[Bane (comics)|Bane]]'s strength-enhancing Venom substance reborn as slap-on patches; the [[longevity|longevous]] [[Ra's al Ghul]]; and somewhat inevitably, the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] himself.

Terry also makes allies in Neo-Gotham, such as the 17-year-old computer [[genius]] [[Maxine "Max" Gibson]] discovering Batman's secret identity and helps Terry with everything from [[Hacker (computer security)|computer hacking]] to [[babysitting]], and police commissioner Barbara Gordon initially unhappy about another person following in Bruce's dark and dangerous steps (though she admits the city needs Batman and that Terry could not be deterred from being Batman any more than she could have been from being Batgirl).

==Crossovers==
In the third season of ''Batman Beyond'', a two-part episode "The Call" featured (for the first time) the futuristic [[Justice League]], a [[springboard]] for [[Bruce Timm]]'s next series ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]''. The setting and characters of ''Batman Beyond'' were also briefly revived in the 2004 ''[[Static Shock]]'' episode "[[Future Shock (Static Shock)|Future Shock]]" in which [[Static (DC Comics)|Static]] is accidentally transported 40 years into the future.

''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' revisited the ''Batman Beyond'' world twice in 2005, first in "[[The Once and Future Thing]]" (Part 2), which featured [[Batman]], [[Wonder Woman]] and [[John Stewart (comics)|Green Lantern]] being transported 50 years into the future to stop [[Chronos (comics)|a time-travelling villain]] with the help of the future Justice League (Batman II, a future Static and [[Warhawk (Batman Beyond)|Warhawk]]). The second time occurred during the [[Epilogue (Justice League Unlimited episode)|second season finale]], where Terry McGinnis's true origin is learned in a story meant to be the de facto [[series finale]] for ''Batman Beyond''.

===Series finale===
The ''Justice League Unlimited'' episode [[Epilogue (Justice League Unlimited episode)|"Epilogue"]], the unofficial series finale, reveals that Bruce Wayne is actually Terry McGinnis's biological father. The story, set fifteen years after Terry became the new Batman, centers on Terry tracking down a geriatric [[Amanda Waller]], who reveals his origins to him.

She explains through [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] that, even though she trusted and respected Batman, she was aware of him growing older and slower, thus accepting the idea of either Bruce retiring or being killed at some point. Finding the idea of a world without Batman unacceptable, Waller used her [[Project Cadmus]] connections to gather the technology for "Project Batman Beyond", whose goal was to physically create a new Batman, starting with a secretly collected sample of Bruce Wayne's DNA. After finding a young Neo-Gotham couple--the McGinnis'-- with psychological profiles nearly identical to those of Bruce's parents, a [[nanotechnology|nanotech]] solution was injected into Warren McGinnis to rewrite his [[reproductive]] material. The eventual result was his wife Mary McGinnis giving birth to Terry, a child sharing the genetic traits of his mother and Bruce Wayne.

When Terry was 8 years old, Waller employed an elderly [[Phantasm (comics)|Phantasm]] (Andrea Beaumont, Bruce's  ex-fiancÃ©e, [[Batman: Mask of the Phantasm|whose exit]] from Bruce's life became one of the reasons why he became Batman in the first place) as an assassin to kill Terry's family, hoping the [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] would put him on the path to becoming Batman. However, Beaumont could not commit the act, arguing that Bruce would never resort to murder to achieve his goals. Waller eventually conceded that Beaumont had been right and abolished the project altogether. Nine years afterward, Warren would be murdered, and Terry would meet Bruce by happenstance--resulting Terry to becoming Batman's successor. Waller concludes by reminding Terry that he is Bruce's son, not his clone, and that despite the circumstances of his existence, he still has [[free will]] to live out his own life; Terry comes to terms with his revelations, and continues in being Batman. With a new sense of purpose, Terry plans to propose to Dana, while continuing his life of crimefighting.

Whether Bruce was the genetic father of [[List_of_Batman_Beyond_characters#Terry.27s_family|Matt McGinnis]] as well was not clearly established in-story, since nothing was stated as to the longevity of the alterations made to Warren McGinnis's DNA; however, the series' creators have said that this is the case. The fact that Matt McGinnis was born with black hair despite both of his biological parents having red hair is also an indicator of Bruce Wayne's dominant DNA.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jl.toonzone.net/episode50/episode50.htm |title=Epilogue |publisher=Jl.toonzone.net |accessdate=January 2, 2011}}</ref>

==Spinoff==
''Batman Beyond'' spun off an animated series called ''[[The Zeta Project]]'', featuring a revamped version of the [[synthoid]] Zeta from the ''Batman Beyond'' episode "Zeta". Batman would guest-star in the episode "Shadows". The supervillain Stalker was to have appeared in ''The Zeta Project'' episode "Taffy Time" but did not make it.<ref name="worldsfinestonline1">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/zetaproject/backstage/kuhr.php |title=The World's Finest - The Zeta Project |publisher=Worldsfinestonline.com |accessdate=January 2, 2011}}</ref> The second season episode "Ro's Gift" has an appearance made by the [[Brain Trust]] from the ''Batman Beyond'' episode "Mind Games". [[Batman (Terry McGinnis)|Terry McGinnis/Batman]] was originally slated to appear in this episode as well, but was cut since [[Bruce Timm]] and company were working on ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]''.<ref name="worldsfinestonline1"/>

===Toys===
In 2000, [[Burger King]] had ''Batman Beyond'' toys in their kids' meals.

===Films===
A [[direct-to-video]] feature film, ''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]'', was released on December 12, 2000. The original release was censored for elements of violence and death, though a second, uncensored version was later released.

Among the live-action films proposed between the critical failure of [[Batman & Robin (film)|''Batman & Robin'']] and the [[Batman Begins|reboot of the ''Batman'' franchise]] was a live-action ''Batman Beyond'' feature, to be written by [[Paul Dini]]. In August 2000, Warner Bros. announced that it was developing a live action [[film adaptation]] of the TV series ''Batman Beyond'' with [[Boaz Yakin]] attached to co-write and direct. The TV series' creators, Dini and [[Alan Burnett]], were hired to write a screenplay for the feature film, with author [[Neal Stephenson]] consulting the duo.<ref>{{cite news |last=Harris |first=Dana | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117785384.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | title=There's new 'Batman' in WB's belfry | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=August 22, 2000 | accessdate=May 17, 2007 }}</ref> By July 2001, a first draft was turned in to the studio, and the writers were waiting to see if a rewrite would be needed.

The first appearance of the Terry McGinnis version of Batman in a video game is in the [[Nintendo 64]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], and [[Game Boy Color]] video game ''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker (video game)|Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]''.

The ''Batman Beyond'' Batsuit appears as an alternate costume in ''[[Justice League Heroes]]'' and as downloadable content in ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]'' and ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]''.

A "Batman of the Future" character pack featuring the Terry McGinnis Batman with all its trademark gadgets (such as the flying suit and the ability to turn invisible), other ''Batman Beyond'' era characters were revealed to be PS3/PS4 exclusive DLC for ''[[Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2014/09/26/the-batman-of-the-future-is-coming-to-lego-batman-3-in-europe/|title=The Batman of the Future is coming to LEGO Batman 3 in Europe|publisher=VG247.com}}</ref>

[[Rocksteady Studios]] created their own unique take on the ''Batman Beyond'' Batsuit for ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]'' as a pre-order bonus along with ''The Dark Knight Returns'' Batsuit titled "Gotham's Future Pack".

===Animation===
In April 2014, a ''Batman Beyond'' short by [[Darwyn Cooke]] premiered at [[WonderCon]]. The short, which saw Will Friedle and Kevin Conroy reprise their roles from the show, sees Batman (Terry McGinnis) battle a Batman android in the Batcave, resembling the design from ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', with help from the elderly Bruce Wayne and the [[Batmobile]]. Once defeated, Batman and Bruce look out to see and prepare to fight seven additional invading androids resembling the designs from ''[[Beware the Batman]]'', ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'', ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'', [[Batman (1989 film)|''Batman'' (1989 film)]], [[Batman (TV series)|''Batman'' (TV series)]], and the original design by [[Bill Finger]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://movies.yahoo.com/blogs/movie-news/batman-beyond-75th-anniversary-exclusive-short-darwyn-cooke-214026355.html |title=Spot the Easter Eggs in a New Batman Film for His 75th Anniversary |last=McDaniel |first=Matt |publisher=Yahoo! |date=April 18, 2014 |accessdate=April 20, 2014}}</ref>

In ''[[Teen Titans Go! (TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'' episode "Sandwich Thief", [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] travels to the future to interrogate [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]].
