'''''Batman Beyond''''' (known as '''''Batman of the Future''''' in [[Europe]], [[Japan]] and [[Latin America]]) is an [[United States of America|American]] [[animated television series]] created by [[Warner Bros. Animation]] in collaboration with [[DC Comics]] as a continuation of the [[Batman]] legacy.<ref>{{cite news|title= A History of Batman on TV|work= IGN|date=|url= http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/891/891807p8.html|accessdate=2010-08-15}}</ref> Depicting teenager [[Batman (Terry McGinnis)|Terry McGinnis]] as a new Batman in a futuristic [[Gotham City]] under the tutelage of an elderly [[Bruce Wayne]], the series began airing on January 10, 1999, and ended its run on December 18, 2001. After 52 episodes spanning three seasons and one [[direct-to-video]] [[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker|film]] (which seems like an unofficial [[series finale]]), the series was put on hold for the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' animated series despite the network having announced plans for a fourth season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0102/09/index.htm |title=Comics Continuum |publisher=Comics Continuum |date=2001-02-09 |accessdate=2011-01-02}}</ref>

''Batman Beyond'' is set in the chronological future of the [[DC Animated Universe]] (despite being released before ''[[Static Shock]]'', ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' and ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''). 

''Batman Beyond'' is said to explore the darker side of many [[Batman]] projects, playing on key elements such as emotions, personal relations, fear of the unknown, technological malfunctions and the disturbing psychological elements of the character of Bruce Wayne. As such, it was considerably darker than most other children's programs at the time, although producer [[Bruce Timm]] recalls it was conceived as a kid-friendly Batman cartoon.<ref name="mmv3">{{cite book |title= Modern Masters Volume 3: Bruce Timm |last= Nolen-Weathington |first= Eric |authorlink= |date= June 1, 2004 |publisher= TwoMorrows Publishing |location= |isbn= 978-1-893905-30-6 |page= 67 |page= 128 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=EMwn_4llWK0C&pg=PA67&lpg=PA67&dq=Bruce+Timm+kid-friendly+Batman+Beyond+cartoon&source=bl&ots=IftapUztOL&sig=QPM74-j14tsx-1BMXz__vaSvj8o&hl=en&ei=S2pDTMWIDJHUtQOrvOy1DA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CDEQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate= 2010-07-18}}</ref> It is also the first ''Batman'' series to portray the hero as a teenager. [[IGN]] named the show 40th on their list of "Top 100 Animated TV Series."<ref name="ign"/>  The continuity of ''Batman Beyond'' has made [[Batman Beyond (comics)|various crossovers]] into comic books published by DC Comics, including an ongoing series beginning in 2011.

''Batman Beyond'' is currently airing on the UK channel [[Kix!]] under the title of ''Batman of the Future''.

==Story==
{{See also|List of Batman Beyond episodes}}
The pilot episode, titled "Rebirth," begins in 2019, where an aging [[Batman]], equipped with a high-tech [[Batsuit]], takes on the kidnappers of Bunny Vreeland (the daughter of Veronica Vreeland, one of Bruce Wayne's girlfriends). During the battle, Batman suffers a mild [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] which leaves him unable to fight, forcing him to betray a lifelong principle by threatening a criminal with a [[gun]]. By this point, Bruce's allies [[Alfred Pennyworth]], [[Lucius Fox]], [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]], [[Leslie Thompkins]], [[Renee Montoya]] and [[Harvey Bullock (comics)|Detective Bullock]], as well as most of his [[rogues gallery]], have died. It is implied by virtue of his lengthy career as Batman, and his retaining the [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], [[Nightwing]] and [[Batgirl]] costumes, that a tragic occurrence had transpired, causing Bruce to sever his ties with the [[Justice League]] and forbid his allies to assume their alter egos (the events which caused all of this are revealed in ''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]''). Ultimately, Bruce reluctantly decides that his time as Batman is over and vows "never again" as he shuts down the [[Batcave]].

The story fast-forwards to 2039 in [[Gotham City|Neo-Gotham]], a futuristic megalopolis featuring staggering high rises and flying vehicles. Bruce is now a recluse living in bitter isolation in [[Wayne Manor]] with no companion but his guard dog, [[Ace the Bat-Hound|Ace]]. [[Batman (Terry McGinnis)|Terry McGinnis]] is an athletic 17-year-old [[high school]] student and reformed troublemaker with a deeply ingrained sense of personal justice, but is currently not on good terms with his father Warren, a scientist for a merged [[Wayne Enterprises|Wayne-Powers]]. His first act in the series is to defend a fellow passenger on a commuter rail from a member of the [[Jokerz]] gang. After trying to defend his girlfriend Dana Tan from a gang of Jokerz, Terry engages in a high-speed chase which leads to the grounds of Wayne Manor, where he runs into the elderly Bruce Wayne. Bruce and Terry fend off the Jokerz side-by-side, but the exertion aggravates Bruce's heart condition. Terry helps Bruce back to the manor and, after Bruce nods off for a bit, stumbles upon the entrance to the Batcave, only to be chased out by a recovered and angered Bruce.

Terry returns home to discover that his father has been [[murder]]ed, apparently by the vengeful Jokerz. Soon after, he finds out that Warren possessed knowledge of [[biological warfare|illegal chemical weapons]] being produced by Wayne-Powers, and that the man actually responsible for his father's murder is Mr. Fixx, the bodyguard of Wayne-Powers CEO [[Derek Powers]]. Terry goes to Bruce for help, but Bruce refuses, feeling he is too old and too weak to be of any use. Terry then "borrows" the Batsuit, intending to bring Powers to justice. Bruce initially opposes all of Terry's efforts and vehemently demands he return the suit (at one point paralyzing the suit while Terry is wearing it and in the midst of combat), but Terry convinces Bruce to let him take on the Batman mantle, partially by drawing on the fact they both lost a parent to criminals, and subsequently defeats Mr. Fixx. Realizing that crime and corruption are running rampant in Gotham without Batman's presence, Bruce offers Terry the chance to assume the role of Batman.

Terry's first foe is Powers, now mutated through a combination of deadly chemical gas and radiation into the radioactive monstrosity Blight. Terry soon comes to develop his own rogues gallery: the seductive shape-shifter [[Inque]]; the hypnotist [[Spellbinder (DC Comics)|Spellbinder]]; the bitter, deaf sound expert Shriek; the deadly assassin Curare; the insane terrorist Mad Stan; the cybernetically-enhanced [[Africa]]n big game hunter Stalker; the nerdy [[psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] Willie Watt; a new version of the [[Royal Flush Gang]]; and the Jokerz, a gang idolizing the notorious [[Joker (comics)|Clown Prince of Crime]]. On occasion, Terry is also forced to face his mentor's old foes, such as a rejuvenated [[Mr. Freeze]]; common criminals using [[Bane (comics)|Bane]]'s strength-enhancing Venom substance in the form of slap-on patches; the [[longevity|longevous]] [[Ra's al Ghul]]; and even the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] himself.

Terry also makes allies in Neo-Gotham: [[Maxine "Max" Gibson]] is a 17-year-old computer [[genius]] who discovers Batman's secret identity and helps Terry with everything from [[Hacker (computer security)|computer hacking]] to [[babysitting]]. Max plays an integral part in Batman's war on crime, essentially as Terry's ersatz [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]]. Terry also forms a begrudging partnership with [[Gotham City Police Department]] Commissioner [[Barbara Gordon]], the former Batgirl. She is unhappy with the idea of a new Batman, especially a teenager, as she is still haunted by the same subsequent events that led Bruce to retire. However, she knows that she and the police under her command need Batman, whether she likes it or not. Furthermore, she understands from personal experience that she cannot deter Terry any more than she could have been deterred from being Batgirl. She is implied to have been shot in her time as Batgirl, as she mentions to Bruce that the Batgirl costume has had the bullet holes repaired.

== Crossovers ==
In the third season of ''Batman Beyond'', a two-part story entitled "The Call" featured (for the first time) the futuristic Justice League, a [[springboard]] for [[Bruce Timm]]'s next series ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]''. The setting and characters of ''Batman Beyond'' were also briefly revived in 2004 for [[Future Shock (Static Shock)|an episode]] of ''[[Static Shock]]'' in which [[Static (DC Comics)|Static]] is accidentally transported 40 years into the future.

''Justice League Unlimited'' revisited the world of ''Batman Beyond'' twice in 2005: The first time was in [[The Once and Future Thing|the first season finale]] which featured the Justice League ([[Batman]], [[Wonder Woman]] and [[Green Lantern]]) transported 50 years into the future to stop [[Chronos (comics)|a time-travelling villain]] with the help of the future Justice League Unlimited (Terry as Batman, a future Static and [[Warhawk (Batman Beyond)|Warhawk]]). The second time occurred during [[Epilogue (Justice League Unlimited episode)|the second season finale]] where Terry McGinnis's true secret origin is learned in a story meant to be the [[de facto]] [[series finale]] for this Batman's story.

=== Series finale ===
In the Justice League Unlimited episode [[Epilogue (Justice League Unlimited episode)|Epilogue]], set 15 years after ''Batman Beyond'', the unofficial series finale reveals that Bruce Wayne is actually Terry's biological father. The episode is told largely through [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] sequences. Over the years, [[Amanda Waller]] came to respect Batman and even trust him. As the years passed, she saw that he was getting older and slower. The thought of a world without Batman was unacceptable to her, so she decided to make a new one. She used her [[Project Cadmus|Cadmus]] connections to gather the technology for "Project Batman Beyond", and obtained Bruce's [[DNA]]. She found a young Neo-Gotham couple with psychological profiles nearly identical to those of Bruce's parents, and injected Warren McGinnis with a [[nanotechnology|nanotech]] solution programmed to re-write his [[reproductive]] material into an exact copy of Bruce's. A little over a year later, Mary McGinnis gave birth to Terry, a child with [[genetics]] from his mother and Bruce.

When Terry was 8 years old, Waller employed an elderly [[Andrea Beaumont]] (the enigmatic killer from ''[[Batman: Mask of the Phantasm]]'' and once Bruce's true love) as an assassin to kill Terry's family, hoping the [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] would put him on the path to becoming Batman. However, Beaumont could not commit the act, arguing that Batman would never resort to murder to achieve his goals. Waller eventually conceded that Beaumont had been right and made no further attempts to push Terry into becoming Batman, although she also stated to Terry that "when making a Batman, genetics is only half the story. The rest is tragedy" in an attempt to explain why she believed that doing this would put him on the path to becoming Batman. [[Derek Powers]] would later have Warren murdered, resulting in Terry becoming the new Batman. As the death of Warren proved soon afterwards, she was correct.

Fifteen years after Terry became the new Batman, Bruce's [[kidney]]s fail and doctors need a tissue donor to [[Cloning|clone]] him new ones. When Terry shows a perfect histo-compatibility match with Bruce, he runs a DNA test and finds out that half his DNA is from Bruce. Terry assumes that Bruce set the whole thing up, using some old Cadmus nanotechnology to have Terry's [[gene]]s rewritten to match Bruce's, similar to what the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] did to [[Tim Drake]]. He tracks Waller down and she reveals his origins to him. Waller also reminds Terry that he is Bruce's son, not his clone, and that despite his genetics, he still has [[free will]] and makes his own choice in becoming Batman.

Whether Bruce was the genetic father of Terry's younger brother Matt as well was not clearly established, as nothing was stated as to the longevity of the alterations made to Warren McGinnis; however, the series' creators have said that this is most likely the case.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jl.toonzone.net/episode50/episode50.htm |title=Epilogue |publisher=Jl.toonzone.net |date= |accessdate=2011-01-02}}</ref>
