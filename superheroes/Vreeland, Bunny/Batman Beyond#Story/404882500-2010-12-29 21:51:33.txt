'''''Batman Beyond''''', also known as '''''Batman of the Future''''', is an Emmy Award-winning American [[animated television series]] created by [[The WB Television Network]] in collaboration with [[DC Comics]] and [[Warner Bros. Animation]] as a continuation of the [[Batman]] legacy.<ref>{{cite news|title= A History of Batman on TV|work= IGN|date=|url= http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/891/891807p8.html|accessdate=2010-08-15}}</ref> It began airing on January 10, 1999, and ended its run on December 14, 2002. After 52 episodes spanning three seasons and one [[direct-to-video]] [[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker|film]], the series was put on hold for the new ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'' animated series despite the network having announced plans for a fourth season.<ref>http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0102/09/index.htm</ref>  However, there was a short-lived spin-off, ''[[The Zeta Project]]''. In ''The Zeta Project''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s first season episode "Shadows", there is a [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] with ''Batman Beyond''; in this [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]], the story takes place between the episode "Countdown" and the series finale "Unmasked." 

''Batman Beyond'' is set in the chronological future of the [[DC animated universe]], although it was released before ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'', ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', and ''[[Static Shock]]''. Some characters from the series appeared two years later in "[[Future Shock (Static Shock)|Future Shock]]", an episode of ''Static Shock'', and then again in "[[The Once and Future Thing]]", episodes of ''Justice League Unlimited.''  The character of [[Terry McGinnis]] was revisited a final time in the ''JLU'' episode "[[Epilogue (Justice League Unlimited)|Epilogue]]", which tells much about the future of Batman.

''Batman Beyond'' is said to exploit the darker side of many ''Batman'' projects, playing on key elements such as emotions, personal relations, the fear of the unknown and technological malfunctions. As such, it was considerably darker than most other children's programs at the time, although producer Bruce Timm recalls it was conceived as a kid-friendly Batman cartoon.<ref name="mmv3">{{cite book |title= Modern Masters Volume 3: Bruce Timm |last= Nolen-Weathington |first= Eric |authorlink= |date= June 1, 2004 |publisher= TwoMorrows Publishing |location= |isbn= 978-1893905306 |page= 67 |page= 128 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=EMwn_4llWK0C&pg=PA67&lpg=PA67&dq=Bruce+Timm+kid-friendly+Batman+Beyond+cartoon&source=bl&ots=IftapUztOL&sig=QPM74-j14tsx-1BMXz__vaSvj8o&hl=en&ei=S2pDTMWIDJHUtQOrvOy1DA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CDEQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate= 2010-07-18}}</ref> It is also the first ''Batman'' series to portray the hero as a teenager. [[IGN]] named the show 40th on their list of "Top 100 Animated TV Series".<ref name="ign" />

Batman Beyond began airing on [[The Hub (TV network)|The Hub network]] in October 2010. The show is currently airing on the UK channel [[Kix!]] under the title of Batman of the Future.

==Story==
The pilot episode begins in 2019, where an aging [[Batman]], equipped with a high-tech [[Batsuit]], takes on the kidnappers of Bunny Vreeland (the daughter of Veronica Vreeland, one of Bruce Wayne's many girlfriends).  During the battle, Batman suffers a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] which leaves him unable to fight, forcing him to betray a life-long principle by threatening a criminal with a [[gun]]. By this point, [[Bruce Wayne]]'s assistants, [[Alfred Pennyworth]] and [[Lucius Fox]], had both passed away.  It is implied by virtue of his lengthy career as Batman, and his retaining the [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], [[Nightwing]] and [[Batgirl]] costumes, that a tragic occurrence had transpired that caused Bruce to sever his ties with the [[Justice League]] and forbid his allies to assume their alter-egos (the events which caused all of this are revealed in ''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]''). Afterward, Bruce then decides that his time as Batman is over and vows "never again" and he shutters the Batcave. 

The story fast-forwards to 2039 in [[Gotham City|Neo-Gotham]], a futuristic megalopolis equipped with staggering high rises and flying vehicles. Bruce Wayne is a recluse living in bitter isolation with no companion but his guard dog, [[Ace the Bat-Hound|Ace]]. [[Batman (Terry McGinnis)|Terry McGinnis]] is an athletic 16-year-old high school student and reformed troublemaker with a deeply ingrained sense of personal justice. His first act in the series is to defend a fellow passenger on a commuter rail from a member of the [[Jokerz]] gang. After trying to defend his girlfriend from a gang of Jokerz, Terry engages in a high-speed chase which ends on the grounds of [[Wayne Manor]], where he runs into the elderly Bruce Wayne. Bruce and Terry fend off the Jokerz side-by-side, but the exertion aggravates Bruce's heart condition. Terry helps Bruce back to the manor, and, after Bruce nods off for a bit, stumbles upon the entrance to the [[Batcave]]. He is chased out by a recovered and angered Bruce.

Terry returns home to discover that his father had been [[murder]]ed, apparently by the vengeful Jokerz. Soon after, he finds out that the man actually responsible for the murder was Mr. Fixx, the bodyguard of [[Derek Powers]],—CEO of a merged Wayne-Powers and his father's employer—because he possessed knowledge of [[biological warfare|illegal chemical weapons]] being produced by Powers. Terry "borrows" the Batsuit, intending to bring Powers to justice. Bruce initially opposes his efforts and vehemently demands Terry return the suit (at one point paralyzing the suit while Terry is wearing it), but Terry convinces Bruce to let him take on the Batman mantle, and he subsequently defeats Mr. Fixx. Realizing that crime and corruption are running rampant in Gotham without Batman's presence, Bruce offers Terry the chance to assume the role of Batman.

Terry's first foe is Derek Powers, now mutated through a combination of deadly chemical gas and radiation into the radioactive monstrosity Blight. Terry soon comes to have his own [[rogues gallery]]: the seductive shape-shifter [[Inque]]; the hypnotist [[Spellbinder (DC Comics)|Spellbinder]]; the bitter, deaf sound expert [[Shriek (Batman Beyond)|Shriek]]; the deadly assassin Curare; the insane terrorist [[Mad Stan]]; the [[Africa]]n hunter [[Stalker (Batman Beyond)|Stalker]]; the nerdish Willie Watt; a new version of the [[Royal Flush Gang]]; and the [[Jokerz]], a gang idolizing the notorious [[Joker (comics)|Clown Prince of Crime]].  On occasion, Terry is also forced to face his mentor's old foes, such as the rejuvenated [[Mr. Freeze]]; common criminals using [[Bane (comics)|Bane]]'s strength-enhancing Venom substance in the form of slap-on patches; the [[immortality|immortal]] [[Ra's al Ghul]]; and, almost inevitably, the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] himself.

Bruce also reveals to Terry some details behind the death of [[Alfred Pennyworth]]. He explains that shortly before the incident in the first episode of Batman Beyond (where Bruce retires as Batman), Alfred had left [[Gotham City]] for [[England]] to attend his son's graduation at [[Oxford University]]. Despite Alfred's promise to return, he never did, and Bruce never hired another manservant. When asked by Terry as to why Alfred failed to return, Bruce typically refused to answer.

Terry also makes allies in Neo-Gotham: [[Maxine "Max" Gibson]] is a 17-year-old computer [[genius]] who discovers Batman's secret identity and helps Terry with everything from [[computer hacking]] to babysitting. Max plays an integral part in Batman's war on crime, essentially as Terry's ersatz [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]]. Terry also forms a begrudging partnership with Police Commissioner [[Barbara Gordon]], the former Batgirl. She is unhappy with the idea of a new Batman, especially a teenager, as she is still haunted by the same subsequent events that led Bruce to retire. However, she knows that she and the police under her command need Batman, whether she likes it or not. Furthermore, she understands from personal experience that she can not deter Terry any more than she could have been deterred from being Batgirl. Passing conversation between Barbara and Bruce suggests that, at the time of Batgirl's retirement, the suit had bullet holes in it that have since been repaired.

*'''[[Jokerz]]''': A violent street gang who dress and act out in the tradition of the infamous Joker. However, unlike the supervillain they emulate, they are merely teenage delinquents who enjoy vandalism and petty crime. They are usually apprehended by Batman quite easily, and serve as more of an irritation than a genuine threat.
**A separate group of these criminals were actually headed by the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] himself, and almost succeeded in destroying Gotham and the former Batman. The members includes:
***'''Dee Dee''': Both voiced by [[Melissa Joan Hart]]. Delia Dennis and Deidre Dennis are the identical twin sisters and teenage granddaughters of the apparently reformed [[Harley Quinn]] (voiced by [[Arleen Sorkin]]), the former henchgirl of the Joker.

He is led down a decidedly darker path by Derek Powers, who wants a return on his investment in Shreeve's research. He thus dubs him "Shriek", based on his special suit which allows him to generate destructive sound waves and manipulate [[sound]] in a wide variety of ways. During a fight with Batman, his suit is damaged, causing it to pick up sounds at such a high volume that Shreeve is rendered permanently [[deafness|deaf]]. Though he develops a special headset to hear normally, the incident drives him insane and vengeful against Batman. Voiced by [[Chris Mulkey]].
*'''Bombshell''': A member of the infamous Brain Trust, Bombshell possesses the ability to fire blast projectiles from her hand. It is also hinted that she has the ability to manipulate minds, although this is never truly revealed in the series. She is later apprehended by Batman and sent to jail. Voiced by [[Kate Jackson]].
*'''Repeller''': A supervillain who acquired an experimental suit that could repel matter, making him invulnerable to almost any type of damage. Eventually it was revealed that the villain is actually Dr. Suzuki, a man who was developing the technology for Wayne-Powers. Voiced by [[Gedde Watanabe]].

After he loses his job, he builds himself an arsenal of advanced weapons and body armor and becomes the supervillain Armory in order to make ends meet for his family, but is later thwarted by Batman. He later realizes the error of his ways and  assists Batman in defeating one of his employers before he is apparently sent to jail, although it is implied that his heroic actions will lead to a reduced sentence. In the 2010 comic book mini-series ''[[Batman Beyond (2010)|Batman Beyond]],'' he is killed by a masked serial killer who takes the identity of the villain [[Hush (comics)|Hush]] in front of his family.<ref>Batman Beyond #2 (July 2010)</ref>  Voiced by [[Dorian Harewood]].
*'''Ratboy''': Patrick Poundstone is a teenage runaway with ratlike features and an ability to telepathically control the city's rat population (similar to the DC Comics' universe villain [[Ratcatcher (comics)|Ratcatcher]]). It is noted that many have a tendency to call him Ratboy, because of his strange appearance. He develops an obsession with Dana, frequently sending her love letters and gifts. He later kidnaps Dana, taking her to his home in the sewers and confessing his love for her, but she rebuffs him, and he angrily commands an army of rats to kill her. After Batman saves her, he is caught in an explosion, and is presumed dead but Dana knows he is still alive. Voiced by [[Taran Noah Smith]].  
*'''Peek''': The host of "The Inside Peek", a popular tabloid newscast, Ian Peek uses a strange device that allows him to phase through solid objects, allowing him to uncover any celebrity's secrets and use them to boost ratings on his show. He nearly reveals both Terry and Bruce's secret lives as Batman, but due to his condition, (the device altered his body's molecular structure, making him permanently intangible) he ends up falling through the Earth's crust and into the planet's molten core. Voiced by [[Michael McKean]].
*'''[[Spellbinder (DC Comics)#Spellbinder in Batman Beyond|Spellbinder]]''': Ira Billings is a bitter and underpaid [[psychologist]] at Terry's high school who commits crimes using sophisticated [[virtual reality]] systems and his knowledge of the human mind as Spellbinder. Voiced by [[Jon Cypher]].

*'''Curaré''': A member of the [[Society of Assassins]] who wields a laser-sharpened [[scimitar]]. After Batman foils her attempt to assassinate Gotham's DA, she ends up becoming a target of the Society herself. Voiced by [[Melissa Disney]]. 
*'''Mad Stan''': A rabidly anti-government terrorist who rebels against what he sees as a corrupt system. His solution to any given problem is to "blow it up," and as such he is an expert in explosives. Voiced by (and resembles) [[Henry Rollins]].
*'''[[Joker (comics)|The Joker]]''': The evil and sly Clown Prince of Crime who only appears in the direct-to-video feature ''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]''. In this incarnation, Joker implants a copy of his DNA and personality in [[Tim Drake]], the second Robin (in the animated series universe), allowing him to transform Tim into a clone of himself every bit as ruthless and cunning as the original. During the movie, Joker's deepest ambition is revealed: to make Batman laugh as a sign of the respect he hungers for. Voiced again by [[Mark Hamill]].
*'''[[Mr. Freeze]]''': The tragic villain lives on as nothing but an immortal head preserved by Derek Powers. He is used as a test subject for an attempt to clone Powers a new body. However, Freeze's new body begins to get the same symptoms as his previous body, and after Power's scientist tries to eliminate Freeze to study the problem, he seeks revenge, facing off in one final battle with Blight and Batman. Voiced again by [[Michael Ansara]].
*'''[[Ra's al Ghul]]''': Living on by possessing his daughter [[Talia al Ghul|Talia]]'s body (effectively ending her life), the seemingly immortal Ra's intends to take over Bruce Wayne's body and gain control of Wayne Enterprises as a means of revenge against his former foe. Voiced again by [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]] and [[Olivia Hussey]] as Talia. 
*'''Dr. Able Cuvier''': A doctor who starts a trend in infusing animal biology, also known as "splicing," with human [[DNA]]. Using his research to commit crimes before ending up on the wanted list, Curvier mutates himself into a genetic [[Chimera (mythology)|chimera]] to battle Batman before getting a massive overdose that further mutates him into a monster. Though the technology of splicing becomes outlawed shortly after his presumed death, it continues to surface as an illegal [[subculture]] throughout the series. On the two-parter episode, "The Curse of the Kobra," it is hinted that he is a member of [[Kobra (comics)|Kobra]]. Voiced by [[Ian Buchanan]] of ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]'' fame.
*'''[[Bane (comics)|Bane]]''': In the years since Bruce Wayne's retirement from crimefighting, Bane's constant use of the super-steroid Venom has destroyed his body, leaving him a withered, wheelchair-bound husk of a man kept alive by the very drug that once gave him superhuman strength. When someone begins selling Venom-laced "slapper" patches to teenagers, it is discovered that Bane's personal attendant, '''Jackson Chappell''' (voiced by [[Larry Drake]]) now has the formula and is mass-producing it. During a battle with Batman,  Chappell overdoses on the slapper patches, apparently sending him into a coma.
*'''Charlie "Big Time" Bigelow''': Charlie Bigelow is a loudmouth hoodlum and a former friend of Terry McGinnis. Three years prior to Terry becoming Batman, Charlie was arrested for burglary and sentenced to three years in prison. It is revealed that Terry was also arrested during the burglary, but avoided prison because he was underage at the time, and that Terry's early life of petty crime was largely the result of Charlie's negative influence. Charlie attempts to reconnect with Terry after he is released, but is rebuffed due to his continuing criminal behavior.  Charlie later becomes involved with a gang of thieves-for-hire who plan to rob a Wayne-Powers research lab to steal an experimental chemical for a rival company. During the robbery, Terry (as Batman) intervenes. Charlie is exposed to the chemical during the fight, and later mutates into a deformed, super-strong giant, an event which leaves Terry wracked with guilt. Voiced by [[Stephen Baldwin]] (pre-mutation)  and [[Clancy Brown]] (post-mutation).
*'''The Royal Flush Gang''': A crime family of five members; the husband and wife, Mr. and Mrs. Walker as "King" (Voiced by [[George Lazenby]]) and "Queen" (Voiced by [[Amanda Donohoe]] and later [[Sarah Douglas]]), their daughter Ten (Melanie Walker) (Voiced by [[Olivia d'Abo]]), their son Jack (Jack Walker) (Voiced by [[Scott Cleverdon]] and later [[Nicholas Guest]]) and their bodyguard Ace (an android). Melanie develops a relationship with Terry, similar to the original Batman's relationship with Catwoman.
*'''Willie Watt''': A nerd at Hamilton Hill  High who seeks revenge on his classmates and his father. He controlled a robot called the GoLeM (Galvanized Lifting Machine). But it was destroyed by Batman and he was sent to a county juvenile for 3 years. However, his experience with GoLeM caused him to develop a [[telekinetic]] ability. Voiced by [[Scott McAfee]]

==Reception==
While the idea of ''Batman Beyond'' seemed as if it was "not a proper continuation of the legacy of the Dark Knight",<ref name="ign" /> it gathered quite a lot of acclaim after its release.  The show was nominated for four [[Daytime Emmy Awards]], one of which it won in 2001. In addition, the show was nominated for five [[Annie Awards]] and won two of those nominations in 1999 and 2001.<ref name="imdb">[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0147746/awards IMDB], Batman Beyond's awards.</ref>

In 2009, [[IGN]].com named ''Batman Beyond'' the fortieth-best animated television series of all time.<ref name="ign">[http://tv.ign.com/top-100-animated-tv-series/40.html IGN], Top 100 Animated Series.</ref>

===Spinoffs===
''Batman Beyond'' spun off an animated series called ''[[The Zeta Project]]'', featuring a revamped version of the [[synthoid]] Zeta from the ''Batman Beyond'' episode "Zeta." Batman would guest star in the episode "Shadows." The supervillain [[Stalker (Batman Beyond)|Stalker]] was to have appeared in ''The Zeta Project'' episode "Taffy Time," but did not make it.<ref name="worldsfinestonline1">http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/zetaproject/backstage/kuhr.php</ref> The second season episode, "Ro's Gift," has an appearance made by the [[Brain Trust]] from the ''Batman Beyond'' episode "Mind Games." [[Terry McGinnis|Terry McGinnis/Batman]] was originally slated to appear in this episode as well, but was cut since [[Bruce Timm]] and company were working on ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]''.<ref name="worldsfinestonline1"/>

===Post-series crossovers: 2004–2005===
In the third season of ''Batman Beyond'', a two-part story entitled "The Call", which featured (for the first time) the futuristic [[Justice League Unlimited]] helped to form an early basis for [[Bruce Timm]]'s next series, ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'', which was in turn succeeded by ''Justice League Unlimited''. The setting and characters of ''Batman Beyond'' were also briefly revived in 2004 for an episode of ''[[Static Shock]]'' in which [[Static (DC Comics)|Static]] is accidentally transported 40 years into the future.

''Justice League Unlimited'' revisited the world of ''Batman Beyond'' twice in 2005. The first time featured [[Batman]], [[Wonder Woman]] and [[Green Lantern]] transported 50 years into the future to stop a time-travelling villain with the help of the future ''Justice League Unlimited'' cast, including [[Terry McGinnis]] as Batman and a future Static. The second time occurred during the episode "[[Epilogue (Justice League Unlimited episode)|Epilogue]]", where the true secret origin of the future Batman is learned in a story meant to be the [[de facto]] [[series finale]] for this Batman's story.

Set 15 years after the conclusion of ''Batman Beyond'', ''Epilogue'' reveals that [[Bruce Wayne]] is actually [[Terry McGinnis]]' biological father. The episode is told largely through [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] sequences.

Over the years, [[Amanda Waller]] came to respect [[Batman]] and even trust him. As the years passed, she saw that he was getting older and slower. The thought of a world without Batman was unacceptable to her, so she decided to make a new one. She used her [[Project Cadmus|Cadmus]] connections to gather the technology for "Project Batman Beyond", and obtained Bruce Wayne's [[DNA]]. She found a young Neo Gotham couple with psychological profiles nearly identical to those of Bruce's parents, and injected [[Warren & Mary McGinnis|Warren McGinnis]] with a [[nanotechnology|nanotech]] solution programmed to re-write his [[reproductive]] material into an exact copy of Bruce Wayne's. A little over a year later, Mary McGinnis gave birth to Terry, a child with [[Genetics|genetic]]s from his mother and Bruce.

When Terry was 8 years-old, Waller employed an elderly [[Andrea Beaumont]] (the enigmatic killer from ''[[Batman: Mask of the Phantasm]]'' and once Bruce Wayne's true love) as an assassin to kill Terry's family, hoping the [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] would put him on the path to becoming Batman. However, Beaumont could not commit the act, arguing that Batman would never resort to murder to achieve his goals. Waller, however, conceded that Beaumont had been right, and made no further attempts to push Terry into becoming Batman, although she also stated to Terry that "when making a Batman, genetics is only half the story. The rest is tragedy" in an attempt to explain why she believed that doing this would put him on the path to becoming Batman. [[Derek Powers]] would later have Warren murdered, resulting in Terry becoming the new Batman. As the death of Warren proved soon afterwards, she was correct.

Fifteen years after Terry became the new Batman, Bruce's [[kidney]]s fail and doctors need a tissue donor to [[Cloning|clone]] him new ones. When Terry shows a perfect histo-compatibility match with Bruce, he runs a DNA test and found out that half his DNA was from Bruce. Terry assumes that Bruce set the whole thing up, using some old Cadmus nanotechnology to have Terry's [[gene]]s rewritten to match Bruce's, similar to what the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] did to [[Tim Drake]]. He tracks Waller down, and she reveals his origins to him. Waller also reminds Terry that he is Bruce's son, not his clone, and that despite his genetics he still has [[free will]] and makes his own choice in becoming Batman. 

Whether Bruce was the genetic father of Terry's younger brother Matt as well was not clearly established, as nothing was stated as to the longevity of the alterations made to Warren McGinnis; however, the series' creators have said that this is most likely the case.<ref>http://jl.toonzone.net/episode50/episode50.htm</ref> Matt and Terry both have black hair, but are the sons of two red-haired people – a genetic improbability as [[red hair]] is [[recessive trait|recessive]], and requires a gene from both parents in order to present as a [[phenotype]].

===DCAU tie-in===
[[Image:Batmanbeyondminiseries03.jpg|thumb|Cover art by [[Bruce Timm]] from the ''Batman Beyond'' comic book miniseries, depicting [[Terry McGinnis|Batman]] battling [[Derek Powers|Blight]].]]
After an initial 6-issues [[limited series]] released in March 1999, ''Batman Beyond'' had its own [[comic book series]], running through November 1999 until October 2001, for a total of 24 issues. They were set in the same world of the show and aimed at younger readers.

Originally, ''Batman Beyond'' #3 (the monthly series) was to focus on the Terrific Trio from the episode "Heroes." The story would have 2-D Man and Magma trying to revive their former teammate, Freon. It was rejected due to their resemblance to the [[Fantastic Four]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/beyond/guides/comic/01.php |title=The World's Finest}}</ref>

Terry also appeared in ''Superman Adventures'' #64. The story has Terry/Batman traveling to the present and teaming up with [[Superman]] against a futuristic version of [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]].

====Collected Editions====
* '''Batman Beyond''': Reprints #1-6 of the miniseries.
* '''DC Comics Presents Batman Beyond #1''': Reprints #13-14 an #21-22 of the monthly series.[http://www.tfaw.com/Profile/DC-Comics-Presents-Batman-Beyond-1___372594]

===DCU cameos===
More recently, in ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' #22 (written by [[Jeph Loeb]]), a Batman wearing the ''Beyond'' costume appears, making his first foray into the regular [[DC Comics]] continuity. The plot involves [[Bizarro]] being transported to an alternate version of [[Gotham City]]. It would appear from #23 that this Batman is someone named "Tim" (presumably [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Tim Drake]]). However, the writers admitted to the mistake of misnaming the character,{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} and although the name was rumored to be changed to "Terry" in the trade paperback, it still reads "Tim" (see first page of "Smoke and Mirrors" chapter in the trade paperback). Furthermore, the packaging for the action figure created by DC Direct based on this appearance in Superman/Batman also erroneously identifies Batman Beyond as Tim Drake instead of Terry McGinnis. Another oddity is the [[Batplane|Batwing]] pictured is the version from ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', not ''Batman Beyond''. Whether this is the regular [[DC Comics universe|DC universe]] or a parallel one is still to be seen. It is possible that this may be an alternate reality as the same story has [[Batzarro]] transported to the world of ''[[Superman: Red Son]]'', an [[Elseworlds]] [[communism|communist]] version of [[Superman]].

On March 3, 2007, [[Dan DiDio]] announced that Terry McGinnis may be showing up in the DCU sometime that year.<ref>[http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0703/03/dcnationpanel.htm Comics Continuum by Rob Allstetter: Saturday, March 3, 2007]</ref> A version of Terry appeared in ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]'' #21, as an inhabitant of [[List of DC Multiverse worlds|Earth-12]].<ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?p=4800627&posted=1 COUNTING DOWN: CARLIN & BEDARD ON COUNTDOWN #22 – NEWSARAMA]</ref>

A [[Green Lantern]] implied to be from a universe within the multiverse similar to that of ''Batman Beyond'' (though not the same GL represented in the animated series) is a participant in the ''[[Countdown: Arena]]'' series leading towards ''[[Final Crisis]]''.

===Mainstream contemporary DCU continuity===

In ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' #700 (June 2010), Terry McGinnis is included in the one off as a part of the [[DC Universe]] AU presented, having a history with [[Damian Wayne]], who rescued him as Batman from Two-Face-Two when he was held hostage as an infant.  Two-Face-Two believed Terry McGinnis was one of a pair of twin boys who were the sons of billionaires rather than Warren and Mary McGinnis. Two-Face-Two transformed Terry into a miniature duplicate of the Joker with the Joker's toxin.  Damian administers the antidote after he rescues Terry. And in the following page a teenaged McGinnis is seen behind the Batman cowl, battling the resurrected Joker. 

====''Batman Beyond'' miniseries====
{{main|Batman Beyond (2010)}}
A six-part ''[[Batman Beyond (2010)|Batman Beyond]]'' miniseries began its run June 2010, set in 2039 Neo-Gotham, revolving around the assassination of anyone who had anything to do with Bruce Wayne's Batman, foe or friend. [[Dan DiDio]] stated that this "Terry McGinnis mini-series" is in response to the interest expressed by the "fans of the character.".<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/080924-Didio-20-questions.html Newsarama by Vaneta Rogers: Monday, August 24, 2007]</ref> Penned by Adam Beechen, a [[The Batman (TV series)|non-DCAU Batman]] television writer, he says his comic book arc will open the door for the "legendary" DCAU to enter into the mainstream DC Universe (comics), tying into both continuities. The series takes place after McGinnis [[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker|defeated the reborn Joker]], picking up where Bruce Timm initially left off, but years before [[Batman Beyond#Project Batman Beyond|Terry learns that he shares Bruce Wayne's DNA]].<ref>http://www.bigshinyrobot.com/reviews/archives/12731</ref><ref>http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=25300</ref><ref>http://www.newsarama.com/comics/adam-beechen-batman-beyond-100318.html</ref>

''Superman/Batman Annual'' #4 (2010) is a single over-sized issue featuring Terry McGinnis' Batman. Author Paul Levitz penned the story, with experience collaborating with Paul Dini and Alan Burnett in the past. It picks up after [[Batman Beyond#Justice League connection|Superman's first meeting with the new Batman]] taking place in the DCAU, and supposedly jibing with the DCU .<ref>http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=23528</ref>

===''Batman Beyond'' Ongoing Series===
On October 6, 2010, it was announced at New York Comic-Con that ''Batman Beyond'' would start as an ongoing series in January 2011.<ref>http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/2010/10/06/nycc-2010-batman-beyond-goes-from-mini-to-ongoing-in-january/</ref>

==Lexicon==
To help carry off the feel of a world at least 40 years in the future, ''Batman Beyond'' employed a group of [[slang]] terms either specifically invented or with altered usage.

;''Schway''
: An [[adjective]] generally synonymous with "cool."
;''Rips''
: A verb generally synonymous with the colloquial meaning of  "rules" or "kicks ass".
;''[[Slag]]''
: General purpose [[expletive]] used as both [[noun]] and [[verb]].  Interestingly, this term may have been inspired by the use of the same word by characters in ''[[Beast Wars: Transformers]]'' who used the word in much the same manner{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}. Incidentally the word is in usage in British slang, where it refers to a promiscuous woman.  
;''Dreg''
: Generally meaning "lowlife."<ref>Most likely derived from the word "'''[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dreck dreck]'''"</ref>
;''Slapper''
: A futuristic form of [[steroids]], administered by a [[transdermal patch]] that is "slapped" onto the skin.  It is later revealed that the drug is Venom, the same poison that gave [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] strength. (episode: "The Winning Edge") The word is in usage in British and Irish slang, where it refers to a woman dressed in revealing and offensive clothing.
;''Twip''
: Generally meaning "twerp" or "twit".
;''Credits'' (or ''creds'')
: The general [[currency]] is referred to as "credits," and are carried on plastic cards.
;''Atrac''
:A parallel of [[Amtrak]], it appears to be a [[monorail]]-like railway service which travels nationally.

Released on August 31, 1999, the soundtrack to ''Batman Beyond'' contains many of the same composers who worked on the previous animated Batman shows.

* '''Note''': The audio commentaries for both the edited and uncut versions of ''Return of the Joker'' were provided by the same contributors, however both versions are slightly different from each other.

==Feature films==
* ''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]'' – A direct-to-video feature in which the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] makes his return to [[Gotham City|Gotham]]. The original release was censored for elements of violence and death, and a second, uncensored release came later.

* There was also a planned ''Batman Beyond'' live action feature, to be written by [[Paul Dini]]. However, [[Warner Bros.]] shelved the project and eventually went with the ''[[Batman Begins]]'' concept instead. In August 2000, Warner Bros. announced that it was developing a [[live action]] [[film adaptation]] of the TV series ''Batman Beyond'' with [[Boaz Yakin]] attached to co-write and direct. The TV series' creators [[Paul Dini]] and [[Alan Burnett]] were hired to write a screenplay for the feature film, with author [[Neal Stephenson]] consulting the duo.<ref>{{cite news | author=Dana Harris | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117785384.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | title=There's new 'Batman' in WB's belfry | publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=2000-08-22 | accessdate=2007-05-17 }}</ref>  By July 2001, a first draft was turned in to the studio, and the writers were waiting to see if a rewrite would be needed.
