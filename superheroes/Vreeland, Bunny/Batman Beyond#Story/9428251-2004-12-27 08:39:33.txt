==Story==
{{spoiler}}
The story is set approximately thirty years from present day [[Gotham City]], a darker and more futuristic city.  An aged [[Bruce Wayne]] is no longer able to fight criminal elements as he once used to.  During a battle, hampered by age and a heart condition, he breaks with a lifelong principle by threatening a criminal with a gun to keep the upper hand.  Shocked and dismayed at what he was forced to do, Bruce retires from crime fighting indefinitely.

One day, high school student Terry McGinnis comes to Wayne to seek his help in investigating his father's murder. Terry discovers Bruce was the original Batman, and "borrows" the old Batsuit to seek vengance. Just as the criminal elements begin to threaten Gotham again, Bruce allows Terry to assume his Batman alter-ego.

Young McGinnis continues the battle against crime tutored by Bruce, and aided by a new black-and-red, high-tech batsuit that augments his abilities, fires Batarangs from the wrists, flies using jets from his feet, and possesses eavesdropping capabilities (such as by pressing a finger on a piece of glass).  He has his own rogue's gallery, such as the seductive, shapeshifting Inque and the bitter, deaf sound expert Shriek, though on occasion he is forced to face his mentor's old foes, such as [[Mr. Freeze]], [[Bane]] (elderly, wasted, and dying from his consumption of Venom, the substance that gave him his strength), [[Ra's al Ghul]] (who had placed himself in his daughter's body), and even [[The Joker]].

Terry's greatest foe is Derek Powers, a ruthless billionaire who took over WayneCorp and was later accidentally mutated into a radioactive monstrosity who called himself Blight. Powers had Terry's father murdered for discovering his biological weapons program. The first season ended with a showdown between Batman and Blight aboard an abandoned nuclear submarine, where Powers was in hiding after his identity as Blight was revealed to the world by an ambitious subordinate who wanted Powers's job.
