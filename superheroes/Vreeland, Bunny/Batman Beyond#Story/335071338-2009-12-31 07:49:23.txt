'''''Batman Beyond''''', also known as '''''Batman of the Future''''', is an American [[animated television series]] created by [[The WB Television Network]] in collaboration with [[DC Comics]] and [[Warner Bros. Animation]] as a continuation of the [[Batman]] legacy. It began airing on January 10, 1999, and ended its run on December 18, 2001. With 52 episodes spanning three seasons and one [[direct-to-video]] [[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker|film]] under its belt, the series was then put on hold for the new ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'' animated series despite the network having announced plans for a fourth season.<ref>http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0102/09/index.htm</ref>  However, there was a short-lived spin-off, ''[[The Zeta Project]]''. In ''The Zeta Project'''s first season episode "Shadows", there is a [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] with ''Batman Beyond''; in this [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]], the story takes place between the episode "Countdown" and the series finale "Unmasked."

''Batman Beyond'' is set in the chronological future of the [[DC animated universe]], although it was released before ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'', ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', and ''[[Static Shock]]''.   Some characters from the series appeared two years later in "[[Future Shock (Static Shock)|Future Shock]]", an episode of ''Static Shock'', and then again in "[[The Once and Future Thing]]," episodes of ''Justice League Unlimited.''  The character of [[Terry McGinnis]] was revisited a final time in the ''JLU'' episode "[[Epilogue (Justice League Unlimited)|Epilogue]]", which tells much about the future of Batman.

''Batman Beyond'' is said to exploit the darker side of many ''Batman'' projects, playing basically on such key elements as [[emotions]], personal relations, the fear of the unknown, and technological malfunctions. As such, it was considerably darker than most other children's programs at the time, ironic as producer Bruce Timm recalls it was originally conceived as a kid-friendly Batman cartoon.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} It is also the first ''Batman'' series to portray the hero as a teenager.

==Story==
The pilot episode begins in 2019, where an aging [[Batman]], equipped with a high-tech [[Batsuit]], takes on the kidnappers of Bunny Vreeland (the daughter of Veronica Vreeland, one of Bruce Wayne's many girlfriends).  During the battle, Batman suffers a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] which leaves him unable to fight, forcing him to betray a life-long principle by threatening a criminal with a [[gun]]. Because of this, [[Bruce Wayne]] retires the Batman persona, vowing never to revive it. It is implied by virtue of his continuing to fight crime long after he should have, and his retaining of the costumes worn by [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], [[Nightwing]], and [[Batgirl]], that even before this point something horrible transpired that caused Bruce to sever his ties with the [[Justice League]] and forbid his allies to ever again assume their alter-egos. (The events which caused all of this are revealed in ''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]''.)

The story then fast-forwards to [[2039]] in [[Gotham City|Neo-Gotham]], now a futuristic megalopolis equipped with staggering high rises and hovering/flying vehicles. Bruce Wayne is now a recluse, living in bitter isolation with no companion but his guard dog, [[Ace the Bat-Hound|Ace]]. [[Batman (Terry McGinnis)|Terry McGinnis]] is an athletic 16-year-old high school student and reformed troublemaker with a deeply ingrained sense of personal justice. His first act in the series is to defend a fellow passenger on a commuter rail from a member of the [[Jokerz]] gang. After trying to defend his girlfriend from an entire gang of Jokerz, Terry is forced to engage in a high-speed chase which ultimately ends on the grounds of [[Wayne Manor]], where a fleeing Terry runs into the elderly Bruce Wayne. Bruce and Terry fend off the Jokerz side-by-side, but the exertion aggravates Bruce's heart condition. Terry helps Bruce back to the manor and, after Bruce nods off for a bit, stumbles upon the entrance to the [[Batcave]]. He is chased out by a recovered and angered Bruce.

Terry returns home to discover that his father had been [[murder]]ed, apparently by the vengeful Jokerz. Soon after, he finds out that the man actually responsible for the murder was [[Derek Powers]], CEO of a merged Wayne-Powers (Bruce had foiled the merger repeatedly during his time as Batman, but evidently gave in soon after retiring the cowl) and his father's employer, because he possessed knowledge of [[biological warfare|illegal chemical weapons]] being produced by Powers. Terry "borrows" the Batsuit, intending to bring Powers to justice. Bruce initially opposes his efforts and vehemently demands Terry return the suit (going so far as to paralyse the suit while Terry is still inside it, which almost leads to his death), but Terry is able to convince him otherwise, and subsequently defeats Powers. Realizing that crime and corruption are running rampant in Gotham, Bruce offers Terry the chance to assume the role of Batman.

Terry's first foe is Derek Powers, now mutated into a radioactive monstrosity known as Blight through a combination of deadly chemical gas and radiation. He soon comes to have his own [[rogues gallery]]: the seductive shape-shifter [[Inque]]; the hypnotist [[Spellbinder (DC Comics)|Spellbinder]]; the bitter, deaf sound expert [[Shriek (Batman Beyond)|Shriek]]; the deadly assassin [[Curare (comics)|Curare]]; the insane terrorist [[Mad Stan]]; the [[African people|African]] hunter [[Stalker (Batman Beyond)|Stalker]]; a new version of the [[Royal Flush Gang]]; Then he meets a nerd named Willie Watt who controled a Golem to get revenge on the bullies. However he confronts him again in the second season more powerful than ever; and the [[Jokerz]], a gang idolizing the notorious [[Joker (comics)|Clown Prince of Crime]]. However, on occasion, Terry is also forced to face his mentor's old foes, such as the rejuvenated [[Mr. Freeze]]; common criminals using [[Bane (comics)|Bane]]'s strength-enhancing Venom substance in the form of slap-on patches; androids of the [[Riddler]], [[Two-Face]] and [[Killer Croc]]; the [[immortality|immortal]] [[Ra's al Ghul]]; and, inevitably, the reborn [[Joker (comics)|Joker]].

Terry also comes to find similar allies. [[Maxine "Max" Gibson]] is a 17-year-old computer [[genius]] who discovers Batman's secret identity, and helps Terry with everything from [[computer hacking]], to babysitting, to coming up with excuses for Terry's girlfriend Dana Tan. Max plays an integral part in Batman's war on crime, essentially as his [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]]. He also forms a begrudging partnership with Police Commissioner [[Barbara Gordon]], the former Batgirl. She is unhappy with the idea of a new Batman, especially a teenager, as she is still haunted by the same event that caused Bruce to go into isolation. However, she knows that she and the police under her command need Batman, whether she likes it or not. Furthermore, she understands from personal experience that she cannot deter Terry any more than she could have been deterred from being Batgirl. Passing conversation between Barbara and Bruce suggests that, at the time of Batgirl's retirement, the suit had bullet holes in it that had since been repaired.

But it was destroyed by Batman and was sent to a county juvenile for 3 years. However, he experience with GoLeM made him develop a [[telekinetic]] ability. Voiced by [[Scott McAfee]]

==Lexicon==
To help carry off the feel of a world 20–40 years in the future, ''Batman Beyond'' employed a group of [[slang]] terms either specifically invented or with altered usage.

*''Schway'': An [[adjective]] generally synonymous with "cool."
*''[[Slag]]'': General purpose [[expletive]] used as both [[noun]] and [[verb]].  Interestingly, this term may have been inspired by the use of the same word by characters in ''[[Beast Wars: Transformers]]'' who used the word in much the same manner. Incidentally the word is in usage in British slang, where it refers to a promiscuous woman.  
*''Dreg'': generally meaning "lowlife."
*''Slapper'': A futuristic form of [[steroids]], administered by a [[transdermal patch]] that is "slapped" onto the skin.  It is later revealed that the drug is Venom, the same poison that gave [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] strength. (episode: "The Winning Edge") The word is in usage in British and Irish slang, where it refers to a woman dressed in revealing and offensive clothing.
*''Twip'': Generally meaning "twerp" or "twit".
*''Credits'' (or ''creds''): The general [[currency]] is referred to as "credits," and are carried on plastic cards.
*''Atrac'' a parallel of [[Amtrak]], it appears to be a monorail like railway service which travels nationally.

==Justice League connection==
In the third season of ''Batman Beyond'', a two-part story entitled "The Call", which featured (for the first time) the futuristic [[Justice League Unlimited]] helped to form an early basis for [[Bruce Timm]]'s next series, ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'', which was in turn succeeded by ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''. The setting and characters of ''Batman Beyond'' were also briefly revived in [[2004]] for an episode of ''[[Static Shock]]'' in which [[Static (comics)|Static]] is accidentally transported 40 years into the future.

''Justice League Unlimited'' revisited the world of ''Batman Beyond'' twice in [[2005]]. The first time featured [[Batman]], [[Wonder Woman]], and [[Green Lantern]] transported 50 years into the future to stop a time-travelling villain with the help of the future ''Justice League Unlimited'' cast, including [[Terry McGinnis]] as Batman and a future Static. The second time occurred during the episode "[[Epilogue (Justice League Unlimited episode)|Epilogue]]", where the true secret origin of the future Batman is learned in a story meant to be the [[de facto]] [[series finale]] for this Batman's story.

===Project Batman Beyond===
The ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "[[Epilogue (Justice League Unlimited)|Epilogue]]", set 15 years after the conclusion of ''Batman Beyond'', reveals that [[Bruce Wayne]] is actually [[Terry McGinnis]]' biological father. The episode is told largely in [[flashback]]s.

Over the years, [[Amanda Waller]] came to respect [[Batman]] and even trust him. As the years passed, she saw that he was getting older and slower. The thought of a world without Batman was unacceptable to her, so she decided to make a new one. She used her [[Project Cadmus|Cadmus]] connections to gather the technology for "Project Batman Beyond", and obtained Bruce Wayne's [[DNA]]. She found a young Neo Gotham couple with psychological profiles nearly identical to those of Bruce's parents, and injected [[Warren & Mary McGinnis|Warren McGinnis]] with a [[nanotechnology|nanotech]] solution programmed to re-write his [[reproductive]] material into an exact copy of Bruce Wayne's. A little over a year later, Mary McGinnis gave birth to Terry, a child sharing half her [[Genetics|genetic]] material and half Bruce's.

When Terry was 8 years-old, Waller employed an elderly [[Andrea Beaumont]] (the enigmatic killer from ''[[Batman: Mask of the Phantasm]]'' and once Bruce Wayne's true love) as an assassin to kill Terry's family, hoping the [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] would put him on the path to becoming Batman. However, Beaumont could not commit the act, arguing that Batman would never resort to murder to achieve his goals. Waller, however, conceded that Beaumont had been right, and made no further attempts to push Terry into becoming Batman, although she also stated to Terry that "when making a Batman, genetics is only half the story. The rest is tragedy" in an attempt to explain why she believed that doing this would put him on the path to becoming Batman. [[Derek Powers]] would later have Warren murdered, resulting in Terry becoming the new Batman. As the death of Warren proved soon afterwards, she was correct.

Fifteen years after Terry became the new Batman, Bruce's [[kidney]]s fail and doctors need a tissue donor to [[Cloning|clone]] him new ones. When Terry shows a perfect histo-compatibility match with Bruce, he runs a DNA test and found out that half his DNA was from Bruce. Terry assumes that Bruce set the whole thing up, using some old Cadmus nanotechnology to have Terry's [[gene]]s rewritten to match Bruce's, similar to what the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] did to [[Tim Drake]]. He tracks Waller down, and she reveals his origins to him. Waller also reminds Terry that he is Bruce's son, not his clone, and that despite his genetics he still has [[free will]] and makes his own choice in becoming Batman. 

It's possible that [[Superman]] knew that Terry was Bruce Wayne's child. At the end of the Batman Beyond episode "The Call", Superman mentions that Bruce as the former Batman was only a part-time member. Terry then says that they must have something in common, as he walks away. Superman then says "More than you think". This could be a reference to Superman knowing about Terry being Bruce's son.

Whether Bruce was the genetic father of Terry's younger brother Matt as well was not clearly established, as nothing was stated as to the longevity of the alterations made to Warren McGinnis; however, the series' creators have said that this is most likely the case. Matt and Terry both have black hair, but are the sons of two red-haired people – a genetic impossibility as [[red hair]] is [[recessive trait|recessive]], and requires a gene from both parents in order to present as a [[phenotype]].

==Films==
* ''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]'' - A direct-to-video feature in which the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] makes his return to [[Gotham City|Gotham]]. The original release was censored for elements of violence and death, and a second, uncensored release came later.
*There was also a planned ''Batman Beyond'' live action feature, to be written by [[Paul Dini]]. However, [[Warner Bros.]] shelved the project and eventually went with the ''[[Batman Begins]]'' concept instead. In [[August]] [[2000]], Warner Bros. announced that it was developing a [[live action]] [[film adaptation]] of the TV series ''Batman Beyond'' with [[Boaz Yakin]] attached to co-write and direct. The TV series' creators [[Paul Dini]] and [[Alan Burnett]] were hired to write a screenplay for the feature film, with author [[Neal Stephenson]] consulting the duo.<ref>{{cite news | author=Dana Harris | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117785384.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | title=There's new 'Batman' in WB's belfry | publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=2000-08-22 | accessdate=2007-05-17 }}</ref>  By July [[2001]], a first draft was turned in to the studio, and the writers were waiting to see if a rewrite would be needed.

==Comics==
[[Image:Batmanbeyondminiseries03.jpg|thumb|Cover art by [[Bruce Timm]] from the ''Batman Beyond'' comic book miniseries, depicting [[Terry McGinnis|Batman]] battling [[Derek Powers|Blight]].]]
After an initial 6-issues [[limited series]] released in March 1999, ''Batman Beyond'' had its own [[comic book series]], running through [[November]] 1999 until October 2001, for a total of 24 issues. They were set in the same world of the show and aimed at younger readers.

Originally, ''Batman Beyond'' #3 (the monthly series) was to focus on the Terrific Trio from the episode "Heroes." The story would have 2-D Man and Magma trying to revive their former teammate, Freon. It was rejected due to their resemblance to the [[Fantastic Four]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/beyond/guides/comic/01.php |title=The World's Finest}}</ref>

Terry also appeared in ''Superman Adventures'' #64. The story has Terry/Batman traveling to the present and teaming up with [[Superman]] against a futuristic version of [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]].

More recently, in ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' #22 (written by [[Jeph Loeb]]), a Batman wearing the ''Beyond'' costume appears, making his first foray into the regular [[DC Comics]] continuity. The plot involves [[Bizarro]] being transported to an alternate version of [[Gotham City]]. It would appear from #23 that this Batman is someone named "Tim" (presumably [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Tim Drake]]). However, the writers admitted to the mistake of misnaming the character,{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} and although the name was rumored to be changed to "Terry" in the trade paperback, it still reads "Tim" (see first page of "Smoke and Mirrors" chapter in the trade paperback). Furthermore, the packaging for the action figure created by DC Direct based on this appearance in Superman/Batman also erroneously identifies Batman Beyond as Tim Drake instead of Terry McGinnis. Another oddity is the [[Batwing]] pictured is the version from ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', not ''Batman Beyond''. Whether this is the regular [[DC Comics universe|DC universe]] or a parallel one is still to be seen. It is possible that this may be an alternate reality as the same story has [[Batzarro]] transported to the world of ''[[Superman: Red Son]]'', an [[Elseworlds]] [[communism|communist]] version of [[Superman]].
