'''''Batman Beyond''''' (known as '''''Batman of the Future''''' in [[Europe]], [[Latin America]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Russia]] and [[India]]) is an [[United States of America|American]] [[animated television series]] created by [[The WB Television Network]] in collaboration with [[DC Comics]] as a continuation of the [[Batman]] legacy.

''Batman Beyond'' began airing on [[January 10]], [[1999]] and ended its run on [[December 18]], [[2001]]. With 52 episodes spanning three seasons and one [[direct-to-video]] movie under its belt, the series was then put on hold for the new ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'' animated series.  However, there was a short-lived spin-off, ''[[The Zeta Project]]''. It is worth noting that in ''The Zeta Project'''s first season episode "Shadows", there is a crossover with ''Batman Beyond''; in this [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]], the story takes place between the episode "Countdown" and the series finale "Unmasked."

The series is set in the chronological future of the [[DC animated universe]], although it was released before ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'', ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', and ''[[Static Shock]]''.   Some characters from the series appeared two years later in "[[Future Shock (Static Shock)|Future Shock]]", an episode of ''Static Shock'', and then again in "[[The Once and Future Thing]]," episodes of ''Justice League Unlimited.''  The character was revisited a final time in the ''JLU'' episode "[[Epilogue (Justice League Unlimited)|Epilogue]]"', which tells much about the future of Batman.

''Batman Beyond'' is said to exploit the darker side of many ''Batman'' projects, playing basically on such key elements as emotions, personal relations, fear of unknown and technological malfunctions. As such it was considerably darker then most other children's programs at the time. It is also the first ''Batman'' series to portray the hero as a teenager.

==Story==
In the pilot episode, we see approximately twenty years into the future, where an aging [[Batman]] is having increasing difficulty handling criminals he once subdued with ease despite the aid of a new, high-tech [[Batsuit]].  One night, a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] forces Batman to betray a lifelong principle by threatening a criminal with a [[gun]]. Because of this, [[Bruce Wayne]] reluctantly decides to retire the Batman persona.

The story then fast-forwards another twenty years. [[Gotham City]] is now a futuristic megalopolis equipped with staggering high rises and hovering/flying vehicles. Bruce Wayne is now a recluse, living in bitter isolation with no companion but his guard dog, [[Ace the Bat-Hound|Ace]]. It is implied by virtue of his continuing to fight crime long after he should have, and his retaining of the costumes worn by [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], [[Nightwing]], and [[Batgirl]], that even before he had a heart attack, something horrible transpired that caused Bruce to sever his ties with the [[Justice League]] and forbid his disciples to ever again assume their alter-egos. The events which caused all of this are revealed in ''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]''.

In 2039, [[Batman (Terry McGinnis)|Terry McGinnis]] (born on [[June 27]], [[2023]]) is an athletic sixteen year-old high school student and reformed troublemaker with a deeply ingrained sense of personal justice. During the pilot episode, he saves a fellow passenger on a commuter rail from a member of the [[Jokerz]] gang, and later single-handedly takes on an entire gang of them to defend his girlfriend, ultimately resulting in a harrowing high-speed motorcycle chase through Neo-Gotham's expressways. The chase ends at the doorstep of [[Wayne Manor]], where a fleeing Terry runs into the elderly Bruce Wayne. Bruce and Terry fend off the Jokerz side-by-side, but the exertion aggravates Wayne's heart condition. Terry helps Bruce back to the manor, and while staying there, he discovers the entrance to the [[Batcave]]. He later returns to "borrow" the Batsuit to avenge the death of his father. As crime and corruption are beginning once again to rear their ugly heads in [[Gotham City|Gotham]], Bruce ultimately allows Terry to assume the mantle of Batman.

Terry continues the battle against crime, tutored by Bruce and aided by a new, high-tech Batsuit that augments his abilities, fires Batarangs from the wrists, flies using jets fired from the feet, allows eavesdropping through a hypersensitive touch microphone, and provides [[camouflage]] abilities. He comes to have his own [[rogues gallery]], such as the seductive shape-shifter [[Inque]], the hypnotist [[Spellbinder (DC Comics)|Spellbinder]], the bitter, deaf sound expert [[Shriek (Batman Beyond)|Shriek]], the deadly assassin [[Curare (comics)|Curare]], the insane terrorist [[Mad Stan]], the [[African people|African]] hunter [[Stalker (Batman Beyond)|Stalker]], a new version of the [[Royal Flush Gang]], and the [[Jokerz]], a gang idolizing the notorious [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]. However, on occasion, Terry is also forced to face his mentor's old foes, such as the atrophying [[Mr. Freeze]], [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] (elderly, wasted, and dying from his consumption of Venom, the substance that gave him his strength), the [[immortality|immortal]] [[Ra's al Ghul]], and even a reborn [[Joker (comics)|Joker]].

[[Image:Batmanbeyondminiseries03.jpg|left|175px|thumb|Cover art by [[Bruce Timm]] from the ''Batman Beyond'' comic book miniseries, depicting [[Terry McGinnis|Batman]] battling [[Derek Powers|Blight]].]]
Terry's first foe is [[Derek Powers]], a ruthless billionaire who took over Wayne Industries and is later accidentally mutated into a radioactive monstrosity known as [[Derek Powers|Blight]]. Powers had Terry's father, [[Warren & Mary McGinnis|Warren]], murdered after Warren discovered that Powers was in the process of developing a [[biological warfare|biological weapons]] program. The first season ended with a showdown between Batman and Blight aboard an abandoned nuclear submarine, where Powers was in hiding after his identity as Blight was revealed to the world by his ambitious son Paxton, who planned to usurp his father as chairman of Wayne-Powers.

[[Maxine "Max" Gibson]] (born [[October 28]], [[2023]]) is a seventeen year-old computer [[genius]] who discovers Batman's secret identity, and helps Terry with everything from [[computer hacking]], to babysitting, to coming up with excuses for Terry's girlfriend, Dana Tan. Max plays an integral part in Batman's war on crime, essentially as his [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]].

Terry also finds one other ally, though a begrudging one: [[Barbara Gordon]], the former [[Batgirl]]. Having followed in the footsteps of her father, [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]], Barbara is now Police Commissioner of [[Gotham City]]. In one episode, Barbara reveals to Terry that she and Bruce had once been romantically involved. However, she is unhappy with the idea of a new Batman, especially a teenager, as she is still haunted by the same event that caused Bruce to go into isolation. Knowing from personal experience that she cannot deter Terry anymore than she could have been deterred from being Batgirl, she relents, possibly also out of respect for her mentor and former lover, the original Batman. Passing conversation between Barbara and Bruce suggests that at the time of Batgirl's retirement, the suit had bullet holes in it that had been repaired.

When Batman asks a servant about Bane, the servant replies that this was the effect on Bane from all the years of using Venom.  Batman later discovers Bane is actually using Venom in his life support to keep himself alive.

==[[Lexicon]]==
To help carry off the feel of a world 50 years in the future, Batman Beyond employed a group of slang terms either specifically invented or with altered usage.
*Schway: An adjective generally synonymous with "cool".
*[[Slag]]: General purpose expletive used as both noun and verb.  Interestingly, this term may have been inspired by the use of the same word by characters in the all-[[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] TV series "''[[Beast Wars: Transformers]]''" (1996-1999), who used the word in much the same manner.
*Dreg: generally meaning "lowlife".
*Slapper: A futuristic form of [[steroids]], administered by a [[Transdermal patch]] that is "slapped" onto the skin.  It's later revealed that the drug is Venom, the same poison that gave Bane strength. (episode: The Winning Edge)
*Credits (or "Creds"): The general currency is referred to as "Credits" and are carried on plastic cards.

==Justice League connection==
In the third season of ''Batman Beyond'', a two-part story featuring the [[Justice League]] entitled "The Call" formed an early basis for Timm's next series, ''Justice League'', which was in turn succeeded by ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''. The setting and characters of ''Batman Beyond'' were also briefly revived in 2004 for an episode of ''[[Static Shock]]'' in which [[Static (comics)|Static]] is accidentally transported forty years into the future.

''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' revisited the world of ''Batman Beyond'' twice in 2005. The first time featured Batman, [[Wonder Woman]], and [[Green Lantern]] transported 50 years into the future to stop a time-traveling villain with the help of the future ''Justice League Unlimited'' cast, including Terry McGinnis as Batman and a future Static. The second time occurred during the episode "[[Epilogue (Justice League Unlimited episode)|Epilogue]]", where the true secret origin of the future Batman is learned in a story meant to be the [[de facto]] [[series finale]] for this Batman's story.

==Project ''Batman Beyond''==
The ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "[[Epilogue (Justice League Unlimited)|Epilogue]]", set 15 years after the conclusion of ''Batman Beyond'', reveals that [[Bruce Wayne]] is actually [[Terry McGinnis]]' biological father. The episode is told largely in flashbacks.

Over the years Amanda Waller came to respect Batman and even trust him. As the years passed, she saw that he was getting older and slower. The thought of a world without Batman was unacceptable to her, so she decided to make a new one. She used her Cadmus connections to gather the technology for "Project Batman Beyond", and obtained Bruce Wayne's [[DNA]]. She found a young Neo Gotham couple with psychological profiles nearly identical to those of Bruce's parents, and injected [[Warren & Mary McGinnis|Warren McGinnis]] with a [[nanotechnology|nanotech]] solution programmed to rewrite his [[reproductive]] material into an exact copy of Bruce Wayne's. A little over a year later, Mary McGinnis gave birth to Terry, a child sharing half her [[Genetics|genetic]] material and half Bruce's.

When Terry was eight years old,  Waller employed an elderly Andrea Beaumont(a character from ''[[Mask of the Phantasm]]'') as an assassin to kill Terry's family, hoping the trauma would put him on the path to becoming Batman. However, Beaumont could not commit the act, arguing  that Batman would never resort to murder to achieve his goals. [[Derek Powers]]  later had Warren murdered, resulting in Terry becoming the new Batman.

Fifteen years after Terry McGinnis became the new Batman, Bruce Wayne's kidneys fail and doctors need a tissue donor to [[Cloning|clone]] him new ones. When Terry shows a perfect histo-compatibility match with Bruce, Terry runs a DNA test and found out that half his DNA was from Bruce. Terry assumes that Bruce set the whole thing up, using some old Cadmus nanotechnology to have Terry's [[gene]]s rewritten to match Bruce's, similar to what the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] did to [[Tim Drake]]. He tracks Amanda Waller down and she reveals his origins to him. She also reminds him that he is Bruce Wayne's son, not his clone, and that despite his genetics he still has free will and makes his own choice in becoming Batman.

==Movies==
* ''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]'' - A direct-to-video feature in which the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] makes his return to [[Gotham City|Gotham]]. The original release was censored for elements of violence and death, and a second, uncensored release came later.

*There was also a planned ''Batman Beyond'' live action feature, to be written by [[Paul Dini]], however [[Warner Bros.]] shelved the project and eventually went with the ''[[Batman Begins]]'' concept instead. In August 2000, [[Warner Bros.]] announced that it was developing a [[live action]] [[film adaptation]] of the TV series ''Batman Beyond'' with [[Boaz Yakin]] attached to co-write and direct. The TV series' creators [[Paul Dini]] and [[Alan Burnett]] were hired to write a screenplay for the feature film, with author [[Neal Stephenson]] consulting the duo. <ref>{{cite news | author=Dana Harris | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117785384.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | title=There's new 'Batman' in WB's belfry | publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=2000-08-22 | accessdate=2007-05-17 }}</ref>  By July 2001, a first draft was turned in to the studio, and the writers were waiting to see if a rewrite would be needed.

* '''Note''': The audio commentaries for both the edited and uncut versions of ''Return of the Joker'' were provided by the same contributors, however both versions are slightily different from each other.

==Comics==
After an initial 6-issues [[limited series]] released in March 1999, ''Batman Beyond'' had its own comic book series, running through November 1999 until October 2001, for a total of 24 issues. They were set in the same world of the show and aimed at younger readers.

Originally, ''Batman Beyond'' #3 (the monthly series) was to focus on The Terrific Trio from the ''Batman Beyond'' episode "Heroes." The story would have 2-D Man and Magma trying to revive their former teammate, Freon. It was rejected due to their resemblance to the [[Fantastic Four]].[http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/beyond/guides/comic/01.php]

Terry also appeared in ''Superman Adventures'' #64. The story has Terry/Batman traveling to the present and teaming up with [[Superman]] against a futuristic version of [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]].

More recently, in ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' #22 (written by [[Jeph Loeb]]), a Batman wearing the ''Beyond'' costume appears, making his first foray into the regular [[DC Comics]] continuity. The plot involves [[Bizarro]] being transported to an alternate version of [[Gotham City]]. It would appear from #23 that this Batman is someone named "Tim" (presumably [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Tim Drake]]). However, the writers admitted to the mistake of misnaming the character,{{Fact|date=August 2007}} and although the name was rumored to be changed to "Terry" in the trade paperback, it still reads "Tim" (see first page of "Smoke and Mirrors" chapter in the trade paperback). Furthermore, the packaging for the action figure created by DC Direct based on this appearance in Superman/Batman also erroneously identifies Batman Beyond as Tim Drake instead of Terry McGinnis. Another oddity is the [[Batwing]] pictured is the version from [[Batman: The Animated Series]], not ''Batman Beyond''. Whether this is the regular [[DC Comics universe|DC universe]] or a parallel one is still to be seen. It seems possible that this may be an alternate reality as the same story has [[Batzarro]] transported to the world of ''[[Superman: Red Son]]'', an [[Elseworlds]] [[communism|communist]] version of [[Superman]].

On March 3, 2007 [[Dan DiDio]] announced that Terry McGinnis may be showing up in the DCU sometime that year.<ref>[http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0703/03/dcnationpanel.htm Comics Continuum by Rob Allstetter: Saturday, March 3, 2007<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Terry McGinnis appeared in [[Countdown to Final Crisis]] #21, as an inhabitant of [[List of DC Multiverse worlds|Earth-12]]<ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?p=4800627&posted=1 COUNTING DOWN: CARLIN & BEDARD ON COUNTDOWN #22 - NEWSARAMA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. It's unknown at the moment whether Earth-12 will be the home Earth of the entire [[DC Animated Universe]], or just the home Earth of the ''Batman Beyond'' TV series.

A [[Green Lantern]] implied to be from a universe within the multiverse similar to that of Batman Beyond (though not the same GL represented in the animated series) is a participant in the [[Countdown: Arena]] series leading towards [[Final Crisis]].

One canon contribution of Batman Beyond to the DC Universe is establishing that [[Barbara Gordon]] eventually becomes Commissioner of Gotham Police following in her father's footsteps.

==Spin-offs==
''Batman Beyond'' had a spin-off called ''[[The Zeta Project]]'', featuring the [[android]] Zeta from the ''Batman Beyond'' episode "Zeta." Batman would guest star in the episode "Shadows."

The supervillain [[Stalker (Batman Beyond)|Stalker]] was to have appeared in ''[[The Zeta Project]]'' episode "Taffy Time," but didn't make it. The second season episode, "Ro's Gift," has an appearance made by the [[Brain Trust]] from the ''Batman Beyond'' episode "Mind Games." [[Terry McGinnis|Terry McGinnis/Batman]] was originally slated to appear in this episode as well, but was cut since Timm and company were working on ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]''.
