'''''Batman Beyond''''' (known as '''''Batman of the Future''''' in [[Europe]], [[Latin America]] and [[Australia]]/[[New Zealand]]) was an [[United States|American]]  [[animated television series]] created by [[WB Network]] in collaboration with [[DC Comics]] as a continuation of the [[Batman]] legacy. The series is part of the [[DC Animated Universe]]; kicking off stories of the future time period of [[Bruce Timm]]'s ongoing universe.

The show began airing in 1999 and ended in 2001. With 52 episodes and one Direct-to-Video movie under its belt, the series was then put on hold for the new ''[[Justice League]]'' animated series.  [[As of 2006]], ''Batman Beyond'' remains on hiatus with no plans to revive the series in the near future. However, there was a short-lived spin-off, ''[[The Zeta Project]]'', also set in the DC Animated Universe's future. It is worth noting that in ''The Zeta Project'''s first season episode "Shadows", there is a crossover with ''Batman Beyond''; in this [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]], the story takes place between the episode "Countdown" and the series finale "Unmasked".

In the third season of ''Batman Beyond'', a two-part story featuring the [[Justice League]] entitled "The Call" formed an early basis for Bruce Timm's next series, ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'', which was in turn succeeded by ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''. The setting and characters of ''Batman Beyond'' were also briefly revived in 2004 for an episode of ''[[Static Shock]]'' in which [[Static (superhero)|Static]] is accidentally transported forty years into the future.

''Justice League Unlimited'' revisited the world of ''Batman Beyond'' twice in 2005.  The first time featured [[Batman]], [[Wonder Woman]], and [[Green Lantern]] transported fifty years into the future to stop a time-traveling villain with the help of the future ''Justice League Unlimited'' cast - including [[Terry McGinnis]] as Batman.  The second time occurred during the episode "[[Epilogue (Justice League Unlimited episode)|Epilogue]]", where the true secret origin of the future Batman is learned in a story meant to be the de facto [[series finale]] for this Batman's story.

==Story==
[[Image:BB logo.gif|225px|left|thumb|Batman beyond logo]]

In the stories pilot episode we see approximately 30 years into the future an aged [[Bruce Wayne]] is having increasing difficulty handling criminals he once subdued with ease. One day a heart attack forces him to betray a lifelong personal principle by threatening a criminal with a gun, and subsequently Wayne decides to retire from crimefighting permanently.

The story then jumps 20 years from the conclusion of present day [[DC animated universe|DCAU]] (as evident by the commentary found on Batman Beyond: Season One). [[Gotham]] is a city of the future equipped with staggering high rises and hovering/flying vehicles. 

Wayne is now a virtual recluse living in bitter isolation with no companion but his guard dog Ace. It is implied by virtue of his continuing to fight crime long after he should have, his retaining the costumes worn by Robin, Nightwing and Batgirl and a conversation that even before he had a heart attack something horrible transpired that caused Wayne to severe his ties with the Justice League and forbid his disciples from ever again assuming their alter-egos. The events which caused all of this was finally revealed in [[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]].   

One evening while out on a walk Wayne gets involved with a fight between [[Terry McGinnis]] and a pack of [[Jokerz]]; the exertion aggravates an apparent heart condition and Terry has to help him back to [[Wayne Manor]]. While staying at the mansion, Terry discovers the entrance to the [[Batcave]], and later returns to "borrow" the Batsuit to avenge the death of his [[Warren & Mary McGinnis|father]] (who had accidentally become involved in the revelation of a secret biological weapons development). As crime and corruption are beginning once again to rear their ugly heads in Gotham, Wayne feels he has no choice but to allow Terry to assume the Batman alter-ego.

Young McGinnis continues the battle against crime tutored by Bruce, and aided by a new black-and-red, high-tech batsuit that augments his abilities, fires Batarangs from the wrists, flies using jets fired from the feet, allows eavesdropping through a hypersensitive touch microphone, and provides [[camouflage]] abilities. He has his own [[rogues gallery]], such as the seductive shapeshifter [[Inque]], the confusing hypnotist [[Spellbinder (DC Comics)|Spellbinder]], the bitter, deaf sound expert [[Shriek (Batman Beyond)|Shriek]], the most deadly of the League of Assassins [[Curare (comics)|Curare]], the insane terrorist [[Mad Stan]], and the African hunter [[Stalker (Batman Beyond)|Stalker]]. However, on occasion he is also forced to face his mentor's old foes, such as the atrophying [[Mr. Freeze]], [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] (elderly, wasted, and dying from his consumption of Venom, the substance that gave him his strength), the [[Immortality|immortal]] [[Ra's al Ghul]], and even the reborn [[Joker (comics)|Joker]].

Terry's greatest initial foe is [[Derek Powers]], a ruthless billionaire who took over WayneCorp and was later accidentally mutated into a radioactive monstrosity who called himself '''Blight'''. Powers had Terry's father murdered after Mr. McGinnis discovered Powers was in the process of developing a biological weapons program. The first season ended with a showdown between Batman and Blight aboard an abandoned nuclear submarine, where Powers was in hiding after his identity as Blight was revealed to the world by his ambitious son Paxton, who planned to usurp his father as chairman of Wayne-Powers.

[[Maxine "Max" Gibson]] (voiced by [[Cree Summer]]) is a 17-year old computer genius who discovers Batman's secret identity. Since she discovered Terry's alter-ego she's been helping him with everything from computer hacking, to babysitting, to coming up with excuses for Terry's girlfriend Dana Tan. Max plays an integral part in Batman's war on crime, essentially as his [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]].

Terry also finds one other ally, though a begrudging one: [[Barbara Gordon]], the former Batgirl. Having followed in the footsteps of her father, [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]], Barbara is now Police Commissioner of Gotham City, and she is unhappy with the idea of a new Batman, especially a teenager, as she is still haunted by the same event that caused Wayne to go into isolation. However, knowing from personal experience that she cannot deter Terry anymore than she could have been deterred from being Batgirl, she relents, possibly also out of respect for her mentor, the original Batman. Also, passing lines between Barbara and Bruce suggest that, at the time of Batgirl's retirement, the suit had bullet holes in it that had not yet been repaired. It is implied early on in the series that Barbara and Bruce were in love for a period of time. It is also confirmed during ''Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker'' that [[Dick Grayson]] ([[Nightwing]]) is still alive in this time period.

==From Justice League to Batman Beyond==
When the original [[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League series]] premiered, there were debates on whether or not Batman Beyond would stay as a main future or possible future, mainly because not all JL viewers watched Batman Beyond or it would restrict the creative teams from doing certain stories. The ''[[Static Shock]]'' episode, "Future Shock", as well as the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episodes, "The Once And Future Thing" (however, it is to be noted that, while this episode acknowledges Batman Beyond's existence, it also deals with heavy manipulation of the time stream, which, as acknowledged by the creators of the episode (Bruce Timm and others), intentionally leaves Batman Beyond's existence vague (making it a [[w: Alternate Realities|possible future]]))  and "Epilogue" make BB canon. Aside from those certain episodes, there are also bits of foreshadowing in other JL and JLU episodes:

*Injustice For All &mdash; Batman pockets a huge chunk of Kryptonite belonging to Lex Luthor. Sometime offscreen he most likely takes a piece of it to keep in storage in the event Superman goes rogue, as seen in "The Call" (The rest of that chunk was apparently destroyed by Amazo in the ''[[Justice League]]'' episode "Tabula Rasa").

*Twilight &mdash; Batman feels a bit sick from the [[Boom Tube]], referring to Old Bruce stating that he didn't really trust Boom Tubes in ''Batman Beyond'''s "The Call."

*Maid Of Honor &mdash; The Princess Audrey dresses in "Spellbound" might have belonged to Kasnian Princess Audrey. In addition, a younger Vilmos Egans can be seen in the background when Wonder Woman initially enters the [[International Space Station]] reception in Part 1, but prior to the [[Paparazzi]] spotting her.

*Wild Cards &mdash; During Batman Beyond it was stated that Bruce had been fighting the [[Royal Flush Gang]] for years. He first battles them in this episode.
**Later that original statement is proven to be true by the flashback in Epilogue when he fights them for at least a second time.  

*Starcrossed &mdash; The storyboarders made sure that the Freeze Gun in the Batcave was still intact as we see Bruce and Terry using it a few times against Inque.

*Task Force X &mdash; Justice League technician and Cadmus spy Vance (Robert Vance), would later become a software tycoon passing away thereafter as seen in Batman Beyond "Lost Soul".

*Double Date &mdash; It was confirmed by [[Dwayne McDuffie]] that Edgar from Batman Beyond "Mind Games" is Edgar Mandragora, son of crimelord [[Steven Mandragora]].
**While [[Justice League Unlimited]] sees the [[Huntress (comics)|Helena Bertinelli/Huntress]] making her animated debut, there was consideration of bringing the original Pre-Crisis Huntress/Helena Wayne into Batman Beyond, the notion being that it would be more natural than doing a Batgirl Beyond.[http://jl.toonzone.net/huntress/huntress.htm]

*In "Revenant", Bruce mentions in a speech that, "I've seen it all. Demons, witch boys, immortals, zombies..."
**This is proved to be true when he fights Hades and his zombie army as well as [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]] and encounters Etrigan the Demon in the JL episodes "A Knight of Shadows" and "Kid Stuff" (along with the Batman episode "The Demon Within").  The mentioning of immortals would probably be [[Ra's al Ghul]] and [[Vandal Savage]]. "Witch Boys" refers to [[Klarion]], whom he fought in BTAS's "The Demon Within".

*In "Speak No Evil", Bruce noted that only "normal" [[gorilla]]s didn't eat meat. This is perhaps a reference to [[Gorilla Grodd]] or [[Ultra-Humanite]].

Also, a few moments from ''[[Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman|Mystery Of The Batwoman]]'':
*Batwoman's costume could have been the inspiration for Bruce's design of the Batman Beyond costume.
*Barbara briefly flirts with Bruce during the phone call.

As well as some subtle nods to ''[[The Zeta Project]]'':

*Secret Society &mdash; The Justice League are training with some robots. The robots resemble Zeta's original appearance in Batman Beyond.

*Fearful Symmetry &mdash; [[Supergirl]], [[Green Arrow]], and [[Question (comics)|The Question]] are attacked by Zeta type robots. The robots are connected to the army and General Hardcastle (from ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', though a Martian invader poses as him in JL Secret Origins). Also, the term metahumans appears here, cementing [[Static Shock|Static's]] connection to the DCAU.

*The energy generator from Justice League "The Brave and the Bold" is also seen in Batman Beyond "Heroes"

In part 2 of '''The Call''' it was mentioned that the original Batman never made it past being a part-time member (Despite being active in many league cases).

*'''Secret Origins, Part 3''' has Batman saying that when the League needs help to call him.

*'''Hereafter, Part 1''' has the League discussing on who should be recruited after Superman's (supposed) death.  Wonder Woman suggests that they should have Batman joining full time.

*In '''Panic In The Sky''', The founding JL members decide to turn themselves in hoping prove innocent of any wrongdoing (Using their satelite to destroy a town).  Batman wanting to directly prove their innocence, goes against joining them, stating that he's a part-time member.

*On ''Batman: The Animated Series'' episode " ''See No Evil,'' Bruce may have purchsed samples of Carrows's invisiblility plastic and copies of research notes from his assistant Sam Giddell after his fight with Lloyd Ventrix .  It may have took him years to resolved the toxicity issues of it and incorporating them into the Batsuit.

*Bruce still has his Gray Ghost merchandises he collected since childhood and still keeps them in the cases as seen on ''Batman: The Animated Series'' episode ''Beware The Gray Ghost.''  As they were seen again on ''Batman Beyond'' episode ''Inque''.

==Project Batman Beyond==
{{spoiler}}
The ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "[[Epilogue (Justice League Unlimited)|Epilogue]]", set fifteen years after the conclusion of the ''Batman Beyond'' series, reveals that Bruce Wayne is actually Terry's genetic father. The episode is told largely in flashback.  Terry confronts [[Amanda Waller]], former head of [[Project Cadmus]], who reveals to him that she came to believe the world would always need a Batman. 

To that end, she instituted "Project Batman Beyond". Waller employs the [[Clock King]] (still presumably a member of her [[Task Force X]]) to substitute an injection that Terry's father received during a routine physical.  The subsitute shot contained a nanovirus developed from [[Project Cadmus]] [[nanotechnology]] and a sample of Bruce's DNA. Waller's plan was to parallel Bruce's childhood trauma in Terry to 'create' another Batman.  To that end, she enlisted Bruce's former fianceé [[Andrea Beaumont]] (the title character from [[Mask of the Phantasm]]) to assassinate Terry's parents in front of him.  However, Beaumont balked at the assignment at the last moment, and returns to Waller, where the two have a verbal confrontation.  

Eventually, Waller came to realize that by killing to create a new Batman she would be going against everything that the original stood for. Tragically, [[Derek Powers]] would later instigate Terry's path towards becoming the new Batman anyway by having his father murdered.

Terry, who has been contemplating abandoning Bruce, the Batman identity, and [[Dana Tan]] (the two are still in a relationship), eventually opts to return home and continue on as Batman as he has.  He also calls Dana Tan and asks her to meet him, with the implication that he intends to ask her to marry him. 

According to writer Dwayne McDuffie, Bruce was aware that Terry was practically a clone of him, but would never bring it up as he wanted Terry to be his own man. [http://jl.toonzone.net/episode50/episode50.htm] 

It should be noted that the black and white sequences of the "Epilogue" episode are intended to represent a dream and not flashbacks.

Though it is not specified in the episode, as Terry's father's sperm was genetically reprogrammed to contain Bruce Wayne-DNA, Terry's brother [[Matt McGinnis|Matt]] is also  the biological son of Bruce Wayne. Bruce Timm himself stated “Well, we didn’t come right out and say it, but since Warren’s love gun was shooting 'Bruce Wayne bullets,' yes, Matt is also Bruce’s biological son." [http://jl.toonzone.net/episode50/episode50.htm]

It is interesting to note that this episode marks the first time that the title "Batman Beyond" was actually mentioned in the context of a Batman Beyond story.  While in costume, Terry identifies himself simply as Batman.  (In some parts of the world, the title itself was dropped, and the show is called "Batman of the Future".

==Movies==
*''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker|Return of the Joker]]'' - A direct-to-video feature in which the Joker makes his return to Gotham.  The original release was censored for elements of violence and death.  A second uncensored release came later.

There was also a planned ''Batman Beyond'' live action feature, to be written by [[Paul Dini]], however [[Warner Bros]] shelved the project and eventually went with the ''[[Batman Begins]]'' concept instead. A "Batman Beyond: Year One" live action short fan-film was made as a tribute to the show by a group of fans.

Finally, a Direct-to-DVD sequel to ''Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker'' was to feature Selina Kyle/[[Catwoman]]. This project never made it off the ground, however much of the concept of this film eventually made it into the ''Justice League Unlimited'' episode "Epilogue", which is seen by many as ''Batman Beyond''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s true finale.

==Comics==
[[Image:Superman-batman22 batmanbeyond.jpg|left|150px|thumb|Terry & [[Bizarro]]]]
Like most DCAU shows, after an initial 6-issues [[limited series]] released on March 1999, ''Batman Beyond'' had its own comic series, running through November 1999 until October 2001, for a total of 24 issues. They were set in the same world of the show and aimed at younger readers.

* Terry also appeared in Superman Adventures #64.  The story has Terry/Batman traveling to the present and teaming up with Superman against Brainiac Beyond.

* Originally, Batman Beyond #3 (The monthly series) was to focus on '''The Terrific Trio''' from the episode '''Heroes'''.  The story would have 2D and Magma trying to revive their former member Freon.  It was rejected due to their resemblance to the [[Fantastic Four]].[http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/beyond/guides/comic/01.php]

But more recently, in ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' #22 (written by [[Jeph Loeb]]), a Batman wearing the ''Beyond'' costume appears, making his first foray into the regular [[DC Comics]] continuity. The plot involves [[Bizarro]] being transported to an alternate version of Gotham. It would appear from #23 that this Batman is someone named Tim presumably [[Tim Drake]]. However, the writers admitted to the mistake of misnaming the character, and although the name was rumored to be changed to "Terry" in the trade paperback, it still reads "Tim."  (See first page of "Smoke and Mirrors" chapter in the trade paperback)  Another oddity is the Batwing is the version from the original animated series, not ''Batman Beyond''. Whether this is the regular DC universe or a parallel one is still to be seen. It seems possible that this may be an alternate reality as the same story has [[Batzarro]] transported to the world of ''[[Superman: Red Son]]'', an [[Elseworlds]] [[communist]] version of [[Superman]].
{{-}}

==Spinoffs==
The television series had a spinoff called ''[[The Zeta Project]]'', featuring the [[android]] Zeta from the ''Batman Beyond'' episode "Zeta." Batman would guest star in the episode "Shadows".

[[Stalker (Batman Beyond)|Stalker]] was to have appeared in The Zeta Project episode "Taffy Time", but didn't make it. Season 2 episode, "Ro's Gift", has an appearance made by [[Brain Trust]] from the Batman Beyond episode "Mind Games". Terry McGinnis as Batman was originally slated to appear in this episode as well, but was cut since Timm and company were working on [[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]].
