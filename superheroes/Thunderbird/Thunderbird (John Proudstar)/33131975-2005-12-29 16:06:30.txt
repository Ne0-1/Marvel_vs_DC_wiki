The first Thunderbird, '''John Proudstar,''' was created by [[Dave Cockrum]] and [[Len Wein]] and first appeared in ''Giant-Size X-Men'' #1 ([[1975]]).

Proudstar was born into an [[Apache tribe]] in [[Camp Verde]], [[Arizona]]. As a teenager, Proudstar discovered he possessed the [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] abilities of superhuman strength, speed and resistance to damage.

Proudstar was [[conscription|drafted]] into the [[United States Marine Corps]] during the [[Vietnam War]] and earned the rank of corporal. He returned to his tribe afterwards but felt unhappy and listless.

He was recruited by [[Professor Charles Xavier]] to join his second group of X-Men.  Although Proudstar was reluctant to join another white man&#8217;s crusade, he agreed and took the superhero title Thunderbird. 

Thunderbird&#8217;s tenure with the team was short. During the new team&#8217;s second mission, he leapt onto an airplane he thought was carrying the [[supervillain]] [[Count Nefaria]]. Unfortunately the plane was a decoy. It exploded killing Proudstar (in ''X-Men'' #95 ([[1975]]).

Issue #1 of the new X-Men mini-series "Deadly Genesis" mimics the cover of Giant-Size X-Men but Thunderbird is noticeably absent prompting speculation that he is about to retur as an enemy of the X-Men either himself or the mutant [[Krakoa]].

An [[parallel world|alternate world]] version of John Proudstar has been featured in ''[[Exiles (comics)|The Exiles]],'' a series featuring a team of parallel world-hopping mutants. In his home timeline, Thunderbird was captured and modified by the evil super-mutant [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. As a result, he became an immense part-machine creature with immense strength and damage resistance capable of taking on [[the Incredible Hulk]].

Thunderbird broke free of Apocalypse and became a founding member of the Exiles. However, he was injured in a battle with [[Galactus]] and was left in a coma in that dimension. He thought his pregnant girlfriend [[Nocturne (comics)|Nocturne]] and the child she was carrying would survive, but later she lost their baby. Thunderbird's ultimate fate is unknown: he is presumed to have died.
===In other media===
In the 1980's cartoon television series [[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]], Thunderbird/ John Proudstar was one of the X-Men who appeared though only briefly. What he had in that series that he didn't have in the comics is the ability to become North American Animals.
