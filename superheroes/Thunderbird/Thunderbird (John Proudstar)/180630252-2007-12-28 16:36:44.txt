'''Thunderbird''' ('''John Proudstar''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]] who was briefly a member of the [[X-Men]]. Created by writer [[Len Wein]] and artist [[Dave Cockrum]], he first appeared in ''Giant-Size X-Men'' #1 ([[1975#May|May 1975]]).

An [[Apache]], Thunderbird possesses superhuman athletic ability. He was a short time member of the "Second Genesis" group of X-Men gathered together in ''Giant-Size X-Men'' #1 but died on their second mission.

==Fictional character biography==
Proudstar was born into an [[Apache tribe]] on a reservation in [[Camp Verde]], [[Arizona]]. As a teenager, Proudstar discovers he possesses the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] abilities of superhuman senses, strength, speed, stamina, sturdiness.

Proudstar is [[conscription|drafted]] into the [[United States Marine Corps]] during the [[Vietnam War]] and earns the rank of corporal. He returns to his tribe afterwards but feels unhappy and listless.

He is recruited by [[Professor Charles Xavier]] to join his third group of X-Men.  Although Proudstar is reluctant to join another white man's crusade, he agrees and takes on the superhero title Thunderbird. 

After successfully completing his first mission with the X-Men, Thunderbird turns out to be so volatile and ill-mannered that he constantly throws off the team's synchronization. It should be noted that he often finds himself going head to head with [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], the appointed leader of the X-Men. This attitude would not change and would also lead to an untimely end for Thunderbird.

Thunderbird has a short career as a hero. During the new team's second mission, he leaps onto an airplane that is carrying the [[supervillain]] [[Count Nefaria]]. Despite the urging of [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], Thunderbird refuses to get off the plane, stating that he would show that he was a true Apache warrior. The plane explodes, killing Proudstar<ref>''X-Men'' #95 [[1975]]</ref>. While Count Nefaria is later revealed to have survived the crash, Thunderbird has so far been considered dead on account of his headstrong action.

Even in death Thunderbird's legacy carries on. His brother, [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]] (James Proudstar), has similar powers, although to a much greater degree, and is also an X-Man.

==Powers and abilities==
Thunderbird possesses the mutant abilities of superhuman levels of strength, speed, stamina, sturdiness. His muscle tissue is much denser than that of an ordinary human. This is distributed in such a way as to greatly enhance the size of his arms, shoulders, and thighs. Thunderbird's skin is also much denser than in ordinary humans, making him more resistant to physical injury. As part of his mutation, Thunderbird possesses oversized lungs and an unusually developed respiratory system. He can also run at super speeds, as he is seen overtaking a buffalo in Giant-Size X-men #1. It was later revealed by retcon in Giant Size Xmen # 4 that he also possessed super-senses .

==Other versions==
===Exiles===
An alternate version of John Proudstar is an original member of the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]], a group of superhumans tasked with fixing damaged realities. This Thunderbird is captured by [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] during his time with the X-Men and unwillingly transformed into one of his [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Four Horsemen]], namely [[War (comics)|War]]. 

Thunderbird's time with this group is relatively short, several months at most. He serves mainly as the powerhouse of the group. In the third story arc he meets another alternate version of himself, who has become the [[Shaman (comics)|shaman]] of [[Alpha Flight]], and this arc is largely centered on his internal conflicts. In issue #10, Thunderbird sacrifices himself to hold an anti-matter bomb within the body of [[Galactus]], which forces the world-devourer to leave Earth after the massive injury the bomb causes.

Although his physical body heals from the damage caused by the detonation, his mind is not so fortunate. At the least he has been put into a coma, at the worst he might be brain dead. The Exiles never get a chance to find out, as he is replaced by [[Heather Hudson (Exiles)|Sasquatch]] and the team are forced to leave him behind. His body is later discovered in the Panoptichron, a crystal city that lies between realities, but has yet to be returned to his home reality.

During his time with the Exiles, he develops a romantic relationship with fellow teammate [[Nocturne (comics)|Nocturne]], who is pregnant with his child when he becomes comatose. (However, she later loses the child for unexplained reasons.) This relationship was revisited in issue #16, where we see flashbacks of previously unseen scenes between the two characters that further develop it.

This version of Thunderbird is considerably more powerful than the mainstream one, due to Apocalypse's augmentations. His skin is covered by retractable armour plates that harden when he enters battle, considerably increasing his durability, and even at base level his power statistics are above his 616 counterpart. His power increases with his rage, akin to the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] who he once defeated in close combat, and his appearance becomes more bestial as he does so.

Another side effect of Apocalypse's modifications is that Thunderbird no longer has a sense of taste.  But he does enjoy smelling things.

Thunderbird seems to have woken up and escaped the stasis wall at the end of ''Exiles'' #97. He helped Psylocke and Cat regain control of the Panoptichron during Doctor Doom's assault, and was later reunited with Nocturne when the Exiles and New Excalibur teamed up to save Roma and the Captain Britain Corps. Thunderbird leaves the team shortly after to be with Nocturne on Heather's earth.

===House of M===
John Proudstar appears as a police detective for the NYPD and as the leader of the strikeforce known as the Brotherhood.<ref>''House of M: Avengers'' #2</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
In the 1980s cartoon television series ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'', Thunderbird/John Proudstar (voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]]) appears briefly as one of the X-Men. In this incarnation, he possesses the ability to become a variety of North American animals (and seems to lack the physical abilities of the comic version), much resembling [[Alpha Flight]]'s [[Snowbird (comics)|Snowbird]] in that respect.
