'''Thunderbird''' ('''John Proudstar''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]] who was briefly a member of the [[X-Men]]. Created by writer [[Len Wein]] and artist [[Dave Cockrum]], he first appeared in ''Giant-Size X-Men'' #1 (May 1975).

An [[Apache]], Thunderbird possesses superhuman athletic ability. He was a short time member of the "Second Genesis" group of X-Men gathered together in ''Giant-Size X-Men'' #1 as he died on their second mission.

==Fictional character biography==

=== Origins ===
John Proudstar was born into an [[Apache tribe]] on a reservation in [[Camp Verde]], [[Arizona]]. As a teenager, Proudstar discovered he possessed the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] abilities of superhuman senses, strength, speed, stamina, and sturdiness.

Proudstar was [[conscription|drafted]] into the [[United States Marine Corps]] during the [[Vietnam War]] and earned the rank of corporal. He returned to his tribe after the war, but he was unhappy and listless.

=== X-Men ===
He was then recruited by [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]] to join his third group of X-Men.<ref>[http://books.google.fr/books?id=Jn4qwJ7LdMUC&pg=PA86#v=onepage&q&f=false Comic books: how the industry works] by Shirrel Rhoades</ref> Although Proudstar was reluctant to join another white man's crusade, he agreed and assumed the superhero codename '''Thunderbird'''. He assisted the other X-Men in rescuing the original X-Men from [[Krakoa]] the mutant island.<ref>''Giant-Size X-Men'' #1</ref><ref>[http://books.google.fr/books?id=VfLEhSj1FSUC&pg=PT32#v=onepage&q&f=false TeenStuff (May 2006)]</ref>

After successfully completing his first mission with the X-Men, Thunderbird turned out to be so volatile and ill-mannered that he constantly disrupted the team's synchronization. He often found himself going head to head with [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], the appointed leader of the X-Men. This attitude would not change, and ultimately led to an untimely end for Thunderbird.

=== Death ===
Thunderbird had a short career as a hero. The new team's second mission took them to Valhalla Base, Colorado, to combat the [[supervillain]] [[Count Nefaria]].<ref>''X-Men'' #94</ref><ref name=Cornell>[http://jsaw.lib.lehigh.edu/viewarticle.php?id=99 Glossary of Characters] by Mike Cornnell</ref> Thunderbird and the X-Men battled the [[Ani-Men]], in which Proudstar leapt onto an airplane that was carrying Count Nefaria. Despite the urging of [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], Thunderbird refused to get off the plane, stating that he would show that he was a true Apache warrior. The plane exploded, killing Proudstar.<ref name=Cornell/><ref>''X-Men'' #95 (1975)</ref> While Count Nefaria is later revealed to have survived the crash,<ref>''Avengers'' #164</ref> Thunderbird died as the result of his headstrong action.<ref>Gina Ren√©e Misiroglu, Michael Eury, ''The supervillain book: the evil side of comics and Hollywood'', Count Nefaria p.79, Visible Ink Press, 2006, ISBN 9780780809772</ref>

Even in death Thunderbird's legacy carries on. His brother, [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]] (James Proudstar), has similar powers, although to a much greater degree, and is also an X-Man.

=== Necrosha ===
When Warpath goes to visit Thunderbird's grave during the ''[[Necrosha]]'' storyline, he encounters the [[Demon Bear]]. After defeating the creature with the aid of [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]], he finds out that former [[Purifiers|Purifier]] [[Eli Bard]] has dug up Thunderbird and everyone else buried there.<ref>''X-Force'' vol. 3 #10</ref> It is revealed that Bard used a version of the [[Technarchy|Technarch virus]] to resurrect Thunderbird and the others as his servants.<ref>''X-Force'' vol. 3 #11</ref> Thunderbird is later seen with [[Selene (comics)|Selene]]'s Inner Circle and [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]] being led to the ruins of Genosha, which she dubs Necrosha.<ref>''Necrosha'' #1</ref> Thunderbird fights Warpath, who snaps his neck and then kills Selene. Thunderbird's spirit is seen departing, telling his brother that he "can let go now".<ref>''X-Force'' #25</ref>

=== Chaos War ===
During the ''[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]'' storyline, Thunderbird is among the fallen X-Men members (consisting of himself, [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], [[Moira MacTaggert]], Esme and Sophie of the [[Stepford Cuckoos]], and three deceased dupes of [[Jamie Madrox|Multiple Man]]) to return from the dead after what happened to the death realms. He remembers the last time he was briefly revived during the events of Necrosha, albeit faintly. Thunderbird leads the revived X-Men members into looking for a diary written by [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]] that might hold the key to defeating [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (comics)|Amatsu-Mikaboshi]] while evading Carrion Crow, Eater of the Dead.<ref>''[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War: X-Men]]'' #1</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=user_review&id=3030 |title=Review - Chaos War: X-Men #1 |author=Doug Zawisza |work=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=December 29, 2010 |accessdate=November 20, 2011}}</ref> Thunderbird called upon the mythical Thunderbird to get him and his group away from the Carrion Crow. He and the group discover that Moira MacTaggert has been possessed by Destiny's ghost. In the aftermath of the defeat of the Chaos King, Thunderbird is returned to the afterlife after reality is restored by [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]].<ref>''[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War: X-Men]]'' #2</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=user_review&id=3137 |title=Review - Chaos War: X-Men #2 |author=Doug Zawisza |work=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=January 29, 2011 |accessdate=November 20, 2011}}</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Thunderbird is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] that possesses superhuman strength (sufficient to rip apart a fighter jet with his bare hands), speed (he is fast enough to outrun a bison, possibly much faster), stamina, and durability due to his dense musculature.<ref>[http://books.google.fr/books?id=HDnHo993Dv0C&pg=PA206#v=onepage&q&f=false Encyclopedia of weird westerns: supernatural and science fiction elements in novels, pulps, comics, films, television, and games] by Paul Green</ref> His senses are also enhanced, enabling him to become a highly adept [[Tracking (hunting)|tracker]].

Thunderbird has received military training in hand-to-hand combat.

==Analysis==
In ''Native Americans in Comic Books - A Critical Study,'' Michael A. Sheyahshe compared John Proudstar to [[Tupac Shakur]], noting that "Thunderbird becomes even more popular, posthumously, than he ever was while living."<ref>Sheyahshe, Michael (2008). "Native Americans in Comic Books - A Critical Study". McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers. ISBN 978-0-7864-3565-4</ref>

In September 2001, Bill Rosemann, the Marketing Communications Manager of Marvel Comics, announced that "The death of Thunderbird!", ''Uncanny X-Men'' #95 has been classed 32 in the 100 best Marvel Comics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=408 |title=100 Greatest Marvels: The Countdown |author=Jonah Weiland |work=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=September 20, 2001 |accessdate=November 20, 2011}}</ref>

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the so-called [[Age of Apocalypse]], Proudstar provided safe passage to Avalon through the Infernal Gallop. Eventually he met the X-Man Nightcrawler who had the mission to travel to Avalon and bring the mutant known as Destiny. Proudstar refused first only to get his finger taken by Nightcrawler when he accused Nightcrawler's mother Mystique of stripping refugees of everything of worth for her services of transporting refugees to Avalon. The finger was later restored and bandaged, possibly sewn back on.

The Madri discovered Proudstar and the Infernal Gallop's location at Ghost Dance and died from a shot in the back when the Madri infiltrated Greenpoint.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

===Exiles===
An alternate version of John Proudstar is an original member of the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]], a group of superhumans tasked with fixing damaged realities. This Thunderbird is captured by [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] during his time with the X-Men and unwillingly transformed into one of his [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Four Horsemen]], namely [[War (comics)|War]].<ref>''Exiles'' vol. 1 #1</ref>

Thunderbird's time with this group is relatively short, several months at most. He serves mainly as the powerhouse of the group. In the third story arc he meets another alternate version of himself, who has become the [[Shaman (comics)|shaman]] of [[Alpha Flight]], and this arc is largely centered on his internal conflicts.<ref>''Exiles'' vol. 1 #5-6</ref> Later, Thunderbird sacrifices himself to hold an anti-matter bomb within the body of [[Galactus]], which forces the world-devourer to leave Earth after the massive injury the bomb causes. Although his physical body heals from the damage caused by the detonation, his mind is not so fortunate. At the least he has been put into a coma, at the worst he might be brain dead. The Exiles never get a chance to find out, as he is replaced by [[Heather Hudson (Exiles)|Sasquatch]] and the team are forced to leave him behind.<ref name="Exiles10">''Exiles'' vol. 1 #10</ref><ref name=Weiner>[http://books.google.fr/books?id=npIsZV7grboC&pg=PA129#v=onepage&q&f=false Marvel graphic novels and related publications: an annotated guide to comics, prose novels, children's books, articles, criticism and reference works, 1965-2005] by Robert G. Weiner</ref> His body is later discovered in the Panoptichron, a crystal city that lies between realities, but has yet to be returned to his home reality.<ref>''Exiles'' vol. 1 #62</ref>

During his time with the Exiles, he develops a romantic relationship with fellow teammate [[Nocturne (comics)|Nocturne]],<ref>''Exiles'' #1-10</ref> who is pregnant with his child when he becomes comatose.<ref name="Exiles10"/><ref name=Weiner/> (However, she later loses the child for unexplained reasons.{{Issue|date=September 2009}}) This relationship was revisited in issue #16, where we see flashbacks of previously unseen scenes between the two characters that further develop the relationship.<ref name="Exiles 16">''Exiles'' vol. 1 #16</ref>

This version of Thunderbird is considerably more powerful than the mainstream one, due to Apocalypse's augmentations. His skin is covered by retractable armor plates that harden when he enters battle, considerably increasing his durability, and even at base level his power statistics are above his 616 counterpart. His power increases with his rage, akin to the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] who he once defeated in close combat, and his appearance becomes more bestial as he does so.<ref name="Exiles 6">''Exiles'' vol. 1 #6</ref>

A side-effect of Apocalypse's modifications is that Thunderbird no longer has a sense of taste.<ref name="Exiles 6"/> He nevertheless enjoys smelling things.<ref name="Exiles 16"/>

Thunderbird wakes up and escapes the stasis wall in the Panoptichron.<ref>''Exiles'' #97</ref> He helped Psylocke and Cat regain control of the Panoptichron during Doctor Doom's assault,<ref>''Exiles'' #98-99</ref> and was later reunited with Nocturne when the Exiles and New Excalibur teamed up to save [[Roma (comics)|Roma]] and the [[Captain Britain Corps]].<ref>''[[X-Men: Die by the Sword]]'' #1-5</ref> Thunderbird leaves the team shortly after to be with Nocturne on Heather's earth.<ref>''Exiles'' #100</ref>

===House of M===
In the ''[[House of M]]'' reality, John Proudstar appears as a police detective for the NYPD and as the leader of the strikeforce known as the Brotherhood.<ref>''House of M: Avengers'' #2</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=12069|title=Marvel Previews for December 5th |author=CBR News Team |work=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=November 30, 2007 |accessdate=November 20, 2011}}</ref> Proudstar eventually made a deal with [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]], to bring in [[Luke Cage]]'s gang as both a matter of pride and to end his criminal activities.<ref>''House of M: Avengers'' #3</ref>  Thunderbird's efforts resulted in Cage's Avengers battling the Brotherhood, in which their defeat caused Magneto to disband the Brotherhood.<ref>''House of M: Avengers'' #5</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=12638 |title=Marvel Comics On Sale February 27, 2008 |author=CBR News Team |work=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=February 22, 2008 |accessdate=November 20, 2011}}</ref>
