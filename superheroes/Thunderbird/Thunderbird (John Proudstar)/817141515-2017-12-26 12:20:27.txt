'''Thunderbird''' ('''John Proudstar''') is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Thunderbird was briefly a member of the [[X-Men]]. An [[Apache]], Thunderbird possesses superhuman athletic ability. He was a short-time member of the "Second Genesis" group of X-Men gathered together in ''[[Giant-Size X-Men]]'' #1, as he died on their second mission.

==Publication history==
Thunderbird was created by writer [[Len Wein]] and artist [[Dave Cockrum]] for the new [[X-Men]], specifically to be a member of the team who would fail the entrance exam. Having already decided that the previously introduced characters [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]] and [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]] would fail the exam, Wein and Cockrum felt it would be unrealistic for only older characters to "flunk out", and set about creating a new character to fit this role. After developing Thunderbird, however, they decided that they liked the character - his costume in particular - too much to write him off after only one issue, and decided to keep him on.<ref name="TyphoonDave">{{cite news | last = Meth | first= Clifford | date = August 1993 | title = How a Typhoon Blew in Success | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]: X-Men Turn Thirty | issue = | pages = 50–52}}</ref>

The character debuted in ''[[Giant-Size X-Men]]'' #1 (May 1975). While working on the first issues of the regular series, the creative team realized that having Thunderbird as a regular character was problematic. According to Cockrum, "...we created him as an obnoxious loudmouth, and we already had an obnoxious loudmouth in [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]. So one of us decided to kill him off after all, just for shock value."<ref name="TyphoonDave"/> [[Chris Claremont]], who scripted the story, confirms that it was Wein who decided to kill the character, and added, "He figured there are two ways to do this. One, you spend years, if not decades, building up a relationship between the audience and a character, building the emotional bonds between them so when something happens to that character the audience is devastated. Or you do it right off the bat, when no one is expecting it."<ref>{{cite news | last1 = Christensen | first1= William | last2 = Seifert | first2 = Mark | date = August 1993 | title = From Gofer to Comic Great | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]: X-Men Turn Thirty | issue = | pages = 36–40}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Dave Richards |url=http://www.cbr.com/claremont-celebrates-the-past-with-x-men-gold/ |title=Claremont Celebrates the Past with "X-Men: Gold" |publisher=CBR |date=2013-11-20 |accessdate=2017-05-13}}</ref> The story culminating in Thunderbird's death appeared in ''[[X-Men]]'' #94-95.<ref>{{cite web|author=CBR Staff |url=http://www.cbr.com/taking-an-early-look-at-giant-size-x-men-4/ |title=Taking An Early Look at "Giant-Size X-Men" #4 |publisher=CBR |date= |accessdate=2017-05-13}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==

===Origins===
John Proudstar was born into an [[Apache tribe]] on a reservation in [[Camp Verde]], [[Arizona]]. As a teenager, Proudstar discovered he possessed the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] abilities of superhuman senses, strength, speed, stamina, and sturdiness.<ref name="Green">{{cite book|last1=Green|first1=Paul|title=Encyclopedia of Weird Westerns: Supernatural and Science Fiction Elements in Novels, Pulps, Comics, Films, Television and Games|date=2009|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786458004|page=206|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HDnHo993Dv0C&pg=PA206#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=13 May 2017|language=en}}</ref>

Proudstar was [[conscription|drafted]] into the [[United States Marine Corps]] during the [[Vietnam War]] and earned the rank of corporal. He returned to his tribe after the war, but he was unhappy and listless.

===X-Men===
He was then recruited by [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]] to join his third group of X-Men.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rhoades|first1=Shirrel|title=Comic Books: How the Industry Works|date=2008|publisher=Peter Lang|location=New York|isbn=9780820488929|page=86|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jn4qwJ7LdMUC&pg=PA86#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=13 May 2017|language=en}}</ref> Eager to prove his prowess, Proudstar agreed and assumed the superhero codename '''Thunderbird'''. He assisted the other X-Men in rescuing the original X-Men from [[Krakoa]] the mutant island.<ref>[[Len Wein]] (w), [[Dave Cockrum]] (p), [[Dave Cockrum]] (i), Peter Iro (i), "Deadly Genesis!", ''Giant-Size X-Men'' #1 (May 1975)</ref>

During the weeks of training which followed, the ill-tempered and individualistic Thunderbird often found himself going head to head with the X-Men's leader, [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]]. The new team's second mission took them to Valhalla Base, Colorado, to combat [[Count Nefaria]] and the [[Ani-Men]].<ref>[[Chris Claremont]] (w), [[Dave Cockrum]] (p), [[Bob McLeod]] (i), "The Doomsmith Scenario!", [[Uncanny X-Men 94|Uncanny X-Men #94]] (August 1975)</ref><ref name=Cornell>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120304225043/http://jsaw.lib.lehigh.edu/viewarticle.php?id=99&layout=html ]</ref> When Nefaria attempted to make his escape in a jet plane, Proudstar leapt on board. Disregarding [[Professor X]]'s orders to jump to safety, Thunderbird hammered at it with his bare fists. The plane exploded, killing Proudstar.<ref name=Cornell/><ref>[[Chris Claremont]] (w), [[Len Wein]] (w), [[Dave Cockrum]] (p), [[Sam Grainger]] (i), "Warhunt!", ''Uncanny X-Men'' #95 (October 1975)</ref> (Count Nefaria is later revealed to have survived the crash).<ref>[[Jim Shooter]] (w), [[John Byrne]] (w, p), [[Pablo Marcos]] (i), "To Fall by Treachery!", ''Avengers'' #164 (October 1977)</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Misiroglu|first1=Gina|last2=Eury|first2=Michael|title=The Supervillain Book: The Evil Side of Comics and Hollywood |date=2006|publisher=Omnigraphics|location=Detroit, Michigan|isbn=9780780809772|page=79}}</ref>

Thunderbird's brother, [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]] (James Proudstar), has similar powers, although to a much greater degree, and is also an X-Man.<ref name="Green"/>{{rp|220}}

===Necrosha===
When Warpath goes to visit Thunderbird's grave during the ''[[Necrosha]]'' storyline, he encounters the [[Demon Bear]]. After defeating the creature with the aid of [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]], he finds out that former [[Purifiers|Purifier]] [[Eli Bard]] has dug up Thunderbird and everyone else buried there.<ref>''X-Force'' vol. 3 #10</ref> It is revealed that Bard used a version of the [[Technarchy|Technarch virus]] to resurrect Thunderbird and the others as his servants.<ref>''X-Force'' vol. 3 #11</ref> Thunderbird is later seen with [[Selene (comics)|Selene]]'s Inner Circle and [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]] being led to the ruins of Genosha, which she dubs Necrosha.<ref>''Necrosha'' #1</ref> Thunderbird fights Warpath, who snaps his neck and then kills Selene. Thunderbird's spirit is seen departing, telling his brother that he "can let go now".<ref>''X-Force'' #25</ref>

===Chaos War===
During the ''[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]'' storyline, Thunderbird is among the fallen X-Men members (consisting of himself, [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], [[Moira MacTaggert]], Esme and Sophie of the [[Stepford Cuckoos]], and three deceased dupes of [[Jamie Madrox|Multiple Man]]) to return from the dead after what happened to the death realms. He remembers the last time he was briefly revived during the events of Necrosha, albeit faintly. Thunderbird leads the revived X-Men members into looking for a diary written by [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]] that might hold the key to defeating [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (comics)|Amatsu-Mikaboshi]] while evading Carrion Crow, Eater of the Dead.<ref>''[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War: X-Men]]'' #1</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Doug Zawisza |url=http://www.cbr.com/chaos-war-x-men-1/ |title=Chaos War: X-Men #1 - Comic Book Review |publisher=CBR |date=2010-12-29 |accessdate=2017-05-13}}</ref> Thunderbird called upon the mythical Thunderbird to get him and his group away from the Carrion Crow. He and the group discover that Moira MacTaggert has been possessed by Destiny's ghost. In the aftermath of the defeat of the Chaos King, Thunderbird is returned to the afterlife after reality is restored by [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]]. Thunderbird contemplated that his life finally meant something and hoped that next time he was resurrected, it would be with Sophie.<ref>''[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War: X-Men]]'' #2</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Doug Zawisza |url=http://www.cbr.com/chaos-war-x-men-2/ |title=Chaos War: X-Men #2 - Comic Book Review |publisher=CBR |date=2011-01-29 |accessdate=2017-05-13}}</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Thunderbird was a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] that possesses superhuman strength (sufficient to rip apart a fighter jet with his bare hands), speed (he was fast enough to outrun a bison, possibly much faster), and stamina due to his dense musculature.<ref name="Green"/> His senses were also enhanced, enabling him to become a highly adept [[Tracking (hunting)|tracker]].

Thunderbird had received military training in hand-to-hand combat.

==Analysis==
In ''Native Americans in Comic Books - A Critical Study,'' Michael A. Sheyahshe compared John Proudstar to [[Tupac Shakur]], noting that "Thunderbird becomes even more popular, posthumously, than he ever was while living."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sheyahshe |first1=Michael A. |title=Native Americans in Comic Books - A Critical Study |date=2008 |publisher=McFarland & Co. |location=Jefferson, North Carolina |page=12-13 |isbn=9780786435654}}</ref>

In September 2001, Bill Rosemann, the Marketing Communications Manager of Marvel Comics, announced that "The death of Thunderbird!", ''Uncanny X-Men'' #95 has been classed 32 in the 100 best Marvel Comics.<ref>{{cite web|author=CBR Staff |url=http://www.cbr.com/100-greatest-marvels-the-countdown/ |title=100 Greatest Marvels: The Countdown |publisher=CBR |date=2001-09-20 |accessdate=2017-05-13}}</ref>

==Other versions==

===Age of Apocalypse===
In the [[Age of Apocalypse]], Proudstar provided safe passage to Avalon through the Infernal Gallop.{{issue|date=July 2012}} Eventually he met the X-Man [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] who had the mission to travel to Avalon and bring the mutant known as Destiny. Proudstar refused first only to get his finger taken by Nightcrawler when he accused Nightcrawler's mother Mystique of stripping refugees of everything of worth for her services of transporting refugees to Avalon.{{issue|date=July 2012}} The finger was later restored and bandaged, possibly sewn back on.{{issue|date=July 2012}}

The Madri discovered Proudstar and the Infernal Gallop's location at Ghost Dance and died from a shot in the back when the Madri infiltrated Greenpoint.<ref>''X-Calibre'' #2 (1995)</ref>

===Earth X===
In the ''[[Earth X]]'' reality, Thunderbird was seen in the Realm of the Dead talking with Professor X.<ref>''Earth X'' #7</ref>

===Exiles===
An alternate version of John Proudstar is an original member of the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]], a group of superhumans tasked with fixing damaged realities. This Thunderbird is captured by [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] during his time with the X-Men and unwillingly transformed into one of his [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Four Horsemen]], namely [[War (Marvel Comics character)|War]].<ref>''Exiles'' #1</ref>

Thunderbird's time with this group is relatively short, several months at most. He serves mainly as the powerhouse of the group. In the third story arc he meets another alternate version of himself, who has become the [[Shaman (comics)|shaman]] of [[Alpha Flight]], and this arc is largely centered on his internal conflicts.<ref>''Exiles'' #5-6</ref> Later, Thunderbird sacrifices himself to hold an anti-matter bomb within the body of [[Galactus]], which forces the world-devourer to leave Earth after the massive injury the bomb causes. Although his physical body heals from the damage caused by the detonation, he is left in a coma. He is replaced by [[Heather Hudson (Exiles)|Sasquatch]] and the team are forced to leave him behind.<ref name="Exiles10">''Exiles'' #10</ref><ref name="Wiener">{{cite book|last1=Wiener|first1=Robert G.|title=Marvel Graphic Novels and Related Publications: An Annotated Guide to Comics, Prose Novels, Children’s Books, Articles, Criticism and Reference Works, 1965–2005|date=2008|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn=9780786451159|page=129|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=npIsZV7grboC&pg=PA129#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=13 May 2017|language=en}}</ref> His body is later discovered in the Panoptichron, a crystal city that lies between realities, but has yet to be returned to his home reality.<ref>''Exiles'' #62</ref>

During his time with the Exiles, he develops a romantic relationship with teammate [[Nocturne (Talia Wagner)|Nocturne]],<ref>''Exiles'' #1-10</ref> who is pregnant with his child when he becomes comatose.<ref name="Exiles10"/><ref name="Wiener"/> (However, she later loses the child for unexplained reasons.{{Issue|date=September 2009}}) Issue #16 shows flashbacks of previously unseen scenes between the two characters that further develop their relationship.<ref name="Exiles 16">''Exiles'' #16</ref>

This version of Thunderbird is considerably more powerful than the mainstream one, due to Apocalypse's augmentations. His skin is covered by retractable armor plates that harden when he enters battle, considerably increasing his durability, and even at base level his power statistics are above his 616 counterpart. His power increases with his rage, akin to the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] who he once defeated in close combat, and his appearance becomes more bestial as he does so.<ref name="Exiles 6">''Exiles'' #6</ref>

A side-effect of Apocalypse's modifications is that Thunderbird no longer has a sense of taste.<ref name="Exiles 6"/> He nevertheless enjoys smelling things.<ref name="Exiles 16"/>

Thunderbird wakes up and escapes the stasis wall in the Panoptichron.<ref>''Exiles'' #97</ref> He helps Psylocke and Cat regain control of the Panoptichron during Doctor Doom's assault,<ref>''Exiles'' #98-99</ref> and is later reunited with Nocturne when the Exiles and New Excalibur teamed up to save [[Roma (comics)|Roma]] and the [[Captain Britain Corps]].<ref>[[Chris Claremont]] (w), Juan Santacruz (p), Raul Fernandez (i), ''[[X-Men: Die by the Sword]]'' #1-5 (December 2007-February 2008)</ref> Thunderbird leaves the team shortly after to be with Nocturne on Heather's earth.<ref>''Exiles'' #100</ref>

===House of M===
In the ''[[House of M]]'' reality, John Proudstar appears as a police [[detective]] for the [[New York Police Department|NYPD]] and as the leader of the strike force known as the "[[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood]]."<ref>''House of M: Avengers'' #2</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=CBR Staff |url=http://www.cbr.com/marvel-previews-for-december-5th/ |title=Marvel Previews for December 5th |publisher=CBR |date=2007-11-30 |accessdate=2017-05-13}}</ref> Proudstar eventually made a deal with [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]] to bring in [[Luke Cage]]'s gang as both a matter of pride and to end his criminal activities.<ref>''House of M: Avengers'' #3</ref> Thunderbird's efforts resulted in Cage's Avengers battling the Brotherhood, in which their defeat caused Magneto to disband the Brotherhood.<ref>''House of M: Avengers'' #5</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=CBR Staff |url=http://www.cbr.com/marvel-comics-on-sale-february-27-2008/ |title=Marvel Comics On Sale February 27, 2008 |publisher=CBR |date=2008-02-22 |accessdate=2017-05-13}}</ref>
