'''Thunderbird''' (John Proudstar) is a [[comic book]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], and a member of the [[X-Men]].  He first appeared in ''Giant-Size X-Men'' #1 (May [[1975]]).

Proudstar is an [[Apache Tribe|Apache]] [[Native American]] who had once been a corporal in the [[United States Marine Corps]].  He was recruited by [[Professor Charles Xavier]] to join his second group of X-Men.  Although Proudstar had a big chip on his shoulder towards white men, he agreed.  His tenure with the team was short, however, as he was killed trying to stop a ploy by [[Count Nefaria]] (in ''X-Men'' volume 1 #95).

Proudstar possessed great strength, agility and damage resistance.

He is survived by a younger brother, '''James Proudstar''', who also adopted the name Thunderbird briefly before taking on the name '''[[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]]'''.  James has similar abilities yet much greater physical strength, and recently gained the ability to fly.

An [[parallel world|alternate world]] version of John Proudstar is a member and founder of the dimension-hopping team [[Exiles (comics)|The Exiles]].  This Thunderbird was captured and modified by [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] before escaping and turning on his captor.  As a result he is a half-machine creature with immense strength and damage resistance, capable of taking on [[The Incredible Hulk]].  However, he was injured in a battle with [[Galactus]] and was left in a coma in that dimension. He thought his pregnant girlfriend [[Nocturne]] and the child she was carrying would survive, but later she lost their baby. Thunderbird's ultimate fate is unknown.

Most recently, '''Neal Shaara''', a mutant from India with the ability to generate solar plasma has taken the name and served in the X-Men.
