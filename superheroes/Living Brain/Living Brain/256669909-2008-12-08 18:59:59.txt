The '''Living Brain''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[comic book]] [[supervillain]] and robot in the {{Marvel Universe}}. Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]], the character first appears in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #8 and has made few subsequent appearances since.

A foe of the hero [[Spider-Man]], the Living Brain was created by the fictional International Computing Machines Corporation and billed as the most intelligent computer and robot in existence, capable of solving virtually any question asked of it.

== Fictional character history ==

The Living Brain, soon after its creation, is brought to Midtown High School by its creator, Dr. Petty, as a part of a demonstration of its ability to solve any problem. After the Living Brain's demonstration, two workmen hired to transport it overhear the Living Brain's ability to answer anything, and decide to steal it, in order to use its abilities for gambling purposes. Caught in the middle of stealing the Living Brain by Dr. Petty, the two workmen get into a scuffle with him, which ends with one of them being knocked into the control panel on the Living Brain's chest, which causes the Living Brain to malfunction. Going on a rampage through Midtown High, the Living Brain is eventually shut down by Spider-Man, who destroys its control panel, in a brief fight. <ref> {{Cite comic

The Living Brain reappears several years later, now discredited and broken-down, Dr. Petty plans to donate it to Midtown High School's science lab. The Living Brain ends up being stolen by Dr. Petty's son, Steve Petty, who modifies the robot, giving it a gold and red color scheme, clawed hands and the ability to fly. Remotely controlling the Living Brain to attack a bully who had been tormenting him, Steve is eventually defeated by Spider-Man (who had been on a visit to Midtown High as Peter Parker) and the Living Brain is shut down once more. <ref> {{Cite comic
