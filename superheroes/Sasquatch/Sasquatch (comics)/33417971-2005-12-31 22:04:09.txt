'''Sasquatch''' is a [[fictional character]] in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He first appeared in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #120 and was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne]].
==Character biography==
Dr. Walter Langkowski is a member of [[Alpha Flight]], a native of [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]] of [[Poland|Polish]] origin and a renowned [[physicist]]. He is also a former [[linebacker]] for the [[Green Bay Packers]]. 

He possesses the ability to transform into a super-strong, orange-haired beast resembling the legendary [[Sasquatch]] or [[Bigfoot]]. This transformation is triggered by willpower. In his transformed state, Langkowski has increased strength, stamina and resistance to injury. He also has sharp claws on the end of all five digits, and is able to leap incredible distances.

These powers came as a result of Langkowski's own doing. In an attempt to become like the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], Langkowski bombarded himself with [[gamma radiation]] at his laboratory near the [[Arctic Circle]]. As a proposed explanation for why he transformed into an orange instead of green behemoth (as gamma-irradiated persons are usually affected), Langkowski assumed it had something to do with the [[Aurora Borealis]].

However, unbeknownst to Langkowski, it was not the gamma rays that turned him into Sasquatch, but the fact that his lab equipment opened a doorway between our world and the "Realm of Great Beasts." When this portal was opened, a mystical beast called [[Tanaraq]] invaded Langkowski's body and granted him his powers. Langkowski had to learn to maintain his own personality and intelligence when in the form of Sasquatch, and was very successful for a time. But Tanaraq eventually took control of Sasquatch, forcing [[Snowbird (comics)|Snowbird]] to slay Langkowski.

===A new body and a new identity===
Sasquatch was subsequently brought back to life, free of the influence of Tanaraq, by inhabiting the body of the then-deceased Snowbird.  At first limited to transforming between Snowbird's human form and a white-furred version of his Sasquatch form, he called himself "Wanda Langkowski" and fought to be recognized as legally alive.  This body was later altered to be identical to his original body.

===The true Sasquatch===
Another Sasquatch, this one a barely intelligent monster, appeared in ''Alpha Flight'' volume 2.  Although his teammates believed this Sasquatch to be a highly degenerated Langkowski, it was an actual [[sasquatch]] that had been captured by Department H.  The sasquatch died in the final conflict with Department H's corrupt leadership and the [[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac]].  Langkowski soon returned to active membership in Alpha Flight.

In ''Alpha Flight'' volume 3 issue #1, Sasquatch assembled another incarnation of [[Alpha Flight]], with entirely new members, in order to rescue the original team from an alien race known as the Plodex. Sales were poor, and the series was canceled with issue #12.

==Powers and Abilities==
In his Sasquatch form Langkowski possesses vast superhuman strength and heightened endurance. His strength is of an order inferior to the Hulk and has an upward limit of 70 tons.  (Although, like most of the official Marvel strength statistics, this is incredibly low when compared to some of the feats of strength performed by the character in the comic book pages.)  When completely possessed by Tanaraq, Sasquatch was several times as powerful. Sasquatch is also highly agile and able to jump great distances. His resistance to conventional injury is superhuman in this form. Langkowski's Sasquatch form is 10 ft. in height and weighs approximately 1 ton. Early on, changing from his human form into his Sasquatch form caused Langkowski extreme phyiscal discomfort. To alleviate the pain, Langkowski recited a slow mantra which served the same purpose as a yoga practitioner concentrating on his/her craft, to calm the body and to divorce pain from the physical body. Through years of practice, he can now achieve his Sasquatch form with relative little pain or effort.

Langkowski is a professionally trained scientist with experience dealing with many forms of experimental radiation and their mutagenic effects on lifeforms under controlled settings. As a former professional football player, Langkowski has highly athletic physical strength and endurance, though he is no longer in the peak condition of his life.

==Exiles (Sasquatch of alternate Earth)==

{{main|Heather Hudson (Exiles)}}
In the [[Exiles (comics)|Exiles]], there was a Sasquatch from an alternate universe. This Sasquatch was an [[African American]] woman, Heather Hudson, who apparently is a counterpart to Earth-616's [[Vindicator|Heather Hudson]] in role (she was an Alpha Flight member in her native reality) but not in appearance or genetic code.
