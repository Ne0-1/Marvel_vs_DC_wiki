'''Sasquatch''' ('''Walter Langkowski''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He first appeared in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #120 and was created by [[John Byrne]].

==Fictional character biography==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Sasquatchaf.png|thumb|200|left|Sasquatch<br>Art by [[Clayton Henry]].]] -->
'''Dr. Walter Langkowski''' is a member of [[Alpha Flight]], a native of [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]] of [[Polish Canadian|Polish]] origin and a renowned [[physicist]]. He is also a former [[American football]] player for the [[Green Bay Packers]]. 

He possesses the [[shapeshifting|ability to transform]] into a super-strong, orange-haired beast resembling the legendary [[Bigfoot|Sasquatch]]. This transformation is triggered by willpower. In his transformed state, Langkowski has increased strength, stamina, and resistance to injury. He also has sharp claws and is able to leap incredible distances.

These powers were a result of Langkowski's self-experimentation with [[gamma ray| gamma radiation]]. In an attempt to become like the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], Langkowski bombarded himself with a gamma ray projector at his laboratory near the [[Arctic Circle]]. As a proposed explanation for why he transformed into an orange instead of green behemoth (as gamma-irradiated persons are usually affected), Langkowski assumed it had something to do with the [[Aurora (astronomy)|Aurora Borealis]].

However, unbeknownst to Langkowski, it was not the gamma rays that turned him into Sasquatch, but the fact that his lab equipment opened a doorway between our world and the "Realm of [[Great Beasts]]." When this portal was opened, a mystical beast called Tanaraq invaded Langkowski's body and granted him his powers. Langkowski had to learn to maintain his own personality and intelligence when in the form of Sasquatch, and was very successful for a time. However, Tanaraq eventually took control of Sasquatch, forcing [[Snowbird (comics)|Snowbird]] to slay Langkowski.

===A new body and a new identity===
After his death, Langkowski's teammates traveled to the realm of the Great Beasts to recover his soul, but a preservation spell cast by Alpha's resident sorcerer, [[Shaman (comics)|Shaman]], failed to prevent Langkowski's body from crumbling to dust.  In desperation, Shaman projected the soul into the robot exoskeleton of [[Box (comics)|Box]], who had arrived just as the Alphans returned to Earth. After some searching for an alternate form, Langkowski and Box's creator, Roger Bochs, eventually scanned a humanoid, nearly mindless body trapped in another dimension. However, when the pair projected Langkowski's soul towards this body across an interdimensional "fishing line", it turned out to be the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], and Langkowski, unwilling to displace his colleague and friend Bruce Banner (despite Banner's pleas to the contrary), let his soul dissipate into the interdimensional void.

Sasquatch was subsequently brought back to life first by temporarily inhabiting the miniaturized body of [[Smart Alec (comics)|Smart Alec]], then by inhabiting the body of the then-deceased Snowbird. At first limited to transforming between Snowbird's (female) human form and a white-furred version of his Sasquatch form, he called himself "Wanda Langkowski" and fought to be recognized as legally alive. This body was later mystically altered to be identical to his original body. After this, his Sasquatch form returned to its original orange hue.

In 2005, Sasquatch assembled [[Alpha Flight#Volume 3 - "All-New, All-Different" Alpha Flight|another incarnation]] of Alpha Flight<ref>''Alpha Flight'' volume 3 #1</ref> in order to rescue the original team from an alien race known as the [[List of Marvel Comics alien races#P|Plodex]]. Sales were poor, and the series was canceled with issue #12.

===Surviving his team===
Along with [[Major Mapleleaf]], [[Puck (comics)|Puck]] I and II, [[Vindicator (comics)|Vindicator]], [[Shaman (comics)|Shaman]], and [[Guardian (Marvel Comics)|Guardian]], Sasquatch fights [[Xorn#The Collective|The Collective]] in ''[[New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' #16. He is later revealed to be the only member of Alpha Flight to survive the attack. Following the events of Marvel's [[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]], Langkowski is recruited by the Canadian government to form a new team called [[Omega Flight#Post-Civil War|Omega Flight]]. He goes out of control possessed by the Great Beast, Tanaraq, but manages to recover. He also forgives [[Weapon Omega|Michael Pointer]] for the indirect role he played in the destruction of Alpha Flight and apologized for forcing him into the role of Guardian. Recently, Sasquatch has gone to [[Wakanda (Marvel)|Wakanda]], along with [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]], [[Thornn]], and [[Feral (comics)|Feral]]. The group offers their assistance to Wolverine against [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]]. Feral is killed by Sabretooth and in the meantime, the villain [[Romulus (Marvel Comics)|Romulus]] is forming plans of his own involving the group.

==Powers and abilities==
In his Sasquatch form, Langkowski possesses superhuman strength and heightened endurance as well as high degree of resistance to injury that enabled him to go toe-to-toe with The [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and survive (In fact in his first appearance, Sasquatch fought The Hulk for "fun" in order to test the limits of his own strength.).  He also has a healing factor.

Early in his career, changing from his human form into his Sasquatch form caused Langkowski extreme physical discomfort.<ref>Alpha Flight v1 #1</ref> To alleviate the pain, Langkowski recites a slow mantra which serves the same purpose as a yoga practitioner concentrating on his/her craft, to calm the body and to divorce pain from the physical body.{{Fact|date=January 2007}} Since taking over [[Snowbird (comics)|Snowbird]]'s original body, he can now achieve his Sasquatch form with relatively little pain or effort. {{Fact|date=January 2007}}

Langkowski is a professionally trained scientist with experience dealing with many forms of experimental radiation and their mutagenic effects on lifeforms under controlled settings. As a former professional football player, Langkowski has highly athletic physical strength and endurance, though he is no longer in the peak condition of his life.

==Other versions==

===Exiles===
{{main|Heather Hudson (Exiles)}}

A white-haired entity who seemed to be Walter Langowski joins the inter-dimensional team of heroes dedicated to fixing breaks in the time line. It is soon revealed that she is a black woman named Heather Hudson, shocking the team who are familiar with versions of Walter.

===Howling Commandos===
In ''[[Nick Fury's Howling Commandos]]'', a series published in late 2005 and early 2006, a new intelligent Sasquatch appeared. What, if any, connection this character has to Walter Langkowski or the Sasquatch from ''Alpha Flight'' volume 2, was never revealed.

===Marvel Zombies===
In the [[Marvel Zombies]] comics set in the universe of Earth-2149 the zombified [[Alpha Flight#Marvel Zombies|Alpha Flight]] attack the [[X-Men#Alternate Universes|X-Men]] and are eventually killed by [[Alternate versions of Magneto#Marvel Zombies|Magneto]]. Sasquatch is seen in a panel of Marvel Zombies Dead Days attacking the X-Man [[Alternate versions of Wolverine#Marvel Zombies|Wolverine]].  He is killed alongside the rest of zombie Alpha Flight by Magneto in the next panel.

===Ultimate Sasquatch===
An Ultimate version of Sasquatch was referenced as killed off-panel 
during the [[Ultimate X-Men]] arc "Shock and Awe." Sasquatch makes an official appearance in the first part of the ''Ultimate X-Men'''s "Absolute Power" arc, as a member of [[Alpha Flight#Ultimate Alpha Flight|Alpha Flight]]. Sasquatch, more savage than 616 counterpart, appears to know Rogue and experienced her powers first hand, though Rogue does not recognize the character.   The character is revealed to be [[Wolfsbane (comics)#Ultimate Wolfsbane|Rahne Sinclair]], under the influence to the power enhancing drug [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], after reverting to her "powered down" form.  <ref> Ultimate X-Men #95</ref> Sasquatch is injured by [[Ultimate Nightcrawler|Nightcrawler]], who while trying to teleport her away, accidentally, teleports part of her arm off.

===Unintelligible monster===
Another Sasquatch, this one a barely intelligent monster, appeared in ''Alpha Flight'' volume 2. Although his teammates believed this Sasquatch to be a highly degenerated Langkowski, it was an actual [[Bigfoot|sasquatch]] that had been captured by Department H. He was kept in control by the touch of the superpowered [[Murmur (Marvel Comics)#Murmur (Arlette Truffaut)|Murmur]], though this was not always successful. This Sasquatch died in the final conflict with Department H's corrupt leadership and the [[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac]]. Langkowski soon returned to active membership in Alpha Flight.
