Sasquatch is a [[fictional character]]. 

Dr. Walter Langkowski is an original member of [[Alpha Flight]], a native of [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]] and a renowned [[physicist]]. 

He possesses the mutant ability to transform into a super strong, orange haired beast resembling the legendary [[Sasquatch]] or [[Bigfoot]]. He can transform at will. In his transformed state, Langkowski has increased strength, stamina and resistance to injury. He also has sharp claws on the end of all five digits, and is able to leap incredible distances.

Sasquatch has recently assembled the current incarnation of the team, with entirely new members, in order to rescue the original team from an alien race known as the Plodex.
