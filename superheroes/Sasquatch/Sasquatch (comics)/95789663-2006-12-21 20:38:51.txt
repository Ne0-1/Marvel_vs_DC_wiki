'''Sasquatch''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He first appeared in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #120 and was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne]].

==Character biography==
'''Dr. Walter Langkowski''' is a member of [[Alpha Flight]], a native of [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]] of [[Poland|Polish]] origin and a renowned [[physicist]]. He is also a former [[pro wrestler]] for the [[World Wrestling Entertainment]]. 

He possesses the [[shapeshifting|ability to transform]] into a super-strong, orange-haired beast resembling the legendary [[Sasquatch]]. This transformation is triggered by willpower. In his transformed state, Langkowski has increased strength, stamina and resistance to injury. He also has sharp claws and is able to leap incredible distances.

These powers come as a result of Langkowski's own doing. In an attempt to become like the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], Langkowski bombarded himself with [[gamma radiation]] at his laboratory near the [[Arctic Circle]]. As a proposed explanation for why he transformed into an orange instead of green behemoth (as gamma-irradiated persons are usually affected), Langkowski assumed it had something to do with the [[Aurora Borealis]].

However, unbeknownst to Langkowski, it was not the gamma rays that turned him into Sasquatch, but the fact that his lab equipment opened a doorway between our world and the "Realm of Great Beasts." When this portal was opened, a mystical beast called [[Tanaraq]] invaded Langkowski's body and granted him his powers. Langkowski had to learn to maintain his own personality and intelligence when in the form of Sasquatch, and was very successful for a time. But Tanaraq eventually took control of Sasquatch, forcing [[Snowbird (comics)|Snowbird]] to slay Langkowski.

===A new body and a new identity===
Sasquatch was subsequently brought back to life, free of the influence of Tanaraq, by inhabiting the body of the then-deceased Snowbird. At first limited to transforming between Snowbird's human form and a white-furred version of his Sasquatch form, he called himself "Wanda Langkowski" and fought to be recognized as legally alive. This body was later altered to be identical to his original body.

In ''Alpha Flight'' volume 3 #1, Sasquatch assembled another incarnation of [[Alpha Flight]], with entirely new members, in order to rescue the original team from an alien race known as the Plodex. Sales were poor, and the series was canceled with issue #12.

{{spoiler}}
Along with [[Major Mapleleaf]], [[Puck (comics)|Puck]] I and II, Vindicator, Sasquatch, [[Shaman (comics)|Shaman]] and Guardian, Sasquatch was among the Alpha Flight members to be seemingly killed by [[The Collective (comics)|The Collective]] in ''[[New Avengers (comic book)|New Avengers]]'' #16.

==Powers and abilities==
In his Sasquatch form Langkowski possesses superhuman strength with so far unknown limits and heightened endurance. When completely possessed by Tanaraq, Sasquatch was several times as powerful. Sasquatch is also highly agile and able to jump great distances. His resistance to conventional injury is superhuman in this form.
It is stated that Sasquatch can lift/press 70 tons. However, in his first appearance, he held a DC-10 jet aloft, against the thrust of its' engines, eventually throwing the plane several hundred feet. He is later shown combatting Colossus, who can also lift 70 tons and Sasquatch is clearly the stronger of the two. In a battle with Ben Grimm, Sasquatch observes that he is stronger (Ben Grimm can lift 85 tons), and in a Hulk Annual, Sasquatch is shown lifting a fully armed naval destroyer out of the water so it can be repaired. He had initially towed the ship in to be repaired, and subsequently pushed it back into deep water.
Thus, his strength has been consistantly demonstrated to be greater than any listed quantification.

Early in his career, changing from his human form into his Sasquatch form caused Langkowski extreme physical discomfort. To alleviate the pain, Langkowski recites a slow mantra which serves the same purpose as a yoga practitioner concentrating on his/her craft, to calm the body and to divorce pain from the physical body. Since taking over [[Snowbird (comics)|Snowbird]]'s original body, he can now achieve his Sasquatch form with relatively little pain or effort. 

Langkowski is a professionally trained scientist with experience dealing with many forms of experimental radiation and their mutagenic effects on lifeforms under controlled settings. As a former professional football player, Langkowski has highly athletic physical strength and endurance, though he is no longer in the peak condition of his life.

==Other versions==
Another Sasquatch, this one a barely intelligent monster, appeared in ''Alpha Flight'' volume 2. Although his teammates believed this Sasquatch to be a highly degenerated Langkowski, it was an actual [[sasquatch]] that had been captured by Department H. This Sasquatch died in the final conflict with Department H's corrupt leadership and the [[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac]]. Langkowski soon returned to active membership in Alpha Flight.

In ''[[Nick Fury's Howling Commandos]]'', a series published in late 2005 and early 2006, a new intelligent Sasquatch appeared. What, if any, connection this character has to Walter Lankowski or the sasquatch from ''Alpha Flight'' volume 2, was never revealed.

The Ultimate Version of Sasquatch recently appeared in Ultimate Spider Man #101, the result of [[Mary Jane Watson]] being treated with the OZ serum by the disfigured Peter clone, turning her into a giant hairy red monster.

==Appearance in Media==
