'''Sasquatch''' ('''Walter Langkowski''') is a [[fiction]]al [[character (arts)|character]], a [[superhero]] in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He [[first appearance|first appeared]] in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #120 and was created by [[John Byrne]].

==Fictional character biography==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Sasquatchaf.png|thumb|200|left|Sasquatch<br>Art by [[Clayton Henry]].]] -->
'''Dr. Walter Langkowski''' is a member of [[Alpha Flight]], a native of [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]] of [[Polish Canadians|Polish]] origin and a renowned [[physicist]], and a professor of both physics and biophysics at [[McGill University]]<ref>http://publications.mcgill.ca/mcgillnews/2010/03/15/make-believe-mcgillies/</ref>. He is also a former [[American football]] player for the [[Green Bay Packers]]. 

He possesses the [[shapeshifting|ability to transform]] into a super-strong, orange-haired beast resembling the legendary [[Bigfoot|Sasquatch]]. This transformation is triggered by willpower. In his transformed state, Langkowski has increased strength, stamina, and resistance to injury. He also has sharp claws and is able to leap incredible distances.

These powers were a result of Langkowski's self-experimentation with [[gamma ray|gamma radiation]]. In an attempt to become like the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], Langkowski bombarded himself with a gamma ray projector at his laboratory near the [[Arctic Circle]]. As a proposed explanation for why he transformed into an orange instead of green behemoth (as gamma-irradiated persons are usually affected), Langkowski assumed it had something to do with the [[Aurora (astronomy)|Aurora Borealis]].

However, unknown to Langkowski, it was not the gamma rays that turned him into Sasquatch, but the fact that his lab equipment opened a doorway between our world and the "Realm of [[Great Beasts]]." When this portal was opened, a mystical beast called Tanaraq invaded Langkowski's body and granted him his powers. Langkowski had to learn to maintain his own personality and intelligence when in the form of Sasquatch, and was very successful for a time.

===Alpha Flight===
As a member of the Canadian superhero team [[Alpha Flight]], Sasquatch battled the [[X-Men]] in an attempt to capture [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]].<ref>''X-Men'' #120–121</ref> He later battled the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]],<ref>''Incredible Hulk Annual'' #8</ref> and then, alongside the Hulk, battled the [[Wendigo (comics)|Wendigo]].<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 2 #272</ref> Alongside Alpha Flight again, he battled the Great Beast [[Tundra (Marvel Comics)|Tundra]].<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #1</ref> With Alpha Flight, [[Namor]], and the [[Invisible Woman]], he first encountered the [[Master of the World (comics)|Master of the World]].<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #4</ref> He then battled the [[Super-Skrull]].<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #9–10</ref> With Alpha Flight, he battled [[Omega Flight]].<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #12</ref> Alongside [[Rom (comics)|Rom]] and Alpha Flight, he battled the [[Dire Wraith]]s.<ref>''Rom'' #56–58</ref> With Alpha Flight, he went on a mission with the X-Men and clashed with [[Loki (comics)|Loki]].<ref>''X-Men and Alpha Flight'' #1–2</ref> His Sasquatch form was eventually revealed as an incarnation of Tanaraq, who took control of Sasquatch, forcing [[Snowbird (comics)|Snowbird]] to slay Langkowski.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #23</ref>

===A new body and a new identity===
After his death, Langkowski's teammates traveled to the realm of the Great Beasts to recover his soul, but a preservation spell cast by Alpha's resident sorcerer, [[Shaman (comics)|Shaman]], failed to prevent Langkowski's body from crumbling to dust.  In desperation, Shaman projected the soul into the robot exoskeleton of [[Box (comics)|Box]], who had arrived just as the Alphans returned to Earth.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #24</ref> After some searching for an alternate form, Langkowski and Box's creator, Roger Bochs, eventually scanned a humanoid, nearly mindless body trapped in another dimension. However, when the pair projected Langkowski's soul towards this body across an interdimensional "fishing line", it turned out to be the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], and Langkowski, unwilling to displace his colleague and friend Bruce Banner (despite Banner's pleas to the contrary), let his soul dissipate into the interdimensional void.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #28-29</ref>

Sasquatch was subsequently brought back to life first by temporarily inhabiting the miniaturized body of [[Smart Alec (comics)|Smart Alec]],{{Issue|date=April 2009}} then by inhabiting the body of the then-deceased Snowbird.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' 451</ref> At first limited to transforming between Snowbird's (female) human form and a white-furred version of his Sasquatch form, he called himself "Wanda Langkowski" and fought to be recognized as legally alive.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} This body was later mystically altered to be identical to his original body by Snowbird's spirit.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #68</ref> After this, his Sasquatch form returned to its original orange hue. With Alpha Flight, he first battled [[Llan the Sorcerer]].<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #71-75</ref> With Alpha Flight, alongside the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], and the [[Supreme Soviets|People's Protectorate]], he battled the [[Homo mermanus|Atlantean]] army, the Peace Corpse, and the Combine.<ref>''Avengers'' #320-324</ref> Alongside Alpha Flight, he defended [[Kismet (Marvel Comics)|Her]] against the Consortium.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #97-100</ref>

In 2005, Sasquatch assembled [[Alpha Flight#Volume 3: "All-New, All-Different" Alpha Flight|another incarnation]] of Alpha Flight<ref>''Alpha Flight'' volume 3 #1</ref> in order to rescue the original team from an alien race known as the [[List of alien races in Marvel Comics#P|Plodex]]. Sales were poor, and the series was canceled with issue #12.

===Surviving his team===
Along with [[Major Mapleleaf]], [[Puck (comics)|Puck]] I and II, [[Vindicator (comics)|Vindicator]], [[Shaman (comics)|Shaman]], and [[Guardian (Marvel Comics)|Guardian]], Sasquatch fights [[Xorn#The Collective|The Collective]].<ref>''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' #16</ref> He is later revealed to be the only member of Alpha Flight to survive the attack. Following the events of Marvel's [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]], Langkowski is recruited by the Canadian government to form a new team called [[Omega Flight#Canadian superhero team|Omega Flight]]. He goes out of control possessed by the Great Beast, Tanaraq, but manages to recover. He also forgives [[Michael Pointer (comics)|Michael Pointer]] for the indirect role he played in the destruction of Alpha Flight and apologized for forcing him into the role of Guardian. Sasquatch has gone to [[Wakanda (comics)|Wakanda]], along with [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]], [[Thornn]], and [[Feral (comics)|Feral]]. The group offers their assistance to Wolverine against [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]]. Feral is killed by Sabretooth and in the meantime, the villain [[Romulus (comics)|Romulus]] forms plans of his own involving the group.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

===Chaos War===
During Chaos War Sasquatch makes a deal with the Great Beasts, bringing them to Earth so they can kill Amatusu-Mikaboshi. However they are all killed by him.{{issue|date=December 2010}}

==Powers and abilities==
In his Sasquatch form, Langkowski possesses superhuman strength and heightened endurance as well as a high degree of resistance to injury that enabled him to go toe-to-toe with the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and survive (in an early appearance, Sasquatch fought the Hulk for "fun" in order to test the limits of his own strength).  Sasquatch has proven sufficiently strong enough to pull a naval destroyer ashore for repairs,<ref>''Incredible Hulk Annual'' #8, 1979</ref> and to hold a DC-10 against the thrust of its engines and then hurl the plane over 1,000 feet backwards.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #120, 1979</ref>  He also has a healing factor.

Early in his career, changing from his human form into his Sasquatch form caused Langkowski extreme physical discomfort.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' v1 #1</ref> To alleviate the pain, Langkowski recites a slow mantra which serves the same purpose as a yoga practitioner concentrating on his/her craft, to calm the body and to divorce pain from the physical body.{{Citation needed|date=January 2007}} Since taking over [[Snowbird (comics)|Snowbird]]'s original body, he can now achieve his Sasquatch form with relatively little pain or effort.{{Citation needed|date=January 2007}}

Langkowski is a professionally trained scientist with a Ph.D. in physics and an extensive knowledge of physics. He is an expert on the effects of radiation on human physiology, and has experience dealing with many forms of experimental radiation and their mutagenic effects on life forms under controlled settings. As a former professional football player, Langkowski has highly athletic physical strength and endurance, though he is no longer in the peak condition of his life. Sasquatch is an above-average hand-to-hand combatant although he relies more on his great strength than formal combat skill.

==Other versions==
===Exiles===
{{Main|Heather Hudson (Exiles)}}

A white-haired entity who seemed to be Walter Langowski joins the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]], an interdimensional team of heroes dedicated to fixing breaks in the timeline. It is soon revealed that she is a black woman named Heather Hudson, shocking the team who are familiar with versions of Walter.

===Howling Commandos===
In ''[[Nick Fury's Howling Commandos]]'', a series published in late 2005 and early 2006, a new intelligent Sasquatch appeared. What, if any, connection this character has to Walter Langkowski or the Sasquatch from ''Alpha Flight'' volume 2, was never revealed.

===Marvel Zombies===
In the [[Marvel Zombies]] comics set in the universe of Earth-2149 the zombified [[Alpha Flight#Marvel Zombies|Alpha Flight]] attack the [[X-Men#Alternate versions|X-Men]] and are eventually killed by [[Alternate versions of Magneto#Marvel Zombies|Magneto]]. Sasquatch is seen in a panel of Marvel Zombies Dead Days attacking the X-Man [[Alternate versions of Wolverine#Marvel Zombies|Wolverine]].  He is killed alongside the rest of zombie Alpha Flight by Magneto in the next panel.

===Ultimate Sasquatch===
An Ultimate version of Sasquatch was referenced as killed off-panel 
during the [[Ultimate X-Men]] arc "Shock and Awe." Sasquatch makes an official appearance in the first part of the ''Ultimate X-Men'''s "Absolute Power" arc, as a member of [[Alpha Flight#Ultimate Alpha Flight|Alpha Flight]]. Sasquatch, more savage than its 616 counterpart, appears to know Rogue and experienced her powers first hand, though Rogue does not recognize the character. The character is later revealed to be [[Wolfsbane (comics)#Ultimate Wolfsbane|Rahne Sinclair]], under the influence to the power enhancing drug [[Banshee (comics)#Ultimate Banshee|Banshee]], after reverting to her "powered down" form.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #95</ref> Sasquatch is injured by [[Nightcrawler (comics)#Ultimate Nightcrawler|Nightcrawler]], who while trying to teleport her away, accidentally, teleports part of her arm off.

===Unintelligible monster===
Another Sasquatch, this one a barely intelligent monster, appeared in ''Alpha Flight'' volume 2. Although his teammates believed this Sasquatch to be a highly degenerated Langkowski, it was an actual [[Bigfoot|sasquatch]] that had been captured by Department H. He was kept in control by the touch of the superpowered [[Murmur (Marvel Comics)#Murmur (Arlette Truffaut)|Murmur]], though this was not always successful. This Sasquatch died in the final conflict with Department H's corrupt leadership and the [[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac]]. Langkowski soon returned to active membership in Alpha Flight.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Sasquatch (along with other members of Alpha Flight) appeared in the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' episode "Repo Man" voiced by [[Harvey Atkin]].

[[Image:Hulk Ep 6.jpg|thumb|right|Sasquatch and Hulk in [[The Incredible Hulk (1996 TV series)|''The Incredible Hulk'' (1996 TV series)]]]]
* Sasquatch appeared in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1996 TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' episode "Man to Man, Beast to Beast" voiced by [[Peter Strauss]] (Walter Langkowski) and [[Clancy Brown]] (Sasquatch). In that episode, Bruce Banner comes to [[Canada]] hoping to find his old friend, Dr. Walter Langkowski (Sasquatch) to get a cure for himself and get rid of Hulk forever, only to find that Walter has developed a bestial alter ego while using himself as a test subject to make a breakthrough in gamma radiation. After battling the Hulk, Walter/Sasquatch exiles himself to the wilderness when his actions put Hulk's friend, a small boy, in danger.

===Video games===
An evil doppelganger of Sasquatch appears in the video game ''[[Marvel Super Heroes: War of the Gems]]'' for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] (SNES).

==In popular culture==
He was mentioned on the hit Canadian television show, ''[[Corner Gas]]''. It was brought up in a fight between [[Spider-Man]] and Sasquatch, and Brent questioned whether it was a fight "between Spider-Man with the mythological Sasquatch, or the fictional Sasquatch from [[Alpha Flight]]" citing, "if it's the latter, the answer would be changed".
