In the [[Marvel]] comics universe, '''Random''' is a fictional, one-time supervillian and superhero.  He was "created" by the [[Dark Beast]].  Random worked as a bounty hunter and helped [[X-Factor]] defeat several villians, although he has also fought X-factor several times.

== Mutant Powers ==
Random can change his physical form since his body is made of morphing protoplasm.  This grants him the ability to counteract any force or mutant ability directed at him, alter his mass and strength, and fire biomatter projectiles.
