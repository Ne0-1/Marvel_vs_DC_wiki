'''Random (Marshall Evan Stone III)''' is a [[fictional character]] and [[anti-hero]] created by writer [[Peter David]] for the [[Marvel Comics]] series [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]. He made only a few appearances, but was able to be a thorn in the side of X-Factor and a sometimes--if reluctant--ally. The mystery of his life had little chance to be revealed before his life was cut short.

==Fictional character biography==
The mysterious man known as Random began his life in the hands of a madman. Somehow the [[Dark Beast]] had "created" him from a mass of protoplasm—making Random the result of an experiment the Dark Beast had began during the [[Age of Apocalypse]], as [[Mister Sinister|Sinister's]] lead scientist. The newly created young man was given the name of Alex, and he used this name as McCoy's helper down in the sewers beneath [[New York City]]. One day he escaped and, shifting his appearance to that of a muscle-bound man, took on the identity of Random. 

The man known as Random found himself in the employ of the less-desired of society, taking on the title of a [[bounty hunter]]. With his powers, he was an unpredictable wildcard—a random variable that could not be calculated. In his first encounter with [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] he is called in (presumably by the government) to bring back a group of [[Genosha|Genoshan]] renagades called the '''X-Patriots''' who are adamantly staying a hospital where one of their comrades is being treated. He and X-Factor clash and, wanting to end the fight quickly, [[Havok]] buys out Random's contract.

Because of his success in the business, he was contracted to go after the mutant [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]], then a member of the government sponsored team X-Factor. During their battle, Random tells her that the government who hires her hired him to kill her. Although she didn't believe it he assures her that there are mutant haters even inside of the government. After a brief scuffle, Polaris leaves and later confesses to Havok that she felt Random was holding back during the fight—almost wanting her to win. 

Later, when X-Factor is encountering the religious fanatic [[Haven (comics)|Haven]], Random appears to [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]] and [[Strong Guy]], confessing to them that the people who previously hired him are after his life as well. In exchange for protection, he agrees to tell X-Factor who hired him to kill Polaris. They take him along to their base and [[Forge (comics)|Forge]] tries to hire his services against Haven. For a new car—the old one destroyed by Polaris—and $15,000 he agrees and tags along. Once there, Haven transports all the members of X-Factor and Random to a [[pocket dimension]] where she shows them how much they really need her. In this world, Random begins to revert to his protoplasmic state and Haven points out that she knows the truth behind his blood-thirsty façade. When she returns the team to the real world, Random is completely [[gelatin|gelatinous]], but quickly pulls himself together and refuses to talk to the team about it. 

After Haven is defeated, Forge pays Random and offers him a permanent job on the team, which he declines. Shortly thereafter he, along with Forge and Polaris, go to track down the man who hired him to kill Polaris. His name is Colonel Malone, and the trio find him, but he commits [[suicide]] before they get to question him. As luck would have it, Malone's assistant is there and informs them that the government never planned on killing Polaris; they only wanted to test her limits. They wanted to use her as a [[failsafe]] against [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] and if Random defeated her then she was to be brought in and [[brainwash|brainwashed]] to become their weapon.

Later, he showed up again when Havok had reformed the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] with the Dark Beast, [[Fatale (comics)|Fatale]], and [[Aurora (comics)|Aurora]] among others. He and Havok clashed—as usual—until Havok revealed to him the true nature of his mission. He was not attempting to lead the organization but undermine it from within. Realizing this, the duo helped to liberate some of McCoy's inhumane experiments.

Most recently, Random was captured by the refurbished [[Weapon X|Weapon X Program]] in their attempt to exterminate mutants. He was placed in '''Neverland'''—a mutant [[concentration camp]]—and attempted a coup with the help of [[Diamond Lil]]. However, the inmates didn't realize that their powers were being negated by [[Leech (comics)|Leech]] and were severely punished for their acts. Since then, Diamond Lil has resurfaced, but it is unknown if Random survived the experience. 

If he did, his status after [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]]—in which 90% of the world's mutant population was depowered by the [[Scarlet Witch]]—remains to be seen. Although he has been listed among [[X-Men: The 198|the 198]], this is not a guarantee of his survival, as the government files used are quite antiquated.

== Other media ==

Random made a number of cameo appereances in the ''[[X-Men Animated Series]]''.

==Powers==
Random can change his physical form since his body is made of morphing [[protoplasm]].  This grants him the ability to counteract any force or mutant ability directed at him, alter his mass and strength, and fire biomatter projectiles.

==Notes==
Since Random was determined to be "created" it is unlikely that Marshall Evan Stone III is his true name. One possibility is that he was actually born, then captured and re-created into his current state by the Dark Beast. However, since that is neither confirmed nor denied, it is to be assumed that the name he uses is a moniker he adopted for his new identity as Random.
