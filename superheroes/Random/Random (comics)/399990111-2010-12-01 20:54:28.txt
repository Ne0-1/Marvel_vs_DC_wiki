'''Random''' ('''Marshall Evan Stone III''') is a [[fiction]]al [[character (arts)|character]] and [[antihero]] created by writer [[Peter David]] for the [[Marvel Comics]] series [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]. He started out as a thorn in the side of X-Factor, but he later became a reluctant ally of theirs. The mystery of his life has yet to be completely revealed.

==Fictional character biography==
Random's complete origin is unclear. It appears that he was created from a mass of protoplasm by [[Dark Beast]] Hank McCoy, making Random the continuation of an experiment McCoy began while [[Mister Sinister|Sinister's]] lead scientist in the [[Age of Apocalypse]] reality. It is also possible that Random was born normally and then captured and experimented on by Dark Beast. Whatever the case, following Dark Beast's experimentation, the young Random was given the name of Alex, and he used this name when he served as McCoy's helper in the sewers beneath [[New York City]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

"Alex" eventually escaped, shifting his appearance to that of a muscle-bound man and creating the identity of [[bounty hunter]] Random. It is unknown if the name Marshall Evan Stone III is his real name or just a name he created for his new Random persona. According to the memories of Charlie Ronalds, a person with Random's powers killed Charlie's parents when Charlie was very young, though Random has never been confirmed as the killer.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Random's powers made him an unpredictable wildcard, a random variable in battle. In his first encounter with the government-sponsored [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] team, he was called in (presumably by the government) to bring back a group of [[Genosha]]n renagades called the X-Patriots who refused to leave a hospital where one of their comrades was being treated. He and X-Factor clashed and, wanting to end the fight quickly, team leader [[Havok (comics)|Havok]] bought out Random's contract.<ref>''X-Factor,'' vol. 1 #88 (Mar. 1993)</ref>

Because of his success as a bounty hunter, Random was contracted to go after X-Factor member [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]]. During their battle, Random told her that the same government that employed her hired him to kill her. Polaris didn't believe him, but he assured her that there were mutant haters in the government. After a brief scuffle, Polaris left, later confessing to Havok that she felt Random was holding back during the fight, as if he wanted her to win.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

===Joining X-Factor===

After X-Factor encountered the religious fanatic [[Haven (comics)|Haven]], Random visited X-Factor members [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]] and [[Strong Guy]], confessing to them that the government agents who had previously hired him were now after his life as well. In exchange for protection, he agreed to tell X-Factor who hired him to kill Polaris. The team next set out to find Haven, and [[Forge (comics)|Forge]] hired Random's services against Haven for $15,000 and a new car, so he tags along. When they located Haven, she transported Random and the rest of X-Factor to a [[pocket universe|pocket dimension]] where she showed them how much they really need her. In this world, Random began to revert to his protoplasmic state, causing Haven to point out that she knew the truth behind his bloodthirsty façade. When she returned the team to the real world, Random was completely [[gelatin]]ous but quickly pulled himself together and refused to talk to the team about it.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Following Haven's defeat, Forge paid Random and offered him a permanent job on the team, which he declined. Shortly thereafter, Random, Forge, and Polaris tracked down Colonel Malone, the man who hired Random to kill Polaris. The trio found him, but he committed [[suicide]] before they could question him. However, Malone's assistant informed them that the government never planned on killing Polaris—they only wanted to test her limits as part of their plan to use her as a [[fail-safe]] against [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. If Random had defeated her, she was to be brought in and [[brainwashing|brainwash]]ed to become the government's weapon.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

===The Brotherhood===

Random returned after Havok re-formed the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]] with Dark Beast, [[Fatale (comics)|Fatale]], and [[Aurora (comics)|Aurora]], among others. He and Havok clashed until Havok revealed to him the true nature of his mission: He was attempting to undermine the Brotherhood from within. The duo then helped to liberate the subjects of some of McCoy's inhumane experiments.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Random was next hired by [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]] (along with [[Feral (comics)|Feral]], [[Pyro (comics)|Pyro]], [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]], the [[Fenris (comics)|Fenris twins]], and [[Omega Red]]) to assist the [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]]. Exodus promised to help his new operatives find a cure for the [[Legacy Virus]] if they captured the [[New Men (Marvel Comics)|Knights of Wundagore]], but when they failed, Exodus left them stranded in the [[Savage Land]].<ref>''Quicksilver'' #8–9 (June–July 1998)</ref>

Random resurfaced on [[Genosha]] during [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]'s rule and was quickly dispatched when the ad-hoc Genoshan Assault X-Men squad attacked the island to rescue [[Professor X]].<ref>''X-Men,'' vol. 2 #112 (May 2001)</ref>

===Weapon X===

Random was later captured by the refurbished [[Weapon X|Weapon X Program]] in their attempt to exterminate mutants. He was placed in Neverland, a mutant [[internment|concentration camp]], and attempted a coup with the help of [[Diamond Lil (comics)|Diamond Lil]]. However, the inmates didn't realize that their powers were being negated by [[Leech (comics)|Leech]], and they were both severely punished for their actions.<ref>''Weapon X,'' vol. 2 #5 (Mar. 2003)</ref>

===Post M-Day===
Random was one of the few mutants that retained their superhuman powers after [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].<ref>''X-Men: The 198 Files'' (Jan. 2006)</ref> Alongside [[Tempo (comics)|Tempo]], [[Unuscione]], and [[Joanna Cargill|Frenzy]], Random again worked with Exodus, joining his new team of Acolytes and participating in an attack on the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] [[Helicarrier]].<ref>''X-Men Annual,'' vol. 3 #1 (Mar. 2007)</ref>

Random and the Acolytes later attacked the Xavier Institute on a mission from [[Mister Sinister]] to retrieve [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny's]] Diaries. However, the diaries they found were fake, and after a battle with [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], [[Kitty Pryde|Shadowcat]], and several students, the Acolytes were forced to return to Sinister without completing their mission.<ref>''X-Men,'' vol. 2 #202 (Oct. 2007)</ref> Random was present with the rest of the Acolytes in the final battle of "[[X-Men: Messiah Complex|Messiah Complex]]."<ref>''X-Men,'' vol. 2 #207 (Mar. 2008)</ref> 

===X-Men: Legacy===
When Professor Xavier returns to New Avalon to confront Exodus, Random was still among the Acolytes. Xavier convinced Exodus to disband the group and find a new way to help mutantkind, and Random, [[Amelia Voght]], and [[Karima Shapandar|Omega Sentinel]] decided to relocate to San Francisco in response to the X-Men's call for all mutants to relocate there.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #225 (Aug. 2009)</ref>

Random was next seen on [[Asteroid M|Utopia]] during [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]]'s attack on the island. Random, along with [[Scalphunter (Marvel Comics)|Scalphunter]], [[Sack (comics)|Sack]], [[Litterbug (comics)|Litterbug]], and others, was rallied to the Utopia's defense by [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], who declared, "Today you are all combatants. You are all X-Men."<ref>''New Mutants,'' vol. 3 #14 (2010)</ref>

Following the battle, Random attended [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]'s funeral.<ref>''X-Men: Second Coming'' #2 (2010)</ref> When Cyclops put together a squad of Utopia inhabitants led by [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] and [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] to help with reconstruction efforts in San Francisco. Random was included in this group, along with Colossus, [[Psylocke]], Omega Sentinel, [[Danger Room|Danger]], [[Hellion]], and [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope]].<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #242 (Jan. 2011)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Random's body is made of morphing [[protoplasm]] which can change into almost any shape he can imagine. He is able to counteract any force or mutant ability directed at him, alter his mass and strength, and fire biomatter projectiles.

==In other media==
===Television===
*Random made non-speaking cameo appearances in ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men: The Animated Series]].'' He is shown amongst the mutants that reside on [[Asteroid M]] in "Sanctuary" and is one of the many residents of the mutant-dominated community of Skull Mesa in "Secrets Not Long Buried."
