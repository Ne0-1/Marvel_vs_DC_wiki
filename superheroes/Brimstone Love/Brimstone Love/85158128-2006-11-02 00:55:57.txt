'''Brimstone Love''' is a character created by [[Marvel Comics]] for their [[Marvel 2099]] line-up. He is a little known [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] [[supervillain]] who antagonized the [[X-Men 2099| X-Men of 2099]]. 

==Fictional character biography==
In the alternate future of 2099, a [[sociopath]]ic mutant named Brimstone Love begins to explore alternate mediums of art. He creates the [[Theatre of Pain (comics)|Theatre of Pain]]—an organization devoted to turning pain and suffering into art. Some time before the story begins in ''X-Men 2099'' #1, Brimstone Love captures a young woman named [[La Lunatica]]—a mutant with the ability to trigger painful memories in others—and forces her into his employ so that he can record the traumatic events and resell them to his clientele. 

Following the formation of the X-Men by [[Cerebra]], Brimstone Love notices a spike in mutant activity and sends La Lunatica (later known as Luna for short) out to investigate. She captures [[Bloodhawk]] for him and he is so delighted by the exquisite images of pain from the man's mind that he sends Luna out to get more mutants. She comes upon [[Skullfire]], [[Krystalin]] and [[Meanstreak (comics)|Meanstreak]] and captures the trio to bring back to the Theatre of Pain. When Luna attempts to access Skullfire's memories of when he accidentally killed his girlfriend, he releases a huge burst of energy, freeing him and his friends—as well as Luna—from their bonds. 

Luna escapes from Brimstone Love and allies herself with the X-Men. However, Brimstone Love does not want to allow his best agent to go free, so he pursues her. Following Skullfire and [[Xi'an (comics)|Xi'an]] on a [[motorcycle]] ride to find the enigmatic '''Driver''', Luna barely outruns Brimstone Love.  He finally catches up to them when they stop for information on the Driver's location, but he decides not to make his presence known. Instead, he takes a facination to Xi'an, who recently began to digress into his more evil persona. Wanting to capture Xi'an for the Theatre's usage, Brimstone Love follows the trio—with the addition of [[Junkpile]]—to the Driver's hidden lair. There, he dismantles the Driver's mutant cataloging computer system, as well as Junkpile's body, and offers Xi'an a position in the Theatre of Pain. Shockingly, Xi'an accepts and the two leave together.

But before one can join the Theatre of Pain they must go through an [[initiation]] first. For Xi'an it is to face three people from his past, which he passes by the Theatre's standards. Then he is buried alive. While inside of the [[coffin]], he refuses help from the good side of his persona, effectively entering him into the ranks of the Theatre.

Xi'an's friends in the X-Men, along with Junkpile and his [[SHIELD]] agents, infiltrate the Theatre and attempt to free him from Brimstone Love's clutches. Everyone is re-captured but Luna breaks free and liberates the other X-Men. They begin to attack Brimstone Love and, unexpectedly, so does Xi'an who wants control of the Theatre all to himself. In a weakened state, Brimstone Love teleports away and is never heard from again.

==Powers==
Brimstone Love—aside from his [[demonic]] [[physiology]]—is gifted with superhuman strength, durability, and resistance to injury as well as the ability to summon [[magma]], generate blinding flashes of light and intense heat and flame. He can also generate [[hologram|holographic]] projections, but it is unknown if this is due to technology or another facet of his mutant powers.
