'''Slash''' (also known as '''Sister Agony''') is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics Universe]], most notably as a member of the [[Sisters of Sin]].

==Fictional character biography==
A member of the Sisters of Sin, Slash was a young disciple of the [[Red Skull]].  Her physical age was accelerated into an old woman, calling herself Sister Agony because of the razor-sharp talons she had in place of her hands.  She and her Sisters attacked [[Captain America]] but were defeated, and eventually restored to her natural age.  However, soon after, she returned alongside the Sisters of Sin, this time as a young adult.  She and her sisters were once again defeated by Captain America.

Most recently, she was seen at a bar with the [[Answer (comics)|Answer]], playing strip games with her sisters.

==Powers and abilities==
Slash wields razor-sharp metal claws and is well-trained in battle.  However, because her mental age is that of a child, she is often easily defeated.
