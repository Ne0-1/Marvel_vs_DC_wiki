Her physical age was accelerated into an old woman, calling herself Sister Agony because of the razor-sharp talons she had in place of her hands.  She and her Sisters attacked [[Captain America]] but were defeated.{{issue|date=December 2012}} She was eventually restored to her natural age.  However, soon after, she returned alongside the Sisters of Sin, this time as a young adult.  She and her sisters were once again defeated by Captain America.{{issue|date=December 2012}}
