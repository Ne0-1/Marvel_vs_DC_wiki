===Fictional character biography===
Gorgon first appeared as a member of the Inhumans when he attempted to retrieve his cousin and queen, [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]] from the outside world and take her back to Attilan. This led him into conflict with the Fantastic Four, the first humans he met, who were harboring Medusa after rescuing her from the villainous [[Frightful Four]]. Accordingly, Gorgon is indirectly responsible for revealing the existence of Attilan to the outside world.<ref> Fantastic Four #44 </ref>
	
The son of archivist Milena and architect Korath (brother of the previous king Agon), Gorgon is a cousin of king [[Black Bolt]] and a member of the royal family. As such, he was given the honor of becoming Black Bolt's personal bodyguard. He has also been shown to be the leader of the Attilan's armed forces and responsible for training youths recently exposed to the [[Terrigen Mists]] in the use of their newly acquired powers and abilities. As is custom among the Inhumans, Gorgon was exposed to the Terrigen Mists as a teenager, gaining increased strength, while his feet were transformed to [[hoof|hooves]], capable of generating highly destructive seismic waves.<ref> The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe (1983): #4 page 25</ref>
	
In his role of bodyguard, he is fiercely loyal to his cousin Black Bolt. On the occasions Black Bolt's deranged brother [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus the Mad]] seized power in Attilan, Gorgon has usually vowed to take Maximus down (in the eventual outcome usually asking for Black Bolt to order Maximus' execution) and return Black Bolt to his rightful place as ruler of Attilan. He also opposed the Attilan Genetics Council when they forbade Black Bolt and Medusa from conceiving a child. When Medusa did conceive, Gorgon was one of the few Inhumans who fled to earth to help guard her during her pregnancy. Fortunately the help of Crystal helped clear their hideout of the pollution which would have affected them. Gorgon caused conflict even there, as he attempted to seduce Medusa's foxlike handmaiden but, as always, he was loyal to the other Inhumans when need be. <ref>Inhumans Graphic Novel</ref> Years later, he would team up with Karnak on a mission to find Medusa's son who had gotten lost in North America. He would be helped by [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], Number Nine and the human Brandy Ash. The entire group ended up facing down the villainous supernatural threat [[Blackheart]]. Brandy did not survive.<ref> Daredevil #279-283 </ref>

The person Gorgon mostly relates to is his cousin [[Karnak (comics)|Karnak]]. While Gorgon is brash and loud, Karnak is quiet and reserved. Gorgon prefers to solve his problems with his fists, knocking everything in his path, while Karnak, a thinker, strikes only once, but decisively. Both of them expect the other to see the light one day, Gorgon hoping to convert Karnak to the joys of life, while the latter expects his friend to learn more responsibility. Their differences have brought them to blows on occasion.

The same has happened with [[Thing (comics)|Ben Grimm]], the member of the Fantastic Four whom Gorgon he feels closest to. As the strongmen of their respective families, Gorgon and Ben have a friendly rivalry, which has sometimes devolved to physical confrontations. However, they remain good friends. Gorgon also respects [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]], who helped save Attilan countless times, and discovered a way to move the hidden city to the Earth's Moon.

Currently, Gorgon continues to serve Black Bolt and the Inhuman royal family, but is at odds with Black Bolt on the question of using Alpha Primitives as slaves.<ref> Black Panther #20</ref>

Captured during the most recent war between America and Attilan, he was subjected to a secondary terrigenesis. Exposed again to the mist, he became a hirsute brute more powerful than before, but driven by uncontrollable rage bouts.<ref> Silent War #1-5</ref>

===Powers and abilities===
Gorgon's legs have the appearance of a bull's legs. By stamping his hooves, Gorgon can create a concentric or directed shockwave with a strength equivalent to that of a powerful earthquake. With the help of Karnak, Gorgon's blows can be directed for specialized tasks, such as separating sections of land. Gorgon also possesses superhuman strength and resistance to injury.<ref> The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe (1983) #4 page 25</ref>

Gorgon has been mutated by a second exposure to the mists. Besides increased strength, his current abilities are unknown.

===Other versions===


====Earth X====
Like many of his fellow Inhumans, Gorgon of [[Earth X]] has undergone a further mutation. He now looks more like a bull then before, with long, curved horns and an enlarged snout. He assists the royal family in investigating the various mutative occurrences on Earth.

====Ultimate Gorgon====
The character of Ultimate Gorgon of the Inhumans was introduced in ''[[Ultimate Fantastic Four]]'' Annual #1. The familial relationships remain unchanged, with several differences: Ultimate Gorgon is a woman, her sisters are Medusa and Crystal. The royal family here is described as 'the purest bloodline in creation'. Ultimate Gorgon remains the powerhouse of the family, with the added ability to hypnotise people, in effect turning them to stone. She is a physical match for Ultimate Ben Grimm, but haughty, referring to him as 'the grotesque'.

===In other media===
*Gorgon appears in the 1994 [[Fantastic Four (1994 TV series)|Fantastic Four]] TV series voiced by [[Michael Dorn]]. He was sent to retrieve Medusa and bring her back to the Great Refuge

*Gorgon, along with the other Inhumans, appears as a non-playable hero in the video game [[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]. When Medusa ends up corrupted by [[Doctor Doom]], he tells the heroes that he, [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]], and [[Triton (comics)|Triton]] are going to Earth to fight Doctor Doom while the heroes head to the Skrull Homeworld.

===Fictional character biography===
'''The Gorgon''' is the name of a [[comic book]] character associated with the [[X-Men]] member [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]. He first appeared in ''Wolverine'' (vol.3) #20, and was created by [[Mark Millar]] and [[John Romita, Jr.]] The character was killed in ''Wolverine'' (vol.3) #31. He is unrelated to the Marvel character [[Gorgon (comics)|Gorgon]] of [[The Inhumans]].

The Gorgon's real name is Tomi Shishido. He is a member of the [[Hand (comics)|Hand]] and [[HYDRA]] and a powerful [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]], leading the extremist mutant society Dawn of the White Light. As a child, possesses near superhuman levels of intelligence. He says his first words at two weeks of age, can walk at three months, and is able to read and write by his first birthday. He becomes an accomplished painter by age four, among the top artists in all of [[Japan]], and composes an [[opera]] at age six. This is also the age when he first attempts [[suicide]]. 

At age 13, he creates a [[Theory of everything (philosophy)|mathematical formula that proves, without question, the existence of God]] and manifests the mutant ability to turn people to stone just by looking at them. The media dubs him “The Gorgon”, after the [[Greek mythology|mythological]] [[Gorgon|character]]. Shortly after, he becomes the leader a mutant death-cult called the Dawn of the White Light, which commit terrorist attacks throughout [[Japan]]. By age 18, he seeks out the [[Hand (comics)|Hand]]. Before leaving his home he kills his entire family and his only friend to prove that he is ruthless enough to join the terrorist organization.

After finding the Hand sanctuary and slaying all of its guards blindfolded, the Gorgon goes inside and pledged his allegiance to the Hand's Jonin. When the master questions his dedication, the Gorgon impales himself with his own sword, fatally injuring himself, and tells the master to resurrect him. The Jonin are impressed and bring him into the fold. 

Later the Gorgon becomes connected to [[HYDRA (comics)|HYDRA]] and forms a relationship with Elsbeth Von Strucker, the wife of HYDRA leader [[Baron Strucker]]. He is responsible for the capture and brain washing of [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]. Although Wolverine is eventually freed from their control, Wolverine manages to infiltrate the [[Baxter Building]] and steal technological blue prints from [[Reed Richards]] that are very useful to HYDRA. Wolverine, under the brain washing, commits a number of terrorist attacks resulting in the deaths of numerous costumed heroes and hundreds of [[S.H.I.E.L.D]] agents.

Eventually, the Gorgon attempts to assassinate [[Nick Fury]] after S.H.I.E.L.D. launches an attack which destroys his safehouse and kills Elsbeth Von Strucker in the process. He is intercepted by Wolverine before he can complete the objective. The two engage in a brutal battle, inflicting devastating injuries upon one another. The Gorgon manages to gain the upper hand and attempts to use his mutant ability to transform Wolverine into stone, Wolverine extracts his claws at the last moment, allowing the Gorgon to see his own reflection in the claws. As a result, the Gorgon's power is reflected back upon him. Once the Gorgon has been turned into stone, Wolverine shatters his body. <ref>''Wolverine'' vol.3 #20-31</ref>

===Powers and abilities===
The Gorgon possesses a variety of superhuman abilities as a result of genetic mutation and mystical enhancement from the Hand and HYDRA.

The Gorgon's primary mutant ability is the ability to transform an individual to stone by making eye contact with them. The Gorgons eyes have no visible pupils and glow with a bright green energy. The Gorgon always wears a pair of dark [[sunglasses]] in order to see without affecting those around him. Whether the sunglasses possess any sort of special properties or are composed of some special material designed to block his power has not been revealed.

After his resurrection, the Gorgon's strength, speed, stamina, agility, and reflexes are all heightened to superhuman levels of efficiency, the exact limits of which are unrevealed. The Gorgon also possesses an accelerated [[healing factor]] that enables him to repair damaged or destroyed tissue with extraordinary speed and efficiency. He is capable of healing from massive trauma inflicted by Wolverine's [[Adamantium (comics)|adamantium]] claws, bludgeoning, and falling from great heights while continuing to fight. 

Aside from his physical advantages, the Gorgon possesses some level of telepathy allowing him to read the minds of others. Much like his physical capabilities, the exact limits of the Gorgon's psionic powers remain unknown.

The Gorgon is an extraordinary hand to hand combatant, even before his resurrection, trained in multiple forms of martial arts. He is an expert swordsman and typically prefers to use a [[katana]] during combat. Also, he typically uses his telepathic abilities to read the minds of his opponents during combat situations (even highly trained minds like Wolverine and Elektra], enabling him to predict and counter their every move.

The Gorgon is extraordinarily intelligent and possesses advanced knowledge in multiple scientific and artistic fields.
