'''Gorgon''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Gorgon is also a member of the Royal Family of the [[Inhumans]], a race of superpowered beings that inhabit the hidden city of [[Attilan]]. The character debuted in [[Fantastic Four]] #44 (Nov. 1966) and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].  

==Fictional character biography==
The son of archivist Milena and architect Korath (brother of the previous king [[Agon (comics)|Agon]]), Gorgon is a cousin of king [[Black Bolt]] and a member of the royal family of the [[Inhumans]]. As is custom among the Inhumans, Gorgon was exposed to the [[Terrigen Mists]] as a teenager, gaining increased strength, while his feet were transformed to [[hoof|hooves]], capable of generating highly destructive seismic waves. As an adult, Gorgon became Black Bolt's personal bodyguard and is responsible for training youths recently exposed to the [[Terrigen Mists]] in the use of their newly acquired powers and abilities. 

Gorgon first leaves the Inhuman city of [[Attilan]] to rescue [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]] (suffering from [[amnesia]] at the time), who became lost in the outside world. This leads to a battle with the [[Fantastic Four]], who rescued Medusa from the supervillain team the [[Frightful Four]]. <ref>''Fantastic Four'' #44 (Nov. 1965)</ref> After making contact with the outside world, Gorgon and the rest of the Royal Family have several encounters with the Fantastic Four over the years, seeking their aid against foes such as Black Bolt's brother [[Maximus]], <ref>''Fantastic Four'' #45 - 47 (Dec. - Feb. 1965 - 1966); #82 - 83 (Jan. - Feb. 1969) </ref> [[Psycho-Man]] <ref>''Fantastic Four'' King-Size Special #5 (Nov. 1967)</ref> and the [[Sphinx (comics)|Sphinx]]. <ref>''Fantastic Four'' Annual #12 (1977)</ref>

With several other Inhumans Gorgon also battles the master villain [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]], <ref>''Amazing Adventures'' #3 - 4 (Dec. 1970 and Feb. 1971)</ref> helps free Maximus, <ref>''Amazing Adventures'' #5 (Apr. 1971)</ref> journeys to America to search for the missing Black Bolt <ref>''Amazing Adventures'' #7 (Aug. 1971)</ref> and battles [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. <ref>''Amazing Adventures'' #9 - 10 (Dec. 1971 and Feb. 1972)</ref> Over the years, and with continued exposure to the outside world, Gorgon has many adventures, usually taking place in the company of fellow members of the Royal Family. <ref>''Inhumans'' #1-12 (Oct. 1975 - Aug. 1977); ''Inhumans'' vol. 2, #1-12 (1998 - 1999); ''Inhumans'' vol. 3, #1-4 (2000) and ''Inhumans'' vol. 4, #1-12 (2003-2004)</ref>

Significant moments for Gorgon include defying the Attilan Genetics Council and helping to hide the pregnant Medusa (with Black Bolt's child) on Earth; <ref>''The Inhumans'' Graphic Novel (1988)</ref> arguing with Black Bolt over the use of [[Alpha Primitives]] as slaves <ref> ''Black Panther'' #20 (2005)</ref> and being captured during the war between America and Attilan, when he is subjected to the Terrigen Mists again (which amplify Gorgon's powers and change him into a true beast with uncontrollable rages). <ref>''Silent War'' #1 - 6 (2006 - 2007)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Gorgon's superhuman powers are a result of exposure to the mutagenic [[Terrigen Mist]]. Gorgon now has bull's legs and hooves and can create intense shockwaves equivalent to a powerful earthquake. He also possesses enhanced strength and durability, although like all Inhumans has a weaker immune system than that of an average human.

Gorgon was exposed to Terrigen Mists a second time by Pentagon officials.  He is now appears larger and stronger and behaves more brutishly.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

===Marvel Zombies===
The entire Inhuman Royal Family has been zombified and has traveled to Kingpin's domain to eat of his human clones. [[Machine Man]] attacks and Gorgon tries to retaliate by stamping the ground. His leg instantly falls off. <ref>"Marvel Zombies 3" #3</ref>
