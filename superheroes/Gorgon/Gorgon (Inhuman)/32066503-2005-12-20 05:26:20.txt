: ''This article is about the member of the Inhumans Royal Family. For the villain of the same name see [[Gorgon (Wolverine villain)]]''

'''Gorgon''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[Marvel Universe]]. He is a member of the Royal Family of the [[Inhumans]], a race of superpowered beings that inhabit the hidden city of [[Attilan]], in the heart of the [[Himalayas]]. Gorgon debuted in [[Fantastic Four]] #44 (1966) and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].
	
Gorgon first appeared as a member of the Inhumans when he attempted to retrieve his cousin and queen, [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]] from the outside world and take her back to Attilan. This led him into conflict with the Fantastic Four, the first humans he met, who were harboring Medusa after rescuing her from the villainous [[Frightful Four]]. As such, Gorgon is indirectly responsible for revealing the existence of Attilan to the outside world.
	
The son of archivist Melinda and architect Korath (brother of the previous king Agon), Gorgon is a cousin of king [[Black Bolt]] and member of the royal family. As such, he was given the honor of becoming Black Bolt's personal bodyguard. He has also been shown to be the leader of the Attilan's armed forces and responsible for training youths recently exposed to the [[Terrigen Mists]] in the use of their newly acquired powers and abilities. As his custom, among the Inhumans, Gorgon was exposed to the Terrigen Mists as a teenager, gaining increased strength, while his feet were transformed to [[hoof|hooves]], capable of generating highly destructive seismic waves.
	
In his role of bodyguard, he is fiercely loyal to his cousin Black Bolt. On the occasions Black Bolt's deranged brother [[Maximus the Mad]] seized power in Attilan, Gorgon usually vows to take Maximus down (in the eventual outcome usually asking for Black Bolt to order Maximus' execution) and return Black Bolt to his rightful place as ruler of Attilan. He has also opposed the Attilan Genetics Council when they forbade Black Bolt and Medusa from conceiving a child.
	
The person Gorgon mostly relates to is his cousin [[Karnak (comics)|Karnak]]. While Gorgon is brash and loud, Karnak is quiet and reserved. Gorgon prefers to solve his problems with his fists, knocking everything in his path, while Karnak, a thinker, strikes only once, but decisively. Both of them expect the other to see the light one day, Gorgon hoping to convert Karnak to the joys of life, while the latter expects his friend to learn more responsibility. Their differences have brought them to blows on occasion.
	
The same has happened with [[Thing (comics)|Ben Grimm]], the member of the Fantastic Four he feels closer to. As the strongmen of their respective families, Gorgon and Ben have a friendly rivalry, which has devolved to physical confrontations. However, they remain good friends. Gorgon also respects [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]], who helped save Attilan countless times, and discovered a way to move the hidden city to the Earth's Moon.
	
Currently, Gorgon continues to serve Black Bolt and the Inhuman royal family, in spite of the fact the Inhumans chose to abandon Attilan and no longer consider Black Bolt their ruler. He was last seen in [[Latveria]], the only country that allowed the royal family to establish themselves in exile.
