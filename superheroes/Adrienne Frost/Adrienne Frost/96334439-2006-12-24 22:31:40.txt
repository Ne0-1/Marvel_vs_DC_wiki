'''Adrienne Frost''' is a [[fictional character]] of the [[Marvel Universe]], the older sister of [[Emma Frost]] and Cordelia Frost. Not much is known about her. She first appeared in ''[[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]]'' #48 (February, [[1999]]). The issue was scripted by [[Jay Faerber]] and drawn by [[Terry Dodson]]. 

==Fictional character biography==
Adrienne was a [[Mutant (fictional)|mutant]] and the sister of Cordelia and Emma Frost, then headmistress of Generation X. Like her sisters, Adrienne had a psionically based power. The nature of this power was [[Psychometry]]: the ability to touch an object and instantly know the object's history in terms of events surrounding its past, present, and future owners. The insight gleaned from using this gift enabled Adrienne to gain a vast personal fortune. 

Emma first approached Adrienne to loan her some money after her Massachusetts Academy had fallen into debt. Initially turning Emma down because of their past stormy history, Adrienne accepted her offer after using her powers to learn that the academy was secretly the home for Generation X. She became co-headmaster, giving them new uniforms and assignments. However, her real intentions surfaced when, using a combination of her powers and the [[Danger Room]], she trapped Generation X in a simulation recreating Emma's earlier students [[Hellions (comics)|The Hellions']] demise at the hands of [[Trevor Fitzroy]], as seen in [[Uncanny X-Men]] #281. She had hoped to drive Emma insane by watching another group of her students die. While Emma and Generation X were able to escape this illusion, Adrienne, now calling herself the new [[White Queen]], escaped.  

Adrienne went to London where she successfully embezzled millions from the London branch of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]. She then began to plot her revenge on Emma by returning to the school demanding that she be reinstalled as headmistress or she would out the school as a mutant sanctuary. She later planted bombs at the school that would kill several students including [[Synch]]. 

In Generation X #75 (June, [[2001]]), Emma later confronted Adrienne and the two fought. When Adrienne made it clear that she intended to escalate the violence and endanger more of the students, Emma shot her in the heart. Although profit was not a motive for this act she inherited a considerable fortune from her older sister. Emma avoided prosecution by mindwiping police as they interrogated her.  It should be noted that Emma's telepathy had no effect on Adrienne, hence the former's use of a weapon.  The issue was scripted by [[Brian Wood]] and drawn by [[Ron Lim]].

As Adrienne herself was a mutant it was never fully clear what her motives were for bombing the school. One possibility might be that she was intending to frame another party in order to start some kind of human versus mutant war. Another would be that she hated Emma, and could not accept that she was second best in her father's eyes.

Her father Winston Frost, mother Hazel Frost and her brother Christian Frost have been recently introduced in her backstory.

==Powers and abilities==
Adrienne had the mutant psionic gift of [[Psychometry]]. This is the ability to touch an object and instantly know a history of many events concerning the object, such as all of its previous owners, events that took place around the object, and the possible future of the object and its future owners. Whilst not a combat-oriented mutation, it placed Adrienne in a position to gather otherwise private information which she turned towards investigation, extortion and espionage.

Adrienne also proved completely immune to her sister Emma's powerful telepathy.  Whether that was due to their similar genetic structure (being siblings) or an overall resistance to psychic assault on Adrienne's behalf, remains a mystery.
