'''Opal Luna Saturnyne''' is the name of a fictional [[comic book]] character created by [[Dave Thorpe]] and [[Alan Davis]] for their ''[[Captain Britain]]'' stories.  She is the Omniversal Majestrix of [[Otherworld (Marvel Comics)|Otherworld]], and a servant of [[Roma (comics)|Roma]], charged with the safety of the [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Omniverse]]. 

Her first appearance was in ''[[The Mighty World Of Marvel|Marvel Superheroes]]'', #381 during ''The Crooked World'' storyline. She later played a major part in [[Alan Moore]] and [[Alan Davis]]' ''[[Jaspers' Warp]]'' storyline.

==Fictional character biography==
Saturnyne originally hails from Earth 9, one in a myriad of [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternative universes]]. She was a highly intelligent and ambitious woman and ended up on [[Otherworld (Marvel Comics)|Otherworld]] as the Omniversal Majestrix, a function where she was part of the Dimensional Development Court, oversaw the [[Captain Britain Corps]] and was charged with the safekeeping and maintenance of order and reality of the entire Omniverse. Saturnyne only had to report to Merlyn, the Omniversal Guardian. Saturnyne felt no moral or ethical conflict in sacrificing anybody, even an entire universe, if it meant the preservation of the Omniverse.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Whenever she decided to take a more personal interest in a matter, she could call upon the Avant Guard, her personal elite. The Avant Guard appeared to be normal men, dressed in business suits and each carrying an umbrella, but these umbrellas were in fact highly advanced weapons, capable of various abilities like interdimensional travel, destructive blasts and rays capable of [[devolution (fallacy)|devolving]] opponents. She was assisted by Dimples, an overweight man who loved Saturnyne deeply. Saturnyne herself cared little for Dimples and saw him only as a useful servant.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Saturnyne first came into contact with Brian Braddock, also known as [[Captain Britain]], a warrior from [[Earth-616]]. They met on Earth 238, also known as the Crooked World. This Earth was deemed to be a threat to the Omniverse and Saturnyne convinced Captain Britain to help evolve the backwards planet, hoping to eliminate its threat. They were opposed by the Status Crew, a group charged with maintaining the status quo. Saturnyne and Captain Britain cooperated and managed to evolve the world, but were surprised to see a bigger threat take its place: an alternate reality [[Mad Jim Jaspers]] used his powers to create the [[Jaspers' Warp]], causing widespread insanity and the collapse of reality. Captain Britain and Saturnyne wanted to stop him, but were stopped by the [[Fury (Marvel Comics)|Fury]], a killer machine. Saturnyne fled with her Avant Guard, leaving a heartbroken Dimples, Captain Britain and his sidekick [[Jackdaw (comics)|Jackdaw]] behind. All three were killed by the Fury, shortly thereafter.<ref>recounted in ''Captain Britain'' Vol. 2 #1</ref>

The Dimensional Development Court was not pleased with what they perceived as Saturnyne's failure. She was arrested and replaced by a man called Mandragon, who destroyed the Earth 238 universe to prevent the Jaspers Warp from spreading. Merlyn had resurrected Captain Britain (but not Jackdaw) though and the Fury managed to survive and escape under his own power. Captain Britain and the interdimensional mercenaries known as the [[Technet (comics)|Special Executive]] would help Saturnyne escape from the Court to Earth-616. On Earth-616, [[Mad Jim Jaspers]], an even more powerful version than the one on Earth 238, came into power and threatened the world. Meanwhile the Fury also made its way to Earth-616 and came to battle with Jaspers. During the conflict, Merlyn died (though later he would reveal that he had just faked his death). In the end the Fury killed Jaspers and was killed shortly afterwards by Captain Britain and [[Captain UK]] from Earth 238 with help from Saturnyne and the [[Special Executive]]. Saturnyne managed to obtain cell samples of Jaspers though and threatened to unleash a clone on Mandragon's world if he didn't return her former position to her. Merlyn's daughter [[Roma (comics)|Roma]] succeeded her father, and Saturnyne became an agent of Roma.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Despite having cooperated with Captain Britain at various times, her duty would come first and foremost and she came into conflict with Captain Britain when she sent the bounty-hunters known as the [[Technet (comics)|Technet]] after [[Rachel Summers|Phoenix]]. The Technet failed to capture her and Phoenix joined Captain Britain, [[Shadowcat]], [[Meggan]] and [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] to form ''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]''.<ref>''Excalibur Special Edition'' #1</ref> Saturnyne later met Phoenix in person, but did not capture her.<ref>''Excalibur'' #24</ref> Saturnyne later appeared in a hologram, and rescinded her warrant against Phoenix but indefinitely extended the Technet's exile on Earth. She also delivered a message from Roma asking the other Captain Britains to free Excalibur's Captain Britain.<ref>''Excalibur'' #42, 44</ref> Later events would reveal that Saturnyne was acting under Roma's orders when she originally sent the Technet against Phoenix, and that the Technet was meant to fail, resulting in the formation of Excalibur.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Saturnyne would remain Roma's servant and Omniversal Majestrix for the following years until the villain [[Mastermind (computer)|Mastermind]] destroyed the Captain Britain Corps and imprisoned Roma. Captain Britain managed to defeat Mastermind and Roma named Captain Britain, now more powerful than ever before, the new ruler of Otherworld.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Saturnyne returned as Omniversal Majestrix, but had a bitter relationship with Brian, whom she deemed unworthy of his new position.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Saturnyne was also summoned by Roma when the being Abraxas tried to destroy creation. While Roma was killed, Saturnyne used her powers to protect Franklin Richards and Valeria.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Though it is unknown what powers she might have.

Saturnyne made appearances in a ''[[House of M]]'' tie-in story in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #462-465, which included many classic [[Marvel UK]] characters such as Saturnyne, Captain Britain, [[Roma (comics)|Roma]], [[Jamie Braddock]] and a resurrected [[Mad Jim Jaspers|James Jaspers]]. In the following Excalibur series, Captain Britain returned to Earth-616 and joined the group, apparently giving up his duties and powers as ruler of Otherworld.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

During the ''[[Spider-Verse]]'' storyline, Saturnyne and Lady Roma express their concerns about the Incursions that are destroying many dimensions as Spider-UK arrives to express his concern about all the spiders across the multiverse being hunted and killed. Saturnyne rebuffs him rude and coldly, but Roma sympathizes with him and gives him a talisman that allows him to travel through the web of life in order to save all the remaining spiders.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 3 #7</ref>

==Other versions==
Saturnyne has counterparts on many worlds. The most important among these are:
* [[Courtney Ross]]: A banker on [[Earth-616]]. She was the ex-girlfriend of [[Captain Britain]] and was killed by Sat-Yr-9.{{Issue|date=June 2010}}
* [[Sat-Yr-9]] (Opul Lun Sat-Yr-Nin): Despot of Earth 839, deposed by [[Captain UK]] and fled to Earth-616. She killed Courtney Ross and took her place as the current White Queen of the Hellfire Club.{{Issue|date=June 2010}}

==Notes==

* Saturnyne has tried to seduce Captain Britain at some points, while dismissing him completely at others. Brian in turn is physically attracted to the very beautiful Saturnyne (especially because she is also the spitting image of his first love, Courtney Ross), but is turned off by her occasional cruelty and coldness.
