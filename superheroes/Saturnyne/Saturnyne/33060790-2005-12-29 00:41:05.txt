'''Opal Luna Saturnyne''' is the name of a fictional [[comic book]] character created by [[Dave Thorpe]] and [[Alan Davis]] for their ''[[Captain Britain]]'' stories.
Her first appearance was in ''[[The Mighty World Of Marvel|Marvel Superheroes]]'', #381 during ''The Crooked World'' storyline. She later played a major part in [[Alan Moore]] and [[Alan Davis]]'s ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Britain#Crooked_World.2FJasper.27s_Warp Jasper's Warp]'' storyline.
She has had many alternate reality counterparts, one of which was Captain Britain's former college friend [[Courtney Ross]]; and another one strangely named Sat-Yr-9 (Sat-Yr-Nin), who later ended up on [[Earth 616]]. Once there, Sat-Yr-9 killed Courtney and assumed her identity, posing as her, since they were physically identical. Saturnyne also resumed a previous relationship that she had with Brian Braddock, interrupting his romance with his girlfriend Meggan. 

Saturnyne's mischievous [[Doppelg√§nger|doppelganger]] was eventually elected as White Queen of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] by Sebastian Shaw.

She later made appearances in [[Marvel Comics]] [[X Men]] spin off title, ''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' and, most recently, in a [[House of M]] tie-in story in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #462-465, which included many classic [[Marvel UK]] characters such as Saturnyne, Captain Britain, [[Roma (comics)|Roma]], [[Jamie Braddock]] and, most surprisingly, a resurrected [[Mad Jim Jaspers|James Jaspers]].
