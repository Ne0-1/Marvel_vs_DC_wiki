'''''Millie the Model''''' was [[Marvel Comics]]' longest-running [[humor]] title, first published by the company's 1940s predecessor, [[Timely Comics]], and continuing through its [[1950s]] forerunner,  [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], to [[1970s]] Marvel.

==Publication history==
The series ran 207 issues from Winter [[1945]] to Dec. [[1973]], an 18-year span that included one of the first Marvel Comics annuals (in [[1962]]), and spin-offs including ''A Date with Millie'', ''Life with Millie'', ''Mad About Millie'' and ''Modelling with Millie''. Initially a humorous career-gal book about [[New York City]] model Millie Collins, it very quickly evolved into a broader, more [[slapstick]]y comedy â€” for a time becoming a [[romantic fiction|romantic adventure]] series, with all the same characters (#113-153, March [[1963]] - Aug. [[1967]]) before returning to its humor roots.  Millie's boyfriend at the Hanover Agency was photographer Clicker (originally Flicker), her best friend was Toni Turner, and redheaded model Chili Storm her friendly nemesis. (Millie: "Sorry I'm late! I just got back from the beauty parlor!"  Chili: "Too bad they didn't have time to take you!")

The first issue was the work of [[Ruth Atkinson Ford]], one of the pioneering women [[cartoonists]] in comic books, with early issues then drawn mostly by Timely staffer [[Mike Sekowsky]]. Yet the character's essential look was the work of future [[Archie Comics]] great [[Dan DeCarlo]], who would later create [[Josie and the Pussycats]] and other Archie characters. DeCarlo's remarkable 10-year run from #18-93 (June [[1949]] - Nov. [[1959]]), was succeeded by the team of writer [[Stan Lee]], Marvel's editor-in-chief, and artist [[Stan Goldberg]], a.k.a. "Stan G.", the main Atlas/Marvel colorist at the time. Goldberg mimicked the house style DeCarlo set, and later went on to work with him at Archie, as did occasional ''Millie'' artist [[Henry Scarpelli]]. [[Al Hartley]] and [[Ogden Whitney]] provided an occasional cover.

Highlights of the run include a four-page "[[Powerhouse Pepper]]" backup by [[Basil Wolverton]] in #9, and work by humor great [[Harvey Kurtzman]] in #8, 10, 11, 13, 14, & 16.  Lee and Goldberg had  [[Jack Kirby]] guest-star in a story in #107 (March [[1962]]), though the image itself did not particularly look like the comics legend.

Millie became part of the [[Marvel Universe]] with ''[[The Fantastic Four|The Fantastic Four Annual]]'' #3 (1965), the wedding of [[Reed Richards]] and [[Susan Storm]], when fellow humor-comic stars [[Hellcat (comics)|Patsy Walker]] and Hedy Wolfe talk about wanting to catch a gllimpse of celebrity Millie, whom they've heard is on the guest list. (She evidently was: [[Alex Ross]] depicted her at the ceremony when he revisted the wedding in the miniseries ''[[Marvels]]''.) Millie reappeared in the [[1980s]] as an older character running her own modeling agency and minding her niece, the titular star of ''Misty'' (Dec. [[1985]] - May [[1986]]), from Marvel's children's-oriented [[Star Comics]] imprint. Millie has also appeared in the superhero comics ''[[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]'' #65, ''[[Dazzler]]'' #34, and ''[[She-Hulk|The Sensational She-Hulk]]'' #59-60.

The series won an Alley Award for "Best Romance Comic" at the 1968 New York Comic Art Convention.

==In other media==
A [[1986]] [[Off-Broadway]] [[Musical theater|musical]], ''Dial "M" For Model'' by John Epperson, inspired by Millie, was staged at LaMaMa E.T.C. Not a direct adaptation, it featured, for instance, the female impersonator [[Lypsinka]] as Mannequin St. Claire, a character based on Chili.

==Remakes==
In [[2003]], Marvel President [[Bill Jemas]] told the press there were plans to reimagine Millie as a 15-year-old tennis player for a comic-book series called ''15 Love'', to be targeted at teenaged girls. The possibility of a Millie movie was also mentioned at that time.
