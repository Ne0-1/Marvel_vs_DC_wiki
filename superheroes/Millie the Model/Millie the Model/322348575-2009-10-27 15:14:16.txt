'''''Millie the Model''''' was [[Marvel Comics]]' longest-running [[humor]] title, first published by the company's 1940s predecessor, [[Timely Comics]], and continuing through its 1950s forerunner,  [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], to 1970s Marvel.

==Publication history==
The series ran 207 issues from Winter 1945 to December 1973, a 28-year span that included one of the first Marvel Comics annuals (in 1962), and spin-offs including ''A Date with Millie'', ''Life with Millie'', ''Mad About Millie'' and ''Modelling with Millie''. Initially a humorous career-gal book about [[New York City]] model Millie Collins, it very quickly evolved into a broader, more [[slapstick]]y comedy — though for a time becoming a [[Romance comics|romantic adventure]] series with all the same characters (#113-153, March 1963 - Aug. 1967) before returning to humor.  

The premiere issue was [[penciler|penciled]] and [[inked]] by [[Ruth Atkinson]], one of the pioneering women [[cartoonists]] in comic books; some sources credit her with creating the character, while others say it was a co-creation with [[writer]] and Timely editor-in-chief [[Stan Lee]]. Following this first issue, subsequent early stories were drawn mostly by Timely staffer [[Mike Sekowsky]].

The character's essential look, however, was the work of future [[Archie Comics]] great [[Dan DeCarlo]], who would later create ''[[Josie and the Pussycats (comic)|Josie and the Pussycats]]'' and other Archie icons. DeCarlo's remarkable 10-year run on the series, from #18-93 (June 1949 - Nov. 1959), was succeeded by the team of writer [[Stan Lee]], Marvel's editor-in-chief, and artist [[Stan Goldberg]], a.k.a. "Stan G.", the main Atlas/Marvel colorist at the time. Goldberg mimicked the house style DeCarlo set, and later went on to work with him at Archie, as did occasional ''Millie'' artist [[Henry Scarpelli]]. [[Al Hartley]] and [[Ogden Whitney]] provided an occasional cover.

The occasional backup feature included a four-page "[[Powerhouse Pepper]]" story by famed cartoonist [[Basil Wolverton]] in #9, and work by humorist [[Harvey Kurtzman]] in #8, 10-11, 13-14, & 16.  Lee and Goldberg had [[Jack Kirby]] guest-star in a story in #107 (March 1962), though the image itself did not particularly look like the comics legend.

Millie became part of the [[Marvel Universe]] with ''[[The Fantastic Four|Fantastic Four Annual]]'' #3 (1965), which chronicled the wedding of [[Reed Richards]] and [[Susan Storm]]: Fellow humor-comic stars [[Hellcat (comics)|Patsy Walker]] and Hedy Wolfe, among the sidewalk crowd outside, talk about wanting to catch a glimpse of celebrity Millie, whom they've heard is on the guest list. [[Alex Ross]] depicted her at the ceremony when he revisited the wedding in the miniseries ''[[Marvels]]''.

She reappeared in the 1980s as an older character running her own modeling agency and minding her niece, the titular star of writer-artist [[Trina Robbins]]' ''Misty'' (Dec. 1985 - May 1986), from Marvel's children's-oriented [[Star Comics]] imprint. Millie has also appeared in the superhero comics ''[[Defenders (comics)|The Defenders]]'' #65 (Nov. 1978); ''[[Dazzler]]'' #34 (Oct. 1985), along with Chili; ''[[She-Hulk|The Sensational She-Hulk]]'' #60 (Feb. 1994); and in the [[kitsch]]y [[flashback]] series ''The Age of the Sentry'' #3 (Jan. 2009). 

Mille starred alongside [[Patsy Walker]] and [[Mary Jane Watson]] in a 23-page story "Un-enchanted Evening", by writer [[Paul Tobin]] and artist [[Colleen Coover]], in ''King-Size Spider-Man Summer Special'' #1 (Oct. 2008). Millie stars in the four-issue [[miniseries]] ''Models, Inc.(Oct. 2009 - Jan. 2010),

==Fictional character biography==
Millie Collins worked as a model for the Hanover Agency, where her boyfriend was photographer Clicker (originally Flicker). Her best friend was Toni Turner, and redheaded model Chili Storm her friendly nemesis. (Millie: "Sorry I'm late! I just got back from the beauty parlor!"  Chili: "Too bad they didn't have time to take you!")

==Awards==
The series won an [[Alley Award]] for "Best Romance Comic" at the 1968 [[Comic Art Convention|New York Comic Art Convention]].

==In other media==
A 1986 [[Off-Broadway]] [[Musical theater|musical]], ''Dial "M" For Model'' by John Epperson, inspired by Millie, was staged at LaMaMa E.T.C. Not a direct adaptation, it featured, for instance, the female impersonator [[Lypsinka]] as Mannequin St. Claire, a character based on Chili.<ref>[http://www.lypsinka.com/favorite/millie.html Lypsinka official site: My Favorite Things!]</ref>

==Remakes==
In 2003, Marvel's then-president, [[Bill Jemas]], told the press there were plans to reimagine Millie as a 15-year-old tennis player for a comic-book series called ''15 Love'', to be targeted at teenaged girls. The possibility of a Millie movie was also mentioned at that time.<ref>[http://www.comicon.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=36;t=000762;p=1 Comicon.com (March 4, 2003): "Millie the Model Turns to Tennis?", by Heidi MacDonald]</ref>
