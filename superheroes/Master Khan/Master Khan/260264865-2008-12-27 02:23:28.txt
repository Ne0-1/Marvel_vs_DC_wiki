==Fictional character biography==
Khan was a notable adversary early in [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]]'s career, fighting Iron Fist, [[Luke Cage]], [[Colleen Wing]], and [[Misty Knight]] on numerous occasions as well as sending his agent [[Scimitar (Marvel Comics)|Scimitar]] against them.  When Khan stole the [[Sons of the Tiger]]'s tiger talismans, he badly injured [[Bob Diamond (comics)|Bob Diamond]].

Later, when Iron Fist contracted radiation poisoning, Luke Cage took him to K'un-L'un for treatment. While there, Iron Fist was secretly replaced by a doppelgänger of the plantlike [[H'ylthri]] race, K'un-Lun's ancient enemies. Soon after their return to the outside world, the doppelgänger is destroyed, pummeled by the alien [[Super-Skrull]], as a result of a bizarre scheme engineered by Master Khan. Cage is blamed for the apparent murder of Iron Fist.

[[Namor]] traveled to K'un-L'un, where he found Iron Fist, who had been presumed dead for many months. While in stasis with the H'ylthri, Rand managed to focus his chi, curing the cancer. Returning to Earth and investigating the apparent invasion of Earth by the H'ylthri, Namor was forced to fight their captive, [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]].  The battle was interrupted by Master Khan, who wiped Namor's memory and dumped him in the American Midwest.

Namor was missing for almost a year, until Namorita tracked him down using a psychic link to him she had recently discovered. Namor did not regain his memory until sometime afterward, when he was captured by [[Doctor Doom]]. The ship Doom had used to do so was then magically imprisoned in a bottle by Master Khan, who then assumed Namor's form and sold off much of Oracle's holdings. Namor soon broke the bottle and the spell, and killed Khan.
