'''Mimic''' ('''Calvin Montgomery Rankin''') is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[fictional character|character]], who was briefly a member of the [[X-Men]]. Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Werner Roth (comics)|Werner Roth]], he first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' #19 ([[1966#April|April 1966]]).

Mimic possesses the ability to adapt the powers and abilities of people around him. He permanently absorbed the abilities of the five original X-Men. He is the first character added to the team after the original line-up and possesses the dubious honor of being the first member asked to leave. In the [[1990s]], he re-emerged as a [[supervillain|villain]].

An [[alternate reality]] version of Mimic has become a popular member of the reality-hopping team the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]].

==Character history==
Calvin Rankin, using one of his late brilliant father's inventions, either awakened his latent [[mutant (comics)|mutant]] gift or received [[superpowers|superhuman powers]]: the ability to temporarily copy the skills, physical traits, knowledge, and superpowers of any person within close range (approximately ten feet). Rankin set his sights on joining the X-Men and blackmailed his way into their ranks, receiving the rank of deputy leader, but he was expelled shortly after for placing his own interests above those of the team. He apparently sacrificed himself in a battle with [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and was believed dead for years. 

In actuality, Mimic was in a coma, and only when the regenerative mutant [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] came near him was he able to copy his healing factor in order to heal himself. When his power to mimic powers grew to instead drain life energy, Mimic was moved to a remote Siberian location where he remained until [[X-force]] investigated a distress call. X-force found dead scientists and an enraged Mimic who blamed them for their deaths. During the fight, Mimic copied the powers of [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]], and their identical charge caused a large explosion. His mimicking of [[Warpath (comics)|James Proudstar]]'s power diplayed for the first time the full extent of the power. 

Mimic joined the evil entity [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]], and after Onslaught's defeat, [[Operation: Zero Tolerance]] imprisoned him. [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] tracked his telepathic signature, thinking that he was [[Professor X]], and freed him. Mimic later joined the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]].

Mimic reappeared in ''[[Thunderbolts]]'' #103 (August 2006) as a prisoner of [[Baron Zemo]] and [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]].

==Powers and abilities==
Aside from his ability to copy the skills, physical traits, knowledge, and superpowers of nearby people, the Mimic permanently possesses the powers of the original five X-Men: [[Archangel (comics)|Angel]], [[Beast (comics)|The Beast]], [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] and [[Jean Grey|Marvel Girl]]. Thus, he has powers of [[flight]] (granted by angelic wings), increased strength and agility, optic blasts, temperature manipulation, and [[telekinesis]]. He partly retains [[Professor X]]'s telepathic powers so that his telepathic signature is mistaken for that of Charles Xavier's himself in ''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' #123, although he is not shown to be uncovered during recent searches for Xavier. He may also retain Wolverine's recuperative abilities.   

===A mutant?===
The original Mimic as created by Stan Lee and Werner Roth is not a mutant, but receives his powers after breathing gas in his father's laboratory. Later X-Men writer [[Scott Lobdell]] claims it merely awakens Mimic's latent mutant powers, but this point is never made in the comics themselves and remains a point of discussion.

==Alternate versions==
===Exiles===

{{main|Exiles (Marvel Comics)}}
Mimic's heroic counterpart from a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel world]] is a founding member of the  [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|multiverse]]-traveling superhero team the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]. This Mimic has a clear mutant origin, and his powers have a restiction: He can only copy a maximum of five mutant powers at a time, the copied abilities are about half as powerful as those of the original owners, and he can't copy knowledge and skills.

In his reality, the Exiles' Rankin joined the Brotherhood and was defeated by the X-Men. Abandoned by the Brotherhood, Mimic was imprisoned and was only freed by the intervention of [[Professor X]], who invited him to join the [[X-Men]]. Mimic became a dedicated member and eventual leader of the team, helping to make his world one where mutants and other heroes are respected and treated with a level of fame and celebrity. Much like Wolverine, who in his reality is one of his closest friends, Rankin is fond of beer and music and has an unrequited love for [[Jean Grey]]. Rankin owns a chain of record stores and has written a book.

Although Rankin is used to being a team leader, he defers leadership to [[Blink (comics)|Blink]], who possesses the tactical advantage of never having encountered many of the characters whose alternate counterparts the Exiles face. Rankin also begins a romantic relationship with Blink. The Exiles' missions grow increasingly dangerous, and after an encounter with the sorcery of [[Union Jack (comics)|Union Jack]], Mimic is trapped for four years on an Earth overrun by the [[Brood (comics)|Brood]]. He is implanted with a Brood egg and eventually attacks his teammates when he returns to them, killing Mariko Yashida ([[Sunfire (Exiles)|Sunfire]]). Devastated, Mimic swears never to kill again, and his subsequent hesitation allows the villain [[Proteus (comics)|Proteus]] to possess him when the Exiles visit the [[House of M]] version of the regular Marvel Universe. After Proteus leaves Mimic's burnt husk of a corpse. The Exiles put his body into stasis, and Blink later taken the him to his home reality for burial.

==Appearance in other media==
Mimic appears in the [[X-Men (TV series)|''X-Men'' animated series]] in the beginning of the episode "One Man's Worth", as a member of the Mutant Resistance fighting a quadruped robot. He has the muscular body of the Beast and Angel's wings, and he shoots an optic blast, seemingly having the mutant powers of the original X-Men permanently.

Mimic appears in issue #6 of the ''[[X-Men Evolution]]'' comic book. He befriends [[Spyke]]  but leaves the team due to his arrogance. Unlike in the regular comics, his body (designwise) remains the same when he copies powers.
