'''Mimic''' is a [[fictional character]], a former [[superhero]] in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He first appeared in ''[[X-Men]]'' #24. He was the first character to join the X-Men who was not actually a founding member; he was also the first character to be expelled from the ranks of the X-Men.

Calvin Rankin was the son of a brilliant scientist and, unbeknownst to him, a [[mutant]] whose powers had not yet surfaced. Using one of his late father's inventions, Rankin awakened his latent mutant gift: the ability to temporarily copy the power of any mutant he came into contact with. Mimic set his sights on joining the X-Men, and blackmailed his way into their ranks, only to be expelled shortly afterwards for placing his own interests over those of the team. He was later apparently killed in a battle with [[the Incredible Hulk]], and was believed dead for years. In actuality, he was in a coma, and only when the regenerative mutant [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] came near him could his body repair itself. The Mimic became a full-fledged [[supervillain]] ar this point, eventually becoming a member of the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]].

Aside from his ability to copy the powers of nearby mutants (and possibly other [[superhuman]]s), the Mimic has permanently copied the powers of the original five X-Men ([[Archangel (comics)|Angel]], [[Beast (comics)|The Beast]], [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] and [[Jean Grey|Marvel Girl]]).  He may also retain Wolverine's recuperative abilities.

The Mimic's heroic counterpart from a [[parallel world]] is a member and founder of the [[multiverse]]-traveling superhero team [[Exiles (comics)|The Exiles]], where he got envolved with [[Blink (comics)|Blink]] (Clarice Ferguson) and became the leader of the team when [[Blink (comics)|Blink]] was sent home by [[Timebroker]].
