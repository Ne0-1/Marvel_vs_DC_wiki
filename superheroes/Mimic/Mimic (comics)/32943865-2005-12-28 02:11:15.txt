'''Mimic''' is a [[fictional character]], a former [[superhero]] in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He first appeared in ''[[X-Men]]'' #19, [[Stan Lee]]'s last issue. He was the first additional character added to the original five student lineup of the team and possesses the dubious honor of being the first member asked to leave the team. 

An alternate-universe version of the character has been recently become better known to comic fans as a member of the [[Exiles (comics)|Exiles]] series.

===Character history===
Calvin Rankin was the son of a brilliant scientist and unbeknownst to him a [[mutant]] whose powers had not yet surfaced. Using one of his late father's inventions, Rankin awakened his latent mutant gift: the ability to temporarily copy the power of any mutant he came within ten feet of. Mimic set his sights on joining the X-Men and blackmailed his way into their ranks only to be expelled shortly afterwards for placing his own interests over those of the team. He was later apparently killed in a battle with [[the Incredible Hulk]] and was believed dead for years. 

In actuality, he was in a coma and only when the regenerative mutant [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] came near him was Mimic able to copy his healing factor in order to heal himself. The Mimic then found refuge with the British super-hero team [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] before later joining the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]].  Mimic has clashed with several different Marvel heroes over the years, notably [[X-Force]], where his mimic ability first showed [[Warpath (comics)|James Proudstar]] the full extent of his powers.

Aside from his ability to copy the powers of nearby mutants and possibly other [[superhuman]]s, the Mimic has permanently copied the powers of the original five X-Men: [[Archangel (comics)|Angel]], [[Beast (comics)|The Beast]], [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] and [[Jean Grey|Marvel Girl]].  He may also retain Wolverine's recuperative abilities.
