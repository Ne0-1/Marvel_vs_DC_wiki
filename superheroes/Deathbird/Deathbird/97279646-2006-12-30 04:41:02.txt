'''Deathbird''' ('''Cal'syee Neramani''') is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillainess]], an adversary of the [[X-Men]]. Created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Keith Pollard]], she first appeared in ''[[Carol Danvers|Ms. Marvel]]'' #9

Deathbird is part of a segment of the [[Extraterrestrial_life_in_popular_culture|extraterrestrial]] [[Shi'ar]] race that possesses [[talon]]-tipped [[wing|wings]]. She is the hated sister of the Shi'ar empress [[Lilandra]], and constantly seeks to usurp her sister's throne. 

==Character biography==
[[Image:Ms-Marvel-009.jpg|left|180px|thumb|Deathbird's first appearance (1977).]]
Deathbird was born Cal'syee Neramani to the ruling house of the Shi'ar Imperium. Her name was stripped from her after as it was [[prophecy|prophecied]] that she was destined to commit great evil. She was exiled after brutally murdering both her mother and an unnamed sister.

Her younger sister [[Lilandra]] became Majestrix of the Empire following the death of their brother, D'Ken. Deathbird decided to take the throne for herself, and allied with the councilman Samedar and the alien parasites called the [[Brood (comics)|Brood]]. The X-Men defeated her and her allies, but not before being infected with the Brood (although they were ultimately cured thanks to the efforts of [[Carol Danvers|Binary]] and the [[Acanti]] Soulsinger). She later retook the throne, this time succeeding. However, [[Skrull]]s impersonating Lilandra and her consort, [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]], took the throne from her.  With [[Lila Cheney (comics)|Lila Cheney]]'s help, she and the X-Men defeated the Skrulls, and Deathbird received a position of power in Lilandra's Empire; after the [[Kree]]-Shi'ar War, she was granted dominion over a portion of the conquered Kree Empire, although the Kree seem to have since become independent once more.


===Romance with Bishop=== 
When the [[Shi'Ar]] asked for the X-Men’s help against the invading [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]], who had already reached their throneworld Chandilar, the X-Men allied themselves with Deathbird. They managed to fend off a Phalanx assault on the Shi'ar Empire, and during the conflict, Deathbird and the X-Men [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] forged a warrior's respect for each other. Deathbird was amazed that the Earth mutant showed no fear and stood up to her, and they also seemed physically attracted to each other. 

As a gesture of honor, Deathbird escorted the mutants back to Earth but their ship was inexplicably destroyed in transit. Deathbird escaped annihilation, with the injured Bishop, using a private ship. She initially convinced Bishop that he was [[paralysis|paralyzed]] due to his injuries and that, of all the X-Men, only he survived. However, not before long, Bishop realized that he was not injured but that Deathbird was using the lab equipment to hold him in stasis. The craft was soon attacked, and Bishop convinced her to release him so that they could deal with the matter together. Eventually, they bonded and soon became romantically involved.

During their journeys, the two were accidentally transported to an alternate future Earth that was ruled by an evil daughter of Shi’Ar Empress Lilandra and [[Charles Xavier]]. Bishop and Deathbird helped the rebels to oppose her and Deathbird defeated her niece in a duel. She could have slain her, and every instinct told her to do so, but she let her live. Bishop's influence was showing its effects. The heroes of the liberated earth helped Bishop and Deathbird to return to their own time and they continued their quest to get home.

In ''[[X-Men: The End]]'', written by [[Chris Claremont]], an alternate future of the X-Men's last days, it is revealed that there is a mutant called [[Aliyah Bishop|Aliyah]] who is the daughter of [[Bishop (comics)|Lucas Bishop]] and Deathbird.

===Betrayal===
[[Image:bishop15.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Cover to ''Bishop: The Last X-Man'' #15.]]
Eventually, Bishop and Deathbird returned to the Sol System and encountered the inert planetary mass of the [[Living Monolith]] on their way to Terra Firma. Curious, the two landed their craft and investigated the manshaped planet. Suddenly Deathbird betrayed Bishop to a cadre of Skrulls and he was returned to Earth in order to implement the ultimate plans of the Skrulls' ally, [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. Deathbird was herself betrayed and transformed by Apocalypse into one of his [[Four Horsemen of Apocalyse (comics)|Horsemen]]. With the title of War, Deathbird helped Apocalypse assemble the X-Men he referred to as "the Twelve." Apocalypse was defeated, however, and Deathbird and the Horsemen scattered. 

Deathbird and Bishop later ran into each other during the [[Maximum Security]] event. Earth had been made a prison planet, with an energy barrier around the solar system, and Deathbird has the key to unlocking it. Bishop confronted her, and the two fought. Deathbird then dared Bishop to kill her, before opening an airlock and getting sucked out into space. Bishop was able to close the airlock, and then admitted to himself that he hated her.

It was presumed that Deathbird perished in the aftermath of this, but she has recently been seen on the cover of ''Uncanny X-Men'' #475 and will likely play a major role in "The Rise and Fall of the Shi'ar Empire" storyline. Self-exiled in a planet on the Shi'ar Empire, she was sought by [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]] as a part of his still-unknown plan of vengeance against the entire Shi'ar race. Taken prisoner, Vulcan finally managed to find her in the same prison he was taken, where Deathbird revealed she was imprisoned for life. Corrupting the Vice-Chancellor, Deathbird talked the young mutant into freeing her, promising help in his vengeance against Lilandra.

==Powers and abilities==
Deathbird is a mutant of the Shi'ar species; she has superhuman strength, stamina, and enhanced endurance. She can lift at least 5 tons. She shares the same avian-like physiology typical of her race (such as hollow bones and greater than human strength), but in her case the avian characteristics are more pronounced. This is because she is a "genetic throwback," meaning that she resembles the more primitive Shi'ar. She has inherited atavistic characteristics (such as fully functioning wings) that most Shi'ar lack and is capable of self-propelled flight at a natural winged flight limit velocity. 

Deathbird's fingernails are essentially talons which can score steel and tear through substances such as bone and tissue easily. 

Aside from her natural physical advantages, Deathbird is a formidably trained warrior of great cunning and skill.

==Appearances in other media==
===Television===
*Deathbird made several appearances in the original 1990's ''[[X-Men (animated series)|X-Men]]'' [[animated series]]. In flashbacks, she was seen at D'Ken's side when Christopher and Katherine Summers were abducted. Following Lilandra's ascension to the throne of the empire, Deathbird sought to overthrow her sister and install herself as Majestrix, for which she joined Apocalypse, and was at his side when [[Fabian Cortez]] was captured. However, Apocalypse was merely using Deathbird for his own plans. During the episodes ''Beyond Good and Evil'', she attacked Lilandra alongside Apocalypse, however, he abandoned her at the mercy of Lilandra and Imperial Guard Praetor Gladiator. Apocalypse simply wanted a distraction so he could kidnap Oracle, the psychic of the Imperial Guard.

===Video games===
*Deathbird also appeared in the first [[X-Men (Sega video game)|Sega Genesis X-Men]] video game, where she had kidnapped her sister Lilandra. In the video game she seems to have the ability to blast flamethrowers.

*She appeared as a boss in the video game ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]''.
