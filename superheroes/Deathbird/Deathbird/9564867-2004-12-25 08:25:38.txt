'''Deathbird''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  She is a [[mutant]] [[alien]] of the [[Shi'ar]] race who, unlike most other of her race, has [[wing]]s.  She first appeared in ''[[Ms. Marvel]]'' #9, but is better known as a foe of the [[X-Men]].

Deathbird was born Cal'syee Neramani to the ruling house of the Shi'ar Empire, but her name was stripped from her as it was determined that she was [[prophecy|prophecied]] to do great evil.  Her younger siblings, [[D'Ken]] and [[Lilandra]], became Majestor and then Majestrix, respectively, of the Empire.  Deathbird decided to take the throne for herself, and allied with the councilman Samedar and the alien parasites called the [[Brood (comics)|Brood]].  The X-Men defeated her and her allies, but not before being infected with the Brood, although they were ultimately cured.  She later retook the throne, this time succeeding.  However, [[Skrull]]s impersonating Lilandra and her consort, [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]], took the throne from her.  With [[Lila Cheney]]'s help, she and the X-Men defeated the Skrulls, and Deathbird received a position of power in Lilandra's Empire.  After the Kree-Shi'ar War, she was granted dominion over a portion of the conquered Kree Empire, although the Kree seem to have since become independent once more.  More recently, she became a lover of [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] during a space voyage, and later kidnapped him; when he escaped she hunted him down, only to apparently suffocate in the vacuum of space following a battle aboard a spaceship.
