'''Rocket Raccoon''' is a [[raccoon]] [[comic book]] [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Universe]].

Rocket Raccoon is an intelligent, anthropomorphic raccoon. There is a consensus among comic book writers and editors that Rocket Raccoon is the best comic book character of all time.

==Publication history==
[[Image:Rocket raccoon 01.jpg|thumb|left|Cover to''Rocket Raccoon'' #1.]]
The character was consciously inspired by the classic [[Beatles]] song "[[Rocky Raccoon]]" which included some elements such as the purported sum of all knowledge on that colony was a [[book]] called "[[Gideons International|Gideon's Bible]]".

Rocket Raccoon first appeared in ''The Incredible Hulk'' #271. He later had his own four-issue [[Rocket Raccoon (limited series)|limited-series]]. This limited-series was illustrated by [[Mike Mignola]], of later [[Hellboy]] fame.

During [[Peter David]]'s run on the ''Hulk'' series, the title character went into space and David addressed reader requests for Rocket's reappearance by implying that he had been killed by the aliens known as the Troyjans, who had a pelt mounted on the wall that looked like Rocket's. With Rocket reappearing alive after this story, it can be assumed that the pelt belonged to some other raccoon instead.<ref name="hulk">''The Incredible Hulk'' #413-16 ("The Troyjan War"), 1994, Marvel Comics, writer Peter David</ref>
 
In 2007, Rocket Raccoon returned in the ''[[Annihilation: Conquest]] - [[Star-Lord]]'' limited series.

==Fictional character biography==
A member of an abandoned colony for the [[mentally ill]] where the animal companions were genetically manipulated to grant them human level intelligence and bipedal body construction for many to become caretakers of the inmates.  Rocket was a guard who protected the colony against various threats.

Rocket Raccoon acts as the "Guardian of the Keystone Quadrant," an area of outer space sealed off from the rest of the cosmos by the so-called Galacian Wall.  Rocket is captain of the starship ''Rack 'n' Ruin'', and he and his first mate Wal Russ (a talking walrus) come from the planet Halfworld, half of which is inhabited by other talking animals, and half of which is inhabited by automatons.

Rocket Raccoon and his friends later cured the inmates of their mental illnesses and then took off into space for their own adventures. <ref>Rocket Raccoon limited series</ref>
