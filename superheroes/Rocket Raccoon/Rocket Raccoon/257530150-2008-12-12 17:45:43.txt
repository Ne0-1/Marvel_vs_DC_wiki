'''Rocket Raccoon''' is a [[raccoon]] [[comic book]] [[fiction]]al [[character (arts)|character]] in the [[Marvel Universe]]. He first appeared in [[Hulk (comics)|Incredible Hulk]](vol. 2) #271 (May 1982). Rocket Raccoon is an intelligent, [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] raccoon. 

==Publication history==
The character was created by [[Bill Mantlo]] and [[Keith Giffen]] and consciously inspired by the classic [[the Beatles|Beatles]] song "[[Rocky Raccoon]]"<ref>[http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/06/12/365-reasons-to-love-comics-163/]</ref> which included "[[Gideons International|Gideon's Bible]]" (in the comic book limited series it was a [[book]] that contained the sum of all knowledge on the "loony colony").

Rocket Raccoon first appeared in ''The Incredible Hulk'' #271. He later had his own four-issue [[Rocket Raccoon (limited series)|limited series]]. This limited series was [[penciller|penciled]] by [[Mike Mignola]] and [[inked]] by [[Al Gordon (comics)|Al Gordon]].  Issue #3 was inked by [[Al Milgrom]].

==Fictional character biography==
A member of an abandoned colony for the [[mental disorder|mentally ill]] where the animal companions were genetically manipulated to grant them human level intelligence and bipedal body construction for many to become caretakers of the inmates.  Rocket was a guard who protected the colony against various threats.

Rocket Raccoon acts as the "Guardian of the Keystone Quadrant", an area of outer space sealed off from the rest of the cosmos by the so-called Galacian Wall.  Rocket is captain of the starship ''Rack 'n' Ruin'', and he and his first mate Wal Russ (a talking walrus) come from the planet Halfworld, half of which is inhabited by other talking animals, and half of which is inhabited by automatons.

Rocket Raccoon and his friends later cured the inmates of their mental illnesses and then took off into space for their own adventures.<ref>Rocket Raccoon limited series</ref>

During [[Peter David]]'s run on the ''Hulk'' series, Hulk went into space and David addressed reader requests for Rocket's reappearance by implying that he had been killed by the aliens known as the Troyjans, who had a pelt mounted on the wall that looked like Rocket's. With Rocket reappearing alive after this story, it can be assumed that the pelt belonged to some other raccoon.<ref name="hulk">''The Incredible Hulk'' #413-16 ("The Troyjan War"), 1994, Marvel Comics, writer Peter David</ref>
 
In [[2007 in comics|2007]], Rocket Raccoon returned in the ''[[Annihilation: Conquest]] - [[Star-Lord]]'' limited series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/003641508.cfm |title=GETTING EXCLUSIVE AT MARVEL’S CUP O’ JOE |accessdate=2007-02-25 |publisher=WizardUniverse.com}}{{Dead link|date=November 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://wizarduniverse.com/_images_/003641/ANNCONQUESTSTARLORD.jpg |title=Image |accessdate=2007-02-25 |publisher=WizardUniverse.com}}{{Dead link|date=November 2008}}</ref> Rocket Raccoon is depicted as a gifted military tactician who is also fearless, loyal, and insightful. It is also heavily implied that he has a case of [[obsessive compulsive disorder]]. Rocket's trademark rocket skates are absent, and in some of the earlier issues, he appears without the prosthetic hands which allowed Keystone Quadrant's animal population to carry out tasks and operations that its humans and robots were able to, such as using weapons.

According to Marvel's official website, Rocket Raccoon will continue his new adventures as a part of the team ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (modern)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' along with other characters from the ''Annihilation: Conquest'' series.<ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=156983 Greeting the Guardians: Rocket Raccoon, Groot], [[Newsarama]], May 14, 2008</ref> ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' Volume 2, #1 was released in May 2008.
