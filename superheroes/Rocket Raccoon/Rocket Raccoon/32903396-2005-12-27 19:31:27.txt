'''Rocket Raccoon''' was a [[raccoon]] character in the [[Marvel Universe]] who first appeared as a guest character in the ''[[Hulk (comics)|Incredible Hulk]]'' series.

The character first appeared in a abandoned colony for the [[mentally ill]] where the animal companions were genetically manipulated to grant them human level intelligence and bipedal body construction for many to become caretakers of the inmates.  Rocket was a guard who protected the colony against various threats.

The character later starred in a [[mini-series]] where his friends later cured the inmates of their mental illnesses and then took off into space for their own adventures.

During [[Peter David]]'s run on the ''Hulk'' series, the title character went into space and David addressed reader requests for Rocket's reappearance (he disliked the character) by showing he was killed and skinned by one of the story's villains.

The character was consciously inspired by the classic [[Beatles]] song "[[Rocky Raccoon]]" which included some elements such as the purported sum of all knowledge on that colony was a [[book]] called "Gideon's Bible".
