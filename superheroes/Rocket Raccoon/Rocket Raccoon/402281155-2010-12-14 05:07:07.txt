==Publication history==
The character was created by [[Bill Mantlo]] and [[Keith Giffen]] and consciously inspired by the classic [[the Beatles|Beatles]] song "[[Rocky Raccoon]]"<ref>{{cite web |first=Bill |last=Reed |url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/06/12/365-reasons-to-love-comics-163/ |title=365 Reasons to Love Comics #163 |work=Comics Should Be Good |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=June 12, 200 |accessdate= }}</ref> which included "[[Gideons International|Gideon's Bible]]" (in the comic book limited series it was a [[book]] that contained the sum of all knowledge on the "loony colony").

Rocket Raccoon first appeared in ''[[Marvel Preview]]'' #7 (Summer 1976), in the back-up feature ''The Sword in the Star''.<ref>{{marvunapp |http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/earthswordinthestar.htm |Earth - Sword in the Star}}</ref> He subsequently appeared in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' #271 (May 1982). He later had his own four-issue [[Rocket Raccoon (limited series)|limited series]] (in an afterword to the first issue, Mantlo himself asserted that this was the same character seen in ''Preview''). This limited series was [[penciller|penciled]] by [[Mike Mignola]] and [[inked]] by [[Al Gordon (comics)|Al Gordon]].  Issue #3 was inked by [[Al Milgrom]].

Rocket Raccoon continued his new adventures starting in 2008 as a part of the team ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' along with other characters from the ''[[Annihilation: Conquest]]'' series.<ref>{{cite web |first=Vaneta |last=Rogers |url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=156983 |title=Greeting the Guardians: Rocket Raccoon, Groot |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |date=May 14, 2008 |accessdate= }}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Rocket Raccoon comes from Halfworld, in the Keystone Quadrant, an abandoned colony for the [[mental disorder|mentally ill]] where the animal companions were genetically manipulated to grant them human level intelligence and bipedal body construction for many to become caretakers of the inmates.  Rocket was Halfworld's chief law officer ("ranger") who protected the colony against various threats.

Rocket Raccoon acts as the "Guardian of the Keystone Quadrant", an area of outer space sealed off from the rest of the cosmos by the so-called Galacian Wall.  Rocket is captain of the starship ''Rack 'n' Ruin'', and he and his first mate Wal Russ (a talking walrus) come from the planet Halfworld, half of which is inhabited by other talking animals, and half of which is inhabited by automatons.

At one point, Judson Jakes tried to steal the Halfworld Bible, but was thwarted by Rocket and the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]].<ref>''Hulk'' #271</ref> Later, Lord Dyvyne abducted Rocket's friend Lylla, and Jakes began the Toy War.<ref>''Rocket Raccoon'' #1</ref> As the Toy War continued, Blackjack O'Hare teamed up with Rocket, and Rocket was reunited with Lylla.<ref>''Rocket Raccoon'' #2</ref> The ''Rakk 'n' Ruin'' was soon destroyed, as Judson Jakes and Lord Dyvyne teamed up to kill Rocket Raccoon.<ref>''Rocket Raccoon'' #3</ref> Rocket Raccoon and his friends cured the Loonies of their mental illnesses, as Judson Jakes and Lord Dyvyne were apparently killed. Rocket and the animals and the robots left Halfworld and took off into space for their own adventures.<ref>''Rocket Raccoon'' #4</ref> Some time later, Rocket was revealed to have been a laboratory subject on the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]]'s planet, and escaped his captivity there.<ref>''Quasar'' #16</ref>

During [[Peter David]]'s run on the ''Hulk'' series, Hulk went into space and David addressed reader requests for Rocket's reappearance by implying that he had been killed by the aliens known as the Troyjans, who had a pelt mounted on the wall that looked like Rocket's. With Rocket reappearing alive after this story, it can be assumed that the pelt belonged to some other raccoon.<ref name="hulk">''The Incredible Hulk'' #413-16 ("The Troyjan War"), 1994, Marvel Comics, writer Peter David</ref>
 
In [[2007 in comics|2007]], Rocket Raccoon returned in the ''[[Annihilation: Conquest]] - [[Star-Lord]]'' limited series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/003641508.cfm |title=GETTING EXCLUSIVE AT MARVEL’S CUP O’ JOE |accessdate=2007-02-25 |publisher=WizardUniverse.com |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070330005815/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/003641508.cfm |archivedate = March 30, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://wizarduniverse.com/_images_/003641/ANNCONQUESTSTARLORD.jpg |title=Image |accessdate=2007-02-25 |publisher=WizardUniverse.com |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070930203058/http://wizarduniverse.com/_images_/003641/ANNCONQUESTSTARLORD.jpg |archivedate = September 30, 2007}}</ref> Rocket Raccoon is depicted as a gifted military tactician who is also fearless, loyal, and insightful. It is also heavily implied that he has a case of [[obsessive compulsive disorder]]. Rocket's trademark rocket skates are absent.

Rocket later joins the new [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] at the behest of his friend Starlord. It is he who suggests that the team adopt that moniker after hearing it mentioned by [[Major Victory (Marvel Comics)|Major Victory]]. Later on, when the team almost disbands and Peter Quill disappears (sent into the Negative Zone by [[Ronan the Accuser|Ronan]]), Rocket keeps the team alive and takes over as leader until they rescue Peter. <ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #s 1-10</ref>

When the team tries to halt the growing War of Kings, Rocket decides to lead the team assigned to make contact with the Shi'ar. However, they are unable to teleport into the Emperor [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]]'s flagship and have to be rescued by the [[Starjammers]] and his old friend [[Ch'od]].

==Powers and abilities==
Rocket Raccoon possesses the normal attributes of an Earth raccoon, including an acute sense of smell and sharp eyesight. He is an accomplished starship pilot, an excellent marksman with the two laser pistols he carries as well as having an affinity for heavy weapons. He's also an excellent military tactician and leader, attributes that see him frequently taking charge of the Guardians of the Galaxy when Starlord is unavailable.
