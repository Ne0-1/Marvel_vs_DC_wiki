'''Rocket Raccoon''' was a [[raccoon]] [[comic book]] [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Universe]].  He first appeared as a guest character in the ''[[Hulk (comics)|Incredible Hulk]]'' series.

The character first appeared in an abandoned colony for the [[mentally ill]] where the animal companions were genetically manipulated to grant them human level intelligence and bipedal body construction for many to become caretakers of the inmates.  Rocket was a guard who protected the colony against various threats.

The character later starred in a [[Rocket Raccoon (miniseries)|mini-series]] where his friends later cured the inmates of their mental illnesses and then took off into space for their own adventures. This mini-series was illustrated by [[Mike Mignola]], of later [[Hellboy]] fame

During [[Peter David]]'s run on the ''Hulk'' series, the title character went into space and David addressed reader requests for Rocket's reappearance (he disliked the character) by showing he was killed and skinned by one of the story's villains. <!---PLEASE get name of Hulk series, issue number, and year--->

The character was consciously inspired by the classic [[Beatles]] song "[[Rocky Raccoon]]" which included some elements such as the purported sum of all knowledge on that colony was a [[book]] called "[[Gideons International|Gideon's Bible]]".
