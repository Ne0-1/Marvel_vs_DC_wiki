==Fictional character biography==
[[Image:Rocket raccoon 01.jpg|right|thumb|left|''Rocket Raccoon'' #1 (May 1985). Cover art by Mike Mignola and Al Gordon.]]
Rocket Raccoon acts as the "Guardian of the Keystone Quadrant", an area of outer space sealed off from the rest of the cosmos by the so-called Galacian Wall. Rocket is captain of the starship ''Rack 'n' Ruin'', and he and his first mate Wal Russ (a talking [[walrus]]) come from the planet Halfworld in the Keystone Quadrant, an abandoned colony for the [[mental disorder|mentally ill]] where the animal companions were genetically manipulated to grant them human level intelligence and bipedal body construction for many to become caretakers of the inmates. Rocket was Halfworld's chief law officer ("ranger") who protected the colony against various threats.<ref name="Hulk271" />

At one point, Judson Jakes tried to steal the Halfworld Bible, but was thwarted by Rocket and the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]].<ref name="Hulk271" /> Later, Lord Dyvyne abducted Rocket's friend Lylla, and Jakes began the Toy War.<ref name="RRminiNo1" /> As the Toy War continued, Blackjack O'Hare teamed up with Rocket, and Rocket was reunited with Lylla.<ref name="RRminiNo2" /> The ''Rack 'n' Ruin'' was soon destroyed, as Judson Jakes and Lord Dyvyne teamed up to kill Rocket Raccoon.<ref name="RRminiNo3" /> Rocket Raccoon and his friends cured the Loonies of their mental illnesses, as Judson Jakes and Lord Dyvyne were apparently killed. Rocket and the animals as well as the robots left Halfworld and took off into space for their own adventures.<ref name="RRminiNo4" /> Some time later, Rocket was revealed to have been a laboratory subject on the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]]'s planet, and escaped his captivity there.<ref name="Quasar15" />

Rocket Raccoon resurfaced as a member of the team chosen to accompany [[Star-Lord]] on his mission to stop a [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]] infiltration of the [[Kree]] homeworld.<ref name="AnnCSL1" /> Rocket is depicted as a gifted military tactician who is fearless, loyal, and insightful. It is heavily implied that he has a case of [[obsessive compulsive disorder]].<ref name="AnnCSL2" /> Rocket's trademark rocket skates are absent.<ref name="AnnCSL1" />

===Guardians of the Galaxy===
Rocket joins the new [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] at the behest of his friend Star-Lord.<ref name="GotGv2no1" /> It is he who suggests that the team adopt that moniker after hearing it mentioned by [[Vance Astro|Major Victory]].<ref name="GotGv2no2" /> Later on, when the team almost disbands and Peter Quill (Star-Lord) disappears (sent into the Negative Zone by [[Ronan the Accuser|Ronan]]), Rocket keeps the team alive, and brings in [[Groot]] as member, as the two had become firm friends.<ref name="GotGv2no8" /> Rocket takes over as leader until they rescue Peter, and save the Earth from an alien invasion.<ref name="GotGv2no10" /> When the team tries to halt the growing [[War of Kings]], Rocket decides to lead the portion of the team assigned to make contact with the [[Shi'ar]]. They are unable to teleport into the Emperor [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]]'s flagship and have to be rescued by the [[Starjammers]] and Rocket's old friend [[Ch'od]].<ref name="GotGv2no13" /> They are able to bring back the rightful queen of the Shi'ar, but she is killed after Rocket departs, much to his horror.<ref name="WarofK3" />

After the Guardians disband,<ref name="ThanosImpDev" /> Rocket Raccoon takes up a normal job with Timely Inc.<ref name="Annihilators1" /> He and Groot were reunited and tricked into returning to Halfworld: here, he found out his memories of the place were mostly half-truths and deliberately crafted fake memories. In reality, Jakes and Blackjack O'Hare had worked with Rocket in providing security at Halfworld Asylum for the Criminally Insane; ''Doctor'' Dyvyne had been Head of Psychology there; and both the anthropomorphic animals and the automaton clowns were deliberately created to work at the asylum, as their appearance would calm the inmates. The crises that Rocket half-remembered had been caused by the psychic supervillain the [[Star Thief]], who had been admitted as an inmate and used his psychic powers to turn the inhabitants against each other. Rocket had turned the warders into a biological "key" to keep Star-Thief locked up, and deliberately altered his mind and left Halfworld so it could never be opened - but he was tricked into returning by the Thief, whose mind had escaped into the asylum after his host body died.<ref name="Annihilators3" />

Rocket is a member of the revamped Guardians of the Galaxy in the first issue of the 2013 series.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Brian Michael Bendis|Bendis, Brian Michael]]|penciller= [[Steve McNiven|McNiven, Steve]]|inker= Dell, John|story= What exactly do you think you're doing, Mister Quill?"|title= Guardians of the Galaxy|volume= 3|issue= 1|date= May 2013}}</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Rocket Raccoon possesses the normal attributes of an Earth [[raccoon]], including speed (which has been additionally amplified by his training), and an acute sense of smell, sight, hearing and touch. He is an accomplished starship pilot, an expert marksman with the two laser pistols he carries as well as having an affinity for heavy weapons. He is a master military tactician and leader, attributes that help him take charge of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy]] when [[Star-Lord]] is unavailable.

In addition to being genetically altered, Rocket is shown to have cybernetic implants within his body. He is only referred to as "Rocket" in the film, even asking "what's a raccoon?" when told of his resemblance to the Earthly animal. He serves as the team's pilot and technical expert, providing the weapon that [[Star-Lord|Peter Quill]] uses against [[Ronan the Accuser]] in the final confrontation and piloting a Ravager ship in the final assault against Ronan's fleet. Rocket also displays a talent for engineering jailbreaks. Having previously escaped from 22 prisons, he devises and executes a scheme to free his eventual teammates from a Nova Corps prison. Screenwriter [[Nicole Perlman]] has stated that early drafts of the film did not include the character due to "a little bit of a fear that he would come across as cartoonish because he's a raccoon." Marvel Studios president [[Kevin Feige]] was persuaded to approve Rocket's inclusion in the film.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/guardians-galaxy-writer-reveals-hit-marvel-film-nearly-didnt-star-rocket-raccoon-1461881|title= ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' Writer Reveals Hit Marvel Film Nearly Didn't Star Rocket Raccoon|first= Ben|last= Skipper|date= August 20, 2014|publisher= ''[[International Business Times]]''|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6S0Tb486k|archivedate= August 21, 2014|deadurl= no|quote= Kevin was a big fan of Rocket, and I'm so glad because I really felt like that was necessary and that was needed.}}</ref> A live raccoon named "Oreo" was used on set to help animators accurately capture the motion and behaviors of it for their CGI model.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://screenrant.com/guardians-of-the-galaxy-movie-rocket-raccoon-making-of-marvel-2014/|title= ''Guardians of the Galaxy'': How They Made Rocket Raccoon in Marvelâ€™s Space Adventure|first= Kofi|last= Outlaw|year= 2014 |publisher= Screen Rant|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140701150322/http://screenrant.com/guardians-of-the-galaxy-movie-rocket-raccoon-making-of-marvel-2014/|archivedate= July 1, 2014|deadurl= no|quote= We needed a raccoon to study how he looked and his behavior, so that our on-screen raccoon, which is generated through CGI will be realistic.
