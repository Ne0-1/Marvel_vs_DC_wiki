'''Madelyne Pryor''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. She was a [[clone (genetics)|clone]] of [[Jean Grey]], created by [[Mister Sinister]]. Although originally a supporting member of the ''X-Men'' cast for quite some time, a variety of troubles in her life (including being rejected by her husband and losing her son) eventually led to her manipulation into becoming a [[demon]]ic-powered [[supervillain]] named the '''Goblin Queen'''. Writer [[Chris Claremont]] may have chosen her name from [[Maddy Prior]], lead singer of the [[folk-rock]] band [[Steeleye Span]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Romance===
[[Image:Madelyne.PNG|160px|left|thumb|Madelyne Pryor before she developed her powers. Art by [[Paul Smith]].]]
Madelyne's biography is complicated because of the many [[retcon]]s involved.  She was originally introduced as a human love interest of [[Cyclops (comics)|Scott Summers]] with a few mysterious traits: she had survived a fatal airplane crash on the same day [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]] died on the moon, and [[Professor X]] was unable to scan her mind (which, he said, was occasionally possible among normal humans).  After a series of events involving [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]] (who wanted revenge for Phoenix having driven him insane) and his telepathic illusions, Madelyne married Scott, and he soon decided to retire from the [[X-Men]].

Madelyne gave birth to a child, named Nathan Christopher Charles Summers. Although Scott tried to live a normal life, he received a call from his former teammate [[Archangel (comics)|Angel]] that Jean Grey had been found, alive. He abandoned Madelyne and his son, who were attacked by Mr. Sinister's [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]], and Nathan was taken away. Madelyne was hospitalized, but Sinister had erased all her records.

Madelyne called the X-Men, and they arrived just as the Marauders did, and fought them off. She stayed with the X-Men as they fought the [[Adversary (comics)|Adversary]], and sacrificed their lives to stop him. Resurrected by the Omniversal Guardian [[Roma (comics)|Roma]], the X-Men worked secretly out of an abandoned [[Reavers (comics)|Reaver]] base in [[Australia]].

===Inferno===
The demon [[S'ym]] later came to Madelyne in her dreams and offered her the power to hurt Scott just as he had hurt her with his adultery and his abandonment of her and their child, and she accepted. She then struck a bargain with another demon, [[N'astirh]], to find her missing baby; the demons then fully activated her latent telekinetic and telepathic powers and she became the Goblin Queen. This started the "[[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]]" [[fictional crossover|crossover]].

This crossover retconned in a new origin for Madelyne.  In this origin, Mr. Sinister, believing that a child of Scott Summers and Jean Grey would have great powers, had created a clone of Jean specifically to fall in love with Scott and produce a child.  When Phoenix committed suicide, a part of the Phoenix Force entered the clone and gave it life. Sinister named the clone Madelyne Pryor, created a false background, and sent her to [[Alaska]], where she fell in love with Scott Summers.

N'astirh took Madelyne to an orphanage in [[Nebraska]], the front for Sinister's genetic laboratory. Sinister captured her and told her all about her creation and her intended goal. She used her black magic to escape, and N'astirh brought her son, intending to sacrifice him to ensure a permanent demonic presence on Earth.

She pitted [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] against the X-Men by reverting to Madelyne and claiming that Scott wanted to take their baby away. She even took Scott's brother [[Havok]] as her lover. The teams defeated N'astirh, but Madelyne, becoming suicidal upon the discovery of being a clone, trapped herself and Jean Grey in a telekinetic bubble (as per [[Psylocke]]'s assessment), then killed herself and tried to telepathically take Jean with her. Jean survived by re-integrating the portions of her essence absorbed by the Phoenix Force and by Madelyne (which she would later expel). 

Her son, Nathan Christopher, turned out to be the time-travelling soldier of fortune [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], who had already been appearing in comics for some time by then.

===''X-Man''===
Madelyne mysteriously re-appeared in ''[[X-Man]]'' #5 (July 1995) with little memory of her past. Under the tutelage of [[Selene (comics)|Selene]], this new Madelyne served as the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]'s Black Rook, gradually learning more of her previous life. ''X-Man'' #25 (March 1997) revealed that "Madelyne" was in fact a psychic construct, unconsciously formed by the mind of [[X-Man|Nate Grey (X-Man)]]. However, unlike other psychic constructs, X-Man was unable to uncreate her.

After apparently aging in ''X-Man'' #52, when X-Man lost a lot of energy during a battle, she did not appear again until much later in ''X-Man'' #67. It was soon revealed that this Madelyne was an impostor, a parallel universe Jean Grey. The then-current writer [[Steven Grant]] (who did not write Madelyne's earlier appearances in the series) stated that he intended that Madelyne had been an impostor for the duration of the entire ''X-Man'' series (which would be a retcon). The in-story evidence is more ambiguous; at one time the impostor implies that Madelyne was fake all along, but at another time she claims she "replaced your Maddie several months ago," implying that only some of Madelyne's appearances were fake (one possibility is that the parallel version of Jean was able to kill Madelyne in her weakened state and replace her).

Madelyne appeared again in ''Cable'' #76, when Cyclops and Cable encountered her as a psionic ghost on the astral plane, apparently stripped of all her tremendous powers, and made peace with her.

==Other versions of Madelyne Pryor==
===Mutant X===
[[Image:goblynqueen.jpg|thumbnail|right|175px|Madelyne Pryor-Summers from the Mutant X reality]]
In the alternate reality known as the [[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]] universe, [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] was carried away into space during a plane crash (instead of his father [[Corsair (comics)|Christopher]] and his mother), leaving his brother [[Havok]] as one of the founders of the [[X-Men]]. As in the [[Earth 616|main Marvel universe]], [[Jean Grey]] died and was replaced by her clone Madelyne, also known as ''Marvel Woman''. She fell in love with Havok and had a son, '''Scotty''', with him.  She also made a deal with S'ym and N'astirh and initiated the ''Inferno Crisis'', unlocking her latent mental abilities. However, she survived the encounter and left with her husband Havok when he formed the splinter group called '''The Six'''. Her evil side resurfaced a number of times, first as the Goblyn Queen (this time intentionally spelled with a "y", instead of the original Gobl'''i'''n Queen's spelling) and later as the Goblyn Force. When it returned the second time, it merged with the [[Beyonder]] to form a nigh-[[omnipotent]] being. Havok supposedly saved her by placing the '''Nexus of Realities''' in her body, purging it of the malevolent Goblyn Force, before he returned once more to the void. 

In addition to the fact of being married to Havok, the Madelyne of this reality also had another key difference: when she manifested the Goblyn persona she transformed into a demonic appearance, having red-orange skin, long horns, claws on her fingers and a third eye in the middle of her forehead.

===Marvel Mangaverse===
In the [[Marvel Mangaverse]] title ''Legacy of Fire'', Madelyne was reinvented as Madelyne Pyre, a powerful sorceress, and posessor of the Phoenix Sword, who was training her sister Jena to be her successor.

==Powers and abilities==

Since Madelyne was cloned from Jean Grey's DNA, she was essentially another version of Jean, and possessed Jean's telekinetic and telepathic abilities.  As Goblin Queen, her powers were exponentially enhanced by demonic magic to the point where her telepathy could be used to release the dark side of a person's personality, and make them evil, and her telekinesis could even warp reality in a localized area. After her resurrection by X-Man (Nate Grey), Madelyne's telepathy was reduced to a much lower level, limiting her to reading minds and communicating by broadcasting her thoughts. Her telekinetic abilities were still enormous: such that Madelyne could move, lift and manipulate fairly large objects, channel her telekinetic powers to fire powerful mental force blasts, focus her psionic energy into a protective shield, and levitate herself in order to fly at fairly high speeds. She also developed powers that Jean never possessed. Madelyne was able to [[teleportation|teleport]] over long distances by psychokinetically shunting herself in and out of the astral plane (she was also shown to be able to carry additional weight, such as another person, when she teleported,  but her limits were never fully tested). Madelyne also discovered that she was able to siphon the psychic energies from other psionic mutants. She could then use the stolen psychic energy to boost her own powers or channel the energy into someone else (usually Nate Grey) to temporarily increase their psionic abilities.

==Trivia==
*A child identifying herself as "Maddy Pryor" appears in the [[Chris Claremont]]-scripted ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] [[annual publication|Annual]]'' #10. The child reappeared as Madelyne's mental image of herself in ''X-Men'' #238, wearing the same clothes as the character from ''Avengers Annual'' #10 and saying almost the same line.
