She was a clone of [[Jean Grey]], created by [[Mister Sinister]] for one of his myriad wheels-within-wheels plans against his master, [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. Although originally a supporting member of the X-Men team for quite some time, a variety of negative events in her life eventually caused her to become a demonic-powered [[supervillain]].[[Image:Uxm241.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cover to Uncanny X-Men #241]]

When [[Phoenix (comics)|Phoenix]] committed suicide, a part of the Phoenix Force entered the lifeless clone that would become Madelyne. Sinister named the clone Madelyne Pryor, created a false background, and sent her to [[Alaska]], where she fell in love with Scott Summers ([[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]]). After a series of events involving [[Mastermind (comics)|Mastermind]] (who wanted revenge for Jean Grey driving him insane) and his telepathic illusions, Madelyne married Scott, and he soon decided to retire from the [[X-Men]].

Madelyne gave birth to a child, named Nathan Christoper Charles Summers. Although Scott tried to live a normal life, he received a call from his former teammate [[Archangel (comics)|Angel]] that Jean Grey had been found, alive. He abandoned Madelyne and his son, who were attacked by Sinister's Marauders and Nathan was taken away. Madelyne was hospitalized, but Sinister had erased all her records.

Madelyne called the X-Men, and they arrived just as the Marauders did, and fought them off. She stayed with the X-Men as they fought the Adversary, and apparently sacrified their lives to stop him. Revived by the [[goddess]] Roma, the X-Men worked secretly out of a an abandoned Reaver base in [[Australia]].

The demon S'ym later came to Madelyne in her dreams and offered her the power to hurt Scott just as he had hurt her, and she accepted. She then struck a bargain with another demon, N'astirh, to find her missing baby, and became the Goblyn Queen. This started the "[[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]] [[fictional crossover|crossover]].

N'astirh took her to an orphanage in [[Nebraska]], the front for Sinister's genetic laboratory. Sinister captured her and told her all about her creation and her intended goal: to bear the child of Scott Summers. She used her black magic to escape, and N'astirh brought her son, intending to sacrifice him to ensure a permanent demonic presence on Earth.[[Image:Madelynedeath.jpg|thumb|right|185px|Madelyne dies Also pictured: Jean Grey.]]

She pitted [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] against the X-Men by reverting to Madelyne and claiming that Scott wanted to take their baby away. The teams defeated N'astirh, but Madelyne trapped herself and Jean Grey in a telepathic bubble, then killed herself and tried to telepathically take Jean with her. Jean survived by re-integrating the portions of her essence absorbed by the Phoenix Force and by Madelyne. 

Her son later became the time-travelling soldier of fortune [[Cable (comics)|Cable]].

Madelyne re-appeared in the [[X-Man]] series as a psychic construct.  This reconstructed Madelyne is now dead, having been killed by another timeline's evil version of Jean Grey.

She has also appeared in certain alternate realities, such as the series '''Mutant X''' and the miniseries '''X-Men: The End.'''
