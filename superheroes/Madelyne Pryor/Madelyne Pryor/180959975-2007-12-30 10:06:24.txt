'''Madelyne Pryor''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. She was a [[clone (genetics)|clone]] of [[Jean Grey]], created by [[Mister Sinister]]. Although originally a supporting member of the ''X-Men'' cast for quite some time, a variety of troubles in her life (including being rejected by her husband and losing her son) eventually led to her manipulation into becoming a [[demon]]ic-powered [[supervillain]] named the '''Goblin Queen'''. Writer [[Chris Claremont]] may have chosen her name from [[Maddy Prior]], lead singer of the [[folk-rock]] band [[Steeleye Span]] (''see'' Notes ''below'').

==Fictional character biography==
===Romance===
[[Image:Madelyne.PNG|170px|left|thumb|Debut appearance; from ''Uncanny X-Men'' #168. Art by [[Paul Smith (comics)|Paul Smith]].]]
Madelyne's biography is complicated because of the many [[retcon]]s involved.  She was originally introduced as a human [[love interest]] of [[Cyclops (comics)|Scott Summers]] with a few mysterious traits: she had survived a fatal [[Aviation accidents and incidents|airplane crash]] on the same day [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]] died on the moon, and [[Professor X]] was unable to scan her mind (which, he said, was occasionally possible among normal humans).  After a series of events involving [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]] (who wanted revenge for Phoenix having driven him insane) and his telepathic illusions, Madelyne married Scott, and he soon decided to retire from the [[X-Men]].

Madelyne gave birth to a child, named Nathan Christopher Charles Summers. Although Scott tried to live a normal life, he received a call from his former teammate [[Archangel (comics)|Angel]] that Jean Grey had been found, alive. He abandoned Madelyne and his son who, shortly thereafter, were attacked by Mr. Sinister's [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]], and Nathan was taken away. Madelyne was hospitalized, but Sinister had erased all her records.

Madelyne called the X-Men for help, and they arrived and fought off another attack by the Marauders. She stayed with the X-Men as they fought the [[Adversary (comics)|Adversary]], and sacrificed their lives to stop him. Resurrected by the Omniversal Guardian [[Roma (comics)|Roma]], the X-Men worked secretly out of an abandoned [[Reavers (comics)|Reaver]] base in [[Australia]].  Madelyne became the team's technical advisor, as she was mysteriously the only one able to fully understand the Reavers' advanced computer array.

===Build-up to Inferno===
The demon [[S'ym]] later invaded Madelyne's mind through her dreams and offered her the power to hurt Scott just as he had hurt her with his adultery and his abandonment of her and their child. Helpless and in confusion, she unwittingly accepted. She later struck a bargain with another demon, [[N'astirh]], to find her missing baby.

At this time, Madelyne started an affair with her brother-in-law [[Havok (X-Men)|Havok]], since he himself had lost his girlfriend [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]], whose body had been taken over by [[Malice (comics)|Malice]].

Captured by the [[Genosha]]n magistrates and taken by force to their island-nation, Madelyne was subject to psychic torture. The idea was that, as part of turning her into a docile slave who served the state, she would be deprived of all motherly instincts. Madelyne lashed out with some powerful subconscious abilities which caused the deaths of her torturers <ref>''Uncanny X-Men'', issue 237, published November 1988</ref>, but, as it tuned out, the damage was done.

In the recorded psychic images of the probe which had been performed upon Madelyne, she appeared as the Goblin Queen, while Genosha's [[Genegineer]] appeared in Sinister's outfit <ref>''Uncanny X-Men'', issue 238, published December 1988</ref>.

The demons then fully activated her latent telekinetic and telepathic powers and she became the Goblin Queen for real. This started the "[[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]]" [[fictional crossover|crossover]].

===Inferno===
This crossover [[retconned]] a new origin for Madelyne. In this origin, Mr. Sinister, believing that a child of Scott Summers and Jean Grey would have great powers, had created a clone of Jean specifically to fall in love with Scott and produce a child. When Phoenix committed suicide, a part of the Phoenix Force entered the clone and gave it life. Sinister named the clone Madelyne Pryor, created a false background and memories for her, and sent her to [[Alaska]] where she and Scott Summers fell in love.

Now, in the present, N'astirh took Madelyne to an orphanage in [[Nebraska]], the front for Sinister's genetic laboratory. Sinister captured her and told her all about her creation and her intended goal. This, and the fact that even her childhood memories were nothing more that those of her hated rival Jean Grey, destroyed Madelyne's last grasps of sanity. She used her black magic to escape, and N'astirh brought her son, intending to sacrifice him to ensure a permanent demonic presence on Earth. As a result of her experiences, Madelyne was now all too willing to go along.

She pitted [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] against the X-Men by reverting to her normal appearance and claiming that Scott wanted to take her baby away. She even turned Jean Grey's own parents into demons, facing her enemy with the dilemma of fighting them or being torn to bits.

The teams eventually defeated N'astirh, but Madelyne, becoming suicidal upon the discovery of being a clone, trapped herself and Jean Grey in a telekinetic bubble, then killed herself and tried to telepathically take Jean with her. Jean survived by re-integrating the portions of her essence absorbed by the Phoenix Force and by Madelyne.

The X-Men and X-Factor then went after Sinister, whom they blamed for Madelyne's breakdown.  More retcons then held that Sinister's connection to Cyclops went back long before his meeting either Jean or Madelyne.  Cyclops was eventually able to disintegrate Sinister (a destruction which, as normal for a popular villain, turned out to be only temporary).

Madelyne's son, Nathan Christopher, later turned out to be the time-travelling [[Soldier of Fortune|soldier of fortune]] [[Cable (comics)|Cable]].

===''X-Man''===
Madelyne mysteriously re-appeared in ''[[X-Man]]'' #5 (July 1995) with little memory of her past. Under the tutelage of [[Selene (comics)|Selene]], this new Madelyne served as the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]'s Black Rook, gradually learning more of her previous life, and eventually meeting [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] in an uneasy truce.  ''X-Man'' #25 (March 1997) revealed that Madelyne was a "psychic construct", unconsciously resurrected by the psionic powers of [[X-Man|Nate Grey (X-Man)]]. However, unlike other psychic constructs, X-Man was unable to uncreate her.

After ''X-Man'' #52 (June 1999), Madelyne did not appear again until much later in ''X-Man'' #67 (September 2000). It was then revealed that this Madelyne was an impostor, a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] Jean Grey.  The impostor implied that Madelyne was fake all along, but at another time she claimed she "replaced your Maddie several months ago."  The in-story evidence remains ambiguous, and ''X-Man'' ended at #75 without any more about her.

Madelyne also appeared in ''Cable'' #76 (February 2000), when Cyclops and Cable encountered her as a psionic ghost on the [[astral plane]], apparently stripped of all her tremendous powers.  This seems to be regarded as her final "standard universe" appearance (as of 2007).

==Additional history==
===Anodyne===
Early in Madelyne and Scott's marriage, they would have a brief but dramatic encounter with the Norse god, [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], in the 2-part ''X-Men and Alpha Flight'' limited-series (December-1985 & January-1986).  Entirely for his own purposes, Loki magically endowed mystical powers on a small group of completely un-superpowered humans, including Madelyne (excluding Scott, who already had powers).  Madelyne was transformed into a mystical healer of virtually any injury, illness, and physical-defect, and was given the name, '''Anodyne'''.  Among Madelyne's deeds with her healing powers, Cyclops' old injury was cured, enabling him to function without protective lenses.  When it was discovered that Loki's intentions were never altruistic, and that his gift was badly flawed, as one of the costs of those powers was the loss of individual creativity and imagination, everyone went against him.  His plans ruined, Loki spitefully removed all the powers he had granted, and Madelyne and the other beneficiaries of the gift were reverted back to their original states, and Scott and everyone else who Anodyne cured of permanent flaws were also regressed back.

It was during this adventure that Madelyne's pregnancy was announced.  Also, Cyclops would meet [[Rachel Summers]] for the first time.

''Note'': Almost immediately, Loki would attempt revenge on the X-Men by having [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] and the [[New Mutants]] abducted and taken to [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]].

===Alternative future===
Madelyne appears in an important role late in the ''[[X-Men: The End]]'' limited-series about a "possible future"; scripted by [[Chris Claremont]]. 

In the story, Madelyne -- through circumstances left unexplained -- makes a surprise return; implied as being the first time since ''Inferno,'' with no references to Nate Grey whatsoever (although she and Cable are later shown to be already familiar).  Mysteriously joined with the X-Men's [[Skrull|alien]] [[Shi'ar|enemies]], Madelyne affected a disguise to infiltrate the X-Men, planting herself near Cyclops for the rest of the series.  No longer insane, but still vengeful at Cyclops, nonetheless Madelyne hesitated in taking revenge and instead took to protecting him, after eavesdropping on Cyclops expressing [[remorse]] for everything that happened to her, and even implied that he genuinely loved her.  Admitting later to having recognized her at some point, Cyclops might have deliberately intended for Madelyne to overhear him, but an understanding and peace was finally reached between them, for the sake of aiding their son Cable in battle.  When Cable's effort leaves him dying, a grief-stricken Madelyne is accepted back with the X-Men again.  After Cyclops and Jean Grey are also killed, Madelyne cryptically reveals that, since the very beginning, she was always both Madelyne Pryor and a crucial portion of Jean Grey herself (and even hinted to being the [[Dark Phoenix]]).  Madelyne then sacrifices herself by turning into energy and fusing with Jean Grey, who is once again resurrected.  Jean is able to use her power to its fullest again, which allows her and all the dead X-Men to merge with the Phoenix and transcend to a new level of existence.

In the story's final panel, Madelyne's image is present next to Cyclops', among the X-Men who died heroically.

==Notes==
* A child identifying herself as "Maddy Pryor" appears in the [[Chris Claremont]]-scripted ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] [[annual publication|Annual]]'' #10 (1981). The child reappeared as Madelyne's [[mental image]] of herself in ''X-Men'' #238 (1988), wearing the same clothes as the character from ''Avengers Annual'' #10, and repeating almost the same line of dialogue (along with an [[in-joke]] about a [[Steeleye Span]] song being referenced).  No explanation has ever been given.

* Madelyne's hairstyle from her introductory appearance in 1983 (which remained unchanged until around 1988) was modeled on the hairstyle worn (in 1982) by the editor of ''Uncanny X-Men'' at that time, Louise Jones (later [[Louise Simonson]]).  (Similarly, a character was modeled on Louise Jones in [[DC Comics]]' 1971 now-classic ''[[House of Secrets]]'' #92.)  Former editor Louise Simonson would later be co-writer of the ''Inferno'' storyline, and co-creator of the Madelyne [[retcon]] and death.

* The link between Madelyne and Jean Grey was originally entirely the product of Mastermind.  Seeking to revenge himself upon the X-Men in response to what Phoenix did to him, he located a look-alike for Jean Grey and used his powers of illusion to convince the X-Men that she was Phoenix incarnate.  His intent was to have the X-Men kill her, thus murdering an innocent person.  The clone aspect of the character is a [[retcon]]; originally, Chris Claremont had conceived Madelyne as a device to write Scott Summers out of the X-Men and have him retire "happily ever after" with Madelyne and their child. It also poses several continuity problems; among which, it ignores the fact that Madelyne has parents who were shown in the comic (though they might have been adoptive parents).

==Powers and abilities==
Since Madelyne was cloned from Jean Grey's DNA, she was essentially another version of Jean, and possessed Jean's telekinetic and telepathic abilities.  As Goblin Queen, her powers were exponentially enhanced by demonic magic to the point where her telekinesis could [[Reality warper|warp reality]] in a localized area, and her telepathy could alter the minds of a population within that area. After her resurrection by X-Man (Nate Grey), Madelyne's telepathy was reduced to a much lower level, limiting her to [[Mind reading|reading minds]], communicating by broadcasting her thoughts, creating minor [[illusion]]s, changing or erasing some memory in another person, and defending herself against other telepaths. Her telekinetic abilities were also reduced, but still considerable; such that Madelyne could move, lift and manipulate fairly large objects, channel her telekinetic powers to fire powerful mental force-blasts, focus her psionic energy into a [[Force field (science fiction)|protective shield]], and levitate herself in order to fly. She also developed powers that Jean never possessed. Madelyne was able to [[teleportation|teleport]] over long distances by psychokinetically shunting herself in and out of the [[astral plane]] (and was shown to be able to carry additional weight, such as another person, when she teleported,  but her limits were never fully tested). Madelyne also discovered that she was able to siphon the psychic energies from other psionic mutants. She could then use the stolen [[psychic energy]] to boost her own powers or channel the energy into someone else (usually Nate Grey, and Cable) to temporarily increase their psionic abilities.  A few stories have also shown Madelyne able to utilize her power to greatly enhance her physical strength and agility, to the level of being a lethal hand-to-hand combatant.

==Other versions==
===Mutant X===
In the alternate reality known as the [[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]] universe, [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] was carried away into space during a plane crash (along with his father [[Corsair (comics)|Christopher]] and mother), leaving his brother [[Havok (X-Men)|Havok]] as one of the founders of the [[X-Men]]. As in the [[Earth 616|main Marvel universe]], [[Jean Grey]] died and was replaced by her clone, Madelyne.  But this reality's Madelyne fell in love with Havok and had a son, '''Scotty''', with him.  She also made a deal with S'ym and N'astirh and initiated the ''Inferno Crisis'', unlocking her latent mental abilities (becoming known as '''Marvel Woman''').  However, she survived the crisis and left with her husband when he formed the splinter group called '''The Six'''. Her evil side resurfaced a number of times, first as the '''Goblyn Queen''' (intentionally spelled with a "y", instead of the original '''i''' spelling of "Goblin Queen") and later as the "Goblyn Force".  When it returned a second time, it merged with the [[Beyonder]] to form a nigh-[[omnipotent]] being. Havok supposedly saved Madelyne by placing the ''Nexus of Realities'' in her body, purging her of the malevolent Goblyn Force and reuniting her with Scotty, before Havok returned once more to the void. 

In addition to the above-described differences, another was the way in which the Madelyne of this reality manifested the Goblyn Queen persona, transforming into a demonic appearance with red-orange skin, long horns, claws on her fingers, and a third eye in the middle of her forehead.

===Marvel Mangaverse===
In the [[Marvel Mangaverse]] title ''Legacy of Fire'', Madelyne was reinvented as Madelyne Pyre, a powerful sorceress, and possessor of the Phoenix Sword, who was training her sister Jena to be her successor.
