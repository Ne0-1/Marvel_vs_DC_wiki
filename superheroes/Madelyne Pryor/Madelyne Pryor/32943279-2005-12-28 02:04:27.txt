'''Madelyne Pryor''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. She was a [[cloning|clone]] of [[Jean Grey]], created by [[Mister Sinister]]. Although originally a supporting member of the ''X-Men'' cast for quite some time, a variety of troubles in her life (including being rejected by her husband and losing her son) eventually led to her manipulation into becoming a [[demon]]ic-powered [[supervillain]]. Chris Claremont apparently got her name from [[Maddy Prior]], lead singer of the [[folk-rock]] band [[Steeleye Span]].

==Character biography==
Madelyne's biography is complicated because of the many [[retcon|retcons]] involved.  She was originally introduced as a human love interest of [[Cyclops (comics)|Scott Summers]] with a few mysterious traits: she had survived a fatal airplane crash on the same day [[Phoenix (comics)|Phoenix]] died on the moon, and [[Professor X]] was unable to scan her mind (which, he said, was occasionally possible among normal humans).  After a series of events involving [[Mastermind (comics)|Mastermind]] (who wanted revenge for Jean Grey driving him insane) and his telepathic illusions, Madelyne married Scott, and he soon decided to retire from the [[X-Men]].

Madelyne gave birth to a child, named Nathan Christoper Charles Summers. Although Scott tried to live a normal life, he received a call from his former teammate [[Archangel (comics)|Angel]] that Jean Grey had been found, alive. He abandoned Madelyne and his son, who were attacked by Mr. Sinister's Marauders, and Nathan was taken away. Madelyne was hospitalized, but Sinister had erased all her records.

Madelyne called the X-Men, and they arrived just as the Marauders did, and fought them off. She stayed with the X-Men as they fought the [[Adversary (comics)|Adversary]], and sacrified their lives to stop him. Resurrected by the [[goddess]] Roma, the X-Men worked secretly out of an abandoned [[Reavers (comics)|Reaver]] base in [[Australia]].

The demon S'ym later came to Madelyne in her dreams and offered her the power to hurt Scott just as he had hurt her, and she accepted. She then struck a bargain with another demon, N'astirh, to find her missing baby, the demons activated her latent powers and she became the Goblyn Queen. This started the "[[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]]" [[fictional crossover|crossover]].

This crossover retconned in a new origin for Madelyne.  In this origin, Mr. Sinister, believing that a child of Scott Summers and Jean Grey would have great powers, had created a clone of Jean specifically to fall in love with Scott and produce a child.  When Phoenix committed suicide, a part of the Phoenix Force entered the clone and gave it life. Sinister named the clone Madelyne Pryor, created a false background, and sent her to [[Alaska]], where she fell in love with Scott Summers.  The new origin, in which Madelyne was a clone of a mutant, apparently contradicted the earlier ''X-Men/Alpha Flight'' miniseries; in it, Madelyne had gained temporary powers from [[Loki (comics)|Loki's]] firefountain, which only gave powers to non-mutants.

N'astirh took Madelyne to an orphanage in [[Nebraska]], the front for Sinister's genetic laboratory. Sinister captured her and told her all about her creation and her intended goal. She used her black magic to escape, and N'astirh brought her son, intending to sacrifice him to ensure a permanent demonic presence on Earth.

She pitted [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] against the X-Men by reverting to Madelyne and claiming that Scott wanted to take their baby away. The teams defeated N'astirh, but Madelyne, becoming suicidal upon the discovery of being a clone, trapped herself and Jean Grey in a telepathic bubble, then killed herself and tried to telepathically take Jean with her. Jean survived by re-integrating the portions of her essence absorbed by the Phoenix Force and by Madelyne. 

Her son was retconned into being the time-travelling soldier of fortune [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], who had already been appearing in comics for some time by then.

Madelyne mysteriously re-appeared in ''[[X-Man]]'' #5 (July 1995) with little memory of her past. Under the tutelage of [[Selene (comics)|Selene]], this new Madelyne served as [[The Hellfire Club (comics)|the Hellfire Club's]] Black Rook, gradually learning more of her previous life. ''X-Man'' #25 (March 1997) revealed that "Madelyne" was in fact a psychic construct, unconsciously formed by the mind of [[X-Man|Nate "X-Man" Grey]]; however, unlike other psychic constructs, he was unable to uncreate her.

After apparently aging in ''X-Man'' #52 from loss of energy and appearing as a psychic ghost in ''Cable'' #76, she did not appear again until much later in ''X-Man'' #67.  It was soon revealed that Madelyne was an impostor, a parallel universe Jean Grey.  The then-current writer Steven Grant (who did not write Madelyne's earlier appearances in the series) has said that he intended that Madelyne had been an impostor for the duration of the entire ''X-Man'' series (which would be a retcon).  The in-story evidence is more ambiguous; at one time the impostor implies that Madelyne was fake all along, but at another time she claims she "replaced your Maddie several months ago," implying that only some of Madelyne's appearances (probably #67-up) were fake.

She has also appeared in certain alternate realities, such as the series '''[[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]]'''.

A child identifying herself as "Maddy Pryor" appears in the [[Chris Claremont]]-scripted ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] [[annual publication|Annual]]'' #10.  It appeared that Claremont had named her after the singer too and there was no in-story connection, but the child reappeared as Madelyne's mental image of herself in ''X-Men'' #238, wearing the same clothes as the character from ''Avengers Annual'' #10 and saying almost the same line.  This was never elaborated upon and is likely just an extended in-joke.
