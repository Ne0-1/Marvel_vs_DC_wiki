In the [[fictional]] [[Marvel Universe]], '''Michael Korvac''', aka simply '''Korvac''', was a [[cyborg]] from the 31st century, having fled from battle with [[Thor]] and the [[Guardians of the Galaxy]]. Upon his arrival in our time, he discovered a space station that had once been used by [[Galactus]], the devourer of worlds. Attempting to download the knowledge of Galactus from the station onto his own system, Korvac somehow became imbued with the Power Cosmic and became a god-like being. He then travelled straight to Earth, hoping to make it into his own personal utopia.

The Elder known as the Collector had forseen the coming of two beings that would be capable of challenging the Elders (Korvac and Thanos), so he remade his own daughter Carina into a being of incredible power to use as a weapon against them. Sending her to Korvac, now calling himself Michael, in New York to be his wife, the Collector's plans fell apart when he was defeated by the [[Avengers_%28comics%29|Avengers]]. Just as he was about to reveal Michael's true identity, Korvac learned the truth from Carina and blasted him into nothingness with the Power Cosmic.

Tracking Michael/Korvac back to New York, the Avengers fought him in battle. Realising that his existence was now evident to the other deities of the universe, Korvac angrily returned their assault in full. He managed to kill many of them, claiming that only [[Captain America]] had truly harmed him, but was himself struck down by a repeated attack by all of those who yet lived. His furious wife murdered his killers before being killed in turn by [[Thor_%28Marvel_Comics%29|Thor]]. 

Only [[Moondragon]] knew the truth. Korvac never wanted anyone to die; he only wished to build a better world for the human race and revealed that with his last ounce of power he had returned life to the beaten Avengers. Manipulating the memories of all those present, Moondragon left Thor's alter ego, Dr. Don Blake, to heal his fallen comrades before disappearing herself for a time, haunted by the memory of what the Avengers had done.

When the story was first collected into a [[trade paperback]], ''Avengers: The Korvac Saga'' in 1991, a new epilogue was added, showing the Avengers at Korvac's grave declaring that even if Korvac's intentions had been good, the resulting universal order under his control would have been tryannical. This epilogue, drawn by [[Sal Buscema]], was written by [[Mark Gruenwald]] to make the saga's ending less ambiguous. When the trade paperback was reprinted in 2003 (as ''Avengers Legends #2: The Korvac Saga''), editor [[Tom Brevoort]] felt that the epilogue was both unncessary and invalidated the preceding storyline, and so removed it from the reprinting.
