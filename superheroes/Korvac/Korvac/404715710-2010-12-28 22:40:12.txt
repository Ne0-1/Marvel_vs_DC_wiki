'''Michael Korvac''' (also called '''Korvac''') is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appears in ''Giant-Size [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]'' #3 (Jan. 1975) and was created by [[Steve Gerber]] and [[Jim Starlin]]. 

==Publication history==
Korvac debuted in ''Giant-Size [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]'' #3 (1975), and according to creator Gerber: "The character really was a throwaway, created for one story.  And I never intended to bring him back, because, among other things, I hated the name! I still think it sounds more like a [[vacuum cleaner]] than a villain." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://groups.yahoo.com/group/howard_the_duck/message/3389 |title=members only.

Korvac reappeared in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] Annual'' #6 (1977), with the story a prelude to the "Korvac Saga" in ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #159, #167 - 168, #170 - 177 (Jan. - Nov. 1978). The ten issues were written by [[Jim Shooter]] and [[David Michelinie]], with art by [[George PÃ©rez]] and [[David Wenzel]]. 

A [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] edition reprinted the Korvac saga in 1991, and included a new [[epilogue]] written by [[Mark Gruenwald]] and drawn by [[Tom Morgan (artist)|Tom Morgan]]. Although the revised conclusion  cast Korvac as a villain, it was removed by editor [[Tom Brevoort]] when reprinted as ''Avengers Legends Volume 2: The Korvac Saga'' in 2003.

Korvac reappeared briefly in ''Avengers'' Annual #16 (1987). He is heavily referenced in a 1991 summer annual crossover storyline: ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' Annual #24 (1991); ''Thor'' Annual #16 (1991); ''[[Silver Surfer]]'' Annual #4 (1991) and ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' Annual #1 (1991). The character returned for his last appearance so far in ''[[Captain America]]'' Vol. 3, #17 - 19 (May - July 1999). 

Korvac also appeared in both volumes of the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] title ''[[What If (comics)|What If?]]'', in issues #32 (April 1982) and vol. 2, issue #36 (April 1992).

==Fictional character biography==
Michael Korvac is a computer technician in the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] [[Earth-691]]. <ref>''The Official Handbook to the Marvel Universe: Alternate Worlds'' 2005</ref>  When the [[Sol System]] and its colonies are conquered by the [[Extraterrestrial life|Alien]] [[Badoon|Brotherhood of Badoon]], Korvac becomes a collaborator and traitor to the human race. Caught asleep at a machine while working, the Badoon as punishment graft Korvac's upper body to a machine, effectively making him a [[cyborg]].

Korvac is then transported through time by the [[Elder of the Universe]] the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]], who utilizes him as a pawn in battling the hero [[Doctor Strange]] and the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].<ref>''Giant-Size Defenders'' #3 (Jan. 1975)</ref> 

It is eventually revealed that Korvac deliberately lost the fight so as to be able to discreetly scan and analyze the Grandmaster's cosmic power. Gaining several new abilities from this analysis, Korvac then kills his Badoon masters and plans to conquer the cosmos. Korvac recruits a group of aliens called the "Minions of Menace" and attempts to cause Earth's sun to go [[nova]], but is defeated by the [[Guardians of the Galaxy]] and the time-traveling Thunder God [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].<ref>''Thor'' Annual #6 (1977)</ref> 

Korvac flees across time and space to the [[Earth-616]] universe. Upon arrival, Korvac discovers the space station of the entity [[Galactus]].  While attempting to download the knowledge of Galactus from the station into his own system, Korvac is imbued with the [[Power Cosmic]] and becomes god-like.  Korvac then recreates himself as a perfect humanoid form, and posing as a human called "Michael", travels to Earth with the intent of reshaping it into a [[utopia]]. Korvac, however, is pursued by the Guardians of the Galaxy, who join forces with the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in a bid to stop the villain. 

Guardian member [[Starhawk (comics)|Starhawk]] finds Korvac and battles him in secret. Korvac, however, disintegrates Starhawk and then recreates him, but removes from the hero the ability to perceive Korvac in any way so as to avoid future detection. The Elder of the Universe known as the [[Collector (comics)|Collector]] foresees the coming of two beings that would be capable of challenging the Elders (Korvac and [[Eternal (comics)|Eternal]]), and remakes his own daughter Carina into a being of incredible power to use as a weapon against them.  Although Carina does meet Korvac, the two fall in love and she begins to sympathize with him. The Collector is defeated by the Avengers after a failed bid to "collect" and protect the heroes from Korvac, who upon discovering the Collector's plot disintegrates the Elder.

[[Iron Man]] eventually tracks Korvac to a residential neighborhood in [[Forest Hills Gardens, Queens|Forest Hills Gardens]], in [[Queens]], [[New York]]. The entire Avengers roster, aided by the heroine [[Ms. Marvel]] and the Guardians of the Galaxy, confront Korvac and Carina, who pose as a middle class couple.  Korvac's deception is revealed when [[Starhawk (comics)|Starhawk]] states he cannot see the man called "Michael". Realizing that he has been discovered, and that [[cosmic entities (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entities]] such as [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]] and the [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]] are now aware of his existence, Korvac is forced into battle. 

Korvac slays wave after wave of heroes, and is finally caught off guard and weakened by [[Captain America]] and [[Wonder Man]]. Although able to kill the heroes, Korvac is weakened further by the combined efforts of Starhawk, Iron Man, the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] and [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. Sensing that Carina now doubts him, Korvac commits suicide through an act of will. An angered Carina then attacks the surviving heroes, and is finally slain by Thor. The entire battle is watched by part-time Avenger [[Moondragon]], who realizes that Korvac only wanted to help mankind, with his dying act being to restore the Avengers and Guardians to life.<ref>''Avengers'' #167 - 177 (Jan. - Nov. 1978)</ref>

It is revealed that Korvac discarded his power when near death after sensing that Galactus had activated the weapon the [[Ultimate Nullifier]] in retaliation for his previous intrusion. Korvac's power eventually inhabits his father, Jordan, who is then killed in battle with the Guardians. This is the catalyst that drives Korvac as an adult to hate the Guardians. <ref>''Fantastic Four'' Annual #24; ''Thor'' Annual #16; ''Silver Surfer'' Annual #4 and ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' Annual #1 (all 1991)</ref>

Korvac is briefly resurrected in human form by the Grandmaster to battle the [[Silver Surfer]].<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #16 (1987)</ref> When master villain the [[Red Skull]] and Captain America battle for possession of a [[Cosmic Cube]] in Korvac's, the Cube is used to scatter Korvac across six dimensions.<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 3, #18 (June 1998)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Korvac was originally a normal man until the [[Badoon]] amputated the lower half of his body, and grafted his upper body and nervous system onto a specialized computer module capable of siphoning energy from virtually any source. Korvac's mechanical module could also tap and synthesize any form of energy and concealed advanced weaponry. 

After downloading information from Galactus' ship and acquiring the [[Power Cosmic]], Korvac is capable of energy projection; matter alteration; [[teleport]]ation and manipulation of time and space. In his perfect human form, Korvac retained all his cosmic abilities and could use these to achieve virtually any effect. 

Michael Korvac is also a brilliant computer scientist; a master strategist and formidable hand-to-hand combatant.
