'''Michael Korvac''' (or simply '''Korvac''') is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[supervillain]] originally from the [[Earth-691]] [[Marvel Universe]]. The character first appears in ''Giant-Size [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]'' #3 (January 1975) and was created by [[Steve Gerber]]. He has also been called the '''Machine Man''', the '''Machine God''', and the '''Clockwork Lord'''.

==Publication history==
Korvac first appears in ''Giant-Size [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]'' #3 (1975) as a pawn of the cosmic entity the [[Grandmaster (comics)|Grandmaster]]. According to Gerber: {{cquote|The character really was a throwaway, created for one story.  And I never intended to bring him back, because, among other things, I hated the name! I still think it sounds more like a [[vacuum cleaner]] than a villain. <ref>http://groups.yahoo.com/group/howard_the_duck/message/3389 - members only; accessed 11 October 2006</ref>}}

While the story maintains that it is in fact the 31st century, it is established years later that it is fact the future of the alternate dimension Earth-691. <ref>''The Official Handbook to the Marvel Universe: Alternate Worlds'' 2005</ref>

In 1977, Korvac reappears in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|The Mighty Thor]] Annual'' #6, written by [[Roger Stern]] and art by [[Sal Buscema]]. This story acts as a prelude to the "Korvac Saga", which was published across 1977-1978 in Avengers vol. 1, #167 - 177. The story arc was written by [[Jim Shooter]] and [[David Michelinie]], with art by [[George Perez]] and David Wenzel.

In 1987, Korvac made a brief reappearance in ''Avengers'' Annual #16 as one of the Grandmaster's Legion of the Unliving.

In 1991, when the Korvac Saga was first collected into [[trade paperback]] format, a new epilogue was added. The epilogue showed the Avengers at Korvac's grave, declaring that even if Korvac's intentions had been good, the resulting universal order under his control would have been tyrannical.  This epilogue was written by [[Mark Gruenwald]] and drawn by [[Tom Morgan (artist)|Tom Morgan]] to make the story's ending less ambiguous.  When the trade paperback was reprinted in 2003 - as ''Avengers Legends Volume 2: The Korvac Saga'' - editor [[Tom Brevoort]] had the epilogue removed as it was deemed unnecessary.

In 1991, a storyline featuring Korvac's power ran through ''[[Fantastic Four]] Annual'' #24;
''Thor Annual'' #16; ''[[Silver Surfer]] Annual'' #4 and ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' Annual #1. The power discarded by Korvac on his death inhabits his father, Jordan, who is then killed in battle with the Guardians.  

In 1997, Korvac also appeared in a storyline in ''Captain America'' vol. 3, #18. While the story is set in the present, it may have occurred for Korvac prior to the events of Avengers vol. 1 #167 - 177.

There were also two appearances that are not part of regular Marvel continuity. In 1982 Korvac featured in ''[[What If (comics)|What If?]]'' vol.1, #32 which outlined what would have happened to the universe had Korvac been successful.  In 1992, ''What If?'' vol. 1, #36 featured Korvac arriving in a different timeline and eventually battling the Cosmic Avengers in the year 2130.

==Fictional character biography==
Michael Korvac was a computer technician born on an alternate Earth in the year 2997. Due to events surrounding his birth, Michael's father was killed and he was raised by his mother to have a hateful and vengeful attitude.  When the [[Sol System]] and its colonies were conquered by the alien [[Badoon|Brotherhood of Badoon]], Korvac became a collaborator and traitor to the human race. Caught asleep at a machine while working, the Badoon grafted Korvac's upper body to a machine, effectively making him a [[cyborg]].

Korvac is then transported through time by the game-playing [[Grandmaster]], and battles the hero [[Doctor Strange]]. <ref>''Giant-Size Defenders'' #3 (1975)</ref> Korvac deliberately loses the fight, so as to be able to discretely scan and analyze the Grandmaster's cosmic power. <ref>Seen in flashback in ''Thor'' Annual #6 (1977)</ref> Gaining several new abilities from this analysis, Korvac then kills his Badoon masters and plans to conquer the cosmos, but is defeated by the Guardians of the Galaxy and the time-traveling Thunder God Thor. <ref>''Thor'' Annual #6 (1977)</ref> Soon after this defeat Korvac flees across time and space to the [[Earth-616]] mainstream Marvel universe. Upon arrival, Korvac discovers the space station of the cosmic entity [[Galactus]].  Attempting to download the knowledge of Galactus from the station into his own system, Korvac is imbued with the [[Power Cosmic]] and becomes a god-like being.  Korvac then recreates himself as a perfect humanoid form, and posing as an human called Michael, travels to Earth with the intent of reshaping it into a [[utopia]]. <ref>Seen in flashback in ''Avengers'' vol. 1, #175</ref>

Korvac is pursued by the team the [[Guardians of the Galaxy]], who join forces with the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in a bid to stop Korvac. Guardian member [[Starhawk]] finds Korvac and battles him in secret. Korvac, however, disintegrates Starhawk and then recreates him, but removes from the hero the ability to perceive Korvac in any way so as to avoid future detection. <ref>''Avengers'' vol. 1, #168</ref> The [[Elders of the Universe|Elder of the Universe]] known as [[Collector (comics)|the Collector]] foresees the coming of two beings that would be capable of challenging the Elders (Korvac and Titan [[Thanos]]), and remakes his own daughter [[Carina (comics)|Carina]] into a being of incredible power to use as a weapon against them.  Although Carina does meet Korvac, the two fall in love and she begins to sympathize with him. The Collector himself is defeated by the Avengers after a failed bid to "collect" and protect them from Korvac, who upon discovering the Collector's plot disintegrates the Elder. <ref>''Avengers'' vol. 1, #168 - 175</ref>

The hero [[Iron Man]] eventually tracks Korvac to a residential neighborhood in [[Forest Hills Gardens]]. The entire Avengers roster, with the heroine [[Ms. Marvel]] and the Guardians of the Galaxy confront Korvac and Carina, who pose as a middle class couple.  Korvac's deception is revealed when [[Starhawk (comics)|Starhawk]] states he cannot see the man called "Michael". Realizing that he has been discovered, and that [[cosmic entities (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entities]] such as [[Odin (comics)|Odin]] and the [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]] are now aware of his existence, Korvac is forced into battle. 

Korvac slays wave after wave of heroes, and is finally caught off guard and weakened by [[Captain America]] and then [[Wonder Man]]. Although able to kill the heroes, Korvac is weakened further by the combined efforts of Starhawk, Iron Man, the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] and [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. Sensing that Carina now doubts him, Korvac dies. An angered Carina then attacks the surviving heroes, and is finally slain by Thor. The entire battle is watched by part-time Avenger [[Moondragon]], who realizes that Korvac only wanted to help mankind, with his dying act being to restore the Avengers and Guardians to life. <ref>''Avengers'' vol. 1, #176 - 177</ref>

Years later, it is revealed that Korvac discarded his power upon his death and that it inhabits his father, Jordan, who is then killed in battle with the Guardians. This is the catalyst that drives Korvac as an adult to hate the Guardians. <ref>''Fantastic Four Annual'' #24;
''Thor Annual'' #16; ''Silver Surfer Annual'' #4 and ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' Annual #1. </ref> 

Korvac, in his cyborg form, briefly battles Captain America and the villain the [[Red Skull]] in the 31st century. Korvac is scattered across six dimensions by the Red Skull, who is in possession of a [[Cosmic Cube]]. <ref>''Captain America'' vol. 3, #18</ref>

==Powers and Abilities==
Korvac was originally a normal man until his upper body and nervous system were grafted onto a specialized computer module capable of siphoning energy from virtually any source.
After downloading information from Galactus' ship and acquiring the [[Power Cosmic]], Korvac was capable of many feats on par with other cosmic entities, such as matter alteration; teleportation; massive energy projection and manipulation of time and space.
