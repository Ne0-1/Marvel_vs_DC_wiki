'''Chase Stein''' is a [[comic book]] character in the ongoing series ''[[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]]'', published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Character History==

Chase Stein is the son of mad scientists [[Pride (comics)|Victor and Janet Stein]]. The two supposedly made a fortune from inventing a tool that removes stickers from CDs, but were actually members of the secret group of super villains called [[Pride (comics)|The Pride]]. Victor often physically abused Chase for talking back and for getting poor grades in school. 

Chase often comes across as being a dumb, obnoxious jock, but he is surprisingly street smart.  Before learning that his parents were members of The Pride, Chase wanted to be an announcer for [[ESPN]], but after his experiences with the [[Runaways_(comics)|Runaways]] he decides that he wants to join the [[FBI]] to help other troubled teens like themselves (with the added perk of carrying a gun all the time.) 

He receives his codename "'''Talkback'''" from Gertrude's sarcastic remark (he wanted to be called "[[Neo (Matrix)|Neo]]") and for his habit of talking back. The only Runaway with a driver's license, Chase transports the team in his white van. He uses equipment stolen from his parents: "weaponized" gloves called ''Fistigons'' and multi-spectral goggles, but the gauntlets are destroyed in the final battle with the Pride. Chase was the one who originally found the Runaways' first hideout, a "missing [[mansion]]" which was swallowed up during an earthquake in the [[1920]]s or [[1930]]s that he nicknamed "The [[Hostel]]".

When the Runaways sneak into the under-sea lair of The Pride in an effort to stop their parents from presenting an offering to the [[Gibborim]], the teens are attacked by the hideout's security system: a giant stone golem. During the ensuing battle, Chase nearly drowns and is given [[CPR]] by [[Gertrude Yorkes]]. He shows his gratitude by kissing her, and calls her "the hottest chick [he's] ever seen."  As he is too weak to continue on to face The Pride, Chase offers the Fistigons and goggles to [[Alex Wilder]], who later betrays them all. Chase saves the team from certain death by hotwiring the transport ship his parents designed, the ''Leapfrog'', and getting them out of the Gibborim's lair before it explodes.

When the Runaways are split up by Social Services, Chase tells the authorities that he is going to go and live with an Aunt in [[Anaheim]], but instead gives them a false address and runs away again. Later, when the rest of the Runaways leave their foster homes to meet each other, Chase turns up by surprise and leads the teens off to release Gert's raptor, Old Lace, from an Avengers storage complex. After succeeding, the kids decide to stay together rather than return to their foster homes and move off to their new lives in the ''Leapfrog''.

With the Fistigons now gone, Chase helps the team by piloting the ''Leapfrog'', which serves as their getaway vehicle (as opposed to most vessels, which are designated "she," Chase has specifically designated the Leapfrog a male vessel, as the team had "more than enough [[estrogen]]"). Chase uses the Leapfrog's lasers, which he has only just discovered, to attack [[Excelsior (comics)|Excelsior]]. Chase now knows how to fix ''The Leapfrog'' after it was shot down by a blast from Darkhawk's amulet. He has also recently discovered that the "Frog" can talk, and it calls him "Master" to Chase's delight.

Chase and Gert have been dating ever since they were reunited, and love each other despite their differences. They have become physically intimate, judging by Chase's teasing suggestion to give Gert the codename "[[fellatio|Power Vacuum]]."

The Runaways have a shocking encounter with Gert's older self, who travels from 20 years in the future to tell the Runaways about [[Victor Mancha]], a boy who will grow up to be a deadly super-villain. Suffering from internal injuries sustained in a battle with "Victorious," the older Gert confesses her love for Chase before dying in his arms. Visibly shaken, Chase vows to "tear [Victor's] damn heart out."

However, the present-day Victor is an innocent young man, and a battle with [[Ultron]] leaves him an orphan. He joins the Runaways despite Chase's clear animosity towards him. Chase is also concerned that Gert may be infatuated with Victor, who is more her intellectual equal. Though Gert assures him that she only loves him, Chase remains leery of Victor's place among them.
