==Fictional character biography==
===The Pride===
The son of Victor and Janet Stein, Chase is first seen taking a punch from his abusive father for getting straight C's and being a "dumb athlete"; after the witnessing of the murder of an innocent girl by their parents ("the Pride"), Chase appears not to be surprised, though blames everyone else's parents for the murder.<ref name="Vol1#2">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #2</ref> Chase joins the team in the mass ransack to escape from their respective homes. While going through Chase's parents homes, he discovers that his parents are mad scientists, with many technological advances.<ref name="Vol1#2"/> Chase steals the Fistigons, which Janet Stein calls "the world's strongest gloves".<ref name="Vol1#7">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #7</ref> Able to conjure and mold fire with the gloves, Chase also steals the special x-ray goggles from his parents.<ref name="Vol1#4">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #4</ref> The Fistigons are later destroyed, giving Chase the role of "getaway guy".<ref name="Vol1#13">''References'': Volume 1, #13</ref> Chase provides the Runaways with their first hideout, a dilapidated caved-in mansion he called "the Hostel," and their first transport, his white, unmarked van with stolen license plates.<ref name="Vol1#3">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #3</ref><ref name="Vol1#4">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #4</ref> After running off, Chase wishes to take the name [[Neo (Matrix)|Neo]], but Gert calls him Talkback, a reference to his defiant nature.<ref name="Vol1#6">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #6</ref> It is later revealed Janet's pregnancy with Chase prompted the remaining Pride to have kids, and to give them eternal life in continuing the Pride.<ref name="Vol1#13"/>

===Personality===
When Chase first confronts his parents (in their scientific villain-attire), Chase remains defiant and unafraid of his parents, firmly establishing himself as the most rebellious and reckless of the group, a trait he carries for the rest of [[Brian K. Vaughan]]'s initial run on the title.<ref name="Vol1#5">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #5</ref> Chase is portrayed as having a free, reckless spirit, shown when he purposely repeatedly crashes the [[Leapfrog (comics)|Leapfrog]].<ref name="Vol1#13"/>

{{cquote2|Mr. Stein: You think straight C's are funny Chase? You're becoming a dumb jock. Is that what you want to be, a cliché?<br> Chase: Well, you're a nerd who punches like a girl, isn't that a cliché?|Chase displays his defiant nature in his first appearance.<ref name="Vol1#1"/>}}

Chase is known for having an angry temper;<ref name="CivilWar">''Civil War: Runaways/Young Avengers''</ref> after the death of Gert, Chase departs the team for a time, with the intention of resurrecting Gert in exchange for selling his own life.<ref name="Vol2#23">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #23</ref> The search for Victor Mancha ends up being personal for him, to kill the one person who'd be destined to murder Gert.<ref name="Vol2#1">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #1</ref> Chase also mentions he had murdered someone in the past, and refuses to talk about it.<ref name="Vol2#14">''Runaways: Volume 2, #14</ref> An associate to the [[Kingpin]] describes him as being simple, despite his scientific pedigree.<ref name="Vol2#25">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #25</ref>

Chase seems to be a devout Christian - when attacked by Old Lace, he recites [[The Lord's Prayer]], and he later refers to The Devil as a real being. He also called Karolina an angel after her alien origins are revealed. After Gert's death Nico mentions to Victor that Chase may have adopted Gert's agnostic beliefs.

===As a fugitive===
Since the Fistigons and x-ray goggles were destroyed, Chase resumes his "getaway guy" role as the [[Leapfrog (comics)|Leapfrog]] pilot in the second volume.<ref name="Vol2#1">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #1</ref> In a relationship with Gert, Chase is able to comfort Nico over the loss of Karolina;<ref name="Vol2#1"/> two issues later, Nico kisses him, straining their relationship.<ref name="Vol2#1"/> When a new incarnation of the Pride reveals Chase and Nico's kiss to Gert, she ends up hurt, angered, and the resulting friction almost tears the Runaways apart and seriously wears on Chase, but the group reconciles in time to rescue Molly. After Gert's death, Chase departs the Runaways for a short period, but he is convinced to return, after turning eighteen.<ref name="Vol2#25"/> Chase strikes a deal with the Gibborim to exchange one innocent soul for Gert's life and eventually settles on sacrificing himself, viewing his life as worthless compared to Gert's. This deal fails to please the Gibborim, as going through removed Chase's 'innocent' status.<ref name="Vol2#23"/> Chase is saved from making a dire mistake, and is gratefully allowed to return after learning that his grief nearly destroyed all his friends.<ref name="Vol2#23"/>

===Homecoming===
In ''Runaways'' Vol. 3 #7, the Runaways pay little attention to Chase's opinions, prompting Chase to question his role on the team. In ''Runaways'' Vol. 3 #9, the last issue to have been written by [[Terry Moore (comics)|Terry Moore]], features Chase acting as an older brother to Molly and Klara. Moore had wanted this storyline to heavily focus on Chase's relationship with the team,<ref name="revitalize">{{cite news | author = Vaneta Rogers | title = Humberto Ramos: Revitalizing Runaways | publisher = [[Newsarama]] | date = 2008-08-25 | url = http://www.newsarama.com/comics/080825-RamosRunaways.html | accessdate=2008-09-18}}</ref> and identifies him as "a kid who "will grow up to become the next [[Captain America]]."<ref name="revitalize"/>

In ''Runaways'' Vol. 3 #11, the first issue written by [[Kathryn Immonen]] and drawn by [[Sara Pichelli]], Chase, Nico, Victor and Karolina hold a house prom. A outside source manages to send a [[Unmanned_aerial_vehicle|UAV]] flying into the Runaways' Malibu home, in the upstairs living room where Klara and Old Lace lie. Nico, Victor and Karolina rush to save Klara and Old Lace - upon arriving at the top, however, it's revealed that Old Lace had shielded Klara, who ends up alive. Old Lace, however, dies. Chase, feeling her death because of their link, falls into a slump and repeatedly mutters an apology for Gert.<ref>''Runaways'' #11''</ref> In ''Runaways'' Vol. 3 #12 Chase encounters a man claiming to be his (paternal) uncle Hunter Stein. Chase believes the man is lying because he remembers killing his uncle and driving off. Not long thereafter, Chase makes the error of following a girl resembling Gertrude, and is hit by a car, ending up in hospital. However, he is shown in S.W.O.R.D. #2 alive and well with the group in Los Angeles.

When [[Daken]], the psychopathic son of [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] invades the Runaways' home, Chase knocks him out with his gloves.<ref>''Daken: Dark Wolverine'' #17</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
[[Image:Literal Firewall.jpg|left|thumb|210px|Chase makes a very literal firewall in ''Runaways'' volume 1, issue 14.<br> Art by [[Adrian Alphona]].]]

===Weapons===
In the first volume, Chase stole telescopic [[x-ray]] goggles and the Fistigons from his parents' secret laboratory.<ref name="Vol1#4"/> The x-ray goggles allowed Chase to see through clothing, walls, and even through miles of rock.<ref>When the old Hostel caves in, Chase uses the goggles to tell Molly which way to break them out.</ref>  The Fistigons were metal gauntlets with built-in flamethrowers. The gloves allowed the wearer to mentally shape the produced flame into any form the wearer desired.<ref name="Vol1#4"/> Before the final fight with their parents, Chase nearly drowned and was too weak to go on. He gave the Fistigons and x-ray goggles to Alex, who subsequently betrayed the team to their parents. Nico used the [[Nico Minoru#The Staff of One|Staff of One]] to magically destroy the gauntlets while he was still wearing them,<ref name="Vol1#17">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #17</ref> and the x-ray goggles were incinerated with Alex by the Gibborim.<ref name="Vol2#23"/> Chase has been known to use the [[Leapfrog (comics)|Leapfrog]] (a frog-like land & sea transport designed by his parents, but mother's idea.<ref name="Vol2#25"/>) and a switchblade.<ref name="Vol1#18">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #18</ref> 

Before Gert's death, she transferred telepathic control of [[Old Lace (comics)|Old Lace]] to Chase.<ref name="Vol2#18">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #18</ref> He now shares an empathic link with the dinosaur, so both suffer from one another's injuries and benefit when the other heals. Chase and Old Lace's minds are also directly connected so the dinosaur can telepathically communicate thoughts and feelings to her master.<ref name="Vol2#18"/> Old Lace is engineered to follow Chase's every mental command though she can express dissatisfaction; to date, Old Lace has directly disobeyed only one of Chase's orders and was able to only with Karolina's help.<ref name="Vol2#23"/> Chase has also used Nico's Staff of One against Nico.<ref name="Vol2#23"/> Chase uses a time machine later in the series to travel through time. He returns shortly afterward with newly built Fistigons of his own design; to protect the team from the Yorkes' by conjuring fire and electricity to defeat them. And then protects the [[Leapfrog (comics)|Leapfrog]] from a barrage of missiles by using the Fistigons to shoot out missiles of their own.<ref name="Vol2#30">''Runaways'': Volume 2, #30</ref> In addition it was revealed that most of his father's devices are protected against magic, though obviously the first pair weren't. In promotional art for upcoming ''Runaways'' issues, Chase is shown with a pair of rocket boots. In ''Runaways'' v3 #5, he calls them "the Footstigons".

==Relationship with other Runaways==
===Gert===
{{main|Gertrude Yorkes}}
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:GertandChase.jpg|thumb|230px|left|Chase and Gert share their first kiss.<ref name="Vol1#16">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #16</ref>]] -->
Gert dated Chase from ''Runaways'' volume 1, issue 16 to ''Runaways'' volume 2, issue 18.<ref name="Vol1#16">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #16</ref> Their relationship was often defined by bickering - Chase's dim-witted moments often clashed with Gert's sarcastic and intelligent quips. Gert's relationship with Chase softened her somewhat, though she didn't entirely lose her sarcastic edge. Their relationship developed quickly, with a few off-hand comments suggesting that they shared the same bed and were sexually intimate.<ref>In Vol.2, Gert makes a sly suggestion that gets a reminder that Molly is in the room.</ref> However, their relationship was threatened when Gert learned that Nico had kissed Chase; though Chase rebuffed Nico's advances, Gert was still hurt that Chase had kept the interaction hidden from her. She revealed her insecurity about her appearance and fear that Chase would eventually leave her for a more conventionally pretty girl.<ref name="ComicVine"/> Though implying she was hurt beyond reconciliation, she still ran into a burning building to save Chase from [[Geoffrey Wilder]] after their falling out.<ref name="ComicVine"/> She bluffed some details about Chase's past to keep Geoffrey from sacrificing Chase and Geoffrey fell for the bluff, but plunged his dagger into Gert's stomach instead.<ref name="ComicVine"/> As she lay dying, she transferred control of Old Lace to Chase and died forgiving Chase for Nico's kiss and without finishing saying she loved him.<ref name="ComicVine"/>

===Molly===
{{main|Molly Hayes}}
Ever since the beginning of the series, Molly and Chase engage in a big brother/little sister relationship: they bicker, call each other names, and joke around.<ref name="Vol1#7">''Runaways'': Volume 1, #7</ref> Chase had always stood up to protect Molly.<ref name="Vol2">''Runaways'': Volume 2</ref> After Gert's death, Chase's relationship with Molly turns into one of pure anger, prompting Chase to say in ''Civil War: Young Avengers/Runaways'' "Molly why don't you $&!?ing grow up?!"<ref name="CivilWar">''Civil War'': Young Avengers, Runaways''</ref> Their relationship is repaired by the end of the [[story arc]] when Chase expresses jealousy over Molly's growing attachment to the Young Avenger [[Speed (comics)|Speed]], who tells him at the end of the story that no matter what, Molly looks up to him.<ref name="CivilWar"/>

===Nico===
{{main|Nico Minoru}}
Nico provides the motherly and leadership foil for Chase's rule-breaking persona.  The pair maintain a strong respect for each other despite often disagreeing over major group decisions, including Gert's burial site and allowing [[Victor Mancha]] to join the team.  Chase cares for Nico's safety and well-being, as evidenced from when he comforted Nico after Karolina's departure and later when he took the Staff of One from Nico to destroy it (along with himself) and give her a normal life.  Nico and Chase shared a kiss after Chase bluffed their way out of a potentially fatal encounter with inter-dimensional drug lord Pusher Man and managed to get a customer's name from the drug lord.  Chase rejected the kiss but did not make a huge deal of it, even though Nico treated him more as an employee instead of a friend after the incident.  After Gert's death, Chase and Nico's friendship strained as he allowed anger and grief to isolate him (both physically and emotionally) from the group's support.  Nico was also the only person that Chase bid farewell before leaving to sacrifice himself for the Gibborim, which Nico interpreted as a cry for help, and is presumably a signal of the level of trust and respect Chase holds for Nico.  In [[Joss Whedon|Joss Whedon's]] current stint on ''Runaways'' , Chase and Nico's friendship appears more stable now that Chase seems to have moved past grieving for Gert.

===Victor Mancha===
{{main|Victor Mancha}}
Victor's alternate future self, Victorious, managed to fatally wound an [[Gertrude Yorkes#Heroine|alternate version of Gert]] before she came to the past and warned the Runaways of the looming threat; the future Gert died in Chase's arms.  Her death made locating Victor personal for Chase, as he sought to prevent his current girlfriend's murder.  He disagreed vehemently with Nico about letting Victor stay with the team, even after Nico stated she was prepared to kill Victor if necessary.  As such, Chase has tried to distance himself from Victor, despite the cyborg's attempts to prove himself.  Chase did admit to Victor that he envies Victor more than hates him, primarily because Victor is the son Chase believes his parents wanted (he even has the same name as Chase's father). By the end of [[Brian K. Vaughan]]'s stint on ''Runaways'', Chase and Victor had switched roles: Victor stood by the team without hesitation while a grief-ridden Chase carried out his own agenda without regards to the team's safety.  Victor even questioned Nico when she admitted Chase back into the group as Chase questioned Victor's membership earlier, yet Nico's response remained the same as it was when Victor asked it: if Chase went rogue again, she would not hesitate to kill him.

===Victor Stein===

The first time the Stein family appears, Victor Stein punches Chase in the face and berates him for getting bad grades. A few issues later, it is implied that Chase's father regularly hits him--when Alex informs Chase that Victor attacked Chase with one of his inventions, Chase replies "What else is new? I probably had it coming."

In volume two, Chase tells Nico that he's evil, and implies that he once killed someone who tried to carjack his van(this as it turns out is his uncle Hunter, whom he accidentally hit and killed with his car). However, after Gert's death Chase realizes he isn't evil. He admits that his mother allowed his father to abuse him, and because none of his dad's reasons for hitting him ever seemed good enough, Chase started making up reasons and convincing himself they were true.

==Conceptual changes==
In Brian K. Vaughan's original pitch for the series, Chase was originally called John.  The relationship Chase has with Molly in the comics was also originally given to Gert.<ref>Runaways Vol. 1 Hardcover</ref>
