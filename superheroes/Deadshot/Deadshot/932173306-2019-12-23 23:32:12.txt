==Fictional character biography==
[[File:Original Deadshot.jpg|thumb|upright|Deadshot in his first appearance from ''Batman'' #59 (June 1950). Art by Lew Schwartz, Bob Kane, and Charles Paris.]]
Deadshot is often a hired assassin, regularly boasting to "Never Miss". He is capable of using a large variety of weapons, but is most frequently portrayed as using a pair of suppressed, wrist-mounted guns. He initially appears in [[Gotham City]] as a new crime fighter, but is revealed to be an enemy of Batman when he attempts to replace the Dark Knight. He is sent to jail when Batman and [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]] publicly expose his plot to become the king of Gotham's underworld.<ref>''Batman'' #59 (June 1950)</ref> After breaking out of jail, Deadshot begins hiring his services out as an assassin, changing his costume from the top hat and tails he previously wore to a red jumpsuit and distinctive metal face plate with a targeting device on the right side.<ref>''Detective Comics ''#474</ref>

Deadshot's past is revealed in subsequent appearances. His real name is Floyd Lawton, and he grew up in a wealthy household with his mother, abusive father, and older brother Eddie. Eddie was beloved by his parents and the other townspeople, while Floyd was a troubled child and despised by his parents; still, Floyd idolized his brother and always stood up for him during conflicts with the town's other children. Floyd's parents were the most powerful people in his town, but they were known to despise each other. Eventually Floyd's mother claimed his father had become "too abusive", prompting Floyd and Eddie to kill him. When Eddie attempted the kill, he shot his father's spine, crippling him. Floyd took a shot from his tree house but accidentally killed Eddie instead. From that moment on, Floyd swore to never miss another shot again.<ref name="DeadshotMS88">''Deadshot'' mini-series #1-4 (1988)</ref>

===Suicide Squad===
Deadshot has been a major figure in the [[Suicide Squad]] in its latest two incarnations, where his skills as a marksman and his disregard for human life serve to advance the group's objectives.

[[File:Deadshot 2017.png|thumb|left|upright|Deadshot as he appears without his mask in ''Suicide Squad'' vol. 5, #20 (August 2017). Art by [[Stjepan Šejić]].]]
One of his most defining traits is a desire to die in a spectacular fashion, this being his primary motivation for joining the Suicide Squad. He feels he has no reason to continue living, and, while he does not want to commit suicide, he simply does not care if he dies.<ref>{{cite web|last=Danzis|first=Alan|url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/arrow/arrow-exclusive-michael-rowe-o-53576.aspx|title='Arrow' Exclusive: Michael Rowe on Deadshot Becoming a Hero, Diggle and Life Changing Tattoos|publisher=[[BuddyTV]]|date=May 14, 2014|accessdate=June 11, 2015}}</ref> Various reasons have been cited for this, but the most common thread in them is his parents' peculiar hatred for one another.

Deadshot almost gets his wish to die when he confronts a Senator who is threatening to expose the Suicide Squad to the world. Having been ordered to stop his immediate superior, [[Rick Flag]], from assassinating the senator, he kills the senator himself, citing his orders as "Stop Flag from killing the Senator. Exact words". After this Deadshot is gunned down by the police on the steps of the [[Lincoln Memorial]]. He survives his wounds, to continue on with the Squad.

Lawton's uniform is stolen by an airport employee, who uses it to commit crimes and murders. Lawton is forced to kill the man with a bullet to the head. The shooting of his own "image" affects him greatly; for a while, he does not even fix the hole in his own uniform. While the suit has been lost, Lawton has threatened to kill the man he thought had been responsible, his teammate [[Captain Boomerang]].

During a mission for the Suicide Squad, [[Count Vertigo]] asks Deadshot if he would kill him if asked. Deadshot agrees and the two go off to a secluded area for the decision. Vertigo declines, a decision Deadshot accepts with no argument.

After being affected by the supernatural entity [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]] during the ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'' storyline, Deadshot decides to kill a [[kindergarten]] class via a large explosion. An incarnation of the [[Justice League]] stops him. Around this time, Deadshot travels overseas to kill the [[Pope]]. [[Wonder Woman]] stops him at the last minute.

After dozens of villains are infected by the Joker venom, Deadshot, Merlyn and [[Deadline (DC Comics)|Deadline]] attack the Iron Heights metahuman prison. Deadline is killed and Deadshot rescues Captain Boomerang from medical confinement.<ref>''Flash'' (vol.2) #179 (December 2001). DC Comics.</ref>

===Children===
Deadshot had a son named Edward "Eddie" Lawton who appeared in the 1988 ''Deadshot'' series. Eddie was sodomized and killed by Wes Anselm, a member of the gang hired by Deadshot's mother in order to blackmail her son into finally killing his hated father. In retaliation, Deadshot crippled her spine.<ref name="DeadshotMS88" />
In a second mini-series released in 2005, Deadshot discovers he has a daughter, Zoe, who is being raised in a crime-filled area of [[Star City (comics)|Star City]]. Lawton decides to do right by his daughter, and embarks on a lethal war on the local gangs that plague the area. The series ends with Deadshot faking his death, having realized a normal life is not for him, but also having mostly cleared up the area and convincing [[Green Arrow]] to patrol it more regularly.

In the [[New 52]] continuity of Suicide Squad, there is a Japanese girl named Suchin Lawton who is revealed to be Deadshot's daughter, though little else is revealed.

===Secret Six===
During the 2005–2006 "[[Infinite Crisis]]" storyline, Deadshot is featured in the series ''[[Villains United]]''. The [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]] are banded together by a mysterious, shrouded character named [[Mockingbird (DC Comics)|Mockingbird]] (who is actually [[Lex Luthor]]) who offers a major reward for committing to the team and a severe punishment for not accepting membership. Deadshot is offered the reward of ruling [[North America]]; his punishment is to be the destruction of the neighborhood in which his daughter and his daughter's mother live. At the end of the miniseries, the conflict ends in stalemate and Deadshot's status remains roughly unchanged from the end of his second miniseries. He remains a part of The Secret Six and is shown having reached a grudging friendship with another member, [[Catman (comics)|Catman]]. His share of the payment for the Six' mercenary work is stated to be sent in its entirety to his daughter and her mother. After the Six disband, [[Knockout (DC Comics)|Knockout]] comments in passing that he has returned to the Suicide Squad.

===Countdown===
Deadshot and the Suicide Squad are featured in ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis|Countdown]]'', rounding up supervillains for [[Salvation Run|removal]]. The group encounters [[Pied Piper (comics)|Pied Piper]] and [[Trickster (comics)|Trickster]] several times, and each time fail to capture them. In ''Countdown To Final Crisis'' #24 Deadshot makes a solo effort to capture them, but the pair again elude him. In issue 22, Deadshot (breaking orders from [[Amanda Waller]] and Suicide Squad protocol) attacks Piper and Trickster on a train outside of the Rocky Mountains. Given that the supervillains are aware of Project Salvation (''[[Salvation Run]]''), Deadshot apparently kills The Trickster, leaving Pied Piper on his own. In ''Salvation Run'' #2, Deadshot is tricked and sent off to the prison planet along with the last batch of criminals. [[Rick Flag]], Jr. tells him as the [[Boom tube]] closes that he cannot have people like him on Earth. Deadshot vows that if he ever returns to Earth, he would take his revenge on Flag. After helping fight off the [[Parademon]] invasion, he escapes with the surviving villains in the [[teleportation]] machine.

===''Batman: Cacophony''===
In ''[[Batman: Cacophony]]'', Deadshot is seen breaking into [[Arkham Asylum]]. He goes to the [[Joker (character)|Joker]]'s cell and explains that he has taken a contract on the Joker's life, due to his indirect responsibility for the death of a high school student. Just as he is about to kill the Joker, however, [[Onomatopoeia (comics)|Onomatopoeia]] arrives and engages Deadshot in a shootout. Eventually, Onomatopoeia gains the upper hand and shoots Deadshot in the head.

It is later revealed that Deadshot's armor saves him, and masks his vital signs to make it appear that he had been killed. He explains what happened at Arkham to Batman, before being turned over to the [[Gotham City Police Department|Gotham Police]]. Batman uses the technology of Lawton's mask to later survive an encounter with the Joker and Onomatopoeia.

===''Secret Six'' volume 2===
Deadshot, along with [[Scandal (comics)|Scandal Savage]], [[Bane (comics)|Bane]], [[Rag Doll (comics)|Rag Doll]], and [[Catman (comics)|Cat-Man]] reunite the Secret Six, having been hired to retrieve [[Tarantula (DC Comics)|Tarantula]] from [[Alcatraz Island]], and find a card which she stole from Junior, a mysterious villain who supposedly runs the entire West Coast mob. Junior has practically the entire villain community at her beck and call, all afraid of her, even those in Arkham Asylum. The Six later learn that the card in question was made by [[Neron (DC comics)|Neron]], and says "Get Out Of Hell Free."

Soon, the Six are attacked by a small army of super-villains, all wanting to recover the card and collect the reward of $20 million for each of the Six, under the orders of Junior, who captures and tortures Bane, whose strong principles and moral convictions, paired with his fatherly fondness of Scandal keep him from betraying his new team. It is later revealed that Junior is in fact Rag Doll's sister and daughter of the first Rag Doll. She has the ghastly appearance of an old clown, with sliced skin and eyes stitched wide open to give the appearance of a clown.

The Six escape, and head for [[Gotham City]], with Deadshot seemingly betraying them and leaving with Tarantula. The Six manage to catch up to Deadshot, only to be attacked by Junior and the Super villains, and the [[Mad Hatter (comics)|Mad Hatter]], who is revealed to be the one who hired them, simply so they would be killed. Tarantula sacrifices herself by pulling herself and Junior in front of the Super villains' combined attack, seemingly destroying the card along with them. However, it is later shown that Scandal is now in possession of the card.

The Suicide Squad re-enter Deadshot's life when the title returned in January 2010 as a tie-in to the "[[Blackest Night]]" storyline.<ref>{{cite web|author=Richard George |url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/103/1035721p1.html |title=Blackest Night's Future: January 2010 – Comics Feature at IGN |publisher=Comics.ign.com |date=2009-10-15 |accessdate=2010-12-29}}</ref>

While on a mission to Gotham City to kill several of Batman's allies, Rag Doll insinuates that Deadshot and Cat-Man are friends despite their protestations, something they grudgingly acknowledge. Before this plot thread can be pursued further, the Six are ambushed by an army of superheroes who had come to assist Batman. Deadshot and the rest of the team choose to fight the heroes despite the overwhelming odds, and Deadshot manages to take down [[Doctor Light (Kimiyo Hoshi)|Doctor Light]] before being blasted and rendered unconscious by [[Green Lantern (John Stewart)|Green Lantern]]. The rest of the Six are similarly trounced and defeated soon after.<ref>''Secret Six'' (vol. 3) #36 (August 2011). DC Comics.</ref>

===The New 52===
{{Update|date=August 2017}}
In [[The New 52]] (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), Deadshot is recruited to the Suicide Squad prior to the events of the first issue.<ref>''Suicide Squad'' #1. DC Comics.</ref> He still has a daughter and wears a costume similar to the one he wore in the 2000s mini-series, but his son has been erased from continuity. In addition, Deadshot no longer has his trademark mustache (though he briefly regrows it to cover a scar in issue #13). He is portrayed as a Batman villain and a rival of Mad Dog, a bounty hunter. He also is bitter enemies with [[Captain Boomerang]].<ref>''Suicide Squad'' #3. DC Comics.</ref>

Deadshot is arrested for a failed assassination of a U.S. Senator by Batman and was sentenced to life in prison. Later, he is recruited to be part of the Suicide Squad in exchange for early release. Deadshot is made team leader due to his skill under pressure, but quickly grows disillusioned with the group after a planned visit with his daughter, his first since his arrest, is withheld from him and ultimately aborted within minutes of him reuniting with his daughter in order to send him on a mission.<ref>''Suicide Squad'' #5. DC Comics.</ref>

Deadshot ultimately sacrifices his life to kill the evil cult member Regulas, who had brainwashed most of the members of Suicide Squad and had recruited Black Spider into his group Basilisk in order to assassinate Amanda Waller. Deadshot is later revealed to have been resurrected, possibly through use of an arm from [[Resurrection Man (comics)|Resurrection Man]], obtained by the Squad for Waller during an earlier mission.<ref>''Suicide Squad'' #14. DC Comics.</ref>

During the 2013–2014 "[[Forever Evil]]" story line, Amanda Waller contacts Deadshot to help her get the Suicide Squad back together after the three Justice League teams are "dead."<ref>''Justice League of America'' (Vol. 3) #7.1. DC Comics.</ref> After his money was wired, Deadshot heads out to get Harley Quinn back on the team.<ref>''Detective Comics'' (Vol. 2) #23.2. DC Comics.</ref>

===DC Rebirth===
{{Update|date=August 2017}}
During the War of Jokes and Riddles, a story taking place in the early days of Batman's career, Deadshot sided with the Joker. Deadshot engaged Deathstroke, who sided with the Riddler, in a battle that took over 5 days, killing multiple victims. Eventually Batman put a stop to it and gave both a swift defeat. Deadshot suffered severe head trauma and was hospitalized.<ref>''Batman'' Vol. 3 #28</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Deadshot has no superhuman powers, but is the top marksman in the DC Universe, possessing superhuman-like accuracy, and regularly boasting to "never miss" his target.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dccomics.com/characters/deadshot|title=Deadshot|date=2014-03-06|website=DC|language=en|access-date=2019-04-12}}</ref> The character once shot an apple off of [[Captain Boomerang]]'s head with his eyes closed. He also intentionally grazed the skull of [[Enchantress (DC Comics)|Enchantress]] while she was flying, since he was asked to take her down non-lethally. Deadshot is also a tactical genius and master strategist.

Deadshot has access to a vast array of weaponry, most notably his sniper rifle, and twin machine guns mounted on each arm. Deadshot is allegedly [[Multilingualism|bilingual]], and learned to speak [[Russian language|Russian]]<ref>''Suicide Squad'' vol. 1 #57 (September 1991)</ref> as a youth. He also claims to have been a Card-carrying Communist.

Deadshot has proven to be a formidable hand-to-hand combatant when needed due to his excellent physical condition and training as an assassin, being able to go toe-to-toe in a fist fight against [[Batman]] for a prolonged amount of time on one occasion. He is adept in [[Karate]], [[Jiu-Jitsu]], [[Judo]], [[Boxing]], [[Krav Maga]], and [[Muay Thai]]. He is also an expert in many different styles of [[knife fight]]ing.

==Personality==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}
Deadshot is portrayed as a consummate professional; as long as he has been paid to kill someone, he will always carry it out, without exceptions. Batman was unable to get him to stop threatening a witness by threatening Deadshot or his family; Deadshot rightly assumed that Batman was bluffing. However, Batman ultimately does get Deadshot to abort the hit by freezing his client's bank accounts. Unable to get paid, Deadshot publicly cancelled the assassination, letting the witness go free.

Perhaps his most defining trait is his acknowledged death wish, which often manifests as him deliberately engineering situations likely to kill him. This makes him unpredictable as an opponent, as his willingness to die allows him to deliberately injure himself to achieve a goal. For example, during [[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]], he deliberately shoots himself in the neck while fighting [[Kyle Rayner]], so that Rayner would attempt to save him and drop his guard, allowing Lawton to take aim and almost shoot him. He often expresses disappointment at surviving his missions, such as immediately lamenting "damn" when awakening in a hospital.

In his run on ''Suicide Squad'', John Ostrander delved into Deadshot's past and family background. The revelation of Deadshot having a brother, whom he idolized, seemed to resonate with Deadshot's attachment to Rick Flag, team leader. Ostrander implied that this relationship also colored Deadshot's rivalry with Batman, whom Deadshot had always been unable—or subconsciously unwilling—to kill.

==Other versions==
===Amalgam Comics===
In the [[Amalgam Comics]] universe, Deadshot was combined with the Marvel villain [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] to create the assassin Deadeye.

===Arrow===
In the tie-in comic to ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'', issue "Back from the Deadshot" (set after the events of "Lone Gunmen"), when Floyd regains consciousness, an elderly homeless man approaches him. Deadshot wrenches the arrow from his eye and stabs the old man with it. As he staggers out of the building, he is kidnapped by a group of men in a van after losing consciousness again, before he could be taken by the police. In a hospital room, Lawton wakes up and finds his eye having been operated on. Before his brain could be examined, under the instructions of an unknown man, he breaks out of his restraints and walks out. Two months later, Deadshot appears in Bludhaven and approaches a man who apparently has a job for him, but he is rejected due to having only one fully working eye. He stays in this city as retired assassin before [[China White (comics)|China White]] gives him a new offer and new eye scope.

===Arrow: Season 2.5===
Deadshot appears in ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' digital comic, working as part of the [[Suicide Squad]], killing members of the extremist sect Onslaught in the [[Kasnia|Republic of Kasnia]] along with [[Bronze Tiger]]. The two were later training in the [[A.R.G.U.S.]] headquarters, taking out ten men in 7 seconds. Soon afterwards, he, Tiger, Diggle, and [[Ravan Nassar]] are deployed to [[Kahndaq]] to take down [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]]. When they arrive at an Onslaught camp, Deadshot takes up his trademark sniper position, killing an Onslaught member as he was about to execute hostages, providing a distraction for Bronze Tiger and Diggle to begin killing other members. After Nassar blows up an Onslaught truck, Deadshot and the rest of the group find a survivor to take them to [[Black Adam|Khem-Adam]]. Lawton and Turner torture the survivor, but Diggle manages to convince the survivor to tell the Squad the location of Khem-Adam's lair. They arrive there and free the kidnapped girls, killing several Onslaught agents along the way. Lawton picks up Turner's body after Khem-Adam killed him and carries him out to the waiting A.R.G.U.S. helicopter, insisting that he be buried in his home country.

===Batman: Sins of the Father===
Deadshot appears as the main antagonist of the tie-in digital comic taking place between the video games ''[[Batman: The Telltale Series]]'' and ''[[Batman: The Enemy Within]]''. Hailing from a family of wealthy real-estate tycoons, Floyd witnessed his older brother killed by his abusive parents when he was a child and later murdered them when he was fourteen while setting it up to make it look like they killed themselves. Inheriting his family's wealth, he quits the real-estate business and becomes a military contractor, giving him access to a large arsenal of weapons.

Lawton later discovers that despite his parents being sent to Arkham Asylum on accounts of child abuse before his brother's death, they were not committed to the prison as their doctor, [[Thomas Wayne]], agreed to keep them out of the asylum as long as they give him a large discount on a building that would eventually become Wayne Tower. After the revelations of Thomas Wayne's corrupt nature were brought to the public in the first game, Lawton becomes Deadshot and uses his expert marksmanship to hunt down the Arkham staff that were working at the asylum during the time period that Thomas operated.

===The Flash: Season Zero===
In ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' digital comic, Lawton teams up with [[Captain Boomerang|Digger Harkness]] and [[Cupid (comics)|Carrie Cutter]] as part of the Squad. They watch The Flash take on the meta-human [[King Shark]]. Waller tells him and the rest of the Squad to suit up, as they were going in to stop the Shark. They arrive outside of the man's former apartment and Deadshot helps to knock him down, before Cupid traps him with a net. [[Joe West (Arrowverse)|Joe West]] approaches, asking who they were, before Lawton introduced them as the Suicide Squad. They each fire at him, but he is saved by [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|The Flash]], who rushed him to safety while the Squad appears to recognize him.

===Futures End===
Set in a near alternate future of the New 52, Lawton is imprisoned in an underground Belle Reeve missing his shooting arm. He, and the future Black Manta and Harley Quinn are broken out by Amanda Waller, who informs them that they were imprisoned and forgotten as the government found a way to clone super villains and Suicide Squad members in Texas. After Harley and Manta are killed by Joker clones, Deadshot allows Waller time by taking on a Deathstroke clone in a sword fight. Despite his disadvantages, Deadshot defeats the clone and sacrifices his life in the process. Deadshot's actions allowed Waller to break into the main hub and stop the cloning.

===Tiny Titans===
Deadshot makes a cameo in the ''[[Tiny Titans]]'' series as a player on Lobo's soccer team called the Secret Six.

===Young Justice===
While Deadshot wasn't in the TV series ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'', he did appear in the tie-in comic. He is seemingly hired by [[Queen Bee (comics)|Queen Bee]] to assassinate Quraci President Rumaan Harjavti, but is intercepted by [[Superman]], [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]], and [[Miss Martian]]. He does manage to shoot Ruuman's brother, Sumaan in the shoulder before he's nearly beaten to death by Superboy (who was aggressive due to Luthor's patch drug) and carried to the hospital by Superman. Queen Bee revealed that Deadshot did succeed as his mission was to actually injure Suuman (as Suuman would be viewed as a hero to the public and she has Suuman under her control).

He makes his debut in [[Arrow (season 1)|season one]] episode "Lone Gunmen", hired by a businessman to eliminate competition, but is stopped by the vigilante "[[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Hood]]" with an arrow to his right eye. He retires to [[Blüdhaven]], but returns in "Dead to Rights" after being given a cybernetic eyepiece by [[China White (Arrowverse)|China White]] to restore his vision. He is hired to kill [[Malcolm Merlyn (Arrowverse)|Malcolm Merlyn]], who survives the hit thanks to a blood transfusion from [[Tommy Merlyn]]. In the episode "Home Invasion", Lawton returns to Starling City for a contract, which turns out to be a trap set up by A.R.G.U.S. to capture him. Lawton manages to escape the trap, killing several agents while sparing [[John Diggle (Arrowverse)|John Diggle]], who holds a grudge against him for killing his brother Andy. In the [[Arrow (season 2)|season two]] episode "Keep Your Enemies Closer", Lawton shows up in a Russian prison. Diggle comes to the prison looking for A.R.G.U.S. agent [[Lyla Michaels (Arrowverse)|Lyla Michaels]], who was captured while looking for Lawton. Lawton and Diggle work together to free Michaels and the three escape the prison together. Due to his sense of honor, Diggle lets Lawton walk free despite his personal grudge with him. Before leaving, Lawton reveals he was hired to kill Andy by [[H.I.V.E.]] In the episode "Suicide Squad", Lawton reappears in A.R.G.U.S. custody, being forced to be a member of the titular group. Again working alongside Diggle, Lawton and the rest of the group travel to [[Markovia]] to retrieve deadly nerve gas in the possession of a terrorist. After realizing that A.R.G.U.S. intended for him and the rest of the group to die on the mission, Lawton plans to sacrifice himself to save the others, but is saved by Lyla Michaels. In "Unthinkable", Diggle and Michaels let Lawton and the Suicide Squad out of their cells to stop A.R.G.U.S. Director Amanda Waller from destroying Starling City during [[Slade Wilson (Arrowverse)|Slade Wilson]]'s rampage. In the [[Arrow (season 3)|season three]] episode "Suicidal Tendencies", Lawton and the Suicide Squad are sent on a mission to [[Kasnia]] to rescue hostages and U.S. senator Joseph Cray from terrorists.

He is caught in a building explosion and presumed dead, though Diggle later mentions that his body was never recovered. [[Marc Guggenheim]] confirmed that Lawton had been pulled from the show after news broke that the character would appear in the 2016 film ''Suicide Squad''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Davis, Brandon |url=https://comicbook.com/2015/04/01/deadshot-is-officially-off-the-table-for-arrow/ |title=Deadshot Is Officially Off The Table For Arrow|work=Comicbook.com|date=2015-04-01 |accessdate=2019-05-03}}</ref>

[[File:Deadshot (Batman-Gotham Knight).png|upright|thumb|Deadshot as he appears in ''[[Batman: Gotham Knight]]'']]
* Deadshot appears in ''[[Batman: Gotham Knight]]'', voiced by [[Jim Meskimen]]. In his self-titled segment "Deadshot", he first appears on a ferris wheel, where he uses a long range sniper rifle to assassinate a local mayor, before leaving behind a cartridge case with the initials "D.S.". After being contracted to assassinate Batman by the Russian Mafia, Deadshot uses an assassination attempt on [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner James Gordon]] as bait. However, Deadshot is ultimately defeated and apprehended by Batman. Much like the early comic book version, this incarnation dresses in an elegant fashion.
* Deadshot makes a non-speaking appearance in ''[[Superman/Batman: Public Enemies]]''. He is among the villains hired to kill Superman and Batman.
* Deadshot appears in ''[[Batman: Assault on Arkham]]'' (which is set in the ''Batman: Arkham'' video game universe), voiced by [[Neal McDonough]]. He appears as the leader of Amanda Waller's Suicide Squad, and is frequently flirted with by fellow member [[Harley Quinn]], whom he has a one-night stand with. In the film, the group is sent to [[Arkham Asylum]] to retrieve the [[Riddler]]'s cane, which contains information that Waller seeks. After encountering both Batman and the Joker, Riddler assists Deadshot in destroying the explosive chip Waller had implanted in his head as leverage. No longer a member of the Suicide Squad, Deadshot is last seen targeting Waller from a building's roof, with his daughter in the background.
* Deadshot appears in ''[[Suicide Squad: Hell to Pay]]'', voiced again by [[Christian Slater]]. While he is again the leader of Amanda Waller's Suicide Squad, he again plans to be a free man and reunite with his daughter Zoe, who previously dissociated from him (as shown in the beginning of the film on which she rejected most of his mail letters) due to his past crimes. But by the film's epilogue, they end up seemingly reconciled after they meet again. It is assumed that by the film's end, Deadshot is a free man.
