'''Floyd Lawton''', aka '''Deadshot''', is a [[fictional character]] in the [[DC Universe]].

He is a hired assassin and quite possibly the greatest marksman in the world, reputed to "never miss." He is capable of using a large variety of weapons, but prefers using a pair of silenced, wrist-mounted Colts. He initially appeared in [[Gotham City]] as a new crimefighter, but was revealed to be an enemy of [[Batman]] when he attempted to replace the crime fighter. After his plan was successful, he attempted to become king of Gotham's Underworld. [[Batman]] and [[Commissioner Gordon]] publically exposed his plot, and Lawton went to jail.

After sering his term, Deadshot began hiring his services out as an assassin, changing his costume from the top coat and tails he previously wore to his now more familiar red jumpsuit and destinctive metal face plate with a targeting device on the right side. He has been a major figure in the [[Suicide Squad]] in it's latest two incarnations, where his skills as a marksman and his absence of care for human life served to greatly further the group's objectives. During a hiatus from the [[Suicide Squad]] (in a 4 issue miniseries from 1988), his son was abducted, raped, and killed by a pedophile, whom Deadshot later took revenge upon. Probably his most peculiar trait is a great desire to die in a spectacular fashion, this being his primary modivation for joining the [[Suicide Squad]]. He feels he has no reason to continue living, and, while he does not want to commit suicide, he simply does not care if he dies. Various reasons have been cited for this, but the most common thread in them is his parent's peculiar hatred for one another, so much so that Lawton's mother tried to hire both her sons to kill their father. 

A second miniseries featuring Deadshot is currently being published, the first issue available in December 2004.
