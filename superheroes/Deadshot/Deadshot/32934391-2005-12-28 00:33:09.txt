'''Floyd Lawton''', aka '''Deadshot''', is a [[fictional character]] in the [[DC Universe]].

He is a hired assassin and quite possibly the greatest marksman in the world, reputed to "''never miss''". He is capable of using a large variety of weapons, but prefers using a pair of silenced, wrist-mounted Colts. He initially appeared in [[Gotham City]] as a new crimefighter, but was revealed to be an enemy of [[Batman]] when he attempted to replace the crime fighter. When this plan failed, he attempted to become king of Gotham's Underworld. [[Batman]] and [[Commissioner Gordon]] publicly exposed his plot, and Lawton went to jail.

After serving his term, Deadshot began hiring his services out as an assassin, changing his costume from the top coat and tails he previously wore to his now more familiar red jumpsuit and distinctive metal face plate with a targeting device on the right side. He has been a major figure in the [[Suicide Squad]] in its latest two incarnations, where his skills as a marksman and his absence of care for human life served to greatly further the group's objectives. During a hiatus from the Squad (in a 4 issue miniseries from 1988), his son was abducted, raped, and killed by a [[pedophile]], whom Deadshot later took revenge upon. Probably his most peculiar trait is a great desire to die in a spectacular fashion, this being his primary motivation for joining the Squad. He feels he has no reason to continue living, and, while he does not want to commit suicide, he simply does not care if he dies. Various reasons have been cited for this, but the most common thread in them is his parents' peculiar hatred for one another, so much so that Lawton's mother tried to hire both her sons to kill their father. 

A second miniseries featuring Deadshot recently concluded, in which Deadshot found out that he'd had a daughter who was being raised in a crime filled area of [[Star City (comics)|Star City]].  Lawton decided to do right by this daughter, and embarked on a lethal war on the local gangs that plagued the area.  The series ends with Deadshot leaving, having realized a normal life isn't for him, but having mostly cleared up the area and having convinced [[Green Arrow]] to patrol it more regularly.
 
{{spoiler}}
Deadshot is currently active in the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' storyline comic book ''[[Villains United]]''. The [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]] were banded together by a mysterious, shrouded character named [[Mockingbird (comics)|Mockingbird]] who offered a major reward for committing to the team and a severe punishment for not accepting membership. Deadshot was offered the reward of ruling North America; his punishment was to be the destruction of the neighborhood of his daughter and his daughter's mother. At the end of the miniseries, a stalemate was reached and Deadshot's status remains roughly unchanged from the end of his second miniseries. He remains a part of The Secret Six and was shown becoming friends with another member, [[Catman (comics)|Catman]].

==Other Media==
Deadshot has also made appearances in the ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'' and ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' animated series. [[Aquaman]]'s brother [[Ocean Master|Orm]] hired him to kill Aquaman. During the second time, he was apprehended by the Justice League and forced by Batman to tell them who hired him to kill Aquaman. Deadshot later appeared during the villain rampage in both parts of "Hereafter" along with [[Copperhead (DC Comics)|Copperhead]], [[Star Sapphire (comics)|Star Sapphire]], [[Volcana (Superman)|Volcana]], and [[Livewire (villain)|Livewire]] and they were stopped. The next time we see Deadshot, it is in the episode Task Force X. Floyd Lawton is about to get the chair until the warden and guards discovered Colonel [[Rick Flagg|Rick Flagg Jr.]] in it who gives the warden a note that he has been chosen to participate in Task Force X, a decision they force upon Lawton by revealing that his last meal was laced with explosive nanotech robots. He and Rick worked alongside of [[Captain Boomerang]], [[Clock King]] (Temple Fugate), and [[Plastique (comics)|Plastique]] in a stealth mission to steal the Annihiator from the Watchtower. After that mission (and the loss of Plastique), Rick ends up telling the remaining members that they have to work for 5 years to earn suspended sentences. The dissolution of [[Project Cadmus|Cadmus]], however, leaves the question open about what will happen to the Force, or who has control of their deadly nanotechs. Deadshot is voiced by [[Michael Rosenbaum]] who also does [[Flash (comics)|The Flash]] ([[Wally West]]). Rosenbaum uses his impeccable [[Kevin Spacey]] impression for Deadshot, apparently on request of the producers (Rosenbaum entertains them with his impressions during recording sessions). This is, of course, highly ironic, since Spacey will be playing [[Lex Luthor]] in ''[[Superman Returns]]'' soon, a character that Rosenbaum has gained quite some fame for playing on ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]''.
