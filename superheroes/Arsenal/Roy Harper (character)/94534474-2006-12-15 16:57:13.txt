'''Roy Harper''' is the name of two [[fictional character|fictional]] [[superhero]]es in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|Universe]].  He was known for decades as [[Green Arrow]]'s [[teenage]] [[sidekick]] '''[[Speedy]]'''. He first appeared in ''[[More Fun Comics]]'' #73 (Nov. 1941). The current version has assumed the identity of '''Arsenal''' and is currently a member of the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
Roy Harper was raised by Brave Bow, a [[Navajo people|Navajo]] medicine chief after his father, a forest ranger, died in a forest fire.

Under Brave Bow's tutelage, Roy became a remarkable archer, and, after Brave Bow's death, Roy was adopted by Oliver Queen, the [[Green Arrow]], and became the Green Arrow's sidekick, "Speedy."

===Roy Harper of Earth-Two===
[[Image:7Soldiers-Leading01-01-1-.jpg|150px|thumb|left]]

There was an Earth-Two version of Speedy who was a member of the [[Seven Soldiers of Victory]] and [[All-Star Squadron]] in the 1940s along with Green Arrow. Aside from their origin, having been trained on a mesa top together, their history nearly parallels the history of the Earth-One versions up until the point when Arrow and Speedy along with their teammates were thrown into various periods of time during a battle with the [[Nebula Man]]. He and his teammates were later retrieved by the [[Justice Society]] and the [[Justice League]] in order to assist them in saving Earth-Two from the machinations of their old foe the [[Iron Hand]]. Years after returning to the present, Speedy mysteriously disappeared during the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' when a new solitary universe was created at the dawn of time. Whether he ceased to exist or is still alive and missing has never been determined, although his mentor died during the final part of the Crisis defending the new Earth from the [[Anti-Monitor]]


===Teen Titans and Roy's addiction===
Meanwhile, an Earth-One version joined [[Robin (comics)#Dick Grayson|Robin]], [[Wally West|Kid Flash]], [[Tempest (comics)#Garth|Aqualad]] and [[Wonder Girl#Donna Troy|Wonder Girl]] in the newly-formed [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]], a group originally formed from the various "teen sidekicks" active in DC comics at that time. This Speedy is the version active today.

Speedy was initially a successful member and began dating Wonder Girl ([[Donna Troy]]).  Some time later, however, Roy's fortunes took a turn for the worse.  The Titans disbanded, Roy and Donna broke up, and the Green Arrow both lost his fortune and began neglecting Roy.  While the Green Arrow was away on a cross-country adventure with [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]] and [[Black Canary]], Roy became [[Drug addiction|addicted]] to [[heroin]].  Once Roy's secret was discovered, Green Arrow angrily punched him and then threw Roy out on the street.  Green Lantern later found him and left him in the care of Black Canary, who stayed by his side while he went through withdrawal.  Soon after, he had a confrontation with Green Arrow that caused the two of them to stop working together.

In addition to some brief adventures with various incarnations of the Titans, Roy also served as a government agent for the CBI, and as a private investigator.

===Agent of Checkmate===
[[Image:Arsenal5.jpg|Roy Harper, Agent of Checkmate.|thumb|160px|right]]

While still helping the Teen Titans on occasional missions, Roy frequently worked as a counselor for various anti-drug programs.  During this time, Roy established government contacts, and was soon hired by the Central Bureau of Investigations (CBI, also known as [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]]) as a drug enforcement agent. 

Roy was given an assignment to go undercover and gain the trust of the villain [[Cheshire (comics)|Cheshire]].  The intention was to turn Cheshire over to the authorities, but the two fell in love and had an affair.  Roy could not bring himself to turn her in, but he was concerned that his presence endangered Cheshire's life, so he left her, unaware that Cheshire was pregnant with his child.

Roy eventually learned that he was the father of Cheshire's daughter, Lian. He went on a mission with [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] (the former Robin) to track down Cheshire and prevent her from assassinating a group of diplomats.  Roy was captured by Cheshire and then freed by Nightwing, who also brought Roy's daughter.  Cheshire had left Lian in Roy's care.

===From Speedy to Arsenal===
[[Image:Arsenal1.jpg|thumb|175px|left|First Appearance of Roy Harper as Arsenal.  Art by [[Tom Grummett]].]]
Roy later returned to the Titans.  At this time, he adopted the new identity of Arsenal, now equipped with a vast array of high-tech weaponry. 

Soon, another team of Teen Titans emerged. This group consisted of a teen-aged [[Atom (comics)|Atom]] (de-aged by events in ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]'') and new heroes [[Argent (comics)|Argent]], [[Risk (comics)|Risk]], [[Joto (comics)|Joto]] and Prysm.  The team was funded by Loren Jupiter, who had also funded a group of Titans during Roy's time on the team. 

Jupiter gathered together the original Titans (now going by the aliases of Nightwing, Tempest, Flash and Arsenal) to combat the threat of his bitter, super-powered son Jarrod Jupiter (Haze). New and old Titans joined forces to defeat Haze â€“ but at a price; Joto apparently lost his life, and Arsenal felt responsible for his death.  Arsenal remained with this new group of Titans for a time, but eventually left the group before it disbanded.

Arsenal later came into conflict with [[Vandal Savage]].  Savage had discovered that both Roy and his daughter Lian were his descendants.  Thus, their organs were suitable for him to harvest to prolong his life. 

Roy was able to save his daughter from Savage.  After this ordeal, Roy adopted a new look to reflect his Navajo heritage.  Shortly after, the original five Titans decided to re-form the team.  Arsenal served as a full-time member on the team, and resided at the new [[Titans Tower]] with his daughter, Lian.

===The Outsiders===
Later, a mysterious conglomerate known as Optitron offered to sponsor the Titans and [[Young Justice]] after summoning them to [[San Francisco]].  Before any decisions could be made, a cybernetic girl from the future (known as [[Indigo (comics)|Indigo]]) invaded the complex, and immediately engaged both teams in combat.  With half the group out of commission, the remaining members tried to track down Indigo, but instead encountered a rogue [[Superman]] android, which had been activated.  Caught by surprise, [[Lilith (DC Comics)|Lilith]] had her neck snapped by the Superman android, killing her instantly.  Troia (Donna Troy's new identity) tried valiantly to defeat the Superman Android, but he released a deadly heat beam directly through her chest, killing her.  Indigo arrived and shut down the Superman Android, leaving Arsenal and [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] to mourn the fallen Troia.  Shaken by these losses, Nightwing decided to officially end the Titans.

Roy saw an opportunity. He accepted Optitron's offer and set about forming a new team: the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]].  He began by buying a massive secret underground headquarters beneath New York City.  Roy outfitted the shelter with state-of-the-art equipment and began recruiting members for the new team.  He successfully coaxed the veteran [[Metamorpho]], as well as newcomers [[Grace (comics)|Grace]] and [[Thunder (comics)|Thunder]] into joining the team.  He also decided to accept Indigo as a member.  Even though she had been responsible for activating the Superman android, and ultimately for Lilith's and Troia's deaths, her memories were wiped clean and she convinced Roy that she wanted to atone for what she had done. 

Indigo's presence would prove to be a major sticking point for Arsenal's last recruit: Nightwing.  The Titans' former leader was completely unwilling to renew his involvement in a team after such a devastating loss.  Arsenal argued that the Outsiders were the next logical step for them beyond the Titans, and that perhaps a team of strangers would operate more efficiently than a team with so many emotional attachments.  Nightwing, while still reluctant, agreed to join and lead the Outsiders shortly after defeating [[Gorilla Grodd]].

Arsenal was shot in the chest while attempting to stop [[Brother Blood]] from activating a global network of sleeper agents.  He survived, but was sidelined for months.  In the interim, he assigned the [[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]] as his replacement.  He was hesitant to resume active duty, feeling afraid of his own limitations, but returned with encouragement from Nightwing. 

Not long after his recovery, the Outsiders took on a case which involved a child-slaver and molester named Tanner.  One of Tanner's informants recognized Roy from years prior, and led Tanner to Roy's daughter, Lian.  Lian's nanny was killed and the girl was branded with Tanner's mark.  The Outsiders arrived just in time to save Lian and other children from being flown out of New York. 

Oddly, his near-death from gunshot wounds saved his life when soon he met [[Deathstroke]].  The villain, Arsenal discovered, had been posing as [[Batman]] and feeding him information since the Outsiders began.  Deathstroke and Arsenal fought, with Deathstroke intending to kill him, but when the mercenary discovered the bullet scars on Arsenal's chest, he figured Arsenal had suffered enough and gave him a "pass".  About the same time, Arsenal was also kidnapped by Green Arrow's nemesis [[Constantine Drakon]].  Drakon was working with the [[Riddler]], and he slit Roy's throat so that he would have to apply constant pressure or die.  The Outsiders helped search for and rescue Roy.

During ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Arsenal is serving as leader of the Outsiders and raising Lian as a single father.  He was among the heroes gathered to defend [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] from an invasion by the [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Society of Supervillains]] ''(see also: [[Battle of Metropolis]])''.

===One Year Later===
{{Spoilers}}
Roy appeared in the first issue of ''Justice League of America'' #1, where it was revealed that he will be serving on the new Justice League. In issue #4, while in battle, Hal Jordan refers to him as "Red Arrow."

==Arsenal in other media==
*Speedy's first animated appearance was in the Teen Titans segments in [[1967 in television|1967]]'s ''[[The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure]]''.  In those episodes, Speedy serves in the effective place of [[Robin (comics)|Robin]].
* Speedy has appeared on the ''[[Teen Titans (animated series)|Teen Titans]]'' [[animated series]], where he is voiced by [[Mike Erwin]].  Although his real name is not given, his appearance is clearly based on that of Roy Harper.  While not a member of the main Titans team himself, he appeared as a supporting character in the episode "Winner Take All", and fought Robin, trying to convince him if winning is really that important.  Speedy later joined up with the team's sister group, [[Titans East]].  As depicted in the series, Speedy is serious and businesslike as in his Arsenal years in comics.  However, when he reappears in "Titans East Pt. 1", more of his traditional bad-boy Speedy personality is seen, as he refuses to apologize for buying fish tacos, which offends [[Aqualad]] to no end.  He was mind-controlled by [[Brother Blood]] in "Titans East Pt. 2", but saved by Titans West.  Speedy's bow was broken by [[Cheshire (comics)|Cheshire]] in "Calling All Titans".  He was then overpowered by her.  However, in the episode "Titans Together", Speedy somehow regained possession of his bow when he was freed from his suspended animation.
* Speedy has also made several appearances in the comic book series based on the cartoon.  His first appearance in issue #10 was a cameo.  He made a reappearance with the rest of Titans East in #20 & #25.  A super-deformed version of him posed as Cupid in #27.  One of the two stories in issue #30 focuses on him and [[Tempest (comics)|Aqualad]].  Thus far, he and Aqualad both have made appearances in each tenth issue.
[[Image:Speedyjlu.jpg|210px|thumb|Speedy in the ''Justice League Unlimited'' episode "Patriot Act".]] 
*Speedy appears in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "Patriot Act".  There, Speedy states that he is Green Arrow's "ex-partner" when Green Arrow calls him "my ex-sidekick", and is visually designed as a slightly older, better built version of his ''Teen Titans'' incarnation (his costume is the same, and he is still voiced by Mike Erwin).  This does not necessarily mean the shows are in continuity with one another, and may have been a nod to the Titans cartoon and nothing more, much like [[Michael Rosenbaum]]'s voicing of [[Wally West|Kid Flash]] in the ''Teen Titans'' episode "Lightspeed".  Speedy's appearance is also a nod to the original [[Seven Soldiers of Victory]], who are the stars of this episode. This version of Speedy is also scheduled to appear in ''Justice League Unlimited #30'' [http://www.dccomics.com/comics/?cm=6836].
