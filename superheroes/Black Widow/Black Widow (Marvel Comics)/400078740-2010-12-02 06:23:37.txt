'''Black Widow''' is the name of several [[fictional]] [[superhero]]ines appearing in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Most of these versions exist in Marvel's main [[shared universe]], known as the [[Marvel Universe]].

==Claire Voyant==
'''[[Black Widow (Claire Voyant)|Claire Voyant]]''' was one of the first costumed, superpowered female protagonists in comics created by writer [[George Kapitan]] and artist [[Harry Sahle]]. She first appeared in ''[[Mystic Comics]]'' #4 (August 1940). The character is an [[antihero]] who kills evildoers to deliver their souls to [[Satan]], her master. The character is unrelated to the later Marvel Comics superheroines who took on the codename.

==Natalia Romanova / Natasha Romanoff==
'''[[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Natalia "Natasha" Alianovna Romanova]]'''<ref>''[[Wolverine: Origins]]'' #16 (Sep. 2007)</ref> is the first character to take on the Black Widow codename in the modern mainstream Marvel Comics. She was created by editor and plotter [[Stan Lee]], scripter [[Don Rico]] and artist [[Don Heck]], and first appeared in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #52 (April 1964). The character has been associated with several superhero teams in the Marvel Universe, including [[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]], [[Defenders (comics)|The Defenders]], [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], and [[Thunderbolts (comics)|the Thunderbolts]]. She has appeared in many other forms of media, including the major motion picture ''[[Iron Man 2]]'', where she was portrayed by actress [[Scarlett Johansson]].

==Yelena Belova==
'''[[Black Widow (Yelena Belova)|Yelena Belova]]''', the second modern mainstream Black Widow after Natalia Romanova, debuted briefly in ''[[Inhumans]]'' #5 (March 1999). She was fully introduced in the 1999 [[Marvel Knights]] mini-series ''Black Widow''. A second miniseries, also titled ''Black Widow'' and featuring Natasha Romanoff and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], followed in 2001. The next year, she did a solo turn in her own three-issue miniseries, also titled ''Black Widow'' (officially ''Black Widow: Pale Little Spider'' in the series' [[postal indicia]]) under the mature-audience [[Marvel MAX]] imprint. This June to August 2002 story arc, by writer [[Greg Rucka]] and artist [[Igor Kordey]], was a [[flashback]] to the story of her becoming the second modern Black Widow, in events preceding her ''Inhumans'' appearance.
