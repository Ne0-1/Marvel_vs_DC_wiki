'''Apache Chief''' is a fictional [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[superhero]] from the various ''[[Super Friends]]'' cartoons created by [[Hanna-Barbera]]. He was one of the new heroes added (along with [[Black Vulcan]], [[Rima|Rima the Jungle Girl]], [[El Dorado (Super Friends)|El Dorado]] and [[Samurai (Super Friends)|Samurai]]) to increase the number of non-[[White people|white]] characters in the Super Friends ranks.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} He was voiced by [[Michael Rye]].

In the ''[[Challenge of the Super Friends]]'' Series, Apache Chief was seen in every episode except one, but had spoken lines in only nine out of the sixteen episodes of the series. His arch enemy from the [[Legion of Doom (comics)|Legion of Doom]] was [[Giganta]], who also happens to be an original arch enemy of [[Wonder Woman]].

==Fictional character biography==
By speaking the word "Inyuk-chuk" ("Big Man"), Apache Chief could grow to vast sizes. In an episode titled "Colossus", Apache Chief "Inyuk-chuks" himself to cosmic proportions to battle the Colossus, a titanic space creature that plucked Earth from its orbit and placed it in a small (relative to him) glass bottle. He also spoke in [[stereotype|stereotypical]] "Native American English" and recited vaguely Native American [[philosophy]]. In the 1978 episodes "Revenge on Gorilla City" and "The Time Trap" the 1984 short episode entitled "The Village of Lost Souls", it was shown that Apache Chief also had a superhuman tracking ability.

Apache Chief's origin, shown as a recording in the episode "History of Doom", was thus: while still a young brave, he went for a walk with the chief of his tribe. The two men are quickly attacked by a bear, but the chief - recognizing that the young brave might be ready for a test such as this - gives the younger man a pouch of a special magic powder, which will amplify the user's thoughts and abilities a hundredfold. The young man resolves to be strong and brave (heeding the chief's advice that whatever is in his mind at the time, the dust will amplify), and upon sprinkling himself with the powder and invoking the magic phrase "Inyuk-chuk", grows to fifty feet in size, stronger and braver. He disposes of the bear without violence, proving that he has passed the test. (Unfortunately, a passerby witnesses the entire affair and steals the dust, using it on herself - and becomes the evil [[Giganta]]: "Your fifty feet of good are now matched by my fifty feet of evil!")

===DC Comics universe===
Apache Chief does not appear in the mainstream [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]], but a somewhat similar character called [[Manitou Raven]] was created as an homage to him{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} and joined the [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] [[Justice League|JLA]]. Like Apache Chief, Manitou Raven and later, Manitou's widow, [[Manitou Dawn]], have both been seen to say 'Inyuk-chuk' when casting spells or invoking powers.

==Other versions==
The character '''Long Shadow''' from the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' series is based directly on Apache Chief{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}. Here he is a member of the [[Ultimen]], the group itself a reference to the Super Friends. Long Shadow has the ability to increase his size, increasing his strength (he also demonstrates superhuman strength and heat resistance, fighting lava men hand-to-hand even before growing). He also gains enhanced hearing.

Long Shadow comes off as the most innocent and selfless member of the Ultimen, a quality which sets him apart from his somewhat greedy teammates and catches the eye of [[Wonder Woman]]. He is also the only member of the Ultimen to express interest in joining the Justice League, the others being more concerned with the material rewards of their current arrangement. When the team discovers that they are clones, and that their cellular structure is breaking down, Long Shadow remains the voice of reason as the others become increasingly unstable, [[Samurai (Super Friends)#Other versions|Wind Dragon]] in particular. When they are unable to find a cure, his teammates begin to destroy the building that serves as their headquarters. Long Shadow assists in evacuating the civilians from the building, then tries to reason with Wind Dragon when he decides to destroy the Justice League. After all but Wind Dragon are defeated, Long Shadow convinces him to stop fighting, citing Wind Dragon's former appreciation of the Justice League as heroes. The Ultimen are incarcerated by Project Cadmus, but Long Shadow is allowed to remain with the Justice League thanks to the efforts of Wonder Woman and [[Batman]]. He doesn't appear after this point, and his fate is unrevealed. Numerous clones of Long Shadow and the Ultimen appear in "Panic in the Sky" when [[Galatea (Justice League Unlimited)|Galatea]] and the Ultimen army attack the [[Justice League Watchtower# Justice League|Watchtower]].

==In other media==
===Adult Swim===
====Harvey Birdman====
Apache Chief appears several times on ''[[Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law]]'', voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]]. He is one of the few heroes in the show to actually do superhero work, though he admits to taking various odd jobs to make ends meet (including, but not limited to, pornographic films). He first appears as the subject of the episode "[[List of Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law episodes#Very Personal Injury|Very Personal Injury]]". He spills hot coffee on his lap, preventing him from "[[erection|growing larger]]", a [[double entendre]] that becomes a [[running gag]]. He tries to sue the coffee shop that served the drink (a parody of [[Liebeck v. McDonald's Restaurants|Liebeck v. McDonald's Corp.]]), but the case is dropped when a beautiful witness makes an impassioned speech in court about his plight, causing him to become so "excited" that his power returns. He also makes several sporadic appearances in the background of other episodes, and now has a deep fear of coffee and other hot liquids.

====Robot Chicken====
In the episode of ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' titled "S&M Present," [[Britney Spears]] and her pop-music minions merge together into a giant in order to fight a [[Pat Morita]]-trained [[Joey Fatone]], and "Inuk-chuk!" can be heard as they combine.

====Family Guy====
Apache Chief had a cameo in the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode "[[PTV (Family Guy episode)|PTV]]", helping [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] place a satellite dish on his roof. Afterwards, having nothing else to do, he dejectedly says, "that was the high point of my day" and decides to go gamble. In "[[Love Blactually]]", [[Glenn Quagmire]] uses the same catchphrase in reference to his penis, which is then implied to enlarge with the sound effects that accompany the phrase.

===Toys===
It was revealed at the 2009 [[New York Comic Con]] that Apache Chief, along with Black Vulcan and Samurai, will be released in a 3-pack in the ''Justice League Unlimited'' toyline.
