'''Apache Chief''' is a fictional [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[superhero]] from the various ''[[Super Friends]]'' cartoons created by [[Hanna-Barbera]]. He was one of the new heroes added during the 1977 series ''[[The All-New Super Friends Hour]]'' (along with [[Black Vulcan]], [[Rima|Rima the Jungle Girl]], [[El Dorado (superhero)|El Dorado]] and [[Samurai (Super Friends)|Samurai]]) to increase the number of non-[[White people|white]] characters in the Super Friends ranks. He was voiced by [[Michael Rye]].

In the ''[[Challenge of the Super Friends]]'' Series, Apache Chief was seen in every episode except one, but had spoken lines in nine out of the sixteen episodes of the series. His arch enemy from the [[Legion of Doom (comics)|Legion of Doom]] was [[Giganta]], who also happens to be an original arch enemy of [[Wonder Woman]].

==Fictional character biography==
By speaking the word "Inyuk-chuk" ("Big Man"), Apache Chief could grow to vast sizes. The limit to this ability has never been revealed, but in an episode titled "Colossus", Apache Chief "Inyuk-chuks" himself to cosmic proportions to battle the Colossus, a titanic space creature that plucked Earth from its orbit and placed it in a small (relative to him) glass bottle. He also spoke in [[stereotype|stereotypical]] "Native American English" and recited vaguely Native American [[philosophy]]. In some episodes it was shown that he had a superhuman tracking ability as well.

Apache Chief's origin, related in an episode of the animated series, was thus: While still a young brave, he went for a walk with the chief of his tribe. The two men are quickly attacked by a bear, but the chief - recognizing that the young brave might be ready for a test such as this - gives the younger man a pouch of a special magic dust, which will amplify the user's thoughts and abilities a hundredfold. The young man resolves to be strong and brave (heeding the chief's advice that whatever is in his mind at the time, the dust will amplify), and upon sprinkling himself with the dust and invoking the magic phrase "Inuk-chuk", grows a hundred times larger, stronger and braver. He disposes of the bear, without violence, proving that he has passed the test. (Unfortunately, a passerby witnesses the entire affair and steals the dust, using it on herself - and becomes the evil [[Giganta]].)

===In relation to the mainstream DC Comics universe===
Apache Chief does not appear in the mainstream [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]], but a somewhat similar character called [[Manitou Raven]] was created as an homage to him and joined the [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] [[Justice League|JLA]]. Like Apache Chief, Manitou Raven, and later, Manitou's widow, [[Manitou Dawn]], have both been seen to say 'Inyuk-chuk' when casting spells or invoking powers.

==Other versions==
The character '''Long Shadow''' from the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' series is based directly on him. He has the ability to grow and expand his body to astronomical sizes increasing his strength. Later, he gained enhanced hearing. He has been a member of the [[Ultimen]].

Long Shadow seemed to have the most innocence and had a pacifist quality that caught the eye of [[Wonder Woman]]. He also was the only member of the Ultimen that showed interest in joining the Justice League. Long Shadow would be the first to find out that he and the Ultimen were cloned. He told the rest of the Ultimen and they later found out that they were scientifically created and their bodies were deteriorating. While his teammates were blinded by rage and fought the Justice League, he was trying to save people from the chaos the fighting caused. He eventually got [[Wind Dragon]] to stop fighting while the others had been defeated. The other Ultimen were incarcerated and he would have forcibly gone with them if not for Wonder Woman and more notably [[Batman]]. From that moment until however long he had, implied to be a matter of days, Long Shadow became a member of the Justice League. He apparently died as he is not shown with the other members in "Panic In the Sky" as they fight the Ultimen clones or maybe injured and still alive.

==In other media==
Apache Chief appears several times on ''[[Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law]]'' voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]]. He is one of the few heroes in the show to actually do superhero work, though he admits to taking various odd jobs to make ends meet (including, but not limited to, pornographic films). He first appears as the subject of the episode "[[List of Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law episodes#Very Personal Injury|Very Personal Injury]]". He spills hot coffee on his lap, preventing him from "[[erection|growing larger]]", a double entendre that becomes a running gag. He tries to sue the coffee shop that served the drink (a parody of [[Liebeck v. McDonald's Restaurants|Liebeck v. McDonald's Corp.]]), but the case is dropped when a beautiful witness makes an impassioned speech in court about his plight, causing him to become so "excited" that his power returns. He also makes several sporadic appearances in the background of other episodes, and now has a deep fear of coffee.

In the episode of ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' titled "S&M Present," [[Britney Spears]] and her pop-music minions merge together into a giant in order to fight a [[Pat Morita]]-trained [[Joey Fatone]], and "Inuk-chuk!" can be heard as they combine.

Apache Chief had a cameo in the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode "[[PTV (Family Guy episode)|PTV]]", helping [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] place a satellite dish on his roof, although his catch phrase sounds more like "In-a-chuck" instead of the correct "Inuk-chuck" Afterwards, having nothing else to do, he dejectedly says, "that was the high point of my day" and decides to go gamble.

Also, in "Love Blactually", Quagmire uses the same catchphrase talking about his penis, and sound effects imply that it was also growing.
