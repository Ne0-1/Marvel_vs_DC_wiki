'''Apache Chief''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] from the [[animated series]] ''[[Super Friends]]''.  He was one of the "[[affirmative action]]" characters created later in the series exclusively to make the show appear more universal and inclusive. Apache Chief does not appear in the mainstream [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]], but a somewhat similar character called [[Manitou Raven]] was a member of the [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] [[Justice League|JLA]].

By speaking the word "Inuk-chuk," ("Big Man") Apache Chief could grow to vast sizes. He could also speak in [[stereotype|stereotypical]] "Indian English" and recite vaguely [[Native American]] [[philosophy]]. In an episode titled "Colossus," Apache Chief "Inuk-chuks" himself to cosmic proportions to battle the Colossus, a titanic space creature that plucked Earth from its orbit and placed it in a small (relative to him) glass bottle.
