'''Spoor (Andrew Hamish Grave)''' is a fictional [[comic book]] character appearing in [[Marvel Comics]]. He first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #300 and was a member of the [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]]. His real name was established in ''Excalibur''  #89. Spoor is a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] with the ability to secrete pheromones, allowing him to control others. 

==Fictional character biography==
Andrew Hamish Grave's mutation was already visible at a young age. His father was abusive and blamed the child's mother for birthing a mutant. He killed his wife and told the child that his mother had left them. His father forced the child to eat garbage and when he grew up, he developed an intense hatred of both himself and all humans. He discovered his mutant power to release mood-altering pheromones, allowing him to control others and used these powers to have people kill each other. 

Taking the name Spoor, he was recruited by [[Fabian Cortez]] into the [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]], a group of mutants following the philosophy of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] that mutants are superior to humans. As part of the Acolytes, Spoor was involved in an attack on a hospital and killed many human patients. In a fight with the the British X-team called [[Excalibur]], Spoor tried to manipulate [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] into killing him, but Nightcrawler managed to resist. It turned out that Spoor hated himself just as much as other humans and in his mind felt that killing humans was wrong and that he therefore deserved to be killed himself.

For a time, he was a prisoner of Excalibur and stayed on [[Muir Island]]. Excalibur-ally [[Ahab (comics)|Doctor Rory Campbell]] wanted to cure Spoor, but during the treatment Rory's latent hatred of mutants got the better of him and Spoor manipulated Rory into an aggressive attack on him. The automatic security systems in Spoor's cell, known as the Pen, activated and a laser beam severed one of Campbell's legs. Spoor remained on Muir Island for a while, but was then transferred to a facility on the main land. He later escaped and went to [[Genosha]], which was by that time ruled by [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. Later, he could have died in the [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinel]] attack on the island, though that is uncertain at this point. 

He may also have been among the majority of mutants who lost their powers after the House of M storyline (M-Day), should he have survived the assault on Genosha.

==Powers and abilities==
Spoor's primary ability was his production of mood-altering, airborne pheromones that heightened the aggression of others around him. He could direct this aggression, but would often leave it uncontrolled, hoping that his victims would turn against him as well. His physical mutations, possibly bestial in nature, thickly covered his whole body with long hair and may have possibly given him superhuman animal-like abilities.
