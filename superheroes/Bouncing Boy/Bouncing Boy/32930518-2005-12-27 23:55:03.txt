'''Bouncing Boy''' is a fictional character in the [[DC Universe]], a member of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] in the 30th century. He is Chuck Taine of [[Earth]] and he has the power to inflate like a ball and bounce. He got his powers when he accidentally drank a super plastic formula which he thought was a soda pop. He first appeared in [[Action Comics]] 276 (May 1961).

He married fellow Legionnaire [[Duo Damsel]] in Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes # 200 and then left active service as a Legionnaire to become a Legion reservist, appearing only sporadically thereafter until [[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]].

In the post Zero Hour reboot continuity he was Charles Foster Taine (Chuck for short) who was the Legion's resident [[architect]] and engineer. He never got bouncing powers in this continuity, and was only an honourary member of the Legion.

He has yet to appear in the most recent reimagining (2004).
