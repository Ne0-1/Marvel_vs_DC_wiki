'''Bouncing Boy''' is a fictional character which originated in the [[comic book]]s of the [[DC Universe]], a member of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] in the 30th century. He is '''Chuck Taine''' of [[Earth]], and he has the power to inflate like a ball and bounce. He received his powers when he accidentally drank a super plastic formula which he thought was [[soda pop]]. He first appeared in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #276 (May [[1961]]).

He married fellow Legionnaire [[Duo Damsel]] in ''[[Superboy]]'' #200 and then left active service as a Legionnaire to become a Legion reservist, appearing only sporadically thereafter until [[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]].

In the post Zero Hour reboot continuity, he was Charles Foster Taine (Chuck for short) who was the Legion's resident [[architect]] and [[engineering|engineer]]. He has not received bouncing powers in this continuity and was only an honorary member of the Legion.  As a maintenance man, he once built a specialty vehicle called the "Bouncing Boy" which acted as a bouncing [[juggernaut]], smashing anything in its way.

The name "Charles Foster Taine" is a reference to the classic [[1941]] [[feature film]], ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' and its title character, Charles Foster Kane.

He has yet to appear in the most recent reimagining, which began in [[2004]].
