'''Immortal Man''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] a [[comic book]] [[superhero]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]], featured in issues #177 (June 1965; his first appearance), #185, #190 and #198 of ''[[Strange Adventures]]''. He was a member of the [[Forgotten Heroes]] and in fact was instrumental in the group's creation.  

== Fictional character biography ==
In the days of [[prehistory]], [[Upper Paleolithic|50,000 BC]], the Immortal Man was a caveman from the Bear Tribe, and would later approach the same meteorite that gave the [[supervillain]] [[Vandal Savage]] his own immortality. Fashioning an amulet out of the meteorite, and wearing it around his neck, the Immortal Man discovered it had granted him the power of resurrection. Accordingly, the pair have opposed each other ever since then.

In his first appearance Immortal Man was an orphan named Mark with a mysterious past; eventually he finds out that he is capable of instantly [[reincarnation|reincarnating]] in a new (usually or always fully-grown) body every time he dies.

Ultimately, the Immortal Man erased himself from existence to save the world during the Crisis on Infinite Earths. However, Mitch Shelley, the [[Resurrection Man]], an amnesiac with similar powers, took over as Savage's nemesis, and Shelley's latest appearance, in [[Supergirl]] #28, alluded to the fact that he was also 50,000 years old.

His latest appearances were in issues #26 and #27 of ''Resurrection Man''.

== Powers and abilities ==
The Immortal Man possessed the power to resurrect as a new persona every time he is killed.
