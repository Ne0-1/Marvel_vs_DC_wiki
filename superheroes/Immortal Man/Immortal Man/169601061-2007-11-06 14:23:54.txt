'''''Immortal Man''''' is a [[superhero]] in the fictional [[DC Universe]], featured in issues 177 (June 1965; his first appearance), 185, 190 and 198 of ''[[Strange Adventures]]''.  He was a member of the [[Forgotten Heroes]] and in fact was instrumental in the group's creation.  

He was originally from anciently prehistoric times when he became immortal when he examined a fragment of the same mysterious meteor that also gave the [[supervillain]], [[Vandal Savage]], his own immortality.  Accordingly, the pair have opposed each other since then.

His latest appearances were in issues #26 and #27 of ''[[Resurrection Man]]'', a character with whom he shares some concept similarities.

In his first appearance Immortal Man was an orphan named Mark with a mysterious past; eventually he finds out that he is capable of instantly [[reincarnation|reincarnating]] in a new (usually or always fully-grown) body every time he dies.
