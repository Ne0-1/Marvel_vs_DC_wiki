'''Immortal Man''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] a [[comic book]] [[superhero]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]], featured in issues #177 (June 1965; his first appearance), #185, #190 and #198 of ''[[Strange Adventures]]''. He was a member of the [[Forgotten Heroes]] and in fact was instrumental in the group's creation.  

== Fictional character biography ==
In the days of [[prehistory]], [[Upper Paleolithic|50,000 BC]], the Immortal Man was a caveman from the Bear Tribe, and would later approach the same meteorite that gave the [[supervillain]] [[Vandal Savage]] his own immortality. Fashioning an amulet out of the meteorite, and wearing it around his neck, the Immortal Man discovered it had granted him the power of resurrection. Accordingly, the pair have opposed each other ever since then.

In his first appearance Immortal Man was an orphan named Mark with a mysterious past; eventually he finds out that he is capable of instantly [[reincarnation|reincarnating]] in a new (usually or always fully-grown) body every time he dies.

Ultimately, the Immortal Man erased himself from existence to save the world during the Crisis on Infinite Earths. However, Mitch Shelley, the [[Resurrection Man]], an amnesiac with similar powers, took over as Savage's nemesis, and Shelley's latest appearance, in [[Supergirl]] #28, alluded to the fact that he was also 50,000 yrs old.

His latest appearances were in issues #26 and #27 of ''Resurrection Man''. Here it was revealed that Vandal Savage had imprisoned him for some time before the events in these issues. When an experiment involving another meteorite went wrong, Savage freed  the Immortal Man to help him alongside Mitch Shelley and the Forgotten Heroes. In the end, the Immortal Man sacrificed himself to stop a creature that was causing time anomalies to occur, vanishing into thin air along with creature.

The Immortal Man was recently seen in they year 20XX where he currently is in a century long battle with his past self.
The Battle began when Future Immortal Man was attempting to Drop from space and land on a building, destroying the building in the process.  The Past Immortal Man knowing that if Future Immortal man was successful would destroy the time line countered this attack with an uppercut knocking the Future Immortal Man back into space.

== Powers and abilities ==
The Immortal Man possessed the power to resurrect as a new persona every time he is killed. He also possessed some telekinetic and telepathic powers, as well as some minor pyrokinetic talents.

He uses a hydrogen bomb to propel himself into outerspace.
There he flys around the sun to travel through time.
