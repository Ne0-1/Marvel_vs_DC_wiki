'''Amanda Sefton''' (real name '''Jimaine Szardos'''), also known as '''Daytripper''' and the second '''Magik''', is a [[fictional character]] and witch in the [[Marvel Universe]]. She is the foster sister and former lover of Kurt Wagner, [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] of the X-Men.

==Fictional biography==
Jimaine and her mother [[Margali Szardos|Margali]] are [[witch]]es.  When Nightcrawler joined the X-Men, Jimaine followed him, assumed the identity of '''Amanda Sefton''', took a job as a flight attendant, and became Nightcrawler's girlfriend.  When Margali attacked the X-Men, believing Nightcrawler to have been responsible for the death of Stefan Szardos, her son and Jimaine's brother, "Amanda" revealed herself as Jimaine, convinced her mother to let Kurt live and resumed her on-and-off relationship with him.

Years later, Jimaine having fully [[anglicisation|anglicized]] her name to Amanda joined an interim team of "X-Men" that was organized at [[Moira MacTaggert|Moira MacTaggert's]] [[Muir Island]] facility, and eventually came to join [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] under the codename '''Daytripper'''. During this time, she obtained the [[Soulsword]] from Shadowcat and after Excalibur's dissolution she came to rule [[Magik (comics)|Magik's]] [[Limbo (comics)#Demonic Limbo|Limbo]] (not to be confused with [[Immortus|Immortus']] Limbo) and took the title of '''Magik''' for herself.[[Image:Amandasefton.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Amanda Sefton]]

She remains an ally of the X-Men, particularly Nightcrawler.

==Other media==
In ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'', a character named Amanda Sefton appears as Nightcrawler's love interest, though she didn't have the background of her comic counterpart.  She is portrayed as a normal human girl of African-American heritage, with knowledge and interest in Nightcrawler's powers and looks, who nevertheless accepts Kurt completely despite his mutancy. In her first episode, "Shadow Dance", Amanda asks Kurt to be her date for the school dance and tells him that she did have a crush on him for months but was too shy to tell him, and that her feelings remained after she once accidentally saw him turn off his image inducer. She was played by [[Moneca Stori]].
