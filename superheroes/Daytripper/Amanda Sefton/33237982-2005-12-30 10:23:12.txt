'''Amanda Sefton''' (real name '''Jimaine Szardos'''), also known as '''Daytripper''' and the second '''Magik''', is a [[fictional character]] and witch in the [[Marvel Universe]]. She is the foster sister and former lover of Kurt Wagner, [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] of the X-Men.

==Biography==

Amanda and her mother Margali are [[witch]]es.  When Nightcrawler joined the X-Men, Jimaine followed him, assuming the identity of '''Amanda Sefton''' and became his girlfriend.  When Margali attacked the X-Men, believing Nightcrawler to have been responsible for the death of Stefan Szardos, her son and Jimaine's brother, "Amanda" revealed herself as Jimaine, convinced her mother to let Kurt live and resumed her on-and-off relationship with him.

Years later, Jimaine having fully [[anglicisation|anglicized]] her name to Amanda joined an interim team of "X-Men" that was organized at [[Moira MacTaggert|Moira MacTaggert's]] [[Muir Island]] facility, and eventually came to join [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] under the codename '''Daytripper'''. During this time, she obtained the Soulsword from Shadowcat and after Excalibur's dissolution she came to rule [[Magik (comics)|Magik's]] Limbo not to be confused with [[Immortus|Immortus']] Limbo) and took the title of '''Magik''' for herself.

She remains an ally of the X-Men, particularly Nightcrawler.
