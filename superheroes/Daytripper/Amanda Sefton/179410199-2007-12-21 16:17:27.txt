'''Amanda Sefton''' (real name '''Jimaine Szardos''') (also known as '''Daytripper''' and the second '''Magik''') is a [[fictional character]], a witch in the [[Marvel Universe]]. She is the foster sister and former lover of Kurt Wagner, [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] of the X-Men.

==Publication history==
As Magik, Amanda had her own four-issue limited series.  The series focused on her taking-over Limbo.  The series also featured her adopted brother/lover, Nightcrawler.

==Fictional character biography==
Jimaine and her mother [[Margali Szardos|Margali]] are [[witch]]es.  When Nightcrawler joined the X-Men, Jimaine followed him, assumed the identity of '''Amanda Sefton''', took a job as a flight attendant, and became Nightcrawler's girlfriend.  When Margali attacked the X-Men, believing Nightcrawler to have been responsible for the death of Stefan Szardos, her son and Jimaine's brother, "Amanda" revealed herself as Jimaine, convinced her mother to let Kurt live and resumed her on-and-off relationship with him.

===Daytripper===
Years later, Jimaine having fully [[Anglicisation|anglicized]] her name to Amanda joined an interim team of "X-Men" that was organized at [[Moira MacTaggert|Moira MacTaggert's]] [[Muir Island]] facility, and eventually came to join [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] under the codename '''Daytripper'''. During this time, she obtained the [[Soulsword]] from [[Shadowcat (comics)|Shadowcat]].  It was later revealed that it was not Amanda who had taken the Soulsword but her mother, who had used it to kill all those ahead of her on the Winding Path.  Margali later switched bodies with Amanda who was later captured by Belasco.  Nightcrawler and Margali subsequently defeated Belasco, rescued Amanda, and mother and daughter were restored to their rightful bodies.

===Becoming Magik II===
Afterwards, Amanda decided not to return to earth with Kurt but instead agreed to rule Limbo [[Magik (comics)|Magik's]] [[Limbo (comics)#Demonic Limbo|Limbo]] (not to be confused with [[Immortus|Immortus']] Limbo) and took the title of '''Magik''' for herself, as there was no-one else to protect the realm which would have left Earth open to demon invasion.  As Limbo's latest guardian, Amanda Sefton also inherited Illyana Rasputin's Soulsword and control of the stepping discs allowing access to Limbo.[[Image:Amandasefton.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Amanda Sefton]]

She remains an ally of the X-Men, particularly Nightcrawler, and even chose Kurt to be the vessel in which Illyana's Soulsword could be kept. She believed that Kurt's soul was the purest that she could find.

===Driven out of Limbo===
Amanda recently resurfaced in ''New X-Men'' when she plunged out of a dimensional portal in a blast of flaming energy and landed in a small German village. She was quoted as saying ''"Help me...someone please...He's back."'' It was revealed that Amanda was driven out of Limbo after being overwhelmed by an invasion led by Belasco, and that she was no longer in possession of the Soulsword<ref>''New X-Men'' vol. 2 #37</ref>. She assisted New X-Men Hellion and Surge as well as O*N*E sentinel operative (and former mutant) [[Alexander_Lexington|Lex]] in finding students that were kidnapped by Belasco. The students were saved due to Illyana Rasputin usurping control of Limbo. Once the heroes were teleported back to Xavier's school though, Amanda found Limbo to be sealed off.<ref>"New X-Men" vol. 2 #41</ref>.

==Other versions==
===Days of Future Past===
*In the [[Days of Future Past]] timeline, Amanda had a daughter [[Blue (Comics)|Blue]] who inherited her father Nightcrawler's appearance, and similar teleporting powers. As seen in ''Uncanny X-Men #188'', Amanda and Nightcrawler, along with that timeline's version of Illyana were gunned down by a government strikeforce deployed to destroy the Xavier Institute after [[Senator Robert Kelly]] was assassinated.

===Marvel Mangaverse===
*In the [[Marvel Mangaverse]] setting Amanda Sefton is a dark sorceress, who uses [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] to battle the electromagnetic demon [[Magneto (comics)|Magnus]].

==In other media==
===Television===
In ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'', a character named Amanda Sefton appears as Nightcrawler's love interest, though she didn't have the background of her comic counterpart (Her mother's name's still Margali, but the Seftons look like a normal black American family).  She is portrayed as a normal human girl of African-American heritage, with knowledge and interest in Nightcrawler's powers and looks, who nevertheless accepts Kurt completely despite his mutancy. In her first episode, "Shadow Dance", Amanda asks Kurt to be her date for the school dance and tells him that she did have a crush on him for months but was too shy to tell him, and that her feelings remained after she once accidentally saw him turn off his image inducer. She was voiced by [[Moneca Stori]].
