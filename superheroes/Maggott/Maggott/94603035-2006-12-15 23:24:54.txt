'''Maggott,''' who went by the name '''Japheth,''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]] who was briefly a member of the [[X-Men]]. Created by writer [[Scott Lobdell]] and [[Joe Madureira]], he first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #345 ([[1997#June|June 1997]]).

A flamboyant [[South Africa]]n [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] who spoke in exaggerated [[Afrikaans]] [[slang]], Maggott was advertised as one of the strangest X-Men. His digestive system took the form of two [[slug]]s which could eat through practically any substance. After feeding, the slugs reentered Maggott's [[abdomen]] and passed nourishment into him, making him super strong.

Created by [[Scott Lobdell]] and [[Joe Madureira]], Maggott first appeared in ''Uncanny X-Men #345'' (June [[1997]]), as a mysterious mutant, searching out the X-Men’s adversary [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] for an unknown reason. His search led to [[Antarctica]] where Magneto was holding the X-Men captive. Maggott then joined up with the team and returned with them to their [[Westchester, New York]] headquarters.

At first, he kept his past to himself, but Maggott eventually revealed his origin to [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] in ''X-Men'' #76 (June [[1998]]).  Maggott had been born a sickly child in [[Apartheid]]-era [[South Africa]] and was named Japheth.  He was always very ill and he could not digest solid food.  Feeling himself to be a burden on his family, he ran away from home with his younger brother.  Having left home, hoping to die, he was found by Magneto who released the slugs from his body and revealed to Japheth his mutant power.  This turned his skin blue. He named the slugs Eany and Meany. When the slugs re-enter his body, it causes Maggott severe pain; as a result, he later sought Magneto again for help in easing the pain. Shortly afterwards, the X-Man [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] suggested Maggott transfer to the junior team [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]], but his tenure there lasted only one issue and afterwards he fell out of sight. 

Maggott reappeared as an inmate at “Neverland,” a [[concentration camp]] run by the covert government program [[Weapon X]]. He was exterminated there in ''Weapon X'' #5.
One of his slugs, which he gave away to two children at the camp after foreseeing his death, thanks to his psychometric powers (probably a secondary mutation), at the camp, was last seen in a container in [[Mister Sinister|Mr. Sinister's]] laboratory.

==Powers==
*Digestive system replaced by a hollow cavity that houses a pair of semi-sentient slugs called Eany and Meany who bore their way out of his chest and then use powerful enzymes to chew and digest any solid object in their path, transmitting food energy back to their host to supercharge his physical strength and stamina while turning his skin blue, but the slugs must reenter through his chest and release their storage internally to feed his body properly.
*Unexplained psychometric power enables him to draw psychic imprints from his environment, replaying in his mind's-eye events which once took place in his general vicinity.
