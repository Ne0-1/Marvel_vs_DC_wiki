'''Maggott''' is a [[mutant]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]] who was briefly affiliated with the [[X-Men]]. A bizarre mutant who often spoke in exaggerated [[Afrikaans]] [[slang]], Maggott’s digestive system took the form of two merchanical [[slug]]s named [[eeny, meeny, miny, moe|Eany and Meany]], which could eat through practically any substance. After feeding, the slugs reentered Maggott through his [[abdomen]] and passed their nourishment unto Maggott making him super strong. Maggott could also psychically perceive recent past events that had happened in an area only by being physically present in that area. He is currently deceased.

===History===
Created by [[Scott Lobdell]] and [[Joe Madureira]], Maggott first appeared in ''Uncanny X-Men #349'' ([[November 1997]]), as a mysterious mutant, searching out the X-Men’s adversary [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] for an unknown reason. His search led to [[Antartica]] where Magneto was holding the X-Men captive. Maggott then joined up with the team and returned with them to their [[Westchester, New York]] headquarters.

At first, he kept his past to himself, but Maggott eventually revealed his origin to his teammates in ''X-Men'' #76 ([[June 1998]]). Maggott had been born a sickly child in [[Apartheid]]-era [[South Africa]] and was named Japeth. He was always very ill and he could not digest solid food. Feeling himself to be a burden on his family, he ran away from home. Having left home, he was found by Magneto who released the slugs from his body and revealed to Jaseph his mutant power. When the slugs re-enter his body, it causes Maggott severe pain; as a result, he later sought Magneto again for help in easing the pain.

Shortly afterwards, the X-Man [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] suggested Maggott transfer to the junior team [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]], but his tenure there lasted only one issue and afterwards he fell out of sight. 

Maggott reappeared as an inmate at “Neverland,” a [[concentration camp]] run by the covert government program [[Weapon X]]. He was exterminated there in ''Weapon X'' #5 ([[March 2003]].
