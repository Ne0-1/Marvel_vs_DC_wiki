'''Captain Nazi''' is a [[Fawcett Comics]] and [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]], a rival of [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] and [[Captain Marvel, Jr.]] He was created by [[Bill Woolfolk]] and [[Mac Raboy]]

The super-strong Captain Nazi (real name '''Albrecht Krieger''') was genetically altered and developed into the "perfect specimen" in order to fight for [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Axis Powers]] during [[World War II]]. Nazi first appeared in ''[[Master Comics]]'' #21 ([[December]] [[1941]]), in opposition to both Captain Marvel and [[Bulletman]]. During the second half of his battle with Marvel in ''Whiz Comics'' #25 (published the same month), Nazi attacks two innocent bystanders who happened to be fishing near the scene of the battle. One of them, an old man, is killed, but the old man's teenage grandson Freddy Freeman is saved by Captain Marvel and becomes [[Captain Marvel, Jr.]] Junior, crippled in his Freddy Freeman form by the attack, continued to hold a vendetta against Nazi, and the two frequently battled one another. Nazi also served as a member of [[Mister Mind]]'s [[Monster Society of Evil]].

Nazi appeared only sporadically in the [[1970s]]/[[1980s]] revival of the [[Marvel Family]] characters under the title ''Shazam!'' He was introduced into the modern [[DC Universe]] in [[Jerry Ordway]]'s ''The Power of Shazam!'' series in [[1995]]. Issues #6&ndash;8 of the ''Power of Shazam'' series retell the story of Nazi's murder of Freddy's grandfather, his crippling of Freddy, and Freddy's emergence as Marvel, Jr. and attempted revenge on Nazi. In the modern series, Nazi had been active during the [[1940s]], battling WWII-era heroes such as Bulletman, [[Minute-Man]], and [[Spy Smasher]], but placed himself in [[suspended animation]] so that he could emerge in modern society and revive the [[Third Reich]]. Captain Nazi eventually joined Lex Luthor's new [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] as seen in the miniseries ''[[Villains United]],'' where he was working with them to torture the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]]. He was then blinded during the escape of the Secret Six when [[Catman]] plunged some syringes into his eyes.

Captain Nazi met his apparent end in ''[[Batman]]'' #647 while fighting Batman and The [[Red Hood]]. The Captain and two other Society members had been lent out to the villain [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]] to aid his attempt to assassinate The Red Hood. During the fight, The Red Hood seemingly killed Captain Nazi by jamming a [[taser]]-like weapon into his cybernetic eyes, although this seems an unlikely end for such a powerful character.
