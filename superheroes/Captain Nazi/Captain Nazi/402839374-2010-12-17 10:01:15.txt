==Fictional character biography==
===Fawcett Comics===
The super-strong Captain Nazi was genetically altered by his scientist father, and developed into the "perfect specimen" in order to fight for [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Axis Powers]] during [[World War II]]. He is given superhuman strength and stamina, and a special flying gas allows him to fly. He is sent to battle American superheroes by the Nazis after his power is demonstrated to them by Hitler. Nazi first appeared in ''[[Master Comics]]'' #21 (December 1941), in opposition to both Captain Marvel and [[Bulletman]]. During the second half of his battle with Marvel in ''Whiz Comics'' #25 (published the same month), Nazi attacks two innocent bystanders who happened to be fishing near the scene of the battle, after they pull him out of the lake and escapes in their boat. One of them, an old man named Jacob Freeman, is killed, but the old man's teenage grandson, Freddy Freeman, is saved by Captain Marvel although he is crippled and his back broken with an oar while Nazi escapes in the boat, but due to Captain Marvel bestowing part of his power to him, Freddy becomes [[Captain Marvel, Jr.]] He is then sent to defeat Captain Nazi by Captain Marvel.

Junior, crippled in his Freddy Freeman form by the attack, continues to hold a vendetta against Nazi, and the two frequently battle one another. Nazi also serves as a member of [[Mister Mind]]'s [[Monster Society of Evil]], one of the most powerful organisations of villains in the world which included Adolf Hitler, and assists their first plan to steal magic fortune-telling pearls from a princess and leading Captain Marvel to their existance, during the WWII years, before making his final Fawcett Comics appearance in ''Captain Marvel, Jr.'' #14 in 1944.

===DC Comics===

Art by [[Jerry Ordway]].]]Captain Nazi appeared only sporadically in [[DC Comics]]' 1970s/1980s revival of the [[Marvel Family]] characters under the title ''Shazam!'', save for reprints of the original Fawcett stories. Nazi's first appearance in a new DC Comics story was in ''Shazam!'' #34 (March- April 1978).

Following writer [[Roy Thomas]] and artist [[Tom Mandrake]]'s new interpretation of the Captain Marvel mythos in the 1987 four-issue miniseries ''[[Shazam: The New Beginning]]'', Captain Nazi was re-introduced in a 1988 four-part story in ''[[Action_Comics_Weekly#Action_Comics_Weekly_.281988-1989.29|Action Comics Weekly]]'' #s 623-626. Captain Nazi himself, however, only appeared in #s 624-626. The story was written by Thomas and his wife [[Dann Thomas]], with art by [[Rick Stasi]] and [[Rick Magyar]]. The new Captain Nazi is a young [[Neo-Nazi]] named Lester Abernathy. Abernathy is given his "Captain Nazi" powers, costume and codename by a Neo-Nazi organization called the Sons of [[Valhalla]] and battles Captain Marvel<ref>http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=45162</ref><ref>http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=45178</ref><ref>http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=45295</ref><ref>http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=45299</ref>. This version of the character made no further appearances and was subsequently [[retcon]]ned out of existence by the 1994 ''The Power of Shazam!'' graphic novel, which again altered Captain Marvel's background and continuity. 

Captain Nazi was introduced into the modern [[DC Universe]] in [[Jerry Ordway]]'s ''The Power of Shazam!'' series in 1995. In the modern series, Nazi had been active during the 1940s, battling WWII-era heroes such as Bulletman, [[Minute-Man]], and [[Spy Smasher]], but placed himself in [[suspended animation]] so that he could emerge in modern society and revive the [[Third Reich]]. He believed Hitler's body to be held in a similar chamber. Nazi's brother, scientist Wolf Krieger, and his granddaughter, a super-powered villainess named Madame Libertine who possesses mind-controlling powers, carry on Nazi's legacy in the 1990s and resurrect their hero from his suspended animation chamber in ''Power of Shazam!'' #5.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

Issues #6&ndash;8 of the ''Power of Shazam'' series retell the story of Nazi's murder of Freddy's grandfather by throwing him a great distance with his superhuman strength, his crippling of Freddy, and Freddy's emergence as Marvel, Jr. and attempted revenge on Nazi. His life was actually saved by Freddy who believed the figure who fell into the lake was Captain Marvel. After the Marvel Family captures and defeats Nazi, he is sent to [[Europe]] to be tried for war crimes committed during World War II.

Captain Nazi eventually joins Lex Luthor's new [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] as seen in the miniseries ''[[Villains United]],'' where he works with them to torture the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]]. He is blinded during the escape of the Secret Six when [[Catman (comics)|Catman]] plunges syringes into his eyes.

Captain Nazi meets his apparent end in ''[[Batman]]'' #647 while fighting Batman and the [[Jason Todd|Red Hood]]. The Captain, now sporting cybernetic eyes following his injury in ''Villains United'', has been lent out to the villain [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]] to assassinate the Red Hood alongside follow Society members [[Deathstroke]] and [[Hyena (comics)|the Hyena]]. During the fight, the Red Hood apparently kills Captain Nazi by jamming a [[taser]]-like weapon into his cybernetic eyes (the only vulnerable part of his body). In ''Villains United Special'' #1 however, it is revealed that Nazi has survived. At the behest of the Society, Nazi appeared in [[Kahndaq]] to release all of the captives in its prisons and fights Khandaq's ruler and former Secret Society member, [[Black Adam]]. During the battle, Black Adam confronts Nazi about how he seemingly survived being killed, at which time Captain Nazi cryptically proclaims that previous origins about him were wrong and that the villain isn't even human; that he is the living avatar of National Socialism given physical form and that so long as there are Nazis in existence, he will exist. Despite this claim, Black Adam easily defeats Captain Nazi.

He has since appeared as leader of a Nazi-themed team in ''[[Justice Society of America]]'' named "The Fourth Reich" after the "[[One Year Later]]" jump, and is an opponent of [[Wonder Woman]] in 'The Circle', sporting a generic black costume.

==In other media==
In an episode of ''[[Justice League Unlimited]],'' Captain Nazi made a round-about appearance. During a flashback sequence, a character who looks very similar to Captain Nazi is prevented from taking a super-soldier serum by [[Fawcett Comics]] hero [[Spy Smasher]]. It is later revealed that the serum was created for "'''Project Captain Nazi'''." [[General Wade Eiling]] broke into [[Project Cadmus|Cadmus Labs]] and injected himself with the mutated serum. He then went on a rampage against the Justice League. The idea of a [[supersoldier|super-soldier]] serum in a WWII-era setting is very similar to the premise of [[Captain America]].
