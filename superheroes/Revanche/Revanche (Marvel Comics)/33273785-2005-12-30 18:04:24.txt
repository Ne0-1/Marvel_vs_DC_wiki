[[Image:revanche2.jpg|left]]Kwannon was a young ninja, who worked for the Japanese crimelord Nyorin.[[Image:revanche.jpg|right]]Kwannon went brain-dead after a battle with her lover and the [[Hand]] leader, Matsu'o Tsurayaba the opposite force to her clan.
With the  magic of Mandarin rings and the Hand methods, Matsuo intended to restore Kwannon's mind with the memory-les mind of Betsy Braddock, the british caucasian x-man, that just emerged from the [[Siege Perilous]]. In fact, as further revealed, [[Spiral]]'s sabotage made the two body's exchange physical and mind traits, and the two of them became like siamese twins. Spiral's assistance also caused the two minds to switch bodies. The(healed) body of Kwannon got Elizabeth Braddock's mind, and Kwannon's mind went into Psylocke's British body.

Calling herself Revanche, an amnesic Kwannon ran into the X-men, claiming herself to be the true Betsy Braddock. As the team headed back to Japan, they discovered the truth about the body swap and and that Psylocke wasn't an impostor.

Revanche joined the x-men for a while, but died soon after cotracting the legacy virus. At her grave in Japan, Elizabeth and Matsu'o left the following epitah: "KWANNON,LOVE THAT TRANSCENDED BODY AND SOUL"
A interesting point and a trade mark of this character is that Revanche went blind after taking her own eyes out after discorvering they were the bionic cameras that [[Mojo]] planted in Psylocke's body when she was his slave.
