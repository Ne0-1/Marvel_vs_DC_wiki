'''Kevin MacTaggert''' is a [[comic book]] [[fictional character]], a [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]], in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He was a [[supervillain]], most known for his brief stand against the [[X-Men]]. He was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne]], in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #125 (September 1979).

==Character biography==
Proteus is one of the strongest and deadliest mutants ever to appear in Marvel Comics. Despite being one of the most powerful mutants, Proteus was not fortunate enough to have a happy life. Even his conception was under unpleasant circumstances. He was the son of [[Moira MacTaggert]] and her sinister husband, Joseph MacTaggert, who forced Moira into an unhappy marriage. Kevin was conceived after his mother, Moira, took a severe beating from his father, Joseph. After this traumatic experience, Moira left Joseph. Moira didn't even notify him that she was pregnant with his child.

Moira and Kevin lived on [[Muir Island]], off the coast of [[Scotland]]. Kevin eventually began manifesting his mutant abilities and became a danger to everyone around him. His abilities gave him an uncontrollable hunger for energy. To protect himself and others, Moira was forced to confine Kevin. To keep the truth about her son secret, she began to describe him to others only as ''Mutant X.''

For years, Kevin remained inside his cell. Until one day, after a battle between [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] and the X-Men, Kevin was able to escape. During his escape, Kevin came into contact with [[Phoenix (comics)|Phoenix]], [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]], and [[Multiple Man]] and was able to easily defeat them. (This wasn't a small feat.) The only problem was, without the energy fields of his cell, Kevin began to burn his body out. The only temporary solution he could find was to possess several human host bodies, including a dupe of Multiple Man's.

Kevin eventually encountered the X-Men and proceeded to rename himself as Proteus, after the [[Proteus|greek god]]. Proteus eventually went to [[Edinburgh]], to possess his father, Joseph. After possessing his father, Proteus made a last stand against the X-Men. He destroyed the body of Joseph MacTaggert in battle. Before he could take another host, [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] punched his energy form, with his bare fist. Due to his weakness to metal, Proteus wasn't able to keep his energy form together, thus dispersing his energy across the world. Some time after his death, Moira MacTaggert even thought about [[cloning]] him, but was talked out of it, by [[Banshee (comics)|Sean Cassidy]].

Several years later, [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] attempted to recreate Proteus. The organization used a woman named Harness and her mutant son, Piecemeal, to absorb all of the dispered energy of Proteus. As the boy went about absorbing the energy, his body grew too large for his system to handle. Eventually, what was left of Proteus [[consciousness]] and Piecemeal merged as one being.

The combined efforts of the [[New Warriors]], the [[New Mutants]], the Muir Islanders, and the original [[X-Factor]] wasn't enough against this new creature. It wasn't until the creature decided that it wouldn't find happiness that it decided to disappear.

==Powers and abilities==
Proteus is a being made out of psionic energy. Due to being made out of psionic energy, Proteus also possesses some [[Telepathy|telepathic]] abilities. Proteus also has the ability to possess human bodies. Eventually, these human bodies "burn out", due to the nature of his powerful energies. He has powerful [[Reality warper|reality-warping powers]], able to practically change the face of the world by pure force of will. For example, he can easily turn a standing building into liquid. Proteus' main weaknesses was to metal, such as Colossus' organic metal. 

The combined Proteus and Piecemeal creature wasn't vulnerable to metal and didn't have the need for host bodies.

==Other versions==
===House of M===
When the [[Scarlet Witch]] re-shaped [[Earth-616]], Proteus was resurrected as the evil serial killer 'Mutant X', who stole bodies across two continents. He eventually found refuge in the [[Exiles (comics)|Exiles]]' [[Mimic (Exiles)|Mimic]], and actually managed to escape the [[House of M]], by stealing data from the Panoptichron. He's currently traveling through the [[multiverse]], now in the body of Justice from the [[New Universe]].

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, Kevin MacTaggart was the son of Moira MacTaggart and her ex-husband [[Professor X]]. Like in the mainstream version, he escaped his mother's keep on Muir Island and sought to kill his father, this time thus Charles Xavier. But before he could finish his deadly vendetta, [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] mercy-killed him by crushing him under a car.
