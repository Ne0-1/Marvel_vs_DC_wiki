==Fictional character biography==
===MC2===
In the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] universe, Hope Pym and her twin brother [[Big Man (comics)|Big Man]] (Henry Pym Jr.) became outraged when people began referring to A-Next as the "next generation" of Avengers after the deaths of their parents. Using their parents' fortune, the twins put together the supervillain [[Revengers]] team and gained access to the [[Avengers Mansion]] via their parents' security codes.<ref>''A-Next'' #7</ref> When they ambushed A-Next, Hope set about to torture [[Cassandra Lang]], feeling that she's the Avengers' rightful heir. Hope was finally stopped by Henry, preventing her from initiating the mansion's self-destruct sequence, which would have killed both A-Next and the Revengers.<ref>''A-Next'' #12</ref>

===616===
Nadia Pym is revealed to be Hank Pym's daughter with Maria Trovaya. When Maria was abducted and supposedly killed by foreign agents, Nadia was to be raised in the [[Red Room (comics)|Red Room]] until the day she obtained a Pym Particle sample that enabled her to escape. Upon heading to where her father lived, Nadia learned about what happened to Hank and used some parts of her father's costume and some materials laying around where she created a new version of the Wasp suit. As the second Wasp, Nadia plans to obtain the admiration of her father's allies. After earning the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]' trusts after stabilizing the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], [[Edwin Jarvis]] took Nadia on a road trip to meet her extended family.<ref>''All-New, All-Different Avengers'' #9</ref>
