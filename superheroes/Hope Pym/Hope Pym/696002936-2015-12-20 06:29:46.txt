==Fictional character biography==
After the deaths of their parents, Hope Pym and her twin brother [[Big Man]] (Henry Pym Jr.) became outraged when people began referring to A-Next as the "next generation of Avengers". Using their parents' fortune, the twins put together the supervillain [[Revengers]] team and gained access to the [[Avengers Mansion]] via their parents' security codes.{{issue|date=April 2015}} When they ambushed A-Next, Hope set about to torture [[Cassandra Lang]], feeling that she's the Avengers' rightful heir.{{issue|date=April 2015}} Hope was finally stopped by Henry and prevented her from initiating the mansion's self-destruct sequence, which would have killed both A-Next and the Revengers.{{issue|date=April 2015}}

==Powers and abilities==
As Red Queen, she uses implanted bio-wings to fly. Also, she has bio-electric blasters installed on the gloves on the back of her hands, and extendable claws built into her gloves. However, she apparently does not have the ability to alter her size.{{issue|date=August 2015}}
