After the deaths of their parents, Hope Pym and her twin brother [[Big Man (comics)|Big Man]] (Henry Pym, Jr.) became outraged when people began referring to A-Next as the "next generation" of Avengers.

**Hope first appeared in the 2015 film ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]''. She is the daughter of [[Hank Pym]] and [[Wasp (comics)|Janet van Dyne]], who worked for [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] as Ant-Man and the Wasp respectively. When Hope was seven, Janet seemingly perished in the Quantum Realm while on a mission, which resulted in Hank distancing himself from his daughter and straining their relationship. Hope eventually gained a position on the board of her father's company, Pym Technologies, and voted him out. Sometime later, the company's new head, [[Darren Cross]], revealed he was making significant progress in recreating Hank's Pym Particles. Concerned about the technology's potential military applications, Hope reluctantly allies herself with her father to stop him, with the idea she would use his Ant-Man suit, only for Hank for to bring in former thief [[Scott Lang (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Scott Lang]] to take on his mantle instead. While she was initially resentful of Scott, she gradually warms up to him and eventually enters a relationship with him before making amends with her father. After they defeat Cross, Hank presents Hope an advanced prototype Wasp suit that he and Janet had been working on and suggests that they finish it together.
**Hope next appears in the 2018 sequel ''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]'', in which she has adopted the Wasp identity. As a result of Scott violating the [[Sokovia Accords]] during the events of ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'', she and Hank have been on the run for two years all while attempting to create a bridge to the Quantum Realm to rescue Janet after discovering Scott became [[quantum entanglement|quantumly entangled]] with her following his fight with Cross. Throughout the mission, Hope and Scott grow closer despite what he did and work together to fight off enemies like [[Sonny Burch]] and [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]]. In the film's mid-credits scene, Hope, Hank, and Janet are disintegrated as a result of [[Thanos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thanos]]'s actions in ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]''.
**Hope returns in ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'',<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.syfy.com/syfywire/watch-evangeline-lilly-introducing-wasp-when-shell-join-avengers|title=Watch: Evangeline Lilly on introducing the Wasp, when she'll join The Avengers|last=Avila|first=Mike|work=Syfy|access-date=2017-07-24|language=en}}</ref> having been resurrected five years later by [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]] when he used the [[Infinity Stones]] to undo Thanos' actions.
