'''Machine Man''' ('''X-51''') is a [[fictional character]] created by writer/artist [[Jack Kirby]] for [[Marvel Comics]]. The character, an [[android]], was created in ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (comics)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' #8 (July 1977), a comic written and drawn by Kirby featuring concepts based on the eponymous [[Stanley Kubrick]] film and [[Arthur C. Clarke]] novel.  Shortly thereafter, Machine Man spun off into his own Kirby-created series.

==Publication history==
===Volume 1===
Machine Man originally appeared in the pages of ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (comics)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' #8 (July 1977), which was written and drawn by [[Jack Kirby]]. He would go on to appear in his own self-titled series in 1978. 

This title featured Machine Man entering the mainstream Marvel Universe. Jack Kirby wrote and drew the first nine issues, which dealt with the title character's status as a fugitive from the military after the death of his creator, and his first interactions with mankind. The book was cancelled at the end of 1978 with X-51 finally standing up to the military.

Machine Man appeared next in a three issue story arc within the pages of The Incredible Hulk #235-237.  The robot found himself battling the green giant within the suburban setting of his human friend, Dr. Peter Spaulding.  By the end of the storyline, he incurred a complete system shutdown, leading to the events portrayed in his relaunched monthly series. 

The title was re-launched in issue #10 after a nine-month hiatus. Status quo in the book changed with Machine Man now living amongst humanity, and dealing with his own new-found emotions. [[Marv Wolfman]] came aboard as the new writer, partnered with artist [[Steve Ditko]], which helped set a different tone from Kirby's previous stories. Issue 15 saw a new writer, [[Tom DeFalco]], taking over the writing chores. The title lasted until issue #19, ending in February 1980.

===Volume 2===
[[Image:MachineMan2020.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Cover to ''Machine Man'' volume 2 #1 (1984). Art by [[Barry Windsor-Smith]]]] In October 1984 - January 1985, the Machine Man title was resurrected, in a four-issue [[mini-series]] written by [[Tom DeFalco]] with art by [[Herb Trimpe]] (breakdowns only, issues #1-3) and [[Barry Windsor-Smith]] (finishes only, issues #1-3 & full art for issue #4), with Windsor-Smith also coloring the entire mini-series & co-plotting issue #4 with DeFalco. This series turned out to be one of the most popular of all the Machine Man titles, tying with previous continuity, but with the action set in the distant [[cyberpunk]] future of 2020, starting with Machine Man's reassembly.

The mini-series was first reprinted as a 96 page [[trade paperback]] in 1988 (ISBN 0-07135-458-6), with brand new cover art by [[Barry Windsor-Smith]]. 

The mini-series was republished again in 1994 as two double-size books, with the name ''Machine Man 2020''. Characters from this alternate future have made appearances in other Marvel books, namely Arno Stark, the mercenary [[Iron Man 2020]].

In 1990, Machine Man guest-starred in ''Iron Man Annual'' #11 (part of the "Terminus Factor" storyline).  That story created strong hints that the 2020 Machine Man may turn out not to be the true X-51, but instead a duplicate created by Sunset Bain. {{-}}

In 2005, Marvel published a series entitled ''[[Machine Teen]]'', under their [[Marvel Next]] imprint. While the robotic main character of that book, Adam Aaronson, was unconnected to Aaron Stack within the story, the book explored similar themes.

==Fictional character biography==
Machine Man, whose real name is X-51, was the last of a series of sentient robots created by robotics expert Dr. Abel Stack for the US Army. However, all previous 50 experimental robots went mad as they achieved [[sentience]] and  became [[Psychosis|psychotic]], due to a lack of identity. X-51 was the only survivor, as he was treated as a son by Stack and given a human face mask as well as being exposed to one of the [[The Monolith|monolith]]s from [[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001]]. After Stack died trying to protect him, X-51 assumed the human name Aaron Stack and escaped confinement, only to be relentlessly pursued by the army. While on the run, the newly-christened Machine Man (''Mister Machine'' in his very first appearances) initiated contact with humanity in order to better understand it.

After being captured and later freed, Machine Man was found by psychiatrist Peter Spaulding and mechanic Gears Garvin. They set-up Machine Man with a human identity as Aaron Stack, insurance salesman for the Delmar Insurance Company, but he continued having superhero adventures on the side. In a meeting with the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] of the [[Fantastic Four]], he also found and fell in love with another sentient robot, [[Jocasta (comics)|Jocasta]], before she was destroyed by [[Ultron]].

In more recent appearances, he has fought alongside the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], which lead to the invitation to become a team reservist. Later he was captured by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], who wanted to use his technology to create another [[Deathlok]]. He helps the [[X-Men]] and [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Douglock]] against the villainous [[Red Skull]], who had taken over the [[Helicarrier]] where Machine Man was held. 

He helped the X-Men again against [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]] and his [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]]. As a consequence, he was infected by Sentinel programming, assuming a more robotic look in the subsequent series ''X-51'', and losing self-control whenever he was faced with a mutant. During this series he was on the run from [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]], who wants his technology for himself. Because of his new programming, while seeking aid from the Avengers, he attacks [[Vance Astrovik|Justice]] and [[Firestar]]. Because of his actions against Justice and Firestar, X-51's membership in the Avengers is revoked. At the end of ''X-51'', X-51 encountered one of the monoliths and disappeared, brought into the presence of the monolith's creators, the cosmic beings known as the [[Celestials]]. 

===''Nextwave: Agents of H.A.T.E.''===
[[Warren Ellis]] and [[Stuart Immonen]]'s ''[[Nextwave]]'' series sees Machine Man join a team formed by the Highest Anti-Terrorism Effort, or [[H.A.T.E.]] (a subsidiary of the [[Beyond Corporation©]]) to fight Bizarre Weapons of Mass Destruction. Now preferring simply to be called Aaron, Machine Man is partnered with [[Monica Rambeau]], [[Tabitha Smith]], [[Elsa Bloodstone]] and [[The Captain (comics)|The Captain]], and the team soon discovers that H.A.T.E. are funded by the Beyond Corporation©, leading them to go rogue and carry out their mission on their own prerogative.

Calling humans "fleshy ones" and expressing a degree of pride in his "roboty parts" - which he uses to kill [[Fin Fang Foom]] - Aaron has developed a fondness for alcohol, stating "My robot brain needs beer" on regular occasions. He is not especially popular with his teammates because of his self-important attitude, and as is learned in a flashback that after being brought to space by the Celestials at the conclusion of his previous series, he was dumped back on Earth because the space-gods considered him to be a "complete and utter ☠☠☠☠."  He appears to have a rather serious attraction to Elsa Bloodstone and stares at her chest constantly, much to her chagrin.

Despite the appearance of Nextwave characters in other Marvel titles, in 2006 Editor-in-Chief [[Joe Quesada]] stated that Nextwave's setting was in a universe separate from the main Marvel continuity.<ref>Wade Gum (2006-07-01). "Heroes Con: Joe Quesada Panel", http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/000765389.cfm</ref> However, recent issues of [[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]], as well as [[Civil War: Battle Damage Report]], consistently place Nextwave's activities in mainstream continuity.

<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Aaronsleepswithmsmarvel.jpg|left|thumb|Aaron, Sleepwalker, and Ms. Marvel.]] -->

===Civil War/The Initiative===
Aaron has been identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes who appear on the [[:Image:Avengers Initiavive number 1.jpeg|solicited cover]] of the comic book  ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]''<ref>[http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 Avengers: The Initiative #1 Character Map]</ref>. They have as yet not been assigned a State, nor is it known whether the Fifty-First State that Nextwave had conquered by the end of their series exists in the regular Marvel Continuity, nor whether it would be counted as part of a Fifty-State Initiative if it did exist.

Machine Man appears in a flashback in ''Iron Man/Captain America: Casualties of War''. In trying to convince [[Captain America]] of the rightness of his position, Iron Man tells of the time Machine Man came to visit him. Whatever reason why had been forgotten because Iron Man was simply drunk. While drunk, he attacks Machine Man and almost kills two of his own employees. At the last possible second, Machine Man's extendable arm pushes them out of the way. Iron Man uses this incident as the need for accountabillity in the superhero population.

Aaron and [[Sleepwalker (comics)|Sleepwalker]] are recruited to aid [[Ms. Marvel]] in finding her team-mate [[Araña]]. In the promotional cover for this appearance, he is in the costume which he wore during ''Nextwave''. <ref>[http://marvel.com/catalog/?book_id=7109 Ms. Marvel #18, Marvel's August Solicitations]</ref>  He reveals that Agent [[Maria Hill]] from S.H.I.E.L.D. offered him financial compensation to join the Initiative, frustrating Ms. Marvel, who had supported it from the beginning, for free.  He spends much of his time in Chile and aboard the Minicarrier 13, Ms. Marvel's headquarters at the time, antagonizing and criticizing every available agent.

==Powers and abilities==
Machine Man is powered by solar energy. He can also draw power from several different external energy sources, if needed. Machine Man has telescoping arms & legs. His fingers contain a different variety of weapons, projecting heat, cold or electricity. He has the ability of flight through the means of anti-gravity disks.

In Nextwave, he has become a living [[Swiss Army knife]] of sorts, containing various tools and weapons for a multitude of situations, both useful and esoteric.  When asked if he could impregnate a human woman from several feet away, Aaron simply states "I am full of very useful devices."

==Other versions==
===Delmar Insurance===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Aaronheadless.jpg|left|thumb|Insurance Adjustor Aaron answers a call, headless, in ''Nextwave'' #10.]] -->
In ''[[Nextwave]]'' #10, [[Forbush Man]] forced each member of Nextwave to experience life in 'Forbush Vision'; they were cursed to suffer in a boring or mundane personal [[hell]]. Aaron's nightmare was life as an insurance adjustor for Delmar Insurance in Central City, USA. Bashing his head into a personal computer several times out of depression, he decapitated himself...only to answer the phone a moment later. Stack was freed from the nightmare by the intervention of fellow Nextwave member [[Tabitha Smith]].

===Machine Man 2020===
Machine Man was reactivated in the year 2020 by a group of outlaw scavengers called Midnight Wreckers (led by X-51's old friend Gears Garvin), and forced to battle his old enemy, the industrialist ice queen [[Sunset Bain]], as well as mercenary Arno Stark, the amoral Iron Man of 2020. In ''[[Earth X|Paradise X: Heralds]]'' #1 , [[Iron Man 2020]] claimed to the Earth X Machine Man that he had killed Machine Man 2020.
It is possible that this Machine Man was actually a copy made by Sunset Bain in Iron Man Annual #11.

===Earth X===
Machine Man was also one of the main characters of the [[Earth X]] trilogy. Transformed by a [[monolith]] into a transparent version himself, Aaron was forced to become the new Watcher by a blind [[Uatu]], the previous Watcher, who had not viewed any event on the planet for 20 years. Tricking Uatu, who had attempted to force Machine Man to reject his humanity, Machine Man managed to use his access to Watcher technology and data to help humanity defeat the coming [[Celestials]], by revealing to Earth's superhero community the true origins of mankind. After defeating the Celestials, Machine Man used his newfound position to contact parallel Earths to help them eradicate the Celestial menace.

===Queen's Vengeance===
When [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fay]] restructured reality in volume three of ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #1-3, nearly all Avengers, past and present, were transformed into the Queen's Vengeance, a sort of medieval-themed Avengers. Machine Man became Sir MacHinery, an obvious play on the word [[machinery]]. He can be seen on the cover of issue #2, behind [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]].

==In other media==
===Television===
In the ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited]]'' animated TV series, Machine Man is an old robot that once served the [[High Evolutionary]]. [[Spider-Man]] saved him from disassembly in the 5th episode ("''Steel Cold Heart''"), and he joined forces with Spider-Man and the Human Rebels in their struggle against the High Evolutionary's regime. This robot is one of a group of Machine Men, who switches sides after not wanting to be scrapped following serious damage in a battle. He is known as X-51, and the design of these machine men is somewhat reminiscent of the original Machine Man, especially in terms of color and abilities. However, they are substantially bulkier than Machine Man's human sized physique, drawing inspiration from the design of the [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]] from [[X-Men]].

===Music===
The song [[Mega!! Kung Fu Radio|"Public Menace, Freak, Human Fly"]] by [[Powerman 5000]] has the lyrics
::"I know a machine man, he's X-51.
::Harder than steel,
::His fists, they're like machine guns."

Another song by Powerman 5000 is titled [[Tonight the Stars Revolt!|"Son Of X-51"]].
