'''Pip the Troll''' is a [[fictional character]] who appears in publications of [[Marvel Comics]].  He was '''Prince Gofern''', an [[extraterrestrial life|alien]] of the Laxadazian race who became mutated into a stunted, [[satyr]]-like form during a bout of drunkenness brought on by a [[mutagen]]ic [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogen]]. 

Pip is a frequent companion of [[Adam Warlock]], and was a member of the [[Infinity Watch]], which protected the [[Infinity Gems]]. Pip guarded the [[Space Gem]], keeping it between his toes for safekeeping. The gem gave him the ability to [[teleport]] which he often used for his own ends, stealing the [[Fantastic Four|Fantastic Car]] and other objects. He has also used his teleportation ability for combat but usually flees larger battles. 

Although Pip has been seen rarely since the Infinity Watch disbanded, he appeared in ''[[Marvel: The End]]'' and ''[[She-Hulk]]''.
