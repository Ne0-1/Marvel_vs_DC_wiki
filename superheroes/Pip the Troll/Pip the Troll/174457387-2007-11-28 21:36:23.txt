'''Pip the Troll'''  is a [[fictional character]] who appears in publications of [[Marvel Comics]]. He was '''Prince Gofern''', an [[extraterrestrial life|alien]] of the [[List of Marvel Comics alien races#L|Laxidazian]] race who enjoyed painting pictures of the night sky. 

==Fictional character biography==
Pip became mutated into a stunted, [[satyr]]-like form during a bout of drunkenness brought on by a [[mutagen]]ic [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogen]]. After his transformation, his people, also sick of his lewd behaviour, strip him of his office and rank. He stows away on a spaceship and continues his life of debauchery. Pip began his habit of dressing in a pair of maroon, ripped pants and nothing else.

Missionaries from the [[Universal Church of Truth]] visit Pip's home planet and discover the trolls are resistant to the church's conversion process. All trolls are ordered killed. Pip himself is caught after making trouble on dozens of planets, many controlled by the church. He ends up on a ship full of men and women who were to be executed. There he meets [[Adam Warlock]], whose alternate future self the Magus would become the leader of the Church of Truth. Pip teamed up with Warlock to escape and go on adventures. Eventually the threat of the Magus was neutralized and Pip parted company with Adam on the world of Sirius X.

After getting into much more trouble, Pip decided to look for Adam again. Pip explored one of [[Thanos]]' old hideouts and discovered not Adam, but Thanos himself. He destroyed Pip's mind, but Adam was able to absorb his soul into the Soul Gem (killing his mindless body), where he resided for some time.<ref>Marvel Two-in-One Annual #2</ref>

===Infinity Watch===
Pip, along with the green-skinned [[Gamora]], returns to life during the [[Infinity Gauntlet]] incident by taking over bodies of three crash victims. Pip and Gamora were both shown to have significantly increased physical strength in their new bodies (''Infinity Watch'' #1). Afterwards, Pip was given the [[Space Gem]], keeping it between his toes for safekeeping. The gem gave him the ability to [[teleport]] to places he knows of. This he often used for his own ends, stealing the [[Fantastic Four|Fantastic Car]] and other objects. When forced into battle, he tends to appear directly above his adversary's head, intending to deliver a powerful blow. He has since lost the Space Gem, but his long-term exposure to it has given him the innate ability to teleport.

Pip and his friends end up setting shop on [[Monster Island]]. Pip takes too much as usual and abusing the hospitality of [[Mole Man]]. In a dispute over the sovereignty of the island, forces of the [[United Nations]] invade. Pip and the others hang back as Gamora cleans house, killing no one. The group makes bets on the fight.

Around this time, the events known as the [[Infinity War]] happen. When Warlock had control of the [[Infinity Gauntlet]], he had forced out the good and evil sides of himself. The evil side returns as Warlock's long-term adversary, the Magus. Pip is drawn into the fight when Thanos recruits the Watch. As most of Earth's heroes do not trust Thanos, Pip and his friends were forced to battle them as well. Eventually both sides work together to take down the Magus. 

Pip became deeply involved in the [[Infinity Crusade]]. He manages to be a capable 'leader' of the remnants of the Infinity Watch when various events took most of them away. [[Moondragon]], for example, is brainwashed and taken by the [[Goddess (comics)|Goddess]], the 'good' side of Adam Warlock. She is using a Cosmic Egg, the merging of several [[cosmic cube]]s, to implement her plans, which involve brainwashing dozens of superheros. Left on Monster Island with [[Maxam]] and [[Drax the Destroyer]], the three argue over who should lead. Pip decides to go outside the group for help and kidnaps [[Mister Fantastic]]. The leader of the Fantastic Four soon realizes what is going on and pitches in to help. This, and the kidnapping of other superheros, brings everyone together, Pip included, at Avenger's Mansion.  actually spurs on the heroic efforts of the rest of the super-powered community. Pip is spurred to create a new, 'super-heroic' costume, but he fails to wash himself while changing. His body odor is so offensive the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] forcibly bathes him.

===King of the Universe===
[[Professor X| Professor Xavier]] proceeds to make telepathic contact with one of the Goddess' thralls, Pip's former ally, [[Moondragon]]. Pip secretly touches Xavier and his powers make contact through the link, allowing him to know the location of the Goddess because Moondragon knows it. 

Pip teleports to it, in the center of the Goddess' planet, a new form of Counter-Earth. By touching the Cosmic Egg, Pip gains access to its near-infinite powers. He turns the Goddess into salt. He manifests a throne and sits upon it, musing as to what to do with his newfound powers. He reflects on many plans for Earth, such as making superpowered beings wash his car and changing all the females, including the overweight and elderly, into shapely, twenty-something women. One of his goals is, of course, to gain revenge on the Hulk for forcibly bathing him. Before he can implement any of his plans, he is subdued by the brainwashed guardian of the Egg, the female [[New Warriors]] member [[Silhouette (comics)|Silhouette]]. She had been hiding in a nearby container, for just this sort of situation.

Although Pip has been seen rarely since the Infinity Watch disbanded, he appears in ''[[Marvel: The End]]'' and ''[[She-Hulk]]''.

==In other media==
In the ''[[Silver Surfer (TV series)|Silver Surfer]]'' animated series, he is the close companion of [[Silver Surfer]], whom he follows on his quest to find Surfer's treasured homeworld Zenn-La.
