'''Cyclops (Scott Summers)''' is a [[fictional character]] who exists in the {{Marvel Universe}}, a [[superhero]] who is the field leader of the [[X-Men]]. Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist/co-writer [[Jack Kirby]], he first appeared in [[Uncanny X-Men|''X-Men'']] #1 ([[1963#September|September 1963]]) and was originally dubbed Slim Summers. By #3, his name was changed to Scott.

A [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]], Cyclops produces powerful "optic blasts" from his eyes, forcing him to wear specialized glasses at all times and a specialized visor in combat. His powers may have led to his inhibited, meticulous character. These same qualities, however, make him an ideal field leader for the X-Men and even teammates such as [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], who has deemed him an 'overgrown [[Scouting|Boy Scout]]', admire his leadership skills.

The first student recruited by [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]], and one of the original five X-Men, Cyclops has had a large presence in X-Men-related comics since their inception. He has been featured in almost every [[animation]] and [[video game]] adaptation of the team. [[James Marsden]] plays him in the [[X-Men (film)|recent film series]].

==Fictional character biography==
When Scott was a boy growing up in [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]], [[Alaska]], [[United States]], his father, [[USAF]] Major Christopher Summers, took the family for a flight in their airplane. It came under attack by an alien [[Shi'ar]] spaceship. As the plane went down in flames, Scott's parents fastened him and his younger brother Alex into a parachute and pushed them off the plane, in hopes that they would survive. Unfortunately, the parachute caught fire and Scott struck his head upon landing. This caused brain damage to Scott, which is supposedly responsible for his inability to control his optic blasts, as well as prolonged amnesia about his childhood. 

[[Image:cyclopsclassic.gif|thumb|left|150px|Cyclops firing an optic blast. Art by [[Jack Kirby]]]]Scott spent most of his childhood in an orphanage in [[Omaha, Nebraska]] and subjected to batteries of tests and experiments by the orphanage's owner, Mr. Milbury, an alias for the geneticist [[Mister Sinister]].

====The X-Men====
When he was sixteen, he was found by [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] and became one of his students and the first official X-Man. He soon graduated to become the team's field leader, a position he would traditionally hold over the years. When the other original X-Men (Angel, Beast, Iceman, Jean Grey, and later additions [[Havok]] (his own brother) and [[Polaris]]) decided to leave in light of the arrival of the new X-Men, which included Storm, Colossus, Nightcrawler and Wolverine, Cyclops stayed, feeling that he would never be able to lead a normal life because of the uncontrollable nature of his powers.

He had long believed that his parents had died in the plane accident. In fact, they had been captured and sold into slavery by the Shi'ar. As an adult member of the X-Men, Cyclops met his father, now known as [[Corsair (comics)|Corsair]], leader of the [[Starjammers]], a group of [[extraterrestrial life|aliens]] opposing what they saw as the tyranny of the [[Shi'ar]] empire. Several more years passed before the two learned of each other's true identities. He later came into contact with his grandparents, who are still alive and own a shipping company in Canada.

Cyclops had an on-again/off-again relationship with [[Jean Grey]] during their time in the X-Men, and when he refused to leave with the other senior members, feeling that the X-Men was the only place he truly belonged, she was deeply upset. For a long time, he actually couldn't work up the nerve to tell Jean how he felt about her, fearing that his optic blasts would hurt her - or anyone else he cared about for that matter - and also because he felt he was no match for his wealthy teammate [[Warren Worthington III]], a.k.a. Angel, who was also romantically interested in Jean. What Scott didn't know was that Jean actually had a crush on him, but she was too shy to make a move. 

This culminated in her tragic "death" as she tried to pilot a space shuttle through a solar flare, her rebirth as [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]] and her suicide on the Moon during a battle with the Shi'ar Imperial Guard. Cyclops left the X-Men for a while after this, drifting for several months until reunited with the team against [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. Not long after, Cyclops met [[Madelyne Pryor]], a woman bearing an uncanny resemblance to Jean Grey, and they married. After the marriage, the X-Men took in a mutant refugee from the future named [[Rachel Summers]]. 

It was later revealed that Rachel was the future daughter of Cyclops and Jean Grey. This revelation brought about some conflict between Scott and supposedly first-born Rachel once Madelyne was found to be pregnant with a son, Nathan Christopher Charles Summers, who was later sent into a future timeline to become the freedom fighter [[Cable (comics)|Cable]].

====X-Factor and Inferno====
However, the original Marvel Girl was not dead. The Phoenix identity turned out to be a cosmic entity who had supplanted her, placing her in a healing pod at the bottom of Jamaica Bay, to be eventually revived by [[Avengers (comics)|the Avengers]] and the [[Fantastic Four]]. Cyclops left his wife and son and returned to Jean. She joined with Cyclops and the other original X-Men as [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]].

The demons [[S'ym]] and [[N'astirh]] corrupted Madelyne's feelings of self-despair, transforming her into the Goblin Queen.  Madelyne sought revenge on Cyclops for leaving her.  When it was revealed that she was a clone created by [[Mr. Sinister]], essentially for the purpose of becoming a [[Horse breeding|brood mare]], Madelyne couldn't take it any more and killed herself. Scott then went on to pursue a romance with Jean.

====Marriage====
[[Image:Scottjeanmarriage.png|150px|Scott and Jean get married.  Art by [[Andy Kubert]].|right|thumb]]
Several years later, Scott Summers and Jean Grey finally married in front of all their friends and family. During their honeymoon, they were brought into the future where they raised Cable for the first 12 years of his life during the ''[[Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix]]'' miniseries. After helping Cable defeat Apocalypse, they were sent back to the past. Under the request of Rachel Summers, Jean assumed the Phoenix identity.

Sometime after their return, the X-Men were forced to battle their mentor when Professor Xavier was transformed into the evil [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]]. Although the X-Men defeated the evil entity and freed Xavier, the damage had been done and most of Earth's heroes were lost for a time. Xavier, who was left powerless after Onslaught's defeat, was arrested for his part, leaving Scott and Jean as leaders and co-headmasters of the school. However, the pair went into retirement following a battle against Operation: Zero Tolerance, in which Cyclops was gravely injured.

====Merging with Evil====
They returned to the X-Men some time after at the request of Storm, when she grew concerned about the mental well-being of Professor X (who had returned sometime prior). Their return then led to the events of the [[Apocalypse: The Twelve|The Twelve]]; in which [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] located twelve mutants which would power a machine to allow him to take the body of [[Nate Grey]], the X-Man. In order to save Nate, Cyclops willingly merged with the villain Apocalypse. He was believed lost for the better part of a year, until Jean and Cable tracked him down and were able to separate him from Apocalypse, apparently killing Apocalypse in the process.

====Return to the (New) X-Men====
Upon Cyclops' return to the X-Men following his possession, there was a rather drastic change in his personality. This change caused a rift to develop between Jean and himself, as he would claim that Apocalypse made him question not only their relationship, but his life as a whole. He was instrumental in preventing the mutant [[Xorn]]'s suicide and in recruiting the powerful mutant to the X-Men. Surprisingly, the two established a close friendship, an event almost unprecedented in Cyclops' personal history; similarly, repeated missions with Wolverine resulted in the growth of a tentative friendship between the two veteran X-Men.

When Jean began to show signs of the Phoenix Force again, the distance between the two grew larger and Scott began what others would dub his "celibacy kick." For her part, Jean refused to interact with him telepathically (despite his repeated requests that she do so) and it was intimated by other characters that she had secretly grown contemptuous of him, disgusted by what she perceived as his "weakness." Instead of attempting to reconcile with his estranged-wife, Scott turned to [[Emma Frost]], a former villain who had reformed and joined the X-Men. Their relationship ostensibly began as a series of psychic therapy sessions, but Emma took advantage of this situation to get closer to Scott. Under the guise of counseling him, she was able to instigate a telepathic affair.
[[Image:Jeanscottemma.png|150px|right|Jean walks in on Scott and Emma in an astral bed.  Art by Phil Jimenez.|thumb]]
When Phoenix discovered the affair, Cyclops made the claim that they had shared only thoughts and thus he had done nothing wrong. Meanwhile, Emma's snide jeers led Jean to psychically confront her; she forced Emma to admit her true feelings for Scott, and also come to terms with her many failures, sins and personal demons. Furious, Scott once again confronted Jean and demanded that she read his mind; Jean finally complied, only to discover that Scott and Emma had never actually engaged in any physical contact. Confused by this turn of events, Jean insisted to herself that their ''thinking'' about having an affair was equivalent to their actually having had one. Scott, however, had grown sick of the entire ordeal and subsequently left the X-Men to mull over what was happening to his life. He wandered the country for a while, patronizing the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]], keeping company with Wolverine and [[Fantomex]], and generally trying to escape the responsibilities, expectations and demands he felt were unjustly placed on him by the X-Men.

During his time with Wolverine, it was revealed that he felt his relationship with Jean had stagnated and that the two of them had not progressed romantically since their initial teenage romance. He also confessed that he felt that Jean refused to listen to him, and that his attraction to Emma had been due in large part to her more accepting nature. When he finally returned to the X-Men, the sentient DNA known as John Sublime had taken control of the original Xorn who, under the guise of Magneto, attacked the X-Men. Having at last reached full Phoenix power, Jean confronted the Faux-Magneto and was killed in the process. Before she died, she urged Cyclops to live on.

Scott, however, felt devastated by the death of his wife, and considered leaving the X-Men once more. It was revealed in the ''[[Here Comes Tomorrow]]'' storyline that, had he done so, it would have led to an apocalyptic future. To prevent this, a resurrected, future-version of Jean used her powers as the White Phoenix of the Crown and telepathically nudged Cyclops into a real relationship with Emma. Together, the pair rebuilt the Xavier Institute as co-headmasters.

The new relationship between Emma and Scott has led to problems between them and the rest of the X-Men, all of whom believe that the pair are doing Jean's memory a disservice. [[Rachel Summers]] in particular has felt hurt and angry by her father's lack of remorse for hurting Jean before her death and took on the last name of Grey in place of Summers.

Cyclops also tutors a squad at the institute called the Corsairs, named after Cyclops’ father.  The team consists of Dryad, Quill, Specter and the three remaining [[Stepford Cuckoos]].  

====M-Day Aftermath====
Recently, in the series ''[[X-Men: Deadly Genesis]]'', a mysterious villain attacked and easily defeated several members of the team, including Cyclops and his alternate-reality daughter, [[Rachel Summers|Rachel]]. The two were captured and taken to an undisclosed location, which Cyclops vaguely remembered visiting in the past. Eventually managing to free themselves, Cyclops and Rachel attempted to escape, only to run into their captor (revealed to be named [[Vulcan (comics)|Vulcan]]), who informed Cyclops that he was the X-Man's younger brother. A powerless Professor Xavier confirmed this information in the final book of the mini-series. This new information has left Cyclops resentful towards his mentor and has gone so far as to demand that Xavier leave the school as it is no longer 'his'.

====Astonishing X-Men====
Deciding that the X-Men need to play more of a role in emergency rescue and aid, and thus garner attention on mutants in a more positive light where mutant abilities are used for the good of people, Cyclops has hand-picked a team in order to get out into the world more. This team recently faced an alien named [[Ord (comics)|Ord of the Breakworld]]. The team subdued Ord, but not before learning that one of their own will be responsible for the destruction of Ord's homeworld in the coming year, leaving the X-Men divided.

In ''[[Astonishing X-Men]]'' #14, during an impromptu telepathic "therapy session", Emma Frost presented Cyclops with the possibility that his lack of control over his optic blasts actually stems not from physical brain damage, but from a sort of mental block that the young Scott imposed upon himself after the combined traumas of the loss of his parents, separation from his brother, and shocking manifestation of his powers; this is seen as a coping mechanism, giving Scott something to focus on and try to maintain some sort of control over at a time when events completely out of his control had effectively shattered the life he had led up to that point.

Surprisingly, Scott seems to admit that this theory is the truth of the matter, further admitting that he had even blocked making this decision out of his memory, to preserve the fallacy in his own mind and prevent others from discovering his "secret".  The issue ends with Scott apparently in a catatonic state, with his eyes uncovered and displaying their natural shade of brown, with no evidence of his powers manifesting.

{{spoiler}}
[[Image:Cyclopsgun.jpg|150px|Scott shoots Perfection in the back.  Art by [[John Cassaday]].|right|thumb]]
Apparently Emma was right: a fully recovered Cyclops rose in the issue 17 from his catatonic state to shoot [[Perfection (comics)|Perfection]] in the back with a [[pistol]]. However it has not been established in the comic yet whether Cyclops has full control of his power or has been rendered completely powerless. In a interview with [[Joss Whedon]] in the [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] 182, when asked if Cyclops didn't have his powers any more after Emma psychically manipulated him, Whedon replied that "No, he doesn't have his powers. Well, he had a choice to either be completely out of control or bury them. He can't use them. That's pretty much it. But the thing that would be fun is that, with no powers, he's going to be the best that he's ever been. That's what the arc is about. [Cyclops has] been the team leader and the team washout in terms of popularity. He was defined by Jean so much, and I just think that this guy is so interesting in his struggle against mediocrity. Then, when it's all laid on the line, when you find out the thing that's been holding him back from being just a complete bad ass has been himself all his life, that he's been lying to everyone, including himself, about who he is-that should be freeing. The Scott we're going to see is going to be a little bit different. This guy is either completely out of control or in control of something we're not used to. I wanted him to be an unabashed tough guy. He is shooting people and turning very much into a leader. Not everyone is going to like it."

Although it is unclear if Cyclops was aware that he was shooting Perfection, or whether his intention was indeed to shoot Emma, a case can be made that he believes it to be Emma since,  while shooting Perfection, he replies to Emma's earlier comment to him in an earlier issue about him not having claws (i.e., in the context of him being jealous of Wolverine).

At the end of the arc Cyclops states when he was in a catatonic state he was still fully conscious and saw the fight between Colossus and Shaw - revealling that Colossus wasn't really fighting anyone but Emma's own disordered mind. He also attempted to help Emma get over her [[survivor's guilt]], speculated by Scott as being the basis for the recent manifestations of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]].

===Relationships===
Although being type-cast as the sensible, stiff loner, Cyclops has had several serious relationships. Unfortunately, most if not all of them have ended poorly. One striking feature is the fact that he seems irresistible to women with [[telepathic]] abilities. He was married to both [[Jean Grey]] and her [[Clone (genetics)|clone]] [[Madelyne Pryor]], who both proved to have Omega-class telepathy and telekinesis; his latest girlfriend, [[Emma Frost]], is a telepath as well. [[Psylocke]], another psi talent, once blatantly tried to seduce him, although this could have been due to the subtle influences of the ninja assassin [[Revanche]]'s personality that were still in her mind at the time. 

He has also dated non-mutant women. Cyclops (during a time in which he thought Jean was dead) went on a date with [[Colleen Wing]] and then he briefly dated [[Lee Forrester]] prior to meeting [[Madelyne Pryor]].

When he married Madelyne Pryor, Scott had thought he had found a replacement for Jean. Over time however, he realized that while Maddie looked like Jean, it was not her emotionally. Scott then began to emotionally distance himself, while fixating unhealthily on Jean. Scott would later leave Maddie and their child, upon hearing of Jean's return.

When Cyclops married Jean Grey, fans assumed that Cyclops had reached a happy ending. However, following his brief period possessed by Apocalypse, Cyclops returned to the X-Men, feeling that his long-time love/obsession with Jean was a lie. Using Jean's expanding mental powers as an excuse, Cyclops began having sexual therapy sessions with Emma Frost, and that led to a telepathic affair between the two. When Jean confronted Scott, he made the claim that it had only been thoughts which they shared and thus he had done nothing wrong. Scott then left the X-Men for a time to understand his own conflicting feelings. He returned to tell Emma that he had made a decision between her and Jean, but Jean was killed by Magneto before it was revealed which woman he had picked. A dying Jean told Scott that she understood and urged him to live.

Following Jean's death, Scott considered leaving the X-Men, having been disillusioned with Xavier's dream. This outcome would have led to an apocalyptic future. To avoid it, Jean, using her Phoenix Powers, pushed Scott past the guilt he felt over her death. Scott then accepted Emma's offer of reopening the school with her. The two have since been together, however there have been some problems with their relationship, particularly in light of the recent [[House of M]] storyline and the events involving the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club's]] return.

==Powers and abilities==
Cyclops is a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]], capable of projecting powerful beams of concussive force from his eyes. The beams derive their power from sunlight; Cyclops' cells are constantly absorbing solar energy and transferring it to his eyes, which in turn serve as apertures which project extra-dimensional non-Einsteinian particles in beam form (in some stories, this means that his powers do not work when he is separated from the sunlight). Contrary to popular misconception, Scott's optic blasts do not project heat (like [[laser]]s); rather, the beam generates pressure which can pummel and subsequently, if desired, destroy objects. It was through this use of his power that Scott ensured the survival of himself and his brother when their parachute failed, by softening the ground beneath them.

[[Image:Xmen1lee.jpg||thumb|150px|Cyclops (middle character from top) appears on one of the four covers of ''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #1.  Art by Jim Lee]]
Suffering a head injury in this unorthodox landing, Scott was left unable to consciously control his powers - his optic beams are now constantly "on," and will project indefinitely when his eyes are open. This is different in many versions, because according to the Uncanny X-Men timeline, if Cyclops uses his powers for too long, he will become weak and run out of energy, using the Sun's energy to revitalize the beams once his visor is closed. However, as Scott's psionic field is in tune with the energy of his beams, and as this field envelops his body, he is immune to the harmful effects of his own powers, causing the beams to dissipate harmlessly if they should come into contact with his body. Hence, he is able to block the beams simply by closing his eyes, with even the thin material of his eyelids being able to block his beams. To allow him to function in day-to-day life, Scott wears a set of eyeglasses made of [[ruby]] [[quartz]], a material which is resonant to his psionic field, and hence blocks his beams in a similar fashion. In combat, Cyclops uses a specialized ruby quartz visor (built with a single, long lens, hence Summers' alias "Cyclops") housing adjustable [[aperture]]s that allow him to control the size and intensity of the beams. Originally, Cyclops had to physically reach for controls on the visor itself for desired firings, but later models had controls wired to his gloves for more convenient use. In addition, the visor has a back-up spring-loaded function to shut its apertures in the event of a power loss while opened so he can at least see safely.

The maximum force of Cyclops' optic blasts are unknown, but a common example is that he can "punch holes through mountains" and rupture a half-inch thick carbon steel plate. During a particular battle, Scott says that he hit Cain Marko (a.k.a. the Juggernaut) with enough power to split a small planet, though he may have been indulging in hyperbole. In the mainstream continuity of the Marvel Universe, it has also been implied that Cyclops only utilizes a fraction of the energies at his disposal. During the ''Civil War: X-Men'' story arc, Cyclops is controlled by another mutant to use his powers at their full magnitude. When directed at the energy-absorbing mutant [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]], Cyclops was able to overload Bishop's powers in a matter of seconds. It is also stated that Cyclops does not use his powers at such a level due to the preoccupation he has regarding his control (or lack thereof) of his abilities.

Cyplops is also immune to the superheated [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] projected by his brother [[Havok]]. This excess energy merely serves to further charge his cells. Whether Cyclops is immune to other sources of heat has never been determined. 

Emma Frost has stated that Scott can't control his power due to a combination of factors, including a conscious decision to not to excerise control, the loss of his parents, being separated from his brother, and later having head injuries.  



===Skills===
Cyclops seems to possess an uncanny sense of [[trigonometry]], in this sense used to describe his observation of objects around himself and the angles found between surfaces of these objects. Cyclops has repeatedly demonstrated the ability to cause his optic blasts to ricochet and/or reflect off those objects in a trajectory to his liking. This is commonly called a "banked shot" when applied to this talent. Cyclops has been observed causing beams to reflect from over a dozen surfaces in the course of one blast, and still hit his intended target accurately. It is possible he may possess a sense of superhumanly enhanced spatial awareness that allows him to perform these feats as well. 

Cyclops is an expert pilot of fixed-wing aircraft, a skill he appears to have inherited from his father. It has also been implied that his trigonometric sense improves his abilities in the air.

A master strategist and tactician, Cyclops has spent most of his superhero career as the leader of either the X-Men or X-Factor and has developed exceptional leadership skills. It is notable that regardless of their general attitude towards him, all of the X-Men tend to obey his orders in battle - because they know that he's usually right. Further evidence of this is seen during the ''[[House of M]]'' storyline, where the gathered heroes accept Cyclops as the field leader, again without argument. His talents at leadership are also underscored when [[Emma Frost]] alludes to the fact that [[Charles Xavier]] only made Cyclops a team leader as an anchor for which Scott could gain some sort of stability in his life. Citing that Scott was not the type of natural leader that others like [[Captain America]] are, and his defeat to a non-powered Storm for leadership of the [[X-Men]], Emma does affirm that Cyclops has proven to be an excellent leader. During his twelve years raising Cable in the distant future, Cyclops and Phoenix, under the aliases of Slym and Redd Dayspring, helped organize a resistance to Apocalypse's rule, with Cyclops/Slym becoming one of the leaders of the Clan Rebellion.

Cyclops also has extensive training in martial arts and unarmed combat, holding black belts in [[judo]] and [[aikido]]. His level of skill is sufficient to defeat six normal men with his eyes closed, and he has in the past held his own against even [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]].

===Feats and Accomplishments===
While rarely displayed, Cyclops' versatility in the use of his abilities is quite astounding.  Below is a list of impressive feats accomplished by Cyclops (with issue numbers for verification).
*''[[Age of Apocalypse]] [[Weapon X]]'' #1: It is revealed that Wolverine has lost his right hand from Cyclops' optic blast. While this took place in an alternate timeline, it shows that Cyclops is potentially powerful enough to destroy one of the most indestructable objects in the Marvel Universe: [[Adamantium]] (Note this happened at a joint though, where the bones could be merely held together by ligament and muscle)
*''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #93: Cyclops battles [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], and [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] himself remarks that only his speed saved him from being hit by Cyclops.  This alone demonstrates an impressive combination of quick reflexes and incredible accuracy.
*''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #124: While trapped in Murderworld (controlled by the villain [[Arcade (comics)|Arcade]]), Cyclops saves [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] by clearing out a room of attacking robots with just one blast that reflects from enemy to enemy, eventually destroying a total of eight attackers.
*''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #144: While playing [[Eight Ball|pool]], he uses one pinpoint optic blast to strike the cue ball, sinking every ball on the table.
*''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #152: He deflects his blast off three surfaces to hit [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]], and pushes him towards the waiting [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]].  This shows an impressive level of intelligence (given Shaw's power to absorb kinetic energy), to adapt his strategy accordingly.
*''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #170: While trying to explain his mutancy to [[Madelyne Pryor]], he flips a coin, and blasts the center out of it, leaving the outer edge intact.
*''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #175: When the X-Men are hypnotized into thinking Cyclops is the [[Dark Phoenix]], they try to hunt him down. After defeating [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] and [[Storm (comics)|Storm]] in quick succession, he flees to the [[Danger Room]]. Inside, he creates a [[jungle]] environment in which to hide from his fellow [[X-Men]]. They attempt to hunt him down, but he outwits them, defeating [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], [[Storm (comics)|Storm]] and [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], all the while suffering from broken [[ribs]].
*''[[X-Men vol. 2|X-Men]]'' (vol. 2) #112: While infiltrating [[Genosha]] with [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], he fires a blast, deflecting it around two corners to take out two waiting enemies.  Wolverine later remarked that it was the first time he'd ever seen Cyclops 'showing off'. In the same comic, while battling [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], he fires past Magneto (who he had just blasted through a wall), hitting Magneto's fallen helmet, which rebounds and strikes Magneto in the head. In the same comic yet again, he and Wolverine come up against a force of armed guards. Cyclops uses several small blasts to disable the weapon of each one of his enemies before they even fire a shot. Lastly, although it isn't shown on panel, Wolverine recounts a memory in which Cyclops opened a car door-lock using only his blasts.
*''[[New X-Men]]'' #137: During the 'Riot at Xavier's' storyline, he is one of the [[X-Men]] who faces off against [[Quentin Quire|Quentin Quire's]] Omega Gang. When [[Redneck (comics)|Redneck]] challenges him, he fires one blast accurate enough to break Redneck's nose without causing any other damage. During the ensuing fight, he fires (while doing a [[cartwheel (gymnastics)|cartwheel]]) a second blast that breaks [[Radian (comics)|Radian's]] leg.
*Two examples of the extent of his power were displayed in issues of ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' and ''[[Astonishing X-Men]]''. In ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #336, while battling the evil being known as [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]], Cyclops took off his visor, releasing a huge blast that blew a hole in Onslaught's armor. Then, in ''[[Astonishing X-Men]]'' #8, while the [[Xavier Institute]] was being attacked by a damaged [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]], Cyclops again removed his visor, unleashing a blast that blasted the Sentinel back across the lawn, and completely leveled a large part of the forest in front of him.
*In ''[[Civil War: X-Men]]'' #4, while trying to blast through a reinforced door, Cyclops powers up Bishop, and Iron Man measures the power at nearly two gigawatts. Two gigawatts is the equivalent to the output of a large nuclear reactor.
*In ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' Annual #3, Cyclops channeled [[Storm (comics)|Storm ]]'s lightning and unleashed a white optic blast.
*In ''[[X-Factor]]''#50, while Jean acts as the vessel to the souls of all the people gathered, Cyclops acted as the lens to channel that power and release an optic blast that decimated a ''[[Celestials]]'' 's arm.
*In the ''[[Phoenix: Endsong]]'' storyline, the [[Phoenix Force]] uses Cyclops' optic blasts to regain its lost strength and power after being split into pieces. Beast commented that Cyclops seems to be releasing an unlimited amount of energy that is feeding the Phoenix force's unlimited hunger. 
*In [[X-Factor]] #68, in the battle against [[En Sabah Nur| Apocalypse]], Cyclops released an optic blast that reflected on multiple surfaces to destroy the plugs that was powering Apocalypse and then finally defeated Apocalypse himself with a large optic blast.

==Alternate versions==
===Marvel 1602===
In the continuity of the miniseries [[Marvel 1602]], Scott is known as "Scotius Sumerisle." He is the leader of the original five X-Men, who are united under Carlos Javier (Professor X) and are known as "witchbreed" instead of mutants. His powers in Marvel 1602 are identical to his powers in normal Marvel continuity, though he wears a ruby visor instead of a ruby-quartz visor to block his optic blasts. Possessively in love with Jean Grey (who is disguised as a man under the name "John Grey"), he becomes jealous of her friendship with Werner (Angel).

===Age of Apocalypse===
In this storyline, Scott is a villain who fights against the X-Men. Just like in the normal timeline, Scott and his brother Alex were separated from their parents when their plane was attacked by a Shi'ar spaceship. However, in this timeline, both brothers are picked up by Sinister, one of Apocalypse's Four Horsemen, and raised as his foster children. Unbeknownst to them, their father Christopher Summers is eventually found by Sinister and given over to the Beast, also a villain, for medical experimentation.

Both Alpha mutants, and both holding the rank of Prelate, Scott and Alex Summers dominate the new mutant aristocracy in Apocalypse's America. Sinister employs the brothers to operate his breeding pens, act as security, and sometimes perform as special ops unit. Scott's ability to show emotional restraint in battle earns him Sinister's favor over Alex, fuelling a dangerous rivalry between the brothers. This rivalry worsens when the brothers reunite with their real father - Christopher Summers - but are forced to fight him.

Sinister's preference for Scott over Alex also spills over into his genetic experimentation, as with Scott's DNA Sinister plans to create a super-mutant strong enough to oppose Apocalypse. After capturing the X-Man Jean Grey, Sinister believes that he has found Scott's genetic match, and uses their combined DNA to produce a child, Nate Grey.

Despite an initial belief in the doctrine of mutant superiority, Scott has reservations about the ethics surrounding his work, primarily in terms of excess. These concerns grow substantially once he meets and becomes enthralled with Jean Grey, a prisoner and "race traitor". Though Scott plans to release her on his own time, Grey's husband, [[Wolverine (comics)|Weapon X]], breaks in and liberates her himself.  Scott fights back against Weapon X, severing Weapon X's hand but losing an eye in the process.  Jean escapes with Weapon X, who remains an enemy of Scott.

In the meantime, Scott increasingly finds himself questioning the treatment of prisoners, and secretly starts releasing them. This does not go unnoticed by his brother Alex, who still harbors hostility against him. Alex re-captures Jean in order to use her against Scott, successfully exposing his brother as a traitor. Although Jean has no love for either brother, she decides to trust Scott and they attempt to escape together. Along the way the two meet Nate Grey, their genetically engineered son, though they remain oblivious to the truth of their connection to him. Eventually, Alex tracks down Jean and Scott then kills them both. In retribution for Jean's death, Weapon X kills Alex.

Note: In the 2005 AoA one-shot, a video screen in Magneto's office months after the events of ''X-Men: Omega'' shows the status of ten seemingly random mutants. While Jean Grey and Havok are listed as dead, Scott is listed as incarcerated. How this came about was never explained, as Scott played no role in the tenth anniversary special.

===X-Men: Fairy Tales===
Cyclops appears as the main character in the first and third short-story installations of a four-part ''[[X-Men: Fairy Tales]]'' limited series.

*Issue #1
This issue is based around the Japanese fairy tale of [[Momotarō]], only with Cyclops being the boy born out of the peach. He is named Hitome, which roughly means vision in Japanese. However, his optic blasts come from only one eye, and are stopped by the pit of the peach he was born from.

Until he is around the age when he joined the [[X-Men]] in the regular comics, he lives with the old couple who found the large peach, working as a woodcutter, using his blasts to cut down trees instead of an axe.

When an old monk ([[Professor X]]) comes running through the woods, chased by thieves, Hitome comes to his aid. The old monk tells a tale of how he is gathering a group of special people like Hitome in order to rescue the Emperor's daughter ([[Jean Grey]]), from a group of demons ([[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants|The Brotherhood of Mutants]]: [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], [[Scarlet Witch]], [[Quicksilver]], [[Toad (comics)|Toad]]).

Along the way, Hitome and the monk gather a team of comrades, some by Hitome's cunning, others by his offers of friendship.

*Issue #3
This issue's story draws elements from [[Snow White]] and stories involving witches.

Scott is a poor blind tailor who discovers a beautiful red-haired woman (Jean Grey) sleeping in a glass coffin in the woods. He awakens her with a kiss and takes her back to the village. Logan, a local butcher, confronts Scott and warns him that the woman is more than she appears to be, and that she presents a threat now that she's awake.

===Ultimate Cyclops===
[[Image:Ultimate Cyclops.jpg|150px|left|thumb|Ultimate Cyclops.]]
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] continuity, Scott is introduced as the straight-laced field leader of the [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Men]]. His parents died in a plane crash, and he is estranged from his ''older'' brother [[Havok#Ultimate Havok|Alex]], to whom he hasn't spoken since joining the X-Men. Before becoming part of Xavier's dream, Scott dated a young woman named [[Lorna Dane]]. Scott is unable to ask his crush [[Jean Grey]] on a date, and when she dates [[Ultimate Wolverine|Wolverine]], Scott leaves the X-Men and joins Magneto. Magneto considers Scott a potential heir and urges him to pursue a relationship with his daughter. It is later revealed that Cyclops joined the Brotherhood to infiltrate Magneto's group.

When Jean dumps Wolverine and begins a relationship with Cyclops, the two men argue over whom Jean loves and fight. Xavier sends the two on a mission to the [[Savage Land]] to resolve the rivalry. Scott falls into a chasm and catches himself on a ledge. Wolverine catches him, but allows Scott to fall. Cyclops survives, but is severely injured and unable to stand. He survives by eating insects until he is found by a Brotherhood rescue group in search of mutant survivors of a previous Sentinel attack. Upon recovering he leads an attack on Magneto and along with the timely arriving X-Men they defeat Magneto. 

While trying to stop Alex from proceeding to the Triskelion to save Lorna Dane, he is hit with a tire iron. Alex claims Cyclops allowed him to do it, because he wants Lorna saved as much as he does.

==Appearances in other media==
===Television===
*Cyclops's appeared in several episodes of the animated television series [[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]. He appears in the episodes, "The Origin of Iceman", "A Firestar is Born", "The Education of a Superhero" and "The X-Men Adventure". [[George DiCenzo]] provided Cyclops' voice in "The X-Men Adventure" while [[Neil Ross]] provided Cyclops's voice in " A Firestar is Born".

*Cyclops appeared in the ''[[Pryde of the X-Men]]'' animated pilot.  [[Michael Bell]] provided Cyclops' voice.

*In the [[X-Men (TV series)|''X-Men'' animated series]], Cyclops was voiced by Norm Spencer. In this version, Scott was the established team leader and was in a relationship with [[Jean Grey]] from the beginning of the series, acting more or less as his mainstream counterpart would. Throughout the series, Scott also discovered that his father was the space-pirate Corsair. During a battle with the government team known as X-Factor, Scott had to fight his brother Alex, a.k.a. Havok. Neither of the two seemed aware that they were brothers, and their powers seemed to have no effect on each other. When the series ended, Scott and Alex never had the chance to discover they are related.

*In a later animated series, ''[[X-Men Evolution]]'', Cyclops was voiced by [[Kirby Morrow]].  Here, Scott Summers is the X-Men's field leader. In contrast to his mainstream version, this version of Scott is a confident and self-assured leader with a much more extroverted personality; his teammates all look up to him, especially since he was Xavier's original recruit; [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] even appears to have a crush on him. He has a slightly rockier, almost love/hate relationship with [[Jean Grey]] in this version for a time, although they later admitted their feelings after Scott was separated from the X-Men, lacking his glasses, and was discovered by Jean during a battle with Mystique. After graduating from Bayville High, he has become an instructor at Xavier's Institute for Gifted Children and is currently romantically involved with Jean. He also shares a close big-brother/little brother relationship with [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]. In this series, Scott later learned that Alex, his brother, was still alive and they often shared conversation by either telephone or actually meeting up with each other, although Alex declined full-time X-Men membership. The fate of their parents is unclear in this series, though.

===Films===
{{Spoiler}}
[[Image:Copy_of_Copy_of_Copy_of_cyclops1.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[James Marsden]] as Cyclops in [[X-Men: The Last Stand]]]]

*In the [[feature film]] ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'' and its [[sequel]]s ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'' (2003) and ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' (2006), Cyclops is portrayed by [[James Marsden]]. Although an important figure and leader in the films, his role seems to be overshadowed in favor of Wolverine, especially in the sequels.

In the first movie Cyclops is the X-Men leader and a Teacher. He has a long-term relationship with [[Jean Grey]]. He has many arguments with Logan, mostly due to the fact the two men compete for Jean's affections.

In beginning of ''X2'', Jean tells Scott (Cyclops) that she has a bad feeling that she'll die, but Scott said he will not let anything happen to her. Cyclops accompanies Professor X to Magneto (who is locked up in a plastic cell). While waiting for Professor X, Lady Deathstrike and the guards attack Cyclops. Cyclops is captured along with Professor X. After Stryker brainwashes Cyclops, Stryker has him waiting for Jean, ready to ambush her.

Cyclops had very little screentime in ''The Last Stand'' due to Marsden's filming of ''[[Superman Returns]]''{{fact}}. About 30 minutes into the film, he encounters the resurrected Jean Grey who - lacking complete control over the Phoenix - [[Comic book death|apparently kills him]] although his death is not shown on-screen. Logan only finds his glasses, but not his body. {{endspoilers}}

===Video games===
{{wikibooks|Fighting Game Moves/Capcom/Cyclops}}
*Cyclops has also appeared in games such as the ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom series]]''.  Most recently, he has appeared in ''X-Men Mutant Apocalypse'', ''X-Men Mutant Academy'', ''X-Men Mutant Academy 2'' and ''X-Men Next Dimension''.

*He appeared in ''[[X-Men Legends]]'' and its sequel ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]'', where he was a very powerful character. He was voiced by [[Robin Atkin Downes]] in ''X-Men Legends'' and by [[Josh Keaton]] in its sequel.

*Cyclops also has an appearance in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]''. He first appears in a cinematic detailing the failed attempt by the X-Men and [[The Hulk]] to stop [[Dr. Doom]] from conquering Earth. He later appears in Doom's castle, having been corrupted into a evil version of himself that fights the heroes. Bizzarely, he is seen wearing his Astonishing X-Men costume in the cinematic, but his Ultimate costume when he fights the player.
