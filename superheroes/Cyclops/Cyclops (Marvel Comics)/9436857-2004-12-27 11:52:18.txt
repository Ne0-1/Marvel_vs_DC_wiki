'''Cyclops''' (Scott Summers, occasionally nicknamed "Slim") is a  [[comic book]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], and a member of the [[X-Men]]. Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], he first appeared in ''X-Men'' #1 ([[1963]]).

==Powers==

Cyclops is a [[mutant]], possessing the power to project beams of concussive [[force]] from his [[eye]]s. Contrary to common assumption, no heat is involved. Due to an injury suffered in his early years, these beams are always "on", and can only be blocked by either closing his eyes or by a barrier of ruby [[quartz]], which is what his [[sunglasses]] and [[visor]] are made of.  The visor is designed to open the quartz shield to varying widths to allow his optic blasts to fire freely when Cyclops desires it.

He is immune to the effects of his own powers, and those of his brother Alex ([[Havok]]); Alex shares a similar immunity.

==Fictional Biography==

{{spoiler}}

When Scott was a boy growing up in Alaska, his father, [[USAF]] Major Christopher Summers, took the family for a flight in their airplane.  It came under attack by an alien [[Shi'ar]] spaceship.  As the plane went down in flames, Scott's parents fastened him and his younger brother Alex into a parachute and pushed them off the plane, in hopes that they would survive.  Unfortunately, the parachute caught fire, and Scott struck his head upon landing.  This caused brain damage to Scott, which is responsible for his inability to control his optic blasts, as well as prolonged amnesia about his childhood.

Scott spent most of his childhood in an orphanage in [[Nebraska]], and subjected to batteries of tests and experiments by the orphanage's owner, Mr. Milbury (an alias for the geneticist Mister Sinister).  When he was sixteen, he was found by [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]], and became one of his students and the first official X-Man.  He soon graduated to become the team's field leader, a position he would hold several times over the years.

Cyclops had long believed that his parents had died in the plane accident.  In fact, they had been captured and sold into slavery by the Shi'ar.  As a adult member of the X-Men, Cyclops met his father, now known as [[Corsair (comics)|Corsair]], leader of the [[Starjammers]], a group of [[alien]]s opposing what they saw as the tyranny of the [[Shi'ar]] empire.  Several more years passed before the two learned of each other's true identities.

Cyclops had an on-again/off-again relationship with [[Jean Grey|Marvel Girl]] during their time in the X-Men, culminating in her tragic death as she tried to pilot a space shuttle through a solar flare, her rebirth as [[Phoenix (comics)|Phoenix]], and her suicide on the Moon.  Cyclops left the X-Men for a while after this, drifting for several months until reunited with the team against [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. Not long after, Cyclops met [[Madelyne Pryor]], an uncanny double of Marvel Girl, and they married.

However, the original Marvel Girl was not dead; her Phoenix identity turned out to be a cosmic entity who had supplanted her, placing her in a [[coma]] in a healing pod at the bottom of the ocean.  Revived by [[The Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]] and the [[Fantastic Four]], she joined with Cyclops and the other original X-Men as [[X-Factor]]. It was eventually revealed that Pryor was a clone of Marvel Girl, created by the villain Mister Sinister.  Cyclops and Madelyne had a son, Nathan Christopher Summers, who was later sent into a future timeline to become the cyborg called [[Cable (comics)|Cable]].  Eventually, Sinister's plans came crashing down, and Pryor became the villainous Goblyn Queen.  This chain of events led to the death of Pryor and the apparent death of Mister Sinister.

Several years later, Cyclops and Jean Grey married. During their honeymoon, they were brought into the future where they raised Cable for the first 12 years of his life. After their return, she assumed the Phoenix identity. If this is the same cosmic force or just a further manefestation of her powers is unknown.  Sometime afterwards, Cyclops was unwillingly merged with the villain [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]], but Jean and Cable tracked him down and separated them, apparently killing Apocalypse in the process.

As a combination of the latent influences of Apocalypse's mind and Jean's emergent Phoenix persona, Scott and Jean gradually became more distant.  Emma Frost, [[The White Queen]], a former villain who had reformed and joined the X-Men, took advantage of this situation to get close to Scott; the two had an affair and fell in love, to the detriment of all parties.  When Phoenix discovered the affair, she psychically assaulted the Queen; Scott subsequently left the X-Men to mull over what was happening in his life.  As he returned, someone in the guise of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] attacked the X-Men, killing Jean in the process. Due to the actions of the Jean of an alternate future, in an attempt to prevent said future from coming to pass, Cyclops and Emma Frost are currently romantically involved, a fact that several of their teammates are none too happy with. They serve as co-headmasters of the Xavier Institute for Higher Learning.

==Metaphor==

Like many of the X-men, Cyclops serves as a [[metaphor]] for an outcast. The early X-Men paralelled [[DC Comics]]' [[Doom Patrol]] in many ways; Doom Patrol was the story of a group of outsiders, cursed with their powers. In many early issues, Cyclops bemoans his curse of being unable to control his powers, making him an outsider and (he supposes) unnatractive to Marvel Girl. Cyclops later lost this personality trait when X-Men such as [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], who has the physical appearance of a classical demon, and [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], who cannot touch another person without harming them, appeared in the comics.

==Television and film==

In the [[X-Men (movie)|X-Men]] [[film]] and its [[sequel]], Cyclops was portrayed by [[James Marsden]].

In the TV animated series ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'', Cyclops was voiced by [[Kirby Morrow]].
