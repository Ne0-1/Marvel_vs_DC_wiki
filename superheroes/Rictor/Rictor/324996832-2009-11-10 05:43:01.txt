'''Rictor''' ('''Julio Esteban "Ric" Richter''') is a [[fictional]] [[comic book]] [[superhero]], who appears in the [[X-Men]] family of books published by [[Marvel Comics]].  Created by writer [[Louise Simonson]] and artist [[Walter Simonson]], Rictor first appeared in ''X-Factor'' #17 (June 1987).  He currently appears in the monthly series ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' (volume 3), as a member of the detective agency [[X-Factor Investigations]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
As a child, young '''Julio Esteban Richter''' was forced to watch his father, an arms merchant, being killed by the time-tossed [[villain]] known as [[Stryfe]]. Later, Rictor was captured by the anti-mutant organization called the [[Right (comics)|Right]], who connected him to a machine that amplified his already uncontrollable power of earthquake generation to wreak havoc in San Francisco. Rictor was freed by the original [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] team and was accepted by them as a trainee member.<ref>''X-Factor'' #17-18</ref> During the chaos, he was assisted by [[Tabitha Smith|Boom Boom]], who talked him out of a severe emotional crisis. He was recaptured by the Right shortly afterwards, but was again freed by X-Factor.<ref>''X-Factor'' #22-23</ref>

===X-Factor/X-Terminators===
Rictor and his friends spent much time living on the sentient craft named 'Ship'. This was the base for [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] whom he helped a few times.

For a time, Rictor was part of the group known as the [[X-Terminators]]. As a member of the X-Terminators, he contended with [[N'astirh]] and his [[Demons in the Marvel Universe|demons]] during the [[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]] attack.<ref>''X-Terminators'' #1-4; ''New Mutants'' #73</ref> The team folded into the [[New Mutants]] after the events of Inferno.

Rictor developed romantic feelings for [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]] while on the team. Rictor and friends traveled to [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] and battled [[Hela (comics)|Hela]], where he assumed a protective role over her, even helping her pass by [[Garmr|Garm]].<ref>''New Mutants'' #77-80, 83-86</ref> Rictor would later face former X-Factor ally [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]], who had become the latest [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Horseman]] of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] known as Death, as well as [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] battling in the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlock]] tunnels under [[New York]]. Rictor was severely injured by Sabretooth, but was saved by [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] and the other New Mutants.<ref>''New Mutants'' #90-91</ref> Alongside the New Mutants, he assisted Cable in fighting Stryfe and the [[Mutant Liberation Front]].<ref>''New Mutants'' #93-94</ref>

Rictor was later captured alongside [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], Boom Boom, Wolfsbane, and [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Warlock]] by forces of the island nation [[Genosha]]. Only he and Boom Boom escaped unscathed. The combined efforts of the [[X-Men]], X-Factor, and New Mutants led to him being freed and Rictor would be instrumental in toppling the Genoshan government. During the adventure, Rictor shared a heartfelt kiss with Wolfsbane and was later heart-broken when she chose (a bit against her will) to stay behind.<ref>''New Mutants'' #93-94; ''Uncanny X-Men'' #270-272; ''X-Factor'' #60, 62</ref>

After the business in Genosha, Rictor left the New Mutants with the intent to bring Wolfsbane back from Genosha.<ref>''New Mutants'' #98</ref> Rictor was by then convinced that Cable — from whom Stryfe had been cloned — was the man who killed his father, and he agreed to join the Canadian government's [[Weapon P.R.I.M.E.]] team.<ref>''X-Force'' #10</ref> The team's sole purpose was the apprehension of Cable, but thanks to both Cable and the New Mutants now known as [[X-Force]], this was averted.<ref>''X-Force'' #11-13</ref>

===X-Force===
Rictor came to join X-Force, and aided them in saving [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]] from [[Gideon (comics)|Gideon]].<ref>''X-Force'' #15</ref> Rictor and X-Force were then captured by the X-Men and X-Factor who were seeking Cable for an entirely different crime, the attempted murder of [[Professor X]]. This had also been perpetrated by Stryfe. Rictor would meet up with Wolfsbane, again sharing a kiss. This ended badly, with Wolfsbane accidentally biting him. Rictor and the X-Force team were at first held captive in the [[X-Mansion]], before being officially released.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #294-295; ''X-Factor'' #84; ''X-Force'' #16-17; ''X-Men'' Vol. 2 #14</ref> Alongside X-Force, he battled [[War Machine]] aboard [[Ship (comics)|Graymalkin]].<ref>''X-Force'' #21</ref> Alongside X-Force, he rescued the captive X-Force members from Gideon and the [[Externals]].<ref>''X-Force'' #24</ref> The team used the Mansion for a time as their headquarters before leaving.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Rictor would later leave X-Force when his cousin and uncle were shot during an arms deal,{{Issue|date=April 2009}} only to return when his close friend [[Shatterstar]] was undergoing an identity crisis.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Shatterstar decided to accompany Rictor to the Richter home in [[Mexico]] to try and end Rictor's family's arms-dealing business.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Both characters have since appeared separately so one assumes they succeeded.

===X-Corporation===
Rictor would later be one of several mutants (amongst them other former members of X-Force) who joined Professor X's restructured [[X-Corporation]]. X-Corporation's confrontation with [[Huntsman (comics)|Weapon XII]] was a total catastrophe, however, and led to the death of one of their members, [[Darkstar (comics)|Darkstar]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Rictor left X-Corporation either before or after the events of [[House of M]].

===M-Day and X-Factor Investigations===
{{Refimprove|date=July 2009}}
Rictor is one of the mutants to lose his powers on [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]]. He again attempts suicide but is overcome by confusion and doubt. A rogue duplicate of [[Jamie Madrox]] nearly kills him but his life is saved by [[M (comics)|Monet St. Croix]], a former member of [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]]. After some convincing from Monet and a gentle nudge from [[Layla Miller]], he joins [[X-Factor Investigations]] under the employ of Jamie Madrox, the Multiple Man. He also finds [[Siryn]] after she has been attacked and kidnapped and becomes extremely mistrustful of Layla Miller.

When the [[Registration acts (comics)#2006 Superhuman Registration Act|Superhuman Registration Act]] is introduced, Rictor and Monet sign up willingly but side with the rest of X-Factor against the pro-registration heroes.

Rictor visits [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], who takes an interest in Rictor being depowered and discusses the possibility of getting his powers back. When Madrox brings Pietro up, Rictor jokes about having had a sexual relationship with him. Madrox then makes a joking comment about making [[Shatterstar]] jealous, causing Rictor to become flustered.<ref>''X-Factor'' # 14</ref>

Quicksilver later manipulates Rictor, empowering him, in a plan to give other ex-mutants their powers. Unfortunately the process is unstable and several of these ex-mutants explode. Rictor confronts Quicksilver again, ending up with Rictor apparently depowered one more time and the mutagenic [[Terrigen Mist|Terrigen Crystals]] in Quicksilver's body destroyed. Afterwards, Wolfsbane and a distraught Rictor share a sexual encounter, but this new aspect of their relationship is marred by multiple arguments. During that time Rictor had several Terrigen Crystals embedded in his back (the remnants from the exploding crystals from Quicksilver), which helped him to defeat [[Isolationist (comics)|Josef Huber]].<ref name="comicbookresources.com">http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=11738</ref>

===Messiah Complex===
{{Main|X-Men: Messiah Complex}}
Rictor is asked to infiltrate the [[Purifiers]], as he is still depowered. In an effort to gain the trust of the Purifiers, he, as planned with X-Men, saves them from an attack from [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]]. Rictor then informs the X-Men that the Purifiers' base extends beyond New York and all over America. He also catches the [[New X-Men]] sneaking around in the Purifier base and when they are ambushed by the [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]], he helps [[Pixie (X-Men)|Pixie]] to focus while using a teleportation spell.<ref>''X-Men'' #205</ref>

===Divided We Stand===
{{Main|X-Men: Divided We Stand}}
While walking down the street, he sees a prostitute who looks just like Layla. When he tries to follow her thinking she is Layla, he gets into a fight with an ex-mutant with horns in his head. He kicks him in the crotch and eventually gets into a fight with the prostitute's pimps until [[Strong Guy]] steps in.<ref>''X-Factor'' #28</ref> He is later escorted to the hospital where he learns that a lot of fights have been breaking out all over [[District X|Mutant Town]]. He is the last to learn that Rahne has left and ends up captured by [[Arcade (comics)|Arcade]] when he tries to leave X-Factor.<ref>''X-Factor'' #28 & 29</ref> He eventually frees himself and finds that the person who hired Arcade is Taylor, the Purifier who he tricked into letting him into their organization.<ref>''X-Factor'' #30</ref> He later relocates with the rest of X-Factor to Detroit.<ref>''X-Factor'' #33</ref>

===Shatterstar===
A seemingly possessed Shatterstar makes a return in ''X-Factor'' #43, attacking [[Strong Guy]] and Rictor, with his hair cut off and his eyes glowing pink, saying only the name "Cortex".<ref>''X-Factor'' #43 (May 2009)</ref> After a brief fight, Shatterstar is broken out of his trance-like state. Upon recognizing Rictor, the two grab one another and finally share a kiss.<ref>''X-Factor'' #45 (June 2009)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
In his early appearances, Rictor is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] capable of generating and releasing seismic energy and tremendously powerful waves of vibrations in any nearby object, causing objects to shatter or crumble. When used against objects with a larger surface, the effects are much like an earthquake.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Rictor's powers appear to affect organic objects in much the same way as inorganic ones; he is depicted using them to explode a cactus plant in ''X-Force'' #25.  Rictor himself is immune to the harmful effects of the vibrations he creates.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} He has expressed reluctance to use his powers in [[tectonic]]ally unstable areas, for fear that he could not control the effects, as when he visited the fictional island of [[Madripoor]], which is located in the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]], in ''[[New Mutants]]'' #93 (September 1990).

In ''New X-Men'' #128 [[Jean Grey]] also states that Rictor has some kind of telepathic defense against Weapon XII's infestation.

In issue #1 of the 2005 relaunch of ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' #1, he is depicted as suicidal, lamenting the loss of his power after ''[[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]]''. During the series he talks about how he had some sort of empathic connection with the earth itself and misses it.

Rictor's body briefly had Terrigen Crystals embedded in his back, small fragments left over from when Quicksilver's crystals had exploded.<ref name="comicbookresources.com"/> In a confrontation with the [[Isolationist (comics)|Isolationist]], Rictor's was shown to be immune to or resisting the various powers the Isolationist manifested because of these crystals. Physical contact with Rictor reversed the villain's [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]]-like transformation, a direct assault with [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]]-like optic blasts had no effect, and an [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]]-style ice construct melted around Rictor. According to writer Peter David, these crystals have since burnt out.<ref name="comicbookresources.com"/>

==Sexual orientation==
[[Image:Rictorshatterstar.PNG|Rictor and Shatterstar kiss. Art by Marco Santucci.|thumb]]
Rictor’s sexual orientation was originally a matter of contention and debate among fans,{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} being left ambiguous for much of the character’s original history. During that time he dated both [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Rahne Sinclair (Wolfsbane)]]<ref name="ReferenceA">''New Mutants'' {{Issue|date=July 2009}}</ref><ref name="X-Factor v.3 #21">''X-Factor v.3 #21''</ref> and [[Tabitha Smith|Tabitha Smith (Boom Boom)]]<ref name="ReferenceA"/> and developed a close—and somewhat ambiguous—relationship with [[Shatterstar]].<ref>''Cable #22''</ref><ref>''X-Force #56''</ref><ref>''X-Force #59''</ref><ref>''X-Force #60''</ref><ref>''X-Force ’99 Annual''</ref> 

''X-Force'' writer Jeph Loeb hinted that Shatterstar had romantic feelings for Rictor and was planning on making the two a couple, but he left the title before this could happen.<ref>[http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/10/18/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-125/ Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #125]</ref>

In ''X-Factor v.3'', [[Peter David]] continued to develop Rictor's personal relationships. Concerning Rictor's bisexuality Peter David initially expressed the idea that:

{{cquote|[It is] more fun tweaking the fans than actually spelling anything out... I think it's much more interesting to have Rictor's comments be a [[wikt:litmus test|litmus test]] for the agenda of the readers than if you just show him involved in some sort of bisexual relationship.<ref>http://www.livewireworld.com/review/archive/Peter_David_01.htm</ref>}}

As ''X-Factor v.3'' continued Rictor developed a sexual relationship with Rahne,<ref name="X-Factor v.3 #21"/> and later kissed Shatterstar.<ref>''X-Factor v.3 #45''</ref> Shortly after ''X-Factor v.3 #45'', Peter David confirmed Rictor's bisexuality in his blog and expressed his desire to develop the relationship between Rictor and Shatterstar further.<ref>http://www.peterdavid.net/index.php/2009/06/24/stash-wednesday-june-24/comment-page-1/#comments</ref><ref>http://www.peterdavid.net/index.php/2009/06/24/stash-wednesday-june-24/#comments</ref><ref>http://robot6.comicbookresources.com/2009/07/liefeld-cant-wait-to-someday-undo-shatterstar-development/</ref>
