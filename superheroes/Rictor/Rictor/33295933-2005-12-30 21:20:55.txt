'''Rictor''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[comic book]] [[superhero]] published by [[Marvel Comics]] who first appeared in ''X-Factor'' #17.

==Character History==
As a child, young Julio Richter was forced to watch his father, an arms merchant, being killed by the time-tossed [[villain]] known as [[Stryfe]]. Later, Rictor was captured by the the anti-mutant organization called the Right, who connected him to a machine that amplified his already uncontrollable power of earthquake generation to wreak havoc. Rictor was freed by the original X-Factor team and was accepted by them as a trainee member.

Soon after, Rictor and most of the other charges of X-Factor joined the [[New Mutants]]. Rictor would later face former X-Factor ally [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]], who had become the latest Horseman of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] known as Death, as well as [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] battling in the [[Morlock]] tunnels under [[New York]]. Rictor was severely injured by Sabretooth, but was saved by [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] and the other New Mutants.

Rictor was later captured and briefly enslaved on the island nation of [[Genosha]], becoming Unit 2347. The combined efforts of the [[X-Men]], X-Factor, and New Mutants led to him being freed, as well as other mutants, and Rictor would be instrumental in toppling the Genoshan government.

After the business in Genosha, Rictor left the New Mutants. Rictor, was by then convinced that Cable - from whom Stryfe had been cloned - was the man who killed his father, and he agreed to join the Canadian government's Weapon P.R.I.M.E. team. The team's sole purpose was the apprehension of Cable, but thanks to both Cable and the New Mutants now known as X-Force, this was averted.

Rictor came to join X-Force, just in time to be captured by the X-Men and X-Factor who were seeking Cable for an entirely different murder, the attempted murder of Professor X, an act that had also been perpetrated by Stryfe. Rictor and the X-Force team were at first held captive in the [[X-Mansion]], before being released, and the team used the Mansion for a time as their Headquarters before leaving.

Rictor would later leave X-Force when his cousin and uncle were shot during an arms deal, only to return when his close friend [[Shatterstar]] was undergoing an identity crisis. Shatterstar decided to accompany Rictor to the Richter home in Mexico to try and end Rictor's family's arms-dealing business. Both characters have since appeared seperately so one assumes they succeeded.

Rictor would later be one of several mutants (amongst them other former members of X-Force) who joined Professor X's restructured [[X-Corporation]]. During the X-Corporation's confrontation with Weapon XII was a total catastrophe however, and led to the death one of their members, Darkstar. Rictor either left X-Corporation before or after the events of [[House of M]].

{{spoiler}}
Now powerless in the wake of House of M, Rictor has been slated to appear in the new [[X-Factor Investigations|X-Factor]] book.

==Powers and Abilities==
Rictor used to be capable of generating termendously powerful waves of vibrations in any object he came into physical contact with, the vibrations starting in his body, and then emanating outwards, mostly through his fingers, causing inorganic objects to shatter or crumble. When used against objects with a larger surface, the effects were much like an earthquake. The extent of Rictor's power was never explored, and he never used it on organic tissue.
