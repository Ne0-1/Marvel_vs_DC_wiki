The '''Possessor''' is a fictional character appearing in publications from [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is one of the [[Elders of the Universe]].  His name comes from his self-given title ''Possessor of the Runestaff,'' a powerful alien artifact.

The Possessor considers the mystic Runestaff the "key" to all knowledge in the universe.  Tharnn acquired the power object by killing its previous possessor, and his first attempt to use it destroyed the inhabitants of the library-planet which he lived on, blinded him, and drove him mad.  The Runestaff was once used by the Vizier of [[Asgard (Marvel Comics)|Asgard]] to save the life of the mortal [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]] by transferring the life force of the goddess [[Sif (Marvel Comics)|Sif]] into her.
