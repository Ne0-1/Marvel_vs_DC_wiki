The '''Possessor''' is a fictional character appearing in publications from [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is one of the [[Elders of the Universe]].  His name comes from his self-given title ''Possessor of the Runestaff,'' a powerful alien artifact.

==Fictional character biography==
Kamo Tharnn, the Possessor, was a librarian, scholar, and seeker of knowledge on the planet Rus, in the Scion system in the Andromeda Galaxy. He considers the mystic Runestaff the "key" to all knowledge in the universe.  Tharnn acquired the power object by killing its previous possessor, and his first attempt to use it destroyed the inhabitants of the library-planet which he lived on, blinded him, and drove him mad.

The Runestaff was once stolen by [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] the goddess [[Sif (Marvel Comics)|Sif]], and used by the Vizier of [[Asgard (Marvel Comics)|Asgard]] to save the life of the dying mortal [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]] by infusing the life force of Sif into her. Sif's life force subsequently overwhelmed Foster's, which entered the pocket dimension accessible through the staff and thereafter the Possessor's own body.<ref>''Thor'' #235</ref> The Possessor later battled Hercules and the [[Champions (comics)|Champions of Los Angeles]]. The Runestaff was used by [[Darkstar (comics)|Darkstar]] to destroy the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]]'s anti-life bomb.<ref>''Champions'' #12-13</ref> The Possessor was later rescued from alien invaders by [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], Sif, and [[Keith Kincaid]], who returned the spirits within the Possessor, including Foster's, to normal existence.<ref>''Thor'' #334-335</ref>

As one of the [[Elders of the Universe]], the Possessor participated in ten other Elders' plot to kill [[Galactus]].<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 3 #4</ref> He attended a meeting of the Elders on [[Ego the Living Planet|Ego]]'s surface.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 3 #7</ref> The Possessor battled Galactus and the [[Silver Surfer]], but was converted to energy and consumed by Galactus.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 3 #9-10</ref> Alongside the [[Astronomer (comics)|Astronomer]] and the [[Trader (comics)|Trader]], he entered a dimension within a black hole. There, they encountered the Silver Surfer, [[Mister Fantastic]], and the [[Invisible Woman]] in search of the [[Infinity Gems]].<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 3 #15</ref> Along with the other Elders devoured by Galactus, the Possessor caused Galactus "cosmic indigestion" from within, and escaped from Galactus. The Possessor took possession of an Infinity Gem, and witnessed a battle between Galactus and the [[In-Betweener]]. He aided the Silver Surfer and [[Nova (Frankie Raye)|Nova]] and the other Elders in helping Galactus defeat the In-Betweener, but fled to escape the wrath of Galactus.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 3 #17-19</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Possessor gains vast superhuman powers through manipulation of comic energy, including superhuman strength, durability, and genius intelligence. The Possessor has the ability to manipulate comic energy for a variety of effects, including the projection of concussive force blasts and increasing his size and mass (and hence physical strength). The Possessor does not age and is virtually immortal. He also has telepathic abilities that enable him to make limited contact with the minds of other Elders, and as he is totally blind he had unrevealed extrasensory perceptions which take the place of his sight.

The Possessor wields the Runestaff (an alien artifact of unknown origin capable of manipulating the life force of living beings.

Due to machinations with the other Elders against Death, the Possessor could not die by any means; whether this still applies is unrevealed.

The Possessor has vast knowledge of virtually any type in the known universe. He once accumulated the largest known store of all knowledge in the universe in his master computer.

==Other characters named Possessor==
The Possessor is not to be confused with the criminal mentalist of the same name who fought [[Daimon Hellstrom]].
