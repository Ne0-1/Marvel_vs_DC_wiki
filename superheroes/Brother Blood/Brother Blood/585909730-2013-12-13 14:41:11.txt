==Fictional character biography==

===First Blood===
The first Brother Blood encountered by the Titans was the eighth to bear the title. Seven hundred years earlier, a priest in the fictional nation of [[Zandia]] named Brother Sebastian killed another priest to gain possession of what he believed to be [[Christ]]'s prayer shawl. The shawl gave him invulnerability and reduced his aging, but the priest he killed cursed him to be slain by his son before his hundredth birthday. Upon doing so, his son became the second Brother Blood. He, in turn was killed by ''his'' son, and this continued for seven centuries.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

The eighth Brother Blood was, seemingly, the first who wished to extend the Church of Blood beyond Zandia. He wanted the Church to be a world power. The Church of Blood began operating in America, and the Titans were called to investigate when an ex-girlfriend of [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] attempted to escape this [[cult]]. Because of the Church of Blood's influence, the Titans found moving against him difficult, especially when public opinion was turned against them by Bethany Snow, a reporter who was a member of the Church.{{Issue|date=January 2010}}

Brother Blood brainwashed [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] and attempted to take control of [[Raven (comics)|Raven's]] power. She defeated him, and his mind was seemingly destroyed.<ref>''Teen Titans'' vol. 2 #31</ref> Brother Blood's wife, [[Mother Mayhem]], later birthed a girl, suggesting the curse was over.{{Issue|date=January 2010}}

===Second Blood===

Some time later, in ''[[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]'' (vol. 3), Brother Blood returned to villainy.<ref>''Outsiders'' (vol. 3) #4 (November 2003)</ref> However, shortly after recreating his cult, he was killed by a young boy, Sebastian, claiming to be the new Brother Blood.<ref>''Outsiders'' (vol. 3) #6 (January 2004)</ref> This version reappeared in ''Teen Titans'' vol. 3.

This teenaged Brother Blood seemingly based all his decisions on advice from Mother Mayhem, but this was actually a female cultist chosen at random and killed if the advice was not what he wanted to hear. He also exhibited [[vampire|vampiric]] abilities. {{Issue|date=January 2010}}

He revealed that the Cult of Blood was based on the worship of [[Trigon (comics)|Trigon the Terrible]]. It was for this reason that the new Bride of Blood was to be [[Raven (comics)|Raven]]. The Titans were able to save Raven, but the Church of Blood continued.{{Issue|date=January 2010}} Brother Blood later appeared in ''Teen Titans'' #30 a member of [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]], where he claimed an undead [[Lilith (DC Comics)|Lilith Clay]] to be his mother.  He also summoned the first [[Hawk and Dove]], [[Phantasm (comics)|Phantasm]], [[Kole]], and [[Aquagirl]] from the dead to be his own [[Teen Titans]].  Brother Blood was stopped by [[Kid Eternity]] and sent to the eighth level of Hell, but not before he summoned the past Brother Bloods, all of which took out their anger and hatred on Sebastian.
In the aftermath of the "Reign In Hell" miniseries, Blood, now an adult, escaped from his incarceration, and was opposed by [[Kid Eternity]]. The fight between the two brought them to [[Titans Tower]], where Blood fought the Titans. After draining [[Kid Devil|Red Devil's]] powers, Blood realised that he had tainted himself with [[Neron]]'s influence, and fled the battle. He was later seen approaching an unknown woman, looking to make her his new Mother.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #67</ref>

Some time later, the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]] were hired to infiltrate one of Blood's cults and rescue a wealthy teenager who had been forced into the group against his will. After the team's cover was blown, they proceeded to kill a number of the church's members and ultimately destroy their compound.<ref>''Secret Six'' (vol. 3) #19</ref>

===The New 52===
The Cult of Blood (once again as Trigon's pawns) makes their post-''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' debut in issue one of the ''[[Phantom Stranger]]'', as a part of the Third Wave of [[The New 52]] titles.<ref>''Phantom Stranger'' #1</ref> Brother Blood himself appears in ''Ravagers''.<ref>''Ravagers'' Vol 1 #3 (September 2012)</ref> Blood kidnaps the team intending to use [[Beast Boy]]'s powers in a ritual to travel in The Red's dimension. However the other members manage to interrupt the ritual as [[Terra (comics)|Terra]] buries him alive.<ref>''Ravagers'' Vol 1 #4 (October 2012)</ref> He survives and returns in ''Animal Man'', where it is revealed his obsession with The Red came from being their first option for champion before Buddy Baker was chosen.<ref>''Animal Man'' Vol 2 #23 (October 2013)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The first Blood is a formidable opponent who is backed by a massive number of fanatical followers. He is an expert manipulator who feeds off of the faith of his members. He ages at a much slower rate than normal humans. Brother Blood is immune to Raven's soul-self due to his shawl's powers. He is also nigh invulnerable and has supernatural physical strength.

The second Blood's powers work similar to those of a vampire: he gains strength from blood, and can take on the abilities of anyone whose blood he has sampled. Like the first Blood, he is backed by a massive number of fanatical followers.

==Other versions==

===Flashpoint===
In the alternate timeline of the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' event, Brother Blood is mentioned by his former student, [[Jason Todd]], that he is a developing drug lord.<ref>''Flashpoint: The World of Flashpoint'' #2 (July 2011)</ref>

===Television===
[[File:BrotherbloodTTanimatedseries.jpg|thumb|185px|right|Brother Blood as he appears in the ''[[Teen Titans (animated series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series.]]
* Brother Blood appears in the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series, voiced by [[John DiMaggio]], as the main antagonist of Season 3. In the show, Brother Blood is the [[charisma]]tic - and [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] - Headmaster of the [[H.I.V.E.]] Academy. His powers are very different from his comic book incarnation, he is a powerful psychic who [[mind control]]s his students to keep them under his thrall. Blood is shown using his psychic powers for a variety of other purposes as well, such as producing deadly force bolts, teleportation, energy shields, telekinesis, or altering perception. He also claims to have a photographic memory. In his first appearance, he displayed the ability to make Cyborg believe he transformed Cyborg's metal hand into flesh, though this only fooled the organic side of his brain; Cyborg's mechanical sensors saw through the trick. In addition, Blood displays formidable fighting skills. Because Cyborg was immune to his mind control, Blood developed something of a rivalry with him, even though he easily defeated Cyborg in most of their fights since he knew all of his weakspots. Brother Blood's first appearance in the episode "Deception" in which a disguised Cyborg is spying on the H.I.V.E. Blood is aware of his true identity and offers to make him human if he serves him. In the end Cyborg shows that he is immune to Blood's mind control because half of his brain is mechanical, and destroys the entire H.I.V.E. Academy thanks to a power upgrade provided by Blood. However, the H.I.V.E had downloaded Cyborg's blueprints when the latter hacked into the H.I.V.E computers, allowing Brother Blood to know Cyborg's weaknesses; in the episode "Wavelength", Brother Blood has utilized Cyborg's sonic cannon schematics to build a massive underwater sonic resonator strong enough to wipe out [[Jump City]] (the Titans' home base in the TV continuity). Although the plot is foiled and Cyborg's blueprints are taken back, Brother Blood later reveals that he possesses a [[photographic memory]], thus, he remembers every detail of the blueprints. Brother Blood's final appearance, except for the two part episode Titans Together in which he appears in the background, is in the two-part episode "[[Titans East]]"; he takes control over the minds of [[Aqualad]], [[Bumblebee (comics)|Bumblebee]], [[Más y Menos]], and [[Roy Harper (comics)|Speedy]] and has them re-build the Titans East tower into his new headquarters. Blood also converts himself into a cyborg to enhance his mental abilities and plans to turn the Titans East into cyborgs as well so he can control them completely. Brother Blood confronts Cyborg in a final fight. Even though Blood smashes both of his arms and legs, he is ultimately defeated by Cyborg when the hero reveals that it is actually his human spirit that enables him to defy Blood's control. He also manages to tap into Blood's mental powers, repairing the damage the villain had inflicted on him in their fight. Producer/writer David Slack stated saying: "In the end, we tried to make him the anti-[[Deathstroke|Slade]]. Where Slade hides in the shadows, Brother Blood loves the spotlight. Slade always has some ulterior motive, Brother Blood will tell you what he's planning right away. So there's some contrast there. We weren't even sure we'd get to use that name. I think what was important that we kept was that he was the leader of a cult. We kept that role and drew inspiration from cult leaders we read about. They are very charming seeming people. From that, we gave him this sort of 'power of temptation' - this ability to control people's perceptions. And the power of persuasion. We didn't get too deep into the character from the comics, because so much of it was so outside of what we'd be able to do. He's definitely one where we've strayed more." <ref>[http://www.titanstower.com/source/animated/charbroblood.html Teen Titans: Characters<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
* [[Kevin Alejandro]] portrays Sebastian Blood in ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' season 2. <ref>http://www.newsarama.com/18439-sdcc-13-marvel-studios-thor-cap-more-live.html</ref> This version of the character is an [[alderman]] from The Glades part of Starling City who blames the Queens for the destruction of east sector of The Glades, mocking Oliver's attempt to stand up for the Glades by reinforcing how the Queens have failed the city. However in "Crucible" it is revealed that he's performing experiments on several men by injecting a serum that caused their eyes to bleed before possibly killing them. He wears a mask to hide his identity from his victims and is referred to by his lackeys as Brother Blood.
