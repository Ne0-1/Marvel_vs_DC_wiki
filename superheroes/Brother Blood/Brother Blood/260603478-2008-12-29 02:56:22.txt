==Fictional character biography==
===First Blood===
The first Brother Blood encountered by the Titans was the eighth to bear the title. Seven hundred years earlier, a [[Zandia]]n priest named Brother Sebastian killed another priest to gain possession of what he believed to be Christ's prayer shawl. The shawl gave him invulnerability and reduced his aging, but the priest he killed cursed him to be slain by his son before his hundredth birthday. Upon doing so, his son became the second Brother Blood. He, in turn was killed by ''his'' son, and this continued for seven centuries.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

The eighth Brother Blood was, seemingly, the first who wished to extend the Church of Blood beyond Zandia. He wanted the Church to be a world power. The Church of Blood began operating in America, and the Titans were called to investigate when an ex-girlfriend of [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] attempted to escape this [[cult]]. Because of the Church of Blood's influence, the Titans found moving against him difficult, especially when public opinion was turned against them by a reporter who was a member of the Church.

Brother Blood brainwashed [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]], and attempted to take control of Raven's power. It was the latter who defeated him, as his mind was seemingly destroyed. His wife, [[Mother Mayhem]], later gave birth to a girl, suggesting the curse was over.
In  the pages of [[Raven(comics]] comic #11(third series)  he wears a mask that looks like the mask of [[Ophiuchus Shaina]].

===Second Blood===

Some time later, in ''[[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]'' (vol 3), Brother Blood returned to villainy. However, shortly after recreating his cult, he was killed by a young boy, Sebastian, claiming to be the new Brother Blood. This version reappeared in ''Teen Titans'' (Vol. 3).

This teenaged Brother Blood seemingly based all his decisions on advice from Mother Mayhem, but this was actually a female cultist chosen at random and killed if the advice was not what he wanted to hear. He also exhibited [[vampire|vampiric]] abilities. 

He revealed that the Cult of Blood was based on the worship of [[Trigon (comics)|Trigon the Terrible]]. It was for this reason that the new Bride of Blood was to be [[Raven (comics)|Raven]]. The Titans were able to save Raven, but the Church of Blood continued. Brother Blood later appeared in ''Teen Titans'' #30, where he claimed an undead [[Lilith (DC Comics)|Lilith Clay]] to be his mother.  He also summoned the first [[Hawk and Dove]], [[Phantasm]], [[Kole]], and [[Aquagirl]] from the dead to be his own [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]].  Brother Blood was stopped by [[Kid Eternity]] and sent to the eighth level of Hell, but not before he summoned the past Brother Bloods, all which took out their anger and hatred on Sebastian.

Solicitations have confirmed that Sebastian will return to fight the Titans, but will be opposed by [[Kid Eternity]].

==Powers and abilities==
The first Blood is a formidable opponent who is backed by a massive number of fanatical followers. He is an expert manipulator who feeds off of the faith of his members. He ages at a much slower rate than normal humans. It should be noted that Brother Blood is immune to Raven's soul-self due to his shawl's powers.

The second Blood's powers work similar to those of a vampire: he gains strength from blood, and can take on the abilities of anyone whose blood he has sampled. Like the first Blood, he is backed by a massive number of fanatical followers.

Brother Blood appears in the ''[[Teen Titans (animated series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series, voiced by [[John DiMaggio]], as the main antagonist of Season 3. In the show, Brother Blood is the [[charisma]]tic - and [[sadistic]] - Headmaster of the [[H.I.V.E.]] Academy. Though he has a few comical moments, he's considerably more fiendish then most of the other villains in the series, barring only [[Deathstroke|Slade]] and [[Trigon]]. His powers are very different from his comic book incarnation, he is a powerful psychic who [[mind control]]s his students to keep them under his thrall. Blood shows using his psychic powers for a variety of other purposes as well, such as producing deadly force bolts or altering perception. In his first appearance, he displayed the ability to make Cyborg believe he transformed metal hand into flesh, though this only fooled his the organic side of his brain, Cyborg's mechanical sensors saw through the trcik. In addition, Blood displays formidable fighting skills. Brother Blood is sometimes considered to be 's temporary replacement for the third season, after the latter's "death" in season two, despite their conflicting personality traits. Because Cyborg was immune to his mind control, Blood developed something a rivalry with them, even though he easily defeated Cyborg in most of their fights since he knew all of his weakspots.

Brother Blood first appearance in the episode "Deception" in which a disguised Cyborg is spying on the H.I.V.E. Blood is aware of his true identity and offers to make him human if he serves him. In the end Cyborg shows that he is immune to Blood's mind control because half of his brain is mechanical, and destroys the entire H.I.V.E. Academy thanks to a power upgrade provided by Blood. However, the H.I.V.E had downloaded Cyborg's blueprints when the latter hacked into the H.I.V.E computers, allowing Brother Blood to know Cyborg's weaknesses; in the episode "Wavelength", Brother Blood has utilized Cyborg's sonic cannon schematics to build a massive underwater sonic resonator strong enough to wipe out Jump City. Although the plot is foiled and Cyborg's blueprints are taken back, Brother Blood later reveals that he possesses a [[photographic memory]], thus, he remembers every detail of the blueprints.

Brother Blood's final appearance is in the two-part episode "[[Titans East]]"; he takes control over the minds of [[Aqualad]], [[Bumblebee (comics)|Bumblebee]], [[Más y Menos]], and [[Roy Harper (comics)|Speedy]] and has them re-build the Titans East tower into his new headquarters. Blood also converts himself into a cyborg to enhance his mental abilities and plans to turn the Titans East into cyborgs as well so he can control them completely. Brother Blood confronts Cyborg in a final fight an even though smashes both of his arms and legs, he is ultimately defeated by Cyborg when the hero reveals that it is actually his human spirit that enables him to defy Blood's control. He also manages to tap into Blood's mental powers, repairing the damage the villain had inflicted on him in their fight.
 
Producer/writer David Slack stated saying: "In the end, we tried to make him the [[anti]]-[[Deathstroke|Slade]]. Where Slade hides in the shadows, Brother Blood loves the spotlight. Slade always has some ulterior motive, Brother Blood will tell you what he's planning right away. So there's some contrast there. [...]We weren't even sure we'd get to use that name. I think what was important that we kept was that he was the leader of a cult. We kept that role and drew inspiration from cult leaders we read about. They are very charming seeming people. From that, we gave him this sort of 'power of temptation' - this ability to control people's perceptions. And the power of persuasion. We didn't get too deep into the character from the comics, because so much of it was so outside of what we'd be able to do. He's definitely one where we've strayed more." <ref>[http://www.titanstower.com/source/animated/charbroblood.html Teen Titans: Characters<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
