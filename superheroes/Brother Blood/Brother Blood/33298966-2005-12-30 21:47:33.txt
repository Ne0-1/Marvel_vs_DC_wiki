'''Brother Blood''' is the name of two fictional comicbook characters in the [[DC Universe]]. As the leader of the Church of Blood, Brother Blood is one of the major enemies of the [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]].

The first Brother Blood encountered by the Titans was the eighth to bear the title. Seven hundred years earlier, a [[Zandia]]n priest named Brother Sebastian killed another priest to gain posession of what he believed to be Christ's prayer shawl. The shawl gave him invunerability and reduced his aging, but he was cursed to be slain by his son before his hundredth birthday. Upon doing so, his son became the second Brother Blood. He, in turn was killed by ''his'' son, and this continued for seven centuries.

The eighth Brother Blood was, seemingly, the first who wished to extend the Church of Blood beyond Zandia. He wanted the Church to be a world power. The Church of Blood began operating in America, and the Titans were called to investigate when an ex-girlfriend of [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] attempted to escape this [[cult]]. Because of the Church of Blood's influence, the Titans found moving against him difficult, especially when public opinion was turned against them by a reporter who was a member of the Church.

Brother Blood also brainwashed Nightwing, and attempted to take control of Raven's power. It was the latter that defeated him, as his mind was seemingly destroyed. His wife, Mother Mayhem, later gave birth to a girl, suggesting the curse was over.

Some time later, in ''[[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]'' (vol 3), Brother Blood returned to villainy. However, shortly after recreating his cult, he was killed by a young boy claiming to be the new Brother Blood. This version reappeared in ''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3).  This teenaged Brother Blood seemingly based all his decisions on advice from Mother Mayhem, but this was actually a female cultist chosen at random and killed if the advice was not what he wanted to hear. He also exhibited [[vampire|vampiric]] abilities. 

He revealed that the Cult of Blood was based on the worship of [[Trigon (comics)|Trigon the Terrible]]. It was for this reason that the new Bride of Blood was to be [[Raven (comics)|Raven]]. The Titans were able to save Raven, but the Church of Blood continues. He has also recently appeared in Teen Titans 30#, where he claimed an undead [[Lilth Clay (DC comics)|Lilith Clay ]] to be his mother.

==In ''Teen Titans'' animated series==

In the [[Teen Titans (animated series)|Teen Titans animated series]], '''Brother Blood''', voiced by [[John DiMaggio]], is a evil mastermind and Headmaster of  the H.I.V.E. Academy, the equivalent of Marvel's [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M]]. His plans are to a large degree reliant on technology stolen from [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]]. He met Cyborg in "Deception" while Cyborg was disguised as Stone. He tried to mind control Cyborg but it didn't work because half of Cyborg's brain was mechanical. Brother Blood almost succeeded in taking over Cyborg when offering him his human form back, but he resisted. This caused endless frustration for Blood and created his vendetta against Cyborg, eventually leading Blood's voluntary sacrifice of his human appearence. In ''Wavelength'' he created an underwater base using Cyborg's blueprints. He used his student Bumblebee to attack Cyborg. But it turned out [[Bumblebee (comics)|Bumblebee]] was also a spy for the heroes. Blood was once again defeated and escaped to the East coast. Bumblebee and [[Aqualad]] followed him and formed the Titans East with [[Speedy (comics)| Speedy]] and [[MÃ¡s y Menos]]. In the season finale Brother Blood infiltrated the Titans East Tower and had [[Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series)#Professor Chang|Professor Chang]] install robotics into his body. He possesed the Titans East but the Titans West came to help and Cyborg defeated Brother Blood against all odds in "Titans East pt. II". Brother Blood was imprisoned and the Titans East made sure that he stayed there. 

He is loosely based on a cult leader by the same name (there have been several, in fact) from the [[Titans (comics)|''Teen Titans'' comics]].
