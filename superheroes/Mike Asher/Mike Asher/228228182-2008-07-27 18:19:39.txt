'''Michael "Mike" Asher''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe. His first appearance was in ''The Brotherhood #1''.

==Fictional character biography==
Mike Asher's day started off fairly normally. An argument with parents, skateboarding to school, an argument with his girlfriend Kary, being pushed around by a bully. Then he met [[Fagin (comics)|Fagin]]. After skipping school and stealing some lunch, they ran into an angry mob attacking a mutant. Luckily for the 3, [[X (Marvel Comics)|Hoffman]] showed up with [[Oswald (comics)|Oswald]], who cleared the scene. 

Upset with his lot in life, Asher cut open his hand punching his computer monitor. A group of goth kids then talked to him and told him their plan to shoot up the school. Asher admitted to them he was a mutant, which scared them so much they ran away. Fagin, watching the goths run away, ran into the bathroom to find Mike, who was trying to commit suicide. Fagin smacked the knife away and told Asher what being a mutant was really all about: power. 

Fagin brought Asher to a nightclub and offered him a joint, which pissed off fellow [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants|Brotherhood]] member [[Marabeth]], who was also there. Asher went to swing at him, but was quickly knocked to the ground, Fagin again saved him and scared off Joey. Fagin warned Asher that the Red Cross trucks scheduled for HIV testing today were actually for testing the students for the X-Gene. As security tried to restrain him to force him to take the test, Asher outed himself as a mutant, then promptly ran from the anti-mutant mob that followed. 

Hoffman and [[Orwell (comics)|Orwell]] showed up at the school and interrupted their conversation. Pulling the fire alarm, he ran to the evil goth kids' hiding spot (The men's room). Asher was stunned to find the evil goths dead, with Fagin and Marabeth standing over their bodies. Asher started to yell at Fagin, but Marabeth told him she did all the killing. Then his dad and Hoffman ran in. Hoffman announced to Asher and Fagin that they would be getting a look at the Brotherhood from the inside, as they were to join the London Cell. 

In [[London]], Asher began questioning the whole point of the Brotherhood to Fagin. Asher took him up on the opportunity... 

In an unnamed military base, Asher was forced to watch the riot in [[Philadelphia]] caused by Hoffman. [[Marshal (comics)|Marshal]] offered him a way out, by helping him take down Hoffman and the Brotherhood. Going to the traitor's house, Asher tried to knock on his door, which didn't sit well with Fagin. After a call to Marshal and some turning on of gas heaters, Asher cut his arm, and left the stunt body in the apartment. Back in Marshal's office, Asher dropped Jane Smythe's hand on his desk. Asher wondered aloud if they should try to alert [[X-Statix| X-Force]], which again pissed off Fagin, but [[Malon Reeves]] pulled them apart. Before passing out, Asher heard Hoffman and Marshal arguing, and noticing a trail of his blood flowing towards them, ignited it.

==Powers and abilities==
When Asher's blood touches the air, he can cause it to explode.
