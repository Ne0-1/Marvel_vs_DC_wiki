===Fictional character biography===
Jacob "Jake" Fury, the brother of [[Nick Fury]], was born in [[New York City]]. As the original Scorpio, he died twice (once via suicide), only to be revived in a succession of [[android]] bodies by the intelligent, extra-dimensional Zodiac Key from which he drew his power. Another man, Jacques LaPoint, became the second Scorpio and led the Zodiac until Jake (in his second android body) killed him. Impersonating LaPoint, Fury led eleven other Zodiac-themed androids to kill and replace the rest of the human Zodiac. Scorpio and the other androids were deactivated when they were transported to the Zodiac Key's dimension of origin during a battle with the [[West Coast Avengers]].  Another Scorpio was the leader of the Zodiac team who fought [[Alpha Flight]] and was later massacred by Malcolm Colcord's [[Weapon X]] team.

==Scorpio (Mikel Fury)==
Nick Fury's illegitimate son Mikel has also used the Scorpio identity. Mikel originally believed himself to be Jake Fury's son, and used a duplicate of the Zodiac Key to battle his father and [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]. When he learned that his mother had lied about his parentage, Mikel switched sides and became affiliated with [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] for several months, following intensive therapy. When he was led to believe that the [[Punisher]] had killed Nick Fury, he pursued the vigilante until persuaded to back down by fellow [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] operatives. He has apparently resigned from SHIELD as a result of that incident. His current disposition in the wake of discovering his biological father is in fact still alive has not yet been decided or depicted by any Marvel title.

==Other media==
Scorpio appears in ''[[The Avengers: United They Stand]]'' as a member of the Zodiac and Taurus' right hand man. He is depicted as an alien with scorpion mandibles on his jaw, a scorpion claw for a right hand, and a scorpion tail on the back of his head. He, like at least Taurus, can take human form, and has used the Jake Fury identity.
