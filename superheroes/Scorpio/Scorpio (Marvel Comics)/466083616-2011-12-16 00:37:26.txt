==Fictional character biography==
===Scorpio (Jake Fury)===
Jacob "Jake" Fury, the brother of [[Nick Fury]], was born in [[New York City]]. As a young man, he came to resent his brother Nick.<ref>''Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos'' #68</ref> As the original Scorpio, he operated as a spy, terrorist, and criminal. Using his secret identity as Scorpio, he first battled Nick Fury at a Las Vegas [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] base.<ref>''Nick Fury, Agent of SHIELD'' Vol. 1 #1</ref> He again battled his brother in Manhattan, then disguised himself as Nick Fury to infiltrate the New York SHIELD base, although his real identity was then discovered by his brother.<ref>''Nick Fury, Agent of SHIELD'' Vol. 1 #5</ref> Nick Fury later went undercover as Scorpio, and took his brother's place in the [[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac]], who battled the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>''Avengers'' #72</ref> Disguised as Jacque LaPoint, he played a minor role in the Zodiac's attempt to kill all Manhattan residents born under the sign of Gemini.<ref>''Avengers'' #120-122</ref> He attempted to kidnap [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Kyle Richmond]], and battled the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].<ref>''Defenders'' #46</ref> Scorpio constructed a set of android Zodiac members to serve him, in his base at Belleville, New Jersey. However, his plan was thwarted by the Defenders, and he committed suicide through self-inflicted gunshot wound in despair.<ref>''Defenders'' #48-50</ref>

In the finale arc of the ''Secret Warriors'' series it was revealed that Jake's death and much of his villainy was all part of a long-game plan of Nick Fury's. Jake was in deep cover, eventually infiltrating the highest rungs of Hydra and helping his brother bring about its destruction.{{issue|date=November 2011}}

===LMD and Jacques LaPoint===
Scorpio was later revived in an [[android (robot)|android]] body by the intelligent, extra-dimensional Zodiac Key from which he drew his power. The real Jacques LaPoint became the second Scorpio and led the Zodiac until Jake (in his second android body) killed him. Impersonating LaPoint, Fury led eleven other Zodiac-themed androids to kill and replace the rest of the human Zodiac members, and took over the organization's criminal operations. Scorpio and the other androids were deactivated when they were transported to the Zodiac Key's dimension of origin during a battle with the [[West Coast Avengers]], and abandoned there.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #26-28</ref>

Another Scorpio was the leader of the Zodiac team who fought [[Alpha Flight]] and was later massacred by Malcolm Colcord's [[Weapon X]] team.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

===Scorpio (Mikel Fury)===
Nick Fury's illegitimate son Mikel has also used the Scorpio identity. Mikel originally believed himself to be Jake Fury's son, and used a duplicate of the Zodiac Key to battle his father and [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]. When he learned that his mother had lied about his parentage, Mikel switched sides and became affiliated with [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] for several months, following intensive therapy.<ref>''Wolverine/Nick Fury'' Graphic Novel</ref> When he was led to believe that the [[Punisher]] had killed Nick Fury, he pursued the vigilante until persuaded to back down by fellow [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] operatives and ousted from the agency.<ref>''Punisher'' Vol. 3 #7</ref> He makes a brief appearance in Secret Warriors, issue 11 as the leader from one of Nick Fury's secret independent teams<ref>''Secret Warriors'' #11</ref> and is later killed in a mission.{{issue|date=July 2011}}

==Powers and abilities==
Jake Fury possessed a genius intellect, as well as an army basic training, with an above average knowledge of hand-to-hand combat and streetfighting techniques. As Scorpio, Jake used the Zodiac Key to increase his physical abilities, and gain superhuman powers such as the ability to transform his body into sentient water for brief periods of time. Scorpio is totally dependent upon the Zodiac Key in order to maintain his superhuman powers. He did not have to be in physical contact with it to wield it. The Zodiac Key is a power object of otherdimensional origin that taps an unidentified extradimensional energy for a variety of effects, including concussive force, electricity, magnetism, teleportation, physical transformation, etc. The Zodiac Key possesses sentience of a sort. After Jake Fury's death, the Zodiac Key employed his Theater of Genetics laboratory to create an android of Jake Fury.

Ecliptic's Zodiac had a barbed tail which was never used in combat. He also wielded a weapon similar to the Zodiac Key which displayed the ability to fire energy blasts and has a Zodiac teleportation device.
