'''Honey Lemon''' ('''Aiko Miyazaki''') is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]], associated with the Japanese team known as [[Big Hero 6 (comics)|Big Hero 6]]. She was created by [[Steven T. Seagle]] and [[Duncan Rouleau]], and first appeared in ''Sunfire & Big Hero 6'' #1 (September 1998).

==Publication history==
Created by [[Steven T. Seagle]] and [[Duncan Rouleau]] in their spare time while working on another project, Honey Lemon was first intended to appear with the rest of [[Big Hero 6 (comics)|Big Hero 6]] in ''[[Alpha Flight]]'' #17 (December 1998). However, the team first appeared in their own self-titled three-issue miniseries by writer [[Scott Lobdell]] and artist Gus Vasquez, which due to scheduling issues, was published before ''Alpha Flight'' #17.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laughingplace.com/w/blogs/fanboy/2014/03/25/movie-week-a-look-ahead-to-big-hero-6/| work= FanBoy's Blog | publisher= LaughingPlace.com |title= MovieWeek: A Look Ahead To Big Hero 6|date=25 March 2014|accessdate=23 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.vancouversun.com/entertainment/movie-guide/Hero+banks+huggable+robot+draw+audiences/10350057/story.html |title= Big Hero 6 banks on a huggable robot to draw in audiences |first= Christopher |last= Palmeri |work= The Vancouver Sun | agency= Bloomberg News| date= 3 November 2014| accessdate= 8 January 2015}}</ref> The character appeared with the team in a subsequent five-issue miniseries which was launched by Marvel Comics in September 2008.

==Fictional character biography==
Aiko Miyazaki was enrolled in the graduate program at the [[Tokyo University of Science]] when she was recruited by Naikaku Jōhō Chōsashitsu ([[Naicho|Naichō]]), Japan's premiere [[intelligence agency]]. Miyazaki's sharp intellect and stunning looks made her a prime candidate for secret agent status, and she was promptly placed on a research and development team consisting of Naichō's top physicists, chemists, and mechanical engineers and put to work creating new technology for the government. Although Miyazaki's team was responsible for several innovations in surveillance technology, by far their most significant invention was a cluster of artificial, miniature wormholes—tiny warps and distortions in the fabric of space-time. At Miyazaki's suggestion, the wormholes were contained within an innocuous woman's purse so they could be applied in the field without attracting undue attention. It was soon discovered that the wormholes, in conjunction with [[Pym Particles]] and cutting-edge [[nanotechnology]], served as ideal storage devices in the field—virtually any object, no matter how large, could be stored in Miyazaki's aptly-named "Power Purse" for later use.<ref name="Big Hero 6 #1">''Big Hero 6'' #1 (2008)</ref>

Soon after, the top-secret consortium of Japanese politicians and business entities known as the Giri began recruiting candidates for [[Big Hero 6 (comics)|Big Hero 6]], which was to become Japan's premiere superhero team. Inspired by the exploits of [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire (Shiro Yoshida)]], Japan's national superhero, Miyazaki persuasively lobbied her superiors in Naichō for a spot on the team. Graduating to full-fledged "secret agent" status, Miyazaki adopted the code-name "Honey Lemon" (inspired by her favorite television program of the same name). As the most caring and compassionate member of the team, Honey Lemon quickly found herself at odds with teammate [[GoGo Tomago|Go-Go Tomago (Leiko Tanaka)]], a tough-talking ex-convict who felt that Honey Lemon received special treatment because of her looks and intellect. However, after several heated squabbles, the two eventually learned to appreciate one another and became good friends.<ref name="Big Hero 6 #1" />

She seemingly became attracted to the team's newest potential recruit, [[Hiro Takachiho]], as she kept smiling at him in a flirtatious way. Later, Honey helped overthrow a menace called Everwraith and saved Japan from destruction.{{issue|date=April 2013}}

She was only briefly seen afterwards, helping Sunfire out in [[Canada]].{{issue|date=November 2014}} Sometime later, a mysterious individual used a machine to mind-control the entire team of Big Hero Six and they were sent to Canada once again, where they fought the newest incarnation of [[Alpha Flight]] until [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]] discovered the plot. Honey Lemon was, along with the rest of the team, brought back to normal, and they all returned to Japan to try to discover who mind-controlled them.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #17 (1989)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Honey Lemon's [[Magic satchel|Power Purse]] (also known as the "Nano-Purse") contains a series of miniature, artificial, inter-universe wormholes, granting her limited access to an indeterminate number of worlds and dimensions. The unstable, fluctuating nature of the wormholes makes accurate long-term mapping of them difficult. Before deploying in the field, Honey Lemon typically gathers a large arsenal of supplies, shrinks them to microscopic size using a combination of Pym Particles and cutting-edge nanotechnology, and stores them in miniature pocket universes only accessible via the Power Purse's wormholes. As such, she is able to instantaneously retrieve these items from the Power Purse and restore them to their original size while in the field.<ref name="Big Hero 6 #1" />

The Power Purse's wormholes also grant access to a number of full-sized, inhabited dimensions. For instance, the Microverse planet of Coronar (home world of former Big Hero 6 member [[Sunpyre]]) is accessible through the Power Purse. The total number of dimensions accessible via the Power Purse has yet to be determined. Although Honey Lemon can use the Power Purse's wormholes as a method of personal transportation, she only does so in rare instances when her life is in danger, as a trip through the Power Purse is often a very unpleasant experience for carbon-based lifeforms.<ref name="Big Hero 6 #1" />

Honey Lemon is a brilliant scientist who often keeps her opponents off-guard by feigning ignorance. As a secret agent of the Naichō intelligence agency, she is extensively trained in various martial arts, including aikido, judo, jujutsu, karate, Shaolin kung fu and tae kwon do.<ref name="Big Hero 6 #1" />
