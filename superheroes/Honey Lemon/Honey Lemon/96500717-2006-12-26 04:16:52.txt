'''Honey Lemon''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]], associated with the Japanese team known as [[Big Hero Six]]. Her name may be derived from the famous [[superhero]]-like [[magical girl]] [[Cutey Honey]].

==Fictional character history==
Little is known of '''Honey Lemon''''s past, or how she obtained the purse that gives her "super-powers". At one point in her life, Honey got approached by the Japanese organization that created the country's first super-hero team known as Big Hero Six. She was offered to join the team and accepted.

She became seemingly attracted to the team's newest potential recruit, [[Hiro Takachiho]], as she kept smiling at him in a flirting way. Later, Honey helped overthrow a menace called Everwraith and saved Japan from destruction. 

She was only briefly seen afterward, helping [[Sunfire]] out in Canada. Sometime later, a mysterious individual used a machine to mindcontrol the entire team of Big Hero Six and Honey was no exception. They were send to Canada once again, where they fought the newest incarnation of [[Alpha Flight]] until [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]] discovered the plot. Honey Lemon was, alongside of the rest of the team, brought back to normal and they all returned to Japan to discover who mindcontrolled them. Who that person was, has until today never been revealed inside a comic.
