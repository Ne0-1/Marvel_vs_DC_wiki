'''Anarky''' ('''Lonnie Machin''') is a comic book character published by [[DC Comics]]. Co-created by [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]] and [[Norm Breyfogle]], he first appeared in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #608 ([[November 1989]]) as an adversary of [[Batman]].

He is named for his belief in [[anarchism]], and was partially inspired by [[Alan Moore]]'s character "[[V (comics)|V]]" from ''[[V for Vendetta]]''.<ref name="Alan Grant & Norm Breyfogle">{{cite web |url = http://www.adelaidecomicsandbooks.com/granbrey.htm |title = Alan Grant & Norm Breyfogle |accessdate = 2007-05-18 |last = Best |first = Daniel |date= 2007-01-06 |format = html |work = Adelaide Comics and Books| publisher =ACAB Publishing}}</ref>  Stories revolving around Anarky often focus on political and philosophical themes.

The character experienced a brief surge in media exposure during the late '90s.  This culminated in ''[[Anarky (comic book)|Anarky]]'', a short lived [[spin-off]] series, which was financially and critically unsuccessful.  Anarky was primarily featured in stories written by Grant until the writer's departure from DC Comics, and has since been largely absent from DC publications.

==Publication history==
===Creation===
Originally inspired by [[Alan Moore|Alan Moore's]] ''[[V for Vendetta]]'', and early incarnations of [[Chopper (Judge Dredd character)|Chopper]], from [[Judge Dredd]], [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]] imagined the character as a twelve-year-old [[anarchism|anarchist]] vigilante.   His only instructions to his partner, illustrator [[Norm Breyfogle]], were that Anarky be designed as a cross between [[V (comics)|V]] and the black spy from ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine's ''[[Spy vs. Spy]]''.<ref name="2000AD Review">{{cite web |url=http://www.2000adreview.co.uk/features/interviews/2005/grant/grant1.shtml |title=Alan Grant |accessdate=2007-01-26 |last=Berridge |first=Edward |authorlink=Edward Berridge |date= 2005-01-12 |format=html |work=2000 AD Review}}</ref>  In response to deadline pressures, and not recognizing the character's potential, Breyfogle "made no preliminary sketches, simply draping him in long red sheets."  He was also intended to wear a costume that disguised his youth, and so was fitted with a crude "head extender" that elongated his neck, creating a jarring appearance.  While both of these design elements have since been dropped, more enduring aspects of the character have been his golden face mask, "priestly" hat, and his golden [[Staff (stick)|staff]].<ref name="Anarky Trade Paperback Intro">{{cite web |url=http://www.normbreyfogle.com/media/articles.asp?page=anktpb |title=Anarky Trade Paperback Intro |accessdate=2007-02-11 |last=Breyfogle |first=Norm |authorlink=Norm Breyfogle |format=html |work=Normbreyfogle.com}}</ref>
[[Image:Detective Comics -608 (November 1989).jpg|thumb|right|Anarky's debut, in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #608.  Art by [[Norm Breyfogle]].]]
The first Anarky story, "''Anarky in Gotham City, Part 1: Letters to the Editor''," appeared in ''Detective Comics #608'', in November 1989.  In Grant's earliest script for the character, Anarky was designed to be far more vicious, and to have killed his first victim.  However, [[Dennis O'Neil]], then editor of Detective Comics, requested that Grant "tone down" the script, as he felt Anarky becoming a murderer at such a young age was morally reprehensible.  Grant consented to the request and the script was rewritten.<ref name="Alan Grant & Norm Breyfogle">{{cite web |url = http://www.adelaidecomicsandbooks.com/granbrey.htm |title = Alan Grant & Norm Breyfogle |accessdate = 2007-05-18 |last = Best |first = Daniel |date= 2007-01-06 |format = html |work = Adelaide Comics and Books| publisher =ACAB Publishing}}</ref>   In a 2004 interview, Grant explained the motivation behind this early decision:

{{quotation|I wanted to play it that way because it created incredible tension in Anarky himself. Other heroes might kill--Batman used to, in the early days--but for a teenager to rationally decide to take lives...well, it hadn't been handled in comics before.  But Denny was boss, and I respected his opinion and toned things down.|Alan Grant|Getting the 411: Alan Grant, 2004<ref name="fouroneone">{{cite web |url=http://www.411mania.com/comics/columns/article.php?columns_id=2769 |title=Getting The 411: Alan Grant |accessdate= 2004-08-14 |author= |last=Cooling |first=William |date=07-04-21 |format=html |work=411Mania.com |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051113004943/http://www.411mania.com/comics/columns/article.php?columns_id=2769 |archivedate=2005-11-13}}</ref>}}
Although Grant had not created the character to be used beyond the two-part debut story, reader reaction and encouragement from his editor caused him to change his mind. He then decided to make Lonnie Machin the third [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], following [[Jason Todd]], desiring a new [[sidekick]] who would act as a [[Foil (literature)|foil]] to Batman, and not have the same motivations for vengeance.  However, this was abandoned when he learned that [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Tim Drake]] had already been created to fill the role by [[Marv Wolfman]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.2000adreview.co.uk/features/interviews/2005/grant/grant1.shtml |title=Alan Grant |accessdate=2007-01-26 |last=Berridge |first=Edward |authorlink=Edward Berridge |format=html |work=2000 AD Review}}  The idea of Anarky-as-Robin was briefly raised at the end of the original two-parter in which he was introduced. When Batman briefs [[Commissioner Gordon]] over Anarky's capture he admits to admiring his ingenuity and desire to change the world for the better. Gordon expresses concern that Batman may be thinking of having him as a new Robin, but Batman denies this. {{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Steve Mitchell | Story = Anarky in Gotham City, Part 2: Facts About Bats | Title = '''Detective Comics''' | Volume = | Issue = 609 | Date = '''[[December 1]], [[1989]]''' | Publisher = '''DC Comics''' | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>

===''Anarky'' series===
{{main|Anarky (comic book)}}
In May of 1997, a four-issue Anarky mini-series, ''[[Anarky (comic book)|Anarky]]'', was produced.  The story, entitled "''Metamorphosis''," maintained the character's anti-authoritarian sentiments, but was instead based on the philosophy of [[Frank R. Wallace|Neo-Tech]], an offshoot of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]].<ref name="zon-power-comic-book">{{cite web |url=http://gocomics.com/alangrant.htm |title=Holy Penis Collapsor Batman!

With the continuing success of the character, Darren Vincenzo, then an editorial assistant, suggested continuing the book as an ongoing series to Norm Breyfogle, provided Alan Grant would continue as the writer.  Although Grant was concerned that such a series would not be viable, he agreed to write the series at Breyfogle's insistence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=8581 |title= Catching Up With Norm Breyfogle and Chuck Satterlee |accessdate= 2007-01-24 |last=Carey |first=Edward |date=2006-10-10 |format=html |work=Comicbookresources.com}}</ref>

{{quotation|Anarky, not having any super powers, doesn’t have what it takes to bring the fans in month after month. He’s the sort of character you can get away with using in an annual once a year plus his own mini-series once a year and maybe as a guest star every couple of years, but he’s not capable, he’s not strong enough to hold his own monthly title. Very few characters are when it comes down to it.|Alan Grant|Alan Grant & Norm Breyfogle, 2006<ref name="Alan Grant & Norm Breyfogle">{{cite web |url = http://www.adelaidecomicsandbooks.com/granbrey.htm |title = Alan Grant & Norm Breyfogle |accessdate = 2007-05-18 |last = Best |first = Daniel |date= 2007-01-06 |format = html |work = Adelaide Comics and Books| publisher =ACAB Publishing}}</ref> }} 

Grant's doubts eventually proved true.  The series was panned by critics, failed to catch on among readers, and was canceled after eight issues.  However, Grant has noted in an interview that it was popular in [[South America]], perhaps owing to a history of political repression in the region.<ref name="2000AD Review">{{cite web |url=http://www.2000adreview.co.uk/features/interviews/2005/grant/grant1.shtml |title=Alan Grant |accessdate=2007-01-26 |last=Berridge |first=Edward |authorlink=Edward Berridge |format=html |work=2000 AD Review}}</ref>

In the last issue of the ''Anarky'' series, the possibility was left open that [[Joker (comics)|The Joker]] might be Anarky's actual father. As the series is now canceled, it may be some time before this theory is addressed. However, Alan Grant has said that a senior [[DC Comics]] official told him, "'Anarky will never be the Joker's son. You can write the story, but someone else will write the sequel showing it just can't be.'"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/panel/108672670397105.htm |title=The Panel: Do Fans REALLY Want Change? |accessdate=2007-01-24 |coauthors= Craig & Lucie |date=-06-08 |format=html |work=Silverbulletcomics.com}}</ref>

Later, in a dual interview with Breyfogle, the situation behind the decision was explained in greater detail, that it was originally Breyfogle's idea to make Anarky the son of The Joker, and that it was [[Dennis O'Neil]] who protested against it.

{{quotation|Denny only let me write that story under protest, he was totally opposed to Joker being Anarky’s father and said under no circumstances would DC allow that... I talked him into letting me write the script anyway by saying the story would create a lot of interest and then maybe in six months time I would write the rebuttal, which proves that Anarky wasn’t the Joker’s son... and Denny said OK but of course the monthly title got cancelled long before that point.|Alan Grant|Alan Grant & Norm Breyfogle, 2006<ref name="Alan Grant & Norm Breyfogle">{{cite web |url = http://www.adelaidecomicsandbooks.com/granbrey.htm |title = Alan Grant & Norm Breyfogle |accessdate = 2007-05-18 |last = Best |first = Daniel |date= 2007-01-06 |format = html |work = Adelaide Comics and Books| publisher =ACAB Publishing}}</ref> }} 

Further, Grant and Breyfogle speculate that as Dennis O'Neil is no longer in charge of such decisions at DC Comics, with the final editorial decision now belonging to [[Dan DiDio]], it is no longer possible to be sure whether a rebuttal will ever be published.<ref name="Alan Grant & Norm Breyfogle">{{cite web |url = http://www.adelaidecomicsandbooks.com/granbrey.htm |title = Alan Grant & Norm Breyfogle |accessdate = 2007-05-18 |last = Best |first = Daniel |date= 2007-01-06 |format = html |work = Adelaide Comics and Books| publisher =ACAB Publishing}}</ref>   There is, as yet, no record of Didio ever commenting on the subject.  However, it is worth noting that the [[Timeline of the DC Universe|DC Universe timeline]] chronologically prevents the Joker from being Anarky's biological father, as the character is (currently) approximately sixteen years old, while both Batman and the Joker have only existed for approximately thirteen years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dcuguide.com/Anarky/Anarky2_008.php |title=ANARKY Vol. 2 #8 |accessdate=2007-01-24 |format=html |work=The Unofficial Guide to the DC Universe |quote= Greta claims that the Joker is Lonnie's father and recollects when she met him. However, as it is not 16 years since the Joker debuted in the DC Universe Lonnie's age suggests that even if the Joker is his real father the circumstances surrounding his birth had to be different from what Greta tells him.}}</ref>

As Anarky was created while Grant and Breyfogle were operating under "work-for-hire" rules, [[DC Comics]] owns all rights to the Anarky character.  Following the cancellation of the series, both men attempted to buy the rights to Anarky from the company, but their offer was declined.<ref name="2000AD Review">{{cite web |url=http://www.2000adreview.co.uk/features/interviews/2005/grant/grant1.shtml |title=Alan Grant |accessdate=2007-01-26 |last=Berridge |first=Edward |authorlink=Edward Berridge |format=html |work=2000 AD Review}}</ref>

===Political and philosophical themes===
[[Image:Clip - Detective Comics -620 (August 1990).jpg|thumb|left|Lonni Machin defends his actions in ''[[Detective Comics|Detective Comics #620]]''.  Political elements include the [[Anarchist symbolism #Circle-A|circle-A]] painted in the background, and [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Tim Drake]] shown picking up an issue of [[Black Flag (newspaper)|Black Flag]] in the foreground.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Steve Mitchell | Story = Rite of Passage Part 3: Make Me a Hero | Title = '''Detective Comics''' | Volume = 1 | Issue = 620 | Date = '''[[August 1]], [[1990]]''' | Publisher = '''DC Comics''' | Page = 19 | Panel = 3 | ID = }}</ref>]]
Originally, Alan Grant created Anarky as an [[anarchism|anarchist]] with [[socialist]] and [[populist]] leanings.  In this early incarnation, Anarky was designed as an avatar for Grant's personal meditations on political philosophy, and specifically for his burgeoning sympathy for anarchism.  However, according to Grant, anarchists with whom he associated were hostile to his creation of the character, seeing it as an act of [[co-optation|cooptation]] for commercial gain.<ref name="Alan Grant & Norm Breyfogle">{{cite web |url = http://www.adelaidecomicsandbooks.com/granbrey.htm |title = Alan Grant & Norm Breyfogle |accessdate = 2007-05-18 |last = Best |first = Daniel |date= 2007-01-06 |format = html |work = Adelaide Comics and Books| publisher =ACAB Publishing}}</ref> </blockquote> 

Within the books, the nature of the character's political opinions were often expressed through the character's rhetoric, and by heavy use of the [[Anarchist symbolism#Circle-A|circle-A]] as a character gimmick.  Other themes often used whenever Anarky was a featured character in a comic were politically charged graffiti along city streets,<ref name="DC #six zero eight">{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Steve Mitchell | Story = Anarky in Gotham City, Part 1: Letters to the Editor | Title = '''Detective Comics''' | Volume = | Issue = 608 | Date = '''[[November 1]], [[1989]]''' | Publisher = '''DC Comics''' | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref> and fluttering newspapers bearing headlines which alluded to social problems, such as white collar crime, or rising poverty rates.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Josef Rubinstein | Story = Metamorphosis Part 3: The Economics of The Madhouse | Title = '''Anarky''' | Volume = 1 | Issue = 3 | Date = '''[[July 1]], [[1997]]''' | Publisher = '''DC Comics''' | Page = 1,12,13 | Panel =  | ID = }}
</ref>  Occasionally, the titles of political books found in Anarky's room would express the character's political agenda.   In ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #620, a copy of ''[[V for Vendetta (comic)|V For Vendetta]]'' can be seen on Lonnie Machin's bookshelf, as homage.  Other books in his room include ''Apostles of Revolution'' by Max Nomad, ''[[The Anarchists]]'' by James Joll, books labeled "''[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]]''" and "''[[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]]''," and an issue of ''[[Black Flag (newspaper)|Black Flag]]''.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Steve Mitchell | Story = Rite of Passage Part 3: Make Me a Hero | Title = '''Detective Comics''' | Volume = 1 | Issue = 620 | Date = '''[[August 1]], [[1990]]''' | Publisher = '''DC Comics''' | Page = 19 | Panel = 1, 3, 4 | ID = }}</ref>

To increase the characterization of Anarky as highly intelligent, the character's narration occasionally made references to extremely esoteric books, such as ''Universe'' by [[Scudder Klyce]].<ref name="DC #six zero nine">{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Steve Mitchell | Story = Anarky in Gotham City, Part 2: Facts About Bats | Title = '''Detective Comics''' | Volume = | Issue = 609 | Date = '''[[December 1]], [[1989]]''' | Publisher = '''DC Comics''' | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>  When asked if he was concerned readers would be unable to follow such obscure literary references, Grant responded that he didn't expect many to do so, but was "pleased" that some had.<ref name="2000AD Review">{{cite web |url=http://www.2000adreview.co.uk/features/interviews/2005/grant/grant1.shtml |title=Alan Grant |accessdate=2007-01-26 |last=Berridge |first=Edward |authorlink=Edward Berridge |format=html |work=2000 AD Review}}</ref>

During the early years of the character's development, virtually no writers other than Alan Grant used Anarky in DC publications.  In a rare portrayal by an author other than Grant, writer [[Kevin Dooly]] used Anarky in an issue of ''[[Green Arrow]]'', producing an explicitly [[Gun politics|anti-firearm]] themed story.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = Kevin Dooley | Penciller = Michael Netzer | Inker = Rob Leigh | Story = Forgotten Paths | Title = '''Green Arrow''' | Volume = | Issue = 89 | Date = '''[[August 1]], [[1994]]''' | Publisher = '''DC Comics''' | Page = | Panel = | ID = }}</ref>

Over the course of several years, Grant's political opinions changed, and when he was given the opportunity to write an ''Anarky'' mini-series, he decided to redesign the character accordingly.  Alan Grant later explained, "I felt he was the perfect character (to express [[Frank R. Wallace#Neo-Tech philosophy|Neo-Tech philosophy]]) because he's human, he has no special powers, the only power he's got is the power of his own rational consciousness."<ref name="zon-power-comic-book">{{cite web |url=http://gocomics.com/alangrant.htm |title=Holy Penis Collapsor Batman!

Grant has also noted that his shift in philosophies had begun slowly, years earlier, and could be detected within stories including the Anarky character.  In a story that preceded the Anarky series, Anarky's father comments on the political books in the teenager's room, referring to Bakunin, [[Karl Marx|Marx]], and [[Ayn Rand]].<ref>"He's fifteen years old, for pity's sake!  Look at these books--!  He should be sneaking copies of ''Playboy'' around, not Bakunin and Marx and Ayn Rand!"  {{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = John Paul Leon | Inker = Ray McCarthy | Story = Anarky, Part Two: The Anarkist Manifesto | Title = '''Batman: Shadow of the Bat''' | Volume =  | Issue = 41 | Date = '''[[August 1]], [[1995]]''' | Publisher = '''DC Comics''' | Page = 2 | Panel = 2, 3 | ID = }}</ref>  While the ongoing series led the character away from the philosophy he had espoused previously, the theme of the character remained "[[anti-statism]]."  In one issue of the ''[[Anarky (comic book)|Anarky]]'' series, a character asked what the nature of Anarky's politics were.  The response was that Anarky was neither [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]], nor [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]], and that he "transcends the political divide."<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Josef Rubinstein | Story = War and Peace, Part II | Title = '''Anarky''' | Volume = 2 | Issue = 6 | Date = '''[[October 1]], [[1999]]''' | Publisher = '''DC Comics''' | Page = 20 | Panel = 5 | ID = }}</ref>  Within the ''Anarky'' series, the character was also portrayed as an atheist, to coincide with Grant's Neo-Tech philosophy.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Josef Rubinstein | Story = Metamorphosis, Part One: Does a Dog Have a Buddha Nature? | Title = '''Anarky''' | Volume = 1 | Issue = 1 | Date = '''[[May 1]], [[1997]]''' | Publisher = '''DC Comics''' | Page = 20 | Panel = 5 | ID = }}</ref> 

While the evolution of Anarky's philosophy mirrored that of Alan Grant's, the character has since seen little exposure in DC publications (as of 2007,) and it is not currently possible to judge if the character's philosophy has been permanently altered.

[[Image:Clip - The Batman Chronicles -1 (Summer 1995).jpg|thumb|right|Anarky debates politics with a fellow juvenile detainee in ''[[Batman Chronicles|The Batman Chronicles]]'' #1.]] 

Following the publication of an issue of ''[[Green Arrow]]'' in which Anarky guest-stared, writer James Peatty juxtaposed Anarky's radical philosophy with the [[progressivism|liberal progressive]] beliefs of Green Arrow.

{{quotation|Everyone always goes on about what a radical Ollie is and I wanted to show that maybe that isn’t the case … especially as Ollie’s radical credentials are pretty antiquated... Anarky as a character - and as a broader idea - is much more radical than Ollie...|James Peatty|James Peatty Pens Green Arrow, 2005<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicon.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&f=36&t=003866 |title=James Peatty Pens Green Arrow |accessdate=2007-02-10  |last=M.

In a review of the ''[[Anarky (comic book)|Anarky]]'' series, Anarky has been dubbed an "[[anti-villain]]," as opposed to "[[anti-hero]]". This is due to his highly principled philosophy running counter to most villains, but which also logically leads to his willingness to break laws, putting him at odds with mainstream heroes.

{{quotation|In the age of the anti-hero, it only makes sense to have the occasional anti-villain as well. But unlike sociopathic vigilante anti-heroes like the [[Punisher]], an anti-villain like Anarky provides some interesting food for thought. Sure, he breaks the law, but what he really wants is to save the world... and maybe he's ''right''.|Todd VerBeek|Anarky review,1999<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rzero.com/books/Anarky.html |title=Anarky |accessdate=2007-07-24 |last=VerBeek |first=Todd |format=html |work=Beek's Books}}</ref>}}

===Absence from DC publications===
Prior to the ongoing series, Anarky had appeared in a small number of [[Batman]] titles, as well as ''[[Green Arrow]]'', ''[[Who's Who in the DC Universe]]'', ''DCU Heroes - Secret Files and Origins'', and ''[[Robin (comics)|Robin]]''.  Immediately after the end of his ongoing series in 1999, Anarky made three sporadic cameos in ''[[Young Justice]]'', the ''Sins of Youth'' [[fifth-week event]], and ''[[Wonder Woman]]'', followed by a period of absence which lasted several years and threatened to sentence the character to obscurity.  During this period, Norm Breyfogle attempted to continue using the character in other comics, including an issue of [[The Spectre]] he co-wrote with [[J. M. DeMatteis|John Marc DeMatteis]].  When this story was rejected, Breyfogle came to suspect the character's prolonged absence was due in part to censorship.

{{quotation|We don’t have any conclusive evidence, but Alan and I can’t help but feel that Anarky’s philosophy grated on somebody’s nerves; somebody got a look at it and didn’t like it.... So I’ve generally gotten the impression that Anarky was nixed because of its philosophy.  Especially in this age of post [[September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11]], Anarky would be a challenge to established authority.

Since the cancellation of the ''Anarky'' series, Alan Grant has disassociated himself from the direction of the character.  In a 2004 interview, he recalled that he had been asked by James Peatty for a critique of an Anarky/Green Arrow script the latter had written.  Peatty desired to know if his presentation of Anarky had been correct.  Grant declined to read the story, explaining during the interview, "you have to let these things go."  <ref name="fouroneone">{{cite web |url=http://www.411mania.com/comics/columns/article.php?columns_id=2769 |title=Getting The 411: Alan Grant |accessdate= 2004-08-14 |author= |last=Cooling |first=William |date=07-04-21 |format=html |work=411Mania.com |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051113004943/http://www.411mania.com/comics/columns/article.php?columns_id=2769 |archivedate=2005-11-13}}</ref>  

The script was published in 2005, and Anarky made the guest appearance billed as his return to DC continuity, in ''[[Green Arrow]]'' #51, ''Anarky in the USA''.<ref name="Green Arrow 51">{{Cite comic | Writer = James Peaty | Penciller = Eric Battle | Inker = Jack Purcell | Story = Anarky In the USA | Title = '''Green Arrow''' | Volume = 3 | Issue = 51 | Date = '''[[August 1]], [[2005]]''' | Publisher = '''DC Comics''' | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>  Despite this "return," Anarky failed to make any further appearances.

During a panel at ''[[WonderCon]] 2006'', multiple requests were made by the audience for Anarky to appear in DC Comic's limited series, ''[[52 (comic book)|52]]''.  In response, Dan DiDio announced two weeks later, at a DC Comics panel during ''[[New York Comic Con]] 2006'', that the writing team of ''52'' had decided to create a part for the character.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newsarama.com/NYCC/DC/DCU/report.htm |title=NYCC: DCU - Better Than Ever Panel |accessdate=2007-01-25|date= |year= |month= |format= |work=newsarama.com |publisher=Newsarama.com, LLC|quote=Referring to all the requests for Anarky appearing in 52 that were made two weeks ago at WonderCon, Didio said that since that San Francisco show, the writers have come up with a way to include the character in the story.}}</ref>  ''52'' editor, Michael Siglain, later responded to a reader question concerning when Anarky would appear in the series, estimating Anarky would appear "in the late 40s."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=95692 |title= 52 (READER QUESTIONS) ABOUT 52 |accessdate= 2007-05-02 |last=Brady |first=Matt|date=2006-12-28 |format=html |work=Newsarama.com |publisher=Newsarama.com, LLC |quote= '''(Reader question)''' We were told Anarky would be playing a part in 52.

Reader speculation centered on the prospect of Anarky appearing in issue #48 of the series, as the solicited cover illustration was released to the public several weeks before the issues' publication.  On the cover, the [[Anarchist symbolism #Circle-A|circle-A]] could be seen as a minor element in the background.</ref>  However, ''52'' concluded without Anarky ever making an appearance, and with no explanation given by anyone involved in the production of the series.

As of 2007, Anarky has yet to appear in another DC publication.

Lonnie Machin is introduced as Anarky as early as his first appearance, withholding his [[origin story]] for a later point.  He is revealed in early appearances to be an uncommonly philosophical, intelligent, but unsociable twelve-year-old.<ref name="DC #six zero eight">{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Steve Mitchell | Story = Anarky in Gotham City, Part 1: Letters to the Editor | Title = '''Detective Comics''' | Volume = | Issue = 608 | Date = '''[[November 1]], [[1989]]''' | Publisher = '''DC Comics''' | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>  The debut story of the character failed to provide a back story to explain his behavior, but a narrative from the Batman character reveals that he is a socially conscious, but arrogant child who believed he "knew all the answers" to solve societies' problems.

He went to lengths to disguise his age and appearance by creating a costume with a false head to increase his height.  This was in fact intended as a ruse on the part of writer Alan Grant to disguise the character's true identity, and to confuse the reader into believing ''Anarky'' to be Lonni Machin's father, Mike Machin.<ref name="DC #six zero nine">{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Steve Mitchell | Story = Anarky in Gotham City, Part 2: Facts About Bats | Title = '''Detective Comics''' | Volume = | Issue = 609 | Date = '''[[December 1]], [[1989]]''' | Publisher = '''DC Comics''' | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>

The character made his debut as ''Anarky'' by responding to complaints in the newspaper and attacking the offending sources, such as the owner of a factory whose byproduct waste is polluting local river water.<ref name="DC #six zero eight">{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Steve Mitchell | Story = Anarky in Gotham City, Part 1: Letters to the Editor | Title = '''Detective Comics''' | Volume = | Issue = 608 | Date = '''[[November 1]], [[1989]]''' | Publisher = '''DC Comics''' | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref> Anarky and Batman ultimately come to blows, and during their brief fight, Batman deduces that Anarky is actually a young child.  During this first confrontation, he is aided by a band of homeless men, including Legs, a homeless cripple who became loyal to him and would assist him in later appearances.  After being caught, Lonnie is locked away in a juvenile detention center.

Anarky's next appearance came in 1990, approximately a few months after his initial appearance, according to the DC Universe sliding timescale. During his detention, he increases his computer skills to the point of becoming an advanced [[Grey hat|"grey hat"]] computer [[hacker]].  He takes on the [[Screen name (computing)|online alias]] "Moneyspider" to steal millions of dollars from western corporations, including [[Wayne Enterprises]], outmaneuvering Batman's own data security in the process. He then uses the money to create bank accounts for poor farmers in third world countries.  He is caught by [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Tim Drake]] in the latter's first solo detective case.<ref name="six twenty">{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Steve Mitchell | Story = Rite of Passage Part 3: Make Me a Hero | Title = '''Detective Comics''' | Volume = 1 | Issue = 620 | Date = '''[[August 1]], [[1990]]''' | Publisher = '''DC Comics''' | Page = | Panel = | ID = }}</ref>

After this setback he frequently escapes from the center and peregrinates around [[Gotham City]].  At this time Anarky was a lesser known, but established antagonist in the Batman franchise.  However, his back story had still yet to be elaborated upon.  Grant provided hints to Anarky's origin in ''The Anarky Ultimatum'', part of ''[[Eclipso: The Darkness Within]]'' crossover event.  Within the story, it is revealed that Lonnie Machin is a highly intelligent child who reads prodigiously at local bookstores, but has few friends.<ref name="robin annual">{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Cowriters = John Wagner | Penciller = Tom Lyle | Inker = Scott Hanna | Story = The Anarky Ultimatum | Title = '''Robin Annual''' | Volume = | Issue = 1 | Date = '''[[1992]]''' | Publisher = '''DC Comics''' | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>  It wouldn't be until 1995 that Grant would finally reveal Lonni Machin's history.

In one of his more notable appearances, during the [[Batman: Knightfall|Knightfall]] saga, he takes on both [[Scarecrow (comics)|Scarecrow]] and [[Azrael (comics)|Batman-Azrael]].  Grant made use of Anarky at this time to advance a theory influenced by [[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]], suggesting that Batman indirectly encourages super-villains to come into existence.<ref name="God of Fear one">{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Bret Blevins | Inker = Mike Manley | Story = The God of Fear, Part One of Three | Title = '''Shadow of The Bat''' | Volume = | Issue = 16 | Date = '''[[September 1]], [[1993]]''' | Publisher = '''DC Comics''' | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>

In 1995, Grant began the slow increase in Anarky's abilities that would culminate in the ''Anarky'' series.  In the storyline, ''Anarky'', Lonnie is released from juvenile detention, and builds a machine that allows him to fuse both hemispheres of his brain, giving him increased intelligence, and what he perceives as [[Enlightenment (concept)|enlightenment]].  Creating an online bookstore, ''Anarco'', to propagate radical literature, he begins to accumulate funds which he donates through another front company, ''The Anarkist Foundation'', to radical organizations, such as [[eco-warrior]]s and gun protesters, or kept for his own projects.  These were, in fact, story devices used by Alan Grant to further improve Anarky's skill set, and increase his intelligence and financial independence so as to become a more credible threat as antagonist in the Batman franchise.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = John Paul Leon | Inker = Ray McCarthy | Story = Anarky, Part One: Prophet of Doom | Title = '''Batman: Shadow of the Bat''' | Volume =  | Issue = 40 | Date = '''[[July 1]], [[1995]]''' | Publisher = '''DC Comics''' | Page = 18 | Panel = 4, 5 | ID = }}</ref>

During the ''Anarky'' storyline, Alan Grant finally revealed Lonni Machin's origins in full, using a farewell letter to his parents to provide exposition into the character's motivations.<ref name="Anarkist manifesto">{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = John Paul Leon | Inker = Ray McCarthy | Story = Anarky, Part Two: The Anarkist Manifesto | Title = '''Batman: Shadow of the Bat''' | Volume =  | Issue = 41 | Date = '''[[August 1]], [[1995]]''' | Publisher = '''DC Comics''' | Page = 2 | Panel = 2, 3 | ID = }}</ref>

Lonnie Machin is an ordinary child who, while abnormally intelligent, is apolitical and socially unaware.  At eleven he gains a foreign pen pal, Xuasus, as part of a school program.  Every month they would write to each other about their lives; Lonnie about how wonderful the United States is; Xuasus about the poverty and political repression that made up his nation.  After a year of contact, Xuasus stops writing, and all of Lonnie's letters are returned as undeliverable.  A year later Lonnie learns of Xuasus' fate.  He writes Lonnie a final letter explaining that his father has been arrested, his mother has taken ill, his sister has died of malnutrition, and at age eleven, he is homeless and fending for himself.  Driven with worry for his friend, Lonnie fervently learns about Xuasus' country, discovering it to be a [[Third World]] [[dictatorship]] at war with [[Marxist]] guerrillas, with arms dealers from [[Western world|The West]] making millions in profits from the conflict. <ref name="Anarkist manifesto">{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = John Paul Leon | Inker = Ray McCarthy | Story = Anarky, Part Two: The Anarkist Manifesto | Title = '''Batman: Shadow of the Bat''' | Volume =  | Issue = 41 | Date = '''[[August 1]], [[1995]]''' | Publisher = '''DC Comics''' | Page = 2 | Panel = 2, 3 | ID = }}</ref>

Further studies into war and political violence leads him to hold radical sympathies.  He come to view all wars as being caused by political elites, with common individuals forced or cajoled into fighting on behalf of the former.  He also began to read more into esoteric studies regarding science and philosophy, laying the groundwork for his advanced intelligence, and leading to his cover as a straight-A student with a normal job as a paper-boy.  Eventually he discovers the extremely rare book, ''Universe'' by [[Scudder Klyce]], which attempted to unify all knowledge.  Within it he finds several passages that convince him of the need to reshape society.  He becomes convinced that if he cannot help Xuasus, he can fight on in his memory and give the oppressed people of [[Gotham City]] hope.<ref name="Anarkist manifesto">{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = John Paul Leon | Inker = Ray McCarthy | Story = Anarky, Part Two: The Anarkist Manifesto | Title = '''Batman: Shadow of the Bat''' | Volume =  | Issue = 41 | Date = '''[[August 1]], [[1995]]''' | Publisher = '''DC Comics''' | Page = 2 | Panel = 2, 3 | ID = }}</ref>

With the success of the ''Anarky'' limited series, an ongoing series was given a green light.  However, Grant notes that the series was dogged by editorial restrictions.  One of the earliest of these was that Grant was "made to" remove Anarky from Gotham City.<ref name="Alan Grant & Norm Breyfogle">{{cite web |url = http://www.adelaidecomicsandbooks.com/granbrey.htm |title = Alan Grant & Norm Breyfogle |accessdate = 2007-05-18 |last = Best |first = Daniel |date= 2007-01-06 |format = html |work = Adelaide Comics and Books| publisher =ACAB Publishing}}</ref>   This was achieved by explaining that following an [[Batman: Cataclysm|earthquake in Gotham]] Lonnie's parents disappear, their house was destroyed, and he is threatened by Batman to leave the city.

Despite numerous editorial impositions, the most controversial plot idea was suggested by Breyfogle to Grant as a means to solidify Anarky's role in the Batman franchise<ref name="Alan Grant & Norm Breyfogle">{{cite web |url = http://www.adelaidecomicsandbooks.com/granbrey.htm |title = Alan Grant & Norm Breyfogle |accessdate = 2007-05-18 |last = Best |first = Daniel |date= 2007-01-06 |format = html |work = Adelaide Comics and Books| publisher =ACAB Publishing}}</ref>   Beginning a search for his missing parents, he comes upon evidence that the Machins are not in fact his biological parents, and attempts to track down his "real" parents.  His leads point to the possibility that his biological father is in fact the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]].  He first meets his supposed biological mother, but finds that she is clinically unstable and unable to answer his questions.  He then breaks into [[Arkham Asylum]] to confront the Joker himself, but is betrayed, as the Joker opportunistically attempts to escape from the Asylum without providing any firm answers.<ref name>{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Josef Rubinstein | Story = The Sins of the Father | Title = '''Anarky''' | Volume = 2 | Issue = 8 | Date = '''[[December 1]], [[1999]]''' | Publisher = '''DC Comics''' | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>

In 2005, James Peaty wrote Anarky's most recent story (as of 2007.)  After a period of obscurity lasting several years, Anarky resurfaces in response to a bombing in [[Star City (comics)|Star City]] that he is framed for.  He teams up with [[Green Arrow]] to hunt down the guilty parties, but remains a wanted felon by authorities.<ref name="Green Arrow 51">{{Cite comic | Writer = James Peaty | Penciller = Eric Battle | Inker = Jack Purcell | Story = Anarky In the USA | Title = '''Green Arrow''' | Volume = 3 | Issue = 51 | Date = '''[[August 1]], [[2005]]''' | Publisher = '''DC Comics''' | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>

==Skills, abilities, and resources==

Since his original debut, Anarky has been described as a [[superhero#Types of superheroes|gadgeteer]].  In early incarnations, he was portrayed as inexperienced, lacking in many skills, surviving only by his ingenuity.  In accordance with this, he would often quote the maxim, "the essence of anarchy is surprise."<ref name="DC #six zero nine">{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Steve Mitchell | Story = Anarky in Gotham City, Part 2: Facts About Bats | Title = '''Detective Comics''' | Volume = | Issue = 609 | Date = '''[[December 1]], [[1989]]''' | Publisher = '''DC Comics''' | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>  Later, during the two ''Anarky'' series, his abilities were increased, and he was described as having enormous talents in both engineering and computer technology, as well as developing skills in martial arts.  This was hinted at in several comics published just before the ''Anarky'' mini-series, and later elaborated upon within the series itself.  According to character dialogue, Anarky's lack of ''[[superhuman|super-powers]]'', and the urgency with which he views his cause, has necessitated that he increase his abilities drastically over the years.<ref name="Anarky vol. one #three">{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Josef Rubinstein | Story = Metamorphosis Part 3: The Economics of The Madhouse | Title = '''Anarky''' | Volume = 1 | Issue = 3 | Date = '''[[July 1]], [[1997]]''' | Publisher = '''DC Comics''' | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>

This steady evolution in Anarky's abilities was later criticized by reviewers, who saw it as having overpowered the character, preventing the suspension of disbelief that was previously possible for a character still described as in his mid-teens.  It was further speculated to be a contributing factor for the failure of the second ''Anarky'' series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fanzing.com/mag/fanzing27/themount.shtml |title=Anarky: Better Dead Than Read! |accessdate=2007-03-10 |last=Morrison |first=Matt |year=2000 |month=07 |format=html |work=Fanzing.com}}</ref>

===Strategy===
Throughout Alan Grant's series of books written for the character, cunning and intelligence were viewed as his primary tools for victory, often using quick thinking, fighting skills, and technology in conjunction with each other in order to defeat tougher opponents.  On one occasion he defeated Batman in combat by confusing the hero with [[Holography|holographic projections]] long enough to attack and subdue him.<ref name="Anarky vol. one #three">{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Josef Rubinstein | Story = Metamorphosis Part 3: The Economics of The Madhouse | Title = '''Anarky''' | Volume = 1 | Issue = 3 | Date = '''[[July 1]], [[1997]]''' | Publisher = '''DC Comics''' | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>  On another occasion he avoided a gang of villains too dangerous to fight, choosing instead to use a flare gun to anonymously signal for Batman to come, and then pitted the two groups against each other.<ref name="God of Fear one">{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Bret Blevins | Inker = Mike Manley | Story = The God of Fear, Part One of Three | Title = '''Shadow of The Bat''' | Volume = | Issue = 16 | Date = '''[[September 1]], [[1993]]''' | Publisher = '''DC Comics''' | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>  When in need of back up for intelligence gathering, or a diversion,  he would call on the help of the homeless community in Gotham, who had supported him since his first appearance, even going so far as to assault Batman to allow Anarky to get away during their first confrontation.<ref name="DC #six zero nine">{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Steve Mitchell | Story = Anarky in Gotham City, Part 2: Facts About Bats | Title = '''Detective Comics''' | Volume = | Issue = 609 | Date = '''[[December 1]], [[1989]]''' | Publisher = '''DC Comics''' | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>

In accordance with the superhero convention of following a recognizable theme, the character's tools often incorporate the [[Anarchist symbolism#Circle-A|circle-A]] into them.  The symbol of anarchy is often drawn on the spherical bombs, his throwing stars take the shape of the circle-A, and the flare guns occasionally leave circle-A smoke trails behind.

===Costume===
Anarky's costume has undergone two phases in design, both of which were created by Norm Breyfogle, in accordance with suggestions by Alan Grant.

The original costume was composed of a large, flowing red robe, over a matching red [[jumpsuit]].  A red, wide brimmed hat baring the circle-a insignia; a golden, metallic face mask; and red hood, completed the outfit.  The folds of the robe concealed various weapons and gadgets.<ref name="DC #six zero eight">{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Steve Mitchell | Story = Anarky in Gotham City, Part 1: Letters to the Editor | Title = '''Detective Comics''' | Volume = | Issue = 608 | Date = '''[[November 1]], [[1989]]''' | Publisher = '''DC Comics''' | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>

This costume was also designed to disguise Anarky's height, and so included a "head extender" under his hood, which elongated his neck.  This was also intended to create a subtle awkwardness which the reader would unknowingly suspect as being fake, until the reveal at the end of Anarky's first appearance.  Despite the revelation of this false head, which would no longer serve its intended purpose at misdirecting the reader, the head extender was included in several return appearances.  Breyfogle finally eliminated this aspect of the character during the 1997 limited series.<ref name="Anarky Trade Paperback Intro">{{cite web |url=http://www.normbreyfogle.com/media/articles.asp?page=anktpb |title=Anarky Trade Paperback Intro |accessdate=2007-02-11 |last=Breyfogle |first=Norm |authorlink=Norm Breyfogle |format=html |work=Normbreyfogle.com}}</ref>

{{quotation|(Anarky's fake head) was unique and provided a drawing challenge in that the reader should later say, "So ''that's'' why Anarky looked so awkward!" Such awkwardness, in fact, was one reason I ''eliminated'' the fake head in the miniseries... Another reason for its excision is Lonnie's apparent onset of puberty in a big way; during his existence he's gained quite a few inches and pounds, filling out his costume! The change from black eyes to white may also be seen as indicating that Lonnie's ''real'' eyes now peer out of the mask.

Anarky's second costume retained the red jumpsuit, gold mask, and hat, but excised the red robe and head extender.  New additions included a red cape, golden utility belt, and a single, large circle-a across the chest, akin to [[Superman|Superman's]] iconic [[Superman logo|"S" shield]].  Within the ''Anarky'' series, secondary costumes were displayed in Anarky's base of operations.  Each was slightly altered in design, but followed the same basic theme.  These were designed for use in various situations, but only one, a "universal battle suit", was used during the brief series.<ref name="Anarky vol. two #one">{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Josef Rubinstein | Story = Aberration!

===Combat skills===
In 1995, Anarky was described as having begun to train in martial arts, following the character's time in juvenile hall.  By 1997, Alan Grant had increased this ability, describing the character as having progressed remarkably, and to have studied multiple styles, including [[Aikido]], [[Karate]], [[Jujutsu]], [[Chinese martial arts|Kung Fu]], which he "integrated" into a single fighting style.<ref name="Anarky vol. one #three">{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Josef Rubinstein | Story = Metamorphosis Part 3: The Economics of The Madhouse | Title = '''Anarky''' | Volume = 1 | Issue = 3 | Date = '''[[July 1]], [[1997]]''' | Publisher = '''DC Comics''' | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref> Following previous modes of behavior, he studied all possible fighting arts, but failed to specialize in any.  This largely helped him defend himself against most untrained criminals, but was later described as a decisive weakness whenever he fought opponents who were masters of a particular style.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Josef Rubinstein | Story = War and Peace, Part Two | Title = '''Anarky''' | Volume = 2 | Issue = 5 | Date = '''[[September 1]], [[1999]]''' | Publisher = '''DC Comics''' | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>

===Logistics, technology, and enhanced intelligence===
[[Image:Clip - Anarky - v1 - -3 (July 1997).jpg|thumb|right|Anarky tracks Batman's movements in ''[[Anarky (comic book)|Anarky]]'' (vol.1) #3. The scene exemplifies Anarky's reliance on the homeless, technology, and his [[Front organization|front corporation]], Anarco.]]
As a wanted criminal, Anarky's methods and goals were described as leaving him with little logistical support amongst the heroic community, or the public at large, relegating him to underground operation.  In his earliest incarnations, he was described as having developed skills as a "[[grey hat]]" computer [[hacker]] to steal enormous sums of money from various corporations.<ref name="six twenty">{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Steve Mitchell | Story = Rite of Passage Part 3: Make Me a Hero | Title = '''Detective Comics''' | Volume = 1 | Issue = 620 | Date = '''[[August 1]], [[1990]]''' | Publisher = '''DC Comics''' | Page = | Panel = | ID = }}</ref>  This addition to the character's skill set made him the second major hacker in the DC universe, being preceded by [[Barbara Gordon|Barbara Gordon's]] debut as ''Oracle'',<ref>{{cite book | last = Ostrander | first = John  | authorlink = John Ostrander | title = Suicide Squad (Vol. 1) #23| publisher = DC Comics | date = 2007 | url = http://www.dccomics.com/graphic_novels/?gn=8207 | isbn = 1401214916}}</ref> and was quickly adapted by 1992 to allow the character to gain information on other heroes and villains from police computer networks.<ref name="robin annual">{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Cowriters = John Wagner | Penciller = Tom Lyle | Inker = Scott Hanna | Story = The Anarky Ultimatum | Title = '''Robin Annual''' | Volume = | Issue = 1 | Date = '''[[1992]]''' | Publisher = '''DC Comics''' | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>  By 1997, the skill was further increased to allow him to tap into [[Batcomputer|Batman's supercomputer]],<ref name="Anarky vol. one #one">{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Josef Rubinstein | Story = Metamorphosis Part 1: Does a Dog Have a Buddha Nature? | Title = '''Anarky''' | Volume = 1 | Issue = 1 | Date = '''[[May 1]], [[1997]]''' | Publisher = '''DC Comics''' | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref> and the [[Justice League Watchtower]].<ref name="Anarky vol. two #one">{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Josef Rubinstein | Story = Aberration!

At this time, the tone of the character began to move away from improvised munitions, and toward self-sufficient funding for more elaborate technology.  By 1996 he was described as using the Internet to earn money through his online bookstore, ''Anarco'', which he used as a [[Front organization|front company]] to propagate his philosophy, and to communicate emergency messages to the general public warning of impending disaster.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Josef Rubinstein | Story = War and Peace, Part II | Title = '''Anarky''' | Volume = 2 | Issue = 6 | Date = '''[[October 1]], [[1999]]''' | Publisher = '''DC Comics''' | Page = 3 | Panel = 1-5 | ID = }}</ref>  A second front organization, ''The Anarkist Foundation'', was also developed to offer grants to radical causes he supports.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = John Paul Leon | Inker = Ray McCarthy | Story = Anarky, Part One: Prophet of Doom | Title = '''Batman: Shadow of the Bat''' | Volume =  | Issue = 40 | Date = '''[[July 1]], [[1995]]''' | Publisher = '''DC Comics''' | Page = 18 | Panel = 4, 5 | ID = }}</ref>  In one issue of the ''Anarky'' series, a brief scene is shown in which Lonnie Machin uses the Internet to hold an [[instant messaging|instant messaging session]] with the public in which he debated the need for war, arguing that money and time used on the military research would be better spent on agriculture to solve the global [[overpopulation]] crisis.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Josef Rubinstein | Story = War and Peace, Part II | Title = '''Anarky''' | Volume = 2 | Issue = 6 | Date = '''[[October 1]], [[1999]]''' | Publisher = '''DC Comics''' | Page = 19 | Panel = | ID = }}</ref>

In 1996 Grant used a ''Biofeedback Learning Enhancer'' as a plot device to increase Lonnie's abilities.  The device was described as being capable of increasing Anarky's brain functions by a multiple of ten.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = John Paul Leon | Inker = Ray McCarthy | Story = Anarky, Part One: Prophet of Doom | Title = '''Batman: Shadow of the Bat''' | Volume =  | Issue = 40 | Date = '''[[July 1]] [[1995]]''' | Publisher = '''DC Comics''' | Page = 18 | Panel = 4, 5 | ID = }}</ref>  With this enhanced intelligence, and the increased financial independence described above, Anarky went on to create an on-board [[Artificial intelligence|AI computer]], '''MAX''' ('''''M'''ulti-'''A'''ugmented '''X'''-Program'');<ref name="Anarky vol. two #one">{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Norm Breyfogle | Inker = Josef Rubinstein | Story = Aberration!

==Alternate versions==
===Armageddon 2001===
In ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman Annual]]'' # 15, "''The Last Batman Story''", part of the ''[[Armageddon 2001]]'' crossover event, the [[time travel]]er, [[Waverider (comics)|Waverider]], shows Batman a possible future. In the (relatively) not-too-distant year of 2001, an aged Batman is found guilty of murder for the accidental death of [[Penguin (comics)|The Penguin]], and sentenced to death.  Anarky, now in his mid-twenties, sympathizes with the fallen hero and breaks into the prison in an attempt to rescue Batman mere hours before the execution is to take place.  Believing himself guilty, Batman initially refuses to escape.  However, when he discovers evidence that the accident was set up by a third party, he asks Lonnie Machin to switch costumes with him so that he can pursue the true murderer.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Cowriters = John Wagner | Penciller = Jim Fern | Inker = Steve Leahloha | Story = The Last Batman Story | Title = '''Batman Annual''' | Volume = | Issue = 15 | Date = '''[[1991]]''' | Publisher = '''DC Comics''' | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>  In contrast to his original counterpart, it is implied that this version of Anarky was willing to kill opponents.

===The Tyrant===
Within an ''[[Elseworlds]]'' story entitled "''The Tyrant''", a corrupt Batman (under the influence of [[Scarecrow (comics)|Jonathan Crane]]) uses his resources to usurp power in the city of [[Gotham City|Gotham]] and institute a police state in which he exercises hegemonic control over the city's population.  Anarky, armed with a ''Holo-Costume'' projector to disguise himself, becomes a [[Resistance movement|resistance leader]] and attempts to undermine and disrupt Batman's control.  When Lonnie uncovers a secret plan to pump tranquilizer gas into the city water supply, drugging the populace to prevent crime, he unites the city's remaining villains to storm the centers of Batman's power and overthrow his tyranny.  After Crane's manipulations are exposed, Batman confesses his crimes to the people of Gotham City, who then burn him alive inside Wayne Manor.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Tom Raney | Copencillers = Joe Staton | Inker = Tom Raney | Coinkers = Horacio Ottolini | Story = The Tyrant | Title = '''Batman: Shadow of the Bat Annual''' | Volume = | Issue = 2 | Date = '''[[1994]]''' | Publisher = '''DC Comics''' | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}
</ref>   The story ends with a quote by [[Mikhail Bakunin]]: "(For reasons of the state) black becomes white and white becomes black, the horrible becomes humane and the most dastardly felonies and atrocious crimes become meritorious acts."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_archives/bakunin/rousseau.html |title=Rousseau's Theory of the State |accessdate=2007-03-09 |last=Bakunin |first=Mikhail |authorlink=Mikhail Bakunin |format=html |work=Anarchy Archives |publisher=Pitzer College}}</ref>

===The DCAU===
Anarky appeared in the [[DC animated universe]] in 1995, in ''[[The Batman Adventures]]'' #31, ''"The People's Court"''.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = Alan Grant | Penciller = Dev Madan | Inker = Rick Burchett | Story = The People's Court | Title = '''The Batman Adventures''' | Volume = | Issue = 31 | Date = '''[[April 1]], [[1995]]''' | Publisher = '''DC Comics''' | Page = | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>  Anarky begins holding wealthy business elites hostage and places them on public trial, broadcast from a pirate TV show.  He charges his victims with such crimes as the creation of [[land mine]]s that kill or cripple thousands, funding [[Third World]] dictators, polluting the air with toxic chemicals, and profiting from [[wage slavery]].  He also captures [[Batman|Bruce Wayne]], and while conceding that Wayne has ethical business practices, implicates him for "the company he keeps."  At each trial, Anarky gives the "defendants" the opportunity to speak for themselves, and then asks the viewing audience to phone in one-hundred calls if they find them not guilty, which will deactivate bombs set before the men.  As the citizens begin to debate the fate of these men amongst themselves, [[Dick Grayson|Robin]] succeeds in tracking down the broadcast.  However, when he fails to prevent the explosions from taking place, it is revealed that the bombs are fake, and the public trials were only intended to expose the men and raise public awareness.  Anarky is ultimately apprehended, but Robin is left questioning if he wasn't right in his charges against the businessmen.  As of 2007, this story features the only encounter between any version of Anarky and [[Dick Grayson]].

Anarky did not appear in any DCAU animated series.
