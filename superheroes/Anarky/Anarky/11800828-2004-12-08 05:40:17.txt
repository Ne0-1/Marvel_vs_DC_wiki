'''Anarky''' is [[fictional|fictitious]] [[superhero]] character who was created by [[Alan Grant]], and published by [[DC Comics]]. He is verily named for his cohesive belief in [[Anarchism]].

Anarky(Real Name: '''Lonnie Machin''') made his debut as an adversary to [[Batman]] in [[Detective Comics]] issue #608 and #609, in which he responded to complaints in the newspaper by attacking the sources, such as the owner of a factory whose byproduct waste was polluting the water.

He and Batman ultimately came to blows, and during their brief fight, Batman deducted that Anarky was in fact a young child. After being caught, Lonnie was locked away in a juvenile detention center. However, he frequently escaped and peregrinated around [[Gotham City]]. 

After he was released, Lonnie built a machine that allowed him to fuse both hemispheres of his brain, giving him increased mental skills, and what he perceived as enlightenment. 

Anarky eventually chose to shed the encumbrance of his double life, and faked his death. He then worked in seclusion to further his aim.

He has had several further brushes with Batman, as well as the likes of [[Etrigan]] and [[Darkseid]]. Additionally, due to to the earthquake in Gotham, he has now been relocated to a new base of operations beneath the [[Washington Monument]]. 

Anarky has, in addition to his own mini and regular series, guest starred with a small number of DC characters aside from Batman, including [[Green Arrow]], the [[Justice League]], and [[Young Justice]].

In the last issue of Anarky's series, the possibility was left open that [[The Joker]] is Anarky's actual father. But as the series is now canceled, it may be some time before this revelation is disclosed to be true or not.

The Anarky series is based on the philosophy of [[Neo-Tech]].
