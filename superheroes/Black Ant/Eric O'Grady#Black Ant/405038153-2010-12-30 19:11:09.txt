==Publication history==
Gaywyatt was the main character in the ongoing monthly series ''The Irredeemable Ant-Man'', with the "Irredeemable" title given to the comic's title to indicate the character's immoral attitude and behavior. The series was canceled after issue #12, though no official cancellation notice was given (as Marvel Comics simply opted to not solicit issues of ''The Irredeemable Ant-Man'' beyond #12, though the final issue did mercilessly mock the idea of cancellation, such as having Eric scream in spite towards a massive assault of canceled comic characters).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=118154|title=Kirkman On the End of Ant-Man|date=June 25, 2007|author=Steve Ekstrom |publisher=[[Newsarama]]|accessdate=June 15, 2008}}</ref>

Though canceled, the series ended with Eric O'Grady becoming enrolled in [[Avengers: The Initiative|the Initiative]]. With ''Avengers: The Initiative'' #8, O'Grady joined the title's cast.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=12099|title=Marvel's State of the Initiative with Dan Slott|author=Shaun Manning|date=December 5, 2007|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|accessdate=December 26, 2010}}</ref> He departed from the title after ''Avengers: The Initiative'' #20, and as of ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' #128, is a member of the new Thunderbolts team.

==Fictional character biography==
Eric O'Grady is a low-level agent of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] who stumbles upon Dr. [[Henry Pym|Henry Pym's]] latest incarnation of the [[Ant-Man]] suit in S.H.I.E.L.D.'s headquarters.<ref name=TIAM1>[[Robert Kirkman]] (w), [[Phil Hester]] (p), [[Ande Parks]] (i), ''The Irredeemable Ant-Man'' #1 (October 04, 2006), [[Marvel Comics]]</ref> A man of very few morals and willingness to lie, cheat, steal, and manipulate in order to get ahead in life, Eric immediately steals the armor for his own selfish plans, which include using his status as a "super-hero" to stalk women and facilitate his thievery. He eventually has a change of heart, and resolves to become a better person and renounce his past life.

===The Irredeemable Ant-Man===
[[Mitch Carson]], whom O'Grady looks up to, is a S.H.I.E.L.D. security agent under [[Dum Dum Dugan]]. Originally picked out to be the wearer of the Ant Man suit O'Grady stole, he was forced to wear a hastily built prototype suit based on the armor O'Grady had stolen. When S.H.I.E.L.D. discovered that O'Grady had stolen the suit, Carson confronted Eric in the new experimental suit. In the ensuing battle, Eric disfigured his friend's face by accident with his suit's jets, burning the left half of Carson's face and leaving him deaf and blind on that side as well. Despite what he did, O'Grady took him to the infirmary nearby to help the injured Mitch, who later vowed revenge. 

As his series progressed, it is revealed that O'Grady's best friend and fellow S.H.I.E.L.D. surveillance agent Chris McCarthy, was the first person who actually wore what would become O'Grady's Ant-Man suit.<ref name=TIAM1/> McCarthy was killed however, during a [[HYDRA]] attack when he was shot in the head by a HYDRA agent. Eric took the suit off of Chris's dead body just before the Helicarrier crashed.<ref>[[Robert Kirkman]] (w), [[Phil Hester]] (p), [[Ande Parks]] (i), ''The Irredeemable Ant-Man'' #2 (November 01, 2006), [[Marvel Comics]]</ref> With his best friend dead, Eric sets his sights on seducing and bedding Chris's girlfriend, Veronica King. The attraction resulted in the two having sex, leading to Veronica King's pregnancy and Ant Man ultimately abandoning her.<ref>[[Robert Kirkman]] (w), [[Phil Hester]] (p), [[Ande Parks]] (i), ''The Irredeemable Ant-Man'' #5 (February 07, 2007), [[Marvel Comics]]</ref>

Despite his attempts to seduce Veronica, Ant Man continuously uses his powers of shrinking to stalk women and watch them in various stages of undress, with [[Ms. Marvel]] of [[The Mighty Avengers]] being a popular target for his ever-increasing voyeurism. 

Eric also encounters the thief [[Black Fox (comics)|Black Fox]], and steals his possessions. Black Fox later shows up looking for the jewels. O'Grady, however, had already sold them to a pawn shop. The two work together, getting the $150,000 back and splitting the proceeds, with O'Grady keeping 15 percent.<ref>[[Robert Kirkman]] (w), [[Phil Hester]] (p), [[Ande Parks]] (i), ''The Irredeemable Ant-Man'' #8 (May 23, 2007), [[Marvel Comics]]</ref>

After saving the life of a child, Ant-Man encounters [[Damage Control (comics)|Damage Control]].<ref>[[Robert Kirkman]] (w), [[Phil Hester]] (p), [[Ande Parks]] (i), ''The Irredeemable Ant-Man'' #7 (April 04, 2007), [[Marvel Comics]]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicsbulletin.com/reviews/117581582534672.htm|title=Irredeemable Ant-Man #7 Review|author=Kevin Powers|date=April 5, 2007|publisher=[[Comics Bulletin]]|accessdate=December 26, 2010}}</ref> This organization offers him a job and, after he obtains a [[fake ID]] under the name '''Derek Sullivan''' and comes up with a new superhero name ('''Slaying Mantis'''), he consents. He meets a woman named Abigail, who he starts [[dating]]. He leases an apartment under his new name and with Damage Control's help begins to establish a new identity while continuing to hide from S.H.I.E.L.D. However, as Abigail begins to fall in love with Eric, she reveals to him that she is a [[Single parent|single mother]] with a son. This in turn triggers Eric dumping Abigail over her keeping her son's existence a secret from him while pursuing a romantic relationship with him.<ref>[[Robert Kirkman]] (w), [[Phil Hester]] (p), [[Ande Parks]] (i), ''The Irredeemable Ant-Man'' #9 (June 06, 2007), [[Marvel Comics]]</ref>

During a later confrontation with Abigail, she reveals that she possesses the power to read people's emotions telepathically. She promptly then accuses Eric of truly loving her, through use of her powers to scan Eric's mind for his true feelings about her. Before he can answer though, the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] attacks Manhattan (See [[World War Hulk]]). Eric reluctantly joins the fray by attacking  the Hulk from the inside of his body.  However, the Hulk's stomach and innards proved to be just as tough and Eric ended up being discharged through one of the nostrils.  He awoke in a S.H.I.E.L.D. infirmary, with Mitch Carson standing by his bed, stating that he was under arrest.<ref>[[Robert Kirkman]] (w), [[Phil Hester]] (p), [[Ande Parks]] (i), ''The Irredeemable Ant-Man'' #10 (July 05, 2007), [[Marvel Comics]]</ref>

Carson takes Eric to a secret room aboard the [[helicarrier]], and proceeds to torture him, using the Ant-Man suit to internally wound him. Just as Carson is on the verge of burning Eric's face with the suit's jet boosters, [[Iron Man]] arrives and subdues him.  Eric decides to pin the whole stolen-suit fiasco on Carson, saying that he was only trying to stop him from using the suit for evil. Iron Man refuses to believe Eric though Iron Man is quickly sidetracked by the arrival of the [[Black Fox (comics)|Black Fox]] (who had become friends with Eric after their first encounter). Black Fox demands that Eric be released and claims to have placed explosives on the helicarrier in order to extort his friend's freedom. Eric refuses Fox's claims to protect him from Iron Man, leading to Fox being arrested.<ref name=TIAM11>[[Robert Kirkman]] (w), [[Phil Hester]] (p), [[Ande Parks]] (i), ''The Irredeemable Ant-Man'' #11 (August 01, 2007), [[Marvel Comics]]</ref>

Several weeks pass and while Carson's fate is left unresolved, it is shown that Eric has resumed his post upon Helicarrier, having been offered his own job under unknown circumstances.<ref name=TIAM11/> Feeling guilty for Black Fox being in jail, Eric helps the elderly thief escape from the helicarrier, with Eric admitting that he was sorry for putting Black Fox through the ordeal of being arrested. Later on, Eric refuses Veronica's attempt to try and work out an arrangement for raising their child together, in part because of Eric's inner fear that he would be a horrible father due to his utter lack of morals or ethics. Meanwhile, despite their misgivings, Iron Man and Hank Pym reluctantly offer Eric his old Ant Man suit back after determining that none of the other candidates can control the suit to the degree that Eric has already demonstrated, on the condition of him becoming part of the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Initiative]], which Eric accepts.<ref name=TIAM12>[[Robert Kirkman]] (w), [[Phil Hester]] (p), [[Ande Parks]] (i), ''The Irredeemable Ant-Man'' #12 (September 19, 2007), [[Marvel Comics]]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicsbulletin.com/reviews/119039418574729.htm|title=Irredeemable Ant-Man #12 Review|author=Kevin Powers|date=September 21, 2007|publisher=[[Comics Bulletin]]|accessdate=December 26, 2010}}</ref>

Eric also has one last meeting with Abigail and tells her that he does, indeed, love her. However, he tells Abigail that he will be leaving for a while and wishes to be with her. While doing so, he hopes that he can be a better person. Before leaving, he tells her his real name.<ref name=TIAM12/>

===The Initiative===
In spite of his vows to Abigail though, Eric continues his lewd and irredeemable ways upon joining the Initiative. He appears in [[Camp Hammond (comics)|Camp Hammond]], as an official recruit for the Initiative, along with [[Crusader (Marvel Comics)#Crusader (Skrull)|Crusader]], [[Melee (comics)|Melee]], [[Geldoff]], [[Dragon Lord (comics)#Tako Shamara|Dragon Lord]], [[Geiger (comics)|Geiger]], [[Red Nine]], and [[Diamondback (comics)|Diamondback]].<ref name="Avengers: The Initiative #8">''Avengers: The Initiative'' #8</ref>

In particular, during his first meeting with the [[Taskmaster]], Eric attempts to slander the name of his predecessor, [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Scott Lang]] by passing off stories of his lewd stalker behavior regarding Ms Marvel onto Scott, as well as claiming that Scott Lang was never really an official Avenger and that he was simply hiding inside the Avengers mansion during his tenure with the team and following the group around as a hanger-on. Unfortunately, Scott's daughter [[Cassandra Lang|Cassie]] overhears Taskmaster and Eric laughing at Eric's lies and attacks by growing to giant size and attempts to step on the human-sized Eric. Using his suit to increase his size to fight the giant-sized version of Cassie, Eric tricks her into thinking she had stepped on and killed the hero [[Stingray (comics)|Stingray]], in order to knock her down with a cheap shot. This in turn causes Hank Pym to grow giant-sized and attack Eric, who upon defeating Cassie begins to mock her by yelling "Who's Your Daddy Now?". However, as their fight begins to attract the attention of people outside the Initiative compound, the Taskmaster brings all three of the giants down with his shield.<ref name="Avengers: The Initiative #8"/>

O'Grady is defeated by a clone of [[Michael Van Patrick|MVP]], along with most of the recruits in his class.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #9</ref>  He hid under an unconscious Geiger and survived mostly unharmed. He hid from the rest of the action along with the Taskmaster.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative #10''</ref>

Eric is later seen having a counseling session with [[Trauma (comics)|Trauma]], who helped him with a repressed "naked Santa" memory from his childhood.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative #14''</ref>

When the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull invasion]] occurs in New York city, the Initiative are ordered to fight. Eric decides to avoid this by shrinking down and hiding.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative #15''</ref> He soon discovers, however, that the Skrulls have taken over Camp Hammond.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #16</ref> He aids the Shadow Initiative in a failed attempt to assassinate Queen [[Veranke]].<ref>''Avengers: the Initiative'' #17</ref> Escaping by once again shrinking down, Eric discovers the Skrulls' last resort plan: to open a giant [[Negative Zone]] portal, and have the entire United States removed from this dimension. Escaping the Skrulls on the back of one of their shock troopers, Eric brings the information to some of the remaining Initiative members, and they set out to stop the plan from happening.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #18</ref> 

Following the Invasion's end, Eric is commended for his good work, and is promoted to a position in the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #20</ref>

===Thunderbolts===
In their first mission, Ant-Man and the second [[Black Widow (Yelena Belova)|Black Widow]] sneak aboard, Ant-Man hidden in Black Widow's cleavage and take control of [[Air Force One]] with [[Norman Osborn]], [[Doc Samson]], and the new President aboard. He secretly plants a gamma emitter on [[Doc Samson]], causing the doctor to increase in strength and anger, which makes him attack the president.<ref name="Thunderbolts #128">''Thunderbolts'' #128</ref>

However, O'Grady began to regret his actions in the Thunderbolts but can't do anything about it, since Osborn would have him killed. [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]] advised that he wait until Osborn [[Siege (comics)|inevitably loses his mind and is taken down]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #133</ref> Ant-Man later secretly witnesses Paladin [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]] and [[Headsman (comics)|Headsman]] turn against [[Mister X (Marvel Comics)|Mister X]] and [[Nuke (Marvel Comics)|Scourge]] when they are ordered to execute [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Natasha Romanoff]] and [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]], then erase their teammates memories.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #136</ref> He later assists in the capture of [[Luke Cage]] by entering his nervous system. However, when his teammates make no effort to extract him, O'Grady helps Cage to escape, later leaving his body while he is eating.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #137</ref>

O'Grady becomes increasingly disgruntled with the Thunderbolts, and concerned for his future.  In order to earn some goodwill, he helps [[Bucky|Captain America]] escape from custody in ''[[Captain America: Reborn]]'', asking that he keep this in mind in the future.<ref>''Captain America: Reborn'' #4</ref>  Later, when sent with the rest of the team to infiltrate [[Asgard]] and steal [[Gungnir]], he once again faces off with [[Cassandra Lang|Stature]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #142</ref>

After Scourge finds Gungnir, he attempts to take it to Osborn, but is stopped by Paladin, who has finally had enough of serving a madman. His teammate Grizzly attacks Paladin and attempts to kill him for treason but O'Grady shrinks down and enters Grizzly's ear canal, incapacitating him and saving Paladin's life. As the Mighty Avengers defeat what remains of the Thunderbolts, O'Grady finds Gungnir and gives it to Paladin, who decides to take it to a safe place where Osborn cannot find it. He says goodbye to O'Grady and departs. After the battle, O'Grady decides to re-evaluate the choices he has made and to do something good with his life.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #144</ref>

===Secret Avengers===
O'Grady has been confirmed to be a member of the [[Secret Avengers]], using Hank Pym's classic gear.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=25808|title=C2E2: Cup O' Joe|author=Kiel Phegley|date=April 17, 2010|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|accessdate=December 26, 2010}}</ref>

He was invited by former Captain America Steve Rogers, who believes that O'Grady can be a better person.<ref name="Secret Avengers #1">''Secret Avengers'' #1</ref> He's positioned as the rookie of the team, who is teamed up with [[War Machine]], who believes he's not worthy of the Ant-Man name.<ref name="Secret Avengers #2">''Secret Avengers'' #2</ref>

In the arc of the opening four issues, Eric inadvertantly stumbled upon a group of [[Shadow Council]] agents planning to blow up his team mates with a bomb, but was able to defeat them by detonating it early.

== Powers and abilities ==
While wearing the Ant-Man [[armor]], O'Grady has the ability to shrink to the size of an [[insect]] while retaining full-sized strength.  He also possesses two robotic arms he can release from the back of his armor when he is shrunk.  The armor's main mode of transportation is a [[jetpack]] that can be detached and used as a weapon by turning the jet's flames onto an enemy. He also has the ability to talk to insects while wearing the suit.  However, he has not quite trained in this ability and is somewhat lacking in skill. 

After joining The Initiative, it was revealed that O'Grady's armor was the prototype ''G.I. Ant-Man'' suit that could also increase O'Grady's size.  During his appearances in ''Avengers: the Initiative'', Eric's helmet seemed to become more of a close-fitting piece of fabric, as it moulded itself to his facial expressions, and could even be peeled upwards to allow him to drink.  

Following his induction into the Thunderbolts, Eric's suit is redesigned and recolored, to better fit his new covert operations position.<ref name="Thunderbolts #128"/>

When he joined the Secret Avengers, his costume was redesigned to resemble the original Ant-Man armor.<ref name="Secret Avengers #1"/> It was also fitted with [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp-like]] stingers in the gloves.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' #4</ref>  The armour retains the 'cyberlegs' of the original, not visible when retracted<ref>''Ant-Man & Wasp'' #2</ref>.

In addition to changes to his helmet and armour, Eric's hairstyle has changed throughout his appearances.  In his eponymous series, he sported distinctive [[mutton chops]], although he appears to have shaved them off by the time he joined the Thunderbolts and Secret Avengers.  Despite this, in the mini-series ''Ant-Man and the Wasp'' (set between Thunderbolts and Secret Avengers) the mutton chops are on his face once again.
