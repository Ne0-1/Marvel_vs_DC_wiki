The fourth character to use the '''[[Ant-Man]]''' name, he was created by [[Robert Kirkman]] and [[Phil Hester (comics)|Phil Hester]], and [[first appearance|first appears]] in ''Irredeemable Ant-Man'' #1 (December [[2006 in comics|2006]]).

==Publication history==
Eric O'Grady was the main character in the ongoing monthly series ''The Irredeemable Ant-Man'', with the "Irredeemable" title given to the comic's title to indicate the character's immoral attitude and behavior. The series was canceled after issue #12, though no official cancellation notice was given (as Marvel Comics simply opted to not solicit issues of ''The Irredeemable Ant-Man'' beyond #12, though the final issue did mercilessly mock the idea of cancellation, such as having Eric scream in spite towards a massive assault of canceled comic characters).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=118154|title=Kirkman On the End of Ant-Man|date=June 25, 2007|author=Steve Ekstrom |publisher=[[Newsarama]]|accessdate=June 15, 2008}}</ref>

Though canceled, the series ended with the character becoming enrolled in [[Fifty State Initiative|the Initiative]]. With ''Avengers: The Initiative'' #8, O'Grady joined the title's cast.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=12099|title=Marvel's State of the Initiative with Dan Slott|author=Shaun Manning|date=December 5, 2007|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|accessdate=December 26, 2010}}</ref> He departed from the title after ''Avengers: The Initiative'' #20, and as of ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' #128, is a member of the new Thunderbolts team.

Ant-Man appeared as a regular character throughout the 2010â€“2013 ''Secret Avengers'' series, from issue #1 (July 2010) through the character's death in issue #23 (April 2012); the character was replaced by a [[Life Model Decoy]] with all of his memories in the following issue, renaming itself the Black Ant in issue #32, revealing itself as an antagonist in issue #36, before disappearing in its final issue #37 (March 2013).

==Fictional character biography==
Eric O'Grady is a low-level agent of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] who stumbles upon [[Hank Pym|Dr. Henry "Hank" Pym]]'s latest incarnation of the Ant-Man suit in the S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters.<ref name=TIAM1>[[Robert Kirkman]] (w), [[Phil Hester (comics)|Phil Hester]] (p), [[Ande Parks]] (i), ''The Irredeemable Ant-Man'' #1 (October 4, 2006), [[Marvel Comics]]</ref> A man of very few morals and willingness to lie, cheat, steal and manipulate in order to get ahead in life, O'Grady immediately steals the armor for his own selfish plans, which include using his status as a "super-hero" to stalk women and facilitate his thievery. A running theme with the character is his evil side clashing with a desire to be accepted by others, which leads to Eric vowing to renounce his evil ways and become a proper hero, leading to a cycle of the character relapsing and vowing to "change".

===The Irredeemable Ant-Man===
[[Mitchell Carson|Mitch Carson]] is a S.H.I.E.L.D. security agent under [[Dum Dum Dugan]] and someone whom Eric O'Grady looks up to. During the "Enemy of the State" story, Wolverine attacks the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier and Mitch order Eric and his roommate Chris McCarthy to guard Hank Pym and the new Ant-Man suit. Pym walks out and they panic and knock him out. McCarthy accidentally runs off with the suit to escape [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]],<ref name=TIAM1/> but later when [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]] attacks the Helicarrier a month later Eric finds McCarthy and steals the suit from his dead body, after being shot by a HYDRA agent.<ref>Robert Kirkman (w), Phil Hester (p), Ande Parks (i), ''The Irredeemable Ant-Man'' #2 (November 1, 2006), Marvel Comics</ref> Instead of returning the suit, he steals stuff, peeps on the woman's showers and tries to seduce, and accidentally impregnate McCarthy's girlfriend.<ref>Robert Kirkman (w), Phil Hester (p), Ande Parks (i), ''The Irredeemable Ant-Man'' #5 (February 7, 2007), Marvel Comics</ref> Carson, originally trained to be the stolen Ant-Man suit's wearer, was forced to wear a hastily built prototype suit and track down the thief. Carson is able to track down O'Grady, but in the ensuing battle, Eric disfigured Carson's face by accident with his suit's jets, burning the left half of Carson's face and leaving Carson deaf and blind on that side as well. O'Grady took Mitch to the infirmary nearby to help the injured Mitch, but he still vowed revenge.<ref>''Irredeemable Ant-Man'' Issue #6</ref>

After escaping the helicarrier he then uses his powers to continue peeping and only saves attartracive woman who he then tries to bed. He eventually tries to sneak into [[Carol Danvers|Ms. Marvel]]'s purse, now leader of the [[Mighty Avengers (comics)|Mighty Avengers]].<ref>''Irredeemable Ant-Man'' #6</ref>

During a battle, Eric tries looting a jewelry store and encounters the thief [[Black Fox (comics)|Black Fox]] and steals his stolen bag of jewels. He reluctantly saves a girls life from rubble and encounters [[Damage Control (comics)|Damage Control's]] new "Search and Rescue" team.<ref>Robert Kirkman (w), Phil Hester (p), Ande Parks (i), ''The Irredeemable Ant-Man'' #7 (April 04, 2007), Marvel Comics</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicsbulletin.com/reviews/117581582534672.htm|title=Irredeemable Ant-Man #7 Review|author=Kevin Powers|date=April 5, 2007|publisher=[[Comics Bulletin]]|accessdate=December 26, 2010}}</ref>

After he obtains a [[fake ID]] under the name '''Derek Sullivan''' and comes up with the new superhero name '''Slaying Mantis''', this organization offers him a job and he consents. He meets a woman Abigail and they start [[dating]]. He leases an apartment under his new name, and with Damage Control's help, begins to establish a new identity while continuing to hide from S.H.I.E.L.D. However, as Abigail begins to fall in love with Eric, she reveals to him that she is a [[Single parent|single mother]] with a son. This in turn triggers Eric dumping Abigail over keeping her son's existence a secret from him while pursuing a romantic relationship with him.<ref>Robert Kirkman (w), Phil Hester (p), Ande Parks (i), ''The Irredeemable Ant-Man'' #9 (June 06, 2007), Marvel Comics</ref>

Black Fox later shows up looking for the jewels. O'Grady, however, had already sold them to a pawn shop. The two work together, getting the $150,000 back and splitting the proceeds, with O'Grady keeping 15 percent. They form a close friendship afterward.<ref>Robert Kirkman (w), Phil Hester (p), Ande Parks (i), ''The Irredeemable Ant-Man'' #8 (May 23, 2007), Marvel Comics</ref>

During a later confrontation with Abigail, she reveals that she possesses the power to read people's emotions telepathically. She promptly then accuses Eric of truly loving her, through use of her powers to scan Eric's mind for his true feelings about her. Before he can answer though, the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] [[World War Hulk|attacks]] Manhattan. Eric reluctantly joins the fray by attacking Hulk from the inside of his body. However, Hulk's stomach and innards proved to be just as tough and Eric ended up being discharged through one of the nostrils. He awoke in a S.H.I.E.L.D. infirmary, with Mitch Carson standing by his bed, stating that he was under arrest.<ref>Robert Kirkman (w), Phil Hester (p), Ande Parks (i), ''The Irredeemable Ant-Man'' #10 (July 05, 2007), Marvel Comics</ref>

Carson takes Eric to a secret room aboard the helicarrier, and proceeds to torture him. While doing so, Carson reveals shocking secrets to Eric regarding his own sociopathic nature and how he has abused his position as a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent to cover up murders he has committed over the years. Just as Carson is on the verge of burning Eric's face with the suit's jet boosters, [[Iron Man]] arrives and subdues him. Eric uses Carson's confessions of past misdeeds to frame him for the whole stolen-suit fiasco, saying that he was only trying to stop him from using the suit for evil. Iron Man refuses to believe Eric, though Iron Man is quickly sidetracked by the arrival of the Black Fox (now friends with Eric after their first encounter). Black Fox demands that Eric be released and claims to have placed explosives on the helicarrier in order to extort his friend's freedom. Eric refuses Black Fox's claims to protect him from Iron Man, leading to Black Fox being arrested.<ref name=TIAM11>Robert Kirkman (w), Phil Hester (p), Ande Parks (i), ''The Irredeemable Ant-Man'' #11 (August 01, 2007), Marvel Comics</ref>

Several weeks pass and while Carson's fate is left unresolved, it is shown that Eric has resumed his post upon the helicarrier, having been offered his own job under unknown circumstances.<ref name=TIAM11/> Feeling guilty for Black Fox being in jail, Eric helps the elderly thief escape from the helicarrier, with Eric admitting that he was sorry for putting Black Fox through the ordeal of being arrested. Later on, Eric refuses Veronica's attempt to work out an arrangement for raising their child together, in part because of Eric's inner fear that he would be a horrible father due to his utter lack of morals or ethics. Meanwhile, despite their misgivings, Iron Man and Hank Pym reluctantly offer Eric his old Ant Man suit back after determining that none of the other candidates can control the suit to the degree that Eric has already demonstrated, on the condition of him becoming part of the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Initiative]], which Eric accepts.<ref name=TIAM12>Robert Kirkman (w), Phil Hester (p), Ande Parks (i), ''The Irredeemable Ant-Man'' #12 (September 19, 2007), Marvel Comics</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicsbulletin.com/reviews/119039418574729.htm|title=Irredeemable Ant-Man #12 Review|author=Kevin Powers|date=September 21, 2007|publisher=[[Comics Bulletin]]|accessdate=December 26, 2010}}</ref>

Eric also has one last meeting with Abigail and tells her that he does, indeed, love her. However, he tells Abigail that he will be leaving for a while and wishes to be with her. While doing so, he hopes that he can be a better person. Before leaving, he tells her his real name.<ref name=TIAM12/>

===The Initiative===
In spite of his vows to Abigail though, Eric O'Grady continues his lewd and irredeemable ways upon joining the Initiative. He appears in [[Camp Hammond (comics)|Camp Hammond]], as an official recruit for the Initiative, along with [[Crusader (Marvel Comics)#Crusader (Skrull)|Crusader]], [[Melee (comics)|Melee]], [[Geldoff]], [[Dragon Lord (comics)#Tako Shamara|Dragon Lord]], [[Geiger (comics)|Geiger]], [[Red Nine]], and [[Diamondback (Rachel Leighton)|Diamondback]].<ref name="Avengers: The Initiative #8">''Avengers: The Initiative'' #8</ref>

In particular, during his first meeting with [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]], Eric attempts to slander the Ant-Man name of his predecessor [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Scott Lang]] by passing off stories of his lewd stalker behavior regarding Ms. Marvel onto Scott, as well as claiming that Lang was never really an official member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and that Lang was simply hiding inside the Avengers mansion during his tenure with the team and following the group around as a hanger-on. Unfortunately, Scott's [[Cassandra Lang|daughter]] overhears Taskmaster and Eric laughing at Eric's lies and attacks by growing to giant size and attempts to step on the human-sized Eric. Using his suit to increase his size to fight the giant-sized girl, Eric tricks Stature into thinking the hero [[Stingray (comics)|Stingray]] had been stepped on and killed in order to knock down with a cheap shot, mocking yelling "Who's Your Daddy Now?". This in turn causes Hank Pym to grow giant-sized and attack Eric. However, as their fight begins to attract the attention of people outside the Initiative compound, Taskmaster brings all three of the giants down with his shield.<ref name="Avengers: The Initiative #8"/>

O'Grady is defeated by a clone of [[Michael Van Patrick|MVP]], along with most of the recruits in his class.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #9</ref> He hid under an unconscious Geiger and survived mostly unharmed. He hid from the rest of the action along with the Taskmaster.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative #10''</ref>

Eric is later seen having a counseling session with [[Trauma (comics)|Trauma]] helping him with a repressed "naked [[Santa Claus|Santa]]" memory from his childhood.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative #14''</ref>

When the [[Skrull]] [[Secret Invasion|invasion]] occurs in [[New York City]], the Initiative are ordered to fight. Eric decides to avoid this by shrinking down and hiding.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative #15''</ref> He soon discovers, however, that the Skrulls have taken over Camp Hammond.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #16</ref> He aids the Shadow Initiative in a failed attempt to assassinate [[Veranke|Queen Veranke]].<ref>''Avengers: the Initiative'' #17</ref> Escaping by once again shrinking down, Eric discovers the Skrulls' last resort plan: to open a giant [[Negative Zone]] portal, and have the entire United States removed from this dimension. During this time, Eric muses that the Skrulls planned for every possible complication that Earth's heroes might have created, but did not plan on a "one-inch tall coward" running around underfoot. Escaping the Skrulls on the back of one of their shock troopers, Eric brings the information to some of the remaining Initiative members, and they set out to stop the plan from happening.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #18</ref>

Following the Skrulls' defeat, Eric is commended for his good work, and is promoted to a position in the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #20</ref>

===Thunderbolts===
In their first mission, Ant-Man and [[Black Widow (Yelena Belova)|Black Widow]] (Yelena Belova) sneak aboard, Ant-Man hidden in Black Widow's cleavage and take control of [[Air Force One]] with [[Norman Osborn]], [[Doc Samson]] and the new President aboard. He secretly plants a gamma emitter on Doc Samson, causing the doctor to increase in strength and anger, and attack the President.<ref name="Thunderbolts #128">''Thunderbolts'' #128</ref>

However, O'Grady began to regret his actions in the Thunderbolts but can't do anything since Osborn would have him killed. [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]] advised that he wait until Osborn [[Siege (comics)|inevitably goes insane and is taken down]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #133</ref> Ant-Man later secretly witnesses Paladin, [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]] and [[Headsman (comics)|Headsman]] turn against [[Mister X (Marvel Comics)|Mister X]] and [[Nuke (Marvel Comics)|Scourge]] when they are ordered to execute [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] (Natasha Romanoff) and [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]], then erase their teammates' memories.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #136</ref> He later assists in the capture of [[Luke Cage]] by entering Luke's nervous system. However, when his teammates make no effort to extract him, O'Grady helps Cage to escape, later leaving his body while he is eating.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #137</ref>

O'Grady becomes increasingly disgruntled with the Thunderbolts, and concerned for his future. In order to earn some goodwill, he helps [[Bucky Barnes|Captain America]] escape from custody, asking that he keep this in mind in the future.<ref>''Captain America: Reborn'' #4</ref> Later, when sent with the rest of the team to infiltrate [[Asgard]] and steal [[Gungnir]], he once again faces off with Stature.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #142</ref>

After Scourge finds Gungnir, he attempts to take it to the Iron Patriot, but is stopped by Paladin finally having enough of serving a madman. Grizzly attacks Paladin and attempts to kill for treason but O'Grady shrinks down and enters Grizzly's ear canal, incapacitating Grizzly and saving Paladin's life. As the Mighty Avengers defeat what remains of the Thunderbolts, O'Grady finds Gungnir and gives it to Paladin deciding to take it to a safe place where Iron Patriot cannot find it. After the battle, O'Grady decides to re-evaluate the choices he has made and to do something good with his life.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #144</ref>

===Secret Avengers===
Eric O'Grady is later seen to be a member of the [[Secret Avengers]], using Hank Pym's classic gear.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=25808|title=C2E2: Cup O' Joe|author=Kiel Phegley|date=April 17, 2010|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|accessdate=December 26, 2010}}</ref> He was invited by [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]] believing that O'Grady can be a better person.<ref name="SA1">''Secret Avengers'' #1</ref> He's positioned as the rookie of the team teamed up with [[War Machine]], who believes Eric's not worthy of the Ant-Man name.<ref name="SA2">''Secret Avengers'' #2</ref>

In the arc of the opening four issues, Eric inadvertently stumbled upon a group of [[Shadow Council]] agents planning to blow up his team mates with a bomb,<ref name="SA2"/> but was able to defeat them by detonating it early.<ref name="SA4"/>

===Ant-Man and Wasp===
The story opens to Eric O'Grady riding high off his position with the [[Secret Avengers]] as a tool for sexual encounters with various women. [[Black Fox (comics)|Black Fox]] comes to him with info regarding [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] to hopefully boost Eric's relationship with his own predecessor Hank Pym. When Abigail comes by, Eric admits his longing for a relationship with the intention of starting one, only for Abigail to find evidence of him being unfaithful. She leaves commenting he's improving as a superhero but sucks at being a person. O'Grady goes to Pym's lab, as Hank and [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] discuss how to save their reality from being overwritten. Eric offers to help but is told to wait with his info. Eric waits and talks with [[Tigra]] knowing about his power abuse to peep on women and warns him not to test Tigra. Running into [[Striker (comics)|Striker]], [[Finesse (comics)|Finesse]] and [[Veil (comics)#Avengers Academy|Veil]], Eric talks the ladies into private drinking party, where he passes out and they put shaving cream on his face before leaving him.

After a bizarre break-in, Eric is awaken to find Striker standing over him, who he blames for the shaving cream and starts a fight with him. Tigra saves O'Grady from Striker's powers, just as Pym then finally explains the situation believing Eric brought in an alien who stole from Pym. It's revealed Fox used Eric to create an entrance and exit for a thief to steal an object from Hank's lab, Eric takes responsibility and teams up with Pym to retrieve the stolen object.<ref name="aw1">''Ant-Man and The Wasp'' Vol. 1 #1</ref> They travel together into the mindscape and awaken through an old man's dream. The thief uses dreams to travel and is being manipulated by A.I.M. agent Monica Rappaccini to steal "Heaven" (a virtual reality created to protect Bill Foster's consciousness) and to recruit Hank Pym into A.I.M. Hank spends hours escaping Monica's traps and torture devices, while Eric manipulates Anethesia into helping him save Foster by pretenting to sell out the Avengers. They stall enough for the Avengers to attack the cell and rescue them before Pym causes the enemy ship to teleport to Earth-9939.<ref>''Ant-Man & The Wasp''</ref>

===Death and replacement===
{{split section|date=August 2017}}
On a mission against Father (the creator of the World facility) with the Secret Avengers, Eric is seemingly beaten to death by Father's henchmen while defending a child's life.

He later appears to be alive,<ref>''Secret Avengers'' 23-25</ref> but is revealed to be a Life Model Decoy working for Father and helping him in a yet unknown plan, with the new name of the Black Ant.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' 32</ref> Black Ant is ultimately defeated alongside the other Descendants.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' #37</ref>

As part of the "[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]," Black Ant appears as a member of [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]].<ref>''Illuminati'' #1</ref>

During the ''[[Secret Empire (comic book)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, Black Ant is one of Hydra's Avengers.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
While wearing the Ant-Man armor, Eric O'Grady has the ability to shrink to the size of an [[insect]] while retaining full-sized strength. He also possesses two robotic arms he can release from the back of his armor when he is shrunk. The armor's main mode of transportation is a jetpack that can be detached and used as a weapon by turning the jet's flames onto an enemy. He also has the ability to talk to insects while wearing the suit. However, he has not quite trained in this ability and is somewhat lacking in skill.

After joining The Initiative, it was revealed that O'Grady's armor was the prototype ''G.I. Ant-Man'' suit that could also increase O'Grady's size. During his appearances in ''Avengers: the Initiative'', Eric's helmet seemed to become more of a close-fitting piece of fabric, as it moulded itself to his facial expressions, and could even be peeled upwards to allow him to drink.

Following his induction into the Thunderbolts, Eric's suit is redesigned and recolored, to better fit his new covert operations position.<ref name="Thunderbolts #128"/>

When he joined the Secret Avengers, his costume was redesigned to resemble the original Ant-Man armor.<ref name="SA1"/> It was also fitted with [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]]-like stingers in the gloves.<ref name="SA4">''Secret Avengers'' #4</ref> The armour retains the 'cyberlegs' of the original, not visible when retracted.<ref>''Ant-Man & Wasp'' #2</ref>

==Alternate versions==
===''Punisher vs. the Marvel Universe''===
In a world where a plague turned heroes and villains into cannibals Ant-Man was among the infected. He was later killed by [[the Punisher]] and O'Grady's head was displayed as a hunting trophy.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Eric O'Grady has a [[cameo appearance]] in ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]'', voiced by [[Troy Baker]]. He is seen in the episode "Nightmare in Red" during [[Thunderbolt Ross|Red Hulk]]'s rampage.
