'''Eric O'Grady''', who as of 2006 is the latest [[fictional character|fictional]] [[Marvel Comics]] character known as '''[[Ant-Man]]''', is a [[comic book]] [[antihero]] in the {{Marvel Universe}}. Created by [[Robert Kirkman]] and [[Phil Hester]], he [[first appearance|first appeared]] ''The Irredeemable Ant-Man'' #1 (Sep. 2006).

==Publication history==
Eric O'Grady was the main character in the ongoing monthly series ''The Irredeemable Ant-Man'', with the "Irredeemable" title given to the comic's title to indicate the character's immoral attitude and behavior. The series was cancelled after issue #12, though no official cancellation notice was given (as Marvel Comics simply opted to not solicit issues of ''The Irredeemable Ant-Man'' beyond #12).<ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=118154 Newsarama.com (June 25, 2007): "Kirkman Announces the End of Ant-Man"]</ref>.

Though cancelled, the series ended with Eric O'Grady becoming enrolled in [[Avengers: The Initiative|the Initiative]]. As of Avengers: The Inititative #8, O'Grady has since joined the title's cast.

==Fictional Character Biography==
Eric O'Grady is a low-level agent of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] who stumbles upon Dr. [[Henry Pym|Henry Pym's]] latest incarnation of the [[Ant-Man]] suit in S.H.I.E.L.D.'s headquarters. A man of very few morals and willingness to lie, cheat, steal, and manipulate in order to get ahead in life, Eric imeadiately steals the armor for his own selfish plans, which include using his status as a "super-hero" to stalk and seduce women and humiliate and torment others. 

Mitch Carson, whom O'Grady looks up to, is a S.H.I.E.L.D. security agent under [[Dum Dum Dugan]]. Originally picked out to be the wearer of the Ant Man suit Grady stole, he was forced to wear a hastily built prototype suit based on the armor Grady had stolen. When [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] discovered that O'Grady had stolen the suit, Carson confronted Eric in the new experimental suit. In the ensuing battle, Eric disfigured his mentor's face with his suit's jets, burning the left half of Carson's face and leaving him deaf and blind on that side as well. Despite what he did, O'Grady refused to take any responsibility for his actions and abandoned the injured Mitch, who vowed revenge. 

As his series progressed, it is revealed that O'Grady's best friend and fellow S.H.I.E.L.D. surveillance agent Chris McCarthy, was the first person who actually wore what would become O'Grady's Ant-Man suit. McCarthy was killed however, during his first mission by Hydra agents he was sent to spy upon while wearing the suit, in part due to O'Grady's own negligence providing accurate intel for his best friend.<ref>''The Irredeemable Ant-Man'' #2 (Jan. 2007)</ref> With his best friend dead, Eric sets his sights on seducing and bedding Chris's girlfriend, Veronica King. The attraction resulted in the two having sex, leading to Veronica King's pregnancy and Ant Man ultimately abandoning her.<ref>''The Irredeemable Ant-Man'' #5 (April 2007)</ref>

Despite his attempts to seduce Veronica, Ant Man continuously uses his powers of shrinking to stalk women and watch them in various stages of undress, with Ms. Marvel of the Avengers being a popular target for his ever-increasing voyeurism. 

Eric also encounters the thief [[Black Fox (comics)|Black Fox]], and steals his possessions. [[Black Fox (comics)|Black Fox]] later shows up looking for the jewels. O'Grady, however, had already attempted to sell them to a pawn shop. The two work together, selling the jewels for fifty thousand dollars, and splitting the proceeds, with O'Grady keeping 15 percent.<ref>''The Irredeemable Ant-Man'' #8 (July 2006)</ref> 

After saving the life of a child, Ant-Man encounters [[Damage Control (comics)|Damage Control]].<ref>''The Irredeemable Ant-Man'' #7 (June 2006)</ref> This organization offers him a job and, after he obtains a [[fake ID]] under the name '''Derek Sullivan''' and comes up with a new superhero name ('''Slaying Mantis'''), he consents. He meets a woman named Abigail, who he starts [[dating]] and [[Sexual intercourse|sleeping]] with. Two weeks later, he leases an apartment under his new name and with Damage Control's help begins to establish a new identity while continuing to hide from S.H.I.E.L.D. However, as Abigail begins to fall in love with Eric, she reveals to him that she is a [[Single parent|Single mother]] with a son. This in turn triggers Eric dumping Abigail over her keeping her son's existence a secret from him while pursuing a romantic relationship with him.<ref>''The Irredeemable Ant-Man'' #9 (July 2006)</ref>

During a later confrontation with Abigail, she reveals that she possesses the telepathic power to read people's emotions telepathically. She promptly then accuses Eric of truly loving her, through use of her powers to scan Eric's mind for his true feelings about her. Before he can answer though, the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] attacked Manhattan (See [[World War Hulk]]). Eric reluctantly joins the fray by attacking  the Hulk from the inside of his body.  However, the Hulk's stomach and innards proved to be just as tough and Eric ended up being discharged through one of the nostrils.  He awoke in a SHIELD infirmary, with Mitch Carson standing by his bed, stating that he was under arrest<ref> "The Irredeemable Ant-Man" #10 (August 2007)</ref>

Carson takes Eric to a secret room aboard the [[helicarrier]], and proceeds to torture him, using the Ant-Man suit to internally wound him. Just as Carson is on the verge of burning Eric's face with the suit's jet boosters, [[Iron Man]] arrives and subdues him.  Eric decides to pin the whole stolen-suit fiasco on Carson, saying that he was only trying to stop him from using the suit for evil. Iron Man refuses to believe Eric though Iron Man is quickly sidetracked by the arrival of the Black Fox (who had become friends with Eric after their first encounter). Black Fox demands that Eric be released and claims to have placed explosives on the helicarrier in order to extort his friend's freedom. Eric refutes Fox's claims to protect him from Iron Man, leading to Fox being arrested. 

Several weeks pass and while Carson's fate is left unresolved, it is shown that Eric has resumed his post upon Helicarrier, having been offered his own job under unknown circumstances. <ref> "The Irredeemable Ant-Man" #11 (September 2007)</ref> Feeling guilty for Black Fox being in jail, Eric helps the elderly thief escape from the helicarrier, with Eric admitting that he was sorry for putting Black Fox through the ordeal of being arrested. Meanwhile, despite their misgivings, Iron Man and Hank Pym reluctantly offer Eric his old Ant Man suit back on the condition of him becoming part of the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Initiative]], which Eric accepts. 

Finally Eric refuses Veronica's attempt to try and work out an arrangement for raising their child together, in part because of Eric's inner fear that he would be a horrible father due to his utter lack of morals or ethics. Eric also has one last meeting Abigail and tells her that he does indeed love her. However, he confesses to Abigail the fact that he is a horrible, vile person who is utterly unworthy of a woman like her and that he hopes that through the Initiative program, that he can become a man worthy of woman like Abigail. 

In spite of his vows to Abigail though, Eric continues his lewd and irredeemable ways upon joining the Initiative. In particular, during his first meeting with the [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]], Eric attempts to slander the name of his predecessor, [[Scott Lang]] by passing off stories of his lewd stalker behavior regarding Ms Marvel onto Scott, as well as claiming that Scott Lang was never really an official Avengers and that he was simply hiding inside the Avengers mansion during his tenure with the team and following the group around as a hanger-on. Unfortunately, Scott's daughter [[Stature (comics)|Cassie]] overhears Taskmaster and Eric laughing at Eric's lies and attacks. Eric uses his suit to increase his size to fight the giant-sized version of Cassie, who he tricks into thinking she had stepped on and killed the hero Stingray, in order to knock her down with a cheapshot. This in turn causes Hank Pym to grow giant-sized and attack Eric, who upon defeating Cassie begins to mock her by yelling "Who's Your Daddy Now?". However, as their fight begins to attract the attention of people outside the Initiative compound, the Taskmaster brings the two men down with his shield, just as Hank knocked Eric unconscious.

== Powers and abilities ==
While wearing the Ant-Man [[armor]], O'Grady has the ability to shrink to the size of an [[insect]] while retaining full-sized strength.  He also possesses two robotic arms he can release from the back of his armor when he is shrunk.  The armor's main mode of transportation is a [[jetpack]] that can be detached and used as a weapon by turning the jet's flames onto an enemy. He also has the ability to talk to insects while wearing the suit.  However, he has not quite trained in this ability and is somewhat lacking in skill. It has recently been revealed that the suit can increase Eric's size and strength.
