'''Daimon Hellstrom''', also known as the '''Son of Satan''' and '''Hellstorm''', is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  He first appeared in ''[[Ghost Rider]]'' volume 2 #1, and starred in the short-lived ''Son of Satan'' and ''Hellstorm: Prince of Lies'' series.

Daimon Hellstrom was the son of a [[demon]] which called itself [[Satan]] and a mortal woman named Victoria Wingate.  Daimon and his sister, [[Satana]], were trained by their father in the art of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], tapping into the power granted them by their dark heritage.  When their mother discovered this, she was driven mad, and their father raised them by himself.  However, while Satana embraced her heritage, Daimon clung onto his humanity.  He became a professor of [[anthropology]] at a prestigious university.  He then set himself up as an occult investigator and defender of humanity, battling dark arcane forces - primarily those of his father - under the name of the "Son of Satan".

Eventually, Daimon joined the [[The Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].  He became a member in good standing, eventually marrying his teammate Patsy Walker, alias [[Hellcat (comics)|Hellcat]].  They retired, but Daimon's heritage drove Patsy mad.  She was institutionalized and later committed [[suicide]].

Daimon, now calling himself Hellstorm, ultimately discovered a way to finally defeat his father.  Daimon discovered his father's true name - [[Marduk]] Kurios - and used the power of this knowledge to finally kill him.  Daimon became the new "Satan", ruling over his father's [[Hell]].  He used this power to allow [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] and his [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] to return Patsy from the dead.

More recently, it has been revealed that Daimon was never truly the son of Marduk Kurios.  His true father was the Dread [[Dormammu]], who fathered Daimon as part of a plot to take control of Hell.  Daimon appears to have embraced his heritage and crossed the line from anti-hero to full villain.
