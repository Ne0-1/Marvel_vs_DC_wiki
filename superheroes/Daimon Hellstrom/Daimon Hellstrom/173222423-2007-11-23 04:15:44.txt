'''Daimon Hellstrom''', also known as the '''Son of Satan''' and '''Hellstorm''', is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  He first appeared in ''[[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]]'' vol. 2, <!--W:MOS Volumes, not "series" --> #1 (September 1973), then was featured in the ''[[Marvel Spotlight]]'' series issues #12–24 (October 1973–October 1975) He later starred in the short-lived ''Son of Satan'' and ''Hellstorm: Prince of Lies'' series.

==Fictional character biography==
Daimon Hellstrom was born in the fictional town of Greentown, [[Massachusetts]].  He is the son of a [[Demons (Marvel Comics)|demon]] which called itself "[[Satan]]" and a mortal woman named Victoria Wingate.  Daimon and his sister, [[Satana (Marvel Comics)|Satana]], were trained by their father in the art of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], tapping into the power granted them by their dark heritage. However, while Satana embraced her heritage, Daimon clung to his humanity. When their mother discovered who her husband really was, she was driven mad. Daimon and Satana were separated and put in different homes after his mother was institutionalized and his father vanished back to Hell. Daimon grew up in an orphanage, never hearing a word from his father or sister.  He became a professor of [[anthropology]] at a prestigious university.  He then set himself up as an occult investigator and defender of humanity, battling dark arcane forces—primarily those of his father—under the name of the "Son of Satan".

Eventually, Daimon joined the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].  He became a member in good standing, eventually marrying his teammate Patsy Walker, alias [[Hellcat (comics)|Hellcat]].  

They retired, and Daimon went on a personal quest for meaning.  He traveled to a monastery where the [[Miracle Man]] had taken refuge. When the Miracle Man stole Daimon's "Darksoul", the essence of his evil heritage<ref>''Defenders'' #122</ref>, Daimon discovered that he was human, but he was also dying.  Patsy eventually used a dark book in Daimon's possession to summon "Satan" and pleaded for him to save Daimon's life. However, to do this, Daimon had to regain his Darksoul and once again become the "Son of Satan." Daimon was re-imbued with his essence, but upon witnessing Daimon's "true face" of evil, Patsy went insane. Daimon kept her away from prying eyes in his estate at Fire Lake, where she spent most days asleep or babbling seemingly randomly. She would remain there until one day she regained enough sanity to weep for having brought back such evil into the world, and committed [[suicide]] with the aid of a being known as [[Deathurge]].

Daimon, now calling himself "Hellstorm", ultimately discovered a way to finally defeat his father.  Daimon discovered his father's true name — [[Marduk Kurios]] — and used the power of this knowledge to finally kill him.  Daimon became the new "Satan," ruling over his father's [[Hell]].  He used this power to allow [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] and his [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] to return Patsy from the dead.

In the ''Hellcat'' miniseries, Daimon told his wife that he was never truly the son of Marduk Kurios; his true father was [[Satannish]], who was himself the son of the Dread [[Dormammu]]. Daimon claimed he had been fathered as part of a plot to take control of the various "Hell" dimensions. These claims, however, heavily contradicted Hellstorm's established history. It has since been established that Hellstorm was deliberately lying to Patsy when he made these claims; his love for Patsy led him to push her away in hopes that she would be happier without him.

==2006 series==
In June 2006, Marvel announced that speculative fiction writer [[Alexander Irvine (writer)|Alexander Irvine]] is scheduled to write a new mini-series, starring Hellstrom as a hero in post-[[Hurricane Katrina]] [[New Orleans]].[http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=5&id=37640] This was produced for the [[MAX (comics)|MAX]] imprint, Marvel's mature readers line.[http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=7468] [http://www.newsarama.com/WWPhilly06/Marvel/MondoMvl/Alonso_Hellstorm.html]

===Ultimate Son of Satan===
[[Image:UlitSoS.JPG|right|200px|The Ultimate version of the Son of Satan|thumb|{{deletable image-caption|1=Friday, 30 November 2007}}]]
In the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Marvel universe]], the Son of Satan is a member of that universe's Defenders, all of whom are also lacking in powers except for Giant Man.  He wears a "costume" that is a mix of [[punk rock]] and [[Gothic rock|goth]] elements, including dark facial make-up, bright pink hair, and multiple piercings.  It was revealed in ''[[The Ultimates]]'' ''Annual'' #1 that this Son of Satan is actually a spy (ala [[COINTELPRO]]) for [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], presumably to keep an eye on both [[Giant Man]] and the wannabe heroes and a reserve member of ''Ultimates''.
