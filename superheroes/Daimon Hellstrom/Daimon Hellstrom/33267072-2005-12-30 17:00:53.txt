'''Daimon Hellstrom''', also known as the '''Son of Satan''' and '''Hellstorm''', is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  He first appeared in ''[[Ghost Rider]]'' volume 2 #1, and starred in the short-lived ''Son of Satan'' and ''Hellstorm: Prince of Lies'' series.

Daimon Hellstrom was the son of a [[demon]] which called itself [[Satan]] and a mortal woman named Victoria Wingate.  Daimon and his sister, [[Satana_(comics)|Satana]], were trained by their father in the art of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], tapping into the power granted them by their dark heritage.  When their mother discovered this, she was driven mad, and their father raised them by himself.  However, while Satana embraced her heritage, Daimon clung to his humanity.  He became a professor of [[anthropology]] at a prestigious university.  He then set himself up as an occult investigator and defender of humanity, battling dark arcane forces - primarily those of his father - under the name of the "Son of Satan".

Eventually, Daimon joined the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].  He became a member in good standing, eventually marrying his teammate Patsy Walker, alias [[Hellcat (comics)|Hellcat]].  They retired, but Daimon's heritage drove Patsy mad.  She was institutionalized and later committed [[suicide]].

Daimon, now calling himself Hellstorm, ultimately discovered a way to finally defeat his father.  Daimon discovered his father's true name - [[Marduk]] Kurios - and used the power of this knowledge to finally kill him.  Daimon became the new "Satan", ruling over his father's [[Hell]].  He used this power to allow [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] and his [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] to return Patsy from the dead.

In the ''Hellcat'' miniseries, Daimon told his wife that he was never truly the son of Marduk Kurios: his true father was [[Satannish]], who was himself the son of the Dread [[Dormammu]]. Daimon claimed he had been fathered as part of a plot to take control of the various "Hell" dimensions.  These claims, however, heavily contradicted Hellstrom's established history.  It has since been established that Hellstrom was deliberately lying to Patsy when he made these claims; his love for Patsy led him to push her away in hopes that she would be happier without him.
