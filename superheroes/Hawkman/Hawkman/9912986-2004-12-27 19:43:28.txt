'''Hawkman''' is a [[comic book]] [[superhero]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]].  He is characterized by a costume with large, usually-artificial wings on a harness, and a belt with a special [[metal]] which allows him to [[flight|fly]], and often by his use of archaic weaponry.  The name "Hawkman" has been applied to multiple [[fictional character]]s.

'''Hawkman''' is also the name of several comic book series starring the various men who have used the name.

==Publication history==

Hawkman first appeared in ''[[Flash Comics]]'' #1 ([[1940]]), and was a featured character in that title throughout the 1940s.  This Hawkman was Carter Hall, a reincarnation of an [[ancient Egypt]]ian prince, who had in the modern day discovered that the mysterious "ninth metal" ("ninth" rhymes with "plinth") could negate the effects of [[gravity]] and allow him to fly.  He donned a costume with large wings to allow him to control his flight and became the crimefighter, Hawkman.  An [[archaeology|archaeologist]] by trade, Hall use ancient weapons from the [[museum]] of which he was curator in his efforts.

Hawkman was a charter member of the [[Justice Society of America]], beginning with ''[[All-Star Comics]]'' #3 (Winter 1940), and he became their chairman with #8, a position he would hold for fifty years thereafter.  He was the only member of the JSA to appear in every adventure in ''All-Star Comics'' during the [[Golden Age of comic books]].  He romanced his reincarnated bride, Shiera Saunders, who also became the crimefighter [[Hawkgirl]].  His adventures were memorably drawn by first [[Sheldon Mayer]], and later [[Joe Kubert]].

Along with most other superheroes, Hawkman's Golden Age adventures came to an end when the industry turned away from the genre in the early [[1950s]], his last appearance being in ''All-Star Comics'' #57 ([[1951]]).

Later in the decade, DC Comics under editor [[Julius Schwartz]] decided to revive a number of heroes in new incarnations, but with the same names and powers.  Following the success of [[The Flash]], Hawkman was revived, this time as an [[alien]] [[police]]man from the planet [[Thanagar]], though his powers were largely the same.  Created by [[Gardner Fox]] and [[Joe Kubert]], this Hawkman, Katar Hol, came to Earth with his wife Shayera - Hawkgirl (later Hawkwoman) - in pursuit of a criminal, and remained to fight crime on Earth.  They adopted the named Carter and Shiera Hall and became curators of a museum.

This Hawkman became a member of the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]], where he often verbally sparred with the iconoclastic [[liberal]] hero [[Green Arrow]].  In the [[1960s]] it was revealed that the original Hawkman lived on the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|parallel world]] Earth-Two, and that Katar Hol lived on Earth-One.  The JLA and JSA had an annual meeting throughout the 1960s and [[1970s]] during which the two heroes often met.

The [[Silver Age of comic books|Silver Age]] Hawkman had his own series for a few years, but with declining sales it was merged with that of [[The Atom]].  ''Hawkman and The Atom'' lasted only another year or so before cancellation.

In the late [[1970s]] in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' and ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'', Thanagar went to war with the planet [[Rann]] (adopted home of [[Adam Strange]]).  This led to Hawkman and Hawkgirl severing ties with their homeworld, and later fighting ''[[The Shadow War of Hawkman]]'' (written by [[Tony Isabella]]) as Thanagar tried secretly to conquer the Earth.

Following the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', DC decided to [[reboot]] Hawkman, in a pair of series entitled ''[[Hawkworld]]'', originally by [[Tim Truman]], and later [[John Ostrander]] and [[Grant Miehm]].  In this series, Thanagar was a class society which conquered other worlds to enrich itself.  Katar Hol was the son of a prominent official who rebelled against the status quo.  He and his partner Shayera were sent to Earth and remained there for some years until Hol was apparently killed.

During this time, it was established through [[retcon]]s that the Golden Age Hawkman had also operated during the 1940s, and that ninth metal came from Thanagar.  Moreover, yet another Hawkman - Fel Andar, a Thanagarian agent - had infiltrated the Justice League during the 1980s, pretending to be a hero.

The series ''[[Zero Hour]]'' muddied the waters further by merging the different Hawkmen into a "hawk god", who had his own series briefly during the mid-[[1990s]], and who had a small role in the alternate-future series ''[[Kingdom Come (comic)|Kingdom Come]]''.

In the later 1990s, the series ''JSA'' untangled Hawkman's continuity, establishing him as Carter Hall, a man who - along with Shiera - had been reincarnated dozens of times since his life in ancient Egypt, and whose powers were derived from Thanagarian ninth metal.  The Katar Hol of Hawkworld had also come to Earth during the 1990s, as established.  The 1980s imposter spy went back to Thanagar. The status of the hawk god is unclear.

With this new continuity, Hawkman was again reincarnated and given a new series entitled ''Hawkman'', written by [[James Robinson]] and [[Geoff Johns]], with art by [[Rags Morales]].

==Fictional biographies==

===The Golden Age Hawkman (Carter Hall)===

In the days of [[ancient Egypt]], Prince Khufu was engaged in a feud with his rival Hath-Set.  Hath-Set eventually captured both Khufu and his consort Shiera, and killed them.  Millennia later, in [[1940]], Khufu was reincarnated as [[United States|American]] [[archaeology|archaeologist]] Carter Hall, and Shiera as Shiera Saunders.  Hath-Set himself was reincarnated as a scientist named Hastur.  Hastur turned to evil, while Hall regained his memories of his past life and recognized Hastur.

Using the properties of "ninth metal" to craft a gravity-defying belt, Hall created wings and a costume and confronted Hastur as Hawkman.  He also encountered and remembered Shiera during this time, and following Hastur's defeat the two began a romance.

Hawkman was a charter member of the [[Justice Society of America]], and became their permanent chairman, following [[The Flash]] and [[Green Lantern]].  Shiera, meanwhile, adopted the identity of [[Hawkgirl]] and fought beside Hall throughout the [[1940s]].

Hawkman was JSA chair in [[1951]] when the JSA was investigated by the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] for possible [[Communist]] sympathies and asked to reveal their [[secret identity|identities]]. The JSA declined, and Hawkman and most of the JSA retired for the bulk of the [[1950s]].

(One piece of [[retcon|retroactive continuity]] fills out early Hall history. ''[[All-Star Squadron Annual]]'' #3 states that the JSA fought a being who imbued them with energy which retarded their aging, allowing Hall and many others - as well as their spouses - to remain active into the late [[20th century]] without infirmity.)

The JSA and Hawkman reactivated in the early [[1960s]] following The Flash's meeting with his counterpart on the [[parallel world]] Earth-1, the JSA being active on Earth-2.  Around this time, the Halls, having married, had a son, [[Hector Hall|Hector]], who would later become the [[Silver Scarab]] and after that an incarnation of [[Doctor Fate]].  Little is known of Hawkman's activities during the 1960s, other than the JSA's annual meeting with Earth-1's [[Justice League|Justice League of America]].

In the early [[1980s]], Hawkman was instrumental in denying his son and other JSA children membership in the JSA, leading directly to the formation of [[Infinity Inc.]]

Following the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', some of Hall's history was retconned, when the parallel worlds were combined into one.  It was established that he joined the Justice League shortly after its formation to be a liaison between the two teams.  He remained active until the early [[1990s]], before being killed in the ''[[Zero Hour]]'' crisis.  He was later reincarnated as the Modern Age Hawkman (see below).

===The Silver Age Hawkman (Katar Hol)===

Katar Hol is an honored [[police]] officer on his homeworld of [[Thanagar]]. Along his wife Shayera, they use the antigravity Nth metal and their wings to fight criminals.  These were the tools of an elite police unit tasked to track and apprehend the most dangerous criminals.  The pair were sent to earth in [[1959]] to capture the shape-shifting criminal [[Byth]].  Following this mission, they elected to remain on Earth to work with authorities in the [[United States]] and learn human police methods.  The two adopted covers as a pair of [[museum]] curators, Carter and Shiera Hall, and acted publicly as the heroes Hawkman II and [[Hawkgirl]] II.

Hawkman II joined the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]] in the early [[1960s]], where he befriended [[The Atom]] and frequently sparred with [[Green Arrow]] with whose "question authority" outlook the lawman frequently disagreed.  Like his contemporary heroes, Hawkman II gained a variety of unique villainous opponents, including the [[Shadow Thief]], and the [[Gentleman Ghost]].

Hawkman II left the JLA for a time when Thanagar was hit by the Equalizer Plague, which caused all Thanagarians to change so that their physical and mental talents, and even their heights, became the same.  With the help of the JLA, Hawkman II was eventually able to reverse the effects of the plague.

However, in the wake of the plague, Thanagar adopted an expansionist outlook, and went to war with the planet [[Rann]], which orbits [[Alpha Centauri]].  This forced Hawkman II and Hawkgirl II to choose to fight for or against their own planet, and they elected to oppose Thanagar, becoming exiles on Earth.  Around this time, Hawkgirl II herself joined the JLA, and took the name Hawkwoman.

Following the truce between Thanagar and Rann, Thanagar began to secretly try to take over the Earth.  Hawkman II opposed their efforts in a furtive "secret war" for several years.

Following the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', Hawkman II (and Hawkgirl II/Hawkwoman) was wiped out of DC Comics [[continuity]].

===Hawkworld and the Hawk God===

After the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', Hawkman II was [[reboot]]ed in a series named ''Hawkworld''.  Katar Hol is a young [[police]] officer on the planet [[Thanagar]], and a child of a privileged family.  But Thanagar is a planet which conquers and mines other worlds for their resources to maintain its high standard of living, and Hol realizes that this is wrong.  He rebels against the system, and is sent into exile.  However, he manages to escape and uncover and defeat the renegade police captain [[Byth]], who had gained shape-shifting abilities.  As a result, he is reinstated in the force and given a new partner, Shayera Thal - Hawkwoman - a young woman from a lower class of society.

The two are eventually sent to Earth, where they remain for some time fighting both human and [[alien]] criminals.  The two have a tempestuous working relationship, and eventually Shayera breaks away from Hawkman II, who continues on alone.

This Hawkman was killed in the ''[[Zero Hour]]'', event, merged with a number of alternate Hawkmen into a "hawk god", who adventured for a brief time under the name Hawkman before disappearing.

===The Modern Age Hawkmen (Carter Hall / Fel Andar / Katar Hol)===
[[Image:Hawkman33.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The Modern Age Hawkman and Hawkgirl, from ''Hawkman'' #33, [[December]] [[2004]].  Art by [[Kevin Nowlan]].]]
In the days of [[ancient Egypt]], Prince Khufu and his consort Shayera were travelling in the [[desert]] in the company of the [[wizard]] [[Nabu]] and the hero [[Black Adam|Teth-Adam]], when they came across the wreck of a [[Thanagar]]ian [[space ship]].  The vessel was styled with a hawk-like motif, and powered by [[Nth metal]], a mysterious substance with many marvelous attributes.  Most obviously, it negated [[gravity]], but its energy also strengthened the souls of Khufu and Shayera, binding them together in their love.  Nabu used the Nth metal to create several remarkable devices, which persisted through the ages.

When the pair were murdered by the villainout Hath-Set, their souls lived on and were [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] over many lifetimes, always finding each other and often dying violently together, usually at the hands of the reincarnated Hath-Set.  Finally, in the late [[1930s]], Khufu and Shayera were reborn as Carter Hall and Shiera Saunders, who went on to become the Golden Age Hawkman and Hawkgirl (see above).  The pair retired in the early [[1950s]], but became active again in the early [[1980s]] when Hall briefly joined the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]].  Then the pair retired again.

Late in the [[1980s]] a Thanagarian [[spy]] called Fel Andar arrived in Earth to infiltrate the Justice League as Hawkman II. Then he took on an unwitting earthwoman, Sharon Hall, as his Hawkwoman. This impostor, intending to gain his teammates confidence, claimed to be Carter and Shiera Hall's son Carter Hall, Jr. He was actually working for the future alien-alliance ''Invasion''.
When Hawkwoman learnt about the masquerade she exposed the truth to J'onn J'onzz and Maxwell Lord. Confronted by both, Hawkman II scaped back to Thanagar but not before murdering Hawkwoman for her betrayal.

Soon thereafter, Hawkman III arrived on Earth.  Katar Hol was a [[police]]man from Thanagar, part of a force which used the hawk as their symbol, and also had a winged, gravity-defying harness.  He and his partner Shayera Thal fought crime on Earth as Hawkman III and Hawkwoman II until he was killed in the events of ''[[Zero Hour]]'', which briefly created the "hawk god" creature.

In the late [[1990s]] a new hawk appeared, Hawkgirl II:  This was Kendra Saunders, the great-niece of the original Hawkgirl.  It turned out that Kendra, a troubled youth, had committed [[suicide]] as a teenager.  The wandering soul of Shayera had taken up inhabitance of the body, possessing all of Kendra's memories, and believed herself to be Kendra.

A few years later, in a [[magic (paranormal)|mystical]] ceremony on Thanagar where the Justice Society had travelled to learn the truth of the Thanagarian ship which had crashed in ancient Egypt, Carter Hall was reborn as his youthful self from the 1940s, except with black hair instead of blond.  Following this unorthodox resurrection, Hall has all the memories of his past lives, as well as those of Katar Hol, and find this a great burden to bear.  Moreover, he has had trouble accepting that Kendra is not his beloved Shiera, a source of friction between them despite their working partnership as Hawkman and Hawkgirl II.

Hawkman and Hawkgirl II are both presently members of the Justice Society, and operate out of the fictional southern city of St. Roch (clearly based on [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]).

==Powers & abilities==

All incarnations of Hawkman use a metal (called either "ninth metal" or "Nth metal") to defy [[gravity]] and allow them to [[flight|fly]].  The metal is in their costume's belt, and its abilities are controlled mentally.  Their wings allow them to control their flight, though they can be "flapped" through use of shoulder motions.

The Silver Age Hawkman also had enhanced eyesight comparable (it was said) to a [[hawk]]'s.  He (and, sometimes, the Golden Age Hawkman) was also able to converse with [[bird]]s, though he couldn't command them as [[Aquaman]] could sea creatures.

The Silver Age Hawkman also possessed a Thanagarian police space ship and a variety of [[science fiction]]al weapons.

All versions of Hawkman preferred to use archaic weaponry - particularly [[mace]]s, [[net]]s, [[spear]]s and [[shield]]s - rather than modern or futuristic weapons.  The current incarnation prefers this in part because, having the memories of living through many past lives, he is more proficient in their use than with contemporary weapons.
