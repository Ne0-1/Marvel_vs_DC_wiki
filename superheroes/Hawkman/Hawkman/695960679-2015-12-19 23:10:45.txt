'''Hawkman''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[superhero]] who appears in American [[comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. Created by writer [[Gardner Fox]] and artist [[Dennis Neville]], the original Hawkman first appeared in ''[[Flash Comics]]'' #1, published by [[All-American Publications]] in 1940.

Several incarnations of Hawkman have appeared in DC Comics, all of them characterized by the use of archaic weaponry and by large, artificial wings, attached to a harness made from the special [[Nth metal]] that allows flight. Most incarnations of Hawkman work closely with a partner/romantic interest named [[Hawkgirl]] or [[Hawkwoman]].

Since DC’s [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] was rewritten in the 1985 series ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]],'' Hawkman’s history has become muddled with several new versions of the character appearing throughout the years, some associated with ancient Egypt and some with the fictional planet [[Thanagar]]. These versions of the character have starred in several series of various durations.

==Publication history==
Hawkman first appeared in ''[[Flash Comics]]'' #1 (1940), and was a featured character in that title throughout the 1940s. This Hawkman was Carter Hall, a [[reincarnation]] of the [[ancient Egypt]]ian prince, Khufu. Hall discovered that the mysterious "ninth metal" could negate the effects of [[gravity]] and allow him to fly. He donned a costume with large wings to allow him to control his flight and became the crimefighter, Hawkman. He also had a companion hawk named Big Red that assisted him in fighting crime. An [[archaeology|archaeologist]] by profession, Hall used ancient weapons from the [[museum]] that he curated.

[[File:Flash Comics 71.JPG|left|thumb|left|180px|The Golden Age Hawkman, from ''Flash Comics'' # 71 (May 1946). Art by [[Joe Kubert]].]]
Hawkman was a charter member of the [[Justice Society of America]], beginning with ''[[All Star Comics]]'' #3 (Winter 1940). In issue #8 he became the JSA's chairman, a position he would hold until the end of the JSA's run in ''All Star Comics''. He was the only member of the JSA to appear in every adventure during the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]]. He romanced his reincarnated bride, Shiera Sanders, who became the crimefighter [[Hawkgirl]]. His first three adventures were drawn by creator [[Dennis Neville]] (who modeled Hawkman's costume on the hawkmen characters in the [[Flash Gordon]] comic strip by [[Alex Raymond]]), then by [[Sheldon Moldoff]], and later by [[Joe Kubert]], who slightly redesigned his mask in ''Flash Comics'' # 85 (Jul 1947) and then, one year later, replaced the winged-hawk-like mask with a much simpler yellow cowl in ''Flash Comics'' #98 (Aug 1948).

Along with most other superheroes, Hawkman's Golden Age adventures came to an end when the industry turned away from the genre in the early 1950s. His last appearance was in ''All Star Comics'' #57 (1951).

Later in the decade, DC Comics, under editor [[Julius Schwartz]], decided to revive a number of heroes in new incarnations, but retaining the same names and powers. Following the success of the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]], Hawkman was revived in ''The Brave and the Bold'' # 34 (Feb-Mar 1961), this time as an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[police]]man from the planet [[Thanagar]], though his powers were largely the same. Created by [[Gardner Fox]] and [[Joe Kubert]], this Hawkman, Katar Hol, came to Earth with his wife Shayera in pursuit of a criminal, and remained to fight crime on Earth. They adopted the names Carter and Shiera Hall and became curators of a museum in [[Midway City (DC Comics)|Midway City]].

This Hawkman became a member of the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]], where he often verbally sparred with the iconoclastic [[Liberalism|liberal]] hero [[Green Arrow]]. In the 1960s it was revealed that the original Hawkman lived on the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|parallel world]] of [[Earth-Two]], and that Katar Hol lived on [[Earth-One]]. The JLA and JSA had an annual meeting throughout the 1960s and 1970s during which the two heroes often met.

[[File:Hawkman v1 3.jpg|thumb|left|180px|The Silver Age Hawkman and Hawkgirl, from ''Hawkman'' # 3 (August–September 1964). Art by [[Murphy Anderson]].]]
The [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] Hawkman had his own series for a few years, but with declining sales it was merged with that of the [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]]. ''Atom and Hawkman'' lasted only another year or so before cancellation.

In the late 1970s in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' and ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'', Thanagar went to war with the planet [[Rann]],  the adopted home of [[Adam Strange]]. This led to Hawkman and Hawkwoman severing ties with their homeworld, and later fighting ''The Shadow War of Hawkman'' (written by [[Tony Isabella]]) as Thanagar tried secretly to conquer the Earth.

The landmark 1985 series ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' resulted in a massive revision of much DC continuity and led to many characters being substantially rewritten. Hawkman was to suffer some of the greatest confusion as successive writers sought to explain his various appearances. In the revised timeline there was a single Earth which had witnessed the JSA in the 1940s and the JLA decades later. Successive revisions sought to establish exactly who had been Hawkman and Hawkwoman at different stages. For the first few years the pre-Crisis incarnations were still used, during which time they were prominent across the DC Universe and joined the latest incarnation of the Justice League.

DC decided to [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] Hawkman, in a limited series (which later led to an ongoing series) entitled ''[[Hawkworld]]'' originally by [[Timothy Truman|Tim Truman]], and later [[John Ostrander]]. In this series, Thanagar was a stratified society which conquered other worlds to enrich itself. Katar Hol was the son of a prominent official who rebelled against the status quo. He and his partner Shayera were sent to Earth and remained there for some years until Hol was apparently killed.

This created several continuity errors. Because the new Katar Hol had only just arrived on Earth, someone else had to have been Hawkman previously. In an attempt to resolve the problem it was established through [[retroactive continuity|retcons]] that the Golden Age Hawkman and Hawkgirl had continued to operate sporadically after their supposed retirement in 1951 through the 1990s, and that Nth metal originally came from Thanagar. The Halls, and not the Hols, joined the original incarnation of the JLA. Another Hawkman - Fel Andar, a Thanagarian agent - had been the one who joined the Justice League during the 1980s, pretending to be a hero but secretly spying on the League for his Thanagarian masters.

The ''[[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time|Zero Hour]]'' mini-series muddied the waters further by merging the different Hawkmen into a "Hawkgod", who was the focus character in the third volume of the monthly Hawkman series. This version of Hawkman also had a small role in the alternate-future series ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]''. After the end of this series, Hawkman's [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] was considered by DC to be too complicated,{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} and he was absent from comics for several years.

In the late 1990s, the ''JSA'' series untangled Hawkman's continuity, establishing him as Carter Hall, a man who - along with Shiera - had been reincarnated dozens of times since his life in ancient Egypt, and whose powers were derived from Thanagarian Nth metal, which had been retroactively renamed from "ninth metal". The Katar Hol of the ''Hawkworld'' series had also come to Earth during the 1990s, as previously established. The 1980s Hawkman Fel Andar returned to Thanagar. The Hawkgod was later revealed to be an avatar of the Hawk aspect of the Red (from which [[Animal Man]] receives his powers) and only believed that he was Hawkman.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

During the ''[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]]'' miniseries, it was established that Carter Hall had promoted the [[mindwipe]] of [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Dr. Light]] (he had been the one to initially suggest the idea) and his role in that incident was the basis for his enmity with [[Green Arrow]] (who felt that interfering with an individual's right to self-determination was beyond the moral right of any organization or government).

Subsequently, Hawkman was reincarnated and given a new series in 2002 entitled ''Hawkman'' Volume 4, written initially by [[James Dale Robinson|James Robinson]] and [[Geoff Johns]], with art by [[Rags Morales]]. [[Justin Gray]] and [[Jimmy Palmiotti]] took over writing duties during the third year of the series.  In 2006, the series was retitled ''Hawkgirl'' with issue #50 and given a new creative team [[Walt Simonson]] and [[Howard Chaykin]]. This series was cancelled with issue #66 in July 2007.

Hawkman was a major character in the ''[[Rann-Thanagar War]]'' miniseries, which stemmed from events in ''[[Countdown (comics)|Countdown to Infinite Crisis]]''. During this time his continuity was further changed (See Carter Hall section below).

==Fictional character biographies==

===Carter Hall===
{{Main|Hawkman (Carter Hall)}}

In the days of [[ancient Egypt]], Prince Khufu is engaged in a feud with his rival, the [[Egypt]]ian [[priest]] [[Hath-Set]]. The priest eventually captures both Khufu and his consort Chay-Ara, and kills them using a cursed dagger of Nth metal. Millennia later, in 1940, Khufu is reincarnated as [[United States|American]] [[archaeology|archaeologist]] '''Carter Hall''', Chay-Ara as Shiera Saunders, and Hath-Set as scientist Anton Hastor. After touching the same Nth Metal dagger used to kill Khufu, Carter regains the memories of his former life and realizes Hastor is the reincarnation of his ancient foe. When Hastor kidnaps Shiera, using a magic spell to draw her to his lair, Hall uses his newly-refound memories to craft a gravity-defying belt using Nth metal and a winged costume to become Hawkman. Carter successfully rescues Shiera. Anton is killed by electrocution, and Carter and Saunders begin a romantic relationship.

Carter Hall and Shiera Saunders had a son together, named Hector Hall, who grew up to also have a superheroic identity as Silver Scarab and later adopted the mantle of [[Doctor Fate|Dr. Fate]]. Hector Hall was a member of the superhero groups Infinity Inc. and the JSA where he served alongside his father.

The incarnation of Hawkman that first appeared in the 2011 DC Universe relaunch, [[The New 52]], identifies himself as Carter Hall.{{issue|date=February 2012}}

===Katar Hol===
{{Main|Hawkman (Katar Hol)}}

'''Katar Hol''' is an honored [[police]] officer on his homeworld of [[Thanagar]]. Along with his wife Shayera, they use the anti-gravity ninth (also known as Nth) metal and their wings to fight criminals. These were the tools of an elite police unit tasked to track and apprehend the most dangerous criminals. The pair were sent to earth in 1961 to capture the shape-shifting criminal [[Byth]]. Following this mission, they elected to remain on Earth to work with authorities in the [[United States]] and learn human police methods. The two adopted covers as a pair of [[museum]] curators, Carter and Shiera Hall, and acted publicly as the second Hawkman and the second [[Hawkwoman#Shayera Hol|Hawkgirl]] (later Hawkwoman).

Although initially depicted as surviving the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' intact, Katar Hol was [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]]ed just a few years afterwards in a prestige format [[miniseries]] named ''[[Hawkworld]]'', by [[Timothy Truman]]. A regular ongoing series of the same name followed, with writer [[John Ostrander]] joining Truman. Katar Hol, a young [[police]] officer on the planet [[Thanagar]], rebels against the oppressive system of his planet and is sent into exile. He later escapes and uncovers a renegade police captain [[Byth]]. As a result, he is reinstated into the force, given a new partner, Shayera Thal, and sent on a mission on Earth, where he is the third Hawkman.

In DC's [[The New 52]] universe, it is Katar Hol under the name Carter Hall.

===Fel Andar===
{{Main|Hawkman (Fel Andar)}}

Late in the 1980s, Thanagarian [[spy]] '''Fel Andar''' — who had been living on Earth for some time already — was ordered by the Thanagarian army to infiltrate the Justice League as the second Hawkman.

===Zauriel===
{{Main|Zauriel}}

When [[Grant Morrison]] revived the ''[[JLA (comic book)|JLA]]'' comic book in 1997, he expanded the roster to include over a dozen heroes. With frequent collaborator [[Mark Millar]], he intended to create a new Hawkman with no links to the old characters. This new Hawkman, an Earth-bound angel of the "Eagle host" named '''Zauriel''', was to be introduced into the JLA with issue #6 (June 1997). Morrison was denied permission to use the name "Hawkman" by DC editorial, which still considered it "radioactive", due to the complex post-Crisis continuity problems with the character.

In the ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] JLA Special'', Morrison made an appeal to the fanbase, "It's a good name and it seems a shame to let it go to waste. We're hoping that fans will figure 'For God's sake, let's just call him Hawkman and get him in the Justice League as Hawkman,' and the editors will relent. We're hoping to start a campaign." DC held firm, and the "Hawkman" name went unused for several more years.<ref>[http://www.madwomb.com/madwomb/web/npo/community/archive_grantmorrison2.html ] {{wayback|url=http://www.madwomb.com/madwomb/web/npo/community/archive_grantmorrison2.html |date=20060318151547 }}</ref>

===Charley Parker===
{{Main|Golden Eagle (comics)}}

Originally the [[Teen Titans]] member called '''Golden Eagle''', '''Charley Parker''' was presumed deceased after an attack by the [[Wildebeest (comics)|Wildebeest Society]] during the event known as ''Titans Hunt''. He was later revealed to be alive in the fourth volume of ''Hawkman'' and went on to assist the Carter Hall Hawkman for some time. When Carter Hall seemingly perished, Charley Parker took on the mantle and became the fourth Hawkman, and revealed himself as the son of Carter Hall. In fact, he was actually the son of Fel Andar, and had been responsible for Carter's troubles and his apparent demise. Carter Hall eventually defeated the Golden Eagle, and their vendetta would later be dropped, and Carter Hall reclaimed his mantle.

==Powers and abilities==
All incarnations of Hawkman used the fictional "ninth metal" or "[[Nth metal]]" to defy [[gravity]] and allow them to [[flight|fly]]. The metal is in their costume's belt, boots, and wings. Its abilities are controlled mentally. Their wings allow them to control their flight, though they can be "flapped" through use of shoulder motions. In most comic books he is known to have slightly enhanced physical strength.

[[Golden Age of Comic Books|The Golden Age]] Hawkman was also granted the ability to breathe underwater by the sea god [[Poseidon]].<ref>''Flash Comics'' #9.</ref> He also discovered a hidden kingdom of sentient birds led by the old One-Eye, who taught him their language and later sacrificed himself to save the Hawkman's life.<ref>''Flash Comics'' #23.</ref> Among the leading birds was a hawk named Big Red.<ref>''Flash Comics'' #24.</ref>

[[Silver Age of Comic Books|The Silver Age]] Hawkman also had enhanced senses comparable (it was said) to a [[hawk]]'s. He (and, sometimes, the Golden Age Hawkman) was also able to converse with [[bird]]s, though he couldn't command them in the same way that [[Aquaman]] could command sea creatures. He also wore special contact lenses that allowed him to detect beams and radiation.<ref>"Justice League of America" #32.</ref>

[[Silver Age of Comic Books|The Silver Age]] Hawkman also possessed a Thanagarian police space ship and a variety of [[science fiction]]al weapons.

All versions of Hawkman preferred to use archaic weaponry—particularly [[Mace (club)|maces]], [[Net (device)|net]]s, [[spear]]s, and [[shield]]s—rather than modern or futuristic weapons. The current incarnation prefers this in part because, having the memories of living through many past lives, he is more proficient in their use than with contemporary weapons.  In Katar Hol's case, it was too dangerous to use Thanagarian weaponry since there was too great a chance they could be lost or captured and then used or duplicated on Earth.  There is, however, one significantly unique weapon Carter employs occasionally: the Claw of Horus.  Constructed of Nth metal by Prince Khufu in ancient Egypt, it was delivered to the newly resurrected Carter Hall by the time-displaced [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]] in ''[[Justice Society of America|JSA]]'' Book 3: "The Return of Hawkman".  Later, in ''Superman-Batman'' Book 1: "Public Enemies", Hawkman used it to defeat [[Superman]], using its Nth metal to channel the Earth's gravitational field.  As he explained to Superman, "Essentially, I just hit you with the planet."

All versions of Hawkman have shown enhanced levels of strength. [[Golden Age of Comic Books|The Golden Age]] Hawkman was said to have the strength of 12 men but later that idea was dropped.  Whereas the Golden Age Hawkman's strength appeared natural, it was later explained (with 
[[Silver Age of Comic Books|The Silver Age]] Hawkman) that the Nth metal enables its wielders to carry great weights. The recent incarnation has interpreted this as the Nth metal simply enhancing the strength of the user.  Also, several JLA and JSA stories indicate that Thanagar has greater gravity than Earth, and that Thanagarians are naturally stronger than humans because they are adapted to it, similarly to how Atlanteans (e.g. [[Aquaman]]) are adapted to deep sea pressures.

It has also been explained in the ''JSA'' series that the Nth metal greatly aids in healing, closing wounds almost instantaneously. One example is in the ''JLA'' story "Crisis of Conscience", in issues 115-118. Carter's arm is nearly severed during one part of the issue, but the wound has obviously closed and functionality returned by the end of the issue. The Atom has commented that Hawkman laughs at anything less than third-degree burns.

The Nth metal also regulates the body temperature of the wearer, preventing the need for heavy protective clothing while in high altitudes. It also has the property of radiating heat, which can be controlled to warm the wearer in colder climates.<ref>''Flash Comics'' #18.</ref>

==Other versions==
* During the chronal disruptions of ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]'', multiple versions of Hawkman (and [[Hawkgirl]]/[[Hawkwoman]]) from alternate timelines were appearing in and out of existence. It turns out the Hawks were one of many anomalies in the timestream resulting from the Crisis. Somehow the various versions were converged into the current reality's Katar Hol.
* A Hawkman evolved from [[Just Imagine Stan Lee's Robin|Robin]] in the ''[[Just Imagine...]]'' comic book.<ref>''Just Imagine Stan Lee creating Crisis'' (January 2002)</ref>
* Hawkman's [[Earth-Three#Anti-matter Earth|Antimatter Earth]] counterpart is Blood Eagle. He was killed by the Crime Syndicate.<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = JLA|Issue = 112|Date = (May 2005)|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> It is unclear whether he's a Thanagarian (like Katar Hol) or human (like Carter Hall).

==Awards==
The series and character have won several awards over the years, including:
* [[Alley Award#1961|1961 Alley Award]] for ''Best Adventure Hero/Heroine Not in Own Book''
* [[Alley Award#1962|1962 Alley Award]] for ''Best Hero''
* [[Alley Award#1963|1963 Alley Award]] for ''Cross-Over of DC Heroes'' (''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' with [[Flash (comics)|Flash]])

==In other media==

===Television===

====Animation====
* Hawkman's first animated appearance was in the 1967 [[Filmation]] animated series ''[[The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure]]'', in which Hawkman appears in several shorts, either in solo adventures or as part of the Justice League. The cartoon version resembles the Silver Age hero closely, except he uses a ray blaster "power claw" instead of archaic weapons, he has an eagle sidekick named Skreal instead of [[Hawkgirl]], and he is a scientist instead of a museum director.  Additionally, his spacecraft is bird-shaped.  Hawkman was voiced by [[Vic Perrin]].

* Hawkman has appeared as a Super Friend in ''[[The All-New Super Friends Hour]]'', ''[[Challenge of the Super Friends]]'', ''[[Super Friends (1980)|Super Friends]]'', ''[[Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show]]'', and ''[[The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians]]'' voiced by [[Jack Angel]]. Hawkman appears in almost every episode of ''Challenge of the Super Friends'', but has only spoken lines in thirteen out of the sixteen episodes of this series.

* Hawkman was featured in the ''[[Legends of the Superheroes]]'' TV Specials in 1979, portrayed by Bill Nuckols.

[[File:Hro Talak.jpg|180px|thumb|right|Hro Talak as seen in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''.]]
* In the three-part ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' episode "Starcrossed", a character based loosely on the Silver Age Hawkman called '''[[wikia:dcanimated:Hro Talak|Hro Talak]]''' (an anagram of Katar Hol) is introduced and voiced by Victor Rivers. As the leader of the Thanagarian forces, he had used Hawkgirl as a scout on Earth. Although Hawkgirl believed they were on Earth to establish a defence against the Thangarians' enemies, the [[List of alien races in DC Comics#G|Gordanians]], Talak's true plan is to destroy Earth as part of the establishment of a hyperspace bypass that would allow the Thanagarians to reach the Gordanian home system and destroy them. After the Justice League defeat them, the Thanagarian forces leave Earth to fight the Gordanians, concluding that remaining on Earth to start again would be too difficult. He did not use the name Hawkman.

* In the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "Hunter's Moon", it is revealed that the remainder of the Thanagarian army was attacked by the Gordanians and Hro Talak sacrificed his life to destroy one of their ships leaving those that were with Hro to flee to another planet where they plot revenge against Hawkgirl when she lands in their trap with [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]] and [[Vigilante (comics)|Vigilante]]. In Season 3, an actual Hawkman appears who is an amalgamation of the Golden Age and Silver Age Hawkman (voiced by [[James Remar]]). He first appears in the episode "Shadow of the Hawk" in the form of Carter Hall (whose birthname is '''Joseph Gardner'''), an archaeologist who takes a liking to Shayera. He had previously discovered Thanagarian technology in an Egyptian tomb, and after exposure to a memory-recording device called an Absorbacron, comes to believe that he and Shayera are the reincarnations of two Thanagarian lovers, named Katar Hol and Shayera Hol, who had crashed in ancient Egypt. Adopting the name of Hawkman, Hall leads her to the tomb (with [[Batman]] secretly following) and reveals his superhero identity. When the villainous [[Shadow Thief]] attacks, the tomb collapses, after which Shadow Thief escapes, and Hawkman departs, still believing that he and Shayera are meant for each other. It is not stated definitively, however, that Hall is actually speaking the truth - it is suggested that he is delusional, and that his mind may have been addled by his exposure to the Absorbacron. However, it is also shown that deep in the tomb is a dual-occupancy mummy case with two winged mummies resting hand in hand, so the viewer is left to make their own judgement.  In the episode "Ancient History" it is revealed that the Shadow Thief is an independent fragment of Hall's addled psyche and that the reincarnation theory is likely true.  In the series finale, "Destroyer", he is seen along with other heroes responding to the League alert concerning [[Darkseid]]'s invasion of Earth. [[Batman]] says that Hall's real name is "Joseph Gardner", which is a nod to Hawkman's most notable creators, [[Joe Kubert]] and [[Gardner Fox]].

A slightly out-of-shape Hawkman is shown struggling to lift criminals off the ground and flying straight into a glass window. Eating a Baby Ruth candy bar, he says, gives him the energy he needs.
