'''Alicia Masters''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[supporting character]] of the [[Fantastic Four]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], who has served as a romantic interest and a frequent [[damsel in distress]].  Alicia Masters was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], and first appeared in ''Fantastic Four'' #8, November, 1962.

Masters was permanently blind, due to an explosion of radioactive clay accidentally caused by her step-father, the [[supervillain]] known as the [[Puppet Master (comics)|Puppet Master]], during his fight with a rival.  She became the girlfriend of Fantastic Four member Ben Grimm, AKA [[thing (comics)|the Thing]], naturally being the only person who could "see" him for who he was without being repelled by his monstrous appearance.  Masters is also an accomplished and famous sculptor who can create perfect representations by touch and memory alone.

Masters played an integral role in one of the cornerstone stories of the [[Marvel Universe]], in ''Fantastic Four'' (1961 series) #48-50.  When the [[Silver Surfer]] first came to Earth as a herald to the world-destroying [[Galactus]], he crashed into Masters' apartment after fighting the Fantastic Four.  Her gentle pleading with him convinced him to reject his master and defend Earth, and the Surfer has been a steadfast hero ever since.

After the Thing had chosen to remain on an alien planet where he could change back to human form, Masters and the [[Human Torch (Johnny Storm)|Human Torch]] fell in love, and the Thing returned in time to unhappily attend their wedding.  However, in a [[retcon|retroactive]] rewrite of the story years later that angered many fans, it was revealed that the "Alicia Masters" the Torch married was actually a female member of the shapeshifting [[Skrull]]s named [[Lyja]], who had abducted and replaced Masters to serve as a spy.  After the ruse was discovered, the real Alicia Masters was rescued from [[suspended animation]] by the Fantastic Four, unaware that any time had passed.

She subsequently became romantically involved with the Silver Surfer and eventually left earth with him, travelling through outer space at his side in an armored suit that allows her to see energy signatures and take a more active role than she was previously capable of.

Her character in adaptations into other media has remained true to her classic role as the Thing's girlfriend.  Alicia Masters was a regular character in the 1994-96 Fantastic Four animated television series that aired as half of the ''Marvel Action Hour'', with her voice performed by [[Pauline Arthur Lomas]].  In the infamous [[Fantastic Four (1994 movie)|1994  live-action film adaptation]], Masters was played by [[Kat Green]].  Masters was most recently played by [[Kerry Washington]] in the 2005 live-action ''[[Fantastic Four (2005 movie)|Fantastic Four]]'' film.
