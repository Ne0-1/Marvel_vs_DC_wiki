'''Alicia Reiss Masters''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], she first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|The Fantastic Four]]'' #8 (Nov 1962).

She has also helped explain human life and emotion to the alien Silver Surfer. Actress [[Kat Green]] played her in the unreleased ''[[The Fantastic Four (unreleased film)|The Fantastic Four]]'' film from 1994, and then [[Kerry Washington]] portrayed her in the 2005 film ''[[Fantastic Four (2005 film)|Fantastic Four]]'' and the 2007 sequel ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]''.

==Fictional character biography==
Alicia is introduced in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'' #8, along with her stepfather, the [[supervillain]] known as the [[Puppet Master (Marvel Comics)|Puppet Master]]. She initially aids him out of obedience in his first scheme against the Fantastic Four, though she immediately senses the "gentle" and "sensitive" spirit of the Thing when she first feels his palpably monstrous face.  Alicia turns on her stepfather when she realizes that he is mad and power-hungry, and accidentally causes him to fall to his apparent death out of a window. A subsequently published story explains that the Puppet Master had been responsible for her permanent blindness, which was caused by an explosion of radioactive clay during his fight with a rival.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' Vol. 1 #6 (January 1973)</ref>

Alicia Masters was a recurring character in early issues of ''Fantastic Four'' as the love interest of the Thing, serving as a plot device to cause him to resist changing back to a normal human form, for fear that Alicia would not love him as "plain Ben Grimm."<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #25 (April 1964), p.2. Marvel Comics.</ref> The physically vulnerable Masters was also frequently used as a [[damsel in distress]].

The character plays an integral role in one of the most acclaimed comic book stories of the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]], "The Coming of [[Galactus]]," in ''Fantastic Four'' #48–50 (March – May 1966). In that story arc, the [[Silver Surfer]] first comes to Earth as a herald to the powerful, world-destroying being Galactus, and crashes into Alicia's apartment after fighting the Fantastic Four. Her passionate pleading with him about the value of life convinces him to reject his master and defend the Earth from destruction.<ref>{{cite web |first=Brian |last=Cronin |url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/02/19/a-year-of-cool-comics-day-50/ |title=A Year of Cool Comics – Day 50 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] CSBG Archive |date=February 19, 2010|accessdate=September 29, 2010 }}</ref>

After the Thing chooses to remain on an alien planet where he could change back to human form, Alicia falls in love with the dashing [[Human Torch (Johnny Storm)|Human Torch]], another member of the Fantastic Four. The Thing returns to unhappily attend their wedding.<ref>"Dearly Beloved," by [[Roger Stern]], [[John Buscema]], and [[Sal Buscema]]. ''Fantastic Four'' #300 (March 1987).

These three villains planned to attack the wedding, but at the last moment Puppet Master stopped them, with the (unwilling) help of Dragon Man.

After several months, the Fantastic Four discovers that Alicia was kidnapped and replaced by Lyja, a Skrull espionage agent sent to infiltrate the Fantastic Four and set them up for her handler, Paibok the Power Skrull, to destroy them. The Fantastic Four defeats Paibok and retrieves Alicia. She was taken before Ben broke up with her, and her feelings for Ben never changed. This makes things difficult for both him and Johnny. The two of them had months to resolve things between them. Now Johnny has to come to grips with the fact that the real Alicia never loved him and that Lyja is the woman he loves. Ben has to deal with having gotten over Alicia, only to have her back and in love with him.

With her relationships with Ben and Johnny now complicated by Johnny's marriage to 'Lyja' and Ben's prior attempts to resolve his old feelings for her after Lyja's marriage, Alicia subsequently becomes romantically involved with the Silver Surfer and eventually leaves Earth with him, traveling through outer space at his side in an armored suit.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol 3 #121-140 (w)J M DeMatthis (a)various</ref><ref>''Galactus the Devourer'' #1-6</ref>
