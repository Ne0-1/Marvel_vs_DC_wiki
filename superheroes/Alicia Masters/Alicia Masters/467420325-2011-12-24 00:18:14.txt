'''Alicia Reiss Masters''' is a [[supporting character]] to the [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]]es the [[Fantastic Four]] and [[Silver Surfer]]. Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], she first appeared in ''The Fantastic Four'' #8 (Nov 1962).

Alicia is a [[blindness|blind]] [[sculpture|sculptress]] who is able to create incredibly lifelike representations of real people by touch and memory alone; her sculptures of the Fantastic Four and other superheroes are frequently depicted.<ref name="mnyc">{{cite book  | last = Sanderson  | first = Peter  | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City  | publisher = [[Pocket Books]]  | year = 2007  | location = New York City  | url =   | doi =   | id =   | isbn = 1-14653-141-6  | page = 11}}</ref>  A caring, sensitive character, she has been a romantic interest and confidant of [[Thing (comics)|The Thing]], a member of the Fantastic Four who is frequently ashamed of his monstrous appearance. She has also helped explain human life and emotion to the alien Silver Surfer. Actress [[Kerry Washington]] portrays  her in the 2005 film ''[[Fantastic Four (film)|Fantastic Four]]'', and the 2007 sequel ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]''.

==Fictional character biography==
Alicia is introduced in ''The Fantastic Four'' #8, along with her stepfather, the [[supervillain]] known as the [[Puppet Master (comics)|Puppet Master]]. She initially aids him out of obedience in his first scheme against the Fantastic Four, though she immediately senses the "gentle" and "sensitive" spirit of the Thing when she first feels his palpably monstrous face.  Alicia turns on her stepfather when she realizes that he is mad and power-hungry, and accidentally causes him to fall to his apparent death out of a window. A subsequently published story explains that the Puppet Master had been responsible for her permanent blindness, which was caused by an explosion of radioactive clay during his fight with a rival.

[[Image:FF 49 panel.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Alicia Masters pleads with the [[Silver Surfer]] for the survival of humanity in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #49 (Apr, 1966). Art by [[Jack Kirby]].]]Alicia Masters was a recurring character in early issues of ''Fantastic Four'' as the love interest of the Thing, serving as a plot device to cause him to resist changing back to a normal human form, for fear that Alicia would not love him as "plain Ben Grimm."<ref>See ''Fantastic Four'' #25 (Apr, 1964), page 2.</ref>  The physically vulnerable Masters was also frequently used as a [[damsel in distress]].

The character plays an integral role in one of the most acclaimed comic book stories of the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]], "The Coming of [[Galactus]]," in ''Fantastic Four'' #48-50 (Mar - May, 1966). In that story arc, the [[Silver Surfer]] first comes to Earth as a herald to the powerful, world-destroying being [[Galactus]], and crashes into Alicia's apartment after fighting the Fantastic Four. Her passionate pleading with him about the value of life convinces him to reject his master and defend the Earth from destruction.<ref>{{Cite web |first=Brian |last=Cronin |url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/02/19/a-year-of-cool-comics-day-50/ |title=A Year of Cool Comics â€“ Day 50 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] CSBG Archive |date=February 19, 2010|accessdate=September 29, 2010 }}</ref>

After the Thing chooses to remain on an alien planet where he could change back to human form, Alicia falls in love with the dashing [[Human Torch (Johnny Storm)|Human Torch]], another member of the Fantastic Four. The Thing returns to unhappily attend their wedding.<ref>"Dearly Beloved," by [[Roger Stern]], [[John Buscema]], and [[Sal Buscema]]. ''Fantastic Four'' #300 (March 1987).</ref>

However, a [[retcon|retroactive]] rewrite of the story published years later depicts the "Alicia Masters" that the Torch married was actually [[Lyja]], a female member of the [[shapeshifting]] alien race the [[Skrull]]s, who had abducted and replaced Masters to serve as a spy. After the ruse is discovered, the real Alicia Masters is rescued from [[suspended animation]] by the Fantastic Four, unaware that any time had passed. 

She subsequently becomes romantically involved with the Silver Surfer and eventually leaves Earth with him, traveling through outer space at his side in an armored suit that allows her to see energy signatures and take a more active role than she was previously capable of. Alicia later returns to Ben, but their reunion was short-lived due to the manipulations of the Puppet Master, and, with both having felt they'd moved on, they resolve to stay friends.

Alicia is frequently trusted as a babysitter for [[Franklin Richards]], the son of Invisible Woman and Mr. Fantastic. During the year long period in which the FF were missing ("[[Heroes Reborn]]") Alicia is seen as his primary caretaker ("[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]" #2).

In the pages of ''[[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]'' the Silver Surfer briefly re-unites with Alicia, wishing she would accompany him once more. 

After their breakup, Ben's newfound discovery of his vast fortune leads him to mingle with the rich, including a brief relationship with a starlet named Carlotta. At the end of his most recent solo series, Ben and Alicia are shown to be back together once again.

Alicia designed the memorial to [[Captain America]].<ref>See ''Fallen Son: The Death of Captain America'' #5 (July, 2007), page 3.</ref>

Following the events of the [[Secret Invasion]], Alicia is made part of a support group for people replaced by the Skrulls, as she has firsthand knowledge of what it is like being replaced and then returned after a long period of time.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #20</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
[[Image:FF cartoon-Alicia Masters and Silver Surfer.jpg|thumb|185px|Alicia Masters and the Silver Surfer in the ''Marvel Action Hour'' episode, "The Silver Surfer & the Coming of Galactus".]]

* Alicia made her animated debut in The 1982 Incredible Hulk cartoon. She appears in the episode ''Bruce Banner: Unmasked'' where her Stepfather gets control of the residents in Metro City, as well as The Hulk. She's the only person he doesn't make a puppet of. 

* Alicia Masters was a regular character in the 1994-1996 ''[[Fantastic Four (1994 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]'' cartoon voiced by [[Pauline Arthur Lomas]]. 

* In ''[[Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes]]'', Alicia is portrayed as an African-American woman and voiced by [[Sunita Prasad]], keeping some level of visual continuity with the feature film.

* Alicia Masters appears in ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]'' episode "Blind Rage Knows No Color" voiced by [[Tara Strong]].

===Film===
In the unreleased 1994 film ''[[The Fantastic Four (film)|The Fantastic Four]]'', Masters was played by [[Kat Green]]. 

She also appeared in the 2005 film ''[[Fantastic Four (film)|Fantastic Four]]'', where she was played by [[Kerry Washington]] and was once again the love interest of the Thing after Ben's fiancee left him because she couldn't cope with his new appearance. In a scene in Alicia's studio, Ben notes a number of puppets on the wall, which she says belong to her "[[Puppet Master (comics)|stepfather]]". Washington reprised the role in the 2007 sequel, ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]'', which gives the character a larger role than in the previous film.  In contrast with Alicia's important role in the story of the [[Silver Surfer]] in ''Fantastic Four'' #49, the two characters do not interact in the film (In ''Rise of the Silver Surfer'', it is [[Invisible Woman|Susan Storm]] who successfully convinces the Surfer to rebel against [[Galactus]]).

Alicia is depicted as African-American in the 2005 & 2007 films, instead of her Caucasian appearance in the comics.

===Video games===
She also appeared in the game based on the movie (played by [[Cree Summer]]), where the Thing and Mr. Fantastic must rescue her from the [[Mole Man]]'s minions. In a later level, her father, the Puppet Master, brings the Egyptian and Prehistoric exhibits to life to attack the Fantastic Four, as he feels that association with the Thing will be dangerous for Alicia.
