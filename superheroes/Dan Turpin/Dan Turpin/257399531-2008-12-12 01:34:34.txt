==Publication history==

==Fictional character biography==
Lieutenant Inspector Dan Turpin is a member of the [[Metropolis (comics)#Metropolis Police Department|Metropolis Special Crimes Unit]]. In the third  ''[[Superboy]]'' series, Dan Turpin is sent to [[Hawaii]] to investigate whether or not they needed a Special Crimes Unit of their own. While initially skeptical, a visit from the violent [[Darkseid]] faction, the [[Female Furies]] convinces Dan that the islands need an SCU.<ref>As seen in ''Superboy'' vol. 3 #20 (October 1995)</ref> In current ''[[Superman]]'' titles, Turpin is extremely loyal to [[Maggie Sawyer|Inspector Sawyer]], before her transfer to [[Gotham City]]. His romantic feelings for her fall apart when he learns she is a [[lesbian]]. Turpin has a wife named Maisie.

===Current status===
Dan Turpin returns in ''[[Final Crisis]]'' #1 (May 2008). He had been called back from retirement to investigate the case of several missing kids; this evolves into investigating the death of the [[New Gods|New God]] [[Orion (comics)|Orion]]. Orion passes on several cryptic phrases to Turpin before finally passing away. 

In the second issue, he follows clues given to him by [[Renee Montoya]] and [[The Mad Hatter]], investigating [[The Dark Side Club]] and journeying to the devastated city of [[Bl√ºdhaven]].  There he meets up with [[Glorious Godfrey|reverend Good]], and begins to realize that "there's [[Darkseid|someone in my head.]]"

In the fourth issue, Turpin, after much inner struggle, is turned into the new host body for Darkseid.

In the ''[[Final Crisis]]'' sketchbook, Turpin is described as "Kirby drawn by [[Frank Miller (comics)|F. Miller]]".

==Other media==
In the 1990s [[cartoon]] ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', Turpin was modeled on Kirby, and voiced by [[Joseph Bologna]].  He appears often in the early part of the series.  Initially he is highly critical of Superman, until he saves Superman's life in the episode ''Tools of the Trade''.  His final appearance is in the two part episode ''[[List_of_Superman:_The_Animated_Series_episodes#Season_Four|Apokolips...Now!]]''. [[Darkseid]]'s forces had suffered various defeats in their attack against [[Earth]]. Darkseid vaporizes Turpin in a last parting insult to Superman. Turpin's funeral was presided over by a [[rabbi]]. The prayer he uses is called a [[Kaddish]]. It was out of respect for the legacy of the character that producer [[Bruce Timm]] found a genuine religious leader for the [[voiceover]]. He also modeled the [[cemetery]] after the real-life one where Jack Kirby is buried. Daniel Turpin's grave (with an inscription naming him as "Earth's Greatest Hero") lies on a sunny hillside on the outskirts of Metropolis, visited by his friends in life and watched over by long-time ally Superman, a [[homage]] to the brighter [[Silver Age]], and dedicated to the memory of Jack Kirby. As the funeral was breaking up Superman offered up a small tribute to his departed friend, saying, "In the end, the world didn't really need a Superman... just a brave one." In the final episode of the show, Superman mentions him several times, and even dedicates one of the blows he delivers to Darkseid to the memory of Dan Turpin.

Inspector Turpin also appears in the [[GraphicAudio|Graphic Audio]] production of Superman: The Never Ending Battle. In it, Turpin acts as a decoy to help Superman catch an assassin, and then the two share a friendly conversation about how Superman doesn't look good in hats before a sudden wind picks up, foreshadowing the main threat of the story.

He will make an appearance in season 8 of the show [[Smallville]].[http://www.kryptonsite.com/smallvillespoilers.htm]
