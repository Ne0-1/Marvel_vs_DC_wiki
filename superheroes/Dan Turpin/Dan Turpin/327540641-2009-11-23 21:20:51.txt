'''Daniel "Terrible" Turpin''' is a [[fictional character]] published by [[DC Comics]]. Turpin was created by [[Jack Kirby]], he first appeared as Brooklyn (due to him being born in [[New York]]) in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #64 (June 1942), and first appeared as Dan Turpin in ''[[New Gods]]'' #5 (November 1971).

==Publication history==
Due to a recent [[retcon]], Dan Turpin was made the adult version of [[Jack Kirby]]'s [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] "kid-gang" character Brooklyn, of the [[Boy Commandos]].{{Fact|date=May 2008}}

==Fictional character biography==
Lieutenant Inspector Dan Turpin is a member of the [[Metropolis (comics)#Metropolis Police Department|Metropolis Special Crimes Unit]]. In the third  ''[[Superboy]]'' series, Dan Turpin is sent to [[Hawaii]] to investigate whether or not they needed a Special Crimes Unit of their own. While initially skeptical, a visit from the violent [[Darkseid]] faction, the [[Female Furies]] convinces Dan that the islands need an SCU.<ref>As seen in ''Superboy'' vol. 3 #20 (October 1995)</ref> In current ''[[Superman]]'' titles, Turpin is extremely loyal to [[Maggie Sawyer|Inspector Sawyer]], before her transfer to [[Gotham City]]. His romantic feelings for her fall apart when he learns she is a [[lesbian]]. Turpin has a daughter named Maisie.

===Current status===
Dan Turpin returns in ''[[Final Crisis]]'' #1 (May 2008). He had been called back from retirement to investigate the case of several missing kids; this evolves into investigating the death of the [[New Gods|New God]] [[Orion (comics)|Orion]]. Orion passes on several cryptic phrases to Turpin, telling him that "He is in you all!" before finally passing away. 

In the second issue, he follows clues given to him by [[Renee Montoya]] and [[Mad Hatter (comics)|The Mad Hatter]], investigating [[The Dark Side Club]] and journeying to the devastated city of [[Bl√ºdhaven]].  There he meets up with [[Glorious Godfrey|Reverend Good]], and begins to realize that "there's [[Darkseid|someone in my head.]]"

In the fourth issue, Turpin, after much inner struggle, is turned into the new host body for Darkseid.

In the sixth issue, [[Batman]] uses a gun loaded with a Radion bullet, which is poisonous to the New Gods, to shoot Darkseid in the shoulder. After Darkseid is claimed by the Black Racer, Turpin appears to regain control of his body, breathing "In us... in all of us..." in apparent recognition of the meaning of Orion's last words. However, Superman later addresses the body as though Darkseid was still in control of it, and Turpin then vanishes, meaning it remains unclear what exactly the fate of Turpin is.

==Other media==
===Television===
* In the 1990s [[cartoon]] ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', Turpin was modeled on Kirby and voiced by [[Joseph Bologna]]. He appears often in the early part of the series. Initially he is highly critical of Superman because of his interference in the MPD's work, which (in his opinion) questioned his abilities as a police officer. In the episode ''Tools of the Trade'', however, he and Superman end up saving each other's lives, whereupon Turpin becomes more appreciative of the Man of Steel.<br>Turpin's final appearance is in the two part episode ''Apokolips...Now!'', where he leads the police of Metropolis against Darkseid's invasion force and stands up against Darkseid himself even after the alien despot presents Superman in defeat. After being forced to retreat his forces from their attack against [[Earth]] by [[New Genesis]], Darkseid vaporizes Turpin in revenge for his defiance and as a last parting insult to Superman.<br>Turpin's funeral was presided over by a [[rabbi]]. The prayer he uses is called a [[Kaddish]]. It was out of respect for the legacy of the character that producer [[Bruce Timm]] found a genuine religious leader for the [[voiceover]]. He also modeled the [[cemetery]] after the real-life one where Jack Kirby is buried. Daniel Turpin's gravestone bears the inscription "Earth's Greatest Hero" as a reference to the him leading the MPD against Darkseid. His grave is located on a sunny hillside on the outskirts of Metropolis, visited by his friends in life and watched over by long-time ally Superman, a [[homage]] to the brighter [[Silver Age]], and dedicated to the memory of Jack Kirby. As the funeral was breaking up, Superman offered up a small tribute to his departed friend, saying, "In the end, the world didn't really need a super man... just a brave one". In the final episode of the show, Superman mentions him several times, and even dedicates one of the blows he delivers to Darkseid to the memory of Dan Turpin. Darkseid merely says simply," Had I known one death would have caused you so much grief, I would have taken more." 

* Inspector Turpin also appears in the [[GraphicAudio|Graphic Audio]] production of ''Superman: The Never Ending Battle''. In it, Turpin acts as a decoy to help Superman catch an assassin, and then the two share a friendly conversation about how Superman doesn't look good in hats before a sudden wind picks up, foreshadowing the main threat of the story.

* In "Bulletproof", a season 8 episode of ''[[Smallville (TV Series)]]'', Danny Turpin, portrayed by [[David Paetkau]],  is a street cop who is partnered with an undercover Clark Kent. [http://www.kryptonsite.com/smallvillespoilers.htm]  Like the ''Smallville'' version of Maggie Sawyer, this Dan Turpin appears to be early in his police career.
