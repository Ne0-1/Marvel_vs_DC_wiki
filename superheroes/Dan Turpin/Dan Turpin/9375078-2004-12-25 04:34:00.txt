'''Dan Turpin''' is a fictional character from ''[[DC Comics]]''. He is a police inspector in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]. 

He was created by [[Jack Kirby]] and first appeared in ''[[New Gods]]'' #5 in 1971, when he was encountered by [[Orion (comics)|Orion]]. He was a tough, no-nonsense cop nicknamed "Terrible" Turpin.

In current ''[[Superman]]'' titles, Inspector Turpin is a member of the Metropolis Special Crimes Unit. He was extremely loyal to [[Maggie Sawyer|Inspector Sawyer]], before her transfer to [[Gotham City]], and was romantically interested in her before learning she was a lesbian.

Possibly inspired by his attitude, and the fact he always wears a derby hat, later writers have revealed him to be the adult version of Kirby's [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] "kid-gang" character Brooklyn, of the [[Boy Commandos]].

In ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', Turpin was modelled on Kirby, and voiced by [[Joseph Bologna]]. In the series, he was killed by [[Darkseid]]'s forces.
