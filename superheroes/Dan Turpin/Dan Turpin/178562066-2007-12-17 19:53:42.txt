==Fictional Character Biography==
It has been retconned that Turpin is the adult version of Kirby's [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] "kid-gang" character Brooklyn, of the [[Boy Commandos]].

In the ''[[Superboy]]'' comics, Turpin is sent to Hawaii to investigate whether or not they needed a Special Crimes Unit of their own. While initially skeptical, a visit from the violent [[Darkseid]] faction, the [[Female Furies]] convinces Dan that the islands need an SCU. 

In current ''[[Superman]]'' titles, Inspector Turpin is a member of the Metropolis Special Crimes Unit. He is extremely loyal to [[Maggie Sawyer|Inspector Sawyer]], before her transfer to [[Gotham City]]. His romantic feelings for her fell apart when he learns she is a [[lesbian]].

==Other Media==
In the [[1990s]] [[cartoon]] ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', Turpin was modeled on Kirby, and voiced by [[Joseph Bologna]]. In the series, he is featured in the two part episode ''Apokolips...Now!''. Darkseid's forces had suffered various defeats in their attack against Earth. Darkseid vaporizes Turpin in a last parting insult to Superman.

Turpin's funeral was presided over by a rabbi. The prayer he uses is called a [[Kaddish]]. It was out of respect for the legacy of the character that producer [[Bruce Timm]] found a genuine religious leader for the voiceover. He also modeled the cemetery after the real-life one where Jack Kirby is buried.

Daniel Turpin's grave (with an inscription naming him as "Earth's Greatest Hero") lies on a sunny hillside on the outskirts of Metropolis, visited by his friends in life and watched over by long-time ally Superman, a homage to the brighter [[Silver Age]], and dedicated to the memory of Jack Kirby.

As the funeral was breaking up Superman offered up a small tribute to his departed friend, saying, "In the end, the world didn't really need a Superman... just a brave one."
