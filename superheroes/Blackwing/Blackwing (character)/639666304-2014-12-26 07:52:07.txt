Joseph Manfredi was born in [[Orlando, Florida]], and is the son of the crime lord [[Silvermane]].

While as a member of that group, he battled with [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] and escaped.<ref>''Daredevil'' #118</ref>

Blackwing worked as an agent for Silvermane's [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] (serving as the Air Action Division Leader) when his father was leader. He participated in the capture of [[Foggy Nelson]]. Blackwing battled Daredevil, [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]], [[Nick Fury]], and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and was once again defeated by Daredevil.<ref>''Daredevil'' #122-123</ref>

Blackwing later teamed up with [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)#Steven Levins|Jack O'Lantern]] to stake out his father's house when the [[Red Skull]] took the control of the base, turning the dilapidated mansion into his so-called Skull House. The duo searched Skullhouse and battled [[Captain America]] during this event.<ref>''Captain America'' #396-397</ref> Blackwing and Jack O'Lantern were recruited by [[Mother Night (comics)|Mother Night]] to join the [[Skeleton Crew (comics)|Skeleton Crew]] after the Red Skull was impressed with their abilities.<ref>''Captain America'' #398</ref> Blackwing, Jack O'Lantern, and [[Cutthroat (comics)|Cutthroat]] fought [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]] and [[Diamondback (comics)|Diamondback]] before they joined the Skeleton Crew.

He was defeated in combat by Falcon, and taken to the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]].<ref>''Captain America'' #410</ref>

The second [[Crimson Cowl (Justine Hammer)|Crimson Cowl]] recruited Blackwing to join her incarnation of the [[Masters of Evil]]. He was defeated alongside them. After that last defeat, Joseph abandoned the Blackwing identity and became a crime lord creating his own private villains in [[Heavy Mettle]]. He ordered [[Firestrike]] to bring him the battle suit of [[New Warriors]] member [[Turbo (comics)|Turbo]] in hopes of proving himself to his father and the other crime bosses of New York.<ref name="NW3-4">''New Warriors'' vol. 2 #3-4</ref> The New Warriors defeated Joseph's group and Firestrike is currently in the Witness Protection Program in exchange for his testimony against Joseph Manfredi.<ref>''New Warriors'' vol. 2 #6-7</ref>
