'''Blackwing''' is the name of a [[Marvel Comics]] supervillain.

==History==
Joseph Manfredi is the son of the crimelord [[Silvermane (comics)|Silvermane]]. When he debuted, he was a costumed animal trainer for the [[Ringmaster (comics)|Ringmaster]]'s [[Circus of Crime]]. While as a member of that group, he battled with [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] and escaped.

Blackwing worked as an agent for [[HYDRA]] when his father was leader. He participated in the capture of [[Foggy Nelson]] and was once again defeated by Daredevil.

Blackwing later teamed up with [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]] to stake out his father's house when the [[Red Skull]] took the control of the base, turning the dialpitated mansion into his so-called Skull House. The duo battled [[Captain America]] during this event. He and Jack O'Lantern were recruited by [[Mother Night (comics)|Mother Night]] to join the [[Skeleton Crew (comics)|Skeleton Crew]] after the Red Skull was impressed with their abilites. Blackwing fought [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]] and [[Diamondback (comics)|Diamondback]] before they joined the Skeleton Crew. He and the rest of the Skeleton Crew were defeated by Captain America and [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]].

The second [[Crimson Cowl II|Crimson Cowl]] recruited Blackwing to join her incarnation of the [[Masters of Evil]]. He was defeated alongside them.

After that last defeat, Joseph abandoned the Blackwing identity and became a crimelord creating his own private villains in [[Heavy Mettle]]. He ordered [[Firestrike]] to bring him the battle suit of [[New Warriors]] member [[Turbo (comics)|Turbo]] in hopes of proving himself to his father and the other crime bosses of New York. The New Warriors defeated Joseph's group and Firestrike is currently in the Witness Protection Program in exchange for his testimony against Joseph Manfredi.
