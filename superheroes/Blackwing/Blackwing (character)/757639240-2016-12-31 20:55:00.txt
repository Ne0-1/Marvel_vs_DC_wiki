Blackwing worked as an agent for Silvermane's [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] (serving as the Air Action Division Leader) when his father was leader. He participated in the capture of [[Foggy Nelson]]. Blackwing battled Daredevil, [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]], [[Nick Fury]], and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and was once again defeated by Daredevil.<ref>''Daredevil'' #122-123</ref>

Blackwing later teamed up with [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)#Steven Levins|Jack O'Lantern]] to stake out his father's house when the [[Red Skull]] took the control of the base, turning the dilapidated mansion into his so-called Skull House.

==In other media==
A 1940s version of Joseph Manfredi appears in ''[[Agent Carter (TV series)|Agent Carter]]'' portrayed by [[Ken Marino]]. This version is the mob leader of the Los Angeles [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] branch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://variety.com/2015/tv/news/ken-marino-agent-carter-marvel-cast-1201632853/|title=Ken Marino Joins Season 2 Cast of 'Marvel's Agent Carter' (EXCLUSIVE)|last=Wagmeister|first=Elizabeth|date=November 4, 2015}}</ref> This character is an old acquaintance of [[Howard Stark]]. He first appears in the episode "The Atomic Job" where he is shown dining at a restaurant when [[Madame Masque|Whitney Frost]] and Calvin Chadwick visit him. Joseph had personal issues with Chadwick for having stolen something from him only to laugh about something that happened a decade ago. They discussed how Chadwick was running for senate and Manfredi noted that as he was connected to the [[Secret Empire|Council of Nine]] he would likely get elected. In exchange for accepting Whitney's offer for ownership of a freeway system, Joseph wants Chadwick to keep his name and the name of his men off the front pages of the newspapers. Before he makes his decision, Joseph called one of his mob operatives to him and beat him up for looking at Whitney inappropriately in front of the other patrons. After the mob operative's beaten body is removed, Joseph agrees to Whitney's deal. In the episode "Monsters", Manfredi's men provide security for Whitney's house as she tells him and Vernon Masters her next plan. Manfredi accompanies Whitney to Stark's mansion where they successfully capture Jason Wilkes and escapes after Whitney shoots Ava Jarvis in the stomach. In the episode "The Edge of Mystery", Joseph is visited at his restaurant by Peggy Carter and Daniel Sousa at the time when his grandmother was present. They have him carry a message to Whitney that involves an exchange where they get Wilkes and she gets the uranium rods. Joseph carries the message to Whitney. When it comes to the exchange, Peggy and Sousa obtain Wilkes while tricking Whitney and Joseph with the fake uranium rods while escaping. Upon Wilkes giving in to Whitney's offer and informing Whitney and Joseph where the real uranium rods are, they contact Vernon Masters to obtain them. Once that was done, they assemble the bomb that would open a portal into the [[Darkforce|Zero Matter]]'s dimension. Following Wilkes' trip there, Joseph has Peggy and [[Edwin Jarvis]] knocked out. In the episode "A Little Song and Dance", Whitney finds that Peggy and Edwin have escaped and orders Joseph to shoot the driver that discovered this. Joseph then takes Whitney and Jason to an abandoned sanitation facility in an attempt to extract the extra Zero Matter. In the episode "Hollywood Ending", Joseph talks to his grandmother about Whitney's condition and is advised by her to make a 'deal with the devil'. This leads to Joseph seeking out Stark to help get Whitney back to normal. While Joseph provides a diversion with one of his minions, Peggy and Daniel photograph the paper formulas on the walls in her room. After Whitney was defeated with her insanity committing her to an asylum, Joseph was seen visiting Whitney.
