The '''Iron Monger''' is an identity used by several [[fiction]]al [[supervillain]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The first and most notable person to take up the identity is '''Obadiah Stane'''. He first appeared in ''[[Iron Man]]'' #200 (November 1985), and was created by [[Dennis O'Neil]] and [[Luke McDonnell]].

Actor [[Jeff Bridges]] portrayed Obadiah Stane in the 2008 ''[[Iron Man (film)|Iron Man]]'' film.

==Publication history==
Obadiah Stane, who would become the first Iron Monger, debuted in ''Iron Man'' #163 ([[1982 in comics#October|October 1982]]). He dons the Iron Monger armor in issue #200 ([[1980s in comics#November|November 1985]]), and commits [[suicide]] in the same issue.

==Fictional character biography==
{{Expand section|date=October 2011}}
===Obadiah Stane===
As a child, Obadiah's father [[Zebediah Stane]] was a degenerate gambler and Obadiah's mother died of unknown reasons. One day, his father, who considered himself on a "lucky streak"; played a game of [[Russian roulette]] and shot himself in the head. This [[psychological trauma|trauma]] caused Obadiah to lose all of his blond hair and go bald and shaped him for years to come. From there on, Obadiah Stane was a ruthless manipulator who studied his adversaries to find weaknesses to exploit. Stane enjoys [[chess]], and lives his life with the same kind of methodical logic that he uses in the game. In addition, he is a strong believer in using [[psychological manipulation]] to his advantage. For instance, in a childhood chess match against another boy whose skill at least equaled his own, he killed the boy's dog so that the other would be distracted from the game.

In adulthood, as a wealthy financier, Obadiah Stane becomes the president and CEO of his own company ('''Stane International''') as a munitions dealer. He also goes into business with [[Howard Stark]]. After Stark and his [[Maria Stark|wife]] died in a car accident, Stane turns his sights on acquiring control of Stark International, the industrial corporation he had worked with, now owned by [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] (the son of Howard Stark). Stane has his agents, the Chessmen, attack Stark Industries and assault [[War Machine|James Rhodes]], a confidant of Tony.<ref>''[[Iron Man]]'' #163-165</ref> He also confronts Tony Stark in person.<ref>''Iron Man'' #166</ref> Stane also sets up Indries Moomji as Stark's lover without Stark knowing that Moomji is actually the Chessmen's Queen. Meanwhile, Stane and his associates conspire to lock Stark International out of various business deals. Stark eventually learns that Stane is the mastermind behind these attacks, but is unable to confront him. The assaults on Stark, his business, and his friend push Stark to the edge, and he catastrophically relapsed into [[alcoholism]].<ref>''Iron Man'' #167</ref> With the help of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], Stane buys out Stark International, which he then renames Stane International. Stark, having fallen off the wagon, relinquishes his armor to Jim Rhodes and disappears to be a [[homelessness|homeless]] vagrant. Rhodes becomes the new Iron Man while ignoring Stane's demands to relinquish the armor. Rhodes, as the new Iron Man, eventually thwarts Stane in his attempt to take over the Iron Man battle-suits.<ref>''Iron Man'' #173-174</ref>

Stane proceeds in manufacturing and supplying munitions and weapons to S.H.I.E.L.D. and others who could pay for them. When Tony Stark left, he left behind notes and information on the Iron Man armor. These notes are incomplete and hard to analyze, but Stane assigns a team of scientists to decipher them; they eventually create the Iron Monger armor which, according to Stane, is "far superior to Stark's Iron Man armor". He even considers selling them to the highest bidder or creating an army of Iron Mongers, using them to "take over any country he wanted".

Stane assigns the Termite to [[sabotage]] another business rival.<ref>''Iron Man'' #189</ref> He also forms an alliance with [[Madame Masque]].<ref>''Iron Man'' #190</ref>

While living on the streets, Stark befriends a [[pregnancy|pregnant]] homeless woman, Gertl Anders. She dies in [[childbirth]], whereupon Stark promises to protect the child. This vow helps Stark overcome his alcoholism.<ref>''Iron Man'' #182</ref> When Stark recovers, he joins Rhodes, along with twins Morley and Clytemnestra Erwin, in starting a new company in [[Silicon Valley]]<ref>''Iron Man'' #184</ref>, which is eventually dubbed Circuits Maximus.<ref>''Iron Man'' #188</ref> Stark builds a new prototype armor, resembling his original gray suit, in order to test new designs; Stark ends up using the armor to stop an out-of-control Rhodes<ref>''Iron Man'' #191-192</ref>, and then to assist the [[West Coast Avengers]] against [[Doctor Demonicus]], while using the Avengers' facilities to construct an advanced armor, the [[Iron Man's Armor#Silver Centurion|Silver Centurion]].{{Issue|date=July 2011}}

Realizing that Stark is once again a potential threat, Stane orders the abduction of [[Bethany Cabe]], and plans an attack to take out Iron Man, whom Stane has deduced is currently either Rhodes or one of the Erwins.  He sends an attack drone, the Circuits Breaker, to destroy Iron Man, but both Rhodes and Stark are able to defeat it.  Stane further plots against Stark by switching the minds of Masque and Cabe, and by abducting Stark's old friends [[Happy Hogan]], [[Pepper Potts]], and Bambi Arbogast.  He also has a bomb planted inside the Circuits Maximus [[Geodesic dome|dome]], killing Morley Erwin and wounding Rhodes and Clytemnestra.<ref>''Iron Man'' #195-197-198-199</ref>

When Cly confronts Stark at the hospital, Tony realizes he has to face Stane directly; he collects his newly-completed Silver Centurion armor from the Avengers compound, and flies to [[Long Island]]. Stark confronts Stane on the property of Stane International and defeats Stane's agents, including the Chessmen, who had proven a match for his previous armor. Stane dons the Iron Monger armor and confronts Stark personally. The Iron Monger is more powerful than the previous Iron Man armor, but not the Silver Centurion model, which includes such features as the ability to absorb the heat from the Iron Monger's thermal rays and channel it into the armor's own energy supplies. Stane tries to defeat Stark by tricking him into entering a room where Happy, Pepper, and Mrs. Arbogast are being held in suspended animation tanks that could sustain them for months; the walls of the room were covered with photo-electric cells that would trigger a circuit sending 200,000 volts into their bodies if Stark moved, leaving him with no choice but to stand in the room and starve to death to keep them alive. Refusing to give up, Stark calmly uses his armor's sensors to discover that the trap's power source is located within the firing arc of his chest-plate's uni-beam weapons, allowing him to destroy it.{{Issue|date=July 2011}}

Having freed his friends, Stark then confronts Stane and the villain learns that even in his armor, he is no match for Stark's genius and practiced skill with his own tools. Finally, Stane uses his last card: Gertl Anders' infant son, whom Stane had abducted from an orphanage. Stane tells Stark to remove his helmet or he would crush the baby between his palms. Stark, having detected interfering frequencies in his armor's systems throughout the battle, deduces that Stane isn't experienced enough to pilot the armor without some help in the form of an external computer. He uses his armor's pulse bolts to destroy the nearby building containing that computer, causing Stane's Iron Monger armor to seize up and fall to the ground as Stark swoops in to catch the baby; since Stane based the armor on Stark's old designs, Stark knew that the armor would freeze if it lost the control of an outside source. Stane then removes his helmet and confronts Stark. Stane says defiantly that he has one thing left; the ability to deprive Stark of the enjoyment he'd receive in his enemy's humiliation and defeat. Refusing to be arrested and humiliated, he then raises his hand to the side of his head and, using the repulsor ray beam, disintegrates his skull.<ref>''Iron Man'' #200</ref> Stark later obtains complete control over his own company, which he renames Stark Enterprises.{{Issue|date=July 2011}}

During the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline, Obadiah Stane in his Iron Monger armor was chosen as a member of [[Pluto (Marvel Comics)|Pluto]]'s jury of the damned to decide the fate of [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]].<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #129</ref> When the lord of Hades power was undone, it was Iron Monger who laid the first blow upon him, accompanied by the sound effect 'SHTAAANNE'.<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #131</ref>

During the ''[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]'' storyline, Obadiah Stane is among the dead characters in the Underworld that Pluto released in order to defend the Underworld from [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (comics)|Amatsu-Mikaboshi]]<ref>''Chaos War'' #2</ref>

===Simon Steele's employee===
Industrialist '''Simon Steele''' constructs another Iron Monger suit, and has an employee wear it in battle against [[Dominic Fortune]].<ref>''Iron Man'' #212</ref>

===Guardsman===
After Stane's death, the original Iron Monger armor was obtained by the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]]. General Lewis Haywerth has one of the [[Guardsman (comics)|Guardsmen]] use it to test the combat skills of a [[U.S. Agent]].<ref>''Captain America'' #354</ref>

===Slagmire===
Stark's former college classmate '''Joey Cosmatos''' builds a third Iron Monger suit, working from Stane's plans. This suit is worn by the criminal Slagmire, an operative of underworld boss Mr. Desmond.<ref>''Iron Man'' #253</ref>

===Cristoph Pfeifer===
The [[Red Skull]] later has one of his own agents use a suit of Iron Monger armor in an assassination attempt against the [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]], but the suit's wearer is apparently killed by the Viper's men.<ref>''Captain America'' #419</ref>

===The Cabal===
A group of renegade [[New York City Police Department]] officers calling themselves 'the Cabal' commissions Stane International to design a suit of combat armor that they would use to hunt down and kill criminals as their own personal [[Punisher]] agent.  Various members of the Cabal wear the resulting [[Savage Steel]] armor at different times, coming into conflict with Iron Man and [[Darkhawk]].

===Ezekiel Stane===
{{Main|Zeke Stane}}
Obadiah has a son named '''Ezekiel "Zeke" Stane''' who is introduced in ''[[The Order (comics)|The Order]]'' #8, as the brains and financial backing of a secret conspiracy to destroy the titular group, which has close ties to Stark. He would return in ''The Invincible Iron Man'' #1 to continue his vendetta against Stark in his father's name.<ref>{{cite news | author = Matt Brady | title = Fraction, Larocca helm new Iron Man series in May | publisher = [[Newsarama]] | date = 2008-02-11 | url = http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=146352 | accessdate=2008-02-11}}</ref> He gradually adapts his body to become a complete [[cyborg]] to the extent he, for instance, regenerates injuries very quickly, no longer needs to breathe, and generates at least as much energy as Iron Man. He constructs a special [[exoskeleton]] to help him deal with excess heat (and turn it into even more usable energy).

==Powers and abilities==
===Obadiah Stane===
Obadiah Stane was a genius with an M.B.A. He was a master of psychological warfare, a cunning business strategist, and a champion chess player. However, he had a classic narcissistic complex; his ego was his greatest vulnerability. 

As Iron Monger, Stane also used the Circuits Breaker, a flying robotic weapon that fires air-to-surface missiles. He also used a device created by Dr. Theron Atlanta for exchanging the consciousness of two human subjects. 

The Iron Monger armor, manufactured by Stane International and code-named I-M Mark One, is an armored battle-suit of "omnium steel" (a fictional alloy), containing various offensive weaponry including a powered exoskeleton that amplified the user's strength, repulsor rays fired from the gauntlets, and an intense laser beam housed in the battle-suit's chest unit. The suit provides the user with the ability of subsonic flight, thanks to magnetically powered turbine boot jets. Since the Iron Monger armor was based on a modified version of Tony Stark's Iron Man design, the armor's abilities are very similar to the original red and gold armor, but with increased power. The repulsors were more powerful and the armor was also larger than the armor of Iron Man. It was presumably proportionally stronger as well. The Iron Monger (unlike the Iron Man armor) was also externally computer-controlled, Stane attempting to use the remote control to compensate for his lack of experience in using the armor, a vulnerability Stark exploited to disable the suit.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Marvel===
[[Ultimate Marvel]] first shows a young Obadiah Stane in ''[[Ultimate Iron Man]]'' with [[Loni (Ultimate Iron Man)|Loni Stane]] (his mother) and visiting [[Zebediah Stane]] (his father) in jail (for kidnapped young [[Ultimate Iron Man (character)|Tony Stark]], whose covered in the blue skin-armor that the elder Stane wanted to manufacture). During the visit, Loni tells Zebadiah that she'll divorce him and get half while Obadiah (their son) gets the other half after Zebadiah's death. The story then fast forwards to Obadiah being enrolled in [[Baxter Building|a special school]] at his mother's personal request. Shortly after their arrival, Obadiah murders a pair of students (Link and Dodge) and make it look like an accident. This incident hardens Tony's resolve to improve his armor and punish Obadiah. At this point, he has already begun to build a suit that closely resembles a traditional Iron Man suit.{{Issue|date=July 2010}}

Later, Obadiah visits [[Howard Stark]] (who apparently murdered Zebadiah) and has the guards attempt murder Stark, but they failed. Obadiah reveals that he's working with Dolores, who is responsible for the earlier terrorist attack on the Stark building, and Dolores convinces Obadiah to try and murder Howard. Obadiah drugs a prison guard with a "hypnotizing" bio-drug, and the guard tries to kill Howard. He fails, but Howard gets shot in the process and is in ICU and Tony sends one of his "robots" to protect his father in the hospital.{{Issue|date=July 2010}}

Tony (in his Iron Man armor) goes to Obadiah’s house and confronts him on setting up Howard and sending him to prison for Zebediah's murder. Obadiah says it was all Dolores' idea, and sets up a meeting with Dolores and Tony. Obadiah also figures out that the armor is not a robot, and that Tony is actually inside, a fact he shares with Dolores before he meets with Tony.{{Issue|date=July 2010}}

Dolores and Tony make a deal. Dolores will give Tony the information about the terrorists with nukes who plan to bomb the city, and Tony will give Dolores one of his "robots". Tony, knowing that Dolores knows he wears the armor personally decides to trick him and actually bring an Iron Man suit that is remote controlled. Dolores and Tony meet on a place together, holding each other hostage while their friends confirm each others end of the bargain. Dolores is skeptical because the Robot isn't walking smoothly and is clumsy, and Tony is skeptical because the feds found a nuke but no terrorists with it, and the deal for terrorists. Dolores men plan to kill the feds who delivered them the robot, but Rhodes shows up to save them.{{Issue|date=July 2010}}

Tony then realizes that Dolores is no longer on the plane, and upon breaking into the cockpit he sees another nuke. He can't disable it, because then a separate bomb will go off, destroying the nuke and plane. War Machine goes to Dolores' Mansion, only to find him dead. Someone booby trapped his piano, and it blew up in his face while he was playing. Tony flies the plane low enough to the water that Obadiah can jump off into the water. He then gets his nanobots to disarm the nuke and set off the smaller bomb while he attempts to jump off the plane. They realize that another arms dealer was out to kill everyone (Dolores, Obadiah, and Tony).{{Issue|date=July 2010}}

Meanwhile, Howard is recovered enough to go to prison, but the guards sent to escort him were not sent by the Police Department. Howard fights them off and escapes. Tony meets with him, and says that he thinks it was Loni that is the mastermind behind the scenes trying to kill them. Tony, Rhodes, Nifara, Howard, and Obadiah set off to Utah to find Loni. They arrive and their chopper explodes, injuring Rhodes. Obadiah falls off a cliff, but Iron Man catches him as terrorists arrive on the scene. Iron Man flees, but follows them as they take Obadiah to his mother, Loni, and their hideout. Iron Man breaks into the compound and Loni floods it with poison gas trying to kill him, abandoning Obadiah. After Tony beats Loni and tends to Howard, Obadiah (mad that his mother abandoned him for dead with the poison gas) enters the room and kills her. However, he decides not to attack Tony, stating that he had save his life several times and that they are now even. They are all picked up by the feds and go home.<ref>''Ultimate Iron Man'' Vol. 2 #4</ref>

In ''[[Ultimate Comics: Armor Wars]]'', the mastermind behind the said events was '''[[Howard Stark Sr.]]''', whose human/machine armor slightly resembles the Iron Monger armor.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Armor Wars'' #3</ref>

{{Plot|section|date=January 2010}}
* Obadiah Stane appears in ''[[Iron Man: Armored Adventures]]'' voiced by [[Mackenzie Gray]].<ref>[http://marvel.toonzone.net/news.php?action=fullnews&id=98 "New Cast Information On Upcoming "Iron Man: Armored Adventures" Series"] James Harvey, Toon Zone, October 01, 2008</ref> In this version, he is one of Howard Stark's associates. Unlike Howard, Obadiah wants to use the company to create weapons in order to make more profit without considering the deaths it will cause. He is the second-most prominent antagonist, after the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]]. After Howard Stark rejects Stane's plans to upgrade the "Earth Mover" project, he is believed to have caused the aircraft that the Starks ride to explode, killing Howard, but leaving Tony a survivor, and continues to deny any involvement in the action (which in the season 1 finale was proven fact, as Gene aka the Mandarin stated it was his doing). After this, Stane becomes the new CEO of Stark Industries, as Tony is too young to assume the post, and ignores the boy's request to be involved. When Tony Stark becomes Iron Man for the first time, Obadiah (who is unaware that Iron Man is actually Tony Stark) immediately becomes strongly interested by his armor and tries to get Iron Man to his side. In the episode "Iron, Forged From Fire (Part 2)", Obadiah tests out the modified Earth Movers on Iron Man only for the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]] to attack and target one of his rings that Obadiah is wearing. Obadiah quickly surrenders the ring to Mandarin. After a brief fight between Mandarin and Iron Man, Obadiah tried a last time to convince Iron Man to join him in vain. In the episode "Cold War", it is revealed that Obadiah was responsible for the disfiguration of [[Blizzard (Donnie Gill)|the scientist who became]] [[Blizzard (comics)|Blizzard]] in an attempt to create a new weapon. Blizzard and Iron Man make an alliance against him, but Iron Man (understanding Blizzard has no consideration in killing innocents in order to get Stane) eventually turns against his ally and reluctantly saves Stane from the freezing villain. Instead of thanking him, Stane expresses his disappointment that Iron Man was safe, and vows to find out who he is and take the armor from him. Losing patience with this threats, Iron Man just answers "Your time is coming Stane" before shooting Stane's camera. In the episode "Field Trip", Stane is revealed to have a daughter named Whitney Stane whom he has no serious interest for his daughter except for her homework, and she apparently dislikes him. This later causes her to become the show's incarnation of [[Madame Masque]] in the episode "Masquerade" and impersonate him. In the episode "Seeing Red", he makes a deal with [[Project Pegasus]] scientist Anton Harkov to sponsor the research that Anton is working on. Obadiah has the [[Crimson Dynamo]] armor upgraded before sending it with O'Brian (Obadiah's head of security) to get Iron Man. Though the Crimson Dynamo succeeds in capturing the hero, Iron Man is able to escape before they can open the armor thanks to a diversion caused by [[Pepper Potts|Pepper]]. After the Crimson Dynamo has been defeated by Iron Man in his own Dynamo Armor and the Technovore virus eliminating the data on the Iron Man and Crimson Dynamo armors, Obadiah Stane had his secretary tell Anton that the offer is rescinded. In the episode "Chasing Ghosts," it was believed by Tony and Whitney that Obadiah hired Ghost to assassinate Tony. It turned out that Obadiah was actually tipping off the FBI about the assassination attempt. In the episode "Best Served Cold", Madame Masque makes one of her attempts on her father's life which is when Obadiah learns of her true identity upon being subdued. When Whitney falls ill from the effects of her mask, Obadiah calls in Tony to tell him about the mask. In order to obtain a cure for Whitney, Tony takes the Iron Man armor to an arctic base where an unrefined ore is located to help cure Whitney. Obadiah thaws out Blizzard and places an explosive on his costume in order to get him to obtain the ore first. When Blizzard goes back on the deal and freezes the explosive, he attacks Obadiah only to end up fighting Iron Man and Madame Masque. After Blizzard is defeated, Iron Man knocks out Obadiah so that Madame Masque couldn't kill him. After Whitney is cured, Obadiah thanks Tony for curing his daughter. In the episode "Invincible Iron Man: Disassembled," Obadiah Stane and Justin Hammer are kidnapped by Whiplash. In the episode "Ghost in the Machine," Obadiah Stane hires Ghost to steal the blueprints to the Iron Man armor. Ghost succeeds and Obadiah uses the blueprints to build the Guardsmen armors. In the episode "Armor Wars," Obadiah Stane makes a public service announcement about his Guardsmen making plans to bring down Iron Man and announces the Guardsmen Expo coming up. At the Stark International Guardsmen Expo, Obadiah Stane introduces Firepower as the third Guardsmen when Iron Man appears. Using the hacking of the televised screen at the expo, Iron Man reveals that Force and Shockwave were actually criminals, and Obadiah Stane is forced to feign surprise. He later makes a televised appearance stating that he had no idea the criminals used fake identities in order to get jobs at Stark International. Later, Stane was preparing to complete Project Monger as the field test for the Guardsmen is complete. In "The Might of Doom", Stane later contacted [[Doctor Doom]] for technological help with the Monger's power core. However, Doom used the opportunity to sabotage the core, hoping to take out his competitors in the resulting explosion. The Iron Monger appears for real in the tenth episode of the second season "Enter: Iron Monger". There, it is a huge machine, actually referred to as "[[mecha]]" during the test which was capable of easily destroying the [[Crimson Dynamo]] 3.0 armor. Its size was stated to be 30 feet, although [[War Machine|Rhodey]] later stated it to be 40 feet. Since the Board of Directors was skeptical about the practicality of such a costly machine, Stane decided to give a demonstration by having it demolish an abandoned city area. However, during the test, a man entered the area, and Iron Man along with War Machine interfered to save him. After the Iron Monger's test pilot O'Brien saw the reason for their action, he ceased the test and returned to base. Later, the Iron Monger (piloted by Stane himself this time) went to the same area again to fight Iron Man and War Machine. However, Tony has managed to download the Iron Monger's schematics and analysis has revealed that the mecha depends on an uplink to an external processing unit to function properly. After the uplink was disrupted, the Iron Monger was easily defeated. The next day, Tony was in the Board of Directors' room with Roberta Rhodes and Professor Zimmer (the old man that Iron Man rescued) where Roberta tells Obadiah that Professor Zimmer won't file charges if Obadiah leaves his building alone. In the episode "Heavy Mettle," Obadiah Stane has the Iron Monger armor tested against some tanks before some military officials. The demonstration is crashed by Iron Man who states that Obadiah Stane stole his Iron Man specs and ends up flying him up to the sky telling him that he will put an end to Obadiah Stane's "war." Obadiah states that the war has just begun. Obadiah Stane sells the military contract to the military surpassing Hammer Multinational's m. Using footage obtained by James Rhodes, Tony Stark and Roberta show footage of Obadiah Stane receiving the Iron Man specs from Ghost. The Board of Directors end up firing Obadiah Stane who vows to make Iron Man and the Board of Directors pay for this. Upon a comment made by Tony Stark, Obadiah Stane figures out that Tony Stark is Iron Man as he is dragged from Stark International by security. Obadiah Stane realizes that Tony Stark is Iron Man and later retaliates by stealing the Iron Monger armor after taking down the security guards that were guarding it with a self-defense gadget that Stark International developed. Justin Hammer then places a device that would make the Iron Monger armor go haywire as Obadiah Stane pilots the Iron Monger armor toward Roberta Rhodes' house. Iron Monger manages to take Pepper Potts hostage. At the suggestion of Sasha, Justin Hammer uses the Titanium Man armor to fight Iron Monger which doesn't go well. When Iron Man arrives in the Hulkbuster armor, Iron Monger pins down Iron Man and reveals that he knows his identity. Whitney Stane arrives and tries to convince her father to spare Iron Man for her. Iron Monger lifts his foot enough for Iron Man to escape as Justin Hammer orders Sasha to take control of the Iron Monger armor and send it on a rampage. Iron Man discovers that someone is remote-controlling the Iron Monger and suspects that Titanium Man is behind this. While Iron Man fights Titanium Man, War Machine tries to take out the Iron Monger's legs as the Iron Monger armor is controlled to try to eliminate Whitney. Iron Monger then falls off the building as Titanium Man laughs at this. Obadiah Stane ends up in a coma following what happened as Whitney arrives telling Tony, James, and Pepper to leave.

===Film===
[[Image:Ironmonger 2008film.jpg|thumb|300px|The Iron Monger armor in the ''[[Iron Man (film)|Iron Man]]'' film.]]
* [[Jeff Bridges]] plays Obadiah Stane as the main antagonist in the 2008 film ''[[Iron Man (film)|Iron Man]]''. This version of Stane is Stark's mentor, an old friend and business partner of his father's who handles the day to day workings of the company, while Stark serves mainly as "an idea man" (or "the [[Golden Goose]]", as Stane puts it). Obadiah Stane in the movie appears to have a keychain sized device that paralyses anyone in vincity who is not wearing ear protection for example ear plugs. Stane uses the device to steal the prototype armor and Stark's arc reactor that was keeping him alive. Although he at first appears to be a loyal and devoted friend to Stark, after the younger man returns from being held [[hostage]] in [[Afghanistan]], it is revealed that he has been secretly plotting to wrest control of the company from him for years, and in fact ordered the Afghanistan attack as part of a failed [[assassination]] attempt. Using Stark's public decision to shut down the company's weapons manufacturing division as a pretense, Stane gets an [[injunction]] on behalf of the [[shareholder]]s to essentially have Stark thrown out of his own company and take over. He then uses the fragments of Stark's [[prototype]] Iron Man armor, recovered from Afghanistan, to [[reverse engineering|reverse engineer]] a larger, more powerful version, which he hopes to mass produce and use to revolutionize modern warfare. However, his scientists are unable to duplicate the arc reactor, and Stane is forced to steal Stark's, which also serves as his [[life support]] system, exposing the extent of his treachery and leaving the hero for dead.  Stark is able to install the first arc reactor that [[Pepper Potts]] had mounted in a display case. By this point, however, Potts has stumbled onto Stane's criminal activities and alerts the agents of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]. Although they move in to arrest Stane, they arrive too late to stop him from activating and donning his armor prototype, which he uses to crush them and escape. It therefore falls to Stark, using that obsolete arc reactor, to stop him as Iron Man. This results in a lengthy battle in and around Stark Industries' headquarters, but Stark is outmatched by Stane, as his old reactor is underpowered for his current suit. The battle climaxes when Stark lures Stane into an aerial melee, correctly gambling that his enemy would not be ready for the dangerous high altitude icing conditions he already accounted for.  After the resulting fall, in which both men's armor are severely damaged (with Stark's armor now operating on only emergency back-up power), Stane is finally stopped when Stark orders Potts to overload the building's arc reactor. This unleashes a massive electrical surge that electrocutes Stane, after which he falls into the reactor itself, apparently killing him in the resulting explosion. His apparent death is subsequently covered up by S.H.I.E.L.D., which puts out a false story saying that he died in an [[aviation accidents and incidents|airplane crash]] while on vacation abroad. In a deleted scene, Stane actually survived the blast and was still injured on the building next to the badly damaged Tony Stark and was stuck in the armor. Making a speech about his and Tony's relationship, he grabbed Tony's hand, saying that it was time for both of them to go. However, the glove Tony wore fell off, causing the Monger armor to slip and Obadiah to fall to his doom.

* While Stane does not appear physically in ''[[Iron Man 2]]'', he's briefly seen on a magazine cover on a wall in [[Whiplash (comics)|Ivan Vanko]]'s room.<ref>[http://popwatch.ew.com/popwatch/2009/07/this-weeks-cover-iron-man-2.html This week's cover: 'Iron Man 2' with exclusive photos! | PopWatch Blog | EW.com]</ref>

===Video games===
* Iron Monger is featured in the [[2008 in video gaming|2008]] video game ''[[Iron Man (video game)|Iron Man]]'' voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]]. As in the movie, he persistently objects to Tony's new decision not to sell weapons any more. However, unlike in the movie, his resistance to this new strategy goes beyond developing the Iron Monger suit, contacting [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] to offer his services in helping them to develop weapons. With Stane's assistance, A.I.M. is able to create the [[Titanium Man]] armor, but their inability to perfect the power source means that the armor must periodically recharge during a fight, and the Titanium Man is thus defeated by Iron Man. With Tony distracted by dealing with A.I.M., Stane is able to complete the Iron Monger armor, subsequently facing Tony in a final confrontation before he is apparently killed as the arc reactor overloads.<ref>[http://www.gamefaqs.com/computer/doswin/file/941942/52724]</ref>

* Three Iron Monger figures are featured in the initial ''Iron Man'' film toy line by [[Hasbro]], one of which features an "opening cockpit" that reveals Jeff Bridges' character inside. The second has a smashing fist action, with less movie accurate red lights.  The third figure has since been repainted and released to appear more like the comic version's blue armor.<ref>[http://www.hasbro.com/marvel/ironman/default.cfm?page=Products/Detail&product_id=21521 Iron Man: Iron Monger- Product Detail<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>http://www.hasbro.com/marvel/ironman/default.cfm?page=Products/Detail&product_id=21523</ref> A repaint of the Fist Smash Attack Iron Monger mold called Battle Monger in the colors of Iron Man, is an upgraded model according to its bio.

===Novels and Books===
* In the novel ''[[Spider-Man: Venom's Wrath]]'', an early scene features Spider-Man confronting a teenager named Daniel in a "cheesy exoskeleton" who calls himself the Iron Monger, and attempts to rob a movie theater (a police officer told Spider-Man that this was the third time he had attempted something like this). Spider-Man explains that "an ironmonger is someone who ''sells'' iron, not someone who ''wears'' it. Last guy to use the name was an industrialist, so it fit ''him''." Daniel's suit includes a laser weapon he calls a "[[hydrogel]] blast", despite Spider-Man realizing that term makes no sense
