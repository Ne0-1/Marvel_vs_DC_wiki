'''Thunderstrike''', aka Eric Masterson, is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Universe]].  After [[Thor]] briefly dissapeared,  Eric Masterson was then endowed with the ability to take on Thor's powers and physical appearance. Once the original Thor returned, Odin then awarded Masterson with his own mace, which possessed similiar powers to Thor's mallet Mjolnir, thus adopting the name Thunderstrike (which is also the name of his hammer).  Thunderstrike later died sacrificing himself in a battle against the villanous [[Bloodaxe]].
