'''Eric Masterson''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]] acting as a [[superhero]] under the names of Thor and Thunderstrike.  His son, [[Thunderstrike|Kevin Masterson]] also took up the name of Thunderstrike in the [[MC2]] universe.

==Fictional character biography==
The Norse thunder god Thor merged with an Earth architect called Eric Kevin Masterson, who - after Thor seemingly killed Loki - would be given the form and power of Thor in the original's stead while Thor was sealed in a corner of the merged body's mind.
Eventually, Loki would be revealed to have possessed Odin to manipulate matters, and both he and Thor were restored to their own bodies.

Eric returned to Earth and continued fighting crime, even joining the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] since for a brief time he still had a direct connection to Thor's powers. Although he and Thor were separate beings once again, Eric found he could still transform into the Asgardian body. Thor gave Eric Mjolnir and bid Eric return to Earth and continue as its protector. Eric's position as Thor didn't last long, however; he was manipulated by the [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]] into attacking Thor over Sif's affections. Thor tried to talk Eric down until Eric hit Sif, which provoked Thor's anger. Thor defeated Eric easily and reclaimed Mjolnir for himself. Odin appeared and revealed the Enchantress' hand, but Eric was humiliated and no longer believed himself worthy of carrying on in Thor's name. Odin assured Eric that, although Mjolnir was created for Thor alone, Eric was still quite worthy and rewarded him with an enchanted mace called Thunderstrike, after which he would change his heroic name to match the mace.

During his first battle with the powered anti-hero [[Bloodaxe (comics)|Bloodaxe]], Eric realised that while he retained the appearance of Thor that he had had while using Mjolnir, his strength was greatly diminished. He also found out (while being beaten to a pulp by Bloodaxe) that the Thunderstrike Mace had several differences to Mjolnir. He was unable to command the storm, call upon lightning or perform many of the weather based attacks that Mjolnir had allowed him to perform.

After his defeat to Bloodaxe, he decided that a new costume was in order so that Thor's reputation would remain intact. He abandoned the cape, boots and signature winged helmet in favor of leather boots and vest, a lightning bolt earring and a ponytail. When he was identified as Thor after defeating Bloodaxe, he replied "No. He's the other guy. My name is..er..Thunderstrike", taking the name of his mace when unable to come up with something better.

Bloodaxe would continue to be Thunderstrike's main foe throughout the 24 issue run of his solo comic. In the end, Thunderstrike defeated Bloodaxe (who was on 'his' way to try and kill Seth, the Serpent God of Death) only to discover that she was his love interest Jackie Lukus.
Realising that the only way to defeat Seth was by increasing his own power levels, Eric allowed himself to succumb to the homicidal curse contained within [[Bloodaxe (comics)|Bloodaxe]]'s axe (Formerly the axe of Skurge the [[Executioner (comics)|Executioner]]) in order to possess enough power to battle and defeat Seth. After he had seemingly slain Seth, the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] attempted to take the Thunderstrike/Bloodaxe amalgam down for murder, only to find he was beyond their control. After defeating most of the Avengers with little to no effort, Thor arrived to face down his former friend. It was at this time that Eric managed to plead "stop me Thor...please stop me...if you can..". During the ensuing slug-fest with Thor, Eric's body is possessed by the axe, leaving Eric's consciousness to battle in his own mind against the personification of the axe's evil. Skurge is not only his mental avatar and ally in defeating the axe, but also the cause of the evil that threatens to destroy Eric entirely. Eric managed to put the Asgardian majicks of the Thunderstrike Mace against the similar majicks of Skurge's axe. The resulting psychic backlash then destroyed Thunderstrike, and assumedly the two weapons as well.

Thunderstrike is later greeted in Valhalla by Thor, but Eric states that Thunderstrike is not who he is. Odin agrees and despite Thor's protests, Eric reasons that Valhalla is not where he belongs. Thor begrudgingly accepts this, as Odin leads Eric off to a shaft of light.

Thunderstrike would later appear (complete with mace) in Avengers Vol. 3 #10 & #11 as an undead Avenger minion of the Grim Reaper. After overcoming the Grim Reaper's control, he (and other undead Avengers) were returned to the spirit world by the Scarlet Witch. It is not made clear if this was Eric that returned, or a magical construct of some sort, although his last words were to Thor in regards to checking on his son Kevin.

==Alternate Versions==
When the [[Thunderstrike (Kevin Masterson)|Kevin Masterson Thunderstrike]] and the [[A-Next]] team of which he was a member (successor Avengers in the MC2 alternate future, Earth-982) travelled through a [[Portal]] to another [[alternate dimension]], they were confronted with their dark [[doppelgangers]], the Thunder Guard. Kevin's alternate, Stormtrooper, attacked the heroes seconds before they were whisked away to safety. When the two Thunderstrikes again battled they discovered that Stormtrooper was in fact that universes' Eric Masterson, not Kevin. Due to Kevin never really knowing his real father and Eric having lost his real son, the two reconciled, and bonded. After A-Next defeated the dark dimension's ruler, Kevin stayed behind to be with his "father". Stormtrooper's costume consisted of a black leather vest with a golden thunderbolt belt buckle, black pants, black gloves and black knee-high leather boots.

==Powers==
Thunderstrike's powers derived from his enchanted mace which was often disguised as a walking stick.  By willing it and stamping his walking stick  on the ground Eric Masterson would be transformed into a superhuman form dressed in the garb of Thunderstrike.
In this form Thunderstrike had superhuman strength slightly higher than the average Asgardian, but significantly lower than Thor.  All of his other physical abilities were also enhanced greatly increaing his reflexes, durability, and speed.  He could survive in space unaided.  
When he stamped his mace again he would turn back into Eric Masterson with any physical damage suffered fully healed.  The only exception would be certain mystical spells such as Seth's mark of death.

The other powers Thunderstrike possessed originated from his mace.  He could throw it and it would return to his hand.  It could fire mystical bolts of energy.  By throwing it and holding the strap Thunderstrike could mimic flight, but it was harder to control than Mjolnir.  It could track energy sources across distances such as Bloodaxe.  Finally, by whirling the mace around himself Thunderstrike could create mystical vortexes to teleport himself.

The primary differences between Mjolnir and the Thunderstrike mace were the lack of weather control powers and overall lower power level such as strength and durability.
