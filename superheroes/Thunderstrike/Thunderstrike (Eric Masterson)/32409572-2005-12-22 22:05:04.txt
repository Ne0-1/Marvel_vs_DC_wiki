'''Thunderstrike''' (real name Eric Masterson) is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  When [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] briefly disappeared, Eric Masterson was endowed with the ability to take on Thor's powers and physical appearance, and masqueraded as Thor for a time. Once the original Thor returned, Odin then awarded Masterson with his own mace, which possessed similar powers to Thor's mallet Mjolnir; Masterson's new codename and the name of his mallet were both ''Thunderstrike''.  Thunderstrike later died in battle with the villainous [[Bloodaxe (comics)|Bloodaxe]] and the Egyptian death god [[Set (Serpent God)|Set]]. Masterson was possessed by the homicidal curse contained within Bloodaxe's axe and chose to sacrifice himself rather than become a murderer.
