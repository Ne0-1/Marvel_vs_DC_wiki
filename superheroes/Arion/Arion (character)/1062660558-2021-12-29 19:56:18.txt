'''Ahri'ahn''' (more commonly referred to as '''Arion''') is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[sword and sorcery]] superhero published by American company [[DC Comics]]. He debuted in ''[[Warlord (DC Comics)|Warlord]]'' (vol. 1) #55 (March [[1982 in comics|1982]]), and was created by [[Paul Kupperberg]] and [[Jan Duursema]].<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation | last = Wallace | first = Dan | contribution = Arion, Lord of Atlantis | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages = 24 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = London | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5}}</ref>

While a legendary, heroic figure in the mythology of [[Atlantis (Aquaman)|Atlantis]] and considered historically the most powerful [[wizard (fantasy)|wizard]], Arion also serves as a [[Lords of Chaos and Order|Lord of Order]] dedicated to fighting the forces of evil, notably [[Atlantis (Aquaman)|fellow Atlantean]] gods with ties to the [[Lords of Chaos and Order|Lord of Chaos]]. Even after the fall of the mythological continent, Arion continues to act as a sorcerous hero in the modern age, depicted as an ally of [[Aquaman]] and [[Powergirl]]. After the reality-altering events of ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'', the character is depicted as a historical king of legend and as an ancestor to [[Aquaman]] responsible for Atlantis's advanced technology and magic.

==Publication history==
Prior to the creation of the Arion character and his debut in his backup series, Kupperburg began coming up with new ideas that lead to his backup series when his then-editor, Laurie Sutton, mentioned that ''Dragonsword'' (the current backup of ''Warlord'' then) was eventually going to end. Sutton also mentioned the only requirement of the series was it to be set in the sword-and-sorcery genre. Kupperburg suggested a story of a young mage while Sutton requested it to take place in the fabled location, Atlantis. During the creation of the series, the name of the main character was noted to be a difficult process but eventually, "Arion" was settled with the names "Tynan", "Atlan", and "Orin" as contender.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Review of Arion, Lord Of Atlantis ongoing series|url=http://www.dcinthe80s.com/2016/02/review-of-arion-lord-of-atlantis.html|access-date=2021-12-22|language=en}}</ref> Although the names weren't used for the main character, the names appeared in both ''Arion, Lord of Atlantis'' and later ''Aquaman'' title.

Arion began as a back-up feature in the DC Comics book ''[[Warlord (DC Comics)|Warlord]]'' with issue #55,<ref name="Guide">{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=18}}</ref> in which ran until issue #62 before Arion gained his own series, A''rion Lord of Atlantis'', beginning with #1 (November [[1982 in comics|1982]]). The series lasted for 35 issues plus a special which wrapped up the original storyline, running from November [[1982 in comics|1982]] to September [[1985 in comics|1985]] with the special shipping in November [[1985 in comics|1985]]. Concurrently between April 1985 - March 1986, Arion was one of the many characters involved in the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' crossover title, with his history of Atlantis inserted into the main DC continuity. Arion also appeared in ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' in a crossover with [[Superman]].<ref>''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' #75 (November 1984)</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Greenberger|first1=Robert|title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia|last2=Pasko|first2=Martin|date=2010|publisher=Del Rey|isbn=978-0-345-50108-0|page=15}}</ref>

Years later in 1991, Kupperburg sent in a proposal for what would eventually be ''Arion the Immortal'', a sequel to his original series. Originally titled ''Arion: Darkworld'' and ''Arion, Lord of Order'', due to elements similar to characters presented in ''Doctor Fate'' and the ''[[Sandman (DC Comics)|Sandman]]'' titles, the draft was reworked as to make the characters involved in the book independent of the same [[Lords of Chaos and Order]] concept of magic different from the framework established in two DC Comic titles as to not interfere with their direction and depiction.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-06-22|title=ARION THE IMMORTAL, The Proposal {{!}} Paul Kupperberg|url=https://kupps.malibulist.com/2019/06/22/arion-the-immortal-the-proposal/|access-date=2021-12-22|website=Paul Kupperberg {{!}} And Then I Wrote...}}</ref> Despite the efforts to ensure the characters and concepts in the series were dissimilar to both titles, many references books and encyclopedia later connected Arion's character, supporting cast, and villains to the same Lords of Chaos and Order characters in both titles.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/936192301|title=The DC comics encyclopedia: the definitive guide to the characters of the DC universe|publisher=[[DK (publisher)|DK Publishing]]|others=Alan Cowsill, Alexander Irvine, Steven Kort√©, Matthew K.

Although in the modern era, Arion appeared in several crossovers with ''Aquaman'', ''Wonder Woman'', and ''Justice League'' crossovers in the mid 90s and later in the early 2000s, played a role in the ''JSA'' title, where the character himself was also connected to the other characters involved in Lords of Order and Chaos but was killed off in the 50th issue.

==Fictional character biography==
===Pre-Crisis===
====Origin====
In Arion's original origin told to him by Calculha, Arion was a cosmic born from energies coalesced into form. Because of his standing as a cosmic being, he is capable of affecting the balance between both order and chaos and because of that, is chosen as a unwitting agent. He is found by his aged mentor, Calculha, who is considered the most powerful sorcerer of his time and is tutored in the art of magic and spell-casting. Through their training, they form a bond similar to that of father and son.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kupperberg|first=Paul|title=Warlord #58|publisher=DC Comics|year=1982}}</ref>

In his revised origin story, much of the elements of his original backstory changed: Arion (referred to then as "Ahri'ahn") is one of the two biological sons of Calculha (who was formerly featured simply as his father-figure and mentor in the earlier issues of Warlord) and Dark Majistra (a sorceress with an appearance implying her to be an ancestor of those who would eventually become the [[Egyptians]]),as well as the [[fraternal twin]] of Garn Daanuth. Ahri'ahn was prophesized to be a savior of Atlantis. Shortly after their birth, Calculha and Majistra separated, leaving the two unaware of their true relation to one another for thousands of years. As they grew up, their parents became political rivals as they were representatives of a cabal of sorcerers from various mythological locations. While Ahri'ahn was taught [[white magic]] by their father, Garn was taught [[black magic]] by their mother. The two brothers eventually meet for the first time and bore witness to their parent's differing vision for Atlantis through the use of powerful mystical artifacts known as the Zodiac Crystals, crystals shaped like the [[Zodiac]] signs that controlled the magical flow of Earth. While Calculha called upon the cabal to keep them separate and senses the impending interference, Majistra sought to combine all crystals in a attempt to create a new era of mystical [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] despite the risks. Despite being outvoted, Majistra would instead use the crystals to further her own power, proving to be the very interference Calculha sensed. Ahri'ahn sacrificed his life to prevent his mother from attaining power but at a cost: both his father and mother would become trapped in an extradimensional realm known as "Darkworld", Garn's skin was drained of color and gave him the appearance of a albino, Arion's body was converted into energy and sent into a star while his soul was sent into Darkworld as well, and the family feud caused Earth's first [[Ice age|Ice Age]]. Eventually, Calculha a used his newfound might he gained in over the course of 100,000 years in his imprisonment and resurrected his son with the aid of Wyynde into his second incarnation, which was christened "Arion" by Wyynde, a [[Language change|corruption]] of his actual name. He is taken to Atlantis and is made Lord High Mage for the King of Atlantis, D'Tilluh. Eventually, he is re-taught magic he had forgotten by Calculha and becomes one of Atlantis's foremost protectors, aided by his companions Wyynde, Atlantean lieutenant guardsman and Lady Chian, Captain of D'Tilluh's royal guard and lover.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kupperberg|first=Paul|title=Arion, Lord of Atlantis #4|publisher=DC Comics|year=1982}}</ref>

Later additions to his origin expand on the time in which his soul existed in a state of intangibility in Darkworld as he was raised by sorceress Jheryl and befriended the [[Imp]], Ghy. Also teaching him magic, she created the very red gemstone he bore with him after his resurrection as Arion and served as his motherly figure in place of Majistra. When called back to the land of the living by his father, the sudden departure from one realm to another blocked his memory of his time in Darkworld. Owing to its unique regard to time, only twenty years passed in the realm while 100,000 years passed on Earth.<ref>''Arion'' #33, 1985</ref>

==== ''Arion, Lord of Atlantis'' (1982-1985) ====
Throughout his life as Lord High Mage, Arion would have many adventures; he would encounter and be pitted against various gods of the Atlantean pantheon, ended the Ice Age at the cost of his own magical power and sought ways to reclaim his former might. He would also encounter Garn and learn of their true connections as well as gain a new ally: Mara. Eventually, Arion defeated Garn once and for all by sealing him away in Darkworld. Arion would also reclaim his magical power when he was lured into Darkworld by his mother in a plot to gain more powerful through a connection to Darkworld like its respective denizens. With his soul re-worked by the deity known only as the Weaver, Arion gains his former might but is unable to stop the destruction of Atlantis when Chaon, one of the Atlantean dark gods, led a alien race (later revealed to be descendants of Atlanteans that ventured into space) against Atlantis and sunk it himself. With the empire fractured, the remaining Atlanteans venture to other corners in the globe to rebuild.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kupperburg|first=Paul|title=Arion, Lord of Atlantis (1982-1985) #1-#35, Special #1|publisher=DC Comics|year=1982-1985}}</ref>

==== ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' ====
Arion would appear in the ''Crisis on Infinite Earth'' crossover as being among the heroes taken in by Habringer and aids the heroes.

=== Post-Crisis ===
Owing to the events of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', Arion's universe now exists in the same DC Multiverse with a few changes; Arion's version of Atlantis took place in the distant past, roughly around 500,000 years before the main DCU timeline and is explained that despite Arion's belief, Atlantis as a whole wasn't destroyed.<ref>{{Cite book|last=David|first=Peter|title=Aquaman: The Atlantis Chronicles|last2=Greenberger|first2=Robert|publisher=DC Comics|year=2017}}</ref> He was also made part of Powergirl's backstory, being his great-granddaughter jettisoned into the future, her powers said to originate from Arion's experimentation in genetic manipulation<ref>''[[Secret Origins'' #11 (February 1987)</ref> and an ancestor of [[Zatanna|Zatanna Zatara]] through her mother's side.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Marrs|first=Lee|title=Zatanna: Come Together #4|publisher=DC Comics|year=1993}}</ref> Eventually, Arion and characters within his series would be connected to DC's ''[[homo magi]]'' and the [[Lords of Chaos and Order]], the aforementioned sorcerer being among the Lords of Order. Affiliated characters, like his father and mother, would also be retconned into being deities themselves, making him an actual being of divine origin.<ref name="dc-ency" />

Later, an aged Arion is revealed be immortal and to have lost his magic and is living in [[Greenwich Village]] along with several former Atlantean gods and goddesses, including '''Chaon''', '''Deedra''', '''Gemimn''', and the '''Weaver'''. His companion, Mara, was trapped in canine form when the magic was lost.<ref>''Arion the Immortal'' #1-2, 1992</ref>  Arion renews his old rivalry with his brother, Garn Daanuth, and works to stop the return of Atlantean magic by preventing Darkworld, revealed to be a sentient being, from slumbering.<ref>''Arion the Immortal'' #3-6, 1992</ref>

In the ''Time Masters'' mini-series Rip Hunter and allies travel back in time to Atlantis where Arion assists them while trying to convince Hunter to not use violence.

After ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]'', Arion aided The [[Justice League|Justice League America]] against Scarabus.<ref>''[[Justice League America]]'' #93-94</ref> He eventually turned up in the present day where his body was taken over by [[Mordru]] and his spirit imprisoned in [[Gemworld]]. His spirit was finally released and allowed to go to the afterlife by Power Girl and Hawkgirl (along with a recently awakened [[Hawk and Dove|Dove]]), in order to weaken Mordru. Before his soul departed, Arion revealed to Power Girl that she was not his granddaughter and thus not an Atlantean.

Arion seemingly reappeared in ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' as one of the mystics gathered in Atlantis to keep [[Spectre (comics)|the Spectre]] at bay, and later in the ''[[Day of Vengeance]]'' tie-in special as one of several magical beings summoned to help rebuild the shattered Rock of Eternity. No explanation was given for Arion's involvement at the time. It was later revealed that this Arion was, in fact, a pretender, a native of Akron named Bill Knightley who had decided to trade on Arion's name and reputation to build himself up in the mystical community.<ref>''Superman'' #663</ref>

====Camelot Falls====
A past version of Arion later appears. In the year 1659, Arion is awakened from a night of debauchery by visions of a cataclysmic future centered around the presence of Superman. Cut off from his natural magics, Arion employed certain artifacts to propel himself forward to Superman's present. Arriving in Metropolis, Arion subjected Superman and his friends at the ''[[Daily Planet]]'' to a vision of a possible future where Superman and other alien heroes' involvement in humanity caused people to become dependent on them, ultimately producing an apocalypse as their alien intervention held back the 'natural cycle' of civilisations falling upon reaching their peak, culminating in a mass apocalypse as the darkness they had held back for so long came at them with full force. Arion hoped to force Superman to retire and prevent the predictions from coming true.

Superman was given two weeks in which to decide how he would deal with Arion's request, during which Arion illustrated his point by magically steering a "field trip" of adolescent [[New Gods]], chaperoned by [[Lightray (DC Comics)|Lightray]] and Fastbak, to come crashing into Metropolis and go wild with their divine powers, causing untold havoc and general interference with the populace. Superman defused the situation with Lightray's help and deduced Arion's involvement. At roughly the same time, Arion kidnapped Bill Knightley from outside the [[Oblivion Bar]], interrogated him, and nearly killed him. The only thing that saved Knightley was his knowledge of the recently begun "Tenth Age of Magic", a tumultuous change in the world's mystical equilibrium. Knightley claimed to be studying the shift and Arion decided he might have some value alive.<ref>[http://www.dcdatabaseproject.com/wiki/index.php/Arion Ahri'ahn (New Earth) - DC Database]</ref>

At the end of the two weeks, Arion and Superman met again; Superman chose to remain active as part of Earth's defense and deeply involved with humanity, refusing to give up hope that he could make a difference. Arion's vicious response was to cast a powerful mind manipulation spell, with the intent of using Superman as a weapon to remove the threat of other alien heroes. Superman was able to resist thanks to training from the [[Martian Manhunter]] after his period under the control of [[Maxwell Lord]].<ref name="dc-ency"/> Given a mystic shield by the [[Phantom Stranger]] to protect him from direct assault by Arion's magics (during which the Stranger revealed that, while Arion's prediction ''could'' come to pass, the loss of life and experience that would result if Superman simply allowed civilisation to fall meant that mankind had to try to find another way), Superman was able to defeat Arion and disarm him of his rings, amulets and charms from which he derived his magic. Arion was returned to 1659 where he plans his next move on Superman in the future.

===The New 52===
====''Secret Six'' Vol. 2: The Gauntlet (2014-2016)====
Although he did not make a full appearance, Arion would make a brief cameo and was mentioned in the 2014 ''[[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]]'' relaunch; it is revealed that million of years ago, he was the wizard responsible for sealing away elder gods known as the "Dark Giants", whom appear to be both based on and a reference to [[Cthulhu Mythos deities]] and are the central antagonists that threaten the world in the modern day from being released due to [[Black Alice (comics)|Black Alice]]'s condition of siphoning magic around the world, undoing the very seals that kept them in place. His children also as the antagonist as they work to help undo the seal, having formed a cult named the "Children of Arion". The four members remain nameless save seemingly the leader, Uvian.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Simone|first=Gail|title=Secret Six (2014-2016) Vol. 2: The Gauntlet|publisher=DC Comics|year=2017}}</ref>

====DC Rebirth====
Following the company-wide rebranding in [[DC Rebirth]], Arion made his new debut in the 2016 ''[[Blue Beetle]]'' series. In this continuity, he shares similarities to his previous version such as being a former king of Atlantis and is stated to be a Lord of Order manifested in the physical form of a Atlantean demigod. He is also indirectly mentioned alongside his brother by the newer version of Calculha and Dark Majistra, this revised history making him an ancestor of [[Aquaman]], [[Ocean Master]], [[Atlan (DC Comics)|Dead King Atlan]], and [[Atlanna]].

=====''Blue Beetle'' Vol. 2: Hard Choices (2016-2018)=====
Thousands of years ago, Arion was believed to have been turned into an insane villain from exposure to the Blue Beetle scarab and gains a more demonic appearance from usage of more malevolent magic. After being sealed away by [[Doctor Fate]] long ago, he uses his apprentice Mordecai Cull to lure Doctor Fate. Jaime Reyes, and the Blue Beetle scarab into undoing his sealing, stealing the scarab for himself to use its power to destroy the world. With the help of Doctor Fate and his allies, Jaime Reyes manages to defeat the sorcerer and his Atlantean demons created by his magic.<ref name="Blue Beetle" />

====DC Universe (2017 - )====
=====''Justice League'' (2018) backup: ''Justice League Dark''=====
In the 2018 ''Justice League'' backup issues of ''Justice League Dark'', the famous sorcerer of Arthurian legends, Merlin, plots to conquer all of magic under his control. His quest pits him against [[Justice League Dark]], [[Aquaman]], and [[Atlantis (Aquaman)|Atlantis‚Äôs Silent School]]. Wanting to control the extra-dimensional wellspring of Atlantean magic known as Darkworld without doing so personally, he uses his magical knowledge to resurrect Arion, whom has a natural connection to Darkworld, and puts him under mind control as one of his Sapphire Knights.<ref>{{Cite book|last=V|first=Ram|title=Justice League (2018) #69 - Justice League Dark: A Knight Reborn|publisher=DC Comics|year=2021}}</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Both an immortal sorcerer and among the Lords of Order, Arion's magical heritage and centuries of studies makes him one of the most powerful sorcerers in the history of the DC Universe; at the height of his power, Arion wielded magical energy considered nearly limitless and had various powers such as being able to increase his size, cast illusions and create natural disasters. After sacrificing much of his magical power, he confers to utilizing a source of power for his magics and eventually gains a connection to the extradimensional Darkworld, restoring much of his former might; his connection to Darkworld grants him variant of magic unique to other magic users known as "Atlantean magic".<ref name="Whos Who 1993">{{cite book|title=Who's Who In the DC Universe Update 1993 #2|date=January  1993|publisher=DC Comics|chapter= Arion the Immortal}}</ref><ref name="Definitve Directory">{{cite book|title=Who's Who: The Definitive Directory of the DC Universe #1|date= March 1985|chapter=Arion, Lord of Atlantis|publisher=DC Comics}}</ref> 
<ref name="DC Comics Encyclopedia">{{cite book|title=DC Comics Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded|publisher=DC Comics|chapter=Arion, Lord of Atlantis|date=2008}}</ref> Arion also has a heighted "sixth sense" and the gift of prophecy, allowing himself to sense disturbances in the present and in the future. He is also an accomplished hand-to-hand combatant and swordsman despite preferring magical solutions and is a skilled [[three-card monte]] dealer.<ref name="Definitve Directory"/><ref name="DC Comics Encyclopedia"/><ref name="Whos Who 1993"/>

His depiction in Rebirth-onward has changed some elements of his powers; Arion wields vast natural magical powers naturally of a demonic and evil nature, possessing malevolent magical energies and energy siphoning abilities powerful enough to sap energies from potent sources like [[Doctor Fate]]'s Helm of Nabu and the [[Blue Beetle|Blue Beetle Scarab]].<ref name="Blue Beetle">{{cite book|title=Blue Beetle Vol. 2: Hard Choices (Rebirth)|publisher=DC Comics|last=Griffin|first=Keith|date=January 2, 2018}}</ref> While a master sorcerer, Arion is also a renown, ancient scientific genius responsible for the advanced level of technology Atlantis and possess a connection to the "Death Force" through his creation, the Tear of Extinction and the Clarion, able to kill and send gods to the afterlife though it seemingly costed his sanity and corrupted him, being responsible for his dark turn in the present day.<ref>{{cite book|title=Aquaman/Justice League: Drowned Earth|publisher=DC Comics|last1=Abnett|first1=Dan|last2=Snyder|first2=Scott|date= November 21, 2018}}</ref>

==In other media==
* Arion makes his first animated appearance in season four of ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'', voiced by David Kaye. This version of Arion differs from his comic book incarnation; he is a grandson of [[Vandal Savage]], making him a relative to [[Doctor Fate|Nabu]] and [[Scandal Savage|Cassandra Savage]], and is an agent of order responsible for the advance technology of Atlantis. Unlike his comic book counterpart, his magical abilities are also centered around his crown. During his lifetime, the Lords of Order sensed chaos brewing on Earth & imbued him with magical powers through a crown, making him an agent. He became responsible for Atlantis‚Äôs advancement and his bloodline created the Homo Magi race due to his metahuman gene through his grandfather & his body having been imbued with the magics from his crown. When he learned his grandfather set out to sink Atlantis to further the Homo Magi & Atlantean, he opposed his grandfather and is killed while attempting to protect it as [[Klarion the Witch Boy]] sinks the city. Survivors of his bloodline adapted to the pressures and environment of the ocean, making him the common ancestor of modern Atlanteans, the Homo Mermanus. This version is the ancestor to a plethora of characters including [[Aquaman]] & [[Doctor Fate (Khalid Nassour)|Khalid Nassour]].
