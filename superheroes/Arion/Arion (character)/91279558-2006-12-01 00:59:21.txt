'''Arion''' is a [[fictional character]] from [[DC Comics]]' [[DC Universe|universe]]. Arion began as a secondary feature of the DC Comics book [[Warlord (comics)|Warlord]] in issue #55 (March 1982). This continued until the October issue (#62). Arion then gained his own series ''Arion Lord of Atlantis'' #1, November [[1982]]. written by [[Paul Kupperberg]] and drawn by [[Jan Duursema]].  

==History==
'''Arion, Lord of Atlantis''' only lasted for 35 regular issues from November [[1982]] to September [[1985]]. There was a special finale issued in late 1985 in which Atlantis was destroyed. Arion also appeared in [[DC Comics Presents]] in a crossover with [[Superman]].

==Plot==
The title character Arion is a powerful [[Homo Magi]] from the nobility of ancient [[Atlantis]]. Ari'ahn and Garn Daanuth are the twin sons of '''Calculha''' and '''Dark Majistra''', two very powerful Atlantean sorcerers. While Calculha raised Ari'ahn to be a follower of light and the [[Lords of Chaos and Order|Lords of Order]], Majistra raised Garn to be an acolyte of the Lords of Chaos.  His companions include an Atlantean guardsman, Wyynde, and Lady Chian, his lover and the captain of King D'Tilluh's royal guard. Among his enemies are his brother Garn Daanuth, a formidable [[Wizard (fantasy)|practitioner of the dark arts]] and Chaon, the puissant god of evil and chaos.  

He appeared later in the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]] and was made part of [[Power Girl]]'s backstory. He eventually turned up in the present day where his body was taken over by [[Mordru]] and his spirit imprisoned in Gemworld. His spirit was finally released and allowed to go to the afterlife by Power Girl and Hawkgirl, (along with a recently awakened [[Hawk and Dove|Dove II]]), in order to weaken Mordru. Before his soul departed, Arion revealed to Power Girl that she was not his granddaughter and thus not an Atlantean. He cryptically stated to Power Girl that he had promised her mother to protect her, that she was proud of her, and that she would soon need her aid.

===Current status===
{{see also|Infinite Crisis}}
Arion recently reappeared (presumably via magical time travel) in ''Infinite Crisis'' as one of the mystics gathered in [[Atlantis]] to keep [[Spectre (comics)|the Spectre]] at bay, and later in the ''[[Day of Vengeance]]'' tie-in special as one of many magical beings summoned to help rebuild the shattered [[Rock of Eternity]].

The Arion of 1659 also has recently appeared in [[Superman]] #655 where he wasn't pleased with Superman's actions as he looked into the future.
