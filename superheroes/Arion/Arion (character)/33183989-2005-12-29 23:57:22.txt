Arion began as a secondary feature of the DC Comics book [[Warlord (comics)|Warlord]] in issue #55 (March 1982). This continued until the October issue (#62) when Arion gained his own series written by [[Paul Kupperberg]] and drawn by [[Jan Duursema]].  

The title character is a powerful [[magic (paranormal)|mage]] from the nobility of ancient [[Atlantis]].  His companions include an Atlantean guardsman, Wyynde, and Lady Chian, his lover and the captain of King D'Tilluh's royal guard.  Among his enemies are Chaon, the puissant god of evil and chaos, and his brother Garn Daanuth, a formidable [[wizard|practitioner of the dark arts]].  

'''Arion, Lord of Atlantis''' only lasted for 35 regular issues from November [[1982]] to September [[1985]].  There was a special finale issued in late 1985 in which Atlantis was destroyed.  Arion also appeared in [[DC Comics Presents]] November 1984 issue in a crossover with [[Superman]].

He appeared later in the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]] and was made part of [[Power Girl]]'s backstory.  He eventually turned up in the present day continuity of the [[DC Universe]] where his body was taken over by the Lord of Chaos Mordru and his spirit imprisoned in Gemworld. His spirit was finally released and allowed to go to the afterlife by Power Girl and Hawkgirl of the JSA along with a recently awakened Dove in order to weaken Mordru and to give the JSA a chance at fighting back at the Dark Lord and his allies. However before going onto the afterlife, he revealed to Power Girl that she wasn't really his granddaughter or an Atlantean at all and that he was only charged by Power Girl's mother with keeping her safe and that her origin lies elsewhere.

The character and the series in which he have appeared have been recognized by the comics industry with a nomination for the R.A.C. "Squiddy" Award for Favorite Limited Series in 1992 for the mini-series Arion the Immortal.
