==Publication history==
The [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] of [[Counter-Earth (comics)#The High Evolutionary Counter-Earth|Counter-Earth]] first appeared in ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #2 (May 1972), and was created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Gil Kane]].

==Fictional character biography==
Brute is a version of Reed Richards ([[Mister Fantastic]], leader of the [[Fantastic Four]]) from a world created by the [[High Evolutionary]] called [[Counter-Earth (comics)#The High Evolutionary Counter-Earth|Counter-Earth]]. He was exposed to cosmic rays that gave him the ability to transform into a savage purple-skinned behemoth called the Brute. When he becomes the Brute, he possesses [[superhuman]] strength.

The Brute made his way to [[Earth-616]], where he trapped Mister Fantastic in the Negative Zone and replaced him. He infiltrated the Fantastic Four by posing as Mister Fantastic during a time when the other Reed had lost his stretching powers. He managed to trap the Human Torch and the Thing shortly thereafter, but was found out by the Invisible Woman, who rescued her teammates and left the Brute trapped in their place.{{Issue|date=February 2011}} The Brute was later a member of the [[Frightful Four]].{{Issue|date=February 2011}}

==Powers and abilities==
Reed can transform at will into the Brute, who possesses an 8-9' tall form with significant superhuman strength and durability. In addition, he retains the brilliant genius and much of the knowledge of Reed Richards.

At one point he proved able to absorb geothermal energy from the Earth's core, increasing his own power. In such from, he could also fire energy blasts.

==Other version==
The Brute makes an appearance in the tie-in comic, ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited]]''.  In this continuum, a Counter-Earth version of Reed and his friends were exposed to cosmic rays like their Earth counterparts.  Reed became a creature known as The Brute, Sue ended up in a coma and Johnny was dead.  Only Ben was unaffected.  Using his good standing with The High Evolutionary as Reed Richards (who tries to maintain his secret identity by putting up a snobby front), The Brute secretly aids the Counter-Earth rebels against them.  Ben Grimm helps out by gathering data held by The High Evolutionary. <ref>''Spider-Man Unlimited'' Volume 2 #3</ref>
