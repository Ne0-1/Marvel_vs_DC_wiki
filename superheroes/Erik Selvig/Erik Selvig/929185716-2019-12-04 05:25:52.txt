===Feature films===

In ''Thor'', astrophysicist Erik Selvig works with [[Jane Foster (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Jane Foster]], the daughter of a former colleague of his, on her wormhole research. They become involved in an encounter between [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], leading to his employment by the latter to study the [[Infinity Gems#Film|Tesseract]]—he accepts the job due to influence by [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]]. In ''The Avengers'', Loki uses the Tesseract to travel to Earth, and places Selvig under the control of the [[Infinity Gems#Film|Mind Stone]]. Selvig is eventually freed of this control and able to help stop Loki's invasion of Earth, but is left traumatized by his experience. Selvig is able to help Thor again in ''Thor: The Dark World'', and by ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'' appears to have recovered, working at [[Royal Holloway]]. After the defeat of [[Ultron]], Selvig begins working for the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. When Thanos snapped his fingers, and half the universe's population were disintegrated, Selvig was among those who were killed, and were subsequently resurrected by [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]] five years later. In ''[[Spider-Man Far From Home]]'', Selvig is shown to be starring in the documentary ''NOVA: Einstein Rosen Bridges with Dr. Erik Selvig''.

===Tie-in comics===

Selvig appears in the MCU tie-in comics ''[[Fury's Big Week|The Avengers Prelude: Fury's Big Week]]'' and ''Thor: The Dark World Prelude'' in the same capacity as he does in the films.

==Concept and creation==
{{Quote box|quote=I chose ''Thor'' because of [director] [[Kenneth Branagh]] ... I try to pick different films, I go and do those big ones and having done that I can usually afford to go and do some really small obscure films and experiment a little.|source=—Skarsgård's reasoning for joining ''Thor''<ref name="Cheney"/>|width=33%|align=right}}
In October 2009, [[Stellan Skarsgård]] joined the cast of ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'',<ref name="skarsgard" /> which was written by [[Ashley Miller (screenwriter)|Ashley Edward Miller]], [[Zack Stentz]], and [[Don Payne (writer)|Don Payne]];<ref name="ThorScreenwriters" /> Skarsgård signed a five-film deal with Marvel.<ref name="SkarsgardDeal" /> His character Erik Selvig appears in the [[post-credits scene]] at the end of ''Thor'', which was directed by ''The Avengers'' director [[Joss Whedon]]. This set up Selvig's role in that film.<ref name="Hewitt" /> After also appearing in ''Thor: The Dark World'' and ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', Skarsgård noted in February 2015 that he had one more Marvel film in his deal, that he would not be appearing in ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'', and that he possibly could appear in another ''Avengers'' film.<ref name="SkarsgardDeal" /> Although his character didn't actually physically appear in ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', his picture is shown as one of the victims who were killed by Thanos with his actions in ''[[Avengers Infinity War|Avengers: Infinity War]]''.
