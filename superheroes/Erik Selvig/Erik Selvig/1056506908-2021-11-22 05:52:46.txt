==Concept and creation==
{{Quote box|quote=I chose ''Thor'' because of [director] [[Kenneth Branagh]] ...

In October 2009, [[Stellan Skarsgård]] joined the cast of ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'',<ref name="skarsgard" /> which was written by [[Ashley Miller (screenwriter)|Ashley Edward Miller]], [[Zack Stentz]], and [[Don Payne (writer)|Don Payne]];<ref name="ThorScreenwriters" /> Skarsgård signed a five-film deal with Marvel.<ref name="SkarsgardDeal" /> His character Erik Selvig appears in the [[post-credits scene]] at the end of ''Thor'', which was directed by ''The Avengers'' director [[Joss Whedon]]. This set up Selvig's role in that film.<ref name="Hewitt" /> After also appearing in ''Thor: The Dark World'' and ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', Skarsgård noted in February 2015 that he had one more Marvel film in his deal, that he would not be appearing in ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'', and that he possibly could appear in another ''Avengers'' film.<ref name="SkarsgardDeal" /> Although his character didn't actually physically appear in ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', his picture is shown as one of the victims who were killed by Thanos with his actions in ''[[Avengers Infinity War|Avengers: Infinity War]]''.
