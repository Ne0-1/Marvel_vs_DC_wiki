'''Erik Selvig''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], which [[Fictional crossover|crosses over]] several [[Marvel Studios]] [[superhero film]]s. Selvig first appeared in [[Kenneth Branagh]]'s 2011 film ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'', where he was portrayed by Swedish actor [[Stellan Skarsgård]]. Skarsgård then reprised the role in [[Joss Whedon]]'s 2012 film ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'', and the 2013 sequel ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'', directed by [[Alan Taylor (director)|Alan Taylor]]. 

==Appearances==
===Film===
====''Thor''====
{{Main|Thor (film)}}
An old colleague of [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]]'s father, Selvig is working with her to carry out her wormhole research, resulting in him being present when Thor arrives on Earth after his banishment. Having grown up with tales of the Viking myths, Selvig recognizes Thor's 'stories', but assumes that they reflect a delusional mental state even after Jane's assistant speculates that the Norse gods could have been an advanced race who came to Earth. However, he and Thor bond after they spend the night drinking in a bar after he helped Thor escape S.H.I.E.L.D. custody.

It is suggested that Selvig also knows Bruce Banner. In the movie, after SHIELD has taken Jane Foster's equipment, Selvig says that he knew a scientist who was a pioneer in gamma-radiation, but after SHIELD showed up, no one heard from him again.

When Lady [[Sif (Marvel Comics)|Sif]] and the [[Warriors Three]] appear outside Jane's lab, Selvig doesn't understand what is going on until the [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]] appears soon after attacking the town. During the course of the battle, he witnessed the amazing abilities of the Warriors Three and begins to believe Thor's identity. In the midst of the destruction he concedes to following Thor's instructions. Later in the aftermath of Thor's renewal of his powers and reclamation of his [[Mjolnir (comics)|hammer]], Selvig no longer doubts Thor's beliefs or identity. Jane and he travel with Thor and the other Asgardians to the wormhole as they depart from Midgard.

In a post-credits scene, Selvig meets with [[Nick Fury]] and is offered the chance to study the [[Cosmic Cube#Film|Tesseract]], but is already being observed by [[Loki (comics)|Loki]].

====''The Avengers''====
{{Main|The Avengers (2012 film)}}
Currently working for S.H.I.E.L.D. investigating the Tesseract, Selvig comes under Loki's control when Loki emerges from the portal generated by the Tesseract. He subsequently helps Loki devise a device that will allow him to generate a larger portal to bring in a massive invasion fleet to conquer Earth. Even when under Loki's control, Selvig is able to include a means of shutting the portal equipment down using Loki's staff, allowing him to inform [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] just how to shut down the portal during the final battle. He is last seen standing with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] as Thor takes Loki and the Tesseract back to Asgard.

====''Thor: The Dark World''====
{{Main|Thor: The Dark World}}
After the events of ''The Avengers'', Selvig appears to have gone slightly insane. He is seen on the news running round Stonehenge naked with his equipment which leads him to being arrested and taken to the nearest mental institution in the area. Later he was bailed out by Darcy with her intern Ian signing forms of his release. At first he was thinking of giving up his obsession until a portal opened up below the group with a flock of birds flying by at close contact which then leaves Selvig to believe that the people who wouldn't believe him are crazy and purposely throws his perscription medicine in the garbage. Later when Jane and Thor arrived at the appartment and when they brought the news about Loki's death, Selvig felt relieved but when Thor looked at him questioned, he then acts sorry for his loss.

===Comics===
Selvig appears in the Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-in comics "Avengers Prelude: Fury's Big Week" and "Thor The Dark World Prelude". <ref>''Avengers Prelude: Fury's Big Week'' #2</ref>

The script was nice and we got to rehearse and talk to the writers and do some collaborating in the process to make it fit us. So I had a very happy time on it. What I always try to do is immediately do something I just haven't done so I get variation in my life. I've made about 90 films and if I did the same thing over and over again I would be bored by now. I try to pick different films, I go and do those big ones and having done that I can usually afford to go and do some really small obscure films and experiment a little".<ref name=WallStreetJournal>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2010/12/29/stellan-skarsgard-on-thor-the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo-and-swedish-films/ |title=Stellan Skarsgard on 'Thor,' 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,' and Swedish Films | first=Alexandra |last=Cheney |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=December 29, 2010 |accessdate=August 6, 2011| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5zva9rsc5 | archivedate = July 4, 2011| deadurl=no}}</ref>
