'''Erik Selvig''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], which [[Fictional crossover|crosses over]] several [[Marvel Studios]] [[superhero film]]s. Selvig first appeared in ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011), where he was portrayed by Swedish actor [[Stellan Skarsgård]]. Skarsgård then reprised the role in ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012) and ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'' (2013), and will do so again in ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' (2015).

==Concept and creation==
[[Stellan Skarsgård]]'s casting in ''Thor'' was confirmed on October 5, 2009.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cinematical.com/2009/10/05/stellan-skarsgard-joins-thor |title=Stellan Skarsgard Joins 'Thor' |first=Elisabeth |last=Rappe |work=Cinematical |date=October 5, 2009|accessdate=August 6, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chud.com/39039/exclusive-screenwriter-don-payne-talks-thor/|title=Exclusive: Screenwriter Don Payne Talks Thor!| first=Elisabeth |last=Rappe|publisher=CHUD.com|date=February 23, 2011|accessdate=August 6, 2011}}.

The script was nice and we got to rehearse and talk to the writers and do some collaborating in the process to make it fit us. So I had a very happy time on it. What I always try to do is immediately do something I just haven't done so I get variation in my life. I've made about 90 films and if I did the same thing over and over again I would be bored by now. I try to pick different films, I go and do those big ones and having done that I can usually afford to go and do some really small obscure films and experiment a little".<ref name=WallStreetJournal>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2010/12/29/stellan-skarsgard-on-thor-the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo-and-swedish-films/ |title=Stellan Skarsgard on 'Thor,' 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,' and Swedish Films | first=Alexandra |last=Cheney |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=December 29, 2010 |accessdate=August 6, 2011| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5zva9rsc5 | archivedate = July 4, 2011| deadurl=no}}</ref>

{{Main|Thor (film)|The Avengers (2012 film)|Thor: The Dark World|Avengers: Age of Ultron}}
In ''Thor'', an old colleague of [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]]'s father, Selvig is working with her to carry out her wormhole research, resulting in him being present when Thor arrives on Earth after his banishment. Having grown up with tales of the Viking myths, Selvig recognizes Thor's 'stories', but assumes that they reflect a delusional mental state even after Jane's assistant speculates that the Norse gods could have been an advanced race who came to Earth. However, he and Thor bond after they spend the night drinking in a bar after he helps Thor escape S.H.I.E.L.D. custody. It is suggested that Selvig also knows Bruce Banner. In the movie, after S.H.I.E.L.D. has taken Jane Foster's equipment, Selvig says that he knew a scientist who was a pioneer in gamma-radiation, but after S.H.I.E.L.D. showed up, no one heard from him again. When Lady [[Sif (Marvel Comics)|Sif]] and the [[Warriors Three]] appear outside Jane's lab, Selvig doesn't understand what is going on until the [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]] appears soon after attacking the town. During the course of the battle, he witnesses the amazing abilities of the Warriors Three and begins to believe Thor's identity. In the midst of the destruction he accedes to following Thor's instructions. Later, in the aftermath of Thor's renewal of his powers and reclamation of his [[Mjolnir (comics)|hammer]], Selvig no longer doubts Thor's beliefs or identity. Jane and he travel with Thor and the other Asgardians to the wormhole as they depart from Midgard. In a post-credits scene, Selvig meets with [[Nick Fury]] and is offered the chance to study the [[Cosmic Cube#Film|Tesseract]], under the control of [[Loki (comics)|Loki]].

Working for S.H.I.E.L.D. investigating the Tesseract in ''The Avengers'', Selvig comes under Loki's control when Loki emerges from a portal generated by the Tesseract. He subsequently helps Loki devise a device that will allow him to generate a larger portal to bring in a massive Chitauri army to conquer Earth. Even while under Loki's control, Selvig is able to include a means of shutting the portal equipment down using Loki's staff, allowing him to inform [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] just how to shut down the portal during the final battle. He is last seen standing with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] as Thor takes Loki and the Tesseract back to Asgard.

In ''Thor: The Dark World'', following the events of ''The Avengers'', Selvig appears to have gone slightly insane. He is seen on the news running round Stonehenge naked with his equipment, which leads to him being arrested and taken to the nearest mental institution. Later he is bailed out by Darcy, with her intern Ian signing forms for his release. At first, he was thinking of giving up his obsession, until a portal opened up below the group with a flock of birds flying by at close range, leading Selvig to believe that the people who wouldn't believe him are crazy, and he purposely throws his prescription medicine in the garbage. Later, when Jane and Thor arrive at the apartment with the news of Loki's death, Selvig feels relieved, but when Thor looks at him questioningly, he acts sorry for Thor's loss. At the end of the movie, he is present as Thor reunites with Jane on Earth.

Skarsgård will be reprising his role of Selvig in the upcoming film ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]''.<ref>{{cite web |date=October 15, 2011 |title= Stellan Skarsgård 'Erik Selvig' To Return (And Go Nude?)
