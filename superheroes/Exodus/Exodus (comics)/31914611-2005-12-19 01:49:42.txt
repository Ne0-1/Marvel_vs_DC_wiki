'''Exodus''' (Bennet du Paris AKA Paris Bennet) is the name of a fictional comicbook character associated with the [[X-Men]]. He first appeared in ''X-Factor'' #92 and was created by [[Scott Lobdell]] and [[Joe Quesada]].

Originally a [[crusade]]r during the 12th century, the latent mutant power in Bennet du Paris was awakened by [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]].  When du Paris refused to kill his best friend, Eobar Barrington, (really Dane Whitman) the original [[Black Knight (comics)|Black Knight]], Apocalypse put him in suspended animation for thousands of years.

He was found and awakened by [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. Exodus became Magneto's lieutenant in the [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]] and when Magneto's mind was wiped by [[Professor X]], Exodus took command, also caring for the comatose Magneto until they were separated after [[Holocaust (comics)|Holocaust]] destroyed the Acolytes's space station [[Avalon (comics)|Avalon]]. 

Exodus was last seen being sucked into [[Xorn]]'s [[black hole]] after leading the latest incarnation of the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] and attacking the X-Mansion. However, in the [[House of M]] event, he has become the fascist ruler of [[Australia]].


==Powers==
Besides his near invulnerablity, superhuman strength and rapid flight, Exodus possesses vast [[psionic]] powers including [[telekinesis]] above 10 tons, [[teleportation]], incredible [[telepath]]ic powers and the ability to project damaging psionic blasts. He also acts as a sort of psionic [[vampire]], absorbing and stealing psionic energy from those around him. There is some evidence that his power is influenced by the belief of those around him, as when he was with the loyal Acolytes he possessed power far beyond what he currently exhibits.

Exodus' single greatest display of power was simultaneously 
a) taking the Genoshan mutates' hatred of humans and amplifying it, making them fight more 
b) crushing all of Genosha under a force field 
c) trapping Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch, Crystal and Jean Grey in another force field, while 
d) preventing them from moving or using their powers 
e) protecting himself from all attacks and 
f) putting a beating on the X-Men AND the Avengers.
