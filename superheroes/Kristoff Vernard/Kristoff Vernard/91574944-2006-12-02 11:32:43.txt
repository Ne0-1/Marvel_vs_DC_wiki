'''Kristoff Vernard''' (once '''Kristoff von Doom''') is a [[fictional character]] appearing in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. Kristoff first appeared in [[John Byrne]]'s "back to the basics" [[Fantastic Four]] run in issue #247 in October 1982.  Kristoff served heir to Doom, occasional ruler of Latveria, a probational member of the Fantastic Four, and temporal adventurer along-side Nathaniel Richards.

==Fictional character biography==
===The Heir===
After being ousted as leader of Latveria, Dr.Doom and the Fantastic Four returned to the country to overthrow its leader Zorba.  Doom met the young Kristoff and his mother. Both still were loyal to Doom, and so the former dictator placed the two under his protection. However, Kristoff's mother was killed by a robot of Zorba's.  After destroying the robot and defeated Zorba, Dr. Doom adopted Kristoff as his heir and took him to live in [[Castle Doom]].

===The Second Coming of Doom===
Following the apparent death of Dr. Doom by [[Terrax]], the true conditions of being heir to Doom went into effect, as Kristoff was taken by Doom's robots and brainwashed (implanted with full and detailed memories from the late ruler).  Kristoff believed he was the real Doom. Dr. Doom II's first action was to destroy the Fanastic Four by blowing up the [[Baxter Building]], a plan drawn from memories of the real Dr. Doom's plot to kill the FF while he was teamed with the [[Namor the Sub-Mariner|Sub-Mariner]].  The FF survived the explosion thanks to the force fields of [[Invisible Woman|Sue Richards]], and quickly traveled to the Doomstadt and defeated their adversary.  To the teams surprise, the armor held not Doom, but a child, whom the team took with them. 

Kristoff would be imprisoned in the [[Four Freedoms Plaza]], the new home of the Four, following his destruction of the Baxter Building.  The boy would free himself with aid of a [[Doombot]] sent to kidnap [[Franklin Richards]], by the recently resurrected Dr. Doom.  Dr. Doom sought to use the child in a battle against [[Mephisto]].  Kristoff reclaimed his armour and challenged who he thought to be an impostor.  As the two Dooms battled the Doombots standing ready unsure which to aid, Dr. Doom expressed his initial doubts of using Franklin in a battle against the demon, which the robots perceived as doubt and a lack of confidence meaning Kristoff could only be the real ever-confident Dr. Doom.  The Doombots turn on their creator and Dr. Doom was overthrown again.

Kristoff would rule as Doom, until the original infiltrated the Castle and uttered a codeword that reverted Kristoff to his original personality.  Doom reclaimed his throne and Kristoff was placed in stasis in a Tibetan Monastery.

===Life After Doom===
Kristoff would be revived by Nathaniel Richards, while he was looking for Boris, Doom's former guardian, who was in actuality the [[Tomorrow Man]] in disguise.  The former dictator would return with Richards and the Invisible Woman, where he would become a closely monitored member of the Fantastic Four (and close friends with [[Cassandra Lang]],  but he eventually took his leave from this group with Nathaniel Richards.

Following the Onslaught saga, Kristoff and Richards tried to collect the equipment located in the [[Negative Zone]] of the missing FF. They then returned to Latveria, Kristoff with hopes of assuming the throne once again, but they were met with resistance by the [[Dreadknight]].

Kristoff was last seen when both he and Richards were displace by [[Stryfe]] after his ship crashed into Castle Doom.

==Other Appearances==
===House of M===
{{main|House of M}}
Kristoff was a member of Doom's Fantastic Four, as the '''InHuman Torch'''.  In the crafted world, Kristoff was the adopted son of Valeria and Doom, and thanks to the cosmic experimentation of his adoptive father, had the abilities of Johnny Storm.  

===2099===
{{main|Doom 2099}}
There was some speculation due the character's memory lapses and vague beginnings, that the "Doom" of Earth 928 ([[Marvel 2099|2099 Universe]]) was not Victor Von Doom, but rather Kristoff Von Doom.

===MC2===

In the [[MC2]] universe, Kristoff appears as a member of the [[Fantastic Five]].
