'''Dinah Soar''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Universe]]. 

==Fictional character biography==
'''Dinah Soar''', born in the [[Savage Land]], had an unknown origin: either alien or mutant. 

Because she never spoke English, her background remained entirely unknown, but she became a member of the [[Great Lakes Avengers]] when [[Mr. Immortal]] first assembled the team. She is shown utilizing the ability to calm Mr. Immortal when he becomes overwhelmed with stress and rage. She follows along in many, seemingly failed, exploits, until killed by [[Maelstrom (comics)|Maelstrom]] in a battle.

Her death plunges Mr. Immortal, who was her boyfriend at that time, into a deep depression. Later, however, he manages to snap out of when he had the opportunity to pay back [[Deathurge]], who had been taking away the souls of his loved ones away right before his eyes, in kind.

==Powers and abilities==
As a result of extensive training, Dinah Soar used her wings for the ability of flight and good maneuverability. Razor tips on her wings made for efficient weapons in battle, and she appeared to have sonic powers, using sound as an energy force. She also stated that her race is apparently ageless.

==Name==
The name "Dinah Soar" is an obvious reference to "dinosaur," matching her appearance. It may also be a reference to the cancelled [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar]] project (1957â€“1963), which was an early attempt to design a [[Spaceplane|space shuttle]], or to TV personality [[Dinah Shore]].
