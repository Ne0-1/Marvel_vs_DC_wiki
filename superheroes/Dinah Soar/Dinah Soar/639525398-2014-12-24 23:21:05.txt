'''Dinah Soar''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[superheroine]] in the [[Marvel Universe]]. She was created by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] and first appeared in ''[[West Coast Avengers]]'' (Vol. 2) #46 (July 1989).

==Fictional character biography==
'''Dinah Soar''' was born in the [[Savage Land]]. Her lineage is never revealed and it is unknown if she was actually a mutant or of alien descent.

Because she never spoke English, her background remains entirely unknown, but she became a founding member of the [[Great Lakes Avengers]] when [[Mr. Immortal]] first assembled the team.<ref>Seen in flashback in ''GLA: Misassembled'' #1â€“4 (2005)</ref> She is shown utilizing the ability to calm Mr. Immortal when he becomes overwhelmed with stress and rage. Because they found out that they are soulmates, the two soon became romantically involved as well.

Dinah Soar follows Mr. Immortal along in many, seemingly failed, exploits, until killed by [[Maelstrom (comics)|Maelstrom]] in a battle.<ref>''G.L.A.'' #1</ref> Her death plunges Mr. Immortal into a deep depression. Later, however, he manages to snap out of it when he had the opportunity to pay back [[Deathurge]], who had been taking away the souls of his loved ones away right before his eyes, in kind.<ref>''G.L.A.'' #4</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
As a result of extensive training, Dinah Soar used her wings for the ability of flight and good maneuverability. Razor tips on her wings are made for efficient weapons in battle, and she appeared to have sonic powers, using sound as an energy force, and the ability to calm Mr. Immortal via empathy after he returned to life. She also stated that her race is apparently ageless.<ref>''G.L.A.'' #1</ref>

==Name==
In keeping with the tongue-in-cheek, comic relief theme of the [[Great Lakes Avengers|GLA/GLX/GLC/GLI]], the name "Dinah Soar" is a reference to her depiction as a [[pterosaur|pterodactyl]] with a human female face.{{Or|date=September 2010}}
