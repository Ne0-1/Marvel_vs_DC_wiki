'''Dinah Soar''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Universe]]. 

==Fictional character biography==
'''Dinah Soar''', born in the [[Savage Land]], had an unknown origin: either alien or mutant. 

Because she never spoke English, her background remained entirely unkown, but she became a member of the [[Great Lakes Avengers]] when [[Mr. Immortal]] first assembled the team.  She followed along in many, seemingly failed, exploits, until killed by [[Maelstrom]] in a battle.  Her death plunged Mr. Immortal into a deep depression, spending his days downloading the [[soundtrack]] to the movie ''[[Magnolia (film)|Magnolia]]''.

== Powers and abilities ==

As a result of extensive training, Dinah Soar used her wings for the ability of flight and good manueverability. Razor tips on her wings made for efficient weapons in battle, and she appeared to have sonic powers, using sound as an energy force.
