'''Gideon Mace''' is a fictional villain in the [[Marvel Comics Universe]].

=='''History'''==
Colonel Gideon Mace, veteran of several wars, felt his superiors were weak, unwilling to make necessary sacrifices, He led his men on an unauthorized assault against an enemy village, during which a mine destroyed Mace's right hand, and he was dishonorably discharged on the orders of General William Westmoorland for insubordination, mental incompetence, and suspicion of combat activity independent of orders.  An enraged Mace replaced his lost appendage with a spiked mace, training relentlessly until he could use it effortlessly.  He recruited ex-soldiers loyal to him, forming his own private army, and depleting his family's fortune to bankroll them.  Needing financing, he arranged Operation Overpower, enlisting disgruntled veterans who felt abandoned by America.  Mace told the veterans they would paralyze [[Manhattan]] for a day by bloodlessly seizing control of strategic points throughout the city; in truth Mace intended them to be decoys, diverting police away from Wall Street while his elite troops looted it.  One veteran, Owen Ridgely, learned of Mace's true goals and, pursued by Mace's killers, sought help from [[Luke Cage, Hero for Hire]].  Unable to prevent Ridgely's murder, Luke found and attacked Mace's base.  Finding Cage unstoppable, Mace fled in a helicopter, but Cage caused it to crash into the [[Hudson River]].  Narrowly avoiding drowning by unscrewing his heavy mace, Gideon established Security City, an isolated planned community where paranoid ultra-conservatives could live behind barbed wire and armed guards away from the rest of America.  Mace manipulated the residents, training them to follow him unconditionally and ultimately to become his personal army.  The arrival of Luke Cage and his friend "DW" Griffith -- whose bus had been shot off the road by Security City personnel for straying too close -- proved Mace's downfall.  DW covertly rewired a sound system, allowing the townspeople to hear Mace's plans, sparking a riot.

Evading capture, Mace learned the [[U.S. Army]] had lost a cobalt bomb in [[Bermuda]], and plotted to bluff the authorities into handing over [[Chicago]] to him by claiming he had recovered the weapon and would detonate it, forcing an evacuation of the area.  Cage's untimely intervention once again disrupted things, as Cage worked with Burgandy -- a former agent of Mace's who turned against him after learning her husband had died in Mace's unauthorized mission -- to expose Mace's farce.  Mace next convinced various illicit organizations, such as the Maggia and Halwani Freedom Front, to fund him in targeting and murdering costumed heroes.  He chose the low-powered hero the [[White Tiger (Hector Ayala)|White Tiger]] (Hector Ayala), whose identity had been exposed on television, as his first target, murdering most of Ayala's immediate family to lure the hero into his trap, then gunning him down.  Mace's men dumped the dying youth out of a speeding car outside the [[Daily Bugle]] offices, coincidentally in front of photographer Peter Parker, secretly [[Spider-Man]] and a friend of Hector's.  Spider-Man hunted Mace down, finding him in a [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] armory plotting further to slay [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], Cage and other unidentified heroes.  The hero evaded both booby traps and Mace's men, confronted Mace and overpowered him; when Mace's guards approached, Spider-Man used the pinned villain as a shield, expecting them to hold their fire, but Mace ordered them to shoot anyway.  Spider-Man ducked multiple shots which cut through Mace, swiftly disarmed the guards, and rushed Mace to a hospital.  It is unconfirmed whether he survived or not.
