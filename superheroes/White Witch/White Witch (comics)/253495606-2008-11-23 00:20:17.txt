The '''White Witch''' is a [[Fictional character|fictional]] [[comic book]] character who exists in the [[DC Universe]], a member of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] in the [[30th century]]. Her real name is Mysa Nal, although her name was given as Xola Aq in [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] Legion stories in [[Adventure Comics]]; the revelation that her name was actually Mysa Nal was a later [[retcon]]. She is the sister of fellow Legionnaire [[Dream Girl]] and daughter of former High Seer of [[Naltor]] Kiwa Nal. Like Dream Girl, she is a native of the planet Naltor, where nearly everyone has the power of [[precognition]]; however, unlike most Naltorians, Mysa cannot foresee the future.

==Fictional History==
To compensate for her inability to see the future, Mysa trained in the mystic arts on the planet [[Zerox]], known as the 'Sorcerer's World', becoming an accomplished [[sorceress]]. Mysa showed a remarkable aptitude for magic.  She easily excelled in her studies--much to the chagrin of the envious Mordru.  Originally, she had red hair, but as she trained in magic, her hair and skin became chalk white and her eyes bright red. This change happened gradually after Dream Girl freed her from the "Hag" guise.

She first appeared in ''Adventure Comics'' #350 as the Hag, an apparently ancient magic user and an agent of the villainous [[Prince Evillo]]. When the Legion fought Evillo, two mysterious "new" members, "Sir Prize" and "Miss Terious", (actually [[Star Boy]] and Dream Girl) cast a spell that restored her to her true form. It was later revealed that this transformation had been worked by the villainous wizard [[Mordru]].

She joined the Legion after helping them defeat [[Darkseid]] in the famous Legion story, the [[Great Darkness Saga]]. Mysa proved herself a valuable member, often coming to member's aid with a handy spell or two.  One feature that set the White Witch apart from the typical comic book sorcerer was a specific limitation on her spell-casting ability:  she could only memorize a few spells at a time.  Unlike characters like Dr. Strange or Dr. Fate, Mysa required study before casting a spell.  Furthermore, she could only commit a few to memory at a time. 

The White Witch played a prominent part in the so-called "Magic War", which concluded volume 2 of the "Legion of Superheroes".  

Some years later, after leaving the Legion, she married the presumedly-reformed Mordru and lived with him on the planet Tharn, which was, at that point, subdued and invaded by Mordru's magics. She was subjected to mystical imprisonment and manipulation during this period until the Legionnaires returned looking for her and their comrade [[Rond Vidar]]. It was this incarnation of the Legion's near defeat that led Mysa to take up arms against her husband, and she later rejoined the group. Right before [[Zero Hour]], she was de-aged by Glorith to a teenager and appeared happy with the change. She assumed the codename Jewel and went underground with her fellow Legionnaires.

===Reboot version===
In post-[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]] continuity, Mysa was no longer Dream Girl's sister from Naltor, but rather, the daughter of Mordru. 

The only survivor of a group of sorcerers who imprisoned Mordru, she spent a century preparing for his return, including planting the seeds for [[Kinetix|Zoe Saugin]]'s powers and manipulating much of the girl's life to make her an ally against Mordru's next rise. After Mordru rose again, Mysa (who resembled the pre-boot Hag at this point) was reverted to the age at which she first defeated him and helped the Legion imprison him once more.

Mysa settled on Sorcerer's World and fell in love with [[Dragonmage]]. Mysa was also a physical vessel for the disembodied soul of [[Amethyst (comics)|Amethyst]], one of the [[Lords of Order]] who is currently active in the present day DC Universe.  {{Fact|date=October 2008}}

===Threeboot version===
Post-[[Threeboot]], White Witch has appeared as a member of [[Lightning Lord|Mekt Ranzz]]'s [[Wanderers (comics)|Wanderers]]. Her home planet is listed as "unknown".

===Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes===
In ''[[Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' storyarc, featuring a group of Legionnaires based on the original, pre-Crisis incarnation, [[Spider Girl]] traded Mysa to [[Mordru]] in return for not attacking Earth. At the conclusion of the story , [[Wildfire (comics)|Wildfire]] comments to [[Superman]] that [[Dawnstar]] has a lock on Mysa's location, while [[Chameleon Girl]] assures [[Superman]] that the Legion will find their remaining lost teammates.

In ''DC Universe'' #0, Mysa is seen conducting a seance with Brainiac 5 and Phantom Girl, trying to make contact with someone. The seance, shown in the ''[[Legion of Three Worlds]]'' story-arc is revealed to be part of a spell to contact and teleport in the former headquarters of the [[Justice League]] the three iterations of the Legion shown during the years. Although the seance is a success, Mysa, still weak after her long imprisonment, is left physically strained.

==In Other Media==
The White Witch appeared in the [[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)|Legion of Super-Heroes]] episode ''Trials'', not as a Legionnaire, but as an illusionary/holographic guide within an enchanted bracelet. She would direct the banished wizard Zyx in his attempt to regain his magic through certain trials. She was voiced by [[Lauren Tom]].
