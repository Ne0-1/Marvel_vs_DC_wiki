The '''White Witch''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[DC Universe]], a member of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] in the thirtieth century. Her real name is Mysa Nal, although her name was given as Xola Aq in [[Silver Age]] Legion stories in [[Adventure Comics]], the revelation that her name was actually Mysa Nal was a later [[retcon]]. She is the sister of fellow Legionnaire [[Dream Girl]] and daughter of former High Seer of [[Naltor]], Kiwa Nal. Like Dream Girl she is a native of the planet Naltor, where nearly everyone has the power of [[precognition]], however unlike most Naltorians Mysa cannot forsee the future.

To compensate for her inability to see the future, Mysa trained in the mystic arts on the planet Zerox known as the 'Sorcerer's World', becoming an accomplished [[sorceress]]. Originally she had red hair, but as she trained in magic, her hair and skin became chalk white and her eyes bright red. She joined the Legion after helping them defeat [[Darkseid]] in the famous Legion story, the [[Great Darkness Saga]]. Some years later after leaving the Legion she married the presumedly-reformed Legion villain [[Mordru]] and even later still rejoined the Legion after leaving him and helping the Legion to defeat him once again.

In post-[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]] continuity, Mysa is no longer Dream Girl's sister, instead she is the daughter of [[Mordru]] and is not from Naltor.
