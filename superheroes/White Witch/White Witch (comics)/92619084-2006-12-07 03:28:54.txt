The '''White Witch''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[DC Universe]], a member of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] in the [[30th century]]. Her real name is Mysa Nal, although her name was given as Xola Aq in [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] Legion stories in [[Adventure Comics]], the revelation that her name was actually Mysa Nal was a later [[retcon]]. She is the sister of fellow Legionnaire [[Dream Girl]] and daughter of former High Seer of [[Naltor]], Kiwa Nal. Like Dream Girl she is a native of the planet Naltor, where nearly everyone has the power of [[precognition]], however unlike most Naltorians Mysa cannot foresee the future.

To compensate for her inability to see the future, Mysa trained in the mystic arts on the planet Zerox known as the 'Sorcerer's World', becoming an accomplished [[sorceress]]. Originally she had red hair, but as she trained in magic, her hair and skin became chalk white and her eyes bright red. She joined the Legion after helping them defeat [[Darkseid]] in the famous Legion story, the [[Great Darkness Saga]]. Some years later after leaving the Legion she married the presumedly-reformed villain [[Mordru]] and lived with him on the planet Tharn, at that point subdued and invaded by Mordru's magics. She was subjected to mystical imprisonment and manipulation during this period until the Legionnaires returned, looking for her and their comrade [[Rond Vidar]]. It was this incarnation of the Legion's near defeat that led Mysa to take up arms against her husband, and she later rejoined the group.

In post-[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]] continuity, Mysa was no longer Dream Girl's sister, but rather the daughter of [[Mordru]] and is not from Naltor; instead, she was cursed into the Hag's shape and spent many years in exile on the Sorcerer's World, leaving only to make herself integral to her one-day catspaw, [[Kinetix]]; she planted the seeds for Zoe Saugin's powers and manipulated much of the girl's life to make her an ally against Mordru's next rise. After Mordru rose this time, Mysa was returned to her true age and fell in love with [[Dragonmage]]. Mysa was also a physical vessel for the disembodied soul of [[Amethyst (comics)|Amethyst]], one of the [[Lords of Order]] who is currently active in the present day DC Universe.
