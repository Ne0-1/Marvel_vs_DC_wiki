The '''White Witch''' is a [[Fictional character|fictional]] [[comic book]] character who exists in the [[DC Universe]], a member of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] in the [[30th century]]. Her real name is Mysa Nal, although her name was given as Xola Aq in [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] Legion stories in [[Adventure Comics]]; the revelation that her name was actually Mysa Nal was a later [[retcon]]. She is the sister of fellow Legionnaire [[Dream Girl]] and daughter of former High Seer of [[Naltor]] Kiwa Nal. Like Dream Girl, she is a native of the planet Naltor, where nearly everyone has the power of [[precognition]]; however, unlike most Naltorians, Mysa cannot foresee the future.

==Fictional History==
To compensate for her inability to see the future, Mysa trained in the mystic arts on the planet [[Zerox]], known as the 'Sorcerer's World', becoming an accomplished [[sorceress]]. Originally, she had red hair, but as she trained in magic, her hair and skin became chalk white and her eyes bright red. 

She first appeared in ''Adventure Comics'' #350 as the Hag, an apparently ancient magic user and an agent of the villainous [[Prince Evillo]]. When the Legion fought Evillo, two mysterious "new" members (actually [[Star Boy]] and Dream Girl) cast a spell that restored her to her true form. It was later revealed that this transformation had been worked by the villainous wizard [[Mordru]].

She joined the Legion after helping them defeat [[Darkseid]] in the famous Legion story, the [[Great Darkness Saga]]. Some years later, after leaving the Legion, she married the presumedly-reformed Mordru and lived with him on the planet Tharn, which was, at that point, subdued and invaded by Mordru's magics. She was subjected to mystical imprisonment and manipulation during this period until the Legionnaires returned looking for her and their comrade [[Rond Vidar]]. It was this incarnation of the Legion's near defeat that led Mysa to take up arms against her husband, and she later rejoined the group. Right before [[Zero Hour]], she was de-aged by Glorith to a teenager and appeared happy with the change. She assumed the codename Jewel and went underground with her fellow Legionnaires.

===Reboot version===
In post-[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]] continuity, Mysa was no longer Dream Girl's sister from Naltor, but rather, the daughter of Mordru. 

The only survivor of a group of sorcerers who imprisoned Mordru, she spent a century preparing for his return, including planting the seeds for [[Kinetix|Zoe Saugin]]'s powers and manipulating much of the girl's life to make her an ally against Mordru's next rise. After Mordru rose again, Mysa (who resembled the pre-boot Hag at this point) was reverted to the age at which she first defeated him and helped the Legion imprison him once more.

Mysa settled on Sorcerer's World and fell in love with [[Dragonmage]]. Mysa was also a physical vessel for the disembodied soul of [[Amethyst (comics)|Amethyst]], one of the [[Lords of Order]] who is currently active in the present day DC Universe.

===Threeboot version===
Post-Threeboot, White Witch has appeared as a member of [[Lightning Lord|Mekt Ranzz]]'s [[Wanderers (comics)|Wanderers]]. Her home planet is listed as "unknown".
