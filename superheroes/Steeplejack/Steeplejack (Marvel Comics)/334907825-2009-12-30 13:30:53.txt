===Publication history===
The first Steeplejack appeared in ''Luke Cage, Power Man'' #18 (April 1974), and was created by [[Len Wein]] and [[George Tuska]].

===Fictional character biography===
Jack Mallard was the first criminal to go by the name Steeplejack. He was a construction worker, and he and his two brothers were employed by contractor Maxwell Plumm. As Plumm unethically cut corners and safety and materials, Mallard's two brothers fell to their deaths when a girder slipped its cable in a sudden wind. He blamed Plumm and vowed vengeance, becoming the first '''Steeplejack'''.  He attacked Plumm and was about to hurl him to his death from a construction site, when [[Luke Cage|Power Man]] intervened. Steeplejack fought Cage, and then hurled Plumm from the building, and fled. Cage saved Plumm, who swiftly agreed to hire Cage for protection.

That night, Steeplejack returned to the construction site to sabotage it, and Power Man emerged from hiding to battle Steeplejack. During the fight, Steeplejack fell on one of the girders he had weakened, and it gave with the impact. Mallard plunged several stories towards the street, and the impact caused his fuel tanks to explode, apparently killing him.<ref>''Luke Cage, Power Man'' #18 (April 1974)</ref>
