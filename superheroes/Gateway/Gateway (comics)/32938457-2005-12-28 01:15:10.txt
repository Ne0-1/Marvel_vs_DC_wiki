Gateway is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|Universe]], a [[mutant (fictional)#Marvel Comics|mutant]] with the ability to [[Teleportation|teleport]] objects and people from one location to another. He is considered an unofficial member of the [[X-Men]].

==Biography==
Much of Gateway's past remains a mystery to this day, including where exactly he was born and even his name. It is known that he is an [[Australian Aborigine|Aborigine]] who appears to have grown up in the [[Outback]]. 

It is known that he was forced to join the criminal group known as the [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]] after they discovered his powers and threatened to destroy a place sacred to the Aborigines if he didn't follow their orders. They called him 'Gateway' in reference to his ability to create gateways between two points in space. Some time later, the X-Men battled the Reavers in their own headquarters.  One of the Reavers, [[Skullcrusher]], told Gateway that he would release him of all his obligations to them if he helped them escape, which he in turn did.

Afterward, the X-Men took up residence in the Reaver's former hideout, and Gateway began voluntarily using his powers to assist them. Since he seemed to be unable or unwilling to speak, [[Psylocke]] used her telepathic powers to communicate to Gateway where the X-Men wished to go. However, when the X-Men went back to the United States, he soon returned to Australia.

More recently, he appeared at the [[Xavier Institute]] in Massachusetts, where [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]] was training, with a young girl. When he encountered [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], he simply spoke her name, "[[Penance (comics)|Penance]]", and disappeared. This may have something to do with his feelings of guilt over his part in the downfall of the [[Hellions]].
