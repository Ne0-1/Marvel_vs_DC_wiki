==Publication history==

==Fictional character biography==
Much of Gateway's past remains a mystery to this day, including where exactly he was born and even his name. It is known that he is an [[Australian Aborigine|Aboriginal]] who appears to have grown up in the [[Outback]].

It is known that he was forced to join the criminal group known as the [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]] after they discovered his powers and threatened to destroy a place sacred to the Aborigines if he didn't follow their orders.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #229</ref> They called him "Gateway" in reference to his ability to create gateways between two points in space. Some time later, the [[X-Men]], who had been believed by the world to have been killed in [[Dallas, Texas]], appeared in the Outback and battled the Reavers in their own headquarters.  One of the Reavers, [[Skullbuster (comics)|Skullbuster]], in attempting to escape the fracas, told Gateway that he would release him of all his obligations to them if he helped them escape, which Gateway did.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #229</ref>

Afterward, the X-Men took up residence in the Reavers' former hideout, and Gateway began voluntarily using his powers to assist them.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #230</ref> Since he seemed to be unable or unwilling to speak, [[Psylocke]] used her telepathic powers to communicate to Gateway where the X-Men wished to go. However, the X-Men eventually went back to the United States, and were discovered by the rest of the world to be alive, and Gateway's close association with them ended.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

More recently, he appeared at the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]] in Massachusetts, where [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]] was training, with a young girl. When he encountered [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], he simply spoke the word, "[[Penance (X-Men)|Penance]]", which was assumed to be the girl's name.<ref>''Generation X'' #1</ref> Gateway would continue to appear sporadically around Generation X for some time, often in the presence of the fused [[M-Twins|St. Croix twins Nicole and Claudette]], with whom he apparently had a teacher-student relationship.<ref>''Generation X'' #1-2, 5, 7</ref>

Gateway appeared briefly to [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm's]] X-Treme X-Men team, shortly after the death of [[Psylocke]], and revealed that he is the ancestor of [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] and [[Shard (comics)|Shard]].<ref>''X-Treme X-Men'' #4</ref>

What he has been doing since then is largely unknown, but he has been revealed to be one of the mutants to have retained his powers after the [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].<ref>''X-Men: The 198 Files''</ref>

It is revealed to [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] and [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] that Gateway was one of the targeted mutants<ref>''X-Men'' #202</ref> the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]] were killing, along with [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], [[Vargas (comics)|Vargas]] and [[Witness (comics)|The Witness]] due to his powers giving him the ability to see into the future. The Marauders are later seen reporting to Mister Sinister to have killed Gateway, the Witness and Vargas.<ref>''X-Men'' #200</ref>

In ''Secret Warriors'' #4 it is revealed Gateway survived the assassination attempt and now is the teacher of [[Eden Fesi]], a young man with the power to manipulate reality itself.<ref>''Secret Warriors'' #4</ref>

In Uncanny X-Force #27, Fantomex is murdered by Skinless Man and this severs the connection between him and Ultimaton, the guardian Weapon XV who watched over The World and helped raise Evan. Ultimaton returns to his basic sentinel programming to kill all mutants and snaps Gateway's neck before exploding into a nuclear inferno, destroying Cavern X.

==Powers and abilities==

Gateway is a mutant with teleportation and psychic abilities.

Gateway creates wormholes which allow travel through space, time and dimensions.  He opens these gateways by whirling his [[Bullroarer (music)|bullroarer]] over his head.  The role the bullroarer play in the creation and functioning of the gateways is unclear. The gateways can be used for both observation and transport.  No limits have been shown to Gateway's teleportational range or the mass he can transport. He has, for example, transported the X-Men from Australia to the United States and back using his powers, as well as transporting them trans-dimensionally to another Earth{{Issue|date=May 2009}}. He also opened up gateways that observe past events, such as the one that allowed the feral X-Man Wolverine and the ninja named Elektra to learn the truth behind the powerful psionic being known as Onslaught.<ref>''Wolverine v2'' #104</ref> He has transported Wolverine to the past, 1937 Spain, and returned him to the present.<ref>"Wolverine v2" #35</ref>

Gateway also possesses psionic abilities that allow him to communicate with telepaths{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}. Gateway apparently prefers this method of communication over the verbal method, having spoken out loud only twice during his association with the X-Men. It was this ability that allowed him to communicate with the X-Man Psylocke to ascertain where and when the X-Men wished to be teleported, as well as knowing when they wished to return or what their exact location was at the time they wished to come back{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}. Gateway also once spoke to the telepathic Generation X member [[Chamber (comics)|Chamber]] psionically,<ref>''Generation X'' #5</ref> as well as regularly communicating psionically with the [[M-Twins|St. Croix twins]], then disguised as their older sister [[M (comics)|M]].<ref>''Generation X'' #1, 7</ref>

It has also been implied that he possesses total recall or [[eidetic memory]], as it was revealed in the alternate timeline of the [[Age of Apocalypse]] that his time-space manipulating powers allow him to be virtually omniscient, as he is described<ref>''Age of Apocalypse:Weapon X'' #3</ref> as "the repository of the knowledge of humanity, the living index of every hard earned scrap of information gleaned in our ascent from mindless savagery."

Gateway is skilled in wilderness survival and the lore of his people.

==Other versions==

===Age of Apocalypse===
In the [[Age of Apocalypse]], Gateway spends most of his time on [[Wundagore|Wundagore Mountain]], trying to physically absorb any and all knowledge in audio-visual format from hundreds of televisions and computers using his powers to slow time and warp space before the forces of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] destroy everything. [[Wolverine (comics)|Weapon X]] travels to Gateway's home to recruit him in the effort to deliver a crushing blow to Apocalypse's North American forces. Gateway, who is very talkative in this reality, agrees to listen after his bodyguard, [[Carol Danvers]], sacrifices herself in a battle against [[Donald Pierce]].<ref>''Weapon X'' #3, 1995</ref> Gateway finally agrees to lead the attack force when he is confronted with the holographic image of a dying sixteen year old victim of one of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse's]] Infinites.<ref>''Weapon X'' #4, 1995</ref> He was later captured and imprisoned in the mysterious floating city known only as The Sky.<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'' #12</ref> Gateway was eventually rescued by the combined efforts of the Amazing X-Men and the Uncanny X-Force team but is later reported by the AoA version of [[William Stryker]] to have been killed in action.
