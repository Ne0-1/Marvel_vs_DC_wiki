'''Red Skull''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain]] who is the principal enemy of [[Captain America]]. The character's first modern appearance was in ''Tales of Suspense'' #66, although it should be noted that the Red Skull was impersonated by a Nazi agent, John Maxon in ''Tales of Suspense'' #65 (via [[retcon]]).

==Character biography / Publication history==
The Red Skull, Johann Schmidt, was a former Nazi general officer and confidante of [[Adolf Hitler]]. He has been closely affiliated with [[HYDRA]] and is an enemy of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], The [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], and the interests of the [[United States of America]] and of the free world in general. He was physically augmented by having his mind put in the body of a [[cloning|clone]] of Captain America; giving him a body that is the pinnacle of human perfection. He has been seemingly killed in the past only to return to plague the world with schemes of world domination and genocide, time and time again.
===World War II Era===
Chronologically, the first Red Skull to appear in the 1940s comics was George Maxon, an American businessman and [[Nazi]] agent who led a ring of spies and saboteurs. He faced Captain America during two of the latter's first missions. A formidable opponent in his own right, Maxon was killed during the last encounter.  However, in the later [[Silver age of comic books|Silver Age]] period issues writers decided that Maxon had simply been a decoy for another Red Skull who was still living, named Johann Schmidt. This Red Skull, through [[retcon]]ning, would now be considered the earliest Red Skull according to the continuing stories. This led to the Maxon incarnation of the Red Skull being sometimes labelled as the '''Red Skull II''' and the Schmidt (a character which appeared chonologically later in the books) as the '''Red Skull I'''.

As with many supervillains, Johann Schmidt had a traumatic childhood that warped his mind paving the way for villainy in his adult life. Schmidt's mother died in childbirth and his father blamed Johann for it and tried to murder him, only to be stopped by the attending doctor. The father later committed suicide and Johann was orphaned. He grew up on the streets struggling to survive and his hatred of humanity grew with each day. A key episode was when he fell for a local [[Jewish]] girl, but when she spurned his clumsy advances, he murdered her. With that, his depravity grew still more.

In his late teens during the rise of the [[Third Reich]], Schmidt got his most prosperous job, a bellhop in a major hotel. There he served the rooms of [[Adolf Hitler]] himself. By chance, he was present when Hitler was furiously berating an officer and swore he could train Johann himself, a simple bellhop, to be a better National Socialist. Looking closely at him and sensing his dark inner nature, Hitler decided to take up the challenge and recruited Schmidt. 

Dissatisfied with the standard drill instruction his subordinates used to train Schmidt, Hitler took over personally. Upon completion, Hitler gave Schmidt an unique uniform with a grotesque red [[skull]] mask, and he emerged as the Red Skull for the first time. His role was the embodiment of Nazi intimidation, while Hitler could remain the popular leader of Germany. To that end, The Red Skull was appointed head of Nazi [[terrorist]] activities with an additional large role in external [[espionage]] and [[sabotage]]. To the end, he was spectacularly successful, wreaking havoc throughout Europe in the early stages of [[World War II]]. The [[propaganda]] effect was so great that the United States government decided to counter it by creating their own equivalent using the one recipient of the lost Project Rebirth, Steve Rogers, as [[Captain America]].

The two counterparts soon clashed in what would be a series of engagements throughout the war, ending with a final battle that left the Skull buried under the rubble of a bombed building. Because he was immediately exposed to an experimental gas there, he remained in [[suspended animation]] for decades.

===Post-World War II Era===
With Schmidt's disappearance after 1945, the reputation of the Skull still was formidable enough to prove useful. In 1953 a Communist agent named '''Albert Malik''' set up his spy/criminal organization in [[Algeria]] and assumed the identity of the Red Skull, pretending that he was the original, when he was actually serving Soviet interests. During the 1950s he faced the then active version of Captain America who was also using the identity of Steve Rogers, pretending to be the original. The two impersonators continued to battle each other throughout the decade. But while the Captain, referred to as Captain America IV in some sources, was placed into suspended animation when his flawed replicate of the Super Soldier treatment seriously affected his mind, Albert continued his activities, over time cutting his links to the Soviet Union. He was among other things responsible for the deaths of Richard Parker and Mary Fitzpatrick-Parker, the parents of Peter Parker (a.k.a. [[Spider-Man]]), tipped off by the super-criminal Gustav "The Gentleman" Fiers.

===Modern Era===
Johann was eventually rescued in modern times by the terrorist organization, [[HYDRA]]. The Skull quickly subverted a cell to his own ambitions of world conquest and the death of Captain America. When Johann reappeared, he and Albert, though his age was starting to catch up with him, started to antagonize each other while both claiming the identity of the Red Skull. Finally Albert was the victim of an assassination organized by Johann, at the hands of [[Scourge of the Underworld]]. Some sources refer to Albert as Red Skull II and others as '''Red Skull III''' depending on their counting of George Maxon or not.

Thus the two enemies resumed their war with Captain America, among other opponents, frustrating the Skull's schemes; not even when the Skull possessed the all-powerful [[Cosmic Cube]] could he claim ultimate victory. 

At one point, the Skull's health failing, he used cloned tissue from Captain America's body to make him into an imitation of the Captain's civilian identity, Steve Rogers. He then used a government position to remove Rogers from the position of Captain America and replace him with a jingoistic extremist named John Walker. Although Walker initially attempted to live up to his predecessor's ideals, The Skull manipulated him into becoming an insane murderer as part of his plan to blacken the name of the superhero.  

The Skull then tried unsuccessfully to use Walker to kill Rogers. When Rogers defeated Walker, the Skull appeared to tell Rogers that he was masterminding multiple concurrent schemes rather than focusing on one grand scheme (his past modus operandus), and that he would kill Rogers at a time of his own choosing.  Rogers, disturbed by this mystery man with Rogers' face claiming to be his dead archenemy, noted that the Skull was not inhaling from the cigarette holder he had in his mouth. The cigarette turned out to be holding a lethal dose of the Skull's favourite poison, the Dust of Death, intended for Rogers but which backfired against Schmidt when Walker suddenly hit him from behind with his shield. As a result, Schmidt suffered the facial disfigurement attributed to the Dust, yet somehow survived. 

After this, the Skull was attacked by the mutant terrorist [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], a Jewish [[the Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivor who wanted to punish him for his involvement in Hitler's regime. Magneto buried him alive with enough water for a few months. The Skull remained there until he was rescued by his henchman [[Crossbones]].

The Red Skull controls multiple criminal organizations, including the [[Watchdogs]], a group of right-wing militiamen, and [[Scourge of the Underworld]], an organization devoted to murdering supervillains.

The Red Skull later manipulated his way into the position of Secretary of State as Dell Rusk (an obvious reference to [[Dean Rusk]], but also an [[anagram]] for "red skull") to develop a biological weapon he tested at Mount Rushmore.

The Red Skull was recently assassinated by the mysterious [[Bucky#Winter_Soldier|Winter Soldier]], under orders from the former Soviet general Alexander Lukin, who wanted to possess the Cosmic Cube. He was literally confirmed as dead on the panel, but whether he will stay dead remains to be seen.

==Powers and abilities==
The Red Skull had no superhuman abilities. He was a highly gifted strategist and political mastermind. When The Red Skull acquired the cloned body of Steve Rogers he was endowed with a body that was in perfect physical condition, with strength, agility, and physical endurance that exceded that of any olympic athlete who ever performed. He was trained in the use of most conventional fire arms and was a good hand-to-hand combatant. 

He typically armed himself with a trick cigarette that could fire fatal poison gas toward his victim that distorts the victims face into a "red skull".

==Memorable quotes==
*''"The war was never ended -- and never been won! It was only the first battle that we lost! So long as evil lives -- to muster the forces of bigotry, greed and oppression -- the fight goes on! So long as men take liberty for granted -- so long as they laugh at brotherhood -- sneer at honesty -- and turn away from faith -- so long will the forces of the Red Skull creep ever closer to the final victory!"'' from ''Tales of Suspense #80''

*''"As for the Fourth Reich - that dream is over. But I was wrong about this country, this wonderful United States. It has all its resources in place, all the proper attitudes laced in. To become the perfect nation, America just needs a little push..."'' from ''Avengers vol. 2 #67''
