The '''Red Skull''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]], a supervillain that appears in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is the [[archenemy]] of the [[superhero]] [[Captain America]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comicbooks.about.com/od/characters/tp/archenemies.htm|title=Top Ten Comic Book Archenemies - Superhero and Villain Arch-rivals|last=Albert|first=Aaron|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=2008-06-25}}</ref> and is portrayed as a [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] agent. Created by [[Joe Simon]], [[Jack Kirby]] and [[France Herron]], the character first appeared in ''[[Captain America Comics]]'' #1 in March 1941. He has appeared as a recurring enemy of Captain America in various ongoing series, limited series and alternate reality series in the years since.

The character has been adapted to a variety of other media platforms, including [[animated]] [[television series]], [[video games]], and live-action [[feature films]]. He was portrayed by actor [[Hugo Weaving]] in the 2011 film ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]''.

Red Skull was ranked number 21 on Wizard Magazine's Top 100 Greatest Villains Ever list and was also ranked as [[IGN]]'s 14th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/14.html | title = Red Skull is number 14 | work = [[IGN]] | publisher = [[News Corporation]] }}</ref>

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=April 2010}}
While considering ideas for an appropriate archenemy for Captain America, writer [[Joe Simon]] saw a hot fudge [[sundae]] melting and noticed it resembled a human figure. Inspired, Simon at first considered calling his new villain "Hot Fudge". However, as the cherry on top of the sundae seemed like an exposed skull, he finally decided on "Red Skull" as a more appropriate moniker.<ref>{{cite web|last=Reagan|first=Robot|title=From ice cream to Red Skull: Joe Simon explains creation of character|url=http://geektyrant.com/news/2011/6/24/from-ice-cream-to-red-skull-joe-simon-explains-creation-of-c.html|publisher=Geektyrant.com|accessdate=23 December 2011}}</ref> The Red Skull was introduced in [[Timely Comics]]' ''Captain America Comics'' #1 ([[cover-date]]d March 1941) which was edited and drawn by the team of Joe Simon and [[Jack Kirby]] and written by [[France Herron|France "Ed" Herron]].<ref>Kirby, Jack, interviewed by Bruce Hamilton in ''Rocket's Blast ComiCollector'' #81 (1971).</ref><ref>Steranko, Jim.

The Skull was to appear again in issue #3 of ''Captain America Comics''. As in issue #1, The Red Skull's secret identity is George Maxon, the owner of the Maxon Aircraft Company that makes airplanes for the U.S. Army.  Maxon wears a mask to create the look of the Red Skull and his face is often exposed. As the Red Skull, Maxon attempts to rob banks in order to raise money to overthrow the U.S. Government.  In the comic he says, "Of course you realize the main item in overthrowing the government is money."

A new version of the Red Skull was introducted in ''Captain American'' #7(Oct. 1941). This Skull claims to be the real one and states that George Maxon was but a pawn posing as the Red Skull. In later comics this Red Skull is identified as the Nazi, Johann Schmidt.

After an absence from comics for many years, both Captain America and the Red Skull were brought back in 1954 in ''Young Men Comics'' #24, in a story entitled "Back From The Dead". Here the Red Skull, thinking Captain America was dead, has left politics and started a big criminal enterprise in the United States. In his next appearance, in issue #27, the Red Skull is once again left for dead. 

The character was subsequently revived during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], first in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #65 (May 1965) in a Captain America World War II-period story run, and then was established as a contemporary villain in issue #79 (July 1966). In Silver Age of Comics there is no mention of what the Red Skull did during the 1950s.

For decades, the character's true face was hidden, but in ''Captain America'' #297 (Sept. 1984) the Red Skull unmasks in front of Captain America and his face, albeit extremely aged, is fully revealed. In the next issue, the Red Skull retells his story with his face fully visible in his various ages. When the character is revealed to be alive in issue #350 (Feb. 1989), in a story called "Resurrection," by [[Mark Gruenwald]], the face of Johann Schmidt's original body is hidden again, but the Skull's face is fully visible, albeit in his cloned copy of Captain America's body.

The character's origin was more fully illustrated in the limited series, ''Red Skull: Incarnate'', with Schmidt's face fully visible again.

==Fictional character biography==
{{plot|section|date=July 2011}}
'''Johann Schmidt''' was a former Nazi general officer and confidant of [[Adolf Hitler]]. He has been closely affiliated with [[HYDRA]] and is an enemy of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], and the interests of the [[United States]] and the free world in general. He was physically augmented by having his mind placed into the body of a [[cloning|clone]] of Captain America, the pinnacle of human perfection. He has been seemingly killed in the past, only to return time and time again to plague the world with schemes of world domination and [[genocide]].

===World War II era===
Johann Schmidt was born in a village in Germany to Hermann Schmidt and Martha Schmidt. His mother died in childbirth and his father blamed Johann for her death. Johann's father tried to drown the baby, only to be stopped by the attending doctor; he later committed suicide, leaving Johann an orphan. The doctor took Johann to an orphanage, where the child led a lonely existence. Johann ran away from the orphanage when he was seven years old and lived on the streets as a beggar and a thief. As he grew older he worked at various menial jobs but spent most of his time in prison for crimes ranging from vagrancy to theft. 

As a young man Schmidt was from time to time employed by a [[Jew]]ish shopkeeper, whose daughter Esther was the only person who had treated Schmidt kindly up to that point. Seized with passion for Esther, Schmidt tried to force himself upon her, only to be rejected by her. In unthinking fury, Schmidt murdered her. Schmidt fled the scene in terror but also felt ecstatic joy in committing his first murder. In killing Esther, he had given vent to the rage at the world that had been building up in him throughout his young life.<ref name="Captain America #298">''Captain America'' #298</ref>

According to the official version of the story told by Red Skull and the Nazis, Schmidt met Hitler while working as a bellhop in a major hotel. This occurred during his late teens, around the same time that the [[Nazi Party]] gained power in Germany. Schmidt wound up serving the rooms of Hitler himself. By chance, Schmidt was present by bringing refreshments when the Führer was furiously scolding an officer for letting a prisoner escape, during which Hitler declared that he could create a better National Socialist out of the bellhop. Looking closely at the youth and sensing his dark inner nature, Hitler decided to act on his words and recruited Schmidt.<ref name="Captain America #298"/> In the series ''[[Red Skull: Incarnate]]'', it has been revealed that Schmidt actually engineered his meeting with the Führer with himself disguised as a bellhop, tricking his fellow orphan Dieter into trying to kill Hitler and then taking this opportunity to save Hitler's life.<ref>''Red Skull: Incarnate'' #5</ref>

Dissatisfied with the standard drill instruction his subordinates used to train Schmidt, Hitler took over personally, and trained Schmidt as his right-hand man. Upon completion, Hitler gave Schmidt a unique uniform with a grotesque red [[human skull|skull]] mask, and he emerged as the "Red Skull" (in literal German: ''Roter Totenkopf'' or ''Roter (Toten-)Schädel'') for the first time. His role was the embodiment of Nazi intimidation, while Hitler could remain the popular leader of Germany. To that end, Red Skull was appointed head of Nazi [[terrorism|terrorist]] activities with an additional large role in external [[espionage]] and [[sabotage]]. He succeeded, wreaking havoc throughout Europe in the early stages of [[World War II]]. The [[propaganda]] effect was so great that the United States government decided to counter it by creating their own equivalent using the one recipient of the lost [[Weapon Plus#Weapon I|Project Rebirth]]: Steve Rogers.<ref name="Captain America #298"/> 

In Europe during the war, Red Skull took personal command of many military actions and personally supervised the takeovers and lootings of many cities and towns; in various cases Red Skull ordered and supervised the eradication of the entire population of such communities. Red Skull also organized a "wolf pack" of submarines which preyed upon shipping across the world, often under the Skull's personal command.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #66</ref>

At first, Hitler took great pride in his protégé's successes and let Red Skull have anything he wanted. Hitler thus financed the construction of secret bases for Red Skull in various locations throughout the world, many of which were equipped with highly advanced experimental weapons and devices developed by Nazi scientists. Red Skull was particularly interested in procuring technological weapons that could be used for the purposes of subversion and warfare. During the war he stole plans for the "nullatron", a device that could control human minds, adapted a space-warping device developed by the cyborg scientist codenamed Brain Drain, and commissioned Nazi scientists to develop a projector which could encircle and suspend sections of cities within spheres of energy. 

But while Red Skull always admired Hitler for his ideological vision, he was never content with being Hitler's subordinate. Red Skull kidnapped and killed many of Hitler's closest advisers and eventually rose to become the second most powerful man in the Third Reich. Now Hitler could no longer effectively control the Skull and came to fear him, especially since Red Skull had made little secret of his ambition to supplant Hitler someday.

After the renowned military officer [[Baron Wolfgang von Strucker]] had a falling out with Hitler, Red Skull sent Strucker to Japan to found an organization that would prepare the way for takeovers in the Far East under Red Skull's leadership.{{issue|date=November 2011}} In the Far East Strucker joined a subversive organization that came to be known as [[HYDRA]], broke his ties with Red Skull, became head of HYDRA and built it into a major threat to world peace.{{issue|date=November 2011}}

As World War II raged on, Hitler vowed, that if he could not conquer the world, he would destroy it. To achieve this end, Red Skull proposed the construction of five gigantic war machines, to be called the Sleepers, which would be hidden in various locations while they generated and stored the power they would need, and then be released at a future date, "Der Tag" ("The Day"), to destroy the Earth if the Allies won. Hitler enthusiastically instructed Red Skull to construct the Sleepers, unaware that Red Skull intended to use them to conquer the world himself if Hitler's Third Reich fell. In the closing days of the war in Europe, Allied intelligence received reports of a Nazi doomsday plan code-named "Der Tag" to be implemented after Hitler's defeat. However, the Allies had no idea what the plan entailed.

[[Captain America]] and teenage partner [[Bucky Barnes]] fought against and thwarted Red Skull and his plans many times during the war, both working on their own and operating as members of the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]]. Once they were captured by him, and Captain America was placed under Nazi control by a drug and told to assassinate the supreme commander of the Allied armies in Europe, but thanks to Bucky he broke free.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #67</ref> During the final days of World War II in Europe, Captain America and Bucky were assigned to England to prevent desperate Nazi efforts at sabotaging Allied supply bases there.{{issue|date=November 2011}} Red Skull sent a number of his subordinates who became known as the [[Exiles (Red Skull allies)|Exiles]], and a large contingent of loyal German soldiers and their wives to a secret island base ("Exile Island"), where they would organize an army for use in the future.{{issue|date=November 2011}}

The two counterparts soon clashed for the first time.<ref>''Adventures of Captain America'' #1-4</ref> Red Skull later temporarily brainwashed three of the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]] into serving him.<ref>''Invaders'' #5-6</ref> The Red Skull and Captain America continued to engage in a series of skirmishes throughout the war. On one occasion, Red Skull captured Captain America and told him his origin. He placed Captain America under his control and tried to use him to kill a high-ranking officer but with Bucky's help Captain America broke free.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #66-68</ref> Now that the German defeat was becoming a reality, Red Skull was more determined than ever to obtain vengeance for his numerous personal defeats by Captain America and Bucky. Red Skull assigned [[Baron Heinrich Zemo]] to go to England, and, under the cover of stealing an experimental Allied drone plane, to capture or kill Captain America and Bucky. However, Red Skull was unaware that the Allies had just secretly parachuted Captain America into beleaguered Berlin to investigate "Der Tag."{{issue|date=November 2011}}

Finally, Captain America tracked Red Skull down to his hidden bunker. Red Skull was about to hurl an armed hand grenade at his nemesis when Captain America threw his shield at him. The grenade went off, but Red Skull was not killed, thanks to his body armor. He was, however; seriously hurt and partially buried in debris. Thinking he was dying, Red Skull defiantly told Captain America that the Sleepers would avenge the Nazis' defeat. Then, suddenly, an Allied attack on Berlin began. An Allied plane dropped a huge blockbuster bomb on the bunker, causing a cave-in that Captain America barely escaped. Captain America was picked up by the Allies and returned to England only to fall into Zemo's trap, which led to Captain America's falling into suspended animation for decades. Support pillars that crisscrossed over Red Skull when the bunker caved in saved him from being struck by tons of rubble when the bomb hit. The cave-in released an experimental gas from canisters in the bunker which put the Skull into suspended animation during which his wounds slowly healed.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #79</ref>

===Post-World War II era===

===Modern era===

Johann Schmidt's legacy continued to cause trouble by way of the [[Sleeper (Marvel Comics)|Sleepers]] which were activated by his agents as scheduled. Captain America was able to neutralize all the machines in turn.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Johann Schmidt was eventually rescued and revived from suspended animation in modern times by the terrorist organization, [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|AIM]] with his henchman. Red Skull quickly subverted a cell to his own ambitions of world conquest and the death of Captain America. He stole the [[Cosmic Cube]] after taking control of its Keeper's mind with a device he planted while shaking hands, and revealed that he gave [[Baron Zemo|Zemo]] the order to steal the bomb plane that led to Bucky Barnes's death. He had had a rivalry with Zemo, and hoped to set his two foes against each other. Captain America found out from the dying pilot of a plane that had been following the Keeper's plane of the Cube, which had been used to destroy the plane. Schmidt told another AIM member of his plans after getting a mind control device on him, then caused him to shoot himself. He fought Captain America again for the first time in years after getting the Cube on an island, and created a superstrong humanoid monster to fight Captain America. Captain America began defeating it, so Red Skull sent it away. He began sending Captain America to another dimension when Captain America offered to become his servant. Red Skull encased himself in a golden suit of armor, and talked of creating a new order of knights. He planned to take over the world with the Cube, then create spaceships to conquer other worlds. Captain America defeated him by getting close to him while the Red Skull prepared to knight him. Captain America tried to get the Cube, and in the fight the island split apart due to the Cube's power, and the Skull fell off a cliff while trying to get the Cosmic Cube.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #79-81</ref> When Johann reappeared, he and Malik, though his age was starting to catch up with him, started to antagonize each other while both claiming the identity of Red Skull.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Finally Albert was the victim of an assassination organized by Johann, at the hands of a rogue agent of the [[Scourge of the Underworld]].<ref name="Captain America #347">''Captain America'' #347</ref>

Thus the two enemies resumed their war, with Captain America, among other opponents, frustrating Red Skull's schemes. Red Skull captured part of Manhattan Island,<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #88-91</ref> unleashed the fourth Sleeper, and captured Captain America on [[Exiles (Red Skull allies)|Exile Island]].<ref>''Captain America'' #101-104</ref> The Skull then regained the reality-altering [[Cosmic Cube]] and temporarily switched bodies with Captain America. He also used the Cube to alter the personality of [[Falcon (comics)|"Snap" Wilson]].<ref>''Captain America'' #114-119</ref> Some time later, he first fought [[Doctor Doom]].<ref>''Astonishing Tales'' #4-5</ref> Red Skull then fomented racial hatred in New York,<ref>''Captain America'' #143</ref> and was revealed as the true power behind the Las Vegas HYDRA faction, and first clashed with [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]].<ref>''Captain America'' #148</ref>

Some time later, Red Skull killed Roscoe (the would-be Captain America) while Steve Rogers had temporarily given up the role. He also revived the use of his "dust of death".<ref>''Captain America'' #182, 184-186</ref> Red Skull later fought Doctor Doom on the moon but was defeated.<ref>''Super-Villain Team-Up'' #10-12</ref> With [[Arnim Zola]], Red Skull sought to transplant Hitler's brain into Captain America's body.<ref>''Captain America'' #210-212</ref> He transformed a number of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents into his skull-faced slaves.<ref>''Captain America'' #226-227</ref> Red Skull teamed with the [[Hate-Monger]], a clone of Hitler, and trapped him in a flawed Cosmic Cube.<ref>''Super-Villain Team-Up'' #16-17</ref> The Skull led the Nihilist Order for a brief time.<ref>''Captain America'' #261-263</ref> Establishing a Nazi colony on a deserted island, Red Skull fathered a daughter who would eventually become known as [[Sin (Marvel Comics)|Mother Superior]].<ref>''Captain America'' #290</ref>

The war between Captain America and Red Skull in the modern era reached a breaking point when Red Skull discovered that the gas that had placed him in suspended animation was wearing off and his body was rapidly aging to what would be his normal age. Now physically weak and feeble in his mid-80s, Red Skull planned for a final showdown with his arch-rival. Kidnapping Captain America's closest allies, he forced Captain America to surrender himself and forcibly undergo a medical treatment that aged Steve's body to its rightful age. The two men, their bodies now ancient, fought one last battle to the death. When Captain America refused to kill him, Red Skull died cursing Captain America as his elderly body shut down.<ref>''Captain America'' #293-300</ref> Dead at last, it seemed like the threat of Red Skull had finally ended and the Avengers were able to restore Rogers's youth.

===Resurrection===
Red Skull would not stay dead for long; Nazi geneticist [[Arnim Zola]] had obtained DNA samples of Captain America years earlier and arranged for Red Skull's mind to be transplanted into a clone body of Captain America at the moment of his death. Assuming the identity of "'''John Smith'''" (the English equivalent of his natural German name), Red Skull decided that he would reinvent himself and his quest for absolute power as a means to celebrate his cheating death. Red Skull abandoned his longstanding beliefs in National Socialism and Hitler, on the belief that the Nazi philosophy made him look like a relic of the past. Red Skull instead turned towards American ideology for his new motivation. Red Skull saw much potential in the American dream of capitalism and self-determination and set about establishing his own foothold inside Washington DC, culminating in him gaining control over "The [[Commission on Superhuman Activities|Commission]]", a government body in Washington that monitored and regulated superhero activities.

Red Skull also changed his mode of operations: rather than "living from one grand scheme to the next", he began financing a score of evil organizations that reported directly to him, most notably the militia group the [[Watchdogs]]. He also employed one of the [[Scourge of the Underworld|Scourges]], an organization who terrorized supervillains with a killing spree.

Despite all of this, Red Skull's biggest move would be his plot to remove Steve Rogers from the position of Captain America and replace him with [[Jingoism|jingoist]] [[U.S. Agent|John Walker]]. Although Walker initially attempted to live up to his predecessor's ideals, Red Skull arranged for the murders of Walker's parents, driving him insane and into a downward spiral of murder as part of his plan to blacken the name of Captain America.<ref>''Captain America'' #346-348</ref>

Yet like all things, Red Skull's plans fell apart when Red Skull's chief pawn in the Commission was killed by Red Skull, right in front of Captain America. About to be exposed, Red Skull tried to manipulate Walker into killing Rogers. When Rogers defeated Walker, Red Skull appeared to gloat at what he had done to Rogers and Walker and the reputation of Captain America. Red Skull explained that this is part of his new operational method of engaging in multiple concurrent projects instead of investing consecutive grand schemes that his enemies could focus all their energies on stopping. Furthermore, these projects include killing Rogers at a time of his own choosing and that he could not touch Red Skull due to his status as a wealthy American businessman. Rogers, disturbed and puzzled by this mystery man with a face identical to his own and claiming to be his dead archenemy, noted that Red Skull was not inhaling from the cigarette holder he had in his mouth. The cigarette turned out to be holding a lethal dose of the Dust of Death (Red Skull's favorite poison) intended for Rogers - but the trap backfired against him when Walker suddenly hit him from behind with his shield. As a result, he suffered the facial disfigurement attributed to the Dust of Death as his face took on the appearance of a living red skull; his head is hairless and its skin has shriveled, clinging tightly to his actual skull, and has taken on a red discoloration. Red Skull did not die though, due to the effects of the Super-Soldier formula.<ref>''Captain America'' #350</ref>

After this, Red Skull masterminded a conflict between the United States and [[Symkaria]], the nation of [[Silver Sable]]<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #325</ref> He joined the "[[Acts of Vengeance]]" conspiracy, but was attacked by the mutant terrorist [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], a [[the Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivor who wanted to punish him for his involvement in Hitler's regime. Magneto buried him alive with enough water for a few months. Red Skull remained imprisoned, close to death and beginning to see the error of his ways, until he was rescued by his henchman [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]].<ref>''Captain America'' #364-367, 369-370</ref>

Red Skull's relationship with other villains was fraught with problems due to many villains shunning him because of his Nazi background. In the "Streets of Poison" storyline, Red Skull proposes an alliance with the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] to bring a new designer drug to New York but Kingpin refuses to ally with the Nazi and the two engage in a drug war. He then defeats a weakened Red Skull in hand to hand combat, sparing his life on the condition he never come near Kingpin's territory again.<ref>''Captain America'' #376-378</ref> In the "[[Acts of Vengeance]]" crossover, Red Skull demands the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]] apologize for an insult to which Wizard replies "You'll see yourself welcomed into Heaven before I speak those words!"{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Not long after that, he was kidnapped by Magneto. One prominent exception is fellow Nazi Baron [[Baron Strucker|Wolfgang von Strucker]], leader of the terrorist organization HYDRA. After Red Skull's agents allow Strucker to be reborn, a grateful Strucker allows Red Skull the use of HYDRA resources.<ref>''Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #26</ref>

Red Skull's tenure in Washington came to an end when Red Skull was captured by [[Hauptmann Deutschland]], and taken to Germany to stand trial for crimes against humanity, stemming from his days as an agent of the Third Reich. Red Skull narrowly escaped and was rescued by [[Arnim Zola]], and was forced to fake his death and go into hiding in a Rocky Mountain compound. He recruited the female sociopath [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]], a move that alienated his minions and was further rocked when his chief henchman Crossbones kidnapped Captain America's girlfriend [[Diamondback (comics)|Diamondback]], resulting in Captain America finding Red Skull's new lair. Red Skull fired Crossbones, and went into hiding while Viper, using funds she plied from Red Skull as part of a scheme to use televisions across America to blind TV viewers, was defeated by Captain America.<ref>''Captain America'' #387-391, 393-398</ref>

Red Skull resurfaced during "Operation: AIM Island", where Red Skull discovered that he was facing the same permanent paralysis that Captain America was facing due to their exposure to the Super-Soldier formula.<ref>''Avengers'' vol.3 #68</ref> When the evil scientist [[Superia]] offered Captain America a cure, Captain America refused it because Superia said that Captain America would "owe her". Red Skull took the cure and apparently killed Superia, then arranged for Captain America to be kidnapped by his remaining forces and given a blood transfusion that cured him.<ref>''Captain America'' #445</ref>

Captain America's recovery would segue into a reluctant team-up with Red Skull; a Nazi cult that worshiped Hitler as a god had discovered a Cosmic Cube that contained Hitler's mind, put there by Red Skull himself. The two sought to stop the cult from fully powering the Hitler Cosmic Cube but Red Skull opted instead to send Captain America (against his will) into the cube to kill Hitler, imprisoning Captain America in the cube while he used its power to conquer humanity. Captain America escaped and in the process used his shield to sever one of Red Skull's arms, causing him to drop the cube. The Cube then became unstable, destroying Red Skull.<ref>''Captain America'' v1 #445-448</ref>

Trapped in a hellish nightmare dimension and forced to serve as a bellhop to a world of non-European immigrants, Red Skull's will ultimately was so great that he was able to escape his prison. As a result, Red Skull now possessed limited reality warping powers that made him a truly cosmic threat. He was further aided by [[Korvac]], posing as [[Kang the Conqueror]]. He was sent to [[Galactus]]'s ship to steal more power (in particular the power of omniscience), which would remove all limits to Red Skull's reality warping powers. This led to Skull's undoing as he was ambushed by Korvac. Korvac stole Skull's cosmic powers and banished Skull back to Earth.<ref>''Captain America'' v3 #13-19</ref>

Red Skull later manipulated his way into the position in the form of U.S. Secretary of Defense '''Dell Rusk''' (an [[anagram]] for Red Skull) to develop a biological weapon he tested at Mount Rushmore.<ref>''The Avengers'' volume 3, issue 65 (May 2003)</ref> He was exposed and defeated by the Avengers. The [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] beat him so badly that he broke Red Skull's jaw in half.<ref>''The Avengers'' volume 3, issue 70 (October 2003)</ref>

===In the body of Aleksander Lukin===
[[Image:Wsoldier11.jpg|thumb|125px|The Red Skull, in Alexander Lukin's mind. Art by Steve Epting.]]
Red Skull was assassinated by the mysterious [[Bucky|Winter Soldier]], under orders from the renegade former Soviet general [[Aleksander Lukin]] wanting to possess the new Cosmic Cube Red Skull had manufactured.<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 5 #01</ref> When Red Skull was shot, he attempted to use the Cube to switch bodies with Lukin to survive, but as the Cube was still weak he only managed to transfer his mind into Lukin's body, so that the two enemies are trapped together, waging a constant war for dominance which Red Skull seems to be progressively winning. During a plot to lure out Captain America, Red Skull/Lukin recruited several German skinheads and made them the successors to the [[Master Man (Marvel Comics)|Master Man]]. He then had these soldiers that are dubbed the "Master Race" launch an attack on London, which was thwarted by Captain America, [[Spitfire (comics)|Spitfire]] and [[Union Jack (comics)|Union Jack]]. Then, Red Skull/Lukin activated a Sleeper, a robot programmed for mass destruction, that was presumably created by Doctor Doom. The robot damaged a significant portion of the new London Kronas HQ, and was ultimately destroyed by Captain America and Bucky. In the aftermath, Red Skull sent a videotape, announcing to the world his return, followed by Lukin holding a press conference condemning the actions of both the Red Skull and Captain America, and supporting the [[Superhuman Registration Act|Superhero Registration Act]]. Then, in his office, Red Skull introduced Lukin to his old/new associates [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]] and [[Sin (Marvel Comics)|Sin]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

With America's superheroes [[Civil War (comics)|divided over the act]], Red Skull manipulates events to his own ends, with the aid of [[Doctor Faustus (comics)|Doctor Faustus]], [[Doctor Doom]] and [[Arnim Zola]]. His plans involved the reunion of Captain America and his former lover [[Sharon Carter]] being manipulated by Faustus.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

In the immediate aftermath of the Civil War, Red Skull puts his plans into action, arranging for Crossbones to shoot Captain America as he enters a courthouse in New York City; in the ensuing chaos, Carter, acting under Faustus's mental directive, assassinates Captain America. This is only the first phase of Red Skull's evil plan. Upon the discovery of his identity as Lukin, Red Skull fakes his death, and initiates the second part of his plan: using Kronas Corporation's vast holdings to economically cripple the United States, before having S.H.I.E.L.D. agents brainwashed by Doctor Faustus open fire on crowds of protesters in front of the [[White House]]. Red Skull continues his assault by engineering a riot by placing Kronas security troops and drugged water in a protest on the [[Lincoln Monument]].<ref>''Captain America'' (v.5) #33-35</ref>

All of this has apparently been to elevate his puppet politician, Gordon Wright, elevated in the public's eye with being credited as "resolving" the situations, as well as surviving a (staged) attack by the [[Serpent Squad]]. Once elected, Wright will led the country directly into a police state secretly controlled by Red Skull. Red Skull also plans to transfer his consciousness into Sharon's unborn child, apparently sired by Steve Rogers himself and potentially having inherited his Project Rebirth enhancements.<ref>''Captain America'' #36</ref>

Both schemes fail because of the impatience and incompetence of Red Skull's daughter - her near-fatal attack on Sharon causes her to lose the baby, and she intentionally botches her pseudo-assassination of Gordon Wright by attempting to kill him for real.
As Faustus has surreptitiously tampered with Sharon's programming, she is able to rebel, and before escaping shoots Lukin to death. This is not the end of Red Skull, since [[Arnim Zola]] had seconds earlier transferred his mind to one of his spare robotic bodies, but after having his current form damaged by the [[Grand Director|imposter Captain America]], he's unable to return to Red Skull, essentially trapping him in his current robotic form for the time being.<ref>''Captain America'' (v.5) #42</ref>

===Captain America: Reborn===
It has been revealed that Red Skull did not actually kill Steve Rogers, but trapped his body in a fixed position in space and time. He was planning on using Sharon Carter and a machine created by Doctor Doom to return his body back to their time, but since Sharon destroyed the machine, his body is now drifting through time and space.<ref>''Captain America: Reborn'' #1</ref> Apparently, it is presumed that Red Skull intended to transfer his mind into Rogers's body. [[Norman Osborn]] decides to assist in completing his plan as a Captain America leading [[Dark Avengers|his team of Avengers]] would increase his popularity with his [[Iron Patriot]] suit.<ref>''Captain America: Reborn'' #2</ref> Sin and Crossbones find him and take him to Latveria in order to place Red Skull's mind in a living body.<ref>''Captain America: Reborn'' #3</ref> Red Skull, Sin and Crossbones land in Latveria and Doctor Doom confronts them, saying that he would kill them if he was not a man of his word. Doctor Doom and Zola complete the machine and, after [[Victoria Hand]] brings Sharon to them, they strap her in. They activate the machine and soon Steve's body returns. When Steve opens his eyes, they are shown to be red, signifying that Red Skull is now in control.<ref>''Captain America: Reborn'' #4</ref> Rogers still resides in the body, and during Red Skull's invasion of Washington D.C., he and Steve battle in the mind of Steve's body.<ref>''Captain America: Reborn'' #5</ref> Steve eventually forces Red Skull out, placing him back into his robot body. To prevent him from escaping the immediate area, Sharon hits Red Skull with a shot of [[Pym Particles]], making him a massive robot who cannot elude any pursuer's attention. While Rogers and the Avengers keep Red Skull occupied with a team attack, he is destroyed by a missile barrage fired by Sharon on a hijacked AIM battleship. In the epilogue, it was shown that Sin was too close to the exploding robot and her face was heavily scarred, leaving her looking just like her father.<ref>''Captain America: Reborn'' #6</ref>

===Clone of Red Skull===
Following the ''[[Avengers vs. X-Men]]'' storyline, Red Skull mysteriously returns and assembles a team called the [[S-Men]]. Red Skull's S-Men attack [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] and [[Scarlet Witch]] at the grave of [[Professor X]] and steal his body. In his hideout, Red Skull is then seen removing Professor X's brain in a plot to "eradicate the mutant menace".<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #1</ref> This Red Skull is revealed to be a clone of the original, created by Arnim Zola in 1942 and held in [[cryogenic]] stasis in the event that Germany lost the war. Fusing part of Professor X's brain with his own, Red Skull brainwashes Scarlet Witch as part of a plot to wipe out the world's mutant population. Rogue attacks the Scarlet Witch and they fight until they both discover the lobotomized body of Professor X. Red Skull arrives and reveals that he has fused his brain with Professor X's brain.<ref name="Uncanny Avengers #2">''Uncanny Avengers'' #2</ref> Using Professor X's telepathy, Red Skull provokes ordinary citizens of New York into a mass assault against even potential mutants, even managing to take control of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. However, his telepathy is still erratic with Red Skull being unable to completely control Captain America and an attack against him by [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] cutting off his right hand and disrupting his powers long enough for Rogue and Scarlet Witch to break free.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #3</ref> The team ultimately force Red Skull to retreat after Rogue manages to temporarily disrupt his powers, [[Havok (comics)|Havok]] mockingly comparing Red Skull to the jock who beats up gay kids to conceal his own homosexuality.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #4</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Although he has no superhuman abilities, Red Skull possesses a high intellect and inventive genius, and is a highly gifted subversive strategist and political operative. At one point, Red Skull's mind inhabited a body cloned from Captain America's, hence possessed the mutagenic alterations induced by the Super-Soldier formula. He was thus endowed with a body that was in perfect physical condition, with strength, speed, durability, agility, dexterity, reflexes, coordination, balance, and physical endurance that exceeded that of any Olympic athlete who ever performed. Despite the scar tissue covering his face and head, his senses were still above-average. He has been shown as a superb martial artist, though he was never on par with Captain America himself; he was originally trained by German athletes appointed by Hitler, and is heavily trained as a skilled marksman with various forms of handguns, and well-versed in the use of fire arms and explosives.

While sharing Alexander Lukin's body, he lost his superhuman abilities. Since then he resides in one of the android bodies engineered by Arnim Zola, with enhanced endurance and resilience.

He typically armed himself with a trick cigarette that could fire fatal poison gas — his trademark "Dust of Death" — toward his victim. The "Dust of Death" is a red powder which kills a victim within seconds of skin contact. The powder causes the skin of the victim's head to shrivel, tighten, and take on a red discoloration, while causing the hair to fall out. Hence the victim's head resembles a "red skull". He also carries a large arsenal of conventional and advanced fire arms and explosives.

After fusing his own brain with that of [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]], the clone of Red Skull gains powerful telepathic abilities.<ref name="Uncanny Avengers #2"/>

==Other Red Skulls==
There had been other people who passed themselves off as Red Skull:

===George John Maxon===
Created by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, '''George Maxon''' appeared as Red Skull in ''[[Captain America Comics]]'' #1 (March 1941) and #3 (May 1941). Maxon is an American businessman and [[Nazism|Nazi]] agent who led a ring of spies and saboteurs and serves as an agent of Johann Schmidt (the true Red Skull). He faces Captain America during two of the latter's first missions.<ref name="rdskll">[http://www.marvel.com/universe/Red_Skull_%28Johann_Shmidt%29 Johann Shmidt] Red Skull bio by Marvel Universe</ref> Maxon is thought killed during the second encounter, though he would reappear for one last encounter with Captain America.<ref>''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #65 (May 1965)</ref>

===Albert Malik===
With Johann Schmidt's disappearance after 1945, the reputation of Red Skull was still formidable enough to prove useful. In 1953, [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian]] [[KGB]] agent ''Albert Malik'' set up his spy/criminal organization in [[French Algeria|Algeria]] and assumed the Red Skull identity, pretending that he was the original, when he was actually serving Soviet interests, in ''Captain America Comics'' #61.<ref>http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/rskul2.htm</ref> During the 1950s, he faced the [[Grand Director|then active version of Captain America]] who was also pretending to be the original. The two impersonators continued to battle each other throughout the decade.{{issue|date=January 2013}} While the Captain and [[Bucky]] (Jack Monroe) were placed into suspended animation when his flawed replicate of the Super-Soldier formula seriously affected his and Bucky's minds, Malik continued his activities, and over time cut his links to the Soviet Union.{{issue|date=January 2013}} Among other notorious deeds, he was responsible for the deaths of [[Richard and Mary Parker|Richard Parker and Mary Fitzpatrick-Parker]], the parents of [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]], tipped off by the super-criminal Gustav "The Gentleman" Fiers.{{issue|date=January 2013}} Albert was later killed by [[Scourge of the Underworld]] disguised as a pilot.<ref name="Captain America #347"/>

===Sinthea Schmidt===
{{main|Sin (Marvel Comics)}}
[[Sin (Marvel Comics)|Sinthea Schmidt]], the daughter of Johann Schmidt, adopts the Red Skull moniker after being scarred like her father in the 2009 limited series ''[[Captain America: Reborn]]''.

==Other versions==

===Earth-110===
Red Skull allied with Doctor Doom, Hulk, Magneto, Namor, and Ultron in order to take over Manhattan.<ref>''Fantastic Four: Big Town'' #1-4</ref>

===Heroes Reborn===
In the [[Heroes Reborn]] universe, Red Skull is revealed to be the banker of the [[Master Man (Marvel Comics)|Master Man]]'s [[White Supremacy|World Party]]. This version references his fights with Captain America during [[World War II]],<ref>''Heroes Reborn'' #1/2</ref> but is stopped by [[Nick Fury]], Captain America and [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]].<ref>''Captain America'' Vol.2 #5</ref>

===JLA/Avengers===
Red Skull is among the foes defending Krona's stronghold in #4 and is defeated by [[Jay Garrick]] the Golden Age Flash.<ref>''JLA/Avengers'' #4</ref>

===Earth X===
Johann Schmidt was killed by Captain America some time previous to [[Earth X]]. After Red Skull killed [[Bernie Rosenthal]] and then hailed Captain America as the realization of the Nazi dream, Captain America decapitated the Red Skull using his trademark shield. As a result of his disillusionment from taking a life, Captain America retired from the Avengers, only to further spiral into depression after the Avengers were killed in Washington, D.C.<ref>''Earth X'' #1</ref> Schmidt was later seen in the Land of the Dead, and then as one of those in Mar-Vell's Paradise waiting to live in his own personal version of Heaven.<ref>''Earth X'' #3</ref>

Despite his death, Red Skull's legacy lived on in the Earth X universe. Ben Beckley took on the Red Skull identity (not the Red Skull as he had no idea who Red Skull was) and set out to conquer the world, starting with a coast-to-coast drive across America. Using his power of control over the cerebrum (and thereby actions) of anyone, he gathered an army of thousands, only to come into conflict with Steve Rogers in his Captain America identity. Insulting Captain America as old and out of date, Red Skull spared him but took several of Captain America's allies as part of his army.<ref>''Earth X'' #1-6</ref> After reaching New York City, Red Skull was opposed by Captain America and other heroes, with Captain America breaking Red Skull's neck in order to stop him.<ref>''Earth X'' #7-9</ref> Beckley would later be seen in the Land of the Dead with his father [[Comet Man]] and would help the heroes to convince the dead that they were deceased.<ref>''Earth X'' #10</ref>

===Elseworlds===
In the 1997 DC/Marvel special "Batman/Captain America", Red Skull hires the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] to steal an [[atomic bomb]] during World War II. Joker evades [[Batman]], Cap, Bucky, and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] and delivers it to Red Skull, but is horrified when he learns that Red Skull is a Nazi (saying "I may be a criminal lunatic but I'm an ''American'' criminal lunatic!"). When Red Skull threatens to drop the bomb on Washington D.C., Joker actually fights him in the plane's cargo bay. When Captain America and Batman take over the plane and bring it over the ocean, the two villains are dropped out with the bomb just before it explodes. Both Captain America and Batman are convinced the two are still alive somehow.<ref>''Batman & Captain America'' #1 (January 1997)</ref>

===Marvel Zombies===
In ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'', Red Skull is an undead zombie with an unquenchable hunger for the flesh of the living. In issue #5, he finally manages to kill [[Alternative versions of Captain America#Marvel Zombies|Colonel America]], by scooping out the last of the Colonel's exposed brain before being decapitated by a zombified [[Alternative versions of Spider-Man#Marvel Zombies|Spider-Man]], and his head crushed by [[Henry Pym#Marvel Zombies|Giant Man]]'s boot. His last words were "It was worth it, all of it, just for this", before he was killed by the other zombies.<ref>''Marvel Zombies'' #5 (April 2006)</ref>

===Old Man Logan===
In a [[Old Man Logan|possible future]] where a final battle between the heroes and villains ended with the villains winning, Red Skull is revealed as the mastermind of the villains' conquest and has made himself President of the United States. Living in the Nazi redecorated [[White House]], Red Skull had taken to wearing Captain America's old bloodstained uniform and collecting gruesome trophies from fallen heroes. When his men bring in a wounded Wolverine, Logan and Red Skull fight in his trophy room. Unwilling to pop his claws during the fight, Wolverine decapitates Red Skull with Captain America's shield, ending his villainous rule.<ref>''Wolverine Giant-Size Old Man Logan'' (September 2009)</ref>

===Ultimate Red Skull===
[[Image:Ultimate Red Skull.jpg|thumb|150px|Ultimate Red Skull shown on the variant cover to ''Ultimate Comics: Avengers'' #1. Art by Leinil Yu.]]
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Red Skull appears in ''[[Ultimate Comics: Avengers]]'' created by [[Mark Millar]]. This incarnation is the illegitimate son of Steve Rogers and Gail Richards, and wears simple khaki pants and a white tee shirt unlike the Nazi/military costume of the 616 counterpart.<ref name="Ultimate Avengers #2"/> After his father's presumed death during WWII and taken from his mother, the son is raised on an army base where he appears to be a well-adjusted, physically superior and tactically brilliant young man who greatly resembles his father. However, his easy-going personality was a ruse. Around the age of seventeen, he kills over 200 men on the base and then cuts off his own face which leaves a 'red skull' to reject his father.<ref name="Ultimate Avengers #2">''Ultimate Avengers'' #2</ref> As a final symbol of his rebellion against the system that created him, he assassinates President John F. Kennedy in 1963.<ref name="Ultimate Avengers #5">''Ultimate Avengers'' #5</ref> During his career, he forced [[Swarm (comics)|a woman]] to kill her husband but killed her infant son himself anyway. After decades of working as a professional assassin, Red Skull joins [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] so that he and his men steal the blueprints of the Cosmic Cube at the Baxter Building. There he finally meets [[Ultimate Captain America|Captain America]] in his helicopter and brutally attacks him. Before throwing Captain America out of the helicopter, Red Skull reveals his true identity. At the A.I.M. headquarters in Alaska, Red Skull kills the led officer and takes charge of the operation. With control of the Cosmic Cube, he gains great power. As a sadistic display of his power, he has the entire Alaskan A.I.M. team cannibalize each other. When the Avengers arrive on the scene, they immediately try to destroy him but the Cube imbues him with nearly unlimited power, making him absolutely invulnerable. During the battle with the Avengers he beats them mercilessly. Captain America arrives in a stolen Teleporter Jet, but Red Skull forces the jet to crash. Cap survives the crash and teleports the jet to Red Skull's exact coordinates, impaling him on one of the two rods that protrude from its nose.<ref name="Ultimate Avengers #6">''Ultimate Avengers'' #6</ref> Red Skull is taken to a hospital and kept alive long enough for his mother to say her goodbyes. Red Skull explains to [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]] that all he wanted to do with the Cosmic Cube was to turn back time and prevent his father from being lost during the war so that he could grow up with him and led a normal life, rather than the one he was given. [[Swarm (comics)|Petra Laskov]] enters the room dressed as a doctor and shoots Red Skull in the head, killing him. [[Gregory Stark]] implies that Fury was responsible for calling Red Skull out of retirement in order to regain his position in S.H.I.E.L.D. back.<ref name="Ultimate Avengers #6">''Ultimate Avengers'' #6</ref>

With help from Red Skull and the villains with him, Dr. Doofenshmirtz causes mayhem in Danville. Eventually, Doofenshmirtz reveals that his Power-Draininator was destroyed by his nemesis Agent Perry the Platypus after it drained the powers, much to Red Skull's anger; but Doofenshmritz manages to create a second and improved replica of the device, much to the Red Skull's delight.
