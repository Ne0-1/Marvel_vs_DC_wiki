'''Death''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appeared in [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]] #27 (Jul. 1973) and was created by [[Mike Friedrich]] and [[Jim Starlin]].  

== Publication history ==
'''Death''' is an abstract entity, the embodiment of the end of life in the [[Marvel Universe]], and the opposite of [[Eternity (Marvel Comics)|Eternity]], the embodiment of the universe.<ref>''Quasar'' #19 - 25 (Feb. - Aug. 1991)</ref> 

The character appears sporadically throughout the Marvel universe. The entity appears in the title ''[[War Is Hell (comics)|War Is Hell]]'' and forces [[soldier]] [[John Kowalski (comics)|John Kowalski]] to undergo a number of lives and deaths as [[punishment]] for doing nothing to prevent the [[invasion of Poland]],<ref>''[[War Is Hell (comics)|War Is Hell]]'' 9 - 15 (Oct. 1974 - Oct. 1975:bi-monthly)</ref> with Kowalski eventually becoming an aspect of Death;<ref>''Man-Thing'' vol. 2, #10 - 11 (May & July 1981)</ref> in the title ''Ghost Rider'' posing as "Death Ryder" to test [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]]<ref>''Ghost Rider'' #35 (Apr. 1973)</ref> and becoming fascinated with the Titan [[Thanos]].

After killing herself, Phoenix finds herself on a strange construct at the edge of space, alone with a construction worker. Having nowhere else to go, she helps him with the work, suddenly reliving her crimes as Dark Phoenix as a result. Afterwards, she understands that the worker is Death and her experiences help her understand her own role in the cosmic order. She decides to return to life, having learned from her mistakes. Left alone, Death pities her, as there are pieces of the puzzle she isn’t aware of, but she will learn the hard way.<ref>''Classic X-Men'' #43 (January 1990)</ref>

An elaborate storyline in the title ''[[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]]'' showcases Thanos' scheme to conquer the universe, as the character becomes determined to prove his [[love]] for Death by destroying all life. Although Thanos obtains the [[Magic item|artifact]] the [[Cosmic Cube]] and succeeds in taking control of the universe, Death abandons the character when he is  defeated by the combined might of Captain Marvel; [[Drax the Destroyer]] and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #27 - 33 (Jul. - Jan. 1973 - 1974)</ref> Two Marvel Annuals feature Thanos as he tries to "woo" Death back (courtesy of the [[Infinity Gems]] with which he plans to extinguish every [[star]] in the [[galaxy]]), but the character is killed in a final battle with the Avengers; Captain Marvel and [[Adam Warlock]].<ref>''Avengers'' Annual #7 + ''Marvel Two-In-One'' Annual #2 (1977)</ref> When Captain Marvel is dying from [[cancer]], Thanos returns to the character in a [[Hallucination|vision]] and introduces him to the entity Death. Marvel willingly surrenders his life and embraces the entity.<ref>''The Death of Captain Marvel'' (Apr. 1982)</ref>

In Marvel's first [[limited series]], ''[[Contest of Champions]]'', Death is coerced into a game of strategy by the [[Elder of the Universe]] the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]]. The Grandmaster wins the game and forces Death to resurrect the [[Collector (comics)|Collector]],<ref>Killed by the entity [[Korvac]] in ''Avengers'' #175 (Sep. 1978)</ref> a fellow Elder. The Grandmaster then takes his place in the Realm of the Dead.<ref>''Contest of Champions'' # 1 - 3 (Jun - Aug. 1982)</ref> In the limited series ''[[Secret Wars II]]'' the entity the [[Beyonder]] takes human form and visits Earth. It decides to "save" mankind, and in doing so destroys Death, but is then shown there is a need for Death and recreates the entity.<ref>''Secret Wars II'' #6 (Dec. 1985)</ref>

In an ''Avengers'' Annual the Grandmaster reveals his sacrifice was a [[deception|ruse]] as he is able to steal Death's powers and via another deception tricks the entity into banishing all Elders from the Realm of the Dead, effectively rendering them [[Immortality|immortal]].<ref>''Avengers'' Annual #16 (1987)</ref> The threads of this storyline continue in the title ''[[Silver Surfer]]'', as Death does not forget the manipulation and wipes three Elders - the [[Astronomer (comics)|Astronomer]]; [[Possessor (comics)|Possessor]] and [[Trader (comics)|Trader]] - from existence when they attempt to disrupt the cosmic balance by attempting to kill fellow cosmic entity [[Galactus]].<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #16 - 17 (Oct. - Nov. 1988)</ref>

The limited series ''[[The Thanos Quest]]'' reveals that Death perceives an imbalance in the universe and a gradual shift towards life rather than death, the entity resurrects Thanos. Thanos successfully collects the [[Infinity Gems]], and as a now [[omnipotent]] being, attempts to converse with Death. The irony is the character is now superior to Death, and as such Death may not speak with him (a fact relayed via one of Death's minions).<ref>''Thanos Quest'' #1 - 2 (Sep. - Oct. 1990)</ref> The story continues in a consecutive limited series, ''[[The Infinity Gauntlet]]'', in which Thanos then wipes half the beings in the universe from existence as proof of his love for Death, and the entity remains and watches as he battles the cosmic pantheon and Earth's metahumans. Death departs when Thanos is finally defeated.<ref>''Infinity Gauntlet'' #1 - 6 (July - Dec. 1991)</ref> 

The [[mercenary]] [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]] is depicted having a humorous exchange with the entity in a self-titled Annual. Deadpool is shown becoming infatuated with Death after a number of [[near-death]] experiences.<ref>''Deadpool/Death '98 (1998)''</ref>  During the ''Funeral for a Freak'' storyline, Death appears to reciprocate the feeling, and a [[jealous]] Thanos prevents Deadpool from dying and joining the entity.<ref>''Deadpool'' vol. 2, #61 - 64 (Feb. - May 2002)</ref> In the second volume of ''Captain Marvel'', Death reunites with Thanos to confront the Death God '''Walker''', who tries unsuccessfully to court Death. Death hides within the body of [[Marlo Chandler]], the girlfriend of [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]], in an attempt to escape Walker. The entity eventually destroys Walker and then leaves the body of Marlo, although Marlo retains a small fraction of Death's power.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' vol. 2, #17 - 19 (Feb. - Mar. 2001)</ref>

The limited series ''[[Avengers: Celestial Quest]]'' continues to explore the relationship between Death and Thanos, as the entity reveals to Thanos that their energies merged when he was resurrected, creating an offspring called the '''Rot'''. Death and Thanos work together to destroy their offspring, and it is at this time that Death finally addresses Thanos and admits to feeling "love" for him.<ref>''Avengers: Celestial Quest'' #1 - 8 (Sep. 2001 - Apr. 2002)</ref> The pair also share a [[kiss]] in the limited series ''[[Marvel: The End]]'', moments before Thanos, possessing the artifact the [[Heart of the Universe]], recreates the universe minus a critical flaw that would have destroyed it.<ref>''Marvel: The End'' #1 - 6 (May - Aug. 2003)</ref>  

During the limited series ''[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]'', Thanos joins the fight to stop the [[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation Wave]], and during the war is killed by his old foe Drax the Destroyer. When the hero [[Nova (comics)|Nova]] is near death from injuries sustained in battle, he glimpses Death and Thanos standing together watching him.<ref>''Annihilation'' #6 (Mar. 2007): ''Annihilation'' #1 - 6 (Oct. 2006 - Mar. 2007)</ref> The second volume of the ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' features a new development: [[Phyla-Vell]], the heroine [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]], agrees to become the new [[Incarnation|avatar]] of Death in exchange for the freedom of lover [[Moondragon|Heather Douglas]].<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #12 (May 2009)</ref>

During the ''[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]'' storyline, [[Daimon Hellstrom]] mentions to Hercules that Death has fled their reality upon [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (comics)|Amatsu-Mikaboshi]] triumphing in the realms of the dead causing the souls of the deceased to be unleashed upon the Earth.<ref>''Chaos War'' #2</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
As a cosmic concept, Death possesses the power to achieve virtually any effect. Being an [[abstract entity]], Death has no physical body, but usually appears in a female humanoid form so it can be perceived by lesser beings. Death resides inside a pocket dimension known as the Realm of Death, which also houses the Infinity Well, containing the knowledge of the universe.<ref>''Thanos Quest'' #1 (1990)</ref> Death is classfied as a "possibly multiversal" level threat by [[Nova Corps]], the only being in their files to be described thus.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

==Other versions==
===Earth X===
In this universe, Death is killed by Thanos when he uses the artifact the [[Ultimate Nullifier]] to destroy her.<ref>''Earth X'' #0-12 (Mar. 1999 - Apr. 2000)</ref>
