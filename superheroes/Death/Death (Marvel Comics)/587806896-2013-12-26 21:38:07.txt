'''Death''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appeared in [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]] #27 (Jul. 1973) and was created by [[Mike Friedrich]] and [[Jim Starlin]].

==Publication history==
The entity appears in the title ''[[War Is Hell (comics)|War Is Hell]]'' and forces [[soldier]] [[John Kowalski (comics)|John Kowalski]] to undergo a number of lives and deaths as [[punishment]] for doing nothing to prevent the [[invasion of Poland]],<ref>''War Is Hell'' 9 - 15 (Oct. 1974 - Oct. 1975:bi-monthly)</ref> with Kowalski eventually becoming an aspect of Death;<ref>''Man-Thing'' vol. 2, #10 - 11 (May & July 1981)</ref> in the title ''Ghost Rider'' posing as "Death Ryder" to test [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]]<ref>''Ghost Rider'' #35 (April 1973)</ref> and becoming fascinated with the Titan [[Thanos]].

==Fictional character biography==
'''Death''' is an abstract entity, the embodiment of the end of life in the [[Marvel Universe]], and the opposite of [[Eternity (Marvel Comics)|Eternity]], the embodiment of the universe.<ref>''Quasar'' #19 - 25 (Feb. - Aug. 1991)</ref> Death is predominantly depicted as a skeleton cloaked in a black or purple robe, and at times appears as a Caucasian human female. An elaborate storyline in the title ''[[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]]'' showcases [[Thanos]]'s scheme to conquer the universe, as the character becomes determined to prove his [[love]] for Death by destroying all life. Although Thanos obtains the [[Magic item|artifact]] the [[Cosmic Cube]] and succeeds in taking control of the universe, Death abandons the character when he is  defeated by the combined might of Captain Marvel; [[Drax the Destroyer]] and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #27 - 33 (Jul. - Jan. 1973 - 1974)</ref> Two Marvel Annuals feature Thanos as he tries to "woo" Death back (courtesy of the [[Infinity Gems]] with which he plans to extinguish every [[star]] in the [[galaxy]]), but the character is killed in a final battle with the Avengers; Captain Marvel and [[Adam Warlock]].<ref>''Avengers'' Annual #7 + ''Marvel Two-In-One'' Annual #2 (1977)</ref> When Captain Marvel is dying from [[cancer]], Thanos returns to the character in a [[Hallucination|vision]] and introduces him to the entity Death. Marvel willingly surrenders his life and embraces the entity.<ref>''The Death of Captain Marvel'' (Apr. 1982)</ref>

In Marvel's first [[limited series]], ''[[Contest of Champions]]'', Death agrees to a game of strategy with the [[Elder of the Universe]] the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]]. The Grandmaster wins the game and Death provides him with the power (via the Golden Globe of Life) to resurrect the [[Collector (comics)|Collector]],<ref>Killed by the entity [[Korvac]] in ''Avengers'' #175 (Sep. 1978)</ref> a fellow Elder. Only then does Death reveal that the Golden Globe is an empty instrument that needs to be powered by a life-force equal to that of the being who is to be restored. To resurrect the Collector, the Grandmaster sacrifices his life and takes the Collector's place in the Realm of the Dead.<ref>''Contest of Champions'' # 1 - 3 (Jun - Aug. 1982)</ref> In the limited series ''[[Secret Wars II]]'' the entity the [[Beyonder]] takes human form and visits Earth. It decides to "save" mankind, and in doing so destroys Death, but is then shown there is a need for Death and recreates the entity.<ref>''Secret Wars II'' #6 (Dec. 1985)</ref>

In an ''Avengers'' Annual the Grandmaster reveals his sacrifice was a [[deception|ruse]] as he is able to steal Death's powers and via another deception tricks the entity into banishing all Elders from the Realm of the Dead, effectively rendering them [[Immortality|immortal]].<ref>''Avengers'' Annual #16 (1987)</ref> The threads of this storyline continue in the title ''[[Silver Surfer]]'' where a group of eleven Elders conspires to use the [[Infinity Gems]] to kill the cosmic entity [[Galactus]] and thereby destroy reality itself. After their plan is thwarted, Galactus devours five of the Elders, assuming that his status as being who transcends Death and Eternity means that he does not have to abide by Death's vow. However, Galactus finds the Elders difficult to absorb and Death is displeased that Galactus has chosen to ignore her vow.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol.3, #10 (April 1988)</ref> Subsequently, when three Elders - the [[Astronomer (comics)|Astronomer]]; [[Possessor (comics)|Possessor]] and [[Trader (comics)|Trader]] - threaten to use the Infinity Gems to prevent the [[In-Betweener]] from hurling Galactus (with their brother Elders still inside him) into a black hole, the conceptual being responds by summoning Death and forcing her to negate the three Elders against her will, a transgression that Death finds heinous.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #17 (Nov. 1988)</ref>

The limited series ''[[The Thanos Quest]]'' reveals that Death perceives an imbalance in the universe and a gradual shift towards life rather than death, the entity resurrects Thanos. Thanos successfully collects the [[Infinity Gems]], and as a now [[omnipotent]] being, attempts to converse with Death. The irony is the character is now superior to Death, and as such Death may not speak with him (a fact relayed via one of Death's minions).<ref>''Thanos Quest'' #1 - 2 (Sep. - Oct. 1990)</ref> The story continues in a consecutive limited series, ''[[The Infinity Gauntlet]]'', in which Thanos then wipes half the beings in the universe from existence as proof of his love for Death; the entity remains and watches as he battles Earth's metahumans, but after they are defeated, Death joins the cosmic pantheon in trying to defeat Thanos.  Though the cosmic entities are unsuccessful, Thanos eventually loses the Infinity Gems and is defeated.<ref>''Infinity Gauntlet'' #1 - 6 (July - Dec. 1991)</ref>

The [[mercenary]] [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]] is depicted having a humorous exchange with the entity in a self-titled Annual. Deadpool becomes infatuated with Death after he has a number of [[near-death]] experiences.<ref>''Deadpool/Death '98 (1998)''</ref>  During the ''Funeral for a Freak'' storyline, Death appears to reciprocate the feeling, and a [[jealous]] Thanos prevents Deadpool from dying and joining the entity and curses him with immortality.<ref>''Deadpool'' vol. 2, #61 - 64 (Feb. - May 2002)</ref> In the second volume of ''Captain Marvel'', Death reunites with Thanos to confront the Death God '''Walker''', who tries unsuccessfully to court Death. Death hides within the body of [[Marlo Chandler]], the girlfriend of [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]], in an attempt to escape Walker. The entity eventually destroys Walker and then leaves the body of Marlo, although Marlo retains a small fraction of Death's power.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' vol. 2, #17 - 19 (Feb. - Mar. 2001)</ref>

The limited series ''[[Avengers: Celestial Quest]]'' continues to explore the relationship between Death and Thanos, as the entity reveals to Thanos that their energies merged when he was resurrected, creating an offspring called the '''Rot'''. Death and Thanos work together to destroy their offspring, and it is at this time that Death finally addresses Thanos and admits to feeling "love" for him.<ref>''Avengers: Celestial Quest'' #1 - 8 (Sep. 2001 - Apr. 2002)</ref> The pair also share a [[kiss]] in the limited series ''[[Marvel: The End]]'', moments before Thanos, possessing the artifact the [[Heart of the Universe]], recreates the universe minus a critical flaw that would have destroyed it.<ref>''Marvel: The End'' #1 - 6 (May - Aug. 2003)</ref>

During the limited series ''[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]'', Thanos joins the fight to stop the [[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation Wave]], and during the war is killed by his old foe Drax the Destroyer. When the hero [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]] is near death from injuries sustained in battle, he glimpses Death and Thanos standing together watching him.<ref>''Annihilation'' #6 (Mar. 2007): ''Annihilation'' #1 - 6 (Oct. 2006 - Mar. 2007)</ref> The second volume of the ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' features a new development: [[Phyla-Vell]], the heroine [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]], agrees to become the new [[Incarnation|avatar]] of Death in exchange for the freedom of lover [[Moondragon|Heather Douglas]].<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #12 (May 2009)</ref>

In ''[[The Thanos Imperative]]'', the Captain Marvel of the Cancerverse, called '''Lord Mar-Vell''', using a ritual to the [[Many-angled ones]] that involves sacrificing the Avatar of Death, is able to destroy Death's [[Cosmic entity (Marvel Comics)|M-body]] and remove her from his universe.{{Issue|date=January 2011}} In the last issue of this six-part mini-series, it is revealed that Thanos, upon coming back to life, has been completely removed from the realm of death and can no longer die. In a twist he appears to accept Lord Mar-Vell's proposal to be a sacrifice so the Many-angled ones can invade the [[Earth-616|616 universe]]; however, this proves a trap set by Death herself in order to get close to Mar-Vell. By destroying him, she kills every living thing in the Cancerverse, initiates its and the Fault's collapse, and even injures the Many-angled ones to such a degree that it will take them eons to heal.{{Issue|date=January 2011}}

During the ''[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]'' storyline, [[Daimon Hellstrom]] mentions to Hercules that Death has fled their reality upon [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (comics)|Amatsu-Mikaboshi]] triumphing in the realms of the dead, causing the souls of the deceased to be unleashed upon the Earth, and rendering the victims of the siege, whose injuries might otherwise prove fatal, merely locked in a deathless limbo.<ref>''Chaos War'' #2</ref>
