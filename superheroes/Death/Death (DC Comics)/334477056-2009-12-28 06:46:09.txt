'''Death''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[DC Comics|DC]] [[comic book]] series, ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'' (1988 - 1996). The character first appeared in ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'' vol. 2,  #8 (August 1989), and was created by [[Neil Gaiman]] and [[Mike Dringenberg]].<ref name="vert-deat">{{Citation  | last = Irvine | first = Alex | author-link = Alexander C.

In the stories, Death is both the end of life and a [[psychopomp]]. Like most [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[Death (personification)|personifications of death]], Death meets with the recently deceased and guides them into their new existence. However, unlike most personifications of [[death]], she also visits people as they are born, according to [[Destruction (DC Comics)|Destruction]] in the "Sandman Special". Evidently, only she seems to remember these encounters. In the special issue, it is also revealed that Death was known in Ancient Greece as Teleute.

Physically, Death is also opposite to the traditional western culture personification of death (see [[Grim Reaper]]). In ''The Sandman'', Death instead appears as an attractive, pale young goth woman dressed in casual clothes - often a black top and jeans. She also wears a silver [[ankh]] on a chain around her neck, and has a marking similar to the [[eye of Horus]] around her right eye.<ref name="dc-ency"/> She is pleasant, down-to-earth, perky, and has been a nurturing figure for both incarnations of [[Dream (comics)|Dream]]. This irony has helped make Death one of the most popular characters from ''Sandman''. Death was named the fifteenth greatest comic book character by ''[[Empire Magazine]]''.<ref>http://www.empireonline.com/50greatestcomiccharacters/default.asp?c=15</ref>

==Publication history==
[[Image:Deathpcsmall.jpg|thumb|left|Death in ''Weird War Tales'' #80]]
Other personifications of Death have appeared in the DC Universe. These altering physical appearances may be rationalized as being completely different characters with an unknown relation (or lack thereof) to the overall Death shown in the ''Sandman'' series, or may be explained by a sequence at the beginning of the ''Sandman'' series. In the sequence where Morpheus is searching for his objects of power, he appears at [[Martian Manhunter]]'s door, and for a frame we see him as Martian Manhunter sees him: it's nothing like humans see him. This could indicate that the physical appearance of the Endless (the appearance of Dream, at the very least) is subject to the mind of the person doing the observing. Many references are made throughout Death and the Sandman series which indicate that perception of the form of the Endless is subjective, not objective. 

In ''[[Captain Atom]]'' #42 (also by Giffen) Death appears alongside [[Black Racer]] of the [[New Gods]] and [[Nekron]] (a "god of death" from ''[[Green Lantern]]''). The story stated that all three were equal, representing different aspects of death. Gaiman has denied this, however, and his stories make it clear that Death of the Endless is the ultimate personification of Death. It might be assumed, however, Nekron, the Racer, and the [[Black Flash]] are connected to her in some way.  Alternatively, there may be multiple avatars or gods of Death in the DC universe, besides those claiming to be Death. It is possible that [[Blackest Night]] may resolve this apparent contradiction or ambiguity.

A more traditional version of Death, a skeleton in a bluish or purplish cloak, appeared as host in such DC titles such as ''[[Weird Mystery Tales]]'', ''[[House of Secrets]]'', ''[[Ghosts (comics)|Ghosts]]'', ''[[Weird War Tales]]'' (including being in the story in issue #94), ''[[DC Comics Presents]]'' #29, etc. ''Weird War Tales'' typically featured Death as a skeleton in some sort of military uniform relevant to the era and locality of the war depicted.  This character appeared as recently as ''[[Cassandra Peterson|Elvira]]'s [[House of Mystery]]'' #2 (February 1986). How this [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|pre-Crisis]] Death relates to Gaiman's Death, if at all, is unclear, although her older brother [[Destiny (DC Comics)|Destiny]] appeared with the character,<ref>''[[Secrets of Haunted House]]'' #23 and possibly others</ref>  and both Deaths have appeared with incarnations of [[Superman]]. Superman referred to the earlier Death with the term "Grim Reaper", so perhaps that could be regarded as a distinct character, however, in the pages of ''Weird War Tales'', he called himself "Death."<ref> ''DC Comics Presents'' #29</ref> [[Madame Xanadu]]'s immortality was originally givien to her by a Grim Reaper like character {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}, in her new series it's Death of the Endless the one that grants her immortality<ref>''Madame Xanadu'' vol. 2 #6</ref>, perhaps suggesting that the Grim Reaper character has been [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] to be Death.

In ''[[Swamp Thing]]'' vol. 2, #6, The [[Phantom Stranger]] met Death in the form of a middle-aged gentleman, possibly inspired by ''[[Death Takes a Holiday]]''. In the story, a young woman, Margaret "Maggie" Brennan, had what should have been a minor head injury and at one glimpse of Death chose to become Death's bride. As someone newly-dead herself, she taught Death that he needs to show compassion for the newly-dead to allay their fears. He takes her advice and they both serve as aspects of Death. This version of Death was created by [[Mike W. Barr]] and [[Dan Spiegle]]. Maggie is blonde and bears only minor physical resemblance to Gaiman and Dringenberg's version, though her compassionate nature is a similarity.

The current incarnation of Death first appeared in the final chapter of ''Sandman''’s first story arc ''[[The Sandman: Preludes and Nocturnes|Preludes and Nocturnes]]'', "The Sound of Her Wings", (issue #8) where she gave Dream direction and a degree of understanding. Death instantly became very popular to readers, and she appears at least briefly in each of the nine subsequent story arcs. However, Gaiman attempted to entice and tease readers by rationing out the number of appearances from Dream’s family, so Death did not appear as frequently as one might expect for such a popular character. At the end of the ninth Sandman story arc ''[[The Sandman: The Kindly Ones|The Kindly Ones]]'', there is a lengthy and noteworthy appearance from Death, in which she finally brings her brother peace.

===Character design===
According to Gaiman, the initial visual design of Death was based on a friend of Dringenberg's named Cinnamon.<ref>[http://www.holycow.com/dreaming/lore/interview4.html The Dreaming: The Neil Gaiman Page<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> From ''[[The Sandman Companion]]'':

{{cquote|Death is the only major character whose visuals didn't spring from me; that credit goes to Mike Dringenberg. In my original Sandman outline, I suggested Death look like rock star [[Nico]] in 1968, with the perfect cheekbones and perfect face she has on the cover of her ''[[Chelsea Girl (album)|Chelsea Girl]]'' album.

But Mike Dringenberg had his own ideas, so he sent me a drawing based on a woman he knew named Cinnamon &mdash; the drawing that was later printed in Sandman 11 &mdash; and I looked at it and had the immediate reaction of, "Wow. That's really cool." Later that day, [[Dave McKean]] and I went to dinner in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] at the My Old Dutch Pancake House and the waitress who served us was a kind of vision. She was American, had long black hair, was dressed entirely in black &mdash; black jeans, T-shirt, etc. &mdash; and wore a big silver [[ankh]] on a silver necklace. And she looked exactly like Mike Dringenberg's drawing of Death.}}

McKean also used a series of professional English models for representations of Death on covers of ''Sandman.''<ref>[http://www3.sympatico.ca/nancy.kilpatrick/n_the_goth_bible_corrections.htm The goth Bible: A Compendium for the Darkly Inclined by Nancy Kilpatrick Corrections & Omissions<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Despite some rumors, Death is not based on Gaiman's friend [[Tori Amos]].<ref>{{cite book

Death's apparent age varies slightly. In the picture above, from ''Death: The The Time of Your Life'', she appears to be teenager. In most ''Sandman'' stories she looks to be in her mid-twenties. In the giveaway ''Death Talks About Life'' (an AIDS-prevention giveaway), Death appears to about thirty, with wrinkle lines in her forehead that are not usually present.

==Fictional character biography==
Death is the second eldest of [[Endless (comics)|the Endless]],<ref name="dc-endl">{{Citation | last = Jimenez | first = Phil | author-link = Phil Jimenez | contribution = Endless, The | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 115  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref> a family of anthropomorphic beings.<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation | last = Jimenez | first = Phil | author-link = Phil Jimenez | contribution = Death | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 97  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = New York  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref> Death is possibly the most powerful of the Endless (and may be the most powerful being in the universe) having been shown (in a flashback in ''[[The Sandman: Brief Lives|Brief Lives]]'') to be virtually omniscient and being able to intimidate the Furies, who show no fear of the other Endless, simply by raising her voice in ''[[The Sandman: The Kindly Ones|The Kindly Ones]]''. The witch Thessaly mentions that Death is the only one of the Endless who is bound by no rules. In addition, it is mentioned in ''Brief Lives'' that she is the only one of the Endless who may survive the end of this incarnation of the universe.  Death's realm is not portrayed in detail in the series, except for a brief scene in her 'house' in the ''Sandman Special'', ''Song of [[Orpheus]]'', and later in ''[[The Books of Magic]]'' series. This is where she keeps her floppy hat collection, her [[goldfish]] Slim and Wandsworth and possibly her gallery. A brief glimpse of her realm can also be seen in the first issue of ''[[The Sandman: The Wake|The Wake]]'', where a messenger visits her as she walks in open, sunny grasslands, and in ''[[The Little Endless Storybook]]'', when Barnabas visits her, again in her 'house.'

One day every century, Death lives (and dies) as a mortal, in order to understand the value of the life she takes. She does this by becoming a mortal fated to die that day. At the end of ''[[Death: The High Cost of Living]]'' her Endless self briefly converses with her mortal self.

===Vertigo Comics===
Death's popularity saw her spun off into two solo [[limited series]], ''[[Death: The High Cost of Living]]'' (1993), and ''[[Death: The Time of Your Life]]'' (1996). Both were written by Gaiman and illustrated by [[Chris Bachalo]], and dealt with Death's encounters with various mortals. ''Death: The High Cost of Living'' became the first comic released under the newly-instigated [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] branding in 1993, at which point ''The Sandman'' also moved from the DC to Vertigo imprint.

In 2003, the [[manga]]-style [[graphic novel]] ''[[Death: At Death's Door]]'' portrayed Death's activities during the fourth Sandman story arc ''[[The Sandman: Season of Mists|Season of Mists]]''. It was written and illustrated by [[Jill Thompson]], and the format proved popular enough for Thompson to produce the similarly manga-influenced follow-up ''[[Dead Boy Detectives]]'', featuring minor ''Sandman'' characters, and "featuring a cameo by Death."<ref>Thompson, Jill ''Dead Boy Detectives'' (Vertigo, July 2005)</ref> 

A one-shot issue titled ''A Death Gallery'' (1994) was released as one of several art showcase comics spotlighting various Sandman characters released between 1994 and 1995. The ''Death Gallery'' featured representations of Death by more than thirty comics artists, including a rough sketch by Gaiman himself. In ''[[The Sandman: Endless Nights|Endless Nights]]'' (2003) Gaiman shows Death several billion years ago, with a markedly different personality &mdash; forbidding and joyless. 

She also appears in ''[[The Books of Magic]]'' (first volume, 1991, also written by Gaiman) at the very end of time, where her function is to set things in order and close the universe down. She meets [[Timothy Hunter]] and [[Mister E]] there after Mister E has taken Timothy all the way to the end of time, because only there can he kill Timothy without fear of interference. Death stops the murder on the grounds that "I took both of you billions of years ago."  She sends Timothy back home, but forces Mister E to return the hard way.<ref name="vert-ency">{{Citation  | last = Irvine | first = Alex | author-link = Alexander C.

Hunter later encounters Death walking in the rain in ''The Books of Magic'' #25, and there was later an arc about her in ''[[Hunter, The Age of Magic]]''. In ''[[Hellblazer]]'' #120, Death appears briefly in a pub filled with ghosts.

In the [[AIDS]]-awareness eight-page comic ''Death Talks About Life'' by Gaiman and McKean (which was first included in various Vertigo titles, and later released as a stand-alone giveaway pamphlet), Death demonstrates safe sex by placing a [[condom]] on a [[banana]] held by [[John Constantine]]. Lightening the impact of the underlying message, she informs the reader that when one is through with the demonstration, "you can eat the banana."<ref>Gaiman, Neil and McKean, Dave ''Death Talkes About Life'' (DC/Vertigo, 1994)</ref> This was used in high school health classes and is also reprinted as an addendum to the ''Death: The High Cost of Living'' trade paperback.

===DC Universe===
Death has also made occasional appearances in other DC comic books. She made a controversial appearance in ''[[Captain Atom]]'' #42 (June 1990), appearing as merely ''an aspect'' of death, to the annoyance of Gaiman (see below). [[Keith Giffen]] used the character in several mainline DC stories, including the ''[[Ambush Bug Nothing Special]]'' one-shot (Sep 1992), a brief cameo in ''[[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]]'s Back'' #3 (Oct. 1992), in which she slaps Lobo for getting fresh with her, and she observes the destruction of the Earth in ''[[Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' vol. 4, #38 (Dec 1992). She also appeared in Mike Carey's ''[[Lucifer (DC Comics)|Lucifer]]'' series after the eponymous main character was near-fatally wounded.

''Death of the Endless'' is referenced in the 2009 novel, ''[[he Suicide Club (novel)|The Suicide Club]]'', by [[Rhys Thomas]] ([[Transworld Publishers]]). In it the lead character describes death returning with the sound of beating wings.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

==Other versions==
*Death also appears in a poster in [[Sam Kieth]]'s [[The Maxx]] comic and MTV adaptation. Kieth, the first artist for the series, admitted that he felt as if he didn't fit in with the work and may possibly have left with some resentment, as in The Maxx comic, a character states that "death is hard, and cold. Not some cute chick."
*Death made an appearance in the [[Marvel Universe]], at the wedding of [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] and [[Marlo Chandler]] in an issue of ''[[Hulk (comics)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' (handing Rick a hair brush, the joke being Rick's constant 'brushes with death'). Likewise, she and Dream appeared in a recent issue of New Avengers, lamenting the ''sell'' of Doctor Strange's home. {{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}<ref>New Avengers #28</ref>
*Death made an cameo appearance in the crossover special [[Avengers/JLA]] #2.  She is represented in the [[Grandmaster (DC Comics)|Grandmaster]]'s home base, alongside [[Deadman]], [[Hela (Marvel Comics)|Hela]] and [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] from the Marvel universe.
*Death is also the narrator and host of the [[Paradox Press]] multi-artist volume ''The Big Book of Death'' (1995). She also features in a section of [[Paul Cornell]]'s ''[[Doctor Who]]'' spin-off novel [[Happy Endings (Doctor Who)|Happy Endings]] in a brief cameo, quoting her dialogue from the original ''[[The Books of Magic]]'' mini-series. The section was written by author [[Neil Penswick]], as part of a chapter written in tandem by the authors of the previous 49 novels.<ref>{{Citation|last=Scoones |first=Paul |title=Wedding Notes: An Annotated Guide to Happy Endings |date=November 1996| year=1996| url=http://nzdwfc.tetrap.com/archive/tsv49/endings.html| accessdate=1 December 2008}}</ref>
