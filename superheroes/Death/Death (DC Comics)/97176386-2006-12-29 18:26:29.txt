'''Death''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[DC Comics|DC]] [[comic book]] series, ''[[The Sandman (DC Comics/Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'' ([[1988]] - [[1996]]). She was created by ''Sandman'' writer [[Neil Gaiman]] and given visual life by illustrators [[Mike Dringenberg]] and [[Malcolm Jones III]].

{{spoiler}}

Like most [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[Death (personification)|personifications of death]], Death meets with the recently deceased and guides them into their new existence. Unlike most personifications of [[death]], Death also visits people as they are born, according to [[Destruction (DC Comics)|Destruction]] in the "Sandman Special." Evidently, only she seems to remember these encounters. 

Also, Death is a complete opposite of the traditional English culture personification of death (see [[Grim Reaper]]).  Instead, in ''The Sandman'' Death appears as an attractive, pale, young woman dressed in casual clothes - often a black top and jeans. She also wears a silver [[ankh]] on a chain around her neck, and has a marking similar to the [[eye of Horus]] around her right eye. She is pleasant, down-to-earth, and perky, and has been a nurturing figure for both incarnations of [[Dream (DC Comics)|Dream]]. This strange [[paradox]] has helped make Death one of the most popular characters from ''Sandman''.

Death is the second eldest of [[The Endless (comics)|the Endless]], a family of anthropomorphic beings. Death's realm is not portrayed in detail in the series, except for a brief scene in her 'house' in the ''Sandman Special'', ''Song of [[Orpheus]]'' and later in [[The Books of Magic]] series. This is where she keeps her floppy hat collection, her [[goldfish]] Slim and Wandsworth and possibly her gallery.  A brief glimpse of her realm can also be seen in the first issue of ''[[The Sandman: The Wake|The Wake]]'', where a messenger visits her as she walks in open grasslands.

One day every century, Death lives (and dies) as a mortal, in order to understand the human race.  

Death first appeared in the final chapter of ''Sandman''’s first story arc ''[[The Sandman: Preludes and Nocturnes|Preludes and Nocturnes]]'', "The Sound of Her Wings," where she gave Dream direction and a degree of understanding. Death instantly became very popular to readers and she appears at least briefly in each of the nine subsequent story arcs. However, Gaiman attempted to entice and tease readers by rationing-out the number of appearances from Dream’s family so Death did not appear as frequently as one might expect for such a popular character. At the end of the ninth Sandman story arc ''[[The Sandman: The Kindly Ones|The Kindly Ones]]'', there is a lengthy and noteworthy appearance from Death, in which she finally brings her brother peace.

Death has also been featured in two [[limited series]], ''[[Death: The High Cost of Living]]'' ([[1993]]), and ''[[Death: The Time of Your Life]]'' ([[1996]]). Both were written by Gaiman and illustrated by [[Chris Bachalo]] and dealt with Death’s encounters with various mortals. The [[2003]] [[manga]]-style [[graphic novel]] ''[[Death At Death's Door]]'' portrayed Death’s activities during the fourth Sandman story arc ''[[The Sandman: Season of Mists|Season of Mists]].'' It was written and illustrated by [[Jill Thompson]] and may be part of a series. Death has also made occasional appearances in other DC comic books. 

In ''[[Endless Nights]]'' ([[2003]]) Gaiman shows Death several billion years ago, with a markedly different personality-- forbidding and joyless.  She also appears in ''[[The Books of Magic]]'' (first volume, [[1991]], also written by Gaiman) at the very end of time, where her function is to set things in order and close the universe up.  [[John Ney Rieber]] included her in ''The Books of Magic'' (vol. 2 #3-4), in which she lets [[Timothy Hunter]] hang out at her house and hold her teddy bear, [[Cavendish]], while he is recovering from the venom of the [[Manticore]].  

Death made an appearance in the [[Marvel Universe]], at the wedding of [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] and [[Marlo Chandler]] in an issue of ''[[Hulk (comics)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' (handing Rick a hair brush, the joke being Rick's constant 'brushes with death'). However, this was probably only [[Death (Marvel Comics)|the Death of the Marvel Universe]] assuming a form more appropriate for the occasion, rather than an actual appearance by the DC version.  [[Keith Giffen]] used the character in several DC stories, including ''[[Ambush Bug]] Nothing Special'' #1, a brief cameo in ''[[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]]'s Back'' #3, in which she slaps Lobo for getting fresh with her, and she comes to take [[Superboy]] in the [[retcon]]ned-out ''[[Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' Vol. 4, #38.

Other personifications of Death have appeared in the DC Universe. In ''[[Captain Atom]]'' #42 (also by Giffen) Death appears alongside [[Black Racer]] of the [[New Gods]] and [[Nekron]] (a "god of death" from ''[[Green Lantern]]''). The story stated that all three were equal, representing different aspects of death. Gaiman has refuted this, however, and his stories make it clear that Death of the Endless is the ultimate personification of Death. It might be assumed, however, Nekron, the Racer, and the [[Black Flash]] are connected to her in some way.  A more traditional version of Death appeared as host in such DC titles such as ''[[Weird Mystery Tales]]'', ''[[Secrets of the Haunted House]]'', ''[[Ghosts (comics)|Ghosts]]'', ''[[Weird War Tales]]'' (including being in the story in issue #94) etc.  It is unclear how this [[pre-Crisis]] Death relates to Gaiman's Death, if at all, although her older brother, [[Destiny (DC Comics)|Destiny]], appeared with the character.

== Character Design ==

According to Gaiman, the initial visual design of Death was based on a friend of Dringenberg's named Cinnamon [http://www.holycow.com/dreaming/lore/interview4.html]. From [[The Sandman Companion]]:

<blockquote>Gaiman: "Death is the only major character whose visuals didn't spring from me; that credit goes to [[Mike Dringenberg]]. In my original Sandman outline, I suggested Death look like rock star [[Nico]] in 1968, with the perfect cheekbones and perfect face she has on the cover of her [[Chelsea Girl (album)|Chelsea Girl]] album.<br /> <br />

"But Mike Dringenberg had his own ideas, so he sent me a drawing based on a woman he knew named Cinnamon &mdash; the drawing that was later printed in Sandman 11 &mdash; and I looked at it and had the immediate reaction of, "Wow. That's really cool." Latter that day, [[Dave McKean]] and I went to dinner in [[Chelsea]] at the My Old Dutch Pancake House and the waitress who served us was a kind of vision. She was American, had long black hair, was dressed entirely in black &mdash; black jeans, T-shirt, etc. &mdash; and wore a big silver [[ankh]] on a silver necklace. And she looked exactly like Mike Dringenberg's drawing of Death."</blockquote>

McKean also used a series of professional English models for representations of Death on covers of ''Sandman.'' [http://www.neilgaiman.com/journal/2005/12/whole-post-in-kupu.asp][http://www3.sympatico.ca/nancy.kilpatrick/n_the_goth_bible_corrections.htm]

Despite some rumors, Death is not based on [[Tori Amos]] (who is Gaiman's friend). Rather, [[Delirium (DC Comics)|Delirium]] is. <ref>{{cite book
