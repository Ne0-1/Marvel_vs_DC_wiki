'''Death''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[DC Comics|DC]] [[comic book]] series, ''[[The Sandman (DC Comics Modern Age)|The Sandman]]'' ([[1988]] - [[1996]]). She was created by ''Sandman'' scribe [[Neil Gaiman]] and given visual life by illustrators [[Mike Dringenberg]] and [[Malcolm Jones III]].

{{spoiler}}

Like most [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] personifications of [[death]], Death meets with the recently deceased and guides them into their new existence. Unlike most personifications of [[death]], Death also visits people as they are born, according to [[Destruction (DC Comics)|Destruction]] in the "Sandman Special." Evidently, only she seems to remember these encounters. Death is almost a complete opposite of traditional personifications of death, particularly in English culture, where Death is depicted as an intimidating skeleton in a black robe, bearing a scythe (See [[Grim Reaper]]).  

Instead, Death of the ''Sandman'' series appears as an attractive, although pale, young woman dressed in casual clothes - often a black top and jeans. She also wears a silver [[ankh]] on a chain around her neck. She is pleasant, down-to-earth, and perky and has been a nurturing figure for Sandman’s title character. This strange [[paradox]] has helped make Death one of the most popular characters from ''Sandman''.

Death is the second eldest of [[the Endless]], a family of anthropomorphic beings. Unlike her siblings, Death's realm is not portrayed in the series, except for a brief scene in her 'house' in the ''Sandman Special'', ''Song of [[Orpheus]]''. This is where she keeps her floppy hat collection and her [[goldfish]], Slim and Wandsworth.

Death first appeared in the final chapter of ''Sandman''’s first story arc ''[[The Sandman: Preludes and Nocturnes|Preludes and Nocturnes]]'', where she gave Dream direction and a degree of understanding. Death instantly became very popular to readers and she appears at least briefly in each of the nine subsequent story arcs. However, Gaiman attempted to entice and tease readers by rationing-out the number of appearances from Dream’s family so Death did not appear as frequently as one might expect for such a popular character. At the end of the ninth Sandman story arc ''[[The Sandman: The Kindly Ones|The Kindly Ones]]'', there is a lengthy  and noteworthy appearance from Death, in which she finally brings her brother peace.

Death has also been featured in two [[mini-series]], ''[[Death: The High Cost of Living]]'' ([[1993]]), and ''[[Death: The Time of Your Life]]'' ([[1996]]). Both were written by Gaiman and illustrated by [[Chris Bachalo]] and dealt with Death’s encounters with various mortals. The [[2003]] [[manga]]-style [[graphic novel]] ''[[Death At Death's Door]]'' portrayed Death’s activities during the fourth Sandman story arc ''[[The Sandman: Season of Mists|Season of Mists]].'' It was written and illustrated by [[Jill Thompson]] and may be part of a series. Death has also made occasional appearances in other DC comic books. 

In ''[[Endless Nights]]'' ([[2003]]) Gaiman shows us Death several billion years ago, with a markedly different personality-- forbidding and joyless.  And she appears in ''[[The Books of Magic]]'' (first volume, [[1991]], also written by Gaiman) at the very end of time, where her function is to set things in order and close the universe up.

Despite some rumors, Death is not based on [[Tori Amos]].

Death made an appearance in the [[Marvel Universe]], at the wedding of [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] and [[Marlo Chandler]] in an issue of ''[[Hulk (comics)|The Incredible Hulk]]''. However, this was probably only [[Death (Marvel Comics)|the Death of the Marvel Universe]] assuming a form more appropriate for the occasion, rather than an actual appearance by the DC version.
