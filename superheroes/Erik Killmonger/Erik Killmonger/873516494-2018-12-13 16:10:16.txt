==Fictional character biography==
A native of [[Wakanda]], he was born under the name '''N'Jadaka'''. When [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Ulysses Klaue]] and his mercenaries attacked Wakanda, they [[impressment|press-ganged]] N'Jadaka's father, N'Jobu, into helping them; when Klaue was defeated, his father died and his family was exiled. N'Jadaka ended up in [[Harlem]], [[New York (state)|New York]], nursing a hatred against the supervillain and [[Black Panther (comics)|T'Chaka]], the king who had exiled him. He changed his name to Erik Killmonger and studied at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], desperate to avenge his father's death.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

He eventually contacted King T'Challa and was repatriated back to Wakanda, settling in a village that would later change its name to N'Jadaka Village in his honor. He became a subversive, with dreams of ridding Wakanda of what he termed "[[European colonialism|white]] [[Colonisation of Africa|colonialist]]" cultural influences and return it entirely to its ancient ways.{{issue|date=December 2012}}  He then took advantage of the Black Panther's frequent absences in America with [[Avengers (comics)|the Avengers]] to stage a [[coup d'Ã©tat]], along with [[Baron Macabre]].{{issue|date=December 2012}} He was defeated and killed,<ref>''Jungle Action'' #17 (September 1975)</ref> until the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]] claimed his body.<ref>''Iron Man Annual'' #5 (1982)</ref>

===Resurrection===
Using his rings, the Mandarin was able to amplify the Resurrection Altar and restore Killmonger to life.{{issue|date=December 2012}}  Killmonger returned to his lover and ally, [[Madam Slay]], and the two plotted to kill the Black Panther and return Wakanda to its ancient ways.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

While [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] visited Wakanda, Madam Slay drugged [[War Machine|Jim Rhodes]] and took him prisoner.{{issue|date=December 2012}}  Killmonger appeared to have killed the Black Panther, and blamed Rhodes and Stark, convincing the Wakandans that he could lead them to vengeance.{{issue|date=December 2012}}  The Black Panther returned, revealing that he had faked his death using a [[Life Model Decoy]].  The Black Panther defeated Killmonger.{{issue|date=December 2012}}  The Mandarin recalled his ring, and Killmonger reverted to an inanimate skeleton. Killmonger's followers resurrected him again and he would clash with T'Challa on several other occasions.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

===Wakanda takeover===
In the wake of the sorcerer Reverend Achebe's attempted takeover of Wakanda, with T'Challa absent and control of the country left with his regent [[Everett K. Ross|Everett Ross]], Killmonger tried to gain control of the country via its economy, forcing T'Challa to stop him by nationalizing all foreign companies in Wakanda and cause a run on the stock market. The two foes fought in a vicious ritual combat over the right to rule the country, and Killmonger was finally able to defeat his foe and gain the status of Black Panther for his own. He maintained control of Wakanda for a while and even attempted to inherit T'Challa's Avengers status, but when he underwent the ascension rite needed to cement his position, his body had a severe reaction to the heart-shaped herb that he was required to consume - it was poisonous to all but the royal bloodline. Although it would have been convenient to allow him to die, and be unquestionably entitled to the position of the Black Panther, T'Challa preserved his rival's life.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

Killmonger eventually came out of his coma, thus reclaiming his position as chieftain over Wakanda. He went to New York and contacted [[Kasper Cole]], an inner-city police officer masquerading as the Black Panther to help him with cases, and attempted to gain him as an ally (and one-up T'Challa) by offering him a buffered version of the Panther's heart-shaped herb and help finding his supervisor's kidnapped son. In exchange, he had to drop the Panther identity and take up that of a White Tiger acolyte of the Panther cult, and would owe Killmonger a favor. While Kasper agreed to this, he then used his new herb-enhanced abilities to track down the boy on his own to avoid owing Killmonger an unpayable debt.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

T'Challa is then once again the sole ruler of Wakanda when Killmonger resurfaces and takes control of the neighboring country of Niganda.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol.3 #35 (April 2008)</ref> During a subsequent duel with T'Challa, Killmonger is killed by [[Monica Rambeau]], whom he had previously captured and imprisoned. Killmonger's young son is last seen swearing vengeance against the Black Panther, much like N'Jadaka had done years earlier after the death of his own father.<ref>''Black Panther'' (vol. 3) #38</ref>

Also unlike the comics, his chest is covered with self-inflicted [[scarification]] dots, one for each of his confirmed kills. Seeking revenge for his father's death, and angry at Wakanda's refusal to assist disenfranchised black people around the globe, Killmonger challenges T'Challa for his birth rite to the throne, and apparently defeats him. After becoming King he orders Wakanda's high-tech weapons be sent to marginalized groups in [[London]], [[New York City]] and [[Hong Kong]] to help oppressed people rise up and overthrow the government. He wears a version of T'Challa's energy absorbing suit that, reminiscent of his comic book counterpart, has pronounced fangs and glows gold when being used. At the climax of the film, he is mortally wounded when T'Challa stabs him in the chest with a vibranium spear, dying after watching the sunset over Wakanda.

He has a new costume in the film, different from the comic books. It bears a resemblance to [[Vegeta]]'s costume from the ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' [[anime]] series, which the actor Michael B. Jordan is a fan of.<ref>{{cite news|title=Black Panther's Killmonger May Have Borrowed His Costume From Vegeta|url=https://www.cbr.com/black-panther-killmonger-vegeta-costume/|work=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=22 February 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Michael B.
