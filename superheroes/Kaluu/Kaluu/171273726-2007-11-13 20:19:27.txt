'''Kaluu''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]] and first appeared in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #147 (Aug 1966).  He was created by [[Stan Lee]], [[Jack Kirby]] and [[Don Heck]] and is a powerful mystic, born over five hundred years ago in the mystic city of [[Kamar-Taj]], a village in the [[Himalayan Mountains]] in the land now known as [[Tibet]]. He and the [[Ancient One]] became fellow students of the mystic arts.

==Fictional character biography==
[[Varnae]], the eldest of the true [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampires]], met with Kaluu and imparted to him knowledge from the primeval compendium of black magic known as the [[Darkhold]]. Subsequently, Kaluu set about to make himself ruler of Kamar-Taj. While the Ancient One continued his studies, Kaluu used his sorcery to influence the minds of the people of Kamar-Taj. Eventually, Kaluu and the Ancient One together cast a spell that eliminated disease, poverty, and suffering from Kamar-Taj and granted its people immortality. Shortly thereafter, the people of Kamar-Taj, responding to Kaluu's magical influence on their minds, crowned him as their king. For over a year Kaluu organized the men of Kamar-Taj into an army of conquest. Meanwhile, Kaluu slowly increased his mystic control over the minds of the people of Kamar-Taj so that they become little more than his placid puppets. The Ancient One attempted to warn the people of Kamar-Taj about Kaluu, but Kaluu's magic prevented them from heeding him. Kaluu struck the Ancient One with a magical bolt from behind which paralyzed him. Then Kaluu had his soldiers conquer a neighboring village and reduce it to slavery.

While Kaluu plotted further conquests and the people of Kamar-Taj fell into decadence, the paralyzed Ancient One, whom Kaluu had placed in the public square as an object of ridicule, mentally called upon mystical forces to defeat Kaluu. However, the Ancient One was not yet a master of the mystic arts, and, although he did not intend it, the mystic forces he summoned created a pestilence that wiped out virtually the entire population of Kamar-Taj. Kaluu fled to the dimension of [[Raggador]], where he remained for five centuries, increasing his mystical knowledge. With Kaluu gone, the Ancient One was freed from his paralysis. The population of Kamar-Taj, however, was no longer immortal, and the Ancient One himself would now age, although at a greatly slowed rate.<ref>''Strange Tales'' Vol. 1 #111</ref>

Kaluu continued his studies in the dimension of Raggador, gaining a mastery of magic greater than the Ancient One's, and emerged centuries later to fight both the Ancient One and [[Doctor Strange]], attempting to steal the [[Book of the Vishanti]]. Defeated, he was hurled into suspended animation and his body banished into another dimension.

The forces unleashed in a battle between Doctor Strange and [[Urthona (comics)|Urthona]] eventually freed Kaluu from his imprisonment. When he returned from exile he amassed a large fortune and formed an alliance with the embattled Doctor Strange. He tutored him in the practice of black magic and alongside Strange he battled [[Shuma-Gorath]] and various other ancient evils. He also witnessed doctor Strange's defeat of Shuma-Gorath. 

Kaluu, Strange, [[Rintrah (comics)|Rintrah]], and [[Enitharmon the Weaver]], returned to the Earth dimension where he cast a spell to remove the physical and astral pollution caused by using black magic from Strange.

Kaluu plans to live a quiet, enjoyable life, while living off money he made by influencing the stock market.

==Powers==
According to the back story of the character, Kaluu is possibly the most powerful living human black magician. Kaluu's magic derives not only from personal, universal and dimensional powers: he has powers gained through the tapping of the life forces of living beings and the manipulation of the environment in certain ways that have destructive side effects.

Kaluu has used mystical means to render himself immortal. He does not age, but he can be killed by external means.
