'''Kaluu''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]].  He is a powerful mystic, born over five hundred years ago in the land of [[Kamar-Taj]]. in the [[Himalayan Mountains]] in the land now known as [[Tibet]].  He and the [[Ancient One]] became fellow students of the mystic arts.

Eventually, the two mystics became enemies. The Ancient One took [[Doctor Strange]] as his disciple and successor in the 20th century, and he and Kaluu became enemies as well.
