'''Meggan''' is a [[comic book]] [[superhero]]ine in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe. 

==History==
Born in a blizzard to a [[Roma (people)|Roma]] family, Meggan adapted to the cold by growing fur, to the horror of her family.  Unfortunately, as an empathic [[metamorph]], the more they saw her as a monster, the more monstrous she became, growing webbed hands and feet, antennae, claws, and distorted features.  They hid her away in their camper, where she watched television incessantly.  Eventually she met [[Captain Britain]] and fell in love with him; and after she learned to control her abilities enough to conform to an appearance more in line with the Western populist idea of beauty, he fell in love with her too.  After a long and stormy courtship, they finally married.

Due to her odd upbringing, for many years Meggan was naive in many of the aspects of culture, obsessed with television, and functionally illiterate.  Eventually her [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] teammates taught her to read.  Before she gained control of her powers, she had only fragments of  memory of her early years.

{{spoilers}}
When Roma stepped down and let Captain Britain become the  Omniversal Guardian of the Otherworld, Meggan came to rule beside him as his queen.

Later, the [[Scarlet Witch]] caused a hole in reality when she altered it to create the [[House of M]].  This set off a multidimensional tidal wave, threatening Otherworld and the other parallel realities of the Multiverse.  Meggan and Captain Britain were sent to fix the hole, given only a short amount of time before Saturnyne would destroy the 616 reality to prevent it from hurting the other realities.

Working with Psylocke and [[Rachel Summers]], Meggan and Britain located the hole in reality through which the tidal chaos wave was about to spread. Allowing the others to seal the gap, Meggan ventured into the void beyond and sacrificed herself in order to deflect a large amount of the impacting chaotic energies. Her fate remains unknown.

==Powers and skills==

Meggan is an empathic metamorph: although she can control her appearance, her shape is also dictated by the desires of the people around her.  While she can make free-style changes such as gaining claws or gills or tentacles, she can also make herself into a perfect copy of another person, and the changes run more than skin deep: if she takes on the appearance of another mutant, she also gains their mutant powers.  Her favorite combat form is that of a werewolf.  By drawing extra energy from the earth, she can also gain super strength.  In her true form, she can see and manipulate elemental or magical energy, quenching fires and deflecting spells.  She can also fly.  However, she is very vulnerable to telepathic coercion.  For a while it was mistakenly believed her abilities were localized to Britain, causing her to lose control of her powers if she were away too long; this idea came about after she lost control of her powers during a trip to New York.  However several trips abroad both before and after this diagnosis were made put the lie to it; in the case of the New York trip Meggan had suffered from a demonic possession which was more likely to have been the cause of her loss of control.  In her original, somewhat lupine form, she was also affected by the phases of the moon.
