'''Meggan''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[comic book]] [[superhero]]ine in the [[Marvel Universe|Marvel Comics universe]]. 

==Publication history==
{{Expand|date=September 2008}}
Meggan first appears in [[Marvel UK]]'s ''Mighty World of Marvel'' #7 (December, 1983), and was created by [[Alan Moore]] and [[Alan Davis]].

Her origin story is told in ''Captain Britain'' (vol. 2) #8 (Aug. 1985); this story is later reprinted in the ''Captain Britain'' trade paperback in the U.S.

Meggan's first American appearance is in ''New Mutants Annual'' (vol. 1) #2 (1986).

==Fictional character biography==
Born in a blizzard to a [[Roma (people)|Roma]] family near Fenborough Station in Britain, Meggan adapted to the cold by growing fur, to the horror of her family.  Unfortunately, as an empathic [[metamorph]], the more they saw her as a monster, the more monstrous she became, growing webbing upon her hands and feet, antennae, claws, and distorted features.  The belief that she was some sort of monster was also affected by the fact that Meggan's birth took place near an ancient British fortress that was rumoured to be the site of dark magics.  Meggan's family hid her away in their camper, where she watched television incessantly, totally immersing herself in the fantasy of the various British TV shows of the time (such as [[Gerry Anderson]]'s ones, ''[[Quatermass]]'', ''[[Doctor Who]]'' and many more).  Eventually, she met [[Captain Britain]] and fought him, but then befriended him.<ref>''Mighty World of Marvel'' #14-15 (UK)</ref>  She fell in love with him, joining him as an adventurer.  With him, she first encountered [[Gatecrasher (Marvel Comics)|Gatecrasher]]'s [[Technet (comics)|Technet]].<ref>''Captain Britain'' (vol. 2) #5</ref>  After having been told by a telepath that her inner soul looked as beautiful "as an iridescent butterfly", during combat against a commando of [[R.C.X.]]-controlled "[[Jaspers' Warp|Warpies]]", she stabilized her powers on an attractive form that pleased Brian (and thus pleased her).<ref>''Captain Britain'' (vol. 2) #8</ref>  Captain Britain fell in love right back, and the two began a romantic relationship.  Together, they defeated Baba Yaga.<ref>''Captain Britain'' (vol. 2) #11</ref>  The two had a long and stormy courtship, marred by events both cosmic and mundane.

Meggan then fought Gatecrasher's Technet alongside Captain Britain, [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], [[Rachel Summers|Phoenix]], and [[Kitty Pryde|Shadowcat]], and with them became a founding member of [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]].<ref>''Excalibur Special Edition'' #1</ref> Meggan was later reunited with [[Courtney Ross]].<ref>''Excalibur'' (vol. 1) #1</ref>  Meggan became attracted to Nightcrawler before long.  Excalibur clashed with [[Arcade (comics)|Arcade]] and the [[Crazy Gang (Marvel Comics)|Crazy Gang]], and Meggan temporarily switched bodies with the Crazy Gang's Knave.<ref>''Excalibur'' (vol. 1) #4-5</ref>  Brian could not deal with Nightcrawler's attraction toward Meggan (which was strongly reciprocated) and Meggan later developed a crush on Piotr "Peter" Rasputin, the X-Man Colossus.

Due to her odd upbringing, for many years, Meggan was naive in many of the aspects of culture, obsessed with television and functionally illiterate.  For example, she did not know that [[Doctor Doom]] was such a horrific threat, though she soon learned when he attacked the entire team and attempted to destroy England.{{issue}}

Her [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] teammates, over the years, brought her up to speed with Earthly life and knowledge.  Douglock took a personal effort in being her teacher after he joined the team. In the latter part of the Excalibur series, Meggan became much more self-confident, taking more of a leadership role, changing her costume and being much more threatening.  She used the minimum of force needed, but did not hesitate to scare her adversaries.{{issue}}

When [[Roma (comics)|Roma]] stepped down and let Captain Britain become the Omniversal Guardian of the Otherworld, Meggan came to rule beside him as his queen.  They supervised the origin of another [[Lionheart (comics)|Captain Britain]], who became associated with the Avengers.{{issue}}

Later, the [[Scarlet Witch]] caused a hole in reality when she altered it to create the [[House of M]].  This set off a multidimensional tidal wave, threatening Otherworld and the other parallel realities of the Omniverse.  Meggan and Captain Britain were sent to fix the hole, given only a short amount of time before [[Saturnyne]] would destroy the 616 reality to prevent it from hurting the other realities.  Working with [[Psylocke]] and [[Rachel Summers]], Meggan and Captain Britain located the hole in reality through which the tidal chaos wave was about to spread.  Allowing the others to seal the gap, Meggan ventured into the void beyond and sacrificed herself to briefly slow the progress of the impacting chaotic energies to give Psylocke, Rachel, and Captain Britain time to sew the reality tear.  Her fate remains unknown.{{issue}}

When reality was restored, only a few remembered what had gone on during the House of M.  Captain Britain and the others were among the many who didn't, having only vague memories of the ordeal and believing it to be a dream.  As a result, Britain doesn't know about Meggan's sacrifice and has no idea where she is, leaving him in distress.{{issue}}

After Wisdom releases the dark and evil magics to prevent the Skrull invasion in England, Plotka, a Lord of Hell, tries to make a deal with Captain Britain and reveals what appears to be Meggan in his collection of otherworldly realms.<ref>''Captain Britain and MI13'' #6.</ref>  Captain Britain, knowing it might be merely an illusion states that he can't take the chance of it being real and plunges through the dimensional gate.  After sealing it shut, Plotka informs his underlings that this was merely a dream world and he was delighted that Captain Britain allowed himself to be sealed within it.  Within the dream world, Meggan and Captain Britain live at least several weeks believing it to be reality, though Brian expresses doubts about inconsistencies of the world.  His train of thought on the subject, however, is disrupted when he and Meggan's quiet lunch in Braddock's pub is attacked by his deceased brother [[Jamie Braddock]].<ref>''Captain Britain and MI13'' #7.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Meggan is an immensely powerful superhuman, with three main powers: [[empathy]], [[elemental|elemental powers]] and [[shapeshifting]].  These abilities actually blend together, aspects of one talent affecting the others.  Meggan has been referred to as an "elemental empath", an "empathic metamorph", and an "elemental megamorph".  Meggan's most defining power is her [[empathy]], a talent which enables her to sense the emotions and feelings of living creatures (from people, to animals, to plants) and can broadcast her own feelings to influence other people's emotions.  She can also psionically "see" psychic, natural, and mystical energy [[auras]].  Her empathic powers are highly sensitive, and make her vulnerable to telepathic manipulation.  Her empathy also lets her connect to the "life force" of the Earth itself, which brings up her second power: elemental control.

Thanks to Meggan's empathy, she has a psionic link to the natural forces of the Earth.  By "speaking" to the elements, Meggan can command the environment around her, and her emotional state can affect the local ecosystems.  She can extinguish forest fires with a thought, summon gale force winds or part the waters of a lake with wave of her hand, cause earthquakes in a flash of anger.  Meggan has even been observed causing [[electromagnetic pulse]]s by commanding the magnetic fields around her, freezing opponents by rapidly dropping the air temperature around them, or increasing the powers of elemental mutants (such as increasing the temperature of [[Peter Wisdom]]'s heat blasts).  Meggan has used her elemental powers to affect man-made objects, such as actually making the atoms in a building's roof move apart, creating a hole in the roof that resealed itself (without a trace of ever having a hole) once Meggan passed through (which suggests that Meggan's elemental powers may have a [[psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] quality).  Meggan can focus the elemental energies around her into devastating energy blasts, and draw energy from the Earth and project it in bursts of concussive force.  She has also been observed controlling [[magic (paranormal)|mystical]] energies.  Meggan can also hover and fly, indeed she once commented during a case where she was working undercover that her feet hurt, simply because she was unused to walking anywhere at all, not seeing the point when she could more easily fly.

When combined with her friend Rachel Summers on an alternate Earth filled with magic, Meggan has actually succeeded in bringing the dead back to life. 

Finally, Meggan is a shape-shifter who can alter her form at will and can assume the form of any living creature, even those who only exist in legends.  Meggan has pointed ears in her usual and true forms.  As a newborn infant, she instinctively adopted a fur-covered, somewhat animal-like form in response to the cold weather around her; she retained this form until she discovered her shape-shifting abilities.  She can add to her mass and shed this additional mass at will.  Meggan adopts the special abilities, superhuman powers, and even aspects of the internal anatomy of whatever being she uses her metamorphic powers to imitate.  She once became a [[Godzilla]]-like fire-breathing dragon, and another occasion she became a [[werewolf]] that had all of a wolf's natural abilities.  Meggan can assume the form of other people as well.  Her facial features and overall physical appearance often change to a degree with her mood.  Thanks to her empathy, Meggan's body will actually change in response to the emotions around her, becoming beautiful when she feels loved, or hideous when she feels fear or anger, or she might become considerably less attractive when deeply depressed.  She can also sense the images of what other people desire her to be like.  Due to her empathic nature, she may consciously or unconsciously alter her appearance to resemble people or even animals she is with at the time.  Her elemental powers also cause Meggan to change in response to her surroundings, growing fur in extreme cold, or gills when she is submerged or [[swimming]] [[underwater]].  This can be affected by outside forces if she is not careful, causing her to turn into one shape when she intended to turn into another.

She can increase the density of her muscle tissue to boost her strength to superhuman levels, shown capable of exceeding that of Captain Britain on two separate occasions.<ref>''Excalibur'' (vol. 1) #22-23</ref>  The use of this power is tied to the planet itself.  During her confrontation with Galactus during the original Excalibur run, she grew in stature to match the planet-eater's size, but the taller she grew, the more she was destabilizing the environment nearby.

On occasion, she has successfully mimicked the powers of other superhumans.  In one case copying [[Dazzler]], [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], [[Longshot]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]],  [[Rachel Summers]], and [[Havok (X-Men)|Havok]] in rapid succession.<ref>''Excalibur'' (vol. 1) #19</ref>  She has also transformed herself into sentient sand or water, attaining the associated properties.

Meggan's life force and superhuman powers were at a time, dependent upon the mystical forces within the British Isles.  Her powers and health would deteriorate if she remained for too long a time outside Britain.  However, her health and superhuman powers will function in certain magical realms and other dimensions.

Meggan is a fair hand-to-hand combatant, trained by Captain Britain.  She received no formal education, and is completely self-taught about contemporary culture through television viewing.
