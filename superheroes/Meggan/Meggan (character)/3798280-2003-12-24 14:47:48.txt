'''Meggan''' is a comic book superhero in the Marvel Comics universe. 

==History==
Born in a blizzard to a gypsy family, Meggan adapted to the cold by growing fur, to the horror of her family.  Unfortunately, as an empathic [[metamorph]], the more they saw her as a monster, the more monstrous she became, growing webbed hands and feet, antennae, claws, and distorted features.  They hid her away in their camper, where she watched television incessantly.  Eventually she met [[Captain Britain]] and fell in love with him; and after she learned to control her abilities enough to look beautiful, he fell in love with her too.  After a long and stormy courtship, they finally married.

Due to her odd upbringing, for many years Meggan was naive, obsessed with television, and functionally illiterate.  Eventually her [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] teammates taught her to read.  Before she gained control of her powers, she had only fragments of long-term memory.

==Powers and skills==
Meggan is an empathic metamorph: although she can control her appearance, her shape is also dictated by the desires of the people around her.  While she can make free-style changes such as gaining claws or gills or tentacles, she can also make herself into a perfect copy of another person, and the changes run more than skin deep: if she takes on the appearance of another mutant, she also gains their mutant powers.  Her favorite combat form is that of a werewolf.  By drawing extra energy from the earth, she can also gain super strength.  In her true form, she can see and manipulate elemental or magical energy, quenching fires and deflecting spells.  She can also fly.  However, she is very vulnerable to telepathic coercion.  Her abilities are normally localized to Britain; if she goes abroad for too long a time, she completely loses control of her abilities.  Her costume acts as an antenna, allowing her to retain her powers no matter how far she goes from Britain.  Before she learned to control her abilities, she was also affected by the phases of the moon.
