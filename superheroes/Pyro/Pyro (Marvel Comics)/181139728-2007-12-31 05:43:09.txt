'''Pyro''' ('''St. John Allerdyce''') was a [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain]] and an enemy of the [[X-Men]]. Created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist/co-writer [[John Byrne]], he first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #141 ([[1981#January|January 1981]]).

==Fictional character biography==
Born in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], Pyro is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who possesses the power to psionically control fire and flame, though not generate it.  He wears a flame thrower on his back to provide the flame which he then takes control of.  His ability to manipulate flame emerged in his teens, but he was unable to find a practical use for it.  After years of working in Southeast [[Asia]] as a journalist and novelist, Pyro met the mutant [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], who later recruited him to the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #141-142</ref> Though he never served under the team's original leader, [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], Pyro did work with the Brotherhood under the command of several of Magneto's subordinates who alternately supervised the group. 

Mystique's Brotherhood later offered its services to the United States government in exchange for protection and an official pardon for its crimes, and was renamed [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]].  During Freedom Force's final mission in [[Iraq]], the team confronts group of Iraqi operatives known as [[Desert Sword]]. There are fatalities on both sides. Silver Sabre is decapitated and Pyro kills the Sword operative 'Veil'. Ultimately Freedom Force is defeated and Pyro and the [[Blob_%28comics%29|Blob]] are captured and forced to serve as bodyguards to the country's military commanders. Later, the [[Toad_%28comics%29|Toad]] buys their release and added them to his new Brotherhood. Pyro swiftly returns to battling the X-Men.

Some years later, Pyro contracted the [[Legacy Virus]], a fatal disease affecting mainly mutants. He went to great lengths to find a cure (encountering [[Cecilia Reyes]] at one point), several times at the expense of others, but was unsuccessful in his search and succumbed to the virus. This was just after saving [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Robert Kelly]] from a new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. This act of heroism was also instrumental in changing Senator Kelly's opinion on mutants as a whole, and led to his decision to work toward peaceful co-existence between humans and mutants. Unfortunately, the Senator was shot and killed soon after by a human-supremacist.

Though Pyro is listed as Australian in numerous books, including the ''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'', several books mistakenly note him as English or British, such as ''Days of Future Past''.

==Powers and abilities==
Pyro's power is the psionic ability to manipulate flame by shaping it as he desires, increasing or decreasing its heat, intensity, and size. He cannot actually create fire himself, however, and consequently wears a costume with a built-in [[flamethrower]]  (in ''[[X2 (film)|X2: X-Men United]]'' the teenage Pyro simply carries a small [[Zippo|Zippo lighter]] with him at all times, though in ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' he gains a flame thrower device attached to his arm). He can psionically manipulate the flame to do whatever he desires, and sometimes induces it to take semi-solid form as an animate flame being (these creations, though capable of movement and of grasping or carrying solid objects, are not alive and do not think or act on their own). The degree of Pyro's concentration necessary to manipulate a flame being is directly proportional to the being's size, power, and flame. 

Though he cannot be burned by a flame which he is manipulating, Pyro can be harmed by any fire that he does not mentally control. It is generally accepted that he must be able to see a flame in order to take control of it (hence limiting his mental influence to approximately 100 meters).

The [[Age of Apocalypse]] version of Pyro was able to generate flames without external assistance, but would burn his own body if he did so. This was apparently a result of genetic modifications by [[Dark Beast]] (the evil, AoA version of the X-Men's [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], who in that reality was a subordinate of [[Mister Sinister]]).

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the '''[[Age of Apocalypse]]''', Pyro is one of the many mutants imprisoned in [[Mister Sinister|Sinister's]] Breeding Pens for refusing to join his Elite Mutant Force. He is killed alongside [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]], Artemis, Phantazia, and Newt when the five prisoners attempt to escape. This version of Pyro is capable of creating flames by himself, though he is not immune to them.

===House of M===
In the '''[[House of M]]''', Pyro was a member of the mutant supremacist government in Australia alongside [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]]. He works closely with [[Vanisher]] in the oppresion of the human population. They gain the attention of the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] when his friends, a tribe of Aborigines, are harassed.  Here Pyro retains his background as a writer and a sentimental side; he briefly crafts a tiny pixie out of the flame from a match, commenting to the Vanisher, "I used to write Gothic romances.  I've got more layers than a parfait".

===Marvel Adventures===
In Marvel Adventures Spider-Man, the Human Torch shows up at Midtown High for a demonstration, but loses control of his powers. Spider-Man (Then Peter Parker) spots a mysterious figure who turns out to be Pyro, who is manipulating Human Torch out of jealousy that he doesn't get credit for being a fire manipulator. Peter knocks him into the school swimming pool, where Human Torch knocks him out.

===Marvel Zombies===
Pyro is shown as a zombie twice in this reality. He is seen in the background along with a group of zombies trying to catch the [[Blob (comics)|Blob]]. He is also seen fighting the X-Men alongside zombie versions of [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]].

===Ronin===
Pyro works as a murderous mutant ninja for the Japanese based [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]. He battles the X-Men alongside fellow ninjas [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] and [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]].

===Ultimate Marvel===
In ''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'' #80 Pyro is seen fighting the [[Friends of Humanity]] and meeting [[Nightcrawler (comics)#Ultimate Nightcrawler|Nightcrawler]]. This Pyro is a member of the Ultimate [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]], and a supporter of Xavier's cause who tells Nightcrawler that he would have liked to have been a member of the X-Men. In issue #82 he is rescued from a [[Sentinels (comics)#Ultimate Universe|Sentinel]] attack by [[Bishop (comics)#Ultimate Bishop|Bishop]] and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Storm|Storm]], who recruit him as a member of their new team of X-Men. It is hinted by Bishop that the recruits are "legends" of the future, meaning that Pyro may have much potential. He is currently working undercover in the Mutant Liberation Front, after pretending to defect to their side.  Stryfe, the leader of the group, revealed his knowledge of Pyro's intentions but allows him to continue watching, but eventually Stryfe abandons most of the Front, including Pyro, at the mercy of some approaching Sentinels.  Pyro is later rescued by Beast, and aids the team in defeating the Sentinels.

This version of Pyro, like his AOA counterpart, can generate flames without the aid of machines. He also isn’t as resistant to fire, as his face is horribly burned and most of his body is bandaged. At one point, he cauterizes a bullet wound by pressing flames against it. Because he burnt off his nerves, he does not feel pain.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Pyro appeared in the original X-Men animated [[television pilot|pilot episode]], "[[Pryde of the X-Men]]" voiced by [[Pat Fraley]]. He was correctly identified as Australian.
* He also appeared in four episodes of the 1990s [[X-Men (TV series)|''X-Men'' animated series]] (although he only had lines in three) as part of Mystique's Brotherhood of Mutants, and was incorrectly characterised as British, using British slang terms such as "old bean" and "old girl" in conversation. 
* Pyro also appeared in the ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'' series as part of Magneto's elite team (also known as the Acolytes) where he is voiced by [[Trevor Devall]] in a broken Australian accent. Interestingly, this Pyro seems to need a constant stream of flame to sustain his power, as on more than one occasion when his flamethrower is interfered with any flames already conjured fade out - however, he has also been shown controlling fire creations without a constant stream. The inconsistency is unexplained.

===Film===
* Pyro had a brief [[cameo appearance|cameo]] in ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'', played by Alexander Burton, where he forms a fireball behind his back before [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] freezes it with his powers.

* In the sequel, ''[[X2 (film)|X2: X-Men United]]'', Pyro was played by [[Aaron Stanford]] and his role was greatly expanded. Pyro is named '''John Allerdyce''' (instead of St. John), and is a teenager at Professor X's school and a friend of Iceman and Rogue. Midway through ''X2'' when the three of them, with [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], escape an attack on the school and retreat to Drake's home in suburban [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], Pyro is shown examining a series of Drake family photos with an expression of envy; the commentary hints that this is because he comes from a dysfunctional home. Ultimately, Pyro is tempted away from Xavier's influence by [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], who observes the young man's ambition and the strength of his powers. Pyro follows and joins Magneto and the shapeshifting mutant [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] as they escape; the remaining X-Men note Pyro's defection but are too occupied with their own escape to act on it.

* Pyro subsequently appears in ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' as a member of Magneto's Brotherhood of Mutants.  In the final battle, he fights Iceman and briefly gains the upper hand; however, Iceman turns himself into solid ice and freezes Pyro's hands, extinguishing his fire. Iceman then headbutts Pyro, knocking him out. Pyro's fate is unknown, although the novelization describes Drake carrying him to safety as the facility around them collapses. His loyalty to Magneto is also firmly established, and he remarks that if Magneto asked it of him, he'd kill Professor Xavier for him.

===Video games===
* Pyro is also the boss of the first stage in the [[X-Men (arcade game)|X-Men arcade game]]; and after that, is cloned in various duplicates - from 4 to 12 duplicates, depending of the number of players playing the game - in the middle of stage 6.

* He has appeared as a boss in ''[[X-Men: The Official Game]]'' during Iceman's level.

* Pyro appears as a boss enemy in ''[[X-Men Legends]]'' voiced by [[Robin Atkin Downes]]. He is a member of the Brotherhood who serves as one of the first bosses of the game. [[Shadow King]] also has a Dark Pyro when the X-Men were on the Astral Plane.

* Pyro also appears as a non-playable character in the sequel ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]'' voiced by [[John Kassir]]. He has been captured by Apocalypse after betraying his cause. He is a playable character in the PC version.
