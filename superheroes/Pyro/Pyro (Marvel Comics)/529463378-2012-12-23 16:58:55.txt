'''Pyro''' ('''Saint-John Allerdyce''') is a [[fiction]]al [[character (arts)|character]] in [[Marvel Comics]] and an enemy of the [[X-Men]]. Created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist/co-writer [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], he first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #141 ([[1981 in comics#January|January 1981]]).

In ''[[X2 (film)|X2: X-Men United]]'' and ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'',  Pyro was played by [[Aaron Stanford]].

==Fictional character biography==
Born in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], Pyro is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who possesses the power to psionically control fire and flame, though not generate it.  He wears a flame thrower on his back to provide the flame which he then takes control of.  His ability to manipulate flame emerged in his teens, but he was unable to find a practical use for it.  After years of working in Southeast [[Asia]] as a journalist and novelist, Pyro met the mutant [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], who later recruited him to the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] as a professional criminal and [[subversive]]. With the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, he attempted to assassinate Senator [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Robert Kelly]], and first battled the [[X-Men]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #141-142</ref> With the Brotherhood, he later battled the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]],<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #10</ref> and then the X-Men again.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #177-178</ref> Though he never served under the team's original leader, [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], Pyro did work with the Brotherhood under the command of several of Magneto's subordinates who alternately supervised the group.

Mystique's Brotherhood later offered the team's services to the United States government in exchange for protection and an official pardon for its crimes, and was renamed [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]]. As part of their first mission, the team captured Magneto.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #199</ref> With Freedom Force, he next captured the Avengers on behalf of the federal government.<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #15</ref> Later, he clashed with the original [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] in seeking to arrest [[Rusty Collins]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #8-10</ref> With Freedom Force, he fought the X-Men in Dallas, and was present at the X-Men's [[Fall of the Mutants|apparent demise]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #223-227</ref> With Freedom Force, he battled [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey|Marvel Girl]],<ref>''X-Factor'' #30-31</ref> sought to arrest Rusty Collins again, battled the [[New Mutants]], and finally arrested both Rusty and [[Skids (comics)|Skids]].<ref>''New Mutants'' #78-80</ref> He and [[Blob (comics)|Blob]] under [[Spiral (comics)|Spiral]]'s orders attempted to capture a young mutant girl named Amanda, but were defeated by [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]].<ref>''Daredevil'' Vol. 1 #269</ref> He later teamed with Blob and [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]] against the Avengers during the "[[Acts of Vengeance]]".<ref>''Avengers'' #312</ref>

During Freedom Force's final mission, the team confronts a group of Iraqi operatives known as [[Desert Sword]] in Kuwait. There are fatalities on both sides. [[Super Sabre (comics)|Super Sabre]] is decapitated and Pyro kills the Sword operative [[Veil (comics)|Veil]]. Ultimately Freedom Force is defeated and Pyro and [[Blob (comics)|Blob]] are abandoned in Kuwait and captured.<ref>''New Mutants Annual'' #11; ''New Warriors Annual'' #11; ''Uncanny X-Men Annual'' #15; ''X-Factor Annual'' #6</ref> Blob and Pyro are forced to serve as bodyguards to the country's military commanders.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Later, [[Toad (comics)|Toad]] buys their release.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Blob and Pyro join the Toad's new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, and with them battled [[X-Force]].<ref>''X-Force'' #6-7</ref>

Some years later, Pyro contracted the [[Legacy Virus]], a fatal disease affecting mainly mutants.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} He went to great lengths to find a cure (encountering [[Cecilia Reyes]] at one point<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #351</ref>), several times at the expense of others, but was unsuccessful in his search and succumbed to the virus.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} This was just after saving [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Robert Kelly]] from a new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. This act of heroism was also instrumental in changing Senator Kelly's opinion on mutants as a whole, and led to his decision to work toward peaceful co-existence between humans and mutants.<ref>''Cable vol. 2' #87</ref>

Despite his heroic death, Pyro is resurrected by means of the [[Techno-organic virus#The Transmode Virus|Transmode Virus]] to serve as part of [[Selene (comics)|Selene]]'s army of deceased mutants.  Under the control of Selene and [[Eli Bard]], he takes part in the assault on the mutant nation of [[Utopia (comics)|Utopia]].<ref name ="XNecrosha">''X-Necrosha'' #1, December 2010</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Pyro is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who has the psionic ability to manipulate flame by shaping it as he desires, increasing or decreasing its heat, intensity, and size. He cannot actually create fire himself, however, and consequently wears a specially insulated costume with a built-in [[flamethrower]] that can throw a stream of flame a maximum distance of {{convert|25|ft|m}}. He can psionically manipulate the flame to do whatever he desires, and sometimes induces it to take semi-solid form as an animate flame being (these creations, though capable of movement and of grasping or carrying solid objects, are not alive and do not think or act on their own). The degree of Pyro's concentration necessary to manipulate a flame being is directly proportional to the being's size, power, and flame.

Though he cannot be burned by a flame which he is manipulating, Pyro can be harmed by any fire that he does not mentally control. It is generally accepted that he must be able to see a flame in order to take control of it (hence limiting his mental influence to approximately 100 yards). Any of Pyro's fiery creations will immediately revert to ordinary flame if he turns his interest from it.

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the '''[[Age of Apocalypse]]''', Pyro is one of the many mutants imprisoned in [[Mister Sinister|Sinister's]] breeding pens for refusing to join his Elite Mutant Force. He is killed alongside [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]], [[Fatale (comics)|Artemis]], [[Phantazia]], and Newt when the five prisoners attempt to escape. This version of Pyro is capable of creating flames by himself, though he is not immune to being burned.<ref>''Factor X'' #1</ref>

===House of M===
In the '''[[House of M]]''', Pyro was a member of the mutant supremacist government in Australia. He works alongside the powerful [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]]. He works closely with [[Vanisher]] in the oppression of the human population. They gain the attention of the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] when his friends, a community of Aboriginal Australians, are harassed. Here Pyro retains his background as a writer and a sentimental side; he briefly crafts a tiny pixie out of the flame from a match, commenting to the Vanisher, "I used to write Gothic romances. I've got more layers than a parfait".<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 3 #83-85</ref>

===Marvel Adventures===
In [[Marvel Adventures Spider-Man]], the [[Human Torch]] shows up at Midtown High for a demonstration, but loses control of his powers. [[Spider-Man]] (then Peter Parker) spots a mysterious figure who turns out to be Pyro, who is manipulating Human Torch out of jealousy that he doesn't get credit for being a fire manipulator. Peter knocks him into the school swimming pool, where Human Torch knocks him out.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

===Marvel Zombies===
Pyro is shown as a zombie twice in the [[Marvel Zombies]] reality. He is seen in the background along with a group of zombies trying to catch [[Blob (comics)#Marvel Zombies|Blob]].<ref>''Marvel Zombies vs Army of Darkness'' #2</ref> He is also seen fighting the X-Men alongside zombie versions of [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]].{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

===Ronin===
Pyro works as a murderous mutant ninja for the Japanese based [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]. He battles the X-Men alongside fellow ninjas [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] and [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

===Ultimate Pyro===
In ''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'' #80 Pyro is seen fighting the [[Friends of Humanity]] and meeting [[Nightcrawler (comics)#Ultimate Nightcrawler|Nightcrawler]].<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #80</ref> This Pyro is a member of the Ultimate [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]], and a supporter of [[Alternative versions of Professor X#Ultimate Charles Xavier|Xavier]]'s cause who tells Nightcrawler that he would have liked to have been a member of the X-Men. In issue #82 he is rescued from a [[Sentinel (comics)#Ultimate Sentinels|Sentinel]] attack by [[Bishop (comics)#Ultimate Bishop|Bishop]] and [[Alternative versions of Storm#Ultimate Storm|Storm]], who recruit him as a member of their new team of X-Men. It is hinted by Bishop that the recruits are "legends" of the future, meaning that Pyro may have much potential. He briefly works undercover in the Mutant Liberation Front, after pretending to defect to their side.  [[Stryfe]], the leader of the group, revealed his knowledge of Pyro's intentions but allows him to continue watching, but eventually Stryfe abandons most of the Front, including Pyro, at the mercy of some approaching Sentinels. Pyro is later rescued by [[Alternative versions of Beast#Ultimate Beast|Beast]], and aids the team in defeating the Sentinels.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #87</ref>

Bishop dies in ''Ultimate X-Men'' #90 and Xavier returns alive from the future. Pyro moves into the Xavier Institute and becomes one of Xavier's X-Men. Pyro begins wondering if he belongs at the Institute and [[Alternative versions of Wolverine#Ultimate Marvel|Wolverine]] assures him that he does.{{Issue|date=March 2011}}

Pyro has apparently defected from the Xavier Institute to [[Alternative versions of Magneto#Ultimate Magneto|Magneto]]'s [[Brotherhood of Mutants#Ultimate Brotherhood|Brotherhood of Mutants]], as he and [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]] are shown capturing the superhero [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Valkyrie|Valkyrie]] in ''[[Ultimates#The Ultimates 3|The Ultimates 3]]'' #4.  It is as yet unknown how or why Pyro joined Magneto's Brotherhood. His face is not scarred and he is now immune to flame, despite previous portrayals.<ref>''The Ultimates 3'' #4</ref>

During the confrontation, he and Mastermind find the unconscious Valkyrie. Pyro suggest they 'play' with her. The woman wakes up, slays Mastermind and despite Pyro's claims of innocence, cuts off his hands.<ref>''The Ultimates 3'' #5</ref>

Ultimate Pyro, like his Age of Apocalypse counterpart, can generate flames without the aid of machines. He also isn’t as resistant to fire, as his face is horribly burned and most of his body is bandaged. At one point, he cauterizes a bullet wound by pressing flames against it. Because he burnt off his nerves, he does not feel pain.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #80</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
* Pyro appeared in the original X-Men animated [[television pilot|pilot episode]], "[[X-Men: Pryde of the X-Men]]" voiced by [[Pat Fraley]]. He was identified as Australian.
[[Image:PyroandAvalanche.jpg|200k|thumb|right|Pyro (right) in ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men: The Animated Series]]'' along with [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]].]]
* He also appeared in four episodes of the 1990s [[X-Men (TV series)|''X-Men'' animated series]] (although he only had lines in three) as part of Mystique's Brotherhood of Mutants, and was characterized as British, using stereotypical British slang terms such as "old bean" and "old girl" in conversation. He was voiced by Graham Halley.
* Pyro also appeared in the ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'' series as part of Magneto's elite team (also known as the [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]]) where he is voiced by [[Trevor Devall]] and has a heavy Australian accent. Interestingly, this Pyro seems to need a constant stream of flame to sustain his power, as on more than one occasion when his flamethrower is interfered with any flames already conjured fade out - however, he has also been shown controlling fire creations without a constant stream.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} This incarnation of Pyro is somewhat disturbing and seems to enjoy what he does (as he laughs hysterically while watching Magneto's "death" at the hands of Apocalypse over and over). He also appears to enjoy scaring people. In "Cajun Spice", while Wolverine confronts Pyro, it is revealed Pyro gets real pleasure out of combat.<ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A85uXH5FHU0</ref>
* Pyro appears in the animated TV series ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'', voiced by [[Nolan North]]. He first appeared as a captive of the [[Mutant Response Division]]. He and others are freed by Wolverine.<ref>''Wolverine e os X-Men (Wolverine and the X-Men)'' Ep. 1 - "Hindsight Pt. 1"</ref> He is then shown as a member of Magneto's Acolytes living in [[Genosha]]. In the episode "Battle Lines," Pyro and [[Senyaka]] are sent to MRD Facility Beta in the Northwest to break out several mutants. In the episode "Hunting Grounds," Polaris mentions to Magneto that Pyro informed her of [[Scarlet Witch]]'s disappearance. While the other Acolytes search for Nightcrawler and Scarlet Witch, Magneto places Pyro in Nightcrawler's special cell stating to Pyro that he has done enough.
* Pyro appears in ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]'' episode "A Brat Walks Among Us" voiced by [[Steven Blum]].<ref>[http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0907/28/voices.htm MARVEL SUPER HERO SQUAD VOICE CAST]</ref> He assists [[Zzzax]] into attacking Super Hero City only to be defeated by [[Heroes for Hire]] and end up remanded to the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]]. He later appeared in the episode "The Ice Melt Cometh" as a member of Team Toxic who end up melting the polar ice caps and flood the Earth.

===Film===
[[Image:X-Men Movie Pyro.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Aaron Stanford as Pyro in ''X-Men: The Last Stand'']]
* Pyro had a brief [[cameo appearance|cameo]] in ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'', where he forms a [[:wikt:fireball|fireball]] behind his back before [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] freezes it with his powers. He is identified by Storm as "John". In this film and the two following sequels, Pyro is portrayed as an American teenager instead of Australian.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Here he is played by Alexander Burton.

* In the sequel, ''[[X2 (film)|X2: X-Men United]]'', Pyro was played by [[Aaron Stanford]] and his role was greatly expanded. Director Bryan Singer allowed Stanford to portray the character without having to dye his hair blond{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} (like it appeared in the comics). Pyro is named '''John Allerdyce''' (instead of St. John), and is a student at Professor X's school and has become a friend of Iceman and [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]]. Instead of a flamethrower, this version of Pyro keeps a [[Zippo|Zippo lighter]] on him at all times to provide him his fire, and habitually flicks it open and shut (the Zippo sports a cartoon shark on it as a reference to one of Singer's favorite films, ''Jaws''). Midway through ''X2'' when the three of them, with [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], escape an attack on the school and retreat to Drake's home in suburban [[Boston]], Pyro is shown examining a series of Drake family photos with an expression of envy; the commentary hints that this is because he comes from a dysfunctional home. After Wolverine is shot in the head by a policeman, Pyro flies into a rage, fends off several policemen and incinerates multiple squad cars, defending his friends. Rogue sees that Pyro is endangering the lives of the officers. She steals his powers, stunning him and neutralizing the flames. After that Pyro gives Rogue a threat and disappears. The group are rescued by other X-Men. Ultimately, Pyro is tempted away from Xavier's influence by [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], who observes the young man's ambition and the strength of his powers. Pyro follows and joins Magneto and the shapeshifting mutant [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] as they escape; the remaining X-Men note Pyro's defection but are too occupied with their own escape to stop it. On the official website for X2 under Pyro's Cerebro file it stated Pyro has family in Australia—a nod to the comic book character's origin.

* Pyro subsequently appears in ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' as a member of Magneto's Brotherhood of Mutants. He is again played by [[Aaron Stanford]]. In this film, Pyro has bleached his hair blonde like in the comics, and wears a flame-generating device on his right wrist, allowing him to produce fire for combat by pushing a button on his palm with his fingers. Alongside Magneto's army, he attacks a facility that provides the cure for mutants. In the final battle, he fights Iceman and briefly gains the upper hand; however, Iceman turns himself into solid ice and freezes Pyro's hands, extinguishing his fire. Iceman then headbutts Pyro, knocking him out. Pyro's fate is unknown, although the novelization describes Iceman carrying him to safety as the facility around them collapses. He also views Magneto as a father figure and remarks that if Magneto had given him the chance, he would have killed Professor Xavier. However, Magneto became very agitated at Pyro's words, and firmly told him that Xavier did more for mutants than Pyro will ever know, and that he never wanted Xavier to die.

===Video games===

* Pyro also appears as a non-playable character in the sequel ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]'' voiced by [[John Kassir]]. He has been captured by Apocalypse after betraying his cause. After being freed as a side mission, the player tells Pyro to escape to Magneto's sanctuary. He is a playable character in the PC version. Pyro has special dialogue with [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] (when Pyro is trapped in a machine) and [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]] (before the battle with [[Abyss (comics)|Abyss]]).

* Pyro appeared as a boss in ''[[X-Men: The Official Game]]'' during Iceman's level, voiced by [[Steve Van Wormer]].
