The '''Gotham City Police Department''' ('''GCPD''') is a fictional [[police]] department appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. Led by [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]], the GCPD services [[Gotham City]] and is typically depicted in stories featuring the [[superhero]] [[Batman]].

{{TOC limit|3}}

==History of GCPD==
===Police corruption===
Acting as both ally and opponent of [[Batman]], the superhero long-established in Gotham, the GCPD has long been steeped in police corruption, with numerous officers both high-and-low ranking involved in bribery and even more serious offenses such as drug-smuggling and murder.

The strongest blow against police corruption came when an increasing amount of conspiracy charges against [[Gillian B. Loeb|Commissioner Gillian B. Loeb]] forced him to [[resign]] his position, replaced by Peter Grogan. The Falcone crime family, which has had a stranglehold on Gotham's underground for generations, finally crumbled when a series of killings shook the structure of the mafia organization. After the death of [[Carmine Falcone]], the mob lashed out in sloppy, retaliatory crimes which, in combination with rising gang violence, severely crippled organized crime in Gotham City. Simultaneously, the ebbing presence of corrupt police officers allowed [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]] to become the new commissioner, a man determined to eradicate crime wherever it existed.

The GCPD has had a long [[love-hate relationship]] with the city's vigilante known as [[Batman]]. Commissioner Gordon went along with him because Batman got the job done. His successor, Commissioner Michael Akins ordered the arrest of Batman and had the [[Bat-signal]] removed from the roof of [[Gotham Central]]. Corruption and rot within the police department also rose during Akins' tenure as Commissioner.

===Current status===
As of DC's ''One Year Later'', James Gordon has been reinstated as Commissioner, along with [[Harvey Bullock (comics)|Harvey Bullock]]. Harvey came back on disciplinary probation after helping expose a criminal drug ring. Relations with Batman, including the Bat-Signal, have been established once more. Other characters from ''[[Gotham Central]]'' have appeared in the recent ''[[Tales of the Unexpected (comics)|Tales of the Unexpected]]'' miniseries, featuring [[Crispus Allen]] as the [[Spectre (comics)#Crispus Allen|Spectre]]. Thus far, Detective Driver has appeared in a speaking role. It is unknown what has happened to Commissioner Akins, but it is implied that, following revelations of massive corruption within the department, there has been a drastic cleaning-of-house within the department.

[[Batwoman|Kate Kane]] referred to Akins as police commissioner in the weekly ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' series, which reveals the events of the missing year. A later issue, however, showed a brief snapshot of Commissioner Gordon's welcome back party. The circumstances of Akins's departure and Gordon's reinstatement have yet to be explained. [[Maggie Sawyer]] is still the commander of the MCU department, and has ended her relationship with former lover Toby Raines.

==Divisions and personnel==
{{catseealso|Gotham City Police Department officers}}

===Homicide Division===
'''Homicide Division''': The division that handles murders and some of the more serious non-[[metahuman]] crimes in Gotham. This is the division Gordon was a part of before becoming commissioner. Former private investigator [[Jason Bard]] is now working on homicide cases for this division.

===Commissioners===
(In tenure list)
*'''Commissioner McKeever''' — He is mentioned in ''[[Batman: The Black Mirror]]'' (''Detective Comics'' #875; May 2011). At this time James Gordon is still Lieutenant.
* '''Commissioner Gillian B. Loeb''' — The corrupt commissioner of police during the first year of Batman’s operation in Gotham.
* '''Commissioner Peter Jack Edward "Petey" Grogan''' - was formally the Corrupt Deputy Commissioner under Gillian B. Loeb who was appointed as acting commissioner after Loeb's forced exit he was then made the Commissioner of the Gotham City Police Department and was described as being more corrupt than his predecessor.  He was dismissed and was later replaced with Commissioner James Gordon. He was mentioned in the last page of Miller's ''[[Batman: Year One]]'' and has a one panel appearance in the ''Catwoman Year One Annual'' and also in ''[[Batman: The Man Who Laughs]]'' and ''[[Batman and the Monster Men]]'' #1.
* '''Commissioner James Worthington Gordon Sr.''' — Replaced Grogan and worked with Batman in trying to clean up the Gotham police department. When he retired, he handed the GCPD over to Michael Akins, only to take the job back some years later. Gordon is the father of Barbara Gordon, the original Batgirl and later Oracle.
* '''Commissioner Vane''' - Former Chief Inspector, only served as commissioner briefly when Gordon was demoted to patrolman in ''Detective Comics'' #121. During his brief tenure, he oversaw [[Dr. Hurt]]'s experiments.
* '''Commissioner Peter Pauling''' — Another corrupt commissioner, appointed by Mayor [[Hamilton Hill (comics)|Hamilton Hill]]. Like Hill, he was working for Rupert Thorne. Pauling issued a shoot-to-kill order for any police officer who spotted Batman, and secretly tried to have Gordon, who was working as a private detective, killed. Pauling eventually died at Thorne's hands and a desperate Mayor Hill re-instated Commissioner Gordon. Pauling may not have existed in the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths#Post-Crisis|Post-Crisis]] DC universe.
* '''Commissioner Sarah Essen Gordon''' — The wife of James Gordon, appointed Commissioner by Mayor Krol while her husband was demoted. This put a great strain on her relationship with her husband and they split up for a while. Although she had previously been a critic of the Batman, she agreed to Mayor Krol's instructions that she use him. Mayor Krol sacked her after he lost his re-election bid against Marion Grange, replacing her with Andy Howe.
* '''Commissioner Andy Howe''' — A lawyer who served briefly as Commissioner during the lame-duck Mayoralty of Armand Krol (''Detective Comics'' #693, January 1996). When the "Clench" virus was released in Gotham and the city descended into anarchy, most police officers ignored Howe and took orders from James Gordon, at that point a private citizen. Howe lost his job when Marion Grange became Mayor and immediately re-instated James Gordon (''Robin'' #28, April 1996).
* '''Commissioner Michael Akins''' — Took over from James Gordon. After the events of the [[Batman: War Games|War Games]] arc, Akins declared all vigilante actions as illegal and issued a shoot-to-kill order for any sight of Batman or his associates. He left the position under unspecified circumstance.
* '''Interim Commissioner Jack Forbes''' - Took over after James Gordon was arrested for the death of 162 people due to a train crash in ''[[Batman Eternal]]'' #1. He was appointed by Mayor Hady at the behest of Carmine Falcone and devoted the GCPD to stopping Batman. He even went as far as releasing criminals apprehended by Batman. Forbes was exposed by Jason Bard and arrested for his connections to Falcone.
* '''Commissioner [[Jason Bard]]''' - Cop from [[Detroit]] whose partner was killed during an incident botched by a Batman impostor who transferred to Gotham under James Gordon's behest just before his arrest. He masterminded the downfall of Forbes and took over as Commissioner. However, Bard was actually working with [[Hush (character)|Hush]] and as a result, destroyed evidence of Gordon's innocence, put Gotham into martial law, used the press of girlfriend [[Vicki Vale]] and created an uneasy relationship with the [[Bat Family]]. After failing to take down Batman, Bard realized the error of his ways and attempted to liberate Gordon.
* '''Commissioner [[Maggie Sawyer]]''': After Bard leaves the position, Maggie Sawyer took over the job. However, she missed the Major Crimes Squad and following the return of Batman, she stepped down to return to Major Crimes and handed the job back to Gordon.

====Non-canon====
* '''Commissioner Ellen Yindel''' - Replaces Gordon in the non-canon ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]''. In the sequel, ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'', she resigns.

====Alternate Universe====
* '''Commissioner Tolliver''' - Police commissioner in the alternate 1889 of ''[[Gotham by Gaslight]]''. He is mayor when Batman first emerges and defeats [[Jack the Ripper]]. Claiming the victory as his own, Tolliver is then elected mayor in the sequel, ''Master of the Future''.

===Gotham City FBI===
The '''Gotham City Federal Bureau of Investigation''' field office is also featured in the fictitious [[Gotham City]]. The Gotham City FBI personnel are shown using black vehicles with red emergency lights.

==In other media==
===Film===
====Serial====
The 1940s ''[[Batman and Robin (serial)|Batman and Robin]]'' serial has actor [[Lyle Talbot]] in the role of Commissioner Gordon. No other members of the force are shown. However, his appearance of Gordon having a feather-duster mustache was later adapted to the comics.

====Batman Anthology (1989-1997)====
All the [[Tim Burton]]/[[Joel Schumacher]] series seemed to give little depiction on the GCPD at all. In ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'', Gordon is portrayed by [[Pat Hingle]], while the usually corrupt Harvey Bullock is replaced with [[William Hootkins]]' [[Max Eckhardt|Lt. Max Eckhart]] (who is killed by [[Joker (comics)|Jack Napier]] prior to his accidental transformation). Hingle also appeared in ''[[Batman Returns]]'', ''[[Batman Forever]]'' and ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]''.

====The Dark Knight trilogy====
In the Nolan films, the '''City of Gotham Police Department''' (abbreviated only as '''GPD''') acts as both an ally and an opponent to Batman. In this incarnation they play a much greater pivotal role than other depictions of the force.

;''[[Batman Begins]]'':
In ''[[Batman Begins]]'', the GPD plays a pivotal role throughout the course of the film, as one of the forces against Batman under the direction of the staunchly vigilante-opposed Commissioner [[Gillian B. Loeb]] (played by [[Colin McFarlane]]). While other members of the GPD are also present, two well-known detectives among them are featured; [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]] (played by [[Gary Oldman]]) and his partner [[Arnold Flass]] (played by [[Mark Boone Junior|Mark Boone, Jr.]]). While Gordon is portrayed as one of the few honest police officers in the department, Flass is portrayed as being corrupt and dealing extensively with the local mafia and Loeb, though clearly displeased with the arrival of Batman, does not seem to possess any corrupt tendencies evident in the source material.

Considering that the film captures the early appearances of the Batman, there is much fear and skepticism among the rank and file about whether the Batman exists and if he is even human. Gordon, who had met Batman before he had adopted the Batman motif, not only realizes he is human, but recognizes the necessity of his actions. Gordon continues to work with him through his early weeks in operation. Batman, who trusts Gordon, a good cop he met during his childhood after his parents murder, includes him in his plan to save Gotham from the [[League of Assassins|League of Shadows]]' fear toxin attack on the Narrows. At the end of the film, Batman's actions have sparked a change in the city and the cops' morality, leading to Gordon being promoted to Lieutenant.

;''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'':
In ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'', Gordon is reassigned as commanding officer of the Major Crimes Unit (MCU), a newly formed division of the GPD created to combat the Gotham crime syndicates and thwart terrorist attacks. Three detectives of this unit are featured; Gerard Stephens (played by [[Keith Szarabajka]]), Michael Wuertz (played by [[Ron Dean]]) and Anna Ramirez (played by [[Monique Curnen]]), among others.

Relations between the DA's office and the police, especially between Gordon and [[Two-Face|Harvey Dent]], remains tense throughout most of the film, with corruption in the rank and file; and even within Gordon's unit, being a key source of this conflict in ''The Dark Knight'', with Dent suspecting that Ramirez and Wuertz are corrupt (based on his investigations while working in Internal Affairs, immediately before his election to District Attorney). In response to Dent's "attacks" on the police department and the actions of the League of Shadows from the first film, Loeb set up the Major Crimes Unit within the GPD to counter possible terrorist attacks as well as rid the city of its organized crime. In the Major Crimes Unit, acceptance of the Batman, though reluctant, is growing. By the end of the film, Batman is framed for the violent actions of Harvey Dent and the police force turns against him.

;''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'':
In ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'', the GPD has successfully eradicated the city's organized crime under "The Dent Act", as most remain oblivious to Harvey Dent's crimes. Gordon remains in guilt over letting Batman taking the fall for Dent, and waiting for a chance to admit the truth to the city. Rookie MCU detective [[Robin in other media#The Dark Knight Rises|John Blake]] (played by [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]]) becomes aware of the truth, and also has deduced Batman's identity beforehand. He eventually becomes a friend and ally of Gordon and Batman, as well as serving as their liaison. Blake is also later promoted from patrol cop to detective after Gordon sees his intelligence and dedication, thus allowing him to report directly to the commissioner. Gordon's deputy commissioner Peter Foley (played by [[Matthew Modine]]), though not corrupt, is determined to capture Batman, to the point that when Batman crashes the police chase of Bane and some of his henchmen following Bane's robbery of the stock exchange, Foley issues orders for the police participating in the chase to pursue Batman instead. As a result, Bane ends up escaping while his henchmen are captured.

[[Bane (comics)|Bane]] and the [[League of Assassins|League of Shadows]] later use explosive-laced concrete to trap most of the force underground for months until they are freed by Batman and his allies. Bane also discovers the truth of the circumstances behind Harvey Dent's death and reveals it to the GPD and the rest of the city, thus ending the manhunt against Batman. However, this also is used by Bane to break the criminals imprisoned under the Dent Act out of prison and wreak havoc around Gotham, much to both the police and the citizens' misfortune. Eventually, the police department are instrumental of the League of Shadows' defeat, though Foley and many officers are killed in action. The GPD, with the aid from Batman and his allies, has successfully captured the surviving League of Shadows members and Gotham's criminals, restoring order back to the city.

Blake resigns himself from the police department following Batman's apparent death and after receiving a set of coordinates left by the Dark Knight, the young detective discovers the [[Batcave]] beneath [[Wayne Manor]].

=====Uniforms and Emblem=====
The GPD in the Nolan films is heavily modeled on the [[New York City Police Department]]. Patrol cars are painted in a modified version of a paint job used by the NYPD in the 1980s and 1990s. In a flashback scene shortly after the deaths of Bruce's parents in ''Batman Begins'', Gordon and other officers are shown wearing sky blue uniforms, similar to those worn by the NYPD from the 1970s through the mid-1990s. In all present-day scenes, patrol officers wear black uniforms. The text on patrol officers' shoulder patches, as well as various modified versions of the logo such as the seal used on SWAT trucks, establish the force as being first established in 1820.<ref>[http://www.therpf.com/showthread.php?t=161325 Dark Knight Rises GCPD Vehicles Reference pics]</ref>

====DC Extended Universe====
The GCPD appears briefly in the extended cut of ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' and reappears for ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'', ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]'' and ''[[Birds of Prey (2020 film)|Birds of Prey]]''.

====''[[The Batman (film)|The Batman]]''====

====''[[Batman: Year One (film)|Batman: Year One]]''====
The GCPD appear as an opponent to Batman. During the events of ''Year One'', Batman wasn't trusted, he doesn't have a relationship with GCPD and Gotham City doesn't consider him a hero. Although many of the GCPD officers are revealed to be corrupt, Lt. James Gordon builds a partnership with Batman.

===Television===
{{main|Batman (TV series)}}
The 1960s [[campy]] [[Batman (TV series)|Batman]] featured [[Neil Hamilton (actor)|Neil Hamilton]] as Commissioner Gordon and [[Stafford Repp]] as Chief O'Hara. Both are depicted as being dependent on Batman and Robin to help solve cases. Gordon even keeps a link to the [[Batcave]] called "the [[Batphone]]" on his desk. In the early episodes it's implied that they only call them in for the so-called "arch-criminals" as the police can handle the more mundane (murder, burglary, arson, etc.). But as the show progressed, they became even more dependent on them to solve problems. This is most greatly shown in one episode, when Batman appears to be missing, Gordon laments that the police will have to solve a case "ourselves". Commissioner Gordon and Chief O'Hara would always be seen with a bunch of police officers when it comes to arresting the arch-criminals upon their defeat.

==== ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]'' (2002 series) ====
'''Detective Jesse Reese''' - played by [[Shemar Moore]]. Jesse is an honest cop in New Gotham who learns of the Birds of Prey and begins to help them. He later enters into a relationship with Huntress. It is later revealed that Reese's birthname was Jesse Hawke, son of crime boss Al Hawke, who became a police officer to atone for his family's sins. This version of the GCPD does have a corruption problem (though it is unclear how bad since a few other honest officers have cameos) and appears to no longer have Jim Gordon at its head.

==== [[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham (2014 series)]] ====
{{main|List of Gotham characters}}
In the series, most of the department is corrupt, with very few honest GCPD officers, including James Gordon, Sarah Essen, Renee Montoya, Crispus Allen, and Nathaniel Barnes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/michael-chiklis-cast-gotham-1201545334/|title=Michael Chiklis Joins Cast of ‘Gotham’|author=Debra Birnbaum|work=variety.com}}</ref> A detective referred to as “Alvarez” appears in 30 episodes portrayed by J. W. Cortez; this is most likely Carlos Alvarez from the comics.

James Gordon, one of the few honest police officers of the GCPD, is the central character of the series and one of his intentions is to purge corruption from the ranks, including his partner, Harvey Bullock. Overtime, many police officers grow distant from Gordon as he attempts to uphold the law rather than break it, much to the frustration of Bullock. After capturing Jack Buchinsky following his attack on the GCPD, Gordon investigated a conspiracy involving Commissioner Loeb and Arnold Flass, leading to the former assigning him to the case of the Ogre, who targets the loved ones of police officers, leading to Gordon killing the serial killer and then enlisting the help of Oswald Cobblepot to force Loeb to resign.

Soon after, [[Professor Pyg]] began to terrorize Gotham and abducted numerous police officers who were Cobblepot's bagmen and murdered them. The GCPD teamed up with Cobblepot to capture the Pyg, who took advantage of Bullock's reckless actions to ambush them and slaughter dozens of police officers whilst the former accidentally shot a police officer disguised as Pyg himself. Gordon rescued them and his bravery earned him praise from the department, who rejected the licenses and Gordon was promoted to Captain, causing Bullock to resign from the GCPD in disgrace. However, Sofia Falcone had intended for Gordon to become the Captain to actually control him otherwise there will be chaos instead, forcing Gordon to reluctantly take the blame and become a hero for the city.

After Sofia is placed into a coma, Gordon is forced to live with his debt by Bullock, who believed that the department needed someone to look up to. When Gotham City is declared a no man's land due to the plot of Jeremiah Valeska and Ra's al Ghul, Gordon and the remaining police officers work with Bruce Wayne, Alfred Pennyworth and Lucius Fox to maintain the peace.

=====DC Animated Universe=====
;''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'':
In the acclaimed [[animated television series]], ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', many officers expressed reluctance about Batman during the first season, especially Harvey Bullock, who had led a manhunt against him in the first episode of the series. The GCPD characters are given more attention such as in "P.O.V", where the major characters of the force in the series participate in a detailed debriefing of an incident. One of the most important contributions from the animated series to the Batman universe is the introduction of [[Renee Montoya]] (first as a uniformed officer, then a detective), which would later become a first-grade character in the ''GCPD'' comic books. In the printed [[DC Universe]], her presence was so solidly incorporated that she later retired from the Department to assume the identity of [[Question (comics)|the Question]].

; ''Batman Beyond'':
In this animated series ''[[Batman Beyond]]'', James Gordon's daughter Barbara Gordon (former Batgirl in ''Batman: The Animated Series'') serves as the new commissioner. The GCPD officers remain reluctant about Batman and thus not enthusiastic of his successor, even on two occasions willing to shoot [[Inque]] or Curare with him.

====''[[Batman: Gotham Knight]]''====
Gordon, Ramirez, and Crispus Allen all appear in three of the shorts in ''[[Batman: Gotham Knight]]'' (which bridges the gap between ''Batman Begins'' and ''The Dark Knight'') consisting of ''Crossfire'', ''In Darkness Dwells'', and ''Deadshot''.

Gordon was voiced by [[Jim Meskimen]], Ramirez was voiced by [[Ana Ortiz]], and Allen was voiced by [[Gary Dourdan]].

====''The Batman''====
On the animated series [[The Batman (TV series)|''The Batman'']], the focus of the GCPD in the first two seasons is on Detectives Ellen Yin (voiced by [[Ming-Na Wen]]) and Ethan Bennett (voiced by [[Steve Harris (actor)|Steve Harris]]) prior to his [[Clayface]] transformation. The corruption on the force is attributed to Chief Angel Rojas (voiced by [[Edward James Olmos]] in the first appearance, [[Jesse Corti]] in later appearances), who appeared often in those seasons. They served as recurrent antagonists in the first two seasons under Chief Rojas' leadership. However, in the Season 2 finale, [[James Gordon (comics)|Jim Gordon]] (voiced by [[Mitch Pileggi]]), recently appointed Commissioner, calls off the manhunt and forms an alliance with Batman to help keep Gotham safe for his daughter, Barbara. Two episodes of the cartoon series featured another detective of the Gotham City Police Department named Cash Tankinson (voiced by [[Patrick Warburton]]). Neither Rojas nor Yin has been seen since then, though [[Artifacts (The Batman)|one episode that take places in the future]] implies that sometime between now and then, Yin will replace Gordon as Commissioner and Bennet becomes Chief of Police.

====''Beware the Batman''====
The GCPD appears in ''[[Beware the Batman]]''. James Gordon worked as a police lieutenant and was distrustful towards Batman until he helped save his daughter from Tobias Whale and Phosphorus Rex. During the part where the League of Assassins had control over the Ion Cortex and shut down Gotham City's power, James Gordon became the police commissioner when Commissioner Correa was killed by the League of Assassins.

==Members in other media==
Each of the different media appearances introduce a member of the Gotham City Police Department that is exclusive to the project:

====The Dark Knight Trilogy====
=====''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' (2008 film)=====
:* '''Detective Anna Ramirez''' (portrayed by [[Monique Curnen]]) - A corrupt police detective - although she only gave in to the mob's demands to pay her sick mother's hospital bills rather than out of more selfish motives - involved in the scarring of Harvey Dent and the death of Rachel Dawes by the Joker and the mob. She also appeared in ''[[Batman: Gotham Knight]]'', voiced by [[Ana Ortiz]]. The commentary on the ''[[Batman: Gotham Knight]]'' DVD, indicates she might be loosely inspired by Renee Montoya. She received a head injury from Dent after he cracked her head with the bottom of his revolver. Her fate is unknown, but it's implied from Gordon that she didn't survive her trauma, though she might not have regained consciousness yet.
:* '''Detective Mike Wuertz''' (portrayed by [[Ron Dean]]) - A corrupt police detective involved in the scarring of Harvey Dent and the death of Rachel Dawes by the Joker and the mob. He is later killed when Dent shoots him in the head with a revolver as one of his first actions as Two-Face.
:* '''Detective Gerard Stephens''' (portrayed by [[Keith Szarabajka]]) - An honest police detective, if not aversed in the field of police brutality. He assists in faking Gordon's death and is later seen guarding the Joker in an interrogation room, informing the Joker that he has been a cop long enough to distinguish between punks who commit crimes for kicks and the sick animals like the Joker who enjoy it, although he's tricked into attacking the Joker, who holds him hostage temporarily during his escape from custody.

=====''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'' (2012 film)=====
:* '''Officer/Detective John Blake''' (portrayed by [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]]) - An earnest beat cop who was promoted by James Gordon after being attacked by Bane's forces.

:* '''Deputy Commissioner Peter Foley''' (portrayed by [[Matthew Modine]]) - Second-in-command and close friend to Gordon. Foley is shown as being quite ambitious and initially doesn't believe an injured Gordon's assertions about Bane raising an army underneath the streets of Gotham. He is eager to capture Batman, something he believes Gordon was never capable of, even when Bane is the more immediate and obvious target, to the point that he inadvertently lets Bane escape when Batman crashes the police pursuit following Bane's robbery of the stock exchange. He is one of the few officers who was not trapped underground after Bane triggered multiple explosions in the tunnels. Though initially aiding Gordon and other members of the resistance, Foley later refuses to take part in the final push against Bane's forces, fearing for his own safety after what Bane did to those special forces members. However, he relents and joins in the riot between the cops and [[Bane (comics)|Bane]]'s army. Foley manages to kill Bane's lieutenant, Barsad, with a submachine gun, but is then killed by automatic fire from Talia's escaping Tumbler.
:* '''Officer Tyler Ross''' (portrayed by [[Reggie Lee (actor)|Reggie Lee]]) - Blake's patrol partner who is trapped underground after the explosion in the sewers, and communicates with Blake during the revolution by passing notes through a sewer grate.

She later resigns upon claiming to be the only one that worked as Batwoman in order to protect the reputation of the Gotham City Police department.
