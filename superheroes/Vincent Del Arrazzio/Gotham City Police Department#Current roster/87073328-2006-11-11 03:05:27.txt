The '''Gotham City Police Department''' (GCPD) is a fictional police department servicing the city of [[Gotham City]] in the [[DC Universe]]. Acting as both ally and opponent of [[Batman]], the superhero long-established in Gotham, the GCPD has long been steeped in [[Political corruption|corruption]], with numerous officers both high-and-low ranking involved in bribery and even more serious offences such as drug-trafficking and murder. The strongest blow against [[police corruption]] came when an increasing amount of [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] charges against [[Commissioner Gillian B. Loeb]] forced him to [[resign]] his position. The Falcone crime family, which had had a stranglehold on Gotham's underground for generations, finally crumbled when a series of killings shook the structure of the [[mafia]] [[organization]]. After the death of [[Carmine Falcone]], the mob lashed out in sloppy, retaliatory crimes, which, in combination with rising gang violence, severely crippled [[organized crime]] in Gotham City. Simultaneously, the ebbing presence of corrupt police officers allowed [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]] to become the new commissioner, a man determined to eradicate crime wherever it existed. <!-- text taken from Gotham City article -->

The GCPD has had a long [[love-hate relationship]] with the city's [[vigilante]] known as [[Batman]]. Commissioner Gordon went along with him because Batman got the job done. His successor, Commissioner [[Michael Akins]] has ordered the arrest of Batman and had the [[Bat-signal]] removed from the roof of [[Gotham Central]]. It has also been strongly implied that corruption and rot within the police department has again been significantly on the rise.

{{spoiler}}
As of DC's ''One Year Later'', James Gordon has been reinstated as Commissioner, along with [[Harvey Bullock (comics)|Harvey Bullock]] rejoining the force and the reinstatement of the Bat-Signal and relations with Batman. It is unknown what has happened to Commissioner Akins, but it is implied that, following revelations of massive corruption within the department, there has been a drastic cleaning-of-house within the department. 

As of [[August 6]], [[2006 in literature|2006]], the weekly ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' series, which reveals the events of the missing year, still has Akins as police commissioner. It is expected that his downfall will be explained in that series.
