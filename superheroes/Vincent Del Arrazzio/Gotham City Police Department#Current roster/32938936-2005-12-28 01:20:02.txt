The '''Gotham City Police Department''' (GCPD) in the fictional [[Batman]] universe has long been steeped in [[Political corruption|corruption]]. The strongest blow against [[police corruption]] came when an increasing amount of [[conspiracy]] charges against [[Commissioner Gillian B. Loeb]] forced him to [[resign]] his position. The Falcone crime family, which had had a stranglehold on Gotham's underground for generations, finally crumbled when a series of killings shook the structure of the [[mafia]] [[organization]]. After the death of [[Carmine Falcone]], the mob lashed out in sloppy, retaliatory crimes, which, in combination with rising gang violence, severely crippled [[organized crime]] in Gotham City. Simultaneously, the ebbing presence of corrupt police officers allowed [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]] to become the new commissioner, a man determined to eradicate crime wherever it existed. <!-- text taken from Gotham City article -->

The GCPD has had a long [[Love-hate relationship]] with the city's [[vigilante]] known as [[Batman]]. Commissioner Gordon went along with him because Batman got the job done. His successor, Commissioner [[Michael Akins]] has ordered the arrest of Batman and had the [[Bat-signal]] removed from the roof of [[Gotham Central]].

==Divisions of GCPD==
*'''Homicide Division'''  
:The division that handles [[murder]]s and some of the more serious non-[[metahuman]] crimes in Gotham.  This is the division Gordon was a part of before becoming commissioner.
*'''Major Crimes Unit'''
:Led by Lt. [[Maggie Sawyer]], the MCU deals with the most serious crimes, often involving [[supervillains]] or politically sensitive cases. This division is the focus of the [[comic book]] [[series]] ''[[Gotham Central]]''.
*'''Quick Response Team'''
:Led by Lt.Gerard "Jerry" Hennelly, the QRT is the GCPD's [[SWAT]] unit.
