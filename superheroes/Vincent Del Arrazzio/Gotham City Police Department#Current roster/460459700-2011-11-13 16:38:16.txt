The '''Gotham City Police Department''' (GCPD) is a [[fiction]]al [[Police|police department]] servicing [[Gotham City]], as depicted in comic books published by [[DC Comics]], in particular those tied into the [[Batman]] books.

==History of GCPD==
Acting as both ally and opponent of [[Batman]], the superhero long-established in Gotham, the GCPD has long been steeped in [[Political corruption|corruption]], with numerous officers both high-and-low ranking involved in bribery and even more serious offenses such as drug-trafficking and murder.

The strongest blow against [[police corruption]] came when an increasing amount of [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] charges against [[Commissioner Gillian B. Loeb]] forced him to [[resign]] his position, replaced by Peter Grogan. The Falcone crime family, which had had a stranglehold on Gotham's underground for generations, finally crumbled when a series of killings shook the structure of the [[mafia]] [[organization]]. After the death of [[Carmine Falcone]], the mob lashed out in sloppy, retaliatory crimes, which, in combination with rising gang violence, severely crippled [[organized crime]] in Gotham City. Simultaneously, the ebbing presence of corrupt police officers allowed [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]] to become the new commissioner, a man determined to eradicate crime wherever it existed.

The GCPD has had a long [[love-hate relationship]] with the city's [[vigilante]] known as [[Batman]]. Commissioner Gordon went along with him because Batman got the job done. His successor, Commissioner [[Michael Akins]] ordered the arrest of Batman and had the [[Bat-signal]] removed from the roof of [[Gotham Central]]. Corruption and rot within the police department also rose during Akins' tenure as Commissioner.

==Current status of GCPD==
As of DC's ''One Year Later'', James Gordon has been reinstated as Commissioner, along with [[Harvey Bullock (comics)|Harvey Bullock]]. Harvey came back on disciplinary probation after helping expose a criminal drug ring. Relation with Batman, including the Bat-Signal, have been established once more. Other characters from ''[[Gotham Central]]'' have appeared in the recent ''[[Tales of the Unexpected (comics)|Tales of the Unexpected]]'' miniseries, featuring [[Crispus Allen]] as the [[Spectre (comics)#Crispus Allen|Spectre]]. Thus far, Detective Driver has appeared in a speaking role. It is unknown what has happened to Commissioner Akins, but it is implied that, following revelations of massive corruption within the department, there has been a drastic cleaning-of-house within the department.

[[Kate Kane]] referred to Akins as police commissioner in the weekly ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' series, which reveals the events of the missing year. A later issue, however, showed a brief snapshot of Commissioner Gordon's welcome back party. The circumstances of Akins's departure and Gordon's reinstatement have yet to be explained.  [[Maggie Sawyer]] is still the commander of the MCU department, and has ended her relationship with former lover Toby Raines.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

==Commissioners==
*'''Commissioner Gillian B. Loeb''' — The corrupt commissioner of police during the first year of Batman’s operation in Gotham. In [[Christopher Nolan]]'s ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'', Loeb was a legitimate cop who was murdered by [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]] when poison was put into his drink. 

*'''Commissioner Jack Grogan''' - he was Commissioner after Loeb and before Gordon. He was mentioned in the last page of Miller's ''Batman: Year One'' and has a one panel appearance in the ''Catwoman Year One Annual'' and also in ''Batman: The Man Who Laughs'' and ''Batman and the Monster Men'' #1.

*'''Commissioner James Gordon''' — Replaced Grogan and worked with Batman in trying to clean up the Gotham police department. When he retired, he handed the GCPD over to Michael Akins, only to take the job back some years later. The adoptive father of Barbara Gordon, the original Batgirl and later Oracle.

*'''Commissioner Vane'''- Former Chief Inspector, only served as commissioner briefly when Gordon was demoted to patrolman in ''Detective Comics'' #121.  During his brief tenure, he oversaw Dr. Hurt's experiments.

*'''Commissioner Peter Pauling''' — Another corrupt commissioner, appointed by Mayor Hamilton Hill. Like Hill, he was working for Rupert Thorne. Pauling issued a shoot-to-kill order for any police officer who spotted Batman, and secretly tried to have Gordon, who was working as a private detective, killed. Pauling eventually died at Thorne's hands and a desperate Mayor Hill re-instated Commissioner Gordon. Pauling may not have existed in the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths#Post-Crisis|Post-Crisis]] DC universe.

*'''Commissioner Sarah Essen Gordon''' — The wife of James Gordon, appointed Commissioner by Mayor Krol while her husband was demoted. This put a great strain on her relationship with her husband and they split up for a while.  Although she had previously been a critic of the Batman, she agreed to Mayor Krol's instructions that she use him.  Mayor Krol sacked her after he lost his re-election bid against Marion Grange, replacing her with Andy Howe.

*'''Commissioner Andy Howe''' — A lawyer who served briefly as Commissioner during the lame-duck Mayoralty of Armand Krol. (''Detective Comics'' #693, January 1996) When the "Clench" virus was released in Gotham and the city descended into anarchy, most police officers ignored Howe and took orders from James Gordon, at that point a private citizen. Howe lost his job when Marion Grange became Mayor and immediately re-instated James Gordon. (''Robin'' #28, April 1996)

*'''Commissioner Michael Akins''' — Took over from James Gordon.  After the events of the [[Batman: War Games|War Games]] arc, Akins declared all vigilante actions were now illegal, and issued a shoot-to-kill order for any sight of Batman or his associates. He left the position under unspecified circumstance.

*'''Commissioner Ellen Yindel''' - Replaces Gordon in the non-canon ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]''. In the sequel, ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'', she resigns.

*'''Commissioner Tolliver''' - Police commissioner in the alternate 1889 of ''[[Gotham by Gaslight]]''. He is mayor when Batman first emerges and defeats [[Jack the Ripper]]. Claiming the victory as his own, Tolliver is then elected mayor in the sequel, ''Master of the Future''.

==Gotham City FBI==
The '''Gotham City Federal Bureau of Investigation''' unit is also featured in the fictitious [[Gotham City]]. The Gotham City FBI drive black vehicles with red emergency lights.

==In other media==
===Serials===
All other depictions of Batman have portrayed the Gotham City Police Department in some form or another. The 1940s [[Batman (serial)|Batman serials]] has actor [[Lyle Talbot]] in the role of Commissioner Gordon in each one. No other members of the force are shown. However, his appearance of Gordon having a feather-duster mustache was later adapted to the comics. Interestingly enough, he portrayed [[Lex Luthor]] in the [[Kirk Alyn]] serial ''[[Superman (serial)|Superman]]''.

===''Batman (TV series)''===
The 1960s [[campy]] [[Batman (TV series)|Batman]] featured [[Neil Hamilton (actor)|Neil Hamilton]] as Gordon and [[Stafford Repp]] as Chief O'Hara. Both are depicted as being dependent on Batman and Robin to help solve cases. Gordon even keeps a link to the [[Batcave]] called "the [[Batphone]]" on his desk. In the early episodes it's implied that they only call them in for the so-called "arch-criminals" as the police can handle the more mundane ([[murder]], [[burglary]], [[arson]], etc.). But as the show progressed they became even more dependent on them to solve problems. This is most greatly shown in one episode, when Batman appears to be missing, Gordon laments that the police will have to solve a case "ourselves."

===1989-1997 live action films===
All the [[Tim Burton]]/[[Joel Schumacher]] series seemed to give little depiction on the GCPD at all. In ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'', Gordon is portrayed by [[Pat Hingle]], while the usually corrupt Harvey Bullock is replaced with [[William Hootkins]]' [[Max Eckhardt|Lt. Max Eckhart]] (who is killed by [[Joker (comics)|Jack Napier]] prior to his accidental transformation). Hingle also appeared in ''[[Batman Returns]]'', ''[[Batman Forever]]'', and ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]''.

===''Batman: The Animated Series''===
In the acclaimed [[animated television series]], ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', the GCPD characters are given more attention such as in "P.O.V", where the major characters of the force in the series participate in a detailed debriefing of an incident. One of the most important contributions from the animated series to the Batman universe is the introduction of [[Renee Montoya]] (first as a uniformed officer, then a detective), which would later become a first-grade character in the ''GCPD'' comic books. In the printed [[DC Universe]], her presence was so solidly incorporated that she later retired from the Department to assume the identity of [[Question (comics)|the Question]].

===''Batman Beyond''===
In this animated series, James Gordon's daughter, Barbara Gordon (former Batgirl in ''Batman: The Animated Series'') is the new commissioner.

===''Batman Begins''===
In the [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the ''Batman'' film franchise, ''[[Batman Begins]]'', the GCPD plays a pivotal role throughout the course of the film, as one of the main antagonizing forces against Batman. Although James "Jim" Gordon (played by [[Gary Oldman]]), then lieutenant, is given a greater role than in previous adaptations, other members of the GCPD are also present, both original and classic ones. [[Mark Boone Junior]] plays Detective Flass, a corrupt officer who deals with the local [[mafia]]; [[Colin McFarlane]] appears as the staunchly vigilante-opposed Commissioner Loeb. While Gordon's appearance resembles how he was portrayed in ''[[Batman: Year One]]'' and ''[[Batman: The Long Halloween|The Long Halloween]]'', Flass and Loeb respectively resemble Harvey Bullock and Michael Akins compared to their comic book counterparts. Furthermore, while Flass is portrayed as being corrupt, a fact consistent with the comics, Loeb, while clearly displeased with the arrival of Batman, does not seem to possess any corrupt tendencies evident in the source material.

Considering that the film captures the early appearances of the Batman, there is much fear and skepticism among the ranks of the PD that the Batman exists and that he is human. Gordon, who had met Batman before he had adopted the Batman motif, not only realizes he is human, but recognizes the necessity of his action. Gordon continues to work with him through his early weeks in operation. Batman, who trusts Gordon, a good cop he met during his childhood, includes him in his plan to save Gotham from the League of Shadows' fear toxin attack on the Narrows.

===''The Dark Knight''===

In ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'', the GCPD plays an even greater role than they did in ''Batman Begins'' after the promotion of Lieutenant James Gordon to the post of Captain of the Major Crimes Unit, a newly formed division of the GCPD. Featured are three detectives, Gerard Stephens (played by [[Keith Szarabajka]]), Michael Wuertz (played by [[Ron Dean]]) and Anna Ramirez (played by [[Monique Curnen]]), among others. Based on commentary material included in ''Batman: Gotham Knight'', it is possible Ramirez was loosely inspired by Renee Montoya. 

Relations between the Justice Department of Gotham and the Police Department remains tense throughout most the film, and corruption in the Police Department, even within Gordon's unit, is a key source of conflict in ''The Dark Knight''. At the rooftop scene above the Major Crimes Unit, it is stipulated that Dent suspected Ramirez and Wuertz are corrupt (based on his investigations while working in Internal Affairs, immediately before his election to District Attorney). According to the viral marketing campaign for the film, [[Two-Face|Harvey Dent]] had spearheaded an initiative through his office to rid the police department of corruption. In response to Dent's "attack" on the police department (referenced in the "Gotham Tonight" extras found on the two-disc special edition of The Dark Knight) and the actions of The League of Shadows from the first film, Commissioner Loeb set up the Major Crimes Unit within Gotham PD to counter possible terrorist attacks as well as rid the city of its organized crime. James Gordon was put in charge of the unit. 

At least in the Major Crimes Unit (considering it is Gordon's own unit), acceptance of the Batman, though reluctant, is growing. At the beginning of the film, Ramirez clears the bank vaults of its officers so Gordan and Batman can have a private investigation. While the official position of the PD is to capture the vigilante known as the Batman, Ramirez jokingly asks Wuertz, who is part of the official investigation, about progress on the case, amidst a background of Elvis, Abe Lincoln, and Bigfoot photos posted on the wall of suspects for Batman. Furthermore, members of the MCU are present when the Batman interrogates the Joker later in the film.

When Commissioner Loeb is killed by the Joker. Gordon fakes his own death to get the Joker to let down his guard (although the effectiveness of the strategy remains debatable). The Joker plans to kill Harvey Dent, but Gordon intercepts him. Dent, relieved that his life has been spared, expresses his appreciation for the GCPD. Gordon plan to capture the Joker appears to be successful, leading to Gordon's promotion to commissioner by Mayor Garcia (who was recently elected on a campaign of change, similar to Dent's). During the Batman's interrogation of the Joker, the location of Rachel Dawes and Harvey Dent, who had been kidnapped immediately after the Joker's attempt on Dent's life had been spared, is revealed. While the Batman successfully saves Dent's life, Gordon and MCU fails to save Rachel Dawes, leading to Dent's immediately polarized distrust and vehement anger toward the GCPD, which reignites and escalates tensions between Dent and the PD. Meanwhile, Stephen's short temper had led to his starting a fight with the Joker in the holding cell; the Joker subdues Stephens and uses him as a hostage to escape from prison (although Stephens survives the ordeal and continues to serve as a trusted member of Gordon's squad to the end of the film).

Toward the end of the film, Wuertz and Ramirez help the Joker kidnap [[Rachel Dawes]] and [[Harvey Dent]]. Wuertz shows no remorse, but Ramirez is devastated by the knowledge that her actions led to the death of Dawes. It is revealed that she had taken bribe money to pay for her mother's hospital fees (as foreshadowed at the beginning of the film when she responds to Gordon's question about her mother's health with "Checked her back in the hospital). Dent, as "Two-Face", confronts both officers and determines their fate with a coin flip at gunpoint. Wuertz was shot when his coin flip landed on the scarred side; on the other hand, Ramirez's life was spared because her coin flip ended on the un-scarred side. Instead, Dent knocked her unconscious with his gun. It remains to be seen whether Gordon or the GCPD has learned about her involvement with the Falcone crime family (led by Sal Maroni).

At the end of the film (after Batman has defeated the Joker), Dent holds Gordon's family at gunpoint and determines to determine their individual fates with the flip of his coin. To save Gordon's son, Batman charges at Dent and both end up falling out of the building (Dent subsequently dies because of the intense pain resulting from half of his body being burnt and his refusal to take pain medications). Gordon heads down to check on Batman; Batman, while still wounded from the bullet and the fall, convinces him to place the blame for the deaths of Dent's victims on Batman so that all the good Harvey did continues to stand. At the conclusion of the film, the GCPD begins its manhunt for Batman.

====''Batman: Gotham Knight''====
Gordon, Ramirez, and Crispus Allen all appear in three of the shorts in ''[[Batman: Gotham Knight]]'', which bridges the gap between ''Batman Begins'' and ''The Dark Knight''; ''[[Crossfire (Batman: Gotham Knight)|Crossfire]]'', ''[[In Darkness Dwells]]'', and ''[[Deadshot (Batman: Gotham Knight)|Deadshot]]''.

Gordon was voiced by [[Jim Meskimen]], Ramirez was voiced by [[Ana Ortiz]], and Allen was voiced by [[Gary Dourdan]].

===''The Batman''===
On the animated series [[The Batman (TV series)|''The Batman'']], the focus of the GCPD in the first two seasons is on Detectives [[Ellen Yin]] and (prior to his [[Clayface]] transformation) [[Ethan Bennett]]. The corruption on the force is attributed to Chief Angel Rojas, who appeared often in those seasons. However, in the Season 2 finale, [[James Gordon (comics)|Jim Gordon]], recently appointed Commissioner, calls off the manhunt and forms an alliance with Batman to help keep Gotham safe for his daughter, Barbara. Neither Rojas nor Yin has been seen since then, though [[Artifacts (The Batman)|one episode that take places in the future]] implies that sometime between now and then, Yin will replace Gordon as Commissioner and Bennet becomes Chief of Police.

===Alternate officers of the law===
*''Batman'' (1960s TV show) 
:*'''[[Chief Miles O'Hara|Chief O'Hara]]''', played by [[Stafford Repp]].
*''Batman'' (1989 film) 
:*'''[[Lt. Max Eckhardt|Lieutenant Max Eckhardt]]''', played by [[William Hootkins]]. A corrupt cop echoing some of the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Pre-Crisis]] aspects of Harvey Bullock. 
*''Birds of Prey'' (TV series from 2002–2003)
:*'''Detective Jesse Reese''' - Was played by [[Shemar Moore]]. Is an honest cop in New Gotham who learns of the Birds of Prey and begins to help them. He later enters into a relationship with Huntress.  It is later revealed that Reese's birthname was Jesse Hawke, son of crime boss Al Hawke, who became a police officer to atone his family's sins. This version of the GCPD does have a corruption problem (though it is unclear how bad since a few other honest officers have cameos) and appears to no longer have Jim Gordon at its head. 
*''The Batman'' (TV series from 2004–2008)
:*'''Chief Angel Rojas''' — [[Edward James Olmos]] and [[Jesse Corti]] provide his voice for this show. For Chief Rojas, The Batman is nothing less than a black eye to his police force. Believing there is no room for vigilante justice in Gotham, Rojas has made capturing the Dark Knight a top priority.
:*'''Detective [[Ellen Yin]]''' — [[Ming-Na]] provides her voice in this show.  Given her name and the events of the episode, "Artifacts", she could be a loose adaptation of Ellen Yindel from ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]''.
:*'''Detective [[Ethan Bennett]]''' — He is a childhood friend of Bruce Wayne's. Due to a chemical created by the Joker, he becomes the first Clayface for this series. [[Steve Harris (actor)|Steve Harris]] provides his voice.
:*'''Detective [[Cash Tankinson]]''' - He is a bumbling detective who was Yin's partner for the episode "JTV" and returned in the episode "[[Cash for Toys]]" as Bruce Wayne's personal bodyguard, voiced by [[Patrick Warburton]].
*''The Dark Knight'' (2008 film)
:*'''Detective Anna Ramirez''' - Played by Monique Curnen, she is a corrupt cop involved in the scarring of Harvey Dent and the death of Rachel Dawes by the Joker.  She also appeared in ''[[Batman: Gotham Knight]]'', voiced by [[Ana Ortiz]].  The commentary on the ''[[Batman: Gotham Knight]]'' DVD, indicates she might be loosely inspired by Renee Montoya.  She received a head injury from Dent after he cracked her head with the bottom of his gun, and later implied from Gordon that she didn't survive her trauma, though she might not have regained consciousness yet.  
:*'''Detective Wuertz''' - Played by [[Ron Dean]], he is a corrupt cop involved in the scarring of Harvey Dent and the death of Rachel Dawes by the Joker.  He was later killed by Dent.
:*'''Detective Stephens''' - Played by [[Keith Szarabajka]], he is an honest police detective, if not aversed to police brutality. He aided Gordon when he faked his own death.
