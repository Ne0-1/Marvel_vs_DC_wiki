The '''Emerald Empress''' is a fictional [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]], an enemy of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] and a member of the [[Fatal Five]]. She was created by [[Jim Shooter]] and [[Curt Swan]], and first appeared in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' #352 (January, 1967). In her first appearance, Sarya of the planet Venegar (referred to simply as 'the Empress') was recruited by [[Superboy]] and the Legion to combat the menace of the [[Sun-Eater]]. Once the Sun-Eater was defeated, she joined the Fatal Five with [[Tharok]], [[Validus]], [[Mano (comics)|Mano]] and the [[Persuader (comics)|Persuader]].

The Empress had no innate [[superhero|super-powers]]; rather, she employed a powerful mystical item called the '''Emerald Eye of Ekron''', a large sphere that obeyed her mental commands. The Eye could fly and emit blasts of energy, and allowed the Empress to fly as well as survive in space. The Eye's residual energy also gave her, on at least one occasion, super-strength. It caused her to grow to gigantic stature during one battle.

The Emerald Empress died in ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' (3rd series) #58 when Legionnaire [[Sensor Girl]] used her powers of illusion to mask Sarya's presence from the Eye of Ekron. As the Empress' body quickly withered and decomposed, she expressed relief to be free from the Eye's control, indicating both that their [[symbiote|symbiotic]] relationship was unwilling and that the Empress was far older than she appeared.

A second Emerald Empress named Cera Kesh first appeared in ''Legionnaires'' #2. Her affections spurned by Legion member [[Sun Boy]], Kesh fell under the Emerald Eye's influence and turned to a life of crime with the other members of the Fatal Five. At the same time, [[Leland McCauley (comics)|Leland McCauley]] found a ''second'' Emerald Eye with which he hoped to turn his girlfriend into the new Emerald Empress. Instead, Cera killed her and gained the power of both Eyes.

After the [[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]] event and the subsequent [[reboot]] of the Legion's [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]], a character simply called the 'Empress' appeared, unconnected to the Eye of Ekron (which appeared separately later). Although she had no powers, she was as dangerous as the rest of the Fatal Five, being a sadistic murderess who had taught herself how to kill any known lifeform.

The Eye was discovered by Legionnaire [[Kinetix]], but later fell under the control of (or controlled) [[Violet (comics)|Shrinking Violet]]. With the Legion's help, Violet managed to break the Eye's hold on her, but not before she had sent half the team into the past. 

Eventually, the Eye came into the hands of the Empress. The Empress seemed to have broken the Eye's will, leaving her unequivically in control.

The Emerald Eye also appeared in ''[[L.E.G.I.O.N.]]'', where it was controlled by, or controlled, the L.E.G.I.O.N.naires [[Garryn Bek]] and [[Marij'n Bek]].

In the present, the Emerald Eye has appeared in the pages of [[52 (comic book)|''52'']], in the posession of [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]].

{{spoiler}}
Lobo, unable to use its uncanny powers, kept the powerful item into a small chest under his supervision. When Starfire used the Eye to save the population of sector 3500 from a swarm of strange creatures, Lobo revealed that he knew something more on the origins of the Eye. An ''Emerald Head of Ekron' also exists and is searching for its lost [[eyeball]]. Ekron is apparently a member of the [[Green Lantern Corps]], but has been driven insane by the destruction of the space sector under his protection.
