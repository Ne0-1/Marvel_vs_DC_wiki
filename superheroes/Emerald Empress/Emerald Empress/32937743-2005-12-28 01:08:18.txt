The ''Emerald Empress'' was a fictional [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]], an enemy of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] and a member of the [[Fatal Five]]. She was created by [[Jim Shooter]] and [[Curt Swan]], and first appeared in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' #352 (January, 1957). In her first appearance, Sarya of the planet [[Venegar]] (referred to simply as 'the Empress') was recruited by [[Superboy]] and the Legion to combat the menace of the [[Sun-Eater]]. Once the Sun-Eater was defeated, she joined the Fatal Five with [[Tharok]], [[Validus]], [[Mano (comics)|Mano]] and the [[Persuader (comics)|Persuader]].

The Empress had no [[superhero|super-powers]] of her own but employed a powerful mystical item called the Eye of Ekron, a large sphere that obeyed her mental commands. The Eye could fly and emit blasts of energy, and allowed the Empress to fly as well.

The Emerald Empress died in ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' v.3 #58 when Legionnaire [[Sensor Girl]] used her powers of illusion to mask Sarya's presence from the Eye of Ekron. As the Empress's body quickly withered and decomposed, she expressed relief to be free from the Eye's control, indicating both that their [[symbiote|symbiotic]] relationship was unwilling and that the Empress was far older than she appeared.

A second Emerald Empress named Ingrid Olav first appeared in ''Legionnaires'' #2. Her affections spurned by Legion member [[Sun Boy]], Olav fell under the Emerald Eye's influence and turned to a life of crime with the other members of the Fatal Five.

After the [[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]] event and the subsequent [[reboot]] of the Legion's [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]], a character simply called the 'Empress' appeared, unconnected to the Eye of Ekron (which appeared separately later). The Eye was discovered by Legionnaire [[Kinetix]] but later fell under the control (or controlled) [[Violet (comics)|Violet]].
