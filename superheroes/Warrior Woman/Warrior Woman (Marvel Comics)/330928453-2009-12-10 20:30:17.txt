'''Warrior Woman''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appears in ''[[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]]'' #16 (May 1977) and was created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Frank Robbins]]. 

==Publication history==
Frieda Ratsel first appears in a multi-issue storyline in the title ''[[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]]'', posing as a [[servicewoman]] dating an [[United States|American]] [[soldier]] in [[London]] during [[World War II]]. Ratsel is revealed to be a [[Nazi]] [[spy]], who is sent to obtain infortmation from a soldier who was also a [[cartoonist]], and is suspected of knowing the secret of the [[Super-Soldier Serum]], which originally empowered hero [[Captain America]]. The soldier is captured and [[interrogated]] by Ratsel, who attempts to replicate the experiment in a [[laboratory]]. The materials used are unstable, and cause an explosion that transforms Ratsel into a female version of fellow Nazi agent ''[[Master Man]]'' (although courtesy of a higher level of exposure to the Serum, Master Man is physically superior). Ratsel is dubbed ''Warrior Woman'' by [[Adolf Hitler]], leader of the [[Third Reich]].

To celebrate the capture of [[superhero]] team the ''Invaders'' (in a prison in the German city of [[Berlin]] , Hitler insists Ratsel and Master Man marry, his logic being that they are the progenitors of a new race. The ceremony, however, is interrupted when the priest is killed by rubble from a building damaged during a battle between the Invaders and [[Germany|German]] troops. Warrior Woman and Master Man retreat when confronted by the [[Human Torch (android)|Human Torch]], who becomes enraged when his ward [[Toro (comics)|Toro]] is wounded by gunfire.<ref>''Invaders'' #16 - 21 (May - Oct. 1977)</ref> The character reappears in the final issue of the ''Invaders'' as part of a team formed by the [[Japan|Japanese]] [[spy]] [[Lady Lotus]] to battle the heroes - the [[Super-Axis]].<ref>''Invaders'' #41 (Sep. 1979)</ref> 

It is revealed in [[flashback]] in the title ''[[Namor the Sub-Mariner]]'' that near the end of World War II, Nazi [[Baron Strucker]] placed Warrior Woman and Master Man in [[suspended animation]] in a hidden laboratory, thereby "preserving" the Nazi dream for use at a later time. Master Man is revived by scientist Axl Nacht, and at Nacht's direction, the character abducts the original Human Torch and Ann Raymond ([[Toro (comics)|Toro]]'s [[widow]]) - their [[blood]] being necessary to help revive Warrior Woman, who had suffered [[brain damage]].  Nacht betrays Master Man when it is revealed that his father first cared for the two superbeings while in suspended animation, and unknowingly instilled in the younger Nacht an obsession with Warrior Woman. 

When Namor the Sub-Mariner, former founding member of the Invaders, finds the laboratory, he battles Master Man, until the Nazi loses his abilities and reverts back to Wilhelm Lohmer. Nacht steals Master Man's abilities for himself, and has apparently also won the affections of the revived but unstable Warrior Woman. Namor rescues the prisoners as Lohmer destroys the laboratory, although no bodies are found in the wreckage.<ref>''Namor the Sub-Mariner'' #9 – 12 (Dec. 1990 – Mar. 1991)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Frieda Ratsel was a normal human who excelled at [[espionage]] and [[hypnotism]], and when exposed to a variant of the Super-Soldier Serum receives enhanced strength and stamina.
