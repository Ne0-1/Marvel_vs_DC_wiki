'''Warrior Woman''' (Freida Ratsel) was a fictional [[Nazi]] [[supervillain]] from [[Marvel Comics]]' first [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]] series. She was given a super-strength formula similar to the one used on [[Master Man (Marvel Comics)|Master Man]], but Warrior Woman's version seemed to be more stable. She had only contempt for the bumbling Master Man, yet [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] was so enamored of his new "super couple" that he ordered them to marry each other. Fortunately for her, the wedding was broken up by an attack from the Invaders!

Frau Ratsel was put into a form of [[cryonic]] suspension after the war, not being recovered until after the [[German reunification]]. A man who called himself "Herr Nacht" had fallen in love with her image, and had re-created the strength formula and taken it himself, becoming a self-proclaimed new Master Man. Unfortunately, it seems her long freeze had given Warrior Woman some brain damage, complicating her recovery. Herr Nacht attempted to use the blood of the original [[Human Torch (Golden Age)|Human Torch]] to try to heal her, but the involvement of the [[Namor|Sub-Mariner]], [[Captain America]], [[Union Jack (comics)|Union Jack]], and an elderly [[Spitfire (comics)|Jaqueline Chrichton]] prevented that. However, the original Master Man had also been awakened and, tired of her berating him, took his revenge by blowing up the building they were in. Master Man war later seen alive (though reverted to his true age). At present, it is unknown if Warrior Woman survived.

Warrior Woman was occasionally referred to as "Krieger Frau" as the German translation of her codename. A more correct translation would be "Kriegerin", which is the feminine variant of 'warrior' in German.
