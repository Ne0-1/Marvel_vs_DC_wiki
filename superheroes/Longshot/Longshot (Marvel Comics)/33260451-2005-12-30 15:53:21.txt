'''Longshot''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]], best known as a member of the [[X-Men]]. Created by [[Art Adams]] and [[Ann Nocenti]], he first appeared in ''Longshot'' #1 (September, [[1985]]).

==Biography==
Longshot is often considered one of the few X-Men who was not a mutant.  This is a misconception; he is mutant but of a race far removed from earth.

His original six issue series is actually a fairly interesting comic book, featuring an early example of Art Adams' detailed art and Ann Nocenti's slightly trippy dialogue and ideas. In this story, Longshot is an artificial humanoid who originated in the dimension known as "Mojoworld" or the "Mojoverse".  He was one of many slaves created by genetic engineers in the employ of Mojoworld's masters, the grossly obese, virtually immobile Spineless Ones, who were ruled by the media-obsessed delusional maniac named [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]].  The Spineless Ones based Longshot's human-like design upon creatures of their own nightmares, which had actually been inspired by humans at some point in the past.  The head geneticist, Arize, gave Longshot and several other creations such as the ram-headed Quark, free will, a conscience and "good luck" powers.

Longshot rebelled against the slavemasters and fled to Earth.  A number of Mojo's servants led by the hound-like Gog and Magog pursued him but in the process both Longshot and Magog received temporary amnesia.  While recovering, Longshot befriended the human stuntwoman named Ricochet Rita.  He also adopted the docile Magog, who he renamed "Pup" but the two fought and then fled from one another when Magog's memories and violent nature returned.  Finally, Mojo and his assistant, the six-armed sword-wielding assassin named [[Spiral (comics)|Spiral]], followed Longshot to Earth.  Longshot, Quark, Rita and [[Doctor Strange]] sent Mojo and his minions back to the Mojoverse, but Ricochet Rita was dragged along with them.  It would later be revealed that Rita had been displaced into the past where she would be transformed into Spiral.

Longshot later joined the X-Men cast in the late [[1980s]]. He was in a relationship with fellow X-Men member, [[Dazzler]] and they may or may not be married.  For a short time, they lived in Mojoworld, leading a rebellion first against Mojo and his temporary successor, "Mojo II: The Sequel".  The pair also cared for the [[X-Babies]], a group of Mojo-manufactured child clones of the X-Men.  Dazzler was revealed to be pregnant with Longshot's child at one point, but this has not since been mentioned; the child may have been born and never seen by the readers, although evidence suggests that Dazzler may have had a miscarriage.  Both Longshot and Dazzler have since returned to Earth separately from one another, suggesting that their relationship has come to an end. He has recently been recruited to join the [[Exiles]] by [[Heather Hudson (Exiles)|Heather Hudson]] to help against Proteus.

==Powers==

Longshot has only three fingers and an opposable thumb on each hand.  He has a star shaped scar on one of his eyes from being branded. He was genetically engineered and possibly augmented by magical means to have certain superhuman abilities. One of these is his ability to affect probability fields through psionic means in order to give himself "good luck" in his activities.  This ability is tied into the positive aspects of his personality: should he attempt to use his powers for a selfish or evil act, or should he give up hope, his powers will fail to function.

Longshot has demonstrated some degree of supernatural attractiveness which tends to compell women to fall in love with him upon first sight most notably the X-Men's Rogue and Dazzler. He has exhibited advanced healing abilities as well.

Longshot can also telepathically "read" the recent memories of a person by making physical contact with him or her. Moreover, Longshot can read "psychic imprints" that people leave on objects that they have handled. Longshot has hollow, bird-like bones but musculature like a human. Hence he is capable of superhuman agility. He also has two hearts and two distinct heart beats.  Longshot carries cleaver-like blades which he hurls with inhuman accuracy.

==Influences==

The character of Longshot was created by a desire from [[Ann Nocenti]] to portray a perfect being in an imperfect world. It was her opinion that this would necessitate that Longshot be a "[[tabula rasa]]" or blank slate consisting of no memories of his own. The limitation on Longshot's powers that he must always do what he believes is right and his confusion regarding these complex issues fill the bulk of this work.

Focus on media in the identities of Mojo and Major Domo were likely inspired by the works of [[Marshall McLuhan]] and other media theorists which Noccenti credited on a similar work of hers on the title [[New Mutants]].

It is also worth noting that not long after Longshot left the X-Men, the team received a new member in [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]]. The two characters have a personality as distinct as night and day, however they share long hair, agility, thrown weapons, stunningly good looks, a mysterious history and a love interest in Rogue. In one issue, Wolverine even compares sparring with Gambit to be like sparring with Longshot.

Longshot also inspired [[Shatterstar]], a character written for [[Rob Liefeld]]'s [[X-Force]] series.

==Ultimate Longshot==

Like many Marvel characters, Longshot has been reinvented for the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe.  Ultimate Longshot first appeared in ''[[Ultimate X-Men]] #54'', written by [[Brian K. Vaughan]]. In the Ultimate Universe, Longshot is not an alien but an ordinary mutant named '''Arthur Centino.''' His name is a tribute to creators [[Art Adams]] and [[Ann Nocenti]].

Centino is accused of murdering a [[Genosha]]n politician. Genosha is rabidly anti-mutant and Longshot is put on a [[reality show]] on an island where he is hunted by humans who try to kill him to win the game; much like [[Richard Connell]]'s ''[[The Most Dangerous Game]]'', where the story arc gets its title. The show is run by [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo Adams]], the Ultimate version of [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]] and who's last name is a tribute to [[Art Adams]], who in this universe is a morbidly obese, [[albino]] human with [[dreadlocks]].

The X-Men journey to the island Longshot is on, assuming he is innocent and was framed. It is later discovered that he ''is'' guilty; he had stumbled upon his girlfriend [[Spiral (comics)|Spiral]] with the politician and killed him in a fit of rage. The X-Men, not knowing this, help him escape from the island. It is only after he is gone do they discover the truth. Later, Longshot is in the [[Savage Land]] foraging for food when he runs into the [[Ultimates]]' [[Scarlet Witch]], who captures him and has him imprisoned in the Triskelion base. Longshot later successfully escapes from the Triskelion along with Magneto and it is discovered that Magneto was the one who tipped the authorities on his location. His presence within the Triskelion was needed in order to manipulate the probabilities or "luck" into Magneto's favor.

Longshot's powers in the Ultimate universe appear to be the same as they are in the regular one. He has hollow bones that allows him to become more agile, but at the same time makes his skeletal structure more fragile. He also has four fingers including opposable thumbs on each hand. As a homage to his regular version, his right eye glows whenever his abilities are taking effect.

==Appearances in other media==
Longshot guest starred in the [[X-Men animated series]] episodes ''Mojoverse'' and ''Longshot''. In the animated series it seemed to indicate that he might have a relationship with [[Spiral (comics)|Spiral]].  Longshot will also appear in [[Exiles (comics)|Exiles]] #72 and become one of the Exiles. [[Image:Longshot2.JPG| Longshot with Exiles. Cover of Exiles #74|right|thumb]]
