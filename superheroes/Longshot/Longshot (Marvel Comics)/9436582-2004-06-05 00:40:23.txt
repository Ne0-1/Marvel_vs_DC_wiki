'''Longshot''' is a fictional [[superhero]] in the [[X-Men]] [[comic book]], published by the [[Marvel Comics]] Group. He was one of the later additions to the X-Men cast, appearing in the mid [[1980]]'s. He was in a relationship with fellow X-Men member, [[Dazzler]], and they may or may not be married. For a short time, they lived in and ruled the [[Mojoverse]], caring for the [[X-Babies]].

Longshot is the only member of the X-Men who is not a mutant.  He is actually an artificial genetically-engineered being who came from a [[parallel dimension]]. This fictional character was created by writer Ann Nocenti and artist Arthur Adams. Longshot's first appearance was in Longshot 1, published in [[1986]].

Longshot has only 3 fingers and an opposable thumb on each hand.  He has a star shaped scar on one of his eyes from being branded. He was genetically engineered and possibly augmented by magical means to have certain superhuman abilities. One of these is his ability to affect probability fields through psionic means in order to give himself "good luck" in his activities. Longshot can telepathically "read" the recent memories of a person by making physical contact with him or her. Moreover, Longshot can read "psychic imprints" that people leave on objects that they have handled. Longshot has hollow, bird-like bones, but musculature like an Earthman's. Hence, he is capable of superhuman agility.  Longshot carries cleaver like blades which he hurls with inhuman accuracy.
