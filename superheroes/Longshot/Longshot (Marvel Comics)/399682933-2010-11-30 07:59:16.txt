'''Longshot''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]] best known as a member of the [[X-Men]]. He was created by writer [[Ann Nocenti]] and artist [[Art Adams]].

==Publication history==
Longshot debuted in a six-part, eponymous 1985–1986 [[limited series|mini-series]] that parodied [[television]]. The series featured the "Mojoverse", an alien dimension whose residents are addicted to [[gladiator]]-like entertainment and ruled by the tyrant network head [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]]. Longshot, who possesses [[probability]] altering or "[[luck]]" powers, is an action star who escapes enslavement by Mojo. The series became a [[cult classic]]. It features an early example of Art Adams' detailed art and Ann Nocenti's slightly trippy dialogue and ideas.

After the series, Longshot was a member of the X-Men for a time, and has appeared in Marvel [[comic books]] occasionally, particularly various X-Men titles, beginning in the late 1980s.

The 1997 [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''Fools'' has Longshot restlessly searching the Mojoverse for "something" he feels he has lost.

Since 2008 he has appeared regularly in ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]''.

===Design===
A design for the character of Longshot was put forward by [[Carl Potts]], which was reworked by artist Arthur Adams who noted that {{cquote|I think I was just trying to make Longshot look different from everything else that I could think of at the time, and I guess I did that. No one then, or since, has used that stupid mullet haircut. <ref name="Khoury 128">{{cite book|last=Khoury|first=George|coauthors=Eric Nolen-Weathington|title=Modern Masters Volume 6:Arthur Adams|publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing|pages=128|isbn=}}</ref>}}

The mullet itself was inspired by [[Limahl]] of the [[New Wave music|New Wave]] group [[kajagoogoo]], as Adams notes "I said, 'Well. I cannot think of any other super-heroes that have that haircut. I guess I'll give him that.'" <ref name="Khoury 128"/>

==Fictional character biography==
Longshot is an artificially created humanoid life-form, with the ability to defy probability.  He is from an alternate  dimension known as "Mojoworld" or the "Mojoverse".  He is one of many slaves created by genetic engineers in the employ of Mojoworld's masters, the grossly obese, virtually immobile Spineless Ones, who are ruled by the media-obsessed delusional maniac named [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]].  The head geneticist, [[Arize (comics)|Arize]], gave Longshot and his other creations (such as the ram-headed Quark) free will and a conscience, hoping that one day they would rise up against their masters.

Longshot and many of his fellow slaves rebel against the slave-masters. They undergo a mystical ritual that gives them the power to create good luck for themselves. Despite this power, their masters win the war due to their superior weaponry and the limits of the slaves' luck. Longshot is rendered amnesiac by the Spineless Ones, but he manages to flee from Mojoworld to Earth. A number of Mojo's servants, led by the hound-like Gog and Magog, pursue him, but get stuck between Longshot's world and Earth. Unable to remember his real name, Longshot becomes an adventurer and takes the name "Longshot" after several humans call him that due to his incredible good luck. While recovering, Longshot befriends the human stunt-woman named Ricochet Rita and works as a movie stuntman himself. He also adopts the docile Magog, who he renames "Pup". Finally, Mojo and his assistant, the six-armed sword-wielding assassin named [[Spiral (comics)|Spiral]], follow Longshot to Earth. Longshot battles Spiral, and defeats Mojo with the aid of Ricochet Rita, Quark, and [[Doctor Strange]], who then send Mojo and his minions back to the Mojoverse. Longshot, Quark and Rita return to the Mojoverse to free the other slaves.<ref>''Longshot'' #1–6</ref>

A once-again amnesiac Longshot is sent back to Earth by Mojo, where he joins the [[X-Men]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men Annual'' #10</ref> With the X-Men, he battles the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]]<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #218</ref> and the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #221–222</ref> Longshot dies while defeating the [[Adversary (comics)|Adversary]], but is then restored to life by [[Roma (comics)|Roma]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #225–227</ref> Longshot and the X-Men fight the [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]] in Australia for the first time.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #229</ref> He battles the [[Brood (comics)|Brood]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #232–234</ref> With the X-Men, he next invades [[Genosha]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #238</ref> He soon becomes [[Dazzler]]'s lover.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #242</ref> However, he suffers a severe identity crisis, and eventually leaves the X-Men.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #248</ref>

Before long, Longshot is reunited with Dazzler, and is teleported with her to Mojoworld. For a short time, they live in Mojoworld, until they are captured by Mojo.<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 2 #5–7</ref> They, with the X-Men and Mojo's temporary successor, "Mojo II: The Sequel", lead a revolt against Mojo. Longshot and Dazzler also learn that Dazzler is pregnant with their child, who was hinted to be [[Shatterstar]], the member of [[X-Force]].<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 2 #10–11</ref> The pair also care for the [[X-Babies]], a group of Mojo-manufactured child clones of the X-Men. One of the many X-Babies created is a young version of Longshot himself. Dazzler's pregnancy has not been mentioned since; the child may have been born and never seen by the readers, although evidence suggests that Dazzler may have had a miscarriage,<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #47</ref> though it has not been established officially what became of the infant. Both Longshot and Dazzler have since returned to Earth separately from one another with Dazzler believing that Longshot has been killed.

===Longshot: Fools===
After being "killed" by the Thingy and denied entrance into Heaven, Longshot realizes he has lost his innocence, the main source of his luck power. Ejected from Heaven and Mojoverse, Longshot finds himself stranded between Baum and Barrie, Kansas, pursued by the vengeful Thingy. When a child who has befriended the broken hero is damaged by the monster, Longshot, helped by a group of mental patients, rediscovers his faith in himself and his own purity despite the suffering of his life to restore her to health. In the end, the unlikely group sets out for the big city, searching for adventure, secure in their luck and their innocence.

===Exiles===
Longshot is recruited for the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]] by [[Heather Hudson (Exiles)|Heather Hudson]] to help against [[Proteus (comics)|Proteus]]. [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]] claims<ref>[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]] #18</ref><ref>''Exiles'' #19</ref> that he and all the other inhabitants of Mojoworld are "unique" in that there is no parallel counterpart to his realm. This would extend to Longshot, though what impact this will have on his membership in the Exiles is unknown. Morph reveals that Longshot's abilities cancel Proteus' reality warping powers, making him a perfect candidate for the team. He is brought aboard to replace the dead [[Mimic (Exiles)|Mimic]]. Longshot saves [[Blink (comics)|Blink]] from  Proteus in [[2099 (comics)|2099]], and saves Blink, [[Morph (comics)|Morph]], [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], [[Star Brand]], Lenore Fenzl, and [[Nightmask]] from Proteus in the [[New Universe|''New Universe Approximation'']]. When the Exiles visit [[Maestro (comics)|''Future Imperfect'']], Longshot tries to stop [[Maestro (comics)|Maestro]]'s rampage and stop Proteus from taking over Maestro's body. The Exiles finally corner Proteus at the ''[[Heroes Reborn]]'' world, and trap Proteus in Morph's body. With the hunt for Proteus at an end, Longshot remains an Exile to continue fixing damaged realities. During their last mission, Longshot is seemingly brainwashed into attacking Blink by [[Madame Hydra]] and the [[Hand (comics)|Hand]]. Afterwards, Longshot leaves the Exiles to be with Dazzler<ref>''[[X-Men: Die by the Sword]]''</ref>.

===Secret Invasion===
{{Main|Secret Invasion}}
Longshot meets up with [[Darwin (comics)|Darwin]] some time after the events of [[X-Men: Messiah Complex|Messiah CompleX]] and attempts to lead him to Professor Xavier, due to the fact that Darwin wishes to help the Professor. During that time, Longshot states that his powers are failing him recently, and proceeds to test them and himself on some people, causing those people to turn on Darwin. After Darwin escapes, the crowd attack Longshot, but he manages to mysteriously get away. He reappears in an alleyway, unaware he is being tracked by [[Jazinda]]. He then reveals himself to be a Skrull named Nogor and goes to meet up with Darwin as they move through Detroit. Later, they are attacked by Jazinda and [[She-Hulk]].<ref>''X-Factor'' Vol. 3 #33</ref> Darwin "evolves" to the point where he recognized Nogor as a Skrull and defeated him. Nogor was later taken into custody by She-Hulk and Jazinda.<ref>''X-Factor'' Vol. 3 #34</ref>

The real Longshot's location during this time is not disclosed.

===The Karma Project===
The real Longshot shows up in Detroit after reading an article about his appearance there during the events of Secret Invasion. After a small fight with [[Strong Guy|Guido]], he helps [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] find out what happened to Darwin and his father, leading them to the Karma Project. During that time, he is seen commenting that women are too friendly towards him, and reveals that his memory loss, and the subsequent changes in his personality, is the main reason behind why he and Dazzler are no longer an item. <ref name="X-Factor Vol. 3 #35">''X-Factor'' Vol. 3 #35</ref>.

In ''X-Factor'' 47 it is once more hinted that Longshot and Shatterstar are related.

===Utopia===
In ''Nation X: X-Factor'' #1, X-Factor lands on Utopia. While Longshot rekindles his romance with Dazzler, the rest of X-Factor is fighting off a new villain. When X-Factor leaves, they forget Longshot, who is still on Utopia.<ref>''Nation X: X-Factor'' #1</ref>

==Powers, abilities, and equipment==
Longshot was created through genetic engineering by Arize. Longshot has only three fingers and an opposable thumb on each hand. He also has leather-like skin, hollow bones and two hearts, giving him superhuman speed, agility, endurance, and reflexes. He has exhibited advanced healing abilities as well.

He has a star shaped scar on his left eye from being branded. The scar is only visible (glowing brightly) when Longshot uses his superhuman powers. He was genetically engineered and augmented by magical means to have certain superhuman abilities. The mystical augmentation gave him the ability to affect probability fields through [[psionics|psionic]] means in order to give himself "good luck" in his activities. This allows incredibly unlikely events to happen in Longshot's favor. This power operates even when Longshot does not consciously will it to do so. This ability is tied into the positive aspects of his personality: should he attempt to use his powers for a selfish or evil act, or should he give up hope, his powers will fail to function or even backfire, giving him bad luck. By creating "good luck" for himself psionically, Longshot creates an equal and opposite effect elsewhere, thereby creating "bad luck" that may affect someone else or even Longshot himself.

Longshot can also telepathically "read" the recent memories of a person by making physical contact with him or her. He also is sensitive to "hearing" the voices of spirits of the dead (clairaudience). Moreover, Longshot can read "psychic imprints" that people leave on objects that they have handled, and thereby learn the thoughts that an individual had while handling the object, otherwise known as [[Psychometry (paranormal)|psychometric]] powers. Longshot, in the present, can sometimes even look into the future of the person or object he touches, and can read the thoughts that that person will have when handling it in that future time.

It is eventually clearly stated that it is hardwired into his DNA that most women tend to fall in love with him.<ref name="X-Factor Vol. 3 #35"/> A male detective, however, falls in love with him in the same issue.<ref name="X-Factor Vol. 3 #35"/>

Longshot carries cleaver-like blades, stored in a bandoleer, which he hurls with inhuman accuracy or in some cases, completely dependent upon his luck powers. He is also shown as proficient in other types of bladed weaponry. During his X-Men years, Longshot also carried a folding grappling hook and rope either carried looped around one shoulder or stored in his shoulder bag, and a set of throwing spikes which produced net-like wires between them to restrain a target.

Longshot is proficient in the use of jetpacks for flight, and in the use of beam weapon side-arms.

Longshot is an extraordinary acrobat, and has superhuman agility due to having hollow bones but musculature like an Earthman's.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Longshot===
Ultimate Longshot first appeared in ''[[Ultimate X-Men]] #54'', written by [[Brian K. Vaughan]]. In the Ultimate Universe, Longshot is not an alien but an ordinary [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] named '''Arthur Centino.''' His name is a tribute to creators [[Art Adams]] and [[Ann Nocenti]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

Centino is accused of murdering a [[Genosha]]n politician; as punishment, he is sentenced to forced participation in a [[reality show]] where he will be hunted for sport. The show is run by [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo Adams]], the Ultimate version of [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]] who in this universe is a morbidly obese, [[albino]] human with [[dreadlocks]]. One of the opponents Longshot faces is a tall, fit, red-haired hunter, the Ultimate version of [[Arcade (comics)|Arcade]].

The X-Men journey to the island Longshot is on, assuming he is innocent and was framed and thus offer to help him.  During the course of their time together, Longshot spends time flirting with Colossus{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}, implying that he is either bisexual or very good at reading and thus manipulating people{{Or|date=April 2009}}.  It is later discovered that he ''is'' guilty; he had stumbled upon his girlfriend [[Spiral (comics)#Ultimate Spiral|Spiral]] with the politician and killed him in a fit of rage. Later, Longshot is in the [[Savage Land]] foraging for food when he runs into the [[Ultimates]]' [[Scarlet Witch]], who captures him and has him imprisoned in their [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]] base. Longshot later successfully escapes from the Triskelion. During the escape, he seemingly kills [[Lady Deathstrike]], saving the lives of two of the X-Men who had freed him before. One of the others who escaped is [[Magneto (comics)#Ultimate Magneto|Magneto]], who admits that he had tipped the authorities onto Longshot's location in the first place, as part of Magneto's own escape plan; Magneto wanted Longshot and his luck power present as an "edge" to guarantee success.

Ultimate Longshot has only three fingers (plus one thumb) on each hand, like the original character he was based on.

This version of Longshot despises normal human beings; he regularly uses the epithet "[[flatscan]]" when referring to them, introducing the term to the Ultimate universe.

When Longshot is last seen, the death of [[Charles Xavier]] is announced,<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #79</ref> the news reaches "Somewhere Else," apparently Magneto's latest stronghold. Longshot is seen, still bearded from his time on the run, seated on his own low stool at Magneto's right hand side, suggesting that the [[Psychopathy|sociopath]]ic young mutant holds special favor with the Master of Magnetism. This story by Robert Kirkman is entitled ''Aftermath: Part 1''.

It is later revealed that Longshot was somehow tortured and killed in the Savage Land under orders from Magneto.<ref>''Ultimatum'' #3</ref>

===Shattershot===
In the alternate reality future seen at the end of the "Shattershot" storyline (which ran through the 1992 [[annual publication|annuals]] of the X-Men-related titles), a mysterious hooded figure appears in the background when the former slaves and the Spineless Ones finally make peace. The hooded figure throws back his hood, revealing himself to be an aged Longshot. He makes a philosophical pronouncement, then says "Gotcha!" as he did while he was with the X-Men.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Voiced by [[Rod Wilson (actor)|Rod Wilson]], Longshot starred in the [[X-Men animated series]] episodes "Mojovision" and "Longshot" and made a short cameo in "Jubilee's Fairytale Theatre". In "Mojovision", Longshot quit his own hit TV show leaving Mojo to kidnap the X-Men and have them replace Longshot in a new action series that had the X-Men literally fight for their lives. Barely surviving, the X-Men foiled Mojo's plans with the help of Longshot. In the episode "Longshot", the Lucky One stumbles to earth while trying to evade Mojo and his forces. Mojo once again makes the hunt a televised event with Longshot and the X-Men the targets. The X-Men prevail and Longshot returns home to continue leading the rebellion against Mojo. In this episode Longshot develops a deep respect and kinship with the X-Man [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]]. This relationship is played with in a brief cameo in the fantasy-inspired episode "Jubilee's Fairytale Theatre" where Jubilee, much like a [[Robin Hood]] type character, saves a peasant Longshot from being annihilated for his disobedience against Magnus the Magnificent, a fairytale version of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]].

===Video games===
* Longshot is a playable character in the DOS video-game called ''[[X-Men II: The Fall of the Mutants]]''. The storyline is based on the ''[[Fall of the Mutants]]'' crossover from the X-Men comics.

* An item called "The Luck of The Longshot" is available in ''[[X-Men Legends]]''.

* Longshot was intended for inclusion in the [[PlayStation Portable]] version of ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'', but was removed prior to its release. {{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}
