'''Longshot''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]] best known as a member of the [[X-Men]]. He was created by writer [[Ann Nocenti]] and artist [[Arthur Adams (comics)|Art Adams]].

==Publication history==
Ann Nocenti, an editor at [[Marvel Comics]] in 1985, wrote ''Longshot'' at a time when, according to Arthur Adams, Marvel expected its editors to have written at least one work.{{Citation needed|date= October 2011}} Every artist she showed the script to had declined to take on the project, so it was offered to aspiring artist [[Arthur Adams (comics)|Arthur Adams]], whose samples had been given to editor [[Carl Potts]] and Nocenti, his assistant editor, by editor [[Al Milgrom]]. 

A design for the character of Longshot was put forward by [[Carl Potts]], who outfitted the character in a jumpsuit that Adams thought to be reminiscent of the [[Starfleet]] uniforms from ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]''. Adams created his own design, basing the character's mullet haircut on that of musician [[Limahl]].{{Citation needed|date= October 2011}} Adams, who disliked the practice of having characters produce weapons and other devices from their boots or secret pockets that had never before been established, decided to include some pouches on the character's belt, a practice that influenced the artwork of the founders of [[Image Comics]].<ref name=ModernMasters>{{cite book|last=Khoury|first=George|coauthors=Eric Nolen-Weathington|title=Modern Masters Volume 6:Arthur Adams|publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing|pages=|isbn=}}</ref>

Longshot debuted in a six-issue, eponymous 1985–1986 [[limited series|mini-series]]. The series featured the "Mojoverse", an alien dimension whose residents are addicted to [[gladiator]]-like entertainment and ruled by the tyrannical network head [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]]. Longshot, who possesses [[probability]] altering or "[[luck]]" powers, is an action star who escapes enslavement by Mojo.

After the series, Longshot joined the X-Men in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]] Annual'' #10 in 1986, and remained with them until ''Uncanny X-Men'' #248 (September 1989), appearing in various Marvel books occasionally, such as ''[[Exiles (comics)|Exiles]]'', the 1997 [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''Fools'' and ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'', a book whose cast he joined in issue #35 (November 2008).

==Fictional character biography==
===Origins===
Longshot is an artificially created humanoid life-form, with the ability to defy probability.  He is from an alternate  dimension known as "Mojoworld" or the "Mojoverse".  He is one of many slaves created by genetic engineers in the employ of Mojoworld's masters, the grossly obese, virtually immobile Spineless Ones, who are ruled by the media-obsessed delusional maniac named [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]].  The head geneticist, [[Arize (comics)|Arize]], gave Longshot and his other creations (such as the ram-headed Quark) free will and a conscience, hoping that one day they would rise up against their masters.

Longshot and many of his fellow slaves rebel against the slave-masters. They undergo a mystical ritual that gives them the power to create good luck for themselves. Despite this power, their masters win the war due to their superior weaponry and the limits of the slaves' luck. Longshot is rendered amnesiac by the Spineless Ones, but he manages to flee from Mojoworld to Earth. A number of Mojo's servants, led by the hound-like Gog and Magog, pursue him, but get stuck between Longshot's world and Earth. Unable to remember his real name, Longshot becomes an adventurer and takes the name "Longshot" after several humans call him that due to his incredible good luck. While recovering, Longshot befriends the human stunt-woman named Ricochet Rita and works as a movie stuntman himself. He also adopts the docile Magog, who he renames "Pup". Finally, Mojo and his assistant, the six-armed sword-wielding assassin named [[Spiral (comics)|Spiral]], follow Longshot to Earth. Longshot battles Spiral, and defeats Mojo with the aid of Ricochet Rita, Quark, and [[Doctor Strange]], who then send Mojo and his minions back to the Mojoverse. Longshot, Quark and Rita return to the Mojoverse to free the other slaves.<ref>''Longshot'' #1–6</ref>

===''X-Men''===
After an unsuccessful rebellion, a once-again amnesiac Longshot is sent back to Earth by Mojo, where he joins the [[X-Men]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men Annual'' #10</ref> With the X-Men, he battles the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]]<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #218</ref> and the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #221–222</ref> Longshot dies with the rest of the X-Men while defeating the [[Adversary (comics)|Adversary]], but is then restored to life by [[Roma (comics)|Roma]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #225–227</ref> Longshot and the X-Men fight the [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]] in Australia for the first time.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #229</ref> He battles the [[Brood (comics)|Brood]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #232–234</ref> With the X-Men, he next invades [[Genosha]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #238</ref> He soon becomes [[Dazzler]]'s lover.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #242</ref> However, he suffers a severe identity crisis, and eventually leaves the X-Men.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #248</ref>

Before long, Longshot is reunited with Dazzler, and is teleported with her to Mojoworld. For a short time, they live in Mojoworld, until they are captured by Mojo.<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 2 #5–7</ref> They, with the X-Men and Mojo's temporary successor, "Mojo II: The Sequel", lead a revolt against Mojo. Longshot and Dazzler also learn that Dazzler is pregnant with their child, who was hinted to be [[Shatterstar]], the member of [[X-Force]].<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 2 #10–11</ref> The pair also care for the [[X-Babies]], a group of Mojo-manufactured child clones of the X-Men. One of the many X-Babies created is a young version of Longshot himself. Dazzler's pregnancy has not been mentioned since; the child may have been born and never seen by the readers, although evidence suggests that Dazzler may have had a miscarriage,<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #47</ref> though it has not been established officially what became of the infant. Dazzler returned to Earth separately from Longshot suffering from memory loss, believing that Longshot, the X-Babies and everyone in the rebellion had been killed by Mojo and his followers.{{issue|date=September 2011}}

===Longshot: Fools===
After being "killed" by the Thingy and denied entrance into Heaven, Longshot realizes he has lost his innocence, the main source of his luck power. Ejected from Heaven and Mojoverse, Longshot finds himself stranded between Baum and Barrie, Kansas, pursued by the vengeful Thingy. When a child who has befriended the broken hero is damaged by the monster, Longshot, helped by a group of mental patients, rediscovers his faith in himself and his own purity despite the suffering of his life to restore her to health. In the end, the unlikely group sets out for the big city, searching for adventure, secure in their luck and their innocence.{{issue|date=September 2011}}

===''Exiles''===
Again suffering from memory loss, Longshot is recruited for the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]] by [[Heather Hudson (Exiles)|Heather Hudson]] to help against [[Proteus (comics)|Proteus]]. [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]] claims<ref>[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]] #18</ref><ref>''Exiles'' #19</ref> that he and all the other inhabitants of Mojoworld are "unique" in that there is no parallel counterpart to his realm. This would extend to Longshot, though what impact this will have on his membership in the Exiles is unknown. Morph reveals that Longshot's abilities cancel Proteus' reality warping powers, making him a perfect candidate for the team. He is brought aboard to replace the dead [[Mimic (Exiles)|Mimic]]. Longshot saves [[Blink (comics)|Blink]] from  Proteus in [[2099 (comics)|2099]], and saves Blink, [[Morph (comics)|Morph]], [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], [[Star Brand]], Lenore Fenzl, and [[Nightmask]] from Proteus in the [[New Universe|''New Universe Approximation'']]. When the Exiles visit the future, Longshot tries to stop [[Hulk (comics)|Maestro]]'s rampage and stop Proteus from taking over Maestro's body. The Exiles finally corner Proteus at the ''[[Heroes Reborn]]'' world, and trap Proteus in Morph's body. With the hunt for Proteus at an end, Longshot remains an Exile to continue fixing damaged realities. During their last mission, Longshot is seemingly brainwashed into attacking Blink by [[Madame Hydra]] and the [[Hand (comics)|Hand]]. Afterwards, Longshot leaves the Exiles during a mission on Earth-616 where he is re-introduced to Dazzler, whom he has no memory of nor their time together in Mojoworld.<ref>''[[X-Men: Die by the Sword]]''</ref>

===''X-Factor''===
After failing to rekindle his relationship with Dazzler due to his loss of his memories, Longshot shows up in Detroit after reading an article about his supposed appearance there during the events of Secret Invasion, thanks to a Skrull impostor. After a small fight with [[Strong Guy|Guido]], he helps [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] find out what happened to Darwin and his father, leading them to the Karma Project. During that time, he is seen commenting that women are too friendly towards him, and reveals that his memory loss are so severe that he doesn't even understand his powers anymore.<ref name=X-FactorV3#35>[[David, Peter]]. ''X-Factor'' Vol. 3 #35, Marvel Comics</ref>

In ''X-Factor'' #47 it is once more hinted that Longshot and Shatterstar are related.
In ''Nation X: X-Factor'' #1, X-Factor lands on Utopia. While Longshot rekindles his romance with Dazzler, the rest of X-Factor is fighting off a new villain. When X-Factor leaves, they forget Longshot, who is still on Utopia.<ref>''Nation X: X-Factor'' #1</ref> It was revealed in ''X-Factor'' #229 that [[Shatterstar]] is Longshot's "brother".

==Powers, abilities and equipment==
Longshot was created through genetic engineering by Arize. Longshot has only three fingers and an opposable thumb on each hand. He also has leather-like skin,<ref name=Longshot2>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Ann Nocenti]]|penciller=[[Arthur Adams (comics)|Arthur Adams]]|inker=[[Whilce Portacio]]|story=I'll Wave To You From the Top!|title=Longshot|volume=1|issue=2|date=October 1985|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|page=|panel=}}</ref> and two hearts.<ref name=Longshot1>{{Cite comic|writer=Ann Nocenti|penciller=Arthur Adams|inker=Whilce Portacio and [[Brent Anderson]]|story=A Man Without a Past|title=Longshot|volume=1|issue=1|date=September 1985|publisher=Marvel Comics|page=|panel=}}</ref> He is superhumanly acrobatic (speed, agility, dexterity, flexibility, reflexes/reactions, coordination, and balance) being able to evade blows by [[Spider-Man]].<ref name=Longshot4>{{Cite comic|writer=Ann Nocenti|penciller=Arthur Adams|inker=Whilce Portacio and [[Brent Anderson]]|story=Can't Give It All Away!|title=Longshot|volume=1|issue=4|date=December 1985|publisher=Marvel Comics|page=|panel=}}</ref> He also has advanced healing abilities. In ''Longshot'' #3, these abilities automatically healed him<ref name=Longshot3>{{Cite comic|writer=Ann Nocenti|penciller=Arthur Adams|inker=Whilce Portacio|story=Just Let Me Die|title=Longshot|volume=1|issue=3|date=November 1985|publisher=Marvel Comics|page=|panel=}}</ref> following several hits with high-powered laser beams and an impact resulting from his falling out of the sky against a barn when his jetpack malfunctioned.<ref name=Longshot2/>

Longshot's left eye glows brightly when he uses his superhuman powers. He was genetically engineered and augmented by magical means to have certain superhuman abilities. The mystical augmentation gave him the ability to affect probability fields through [[psionics|psionic]] means in order to give himself "good luck" in his activities. This allows incredibly unlikely events to happen in Longshot's favor. This power operates even when Longshot does not consciously will it to do so. This ability is tied into the positive aspects of his personality: should he attempt to use his powers for a selfish or evil act, or should he give up hope, his powers will fail to function or even backfire, giving him bad luck.<ref name=Longshot2/> Longshot's luck, however, is fickle, and can backfire if he overuses it, creating an equal and opposite "bad luck" effect elsewhere, that can affect others or even Longshot himself.<ref name=Longshot5>{{Cite comic|writer=Ann Nocenti|penciller=Arthur Adams|inker=Whilce Portacio|story=Deadly Lies|title=Longshot|volume=1|issue=5|date=January 1986|publisher=Marvel Comics|page=|panel=}}</ref><ref name=Longshot6>{{Cite comic|writer=Ann Nocenti|penciller=Arthur Adams|inker=Whilce Portacio|story=A Snake Coils|title=Longshot|volume=1|issue=6|date=February 1986|publisher=Marvel Comics|page=|panel=}}</ref>

Longshot can read "psychic imprints" that people leave on objects that they have handled, and thereby learn the thoughts that an individual had while handling the object, a phenomenon known as [[Psychometry (paranormal)|psychometry]].<ref name=Longshot1/> He can also read a person's future in this manner as well.<ref name=Longshot5/> He can also telepathically "read" the recent memories of a person by making physical contact with him or her.<ref name=Longshot3/> 

A recurring aspect of stories he appeared in was the strong, spontaneous attraction that women exhibited to him, a trait with which he was genetically engineered.<ref name=X-FactorV3#35/>

Longshot carries cleaver-like blades, stored in a bandoleer, which he hurls with inhuman accuracy or in some cases, completely dependent upon his luck powers. He is also shown as proficient in other types of bladed weaponry. During his X-Men years, Longshot also carried a folding grappling hook and rope either carried looped around one shoulder or stored in his shoulder bag, and a set of throwing spikes which produced net-like wires between them to restrain a target.

Longshot is proficient in the use of jetpacks for flight, the use of beam weapon side-arms,<ref name=Longshot2/> and [[hang gliders]].<ref name=Longshot6/>

Longshot is an extraordinary acrobat, and has superhuman agility due to having hollow bones but musculature like a human's.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Longshot===
Ultimate Longshot first appeared in ''[[Ultimate X-Men]] #54'', written by [[Brian K. Vaughan]]. In the Ultimate Universe, Longshot is not an alien but an ordinary [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] named '''Arthur Centino.''' His name is a tribute to creators [[Arthur Adams (comics)|Art Adams]] and [[Ann Nocenti]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

Centino is accused of murdering a [[Genosha]]n politician; as punishment, he is sentenced to forced participation in a [[reality show]] where he will be hunted for sport. The show is run by [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo Adams]], the Ultimate version of [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]] who in this universe is a morbidly obese, [[albino]] human with [[dreadlocks]]. One of the opponents Longshot faces is a tall, fit, red-haired hunter, the Ultimate version of [[Arcade (comics)|Arcade]].

The X-Men journey to the island Longshot is on, assuming he is innocent and was framed and thus offer to help him.  During the course of their time together, Longshot spends time charming Colossus.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #56</ref>  It is later discovered that he ''is'' guilty; he had stumbled upon his girlfriend [[Spiral (comics)#Ultimate Spiral|Spiral]] with the politician and killed him in a fit of rage. Later, Longshot is in the [[Savage Land]] foraging for food when he runs into the [[Ultimates]]' [[Scarlet Witch]], who captures him and has him imprisoned in their [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]] base. Longshot later successfully escapes from the Triskelion. During the escape, he seemingly kills [[Lady Deathstrike]], saving the lives of two of the X-Men who had freed him before. One of the others who escaped is [[Magneto (comics)#Ultimate Magneto|Magneto]], who admits that he had tipped the authorities onto Longshot's location in the first place, as part of Magneto's own escape plan; Magneto wanted Longshot and his luck power present as an "edge" to guarantee success.{{issue|date=November 2011}}

This version of Longshot despises normal human beings; he regularly uses the epithet "flatscan" when referring to them, introducing the term to the Ultimate universe.

When Longshot is last seen, the death of [[Charles Xavier]] is announced,<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #79</ref> the news reaches "Somewhere Else," apparently Magneto's latest stronghold. Longshot is seen, still bearded from his time on the run, seated on his own low stool at Magneto's right hand side, suggesting that the [[Psychopathy|sociopath]]ic young mutant holds special favor with the Master of Magnetism. This story by Robert Kirkman is entitled ''Aftermath: Part 1''.

It is later revealed that Longshot was somehow tortured and killed in the Savage Land under orders from Magneto.<ref>[[Loeb, Jeph]]. ''Ultimatum'' #3</ref>

===Shattershot===
In the alternate reality future seen at the end of the "Shattershot" storyline (which ran through the 1992 [[annual publication|annuals]] of the X-Men-related titles), a mysterious hooded figure appears in the background when the former slaves and the Spineless Ones finally make peace. The hooded figure throws back his hood, revealing himself to be an aged Longshot. He makes a philosophical pronouncement, then says "Gotcha!" as he did while he was with the X-Men.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Voiced by [[Rod Wilson (actor)|Rod Wilson]], Longshot starred in the [[X-Men animated series]] episodes "Mojovision" and "Longshot" and made a short cameo in "Jubilee's Fairytale Theatre". In "Mojovision", Longshot quit his own hit TV show leaving Mojo to kidnap the X-Men and have them replace Longshot in a new action series that had the X-Men literally fight for their lives. Barely surviving, the X-Men foiled Mojo's plans with the help of Longshot. In the episode "Longshot", the Lucky One stumbles to earth while trying to evade Mojo and his forces. Mojo once again makes the hunt a televised event with Longshot and the X-Men the targets. The X-Men prevail and Longshot returns home to continue leading the rebellion against Mojo. In this episode Longshot develops a deep respect and kinship with the X-Man [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]]. This relationship is played with in a brief cameo in the fantasy-inspired episode "Jubilee's Fairytale Theatre" where Jubilee, much like a [[Robin Hood]] type character, saves a peasant Longshot from being annihilated for his disobedience against Magnus the Magnificent, a fairytale version of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]].

===Video games===
* Longshot is a playable character in the DOS video-game called ''[[X-Men II: The Fall of the Mutants]]''. The storyline is based on the ''[[Fall of the Mutants]]'' crossover from the X-Men comics.

* An item called "The Luck of The Longshot" is available in ''[[X-Men Legends]]''.

* Longshot was intended for inclusion in the [[PlayStation Portable]] version of ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'', but was removed prior to its release. {{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}
