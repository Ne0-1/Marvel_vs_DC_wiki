'''Condor''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]].

Condor is a winged criminal scientist, and is a member of the same race of avians as [[Red Raven]].  He was a member of the [[Terrible Trio (Nova)|Terrible Trio]], along with [[Diamondhead (comics)|Diamondhead]] and [[Powerhouse (comics)#Powerhouse I (Rieg Davan)|Powerhouse]], and an enemy of [[Nova (comics)|Nova]] and the [[Champions of Xandar]].  During a battle with the [[Sphinx (Marvel Comics)#The First Sphinx|Sphinx]], he was transformed into an actual condor.

Condor spent several years in the form of animal, until he landed on the island of [[Bird-Brain]] and the Ani-Mates.  Bird-Brain recognized that the Condor was not a real animal and transformed him into a semi-humanoid.  He confronted Nova again angrily, and ultimately left feeling their conflict had been useless.

Condor later attacked Nova and [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]], but was defeated and taken into [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody.  Red Raven took this opportunity to attempt to bring the Condor back by force, hoping to place him on trial among their own people to face justice.  Red Raven led a group of Avians to assault Manhattan, but Nova managed to convince him to call off the attack.
