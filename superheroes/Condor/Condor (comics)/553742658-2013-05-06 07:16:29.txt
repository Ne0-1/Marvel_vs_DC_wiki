==Fictional character biography==
Condor is a winged criminal scientist, and is a member of the same race of avians as [[Red Raven]].  He was a member of the Terrible Trio, along with [[Diamondhead (comics)|Diamondhead]] and [[Powerhouse (comics)#Powerhouse (Rieg Davan)|Powerhouse]],{{Issue|date=April 2010}} and an enemy of [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]] and the [[Champions of Xandar]].  During a battle with the [[Sphinx (Marvel Comics)#The First Sphinx|Sphinx]], he was transformed into an actual condor.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

Condor spent several years in the form of an animal, until he landed on the island of [[Bird-Brain]] and the Ani-Mates.  Bird-Brain recognized that the Condor was not a real animal and transformed him into a semi-humanoid.  He confronted Nova again angrily, and ultimately left feeling their conflict had been useless.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

Condor later attacked Nova and [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]], but was defeated and taken into [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody.  Red Raven took this opportunity to attempt to bring the Condor back by force, hoping to place him on trial among their own people to face justice.  Red Raven led a group of Avians to assault Manhattan, but Nova managed to convince him to call off the attack.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

The Condor appeared in ''[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day|Brand New Day]]'' as one of the villains in the bar.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #562-563</ref>

It is revealed in the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] series that Condor is one of the inmates left behind in the [[Negative Zone]] 42 prison and was used to help [[Star-Lord]] communicate with Mantis telepathically to bring the other Guardians to help defend the 42 prison against [[Blastaar]] and his horde from invading earth via the non-functional portal there.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #9</ref>
