'''Condor''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]].

== Publication history ==
The Condor first appeared in ''[[Nova (comics)|Nova]]'' #2-3 (October-November 1976), and was created by [[Marv Wolfman]] and [[John Buscema]].

The character subsequently appears in ''Nova'' #6-8 (February-April 1977), #10 (June 1977), ''Nova'' #2-5 (February-May 1994), #13 (January 1995), ''Nova'' #3-4 (July-August 1999), #7 (November 1999), and ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #562-563 (August 2008).

==Fictional character biography==
Condor is a winged criminal scientist, and is a member of the same race of avians as [[Red Raven]].  He was a member of the Terrible Trio, along with [[Diamondhead (comics)|Diamondhead]] and [[Powerhouse (comics)#Powerhouse I (Rieg Davan)|Powerhouse]], and an enemy of [[Nova (comics)|Nova]] and the [[Champions of Xandar]].  During a battle with the [[Sphinx (Marvel Comics)#The First Sphinx|Sphinx]], he was transformed into an actual condor.

Condor spent several years in the form of animal, until he landed on the island of [[Bird-Brain]] and the Ani-Mates.  Bird-Brain recognized that the Condor was not a real animal and transformed him into a semi-humanoid.  He confronted Nova again angrily, and ultimately left feeling their conflict had been useless.

Condor later attacked Nova and [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]], but was defeated and taken into [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody.  Red Raven took this opportunity to attempt to bring the Condor back by force, hoping to place him on trial among their own people to face justice.  Red Raven led a group of Avians to assault Manhattan, but Nova managed to convince him to call off the attack.

The Condor appeared in ''[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day|Brand New Day]]'' as one of the villains in the bar.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #562-563</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Condor possesses two wings on his back which allow for flight. He also has enhanced superhuman strength and sharp talons on the end of each finger.
