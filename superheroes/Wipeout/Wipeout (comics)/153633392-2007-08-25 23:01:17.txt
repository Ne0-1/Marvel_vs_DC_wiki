'''Wipeout''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe. His first appearance was in ''Uncanny X-Men #235''.

Wipeout was an elderly member of the [[Press Gang (comics)|Press Gang]], otherwise known as Magistrates, super-powered enforcers of the law on the island-nation of Genosha. Being elderly, he usually stays behind in Genosha to nuetralize the prisoners brought to him by [[Pipeline (comics)|Pipeline]]. In one of his rare, few field missions, he managed to disrupt the living, sentient vehicle called [[Ship (comics)|Ship]] that X-Factor used for their headquarters. 

When an amnesiac [[Havok (X-Men)|Havok]] was brainwashed into serving as a Genoshan magistrate, the insane [[Cameron Hodge]] killed Wipeout to frame Havok, who was slowly remembering his true loyalties to the [[X-Men]].

==Powers==
Wipeout was capable of removing a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant's]] [[superhuman]] powers by creating a self-perpetuating energy "block" in their system that prevented bio-genetic power from properly traveling from their "x-factor" [[gene]] to the rest of their system. This power block lasted indefinitely and required no concentration to maintain -- "wiped" mutants stayed powerless even after Wipeout fell [[Sleep|asleep]] and after he was killed. He could mentally remove these blocks at will if he chose to.
