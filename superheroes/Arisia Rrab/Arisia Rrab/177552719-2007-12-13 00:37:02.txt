==Fictional character biography==
===Green Lantern Corps===
'''Arisia''' is originally from the planet Graxos IV.  Her father, Fentara, served as the [[Green Lantern]] of Sector 2815.  Eventually, Arisia assumed the role of Green Lantern of her sector as a teenager (Arisia's age was retconned in issue 13 of the latest ''Green Lantern'' book, revealing that "due to the elongated orbit around its two suns, thirteen years on Graxos IV were like two-hundred and forty on Earth")

Arisia first appears in ''Tales of the Green Lantern Corps'' #1 (May [[1981]]) as part of a large group of [[Green Lantern]]s sent to thwart [[Krona (comics)|Krona]] and [[Nekron]].  She is one of the Green Lanterns, along with [[Katma Tui]], [[Salakk]], [[Ch'p (comics)|Ch'p]] (who referred to her as the "big cutie") and [[Kilowog]], who relocate to Earth after the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''.  Once she relocated to Earth, she adopted the secret identity of '''Cindy Simpson''', and redesigned the uniforms of the team to better reflect their individual personalities.

Arisia had a huge crush on [[Hal Jordan]], the Green Lantern of Sector 2814.  After being stationed on Earth with Jordan, she subconsciously used her power ring to age herself so that she and Jordan could be together.  Though Hal Jordan ultimately returned Arisia's affections, it was some time before he came to terms with her as an adult.

Later, due to disruption in the Main Battery on the planet [[Oa]] from which the Green Lanterns drew their power, several Green Lanterns, including Arisia, lost their powers.  However, Arisia decided to remain on Earth with her boyfriend Hal Jordan and pursue a modeling career.  Their relationship became strained as they adjusted to the changes affecting the Corps and they eventually broke up.

===Powerless===
After her break-up with Hal Jordan, Arisia began developing her friendship with Kilowog.  During one visit, an accidental blow to the head caused memory loss and triggered a return to her 13-year-old mentality.  She sought out the only person she felt could help her: Hal Jordan.

She returned to Ferris Aircraft desperate to find Jordan.  Following an attack by the [[New Guardians|New Guardian]] [[Floronic Man|Floro]], she was reunited with Jordan.  After a short time, her memories slowly began to return, yet she still wasn't ready for the responsibility of being a Green Lantern again.  She came up with the idea of being Hal's back-up, like Guy Gardner and [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]] were, but the idea was rejected.

Over time, her memories returned completely, and soon she sought Guy Gardner's help to find the missing Kilowog.  Arisia offered to go to [[Oa]] with Gardner and the [[Justice League Task Force]], since her knowledge of Oa could be an asset to the group.  Gardner turns her down because her lack of powers would be more hindrance than help.  Arisia then returned, armed to the teeth, and demanded to join them.

They soon discovered the skeletal remains of Kilowog on Oa and were attacked by Hal Jordan.  She survived the attack and, upon returning to Earth, began working at Gardner's new bar: ''Warrior's''.

On opening day, Arisia learned of Hal Jordan's supposed death from [[Kyle Rayner]].  The next day, she discovered the truth when Jordan returned.  He changed Arisia back into her Green Lantern costume, offering her a return to the way things were.  Arisia argued that things had changed, and she tells him that he was not the man he once had been and asks him to leave.

While working at ''Warriors's'', Arisia makes friends with [[Buck Wargo]], [[Desmond Farr]] AKA 'Tiger-Man' and the rest of the 'monster-hunters'. Joined later by Lead from the [[Metal Men]] and a time-lost [[Lady Blackhawk]], they act as bouncers and battle various villains that attack the bar. During this time Arisia demonstrats enhanced healing abillities.

===Murdered===
[[Image:arisia05.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The murder of Arisia by Major Force in ''Guy Gardner: Warrior'' #43.]]
Eventually, a mysterious woman with ties to the equally mysterious organization known only as the "Quorum" tried to cast a spell over [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]] and gain control of his actions.  Because of Veronna, who had sworn to protect the Warrior, Guy escaped the grasp of the woman who could have any man she desired.  In mid-fight with enemies, the resurrected [[Major Force]] seems to be looking for Veronna as well.  Though unsuccessful, he was only too happy to dispense with any of Guy's friends that he came across.  At Warrior's, Arisia was unprepared for an attack by Major Force, who suffocates her to death (''Guy Gardner: Warrior'' #43).

Major Force calls Guy Gardner out, the villain delivering a picture of Arisia.  Though Major Force would later return, Gardner seemingly put down Major Force and avenged Arisia.  At her funeral, Hal Jordan, again in his Parallax guise, appears beside Guy Gardner to give his final respects to the woman he had once loved.  Before quietly leaving, he created a floating green hologram of Arisia above her body (''Guy Gardner: Warrior'' #44).

===Resurrection===
[[Image:arisia07.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Arisia, back from the dead, from ''Green Lantern'' v4, #12]]

After regaining his Green Lantern status, Hal Jordan travels to the [[Manhunters (comics)|Manhunters]]' homeworld of Biot with Guy Gardner and discovers dozens of missing Green Lanterns (including those Hal had left for dead during ''"[[Emerald Twilight]]"'') in suspended animation, kept as batteries to power the [[Hank Henshaw|Cyborg Superman]] and the overhauled Manhunters.  Hal wakes several of the Green Lanterns, but they attack him, believing he is still their enemy.

Hal finds Arisia unconscious and cocooned in a cavern wall and frees her.  The [[Hank Henshaw|Cyborg Superman]] reveals that after Arisia was murdered by Major Force and buried, her species' natural healing abilities revived her underground.  Henshaw sent his Manhunters to retrieve her and bring her to Biot.  Fully restored, Arisia fights by Hal's side, helping him destroy Biot. The status of a relationship with Hal is in doubt, however, they did share a kiss.

Arisia was most recently seen fighting the [[Sinestro Corps]] off Oa along with [[Kilowog]] and many of the rookie members of the Corps.  She seems to have a professional connection to [[Sodam Yat]], the Green Lantern of [[Daxam]], but still only has feelings for Hal. She is shown to have a slight disdain for Yat based on his cocky attitude.
