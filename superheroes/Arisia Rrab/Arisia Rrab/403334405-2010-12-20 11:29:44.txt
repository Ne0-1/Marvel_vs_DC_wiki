Arisia is named after the planet Arisia in the ''[[Lensman]]'' novels by [[E.E. Smith]]. Along with Eddore of Tront, she was created by writer [[Mike W. Barr]] as a tip of the hat to the groundbreaking series in his ''Tales of the Green Lantern Corps'' miniseries in 1981.

== Fictional character biography ==
=== Green Lantern Corps ===
Arisia is originally from the planet Graxos IV. Her father, Fentara, served as the [[Green Lantern]] of Sector 2815.<ref name="dc-ency"/> In ''Blackest Night: Tales of the Corps'' #3, it's revealed that (in a rare occurrence) all of the Green Lanterns preceding her father belong to their lineage as well. After her father meets his demise while serving the Corps, her uncle Blish is the next chosen to serve as the Lantern of her sector. Blish too eventually gives his life serving the Corps and Arisia is selected as his replacement on her next birthday, making her at least the fifth member of the family to serve as a Green Lantern.<ref name="tales3">''Blackest Night: Tales of the Corps'' #3 (July 2009)</ref> Originally, Arisia is depicted as assuming the role of Green Lantern while still a teenager. Her age was later [[retcon]]ned in issue 13 of ''Green Lantern'' volume 4; revealing that "due to the elongated orbit around its two suns, thirteen years on Graxos IV were like two-hundred and forty on Earth." 

Arisia first appears in ''Tales of the Green Lantern Corps'' #1 (May 1981) as part of a large group of [[Green Lantern]]s sent to thwart [[Krona (comics)|Krona]] and [[Nekron]]. She, [[Katma Tui]], [[Salaak]], [[Ch'p (comics)|Ch'p]] (who refers to her as the "big cutie"), and [[Kilowog]] all relocate to Earth after the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''. Once there, she adopts the secret identity of '''Cindy Simpson''', and redesigns the uniforms of the team to better reflect their individual personalities. Arisia is first shown as having a huge crush on [[Hal Jordan]], the Green Lantern of Sector 2814. After being stationed on Earth with Jordan, she subconsciously uses her power ring to age herself so that she and Jordan can be together.  Though Hal Jordan ultimately returns Arisia's affections, it is some time before he comes to terms with her as an adult. Later, Arisia is among several Green Lanterns to lose their powers due to a disruption in the Main Battery on the planet [[Oa]] (the source from which the Green Lanterns draw their power). However, Arisia decides to remain on Earth with her boyfriend Hal and pursue a modeling career. Their relationship becomes strained as they adjust to the changes affecting the Corps, which eventually leads to them breaking up.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

=== Powerless ===
After her break-up with Hal Jordan, Arisia begins developing her friendship with Kilowog.  During one visit, an accidental blow to the head causes her to suffer from memory loss and triggers a return to her 13-year-old mentality. She seeks out the only person she believes can help her: Hal Jordan. She returns to Ferris Aircraft, desperate to find Jordan, and (following an attack by the [[New Guardians|New Guardian]] [[Floronic Man|Floro]]) is reunited with him. After a short time, her memories slowly begin to return, yet she still isn't ready for the responsibility of being a Green Lantern again. Though she initially offers to return to the Corps as Hal's back-up, like Guy Gardner and [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]], the idea is rejected.

Over time, her memories return completely, and she seeks Guy Gardner's help in finding the missing Kilowog. Arisia offers to go to Oa with Gardner and the [[Justice League Task Force]], as her knowledge of Oa would be an asset to the group. Gardner turns her down due to her lack of powers being more hindrance than help. After her rejection, Arisia returns armed to the teeth, and demands to join them. On Oa, they discover the skeletal remains of Kilowog and are attacked by Hal Jordan.  She survives the attack and, upon returning to Earth, begins working at Gardner's new bar: ''Warrior's''. On opening day, Arisia learns of Hal Jordan's supposed death from [[Kyle Rayner]]; though it's not long before Jordan arrives himself, proving the rumor false. He changes Arisia back into her Green Lantern costume and offers to return things to the way they were. Arisia argues that things have changed and that he is not the man he once was, asking him to leave.

While working at Warrior's, Arisia befriends [[Buck Wargo]] and [[Desmond Farr]] (aka Tiger-Man). Joined later by Lead from the [[Metal Men]] and a time-lost [[Lady Blackhawk]], they act as bouncers, battling various villains that attack the bar. During this time Arisia demonstrates enhanced healing abilities.

=== Murdered ===
A mysterious woman with ties to the equally enigmatic organization known only as "the Quorum" tries to cast a spell over [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]] and gain control of his actions. Due to Veronna's aid, who has sworn to protect the Warrior, Guy escapes the grasp of his assailant. In the midst of the conflict, the resurrected [[Major Force]] arrives looking for Veronna as well. Though unsuccessful, he is only too happy to dispense with any of Guy's allies whom he crosses paths with. Arisia, unprepared for an attack by Major Force, is suffocated to death despite attempts to defend herself.<ref name="dc-ency"/><ref name="ggw43">''Guy Gardner: Warrior'' (vol 1) #43 (June 1996)</ref> After Arisia's defeat, Major Force calls Guy Gardner out by delivering a picture of her. In the ensuing fight, Gardner kills him. At her funeral, Hal Jordan (again in his Parallax guise), appears beside Guy Gardner to give his final respects to the woman he had once loved.  Before leaving, he creates a floating green hologram of Arisia above her body.<ref name="ggw43">''Guy Gardner: Warrior'' (vol 1) #44 (July 1996)</ref>

=== Resurrection and beyond ===
After regaining his Green Lantern status, Hal Jordan travels to the [[Manhunters (comics)|Manhunters]]' homeworld of Biot with Guy Gardner. There they discover dozens of missing Green Lanterns (including those Hal had left for dead during "[[Emerald Twilight]]") in suspended animation being kept as batteries to power the [[Hank Henshaw|Cyborg Superman]] and the overhauled Manhunters. Hal wakes several of the Green Lanterns, but they attack him, believing he is still their enemy.<ref>''Green Lantrtn'' vol. 4 #12 (July 2006)</ref> He finds Arisia unconscious and cocooned in a cavern wall and frees her. The Cyborg Superman reveals that after Arisia was murdered by Major Force and buried, her species' natural healing abilities revived her underground.  Henshaw sent his Manhunters to retrieve her and bring her to Biot. Fully restored, Arisia fights by Hal's side, helping him destroy the planet. Though a relationship between the two is never restored, they do share a kiss.<ref>''Green Lantrtn'' vol. 4 #13 (September 2006)</ref>

Arisia was shown fighting the [[Sinestro Corps]] off Oa along with Kilowog and many of the rookie members of the Corps. The Guardians place her in a supervisory position over [[Sodam Yat]], the Green Lantern of [[Daxam]], as he is predicted to be an important part of the Corps survival. Arisia initially has difficulty in this role as Yat has a tendency of ignoring orders. Arisia, along with most of the Corps, participates in the universe-wide [[Sinestro Corps War]], which includes several important battles on her former home: Earth.

Following the events of the Sinestro Corps War, Arisia continues to partner with Sodam Yat, now the host of the [[Ion (comics)|Ion entity]]. They have been working to free Daxam from [[Mongul]] and his faction of the Sinestro Corps.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' vol. 2 #35 (April 2009)</ref><ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' vol. 2 #36 (May 2009)</ref> They only succeed when Sodam sacrifices himself by entering Daxam's sun and turning it yellow.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' vol. 2 #37 (June 2009)</ref> On her return to Oa, Arisia finds the planet overrun by [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lanterns]], with the reanimated corpses of her family among them.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #40 (September 2009)</ref>

After the ''Blackest Night'' crisis, Arisia visits the meeting hall, she furious at the Guardians over the fact of Sodam's death. The Guardians confesses that it was [[Scar (comics)|Scar]] responsible for Sodam's death, they not knowing Scar suspected.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #47 (April 2010)</ref> Meanwhile, Arisia is having a nightmare about Sodam's death. Arisia implying that Sodam might still be alive.<ref>''Green Lantern: Emerald Warriors'' #2 (September 2010)</ref>
