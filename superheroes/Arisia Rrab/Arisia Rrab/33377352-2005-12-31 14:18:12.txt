'''Arisia''' is a fictional character featured in [[comic books]] published by [[DC Comics]].

Arisia first appeared in ''Tales of the Green Lantern Corps'' #1 (May, [[1981]]) as part of a large group of [[Green Lantern]]s sent to thwart [[Krona (comics)|Krona]] and [[Nekron]]. She was one of the Green Lanterns, along with [[Katma Tui]], [[Salakk]], [[Ch'p (comics)|Ch'p]] (who referred to her as the "big cutie") and [[Kilowog]], sent to Earth after the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]].

Arisia had a huge crush on [[Hal Jordan]], the Green Lantern of Sector 2814. After she was stationed on Earth with Jordan she subconciously used her power ring to age herself so that she and Jordan could be together. 

Arisia was killed by [[Major Force]] in ''[[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner: Warrior]]'' #43 (June, [[1996]]).
