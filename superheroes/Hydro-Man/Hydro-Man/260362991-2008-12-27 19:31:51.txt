== Fictional character biography ==
'''Morris "Morrie" Bench''' gains his [[superpowers]] while as a [[crewman]] on the cargo ship the [[USS|U.S.S.]] Bulldog, having been knocked overboard while a powerful experimental generator is being tested in the ocean.  The combination of unknown radiation and his immersion in a deep ocean dwelling bacteria turns him into the Hydro-Man. After his transformation, he encounters [[Spider-Man]] for the first time.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #212</ref> Soon after that, he becomes merged with the [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] into a composite mud/quicksand-like creature.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #217-218</ref> Hydro-Man is a typical low rent super criminal, joining [[supervillain]] teams such as the [[Sinister Syndicate]]<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #280-281</ref>, including that of the [[Frightful Four]]. While working with the Sinister Syndicate, Hydro-Man demonstrates a willingness to put up with just about anything in the name of financial gain. He ignores the constant politicking of the other members and looks past the [[Abner Jenkins|Beetle]]'s betrayal of the group to the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] in the belief that the group was economically beneficial to him. 

For some time, Hydro Man served in [[Crimson Cowl (Justine Hammer)|Crimson Cowl]]'s Masters of Evil and he battling the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].<ref>''Thunderbolts Annual 1997'' </ref><ref>''Thunderbolts'' #67</ref> After the disintegration of the group, he began to cooperate with the [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]].<ref>''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' #51-52</ref> He was hired by the [[Green Goblin]] to be part of his Spider-Man killing group the [[Sinister Twelve]], but was defeated.<ref>''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' #10-11</ref>

Morris was one of the 46 villains to escape [[The Raft (comics)|the Raft]] when [[Sauron (comics)|Sauron]] was broken out by [[Electro (comics)|Electro]].<ref>''New Avengers'' #1-4</ref>

===Post-''Civil War''===
After ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'', he is seen alongside [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]] and [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]]. This group attempts to rob Baily's Auction House but are interrupted by Spider-Man and then Initiative members [[War Machine]] and [[Komodo (comics)#Character from Avengers: The Initiative|Komodo]]. The latter are there to neutralize Spider-Man. The trio escapes, only to be found and attacked by government operatives called 'Scarlet Spiders'.<ref>''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #3</ref>

When a member of Wizard's Frightful Five, Hydro-Man received a costume from Wizard that is made from the same material as the Human Torch's costume. In the Frightful Five's fight with the Fantastic Four, Hydro-Man was frozen in Titan's atmosphere.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #547-549</ref>

Hydro-Man has been hired by the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the [[Registration Acts (comics)|Superhuman Registration Act]].<ref>''New Avengers'' #35</ref>

===Brand New Day===
Hydro-Man recently appeared in ''[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day|Brand New Day]]'' as one of the villains in the Bar with No Name.

== Powers and abilities ==
Hydro-Man is able to bodily transform himself into a watery liquid substance; he can access secure areas and small openings with relative ease; when his bodily mass is dispersed in this form it simply reforms, albeit slowly depending on how far apart the mass was. All of Hydro-Man's cells remain fully under his control when he is in his liquid state. Hydro-Man can also merge with and manipulate larger bodies of water when he is in his water form.  He can increase his mass and cause tidal waves. He can turn parts of his body to liquid while retaining the rest of his human form, allowing him to slip from a foe's grasp or have projectiles like bullets harmlessly pass through him. Through great mental exertion, Hydro-Man can also turn to ice and steam. Other examples of manipulating his watery form include firing off small streams such as a fire hose, shaping parts of his body into 'solid-water', constructs, and mixing himself with other compounds for different effects. However, this last example can be used against him, since certain substances can either harden him (like cement or concrete), or make him feel sick (such as fire-extinguishers and chlorine). The [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]] enhanced his powers, through the use of sophisticated equipment. These artificial enhancements granted him increased and more precise control over bodies of water and moisture near him, which he demonstrated by absorbing nearly all the moisture in The [[Trapster]]'s body.

Hydro-Man possesses a certain degree of superhuman strength, and has been shown to be an exceptionally skilled fighter, and adept at using his powers for that purpose. In some incarnations, depending on the writer, Hydro-Man can form his forearms into weapons such as [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] does, except that Bench's weapons are made of ice.

Bench has extensive experience in street-fighting techniques due to his experience as a criminal before his transformation. Though cunning, he has been consistently depicted by writers as a low tier henchman with little formal education and is often tricked into using his powers in ways that incapacitate him (as explained above). His normal attire consists of a black shirt and blue/or green pants, as well as a costume invented by the Wizard.

==Other versions==
