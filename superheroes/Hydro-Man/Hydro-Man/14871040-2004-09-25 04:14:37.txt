'''Hydro-Man''' is the name of a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He is a frequent antagonist of [[Spider-Man]] and an occasional ally of [[The Sandman (Marvel Comics)|The Sandman]] and the [[Frightful Four]].

Formerly a crewman on a cargo ship, Morris Bench was involved in an accident with an experimental generator and volcanic gasses.  The result was a mutation granting him the ability to transform his body into a liquid, water-like substance. Being able to transform into a watery substance, Hydro-man can access secure areas and small openings with relative ease and when his bodily mass is dispersed in this form it simply reforms, albeit slowly depending on how far apart the mass was. Hydro-Man can also merge with and manipulate larger bodies of water when he is in his water form. He sought to use this new ability for criminal purposes, becoming "Hydro-Man" and coming into conflict with the costumed crimefighter Spider-Man.

Though possessing no superhuman abilities aside from his ability to transform into water, Morris is physically strong (for a normal human) and a skilled brawler.  He is not among Spider-Man's brightest foes and is often tricked into electrocuting himself or mixing his water form with concrete.  He does not seem to possess even an elementary understanding of physical science.
