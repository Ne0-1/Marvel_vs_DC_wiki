'''Hydro-Man''' (Morris Bench) is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He is a frequent antagonist of [[Spider-Man]] and an occasional ally of [[The Sandman (Marvel Comics)|The Sandman]] and the [[Frightful Four]], and a member of the [[Masters of Evil]].

==Character history==


==Powers and abilities==
Being able to transform into a watery substance, Hydro-man can access secure areas and small openings with relative ease and when his bodily mass is dispersed in this form it simply reforms, albeit slowly depending on how far apart the mass was. All of Hydro-Man's molecules remain fully under his control even when he is in his liquid state, as his consciousness apparently exists as a sort of vapor in this state. Hydro-Man can also merge with and manipulate larger bodies of water when he is in his water form. He can turn parts of his body to liquid while retaining the rest of his human form, allowing him to slip from a foe's grasp or have projectiles like bullets harmlessly pass through him. With concentration, Hydro-Man can also turn to ice and steam, but this exerts him greatly depending on the ambient temperature. Other examples of manipulating his watery form include firing off small streams at high velocities like bullets, shaping parts of his body into 'solid-water' constructs, and mixing himself with other compounds for different effects. However, this last example can be used against him, since certain substances can either harden him (like cement or concrete), or make him feel sick (such as fire-extinguishers and chlorine). Recently, The Wizard enhanced his powers, giving him control over all water near him, which he demonstrated by absorbing nearly all the moisture in The Trapster's body.

Though possessing no superhuman abilities aside from his ability to transform into water, Morris is physically strong (for a normal human) and a skilled brawler.  He is not among Spider-Man's brightest foes and is often tricked into electrocuting himself or mixing his water form with concrete.  He does not seem to possess even an elementary understanding of physical science. As with [[Electro (comics)|Electro]] and Sandman, Hydro-Man would be a much more dangerous opponent if he were fully aware of the possibilities his powers afford him.

==In Other Media==
[[Image:Spidermanep16.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Hydro-Man in Neogenic Nightmare, Chapter III: "Hydro-Man" episode of [[Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]]]
In ''[[Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'', Hydro-Man was played by [[Rob Paulsen]]. Here, he was portrayed as [[Mary Jane Watson]]'s former boyfriend. In the entire episode, Hydro-Man stalked Mary Jane and Spider-Man tried to stop him, but Hydro-Man was too powerful in battle as he can create and control water. In the end of the episode, Spider-Man and Mary Jane worked together to defeating Hydro-Man once and for all. They led him away from any water source, weakening him so much that when he tried to attack Spider-Man, he collapsed and, too weak to regenerate, ended up evaporated. 

In Episode #59, [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Dr. Miles Warren]] created the clone of Hydro-Man, using what was left of the original Hydro-Man from the ground he was killed in. However, the clone was still in love with Mary Jane.  So it demanded that Warren would make a clone of Mary Jane as well.  Even though it was hard to clone Mary Jane (she fell into a dimensional portal in Episode #41), Warren succeeded but Mary Jane's clone decided to be with Peter than Hydro-Man. When all that was revealed in the next episode, Warren figured out the clones were not stable and will vapourize. The clone of Hydro-Man went first and before MJ's clone.

Hydro-Man appeared in the 1994 [[Fantastic Four (1994 TV series)|Fantastic Four]] television series except he was voiced by [[Brad Garrett]]. In his appearance, he is a member of the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]]'s [[Frightful Four]].
