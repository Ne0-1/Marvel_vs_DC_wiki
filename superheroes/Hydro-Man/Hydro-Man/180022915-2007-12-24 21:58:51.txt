'''Hydro-Man''' ('''Morris Bench''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. 

== Fictional character biography ==
Morris "Morrie" Bench was born in the [[Bronx]], New York.  He gains his powers while a crewman on a cargo ship, having been knocked overboard while a powerful experimental generator is being tested in the ocean.  The combination of unknown radiation and his immersion in a deep ocean dwelling bacterian turns him into Hydro-Man.  He is a frequent antagonist of [[Spider-Man]] and an occasional ally/enemy of the [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]]. 

He has been a member of multiple villain teams in the [[Marvel Universe]], including the [[Frightful Four]], the [[Sinister Syndicate]], the [[Masters of Evil]], and the [[Sinister Six#Sinister Twelve|Sinister Twelve]].  Morrie holds a wary view of Sandman, as the two were once merged into a mud/quicksand-like creature.

He battles the Fantastic Four during the ''[[Acts of Vengeance]]'', a multi-part crossover involving much of the [[Marvel Universe]].

While working with the Sinister Syndicate, Hydro-Man demonstrates a willingness to put up with just about anything in the name of financial gain. He ignores the constant politicking of the other members and looks past the [[Abner Jenkins|Beetle]]'s betrayal of the group to the [[Wilson Fisk|Kingpin]] in the belief that the group was economically beneficial to him.  

Hydro-Man is seen in the employ (or rather, being terminated from) [[Justin Hammer|Hammer Industries]].  He then teams up with [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]] in an attempt to rob a federal reserve bank. He is accidentally evaporated by one of the Shocker's blasts. 

Hydro-Man temporarily takes a job as a water-park employee. This is interrupted by a feud between Spiderman and the [[Human Torch]] that Hydro-Man mistakes as an attempt to harass him. Hydro-Man would later confront the Human Torch again as part of the [[Frightful Four]].

He appears again in writer [[Mark Millar]]'s Marvel Knights run, first attempting to buy the [[Venom (comics)|Venom]] [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] for his girlfriend, then later as part of the [[Sinister Twelve]]. 

Hydro-Man teams up with old allies [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]] and The Shocker to rob Baily's Auction House. They are confronted on the roof by Spider-Man.  The battle is joined by [[Komodo (comics)|Komodo]] and [[War Machine]] who attempt to neutralize and capture Spider-Man.  The trio escapes, only to be attacked by government operatives designed to look like Spider-Man.

After this, he appears as a member of the Wizard's Frightful Four again. He was defeated when [[Invisible Woman|Sue Storm]] threw him into [[Titan (Marvel Comics)|Titan]]'s atmosphere, where he instantly freezes.

Hydro-Man appears amongst the villains who were recruited to join [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s crime syndicate.

== Powers and abilities ==
Being able to transform into a watery substance, Hydro-Man can access secure areas and small openings with relative ease and when his bodily mass is dispersed in this form it simply reforms, albeit slowly depending on how far apart the mass was.  All of Hydro-Man's cells remain fully under his control even when he is in his liquid state, as his consciousness apparently resides in every cell in his body.  Hydro-Man can also merge with and manipulate larger bodies of water when he is in his water form.  He can turn parts of his body to liquid while retaining the rest of his human form, allowing him to slip from a foe's grasp or have projectiles like bullets harmlessly pass through him.  With concentration Hydro-Man can also turn to ice and steam, but this exerts him greatly depending on the ambient temperature. Other examples of manipulating his watery form include firing off small streams such as a fire hose, shaping parts of his body into 'solid-water', constructs, and mixing himself with other compounds for different effects. However, this last example can be used against him, since certain substances can either harden him (like cement or concrete), or make him feel sick (such as fire-extinguishers and chlorine). Recently, The [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]] enhanced his powers, giving him control over all water near him, which he demonstrated by absorbing nearly all the moisture in The [[Trapster]]'s body. He can grow extremely large and cause huge tidal waves.

Hydro-Man also possess a certain degree of superhuman strength enabling him to lift about 1500 pounds, and has been shown to be an exceptionally skilled fighter, and quite cunning when it comes to using his powers. Though the larger he expands by himself or with another body of water his strength increases. Also in some incarnations, depending on the writer, Hydro-Man can form his fore arms into weapons such as [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] does. Only Bench's weapons are made of ice.

He also reverts to his liquid form when asleep, and must sleep in a water tight container or else he will drain away.  In the story "Senseless Violence" a leaky bathtub led to him waking up one morning under the streets of New York.

===Appearance===
Hydro-Man is one of the few Marvel supervillains who does not normally wear a "conventional" costume. Instead he usually appears in a black t-shirt and blue or green jeans. This is similar to the other Spider-Man villain, [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]].

While appearing as a member of the Sinister Twelve he appeared in a blue, turquoise, and silver jumpsuit which flows with him in the same manner as the unstable molecules the [[Fantastic Four]] use. He also wears this suit during his stint with the [[Frightful Four]].

==Other versions==
===Spider-Man: Reign===
Hydro-Man appears in ''[[Spider-Man: Reign]]'' as a member of the [[Sinister Six]]. He only appears briefly in the last part with [[Electro (comics)|Electro]], coming out of a sprinkler in a building. Spider-Man makes Electro slip and touch Hydro-Man; the two are killed due to Electro's powers shorting out in water.

==In other media==
[[Image:Spidermanep16.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Hydro-Man in Neogenic Nightmare, Chapter III: "Hydro-Man" episode of the [[Spider-Man: The Animated Series|''Spider-Man'' animated series]]]]
In the 1994 ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' animated series, Hydro-Man was voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]]. Here, he was portrayed as [[Mary Jane Watson]]'s former boyfriend. In his self-titled episode, Hydro-Man stalked Mary Jane and Spider-Man tried to stop him, but Hydro-Man proved too powerful in battle due to his ability to create, control, and even become the water itself. In the end of the episode, Spider-Man and Mary Jane worked together to defeat Hydro-Man once and for all. They led him away from any water source, weakening him so much that when he tried to attack Spider-Man, he collapsed and, too weak to regenerate, evaporated. In "The Return of Hydro-Man", [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Dr. Miles Warren]] created the clone of Hydro-Man, using what was left of the original Hydro-Man from the ground where he evaporated. However, the clone was still in love with Mary Jane, so it demanded that Warren would make a clone of Mary Jane as well. Even though it was hard to clone Mary Jane (she fell into a dimensional portal in Episode #41), Warren succeeded but Mary Jane's clone decided to be with Peter than Hydro-Man. When all that was revealed in the next episode, Warren figured out the clones were not stable and would vaporize. The clone of Hydro-Man went first, followed by Mary Jane's clone.

Hydro-Man appeared in the 1994 [[Fantastic Four (1994 TV series)|Fantastic Four]] episode "And the Wind Cries Medusa" voiced by [[Brad Garrett]]. In this appearance, he is a member of the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]]'s [[Frightful Four]]. On a related note, the episode he appeared in aired a week after his appearance in the 1994 Spider-Man TV series.

=== Video Games ===
Hydro-Man also appeared in the Spider-Man [[Questprobe]] game.

Hydro-Man also appeared in the Spider-Man Animated Series game for [[Super Nintendo]] while in the ''Sewer Level''.

=== Theme Park ===
Hydro-Man can be seen in the [[Islands of Adventure]] ride ''[[The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man]]'' as one of the villains.
