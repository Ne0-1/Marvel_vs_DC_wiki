'''Hydro-Man''' (Morris Bench) is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] in [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He is a frequent antagonist of [[Spider-Man]] and an occasional ally of [[The Sandman (Marvel Comics)|The Sandman]] and the [[Frightful Four]], and a member of the [[Masters of Evil]].

==Character History==

Formerly a crewman on a cargo ship, Morris Bench was lowering an experimental generator into the ocean, in an area filled with volcanic gasses. He was accidentally knocked overboard by Spider-Man, who was fighting [[Namor]] at the time. A strange combination of the generator, volcanic gasses and seawater resulted in a mutation granting him the ability to transform his body into a liquid, water-like substance. Horrified at what he had become, he sought out revenge on all who were responsible, including Spider-Man. Morris, taking the name of Hydro-Man, also began to be involved in criminal activities, which resulted in him fighting Spider-Man numerous times.

At one point, Hydro-Man and Sandman fought against Spider-Man, resulting in a fierce fight between the two villains and the hero. However, in the midst of the battle, the Sandman and Hydro-Man were fused into one being, a monster made of [[mud]]. This monster defeated Spider-Man, but was defeated itself by the [[NYPD]]. Eventually the two beings separated, and Hydro-Man ended up joining the [[Sinister Syndicate]]. Most recently, Hydro-Man joined the [[Green Goblin]]'s [[Sinister Twelve]] and fought against Spider-Man and [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]], but was defeated by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and is likely currently in jail.

==Powers and abilities==

Being able to transform into a watery substance, Hydro-man can access secure areas and small openings with relative ease and when his bodily mass is dispersed in this form it simply reforms, albeit slowly depending on how far apart the mass was. All of Hydro-Man's molecules remain fully under his control even when he is in his liquid state, as his consciousness apparently exists as a sort of vapor in this state. Hydro-Man can also merge with and manipulate larger bodies of water when he is in his water form. He can turn parts of his body to liquid while retaining the rest of his human form, allowing him to slip from a foe's grasp or have projectiles like bullets harmlessly pass through him. With concentration, Hydro-Man can also turn to ice and steam, but this exerts him greatly depending on the ambient temperature.

Though possessing no superhuman abilities aside from his ability to transform into water, Morris is physically strong (for a normal human) and a skilled brawler.  He is not among Spider-Man's brightest foes and is often tricked into electrocuting himself or mixing his water form with concrete.  He does not seem to possess even an elementary understanding of physical science. As with [[Electro (comics)|Electro]] and Sandman, Hydro-Man would be a much more dangerous opponent if he were fully aware of the possibilities his powers afford him.
