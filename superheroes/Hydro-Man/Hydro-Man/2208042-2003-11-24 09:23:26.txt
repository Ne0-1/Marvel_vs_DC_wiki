'''Hydro-man''' is the name of a fictional super villain in the [[Spider-Man]] comicbook.  Formerly a crewman on a cargo ship, Morris Bench, was involved in an accident with an experimental generator and volcanic gasses.  The result was a body-wide mutagenic effect.  Morris now had the ability to transform his body into a liquid-like substance and sought to use this new ability for criminal purposes.  He then became "Hydro-man" and came into conflict with the costumed crimefighter, [[Spider-Man]].

Though possessing no superhuman abilities aside from his ability to transform into water, Morris is physically strong (for a normal human) and a very skilled streetfighter.  He is not among Spider-Man's brightest foes and is often tricked into electrocuting himself or mixing his water form with concrete.  He does not seem to possess even an elementary school understanding of physical science.
