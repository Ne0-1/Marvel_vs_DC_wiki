'''The Locust''' was a one-time [[supervillain]] foe of [[X-Men|the X-Men]]. He made his debut in (Uncanny) [[X-Men]] #24 in [[September]] [[1966]]. His alter ego is [[Doctor]] [[August Hopper]], once a top name in [[entomology]], whose "crackpot theories" cost him his job. He relocated to Ryan Chemicals, where he developed a Magno-Ray which causes insects to grow to enormous sizes. He sends an army of raging locusts, grasshoppers, wasps, and beetles to overthrow the world, but is eventually thwarted by the X-Men and surrenders to the authorities. 

The Locust, as his name suggests, dresses like a giant [[locust]] and uses a personal [[jet pack]] to fly around. Along with his army of insects, Locust also carries a ray gun into battle.
