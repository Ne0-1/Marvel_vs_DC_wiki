==Publication history==
The fictional character of the Ringer was initially introduced in the Marvel comic book ''[[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]'' issue #51 (September 1977), and was created by writer [[David Anthony Kraft]] and artist [[Keith Giffen]]. He subsequently appeared in ''[[Spider-Man|Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #58 (September 1981).

The Ringer was one of the victims featured in the 1986 storyline involving the ''[[Scourge of the Underworld]]'' which spanned over several titles, where numerous minor supervillains were murdered by a vigilante. He was killed in the "Bar With No Name" massacre along with 17 other supervillains in ''[[Captain America]]'' #319 (January 1986). It was this massacre that served as the climax to the storyline, which gave Captain America the clues he needed to find and stop the killer.

The Ringer has made posthumous appearances in ''[[She-Hulk|Sensational She-Hulk]]'' #53 (July 1993) and #59 (January 1994), and the intercompany crossover ''Avengers/JLA'' #4 (December 2003).

He later appeared again in ''Code of Honor'' #3 (April 1997), a series that took place before the massacre. A "proto-husk" of the Ringer, an artificial copy of him, appeared in ''Deadpool'' #0 (December 1998), and was destroyed by [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]].

The Ringer's wife, [[Leila Davis]], survived him and became a supervillain in her own right, first appearing in the miniseries ''Deadly Foes of Spider-Man'' #1-4 (May-August 1991), and subsequently appearing as '''Hardshell''' in the miniseries ''Lethal Foes of Spider-Man'' #1-4 (September-December 1993), and as the new '''[[Beetle (comics)#Leila Davis|Beetle]]''' in issues #48-56 of the ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' series (March-November 2001).

The Ringer appeared in flashbacks during a number of Leila's appearances. In fact, in a flashback in ''Lethal Foes of Spider-Man'' #4, it was revealed that Davis had barely survived the massacre, and was transformed into a cyborg named '''Strikeback'''. Strikeback appeared as himself in issues #3-4 of ''Lethal Foes of Spider-Man''. However, he was killed off again, off-panel this time, as shown in a flashback in ''Thunderbolts'' #56.

The Ringer had an entry in two editions of the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]'', including issue #19 of the Deluxe Edition (December 1987), and issue #9 of the ''All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z'' (November 2006).

A second character named the Ringer was introduced in ''[[Moon Knight|Marc Spector: Moon Knight]]'' issue #10 (January 1990), and was created by writer [[Chuck Dixon]] and artist [[Sal Velluto]]. He first appeared during the ''[[Acts of Vengeance]]'' storyline. This Ringer also had appearances in: ''[[Hulk (comics)|Incredible Hulk]] Annual'' #17 (1991), ''Marvel: Year in Review '92'' (1992), ''[[Captain America]]'' #411-413 (January-March 1993), ''[[She-Hulk|Sensational She-Hulk]]'' #59 (January 1994), and ''[[The Punisher War Journal|Punisher War Journal]]'' #4 (April 2007). This Ringer also had an entry in the ''All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z'' issue #9, where his real name was revealed as Keith Kraftâ€”bearing the same surname as the creator of the original Ringer.

A version of the Ringer was introduced under the [[Ultimate Marvel]] imprint, in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' #91 (May 2006), and was created by writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and artist [[Mark Bagley]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Anthony Davis===

A former [[engineer]] for [[NASA]], criminal Anthony Davis grew jealous of the wealthy Kyle Richmond.  Designing a suit of battle armor that would be constructed by the [[Tinkerer]], Davis, calling himself the Ringer, broke into one of Richmond's buildings to rob it.  Richmond confronted the Ringer in his guise of [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Nighthawk]] II, breaking several of Davis's teeth in the process.  Davis was arrested and jailed, where it took a prison dentist several weeks to rebuild his broken teeth.<ref>''Defenders'' #51</ref>

Humiliated by his defeat at Nighthawk's hands, Davis decided he was not cut out for a life of crime. He had previously designed an improved version of his old battlesuit, which remained in the Tinkerer's warehouse, which he planned to rent out to various criminal contacts as part of a [[get-rich-quick scheme]]. As Davis tested the suit, [[MACH-IV (Marvel Comics)|the Beetle]] broke into the shop to retrieve his own equipment. Easily subduing the Ringer, the Beetle brought him back to his hideout, where he forced Davis to wear the suit to battle [[Spider-Man]], tricking him into thinking a new Ring the Beetle had added to the suit would explode if the Ringer did not obey.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #58</ref>

The Ringer, deathly afraid of battling another superhero, was dealt a humiliating defeat by Spider-Man, who broke his repaired dental work and left him webbed for the police. Upon his release from prison, the Ringer avoided New York City and its super heroes and operated as a costumed criminal primarily in the Midwest, sinking into petty crime and being viewed as a loser in the supervillain community. On a visit to the [[Bar With No Name]] in Medina County, Ohio, one of a number of similar secret meeting places for costumed criminals, the Ringer was contacted by Gary Gilbert, who was formerly the costumed terrorist called [[Firebrand (Marvel Comics)|Firebrand]]. Gilbert invited the Ringer to attend a meeting at the bar to discuss strategies for dealing with [[Scourge of the Underworld|Scourge]], the mysterious vigilante who had murdered a large number of costumed criminals. The Ringer came to the meeting, but, unfortunately for him, so did Scourge, disguised as the bartender. Scourge slaughtered the Ringer and all the other criminals who were present.<ref>''Captain America'' #319</ref>

[[Arnim Zola]] later created a proto-husk of him only for it to be killed by [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]].{{issue}}

Upon hearing of his supposed death, the Ringer's wife [[Leila Davis]] became a criminal herself, plotting to get revenge on the Beetle, who she blamed for her husband's humiliation, although she was thwarted by Spider-Man.<ref>''Deadly Foes of Spider-Man'' #1-4</ref> When she joined a group of other villains in attempting to kill the wall-crawler, she was saved during the battle by her husband, who appeared as the cyborg Strikeback. Davis revealed that he had not actually died in the Scourge's massacre, but was barely alive when [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|AIM]] agents investigated the murder, seeking information on the technology used by the dead criminals. AIM created a new cyborg body for him, and he worked for the organization for some time before striking out on his own. As Strikeback, Davis was a much more skilled fighter than he was as the Ringer, defeating [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]], [[Swarm (comics)|Swarm]], the [[Vulture (comics)|Vulture]] and [[Stegron]].<ref>''Lethal Foes of Spider-Man'' #1-4</ref> However, the dinosaur man badly damaged Strikeback's cybernetic systems during the battle, which caused them to slowly break down. During this time, he enjoyed a happy, if brief, retirement with Leila before dying. Leila herself would later perish in battle with the villain [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #56</ref>

===Keith Kraft===
The designs for the Ringer battlesuit is later used by another criminal named Keith Kraft who re-establishes the Ringer persona. He would prove to be as inept as Davis initially was. The Ringer teams up with [[Coachwhip (comics)|Coachwhip]] and [[Killer Shrike]] to attack [[Moon Knight]] during the ''Acts of Vengeance'', a plan to destroy superheros. He is defeated quickly.<ref>''Marc Spector: Moon Knight'' #10</ref> He is later employed by [[Justin Hammer]] and fights the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and the ancient society known as the [[Pantheon (Marvel Comics)|Pantheon]].<ref>''Incredible Hulk Annual'' #17</ref>

Kraft shows up at [[Stilt-Man]]'s funeral at the Bar with No Name where the [[Punisher]] poisoned the drinks and blew up the bar. Only medical attention prevents the Ringer and other villains from dying.<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' Vol. 2 #4</ref>

==Equipment==
The Ringer wore devices on his wrist that allowed him to condense rings with tensile strength approaching steel appearing out of the air to use as weapons. This fired a variety of rings, including explosive rings, freezing rings, and constriction rings. In later versions of his suit, he had a "particulate-matter condenser," which could form rings from soot in the air.

As Strikeback, Davis possessed the ability to levitate, fire powerful energy bursts from his wrists similar to [[Iron Man]]'s repulsor rays, and teleport himself and others. He was also a gifted mechanical engineer who designed his own equipment, although it was actually constructed by the Tinkerer.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Ringer===
* In ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' #91, the Ringer appeared, but ended up defeated by both Spider-Man and [[Shadowcat]]. He was handed over to the police, and hasn't been heard of since.
