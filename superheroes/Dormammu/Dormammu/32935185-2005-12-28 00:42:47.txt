'''Dormammu''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  He is a [[demon]] and a powerful [[sorcerer]] from the "Dark Dimension".  He frequently battles [[Doctor Strange]]. The character first appeared in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #126 (November 1964) and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]].
==Character biography==
Dormammu resembles a 6-foot [[humanoid]] with a flame-cloaked head.  His sister, [[Umar (Marvel Comics)|Umar]], is more human in appearance, though her head also bears a [[mantle]] of flames.  The siblings were once two of the Faltine, a race of extra-dimensional energy-based beings.  However, they became greedy, bonding matter to themselves to accumulate power.  

The other Faltine exiled the siblings to the Dark Dimension, where they accumulated power and eventually came to rule.  Doctor Strange and his lover and partner, Umar's daughter [[Clea]], have fought both of the Faltinians numerous times, deposing them on several occasions.  However, Dormammu and Umar continue to further their arcane schemes and menace both the Dark Dimension and the Earth.

==Powers and abilities==
Dormammu possesses vast magical and cosmic energies, which are supported and replenished by worship of him throughout the cosmos. His powers are so vast that he is capable of interdimensional travel, time travel, and teleportation over vast spaces (light years).

He is apparently indestructible, and his corporeal form has enhanced strength, reflexes, speed, and stamina. His corporeal form, while enhanced, is significantly weaker than that of a character like Spiderman. Dormammu is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant; highly trained in some type of fighting style he learned in his dimension.

Aside from his vast magical powers and enhanced body, Dormammu is incredibly intelligent, although he is not omniscient.

==Appearances in other media==
In ''[[Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'', Dormammu first appears in ''Sins of the Fathers Chapter I: [[Doctor Strange]]''. In the show, Dormammu is a demon from another dimension who must consume souls in order to sustain himself. In this episode, he orders his servant [[Baron Mordo| Mordo]] to steal the Wand of Watoomb to free him so he can enter this dimension and feed on our dimension's inhabitants' souls. He is stopped when Spider-Man, who is trying to save Mary Jane Watson, who has joined a cult started by Mordo and Dr. Strange, defeats Mordo and retrieves the wand.

He and Mordo appear again in the episodes ''Venom Returns'' and ''Carnage''. In these episodes, Mordo reunites Eddie Brock with his symbiote, releasing the threat of [[Venom (comics)|Venom]] once more. Mordo then orders him to retrieve a device from Stark Enterprises that can open portals from other dimensions, so that Mordo can bring Dormammu to this dimension. 

After seeing that [[Venom (comics)|Venom]]'s hatred of Spider-Man is preventing him from retrieving from the device, he orders Mordo to give the Symbiote's recently born offspring to madman [[Cletus Kasday]], creating the villain [[Carnage_(comics)|Carnage]].

After retrieving the device, Carnage is tasked with collecting life energy for Dormammu in order for him to get enough [[strength]] to enter our world, which he does. However, in the end Dormammu, Mordo, and Carnage are defeated by Spider-Man and Venom, and Spider-Man sucks Dormammu back to his dimension. Carnage is pulled into Dormammu's dimension along with Venom, and with the device destroyed (thanks to [[Iron Man ]], who makes a guest appearance in this episode), Dormammu is stopped from entering our world again.
