The character has also appeared in associated Marvel merchandise including [[animated]] [[television series]]; [[toy]]s; [[trading cards]] and [[video game]]s.

==Publication history==
=== Origin ===
Dormammu first appeared in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #126 - 127 (Nov. - Dec. 1964), but had in fact having already been mentioned, as was his realm the "Dark Dimension", in passing in the title. 

Writer [[Mike Conroy]] stated

{{cquote|To Lee and Steve Ditko, the Lord of the Realm of Darkness and the associated invocations were just another piece of business, another way of adding depth to the otherwordly nature of Strange's adventures. However, the readers were intrigued. They wanted to know more. "It seems there was something about that nutty name, Dormammu, that was keeping Doc's devoted disciples awake at nights trying to figure out who Dormammu was," Lee explained. "I knew I was in big trouble. I had made up the name - now I had to dream up a character to go with the name. But who? How?

Ditko visualized the answer. "He gave the demoniac DD...a visage totally different from any villain I had ever seen in comics before," proclaimed Lee.<ref>Conroy, Mike. ''500 Comicbook Villains'', Collins & Brown, 2004.</ref>}}

After being established as a [[warlord]] from a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate dimension]], Dormammu became a perennial foe of [[Sorcerer Supreme]] and maverick Dr. Strange, who until this time had dealt almost exclusively with off-beat "one-off" mystical threats in ''Strange Tales'' #110 - 125 (July 1963 - Oct. 1964). Strange's first encounter with Dormammu in the "Dark Dimension" also introduced [[Clea]] - eventually revealed to be the niece of the villain (like Clea's name, this was not initially revealed in ''Strange Tales'' #126 (Nov. 1964)) and the monstrous and imprisoned [[Mindless Ones]].

Notable appearances include starring in an epic fifteen issue storyline in ''Strange Tales'' #131 - 146 (April - 1965 - July 1966); the discovery that Dormammu has a sister, [[Umar (comics)|Umar]], and both are in fact mystical beings called ''Faltine'' in ''Strange Tales'' #150 (Nov. 1966); teaming with fellow villain [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]] to instigate the "Avengers-Defenders War" in ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #115 - 118 (Sep. - Dec. 1973) and ''[[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]'' #8 - 11 (Sep. - Dec. 1973); ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] '' Annual #9 (1981); ''Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme'' #1 - 2 (Nov. 1988 & Jan. 1989) and the [[limited series]] ''Doctor Strange: The Flight of the Bones'' #1 - 4 (Feb. - May 1999) and ''[[Patsy Walker|Hellcat]]'' #1 - 3 (Sep. - Nov. 2000). 

After a major appearance in ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #498 - 500 (Oct. - Dec. 2003), Dormammu became the patron of small-time villain the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] in ''[[New Avengers]]'' #46 (Dec. 2008).

==Powers and abilities==
Doctor Strange has referred to Dormammu as his "most terrible foe",<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #498 (Oct. 2003)</ref> and a threat to "the life of the universe itself", that "at full power no one could stand against".<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #499 (Nov. 2003)</ref> The character is composed of pure magic energy, and is capable of feats including energy projection; matter transmutation; size shifting; teleportation; body possession,<ref name="NA46">''New Avengers'' #46 (2008)</ref> resurrection of the dead,<ref>''Punisher'' vol.7, #2-7</ref> and bestowment of sufficient power to dwarf that of a [[Sorcerer Supreme]].<ref>''Strange Tales'' #132 (May 1966)</ref> Dormammu is also apparently stronger in the Dark Dimension, being empowered by the worship of his followers,<ref name="mindless ones">''Strange Tales'' #126 - 127 (Nov. - Dec. 1964)</ref> and can draw upon its power.<ref name="NA46"></ref>

Among other examples, the character has engaged, and in one case defeated, avatars of Eternity;<ref>''Strange Tales'' #131 - 146(Apr. - 1965 - July 1966); ''Defenders'' vol. 3, #3 </ref> created a demonic entity at the scale of [[Satannish]] as an extension of his own power;<ref name="hellcat"/> imprisoned or transformed the [[Elder Gods (Marvel Comics)|elder goddess]] [[Gaea (Marvel Comics)|Gaea]] against her will;<ref>''Doctor Strange'' vol. 2, #6 - 7 (Feb. & Apr. 1975); ''Doctor Strange'' vol.3, #2</ref> bested a [[Phoenix (Guardians of the Galaxy)|host]] to the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]];<ref name="Guardians">''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #34 - 36 (Mar. - May 1993)</ref> reached a draw against the Norse god king [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]] in an abstract chess match that controlled the universal balance of [[chaos]] and [[order]], hosted in the realm of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]];<ref name="Thor Annual #9"/> and through aid from the "[[Evil Eye of Avalon|Evil Eye]]" merged his dimension with the Earth of the mainstream Marvel Universe, and forced [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] to change into his mortal Donald Blake persona against Odin's enchantment.<ref name="Avengers/Defenders War"/> 

However, the character is frequently undone by his own impatience and arrogance, with the villain usually only defeated via trickery.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #500 (Dec. 2003)</ref><ref>''Doctor Voodoo'' #1 (2009)</ref> The character apparently has one significant weakness, being vulnerable in environments that cannot fuel his mystical "Faltine flames".<ref name="hellcat"/> 

Marvel's editorial department has produced various "Official Handbook" publications, wherein long, technobabble based explanation of the character's powers and equipment have been outlined. While this information was provided in an in-universe tone, it has not always been covered in-story, and is recurrently ignored or revised by writers as they feel the need. Within these, the character has been described as "one of the most powerful known mystical beings" in existence,<ref name="Handbook2">''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Deluxe Edition'' #4 (1985)</ref> with "virtually unlimited" ability to manipulate the forces of magic,<ref name="Handbook3">''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Master Edition'' (1991)</ref> and stated to possess "more raw power than even the most skilled sorcerer".<ref name="Handbook4">''All-New Official Handbook Of The Marvel Universe A To Z'' #3 (March, 2006)</ref>

==Other versions==
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] title ''[[Ultimatum]]'' introduces an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] version of the character who succeeds in killing Doctor Strange (actually the son of the original) during the limited series ''[[Ultimatum (comics)|Ultimatum]].<ref>''Ultimatum'' #1 (Dec. 2008); #2 (Jan. 2009); #3 - 4 (May 2009); #5 (Sep. 2009) </ref>
