'''Dormammu''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appeared in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #126 (November 1964) and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]].

== Fictional character biography ==
Dormammu is a 6-foot [[humanoid]] with a flame-cloaked head. His sister, [[Umar (Marvel Comics)|Umar]], is more human in appearance, though her head also bears a mantle of flames. The siblings were once two of the Faltine, a race of extra-dimensional energy-based beings. However, they became greedy, bonding matter to themselves to accumulate power. The other Faltine exiled the siblings to a [[List of Marvel Comics dimensions|dimension]] known as the Dark Dimension, where they accumulated power and eventually came to rule. Dormammu has been stated to be the grandfather of [[Daimon Hellstrom]]. It is revealed this was part of a plan to fool Daimon's love, in order to keep her away from his dangerous life. 

===Encounters with Dr. Strange and other Heroes===
Doctor Strange and his lover and partner, Umar's daughter [[Clea]], have fought both of the Faltinians numerous times, deposing them on several occasions. However, Dormammu and Umar continue to further their arcane schemes and menace both the Dark Dimension and the Earth.

Dormammu first encountered [[Doctor Strange]] many years ago,<ref>''Strange Tales'' #126</ref> and then battled him for the first time.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #127</ref> Dormammu allied himself with [[Baron Mordo]].<ref>''Strange Tales'' #130</ref> He summoned various lords of the netherworlds to witness a battle with Doctor Strange.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #140</ref> He then later encounters the cosmic entity [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]].<ref>''Strange Tales'' #146</ref>

Years later, Dormammu captured Clea and Victoria Bentley.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #171</ref> He became ruler of the Dykkors, and battled Strange again.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #172</ref> He then returned to the Dark Dimension.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #173</ref>

Dormammu later allied with [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], and instigated a war between the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].<ref>''Defenders'' #8</ref> He then used the power of the [[Evil Eye of Avalon|Evil Eye]] to invade Earth.<ref>''Defenders'' #10</ref> He betrayed Loki,<ref>''Avengers'' #116</ref> and battled the Avengers and Loki until he was absorbed by the Evil Eye.<ref>''Avengers'' #118</ref>

===Reincarnated===
Dormammu was eventually reincarnated at the Earth's core as a giant, and imprisoned [[Gaea (Marvel Comics)|Gaea]].<ref>''Doctor Strange'' Vol. 2 #7</ref> He then battled the [[Scarlet Witch]] to avenge his imprisonment in the Evil Eye, but lost.<ref>''Giant-Size Avengers'' #4</ref> His power was stolen by Umar, and he was expelled from the Earth.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' Vol. 2 #9</ref> He later traveled back in time to 1943.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' Vol. 2 #50</ref> He was driven out of the body of Viscount Krowler by Doctor Strange.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' Vol. 2 #51</ref>

Later, Dormammu took possession of Doctor Strange's body.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' Vol. 3 #1</ref> He was driven from Strange's body by [[Topaz (Marvel Comics)|Topaz]].<ref>''Doctor Strange'' Vol. 3 #2</ref> He later began a way to regain sovereignty over the Dark Dimension from Clea,<ref>''Doctor Strange'' Vol. 3 #21</ref> and even invaded Earth.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' Vol. 3 #23</ref>

During a battle in [[Times Square]], [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] creates a device to evict the [[Mindless Ones]] back to their home realm by channeling the energies of all the heroes present. This served to recreate Dormammu, whose energies had been scattered, forcing Doctor Strange to try and trick Dormammu into expending his energy before he was back to full power, thus tearing them both apart across the dimensions. However, thanks to the intervention of [[Spider-Man]], the two heroes were transferred outside of [[time]] itself, giving Strange the opportunity to send Spider-Man a few moments into the past and prevent Dormammu from ever being released in the first place <ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #500</ref>

===Secret Invasion===
It is revealed that Dormammu is the demon behind the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s powers after Hood killed the [[Skrull]] that was posing as [[Slug (comics)|Slug]].<ref>New Avengers #46</ref>

===X-Infernus===
While in [[Otherplace|Limbo]], the recently resurrected [[Illyana Rasputin]] attacks various other demons looking for her soulsword and the original bloodstone amulet. This does not go unnoticed by [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], [[Blackheart]], [[Satannish]], [[Dormammu]] and [[Hela (comics)|Hela]].<ref>''X-Infernus'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Dormammu is composed of pure mystic energy, eclipsing even the greatest of sorcerers in terms of raw power and the ability to manipulate the forces of magic, including [[Doctor Strange]], which is increased and replenished by worship throughout various dimensions. Among many examples, he is capable of matter transmutations, [[List of Marvel Comics dimensions|interdimensional]] [[teleportation]], size transformations, time travel, creating artificial beings, vastly powerful magic blasts, changing his appearance, or empowering others. He can draw upon the power of the entire Dark Dimension, but is somewhat more limited when present in another universe.  He has been shown as more powerful than [[Satannish]] and [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], and apparently served as the creator of the former.<ref>''Hellcat'' #3</ref> As a representative of Lord Chaos, Dormammu also held the upper hand in a formal game of cosmic chess against [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]], who was representing Master Order, but it ultimately ended in a draw as Odin wished.<ref>''Thor Annual'' #9</ref> He has even dared to directly challenge a [[Cosmic entities (Marvel Comics)#Overview|manifestation body]] of [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]] itself, and in one case even overcame it.<ref>''Defenders'' vol.3, #3</ref> However, there are still limits to his might. For example, the demon known as [[Zom]] has been referred to as far more powerful than his sister [[Umar (Marvel Comics)|Umar]], and thus presumably than himself, if not by quite as much.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #156</ref>

Dormammu is virtually indestructible, and has strength, speed, and stamina, which he can directly empower to levels shown capable of challenging a slightly angered [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]],<ref>''Defenders'' vol.3, #2</ref> or by growing to gigantic size. Dormammu is a capable hand-to-hand combatant, trained in an extra-dimensional fighting style, but was once bested by the human Doctor Strange when neither was using mystic powers. His chief resources are his tremendous magical powers and considerable intellect.
