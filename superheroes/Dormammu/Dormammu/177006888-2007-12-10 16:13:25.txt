'''Dormammu''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]], in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He is an extra-dimensional mystic entity from another dimension who serves as the archenemy of [[Doctor Strange]]. The character first appeared in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #126 (November 1964) and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]].

== Fictional character biography ==
Dormammu is a 6-foot [[humanoid]] with a flame-cloaked head. His sister, [[Umar (Marvel Comics)|Umar]], is more human in appearance, though her head also bears a mantle of flames. The siblings were once two of the Faltine, a race of extra-dimensional energy-based beings. However, they became greedy, bonding matter to themselves to accumulate power. The other Faltine exiled the siblings to a [[List of Marvel Comics dimensions|dimension]] known as the Dark Dimension, where they accumulated power and eventually came to rule. Dormammu has been stated to be the grandfather of [[Hellstorm| Daimon Hellstrom]]. It is revealed this was part of a plan to fool Damion's love, in order to keep her away from his dangerous life. 

Doctor Strange and his lover and partner, Umar's daughter [[Clea]], have fought both of the Faltinians numerous times, deposing them on several occasions. However, Dormammu and Umar continue to further their arcane schemes and menace both the Dark Dimension and the Earth. During a battle in [[Times Square]], [[Reed Richards]] creates a device to evict the [[Mindless Ones]] back to their home realm by channelling the energies of all the heroes present. This served to recreate Dormammu, whose energies had been scattered, forcing Doctor Strange to try and trick Dormammu into expending his energy before he was back to full power, thus tearing them both apart across the dimensions. However, thanks to the intervention of [[Spider-Man]], the two heroes were transferred outside of Time itself, giving Strange the opportunity to send Spider-Man a few moments into the past and prevent Dormammu from ever being released in the first place <ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #500</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Dormammu is composed of pure mystic energy, eclipsing even the greatest of sorcerers in terms of raw power, including [[Doctor Strange]], which is increased and replenished by worship throughout various dimensions. Among many examples, he is capable of matter transmutations, [[interdimensional]] or time travel, creating artificial beings, vastly powerful magic blasts, changing his appearance, or empowering others. He can draw upon the power of the entire Dark Dimension, but is somewhat more limited when present in another universe.  He has been shown as more powerful than [[Satannish]] and [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], and apparently served as the creator of the former.<ref>''Hellcat'' #3</ref> As a representative of Lord Chaos, Dormammu also held the upper hand in a formal game of cosmic chess against [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]], who was representing Master Order, but it ultimately ended in a draw as Odin wished.<ref>''Thor Annual'' #9</ref> He has even dared to directly challenge a [[Cosmic entities (Marvel Comics)#Overview|manifestation body]] of [[Eternity (Marvel Comics)|Eternity]] itself, and in one case even overcame it.<ref>''Defenders'' vol.3, #3</ref> However, there are still limits to his might. For example, the demon known as [[Zom]] has been referred as far more powerful than his sister [[Umar]], and thus presumably than himself, if not by quite as much.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #156</ref>

Dormammu is virtually indestructible, and has enhanced strength, speed and stamina, which he can directly empower to levels shown capable of challenging a slightly angered [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]],<ref>''Defenders'' vol.3, #2</ref> or by growing to gigantic size. Dormammu is a capable hand-to-hand combatant, trained in an extradimensional fighting style, but was once bested by the human Doctor Strange when neither was using mystic powers. His chief resources are his tremendous magical powers and considerable intellect.

==Parodies and references==
* Dormammu was [[parody|parodied]] in the comic ''[[Nextwave|Nextwave: Agents of H.A.T.E.]]''. A fellow Faltine named 'Rorkannu', appears as the ruler of the 'Dank/Dim Dimension', who trades the services of his henchmen, [[Mindless Ones|The Mindless Ones]], for the [[Suicide Girls]] and one hundred dollars.

* [[The Venture Bros.]] included a character, Torrid, in the episode ''[[Fallen Arches]]''. [[Dr. Orpheus]], himself a parody of [[Dr. Strange]], interviewed Torrid to be his arch-nemesis. Torrid was given the job after kidnapping Orpheus' daughter Triana and hiding her in the Torrid Zone, which was actually a tropical zone, where Orpheus himself owned an island.

* Dormammu was also parodied in the Spanish comic ''[[Fanhunter]]'' as Muermammu (as in  [[slang]] "muermo": tediousness), one of the lords of the Dark Side of the Pichurrina. He arrived to Barnacity, took rulership from the hands of the current dictator, Pope Alejo I, and put the whole city to sleep in an attempt to gather power from their boredom.

* More seriously, the Staff of One in the series ''[[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]]'' is described as capable of making Dormammu tremble.

He also appeared in ''[[Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'', (voiced by [[Ed Gilbert (actor)|Ed Gilbert]]) in which debuts in ''Sins of the Fathers Chapter I: [[Doctor Strange (Spider-Man: Animated Series)|Doctor Strange]]''.  In the show, Dormammu is a demon from another dimension who must consume life-force <!-- not souls, in the context of the show  -->in order to sustain himself. In this episode, he orders [[Baron Mordo|Mordo]] to steal the [[Wand of Watoomb]] to free him so he can enter this dimension and feed on the life-force of [[New York]]ers. Dormammu is stopped by the combined efforts of Spider-Man and [[Dr. Strange]]. Dormammu and Mordo appear again in the episodes "[[Venom Returns]]" and "[[Carnage (Spider-Man: The Animated Series)|Carnage]]". In these episodes, Mordo reunites Eddie Brock with his symbiote, releasing the threat of [[Venom (Eddie Brock)|Venom]] once more. Mordo then orders him to retrieve a device from Stark Enterprises that can open portals from other dimensions, so that Mordo can bring Dormammu to this dimension. After seeing that Venom's hatred of Spider-Man is preventing him from retrieving from the device, he orders Mordo to give the [[symbiote (comics)|symbiote's]] recently born offspring to madman [[Carnage (comics)|Cletus Kasady]], which creates the composite villain Carnage. After retrieving the device, Carnage is tasked with collecting life energy for Dormammu in order for him to get enough strength to enter our world, which he does. However, in the end Dormammu, Mordo, and Carnage are defeated by Spider-Man and Venom, and Spider-Man sucks Dormammu back to his dimension. Carnage is pulled into Dormammu's dimension along with Venom, and with the device destroyed (thanks to [[Iron Man]], who makes a guest appearance in this episode), Dormammu is stopped from entering our world again.
