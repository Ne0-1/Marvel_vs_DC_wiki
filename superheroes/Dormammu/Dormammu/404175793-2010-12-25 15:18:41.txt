Debuting in the [[Silver Age of comic books]], Dormammu has appeared in over four decades of Marvel publications, featuring prominently in the [[Doctor Strange]] titles and limited series as the recurring [[Archenemy|nemesis]] of the [[mysticism|mystic]] hero. The character has also appeared in associated Marvel merchandise including [[animated]] [[television series]]; [[toy]]s; [[trading cards]] and [[video game]]s.

==Publication history==
=== Origin ===
Dormammu first appeared in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #126 - 127 (Nov. - Dec. 1964), but had in fact having already been mentioned, as was his realm the "Dark Dimension", in passing in the title. 

Writer [[Mike Conroy (writer)|Mike Conroy]] stated

{{cquote|To Lee and Steve Ditko, the Lord of the Realm of Darkness and the associated invocations were just another piece of business, another way of adding depth to the otherwordly nature of Strange's adventures. However, the readers were intrigued. They wanted to know more. "It seems there was something about that nutty name, Dormammu, that was keeping Doc's devoted disciples awake at nights trying to figure out who Dormammu was," Lee explained. "I knew I was in big trouble. I had made up the name - now I had to dream up a character to go with the name. But who? How?

Ditko visualized the answer. "He gave the demoniac DD...a visage totally different from any villain I had ever seen in comics before," proclaimed Lee.<ref>Conroy, Mike. ''500 Comicbook Villains'', Collins & Brown, 2004.</ref>}}

After being established as the ruler of an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate dimension]] (later described as the god-tyrant of its denizens),<ref>''Excalibur'' v.3, #14 (2005)</ref> Dormammu became a perennial foe of [[Sorcerer Supreme]] and maverick Doctor Strange, who until this time had dealt almost exclusively with off-beat "one-off" mystical threats in ''Strange Tales'' #110 - 125 (July 1963 - Oct. 1964). Strange's first encounter with Dormammu in the "Dark Dimension" also introduced [[Clea]] - eventually revealed to be the niece of the villain (like Clea's name, this was not initially revealed in ''Strange Tales'' #126 (Nov. 1964)) and the monstrous and imprisoned [[Mindless Ones]].

Major appearances include starring in an epic fifteen issue storyline in ''Strange Tales'' #131 - 146 (April - 1965 - July 1966); the discovery that Dormammu has a sister, [[Umar (comics)|Umar]], and both are in fact mystical beings called ''Faltine'' in ''Strange Tales'' #150 (Nov. 1966); teaming with fellow villain [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] to instigate the "Avengers-Defenders War" in ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #115 - 118 (Sep. - Dec. 1973) and ''[[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]'' #8 - 11 (Sep. - Dec. 1973); ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] '' Annual #9 (1981); ''Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme'' #1 - 2 (Nov. 1988 & Jan. 1989) and the [[limited series]] ''Doctor Strange: The Flight of the Bones'' #1 - 4 (Feb. - May 1999) and ''[[Patsy Walker|Hellcat]]'' #1 - 3 (Sep. - Nov. 2000). 

After a major appearance in ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #498 - 500 (Oct. - Dec. 2003), Dormammu became the patron of small-time villain the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] in ''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' #46 (Dec. 2008).

== Fictional character biography ==
=== 1960's ===
Dormammu is first mentioned by [[Baron Mordo|Karl Amadeus Mordo]], senior apprentice of the appointed "[[Sorcerer Supreme]]" the "[[Ancient One]]", who, in the entity's service, attempts to slowly weaken the sorcerer, but is stopped when his fellow pupil [[Doctor Strange|Stephen Strange]] manages to alert his master to the betrayal.<ref>{{Cite comic

The character later appears in person when sending a messenger to boast his renewed intentions of conquering his universe before his aging adversary. In response, Doctor Strange travels to Dormammu's "Dark Dimension", and manages to overcome all supernatural servitors sent against him. Dormammu engages Strange in mystic combat, but, when drawing upon the realms energies, inadvertently weakens the barrier containing the horde of [[Mindless Ones]]. Since they threatened Dormammu's subjects, Strange helped his enemy to re-seal the juggernauts. Indebted to Strange for his help, Dormammu ends the fight, and in return Strange demands a binding vow to never enter the "Earth realm" again. Dormammu complies, but gains a burning hatred against Strange for the humiliation.<ref>{{Cite comic

Dormammu uses a loophole to his oath by granting Mordo vast power, whereupon the sorcerer leads his minions on a lengthy hunt for Strange, and abduct the Ancient One as a bargaining chip. Dormammu's niece, [[Clea]], assists Strange by weakening the barrier of the Mindless Ones, forcing her uncle to focus elsewhere. Dormammu learns of her betrayal, brings all three Earth sorcerers to a neutral realm, to let her see his disciple destroy Strange, and summons fellow "Lords of the Netherworlds" to watch the spectacle. When Strange begins to get an advantage against Mordo, Dormammu decides to face the sorcerer in a contest of pure hand-to-hand-combat. The physically stronger entity eventually falls to his foe's greater familiarity with [[martial arts]]. To Dormammu's humiliation, before the gathered Lords, Strange forces him to vow not to menace the Earth even by proxy. The villain strikes a parting blow by banishing Clea, and inciting another lord to attack Strange.<ref name="Martial arts fight">{{Cite comic

When Loki escapes and distracts Dormammu, the Avenger casts a [[hex]] on the Eye that causes it to absorb Dormammu into itself, which costs Loki his sanity as a side-effect.<ref name="Avengers/Defenders War">"Avengers/Defenders War" from:

However, Umar and sometimes-pawn Baron Mordo eventually decide to join forces with Clea and Doctor Strange. The enraged Dormammu threatens to completely destroy the "Dark Dimension" in retaliation, but Umar convinces him to accept a compromise as the ruler of a sub-realm, whereas his sister takes over rulership from Clea, with Mordo as her consort. Clea accepts to abdicate as a better temporary solution than seeing all of her people killed, but promises to return if Umar becomes a tyrant again. Dormammu finds that he has been tricked into being trapped as the ruler of the realm of the Mindless Ones.

Strange, at the time weakened without support from the "[[Principality (comics)|Principalities]]", confronts Dormammu alongside his allies Clea, the [[Silver Surfer]], [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], and the modern [[Ghost Rider]], but they are unable to cause any damage to the villain, who is extatic with his victory and overwhelming power. Strange journeys into the core of Dormammu's essence and uses the [[Eye of Agamotto]] to strip away his self-delusion, and make him acknowledge that his thirst for chaos, power, and conquest are unworthy for a being of his stature, as a desperate gamble to make him see reason. Dormammu is momentarily shaken, and appears to be defeated, but it is shown to be a mirage. The villain gloats that he has not shown "one tenth" of his true power against the heroes, but that he now realizes that rulership of "one puny" universe is beneath his notice, as he now has far greater and "more interesting" ambitions, and contemptuously dismisses the "insignificant mortals".<ref name="SecretDefenders">{{Cite comic

Dormammu has been described as "something worse than a demon".<ref  name="Hood"/> It is unknown exactly how ancient he is, as he inhabits a wholly alien, conventional laws of physics-defying, realm separate from the regular [[Marvel Universe]], and certain similar beings, such as the [[Dweller-in-Darkness]] are known to predate it. He is known to well precede the creation of the current demonic netherworlds;<ref name="hellcat"/> to have clashed with [[Agamotto]] hundreds of millions of years ago, to have served as the primary enemy of the [[Vishanti]] ever since, and to have been considered an extreme threat by the mages of "[[Kull of Atlantis|pre-cataclysm]]" [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlantis]].<ref name="Marvel Zombies"/>

Dormammu is presented as the most powerful and malevolent of "the Faltine",<ref name="SecretDefenders"/> fictional [[n-dimensional space|higher-dimensional]] mystical energy beings. Not native to the "Dark Dimension", Dormammu and "his" sibling Umar were exiled for slaying their progenitor "Sinifer" (and what was considered a morbid/unclean obsession with physical matter), whereupon they journeyed there in search of experience, and assumed corporeal forms.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' vol.3, #22 (October 1990)</ref>  Dormammu merged with the local "Flames of Regency" to further enhance his power, and returned to an energy state, whereas Umar had grown accustomed to physical pleasure.  After imprisoning the horde of marauding virtually unstoppable [[Mindless Ones]] behind a barrier Dormammu enslaved the entire realm to be worshipped as its sole deity, and continued to gradually merge other mystical universes to his own, while spreading his worship to any sorcerers throughout the multiverse who invoked his powers.<ref>''Dr. Strange'' vol.2 #72</ref>

Already being a "dimension lord", the absolute god-[[tyrant]] of his own universe, Dormammu's current displayed goals are to slaughter any opposing [[Cosmic entity (Marvel Comics)|conceptual forces]], assume control of all life and afterlife, and rewrite the laws of nature to turn both states of existence into a neverending [[Nazism]]-reminiscent torture-camp for every sentient being within them, with himself as their glorified deity.<ref name="Celestials"/><ref name="hellcat"/><ref name="DeMatteis&Giffen"/> What makes him different from other prominent Marvel supervillains with similar aims, is that he is shown as fully capable of personally defeating cosmic entities even without external power sources.<ref name="GotG"/><ref name="DeMatteis&Giffen"/>

The character is sometimes shown as incredibly patient, with certain plots to achieve his goals spanning billions of years,<ref name="hellcat"/> whereas others are planned far more recently or even improvised through opportunity.<ref name="SecretDefenders"/> However, although extremely intelligent, with tremendous knowledge of the mystic arts, he is overwhelmingly arrogant, generally does not adapt well to sudden confusion and unexpected developments,<ref name="GotG"/> and has a tendency to indulge, and brag to, technically outmatched foes rather than swiftly finish them off.<ref name="Martial arts fight"/><ref name="Avengers/Defenders War"/><ref name="SecretDefenders"/><ref name="DoctorVoodoo">''Doctor Voodoo: Avenger of the Supernatural'' #1 (2010)</ref>  He and his sister (originally genderless siblings) Umar have an unpredictable love-hate relationship. Sometimes being loyal and collaborating, and other times gladly betraying and taking the other's power for themselves.<ref name="SecretDefenders"/><ref name="DeMatteis&Giffen"/> Umar has an occasional tendency to sarcastically puncture her brother's obsessive histrionics with more pragmatic sadistic hedonism.<ref name="DeMatteis&Giffen"/> 

Writer [[Keith Giffen]] has described them as "''Donnie and Marie from hell. The brother-sister sibling rivalry relationship blown up to nightmarish, universe-shattering proportions.''" Whereas Dormammu himself is "''completely inhuman''",<ref>[http://www.google.se/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CBUQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fforum.newsarama.com%2Fshowthread.php%3Ft%3D37585&ei=qn9VTK3xDMyHOPzF5Z4O&usg=AFQjCNHIa5wG6sc334PSlXt5Nrm5a6y4Tg GIFFEN & DEMATTEIS TALK DEFENDERS AND A LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING]</ref> the kind of character that "''commits mass murder... on a whim''".<ref>[http://www.google.se/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CBUQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.comixfan.com%2Fxfan%2Fforums%2Fshowthread.php%3Ft%3D34406&ei=MoJVTJ3sMJSNOKrcxJ4O&usg=AFQjCNGmOm9xurkmqYrtTAJHbl9xuMYBsw DEFENDING DRAX WITH KEITH GIFFEN]</ref>

===Marvel Mangaverse===

==In other media==
===Television===
* Dormammu appears in the 1979 ''[[Spider-Woman (TV series)|Spider-Woman]]'' episode "Realm of Darkness." This version bears little relation to his comic book look instead bearing more than a passing resemblance to the Green Goblin. He is summoned to Earth by worshippers from Grand Cayman Island. He plans to stop the Earth in its orbit when the eclipse occurs so that he can engulf the Earth into complete darkness.

* Dormammu appears in the 1990s ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' series' episodes "Doctor Strange," "Venom Returns," and "Carnage" voiced by [[Ed Gilbert]]. 

* Dormammu appears in ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]'' episode "Enter: Dormammu" voiced by [[Robert Englund]]. Doctor Strange (whose Eye of Agamotto is holding an Infinity Sword fractal) ends up unleashing Dormammu from his Dark Dimension into Super Hero City. A recurring gag during this episode was Falcon asking Dormammu if he knows that his head is on fire. When Dormammu unleashes his Mindless Ones upon Super Hero City, Dormammu manages to steal the fractals from the Vault and Villainville while taking Captain America and Doctor Doom hostage. When the fractal is extracted from the Eye of Agamotto, Doctor Strange then uses a spell to banish Dormammu back into the Dark Dimension. In "This Al Dente Earth," Doctor Strange briefly pulls Dormammu's head out of the Dark Dimension in order to damage Galactus' machine.

===Film===
* Dormammu is the main antagonist in the 2007 animated [[Direct-to-video|Direct-To-DVD]] film ''[[Doctor Strange: The Sorcerer Supreme]]'' voiced by [[Jonathan Adams (American actor)|Jonathan Adams]].

===Video games===
* Dormammu appears as a playable character in ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds]]''.<ref>[http://www.capcom-unity.com/jgonzo/blog/2010/08/17/gamescom_2010:_marvel_vs._capcom_3_-_introducing_dormammu__viewtiful_joe Introducing Dormammu & Viewtiful Joe]</ref>
