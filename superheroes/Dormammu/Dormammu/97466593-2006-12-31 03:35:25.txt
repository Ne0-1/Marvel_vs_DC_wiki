'''Dormammu''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He is a [[Demons (Marvel Comics)|demonic entity]] and a powerful [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcerer]] from the "Dark Dimension".  He frequently battles [[Doctor Strange]]. The character first appeared in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #126 (November 1964) and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]].

== Character biography ==

Dormammu is a 6-foot [[humanoid]] with a flame-cloaked head. His sister, [[Umar (Marvel Comics)|Umar]], is more human in appearance, though her head also bears a [[mantle]] of flames. The siblings were once two of the Faltine, a race of extra-dimensional energy-based beings. However, they became greedy, bonding matter to themselves to accumulate power.

The other Faltine exiled the siblings to the Dark Dimension, where they accumulated power and eventually came to rule. Doctor Strange and his lover and partner, Umar's daughter [[Clea]], have fought both of the Faltinians numerous times, deposing them on several occasions. However, Dormammu and Umar continue to further their arcane schemes and menace both the Dark Dimension and the Earth.

==Powers and abilities==
[[Image:Strange003.jpgâ€Ž|thumb|left|250px|Dormammu battling [[Doctor Strange]].]]
Dormammu possesses vast magical and cosmic energies, which are supported and replenished by worship of him throughout the cosmos. His powers are so vast that he is capable of [[interdimensional]] travel, time travel, and [[teleportation]] over vast stretches of space and time.

Dormammu is apparently indestructible, and commands enhanced strength, reflexes, speed, and stamina. His [[corporeal]] form, while enhanced, is significantly weaker than that of an average super-hero, like [[Captain America]]. Dormammu is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant; he is highly trained in a type of extradimensional fighting style. However, Dormammu is no physical match for someone such as [[Spider-Man]]; Dormammu's chief strengths are his vast magical powers and his incredible intellect.

==Parodies and references==
* Dormammu was [[parody|parodied]] in the comic ''[[Nextwave|Nextwave: Agents of H.A.T.E.]]''. He appears as 'Rorkannu', the ruler of the 'Dank/Dim Dimension', who trades the services of his henchmen, [[Mindless Ones|The Mindless Ones]], for the [[Suicide Girls]] and one hundred dollars.

* Dormammu was also parodied in the Spanish comic ''[[Fanhunter]]'' as Muermammu, one of the lords of the Dark Side of the Pichurrina. He arrived to [Barnacity], took rulership from the hands of the current dictator, Pope Alejo I, and put the whole city to sleep in an attempt to gather power from their boredom.

* More seriously, the Staff of One in the series ''[[Runaways]]'' is described as capable of making Dormammu tremble.

==Appearances in other media==
===Television===
*In ''[[Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'', Dormammu first appears in ''Sins of the Fathers Chapter I: [[Doctor Strange]]''. In the show, Dormammu is a demon from another dimension who must consume souls in order to sustain himself. In this episode, he orders [[Baron Mordo|Mordo]] to steal the [[Wand of Watoomb]] to free him so he can enter this dimension and feed on the souls of [[New York|New Yorkers]]. Dormammu is stopped by the combined efforts of Spider-Man and Dr. Strange. 

*Dormammu and Mordo appear again in the episodes'' [[Venom Returns]]'' and ''Carnage''. In these episodes, Mordo reunites Eddie Brock with his symbiote, releasing the threat of [[Venom (comics)|Venom]] once more. Mordo then orders him to retrieve a device from Stark Enterprises that can open portals from other dimensions, so that Mordo can bring Dormammu to this dimension. After seeing that Venom's hatred of Spider-Man is preventing him from retrieving from the device, he orders Mordo to give the [[symbiote (comics)|symbiote's]] recently born offspring to madman [[Carnage (comics)|Cletus Kasady]], which creates the composite villain Carnage. After retrieving the device, Carnage is tasked with collecting life energy for Dormammu in order for him to get enough strength to enter our world, which he does. However, in the end Dormammu, Mordo, and Carnage are defeated by Spider-Man and Venom, and Spider-Man sucks Dormammu back to his dimension. Carnage is pulled into Dormammu's dimension along with Venom, and with the device destroyed (thanks to [[Iron Man]], who makes a guest appearance in this episode), Dormammu is stopped from entering our world again.
