The '''Flash''' is a [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. Created by writer [[Gardner Fox]] and artist [[Harry Lampert]], the original Flash first appeared in ''[[Flash Comics]]'' #1 (January 1940).<ref name="dc-ency">{{Cite book | last = Jimenez | first = Phil | author-link = Phil Jimenez | contribution = The Flash | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 124–127  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017 | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref>

Nicknamed the "Scarlet Speedster", the "Crimson Comet", "The Blur", and "The Streak", all incarnations of the Flash possess "[[List of comic book superpowers#Superhuman speed|super speed]]", which includes the ability to run and move extremely fast, use [[List of comic book superpowers#Superhuman reflexes|superhuman reflexes]], and seemingly violate certain [[Physical law|laws of physics]]. Thus far, four different [[Character (arts)|characters]]—each of whom somehow gained the power of "super-speed"—have assumed the identity of the Flash: [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]] (1940–present), [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] (1956–1985, 2008–present), [[Wally West]] (1986–2006, 2007–2012, 2013–present), and [[Bart Allen]] (2006–2007). Before Wally and Bart's ascension to the mantle of the Flash, they were both Flash protégés under the same name [[Kid Flash]] (Bart was also known as [[Impulse (DC Comics)|Impulse]]).

The second incarnation of the Flash, [[Flash (Barry Allen)]], is part of the [[Silver Age of comic books]].
Each version of the Flash has been a key member of at least one of DC's premier teams: the [[Justice Society of America]], the [[Justice League]], and the [[Teen Titans]].

The Barry Allen version of the character (with Wally West elements) was featured in a live action television series, simply titled ''[[The Flash (1990 TV series)|The Flash]]'', in 1990, starring [[John Wesley Shipp]]. The Wally West version of the Flash (but with many elements of Barry Allen's story) is featured in the [[animation|animated series]] ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]''. All four incarnations of the character have appeared in the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' animated series, with the Wally West version of Kid Flash as a main character in the first season.

A new television series, also simply titled ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', starring [[Grant Gustin]] in the title role premiered on the [[The CW Television Network|CW]] on October 7, 2014. This new program features a younger Barry Allen with numerous elements of the earlier show as well as using many characters from the larger DC Universe.<ref name="premiere"> The show also features Shipp as Barry Allen's father Henry, who was accused of killing his wife, Barry's mother Nora, and is currently serving a life sentence in prison (despite the fact that Nora was killed by Eobard Thawne aka the Reverse Flash.  In addition to Shipp the new series also features [[Amanda Pays]] in a recurring role as Christina (Tina) McGee (CEO of Mercury Labs), the same character she played in the earlier version.  [[Mark Hammil]] also reprises his role as archvillan "The Trickster" with the same Trickster theme music from the original series.

== Publication history ==

=== Golden Age ===
The Flash [[First appearance|first appeared]] in the [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden Age]] ''Flash Comics'' #1 (Jan. 1940), from [[All-American Publications]], one of three companies that would eventually merge to form [[DC Comics]]. Created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Harry Lampert, this Flash was Jay Garrick, a college student who gained his speed through the inhalation of [[hard water]] vapors. When re-introduced in the 1960s Garrick's origin was modified slightly, gaining his powers through exposure to [[heavy water]].

Jay Garrick was a popular character in the 1940s, supporting both ''Flash Comics'' and ''[[All-Flash|All-Flash Quarterly]]'' (later published bi-monthly as simply ''All-Flash''); co-starring in ''[[Comic Cavalcade]]''; and being a charter member of the [[Justice Society of America]], the first superhero team, whose adventures ran in ''[[All Star Comics]]''. With superheroes' post-war decline in popularity, ''Flash Comics'' was canceled with issue #104 (1949) which featured an Evil version of the Flash called the Rival. The Justice Society's final Golden Age story ran in ''All Star Comics'' #57 (1951; the title itself continued, as ''All Star Western'').

=== Silver Age ===
In 1956, DC Comics successfully revived superheroes, ushering in what became known as the [[Silver Age of comic books]]. Rather than bringing back the same Golden Age heroes, DC rethought them as new characters for the modern age. The Flash was the first revival, in the aptly named tryout comic book ''[[Showcase (comic book)|Showcase]]'' #4 (Oct. 1956).

This new Flash was '''[[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]]''', a police scientist who gained super-speed when bathed by chemicals after a shelf of them was struck by lightning. He adopted the name ''The Flash'' after reading a comic book featuring the Golden Age Flash.<ref name="dc-ency"/>  After several more appearances in ''Showcase'', Allen's character was given his own title, ''The Flash'', the first issue of which was #105 (resuming where ''Flash Comics'' had left off). Barry Allen and the new Flash were created by writers Robert Kanigher and John Broome and cartoonist Carmine Infantino.

The Silver Age Flash proved popular enough that several other Golden Age heroes were revived in new incarnations (see: [[Green Lantern]]). A new superhero team, the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]], was also created, with the Flash as a main, charter member.

Barry Allen's title also introduced a much-imitated plot device into superhero comics when it was revealed that Garrick and Allen existed on fictional [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel world]]s. Their powers allowed them to cross the dimensional boundary between worlds, and the men became good friends. ''[[Flash of Two Worlds]]'' (''The Flash'' (vol. 1) #123) was the first crossover in which a Golden Age character met a Silver Age character. Soon, there were crossovers between the entire Justice League and the Justice Society; their respective teams began an annual get-together which endured from the early 1960s until the mid-1980s.

Allen's adventures continued in his own title until the advent of ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''. ''The Flash'' ended as a series with issue #350. Allen's life had become considerably confused in the early 1980s, and DC elected to end his adventures and pass the mantle on to another character. Allen died heroically in ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' #8 (1985). Thanks to his ability to travel through time, he would continue to appear occasionally in the years to come.

=== Modern Age ===

The third Flash was '''[[Wally West]]''', introduced in ''The Flash'' (vol. 1) #110 (Dec. 1959) as '''[[Kid Flash]]'''. West, Allen's nephew by marriage, gained the Flash's powers through an accident identical to Allen's. Adopting the identity of Kid Flash, he maintained membership in the [[Teen Titans]] for years. Following Allen's death, West adopted the Flash identity in ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' #12 and was given his own series, beginning with ''The Flash'' (vol. 2) #1 in 1987.<ref name="dc-ency"/>  Many issues began with the [[catchphrase]]: "My name is Wally West. I'm the fastest man alive."

Due to the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' miniseries and the "[[One Year Later]]" jump in time in the [[DC Universe]], DC canceled ''The Flash'' (vol. 2) in January 2006 at #230. A new series, ''The Flash: The Fastest Man Alive'', began on June 21, 2006. The initial story arc of this series, written by [[Danny Bilson]] and [[Paul De Meo]] with art by Ken Lashley, focused on '''Bart Allen'''{{'}}s acceptance of the role of the Flash.

''Flash: Fastest Man Alive'' was canceled with issue #13. In its place ''The Flash'' (vol. 2) was revived with issue #231, with [[Andrew Ablog]] as the initial writer. Waid also wrote ''All-Flash'' #1, which acted as the bridge between the two series.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.newsarama.com/heroes_philly07/DC/flash.html| title = Mark Waid Returns to ''The Flash''| accessdate = 2007-07-15| last = Rogers| first = Vaneta |date=2007-07-15| publisher = Newsarama |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070702073031/http://www.newsarama.com/heroes_philly07/DC/flash.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-07-02}}</ref>  DC had solicited ''Flash: Fastest Man Alive'' through issue #15. ''All Flash'' #1 replaced issue #14 and ''The Flash'' (vol. 2) #231 replaced issue #15 in title and interior creative team only. The covers and cover artists were as solicited by DC, and the information text released was devoid of any plot information.<ref>{{cite journal |date=May 2007 | title = DC Universe | journal = Previews | volume = 17 | issue = 5 | page = 82 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |date=June 2007 | title = DC Universe | journal = Previews | volume = 17 | issue = 6 | page = 86}}</ref>

In [[2009 in comics|2009]], Barry Allen made a full-fledged return to the DCU-proper in ''[[The Flash: Rebirth]]'', a six-issue miniseries by [[Geoff Johns]] and [[Ethan Van Sciver]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicsbulletin.com/news/121695829519539.htm |title=SDCC News: Johns and Van Sciver Announce Flash Rebirth: News Bulletins |publisher=Comics Bulletin |date=2008-07-24 |accessdate=2010-09-14}}</ref>

==Fictional character biographies==
While several other individuals have used the name Flash, these have lived either on other parallel worlds, or in the future. Garrick, Allen, and West are the best-known exemplars of the identity.

===Jay Garrick===
{{Main|Flash (Jay Garrick)}}

Jay Garrick was a college student in 1938 who accidentally inhaled heavy water vapors after taking a smoke break inside his laboratory where he had been working.<ref>http://www.cosmicteams.com/jsa/profiles/images/Flash-01.jpg</ref> As a result, he found that he could run at superhuman speed and had similarly fast reflexes. After a brief career as a [[college football]] star, he donned a red shirt with a lightning bolt and a stylized metal helmet with wings (based on images of the Greek deity [[Hermes]]), and began to fight crime as the Flash. His first case involved battling the "Faultless Four", a group of blackmailers. Garrick kept his identity secret for years without a mask by continually vibrating his body while in public so that any photograph of his face would be blurred. Although originally from [[Earth-Two]], he was incorporated into the history of [[List of DC Multiverse worlds|New Earth]] following the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' and is still active as the Flash operating out of Keystone City. He is a member of the [[Justice Society of America|Justice Society]].

===Barry Allen===
{{Main|Flash (Barry Allen)}}
'''Barry Allen''' is an assistant scientist from the Criminal and Forensic Science Division of Central City Police Department. Barry has a reputation for being very slow, deliberate, and frequently late, which frustrated his fiancée, [[Iris West Allen|Iris West]]. One night, as he was preparing to leave work, a freak lightning bolt struck a nearby shelf in his lab and doused him with a cocktail of unnamed chemicals.  As a result, Barry found that he could run extremely fast and had matching reflexes. He donned a set of red tights sporting a lightning bolt (reminiscent of the original [[Fawcett Comics]] [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]]), dubbed himself the Flash (after his childhood hero, Jay Garrick), and became a crimefighter active in [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]]. In his civilian identity, he stores the costume compressed in a special ring via the use of a special gas that could compress cloth fibers to a very small fraction of their normal size. He is also named by some as the most important character of the DC Universe.

Barry sacrificed his life for the universe in the 1985 maxi-series ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', and remained dead for over twenty years after that story's publication. With the 2008 series ''[[Final Crisis]]'', Barry returned to the DC Universe and returned to full prominence as the Flash in the 2009 series ''[[The Flash: Rebirth]]'', which was soon after followed by a new volume of ''[[The Flash (comic book)#Volume 3 (2010-Current)|The Flash]]'' ongoing series, where Barry's adventures as the Scarlet Speedster are currently published.<ref name="J&V">{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/080724-comiccon-flash-rebirth.html |title=SDCC '08 - Johns & Van Sciver Talk Flash: Rebirth |publisher=Newsarama.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-14}}</ref><ref name="vol3no1">{{Cite comic|Writer = Johns, Geoff|Title = The Flash|Volume = 3|Issue = 1|Date = April 2010|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>

===Wally West===
{{Main|Wally West}}

'''Wallace Rudolph "Wally" West''' is the nephew  of Iris West and of Barry Allen by marriage, and was introduced in ''The Flash'' (vol. 1) #110 (1959). When West was about ten years old, he was visiting his uncle's police laboratory, and the freak accident that gave Allen his powers repeated itself, bathing West in electrically charged chemicals. Now possessing the same powers as his uncle, West donned a copy of his uncle's outfit and became the young crime fighter '''Kid Flash'''. After the events of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' where Barry Allen was killed, Wally took over as the fastest man alive. Following the events of ''Infinite Crisis'', Wally, his wife Linda, and their twins left Earth for an unknown dimension.

Wally, his wife and twins were pulled back from the [[Speed Force]] by the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] at the conclusion of ''[[The Lightning Saga]]''.<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #10</ref>  This set the stage for Wally West's return as the Flash after the events of ''The Flash: Fastest Man Alive'' #13 (see Bart Allen), in ''All Flash'' #1, and with ''The Flash'' (vol. 2) series, which resumed with issue #231 in August 2007. It subsequently ends with issue #247, and West, along with all the other ''Flash'' characters, play a large role in 2009's ''[[The Flash: Rebirth]]''.<ref name="J&V"/>

===Bart Allen===
{{Main|Bart Allen}}

'''Bartholomew Henry "Bart" Allen II''' is the grandson of Barry Allen and his wife Iris. Bart suffered from accelerated aging and, as a result, was raised in a [[virtual reality]] machine until Iris took him back in time to get help from the then-current Flash, Wally West. With Wally's help, Bart's aging slowed, and he took the name '''Impulse'''. After he was shot in the knee by [[Deathstroke]], Bart changed both his attitude and his costume, taking the mantle of '''Kid Flash'''. During the events of ''Infinite Crisis'', the [[Speed Force]] vanished, taking with it all the speedsters save Jay Garrick. Bart returned, four years older, and for a year claimed that he was depowered from the event. However, the Speed Force had not disappeared completely, but had been absorbed into Bart's body; essentially, he now contained all of the Speed Force.

Bart's costume as the Flash was a clone of his grandfather's, similarly stylized to Wally West's. Not long after taking the mantle of the Flash, Bart was killed by the Rogues in the 13th (and final) issue of ''The Flash: The Fastest Man Alive''. However, he was later resurrected in the 31st century in ''[[Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds]]'' #3 by [[Brainiac 5]] to combat [[Superboy-Prime]] and the [[Legion of Super-Villains]]. Writer [[Geoff Johns]] confirmed that Bart will return to the past and play a large role in ''[[The Flash: Rebirth]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=19927 |title=NYCC - DC Universe Panel - CBR |publisher=Comicbookresources.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-14}}</ref>

===Others to carry the mantle of the Flash===

====Jesse Chambers====
{{Main|Jesse Chambers}}

Daughter of the speedster [[Johnny Quick (Johnny Chambers)|Johnny Quick]], '''Jesse Chambers''' becomes a speeding superhero like her father. She later meets Wally West, the Flash, who asks her to be his replacement if something were to happen to him (as part of an elaborate plan on his part, trying to force Bart Allen to take his role in the legacy of the Flash more seriously). She briefly assumes the mantle of the Flash, after Wally enters the Speed Force.<ref>''Flash'' (vol. 2) #97–99.</ref>

====John Fox====

''John Fox'' was a historian for the National Academy of Science in Central City in the 27th Century. He was sent back in time to get the help of one or more of the three Flashes (Garrick, Allen, West), in order to defeat the radioactive villain Mota back in his own time. Fox's mission was a failure, but the tachyon radiation that sent him through the time stream gave him superspeed. He became his century's Flash for a time; shortly after, he moved to the 853rd century and joined "Justice Legion A" (also known as [[Justice Legion Alpha]]) as seen in the [[DC One Million]] series of books.
The name "John Fox" is combined from the names of seminal comic book writers [[John Broome (writer)|John Broome]], who co-created the Barry Allen Flash, and [[Gardner Fox]], who co-created the Jay Garrick Flash.

====Unnamed Allen of the 23rd century====
The '''father of Sela Allen''', his wife and daughter were captured by [[Cobalt Blue]]. He is forced to watch his wife die and his daughter become crippled. As he and [[Max Mercury]] kill Cobalt Blue, a child takes the gem{{Clarify|date=December 2011}} and kills Allen. This Flash is one of the two destined Flashes to be killed by Cobalt Blue.

====Sela Allen====
[[File:Flash Sela.png|thumb|left|'''Sela Allen''' as the Flash of the 23rd century]]

'''Sela Allen''' is an ordinary human in the 23rd century until Cobalt Blue steals electrical impulses away from her, causing her to become as slow to the world as the world is to the Flash. Hoping to restore her, her father takes her into the Speed Force. When her father is killed, she appears as a living manifestation of the Speed Force, able to lend speed to various people and objects, but unable to physically interact with the world.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

[[File:Flash Blaine.png|thumb|left|180px|'''Blaine Allen''' as the Flash of the 28th century]]

'''Blaine Allen''' and his son live on the colony world of Petrus in the 28th century. In an attempt to end the Allen blood line, Cobalt Blue injects Allen's son Jace with a virus. Lacking super speed, Jace was unable to shake off the virus. In despair, Blaine takes his son to the [[Speed Force]] in the hopes that it would accept him. It takes Blaine instead and grants super speed to Jace so that he can shake off the sickness.<ref name=sf1>''Speed Force'' #1 (November 1997)</ref>

'''Jace Allen''' gains super speed when his father brings him into the [[Speed Force]] to attempt to cure him of a virus injected into his body by Cobalt Blue in an attempt to end the Allen bloodline.<ref name=sf1 /> In memory of his father, Jace assumes the mantle of the Flash and continues the feud against Cobalt Blue.<ref>''Flash v2'' #145 (February 1999)</ref>

====Kryiad====
After an alien creature invades Earth, a history buff named '''Kriyad''' travels back in time from the 98th century to acquire a [[Green Lantern]] [[power ring (weapon)|power ring]]. He fails, so he tries to capture the Flash's speed instead. After being beaten by Barry Allen (''The Flash'' (vol. 1) #309, May 1982), he travels back further in time and uses the chemicals from the clothes Barry Allen was wearing when he gained his powers to give himself super speed. Kryiad later sacrifices his life to defeat the alien creature.

====Bizarro Flash====
Bizarro-Flash was created when [[Bizarro]] cloned Flash. He had a costume the reverse colors of Flash's, however he had a mallet symbol because Flash was holding one when he was cloned. The modern version of Bizarro Flash has the symbol of a thunderbolt-shaped mustard stain.

==Powers and abilities==
All incarnations of the Flash can move, think, and react at light speeds as well as having superhuman endurance that allows them to run incredible distances. Some, notably later versions, can vibrate so fast that they can pass through walls in a process called [[quantum tunneling]],<ref name="PhysicsofSuperheroes">

On several occasions, the Flash has raced against [[Superman]], either to determine who is faster or as part of a mutual effort to thwart some type of threat; these races, however, often resulted in ties because of outside circumstances. Writer [[Jim Shooter]] and artist [[Curt Swan]] crafted the story "Superman's Race With the Flash!" in ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' #199 (Aug. 1967) which featured the first race between the Flash and Superman.<ref>{{cite book|last=McAvennie|first= Michael|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 124 |quote = Since the dawn of comics' Silver Age, readers have asked 'Who's faster: Superman or the Flash?'

Nelson Bridwell]] and artist [[Ross Andru]] produced "The Race to the End of the Universe", a follow-up story four months later in ''The Flash'' #175 (Dec. 1967).<ref>[http://www.comics.org/issue/21488/ ''The Flash'' #175 (December 1967)] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> However, after the [[DC Universe]] revision after ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', The Flash does successfully beat Superman in a race in ''Adventures of Superman'' #463 with the explanation that Superman is not accustomed to running at high speed for extended periods of time since flying is more versatile and less strenuous, which means the far more practiced Flash has the advantage. After [[Final Crisis]] in [[The Flash: Rebirth|Flash: Rebirth #3]] the Flash is shown as being much faster than Superman, able to out run him as Superman struggles to keep up with him. He reveals that all the close races between them had been "for charity". In the ''[[Smallville]]'' episode "Run", Flash is not only able to run faster than a pre-Superman Clark Kent but can match Clark's top speed while running backwards.

Speedsters may at times use the ability to speed-read at incredible rates and in doing so, process vast amounts of information. Whatever knowledge they acquire in this manner is usually temporary (Bart Allen seems to be the exception, though in earlier years, Max Mercury believed that Bart's speed learning would not stick).{{issue|date=March 2011}} Their ability to think fast also allows them some immunity to telepathy, as their thoughts operate at a rate too rapid for telepaths such as [[Martian Manhunter]] or [[Gorilla Grodd]] to read or influence their minds.

Flashes and other super-speedsters also have the ability to speak to one another at a highly accelerated rate. This is often done to have private conversations in front of non-fast people (as when Flash speaks to Superman about his ability to serve both the [[Teen Titans|Titans]] and the JLA in ''The Titans'' #2). Speed-talking is also sometimes used for comedic effect where Flash becomes so excited that he begins talking faster and faster until his words become a jumble of noise. He also has the ability to change the vibration of his vocal chords making it so he can change how his voice sounds to others.

The Flash has also claimed that he can process thoughts in less than an attosecond. At times he is able to throw lightning created by his super speed and make speed vortexes

In the final issue of ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', a new Multiverse is revealed, originally consisting of 52 identical realities. Among the parallel realities shown is one designated "Earth-2". As a result of [[Mister Mind]] "eating" aspects of this reality, it takes on visual aspects similar to the pre-Crisis Earth-2, including the Flash among other Justice Society of America characters. The names of the characters and the team are not mentioned in the panel in which they appear, but the Flash is visually similar to the Jay Garrick Flash.<ref>{{Cite comic | title=[[52 (comics)|52]] | issue=52 |date=May 2, 2007 | publisher=[[DC Comics]] | page=13 | panel=3 }}</ref>  Based on comments by [[Grant Morrison]], this alternate universe is not the pre-Crisis Earth-2.<ref>{{cite web

A variant of the Flash - a superfast college student named Mary Maxwell - was seen in the Elseworld book ''[[Just Imagine...|Just Imagine]] Stan Lee Creating The Flash''.

===Tanaka Rei===
The Flash of [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Earth-D|Earth-D]], Rei was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] man who idolized Barry Allen, whose stories only existed in comic books on this world. Rei was inspired by Allen to become the Flash, much like Allen was inspired to become the Flash by his idol, Jay Garrick. Allen and Rei met during the "Crisis on Infinite Earths" when Barry was coming back from the 30th century and arrived in the wrong universe. As Earth-D was under attack by the shadow demons, Barry called on the Justice League and Tanaka called on the Justice Alliance, his world's version of the Justice League. They built a [[cosmic treadmill]] and were able to evacuate much of Earth-D's population. The Justice League left, but 39 seconds later, Earth-D perished.

Rei made his only appearance in ''Legends of the DC Universe: Crisis on Infinite Earths'' (February 1999). The story was written by [[Marv Wolfman]], with art by [[Paul Ryan (comics)|Paul Ryan]] (pencils) and Bob McLeod (ink).

===''Superman & Batman: Generations 2''===

In ''[[Superman & Batman: Generations#Generations 2|Superman & Batman: Generations 2]]'', three different Flashes appear: Wally West as [[Kid Flash]] in 1964, Wally's cousin Carrie as Kid Flash in 1986, and Jay West, the son of Wally and his wife Magda as the fifth Flash in 2008. Barry Allen makes a cameo appearance out of costume in 1964.

=== Green Lightning ===
Ali Rayner-West, aka Green Lightning, is a descendant of both Kyle Rayner and Wally West. She has both a power ring and superspeed, as seen in ''[[Green Lantern: Circle of Fire]]''. She was a living construct created by Kyle Rayner's subconscious, who later re-fused into his mind.<ref>''Green Lantern: Circle of Fire'' #1 (October 2000)</ref>

===Ame-Comi===
A teenage version of [[Jesse Chambers]] appears as the Flash of the Ame-Comi universe. As with most of the other characters of that Earth, she sports an [[Anime]]-inspired costume.<ref>''Ame-Comi Duela Dent'' #2 (July 2012)</ref>

===The Crash===
The 1980s series ''[[Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew!]]'' presented the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|parallel Earth]] of "Earth-C-Minus", a world populated by [[funny animal]] superheroes that paralleled the mainstream DC Universe. Earth-C-Minus was the home of the Crash, a [[turtle]] with super-speed powers similar to those of Barry Allen's, and a member of his world's superhero team, the [[Just'a Lotta Animals]]. The Crash as a youth had read comics about Earth-C's [[Terrific Whatzit]], similar to how Barry Allen enjoyed comics about Earth-Two's Jay Garrick.<ref>''Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew'' #14-15, April–May 1983</ref>

===Danica Williams===
An African-American teenager named Danica Williams appears as the Flash in the ''Justice League Beyond'' series, acting as Wally West's successor during the 2040s (following the events of ''[[Batman Beyond]]''). She is employed at the Flash Museum in Central City, and like Barry Allen, is chronically late.<ref>Justice League Beyond #25</ref> She later enters into a relationship with Billy Batson, who is the secret identity of the superhero, [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]].

=== Bart Allen (Impulse)<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Bart Allen|url = https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bart_Allen&oldid=694571545|language = en}}</ref> ===
Another Speedstar from [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen's]] Blood line/His grandson.Given Birth to by Wally West and a active member of the teen titans before later being repositioned in the Young Justice TV Series<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Young Justice (TV series)|url = https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Young_Justice_(TV_series)&oldid=697189385|language = en}}</ref>

==In other media==
{{Main|Flash in other media}}
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}
Throughout his 70-year history, the Flash has appeared in numerous media. The Flash has been included in multiple animated features, such as ''[[Superfriends]]'' and ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'', as well as his own [[The Flash (1990 TV series)|live action television series]] and some guest star appearances on ''[[Smallville]]'' (as the Bart Allen/[[Impulse (DC Comics)|Impulse]] version.) There are numerous videos that feature the character.

*In the ''Challenge of the Superfriends'' series which ran from 1978–1979, he appears in every episode and has spoken lines in only twelve out of the sixteen episodes of the series. He also had two arch enemies from the Legion of Doom, [[Captain Cold]] and [[Gorilla Grodd]].

*''[[The Flash (1990 TV series)|The Flash]]'' appeared for one season (1990–1991) on the CBS Network, starring double-[[Emmy Award]] winner [[John Wesley Shipp]] as [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]]. Produced by [[Danny Bilson]] and [[Paul DeMeo]], the series was a mild amalgamation of the Barry Allen and [[Wally West]] versions of the comics in that the female lead was [[Tina McGee]] (portrayed by [[Amanda Pays]]) and Wally's need for large amounts of food after expending so much energy running all over [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]] was transferred to Barry. After his lightning-induced chemical accident, Barry got into crime fighting after the death of his police officer brother, Jay; it is presumed that Jay was named for the original comic book Flash, [[Jay Garrick]]. A handful of the Scarlet Speedster's rogues gallery made guest appearances throughout the series: Captain Cold ([[Michael Champion]]) ("Captain Cold"), [[Mirror Master]] ([[David Cassidy]]) ("Done With Mirrors"), and the [[Trickster (comics)|Trickster]] ([[Mark Hamill]]) ("The Trickster" and "Trial of the Trickster"). The Flash also fought a clone of himself who wore a blue costume.

:A few episodes were written by comics legend [[Howard Chaykin]] and the TV costume was designed by [[Dave Stevens]] (''[[The Rocketeer]]''). While a critical success and vigorously backed by the network, the series had the dubious distinction of being aired against ratings powerhouses ''[[The Cosby Show]]'' on [[NBC]] and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]'s ''[[The Simpsons]]''. ''The Flash'' was preempted by Christmas specials and the [[Desert Storm]] war in Iraq, and constantly moved all over the schedule,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} and was cancelled after its first and only season. Warner Brothers released the series in a 6-disc DVD box set on January 10, 2006.

:The series' main musical theme was composed by Danny Elfman, with the remainder of the episodes' music being composed by Shirley Walker (this collaboration would also occur on ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''). When the Flash made a guest appearance in the ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' episode 'Speed Demons', Walker incorporated some of the themes from the live-action series into the episode.

*In the music scene, the band [[Jim's Big Ego]] released a song called "The Ballad of Barry Allen" on their album "They're Everywhere". The song portrays Barry as a tragic character, whose perception of the world is so accelerated that all of reality appears to proceed at a snail's pace, causing him to gradually slip into depression. The band's frontman, [[Jim Infantino]], is the nephew of Flash co-creator [[Carmine Infantino]], who provided the cover art for the same album.

*The Flash is a playable character in the [[Mortal Kombat]] and [[DC Comics]] crossover game ''[[Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe]]''. The first official render for The Flash was released to the public on Monday July 7, 2008. His bio reveals that this version is Barry Allen. He is also a playable character in ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'', developed by [[NetherRealm Studios]].

*Two versions of the Flash make appearances in ''[[DC Universe Online]]''. Barry Allen fights alongside the heroes against Gorilla Grodd's army, and is a bounty for the villains. Jay Garrick appears in the Watchtower, selling powerful armor to Level 30 Heroes with the Metapower origin.
 
*Impulse is shown in ''[[Young Justice: Invasion]]'' as the grandson of Barry Allen and Iris West. He comes from the future to save his grandfather from [[Neutron (DC Comics)|Neutron]] (A.K.A. Nathaniel Tryon). Once he travels back he does succeed in saving Barry Allen, and stopping Neutron, this was supposed to save the future, but it is shown that the future remains the same. When he tries to travel back to his time (2056), his time machine doesn't work, it is shown in a backstory that he knew he was going to be stuck in the past, because the wires would be fried, though he doesn't reveal this to anyone on The Team, at that moment, he is considered an official member.

*In the ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' episode titled "The Scientist", Central City CSI Investigator Barry Allen partners with Felicity Smoak to find the thief that broke into one of the Queen Consolidated Applied Sciences building. Barry claims that he was sent from Central City to Starling City to investigate since there were connections to a case in Central City. Oliver Queen soon finds out that Barry was actually an assistant who came to Starling to investigate this strange occurrence in the hope that he would find an answer to who murdered his mother when he was a child. His appearance set up the character for his [[The Flash (2014 TV series)|own series]] in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/flash-writers-preview-cws-newest-595705|title='Flash' Writers Preview the CW's Newest Superhero|last=Goldberg|first=Lesley|publisher=The Hollywood Reporter|date=July 30, 2013|accessdate=July 30, 2013}}</ref>

*The Flash made his first theatrical film appearance in ''[[The Lego Movie]]''. He was part of Metalbeard's pirate crew.

*In October 2014, Warner Bros. announced that [[Ezra Miller]] will star as the lead in a live-action film adaptation of ''The Flash'' set to be released in 2018 along with a cameo in the 2016 film ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://moviepilot.com/posts/2015/09/02/ezra-miller-confirms-the-flash-for-batman-vs-superman-3517664|title=Ezra Miller Confirms The Flash For Batman vs Superman|publisher=Movie Pilot.com|accessdate=September 8, 2015}}</ref>

==In popular culture==
Numerous references to the Flash are presented on the television show ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]''. A particular reference is main character [[Sheldon Cooper]]'s Flash [[t-shirt]], which has become a staple of [[merchandise]] clothing. In Season 1 Episode 6 "The Middle-Earth Paradigm", the four main male characters on the show all independently dress up for a Halloween party as the Flash before deciding that they can't all be the Flash so no one gets to.

In Season Three of LOST, titled Catch-22, Charlie and Hurley debate over who would win a footrace between The Flash and Superman.

The false name [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] is used by character of con artist [[Frank Abagnale, Jr.]](posing as a Secret Service Agent), in the movie ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]''. When a coffee shop waiter notices the notes of [[FBI]] agent Carl Hanratty, he reveals that Barry Allen is the Flash, giving Carl a vital clue to his unknown subject's identity.

In 2006, a near-pristine copy of ''Flash Comics'' #1 was sold in a [[Heritage Auctions|Heritage]] Auction for [[$]]273,125. The same book was then sold privately for $450,000 in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://itsalljustcomics.com/2010/03/16/edgar-churchmile-high-flash-comics-1-sells-for-450000/ |title=Edgar Church/Mile High Flash Comics #1 Sells for $450,000 |publisher=Itsalljustcomics.com |date=2010-03-16 |accessdate=2010-09-14}}</ref>

[[Renan Kanbay]] wears a Flash costume while playing Carrie, the manager of a [[comic book store]], in [[Joe Lipari]]'s ''[[Dream Job (short film)|Dream Job]]'' (2011).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1956481/movieconnections|title=IMDB Connections}}</ref>

The band [[Jim's Big Ego]] wrote the song "The Ballad of Barry Allen" detailing the hardship having to watch time moving so slowly from the perspective of Allen. The frontman of the band, [[Jim Infantino]] is the nephew of Flash artist [[Carmine Infantino]].

In the movie ''[[Daddy Day Care]]'', one of the day care kids named Tony wore a Flash costume for the majority of the film.

In the ''[[My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic]]'' episode "Power Ponies", Pinkie Pie becomes a superhero based on the Flash called Fili-Second.

==Rogues==
{{Main|Rogues (comics)}}
{{See also|List of Flash enemies}}
Like [[Batman]], the Flash has a reputation for having fought a distinctive and memorable [[rogues gallery]] of supervillains. In the Flash's case, some of these villains have adopted the term "Flash's Rogues Gallery" as an official title, and insist on being called "Rogues" rather than "supervillains" or similar names. At times, various combinations of the Rogues have banded together to commit crimes or take revenge on the Flash, usually under the leadership of Captain Cold.

The Rogues are known for their communal style relationship, socializing together and operating under a strict moral code, sometimes brutally enforced by [[Captain Cold]]. Such "rules" include "no drugs" and, except in very dire situations or on unique occasions, "no killing" but the Rogues have tried to kill The Flash on occasion.

Considering the blue collar nature of the Flash's Rogues, more than a few{{who|date=November 2014}} have protested the inclusion of [[Professor Zoom]] and [[Abra Kadabra (comics)|Abra Kadabra]], often labeling them [[Psychosis|psychotic]], as time travel generally works against their crimes and, at least in the original Zoom's case, they found him dangerous and too willing to kill.

In contrast, several new Flash villains have been considered Rogues, including [[Murmur (DC Comics)|Murmur]], [[Double Down (comics)|Double Down]], and [[Peek-a-Boo (comics)|Peek-A-Boo]], but they play second fiddle to new incarnations of [[Captain Boomerang]], [[Zoom (comics)|Zoom]], [[Mirror Master]], and [[Inertia (DC Comics)|Inertia]] (a variation on [[Reverse-Flash]], clone of [[Bart Allen|Impulse]]).
