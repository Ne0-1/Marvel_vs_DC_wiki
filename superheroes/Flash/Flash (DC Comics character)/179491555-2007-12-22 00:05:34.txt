'''The Flash''' is a name shared by several [[Fictional character|fictional]] [[comic book]] [[superhero]]es from the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Comics Universe|universe]]. Created by writer [[Gardner Fox]] and artist [[Harry Lampert]], the original Flash first appeared in ''[[Flash Comics]]'' #1 (1940).

Once nicknamed ''the Scarlet Speedster,'' the Flash possesses "super-speed," which includes the ability to run and move extremely fast, use superhuman reflexes and violate certain [[laws of physics]].  Thus far, four different [[fictional character|characters]], each of whom somehow gained the power of "super-speed", have assumed the identity of the Flash: [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]] (1940-), [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] (1956-1986), [[Flash (Wally West)|Wally West]] (1986-2006, 2007-), and [[Bart Allen]] (2006-2007).

The second incarnation of the Flash is generally considered the first hero of the [[Silver Age of comic books]] and the superhero has remained one of DC‘s most popular ever since. Each version of the Flash has been a key member of either the [[Justice Society of America]] or the [[Justice League]], DC’s all-star teams. Wally West has recently rejoined the Justice League.

The Barry Allen version of the character (with Wally West elements) was featured in [[The Flash (TV series)|a live action television series]] in 1990, starring [[John Wesley Shipp]]. The Wally West version of the Flash is featured in the [[animation|animated series]] ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]''.

== Publication history ==
=== Golden Age ===

The Flash [[first appearance|first appeared]] in the [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden Age]] ''Flash Comics'' #1 (Jan. 1940), from [[All-American Publications]], one of three companies that would eventually merge to form [[DC Comics]]. Created by writer [[Gardner Fox]] and artist [[Harry Lampert]], this Flash was '''[[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]]''', a college student who gained his speed through the inhalation of [[hard water]] vapors (later [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] into [[heavy water]] vapors), and who wore a winged metal helmet reminiscent of the [[Greek mythology|mythological Greek god]] [[Hermes]]. He is notable as the first super-speedster in comics, and one of the first to have a single super-power as opposed to multi-powered heroes such as [[Superman]].

Garrick was a popular character in the 1940s, supporting both ''Flash Comics'' and ''All-Flash Quarterly'' (later published bi-monthly as simply ''All-Flash''); co-starring in ''[[Comic Cavalcade]]''; and being a charter member of the [[Justice Society of America]], the first superhero team, whose adventures ran in ''[[All Star Comics]]''. With superheroes' post-war decline in popularity, ''Flash Comics'' was canceled with issue #104 (1949). The Justice Society's final Golden Age story ran in ''[[All Star Comics]]'' #57 (1951; the title itself continued, as ''All Star Western'').

=== Silver Age ===

In 1956, DC Comics successfully revived superheroes, ushering in what became known as the [[Silver Age of comic books]].  Rather than bringing back the same Golden Age heroes, as [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], the 1950s precursor of [[Marvel Comics]], unsuccessfully tried to do, DC reimagined them as new characters for the modern age. The Flash was the first revival, in the aptly named tryout comic book ''[[Showcase (comic book)|Showcase]]'' #4 (Oct. 1956).

This new Flash was '''[[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]]''', a police scientist who gained super-speed when bathed by chemicals after a shelf of them was struck by lightning. He adopted the name ''The Flash'' after reading a comic book featuring the Golden Age Flash. After several more appearances in ''Showcase'', Allen's character was given his own title, ''The Flash'', the first issue of which was #105 (resuming where ''Flash Comics'' had left off).

The Silver Age Flash proved popular enough that several other Golden Age heroes were revived in new incarnations. A new superhero team, the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]], was also created, with the Flash as a charter member.

=== "The Flashes of Two Worlds" ===

The Flash also introduced a much-imitated plot device into superhero comics when it was revealed that Garrick and Allen existed on fictional [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel world]]s. Their powers allowed them to cross the dimensional boundary between worlds, and the men became good friends. ''[[Flash of Two Worlds]]'' (The Flash vol.1 #123) was the first crossover in which a Golden Age character met a Silver Age character. Soon, there were crossovers between the entire Justice League and the Justice Society; their respective teams began an annual get-together which endured from the early 1960s until the mid-1980s.

Allen's adventures continued in his own title until the advent of ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''. ''The Flash'' ended as a series with #350. Allen's life had become considerably confused in the early 1980s, and DC elected to end his adventures and pass the mantle on to another character. Allen died heroically in ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' #8 (1986). Thanks to his ability to travel through time, he would continue to appear occasionally in the years to come.

=== Modern Age ===

The third Flash was '''[[Wally West]]''', who was introduced in ''Flash'' #110 (Dec. 1959) as '''Kid Flash'''. West, Allen's nephew by marriage, gained the Flash's powers through an accident identical to Allen's. Adopting the identity of Kid Flash, he maintained membership in the [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]] for years. Following Allen's death, West adopted the Flash identity in ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' #12 and was given his own series, beginning with ''The Flash'' vol. 2, #1 in 1987.  Many issues began with the simultaneously glad and rueful [[catchphrase]]: ''"My name is Wally West, I'm the fastest man alive, I'm the Flash."''

Due to the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' miniseries and the "[[One Year Later]]" jump in time in the [[DC Universe]], DC cancelled ''The Flash'' vol. 2, in January 2006 at #230. A new series, ''The Flash: The Fastest Man Alive'', began on [[June 21]] [[2006]]. The initial story arc of this series, written by [[Danny Bilson]] and [[Paul De Meo]] with art by [[Ken Lashley]], focused on '''[[Bart Allen]]''' acceptance of the role of the Flash. 

''Flash: Fastest Man Alive'' was canceled with issue #13. In its place ''The Flash'' (vol. 2) was revived with issue 231, with [[Mark Waid]] as the initial writer. Waid also wrote ''All-Flash'' #1 that acted as a bridge between the two series.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.newsarama.com/heroes_philly07/DC/flash.html| title = "Mark Waid Returns to ''The Flash''"| accessdate = 2007-07-15| last = Rogers| first = Vaneta |date=2007-07-15| publisher = Newsarama}}</ref> DC had solicited ''Flash: Fastest Man Alive'' through issue #15. ''All Flash'' #1 replaced issue #14 and ''The Flash'' vol. 2, #231 replaced issue #15 in title and interor creative team only. The covers and cover artists were as solicited by DC, and the information text released was devoid of any plot information.<ref>{{cite journal

== Fictional biographies ==

While several other individuals have used the name Flash, these have lived either on other parallel worlds, or in the future.  Garrick, Allen and West are the best-known exemplars of the identity. 

=== Jay Garrick ===
{{main|Flash (Jay Garrick)}}
Jay Garrick was a college student in January 1940 who accidentally inhaled [[heavy water]] vapors after falling asleep in his laboratory where he had been smoking.  As a result, he found that he could run at superhuman speed and had similarly fast reflexes. After a brief career as a college football star, he donned a red shirt with a lightning bolt and a stylized metal helmet with wings (based on images of the Roman god [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]), and began to fight crime as the Flash.  His first case involved battling the "Faultless Four", a group of blackmailers. Jay kept his identity secret for years without a mask by continually vibrating his body while in public so that any photograph of his face would be blurred. Although originally from [[Earth-Two|Earth-2]] he was incorporated into the history of [[Earth-1]] following the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]] and is still active as the Flash operating out of Keystone City. He is a member of the [[Justice Society of America|Justice Society]].

=== Barry Allen ===
{{main|Flash (Barry Allen)}}
Bartholomew "Barry" Allen was a [[police]] scientist with a reputation for being very slow, deliberate, and frequently late, which frustrated his fiancée, Iris West. One night, as he was preparing to leave work, a lightning bolt shattered a case full of chemicals and spilled them all over Allen. As a result, Allen found that he could run extremely fast and had matching reflexes. He donned a set of red tights sporting a lightning bolt (reminiscent of the original [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]]), dubbed himself the Flash (after his childhood hero in the comic books, Jay Garrick), and became a crimefighter. In his civilian identity, he stored the costume in his ring, which could eject the compressed clothing when Allen needed it and suck it back in with the aid of a special gas that shrinks the suit.

=== Wally West ===
{{main|Wally West}}
Wallace Rudolph West was the nephew of Iris West and Barry Allen by marriage, and was introduced in ''The Flash'' #110 (1959). When West was about ten years old, he was visiting his uncle's [[police]] laboratory, and the freak accident that gave Allen his powers repeated itself, bathing West in electrically charged chemicals.  Now possessing the same powers as his uncle, West donned a copy of his uncle's outfit and became the young crime fighter '''Kid Flash'''. After the events of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', where Barry Allen was killed, Wally took over as the fastest man alive. Following the events of ''Infinite Crisis'', Wally, his wife Linda, and their twins left Earth for an unknown dimension. Wally, his wife and twins were pulled back from the Speed Force by the Legion of Super-Heroes.<ref>''Justice League of America'' (vol. 2) #10</ref> This set the stage for Wally West's return as the Flash after the events of ''The Flash: Fastest Man Alive'' #13 (see Bart Allen), in ''All Flash'' #1, and with ''The Flash'' (Vol. 2) series, which resumed with issue #231 in August 2007.

=== Bart Allen ===
{{main|Bart Allen}}
[[Image:New flashl.jpg|thumb|Bart Allen as the fourth Flash. Variant cover of ''The Flash: The Fastest Man Alive'' #1 (2006).  Art by [[Andy Kubert|Andy]] & [[Joe Kubert]]]]

Bart Allen was the grandson of Barry Allen and his wife Iris. Bart suffered from accelerated aging and, as a result, was raised in a virtual reality machine until Iris took him back in time in order to get help from the then current Flash, Wally West. With Wally's help, Bart's aging slowed and he took the name '''Impulse'''. After he was shot in the kneecap by [[Deathstroke]], Bart changed both his attitude and his costume, taking the mantle of '''Kid Flash.'''  During the events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', the [[Speed Force]] vanished, taking with it all the speedsters save Jay Garrick. Bart returned, four years older, and for a year claimed that he was depowered from the event.  However, the Speed Force had not disappeared completely, and was absorbed into Bart's body, making it such that Bart contains all of the Speed Force. Bart's costume is Barry Allen's cloned Flash suit in the form of Wally West's suit. Bart Allen was recently killed by the Rogues in the 13th and final issue of ''The Flash: Fastest Man Alive''.

=== Others to carry the mantle of the Flash ===
==== Jesse Chambers ====
{{main|Jesse Chambers}}
Daughter of the speedster [[Johnny Quick (Johnny Chambers)|Johnny Quick]], Jesse Chambers became a speeding superhero like her father.  She later met Wally West, the Flash, who would ask her to be his replacement if something were to happen to him, (as part of an elaborate plan on his part, trying to force Bart Allen to take his role in the legacy of the Flash more seriously). She briefly assumes the mantle of the Flash, after Wally enters the Speed Force. <ref> Flash vol2. #97-99.</ref>

==== Unnamed Allen of the 23rd Century ====

The father of '''Sela Allen''', his wife and daughter were captured by [[Cobalt Blue]]. He was forced to watch his wife die and his daughter become crippled. As he and [[Max Mercury]] killed Cobalt Blue, a child took the gem and killed Allen. This Flash was one of the two destined Flashes to be killed by Cobalt Blue (Eobard Thawne).

==== Sela Allen ====
[[Image:SelaAllen.gif|thumb|left|'''Sela Allen''' as the Flash of the 23rd century.]]
Sela Allen is an ordinary human, in the 23rd century until [[Cobalt Blue]] steals electrical impulses away from her, causing her to become as slow to the world as the world is to The Flash. Hoping to restore her, her father takes her into the Speed Force. When her father is killed she appears as a living manifestation of The Flash, able to lend speed to various people and objects but unable to physically interact with the world.

==== John Fox ====
[[Image:JohnFox1.gif|thumb|'''John Fox''' as the Flash.]]
When Manfred Mota resurfaced in 27th century, John Fox, a tachyon scientist, traveled back in time to gain aid from the three Flashes who had defeated Manfred before. He failed to make contact but the time travel left him with superspeed. He used a combination of various previous Flash costumes to create his own costume. After defeating Mota he was sidelined by the invention of speed metal. He began searching the timestream for a time where he could belong, briefly replacing a time-displaced Wally West in the 20th century before finally settled in the year 85,265 where he joined the Justice Legion. In issue #2 of the 2007 Booster Gold series, there is a panel depicting Dr. Thirteen's group breaking the fourth wall by complaining about the Architects' only using popular "fellows" in new comics, John Fox was mentioned by name.

==== Blaine Allen ====
[[Image:BlaineAllen1.gif|thumb|left|'''Blaine Allen''' as the Flash of the 28th century.]]
Blaine and his son lived on the colony world of Petrus in the 28th century. In an attempt to end the Allen blood line, [[Cobalt Blue]] injected Allen's son Jace with a virus. Lacking superspeed, Jace was unable to shake off the virus. In despair, Blaine took his son to the speed force in the hopes that it would accept him. It took Blaine instead, and gave superspeed to Jace so that he could shake off the disease.

==== Jace Allen ====

Jace Allen gained superspeed from his father after having him cured from the virus [[Cobalt Blue]] injected in him in an attempt to end the Allen bloodline. In memory of his father, Jace took up the mantle of the Flash and continued the feud against Cobalt Blue.

==== Kryad ====

After an alien creature invaded Earth, a history buff named Kryad travelled back in time from the 98th century to acquire a GL power ring. He failed, so he tried to capture The Flash's speed instead. After being beaten by Wally West he went back further in time and used the chemicals from the clothes Barry Allen was wearing when he gained his powers. He gave his life to defeat the alien creature.


== Alternate versions ==
[[Image:FlashEarth-D.gif|thumb|Tanaka Rei from ''Legends of the DC Universe: Crisis on Infinite Earths''. Art by Paul Ryan and Bob McLeod.]]
In the final issue of ''[[52 (comic book)|52]]'', a new Multiverse is revealed, originally consisting of 52 identical realities. Among the parallel realities shown is one designated "Earth-2". As a result of [[Mister Mind]] "eating" aspects of this reality, it takes on visual aspects similar to the pre-Crisis Earth-2, including the [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Flash]] among other Justice Society of America characters. The names of the characters and the team are not mentioned in the panel in which they appear, but the Flash is visually similar to the Jay Garrick Flash.<ref>
{{Comic book reference | title=[[52 (comic book)|52]] | issue=52 |date=May 2, 2007 | publisher=[[DC Comics]] | page=13 | panel=3 }}</ref>
Based on comments by [[Grant Morrison]], this alternate universe is not the pre-Crisis Earth-2.<ref>{{cite web

A variant of the Flash - a superfast college student named Mary Maxwell - was seen in the Elseworld book ''[[Just Imagine...|Just Imagine]] Stan Lee Creating The Flash.''

===Tanaka Rei===
The Flash of [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Earth-D|Earth-D]], Rei was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] man who idolized Barry Allen, whose stories only existed in comic books. Rei was inspired by Allen to become the Flash, much like Allen was inspired to become the Flash by his idol, Jay Garrick. Allen and Rei met during the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]] when Barry was coming back from the [[30th century]] and arrived in the wrong universe. As that earth was under attack by the shadow demons, Barry called on the Justice League and Tanaka called on the Justice Alliance, his world's version of the Justice League. They built a [[cosmic treadmill]] and made an evacuation. The Justice League left, but 39 seconds later, Earth-D perished. 

Rei made his only appearance in ''Legends of the DC Universe: Crisis on Infinite Earths''.


== Powers and abilities ==
{{Citation-style}}
{{Original research|date=October 2007}}
All incarnations of the Flash can move, think, and react at superhuman speeds, their body molecules{{Fact|date=October 2007}} vibrate so fast that the Flash can walk through walls. All possess an aura that prevents air friction from affecting their bodies and clothes while moving.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}

Barry Allen was believed to be the fastest of all known Flashes, and was known to have travelled faster than the "speed of thought".{{Fact|date=October 2007}} However, when Barry Allen pushed himself further (while imploding the [[Anti-Monitor]]'s chief weapon during the ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'') he appeared to waste away as he was converted into pure kinetic energy, travelled back in time, and was revealed to be the very bolt of lightning that gave him his powers. Barry Allen possessed several other abilities that Jay Garrick and Wally West have not always been able to duplicate.{{Fact|date=October 2007}} He could run on thick snow clouds. Most unusual was Allen's complete control of his molecules, allowing him to vibrate through solid matter and, on one occasion when transformed into a mirror, "melt" himself and reform as a human to defeat his foe, the [[Mirror Master]]. His reflexes and ability to vibrate are so entwined he can feel the tip of a bullet touch him, then vibrate so it passes through him.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}

Wally West has said more than once that Barry Allen was the Flash most experienced with time travel. However, Wally has been shown to have a connection to the [[Speed Force]], an extradimensional energy source, which provides his powers and gives him several other abilities. While all speedsters are powered by the force, West mainlines the power from the force itself and cannot be cut off from the source, unlike the others. Wally has, on several occasions, sped [[Faster-than-light|faster than light]] and been pulled into and exited the Speed Force by his own volition.{{Fact|date=October 2007}} He can create his costume out of goes fast, and can either impart his high velocities to other people and objects already in motion or steal the velocity they possess. Jay Garrick also possesses this ability to some degree; he stole speed from [[Black Adam]] in order to defeat the villainous [[Johnny Sorrow]], and he has threatened to steal [[Bart Allen]]'s (formerly Impulse and Kid Flash, and now the Flash) speed on at least one occasion when he was misbehaving. West can vibrate through objects; in the past, West would cause whatever he vibrated through to explode, but has recently shown this to be a controlled ability as he can pass through objects without any ensuing explosion. Although not nearly as precise as Allen when he used his cosmic treadmill, West has shown to be able to traverse time and dimensions with his own powers, like Allen in ''Showcase'' #4 in 1956. However, Wally now accelerates to the point that he is skirting the very edge of the Speed Force dimension, and can traverse along the timestream to specific points as they become visible, much like watching a movie in fast forward or reverse (however, he must have a particular speedster's vibratory signature to search for and lock onto, or be very familiar with the vibration of that time period).

Occasionally, the top speeds of the Flashes are [[Speed of light|light speed]],{{Fact|date=October 2007}} although Barry Allen and Wally West have been shown to have sped faster than light (as mentioned previously).{{Fact|date=October 2007}} On several occasions, the Flash has been shown in various races against [[Superman]] to determine which one is faster (or as part of a mutual effort to thwart some type of threat); these races, however, often resulted in ties (or indeterminate results). However, in recent races between Wally and Superman, West has been shown to be the faster of the two<ref>Justice, Oct 2006</ref>. As explained in ''The Secret of Barry Allen'', Wally's ability to tap into the speed force allows him to reach greater speeds than Superman. It should, however, be noted that the Silver Age Superman was much faster than the current one. 

Speedsters may at times use the ability to speed-read at incredible rates and in doing so, process vast amounts of information. Whatever knowledge they acquire in this manner is usually temporary ([[Bart Allen]] seems to be the exception, though in earlier years, Max Mercury believed that Bart's speed learning would not stick).

Flashes and other super-speedsters also have the ability to speak to one another at a highly accelerated rate. This is often done to have private conversations in front of non-fast people (as when Flash speaks to Superman about his ability to serve both the [[Titans (comics)|Titans]] and the JLA in ''The Titans'' #2). Speed-talking is also sometimes used for comedic effect where Flash becomes so excited that he begins talking faster and faster until his words become a jumble of noise (Wally West once became so surprised that he generated a small sonic boom with his voice).

== Awards ==

The comics and characters have been nominated for and won several awards over the years, including:
* ''1961 [[Alley Award for Best Cover]]'' (''Flash'' #123)
* ''1961 [[Alley Award for Best Single Comic]]'' (''Flash'' #123 by [[Gardner Fox]] and [[Carmine Infantino]])
* ''1963 [[Alley Award for Cross-Over of DC Heroes]]'' for ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' (with [[Hawkman]])
* ''1964 [[Alley Award for Best Short Story]]'' ("Doorway to the Unknown" in ''Flash'' #148 by [[John Broome (writer)|John Broome]] and [[Carmine Infantino]]).

==Appearances in other media==
{{main|The Flash in other media}}

Throughout his 60 year history, the Flash has appeared in numerous media. The Flash has been included in multiple animated features, such as [[Superfriends]] and [[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]], as well as his own [[The Flash (TV series)|live action television series.]] and some guest star appearances on [[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]. There are numerous video games that feature the character.

==Rogues==
{{main|Rogues (comics)}}
{{seealso|List of Flash enemies}}

Like [[Batman]], the Flash has a reputation for having fought a distinctive and memorable [[rogues gallery]] of supervillains. In the Flash's case, some of these villains have adopted the term "Flash's Rogues Gallery" as an official title, and insist on being called "Rogues" rather than "supervillains" or similar names. At times, various combinations of the Rogues have banded together in order to commit crimes or take revenge on the Flash, usually under the leadership of [[Captain Cold]].

The Rogues are known for their communal style relationship, hanging out together and operating under a pretty strict moral code, sometimes brutally enforced by Captain Cold. Such "rules" include "no drugs" and, except in very dire situations or on unique occasions, "no killing".
