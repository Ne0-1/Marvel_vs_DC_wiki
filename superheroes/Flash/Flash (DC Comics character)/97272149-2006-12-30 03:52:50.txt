'''The Flash''' is a title given to a series of [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]]es. Created by writer [[Gardner Fox]] and artist [[Harry Lampert]], the original Flash first appeared in ''[[Flash Comics]] #1'' (1940).  

Once nicknamed ''the Scarlet Speedster,'' the Flash possesses "super-speed", which includes the ability to run and move extremely fast, use superhuman reflexes and violate certain [[laws of physics]].  Thus far, four different [[fictional character|characters]], each of whom somehow gained the power of "super-speed", have assumed the identity of the Flash: [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]] (1940-Present), [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] (1956-1986), [[Flash (Wally West)|Wally West]] (1986-2006), and [[Bart Allen]] (2006-present).

The second incarnation of the Flash is generally considered the first hero of the [[Silver Age of comic books]] and the superhero has remained one of DC‘s most popular ever since.  Each version of the Flash has been a key member of either the [[Justice Society of America]] or the [[Justice League]], DC’s all-star teams, although it has yet to be seen what kind of role Bart Allen will play in either the Justice League or Justice Society, given how recently he assumed his role as the current Flash, alongside Jay Garrick.

The Barry Allen version of the character was featured in [[The Flash (TV series)|a live action television series]] in 1990, starring [[John Wesley Shipp]].  The Wally West version of the Flash is featured in the [[animation|animated series]] ''[[Justice League (animated series)|Justice League]]'', voiced by [[Michael Rosenbaum]], who is now the face of [[Lex Luthor]] on [[Smallville (TV Series)|Smallville]].

==Publication history==
===Golden Age===
The Flash [[first appearance|first appeared]] in the [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden Age]] ''Flash Comics'' #1 (1940), from [[All-American Publications]], one of three companies that would eventually merge to form [[DC Comics]].  Created by writer [[Gardner Fox]] and artist [[Harry Lampert]], this Flash was '''[[Jay Garrick]]''', a college student who gained his speed through the inhalation of [[hard water]] vapors (later [[retconned]] into [[heavy water]] vapors), and who wore a winged metal helmet reminiscent of the [[Roman mythology|mythological Roman god]] [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]].  He is notable as the first super-speedster in comics, and one of the first to have a single super-power as opposed to the multi-powered [[Superman]].

Garrick was a popular character in the 1940s, supporting both ''Flash Comics'' and ''All-Flash Quarterly'' (later published bi-monthly as simply ''All-Flash''); co-starring in ''[[Comic Cavalcade]]''; and being a charter member of the [[Justice Society of America]], the first superhero team, whose adventures ran in ''[[All Star Comics]]''.  With superheroers' post-war decline in popularity, ''Flash Comics'' was cancelled with issue #104 (1949).  The Justice Society's final Golden Age story ran in ''[[All Star Comics]]'' #57 (1951; the title itself continued, as ''All Star Western'').

===Silver Age===
In 1956, DC Comics successfully revived superheroes, ushering in what became known as the [[Silver Age of comic books]].  Rather than bringing back the same Golden Age heroes, as [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], the 1950s precursor of [[Marvel Comics]], unsuccessfully tried to do, DC reimagined them as new characters for the modern age.  The Flash was the first revival, in the aptly named tryout comic book ''[[Showcase (comic book)|Showcase]]'' #4 (Oct. 1956).

This new Flash was [[Barry Allen]], a police scientist who gained super-speed when bathed by chemicals after a shelf of them was struck by lightning.  He adopted the name ''The Flash'' after reading a comic book featuring the Golden Age Flash.  After several more appearances in ''Showcase'', Allen's character was given his own title, ''The Flash'', the first issue of which was #105 (resuming where ''Flash Comics'' had left off).

The Silver Age Flash proved popular enough that several other Golden Age heroes were revived in new incarnations.  A new superhero team, the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]], was also created, with the Flash as a charter member.

===The Flashes of two worlds===
The Flash also introduced a much-imitated plot device into superhero comics when it was revealed that Garrick and Allen existed on fictional [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel world]]s.  Their powers allowed them to cross the dimensional boundary between worlds, and the men became good friends. ''The Flash of Two Worlds'' was the first crossover in which a Golden Age character met a Silver Age character.  Soon, there were crossovers between the entire Justice League and the Justice Society; their respective teams began an annual get-together which endured from the early 1960s until the mid-1980s.

Allen's adventures continued in his own title until the advent of ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''.  ''The Flash'' ended as a series with #350.  Allen's life had become considerably confused in the early 1980s, and DC elected to end his adventures and pass the mantle on to another character.  Allen died heroically in the issue #8 of the Crisis (1986). Thanks to his ability to travel through time, he would continue to appear occasionally in the years to come.

===Modern Age===
The third Flash was '''[[Wally West]]''', who was introduced in ''Flash'' #110 (1959) as '''Kid Flash'''.  West, Allen's nephew by marriage, gained the Flash's powers through an accident identical to Allen's.  Adopting the identity of Kid Flash, he maintained membership in the [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]] for years.  Following Allen's death, West adopted the Flash identity in ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' #12 and was given his own series, beginning with ''The Flash'' (2nd series) #1 in 1987.  Many issues began Flash with the simultaneously glad and rueful [[catchphrase]]: ''"My name is Wally West, I'm the fastest man alive, I'm the Flash."''

Due to the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' miniseries and the "[[One Year Later]]" jump in time in the [[DC Universe]], DC cancelled ''The Flash'' (2nd series) in January 2006 at #230.  A new series, ''The Flash: The Fastest Man Alive'', began on [[June 21]] [[2006]]. Written by [[Danny Bilson]] and [[Paul De Meo]] and drawn by [[Ken Lashley]], this series reveals Barry's grandson '''[[Bart Allen]]''' to be the heir to the Flash mantle.

==Fictional biographies==
While several other individuals have used the name Flash, these have lived either on other parallel worlds, or in the future.  Garrick, Allen and West are the best-known exemplars of the identity.

===Jay Garrick===
{{main|Flash (Jay Garrick)}}

Jay Garrick was a college student in January 1940 who accidentally inhaled [[heavy water]] vapors after falling asleep in his laboratory where he had been smoking.  As a result, he found that he could run at superhuman speed and had similarly fast reflexes.  After a brief career as a college football star, he donned a red shirt with a lightning bolt and a stylized metal helmet with wings (based on images of the Roman god [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]), and began to fight crime as the Flash.  His first case involved battling the "Faultless Four", a group of blackmailers.  Jay kept his identity secret for years without a mask by continually vibrating his body while in public so that any photograph of his face would be blurred.  He is still active as the Flash, and operates out of Keystone City.

===Barry Allen===
{{main|Flash (Barry Allen)}}

Barry Allen was a [[police]] scientist with a reputation for being very slow, deliberate, and frequently late, which frustrated his fiancée, Iris West.  One night, as he was preparing to leave work, a lightning bolt shattered a case full of chemicals and spilled them all over Allen.  As a result, Allen found that he could run extremely fast and had matching reflexes.  He donned a set of red tights sporting a lightning bolt (reminiscent of the original [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]]), dubbed himself the Flash (after his childhood hero in the comic books, Jay Garrick), and became a crimefighter.  In his civilian identity, he stored the costume in his ring, which could eject the compressed clothing when Allen needed it and suck it back in with the aid of a special gas that shrinks the suit.

===Wally West===
{{main|Wally West}}
Wally West was the nephew of Iris West and Barry Allen by marriage, and was introduced in ''The Flash'' (1st series) #110 (1959).  When West was about ten years old, he was visiting his uncle's [[police]] laboratory, and the freak accident that gave Allen his powers repeated itself, bathing West in electrically charged chemicals.  Now possessing the same powers as his uncle, West donned a copy of his uncle's outfit and became the young crimefighter '''Kid Flash'''.  After the events of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', where Barry Allen was killed, Wally took over as the fastest man alive.  Following the events of ''Infinite Crisis'', Wally, his wife Linda, and their twins left Earth for an unknown dimension.

=== Bart Allen===
{{main|Bart Allen}}

[[Image:New_flashl.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Bart Allen as the latest Flash. Variant cover to "The Flash: The Fastest Man Alive" #1.  Art by [[Andy Kubert]] & [[Joe Kubert]].]]
Bart Allen was the grandson of Barry Allen and his wife Iris.  Bart suffered from accelerated aging and, as a result, was raised in a virtual reality machine until Iris took him back in time in order to get help from the then current Flash, Wally West.  With Wally's help, Bart's aging slowed and he took the name '''Impulse'''.  After his kneecap was shot while working with the Teen Titans, Bart changed both his attitude and his costume, taking the mantle of '''Kid Flash'''. During the events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', the Speed Force vanished, taking with it all the speedsters save Jay Garrick. Bart returned, four years older, and for a year claimed that he was depowered from the event.  However the Speed Force had not disappeared completely, and was absorbed into Bart's body, making it such that Bart contains all of the Speed Force. Bart's costume is Barry Allen's Flash suit.

==Powers and abilities==
All incarnations of the Flash can move, think, and react at superhuman speeds.  All possess an aura that prevents air friction from affecting their bodies and clothes while moving.

Barry Allen was believed to be the fastest of all known Flashes, and was known to have travelled faster than the "speed of thought".  However, when Barry Allen pushed himself further (while imploding the [[Anti-Monitor]]'s chief weapon during the ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'') he appeared to waste away as he was converted into pure speed energy, travelled back in time, and was revealed to be the very bolt of lightning that gave him his powers.  Barry Allen possessed several other abilities that Jay Garrick and Wally West have not always been able to duplicate.  He could run on thick snow clouds.  Most unusual was Allen's complete control of his molecules, allowing him to vibrate through solid matter and, on one occasion when transformed into a mirror, "melt" himself and reform as a human to defeat his foe the [[Mirror Master]].
[[Image:FlashFamily01.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Cover to ''Flash'' #208 (2004), featuring Wally West, Jay Garrick and Bart Allen as Kid Flash.  Art by [[Michael Turner (artist)|Michael Turner]].]]
Wally West has said more than once that Barry Allen was the Flash most experienced with time travel.  However, Wally has been shown to have a connection to the [[Speed Force]], an extradimensional energy source, which provides his powers and gives him several other abilities.  While all speedsters are powered by the force, West mainlines the power from the force itself and cannot be cut off from the source, unlike the others.  Wally has, on several occasions, sped faster than light and been pulled into and exited the Speed Force by his own volition.  He can create his costume out of pure speed energy, and can either impart his high velocities to other people and objects already in motion or steal the velocity they possess.  Jay Garrick also possesses this ability to some degree; he stole speed from [[Black Adam]] in order to defeat the villainous [[Johnny Sorrow]], and he has threatened to steal [[Bart Allen]]'s (formerly Impulse and Kid Flash II, now the new Flash) speed on at least one occasion when he was misbehaving.  West can vibrate through objects; in the past, West would cause whatever he vibrated through to explode, but has recently shown this to be a controlled ability as he can pass through objects without any ensuing explosion.  Although not nearly as precise as Allen when he used his cosmic treadmill, West has shown to be able to traverse time and dimensions with his own powers, like Allen in ''Showcase'' #4 in 1956.  However, Wally now accelerates to the point that he is skirting the very edge of the Speed Force dimension, and can traverse along the timestream to specific points as they become visible, much like watching a movie in fast forward or reverse (however he must have a particular speedster's vibratory signature to search for and lock onto, or be very familiar with the vibration of that time period). 

Occasionally, the top speeds of the Flashes are [[light speed]], although Barry Allen and Wally West have been shown to have sped faster than light (as mentioned previously).  On several occasions, the Flash has been shown in various races against [[Superman]] to determine which one is faster (or as part of a mutual effort to thwart some type of threat); these races, however, often resulted in ties (or indeterminate results).  However, in recent races between Wally and Superman, West has been shown to be the faster of the two.  It should, however, be noted that the Silver Age Superman was much faster than the current one.

Speedsters may at times use the ability to speed-read at incredible rates and in doing so, process vast amounts of information.  Whatever knowledge they acquire in this manner is usually temporary (the [[Bart Allen|current Flash]] seems to be the exception, though in earlier years, Max Mercury believed that Bart's speed learning would not stick).

Flashes and other super-speedsters also have the ability to speak to one another at a highly accelerated rate.  This is often done to have private conversations in front of non-fast people (as when Flash speaks to Superman about his ability to serve both the [[Titans (comics)|Titans]] and the JLA in ''The Titans'' #2). Speed-talking is also sometimes used for comedic effect where Flash becomes so excited that he begins talking faster and faster until his words become a jumble of noise (Wally West once became so surprised that he generated a small sonic boom with his voice).

==Awards==
The comics and characters have been nominated for and won several awards over the years, including:
* ''1961 Alley Award for Best Cover'' (''Flash'' #123)
* ''1961 Alley Award for Best Single Comic'' (''Flash'' #123 by [[Gardner Fox]] and [[Carmine Infantino]])
* ''1963 Alley Award for Cross-Over of DC Heroes'' for ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' (with [[Hawkman]])
* ''1964 Alley Award for Best Short Story'' ("Doorway to the Unknown" in ''Flash'' #148 by [[John Broome (writer)|John Broome]] and [[Carmine Infantino]]).

==Appearances in other media==
===Early animated appearances===
A version of the Flash guest-starred in the animated series, ''The Adventures of Aquaman'' in 1968. Flash appeared off and on in the ''[[Super Friends]]'' series throughout its run from 1973 to 1985. Flash appeared in [[Challenge Of The SuperFriends]], [[Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show]], and [[The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians]]. 

In 1977 he appeared in the live-action ''[[Legends of the Superheroes]]'' specials, played by actor [[Rod Haase]].

===The Flash 1990 series===
{{main|The Flash (TV series)}}
''[[The Flash (TV series)|The Flash]]'' was a live action [[CBS]] television series that starred [[John Wesley Shipp]] and [[Amanda Pays]].  The Flash featured in the series was an amalgamation of the silver-age Flash, Barry Allen, and the modern-age Wally West.  The only resemblances between the TV Barry Allen Flash and the comic book Barry Allen Flash were his name, his profession as a forensic scientist, and his love interest Iris (who is very short lived as a love interest in the television series).  Most of the elements in the television show were taken directly from the main story line in the first Wally West Flash comic books: The STAR labs researcher [[Tina McGee]], her and her husband's research into speed, her husband's allegedly fatal accident with their speed research, the Flash's ravenous appetite, heat problems (which were mitigated by the TV show Flash suit), and speed limit on the order of the speed of sound were all elements from the main Wally West comic book storyline.  

The Flash's most famous villain in the series was the [[Trickster (comics)|Trickster]], played by [[Mark Hamill]], which oddly foreshadowed Hamill's subsequent success at voicing the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' and, later, the [[Trickster (comics)|Trickster]] in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' .  [[Captain Cold]], played by Michael Champion, and [[Mirror Master]], played by [[David Cassidy]], also appeared in their own episodes.  The complete series was released as a DVD set by Warner Bros. in 2006.

===Justice League of America pilot===
The Flash was in a [[CBS]] live-action pilot called ''Justice League of America'', portrayed by [[Kenny Johnston]].  The pilot did not air in the United States.

===DC Animated Universe===
The Flash appeared in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Charlie Schlatter]], in the second-season episode "Speed Demons".  As in the traditional comic book storylines, the Flash and Superman race to find out who is faster, but the [[Weather Wizard]] gets in the way, which causes the two to work together.  He also appears in Batman Gotham Adventures #25 due to a theft in Central City leading him to Gotham.

The Flash in the [[Justice League (animated series)|''Justice League'' animated series]] is voiced by [[Michael Rosenbaum]] ([[Lex Luthor]] on the [[television series]] ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'').  This Flash is Wally West; however he is an [[wikt:amalgamation|amalgamation]] of Barry Allen and Wally (in ''Justice League Unlimited'', Wally is a [[forensic scientist]], which was Barry's profession.  Wally in the comics is an [[auto mechanic]].)  Michael Rosenbaum also voiced [[Kid Flash]] for a Fall 2005 episode of [[Teen Titans (animated series)|''Teen Titans'' animated series]] entitled "Lightspeed".  He later appeared in a cameo in the episode "Calling all Titans" and then he reappeared fully in the episode "Titans Together".

Some fans criticized the ''Justice League'' animated series characterization of the Flash, mainly due to the chauvinistic dialogue in early episodes.  However, others argued that he provided a needed foil to the other characters; his humorous attitude and setting reflects Silver Age roots.  The importance of the Flash as the "heart" of the Justice League was shown in the episode "A Better World", when his death in an alternate timeline triggered a series of events which turned that alternate League (the "[[Justice Lords]]") into virtual dictators of Earth.  He has also proven key in saving the day in a few episodes, such as ''Divided We Fall'', in which he defeated the fused [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]]/[[Lex Luthor]] when all the other six founding Justice League members could not.  In the process, he was drawn into the [[Speed Force]] (the first explicit use of the concept in the DCAU), and barely managed to escape.  The episode ''Flash and Substance'' is centered on the opening of the [[Flash Museum]].  Many of the Flash's rogues make cameos in this episode, while focusing on [[Captain Boomerang]], [[Mirror Master]], [[Captain Cold]], and [[Trickster (comics)|The Trickster]] (voiced by [[Mark Hamill]]).  [[Linda Park (comics)|Linda Park]] also appears as a reporter covering the museum opening.

===Smallville===
[[Image:Smallville-run2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bart Allen]] races Clark Kent in the ''Smallville'' episode "Run".]]

The Flash made a guest appearance in the television series ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'', in the fourth-season episode "[[Smallville_%28Season_4%29#Run|Run]]" (first aired [[October 20]], [[2004 in television|2004]]) played by [[Kyle Gallner]].  He is portrayed as a self-centered teenager who uses his powers for personal gain.  He goes by the name [[Bart Allen]], but is shown to be carrying multiple ID cards also identifying him as Jay Garrick, Barry Allen, and Wally West.  His speed in the episode seemed to surpass Clark Kent's and they apparently became friends towards the end, with allusions being made to forming a "league" one day.  Since in ''Smallville'' Clark Kent has not yet become [[Superman]], it is not clear if this version of The Flash will grow up to become [[Jay Garrick]] (Flash 1), [[Barry Allen]] (Flash 2), [[Wally West]] (Flash 3), [[Bart Allen]] (Flash 4), or some other Flash entirely.

Additionally. Kyle Gallner has been confirmed to reprise his role in the Sixth season episode "[[Smallville_%28Season_6%29#Justice|Justice]]". Although his alternative name might be something other than "The Flash", but instead "Impulse"

===Movie===
{{unreferenced|date=November 2006}}

In December 2004, [[David Goyer]] (writer of the ''[[Blade (movie)|Blade]]'' trilogy and ''[[Batman Begins]]'') announced plans to write and direct a major motion picture about The Flash. There are rumors that [[Ryan Reynolds]] will play The Flash, but very little since has been announced.  David Goyer has recently announced that a first draft of the movie's script is in refinement 
stages.

A previous version of the film, titled, "The Flash", was released in the summer of 2002 through Waterworks entertainment and Tuxedo Company Productions. This is an independent production company most famous for the "Blair Witch"-esque docudrama, "Bigfoot" and it's more mainstream sequel, "Sasquatch 2". All three films are known for having failed sequels. "Sasquatch 3" has been in production for nearly 5 years. "The Flash 2" was supposed to be released at the same time as "Sasquatch 3", but was ultimately shelved due to creative differences among the cast and crew. Waterworks entertainment and Tuxedo Company Productions is based in Bloomington, Illinois. The tragedy of these companies is that they are rumored to never move past these three films.

*"The Ballad of Barry Allen" is a song by [[Jim's Big Ego]] featured on ''[[They're Everywhere (album)|They're Everywhere]]'' and released through [[Creative Commons]].  The song portrays Barry Allen's ability to move at super-speed from an alternate viewpoint: namely, that to him the entire world is moving excruciatingly slowly ("I've got time to think / about the beauty of / the thousand variations of / the beating of the wings of / the [[hummingbird]] suspended in / the [[aspic]] of the world / moving slower than molasses, / as I'm off to catch the girl / who's falling off the bridge").  Jim's Big Ego is fronted by Jim Infantino, nephew of legendary Flash artist [[Carmine Infantino]].

Gunn comments: ''"So she did a Barry Allen on us?"'' When the others give him a blank look: ''"Jay Garrick? Wally We... .  She was moving really fast."''

*Beginning with the 1980-1981 season of ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard]]'', [[Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane]] owns a slow-looking basset hound which he called "Flash".

While the Flash had a number of speedy predecessors in mythology, he was the first super-speed hero in comic books.

==Rogues==
{{main|Rogues (comics)}}
Like [[Batman]], the Flash has a reputation for having fought a distinctive and memorable [[rogues gallery]] of supervillains.  In the Flash's case, some of these villains have adopted the term "Flash's Rogues Gallery" as an official title, and insist on being called "Rogues" rather than "supervillains" or similar names.  At times, various combinations of the Rogues have banded together in order to commit crimes or take revenge on the Flash, usually under the leadership of Captain Cold.
