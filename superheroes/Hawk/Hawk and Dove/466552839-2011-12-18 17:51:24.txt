}}'''Hawk and Dove''' is the moniker given to two superheroes when they team up to fight crime.  Hawk and Dove describes each character's attitude or approach to fighting crime.  The [[hawk]] represents [[aggression]], and the [[dove]] representing [[pacifism]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Hank and Don Hall===<!-- This section is linked from [[List of DC Comics characters: D]] -->
Created by [[Steve Ditko]] and [[Steve Skeates]], brothers '''[[Hank Hall|Hank]]''' and '''Don Hall''' first appeared in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #75 (June 1968).<ref>{{cite book|last=McAvennie|first= Michael|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 130 |quote = Brothers Hank and Don Hall were complete opposites, yet writer/artist Steve Ditko with scripter Steve Skeates made sure the siblings shared a desire to battle injustice as Hawk and Dove.}}</ref> The pair gained their powers of heightened strength and agility from a mysterious voice (later, ''[[Secret Origins]]'' #43 explained the voice was from two [[Lords of Chaos and Order]] who had fallen in love) and fought crime together as Hawk and Dove, despite their diametrically opposed opinions about the use of force. The conservative Hawk (Hank) was hot-headed and reactionary, whereas the liberal Dove (Don) was more thoughtful and reasoned (but prone to indecisiveness). Their father, a judge, displayed more balanced political beliefs and firmly disapproved of [[vigilantism]], not knowing his sons were costumed adventurers.

Their own title, ''The Hawk and the Dove'', ran for six issues from 1968 to 1969. Ditko only plotted the first issue and left after the second. Skeates was unhappy with the direction the book was taking, feeling that Don was being portrayed as an ineffective wimp, rather than a pro-active pacifist.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Ditko by contrast felt that Skeates had turned Hawk into a fool whose answer to every problem was unreasoning violence, compared to the "liberal" Dove, now the only one of the two who made any sense at all.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Ditko had wanted a more balanced approach, showing that both "hawks" and "doves" had valid points.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Skeates would leave after the fourth issue, leaving artist [[Gil Kane]] as writer through the last issue.

After their series ended, they became semi-regulars in the [[Teen Titans]], eventually joining Titans West. Writer Alan Brennert attempted to end their saga in a 1982 issue of ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' where, 12 years later, Hank and Don Hall are now adults coping with their 1960s values in the 1980s. After teaming up with [[Batman]], the mysterious voice revokes Hank and Don's powers, deeming them still immature. This was later intentionally disregarded with a joke (where Don notes everyone says they look older) in ''New Teen Titans'' #50, when it was realized this [[Real time (media)|real time]] aging of Hank and Don would affect the Teen Titans as well.

Dove died in 1985's ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' while saving a young boy being attacked by the [[Anti-Monitor]]'s shadow demons. The creature that killed him came from behind and Hawk was too far away to do anything about it. A statue of Don is part of the [[Titans Tower#Memorial|memorial]] at [[Titans Tower]] in [[San Francisco]]. Hawk continued on his own, but without Dove to restrain him, he became excessively violent to the point where many of the superhero community considered him nearly as much trouble as the supervillains.

They both made a cameo appearance, shown as being old and overweight, in the non-canon graphic novel ''[[The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'' during the popularity of costumed vigilantes. They live on [[Christopher Street (Manhattan)|Christopher Street]]; Hawk is asking Dove, "We can still squeeze into the tights. What do you say, partner? Ready for action? It's all the rage." Dove responds, "But, Haank! Back then, all we did was argue!" A caption above them read, "The Hawk and the Dove - don't ask..." (the obvious implication being that both are homosexual).

===Hank Hall and Dawn Granger===<!-- This section is linked from [[List of DC Comics characters: D]] -->
[[Image:Hawk and Dove2.jpg|175px|thumb|Hawk and Dove: Hank and Dawn. Artwork by [[Rob Liefeld]].]]
In 1988, a new ''Hawk and Dove'' mini-series written by [[Karl Kesel|Karl]] and [[Barbara Kesel]] reintroduced Hawk and Dove. This series introduced a woman named '''Dawn Granger''' as the second Dove. The new Dove mysteriously received her powers while attempting to save her mother from terrorists. At the end of the mini-series, it was revealed that Dawn received her powers the moment Don had been stripped of them. This Dove, while considerably more aggressive and self-confident than Don, also has greater-than-average strength and dexterity, faster-than-human speed, and expanded mental capabilities. Dove fights mostly defensively, preferring to out-think and remain in control of her opponent. Like Hawk, she also heals incredibly quickly and cannot revert to Dawn if her wounds or some other condition would be fatal to Dawn. It was later revealed that Hawk and Dove become beings that are direct conduits of the respective planes of Chaos and Order.

Set in [[Washington, D.C.]] (where the duo attended [[Georgetown University]]), the series introduced several supporting characters, including Hank's girlfriend, Ren Takamori, and friends Kyle Spenser and Donna Cabot. They also worked with police Captain Brian "Sal" Arsala, who would develop a mutual admiration with Dawn. It also introduced Kestrel, an evil spell created by M'Shulla, and Barter, owner of Barter Trading: Exotic Goods and Services.

[[Image:Hawk and Dove 15.jpg|175px|thumb|left|Hawk and Dove's true forms.]]
 
In issues #14-17 of the ongoing series, Kestrel, in the body of Ren Takamori, lured Hawk and Dove to the mystical land of Druspa Tau — also home to the Lords of Chaos and Order. Hawk and Dove cut a deal with Barter to transverse dimensions to Druspa Tau. There, the two were able to remove their costumes, revealing their true forms, and found their abilities were heightened exponentially. They arrived as a war was brewing between M'Shulla, the Lord of Chaos, and followers of Arriya, the Lord of Order. Finding themselves on opposite sides, Hawk and Dove were forced to do battle. M'Shulla tells a captive Rome that he cast a spell long ago, and that Arriya is not the name of Druspa Tau's former Order goddess. No one knows her true name any longer, and therefore she cannot return to Druspa Tau. Just as M'Shulla is about to claim final victory, Barter tells Rome the true name of the world's Lord of Order: Terataya. Her name is spoken and a dragon wearing an amulet appears. The dragon/amulet is a combined being: Terataya, Lord of Order, and T'Charr, Lord of Chaos, and is now called the Unity. The Unity is unable to sustain the fight with M'Shulla, because it is maintaining the Hawk and Dove spell at the same time. M'Shulla deals the Unity a fatal blow and it retreats to a hidden cave.

Dove is able to use her logical powers to see how the Kestrel demon is attached to Ren, and then separate them. Hawk then absorbs the Kestrel force (as it is part of Chaos, and Hawk is one with the primal source of Chaos while on Druspa Tau), effectively annihilating it and freeing Ren. Hawk and Dove then fly off to find the Unity, leaving Ren behind. In the cave where the Unity hides, Hawk and Dove find their creators, T'Charr and Terataya, dying. The Unity explains that it created Hawk and Dove to prove to the other Lords of Chaos and Order that the two forces could work together. It did this because T'Charr and Terataya are in love and have been hunted by their respective houses ever since. However, because they are dying, Hawk and Dove must absorb the essence of their respective creators. This merging gave both Hawk and Dove enhanced powers, but it meant there would be no new Hawk or Dove if either of the current heroes died. Hawk and Dove also learned their abilities were upgraded: Dove could fly, and Hawk was stronger and bulletproof.

====''Armageddon 2001'' and ''Zero Hour'' and JSA====
In 1991, in an editorial snafu concerning the mini-series ''[[Armageddon 2001]]'', word leaked out that the central time-travelling villain of the piece (known as [[Monarch (comics)|Monarch]]) was actually [[Captain Atom]]. Monarch had originally been conceived as a future identity of Captain Atom (post-psychotic break). [[Waverider (comics)|Waverider]] had even "checked" Hawk's future in ''Hawk and Dove Annual'' #2, which had them fighting Monarch, eliminating them as possible candidates. In a last-ditch effort to provide a "surprise twist", DC changed the storyline. Sales of ''Hawk and Dove'' had dipped and the series was slotted for cancellation, so Monarch's identity was revealed as the future Hank Hall. Monarch attacked Hawk and Dove and managed to murder Dawn in front of Hank, causing him to suffer the psychotic break, kill Monarch, and assume the villainous identity. He briefly became a recurring foe for Captain Atom before absorbing Waverider's time-travel powers, subsequently changing his form and name to Extant in ''[[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time|Zero Hour]]''. As Extant, Hawk murdered several members of the [[Justice Society of America]]; during a rematch however, [[Albert Rothstein|Atom Smasher]] used the [[New Gods|New God]] [[Metron (comics)|Metron]]'s mobius chair to transfer Hall onto a doomed plane in place of the Atom Smasher's mother which exploded due to the terrorist actions of Kobra.  Despite his crimes and lives taken by him, a statue of him is present in the Titans Tower memorial in San Francisco.

In ''JSA'', Dove's apparent death and Hawk's turning evil was revealed to be part of a larger plan by the evil sorcerer, [[Mordru]]. Exiled outside time and space, Mordru exploited Captain Atom and Waverider to create a gateway back to Earth and assumed the form of Waverider's nemesis Monarch. Mordru (as Monarch) then kidnapped Hawk and Dove, killing Dove's boyfriend and putting her into a comatose state drove Hawk insane with false memories of "Monarch" killing Dove and being killed by Hawk, who's face was behind the Monarch mask. Having gained control over Hawk, he ordered his newfound pawn to have sex with the unconscious Dove in order to create a child that would be destined to become the new Doctor Fate. Hawk was then given a new suit of armor similar to that of Monarch and sent off to fight the JLA and ultimately become Extant. Dove would be placed in a Canadian hospital, with several glamor spells cast upon her, making her look like a runaway and later Lyta Hall while her lengthy magical pregnancy played out. The child she gave birth to was aged to adulthood and turned out to be a reincarnated version of Hawkman's son Hector Hall, aka the Silver Scarab. Hector would ultimately reverse the sleeping spell, reviving Dove.  

In ''Teen Titans'' vol. 3, #31, Hank and Don Hall reappear as [[zombie]]s, brought back to life by [[Brother Blood]], who was freed as a result of the events of ''[[Day of Vengeance]]''.

===A new Hawk and Dove===
[[Image:Hawkanddove3.JPG|thumb|175px|right|Hawk and Dove: Sasha and Wiley.]]
Another Hawk ('''Sasha Martens''') and Dove ('''Wiley Wolverman''') appeared in a 5-issue mini-series in 1997, written by [[Mike Baron]]. In this version, completely unrelated to the concept of the Lords of Chaos and Order, the duo's conflicting personalities manifested as "[[military brat]]" and "slacker dude," respectively. They gained large bird wings and a telepathic link by receiving experimental medical treatments as children. Following the mini-series, the new Hawk and Dove made a handful of cameo appearances in Titans-related books, once protecting the town of Woodstock, New York, during a worldwide crisis.

===Holly and Dawn Granger===<!-- This section is linked from [[List of DC Comics characters: H]] -->
[[File:Hawkdove4.jpg|thumb|175px|left|Hawk and Dove: Holly and Dawn. Art by Mike McKone.]]
In 2003, ''JSA'' #45-50 told of a mysterious woman in a coma who was taken into the care of the Justice Society. Initially thought to be the comatose body of [[Hector Hall]]'s missing wife, [[Fury (DC Comics)|Hippolyta Trevor]], the woman was revealed to be none other than the presumed-dead Dawn Granger. Dawn's "death" was revealed to be a hoax orchestrated by the villain Mordru, who was also revealed to have caused Hank's insanity. Dawn later gained a new partner when her estranged and aggressive British sister, '''Holly Granger''', was granted the mystical powers of Chaos, becoming the third Hawk. Holly's first appearance was in ''Teen Titans'' vol. 3, #22-23, joining her sister and many other former Titans against a newly evil [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Dr. Light]]. The duo later re-teamed with the Titans to rescue [[Raven (comics)|Raven]]'s "soul self" from their old nemesis, Kestrel.

In the ''Day of Vengeance'' [[limited series]], the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] attacks and apparently destroys T'Charr and Terataya (who apparently were temporarily no longer dead), leaving Hawk and Dove supposedly powerless. Despite this, however, Hawk and Dove were shown during a worldwide prison break, being contacted telepathically by [[Martian Manhunter|J'onn J'onzz]]. Both were in costume, and Dove was carrying Hawk while flying, possibly implying that T'Charr and Terataya were somehow restored to life after Earth entered the Tenth Age of Magic. 

Hawk and Dove also appeared in ''[[Countdown to Mystery]]'', in which Dawn Granger is one of a number of heroes possessed by [[Eclipso]]. In ''Teen Titans'' vol. 3, #34 (post-''[[Infinite Crisis]]''), Holly and Dawn are shown in Titans Tower sometime during the [[52 (comics)|previous year]], with dialogue from Hawk implying that they were at the time members of the Teen Titans. Their association with the team was temporary, though they resurfaced in the ''[[Titans East]] Special'' as part of a new team organized by [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]]. The sisters were both shot by energy beams from [[Trigon (comics)|Trigon]] and were left for dead. Later events showed they were badly injured but had survived the experience.<ref>Titans vol. 2, #1 (June 2008)</ref>

===''Blackest Night''===
{{Main|Blackest Night}}
In ''Blackest Night'' #2, multiple [[Power ring (DC Comics)#Black|black power rings]] attempt to reanimate the body of Don Hall, only to be prevented from disturbing his grave by an invisible barrier. As they collide with the barrier, the rings' typical command ("rise") is interrupted; the rings instead respond, "Don Hall of Earth at peace." This is the first depiction of the black power rings failing to recruit a member for the [[Black Lantern Corps]].<ref name="bn2">''Blackest Night'' #2 (October 2009)</ref> In an interview with [[IGN]], [[Geoff Johns]] provides an explanation behind Dove's immunity to the black power rings: "You'll learn more about this as we go forward. But really it speaks to the nature of Don Hall. He can't be desecrated by the likes of these things. He's untouchable in death and at total peace more than any other being in the universe." Reflecting on the limitations of the rings, Johns goes on to state that, even though magic is a "joke" to the black power rings, Don is quite the opposite.<ref name="inside2">{{Cite web | url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/101/1014315p1.html | title=Geoff Johns: Inside Blackest Night - Part Two | work=[[IGN]] | date=August 14, 2009}}</ref> Though Don rejects the black rings, his brother Hank's corpse accepts his with humor: "Same old, same old, huh, bro? Hawk's got to do all the dirty work himself."<ref name="bn2"/>

In ''Blackest Night: Titans'' #1, Hank lures Holly and Dawn to a library with a trail of dead hawks and doves. As Hank attacks, Dawn claims he is not what he says he is; pointing out that the real Hank would know that she is almost impossible to hit. Hank is also unable to read Dawn's emotions, her aura depicted as being white rather than a color from the [[emotional spectrum]]. Holly is not able to confront Hank as deftly, the issue concluding with him plunging his hand into her left breast to remove her heart.<ref name="bnt1">''Blackest Night: Titans'' #1 (October 2009)</ref> A black ring then claims Holly's body. The two Black Lantern Hawks prove too much for Dawn and she retreats, with the two giving chase.<ref>''Blackest Night: Titans'' #2 (November 2009)</ref>

Dove goes to Titans Tower, only to find it under attack by more Black Lantern Titans. Holly and Hank catch up to her and resume their attack. When Holly attempts to rip out Dawn's heart, a blast of white energy radiates from her body, severing the connection between Holly and the ring. Dawn then turns the light on the other Black Lanterns, destroying all but Black Lanterns [[Terra (comics)|Terra]], [[Garth (comics)|Tempest]], and Hank. The effort causes Dawn to pass out. While unconscious, she has a vision of Don, who tells her that she can save Hank, and to not give up on him.<ref name="bnt3">''Blackest Night: Titans'' #3 (December 2009)</ref>

Dawn, along with the rest of the Titans, joins the [[Justice League]] in battling the Black Lanterns at [[Coast City]]. She is able to destroy Black Lanterns with her very presence. The [[Flash (Barry Allen)]] witnesses Dawn's fight with the undead army and realises that she possesses the "white light of creation" as mentioned by Indigo-1 (a member from the [[Indigo Tribe]]), a power believed to be created by the combined seven powers of the emotional spectrum. The Flash then orders every hero nearby to protect her at all cost, believing that she could be the key to their victory against the Black Lanterns.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #3 (November 2009)</ref><ref>''Blackest Night'' #5 (January 2010)</ref> During the battle, Dove's white energies are pulled away from her, right into the Black Lanterns' central power battery, under the auspices of the being trapped inside.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #7 (February 2010)</ref> The being is eventually revealed to be the villainous [[Anti-Monitor]], who was missing after the ''[[Sinestro Corps War]]''. Dove aids the seven Corps members to defeat the cosmic entity before resuming their battle with the Black Lantern Corps.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' vol. 2, #46 (March 2010)</ref> In the aftermath of the final battle, Hank is brought back to life by the power of the white light.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #8 (March 2010)</ref> Memorial statues are created for Holly and Tempest.<ref>''Titans'' vol. 2, #23 (March 2010)</ref>

===''Brightest Day''===
{{Main|Brightest Day}}
Dawn starts to worry about Hank's behavior after he was resurrected, as he has become more violent than he had been prior to his death.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #0 (April 2010)</ref> Later she bumps into [[Deadman]] when he accidentally teleports into her room while she is sleeping. After introducing himself, Hawk comes crashing in and holds him against a wall. Deadman tells his story of what happened so far and Hawk comes up with an idea to try to resurrect Don.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #4 (June 2010)</ref> However, that attempt failed as Don told Deadman he is at peace. Dawn then suggests that he try reviving Holly instead.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #5 (July 2010)</ref>

They are shown a horrific illusion of Holly rising as a Black Lantern, before realizing none of it is real. The voice guiding Deadman simply indicates death no longer holds the same meaning.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #6 (July 2010)</ref> After they eat, Hank, Dawn, and Deadman are transported to [[Silver City, New Mexico]], where they find the White Lantern power battery in a crater. Unbeknownst to Dawn and the others, the encounter in the crater is witnessed by [[Aqualad (Jackson Hyde)|Jackson Hyde]]. When Deadman questions the white battery as to why they were all brought back to life, the [[White Lantern Corps|Entity]] tells them that it is dying and requires a successor. The Entity also tells Hawk to save Dawn from [[Captain Boomerang]] (although the fact that it also told Boomerang to attack Dawn in the first place suggests a long-term plan that is currently unknown).<ref>''Brightest Day'' #7 (August 2010)</ref> When asking why Dove needs to be protected, the Entity said they all need protection. Dove unintentionally went with Deadman to see [[Hal Jordan]].<ref>''Brightest Day'' #8 (August 2010)</ref> However, they transported to [[Aquaman]] and Mera instead, the Entity telling that Deadman wished to go swimming.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #9 (September 2010)</ref>

Dove and Deadman travel to [[Gotham City]], where Dove shows Deadman pictures of superheroes to find the perfect candidate to take the Entity's place.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #12 (October 2010)</ref> Dove called [[Resurrection Man]]; however, Deadman tells them he is not the chosen one since his ring has not made any movement. Later, Deadman, believing [[Batman]] to be the perfect candidate,<ref>''Brightest Day'' #13 (November 2010)</ref> tries to give the ring to him, but the ring rejects Batman and returns to Deadman, who is shot to death. During this time, the ring again talks to Deadman and offers him the chance to return to life if he embraces it. Deadman accepts and is suddenly returned to the living. After this, Dove and Deadman realize they are in love with each other.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #14 (November 2010)</ref> Deadman has since moved into Dove's apartment.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #17 (January 2011)</ref>

Around this same time period, Dawn and Hank are recruited into the [[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]] by [[Zinda Blake]] while in Gotham to stop some teenaged supervillains. Immediately after their meeting with Zinda, the two are called in by [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]] to rescue [[Black Canary]] and the [[Huntress (Helena Bertinelli)|Huntress]] from a villainess calling herself White Canary.<ref>''Birds of Prey'' vol. 2 #1-2 (July–August 2010)</ref> Dove also appears as part of [[Wonder Woman]]'s all-female superteam in ''Wonder Woman'' #600.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/files/2010/06/ww_600_no_ads-3-copy.jpg | title=Image of Wonder Woman's all-female superteam | work=DC Comics.com}}</ref>

Later as the "dark avatar" made his presence known, Hawk and Dove are transported to the Star City forest by the Entity, where it tells them that they must protect the forest and withstand the ultimate saviour, which is [[Swamp Thing|Alec Holland]].<ref>''Brightest Day'' #23 (April 2011)</ref> Within the forest, Captain Boomerang finds Dawn and throws a boomerang at her. Hawk; however, fails to catch the boomerang and instead the boomerang is caught by Deadman, who ended up dying in the process and Hawk is left to knock Captain Boomerang unconscious. After the Dark Avatar is defeated, the Entity reveals to them that the boomerang was a part a plan to free Hawk from his role as an avatar of war from the Lords of Chaos: his act of saving Dawn would have broken hold the Lords of Chaos have on Hawk and allow Hank to be true to himself. With Hawk's failure in his task, Dawn, who had grown to love Boston Brand, is heartbroken. She and Brand share an emotional farewell as Brand resumes his duties as "Deadman".<ref>''Brightest Day'' #24 (April 2011)</ref>

===Relaunch===
DC Comics has relaunched this title as part of their company-wide [[The New 52|reboot]] of their 52 major titles. It was released on September 7, 2011, written by [[Sterling Gates]] and art by [[Rob Liefeld]].

In this new series, Hank and Dawn resume their superhero activities in Washington, DC, with some assistance from [[Deadman]]. However, they also encounter Condor and Swan, a new pair of supervillains who possess superpowers similar to theirs. Hawk and Dove fight Condor and Swan after they try to kill President [[Barack Obama|Obama]] and Hank's father. Swan escapes, but Hank and Dove manage to defeat Condor, who is revealed to be an old man.

In the new continuity, Dawn Granger also has a tenuous romantic relationship with Deadman, and has appeared in the team comic ''[[Justice League Dark]]''.

==Powers and abilities==
===Dove===
Dove possesses an ability known as danger sense transformation. When in the presence of danger, whether to herself or others, Dawn Granger can call out the word "Dove" and be transformed into her Dove form. She does not need to be aware of the danger for the transformation to take place, meaning she could transform if she happened to say the word while unknowingly being in danger. However, the transformation only reacts to actual danger, so if Dawn incorrectly believed that she was in danger (such as when Barter abducted her), she would be unable to transform into Dove.

The transformation wears off a short time after the danger has passed unless Dove has received serious injuries that would kill Dawn, in which case she would remain as Dove until the danger from the injuries has passed. It is unknown how close to the danger she needs to be to transform. Hank once went around a number of warehouses to find which was being used as a hideout for some criminals, saying "Hawk" outside each until he changed. On high magic worlds, she can remain as Dove for extended periods regardless of whether there is any danger present.

The transformation changes Granger into a minor force of Order and she gains some brilliant avian physical characteristics, which are usually hidden under her costume. The costume is normally irremovable while on Earth, but if it receives sufficient damage, it can tear and reveal part of her true form, which shines with the light of Order, emitting a constant golden glow. Within realms with higher levels of magic, Dove can easily remove the costume and show her true form.

Dove is also hypervigilant; her natural aptitudes are enhanced, such as her ability as a good judge of people and, in some situations, allowing her to read people and objects within seconds, and know how they will act and react. In addition to flight, she also has enhanced agility, durability (can withstand a great deal of physical punishment and heal quickly), and perception (her perception becomes so great that she becomes aware of most things within the realm).

Due to her connection with Terataya, on high magic worlds her powers are enhanced. She can concentrate her radiance into a blinding beam of light. She also possesses the White Light of Creation. It is unknown whether this power is an extension of her radiance ability, but during the ''Blackest Night'' crisis, Dove was able to channel this particular force and destroy Black Lanterns as well as block a Black Lantern's aura reading power. How and why Dawn was chosen for this power, or whether it has anything to do with her link to Terataya, remains unknown.

===Hawk===
Hawk possesses the powers of Chaos, superhuman strength, speed, stamina, invulnerability and claws.

==In other media==
[[Image:Hawkanddove.JPG|right|175px|thumb|The original Hawk and Dove as depicted in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''.]]
* Animated versions of Hawk and Dove (Hank and Don Hall) were featured alongside [[Wonder Woman]] in an episode of ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' titled "Hawk and Dove", voiced by [[Jason Hervey]] and [[Fred Savage]] (both of whom starred in the television series ''[[The Wonder Years]]'' as brothers Wayne and Kevin Arnold). This version of the duo depicts a stronger relationship between the brothers. Don is more self-confident, and their philosophical bickering is more like a brotherly teasing. Ironically, there is a role reversal: Fred Savage (who played nerdy Kevin) voices the violent Hawk, while Hervey (who played the bully Wayne) voices the pacifist Dove. They were originally to have voiced their more obvious roles, but tried switching during rehearsals, to the approval of the director. In this episode, their fighting styles were thoroughly contrasted. Hawk employs brute-force, aggressive tactics, at times resembling a [[American football|football]] player. Dove, on the other hand, uses a blend of techniques reminiscent of [[aikido]] or perhaps [[judo]], using his attacker's movements to fling them aside. Wonder Woman enlisted them to help stop [[Ares (DC Comics)|Ares]] from causing war in [[Kaznia]]. They are successful due to Dove's peaceful resistance against the rage-powered Annihilator. This episode is another example of how close the two are, as Hawk struggles against Wonder Woman in an attempt to protect his brother. They are last seen in the series finale, "Destroyer", where they fight off [[Parademon]]s alongside several other League members. They later appear in the final scene running down the steps of the Metro Tower with the rest of the League. Fittingly enough, both in that fight scene and as they exit in the finale of the episode, they appear along with fellow Steve Ditko creations the [[Question (comics)|Question]], the [[Creeper (comics)|Creeper]], and [[Captain Atom]].

* Hawk and Dove appear in the teaser for the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "When [[OMAC (Buddy Blank)|OMAC]] Attacks!", with Hawk voiced by [[Greg Ellis (actor)|Greg Ellis]] and Dove voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]. They help [[Batman]] stop an intergalactic war between two armies (ironically, similarly color-coded red and blue). While Hawk and Dove take out the ground forces, Dove claims that it is better to settle things diplomatically, while Hawk says that they have to hurt them or they will never stop. Regardless, Batman gets the two sides' leaders to sign the peace treaty and end the war. Hawk and Dove do manage to embarrass themselves, their bickering causing them to fight in front of the leaders. Batman invites the leaders to have a drink in his ship to draw their attention from the bickering brothers. They also briefly appear as heroes who were taken over by [[Starro]] in the two-part episode "The Siege of Starro!" After Starro's defeat, Hawk and Dove are transformed back to normal.
