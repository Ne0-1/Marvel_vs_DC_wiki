'''Hawk and Dove''' are the titles of a number of [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]] duos who fight crime together despite the partners' typically sharply differing methods and attitudes about [[violence]].  This difference is signified by the bird [[iconography]] of the [[hawk]] typically representing [[aggression]] and the [[dove]] representing [[pacifism]].

'''The Hawk and the Dove''' are a duo of [[comic book]] [[superhero]]es created by [[Steve Ditko]] and [[Steve Skeates]]. They were a pair of brothers, Hank and Don Hall, who fought crime together despite their diametrically opposed opinions about the use of force. Hawk (Hank) was hot-headed and reactionary whereas Dove (Don) was more thoughtful and reasoned, but prone to indecisiveness. Their powers, gained from a mysterious voice, were essentially heightened strength and agility. Their father, Judge Hall, had a personality and political opinions midway between his sons, but firmly disapproved of [[vigilantism]].

They first appeared in ''Showcase'' #75 and their own title, ''The Hawk and the Dove'', ran for six issues from [[1968]] to [[1969]]. Skeates was reportedly unhappy with the direction the book was taking, feeling that Don was being portrayed as an ineffective wimp, rather than a pro-active [[pacifism|pacifist]].

After their series ended they became semi-regulars in [[Teen Titans]], eventually joining Titans West. The Dove was killed in ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''.  Hawk continued on his own, but without Dove to restrain him he became excessively violent to the point where many of the superhero community considered him nearly as much trouble as the supervillains.

In [[1988]], a new ''Hawk and Dove'' mini-series written by [[Karl Kesel|Karl]] and [[Barbara Kesel]] revealed that they gained their powers from the Lords of Chaos (Hawk) and the Lords of Order (Dove). The Lords of Order gave the powers of Dove to a woman named Dawn Granger, who Hawk, reluctantly, teamed up with. This Dove, while considerably more aggressive and self confident than Don, had the additional inate power to instantly and completely assess a combat situation which enabled her resolve it in a manner that minimized the need of force on her part.  This new team appeared in  an ongoing series that ran for 28 issues from [[1989]] to [[1991]].

In 1991, the ending of the ''[[Armageddon 2001]]'' crossover was changed at the last minute. The time-travelling villain [[Monarch (comics)|Monarch]], who had originally been written as a future identity of [[Captain Atom]]-post-psychosis, was now portrayed as the future identity of Hawk (one of the only two characters who had been ''proven'' to not be Monarch). Monarch killed Dawn (the other character who had been proven to not be Monarch) in front of Hawk, causing Hawk to suffer a psychotic break, kill  Monarch, and take his identity. He briefly became a recurring foe for [[Captain Atom]], before changing his name to [[Extant]] in ''[[Zero Hour]]''.

Recently, Dawn Granger has been ressurected and returned to the role of Dove. It is not known if a new Hawk is to be accompanying her.

Another Hawk and Dove, with no connection to the originals, appeared in a six-issue mini-series in [[1997]], written by [[Mike Baron]]. In this version, the take on the conflicting personalities was that Hawk (Sasha Martens) was a "military brat" and Dove (Wiley Wolverman) a "slacker dude". They gained their powers (large bird wings and a telepathic link) owing to have been given experimental medical treatments as children.

Following the mini-series, the new Hawk and Dove made a handful of cameo appearances in Titans-related books, before seemingly disapearing.

==Justice League Unlimited==

The original Hawk and Dove were featured alongside [[Wonder Woman]] in the episode of ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', "Hawk and Dove".  

This version shows the pair with a stronger relationship, with a more self confidient Dove, whose philosophical bickering is more like a brotherly teasing.  They are voiced by [[Jason Hervey]] and [[Fred Savage]] respectively, both of whom starred in the [[Wonder Years]] as (ironically enough) brothers Wayne and Kevin Arnold.
