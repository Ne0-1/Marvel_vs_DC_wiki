}}'''Hawk and Dove''' is the identity given to brothers '''[[Hank Hall|Hank]]''' and '''Don Hall''' who team up as superheroes  to fight crime.  Each  character's name describes his attitude or approach to fighting crime. [[Hawk]] represents [[aggression]], and [[Dove]] represents [[pacifism]].  Hawk and Dove first appeared in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #75 (June 1968).<ref>{{cite book|last=McAvennie|first= Michael|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 130 |quote = Brothers Hank and Don Hall were complete opposites, yet writer/artist Steve Ditko with scripter Steve Skeates made sure the siblings shared a desire to battle injustice as Hawk and Dove.}}</ref> The pair gained their powers of heightened strength and agility from a mysterious voice. Later, in ''[[Secret Origins]]'' #43, it was explained that the voice was from the [[Lords of Chaos and Order]], who had fallen in love.

Their own series titled, ''The Hawk and the Dove'', ran for six issues from 1968 to 1969. The series was created by [[Steve Ditko]] and [[Steve Skeates]]. Ditko plotted only the first issue and left after the second. Skeates was unhappy with the direction the series was taking, feeling that Don was being portrayed as an ineffective wimp, rather than a pro-active pacifist.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Ditko by contrast felt that Skeates had turned Hawk into a fool whose answer to every problem was unreasoning violence when compared to the "liberal" Dove, now the only one of the two who made any sense at all.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Ditko wanted a balanced approach, showing that both "hawks" and "doves" had valid points.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Skeates left after the fourth issue, leaving artist [[Gil Kane]] as the writer through the last issue.

==Fictional character biography==
===Hank and Don Hall===<!-- This section is linked from [[List of DC Comics characters: D]] -->
The Hall brothers fought crime together as Hawk and Dove, despite their diametrically opposed opinions about the use of force. The conservative Hawk (Hank) was hot-headed and reactionary, whereas the liberal Dove (Don) was more thoughtful and reasoned, but was prone to indecisiveness. Their father, Judge Irwin Hall, displayed a more balanced political beliefs, and firmly disapproved of [[vigilantism]], not knowing his sons were costumed adventurers.

[[File:Hawk&Dove-DitkoV1n1.jpg|left|175px|thumb|''The Hawk and the Dove'' #1 (September 1968). Cover art by [[Steve Ditko]].]]

After their series ended, Hawk and Dove became semi-regulars in the [[Teen Titans]], eventually joining Titans West. Writer Alan Brennert attempted to end their saga in a 1982 issue of ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' where 12 years later Hank and Don Hall, then adults, are trying to cope with their 1960s values in the 1980s.

After Hawk and Dove teamed up with [[Batman]], the mysterious voice revoked Hank and Don's powers, deeming them still immature. This was later intentionally disregarded with a joke (where Don notes everyone says they look older) in ''New Teen Titans'' #50, when it was realized the [[Real time (media)|real time]] aging of Hank and Don would affect the age of the Teen Titans as well.

Dove died in 1985's ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' while saving a young boy who was being attacked by the [[Anti-Monitor]]'s shadow demons. The creature that killed Dove came from behind, and Hawk was too far away to intervene. A statue of Don is part of the [[Titans Tower#Memorial|memorial]] at [[Titans Tower]] in [[San Francisco]]. Hawk continued on his own, but without Dove to restrain him, he became violent to the point where many superheros considered him nearly as much trouble as the supervillains.

Hawk and Dove made a cameo appearance, old and overweight, in the non-canon graphic novel ''[[The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]''. They lived on [[Christopher Street (Manhattan)|Christopher Street]] on Manhattan island. Hawk asked Dove, "We can still squeeze into the tights. What do you say, partner? Ready for action? It's all the rage." Dove responds, "But, Haank! Back then, all we did was argue!" A caption above them read, "The Hawk and the Dove - don't ask..."

In ''Teen Titans'' vol. 3, #31, Hank and Don Hall reappear as [[zombie]]s, brought back to life by [[Brother Blood]], who was freed as a result of the events of ''[[Day of Vengeance]]''.

===Hank Hall and Dawn Granger===<!-- This section is linked from [[List of DC Comics characters: D]] -->

[[File:Hawk and Dove2.jpg|175px|thumb|Hawk and Dove: Hank and Dawn. Artwork by [[Rob Liefeld]].]]

In 1988, a new ''Hawk and Dove'' mini-series written by [[Karl Kesel|Karl]] and [[Barbara Kesel]] reintroduced the brothers.<ref>Manning, Matthew K. "1980s" in Dolan, p. 234: "Written by Barbara and Karl Kesel and drawn by future superstar Rob Liefeld, this five-issue miniseries reestablished the famous pair for a new generation."</ref> This series placed a woman named '''Dawn Granger''' as the  Dove, replacing Don, who had died in the original series. The new Dove mysteriously received her powers while attempting to save her mother from terrorists. At the end of the mini-series, it was revealed that Dawn received her powers the moment Don had been stripped of them.

This Dove, while considerably more aggressive and self-confident than Don, also has greater-than-average strength and dexterity, faster-than-human speed, and expanded mental capabilities. Dove fights mostly defensively, preferring to out-think and remain in control of her opponent. she also heals quickly and cannot revert to Dawn if her wounds or some other condition would be fatal to Dawn.

Set in [[Washington, D.C.]] (where the duo attended [[Georgetown University]]), the series introduced several supporting characters, including Hank's girlfriend, Ren Takamori, and friends Kyle Spenser and Donna Cabot. They also worked with police Captain Brian "Sal" Arsala, who would develop a mutual admiration with Dawn. It also introduced Kestrel, an evil spell created by M'Shulla and Barter, owner of Barter Trading: Exotic Goods and Services.

[[File:Hawk and Dove 15.jpg|175px|thumb|left|Hawk and Dove's true forms.]]

Hawk and Dove are lured to the mystical land of Druspa Tau — the home of the Lords of Chaos and Order - by Kestrel. It is all an effort of M'Shulla to seek out that world's Lords of Order. They are eventually discovered - Terataya, Lord of Order, and T'Charr, Lord of Chaos - in the form of a combined being called Unity. After M'Shulla and Kestrel are defeated (Hawk absorbs Kestrel and effectively destroys him), T'Charr and Terataya reveal they created Hawk and Dove to prove to the other Lords of Chaos and Order that the two forces could work together (and also because they were in love) and then convince Hawk and Dove to absorb the essence of their respective creators. This merging enhances their powers: Dove could fly and was stronger and now bullet proof/energy blast, and Hawk was possed with super strength and super flight as fast as speed of light if angered enough and now has invulnerability and now was considered GOD of Chaos in is capable of absorbing his foes and Heat Vision.<ref>Hawk & Dove Vol.2 #14-17</ref>

=== Hawk's Fall and Redemption: ''Armageddon 2001'', ''Zero Hour'', and JSA===
In 1991, in an editorial snafu concerning the mini-series ''[[Armageddon 2001]]'', word leaked out that the central time-travelling villain of the piece (known as [[Monarch (comics)|Monarch]]) was actually [[Captain Atom]]. Monarch had originally been conceived as a future identity of Captain Atom (post-psychotic break). [[Waverider (comics)|Waverider]] had even "checked" Hawk's future in ''Hawk and Dove Annual'' #2, which had them fighting Monarch, eliminating them as possible candidates. In a last-ditch effort to provide a "surprise twist", DC changed the storyline.

Sales of ''Hawk and Dove'' had dipped and the series was slotted for cancellation, so Monarch's identity was revealed as the future Hank Hall. Monarch attacked Hawk and Dove and managed to murder Dawn in front of Hank, causing him to suffer the psychotic break, kill Monarch, and assume his villainous identity. He briefly became a recurring foe for Captain Atom before absorbing Waverider's time-travel powers, subsequently changing his form and name to Extant in ''[[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time|Zero Hour]]''.

As Extant, Hawk murdered several members of the [[Justice Society of America]]; during a rematch however, [[Albert Rothstein|Atom Smasher]] used the [[New Gods|New God]] [[Metron (comics)|Metron]]'s Mobius Chair to transfer Hall onto a doomed plane in place of the Atom Smasher's mother who exploded due to the terrorist actions of Kobra.  Despite his crimes and the lives taken by him, a statue of him is present in the Titans Tower memorial in San Francisco.

==== Fan criticism ====
In response to fan-criticism of ''[[Armageddon 2001]]'', many of whose readers felt that the character of Hawk had been severely misused in the story's [[Armageddon 2001#Response and last-minute changes|last-minute changes]], DC Comics set about restoring the character as he had originally been intended; a hero. DC had already [[retcon]]ned '''Extant''''s portion of Hank Hall's timeline in issue 14 of ''[[Justice Society of America#JSA_.281999.E2.80.932006.29|JSA]]'', dated September 2000, in which [[Metron (comics)|Metron]] announced his intention to erase the villain's "wretched timeline" with his Mobius Chair. This was the second issue of a 3-part story entitled ''The Hunt for Extant!'', (the details of which are listed above).

After this, DC also revised '''Monarch''''s portion of Hall's timeline with the final issue of the 6-part miniseries [[Blüdhaven|Battle for Blüdhaven]], dated September 2006, which now depicted [[Captain Atom]]'s transformation into Monarch, as had been DC's original intention back in 1991. Hawk was restored, but he would not be revived until the final issue of ''[[Blackest Night]]'', (see below).

[[File:Hawkanddove3.JPG|thumb|175px|right|Hawk and Dove: Sasha and Wiley.]]

===Sasha Martens and Wiley Wolverman===
Another Hawk ('''Sasha Martens''') and Dove ('''Wiley Wolverman''') appeared in a 5-issue mini-series in 1997, written by [[Mike Baron]]. In this version, completely unrelated to the concept of the Lords of Chaos and Order, the duo's conflicting personalities manifested as "[[military brat]]" and "slacker dude," respectively. They gained large bird wings and a telepathic link by receiving experimental medical treatments as children. Following the mini-series, the new Hawk and Dove made a handful of cameo appearances in Titans-related books, once protecting the town of Woodstock, New York, during a worldwide crisis.

=== Holly and Dawn Granger===<!-- This section is linked from [[List of DC Comics characters: H]] -->
[[File:Hawkdove4.jpg|thumb|175px|left|Hawk and Dove: Holly and Dawn. Art by Mike McKone.]]
In 2003, ''JSA'' #45-50 told of a mysterious woman in a coma who was taken into the care of the Justice Society. Initially thought to be the comatose body of [[Hector Hall]]'s missing wife, [[Fury (DC Comics)|Hippolyta Trevor]], the woman was revealed to be none other than the presumed-dead Dawn Granger. Dawn's "death" was revealed to be a hoax orchestrated by the villain Mordru, who was also revealed to have caused Hank's insanity that set him down to path to becoming Monarch (and later Extant).

Dawn later gained a new partner when her estranged and aggressive British sister, '''Holly Granger''', was granted the mystical powers of Chaos, becoming the third Hawk. Holly's first appearance was in ''Teen Titans'' vol. 3, #22-23, joining her sister and many other former Titans against [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Dr. Light]]. The duo later re-teamed with the Titans to rescue [[Raven (comics)|Raven]]'s "soul self" from their old nemesis, Kestrel.

In the ''Day of Vengeance'' [[limited series]], the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] attacks and apparently destroys T'Charr and Terataya (who apparently were temporarily no longer dead), leaving Hawk and Dove supposedly powerless. Despite this, however, Hawk and Dove were shown during a worldwide prison break, being contacted telepathically by [[Martian Manhunter|J'onn J'onzz]]. Both were in costume, and Dove was carrying Hawk while flying, possibly implying that T'Charr and Terataya were somehow restored to life after Earth entered the Tenth Age of Magic. 

Hawk and Dove also appeared in ''[[Countdown to Mystery]]'', in which Dawn Granger is one of a number of heroes possessed by [[Eclipso]]. In ''Teen Titans'' vol. 3, #34 (post-''[[Infinite Crisis]]''), Holly and Dawn are shown in Titans Tower sometime during the [[52 (comics)|previous year]], with dialogue from Hawk implying that they were at the time members of the Teen Titans. Their association with the team was temporary, though they resurfaced in the ''[[Titans East]] Special'' as part of a new team organized by [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]]. The sisters were both shot by energy beams from [[Trigon (comics)|Trigon]] and were left for dead. Later events showed they were badly injured but had survived the experience.<ref>Titans vol. 2, #1 (June 2008)</ref>

===''Blackest Night''===
{{Main|Blackest Night}}
In ''Blackest Night'' #2, multiple [[Power ring (DC Comics)#Black|black power rings]] attempt to reanimate the body of Don Hall, only to be prevented from disturbing his grave by an invisible barrier. As they collide with the barrier, the rings' typical command ("rise") is interrupted; the rings instead respond, "Don Hall of Earth at peace." This is the first depiction of the black power rings failing to recruit a member for the [[Black Lantern Corps]].<ref name="bn2">''Blackest Night'' #2 (October 2009)</ref> Though Don rejects the black rings, his brother Hank's corpse accepts his with humor: "Same old, same old, huh, bro?

Eventually Dove goes to Titans Tower for help, only to find it under attack by more Black Lantern Titans. Holly and Hank catch up to her and resume their attack. When Holly attempts to rip out Dawn's heart, a blast of white energy radiates from her body, severing the connection between Holly and the ring. Dawn then turns the light on the other Black Lanterns, destroying all but [[Terra (comics)|Terra]], [[Garth (comics)|Tempest]] and Hank. The effort causes Dawn to pass out. While unconscious, she has a vision of Don, who tells her that she can save Hank, and should not give up on him.<ref name="bnt3">''Blackest Night: Titans'' #3 (December 2009)</ref>

Dawn and the Titans join the [[Justice League]] in battling the Black Lanterns at [[Coast City]]. She is able to destroy Black Lanterns with her very presence. The [[Flash (Barry Allen)]] witnesses Dawn's fight with the undead army and realises that she possesses the "white light of creation" as mentioned by Indigo-1 (a member from the [[Indigo Tribe]]), a power believed to be created by the combined seven powers of the emotional spectrum.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #3 (November 2009)</ref> During the battle, Dove's white energies are pulled into the Black Lanterns' central power battery, under the control of the being trapped inside <ref>''Blackest Night'' #7 (February 2010)</ref>: the being is eventually revealed to be the villainous [[Anti-Monitor]].

===''Brightest Day''===
{{Main|Brightest Day}}
Hank and Dawn encounter [[Deadman]] shortly after the events of ''Blackest Night''. They have him, in their own particular ways, try to resurrect Don and Holly, but to no avail;<ref>''Brightest Day'' #4 (June 2010)</ref><ref>''Brightest Day'' #5 (July 2010)</ref> the voice guiding Deadman simply indicates death no longer holds the same meaning.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #6 (July 2010)</ref> The three are transported to [[Silver City, New Mexico]], where they find the White Lantern power battery in a crater. When Deadman asks the white battery why they were all brought back to life, the [[White Lantern Corps|Entity]] tells them that it is dying and requires a successor. The Entity also tells Hawk to save Dawn from [[Captain Boomerang]] (although the fact that it also told Boomerang to attack Dawn in the first place suggests a larger plan at play). When asking why Dove needs to be protected, the Entity said they all need protection.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #7 (August 2010)</ref>

Dove and Deadman travel together for a time, first to [[Atlantis]]<ref>''Brightest Day'' #9 (September 2010)</ref> and then [[Gotham City]],<ref>''Brightest Day'' #12 (October 2010)</ref> in a search for a candidate to replace the Entity.

Later as the "dark avatar" made his presence known, Hawk and Dove are transported to the Star City forest by the Entity, where it tells them that they must protect the forest and withstand the ultimate savior, [[Swamp Thing|Alec Holland]].<ref>''Brightest Day'' #23 (April 2011)</ref> Within the forest, Captain Boomerang finds Dawn and throws a boomerang at her. Hawk fails to catch it, but Deadman succeeds, dying in the process. Hawk is left to knock Captain Boomerang unconscious. After the Dark Avatar is defeated, the Entity reveals to them that the boomerang was a part a plan to free Hawk from his role as an avatar of war from the Lords of Chaos: his act of saving Dawn would have broken their power over Hawk and allow him to be true to himself. Dawn is heartbroken. She and Boston Brand share an emotional farewell as Brand resumes his duties as "Deadman".<ref>''Brightest Day'' #24 (April 2011)</ref>

Around this same time period, Dawn and Hank are recruited into the [[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]] by [[Zinda Blake]] while in Gotham to stop some teenaged supervillains. Immediately after their meeting with Zinda, the two are called in by [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]] to rescue [[Black Canary]] and the [[Huntress (Helena Bertinelli)|Huntress]] from a villainess calling herself White Canary.<ref>''Birds of Prey'' vol. 2 #1-2 (July–August 2010)</ref> Dove also appears as part of [[Wonder Woman]]'s all-female superteam in ''Wonder Woman'' #600.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/files/2010/06/ww_600_no_ads-3-copy.jpg | title=Image of Wonder Woman's all-female superteam | work=DC Comics.com}}</ref>

=== The New 52===
DC relaunched this title as part of their company-wide [[The New 52|reboot]] of their 52 major titles. It was released on September 7, 2011, written by [[Sterling Gates]] and art by [[Rob Liefeld]].

In this new series, Hawk and Dove are Hank Hall and Dawn Granger, who resume their superhero activities in Washington, DC, with assistance from Deadman. They encounter Condor and Swan, a new pair of supervillains who possess superpowers similar to theirs. Hawk and Dove fight Condor and Swan after they try to kill President [[Barack Obama|Obama]] and Hank's father. Swan escapes, but Hawk and Dove manage to defeat Condor, who is revealed to be an old man, likely as a reference to the [[Marvel Comics]] supervillain the [[Vulture (comics)|Vulture]].

In the new continuity, Dawn Granger has a tenuous romantic relationship with Deadman, and has appeared in the team comic ''[[Justice League Dark]]''.  The series was cancelled after issue 8 (released April 4, 2012).<ref name=SecondWave>{{cite web| last = Kushins| first = Josh| title = DC Comics in 2012-–-Introducing the "Second Wave" of DC Comics The New 52| work = The Source| publisher = DC Comics| date = January 12, 2012| url = http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/2012/01/12/dc-comics-in-2012-–-introducing-the-“second-wave”-of-dc-comics-the-new-52/| accessdate = January 14, 2012| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/64hEz5q0J| archivedate = January 14, 2012}}</ref>

During the first issue, the origins of Hawk and Dove are recounted - Don and Hank were Dove and Hawk for at least two years, until three years before the start of the series, when Don perished during the "worst crisis the world has ever seen" (referencing Don's death in the original canon in the Crisis) and Dawn became the next avatar almost immediately. It is also said that Dawn had a connection to Don, known only to herself and Deadman, but unbeknownst to Hank.

==Powers and abilities==

===Dove===
Dove possesses an ability known as danger sense transformation. When in the presence of danger, whether to herself or others, Dawn Granger can call out the word "Dove" and transform into Dove. She does not need to be aware of danger, meaning she transforms if she says the word while unknowingly being in danger. However, the transformation requires actual danger, so if Dawn incorrectly believed that she was in danger (such as when Barter abducted her), she would be unable to transform into Dove.

The transformation wears off a short time after the danger is past unless Dove has received serious injuries that would kill Dawn, in which case she remains as Dove until the danger from the injuries has passed. It is unknown how close to the danger she needs to be to transform. Hank once visited a number of warehouses to find which was being used as a hideout for some criminals, saying "Hawk" outside each until he changed. On high magic worlds, Dawn can remain as Dove for extended periods regardless of whether danger is present.

The transformation changes Granger into a minor force of Order and she gains avian physical characteristics, which are usually hidden under her costume. The costume is normally irremovable while on Earth, but if it receives sufficient damage, it can tear and reveal part of her true form, which shines with the light of Order, emitting a golden glow. Within realms of higher magic, Dove can easily remove the costume and show her true form.

Dove is also hypervigilant; her natural aptitudes are enhanced, such as her ability as a good judge of people that allows her to read people and objects within seconds, and know how they will behave. In addition to flight, she also has enhanced agility, can withstand a great deal of physical punishment and heal quickly and her perception becomes so great that she becomes aware of most things within the realm.

Due to her connection with Terataya, on high magic worlds her powers are enhanced. She can concentrate her radiance into a blinding beam of light. She also possesses the White Light of Creation. It is unknown whether this power is an extension of her radiance ability, but during the ''Blackest Night'' crisis, Dove was able to channel this particular force and destroy Black Lanterns as well as block a Black Lantern's aura-reading power. How and why Dawn was chosen for this power, or whether it has anything to do with her link to Terataya, remains unknown.

As seen in the pages of ''Blackest Night'', Don Hall is impervious to black power rings. In an interview with [[IGN]], [[Geoff Johns]] provides an explanation behind Dove's immunity to the black power rings: "You'll learn more about this as we go forward. But really it speaks to the nature of Don Hall. He can't be desecrated by the likes of these things. He's untouchable in death and at total peace more than any other being in the universe." Reflecting on the limitations of the rings, Johns goes on to state that, even though magic is a "joke" to the black power rings, Don is quite the opposite.<ref name="inside2">{{Cite web | url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/101/1014315p1.html | title=Geoff Johns: Inside Blackest Night - Part Two | work=[[IGN]] | date=August 14, 2009}}</ref>

===Hawk===
Hawk possesses the powers of a more powerful God Chaos,danger Sense Transformation, claws, hypervigilance, superhuman durability, speed, strength, and stamina.

==In other media==
===Television===
[[File:Hawkanddove.JPG|right|175px|thumb|The original Hawk and Dove as depicted in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''.]]
* Animated versions of Hawk and Dove (Hank and Don Hall) were featured alongside [[Wonder Woman]] in an episode of ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' titled "Hawk and Dove", voiced by [[Jason Hervey]] and [[Fred Savage]] (both of whom starred in the television series ''[[The Wonder Years]]'' as brothers Wayne and Kevin Arnold). This version of the duo depicts a stronger relationship between the brothers. Don is more self-confident, and their philosophical bickering is more like a brotherly teasing. Ironically, there is a role reversal: Fred Savage (who played nerdy Kevin) voices the violent Hawk while Hervey (who played the bully Wayne) voices the pacifist Dove. They were originally to have voiced their more obvious roles, but tried switching during rehearsals, to the approval of the director. In this episode, their fighting styles were thoroughly contrasted. Hawk employs brute-force, aggressive tactics, at times resembling a [[American football|football]] player. Dove, on the other hand, uses a blend of techniques reminiscent of [[aikido]] or perhaps [[judo]], using his attacker's movements to fling them aside. Wonder Woman enlisted them to help stop [[Ares (DC Comics)|Ares]] from causing war in [[Kaznia]]. They are successful due to Dove's peaceful resistance against the rage-powered Annihilator. This episode is another example of how close the two are, as Hawk struggles against Wonder Woman in an attempt to protect his brother. They are last seen in the series finale, "Destroyer", where they fight off [[Parademon]]s alongside several other League members. They later appear in the final scene running down the steps of the Metro Tower with the rest of the League. Fittingly enough, both in that fight scene and as they exit in the finale of the episode, they appear along with fellow Steve Ditko creations the [[Question (comics)|Question]], the [[Creeper (comics)|Creeper]], and [[Captain Atom]].

* Hawk and Dove appear in the teaser for the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "When [[OMAC (Buddy Blank)|OMAC]] Attacks!", with Hawk voiced by [[Greg Ellis (actor)|Greg Ellis]] and Dove voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]. They help [[Batman]] stop an intergalactic war between the [[Controllers (DC Comics)|Controllers]] and the Warlords of Okaara. While Hawk and Dove take out the ground forces, Dove claims that it is better to settle things diplomatically while Hawk says that they have to hurt them or they will never stop. Regardless, Batman gets the two sides' leaders to sign the peace treaty and end the war. Hawk and Dove do manage to embarrass themselves, their bickering causing them to fight in front of the leaders. Batman invites the leaders to have a drink in his ship to draw their attention from the bickering brothers. Hawk and also briefly appear in the two-part episode "The Siege of Starro!" amongst the heroes who were taken over by [[Starro]]. After Starro's defeat, Hawk and Dove are transformed back to normal.
