'''Hawk and Dove''' are the names used by a number of [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]]es who fight crime together as duos, despite their sharply differing methods and attitudes about [[violence]]. This difference is signified by the bird [[iconography]]: the [[hawk]] typically representing [[aggression]], and the [[dove]] representing [[pacifism]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Hank and Don Hall===<!-- This section is linked from [[List of DC Comics characters: D]] -->
Created by [[Steve Ditko]] and [[Steve Skeates]], brothers '''[[Hank Hall|Hank]]''' and '''Don Hall''' first appeared in ''Showcase'' #75. The pair gained their powers of heightened strength and agility from a mysterious voice (later [[Secret Origins]] #43 explained the voice was from two [[Lords of Chaos and Order]] who had fallen in love) and fought crime together as Hawk & Dove, despite their diametrically opposed opinions about the use of force. The conservative Hawk (Hank) was hot-headed and reactionary, whereas the liberal Dove (Don) was more thoughtful and reasoned (but prone to indecisiveness). Their father, a judge, displayed more balanced political beliefs and firmly disapproved of [[vigilantism]], not knowing his sons were costumed adventurers.

Their own title, ''The Hawk and the Dove'', ran for six issues from 1968 to 1969. Ditko only plotted the first issue, and left after the second one. Skeates was unhappy with the direction the book was taking, feeling that Don was being portrayed as an ineffective wimp, rather than a pro-active pacifist.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Ditko by contrast felt that Skeates had turned Hawk into a fool whose answer to every problem was unreasoning violence, compared to the "liberal" Dove, now the only one of the two who made any sense at all.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Ditko had wanted a more balanced approach, showing that both "hawks" and "doves" had valid points.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Skeates would leave after the fourth issue, leaving artist [[Gil Kane]] as writer through the last issue.

After their series ended they became semi-regulars in [[Teen Titans]], eventually joining Titans West. Dove died in 1985's ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' while saving a young boy being attacked by the [[Anti-Monitor]]'s shadow demons. The creature that killed him came from behind and Hawk was too far away to do anything about it.

A statue of Don is part of the [[Titans Tower#Memorial|memorial]] at [[Titans Tower]] in [[San Francisco]].

Hawk continued on his own, but without Dove to restrain him, he became excessively violent to the point where many of the superhero community considered him nearly as much trouble as the supervillains.

They both made a cameo appearance in the non-canon graphic novel ''[[The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'' during the popularity of costumed vigilantes, as old and fat. They live on [[Christopher Street (Manhattan)|Christopher Street]]; Hawk is asking Dove "We can still squeeze into the tights. What do you say, partner? Ready for action? It's all the rage" and Dove responds "But, Haank! Back then, all we did was argue!" A caption above them read "The Hawk and The Dove - don't ask..."

===Hank Hall and Dawn Granger===<!-- This section is linked from [[List of DC Comics characters: D]] -->
[[Image:Hawk and Dove2.jpg|175px|thumb|Hawk and Dove: Hank and Dawn. Artwork by [[Rob Liefeld]].]]
In 1988, a new ''Hawk and Dove'' mini-series written by [[Karl Kesel|Karl]] and [[Barbara Kesel]] reintroduced Hawk and Dove in a 5-issue mini series. This series introduced a woman named Dawn Granger, the second Dove, and a new enemy, [[Kestrel (DC Comics)|Kestrel]]. The new Dove mysteriously received her powers while attempting to save her mother from terrorists. At the end of the mini-series, it was revealed that Dawn received her powers the moment Don had been stripped of them. This Dove, while considerably more aggressive and self confident than Don, also has greater-than-average strength and dexterity, faster-than-human speed, and expanded mental capabilities. Dove fights mostly defensively, preferring to out-think and remain in control of her opponent. Like Hawk, she also heals incredibly quickly and cannot revert to Dawn if her wounds or some other condition would be fatal to Dawn. It was later revealed that Hawk & Dove become beings that are direct conduits of the respective planes of chaos and order.

Set in [[Washington, D.C.]] (where the duo attended [[Georgetown University]]), the series introduced several supporting characters, including Hank's girlfriend, Ren Takamori, and friends Kyle Spenser and Donna Cabot. They also worked with police Captain Brian 'Sal' Arsala, who would develop a mutual admiration with Dawn. It also introduced Kestrel, an evil spell created by M'Shulla, and Barter, owner of BARTER TRADING: Exotic Goods and Services.

[[Image:Hawk and Dove 15.jpg|175px|thumb|left|Hawk & Dove's true forms.]]
 
In issues #14-17 of the ongoing series, Kestrel, in the body of Ren Takamori, lured Hawk & Dove to the mystical land of Druspa Tau - also home to the Lords of Chaos and Order. Hawk & Dove cut a deal with Barter to transverse dimensions to Druspa Tau. On Druspa Tau, the two, as Hawk and Dove, were able to remove their costumes, revealing their true forms, and found their abilities were heightened exponentially. They arrived as a war was brewing between M'Shulla, The Lord of Chaos, and followers of Arriya, the Lord of Order. Finding themselves on opposite sides, Hawk and Dove were forced to do battle. M'Shulla tells a captive Rome that he cast a spell long ago, that Arriya is not the name of Druspa Tau's former Order goddess. No one knows her true name any longer, and therefore she cannot return to Druspa Tau. Just as M'Shulla is about to claim final victory, Barter tells Rome the true name of the world's Order lord: Terataya. Her name is spoken, and a dragon wearing an amulet appears. The dragon/amulet is a combined being: Terataya, lord of Order, and T'Charr, lord of Chaos, and is now called The Unity. The Unity fight with M'Shulla and because it is maintaining the Hawk and Dove spell, The Unity cannot fight him as well. M'Shulla deals The Unity a fatal blow, and The Unity retreats to a hidden cave.

Dove is able to use her logical powers to see how the Kestrel demon is attached to Ren... and separate them. Hawk then absorbs the Kestrel force (since it's part of Chaos, and Hawk is one with the primal source of Chaos while on Druspa Tau), effectively annihilating it and freeing Ren. Hawk and Dove then fly off to find The Unity, leaving Ren behind. In the cave where The Unity hides, Hawk and Dove find their creators, T'Charr and Terataya, dying. The Unity explains that it created Hawk and Dove to prove to the other Lords of Chaos and Order that the two forces could work together. It did this because T'Charr and Terataya are in love, and have been hunted by their respective houses ever since. However, they are dying. So, Hawk and Dove absorb the essence of their respective creators. This merging gave both Hawk and Dove enhanced powers, but it meant there will be no new Hawk or Dove if either of the current heroes died. Hawk and Dove also learned their abilities were upgraded: Dove could fly and Hawk was stronger and bulletproof.

In Hawk and Dove #20, Dove was trapped inside a shopping mall, having to battle Christmas-themed robbers, after she sends her mother away for the holidays.<ref>Hawk and Dove #20</ref>

====''Armageddon 2001'' and ''Zero Hour''====
In 1991, in an editorial snafu concerning the miniseries ''[[Armageddon 2001]]'', word leaked out that the central time-travelling villain of the piece (known as Monarch) was actually Captain Atom. [[Monarch (comics)|Monarch]] had originally been conceived as a future identity of [[Captain Atom]] (post-psychotic break); [[Waverider (comics)|Waverider]] had even 'checked' Hawk's future in ''Hawk & Dove'' Annual #2 (which had them fighting Monarch eliminating them as possible candidates). In a last-ditch effort to provide a 'surprise twist', DC changed the storyline. Sales on ''Hawk & Dove'' had dipped, and the series was slotted for cancellation, so Monarch's identity was revealed as the future Hank Hall. Monarch attacked Hawk and Dove and managed to murder Dawn in front of Hank, causing him to suffer the psychotic break, kill Monarch, and assume the villainous identity. He briefly became a recurring foe for Captain Atom before absorbing Waverider's time-travel powers, subsequently changing his form and name to Extant in ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]''. Later, he challenged the [[Justice Society of America]], an encounter that led directly to his demise when [[Albert Rothstein|Atom Smasher]] used the [[New God]] [[Metron (comics)|Metron]]'s mobius chair to transfer Hall onto a doomed plane in place of the Atom-Smasher's mother. Despite this, a statue of him is in the Titans Tower memorial in San Francisco.

In ''JSA'', Dove's apparent death and Hawk's turning evil was revealed to be part of a larger plan by the evil sorcerer, [[Mordru]].

In Teen Titans #31, Hank and Don Hall reappear as [[zombie]]s, brought back to life by [[Brother Blood]], who was freed as a result of the events of ''[[Day of Vengeance]]''.

===A New Hawk and Dove===
[[Image:Hawkanddove3.JPG|thumb|175px|right|Hawk and Dove: Sasha and Wiley.]]
Another Hawk ('''Sasha Martens''') and Dove ('''Wiley Wolverman'''), appeared in a five-issue mini-series in 1997, written by [[Mike Baron]]. In this version, completely unrelated to the concept of the Lords of Chaos and Order, the duo's conflicting personalities manifested as "[[military brat]]" and "slacker dude," respectively. They gained large bird wings and a telepathic link by receiving experimental medical treatments as children.

Following the mini-series, the new Hawk and Dove made a handful of cameo appearances in Titans-related books, once protecting the town of Woodstock, New York, during a worldwide crisis.

===Holly and Dawn Granger===<!-- This section is linked from [[List of DC Comics characters: H]] -->
In 2003, ''JSA'' issues #45-50 told of a mysterious woman in a coma who was taken into the care of the Justice Society. Initially thought to be the comatose body of [[Hector Hall]]'s missing wife, [[Fury (DC Comics)|Hippolyta Trevor]], the woman was revealed to be none other than the presumed-dead Dawn Granger. Dawn's "death" was revealed to be a hoax orchestrated by the villain Mordru, who was also revealed to have caused Hank's insanity. Dawn later gained a new partner when her estranged and aggressive British sister, '''Holly Granger''', was granted the mystical powers of Chaos, becoming the third Hawk. Holly's first appearance was in ''Teen Titans'' vol. 3, #22-23, joining her sister and many other former Titans against a newly evil [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Dr. Light]]. The duo later re-teamed with the Titans to rescue [[Raven (comics)|Raven]]'s "soul self" from their old nemesis, Kestrel.

In the ''Day of Vengeance'' [[limited series]], the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] attacks and apparently destroys T'Charr and Terataya (who apparently were temporarily no longer dead), leaving Hawk and Dove supposedly powerless. Despite this however, Hawk and Dove were shown during a worldwide prison break, being contacted telepathically by [[Martian Manhunter|J'onn J'onzz]]. Both were in costume, and Dove was carrying Hawk while flying, possibly implying that they were somehow restored to life after Earth entered the Tenth Age of Magic. 

Hawk and Dove have also appeared in ''[[Countdown to Mystery]]'', in which Dawn Granger is one of a number of heroes possessed by [[Eclipso]].

In ''Teen Titans'' vol. 3, #34 (post ''[[Infinite Crisis]]''), Holly and Dawn are shown in Titans Tower sometime during the [[52 (comic book)|previous year]], with dialogue from Hawk implying that they were at the time members of the Teen Titans. Their association with the team was temporary though they resurfaced in the [[Titans East]] Special as part of a new team organized by Cyborg. The sisters were both shot by energy beams from [[Trigon (comics)|Trigon]] and were left for dead. They are in serious condition but stable.

===Blackest Night===
{{Main|Blackest Night}}

In ''Blackest Night'' #2, multiple [[Power ring (DC Comics)#Black|black power rings]] attempt to reanimated the body of Don Hall, only to be prevented from disturbing his grave by an invisible barrier. As they collide with the barrier, the rings' typical command ("rise") is interrupted; the rings instead respond: "Don Hall of Earth at peace." This is the first depiction of the black power rings failing to recruit a member for the [[Black Lantern Corps]].<ref name="bn2">''Blackest Night'' #2 (October 2009)</ref> In an interview with IGN, Geoff Johns provides an explanation behind Dove's immunity to the black power rings: "You'll learn more about this as we go forward. But really it speaks to the nature of Don Hall. He can't be desecrated by the likes of these things. He's untouchable in death and at total peace more than any other being in the universe." Reflecting on the limitations of the rings, Johns goes on to state that, even though magic is a "joke" to the black power rings, Don is quite the opposite.<ref name="inside2">[http://comics.ign.com/articles/101/1014315p1.html Geoff Johns: Inside Blackest Night - Part Two], [[IGN]], August 14, 2009</ref> Though Don rejects the black rings, his brother Hank's corpse accepts his with humor: "Same old, same old, huh, bro? Hawk's got to do all the dirty work himself."<ref name="bn2" />

In ''Blackest Night: Titans'' #1, Hank lures Holly and Dawn to a library with a trail of dead hawks and doves. As Hank attacks, Dawn claims he isn't what he says he is; pointing out that the real Hank would know that she is almost impossible to hit. Hank is also unable to read Dawn's emotions; her aura depicted as being white rather than a color from the [[Emotional spectrum]]. Holly isn't able to confront Hank as deftly, the issue concluding with him plunging his hand into her left breast to remove her heart.<ref name="bnt1">''Blackest Night: Titans'' #1 (October 2009)</ref>. A black ring then claims Holly's body. The two Black Lantern Hawks prove too much for Dawn, and she retreats, with the two giving chase.<ref>''Blackest Night: Titans'' #2 (November 2009)</ref>

Dove goes to Titans Tower, only to find it under attack by more Black Lantern Titans. Holly and Hank catch up to her, and resume their attack. When Holly attempts to rip out Dawn's heart, a blast of white energy radiates from her body, severing the connection between Holly and the ring. Dawn then turns the light on the other Black Lanterns, destroying all but Black Lantern [[Terra (comics)|Terra]], [[Garth (comics)|Tempest]], and Hank. The effort causes Dawn to pass out. While unconscious, she has a vision of Don, who tells her that she can save Hank, and to not give up on him.<ref>''Blackest Night: Titans'' #3 (December 2009)</ref>

Dawn, along with the rest of the Titans, joins the Justice League in battling the Black Lanterns at [[Coast City]]. She is able to destroy Black Lanterns with her very presence. The [[Barry Allen (Flash)|Flash (Barry Allen)]] witnesses Dawn's fight with the undead army and realises that she possesses the "white light of creation" as mentioned from Indigo-1, a member from the [[Indigo Tribe]], a power believed to be created by the combined seven powers of the [[emotional spectrum]]. The Scarlet Speedster then orders every hero nearby to protect her at all cost, believing that she could be the key to their victory against the Black Lanterns.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #3 (November 2009)</ref><ref>''Blackest Night'' #5 (January 2010)</ref>

==Other media==
===Television===
[[Image:Hawkanddove.JPG|right|175px|thumb|The original Hawk and Dove as depicted in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'']]
* Animated versions of Hawk and Dove I were featured alongside [[Wonder Woman]] in an episode of ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' titled "Hawk and Dove" voiced by [[Jason Hervey]] and [[Fred Savage]] (both of whom starred in the TV series ''[[The Wonder Years]]'' as brothers Wayne and Kevin Arnold). This version of the duo depicts a stronger relationship between the brothers. Don is more self confident, and their philosophical bickering is more like a brotherly teasing. Ironically, there is a role reversal: Fred Savage (who played nerdy Kevin) voices the violent Hawk while Hervey (who played the bully Wayne) voices the pacifist Dove. They were originally to have voiced their more obvious roles, but tried switching during rehearsals, to the approval of the director. In this episode, their fighting styles were thoroughly contrasted. Hawk employs brute-force, aggressive tactics, at times resembling nothing so much as an [[American football]]-player. Dove, on the other hand, uses a blend of techniques reminiscent of [[aikido]] or perhaps [[judo]], using his attacker's movements to fling them aside. Wonder Woman enlisted them to help stop [[Ares (DC Comics)|Ares]]' plot from causing war in [[Kaznia]]. They are successful due to Dove's peaceful resistance against the rage-powered Annihilator. There we see another example of how close the two are, as Hawk struggles against Wonder Woman in an attempt to protect his brother. They are last seen in the series finale 'Destroyer', where they fight off [[Parademon]]s alongside several other league members. They later appear in the final scene running down the steps of the metro tower with the rest of the league.  Fittingly enough, both in that fight scene and as they exit in the finale of the episode, they appear along with fellow Steve Ditko creations the Question, the Creeper and Captain Atom.

* Hawk and Dove appear in the teaser for the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode ''When [[One-Man Army Corps|OMAC]] Attacks!'', with Hawk voiced by [[Greg Ellis (actor)|Greg Ellis]] and Dove voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]. They help Batman stop an intergalactic war between two (ironically similarly color coated Red and Blue) armies, while Hawk and Dove take out the ground forces, Dove claims that it's better to settle thing diplomatically, while Hawk says that they have to hurt them or they will never stop. Regardless, Batman gets the two sides leader to the peace treaty and end the war. Hawk and Dove do manage to embarrass themselves, their bickering causing them to fight in front of the leader, while Batman invites them to have a drink in his ship, to draw their attention from the bickering brothers.
