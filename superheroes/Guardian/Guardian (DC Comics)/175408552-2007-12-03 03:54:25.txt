The '''Guardian''' ('''Jim Harper''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[DC Comics]] costumed hero. Created by [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]], he first appeared in ''[[Star Spangled Comics]]'' #7 (1942). The character resembles an earlier Simon and Kirby-created character, [[Captain America]], (published by [[Marvel Comics]]) in that he had no super powers and carried a shield.

==Jim Harper==
Jim Harper was a police officer in [[Metropolis (Superman)|Metropolis]]' [[Suicide Slum]] who became a [[vigilante]] to catch crooks that the law couldn't prosecute, describing himself as guarding society from criminals. He was aided by a group of boys known as the [[Newsboy Legion]], to whom he was, literally, a guardian. The Legion grew up to become the heads of the [[Cadmus Project]], subsequently saving Harper's life by transferring his mind from his old, dying body into a clone of himself when he was younger.

According to a later [[retcon]], Jim Harper was the uncle of Roy Harper, who became [[Green Arrow]]'s sidekick under the name of "[[Roy Harper (comics)|Speedy]]".

It's been revealed that Harper has a grandniece now working for the [[Gotham City]] Police Department.

==Golden Guardian==<!-- This section is linked from [[List of DC Comics characters: G]] -->
In ''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen #133'' (October 1970), Jack Kirby reintroduced the boys of the now grown-up Newsboy Legion as supporting characters connected with the DNA Project (later [[Project Cadmus]]), a [[genetics]] research laboratory. One of the Project's  experiments was a [[Clone (genetics)|clone]] of the late Jim Harper, who took up his predecessor's role, and became the Project's Head of Security as the '''Golden Guardian'''. Post-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] this character was simply known as the Guardian.

==Mal Duncan==<!-- This section is linked from [[List of DC Comics characters: G]] -->
In ''[[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]]'' #44 (November 1976), the previously uncostumed Titan '''[[Mal Duncan]]''' took the name of the Guardian, wearing the original's outfit and an [[exoskeleton#Human exoskeletons in science fiction|exoskeleton]] with strength augmenting abilities. The two Guardians finally met in ''Superman Family'' #s 191-193 (Sept 78-Feb 79), when Mal helped rescue the Harper clone from the Project's villainous counterpart, the Evil Factory.

The [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]] removed Duncan's career as the Guardian, but Harper's history remained largely unchanged, and he remained Cadmus' Head of Security even after the former Newsboys had left. Eventually, he too was killed, although another clone was created and rapidly aged to adulthood, retaining all his predecessor's memories. This Guardian disappeared along with the rest of Cadmus following an altercation with [[Amanda Waller]] and [[Lex Luthor|President Luthor]], and his whereabouts are unknown.

In the Frank Miller graphic novel [[Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again]], the Guardian is one of the superheroes killed by the "Joker."
