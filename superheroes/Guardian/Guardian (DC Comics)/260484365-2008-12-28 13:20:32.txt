The '''Guardian''' ('''Jim Harper''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[DC Comics]] costumed hero. Created by [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]], he first appeared in ''[[Star Spangled Comics]]'' #7 (1942).<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation | last = Greenberger | first = Robert | author-link = Robert Greenberger | contribution = Guardian | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 150 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York  | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref> The character resembles an earlier Simon and Kirby-created character, [[Captain America]] (created in 1941, and published by [[Marvel Comics]]), in that he had no super powers and carried a shield.

==Jim Harper==
Jim Harper was a police officer in [[Metropolis (Superman)|Metropolis]]' [[Suicide Slum]] who became a [[vigilante]] to catch crooks that the law couldn't prosecute, describing himself as guarding society from criminals. He was aided by a group of boys known as the [[Newsboy Legion]], to whom he was, literally, a guardian. The Legion grew up to become the heads of the [[Cadmus Project]], subsequently saving Harper's life by transferring his mind from his old, dying body into a clone of himself when he was younger.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

It was later revealed that Jim Harper was the uncle of Roy Harper, who became [[Green Arrow]]'s sidekick under the name of "[[Roy Harper (comics)|Speedy]]".{{Fact|date=November 2008}}

It has also been revealed that Harper has an African-American grandniece now working for the [[Gotham City]] Police Department.{{Fact|date=November 2008}}

==Golden Guardian==<!-- This section is linked from [[List of DC Comics characters: G]] -->
In ''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen #135'' (January 1971), Jack Kirby reintroduced the boys of the now grown-up Newsboy Legion as supporting characters connected with the DNA Project (later [[Project Cadmus]]), a [[genetics]] research laboratory. One of the Project's  experiments was a [[Clone (genetics)|clone]] of the late Jim Harper, who took up his predecessor's role, and became the Project's Head of Security as the '''Golden Guardian'''. Post-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] this character was simply known as the Guardian.

The Guardian disappeared with the rest of Cadmus following [[Lex Luthor]]'s rise to the Presidency, as shown in ''[[Superboy]]''.

===Post-Infinite Crisis===
Following ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', the Guardian clone's backstory was [[retcon]]ned. As [[Dubbilex]] explained to [[Jimmy Olsen]] in the ''Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen'' one-shot (October 2008), Jim Harper was not killed in the line of duty, but shot by Cadmus's first head of security, [[Codename: Assassin|Jonathan Drew]], upon discovering the clone was already being created.

It was also revealed that the original Guardian clone had left Cadmus early on, and was now living in the town of Warpath on the [[Mexico|Mexican]] border, where he assisted Sheriff [[Vigilante (comics)|Greg Saunders]]. Subsequent appearances of the Guardian had been new clones, each of which died within a year.

The original Guardian clone has decided to move to Metropolis with his adopted daughter (in fact, an adolescent female clone of himself that he rescued), at the time of the [[Superman: New Krypton|New Krypton]] storyline.<ref>Adventure Comics Special #1</ref>

==Mal Duncan==<!-- This section is linked from [[List of DC Comics characters: G]] -->
In ''[[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]]'' #44 (November 1976), the previously uncostumed Titan '''[[Mal Duncan]]''' took the name of the Guardian, wearing the original's outfit and an [[exoskeleton#Human exoskeletons in science fiction|exoskeleton]] with strength augmenting abilities. The two Guardians finally met in ''Superman Family'' #s 191-193 (Sept 78-Feb 79), when Mal helped rescue the Harper clone from Adam, an evil clone created using genetic material from both Harper and [[Dubbilex]] who had taken control of the DNA Project.

The [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]] removed Duncan's career as the Guardian, but Harper's history remained largely unchanged, and he remained Cadmus' Head of Security even after the former Newsboys had left. Eventually, he too was killed, although another clone was created and rapidly aged to adulthood, retaining all his predecessor's memories. This Guardian disappeared along with the rest of Cadmus following an altercation with [[Amanda Waller]] and [[Lex Luthor|President Luthor]], and his whereabouts are unknown.

In the Frank Miller graphic novel [[Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again]], the Guardian is one of the superheroes killed by the Joker.

==Jake Jordan==

In 2005, [[Grant Morrison]]'s [[Seven Soldiers of Victory#Seven Soldiers|''Seven Soldiers'' megaseries]] introduced a new character based on the original Guardian, Jake Jordan the [[Manhattan Guardian]].
