'''Guardian (James "Mac" MacDonald Hudson)''', also known as '''Weapon Alpha''' and '''Vindicator''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Universe]] who was the leader of [[Alpha Flight]]. He was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne]]. He was designed to be the Canadian equivalent of [[Captain America]], hence his costume markings are modelled after the [[Canadian flag]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Early work===
James MacDonald Hudson is a leading scientist for the ''Am-Can Corporation'' developing a [[powered armor|powered exo-skeleton suit]]. When he learns that his work will be used for American military purposes, Hudson raids his workplace, steals the prototype suit and destroys the plans. He leaves the suit to be recovered (albeit without the vital control helmet) and fully expects to be sued and arrested for his actions.

However, Hudson's girlfriend, [[Vindicator|Heather MacNeil]], uses political connections in the [[Canadian government]] to persuade ''Am-Can'' to waive the charges against him.  As a result, [[Department H]] is formed, a secret branch of the Canadian Ministry of Defense, and Hudson is named as head of operations.  Inspired by the debut of the [[Fantastic Four]], Hudson forms Alpha Flight as a superhero team for the Canadian government and develops his exo-skeleton into a battle suit.

===Alpha Flight===
Hudson's tenure with Alpha Flight, however, is short lived. Although seemingly killed when his battlesuit explodes, he is in fact transported to Jupiter's moon, [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]].  There he meets an alien race known as the Qwrlln.  In their attempts to heal Hudson, the Qwrlln integrate his battle suit into his body, fusing it to his biological and nervous systems.  

Hudson eventually returns to Earth and takes the name '''Vindicator''', leaving the title of '''Guardian''' (and position of leadership) with his wife, [[Vindicator|Heather]].  Again, Hudson's time with the team is cut short when the Qwrlln summon him (and a select group of heroes) to protect their planet against [[Galactus]]. As before, Hudson seemingly perishes when his suit detonates while transporting the heroes back home. However, during the explosion Hudson is transported to an alternate dimension.  After some time, he eventually returns to Earth.

While again working for Department H, Jamie becomes caught up in the nefarious plans of its new director, General Jeremy Clarke.  Scientists working for Clarke clone Jamie, steal his memories, and attempt to shoot his body into outer space. The plan does not succeed, though, as Hudson crash lands in [[Antarctica]].

A seemingly de-aged Hudson reappears to the members of Alpha Flight. This is in fact the clone created by Department H. The original Jamie is eventually found by [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]] in Antarctica. After his return he once again becomes team leader while, the clone becomes leader of [[Beta Flight]].  Later, both Hudsons are captured by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|AIM]], and the clone is killed in the escape.

Along with several other members of Alpha Flight, Hudson attempts to return a clutch of [[Plodex]] eggs to their homeworld. However, an accident brings temporal copies of most of the original Alpha Flight - from a time before Hudson's first "death" - to the present. This group, including James Hudson, takes up the role of Alpha Flight.

===Beyond===
Alpha Flight (the team consisting of [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]], [[Guardian (Marvel Comics)|Guardian]], [[Vindicator]], [[Shaman (comics)|Shaman]], [[Major Mapleleaf|Major Mapleleaf II]], and both [[Puck (comics)|Puck]]s) are brutally attacked by a new villain, "[[Xorn|the Collective]]"<ref>''[[Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' #16</ref>.  Their bodies are left in the [[Yukon Territory]] as the Collective continues on to the United States. The exact status of these heroes is unknown.

''Alpha Flight'' will be relaunched as ''[[Omega Flight]]'' in 2007.  The new series will be written by [[Michael Avon Oeming]] and drawn by [[Scott Kolins]].  Guardian's battle suit is clearly visible in the promotional art for the new team, although who is wearing the suit has not been announced.

==Powers and abilities==

Formerly, Guardian used a skintight technological suit which allowed him to fly, fire energy blasts and has a personal force field for defense. Perhaps his most spectacular power was his ability to suspend his positioning relative to the Earth's electromagnetic field while the planet rotated, allowing him to travel West at high speed depending on his [[latitude]] positioning.

When he returned from space, the technology that formerly existed as a separate part of his suit was incorporated into his body.  As a result, his powers were greatly enhanced.

Guardian's power suit allows for:  

*increased strength and durability;
*[[cybernetic]] link-up and hacking abilities;
*advanced weapons systems, including (but not limited to) [[electromagnetic]] projectors, concussive beams, [[ultrasonic]] beams, and a graviton beam;
*increased intelligence due to the fusion of his battle suit to his neural network;
*increased speed, reaching [[Mach number|Mach]] 1;
*ability to create and travel through a wormhole.
* the ability to lock himself relative to the Earth's electromagnetic field.  This allowed him to apparently vanish, while actually being whisked west at incredible speeds.
