'''Guardian''' ('''James "Mac" MacDonald Hudson'''), also known as '''Weapon Alpha''' and '''Vindicator''', is a [[fictional character]], a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[superhero]] in the {{Marvel Universe}} who was the leader of [[Alpha Flight]]. He was created by [[John Byrne]], and first appeared in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #109 which was co-plotted by Byrne and his long-time collaborator [[Chris Claremont]]. He was designed to be the Canadian equivalent of [[Captain America]], hence his costume markings are modeled after the [[Canadian flag]]. 

==Publication history==
Guardian first appeared in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #109 (February, 1978). He appeared as a member in the first 12 issues of ''Alpha Flight'' vol. 1.

==Fictional character biography==
James MacDonald Hudson was born in [[London, Ontario]]<ref>[http://marvel.com/universe/Guardian_%28James_Hudson%29 marvel.com/universe/Guardian]</ref><ref>[http://marvel.wikia.com/James_Hudson_%28Earth-616%29 marvel.wikia.com/James_Hudson]</ref>, [[Canada]].  He is a leading petrochemical engineer and scientist for the ''Am-Can Corporation'' developing a [[powered armor|powered exoskeleton suit]]. When he learns that his work will be used for American military purposes, Hudson raids his workplace, steals the prototype suit and destroys the plans. He leaves the suit to be recovered (albeit without the vital control helmet, which he built before coming to the company) and fully expects to be sued and arrested for his actions.

However, Hudson's girlfriend, [[Vindicator (comics)|Heather MacNeil]], uses political connections in the [[Canadian government]] to persuade ''Am-Can'' to waive the charges against him.  As a result, [[Department H]] is formed, a secret branch of the Canadian Department of National Defence, and Hudson is named as head of operations.  Inspired by the debut of the [[Fantastic Four]], Hudson forms Alpha Flight as a superhero team for the Canadian government and develops his exoskeleton into a battle suit.

As '''Weapon Alpha''', Hudson sought to capture [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], who had left Canada and joined the [[X-Men]]. He accidentally injured [[Moira MacTaggert]] in the process.<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 1 #109</ref> He then led Alpha Flight in battle against the X-Men to capture Wolverine.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #120-121</ref> After that mission failed, he made no further attempts to forcibly return Wolverine to Canada.

With the cancellation of Department H and its funding, Alpha Flight is temporarily disbanded.
Hudson laments this for a time, but then is called to action by the arrival of the [[Great Beasts|Great Beast]] [[Tundra (Marvel Comics)|Tundra]]. He sets out alone, but Heather takes it upon herself to summon the rest of Alpha Flight, plus two recently "gold-striped" members. The team defeats Tundra, and then summarily decides to reform, albeit without direct Government support.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' Vol. 1 #1</ref>

Hudson and Alpha Flight retain their security clearances, and status as RCMP Auxiliaries. They have a series of adventures, both as a team and as individuals. Early on, Hudson expresses a lack of confidence in himself, but slowly gains same over time. For example, his initial reaction to the imposing creature; the [[Wendigo (comics)|Wendigo]], has him expressing fear. Nevertheless, he confronts the creature "like a super-hero borne".

Though Hudson and his wife initially struggle as any Canadian middle-class couple do, he is soon offered a plum job with Roxxon, in New York City. Hudson's tenure with Alpha Flight, however, is short-lived. Relocated to New York, Hudson is almost immediately trapped and set upon by the original (evil) incarnation of Omega Flight and an old foe: his old boss [[Jerry Jaxon]]. The battle is soon joined by the rest of Alpha Flight, though it does not end well for Hudson.

Although seemingly killed when his battle-suit explodes due to the strain of energizing a multiple teleportation matrix system (thanks to Jaxon), he is in fact transported to Jupiter's moon, [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]]. There he meets an alien race known as the Qwrlln. In their attempts to heal Hudson, the Qwrlln integrate his battle suit into his body, fusing it to his biological and nervous systems. (This is originally posed as a ruse by [[Delphine Courtney]] to confuse and deceive Heather Hudson and the surviving members of Alpha Flight.)

Hudson eventually returns to Earth and takes the name '''Vindicator''', leaving the title of '''Guardian''' (and position of leadership) with his wife, [[Vindicator (comics)|Heather]].  Again, Hudson's time with the team is cut short when the Qwrlln summon him (and a select group of heroes) to protect their planet against [[Galactus]]. As before, Hudson seemingly perishes when his suit detonates while transporting the heroes back home. However, during the explosion Hudson is transported to an alternate dimension. After some time, he eventually returns to Earth.

While again working for Department H, Hudson becomes caught up in the plans of its new director, General Jeremy Clarke.  Scientists working for Clarke clone Hudson, steal his memories, and attempt to shoot his body into outer space. The plan does not succeed, though, as Hudson crash lands in [[Antarctica]].

A seemingly de-aged Hudson reappears to the members of Alpha Flight. This is in fact the clone created by Department H. The original Hudson is eventually found by [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]] in Antarctica. After his return he once again becomes team leader while the clone becomes leader of [[Beta Flight]]. Later, both Hudsons are captured by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|AIM]], and the clone is killed in the escape.

Along with several other members of Alpha Flight, Hudson attempts to return a clutch of Plodex eggs to their home-world. However, an accident brings temporal copies of most of the original Alpha Flight - from a time before Hudson's first "death" - to the present. This group, including James Hudson, takes up the role of Alpha Flight while the original ones are helping to rebuild the Plodex homeworld.

Alpha Flight ([[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]], [[Major Mapleleaf|Major Mapleleaf II]], [[Puck (comics)|Puck Jr.]], and the time-displaced versions of Guardian, [[Vindicator (comics)|Vindicator]], [[Shaman (comics)|Shaman]], and [[Puck (comics)|Puck]]) is brutally attacked by [[Xorn|The Collective]].<ref>''[[Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' #16</ref> Their bodies are left in the [[Yukon Territory]] as the Collective continues on to the United States.  The time-displaced Guardian was later confirmed dead by Sasquatch, while the original Guardian is presumably still on the Plodex homeworld with the other members of Alpha Flight.

The Guardian suit was worn by [[Michael Pointer (comics)|Michael Pointer]] during his run in [[Omega Flight]] before joining [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]]'s [[Dark X-Men]] as Weapon Omega.

During the ''[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]'' storyline, Guardian (alongside Vindicator, [[Shaman (comics)|Shaman]], and [[Marrina Smallwood]]) is among the heroes that return from the dead following what happened to the death realms. He reunites Alpha Flight to fight the Great Beasts.<ref>''Chaos War: Alpha Flight'' #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Formerly, Guardian used a skintight technological "battle-suit" composed of steel mesh and serves as an exoskeleton, which allowed him to fly, fire energy blasts and has a personal force field for defense. The suit design stems from a geological/oil-exploration exo-suit designed by Hudson during his early career. The original suit was clunky, over-large and awkward, though it did have an energy beam "weapon" system, ostensibly used for drilling/tunneling.
The skin-tight suit is considered to be a later, possibly 2nd or 3rd generation, evolution of the original design. The battle-suit is cybernetically controlled and contains a high resolution navigation system. The battle-suit permits flight by directing beams of force towards the ground, propelling the wearer forward at up to Mach 1. 

Guardian could cause the battle-suit computers to trigger and release gravitons, canceling the Earth's rotation relative to himself, propelling himself forwards at up to about 1000 miles per hour (at the equator). This effect will suspend his positioning relative to the Earth's electromagnetic field while the planet rotated, allowing him to travel West at high speed depending on his [[latitude]] positioning.

When he returned from space, the technology of the suit that formerly existed as a separate part of him was incorporated into his body. The alien Qwrlln converted James Hudson into a cyborg incorporating much of his battle-suit; some of his mechanical parts were visible on the surface of his body. As a result, his powers were greatly enhanced. Hudson's cyborg brain was half-organic (portions of his original brain) and half-mechanical. Hudson could control his mechanical systems by mental command, though he was vulnerable to being controlled by the Qwrlln through the mechanical portion of his brain. With great effort the human portion of his brain could override this control.

Guardian's power suit allows for:  

*increased strength and durability;
*[[cybernetic]] link-up and hacking abilities;
*advanced weapons systems, including (but not limited to) [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] pulse projectors, beams of concussive energy from the gauntlets, bolts of plasma, [[Ultrasound|ultrasonic]] beams, and a graviton beam;
*increased intelligence due to the fusion of his battle suit to his neural network;
*increased speed, reaching [[Mach number|Mach]] 1;
*ability to create and travel through a wormhole.
* the ability to lock himself relative to the Earth's electromagnetic field. Essentially, he cancels out the effects of the Earth's rotation upon himself. This allowed him to apparently "vanish", while actually being whisked westward at the speed of the planet's rotation.
*the creation of a protective force field that dampens inertia and absorbs energy;

Hudson has earned a Ph. D in engineering, and is a brilliant engineer and inventor, and a good battle strategist and leader.

==Other versions==
*On Earth-2149, a zombified Guardian can be seen attacking the X-Men alongside zombified versions of Alpha Flight. He is killed when [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] scalps him with a metal blade. His body can later be seen being examined by [[Reed Richards]] on the S.H.I.E.L.D. [[Helicarrier]].
*On Earth-3240, where the Cold War never ended, Guardian was Heather Hudson's second husband.  (Her previous husband was [[Wolverine (comics)|Logan]], whom she had killed while under the control of Weapon X.) This Guardian has much the same powers as the Earth-616 Guardian.


The [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Universe]] version of Hudson is a non-powered Gulf war veteran and sheriff of Port St. Lucie, Florida, and was acquainted with Wolverine, who also introduced him to his wife Heather. Wolverine also entrusted him with raising his son from an unknown mother, who was also named James Hudson and manifested a healing factor and claws like his father in [[Ultimate Comics X]].

==In other media==
===Television===
* Hudson appears in the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' animated series under the codename Vindicator, voiced by [[Barry Flatman]].

===Video games===
* Guardian also appears as an NPC in ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]'' voiced by [[Jim Ward (voice actor)|Jim Ward]]. He and Vindicator are encountered in an abandoned Weapon X facility. He has special dialogue with [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]].
