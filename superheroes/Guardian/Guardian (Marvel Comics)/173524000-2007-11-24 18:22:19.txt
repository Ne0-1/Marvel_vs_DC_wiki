'''Guardian''' ('''James "Mac" MacDonald Hudson'''), also known as '''Weapon Alpha''' and '''Vindicator''', is a [[fictional character]], a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[superhero]] in the {{Marvel Universe}} who was the leader of [[Alpha Flight]]. He was created by [[John Byrne]], and first appeared in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #109 which was co-plotted by Byrne and his long-time collaborater [[Chris Claremont]]. He was designed to be the Canadian equivalent of [[Captain America]], hence his costume markings are modelled after the [[Canadian flag]]. 

==Publication history==
Guardian first appeared in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #109 (February, [[1978]]). He appeared as a member in the first 12 issues of ''Alpha Flight'' vol. 1.

==Fictional character biography==
===Early work===
James MacDonald Hudson was born in [[London, Ontario]], [[Canada]].  He is a leading scientist for the ''Am-Can Corporation'' developing a [[powered armor|powered exo-skeleton suit]]. When he learns that his work will be used for American military purposes, Hudson raids his workplace, steals the prototype suit and destroys the plans. He leaves the suit to be recovered (albeit without the vital control helmet) and fully expects to be sued and arrested for his actions.

However, Hudson's girlfriend, [[Vindicator|Heather MacNeil]], uses political connections in the [[Canadian government]] to persuade ''Am-Can'' to waive the charges against him.  As a result, [[Department H]] is formed, a secret branch of the Canadian Ministry of Defense, and Hudson is named as head of operations.  Inspired by the debut of the [[Fantastic Four]], Hudson forms Alpha Flight as a superhero team for the Canadian government and develops his exo-skeleton into a battle suit.

===Alpha Flight===
With the cancellation of Department H and its funding, Alpha Flight is temporarily disbanded.
Hudson laments this for a time, but then is called to action by the arrival of the Great Beast [[Tundra (Marvel Comics)|Tundra]]. He sets out alone, but Heather takes it upon herself to summon the rest of Alpha Flight, plus two recently "gold-striped" members. The team defeats Tundra, and then summarily decides to reform, albeit without direct Government support.

Hudson and Alpha Flight retain their security clearances, and status as RCMP Auxiliaries. They have a series of adventures, both as a team and as individuals. Early on, Hudson expresses a lack of confidence in himself, but slowly gains same over time. For example, his initial reaction to the imposing creature; the Wendigo, has him expressing fear. Nevertheless, he confronts the creature "like a super-hero borne".

Though Hudson and his wife initially struggle as any Canadian middle-class couple do, he is soon offered a plum job with Roxxon, in New York City. Hudson's tenure with Alpha Flight, however, is short lived. Relocated to New York, Hudson is almost immediately trapped and set upon by an old foe and the original (evil) incarnation of Omega Flight. The battle is soon joined by the rest of Alpha flight, though it does not end well for Hudson.

Although seemingly killed when his battlesuit explodes (thanks to [[Jerry Jaxon]]), he is in fact transported to Jupiter's moon, [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]].  There he meets an alien race known as the Qwrlln.  In their attempts to heal Hudson, the Qwrlln integrate his battle suit into his body, fusing it to his biological and nervous systems. (This is originally posed as a ruse by Delphine Courtney to confuse and deceive Heather Hudson and the surviving members of Alpha Flight.)

Hudson eventually returns to Earth and takes the name '''Vindicator''', leaving the title of '''Guardian''' (and position of leadership) with his wife, [[Vindicator|Heather]].  Again, Hudson's time with the team is cut short when the Qwrlln summon him (and a select group of heroes) to protect their planet against [[Galactus]]. As before, Hudson seemingly perishes when his suit detonates while transporting the heroes back home. However, during the explosion Hudson is transported to an alternate dimension. After some time, he eventually returns to Earth.

While again working for Department H, Hudson becomes caught up in the plans of its new director, General Jeremy Clarke.  Scientists working for Clarke clone Hudson, steal his memories, and attempt to shoot his body into outer space. The plan does not succeed, though, as Hudson crash lands in [[Antarctica]].

A seemingly de-aged Hudson reappears to the members of Alpha Flight. This is in fact the clone created by Department H. The original Hudson is eventually found by [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]] in Antarctica. After his return he once again becomes team leader while the clone becomes leader of [[Beta Flight]].  Later, both Hudsons are captured by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|AIM]], and the clone is killed in the escape.

Along with several other members of Alpha Flight, Hudson attempts to return a clutch of [[Plodex]] eggs to their homeworld. However, an accident brings temporal copies of most of the original Alpha Flight - from a time before Hudson's first "death" - to the present. This group, including James Hudson, takes up the role of Alpha Flight.

===Death===
Alpha Flight (the team consisting of [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]], [[Guardian (Marvel Comics)|Guardian]], [[Vindicator (comics)|Vindicator]], [[Shaman (comics)|Shaman]], [[Major Mapleleaf|Major Mapleleaf II]], and both [[Puck (comics)|Puck]]s) are brutally attacked by a new villain, "[[Xorn#The Collecive|The Collective]]"<ref>''[[Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' #16</ref>. Their bodies are left in the [[Yukon Territory]] as the Collective continues on to the United States. All but Sasquatch are killed, including James Hudson <ref name="CivilWar:TheInitiative1">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]] | Penciller = [[Marc Silvestri]] | Inker = [[Joe Weems]] | Story = War | Title = Civil War: The Initiative | Issue = 1 |date= March 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>. The Guardian suit is now worn by [[Michael Pointer (comics)|Michael Pointer]].

==Powers and abilities==
[[Image:Guardian_Classic_X-Men.png|thumb|right|150px|Weapon Alpha surprises [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]. <br>Partial cover to <br>''Classic X-Men'' #16<br> Art by [[Art Adams]].]]
Formerly, Guardian used a skintight technological "battle-suit" which allowed him to fly, fire energy blasts and has a personal force field for defense. The suit design stems from a geological/oil-exploration exo-suit designed by Hudson during his early career. The original suit was clunky, over-large and awkward, though it did have an energy beam "weapon" system, ostensibly used for drilling/tunneling.
The skin-tight suit is considered to be a later, possibly 2nd or 3rd generation, evolution of the original design.
Perhaps his most spectacular power was his ability to suspend his positioning relative to the Earth's electromagnetic field while the planet rotated, allowing him to travel West at high speed depending on his [[latitude]] positioning.

When he returned from space, the technology of the suit that formerly existed as a separate part of him was incorporated into his body. As a result, his powers were greatly enhanced.

Guardian's power suit allows for:  

*increased strength and durability;
*[[cybernetic]] link-up and hacking abilities;
*advanced weapons systems, including (but not limited to) [[electromagnetic]] projectors, concussive beams, [[ultrasonic]] beams, and a graviton beam;
*increased intelligence due to the fusion of his battle suit to his neural network;
*increased speed, reaching [[Mach number|Mach]] 1;
*ability to create and travel through a wormhole.
* the ability to lock himself relative to the Earth's electromagnetic field. Essentially, he cancels out the effects of the Earth's rotation upon himself. This allowed him to apparently "vanish", while actually being whisked westward at the speed of the planet's rotation.

==Other versions==
*On Earth-2149, a zombified Guardian can be seen attacking the X-Men alongside zombified versions of Alpha Flight. He is killed when [[Magneto]] scalps him with a metal blade. His body can later be seen being examined by [[Reed Richards]] on the S.H.I.E.L.D. [[Helicarrier]].
*On Earth-3240, where the Cold War never ended, Guardian was Heather Hudson's second husband.  (Her previous husband was [[Wolverine (comics)|Logan]], whom she had killed while under the control of Weapon X.) This Guardian has much the same powers as the Earth-616 Guardian.

==In other media==
* Guardian appears in the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Barry Flatman]].

* Guardian also appears as an NPC in ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]'' voiced by [[Jim Ward (voice actor)|Jim Ward]].
