'''War''' ('''Abraham Lincoln Kieros''') is a fictional [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] villain in the [[Marvel Comics]] comics universe, most notable for being one of the original four horsemen of the villain [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]].

===Fictional character biography===
He was a young [[Vietnam War]] [[veteran]] that lost the ability to move in combat. He was kept in a hospital and placed in an [[iron lung]], but felt as though he was betrayed and forgotten by his country. Apocalypse appeared to him one day and offered him the ability to move and to get revenge on those who had tossed him aside.<ref>''X-Factor'' #11</ref> He accepted the offer and was indeed given the ability to move again, which allowed him to use his mutant power—the ability to create explosions through kinetic contact, usually by clapping his hands together—in Apocalype’s service as his Horseman of War. He often bickered with one of the other Horsemen, [[Famine (comics)|Famine]], and disliked her total lack of obedience.

War liked to take control of situations and during their first confrontation with [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], attempted to lead the other Horsemen. Famine and [[Plague (comics)|Pestilence]] refused to obey his orders and flew off to do their own business. Soon after, [[Archangel (comics)|Death]] took over leadership and the Four Horsemen learned to ride as one. During the attack on [[Manhattan]], War immediately attacked [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and was later teleported back to the ship by Apocalypse, where he fought several more X-Factor members. He was eventually defeated by [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]]. Apocalypse then grabbed War and fled.

Later, during the [[X-Cutioner's Song]] story arc, War attacked [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] and Iceman, but soon fled after [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]] grabbed [[Jean Grey]] and Cyclops, handing them over to Apocalypse, who was really [[Mr. Sinister]] in disguise. The [[X-Men]] sought out the Horsemen and War was presumably defeated in combat. Much later, War was apparently abandoned by Apocalypse and left in the hospital, once again paralyzed from the neck down. Archangel took his newfound powers and healed War of his wounds, giving him hope to start over with a new life.

===Other versions===
====Age of Apocalypse====
War appeared in the [[Age of Apocalypse]] as a member of Apocalypse’s first wave of Horsemen. It is unknown what happened to him but he may have been usurped by one of the current Horsemen.  

====Mutant X====
War also is seen in ''[[Mutant X]]'', where he constantly bickered with Death, but they had a mutual respect for each other.

===In other media===
====Television====
War appeared in three episodes of the [[X-Men (TV series)|''X-Men'' animated series]]: the first, “Come the Apocalypse,” where War was selected by Apocalypse and transformed into his Horseman; the second and third, “Beyond Good and Evil,” Parts 3 and 4, where he fought alongside the other Horsemen when the X-Men sought out Apocalypse’s Lazarus chamber. Instead of using his mutant abilities in the latter two episodes, he used an energy-projected sword.

'''War''' is a fictional [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe, and the earliest depiction of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse’s]] Horsemen.

===Fictional character biography===
Not much is known about this incarnation of War. He was chosen by Apocalypse sometime during the fifteenth century to become his horseman and lead his army, the Riders of the Dark. This army was so fierce and powerful that most people presumed it was just a myth used to scare soldiers before their first battle. It was no myth at all, and it precisely was what people thought it was, fierce and strong. In most of their battles, the only soldier who had to fight was War, who would single-handedly defeat hordes of men just by himself.

In [[1459]], the Riders of the Dark appeared in [[Romania]] where [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Vlad Ţepeş]]’ army was fighting against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] and emerged victorious. Unfortunately for Vlad (AKA Dracula), War defeated Dracula’s army. The survivors fled for their life, abandoning Dracula on the field who stood his ground and faced War but ultimately fell.
