The '''Crime Master''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain]] and an enemy of [[Spider-Man]]. Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]], he first appears in ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #26 ([[1965#July|July 1965]]). The character was most notable for being the partner of the [[Green Goblin]]. Both villains aspired to take over the criminal mobs of New York and formed an uneasy partnership. They were both aware of the other's secret identity which kept them from outwardly betraying the other. The Crime Master only lasted one issue and was killed in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #27; however, there was a second Crime Master in the 1970s and new stories were written in the pages of ''[[Untold Tales of Spider-Man]]'' that featured the original character before his death.

==Publication history==
The Crime Master debuted in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #26, his identity unknown. He was killed and revealed as Nick "Lucky" Lewis after his death. His son, Nick Lewis Jr. became the Second Crime Master in ''Marvel Team Up'' #39 ([[1975#November|November 1975]]) and #40 and teamed up with the second ''Big Man''. This Crime Master did not know the identity of his partner and betrayed and shot to death the Big Man, who turned out to be his girlfriend Janice Foswell, daughter of [[Frederick Foswell]], the original Big Man, after unmasking. Devastated by the discovery, Nick Lewis Jr. has not appeared as The Crime Master since.

The original Crime Master was also featured in an untold story from before his death in ''Untold Tales of Spider-Man'' #23 ([[1997#August|August 1997]]) and again in ''Untold Tales of Spider-Man'' #25. That issue is somewhat controversial as it alters the storyline from ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #26-27. This story shows the Crime Master and Green Goblin reveal their identities to each other. The Goblin, however, is wearing a mask of [[J. Jonah Jameson]] under his Goblin mask so as to suggest that The Crime Master really believed that Jameson was the Goblin instead of Norman Osborn. This does not make sense in the continuity of ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #26 as thought bubbles reveal that the Goblin is concerned about The Crime Master revealing his identity.
