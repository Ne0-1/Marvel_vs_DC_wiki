===Squadron Supreme (I)===
This Shape of [[Earth-712]] possesses a malleable, putty-like body. He can stretch his arms, legs, and neck out to a distance of several yards, and can sculpt his mass into simple geometric forms, such as turning his hands into mallets or taking the shape of a hang-glider. Little has been disclosed about Shape's origins. Although he appears to be an adult male, his emotional and intellectual development is comparable to that of a child (it's likely that he has some kind of [[mental disability]]). Originally, he was a member of the [[Institute of Evil]], the Squadron's arch-foes, but eventually chose to side with the heroes. 

The original members of the Squadron Supreme are transparently obvious imitations of [[Justice League]] heroes. As a result, many  casual readers of the Squadron's exploits in recent years have noted Shape's ductile powers and playful nature and erroneously extrapolated that he was created expressly to serve as a counterpart for the JLA comic-relief character, [[Plastic Man]]. In actuality, the addition of Shape to the Squadron predates Plastic Man's inclusion in the League by a decade. [[Mark Gruenwald]] added Shape and a number of heroes to the team during the course of the ''Squadron Supreme'' limited series that ran from 1985&ndash;1986, none of which were intended to be derivative of any particular JLA character. His ambition was to elevate the team above its roots as a mere "JLA rip-off" and provide it with a more distinct identity.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

===Supreme Power (II)===

In Part III: High Command, Shape is introduced as Raleigh Lund, a dim-witted, morbidly obese former janitor abandoned as a child by his parents.  He survived from a very early age by eating discarded food and sleeping in dumpsters. He possesses superhuman strength and apparent invulnerability. He is described as the perfect soldier -- loyal, invulnerable, and strong -- though he is quite lacking in the area of independent thought and strategy.  In [[Supreme Power]], Shape is very similar in powers to [[Blob (comics)|Blob]].
