'''Shape''' is a [[Marvel comics]] [[comic book]] character created by [[Mark Gruenwald]], possibly based on [[DC Comics]] [[Elongated Man]].

==Various incarnations of Shape==

===Squadron Supreme===
The ability to stretch his body to suit his needs, although not to the degree of [[Plastic Man]] or [[Mister Fantastic]],he could also change into simple geometric forms;such as mallets
for hands and a hang-glider capable of carrying a grown man,he was a member of '''Institute of Evil Members''', the Squadron's version of the [[Secret Society of Super-Villains]].

===Supreme Power===
In Part III: High Command, Shape is introduced as Raleigh Lund, a dim-witted, morbidly obese former janitor abandoned as a child by his parents.  He survived from a very early age by eating discarded food and sleeping in dumpsters. He possesses superhuman strength and apparent invulnerability. He is described as the perfect solder -- loyal, invulnerable, and strong -- though he is quite lacking in the area of independent thought and strategy.  In [[Supreme Power]], Shape is very similar in powers to [[Blob (comics)|Blob]].
