==Fictional character biography==
{{Plot|section|date=November 2010}}
Harry Osborn is the son of [[Norman Osborn]] and [[List of Marvel Comics characters: O#Emily Osborn|Emily Osborn]]. The circumstances of Harry's birth weakened Emily and she died after several years of illness. Heartbroken, Norman becomes a cold and unloving father; he either contemptuously dismisses Harry, or lashes out at him in fury.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man Annual'' #14</ref> As a result, Harry spends much of his life trying desperately to earn his father's approval.

Upon graduating from high school, he enrolls in [[Empire State University]]. Among the wealthiest students in the school, Harry soon becomes one of the most popular as well, despite his aloof manner. He has a clique of rich, popular students around him; one of these is the lovely [[Gwen Stacy]]. Gwen is intrigued by a new student: bookish, studious and painfully-shy Peter Parker. Harry takes a dislike to Parker; he resents the attention Gwen gives to Peter, and he assumes that Peter's standoffishness is snobbery. After confronting Parker, Harry realizes that Peter is merely shy, and is also worried about his ailing aunt [[Aunt May|May Parker]]. Despite this rocky start, Harry and Peter became friends, eventually sharing an apartment.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Harry does not realize that his best friend is the [[superhero]] [[Spider-Man]], nor that his father became the [[supervillain]] the [[Green Goblin]] in an accident while attempting to create a super-serum. Moreover, before he became friends with Harry, Spider-Man was unmasked and captured by the Green Goblin.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #39 (August 1966)</ref> During the subsequent battle, an electric shock removed all memory of being the Green Goblin from Norman's mind. Spider-Man then hid all evidence of Norman's double identity, to keep Harry from being hurt by the revelation.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #40 (September 1966)</ref>

However, Norman's Green Goblin persona resurfaces from time to time. These are difficult times for Harry, as his father's periodic episodes are unexplainable. He had experimented with drugs in his teens, but he escalates his usage, as well as trying ever-harder substances. This affects his mental stability and his relationships with his friends. Spider-Man uses this to his advantage during one battle with Green Goblin; he is able to stop the fight by showing Norman his son's emaciated condition, brought on by an accidental [[cocaine]] overdose. The sight shocks Norman so much that it brings him back to sanity.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #98 (July 1971)</ref>

===Green Goblin===
[[File:Amazingspider136.jpg|200px|thumb|Harry Osborn as the new Green Goblin, battling Spider-Man on the cover of ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #136 by [[John Romita, Sr.]]]]
Harry is dumped by [[Mary Jane Watson]], who has become fed up with his self-destructive lifestyle. Disconsolate, Harry turns to drugs and suffers an [[amphetamine]] overdose. He survives, but this tragedy, compounded by imminent [[bankruptcy]], drives his father over the edge. He [[kidnaps]] Gwen as bait for Spider-Man, and then throws her off the [[George Washington Bridge]] (or [[Brooklyn Bridge]]). In a vicious battle with Spider-Man, the Green Goblin accidentally impales himself on his own [[goblin glider]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #121-122 (June-July 1973)</ref> Harry Osborn secretly witnesses this. Wanting to protect his father's identity, he strips Norman Osborn's body of the Green Goblin costume to hide. Blaming Spider-Man for his father's "murder", Harry, angry and mentally unbalanced, swears vengeance. Having inherited his father's company, Harry manages to get the business back in shape. One day, to his shock, he finds a Spider-Man costume in Peter Parker's apartment and realizes that his best friend is the man he blames for his father's death. Using his father's old equipment, Harry confronts Peter as the new [[Green Goblin]].<ref>''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #136</ref>

Not wanting to hurt Harry, Peter avoids fighting his old friend. After Spider-Man is able to thwart Harry's initial attempt on his life, Harry is knocked unconscious and taken into police custody. There, he raves that he is the true Green Goblin and Peter Parker is Spider-Man, but is dismissed as a lunatic. He is put in the care of criminal psychologist Dr. Bart Hamilton, who extracts the Green Goblin secrets from Harry through [[hypnosis]], and buries the knowledge deep within Harry's mind. Hamilton then raids one of Harry's hideouts and becomes the third [[Green Goblin#Bart Hamilton|Green Goblin]]. Meanwhile Harry is released and considered cured. He sustains a concussion that makes him forget his knowledge of Spider-Man's identity and he and Peter rekindle their friendship.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

For a while, Harry's life seems back on track; his company begins turning [[Profit (accounting)|profits]] once more, and he develops a romance with [[Liz Allan]], whom he meets at the wedding of [[Betty Brant]] and [[Ned Leeds]]. Not long after the two are married, and eventually they have [[Normie Osborn|a son]] named in memory of the boy's grandfather. Harry also gives his blessing to the marriage of Peter and Mary Jane Watson. However, Harry starts regaining his memories when he is blackmailed by the original [[Roderick Kingsley|Hobgoblin]] (Roderick Kingsley) with a package which contains evidence that his father was the original Green Goblin. When Hobgoblin learns he had raided all of Norman's hideouts, he leaves Harry alone, knowing he had nothing more to offer him. Later, Harry is forced to act as Green Goblin a few times, once to defeat the second [[Jason Macendale|Hobgoblin]] (Jason Macendale). This Hobgoblin is seeking the Green Goblin formula that gave the Green Goblin superhuman strength; Harry is able to defeat him by doubling back during an aerial chase and emptying his entire supply of pumpkin bombs onto Hobgoblin. Harry even wonders if he could use the Green Goblin persona for a career as a superhero but Peter convinces him that Green Goblin had too much baggage for such a role. Harry buries the Green Goblin menace within his mind once more and focuses on his business and family.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

===Death===
[[File:Harryosborndeath.jpg|thumb|right|175px|The death of Harry Osborn.]]
This tranquility is shattered when the aftereffects of the "[[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]]" crisis sunder the barrier between Harry Osborn's conscious and [[subconscious]] minds. Once again, he remembers being Green Goblin - and his hatred of Spider-Man. Harry has now convinced himself that Peter Parker resents the Osborns' "stable family life" due to never having been wanted by his own parents or guardians, when in fact it was the complete opposite. He uses Peter's trust in him to capture him, and subjects him to hallucinogenic gases to psychologically torment him.<ref>''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #180-181</ref> He finds himself unsatisfied with this revenge, however, and decides to kill Spider-Man. However, given the opportunity he proves unwilling to kill his best friend.<ref>''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #182-183</ref>

Harry investigates his father's old hideouts and notes, and finally uncovers and ingests the formula for the original Green Goblin's superhuman strength. He then kidnaps his wife, son, and brother-in-law [[Mark Raxton]], terrorizing them in an old family mansion. Raxton manages to signal their location to Spider-Man, who defeats the Green Goblin and turns him in to the police.<ref>''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #189</ref> Spider-Man pushes for Harry to get psychiatric treatment from Dr. Ashley Kafka, but he is ultimately transferred to [[Vault (comics)|the Vault]].<ref>''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #190</ref> However, the state is unable to put together a sufficient case against Harry, and after just a few weeks in prison he is released.<ref>''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #199</ref>

Harry discovers that his father developed an advanced version of the Green Goblin strength formula, but was unable to test it before his final battle with Spider-Man. After testing it, he ingests the new formula. When he spies Spider-Man investigating his townhouse, Harry loses his temper and attacks him as the Green Goblin. He injects Peter with a drug that leaves him immobile and, in a fit of depression, activates timed explosives that he had planted throughout the townhouse, planning to kill both himself and Peter. However, when he realizes that Mary Jane and his son Normie are also in the townhouse, he is shocked back to his normal self. Harry rescues Mary Jane, Normie, and Peter before he collapses. He belatedly realizes that he did not test the new formula diligently enough, and that it is in fact lethal.<ref>''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #200</ref>

===Post-mortem===
Some time before his death, Harry Osborn created a computer system with copies of his and Norman Osborn's minds programmed into it; after Harry's death, the computer system activates and abducts [[Normie Osborn]] with the intent of subjecting him to the Green Goblin Serum (the same one that that caused Harry's death) to make into the newest Green Goblin. This computer facsimile of Harry and its robotic drones (which resemble female versions of Green Goblin) were all destroyed by Spider-Man and the [[Molten Man]] who manage to save Normie from it.<ref>''Spider-Man: Legacy Of Evil''</ref> However, Harry had one last trick up his sleeve. Some time before his final confrontation with Spider-Man, Harry had employed the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] to construct [[Life Model Decoy]]s of Peter's parents to play with his emotions. The plot ends with both constructs revealed as fakes when both "die", shattering Peter's mind. After nearly killing the Chameleon, Peter found a tape Harry had left before he died revealing his role in the plot and mocking Peter, demonstrating that Harry was as manipulative and cruel as his father when gripped by insanity. Peter goes temporarily insane from the shock, even briefly rejecting his identity until the return of his clone [[Ben Reilly]] snaps him back to reality.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

===Return from the grave===
It is subsequently revealed that Harry's supposed death is faked by [[Mysterio]] and his father who spirits his son away to Europe where he is held prisoner in several "rehab" clinics and believes that his son had relapsed into drug addiction, and this in turn led to his brief return to wearing the Green Goblin costume.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #581</ref>

At some point, Harry is released from rehab and reunites with his friends. However, because of the machinations of his father and the mindwipe of the world's knowledge of Spider-Man's secret identity by [[Doctor Strange|Dr. Strange]], [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] and [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]],{{clarify|date=September 2011}}<!--- The previous paragraph says Mephisto did the mindwipe - which is it? ---> Harry no longer remembers that Peter Parker is Spider-Man. His marriage to Liz Allan also disintegrates and the two divorce. Harry engages in a string of relationships, several of which result in Harry marrying and divorcing in rapid fashion. He is in a relationship with [[Menace (Marvel Comics)|Lily Hollister]]. Harry tries to help Lily's father in the latter's bid for Mayor of New York by funding her father's campaign with his dwindling finances.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Harry is also one of the leading suspects for the secret identity of the New Goblin. In the "New Ways to Die" story arc, [[Menace (Marvel Comics)|Menace]] battles Norman Osborn and is infuriated when Norman states that all he cares about is killing Spider-Man. Norman dons the Green Goblin costume and mentions that Harry has been in the Green Goblin's lair. Norman calls Harry who realizes from Norman's distorted voice that Norman is wearing the Green Goblin suit. This horrifies and disgusts Harry who vows to stop his father. Harry angrily confronts his father who wants Harry to follow his legacy and become a greater man. The confused Harry is saved by Spider-Man. Spider-Man, who wants to beat Norman senseless, stops when he sees an area for Human Testing. Harry is claimed to be the one responsible for the atrocious acts although he attempts to plead innocence. Harry later states that he wants to talk to Peter, who moments earlier was kissed by Lily, and is seen leaving with a mysterious canister labelled "Prometheus X-90".{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Prometheus X-90, it is revealed later, was developed as a successful cure for Mark Raxton's condition as Molten Man. The only human test subject was Charlie Weiderman, the short-lived second Molten Man, and the only person on whom the serum could be tested. After the cure is administered, Liz finally forgives Harry and gives him back the wedding ring, which she originally claimed she lost.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #582</ref>

Renting out all of [[Liberty Island]], Harry takes Lily there and, at the top of the [[Statue of Liberty]], he gets down on one knee and proposes to her.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #583</ref> Lily rejects his proposal because she is not sure where their relationship will lead, which surprises Harry. He later goes to her place to check up on her, and as he enters the room he is surprised to discover Lily wearing the Menace costume.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

She found a hidden door in his closet and one of his old journals. She begins giving him a hard time about whining so much about his father. Harry thinks her behavior is because she's sick. She continues to tell him she uncovered one of Norman's secret rooms described in the journal. This explains why she kissed Peter after the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] attacked; he almost found the secret trigger to open the room. When she first entered the room she found the Green Goblin's equipment and some experiments. Knocking over some chemicals, she absorbed them and is now able to transform at will. She explains that she discovered Menace's attacks against her father gives him more public support. She also tells him that she accepts his marriage proposal. After their talk, Harry enters one of his father's weapons caches, takes a glider (filled with bombs and winged bombs), a pair of Goblin gloves, a sword, and a dart gun containing an unknown chemical.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #586</ref> In the midst of a battle between Menace and Spider-Man, Harry confronts and shoots her with that chemical, which is a type of antidote that reverts her back to her human form. He saves Spider-Man from the crowd and leaves.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #588</ref> Lily is incarcerated but later escapes, leaving Harry her ring and a note.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

===''Dark Reign''===
Harry Osborn is approached by Norman Osborn with the offer of a job within his father's [[Dark Avengers|personal Avengers]]. Harry initially declines, but after a visit from Lily Hollister revealing that she is pregnant, he accepts.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #595</ref> Norman welcomes him into Avengers Tower and wants to make Harry into the '''[[Iron Patriot|American Son]]'''. Harry is shown to have an ulterior motive, however, based on his need to protect Lily and his child. Disabling the camera in his room, Harry sneaks off.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #596</ref> He finds a cure for Lilly's Green Goblin condition that will be safe for her and the baby but she pushes him away. Lily reveals that it is all a ruse to coerce Harry into become American Son, whom Norman would eventually have die in a tragedy to increase sympathy for Norman and his Avengers. She also reveals that the baby is not Harry's but in fact Norman's. In retalliation for this news, Harry dons his American Son armor and fights against his father using the [[Iron Patriot]] armor.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #598</ref>

During the battle, Norman declares that Harry is no longer his son and that he has bred a better child to replace the failure of Harry. After further taunts from Norman, Harry lashes out and defeats his father, declaring "I was never your son!". When Harry has the option of killing Norman, Spider-Man tells him to decapitate Norman, since Norman's healing factor may repair a blow to the head. Spider-Man states that killing Norman will cause Harry to "become the son Norman always wanted". Harry backs down, and walks away from Norman forever.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Harry is next seen in a psychiatrist's office, claiming to be getting over the effects of a medical treatment he received. The doctor offers to prescribe him [[oxycodone]] but it is not revealed if Harry takes the prescription.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #599</ref>

Afterwards, Harry is cut off financially and is forced out of his penthouse apartment. He moves into Peter's old room at May Parker's.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #604</ref> He also begins secretly dating Amy Reilly (Peter's cousin).<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #605</ref> After May returns and is corrupted by [[Mister Negative]], she kicks Harry out of the house, forcing him to move in with Mary Jane Watson.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #618-619</ref>

===Heroic Age===
After Norman Osborn's [[Siege (Marvel Comics)|fall]], the American Son armor is stolen and the police begin questioning Harry as only someone of the Osborn bloodline can use the American Son armor. Harry is then shot in the chest by [[Gabriel Stacy and Sarah Stacy|Gabriel Stacy]], claiming that Norman gave Harry a better life.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Presents: American Son'' #1</ref> However, Harry is saved by American Son and taken to a hospital. After Harry recovers from his wounds, he is escorted home by police. Fearing the damage that could be done with the American Son armor and perplexed by his encounter with Gabriel, Harry decides to figure things out on his own. After enlisting the help of a talented reporter named Norah from Frontline, Harry decides to visit Norman as only he would know about Gabriel. Harry and Norah eventually visit the [[The Raft (comics)|Raft]] where they find Norman in his cell consumed by madness. Harry demands to know about Gabriel but Norman is unresponsive. Frustrated, Harry and Norah begin to leave, but before they exit Norman briefly returns to his senses and tells Harry that Gabriel is indeed Norman's son.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Presents: American Son'' #2</ref>

Trying to make sense of everything, Harry visits May Parker's work where he plans to volunteer. On his way, he realizes that he is being followed by the FBI. It is then revealed through FBI security footage that Gabriel is the one who stole the American Son armor and has been using the armor all along. Meanwhile, Gabriel confronts the American Son armor and is revealed to have developed a split personality similar to Norman's after his exposure to the Green Goblin Serum. This split personality explains to Gabriel that it represents all that is good in his soul and will use the American Son armor to undo each of Gabriel's crimes. After an intense psychological battle, Gabriel appears to gain the upper hand and proceeds with his plan.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Still attempting to understand Gabriel's plans, Harry determines that in order for Gabriel to truly hurt him he will attempt to abduct an innocent person and lay a trap. Harry then rushes to find Norah. Meanwhile, the police arrive at Gabriel's hideout but are unable to rescue Norah because of the American Son's interference. Harry manages to sneak in through one of his father's secret tunnels and confronts his half-brother.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Presents: American Son'' #3</ref> As the police prepare to make another attempt to save Norah, Harry frees her and gets the young reporter to safety. With Norah out of harms way Gabriel and Harry engage in an epic battle. During the fight, Harry attempts to convince Gabriel that Norman is evil and that attempting to follow in his footsteps is madness. Gabriel refuses to listen and continues his attempts to kill Harry. Saddened by his brother's choice, Harry hacks the American Son armor and knocks Gabriel unconscious. The battle causes the warehouse to go up in flames, trapping Gabriel and Harry inside, but Spider-Man arrives and saves them. Afterward, Norah visits Harry in his coffee shop, and notices a bottle of oxycodone in Harry's things. Troubled by what she finds, Norah concludes that Harry has a drug problem and resolves to help him through it.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Presents: American Son'' #4</ref>

After many near encounters, [[Carlie Cooper]] and Peter Parker meet at the coffee shop. Harry and MJ are there and the four are talking when Lily bursts through the wall, followed by an attacking team of supervillains. MJ asks Harry to help Lily Hollister who's gone into labor, but they are held captive by [[Doctor Octopus]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #642</ref> Spider-Man manages to save them and rescue Lily's newborn baby from supervillains. Harry and MJ take Lily to get medical care, but Carlie was too angry with Lily to accompany them.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #643</ref> When Spider-Man secures the baby from Doctor Octopus he runs an analysis on a sample of the baby's DNA and finds it matches Harry. Spider-Man encourages Harry to raise his son on his own and start a new life.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #646</ref>  Soon thereafter, Harry prepares to leave New York with the baby named Stanley. At his going-away party, Harry encounters former NYPD officer [[Vin Gonzales]] reveals he has a [[Green Goblin#Goblin Gangs|Green Goblin tattoo]]. After Gonzales relays a message from Norman, Harry shocks the man with a taser and beats him.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #647</ref>

Months later, Harry is shown in Seattle, Washington, living with his son. He is shown to have completely changed his appearance, having shaved his head and grown a beard.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #697</ref>

After exposing himself to his father's formula, he takes the reins of the second [[Green Goblin]], causing him to become much stronger, cunning and agile. The glider he carries has swords, along with usual Goblin technology.

They became engaged, although she eventually called off their engagement realising she was in love with Peter. When Norman was apparently killed in an explosion at Oscorp, the [[Green Goblin]] began kidnapping the Oscorp board members. Harry was initially suspect to be Green Goblin, but it later turned out that his father had survived the explosion and was the villain himself. When Green Goblin became trapped in limbo, he managed to contact Harry. The visions of his father had him take the serum and exact revenge on [[Spider-Man]], with the villain promising to allow Harry to see his presumed deceased father. However, Spider-Man defeated the second Green Goblin and he was enrolled at Ravencroft to receive treatment. When Peter and Mary Jane were getting married, Harry discovered and his insanity broke out once again. He interrupted the wedding and threatened to destroy the church, trying to force Mary Jane to marry him instead of Peter. In the end, [[Liz Allan]] appeared to Harry, convincing him not to blow up the church nor marry Mary Jane. Told by Liz that he was loved, he walked away peacefully and the wedding resumed.

* Harry Osborn appears in ''[[Spider-Man: The New Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Ian Ziering]]. Pictured as a blonde, this version constantly blames Spider-Man for his father's death but shows signs of beginning to put the grudge aside in later episodes.

* Harry Osborn appears in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', voiced by [[James Arnold Taylor]]. This version is Peter Parker's best friend and high school classmate. While constantly trying to appease his father Norman Osborn, Harry takes the 'Globulin Green' serum to boost his physical abilities but apparently causes the development of a second personality which symbolizes his notion of "the man his father wanted him to be". Following several battles, Spider-Man comes to believe Harry is the series' iteration of [[Green Goblin]] but allows Norman to look after his son. After being on a European tour to help break his addiction to the serum, Harry returned from his trip. After Flash Thompson exposed Harry's addiction to league administrators and loses the trophy their team won as a result, Harry destroys the remaining 'Globulin Green' vials he kept hidden. Soon after, Harry attempts to have a relationship with [[Gwen Stacy]] though she expressed some anger when he overheard her talking about breaking up with him to Peter. During the series finale, Harry learned the truth of Norman being the Green Goblin all along as he witnesses his fight with Spider-Man up to his father's supposed death. At his father's "funeral", Harry has Gwen stay in their relationship out of guilt and expresses intent to have revenge against Spider-Man. This storyline, however, was never resolved as copyright issues led to the show's premature cancellation.

* Harry Osborn appears in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' cartoon series, voiced by [[Matt Lanter]].<ref>http://marvel.toonzone.net/news.php?action=fullnews&id=770</ref> This version is portrayed as Peter Parker's best friend once again, [[Norman Osborn]]'s disappointment of a son, a student at Midtown High School, and this series' first incarnation of '''[[Venom (comics)|Venom]]'''. In the first season, Harry is badly injured by [[Klaw (comics)|Klaw]] while trying to protect Mary Jane Watson from the [[Frightful Four]]. Harry is then jealous of Peter's [[Young Avengers|new friends]] so he throws a huge party that is crashed by the [[Venom (comics)|symbiote]]. After the symbiote's defeat, Harry captures a fragment. Harry bonds with the symbiote to be the Black Suit Spidey in an attempt to one-up Spider-Man and nearly wins over everyone (even [[J. Jonah Jameson]]) in the city. But the symbiote's personality takes over Harry and transforms into Venom until Spider-Man electrocutes and seemingly disintegrates the symbiote off Harry.

Learning that he is dying of the same terminal hereditary illness that killed his father, Harry attempts to ask Spider-Man for a blood sample, correctly deducing that Spider-Man's powers come from the genetically-engineered spiders that Oscorp created and have since been destroyed, but Spider-Man- both as Peter and Spider-Man- refuses, fearing that the transfusion could mutate Harry. Spider-Man insists that he needs time for research though Harry refuses to wait. When Harry is forced out of his own company as a scapegoat for their role in the creation of [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Max Dillon / Electro]], he breaks into Ravencroft to release Electro and asks for his aid. Electro causes a distraction while Harry uses VP [[Donald Menken]] to break into Oscorp's special projects division to recover the remaining venom samples and uses one which hideously mutates his physiology, steals a battle suit and a glider and becomes the "[[Green Goblin]]". He sets out to kill Spider-Man and he sees Gwen Stacy with him, and with knowledge that she and Peter have been dating, he realizes that Peter and Spider-Man are the same person.

* New Goblin appears in ''[[Spider-Man: Friend or Foe]]'', with Josh Keaton reprising his role. Similar to Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus and Spider-Man, New Goblin resembles his movie incarnation.

* Harry Osborn appears in 2014's ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014 video game)|The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]'', voiced by [[Kevin Dorman]].

During a party at night with Fisk, he was targeted by an assassin whom disguised as a bartender to poison Harry to death, and luckily his best friend Peter secretly noticed about the bartender as he bump to him by "accident" to save Harry from being killed. Before transforming himself into Goblin shortly to cure himself from a disease, Spider-Man and Peter Parker tries to warn Harry about the side effects of using Spider-Man's perfect cross-species blood without any time in research would turn him into a monster like Dr. Connors was as The Lizard. Harry didn't listen to them and stating it would be waste of time and he will find a cure himself. Harry foolishly uses a spider-venom that turns him into Green Goblin. Unlike in the movie when his transformation into Goblin has nearly begun, Harry still remained as the head of Oscorp after learning that Oscorp had Richard Parker's spider-venom while asking the scientist for the serum he will use that results his transformation into Goblin, as well as overhearing from his employers that Kingpin does want to take over Oscorp and had a chance to finish him off as long as Harry lives as the head of the company.
