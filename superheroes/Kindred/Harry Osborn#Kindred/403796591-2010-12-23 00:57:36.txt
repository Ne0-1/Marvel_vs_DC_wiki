==Fictional character biography==
{{tense|section|date=March 2008}}
{{Plot|section|date=November 2010}}
Harry is the son of industrialist [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] and his wife Emily.  Unfortunately, the circumstances of Harry's birth weakened Emily, and she died after several years of illness.  Heartbroken, Norman becomes a cold and unloving father; he either contemptuously dismisses Harry, or lashes out at him in fury.  Harry spends much of his life trying desperately to earn his father's approval.

Upon graduating from high school, he enrolls in [[Empire State University]].  Among the wealthiest students in the school, Harry soon becomes one of the most popular as well, despite his aloof manner.  He has a clique of rich, popular students around him; one of these is the lovely [[Gwen Stacy]].  Gwen is intrigued by a new student: bookish, studious and painfully-shy Peter Parker.  Harry takes a dislike to Parker; he resents the attention Gwen gives to Peter, and he assumes that Peter's standoffishness is snobbery.  After confronting Parker, Harry realizes that Peter is merely shy, and is also worried about his ailing aunt, [[Aunt May|May]].  Despite this rocky start, Harry and Peter became friends, eventually sharing an apartment.

Harry does not realize that Peter is the [[superhero]] Spider-Man.  Harry's father became the Green Goblin in an accident while attempting to create a super-serum.  Spider-Man and the Goblin had already battled twice when Peter and Harry become friends.  In a later battle, the Goblin discovers Spider-Man's identity and captures him, revealing his own identity in the process.  Horrified that his greatest enemy is also his best friend's father, Peter's loyalties are torn.  When the Goblin falls onto an electric transformer during the resulting fight, the shock removes all memory of being the Green Goblin from Norman Osborn's mind.  Spider-Man removes the Goblin's costume and equipment, hoping it will be the end of the Goblin menace, that Mr. Osborn will return to normal, and that no one else, especially Harry, will ever need to know the truth.

However, Norman's Green Goblin persona resurfaces from time to time; he then battles with Spider-Man, only to become Norman Osborn again when the fight is over.  These are difficult times for Harry, as his father's periodic episodes are unexplainable.  He had experimented with drugs in his teens, but he escalates his usage, as well as trying ever-harder substances.  This affects his mental stability and his relationships with his friends.  Spider-Man uses this to his advantage during one battle with the Green Goblin; he is able to stop the fight by showing Norman his son's emaciated condition, brought on by an accidental [[cocaine]] overdose. The sight shocks Norman so much that it brings him back to sanity for what is to be the last time.

It wasn't long after, though, that stress caused Norman to become the Green Goblin again. Harry's life had fallen apart. His relationship with Peter's friend [[Mary Jane Watson]] had come to an end when she dumped him, fed up with his self-destructive lifestyle. A disconsolate Harry turned to drugs and suffered an [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] overdose.  He survived, but this tragedy, compounded by imminent [[bankruptcy]], drove the Green Goblin over the edge. He [[kidnapping|kidnapped]] Gwen as bait for Spider-Man, and then threw her off the [[George Washington Bridge]]. When Peter pulled her back up with his webbing, she was dead. A vicious battle between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin ensued, with Peter barely able to control himself from killing the villain. The Goblin then directed his [[goblin glider]] to impale Spider-Man, but the wall-crawler jumped out of the way, and the Goblin was impaled through the chest himself, and seemingly killed. Peter was wracked with guilt and sorrow, but took comfort in the fact that the Green Goblin was finally gone.

===The Second Goblin===
[[Image:Amazingspider136.jpg|200px|thumb|Harry Osborn as the new Green Goblin, battling Spider-Man on the cover of ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #136 by [[Ross Andru]].]]
However, Harry had secretly witnessed the battle. Wanting to protect his father's identity, he stripped Norman's body of the Green Goblin costume and hid it. Blaming Spider-Man for his father's "[[murder]]," Harry swore vengeance. Having inherited his father's company, Harry managed to get the business back in shape as he planned his revenge. One day, to his shock, he found a Spider-Man costume in Peter's apartment, and realized that his best friend was the man he blamed for his father's death. Using his father's old equipment, Harry confronted Peter as the new Goblin.<ref>''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #136</ref>

Not wanting to hurt Harry, Peter avoided fighting his old friend. Eventually, Harry was knocked unconscious and taken into police custody. There, he raved that he was the true Green Goblin and Peter Parker was Spider-Man, but was dismissed as a lunatic. He was put in the care of criminal psychologist Dr. Bart Hamilton, who extracted the secrets of the Green Goblin from Harry through [[hypnosis]], and buried the knowledge deep with Harry's mind.  However, this was not altruistic on Hamilton's part - he then raided one of Harry's hideouts and became the [[Green Goblin#Bart Hamilton|third Green Goblin]], hoping to become the new boss of the underworld.  However, his power was no match for his enthusiasm - he never even bothered to use the strength-enhancing formulas on himself, seemingly believing that just ''being'' the Green Goblin would enable him to defeat Spider-Man, and, despite an elaborate plot to kill [[Silvermane (comics)|Silvermane]], the power-mad psychologist was killed by a bomb he had planted for Spider-Man.  Although he suffered a brief setback during the confrontation with Hamilton, Harry was released and considered cured, sustaining a concussion that made him forget his knowledge of Spider-Man's identity, and he and Peter rekindled their friendship.

For a while, Harry's life seemed back on track; his company began turning [[Profit (accounting)|profits]] once more, and he developed a romance with [[Liz Allan]], whom he met at the wedding of [[Betty Brant]] and [[Ned Leeds]].  Not long after, the two were married, and eventually they had a [[Normie Osborn|son]], whom Harry named Normie in memory of the boy's grandfather.  Harry also gave his blessing to the marriage of Peter and Mary Jane.  However, Harry started regaining his memories when he was being blackmailed by the [[Hobgoblin (comics)#Roderick Kingsley|original Hobgoblin]], who mailed him a package which contained evidence that his father was the original Green Goblin. When the Hobgoblin learned he had raided all of Norman's hideouts, he left Harry alone, knowing he had nothing more to offer him. Later, Harry was forced to act as the Green Goblin a few times, once to defeat [[Jason Macendale]], the second Hobgoblin. Macendale sought the Goblin formula that gave the Green Goblin superhuman strength; Harry was able to defeat Macendale by doubling back during an aerial chase and emptying his entire supply of pumpkin bombs onto the Hobgoblin. Harry even wondered if he could use the Goblin persona for a career as a superhero, but Peter convinced him that the Goblin had too much baggage for such a role, and Harry buried the Goblin menace within his mind once more, and focused on his business and family.

===Death===
[[Image:Harryosborndeath.jpg|thumb|left|175px|The death of Harry Osborn.]]
This tranquility was shattered when the aftereffects of the "[[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]]" crisis sundered the barrier between Harry's conscious and [[subconscious]] minds.  Once again, he remembered being the New Goblin - and his irrational hatred of Spider-Man (Harry had now convinced himself that Peter resented the Osborns' "stable family life" due to never having been wanted by his own parents or guardians, when in fact it was the complete opposite). His sanity shattered, he declared that their next confrontation would be their final one, and only one of them would be alive at the end. To ensure that he was the victor, Harry researched his father's chemical notes, hoping to recreate the original Goblin's superhuman strength. Harry made his own modifications to the formula, and upon ingesting it, it proved better than he had dreamed. The Green Goblin II formula had made him stronger than both Spider-Man and his father. Now a physical match for Spider-Man, Harry planned his final revenge.

Harry took to stalking Peter Parker on his Goblin Glider, claiming that there was no law against just soaring around town in a colorful costume, and taunting Peter that someday he would destroy him, but he relished keeping Peter in suspense in the meantime. After weeks of this, Peter finally lost his nerve and struck at Harry, only to be sent flying when Harry hit back, demonstrating his new strength. He then rocketed away, taunting Spider-Man's inability to stop him.

Not long after, Harry held a prestigious dinner at his townhouse, inviting many of his father's old business associates.  However, it was actually a trap, and Harry had planted explosives throughout the townhouse, which he planned to detonate, thus destroying everybody who had slighted the Osborns.

Spider-Man, worrying the most, dropped in to investigate, only to be confronted by Harry as the Goblin.  The two former friends engaged in a dangerous battle, which ended when Harry injected Peter with a drug that left him immobile, but still alive.  However, even as he celebrated over his victory, he realized that Mary Jane and his son Normie were also in the townhouse, and that the explosives would detonate in thirty seconds. Despite protestations that he was not a hero, Peter convinced Harry to use his damaged glider to get the two to safety. After rescuing Normie and Mary Jane, Harry finally returns to his senses and realized that he had left Peter to die. Harry rescued Peter from the explosion just in time. However, as his friends thanked him, he suddenly collapsed. The Goblin Formula was damaged by the explosion, and while it had increased his strength, it was also lethally poisoning him. Paramedics were called, but Harry died at the end of the route to the hospital. With his final words, he apologized to Peter, and confirmed that despite everything, they were still, and would always be, best friends.<ref>''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man|Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #200</ref>

===Post-Mortem===
Sometime before his death, Harry had created a computer system with copies of his and Norman Osborn's minds programmed into it; after Harry's death, the computer system activates and abducts Normie Osborn with the intent of subjecting him to the Goblin serum (the same one that that caused Harry's death) and making him the newest Green Goblin. This computer facsimile of Harry and its robotic drones (which resemble female versions of the Green Goblin) are all destroyed by Spider-Man and the [[Molten Man]], who manage to save Normie from it.<ref>''Spider-Man: Legacy Of Evil''</ref>

However, Harry had one last trick up his sleeve. Sometime before his final confrontation with Spider-Man, Harry had employed the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] to construct [[Life Model Decoy]]s of Peter's parents to play with his emotions. The plot ended with both constructs revealed to be fake when both "died," shattering Peter's mind. After nearly killing the Chameleon, Peter found a tape Harry had left before he died, revealing his role in the plot and mocking Peter. Peter went temporarily insane from the shock, which proved that Harry could be as manipulative and cruel as his father ever was when gripped by insanity; Peter even briefly rejected his identity as Peter Parker, until the return of his clone [[Ben Reilly]] snapped him out of his "mood".

===Planned Return===
{{Original research|date=January 2008}}
Towards the end of the Clone Saga, the writers of the Spider-Man books planned to end the series by reviving Harry Osborn, who would be revealed to be the semi-zombified cyborg known as "[[Mendel Stromm|Gaunt]]". Gaunt was a late entry towards the controversial storyline, created mainly as a plot device to return Harry to life, as the plan for the character included Harry regaining his humanity, taking credit for tricking Peter Parker into thinking he was a clone, and resuming his identity as the Green Goblin full time. However, the plotline was nixed by newly promoted Editor-In-Chief [[Bob Harras]], who disliked Harry Osborn and instead demanded that the plotline be aborted and Norman Osborn resurrected instead as the mastermind of the [[Clone Saga]].

As a result, Gaunt was revealed to be Mendel Stromm—the man who originally created the Goblin formula before becoming the villain known as the Robot Master—and Norman Osborn was the real main villain. Norman would reveal, upon his return, that he had in fact died when the glider impaled him, but the unexpected [[healing factor]] effect of the goblin formula regrew his internal organs and reanimated him. After killing someone with a similar body-type to be buried in his place, Norman fled to [[Europe]], hoping to give Harry a chance to prove himself after seeing him trying on the Green Goblin costume. A year after Harry's death, Norman returned to America, nearly driving Spider-Man insane with the [[Clone Saga]] (where Osborn tried to convince Peter that he was his own clone to make Peter lose the will to live) and regaining the mantle of the Green Goblin when he finally revealed himself as the mastermind, shortly before the death of Ben Reilly (the real clone).

=== Return From the Grave===
In order to save the life of May Parker (who was near death with no prospect of recovery), Peter and Mary Jane agreed to allow the demon [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] to alter history. In the new timeline, Peter and Mary Jane were never married, and his identity as Spider-Man was never revealed to the world, as it had been during the superhero "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]".<ref>''Civil War'' #2</ref>  As a consequence of these changes, Harry's death is erased from history as well.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #545</ref>  It is subsequently revealed that Harry's supposed death was faked by [[Mysterio]] and his father Norman Osborn, who spirited his son away to Europe where he was held prisoner in several "rehab" clinics.  The reason given was Norman's belief that his son had relapsed into drug addiction, due to his brief return to wearing the Green Goblin costume.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #581</ref>

At some point, Harry was let go from rehab and reunited with his friends. However, due to his time imprisoned by his father as well as the mindwipe of the world's knowledge of Peter's secret identity by Dr. Strange, Reed Richards, and Tony Stark, Harry no longer remembers that Peter Parker is Spider-Man. His marriage to Liz Allan also disintegrated, leading to the two divorcing and Harry responding to his break-up by engaging in a string of relationships with other women, of which several of them ended with Harry marrying and divorcing them in rapid fashion. He is currently engaged in a relationship with [[Menace (Marvel Comics)|Lily Hollister]]. Harry has tried to help Lily's father run for Mayor of New York, funding her father's campaign with his dwindling finances.

Harry is also one of the leading suspects of the secret identity of Menace, a new Green Goblin-themed villain. In the "New Ways to Die" story arc, Menace battled Norman Osborn and was infuriated by Norman stating that all he cared about was killing Spider-Man. New Ways to Die has Norman put back on the Green Goblin costume, Norman mentions that Harry has been in the Goblin's Lair. Norman calls Harry, who recognizes from Norman's distorted voice that Norman is wearing the Goblin suit, which horrifies and disgusts Harry. Harry vows to stop his father. Harry angrily confronts his father who wants Harry to follow in his legacy and become a greater man. The confused Harry is saved by Spider-Man. Spider-Man, wanting to beat Norman senseless, stops when he sees an area of Human Testing. Harry is claimed to be the one responsible for the atrocious acts although he attempts to plead innocence. Harry later states that he wants to talk to Peter who moments earlier was kissed by Lily, while seen leaving with a mysterious canister labelled "Prometheus X-90".

It has since been revealed that Prometheus X-90 was developed as a successful cure for Mark Raxton's condition as Molten Man. Furthermore, the only human test subject was Charlie Weiderman, the short-lived second Molten Man, and the only person whom the serum could be tested on.  After the cure is administered, Liz finally forgives Harry, and gives him back the wedding ring, which she originally claimed she lost.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #582</ref>

Following the events of ''[[Secret Invasion]]'', Norman Osborn is placed in charge of the H.A.M.M.E.R. organization, and forms his own team of [[Dark Avengers|Avengers]].

Renting out all of Liberty Island, Harry takes Lily to the island. On top of the Statue of Liberty, he gets down on one knee and appears to propose to her.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #583</ref> Lily however rejected Harry's proposal as she is not sure as to where their relationship will lead, which surprised Harry. Hr later went to Lily's place to check up on her, and as he entered the room he was surprised to discover Lily wearing Menace's costume.

She found a hidden door in his closet and found an old journal of his. She begins giving him a hard time about whining so much about his father. Harry thinks her behavior is because she's sick.  She continues to tell him she uncovered one of Norman's secret room in the journal. This explains why she kissed Peter after the Thunderbolts attacked, he almost found the secret trigger to open the room. When she had first gone in, she found all of the Goblin's equipment along with some experiments. Knocking over some chemicals, she absorbed them and is now able to transform at will. She explains that she discovered Menace's attacks against her father gave him more public support. She also tells him that she accepts his marriage proposal. After their talk, Harry enters one of his father's weapons caches, taking a glider, a pair of Goblin gloves, and a dart gun containing an unknown chemical.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #586</ref> In the midst of a battle between Menace and Spider-Man, he confronts and shoots her with that chemical, which is a type of antidote that reverts her back to her human form. He saves Spider-Man from the crowd and leaves.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #588</ref> Lily is incarcerated, but later escapes, leaving Harry her ring and a note. This causes Harry to sink back into [[alcoholism]], during which he is helped by [[Carlie Cooper]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #591</ref>

===''Dark Reign''===
Norman approaches Harry with the offer of a job within his organization. Harry declines, but after getting a visit from [[Menace (Marvel Comics)|Lily]], who revealed to him that she was pregnant, he accepts.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #595</ref> Norman welcomes him into Avengers Tower, wanting to make his son part of the "American Son" project. However, Harry is shown to have an ulterior motive, based on his need to protect Lily and his child, disabling the camera in his room and sneaking off.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #596</ref> He finds a cure for Lilly's Goblin Serum that would be safe for her and the baby, but she pushes him away, revealing that it was all a ruse to make Harry become American Son, whom Norman would eventually have die in a tragedy to increase sympathy for Norman and the Dark Avengers. She also reveals that the baby is not Harry's but in fact Norman's. In retalliation to this news, Harry dons the American Son armor and fights against his father.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #598</ref>

During the battle, Norman declares that Harry is no longer his son, and that he has bred a better child to replace the failure Harry. After further taunts from Norman, Harry lashes out and defeats his father, declaring "I was never your son!" When Harry has the option to kill Norman, Spider-Man goads him to decapitate Norman, as his healing factor may repair a blow to the head. Spider-Man states that by killing Norman, he would "become the son Norman always wanted." Harry backs down, and walks away from Norman Osborn forever.

We last see Harry in a psychiatrist's office, claiming he is getting over the effects of a medical treatment he received. The doctor offers to prescribe him [[oxycodone]], a nod to Harry's past drug abuse, but it is not revealed if Harry takes the prescription.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #599</ref>

After the events of American Son, Norman cuts him off financially and he is forced to move from his penthouse apartment, and is currently staying in Peter Parker's old room at Aunt May's.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #604</ref> His also begins secretly dating Peter's cousin, Amy Reilly.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #605</ref> After Aunt May returns and is corrupted by [[Mister Negative]], she kicks Harry out of the house, forcing him to move in with Mary Jane.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #618-619</ref>

===Heroic Age===
After the fall of Norman Osborn, the American Son armor is stolen by a mysterious figure. Shortly after the police begin questioning Harry as Norman is in prison and only a member of the Osborn bloodline can use the suit. Later, in his coffee shop Harry is visited by  [[Gabriel and Sarah Stacy|Gabriel Stacy]] who identifies himself as Norman's other son and shoots him in the chest claiming that Norman gave him a better life.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Presents: American Son'' #1</ref> American Son arrives and saves Harry from Gabriel and taking him to a hospital. After Harry recovers from his wounds he is escorted to his home by police forces. Fearing the damage that could be done with the American Son armor and perplexed by his encounter with Gabriel, Harry decides to figure things out on his own. After enlisting the help of a talented reporter named Norah from Frontline Harry decides to visit Norman as only he would know about Gabriel. Harry and Norah eventually visit the [[The Raft (comics)|Raft]] where they find Norman in the cell consumed by madness. Harry demands to know about Gabriel and American Son but Norman is unresponsive. Frustrated Harry and Norah begin to leave, but before they exit his cell Norman briefly returns to his senses and tells Harry that Gabriel is indeed his son.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Presents: American Son'' #2</ref>

Trying to make sense of everything, Harry visits Aunt May's work, where he plans to volunteer, on his way he realizes that he is being followed by the FBI. It is then revealed through FBI security footage that Gabriel was the one who stole the American Son armor and has been using it all along. Meanwhile Gabriel has a confrontation with the American Son armor and is revealed to have developed a split personality similar to Norman's after his exposure to the Goblin Serum. This split personality explains to Gabriel that it represents all that is good in his soul and will use the American Son armor to undo each of Gabriel's crimes. After an intense psychological battle, Gabriel appears to get the upper hand and proceeds with his plan.

Still attempting to understand Gabriel's plans, Harry determines that in order for Gabriel to truly hurt him, he will attempt to abduct an innocent person and lay a trap. Harry then rushes to find Noah. Meanwhile, the police arrive at Gabriel's hideout but are unable to rescue Norah due to the American Son's interfearence. Harry manages to sneak in through one of his father's secret tunnels and confronts his half-brother.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Presents: American Son'' #3</ref> As the police prepare to make another attempt to save Norah, Harry frees her and gets the young reporter to safety. With Norah out of harms way Gabriel and Harry engage in an epic battle, during the fight Harry attempts to convince Gabriel that Norman is evil and that attempting to follow in his footsteps is madness. Gabriel refuses to listen and continues his attempts to kill Harry, saddened by his brother's choice Harry hack's the American Son armor and knocks Gabriel unconscious. Unfortunately the battle causes the warehouse to go up in flames trapping Gabriel and Harry inside. Thankfully Spider-Man arrives and saves them. Afterward, Norah visits Harry in his coffee shop, and notices a bottle of oxycodone in Harry's things. Troubled by what she finds Norah concludes that Harry has a drug problem and resolves to help him through it.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Presents: American Son'' #4</ref>

After many near misses, Carlie and Peter meet at the coffee bean. Harry and MJ happen to be there and the four get talking, when all of a sudden Lily bursts through the wall, followed by an attacking team of supervillains. MJ asks Harry to help Lily, who's gone into labor, but they are held captive by Doctor Octopus.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #642</ref> After this, Spider-Man manages to save them and rescue Lily's newborn baby from the supervillains. Later, Harry and MJ take Lily to medicine care, but Carlie was too angry with Lily.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #643</ref> When Spider-Man secures the baby from Doctor Octopus, he runs an analysis on a sample of the baby's DNA and finds it identical to Harry Osborn. Spider-Man encourages Harry to raise his son on his own and start a new life.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #646</ref>  Soon thereafter, Harry prepares to leave New York with the baby, whom he has named Stanley. At his going away party, Harry encounters former NYPD officer [[Vin Gonzales]] (who views Norman Osborn as a deity).  After Vin threatens him, Harry shocks the man with a taser and brutally beats him.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #647</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
For most of his life, Osborn had no superhuman abilities. However, when he takes the reins of the second [[Green Goblin]], he becomes exposed to the Goblin formula, causing Harry to become much stronger, cunning, and agile. The glider he carries has swords, along with usual Goblin technology.

===American Son===
While Harry is temporarily the American Son, he has access to the American Son armor and formula (The American Son formula had been created by combining the Super-Soldier Serum and Goblin Serum).

==In other media==
===Television===
* Harry is first mentioned ''[[Spider-Man (1981 TV series)|1981 Spider-Man]]'' cartoon as Peter's friend and roommate.

* Harry Osborn appears in ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'' voiced by [[Gary Imhoff]]. At the start of the series, he is [[Flash Thompson]]'s best friend and he and Peter aren't well-acquainted with each other, something Peter points out when Harry asks him to be his college roommate so as to please his father, though they eventually become best friends. That eventually was changed when Peter dated [[Mary Jane Watson]] who he was originally engaged until she turned him down. Harry's father, as the Green Goblin, and Mary Jane Watson soon became trapped in the [[Negative Zone]] after battling Spider-Man which left Harry in depression over losing the two people that he loves the most. Peter tried to comfort Harry but his life of becoming Spider-Man interfered. Harry slowly began to realize that Peter was Spider-Man and have nightmares that Spider-Man is trying to take away his father and that he's next. The Green Goblin then subconsciously began to appear to him in his [[reflection]]s. Harry then becomes the Green Goblin under a promise to see his father again, though after many failures to kill Spider-Man, he learns that his father is the Green Goblin. This soon leads to Harry slowly becoming insane. After continuing his villainy, he attempts to ruin the wedding of Peter and Mary Jane, though [[Liz Allan]] is able to calm him down, allowing him to leave peacefully and seek help in the Ravencroft mental institution.

* Harry Osborn appears in ''[[Spider-Man: The New Animated Series]]'' (loosely based after the [[Spider-Man (film)|first ''Spider-Man'' movie]]) voiced by [[Ian Ziering]]. He constantly blames Spider-Man for his father's death. He is also pictured as being blonde.

* Harry Osborn appears in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' voiced by [[James Arnold Taylor]]. Whereas Harry and Peter didn't meet until college in the comic books, in the cartoon, he is Peter's classmate in high school.  While constantly trying to appease his father, he takes the "Globulin Green" serum to boost his physical abilities, but this causes the development of a second personality, one which symbolizes Harry's notion of "the man his father wanted to be". Learning of this, Norman uses his son as a scapegoat for his own alter ego, the Green Goblin. Believing Harry to be the Green Goblin, Spider-Man allowed Norman to look after him as Harry is taken away on a European tour to help him break his addiction to the serum. Harry returned from his trip. After Flash exposed the addiction to league administrators, losing the trophy their team won as a result, Harry destroys the remaining vials of Globulin Green he kept hidden. Soon after, Harry attempts to have a relationship with [[Gwen Stacy|Gwen]], though expressed some anger when he overheard her talking about breaking up with him to Peter. It was later that Harry learned the truth of his father being the real Green Goblin as he witnesses his fight with Spider-Man up to his father's supposed death. Attending the funeral soon after, using his father's death to have Gwen stay with him out of guilt, Harry expresses intent to have revenge against Spider-Man (similar to the movie).

===Films===

In the [[Spider-Man film series|''Spider-Man'' film series]], Harry, played by [[James Franco]], is [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker's]] closest friend. He constantly tries to impress his father, who is very invested in his work, and he eventually grows jealous of Peter Parker's close relationship with him. He dates [[Mary Jane Watson]] during the first film, though she eventually falls for Peter, and he manages to somewhat mend his relationship with his father. After his father's death as the Green Goblin, Harry believes that his father was murdered by Spider-Man, and seeks revenge, unaware that Spider-Man had in fact tried to save Norman Osborn's life, and went to great lengths to keep secret the billionaire's secret life as the Green Goblin.

Harry takes over Oscorp in ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'', forming an alliance with [[Doctor Octopus]] to get his revenge, providing Octopus with a rare element he needs to complete his [[fusion reactor]] in exchange for Octopus capturing Spider-Man. Although the plan fails, he learns that Peter is Spider-Man when he unmasks the hero in preparation to kill him. Afterwards, he begins to hallucinate, seeing his father's image in a mirror, demanding that Harry avenge him. He refuses and smashes the mirror, and finds a hidden room with the Green Goblin equipment and serum behind it, realizing that his father was the infamous Green Goblin.

Becoming the '''New Goblin''' in ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'', he attempts to take revenge, but he briefly sustains [[amnesia]] after Peter knocks him unconscious during their first battle. After regaining his memory, due to the efforts of his father's ghost, he attempts to destroy Peter by sabotaging his relationship with Mary Jane and then claiming that she left Peter for him, only for Peter &mdash; falling increasingly under the influence of the [[Symbiote (comics)#Film|black suit]] &mdash; to attack Harry in his penthouse, throwing one of his own pumpkin bombs back at him and scarring the right side of his face. However, after learning the truth of his father's death from his butler Bernard, he helps Spider-Man save Mary Jane from [[Venom (comics)|Venom]] and [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], and ultimately sacrifices himself to save Peter during the ensuing fight. He dies with Peter and Mary Jane at his side. Peter and Mary Jane, both heartbroken, attend Harry's funeral together.
