'''Harry Osborn''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[fictional character|character]], both one-time friend and foe to [[Spider-Man]]. Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]], he first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #31 ([[1965#December|December 1965]]).

Son of industrialist Norman Osborn, who was secretly the [[supervillain]] the [[Green Goblin]], Harry became the unlikely friend and college roommate of the nerdy Peter Parker. After witnessing his father battle with Spider-Man and die, Harry swore vengeance on the hero. After discovering that Peter was secretly Spider-Man, Harry became psychotic and took on the mantle of the Green Goblin.
{{spoiler}}
Harry managed regain his sanity temporarily, marrying and taking over his father’s company. Still, he would inevitably experiment with Norman's old chemicals again and soon menace Peter as the Green Goblin once more. Harry, insane with power after ingesting a new version of his father’s superhuman strength formula, physically beat Spider-Man and trapped the hero in a house rigged to explode. Though Harry came to his senses long enough to save both Spider-Man and his wife [[Mary Jane Watson]], the chemicals Harry had drank were toxic.

As he died slowly from the poisoning, he confessed to Spider-Man that Peter would always be his best friend before passing away.

==Biography==
Harry was born in New York to industrialist Norman Osborn and his wife Emily. Unfortunately, the circumstances of Harry's birth weakened Emily, and she died after several years of illness. Heartbroken, Norman became a cold and unloving father, either dismissing Harry or lashing out at him in fury. Harry would spend the rest of his life trying desperately to earn his father's approval.

When Harry graduated high school, he enrolled in [[Empire State University]]. Among the wealthiest students in the school, Harry soon became one of the most popular faces in the school, despite his aloof manner. He soon formed a clique of rich, popular students around him. One of these students was the lovely [[Gwen Stacy]], whom Harry had known since high school. Gwen soon became intrigued with a new student, a bookish, studious fellow named Peter Parker. Harry took a dislike to Parker, as he resented the amount of attention he was getting from Gwen, and he assumed that the reason Peter was so standoffish was because of snobbery. After confronting Parker, however, Harry discovered that Peter was painfully shy and worried about his ailing aunt, [[Aunt May|May]]. Despite this rocky early start, Harry and Peter became friends, eventually sharing a luxury apartment.

What Harry didn't realize was that Peter was the [[superhero]] Spider-Man, and that he had twice battled his father, who had become the Green Goblin in an accident while attempting to create a super-serum. When the Goblin discovered Spider-Man's identity and captured him, he revealed his own identity to Peter. Horrified that his greatest enemy was his best friend's father, Peter's loyalties were torn during their battle. However, Osborn then fell onto an electric transformer and the resulting shock removed all memory of being the Green Goblin. Spider-Man removed the Goblin's costume and equipment, hoping it was the end of the Goblin menace.

However, Norman's memories would resurface from time to time and he would periodically battle Spider-Man, only to lose his memories again when the fight was over. These were difficult times for Harry. Having experimented with drugs since his teenage years, Harry gradually began experimenting with harder substances, which affected his mental stability and relationships with his friends. Spider-Man used this to his advantage on one occasion when, in battle with the Green Goblin, he was able to stop the fight by showing Norman his son's emaciated condition, brought on by an accidental [[cocaine]] overdose. The sight shocked Norman so much that it brought him back to sanity for what was to be the last time.

It wasn't long after, though, that stress caused Norman to become the Green Goblin again. Harry's life had fallen apart. His relationship with Peter's friend [[Mary Jane Watson]] had come to an end when she dumped him, fed up with his self-destructive lifestyle. A disconsolate Harry turned to drugs and suffered an [[LSD]] overdose. He survived, but this tragedy, compounded by imminent [[bankruptcy]], drove the Green Goblin over the edge. He [[kidnap]]ped Gwen as bait for Spider-Man, and then threw her off the [[George Washington Bridge]]. When Peter pulled her back up with his webbing, she was already dead. A vicious battle between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin ensued, with Peter barely able to control himself from killing the villain. The Goblin then directed his goblin glider to impale Spider-Man, but the wall-crawler jumped out of the way, and the Goblin was impaled through the chest himself, and seemingly killed. Peter was wracked with guilt and sorrow, but took comfort in the fact that the Green Goblin was finally dead.

===The new Green Goblin===
However, Harry had secretly witnessed the battle. Wanting to protect his father's identity, he stripped Norman's body of the Green Goblin costume and hid it. Blaming Spider-Man for his father's "[[murder]]," Harry swore vengeance. Having inherited his father's company, Harry managed to get the business back in shape as he planned his revenge. One day, to his shock, he found a Spider-Man costume in Peter's apartment, and realized that his best friend was the man he blamed for his father's death. Using his father's old equipment, Harry confronted Peter as the new Green Goblin.

Not wanting to hurt Harry, Peter avoided fighting his old friend. Eventually Harry was knocked unconscious and taken into police custody. There he raved that he was the true Green Goblin and Peter Parker was Spider-Man, but was dismissed as a lunatic. He was put in the care of criminal psychologist Dr. Bart Hamilton, who extracted the secrets of the Green Goblin from Harry through [[hypnosis]], and buried the knowledge deep with Harry's mind. However, this was not altruistic on Hamilton's part - he then raided one of Harry's hideouts and became the third Green Goblin, hoping to become the new boss of the underworld. However, his power was no match for his enthusiasm, and the power-mad psychologist was killed by a bomb he had planted for Spider-Man. Harry was released and considered cured, and he and Peter rekindled their friendship.

For a while, Harry's life seemed back on track; His company began turning [[profit]]s once more, and he developed a romance with [[Liz Allan (Marvel Comics)|Liz Allan]], whom he met at the wedding of [[Betty Brant]] and [[Ned Leeds]]. Not long after, the two were married, and eventually they had a son, whom Harry named Normie in memory of the boy's grandfather. Harry also gave his blessing to the marriage of Peter and Mary Jane. However, Harry was forced to act as the Green Goblin a few times during these years, once to defeat Jason Macendale, the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]], who sought the Goblin formula that gave the Green Goblin superhuman strength; Harry was able to defeat the Hobgoblin by doubling back during an aerial chase and emptying his entire supply of pumpkin bombs onto the Hobgoblin. Harry even wondered if he could use the Goblin persona for a career as a superhero, but Peter convinced him that the Goblin had too much baggage for such a role, and Harry buried the Goblin menace within his mind once more, and focussed on his business and family.

===Death===
[[Image:Harryosborndeath.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The death of Harry Osborn.]]
This tranquility was shattered when the aftereffects of the [[Inferno (comics)|Inferno crisis]] sundered the barrier between Harry's conscious and [[subconscious]] minds. Once again he remembered being the Green Goblin - and his irrational hatred of Spider-Man (Harry had now convinced himself that Peter resented the Osborns' 'stable family life' due to never having been wanted by his guardians, when in fact it was almost the complete opposite). His sanity shattered, he declared that their next confrontation would be their final one, and only one of them would be alive at the end. To ensure that he was the victor, Harry researched his father's chemical notes, hoping to recreate the original Goblin's superhuman strength. Harry made his own modifications to the formula, and upon ingesting it, it proved better than he had dreamed. The new Goblin Formula had made him stronger than both Spider-Man and his father. Now a physical match for Spider-Man, Harry planned his final revenge.

Harry took to stalking Peter Parker on his Goblin Glider, claiming that there was no law against just soaring around town in a colourful costume, and taunting Peter that someday he would destroy him, but he relished keeping Peter in suspense in the meantime. After weeks of this, Peter finally lost his cool and struck at Harry, only to be sent flying when Harry hit back, demonstrating his new strength. He then rocketed away, taunting Spider-Man's inability to stop him.

Not long after, Harry held a prestigious dinner at his townhouse, inviting many of his father's old business associates. However, it was actually a trap, and Harry had planted explosives throughout the townhouse, which he planned to detonate, thus destroying everybody who had slighted the Osborns. Spider-Man, fearing the worst, dropped in to investigate, only to be confronted by Harry as the Green Goblin. The two former friends engaged in an explosive battle, which ended when Harry injected Peter with a drug that left him immobile but still conscious.

However, even as he gloated over his victory, he realized that Mary Jane and his son Normie were also in the townhouse, and that the explosives would detonate in two minutes. Despite protestations that he wasn't a hero, Peter convinced Harry to use his glider to get the two to safety. Once Normie and Mary Jane were safe, Harry's sanity finally returned, and he realized that he had left Peter to die. Harry rescued Peter from the explosion in the nick of time. However, as his friends thanked him, he suddenly collapsed. The Goblin Formula was imperfect, and while it had increased his strength, it was also lethally poisoning him. Paramedics were called, but Harry died en route to the hospital. With his final words, he apologised to Peter, and confirmed that despite everything, they were still best friends.

===Post-Mortem===
However, Harry had one last trick up his sleeve. Sometime before his final confrontation with Spider-Man, Harry had employed the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] to construct [[LMD]]s of Peter's parents to play with his emotions. The plot ended with both constructs revealed to be fake when both "died," shattering Peter's mind. After nearly killing the Chameleon, Peter found a tape Harry had left before he died, revealing his role in the plot and mocking Peter. Peter went temporarily insane from the [[shock]] and proved that Harry could be as manipulative and cruel as his father ever was when gripped by insanity.

Towards the end of the imfamous Clone Saga, the writers of the Spider-Man books planned to end the series by reviving Harry Osborn, who would be revealed to be the semi-zombified cyborg known as "Gaunt". Gaunt was a late entry towards the controversial storyline, created mainly as a plot device to return Harry to life, as the plan for the character included Harry regaining his humanity, taking credit for tricking Peter Parker into thinking he was a clone, and resuming his identity as the Green Goblin fulltime. But the plotline was nixed by newly promoted Editor-In-Chief Bob Harras, who disliked Harry Osborn and instead demanded that the plotline be aborted and Norman Osborn resurrected instead as the mastermind of the Clone Saga.  

So Gaunt was revealed to be Mendall Stromm and Norman Osborn was the real main villain. Norman would reveal, upon his return, that he had in fact died when the glider impaled him, but the [[healing factor]] effect of the goblin formula regrew his internal organs and reanimated him. Norman fled to [[Europe]], hoping to give Harry a chance to prove himself. A year after Harry's death, Norman returned to America, nearly driving Spider-Man insane with the [[Clone Saga]] (Where Osborn tried to convince Peter that he was his own clone to make Peter lose the will to live) and regaining the mantle of the Green Goblin when he finally revealed himself as the mastermind, shortly before the death of [[Ben Reilly]] (The ''real'' clone). If anything, Harry's death has made the rivalry between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin even more bitter than before, as both blame the other for Harry's death.

==Powers and abilities==
For most of his life, Harry Osborn had no superhuman abilities. When he drank the experimental Goblin Formula, his strength was augmented beyond that of either Spider-Man or the Green Goblin. His durability, agility and intelligence likewise increased, but the extent of these augmentations is unknown.

Harry had all of the Green Goblin's equipment, including the explosive "pumpkin bombs" and the razor-edged boomerang blades. He also rode on a modified version of the Goblin Glider that was even faster and more mobile than the original.

==Ultimate Harry Osborn==
[[Image:Ultsm73.jpg|200px|thumb|Cover to ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #73. Art by [[Mark Bagley]].]]

In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, Harry Osborn is a rich kid who meets Peter Parker in public school. Despite the difference between them, the two bond; Harry improves Peter's social status, and Peter helps Harry with his homework. He also had a brief romantic relationship with Peter's soon-to-be girlfriend, Mary-Jane Watson.

Harry's father, Norman Osborn, is an industrialist who creates the Oz Formula, an experimental solution intended to turn ordinary humans into superhumans. When a spider injected with the Oz Formula bites Peter, he gains superhuman strength and agility and secretly becomes Spider-Man. Under the pretense of fearing for Peter's health, Norman takes a sample of Peter's blood, and realizes that Oz has made him stronger. Norman then subjects himself to the Oz Formula, becoming a hideous demonic monster: the [[Green Goblin#Ultimate Green Goblin|Green Goblin]].

Insane, Norman attacks his family and destroys his house, killing his wife and almost killing his son. The next day, the Goblin attacks the school but is stopped by Spider-Man. Peter believes that the Goblin had come for him, but Harry says that his father had come to kill him. Harry is then taken into custody and sent to live with his uncle.

When Harry later comes back, he is once again living with his father and is brainwashed by [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Miles Warren]] into believing that his mother had died in a freak accident. He later walks in on a fight between the Green Goblin and Spider-Man, and literally stabs his own father in the back with a shard of glass from a shattered window pane, reverting the creature back into his father. Harry is taken into custody again, but this time by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.#Ultimate S.H.I.E.L.D.|S.H.I.E.L.D.]].

Later, during the events of ''[[Ultimate Six]]'' in which Norman once again escapes and teams up with Spider-Man's old rogues to siege the [[White House]], Harry is used by Nick Fury to negotiate with his father. It almost works as Harry reaches out to his father, but a trigger-happy [[Iron Man]] blasts Osborn with his DNA cannon. His genetic structure now rapidly out of control, Norman lashes out in blind fury only to be gunned down by soldiers right in front of Harry.

Traumatized, Harry vengefully promises to Peter, "All of You. I'll kill all of you for this." (Referring to everyone Harry knows to be involved in the incident.) Harry returns to school, seemingly back to normal, but Peter is suspicious. Harry blames Peter for stealing his girlfriend Mary-Jane and later tells her that Peter killed his father.

Through the hypnotic therapy he had Harry under for years, Norman Osborn had planted a post-hypnotic suggestion in the form of his henchman, Shaw. 'Shaw' takes Harry to an OsCorp bunker in New Jersey, where there are reserves of the Oz Serum. (It also appears that the bunker has a copy of [[Doctor Octopus#Ultimate Doctor Octopus|Doctor Octopus]]' mechanical arms and, in an inside joke, all three versions of the Green Goblin face; the classic, the movie version and the Ultimate one).

Later, Peter (as Spider-Man) confronts Harry, demanding to know why he had told Mary Jane that he killed his father. Shaw then provokes Harry to unleash his hidden abilities. Harry bursts into flame, transforming into the Ultimate version of the Hobgoblin. 'Shaw' goads the mutated Harry to battle Spider-Man, but after a lengthy battle the Hobgoblin breaks down and begs Peter to kill him. Peter tries to help Harry, when the 'Shaw' persona takes over once again and attacks Peter.

S.H.I.E.L.D. arrives and Harry attacks them, trying to provoke a lethal counterattack. He is promptly shot down, to Peter's horror. Spider-Man then attacks Nick Fury before leaving. It later turns out that Harry is not dead, just seriously wounded.

It is later revealed that Harry was caught in the same accident that created both The Green Goblin and Doctor Octopus, with Norman grabbing him by the throat. Whether this or the Oz bunker later caused the transformation is uncertain.

''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'s'' writer and creator [[Brian Michael Bendis]] has said an upcoming arc in ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' will be called 'The Death of the Goblin' but would not elaborate on whether or not he meant Harry or his father. [http://www.wordballoon.com/BENDIS.html]

Like the 616 version, the Ultimate Hobgoblin conceived his powers via an acquaintance showing him the Green Goblin's 'Hideout', and he is marginally less insane than the Green Goblin. Also, he has shown a remarkable healing factor - regrowing teeth and skin within minutes - and bullet-proof armor. He is also able to immolate himself in flame, and possesses tremendous strength.

===Animation===
[[Image:Spidermanep49.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Animated Harry Osborn, in [[Spider-Man: The Animated Series|Spider-Man (1994 Animated Series)]], in [[The Return of the Green Goblin]] episode]]
Despite his early importance in the Spider-Man mythos, Harry made few to no appearances in most Spider-Man animated series until the [[1990s]].

In the [[Spider-Man: The Animated Series|1994 ''Spider-Man'' series]], Harry is voiced by [[Gary Imhoff]]. In this adaptation, Harry was Peter Parker's roommate in college. Their friendship seemed less strained and [[Gwen Stacy]] was not featured. Harry played an overall minor role, though he did act as a something of a rival for [[Mary Jane Watson]]'s affections in at least one episode. After the original Green Goblin becomes trapped in the [[Negative Zone]], he appears to Harry. Soon, Harry unwilling made into a replacement for and by the original Green Goblin, who contacted him while in limbo. Harry tried to kill Spider-Man numerous times while the Green Goblin promised to allow Harry to see his presumed deceased father, Norman Osborn. However, Harry always failed, once getting into some trouble with [[the Punisher]] as well. In the end, Harry realized in horror that the Green Goblin was his father and instead of wanting to quit, he began to lose his sanity. Now acting as if he enjoys becoming the new villain, he continued to want Spider-Man dead. This led to a fierce confrontation where Spider-Man knocked him out while on the [[George Washington Bridge]]. He was then taken to Ravencroft by Spider-Man. Later, when Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson were getting married, Harry found out and grew insane, as he was in love with MJ. He interrupted the wedding and threatened to blow up the church the wedding was taking place, wanting Mary Jane to marry him instead of Peter. In the end, [[Liz Allan]] appealed to Harry, convincing him not to blow up the church nor marry Mary Jane. Told by Liz that he is loved, he walked out peacefully and the wedding resumed.

In the 2003 [[MTV Spider-Man]] series, which ties in with the [[Spider-Man movies]], Harry is voiced by [[Ian Ziering]].  Harry had a dark tone in this series due his hatred of Spider-Man, blaming the hero for Norman Osborn's death. Critics have reviewed him favorably, calling his portrayals in the comics and previous 1990s animated series "too corny".{{fact}}

===Film===
In the [[Spider-Man film series]], Harry is played by actor [[James Franco]] who had originally auditioned for the titular role.
{{spoiler}}
[[Image:Harry Osborn, Spider-Man 2.jpg|thumb|200px|[[James Franco]] as Harry Osborn in ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'']]

In [[Spider-Man (movie)|the first film]], Harry is one of Peter's high school classmates, who resents the fact that his father seems to understand Peter better than him. Early in the movie, Peter becomes Spider-Man and Norman becomes the Green Goblin, but Harry remains unaware that the two are his best friend and his father. At the end of the film, the Green Goblin has been killed by his own glider (he was impaled in the thighs, where he died from internal bleeding, whereas in the comics he temporarily died from a chest impalement), after failing to kill Mary Jane. Spider-Man drops Norman's body at his mansion, and Harry spots him leaving. At his father's funeral, a brooding Harry tells Peter that Spider-Man will pay for the death of his father.

In ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'', Harry takes over his late father's career but his business failures and unresolved resentment towards Peter, who he feels is siding with Spider-Man rather than him, causes him to slowly spiral into alcoholism. His vendetta against Spider-Man brings him into an alliance with [[Doctor Octopus]]. Harry agrees to supply Doc Ock the [[tritium]] he needs to create his artificial sun if he will hunt down and deliver Spider-Man to him. After a long battle, Spider-Man is beaten by Doc Ock while the civilians nobly try to defend him. Spider-Man is brought before Harry, who prepares to kill Spider-Man with a dagger. Before he does so, however, he removes Spider-Man's mask, and is shocked to see Peter's face. A dazed Peter regains consciousness, and he convinces Harry to let him go and rescue Mary Jane. At the end of the movie a confused Harry [[hallucinate]]s, seeing his father's image in a mirror, demanding that Harry avenge him. Harry shatters the mirror, only to find his father's hidden lair, with the Green Goblin equipment within. 

[[Image:GG2_Theatricalv1.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Harry Osborn as the New Goblin in ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'']]

In several trailers for the [[Spider-Man 3|third film]], Harry is shown equipped with new gear. However, Sam Raimi has stated that Harry will neither be referred to as the second Green Goblin or the Hobgoblin. It has been stated that this will be the last movie of the Spider-Man series that Harry Osborn will be in.[http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1537122/07252006/story.jhtml] In the trailers, Harry wears a black suit, with some green elements, with a pair of green goggles and a green retractable mouthpiece whilst riding an [[snowboard]]-shaped glider called the Sky Stick. A November, 2006 trailer revealed that Harry's suit features large, retractable blades on his arms, and a short sword. A [[teaser trailer]] also shows Harry and Mary Jane looking at each other romantically. In special footage released on [[Fox (television)|Fox]] shows Harry still talking to his father's "ghost". Also seen is Harry using the same gas chamber that created his father's alter ego, the Green Goblin. During one part of a scene, a [[pumpkin bomb]] exploded in Harry's face, and another shows him in a [[hospital]] stretcher.  Director Sam Raimi christened Harry Osborn as the New Goblin.
