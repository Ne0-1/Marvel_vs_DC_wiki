The '''Green Goblin''' is the alias of several [[fictional character]]s that appears in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The first and most high-profile incarnation '''[[Norman Osborn]]''' first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #14 and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]]. The Green Goblin is a [[Halloween]]-themed supervillain whose weapons resemble bats, ghosts and [[jack-o'-lantern]]s. Comics journalist and historian [[Mike Conroy (writer)|Mike Conroy]] writes of the character: "Of all the costumed villains who've plagued Spider-Man over the years, the most flat-out unhinged and terrifying of them all is the Green Goblin."<ref>Conroy, Mike. ''500 Comicbook Villains'' (Collins & Brown, 2004), p. 55</ref>

==Publication history==
[[File:Amazing Spider-Man no, 14 (1964) (cover).jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #14 (July 1964), the Green Goblin's first appearance; the character originally used a turbo-fan-powered "flying [[broom]]stick." Cover art by [[Steve Ditko]].]]
According to Steve Ditko, the Green Goblin, as we know him, was entirely his creation. He claims: {{blockquote|Stan's synopsis for the Green Goblin had a movie crew, on location, finding an [[Egypt]]ian-like [[sarcophagus]]. Inside was an ancient, [[mythology|mythological]] [[demon]], the Green Goblin. He naturally came to life. On my own, I changed Stan's mythological demon into a human villain.<ref name=Ditko>{{Cite journal | title=Spider Time | first= Will |last=Murray | work= Starlog and Comics Scene present Spider-Man and other Comics Heroes|date=July 2002 | postscript={{inconsistent citations}}}}</ref>}}

The Green Goblin debuted in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #14.<ref>{{cite book|last = Manning|first = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|page = 26|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= Spider-Man's arch nemesis, the Green Goblin, as introduced to readers as the 'most dangerous foe Spidey's ever fought.' Writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko had no way of knowing how true that statement would prove to be in the coming years.}}</ref> At this time his identity was unknown, but he proved popular and reappeared in later issues, which made a point of his [[secret identity]]. Apparently, Lee and Ditko disagreed on who he should be. According to one theory, Lee always wanted him to be someone Peter Parker knew, while Ditko wanted him to be a stranger, feeling this was closer to real life.<ref>See (among others): Ro, Ronin. ''Tales to Astonish: Jack Kirby, Stan Lee and the American Comic Book Revolution'', p. 107 (Bloomsbury, 2004)</ref> Ditko has refuted this rumor, however, claiming: {{blockquote|So I had to have some definite ideas: who he was, his profession and how he fit into the Spider-Man story world. I was even going to use an earlier, planted character associated with [[J. Jonah Jameson]]: he [was to] be [revealed as] the Green Goblin. It was like a subplot working its way until it was ready to play an active role.<ref name="Ditko"/>}}

Ditko left the series with issue #38, before he could reveal the Goblin's identity, and Lee subsequently unmasked him in the next issue as Norman Osborn, a character who had been introduced two issues earlier as the father of [[Harry Osborn]]. [[John Romita, Sr.]], who replaced Ditko as the title's artist, recalls: {{blockquote|Stan wouldn't have been able to stand it if Ditko did the story and didn't reveal that the Green Goblin was Norman Osborn. I didn't know there was any doubt about Osborn being the Goblin. I didn't know that Ditko had just been setting Osborn up as a straw dog. I just accepted the fact that it was going to be Norman Osborn when we plotted it. I had been following the last couple of issues and didn't think there was really much mystery about it. Looking back, I doubt the Goblin's identity would have been revealed in ''Amazing'' #39 if Ditko had stayed on.<ref>''Comics Creators on Spider-Man'', pg 29–30, Tom Defalco. (Titan Books, 2004)</ref>}}

After the Green Goblin killed Peter Parker's girlfriend [[Gwen Stacy]], writer [[Gerry Conway]] decided that the Goblin had to pay a heavy price. Osborn accidentally caused his own death in the course of a fight against Spider-Man. Others, such as Harry Osborn, later adopted the Green Goblin identity, and writer [[Roger Stern]] later introduced the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]] to replace the Green Goblin as Spider-Man's archenemy.<ref name="Creators">{{cite book |title=Comics Creators on Spider-Man |last=DeFalco |first=Tom |year=2004 |publisher=Titan Books |isbn=1-84023-422-9 }}</ref>

==Fictional character biographies==

===Norman Osborn===
{{main|Norman Osborn}}
'''[[Norman Osborn]]''' is the main character connected with the alias who developed the equipment used by the other Green Goblins.

===Harry Osborn===
{{main|Harry Osborn}}
'''[[Harry Osborn]]''', Norman Osborn's son, becomes the second Green Goblin.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #136</ref> After being defeated and placed under the care of Dr. Bart Hamilton, Harry while under hypnosis reveals many Green Goblin secrets and Hamilton decides to become the third Green Goblin. Harry recovers, and fights Hamilton, until an explosion renders Harry [[amnesia]]c of his time as the Green Goblin and kills Hamilton.<ref name="ASM180">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #180</ref> Years later, Harry's memories return and he uses a new stronger Goblin serum to augment his power, but dies from it. Harry would later return thanks to the machinations of [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] in "[[Spider-Man: One More Day|One More Day]]".

===Bart Hamilton===
'''Dr. Barton "Bart" Hamilton''' was a psychologist born in [[Scarsdale, New York]]. Before his death, Harry is put under the medical care of Dr. Hamilton, who manages to make Harry bury his vendetta and identity as the Goblin in his [[subconscious]] via [[hypnosis]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #174</ref> Unfortunately, Dr. Hamilton wants to use Harry's secrets to become the third Green Goblin.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #176</ref> However, his power was no match for his enthusiasm&nbsp;— he never even bothered to use the strength-enhancing formulas on himself, seemingly believing that just ''being'' the Green Goblin would enable him to defeat Spider-Man, and, despite an elaborate plot to kill [[Silvermane]], the underpowered amateur is confronted by Harry Osborn who has resumed the Green Goblin identity to stop him. They battle and Hamilton is accidentally killed by a bomb with which he meant to kill Spider-Man, and Harry becomes amnesiac.<ref name="ASM180"/> Years later, there was speculation that Hamilton was the Hobgoblin but this is disproved.<ref>''Hobgoblin Lives'' #1–3</ref> A Green Goblin that was presumably Hamilton appeared as a member of the second incarnation of the [[Legion of the Unliving]], created by the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]]. After being pitted against the Avengers, the group and their master were vanquished by [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]].<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #16</ref>

===Phil Urich===
{{main|Phil Urich}}

After Harry's insanity relapses and he becomes the Green Goblin again on numerous occasions until he dies from the side effects of a modified Goblin serum, his equipment and the Green Goblin identity are then briefly used by '''[[Phil Urich|Philip Benjamin "Phil" Urich]]''' (nephew of [[Ben Urich]] of the [[Daily Bugle]]) trying to gain a reputation as a [[superhero]], although he is sometimes seen as being as maniacal as his villainous predecessors. When his equipment is damaged during a battle against a [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] in the [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] crossover, Phil is unable to repair or replace it and the fourth Green Goblin thereafter retires. He later forms the team [[Loners|Excelsior]]. Currently Phil has become the new Hobgoblin.

==Powers and abilities==
Due to the "Goblin Formula" Norman and any successor to the Goblin mantle after possesses super-human strength (lifting 9 tons under optimal conditions), increased speed, reflexes, endurance, and healing rate. Though much slower than the likes of Wolverine, he can regenerate damaged tissue and organs. His intelligence has been enhanced to gifted levels, though at the price of his sanity. His involvement with the Gathering of the Five loosened his grip on reality, though he is able to maintain his sanity via chemically treated dermal patches. When not impaired by mental illness, Osborn is a cunning businessman, masterful strategist, and highly skilled at electronics, mechanics, and chemistry. The Green Goblin is armed with a variety of bizarre devices. He travels on his [[bat]]-shaped "Goblin Glider", an incredibly fast and maneuverable rocket glider equipped with various armaments. Other weapons the Goblin uses include incendiary Pumpkin Bombs, smoke- and gas-emitting grenades resembling ghosts and jack-'o'-lanterns, razor-edged [[boomerang]]-like throwing weapons, resembling bats, and gloves woven with micro-circuited filaments which channel pulsed discharges of electricity at nearly 10,000 [[volt]]s. He wears a green costume underneath bulletproof [[mail (armour)|chainmail]] with an overlapping purple tunic. His mask has a built-in gas filter to keep him safe from his own gasses.

===Goblin Glider===
The Goblin Glider's controls and [[microprocessor]] are located behind the head of the glider. The pilot is attached to the glider via [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] clasps on the wings of the glider. It has great maneuverability and is steered mostly by leaning, but manual controls are available behind the head of the glider. The Green Goblin later added radio-linked voice controls to his mask. Its top speed is {{convert|90|mi/h|km/h}}, and it can support about {{convert|400|lb|abbr=on}}, though it could lift far more for brief periods. Flying at top speed with a full load and a full fuel tank would deplete its fuel supply in about an hour.

The glider possesses a wide array of armaments, including heat-seeking and smart missiles, machine guns, extending blades, a flamethrower and a pumpkin bomb dispenser/launcher.

===Pumpkin Bomb===
A [[grenade]] used by the Green Goblin, the Pumpkin Bomb resembles a miniature [[Jack-o'-lantern]] and, when thrown ignites almost soundlessly and produces enough heat to melt through a {{convert|3|in|mm|adj=on}} thick sheet of steel. The Goblin carries these and a variety of other weapons in a shoulder bag he calls his "Bag Of Tricks". The Green Goblin has a range of other "Pumpkin Bombs" at his disposal, including smoke-and gas-emitting bombs. Some release [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogenic]] gases, while others emit a specially created mixture that neutralizes [[Spider-Man]]'s spider-sense for a limited period of time. All of these are covered in a light plastic mantle that flutters like a ghost when thrown.

==Associated Goblins==

===Nels Van Adder===
It was revealed that soon after Norman had Stromm arrested for embezzlement, he had found only a portion of the notes detailing his partner's serum. Norman tests the incomplete version of the serum on Oscorp employee '''Nels Van Adder''', driving Van Adder slowly insane and beginning his transformation into a red, demon-like being known as the "'''Proto-Goblin'''". Killing several people and blaming Norman for what has happened to him, Adder proceeds to harass and later attempts to kill him before being knocked out a window in Oscorp by Arthur and George Stacy and fleeing into the wild. In order to escape conviction for what he had done to Van Adder, Norman convinces the police that Van Adder had been experimenting on himself, and that he had secretly been trying to help him. Van Adder's current fate remains unrevealed.<ref>''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' #-1</ref> As well as endowing Adder with super strength and agility, the Goblin Serum also gave him large claws, talons, fangs, glowing green eyes, and near impenetrable red skin (capable of withstanding several close range bullet shots).

The Proto-Goblin appears as a boss in ''[[Spider-Man: Battle for New York]]''.

===David Lowell===
Another Oscorp employee '''Doctor David Patrick Lowell''' worked in the Osborn Chemical Company division, where his main project was a type of "super fertilizer" that could increase the solar absorption and growth rate of flora. After being passed over for a promotion, an irritated Lowell showed Osborn his work, and Osborn, noticing Lowell's chemical was uncannily similar to the Goblin Formula, immediately fired him and ordered all his work terminated. As his life's work was being destroyed by Oscorp employees, an enraged Lowell tried to fight them off, only to become drenched in his formula and be knocked into a wall of solar lamps. The combination of the Goblin Serum-esque chemical and the electricity caused Lowell to mutate into a light-based being dubbed "'''Sundown'''". After going on a rampage through New York, Sundown was ultimately defeated and imprisoned by Spider-Man and several other heroes.<ref>''Untold Tales of Spider-Man'' 1997 Annual</ref> After being incarcerated for ten years, Sundown was released from prison, but was blackmailed back into supervillainy shortly afterward by mob boss Lucky Lobo. Eventually turning against Lobo, Sundown, with Spider-Man's help, was able to expose his crimes. Afterward, Sundown declined Spider-Man's offer of becoming a superhero, in favor of a normal life.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' 1997 Annual</ref>

===Hobgoblin===

==Groups==

===Order of the Goblin===
An offshoot of the Scriers cult founded by Norman, consisting of only his most loyal followers.

===Goblin Gangs===
Following Norman Osborn's [[Dark Reign (comics)|rise]] and [[Siege (comics)|fall]] from power, a number of Goblin Gangs sprang up across America. Composed mostly of [[White supremacy|white supremacists]] who agreed with his plans to remove the [[Asgardians (Marvel Comics)|Asgardians]] from the country, they wear purple clothes, green face makeup and have goblin-based tattoos.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #649</ref> [[Vin Gonzales]] was revealed to have received one of these tattoos while in prison when he passed a message from [[Norman Osborn|Norman]] to [[Harry Osborn|Harry]] about Stanley, Harry's newborn son.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #647</ref>

==Other versions==
