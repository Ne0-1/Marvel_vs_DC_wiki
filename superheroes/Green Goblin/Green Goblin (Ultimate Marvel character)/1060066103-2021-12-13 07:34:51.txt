''Ultimate Spider-Man''. ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard Xtra]]!''. p. 117.</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Norman Osborn is a corrupt [[industrialist]] and [[scientist]] who is trying to perfect the [[Supersoldier|Super Soldier]] drug for [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], an obsession that leads to the neglect of his wife [[Emily Osborn|Martha Osborn]] and son [[Harry Osborn]]. When an [[OZ (Ultimate Marvel)|OZ]]-injected spider bites [[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Peter Parker]] on a field trip,<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> and develops amazing abilities, Norman theorizes that if the OZ combined with spider DNA were behind Parker's abilities of a spider, then Norman with OZ combined with his ''own'' DNA would become a heightened version of himself. But his experiment goes wrong and an explosion occurs, affecting his son and Dr. [[Doctor Octopus#Ultimate Marvel|Otto Octavius]].<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> He himself is transformed into a [[Green Goblin|muscular, grotesque, goblin-looking monster]], granting him superhuman strength, reflexes, stamina, speed and durability, and enabling him to leap great distances. He is also pyrokinetic, as he can throw flaming balls of destructive energy. In an attempt to destroy all evidence of his existence, the Green Goblin kills Norman's wife but Harry manages to escape while the house is burning down.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> The next day, he attacks Harry's school but is stopped by Spider-Man. During the fight, the Green Goblin plummets off a bridge into the river, seemingly dead.<ref>{{Cite comic | Title = Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man | Issue = #1-7 |Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> His alter-ego is later referred to as the "Green Goblin" by the public.

However, Norman survives and has "evolved" in his words. He can now control his transformations into an intelligent incarnation of the Green Goblin via OZ injections. Due to overdosing on OZ, he suffers from [[hallucinations]]. These include seeing everything through a blood-red filter and creatures called "plasmids" tormenting him.{{issue|date=February 2013}} Taking Harry back, Norman moves back into New York City, blaming his business rival [[Justin Hammer#Ultimate Marvel|Justin Hammer]] for the explosion.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #11. Marvel Comics.</ref> Under the Green Goblin's spell, he reveals himself to Parker, telling the boy to give up the Spider-Man identity and work for him, or suffer the deaths of loved ones. The Green Goblin tells Parker to kill the S.H.I.E.L.D. head [[Nick Fury (Ultimate Marvel character)|Nick Fury]]. When Parker refuses, the Green Goblin kidnaps [[Mary Jane Watson]] who he attempts to kill by hurling from the top of a bridge.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #24. Marvel Comics.</ref> Spider-Man is able to save Mary Jane and joins S.H.I.E.L.D. operatives in attacking the Green Goblin. The battle continues at Osborn's [[Manhattan]] [[Penthouse apartment|penthouse]], where the Green Goblin transforms even further after taking several more OZ injections and begins to choke the life out of Spider-Man. Harry discovers the scene, picking up a shattered window pane to jam into his father's back, reverting him to his human self. Norman is taken into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #26. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the ''Ultimate Six'' limited series, Norman and Doctor Octopus devise a plan to escape from prison which uses Norman's new ability to transform into his Green Goblin form at will. It also seems that he is no longer under the influence of the hallucinogenic "plasmids" with Norman stating that he has been undergoing a "transitioning stage" during his last confrontation with Peter. Furthermore, his speech is more coherent in his Green Goblin form, suggesting that he is no longer hallucinating as a result of the OZ formula. They kidnap the unmasked Peter to force to join them. Osborn considers Spider-Man to be his "true" son and belongs with him, so he prevents harm to Peter, but he does humiliate the boy. In a battle between the [[Sinister Six|Ultimate Six]] and the [[Ultimates]] at the [[White House]], Harry is used as Fury's trump card against the Green Goblin.<ref>''Ultimate Six'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> Harry pleads with his father to stop while [[Captain America (Ultimate Marvel character)|Captain America]] convinces Peter of Osborn's lies. Norman is about to change back when [[Iron Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Iron Man]] blasts him from behind, severely altering Norman's genes and causing him to lash out at the S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel before being shot down to Harry's horror. Once again taken into custody, Osborn is revealed to be in cryogenic suspension, with half of his face in Goblin form.<ref>''Ultimate Six'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Osborn is again in a semblance of a human form and is kept in a high-security cell with other superhuman prisoners.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #112. Marvel Comics.</ref> When contacted by [[Carol Danvers]], Norman states that he will answer only to Fury; he then transforms into his Green Goblin form and breaks away from security measures, the OZ in his system having re-worked his body in a further process of what he refers to as '[[evolution]]'.<ref>{{Cite comic | Title = Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man | Issue = #112 |Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> The reader is given a look into his state of mind. Though no longer haunted by 'plasmids', the Goblin has given in to severe paranoia, believing everyone save him to be insane, and Fury a tyrant that imprisons anyone with the power to stand up.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #112-114. Marvel Comics.</ref> In his breakout, he enlists the promised help of [[Electro (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Electro]] as payback for freeing him; other supervillains that escape include [[Omega Red#Ultimate Marvel|Omega Red]], [[Kraven the Hunter#Ultimate Marvel|Kraven the Hunter]], and [[Gwen Stacy#Ultimate Marvel|Gwen Stacy]] ([[Carnage (character)#Ultimate Marvel|Carnage]]). The Goblin's strategy upon escape is simple; Norman appears on a talk show, claiming that Fury held him in a prison against his will, just as he was on the brink of creating a drug to solve [[United States of America|America]]'s military problems.{{issue|date=February 2013}} The Goblin goes into an explosive rage when confronted with a TV broadcast of a (staged) S.H.I.E.L.D. press conference with Harry declaring that Norman's evil and killed Harry's mother and ended up assaulting the S.H.I.E.L.D. [[Helicarrier]]; his son fights in a [[Hobgoblin (comics)|similar Goblin form]] but loses the resultant melee and is beaten to death suddenly and unexpectedly returns to his human form as his father is beating with full strength blows. With both the S.H.I.E.L.D. troops and the Goblin, horrified at what he's done, reverts to his own human form, turns around and asks to be killed. Danvers (in charge of S.H.I.E.L.D. while Fury is away) obliges him by shooting Norman in the head.<ref>{{Cite comic | Title = Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man | Issue = #117 |Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref>

However, Norman is able to survive the incident much to the surprise of himself and Danvers and was kept in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody under observation. Despite there being no trace of OZ left in his body, he was still able to transform into his Goblin form. He's then able to escape, along with Spider-Man's other villains: Doctor Octopus, Electro, [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Sandman]], Kraven and the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Vulture]]. They escape to New York and take shelter in a building. While S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Ultimates are preoccupied with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], Osborn informs the others that this is "God's will", telling them that God wants them to kill Spider-Man. When Doctor Octopus protests, the Goblin kills his former ally and then proceeds to Peter's house along with the remaining villains. In the resulting battle, the Goblin is apparently killed when Spider-Man literally smashes him with a truck. But Osborn is left powered-down in wreckage with a slight smile on his face, suggesting he may still be alive.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #156-157. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Months before his transformation and apparent death, Norman had [[Alternative versions of Venom#Ultimate Marvel|Dr. Conrad Markus]] somehow create another OZ-injected spider which later bites [[Miles Morales]],<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> indirectly due to [[Prowler (Marvel Comics)|Aaron Davis]] being hired by [[Donald Roxxon]].<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man'' #28 - December 2013</ref> It's later revealed that Osborn is still alive and being held custody by S.H.I.E.L.D until he escapes to confront the new Spider-Man.<ref>{{Cite comic | Title = Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man | Issue = #156| Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> Having escaped custody, the Goblin attacks Miles but Peter's intervention surprised everyone. It was discovered that the Oz Formula that affected Parker and Osborn gave them immortality. The Green Goblin is defeated with Osborn's body being immolated by Detective [[Maria Hill]].<ref>''Miles Morales: Ultimate Spider-Man'' #1-7. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Following the "[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]" storyline, the Green Goblin of Earth-1610 was restored and he was seen fighting Spider-Man and the Ultimates.<ref>''Spider-Men II'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When Empire State University's engineering facility comes under attack, Miles Morales as Spider-Man encounters the Green Goblin. When fighting him, Miles remembered this version of Goblin. During the fight with the Goblin, Miles is ambushed by a villain called Ultimatum who subdues with size-shifting powers. After somehow remembering Miles, Ultimatum grabs the Green Goblin and uses his rocket boots to make off with him.<ref>''Miles Morales: Spider-Man'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After he managed to obtain a sample of the drug that Ultimatum was producing, Spider-Man II was attacked again by the Green Goblin. Miles managed to defeat the Green Goblin and hand him over to the police.<ref>''Miles Morales: Spider-Man'' #14. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Green Goblin managed to escape and use his drug to turn people into smaller versions of himself called Goblinoids. With his Goblinoids, the Green Goblin led them in attacking Brooklyn Visions Academy. Though he was defeated by Spider-Man II again, the Goblin got away.<ref>''Miles Morales: Spider-Man'' #15. Marvel Comics.</ref>

It turns out that Ultimatum has been helping the Green Goblin in making an army of Goblinoids as part of his plot to take over Brooklyn. After escaping from Ultimatum, Miles' burner clones, and Ultimatum's henchmen, Spider-Man II and [[Prowler (comics)#Aaron Davis|Prowler]] run into the Green Goblin and the Goblinoids.<ref>''Miles Morales: Spider-Man'' #19. Marvel Comics.</ref> As Spider-Man II and Prowler fight the Goblinoids, the Green Goblin states that a pulse will go off where anyone who took the Goblinoid drug will turn into the next wave of Goblinoids. When the pulse activates, some Goblinoids attacked Captain America at the time when he was giving Miles' friends a ride. [[Jefferson Davis (comics)|Jefferson Davis]] shows up to aid Captain America in fighting the Goblinoids. Bombshell and Starling catch up to Spider-Man II and Prowler just as the Green Goblin catches up to them at Prospect Park. The Green Goblin starts to overwhelm Spider-Man II. In the nick of time, Captain America and Jefferson arrive. Spider-Man II beats up the Green Goblin as Jefferson prevents him from going too far. Just then, Ultimatum arrives.<ref>''Miles Morales: Spider-Man'' #20. Marvel Comics.</ref> Ultimatum, his henchmen, and the Goblinoids attack Spider-Man II, Captain America, Jefferson Davis, Prowler, Bombshell, and Starling. The Green Goblin recovers and attacks Prowler as Ultimatum plans to send Spider-Man II back to Earth-1610. Prowler sacrifices himself to give off a reverse ionic pulse explosion by overloading his suit. This ends up sending Ultimatum and the Green Goblin back to Earth-1610 causing the Goblinoids to regress back to their human form while the remaining henchmen of Ultimatum flee the area.<ref>''Miles Morales: Spider-Man'' #21. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Since the Green Goblin's powers is derived from the OZ formula, his strength derives from how much he is exposed to. The smaller dosage gives him green claws, horns and head, though the rest of him is human like in appearance. When he returns, he uses larger dosages of OZ to become larger and completely green, with more crests. When he overdoses on OZ, his horns, stature and muscles become larger, as does the number of crests. He later develops a way to transform without OZ into a larger, more powerful form, making injections obsolete.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #226. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Ultimate Six'' #1-6. Marvel Comics.</ref> This version appears to be effectively immortal, having resurrected and 'evolved' multiple times thus far despite the fact that he has been killed in multiple ways; the extent of and limitations to this conditional immortality is currently unknown.
