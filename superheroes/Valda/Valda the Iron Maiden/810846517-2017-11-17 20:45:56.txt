'''Valda the Iron Maiden''' is a [[fictional character]] created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Ernie Colón]] for [[DC Comics]]. She debuted in ''[[Arak (comics)|Arak, Son of Thunder]]'' #3 (August 1981).

Unlike other [[sword and sorcery|sword-and-sorcery]] [[heroine]]s (such as [[Red Sonja]]), Valda is practically dressed in a full [[mail (armour)|mail]] shirt, flat-heeled boots and (often) leather trousers.

==Fictional character biography==
Valda the Iron Maiden was a female knight and one of the Twelve Peers of [[Charlemagne|Carolus Magnus]]' court. She was born in [[Aachen|Aix-la-Chapelle]], [[Francia|Frankland]] in the 8th century A.D., the daughter of [[Bradamante]] and (reputedly) Carolus Magnus.

After her mother's death in the ambush at [[Roncesvalles]], Valda was brought up by Carolus Magnus, his court [[magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]] [[Maugris|Malagigi]] and Bishop [[Turpin (archbishop)|Turpin]]. She was tutored as a swordswoman by the [[ghost]] of [[Amadis de Gaula|Amadis of Gaul]], who she had summoned with a spell that she had overheard Malagigi using. Initially refused knighthood by the king, she posed as the "Knight All in Scarlet" and defeated her uncle, the great knight [[Renaud de Montauban|Rinaldo]], in a joust to earn the honour.

She was 5' 6" tall, weighed 113&nbsp;lbs, and had blue eyes and dark brown hair.

She first met [[Arak, Son of Thunder]] while she was under the spell of the sorcerer [[Baledor]] and later joined him in searching for Malagigi who had been captured by the sorceress Angelica. Valda and Arak adventured together and fell in love.<ref>[http://www.dcuguide.com/who.php?name=valda The Unofficial Valda the Iron Maiden Biography<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://mightygodking.com/index.php/2008/08/14/thursday-whos-who-valda-the-iron-maiden/ Mightygodking.com &raquo; Blog Archive  &raquo; Thursday WHO&#8217;S WHO: Valda (The Iron Maiden)]</ref>
