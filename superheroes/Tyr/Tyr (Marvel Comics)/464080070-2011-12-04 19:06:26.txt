'''Tyr''' is a [[fictional character]], an [[Asgardians (comics)|Asgardian]] god in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|Universe]], loosely based on the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] [[Tyr|god of the same name]]. Along with [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and [[Balder (comics)|Balder]], he is one of [[Odin (comics)|Odin]]'s biological sons.<ref>''Thor'' #611</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Tyr is the Asgardian god of war. Tyr was renowned throughout [[Asgard (Marvel Comics)|Asgard]] as being the only god brave enough to place his hand in the mouth of the wolf-god [[Fenris Wolf (Marvel Comics)|Fenris]] during the latter's binding which Fenris would not allow unless a god placed his hand in his mouth; his left hand is missing as a result, having been bitten off by Fenris, and is now usually covered by a metal cup. He has fought in the defense of Asgard numerous times.  He has several times rebelled against [[Odin (comics)|Odin]] due to his love of battle and fought [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] due to resentment of Thor's relationship with [[Sif (comics)|Sif]] and the fact Thor usurped his role as Asgard's greatest warrior. Once he was nearly exiled for this, but Thor pled for mercy.

Tyr battled with Asgardian forces against a false Ragnarok which Odin had engineered to delay the real Ragnarok.<ref>''Thor'' #275</ref> He later lost a friendly wager to Thor over whether his strength had declined after battling the Celestials.<ref>''Thor'' #302</ref> Tyr later allied with [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] against Odin, and captured the goddess [[Idunn (comics)|Idunn]] and her Golden Apples of Immortality, without which the gods would grow old and perish. He unleashed the [[Midgard Serpent (Marvel Comics)|Midgard Serpent]] on Earth when it had been strengthened by the Apples, and it is used as a bridge by their army to attack Asgard. With the enemies of Asgard, he followed Odin and the other gods to Earth, where he was betrayed by Loki and defeated by Odin.<ref>''Thor'' #324-327</ref> Alongside [[Beta Ray Bill]], the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], the [[Fantastic Four]], and the Asgardian forces, Tyr battled [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]]'s demons on Earth; Tyr then returned to Asgard.<ref>''Thor'' #350-352, 359</ref> He also fought in the defense of Asgard against the Egyptian death-god [[Seth (Marvel Comics)|Seth]].{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

During the events of Ragnarok, Tyr fought alongside Beta Ray Bill and the armies of Asgard against Surtur, the Fire Demons, trolls and giants, and perished during battle.<ref>''Thor'' Vol. 2 #85</ref>

During the ''[[Siege (comics)|Siege]]'' of Asgard, Tyr was present with the Asgardians when news of [[Volstagg]] turning himself over to the Broxton authorities reaches Asgard.<ref>''Thor'' #607</ref> He assumes command of the Asgardian forces when Balder takes leave but is seriously wounded by The [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s Norn stones.<ref>''Thor'' #608</ref> Tyr then leads the spirits of the fallen Asgardians, but it is revealed that he is not dead, but close to it.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #11</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Tyr is a member of the race of superhumans known as Asgardians, and therefore has superhuman strength, speed, stamina, durability, agility, and reflexes, and has an extremely long life span and immunity to all Earthly diseases as well as some resistance to magic. Tyr, being the god of war, is not only highly skilled at hand-to-hand combat but proficient with all forms of Asgardian weaponry as well. Even after the destruction of Asgard, Tyr has revealed a special ability, a hidden power enabling him to summon forth "the soul of the God of War", releasing destructive energies through his severed hand.<ref>''Thor'' #613</ref>

He usually carries a sword and shield. Tyr once stole the Mace of the Myth-Wars, a weapon once wielded by Odin and possessing powers similar to Thor's hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]], as well as the ability to teleport between adjacent universes, such as Midgard and Asgard. Tyr believed that the enchanted mace was "equal to the challenge of mystic Mjolnir" and has shown itself capable of knocking back even Thor. During the combat, the Mace is destroyed by Thor using his lightning.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 1 #312</ref>

==In other media==
===Video games===
* Tyr appears in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'', voiced by [[Trev Broudy]]. He was seen defeated and was being guarded by the [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]] and the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]] with him hanging over lava. The player must battle through Tyr's personal workshops in order to free him and has to cool the lava before lowering him.
