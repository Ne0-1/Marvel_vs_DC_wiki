The '''Red Guardian''' is the name of several [[comic book]] [[superhero]]es in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  The Red Guardian is an indentity that was created as the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] equivalent of [[Captain America]]; since the fall of the Soviet Union, the name has fallen into disuse.

'''Alexei Alanovich Shostakov''' was the husband of Natasha Romanovna.  Both he and his wife became agents of the Soviets: she became the [[Black Widow (comics)|Black Widow]], while he became the Red Guardian.  He fought [[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]], but was later thought to have died saving their lives.  He first appeared in ''Avengers'' #43 and was presumably killed in the next issue.  Shostakov was later revealed to be alive and had risen very high up in power within [[Bulgaria]].  He became responsible for a plot to capture his former wife, the Black Widow, and try her for her crimes as a Soviet super soldier.  Natasha foiled his plan with the help of [[Daredevil]] and the Avengers.

Dr. '''Tania Belinsky''', a neurosurgeon from the USSR, later adopted the costumed identity of the Red Guardian and joined [[Defenders (comics)|The Defenders]].  Created by Steve Gerber and Sal Buscema, she first appeared in ''The Defenders'' #35 (May 1976).

Tania fell under the influence of Sergei Krylov, alias the '''Presence''', a mad scientific genius who had become one of the most influential men behind the scenes of the Soviet government.  He used a [[Chernobyl]]-like nuclear disaster to transform Tania into his super-powered thrall, now called '''Starlight'''.  Since her mutation by the Presence, Tania continually emits harmful radiation which she can harness for a variety of effects, including superhuman strength and durability, flight, and energy blasts.

The next Red Guardian '''Josef Petkus''', who appeared as a member of the militant [[Supreme Soviets]] (later called the [[People's Protectorate]]) in ''Captain America'' #353.  He later joined the post-Soviet [[Russia]]n superteam called the [[Winter Guard]], now calling himself the '''Steel Guardian'''.

Another Red Guardian, named '''Krassno Granitsky''', appeared in ''[[Maverick (comics)|Maverick]]'' #10.  He teamed up with the mercenary superhero Maverick to battle a crime lord.

It was later revealed that there had been a Red Guardian active during [[World War II]].  This man first appeared in ''[[Namor]] Annual'' #1 ([[1991]]), where he fought alongside [[Invaders (comics)|The Invaders]].

A Red Guardian appeared in the first issue of Ed Brubaker's Captain America, where he was executed by a rogue soviet general.

None of the Red Guardians have possessed [[superhuman]] powers or abilities, with the exception of Tania Belinsky after her mutation by the Presence.  All are highly skilled athletes.  All of the Guardians but Tania have used a [[steel]] [[shield]] similar to that used by Captain America; Tania used a throwing [[disc]] that was a part of her costume's [[Buckle|belt buckle]].
