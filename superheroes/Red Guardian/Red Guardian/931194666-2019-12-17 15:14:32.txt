'''Red Guardian''' (Russian: Красный страж, ''Krasnyy Strazh'') is the name of several fictional [[superhero]]es appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The Red Guardian is an identity that was created as the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] equivalent of [[Captain America]], although its use has continued after the fall of the Soviet Union. 

[[David Harbour]] will portray the Alexei Shostakov incarnation of Red Guardian, in the 2020 film ''[[Black Widow (2020 film)|Black Widow]]'' set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nerdist.com/article/everything-we-know-about-black-widow/|title=Everything We Know About BLACK WIDOW|website=Nerdist|access-date=2019-07-21}}</ref> 

==Aleksey Lebedev==
'''Aleksey Lebedev''' Russian: Алексей Лебедев , the Golden Age version of Red Guardian, first appeared in ''Namor, The Sub-Mariner Annual'' #1 (June 1991), created by writers Dana Moreshead and Mike Thomas, and artist [[Phil Hester (comics)|Phil Hester]]. Very little is known of him, but he fought alongside [[Spirit of '76 (Marvel Comics)|Captain America]] (William Naslund) and the [[Namor|Sub-Mariner]] at the [[Potsdam Conference]], in July, 1945.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/redgrd.htm |title=Red Guardian (Russian, World War II, Captain America ally) |publisher=Marvunapp.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-12}}</ref> He began his career during World War II and met the [[All-Winners Squad]] (formerly the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]]) on only one recorded occasion, shortly after the war's end.{{issue|date=November 2010}} Like the other crusaders of the same name, he was created as a Soviet counterpart to Captain America.{{issue|date=March 2013}} He was later apparently killed during the purges of the 1950s, opposing the brutal experiments that would later create his successor.<ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Update 2010'' #4</ref>

==Alexei Shostakov==
'''Alexei Alanovich Shostakov''' was the second version of Red Guardian, and was created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[John Buscema]].

Alexei Shostakov was born in [[Moscow]], and was the husband of Natasha Romanova. Both he and his wife became agents of the Soviets: the latter as the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] while the former became a test pilot and KGB agent and then trained as a Soviet counterpart to Captain America as the "Red Guardian".

Alexei Shostakov was one of the Soviet Union's most acclaimed pilots. During World War II on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], he shot down a large number of [[Luftwaffe]] fighter planes in aerial battles and was credited for helping the [[Soviet Air Force]] win air supremacy over the skies of [[Stalingrad]] and [[Kursk]]. Because of his extraordinary skill, Shostakov was chosen for the most secret and dangerous tests and new aircraft for the Soviet Union. This included being the first pilot to test fly the [[MiG-15]]. The Soviet state controlled news media greatly publicized this and certain other missions of his such as his aerial battles against the [[U.S. Air Force]] over [[MiG Alley]] during the [[Korean War]]. As a result, Shostakov was decorated as a hero of the Soviet Union. Shostakov was also successful in his private life, having married the equally famous ballerina Natalie (familiarly known as Natasha) Romanova.

As the Cold War flared up in the 1950s, Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] realized that the Soviet Union needed its own equivalent to Captain America. Khrushchev chose Alexi Shostakov over [[Yuri Gagarin]] who would later become the first man in space. The KGB faked his death and trained him in secret, keeping his survival a secret from Natasha. He became a master of hand-to-hand combat and a highly skilled athlete. In addition, he carried a throwing disc on his belt which could be used against an opponent. Magnetic force returned the disc after throwing. The disc had the yellow hammer and sickle symbol on it and his costume was red with a star on his chest to symbolise the Soviet flag. While the Black Widow became disillusioned with KGB masters and defected to the United States, the Red Guardian remained loyal and became more ruthless and vindictive. The Red Guardian battled the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] with his Chinese ally Colonel Ling, to protect a Communist Chinese secret weapon located at a secret military base at an unrevealed location in the People's Republic of China, encountering the Black Widow and [[Captain America]] (Steve Rogers). When the Black Widow noticed "something familiar" about him, Red Guardian revealed his identity. He was shot and mortally wounded minutes later by Colonel Ling while saving the lives of the Black Widow and Captain America. He was buried under molten lava when the laser blast caused the eruption of a long-dormant volcano.<ref>''Avengers'' #43-44</ref>

Some time later, a [[Life Model Decoy]] was patterned after Alexei Shostakov was introduced in the "[[Widowmaker (Marvel Comics)|Widow Maker]]" crossover between the ''[[Hawkeye & Mockingbird]]'' and ''Black Widow'' titles as '''[[Ronin (Marvel Comics)|Ronin]]'''.<ref>''Widowmaker'' #1 (February 2011)</ref> The LMD initially starts assassinating spies and eventually targets [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]] and Black Widow. After he was seemingly destroyed in his first battle with the Black Widow,<ref>''Marvel Graphic Novel'' Vol. 1 #61</ref> the LMD was later revealed to be alive and had risen very high up in power within [[Bulgaria]] as Ronin. The LMD was responsible for a plot to capture and try his "former wife" for crimes as a Soviet super soldier but his plan is foiled with the help of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and the Avengers.<ref>''Daredevil'' Vol. 2 #64</ref>

[[David Harbour]] will portray the character in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film [[Black Widow (2020 film)|Black Widow]] (2020).

Alongside the Supreme Soviets, he attacked the [[Soviet Super-Soldiers]] for defecting from the Soviet Union. Alongside Captain America, he later battled a bear-like creature composed of the [[Darkforce]].<ref>''Captain America'' #352-353</ref> The Supreme Soviets were later renamed the post-Soviet [[Russia]]n super-team called the [[Winter Guard]]. Alongside this confederacy, he teamed with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and [[Alpha Flight]] to battle the Peace Corpse, the [[Homo mermanus|Atlantean]] Army, and the Combine.<ref>''Avengers'' #319-324</ref> Petkus later joined a Winter Guard splinter group called the [[People's Protectorate]], now calling himself the "Steel Guardian".<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 3, #9</ref> When he and his team went off in search of the timelord [[Immortus]] hoping to find a way to resurrect Vanguard's sister, Lanyia.

Alexei and Tania used a "belt-buckle" disc, a hurling weapon which magnetically returned to the wearer's hand when thrown, and was a part of their costume's [[Buckle|belt buckle]]. The fourth Red Guardian; Josef Petkus often employed an energized sword as a secondary armament alongside his shield.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' Vol 1 #393 May 1, 1992</ref> The sixth Red Guardian was an LMD named Anton, whose powers are cybernetic based. His falsified backstory was that he's an expert engineer and former Crimson Dynamo pilot, his real strength lies in his moderate degree of enhanced cybernetic physicality.
