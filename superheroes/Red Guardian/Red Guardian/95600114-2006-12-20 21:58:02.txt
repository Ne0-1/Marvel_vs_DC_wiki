The '''Red Guardian''' is the name of several [[comic book]] [[superhero]]es in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. The Red Guardian is an identity that was created as the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] equivalent of [[Captain America]]; since the fall of the Soviet Union, the name has fallen into disuse.

== Character history ==
Many people have taken up the mantle of Red Guardian:

=== Golden Age Red Guardian ===
A Golden Age version of the Red Guardian appeared first in ''Namor, The Sub-Mariner Annual'' # 1.  Very little is known of him, but he fought along side [[Spirit of '76 (comics)|Captain America (William Naslund)]] and the [[Sub-Mariner]] shortly after V-E Day.

=== Alexei Shostakov ===
'''Alexei Alanovich Shostakov''' was the husband of Natasha Romanova. Both he and his wife became agents of the Soviets: she became the [[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]], while he became the Red Guardian. He fought the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], but was later thought to have died saving their lives.  He first appeared in ''Avengers'' # 43 and was presumably killed in the next issue.  Shostakov was later revealed to be alive and had risen very high up in power within [[Bulgaria]].  He became responsible for a plot to capture his former wife, the Black Widow, and try her for her crimes as a Soviet super soldier.  Natasha foiled his plan with the help of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] and the Avengers.

This was the first character named Red Guardian, and was created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[John Buscema]].

=== Dr. Tania Belinsky ===

Dr. '''Tania Belinsky''', a neurosurgeon from the USSR, later adopted the costumed identity of the Red Guardian and joined the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].  Created by [[Steve Gerber]] and [[Sal Buscema]], she first appeared in ''Defenders'' # 35 (May 1976).

Tania fell under the influence of Sergei Krylov, alias the "[[Presence (Marvel Comics)|Presence]]", a mad scientific genius who had become one of the most influential men behind the scenes of the Soviet government.  He used a [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]]-like nuclear disaster to transform Tania into his super-powered thrall, currently called '''Starlight'''.  Since her mutation by the Presence, Tania continually emits harmful radiation which she can harness for a variety of effects, including superhuman strength and durability, flight, and energy blasts.

=== Josef Petkus ===

The next Red Guardian '''Josef Petkus''', who appeared as a member of the militant [[Supreme Soviets]] (later called the [[People's Protectorate]]) in ''Captain America'' # 353.  He later joined post-Soviet [[Russia]]n superteam the [[Winter Guard]], now calling himself the '''Steel Guardian'''.

=== Krassno Granitsky ===
Another Red Guardian, named '''Krassno Granitsky''', appeared in ''[[Maverick (comics)|Maverick]]'' # 10.  He teamed up with the mercenary superhero Maverick to battle a crime lord.

=== The sixth Red Guardian ===
A Red Guardian appeared in the first issue of [[Ed Brubaker]]'s Captain America, where he was executed by [[Aleksander Lukin]].

=== Ultimate Red Guardian ===
A version of the character appeared in the mini-series [[Ultimate Nightmare]]. This version of the character is a Russian super soldier, meant to be their Captain America. After a fight between the two, Captain America defeats him, by stabbing him with splintered wood that acts as a stake through the chest, declaring "Fighting is about winning".

== Powers and abilities ==
None of the Red Guardians have possessed [[superhuman]] powers or abilities, with the exception of Tania Belinsky after her mutation by the Presence.  All are highly skilled athletes. All of the Guardians but Alexei and Tania have used a [[steel]] [[shield]] similar to that used by Captain America; Alexei and Tania used a throwing [[disc]] that was a part of their costume's [[Buckle|belt buckle]].
