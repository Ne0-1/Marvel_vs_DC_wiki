The '''Red Guardian''' (Russian: Красный страж, ''Krasnij Straj'') is the name of several fictional [[superhero]]es appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The Red Guardian is an identity that was created as the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] equivalent of [[Captain America]]; since the fall of the Soviet Union, the name is no longer officially used, though at least two people have claimed the name.

==Fictional character biography==
Many people have taken up the mantle of Red Guardian:

===Aleksey Lebedev===
Aleksey Lebedev, the Golden Age version of Red Guardian, first appeared in ''Namor, The Sub-Mariner Annual'' #1. Very little is known of him, but he fought alongside [[Spirit of '76 (Marvel Comics)|Captain America]] (William Naslund) and the [[Namor|Sub-Mariner]] at the [[Potsdam Conference]], in July, 1945.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/redgrd.htm |title=Red Guardian (Russian, World War II, Captain America ally) |publisher=Marvunapp.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-12}}</ref> He began his career during World War II and met the [[All-Winners Squad]] (formerly the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]]) on only one recorded occasion, shortly after the war's end.{{issue|date=November 2010}} Like the other crusaders of the same name, he was created as a Soviet counterpart to Captain America.{{issue|date=March 2013}} He was later apparently killed during the purges of the 1950s, opposing the brutal experiments that would later create his successor.<ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Update 2010''#4</ref>

'''Alexei Alanovich Shostakov''' was the second version of Red Guardian, and was created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[John Buscema]].

====Fictional character biography====
Alexei Shostakov was born in [[Moscow]], and was the husband of Natasha Romanova. Both he and his wife became agents of the Soviets: the latter became the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] while the former became a test pilot and KGB agent and then trained as a Soviet counterpart to Captain America as the "Red Guardian".

Alexei Shostakov was one of the Soviet Union's most acclaimed pilots. During World War II on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], he shot down a large number of [[Luftwaffe]] fighter planes in aerial battles and was credited for helping the [[Soviet Air Force]] win air supremacy over the skies of [[Stalingrad]] and [[Kursk]]. Because of his extraordinary skill, Shostakov was chosen for the most secret and dangerous tests and new aircraft for the Soviet Union. This included being the first pilot to test fly the [[Mig 15]]. The Soviet state controlled news media greatly publicized this and certain other missions of his such as his aerial battles against the [[U.S. Air Force]] over [[MiG Alley]] during the [[Korean War]]. As a result, Shostakov was decorated as a hero of the Soviet Union. Shostakov was also successful in his private life, having married the equally famous ballerina Natalie (familiarly known as Natasha) Romanova.

As the Cold War flared up in the 1950s, Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] realized that the Soviet Union needed its own equivalent to Captain America. Khrushchev chose Alexi Shostakov over [[Yuri Gagarin]] who would later become the first man in space. The KGB faked his death and trained him in secret, keeping his survival a secret from Natasha. He became a master of hand-to-hand combat and a highly skilled athlete. In addition, he carried a throwing disc on his belt which could be used against an opponent. Magnetic force returned the disc after throwing. The disc had the yellow hammer and sickle symbol on it and his costume was red with a star on his chest to symbolise the Soviet flag. While the Black Widow became disillusioned with her KGB masters and defected to the United States, the Red Guardian remained loyal and became more ruthless and vindictive. The Red Guardian battled the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] with his Chinese ally Colonel Ling, to protect a Communist Chinese secret weapon located at a secret military base at an unrevealed location in the People's Republic of China, encountering the Black Widow and [[Captain America]] (Steve Rogers). When the Black Widow noticed "something familiar" about him, he revealed his identity to her. He was shot and mortally wounded minutes later by Colonel Ling while saving the lives of the Black Widow and Captain America. He was buried under molten lava when the laser blast caused the eruption of a long-dormant volcano.<ref>''Avengers'' #43-44</ref>

Some time later, a [[Life Model Decoy]] was patterned after Shostakov. It was destroyed in its first battle with the Black Widow.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Shostakov was much later revealed to be alive and had risen very high up in power within [[Bulgaria]] as [[Ronin (Marvel Comics)|Ronin]]. He became responsible for a plot to capture Natasha and try his former wife for crimes as a Soviet super soldier. Natasha foiled his plan with the help of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and the Avengers.<ref>''Daredevil'', vol. 2, #64</ref>

===Dr. Tania Belinsky===
{{Main|Starlight (Marvel Comics)}}
Dr. Tania Belinsky, a neurosurgeon from the USSR, later adopted the costumed identity of Red Guardian and joined the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. Created by [[Steve Gerber]] and [[Sal Buscema]], she first appeared in ''Defenders'' #35 (May 1976).

All of the Guardians but Alexei and Tania have used a steel shield similar to that used by Captain America.
