The '''Red Guardian''' is the name of several [[comic book]] [[superhero]]es in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. The Red Guardian is an identity that was created as the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] equivalent of [[Captain America]]; since the fall of the Soviet Union, the name is no longer officially used, though at least two people have claimed the name.

==Fictional character biography==
Many people have taken up the mantle of Red Guardian:

===Golden Age Red Guardian===
A Golden Age version of the Red Guardian appeared first in ''Namor, The Sub-Mariner Annual'' # 1.  Very little is known of him, but he fought along side [[Spirit of '76 (comics)|Captain America (William Naslund)]] and the [[Sub-Mariner]] shortly after V-E Day.

===Alexei Shostakov===
'''Alexei Alanovich Shostakov''' was born in [[Moscow]], and was the husband of Natasha Romanova. Both he and his wife became agents of the Soviets: she became the [[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]], while he became the Red Guardian. He fought the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], but was later thought to have died saving their lives.<ref>''Avengers'' #44</ref>  Shostakov was much later revealed to be alive and had risen very high up in power within [[Bulgaria]].  He became responsible for a plot to capture his former wife, the Black Widow, and try her for her crimes as a Soviet super soldier.  Natasha foiled his plan with the help of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] and the Avengers.  The Red Guardian was killed in an explosion when his Chinese ally's base exploded.

This was the first character named Red Guardian, and was created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[John Buscema]].

===Dr. Tania Belinsky===
{{main|Starlight (comics)}}
Dr. '''Tania Belinsky''', a neurosurgeon from the USSR, later adopted the costumed identity of the Red Guardian and joined the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].  Created by [[Steve Gerber]] and [[Sal Buscema]], she first appeared in ''Defenders'' # 35 (May 1976).

===Josef Petkus===

The next Red Guardian '''Josef Petkus''', who appeared as a member of the militant [[Supreme Soviets]] (later called the [[People's Protectorate]]) in ''Captain America'' # 352.  He later joined post-Soviet [[Russia]]n super-team the [[Winter Guard]], now calling himself the '''Steel Guardian'''.

===Krassno Granitsky===
Another Red Guardian, named '''Krassno Granitsky''', appeared in ''[[David North (comics)|Maverick]]'' # 10.  He teamed up with the mercenary superhero Maverick to battle a crime lord.

===The sixth Red Guardian===
A Red Guardian appeared in the first issue of [[Ed Brubaker]]'s Captain America, where he was executed by [[Aleksander Lukin]]. Note that he may not be actually the sixth Red Guardian -- there might have been further men using that identity between the first Guardian and Shostakov, or even between Shostakov and Petkus.

===Ultimate Red Guardian===
A version of the character appeared in the mini-series [[Ultimate Nightmare]]. This version of the character is a Russian super soldier, meant to be their Captain America. After a fight between the two, Captain America defeats him, by stabbing him with splintered wood that acts as a stake through the chest, declaring "Fighting is about winning".  This version is certifiably insane and uses a makeshift shield created partially from human remains, and possesses superhuman strength and durability.

== Powers and abilities ==
None of the Red Guardians have possessed [[superhuman]] powers or abilities, with the exception of Tania Belinsky after her mutation by the Presence.  All are highly skilled athletes. All of the Guardians but Alexei and Tania have used a [[steel]] [[shield]] similar to that used by Captain America; Alexei and Tania used a throwing disc that was a part of their costume's [[Buckle|belt buckle]].
