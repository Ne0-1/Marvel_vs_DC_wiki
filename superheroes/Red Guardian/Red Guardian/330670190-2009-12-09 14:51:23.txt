The '''Red Guardian''' is the name of several [[comic book]] [[superhero]]es in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. The Red Guardian is an identity that was created as the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] equivalent of [[Captain America]]; since the fall of the Soviet Union, the name is no longer officially used, though at least two people have claimed the name.

==Fictional character biography==
Many people have taken up the mantle of Red Guardian:

===Golden Age Red Guardian===
A Golden Age version of the Red Guardian appeared first in ''Namor, The Sub-Mariner Annual'' # 1.  Very little is known of him, but he fought alongside [[Spirit of '76 (comics)|Captain America (William Naslund)]] and the [[Sub-Mariner]] at the [[Potsdam Conference]], in July, 1945. [http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/redgrd.htm] He began his career during World War II and met the [[All-Winners Squad]] (formerly the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]]) on only one recorded occasion, shortly after the war's end. Like the other crusaders of the same name, he was created as a Soviet counterpart to Captain America. His costume differed markedly from those of his successors.

====Fictional character biography====
'''Alexei Alanovich Shostakov''' was born in [[Moscow]], and was the husband of Natasha Romanova. Both he and his wife became agents of the Soviets: she became the [[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]], while he became a test pilot and KGB agent, and then trained as a Soviet counterpart to Captain America as the Red Guardian. The KGB faked his death and trained him in secret, keeping his survival a secret from Natasha. He became a master of hand-to-hand combat and an expert athlete. In addition, he carried a throwing disc on his belt which could be used against an opponent. Magnetic force returned the disc after throwing. While the Black Widow became disillusioned with her KGB masters and defected to the United States, the Red Guardian remained loyal and became more ruthless and vindictive. The Red Guardian battled the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] with his Chinese ally Colonel Ling, to protect a Communist Chinese secret weapon located at a secret military base at an unrevealed location in the People's Republic of China, encountering the Black Widow and [[Captain America]]. When the Black Widow noticed "something familiar" about him, he revealed his identity to her. He was shot and mortally wounded minutes later by Colonel Ling while saving the lives of the Black Widow and Captain America. He was buried under molten lava when the laser blast caused the eruption of a long-dormant volcano.<ref>''Avengers'' #43-44</ref>

Some time later, an [[Life Model Decoy|LMD]] was patterned after Shostakov. It was destroyed in its first battle with the Black Widow.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Shostakov was much later revealed to be alive and had risen very high up in power within [[Bulgaria]].  He became responsible for a plot to capture his former wife, the Black Widow, and try her for her crimes as a Soviet super soldier.  Natasha foiled his plan with the help of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] and the Avengers.<ref>''Daredevil'', vol. 2, #64</ref>

===Dr. Tania Belinsky===
{{Main|Starlight (comics)}}

== Powers and abilities ==
None of the Red Guardians have been revealed to possess [[superhuman]] powers or abilities, with the exception of Tania Belinsky after her mutation by the Presence, the Ultimate version, and the seventh Red Guardian.  All are highly skilled athletes. Shostakov was an expert pilot. All of the Guardians but Alexei and Tania have used a [[steel]] [[shield]] similar to that used by Captain America; Alexei and Tania used a "belt-buckle" disc, a hurling weapon which magnetically returned to the wearer's hand when thrown, and was a part of their costume's [[Buckle|belt buckle]]. The powers and abilities of the seventh Red Guardian have not yet been fully revealed, though he is an expert engineer, former Crimson Dynamo pilot, and has some degree of enhanced cybernetic strength.

A version of the character appeared in the mini-series [[Ultimate Nightmare]]. This version of the character is a Russian super soldier, meant to be their Captain America.
