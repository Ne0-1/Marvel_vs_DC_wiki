It was written by [[Chris Claremont]] and illustrated by [[John Buscema]] and [[Tom Palmer]].

==Publication==
Because of the popularity of the ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' during the 1980s under Chris Claremont, a number of mutant related properties were created, most notably ''[[The New Mutants]]''. One of these X-Books was ''Magik (Storm and Illyana Limited Series)''.

==Continuity==
The main plot takes place in mere seconds of [[Canon (fiction)|canonical]] Marvel time, but covers 7 years of Illyana's life in [[Limbo (comics)#Demonic Limbo|Limbo]]. The events occur during ''The Uncanny X-Men'' #160 (August 82) and ''The New Mutants'' #13-14 (March-April 84). In X-Men #160 Illyana is kidnapped by Belasco at age 6 and returns in the same issue at age 13.

==Plot==
''Magik (Illyana and Storm Limited Series)'' details the transition of Illyana Rasputin from a 6 year old child to a 13 year old mutant/sorceress.  The narrative takes place as a flashback on Illyana's 14th birthday, which would have been her 8th, had she not travelled to Limbo.

==="Little Girl Lost" December 1983===
[[Belasco]], demon lord of Limbo, wants to use Illyana to help the Elder Gods destroy Earth. To do this he has to place five bloodstones in a pentagon locket he has given to Illyana. When he first captures her at age six, he takes part of her soul and remakes it in his image, creating a bloodstone which he places this in the locket. Other dimensional versions of [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] and [[Kitty Pryde]] (Cat) then rescue Illyana. The old, sorceress version of Storm is a former apprentice of Belasco's and the three of them end up at Storm's garden sactuary in Limbo. Storm explains the magic of life to Illyana, showing her a massive oak while they are in an ethereal state. When they return to their corporeal forms, Illyana is one year older (seven) and has unspecified magic powers. Cat, who is part beast, then kidnaps her.<ref>{{Comic book reference
