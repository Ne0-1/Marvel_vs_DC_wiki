'''''Magik (Storm and Illyana Limited Series)''''' was a four-issue [[comic book]] [[limited series]] published by [[Marvel Comics]] in 1983&ndash;1984, starring the [[fictional character]] [[Magik (comics)|Magik]]. It was written by [[Chris Claremont]] and illustrated by [[John Buscema]], [[Ron Frenz]], [[Sal Buscema]],  and [[Tom Palmer (comics)|Tom Palmer]].

==Publication==
Because of the popularity of the ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' during the 1980s under Chris Claremont, a number of mutant related properties were created, most notably ''[[The New Mutants]]''. One of these X-Books was ''Magik (Storm and Illyana Limited Series)''.

==Continuity==
The main plot takes place in mere seconds of [[Canon (fiction)|canonical]] Marvel time, but covers 7 years of Illyana's life in [[Otherplace|Limbo]]. The events occur between panels of ''The Uncanny X-Men'' #160 (August '82), with a very brief cameo in ''The New Mutants'' #14 (April '84). In X-Men #160 Illyana is kidnapped by Belasco at age 6 and returns in the same issue at age 13.

==Plot==
''Magik (Illyana and Storm Limited Series)'' details the transition of Illyana Rasputin from a 6-year-old child to a 13-year-old mutant/sorceress.  The narrative takes place as a flashback on Illyana's 15th birthday, which would have been her 8th had she not travelled to Limbo.

==="Little Girl Lost" (December 1983)===
[[Belasco]], demon lord of Limbo, wants to use Illyana to help the Elder Gods destroy Earth. To do this he has to place five bloodstones in a pentagon locket he has given to Illyana. When he first captures her at age six, he takes part of her soul and remakes it in his image, creating a bloodstone which he places this in the locket. Other dimensional versions of [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] and [[Kitty Pryde]] (Cat) then rescue Illyana. The old, sorceress version of Storm is a former apprentice of Belasco's and the three of them end up at Storm's garden sanctuary in Limbo. Storm explains the magic of life to Illyana, showing her a massive oak while they are in an ethereal state. When they return to their corporeal forms, Illyana is one year older (seven) and has unspecified magic powers. Cat, who is part beast, then kidnaps her.<ref name="magik1">{{Comic book reference

==="Cold Iron Hot Blood" (January 1984)===
Cat takes Illyana to a replication of the [[Savage Land]] in Limbo and teaches her to sword fight. This takes roughly two years, and Illyana is nine when they finish. They then storm Belasco's tower. It is protected by a corrupted version of [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] whom Cat kills. Cat then attempts to use her phasing power to take her and Illyana to Earth, but Belasco intercepts them. Belasco turns Cat into a feline demon and gives Illyana a knife. Illyana then cuts herself, and the blood forms the second bloodstone in the locket.<ref name="magik2">{{Comic book reference

The enchantment that held her in Storm's garden is banished in the process and she takes a stepping disc to confront Belasco. While fighting Belasco she realizes she will become irrevocably evil if she kills him, so she spares his life and he escapes. She then uses a light circle to rejoin the X-Men, seconds after she had left them. Illyana is now approximately 13 years old.<ref>{{Comic book reference
