'''Kaine''' is a fictional character, a [[Marvel Comics]] [[villain]] or [[anti-hero]] and enemy of [[Spider-Man]].  The character first appeared in ''Web of Spider-Man'' #119, and is the Jackal's first failed attempt at cloning Peter Parker.  The character was created by Terry Kavanagh and Steven Butler.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

==Fictional character biography==
===The birth of Kaine===
Kaine is the Jackal's first temporary success at cloning Peter Parker but, due to the flawed cloning process is left deformed and mentally unstable.

The Jackal discards Kaine because the clone starts showing early signs of the degeneration process, and Kaine experiences a strong feeling of rejection similar to that between a father and son.  Kaine realizes the partial degeneration also caused a slight amplification of the powers he "inherited" from Peter.  Not only has his strength, speed, and agility been copied from the original Peter's, but he gains a "precognitive sense" that shows him flashes of the future (an amplified version of Peter's spider-sense).  He also possesses a "Mark of Kaine," a corrosive touch that he uses to leave eaten away hand prints on his victims' faces.  Though never explicitly stated within the story, in a later interview<ref>http://lifeofreillyarchives.blogspot.com/2008/03/part-9.html</ref>
former Spider-Man editor/writer [[Glenn Greenberg]] revealed that the Mark of Kaine was meant to be another analog of one of Spider-Man's powers, namely the ability to cling to walls.

The Jackal goes on to create a new, better clone; the man who would become [[Ben Reilly]]. When the Jackal uses Reilly against Peter, the ensuing battle leaves Reilly and the Jackal for dead. They both manage to survive; the Jackal places himself into suspended animation in a cloning pod to awaken later; and Reilly leaves New York.

Behind the scenes, [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] manages to have the files on Ben and Peter switched, so the Jackal would think Peter is the clone and Ben is the real deal. Consulting the Jackal's files, Kaine also believes the same, so he follows Ben Reilly through his "exile". For a time, he finds love in the arms of police detective Louise Kennedy of Salt Lake City, until he discovers she is working for the criminals. This revelation, coupled with Kaine's increased cellular degeneration, pushes Kaine even further towards insanity and he kills Louise. Kaine continues to stalk Ben, making it appear as though Janine Godbe, Ben's new love, has committed suicide. Kaine, hoping to give the man who he thinks is the clone (Peter) the life he could never have, frames Ben for a number of murders he commits since both men have the same fingerprints.

===Trial of Peter Parker===
Peter Parker is eventually tried and convicted for Kaine's crimes since he, too, had the same fingerprints. Although Peter goes to prison for some time, Ben arranges to take his place in prison.

Kaine wanders New York, defeating and executing scores of Spider-Man's enemies. They grow fearful of him and form coalitions to protect themselves proactively, but meet with little success.

Peter wants Kaine to stand for what he has done, but Kaine initially refuses.  The two fight and end up getting dragged into a mock-trial where Spider-Man is on trial, Kaine is his defense attorney, [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]] is the prosecutor, several Ravencroft inmates are the jury, and a powerful being known as [[Judas Traveller]] is the judge.  During the one-sided trial, Kaine tries to physically fight off all those who are against Spider-Man before Traveller returns them to their previous place of battle.

After an incident involving a superpowered villainess named [[Stunner (comics)|Stunner]], a weakened Kaine still refuses to confess to his crimes.  Spider-Man responds by knocking Kaine out and webbing him up before heading to the courthouse.  Kaine reawakens before they arrive and struggles again with Spider-Man in refusing to confess.  At this point, Kaine admits that he's done everything to protect Peter's life and reveals that he is the first clone of Peter, now partially degenerated.  Spider-Man decides that if Kaine will not reveal the truth, then he will reveal his true identity to the entire courtroom and end everything.  Kaine pleads for Peter not to do this and eventually gives into revealing the real truth about the murders and the "Mark of Kaine".

===Maximum Clonage===
After Peter gives in to the news that he is a clone and Ben is the true Peter Parker, he allies himself with the Jackal. But Kaine refuses to let him throw his life away.  He confronts the Jackal with the full intent of destroying him, when the Jackal manipulates his mind once more by leading Kaine to believe he will be cured of the degeneration process.  Once Jackal reveals he's once more lied, Kaine leaves feeling dejected.  He goes back to Mary Jane for answers, and after a conversation of power and responsibility, Kaine returns to the Jackal's lab in time to assist Ben in a battle against numerous Spider-clones. In the ensuing battle, [[Spidercide (comics)|Spidercide]] impales him with a spike taken from nearby machinery, killing him.

The Jackal, in a momentary pang of fatherly guilt, then places Kaine in a regeneration pod. When the pod is next seen, it is empty.

===The Return of Kaine===
During Reilly's time as Spider-Man, some of the world's strongest fighters are pitted against one another in a fighting competition called the Great Game, a fighting tournament in which wealthy people wager on the fighters for their amusement.  

One of the Game's main sponsors, James Johnsmeyer, finds the pod containing the revived Kaine, and decides to initiate him into the competition, sending the [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] to fight him.  After Kaine's refusal and escape, thanks to temporary partner Shannon, Johnsmeyer still attempts to involve Kaine by allowing other Game competitors to attack him ([[Joystick (comics)|Joystick]] and Polestar).  

Spider-Man interferes in the skirmish and gets sidetracked by Joystick and Polestar while Kaine puts a near-fatal beating on Rhino and escapes with Shannon.  Before they are able to get away, Spider-Man manages to tag Shannon with a tracer and he pursues them once Polestar and Rhino are taken into custody.  He finds them moments before the police, but after an incident that threatened to kill the officers, Kaine and Shannon escape again.  

This time, Kaine's destination is Johnsmeyer's headquarters.  Spider-Man finds them once again after Kaine manages to single-handedly destroy all of Johnsmeyer's rooftop security defenses, but once inside, Johnsmeyer reveals that Shannon—who was still working for Johnsmeyer during the entire ordeal—has been manipulating and deceiving Kaine.  Kaine, not wanting to become a puppet of anyone ever again, tries to kill Shannon but was persuaded by Spider-Man not to do so. Kaine leaves, vowing to take down every sponsor of the Great Game.

===Kaine's redemption===
During a later encounter with Ben Reilly, in which Janine Godbe returns to the man she loved, Kaine finally brings himself to let go of his hatred for his brother, even saving Ben's life after nearly leaving him to die in a burning diner. Encouraged by his brother's example (as well as finally acknowledging Ben as his brother rather than his foe), Kaine hands himself over to the law, as Janine (who was wanted for the murder of her abusive father) does the same. 

At that point, it is revealed that his degeneration is killing him, and Kaine is incarcerated in some type of hospital-prison with other killers. Initially lamenting his situation and accepting his imminent death, Kaine resolves to fight after seeing hallucinations of [[Ben Reilly]], [[Jackal (comics)|Jackal]], Louise, himself, and [[Peter Parker]].<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #1 (2009)</ref>

Several months later, he is shown escaping from jail alongside many other super-powered criminals in an issue of ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]''. Kaine breaks out to try to stop Norman Osborn after finding out that he is still alive, has masterminded the Clone Saga, and killed his brother Ben.  A few issues of Spider-Man briefly mention Kaine working against Osborn's agents in southern Europe. The last mention of Kaine is an offhand line from one of Osborn's men saying that Kaine has been "dealt with", without elaborating on what that meant.{{Issue|date=October 2009}}

In the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]: Battle Damage Report'' one-shot, the final pages mention potential enemies and candidates to the ''[[Avengers: The Initiative|50-States Initiative]].'' Kaine is listed as an unregistered "Enemy Combatant."[[Image:Return of Kaine.jpg|Kaine attacking Spider-Man from ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #608. Art by Marco Checchetto|thumb|right]]

===Dark Reign===
Kaine later appears in New York City, attacking Spider-Man as he tried to track down [[Raptor (comics)#Damon Ryder|Raptor]].<ref>Amazing Spider-Man #608</ref> He reveals that he has sought Raptor out, hoping that he could cure his cellular degeneration, and attacks Spider-Man to keep him from the villain.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #609</ref>

When Raptor attacks [[Harry Osborn]] and Peter's cousins at Aunt May's house, Kaine appears, having been working with Raptor the whole time.  He exposes Peter's identity as Spider-Man and states that Peter is a clone of Reilly and should be killed since he's the closest thing to Ben.  Peter beats Raptor unconscious and escapes.  It is later shown that Raptor lied to Kaine  about being able to cure his degeneration to gain an ally in his quest for revenge.  Furious, Kaine breaks his neck, seemingly killing him.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #610</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
As an imperfect clone of Spider-Man, Kaine has superhuman strength, speed, agility, reflexes and equilibrium all at higher levels than Spider-Man due to his continued mutation.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' (Volume 2) #1</ref>

The true limit of his strength is unknown, but he has proven able beat the [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] unconscious and to hold his own against three Spider-Men at the same time ([[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]], [[Ben Reilly]], and [[Spidercide (comics)|Spidercide]]).

His precognitive spider-sense is more developed than that of Spider-Man; where Parker and Reilly can sense immediate danger, Kaine can actually see short glimpses of the future. 

He uses his clinging ability primarily to burn a distinctive scarring into surfaces (and people), which he calls the "Mark of Kaine". After defeating an enemy, usually resulting in death such as breaking their neck using his superhuman strength, he would burn the "Mark of Kaine" onto their face.  Notable characters to have been defeated in such a fashion include [[Doctor Octopus]] (he was later resurrected). This ability also allows him to melt Spider-Man's webbing.

Kaine also uses his ability to stick to walls in other ways. In one instance, he fashioned a weapon out of a large section of a building by simply sticking to the building and then pulling away with his superhuman strength, bringing a large chunk of it with him. <ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #409</ref>

Due to flaws in his genetic make-up Kaine does not look like an ordinary human, his skin covered with a web-like mass of disfiguring scars.  The costume that Kaine typically wears has been said to slow the degeneration process in his body.

Being a clone of Spider-Man, Kaine is apparently immune to the [[Spider-Man's_powers_and_equipment#Psychic_blindspot|world-wide mind purging]] of Spider-Man's identity and retains this knowledge.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #609</ref>

==Other versions==
===MC2===
In the alternate future known as [[MC2]], Kaine successfully rescues [[Spider-Girl|baby May]] (Peter and Mary Jane's baby) from [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] and returns her to her parents.  This is, in fact, the main point of divergence from the Marvel Universe.

Later, Kaine allies himself with the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin of Crime]], but is betrayed by him during a confrontation with [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]. Daredevil sacrifices his own life to save Kaine.  Kaine takes Daredevil's body to a regeneration chamber, where he is also attempting to assist Reilly Tyne, the son of Ben Reilly, who is degenerating as a result of his imperfectly cloned father's DNA.  He attempts to summon the demon [[Zarathos]] to aid him in saving the two, but in the end, Zarathos turns on him and attempts to claim the boy's body as his human vessel.  The soul of Daredevil fights the demon, and in the end Reilly Tyne is transformed into [[Darkdevil]], with the soul of a hero and the powers of a demon.

Kaine attempts to kill the Kingpin but is stopped by [[Spider-Girl]] and sent to prison.  There, he is recruited by [[Special Agent Arthur Whedon]] as part of a team of captured supervillains given the opportunity to redeem themselves by working for the government (similar to the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]). Those under his command include Big Man (the son of [[Henry Pym]] and the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], former member of the [[Revengers]]), Quickwire (former villain, first appearing in ''Spider-Girl #53''), and formerly [[Raptor (comics)|Raptor]] (now fully pardoned and released from duty), and [[Normie Osborn]] (agreed to use his powers to work for them in place of Raptor, and since de-powered upon the death of the [[Venom (comics)|Venom]]-[[symbiote (comics)|symbiote]], can be presumed to have been released from duty).    

Kaine appears to be genuinely interested in reformation, and has since been supportive of Spider-Girl and acted as an adviser to her.

Spider-Girl is clueless about her genetic relationship with Kaine, although Kaine hinted at it in their first encounter. It's implied that Darkdevil does know the truth, however, once commenting on Kaine's "twisted notions of simple concepts like family". Later on it has been revealed that Darkdevil indeed does know about Kaine's connection to his deceased father, going as far as to refer to Kaine as "Uncle Kaine". He however has not mentioned any of this to his cousin/sister May.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Girl'' #7 </ref>

===Spider-Man: Clone Saga===
Kaine appears during the miniseries exploring the [[Clone Saga]] as it was originally conceived.  He is working for both a shadowy figure and Jackal for unknown reasons and attacks Ben Reilly and Peter Parker when they first meet.  After Jackal targets Mary Jane, Kaine leads them to Jackal's lair, only for all three to be captured.  It is at this point that the two learn that Kaine is another Parker clone.  But when Kaine sees Jackal cloning Gwen Stacy, he breaks all three free before burning the Mark of Kaine into his face and breaking his neck.  When the building explodes, Kaine escapes, having stolen both Jackal's clone stabilizing agent and a second pod containing an unknown clone for his shadowy boss, who partially appears to be [[Norman Osborn]].<ref>''Spider-Man: Clone Saga'' #1-3</ref>

===Ultimate Kaine===
In the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] ''[[Ultimate Marvel]]'' imprint, ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', Kaine is a misguided and disfigured clone of Peter Parker. He kidnaps Mary Jane and attempts to give her super-powers. He is killed after [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Fury's]] [[Spider-Slayer|Spider Slayers]] shoot while he tries to prevent them from taking Mary Jane. Although never stated in the comic his 'name' is revealed in ''Ultimate Secrets''.

Kaine possessed superhuman strength, reflexes, and equilibrium. Like Spider-Man he can stick to most surfaces and had a danger warning "spider-sense".
