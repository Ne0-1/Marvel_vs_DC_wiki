'''Kaine''' is a fictional character, a [[Marvel Comics]] [[supervillain]] and enemy of [[Spider-Man]].  The character first appeared in ''Web of Spider-Man'' #119, and was created by Terry Kavanagh and Steven Butler.

==Fictional character biography==
===The birth of Kaine===
Kaine is the Jackal's first temporary success at cloning Peter Parker, but the cloning process was flawed. As a result he is left deformed and mentally unstable, but also more physically powerful than Spider-Man, as well as possessing a low-grade precognition (An enhanced version of a spider-sense).

Professor Warren discards Kaine because the clone starts showing early signs of the degeneration process, and Kaine experiences a strong feeling of rejection similar to that between a father and son.  Kaine leaves Professor Warren and realizes the partial degeneration also caused a slight amplification of the powers he "inherited" from Peter.  Not only has his strength, speed, and agility been copied from the original Peter's, but he gains a "precognitive sense" that shows him flashes of the future (an amplified version of Peter's spider-sense).  He also possesses a "Mark of Kaine," a corrosive touch that he uses to leave eaten away hand prints on his victims' faces.  Though never explicitly stated within the story, in interviews afterwards{{Fact|date=May 2007}} the creators reveal that the Mark of Kaine was meant to be another analog of one of Spider-Man's powers, namely the ability to cling to walls.

The Jackal goes on to create a new, better clone; the man who would become [[Ben Reilly]]. When the Jackal uses Reilly against Peter, the ensuing battle leaves Reilly and the Jackal for dead. They both manage to survive; the Jackal places himself into suspended animation in a cloning pod to awaken later; and Reilly leaves New York.

Behind the scenes, [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] manages to have the files on Ben and Peter switched, so the Jackal would think Peter is the clone and Ben is the real deal. Consulting the Jackal's files, Kaine also believes the same, so he follows Ben Reilly through his "exile". For a time, he finds love in the arms of police detective Louise Kennedy of Salt Lake City, but when she is discovered to be working for the criminals, coupled with Kaine's increased cellular degeneration pushing him even further towards insanity, Kaine finally loses it. After killing Louise (Although a part of him still loved her), Kaine continues to stalk Ben, making it appear as though Janine Godbe, the woman Ben loves, commits suicide and then framing Ben for murder by committing a number of murders in which Ben is blamed (Kaine and Ben have the same fingerprints), hoping to give who he thinks is the clone (Peter) the life he could never have.

===Trial of Peter Parker===
Peter is eventually imprisoned for Kaine's crimes (for he, too, had the same fingerprints), but after a period of time Ben takes his place in prison.

Peter wants Kaine to stand for what he has done, but Kaine initially refuses.  The two fight and end up getting dragged into a mock-trial where Spider-Man is on trial, Kaine is his defense attorney, [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]] is the prosecutor, several Ravencroft inmates are the jury, and a powerful being known as [[Judas Traveller]] is the judge.  During the one-sided trial, Kaine tries to physically fight off all those who are against Spider-Man before Traveller returns them to their previous place of battle.

After an incident involving a superpowered villainess named [[Stunner (comics)|Stunner]], a weakened Kaine still refuses to confess to his crimes.  Spider-Man responds by knocking Kaine out and webbing him up before heading to the courthouse.  Kaine reawakens before they arrive and struggles again with Spider-Man in refusing to confess.  At this point, Kaine admits that he's done everything to protect Peter's life and reveals that he is the first clone of Peter, now partially degenerated.  Spider-Man decides that if Kaine will not reveal the truth, then he will reveal his true identity to the entire courtroom and end everything.  Kaine pleads for Peter not to do this and eventually gives into revealing the real truth about the murders and the "Mark of Kaine".

===Maximum Clonage===
After Peter gives in to the news that he is a clone and Ben is the true Peter Parker, he allies himself with the Jackal. But Kaine refuses to let him throw his life away.  He confronts the Jackal with the full intent of destroying him, when the Jackal manipulates his mind once more by leading Kaine to believe he will be cured of the degeneration process.  Once Jackal reveals he's once more lied, Kaine leaves feeling dejected.  He goes back to Mary Jane for answers, and after a conversation of power and responsibility, Kaine returns to the Jackal's lab in time to assist Ben in a battle against numerous Spider-clones. In the ensuing battle, [[Spidercide (comics)|Spidercide]] impales him with a masonry spike, killing him.

The Jackal, curiously, then places Kaine in a regeneration pod. When the pod is next seen, it is empty.

===The Return of Kaine===
During Reilly's time as Spider-Man, some of the world's strongest fighters are pitted against one another in a fighting competition called the Great Game, a fighting tournament in which wealthy people wager on the fighters for their amusement.  

One of the Game's main sponsors, James Johnsmeyer, finds the pod containing the revived Kaine, and decides to initiate him into the competition, sending the [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] to fight him.  After Kaine's refusal and escape, thanks to temporary partner Shannon, Johnsmeyer still attempts to involve Kaine by allowing other Game competitors to attack him ([[Joystick (comics)|Joystick]] and Polestar).  

Spider-Man interferes in the skirmish and gets sidetracked by Joystick and Polestar while Kaine puts a near-fatal beating on Rhino and escapes with Shannon.  Before they are able to get away, Spider-Man manages to tag Shannon with a tracer and he pursues them once Polestar and Rhino are taken into custody.  He finds them moments before the police, but after an incident that threatened to kill the officers, Kaine and Shannon escape again.  

This time, Kaine's destination is Johnsmeyer's headquarters.  Spider-Man finds them once again after Kaine manages to single-handedly destroy all of Johnsmeyer's rooftop security defenses, but once inside, Johnsmeyer reveals that Shannon--who was still working for Johnsmeyer during the entire ordeal--has been manipulating and deceiving Kaine.  Kaine, not wanting to become a puppet of anyone ever again, tries to kill Shannon but was persuaded by Spider-Man not to do so. Kaine leaves, vowing to take down every sponsor of the Great Game.

===Kaine's redemption===
During a later encounter with Ben Reilly, in which Janine Godbe returns to the man she loved, Kaine finally brings himself to let go of his hatred for his brother, even saving Ben's life after nearly leaving him to die in a burning diner. Encouraged by his brother's example (as well as finally acknowledging Ben as his brother rather than his foe), Kaine hands himself over to the law, as Janine (who was wanted for the murder of her abusive father) does the same. 

Several months later, however, he is shown escaping from jail alongside many other super-powered criminals in an issue of ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]''. Kaine breaks out to try and stop Norman Osborn after finding out that Osborn is still alive and has masterminded the Clone Saga, as a few issues of Spider-Man briefly mention Kaine working against Osborn's agents in southern Europe. The last mention of Kaine is an offhand line from one of Osborn's men saying that Kaine has been "dealt with", without elaborating on what that meant.

In the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]: Battle Damage Report'' one-shot, the final pages mention potential enemies and candidates to the ''[[Avengers: The Initiative|50-States Initiative]].'' Kaine is listed as an "Enemy Combatant."

==Powers and abilities==
As an imperfect clone of Spider-Man, Kaine has superhuman strength, speed, agility, reflexes and equilibrium all at higher levels than Spider-Man due to his continued mutation.

The true limit of his strength is unknown, but he has proven able to knock [[Rhino]] unconscious and to hold his own against three Spider-Men at the same time ([[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]], [[Ben Reilly]] and [[Spidercide (comics)|Spidercide]]).

His precognitive spider-sense is more developed than that of Spider-Man; where Parker and Reilly can sense immediate danger, Kaine can actually see short glimpses of the future. 

He uses his clinging ability primarily to burn a distinctive scarring into surfaces (and people), which he calls the "Mark of Kaine". After defeating an enemy, usually resulting in death such as breaking their neck using his superhuman strength, he would burn the "Mark of Kaine" onto one side of their face.  Notable characters to have been defeated in such a fashion include [[Doctor Octopus]] (Although Doc Ock was later resurrected).

Kaine also uses his ability to stick to walls in other ways. In one instance, he fashioned a weapon out of a large section of a building by simply sticking to the building and then pulling away with his superhuman strength, bringing a large chunk of it with him (''Amazing Spider-Man'' #409).

Due to flaws in his genetic make-up Kaine does not look like an ordinary human, his skin covered with a web-like mass of disfiguring scars.

The costume that Kaine typically wears has been said to slow the degeneration process in his body.

==Other versions==
===MC2===
In the alternate future known as [[MC2]], Kaine successfully rescues [[Spider-Girl|baby May]] (Peter and Mary Jane's baby) from [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] and returns her to her parents.  This is, in fact, the main point of divergence from the Marvel Universe.

Later, Kaine allies himself with the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin of Crime]], but is betrayed by him during a confrontation with [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]. Daredevil sacrifices his own life to save Kaine.  Kaine takes Daredevil's body to a regeneration chamber, where he is also attempting to assist Reilly Tyne, the son of Ben Reilly, who is degenerating as a result of his imperfectly cloned father's DNA.  He attempts to summon the demon [[Zarathos]] to aid him in saving the two, but in the end, Zarathos turns on him and attempts to claim the boy's body as his human vessel.  The soul of Daredevil fights the demon, and in the end Reilly Tyne is transformed into [[Darkdevil]], with the soul of a hero and the powers of a demon.

Kaine attempts to kill the Kingpin but is stopped by [[Spider-Girl]] and sent to prison.  There, he is recruited by [[Special Agent Arthur Whedon]] as part of a team of captured supervillains given the opportunity to redeem themselves by working for the government (similar to the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]). Those under his command include Big Man (the son of [[Henry Pym]] and the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], former member of the [[Revengers]]), Quickwire (former villain, first appearing in ''Spider-Girl #53''), and formerly [[Raptor (comics)|Raptor]] (now fully pardoned and released from duty), and [[Normie Osborn]] (agreed to use his powers to work for them in place of Raptor, and since de-powered upon the death of the [[Venom (comics)|Venom]]-[[symbiote (comics)|symbiote]], can be presumed to have been released from duty).    

Kaine appears to be genuinely interested in reformation, and has since been supportive of Spider-Girl and acted as an advisor to her.

If either Spider-Girl or Darkdevil is aware of their semi-genetic relationship to Kaine, it has not been revealed.
