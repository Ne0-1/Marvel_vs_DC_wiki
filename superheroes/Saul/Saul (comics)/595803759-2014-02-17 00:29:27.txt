'''Saul''' (real name '''Garbha-hsien''') is a [[fictional character]] in [[Marvel Comics]]. His first appearance was in ''X-Force  #10.'' He is both a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] and one of the [[Externals]].

==Fictional character biography==
Saul encountered [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] during the 12th Century AD, and was one of a group of Externals that called themselves the High Lords and met regularly. Saul was trying to gain entry into a crashed Celestial vessel in the Mongolian mountains, when he was bested by Apocalypse.{{issue|date=December 2012}} Saul's exact age is unknown, but he said to Apocalypse that he was older than he was when they first met, though he may have simply not been aware of En Sabah Nur's true age, as Apocalypse considered himself the first human mutant.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

He was later drained of his life force by fellow External [[Selene (comics)|Selene]], and died.{{issue|date=December 2012}}

==Powers and abilities==
Saul's mutant abilities included levitation, some heightened physicality such as enhanced strength and durability, and virtual immortality.

After enhancing himself using Celestial technology, Saul could channel biological plasma energy into explosive force.  Presumably, Saul was a technological genius.

Saul also studied sorcery.  His mystical abilities included at least mystic senses, spell casting, and teleportation.
