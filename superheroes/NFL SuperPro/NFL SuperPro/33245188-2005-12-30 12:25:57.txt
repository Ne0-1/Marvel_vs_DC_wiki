'''NFL Superpro''' was a short-lived [[comic]] by [[Marvel Comics]], produced in collaboration with the [[NFL]], written by [[Fabian Nicieza]]. It started [[1991]] and ended after 12 issues The hero of this comic is '''Phil Grayfield''', an ex-NFL-[[football]] player who survived a freak accident and wears a near-indestructible [[football]] uniform.

Due to cliched plotting, stock characters, bad plots and cheesy in-fight references to American Football, NFL Superpro has been widely panned as one of the worst comics in recent [[Marvel Comics]] history. It has become somewhat of a [[Ed Wood]]-like [[cult]] object.

==Outline==
{{spoilers}}

Phil Grayfield was once an aspiring footballer. His career ended when he saved a child from falling and suffered a horrific knee injury. He became a [[reporter]] and interviewed an eccentric football superfan, who happened also to be a scientist. This scientist designed a new, almost indestructible football uniform, which has to be molded on an individual basis and costs 5 mio. $, so it is worth "a fortune".

But unfortunately, thieves raid the eccentric's house, overwhelm the two of them, steal the uniform and torch the building. Grayfield, who is tied up, knocks over experimental chemicals, who - in combination with the fire and diverse ultra-rare football souvernirs going up in flames - do not incinerate him, but turn him into a near-invincible superhero.

Grayfield puts on the eccentric's football uniform, brings the villains to justice and dedicates his life to fight crime.

===Plot holes and other inconsistencies===
*Even by comic standard, getting football-related powers after being trapped in a fire with NFL merchandise and some strange chemicals is cheesy.
*Five million dollars for an indestructible, bullet-proof football uniform is hardly a big sum for the NFL stars of today.
*The scientist's villa is full of vintage NFL merchandise, each piece worth a fortune. Why the thieves rather torch the place than loot it, remains illogical at best.
*If the football uniform is molded on an individual basis, then why can Grayfield simply put it on?
*Grayfield does not give the uniform back to the scientist. So, it is fair to call him a thief.
