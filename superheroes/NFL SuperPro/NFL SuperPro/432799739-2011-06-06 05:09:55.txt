'''''NFL Superpro''''' was a short-lived [[comic book]] series published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Produced in collaboration with the [[National Football League|NFL]] and written by [[Fabian Nicieza]], the series started publication in 1991 and ended after 12 issues. The hero of this comic is '''Phil Grayfield''', an ex-NFL-[[American football]] player who survived a freak accident and wears a near-indestructible football uniform.

==Outline==

Nicieza wrote a story centering around '''Phil Grayfield''', once an aspiring [[American football|football]] player. His career ended when he saved a child from falling and suffered a horrific knee injury. He became a sports [[reporter]] and interviewed an eccentric football [[superfan]], who happened also to be a scientist. This scientist designed a new, almost indestructible football uniform, which has to be molded on an "individual basis" and costs five million dollars to construct — so is "worth a fortune".

Suddenly interrupting the interview, thieves raid the eccentric's house, overwhelm the two of them, steal a vanload of NFL merchandise (but strangely not the uniform), and torch the building. Grayfield, who is tied up, knocks over experimental chemicals, which — in combination with the fire and diverse ultra-rare football souvenirs going up in flames — do not incinerate him, but turn him into a near-invincible superhero.

Grayfield puts on the eccentric's football uniform and brings the villains to justice, dedicating his life to fighting crime and dubbing himself "Superpro".

==Reception==
NFL Superpro has been called one of the worst comics in recent [[Marvel Comics]] history, becoming a cult object.  Often cited in this claim are issues with the plot and the characters.  For example, in the first issue a group of thieves incinerate valuable NFL merchandise but it is never explained why they burn it instead of selling it off.  Writer [[Fabian Nicieza]] admitted he wrote the story to gain free NFL tickets. He stated that he still receives flak for his comic [http://www.comicon.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&f=36&t=001565]. Later Marvel comics have poked fun at the series. In an issue of Marvel Team-up the character Stilt Man says "I beat up a guy called Superpro last week. Silliest looking guy..."

In 2005, the [[Chicago Sports Review]] called it "perhaps the worst comic book ever created". [http://www.chicagosportsreview.com/news/newsview.asp?c=142691]
