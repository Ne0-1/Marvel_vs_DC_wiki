'''''NFL SuperPro''''' was a short-lived [[comic book]] series published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Produced in collaboration with the [[National Football League|NFL]] and written by [[Fabian Nicieza]], the series started publication in 1991 and ended after 12 issues. The hero of this comic is '''Phil Grayfield''', an ex-NFL-[[American football]] player who survived a freak accident and wears a near-indestructible football uniform.

==Outline==

Nicieza wrote a story centering around Phil Grayfield, once an aspiring [[American football|football]] player. His career ended when he saved a child from falling and suffered a horrific knee injury. He became a [[sports reporter]] and interviewed an eccentric football [[Fan (person)|superfan]], who happened also to be a scientist. This scientist designed a new, almost indestructible football uniform, which has to be molded on an "individual basis" and costs five million dollars to construct — so is "worth a fortune".

Suddenly interrupting the interview, thieves raid the eccentric's house, overwhelm the two of them, steal a van load of [[Sports memorabilia|NFL merchandise]] (but not the uniform), and torch the building. Grayfield, who is tied up, knocks over experimental chemicals, which — in combination with the fire and diverse ultra-rare football souvenirs going up in flames — do not incinerate him, but turn him into a near-invincible superhero.

Grayfield puts on the eccentric's football uniform and brings the villains to justice, dedicating his life to fighting crime and dubbing himself "SuperPro".

==Publication History==
The first issue starring NFL SuperPro was "''NFL SuperPro Special Edition # 1''", cover-dated March 1991. The series began with issue "''NFL SuperPro # 1''" (cover-date October 1991) and ended with "''NFL SuperPro # 12''" (cover-date September 1992). On two occasions, ''NFL SuperPro'' starred a guest-star, a common practice in comicbooks to boost sales; [[Spider-Man]] (in issue # 1) and [[Captain America]] (in issue # 8).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.atomicavenue.com/atomic/TitleDetail.aspx?TitleID=4958|title= NFL SuperPro|author= |date= |work= |publisher= atomicavenue.com|accessdate= 25 August 2013}}</ref>

The character NFL SuperPro hasn't been seen since the demise of the series. Writer [[Robert Kirkman]] reportedly wanted to use SuperPro in an issue of ''[[Marvel Team-Up#Marvel Team-Up vol. 3|Marvel Team-Up]]'' but couldn't, due to copyright concerns. The closest he came was ''Marvel Team-Up'' # 9, in which the character [[Stilt-Man]] says "I beat up a guy called SuperPro last week. Silliest looking guy...".

==Reception==
NFL SuperPro has been called one of the worst comics in recent [[Marvel Comics]] history, becoming a cult object.  Often cited in this claim are issues with the plot and the characters.  For example, in the first issue a group of thieves incinerate valuable NFL merchandise but it is never explained why they burn it instead of selling it off.  Writer [[Fabian Nicieza]] admitted he wrote the story to gain free NFL tickets. He stated that he still receives flak for his comic.

In 2005, the [[Chicago Sports Review]] called it "perhaps the worst comic book ever created".<ref>[http://www.chicagosportsreview.com/news/newsview.asp?c=142691]</ref>
