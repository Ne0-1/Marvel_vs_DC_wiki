'''''NFL Superpro''''' was a short-lived [[comic book]] series published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Produced in collaboration with the [[NFL]] and written by [[Fabian Nicieza]], the series started publication in 1991 and ended after 12 issues. The hero of this comic is '''Phil Grayfield''', an ex-NFL-[[American football]] player who survived a freak accident and wears a near-indestructible football uniform.

==Outline==

Nicieza wrote a story centering aroung '''Phil Grayfield''', once an aspiring [[American football|football]] player. His career ended when he saved a child from falling and suffered a horrific knee injury. He became a [[reporter]] and interviewed an eccentric football [[superfan]], who happened also to be a scientist. This scientist designed a new, almost indestructible football uniform, which has to be molded on an "individual basis" and costs five million dollars to construct — so is "worth a fortune".

Suddenly interrupting the interview, thieves raid the eccentric's house, overwhelm the two of them, steal a vanload of NFL merchandise (but strangely not the uniform), and torch the building. Grayfield, who is tied up, knocks over experimental chemicals, which — in combination with the fire and diverse ultra-rare football souvenirs going up in flames — do not incinerate him, but turn him into a near-invincible superhero.

Grayfield puts on the eccentric's football uniform, notably without permission, and brings the villains to justice and dedicates his life to fighting crime.

==Reception==
Due to cliched plotting, stock characters, bad plots and cheesy in-fight references to American Football, NFL Superpro has been widely panned as one of the worst comics in recent [[Marvel Comics]] history, becoming an [[Ed Wood]]-type cult object. In the #1 issue alone, Nicieza writes a story riddled with plot holes, such as letting Grayfield put on the super uniform despite establishing "it was molded on an ''individual'' basis", not explaining why the thieves incinerate "priceless" NFL merchandise instead of stealing it, and ignoring that Grayfield was morally obliged to give back the uniform after bringing the looters to justice, making a thief of the supposed superhero. 

In 2005, the [[Chicago Sports Review]] called it "perhaps the worst comic book ever created". [http://www.chicagosportsreview.com/news/newsview.asp?c=142691]

[[Fabian Nicieza]], who as of 2006 is one of the top writers at Marvel Comics, admits he wrote the story basically to gain free NFL tickets. He states that even after 15 years, he still receives flak for his comic [http://www.comicon.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&f=36&t=001565]. 

Furthermore, ''NFL Superpro #6'' had to be pulled from the shelves because it contained content deemed offensive to the Native American Hopi tribe.

Even Marvel themselves have poked fun at the series. In issue 9 of the latest volume of Marvel Team-up, Stilt Man tells Daredevil, "I beat up a guy called Superpro last week. Silliest looking guy..."
