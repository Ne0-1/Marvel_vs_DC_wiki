'''Slab''' is the alias of '''Christopher Anderson''', a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe. His first appearance was in ''X-Factor'' (1st series) #74.

Slab is a [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] villain who was recruited by [[Mister Sinister]] to be part of his [[Nasty Boys]] and was the first team member to attack their nemesis, the government sponsored [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] team. Slab climbed to the top of the [[Washington Monument]] and called [[Strong Guy]] out to fight him, and they battled. When Slab shrunk to normal size to duck a punch, he caused Strong Guy to shatter and destroy the monument. 

Slab was captured along with his teammate [[Hairbag]] and taken to a holding cell by X-Factor. While he waited for his lawyer to negotiate [[bail]], Slab and Hairbag were broken out of prison by the [[Mutant Liberation Front]] (of which Slab's sister [[Thumbelina (comics)|Thumbelina]] was a member) and returned to the Nasty Boys shortly afterwards. Slab has not been seen since the group's subsequent breakup. Slab retained his mutant powers after the [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].

==Powers==
Slab can augment his size and mass to increase in strength and resistance to physical injury.
