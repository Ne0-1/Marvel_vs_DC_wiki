'''Slab''' ('''Christopher Anderson'''), a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe. His first appearance was in ''X-Factor''  #74.

==Fictional character biography==
Slab is a [[Mutant (Marvel comics)|mutant]] villain who is recruited by [[Mister Sinister]] to be part of his [[Nasty Boys]] and was the first team member to attack their nemesis, the government sponsored [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] team. Slab climbs to the top of the [[Washington Monument]] and calls [[Strong Guy]] out to fight him, and they battle. When Slab shrinks to normal size to duck a punch, he causes Strong Guy to shatter and destroy the monument. Slab's battle is aided off-scenes by Senator Stephen Shaffran, who has the mutant power to cause others to suffer bad luck. 

Slab was captured along with his teammate [[Hairbag]] and taken to a holding cell by X-Factor. While he waits for his lawyer to negotiate [[bail]], Slab and Hairbag are broken out of prison by the [[Mutant Liberation Front]] (of which Slab's sister [[Thumbelina (comics)|Thumbelina]] is a member). He is returned to the Nasty Boys shortly afterwards. Slab has not been seen since the group's subsequent breakup. It is unknown if Slab retained his mutant powers after the [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].

==Powers and abilities==
Slab can augment his size and mass to increase in strength and resistance to physical injury.
