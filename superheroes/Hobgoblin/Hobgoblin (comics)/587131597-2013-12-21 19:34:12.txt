The '''Hobgoblin''' is the alias of several [[fictional character]]s that appear in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The first Hobgoblin, '''[[Hobgoblin (Roderick Kingsley)|Roderick Kingsley]]''', first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #238, and was created by [[Roger Stern]] and [[John Romita, Jr.]]<ref>''[[Marvel Age]]'' #111, April 1992, [[Marvel Comics]]</ref> In 2009 the Hobgoblin was ranked by [[IGN]] as the 57th greatest comic book villain.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/57.html |title= Hobgoblin is number 57 |publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate= 2010-08-13}}</ref>

==Publication history==
The Hobgoblin was created by writer [[Roger Stern]] when he was writing ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' in the early 1980s. Like other writers Stern found himself under pressure to have Spider-Man fight the [[Green Goblin]] again, but did not wish to bring [[Norman Osborn]] or [[Bart Hamilton]] back from the dead, have [[Harry Osborn]] become the Green Goblin again, or create yet another Green Goblin. Instead he created a new character as heir to the Goblin's legacy and developed the Hobgoblin.<ref name="Creators">{{cite book |title=Comics Creators on Spider-Man |last=DeFalco |first=Tom |year=2004 |publisher=Titan Books |isbn=1-84023-422-9 }}</ref>

The character's identity was not initially revealed, generating one of the longest running mysteries in the Spider-Man comics. However, Stern left the series after ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #252 and subsequent writers struggled with the question of the identity. Interviews with [[Tom DeFalco]] and [[Peter David]], artist [[Ron Frenz]] and editor [[James Owsley]] are all somewhat at odds with one another over the course of events and what was agreed. However, all sources agree that DeFalco, who had taken over the writing chores on the title, was due to bring the storyline to a revelation when he suddenly departed the title. (DeFalco has since stated that he had intended to reveal [[Richard Fisk]], [[Kingpin (comics)|The Kingpin of Crime]]'s son, as the Hobgoblin, and Roderick Kingsley as the Rose; the ultimate outcome was the exact reverse.) Owsley then wrote the one-shot ''Spider-Man vs Wolverine'' in which [[Ned Leeds]] was killed off (though the actual death was not shown), fully intending that Leeds ''not'' be the Hobgoblin. Shortly afterwards [[Peter David]] (at the time the regular writer on ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'') was commissioned to write ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #289, a double-sized issue in which the Hobgoblin's identity would be revealed. After examining the recent issues David came to the conclusion that the only person who fit the clues was Leeds, and so the Hobgoblin's identity was revealed posthumously. With Spider-Man's then-archenemy now dead, a new Hobgoblin was created from the storyline of [[Jason Macendale]]'s hatred of the Hobgoblin.<ref name="SpideyKicksButt">{{cite web |url=http://www.spideykicksbutt.com/SquanderedLegacy/SquanderedLegacyPart2.html |title=Squandered Legacy: The Rise and Fall of the HobGoblin Part Two: The Goblin in Decline |author= Fettinger, J.R. |accessdate=2009-02-19 |work= Spidey Kicks Butt }}</ref>

Macendale supplanted the original Hobgoblin for a decade (1987-1997). Initially he wielded only the weaponry of his predecessor, but during the 1988-89 ''[[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]]'' [[Crossover (comics)|crossover]] writer [[Gerry Conway]] had him imbued with demonic powers by [[N'astirh]]. In addition to giving him power over hellfire and increasing his strength and speed to far greater than that of the original Hobgoblin, these powers also disfigured Macendale so that his head was even more grotesque than his Hobgoblin mask, and ultimately altered his mind so that he was deluded into thinking that his appearance was normal. Several years later, in the pages of ''Amazing Spider-Man'', Macendale succeeded in purging himself of his demonic powers. Towards the end of Macendale's run as the Hobgoblin he was revamped again, this time with cybernetic implants.

Stern was unhappy with the revelation that his character's civilian identity was Ned Leeds, and in 1997 he wrote a three-issue miniseries, ''Spider-Man: Hobgoblin Lives'', with the [[retcon]] that Roderick Kingsley (whom Stern had introduced in ''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #43) was the original Hobgoblin, and had brainwashed Leeds into serving as a [[fall guy]]. Macendale is killed off in this miniseries, and Kingsley is returned to operating as the Hobgoblin.

==Fictional character biographies==

===Roderick Kingsley===
{{Main|Roderick Kingsley}}

===Arnold Donovan===
Arnold Samuel "Lefty" Donovan was a petty thug working for Roderick Kingsley until he was exposed to the Goblin formula as a test subject. Similar to how Norman Osborn got exposed to the formula, Kingsley has Donovan mix the two vital chemicals that were mixed to create the formula. The formula explodes, disfiguring Donovan's face and granting him its power. Donovan is taken to a hospital. Kingsley uses the Winkler process in order to brainwash Donovan. Donovan eventually escapes the hospital and follows preprogrammed instructions to go to a hidden cache of goblin weapons and dress up as the Hobgoblin.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}

Donovan impersonates the Hobgoblin and attacks the city. Spider-Man eventually confronts and unmasks him. Seeing his face (even though it was scarred), Spider-Man recognizes Lefty. Donovan is able to shake off some of the Kingsley programing and starts talking about his boss. Kinglsey programs the Goblin glider to crash into the side of a building, killing Lefty with the falling rubble.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}

===Ned Leeds===
{{Main|Ned Leeds}}
Edward "Ned" Leeds was a reporter working for the ''Daily Bugle''. Kingsley brainwashes Leeds to act as a stand in on many occasions and fool the underworld into thinking that Leeds is the Hobgoblin. He is later murdered by the [[Foreigner (comics)|Foreigner]] after Kingsley decides that he is no longer needed.{{issue|date=April 2013}}

===Jason Philip Macendale Jr.===
{{Main|Jason Macendale}}
Around the time when the Rose and Hobgoblin's plan got out of hand, Kingsley wanted to escape from his identity. He was looking for a way out and decided to target [[Flash Thompson]], a vocal advocate of Spider-Man who had insulted the Hobgoblin on national television that had incurred Kingsley's wrath. Kingsley attempted to frame Thompson as the Hobgoblin, so that his criminal enemies might target him instead.<ref name="Unmasked">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Tom DeFalco|DeFalco, Tom]] | penciller = [[Ron Frenz|Frenz, Ron]] | inker = Breeding, Brett | story = Unmasked! | title = The Amazing Spider-Man | volume = 1 | issue = 276 |date = May 1986| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> The plan was foiled through intervention of Jason Philip Macendale Jr., who subsequently broke Thompson out of jail, thinking he was doing the Hobgoblin a favor. Macendale was a [[mercenary]] who had been trained by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and various para-military organizations, and was known in his costumed identity as [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]]. When Macendale discovered that Thompson was not the Hobgoblin, Kingsley grew furious, as he had planned to operate "under the radar" while Thompson was in custody; this began a long-running feud between Kingsley and Macendale when the two battled for the first time.<ref name="Clash">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Tom DeFalco|DeFalco, Tom]] | penciller = [[Ron Frenz|Frenz, Ron]] | inker = Breeding, Brett | story = When Warriors Clash--! | title = The Amazing Spider-Man | volume = 1 | issue = 281 |date = October 1986| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> Thompson was ultimately exonerated and released.

When the Kingpin temporarily abdicated his role at the head of organized crime on the eastern seaboard, the resulting [[gang|gang war]] tore [[New York City]] apart. During the conflict the Hobgoblin and the Rose had a falling out, with the latter ordering the former's assassination as he had become too dangerous. The Hobgoblin sold the Rose's identity to the Kingpin in exchange for information that would aid Leeds in a story, thus reinforcing the illusion of the latter's identity. Also, during the conflict both Hobgoblin and Jack O' Lantern were badly injured and forced to separately retreat. Shaken by the battle, Jack O' Lantern felt he needed to seek another way to destroy his enemy.<ref name="Foes">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Tom DeFalco|DeFalco, Tom]] | penciller = [[Ron Frenz|Frenz, Ron]] | inker = [[Bob Layton|Layton, Bob]] | story = With Foes Like These... | title = The Amazing Spider-Man | volume = 1 | issue = 276 |date = May 1986| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref><ref name="Stand">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Tom DeFalco|DeFalco, Tom]] | penciller = [[Ron Frenz|Frenz, Ron]] | inker = [[Josef Rubinstein|Rubinstein, Josef]] | story = ...And Who Shall Stand Against Them...? | title = The Amazing Spider-Man | volume = 1 | issue = 284 |date = January 1987| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref><ref name="Arranger">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Christopher Priest (comic book writer)|Owsley, James]] | cowriters = [[Tom DeFalco]] | penciller = [[Alan Kupperberg|Kupperberg, Alan]] | inker = Fern, Jim | story = The Arranger Must Die! | title = The Amazing Spider-Man | volume = 1 | issue = 285 |date = February 1987| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

The Hobgoblin took one more attempt at killing Harry Osborn, and poisoned both Osborn and Spider-Man.<ref name="TwentyFourHours">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Bob Layton|Layton, Bob]] | penciller = Fern, Jim | inker = [[Vince Colletta|Colletta, Vince]] | story = 24 Hours | title = Peter Parker The Spectacular Spider-Man | issue = 130 |date = September 1987| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

Hoping to give another try at escaping from his identity, Kingsley leaked word to the underworld that Leeds was the Hobgoblin. Taking this information, Macendale paid the supervillain known as the [[Foreigner (comics)|Foreigner]] to take Leeds out. On an overseas assignment with Peter Parker, Leeds was murdered in his hotel room.<ref name="Wolverine">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Christopher Priest (comic book writer)|Owsley, James]] | penciller = [[M.

Although known in parts of the underworld, this information did not become public until many years later when Macendale revealed it at the end of his trial. For many years Leeds was considered to be the original Hobgoblin.

Kingsley's plan had worked: his enemies thought they had killed the Hobgoblin and now he could take his ill-gotten gains and retire to [[Belize]]. This paved the way for Macendale to take up the role,<ref name="Revealed">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Peter David|David, Peter]] | penciller = [[Alan Kupperberg|Kupperberg, Alan]] | copencillers = [[Tom Morgan (artist)|Tom Morgan]] | inker = [[Tom Morgan (artist)|Morgan, Tom]] | story = The Hobgoblin Revealed! | title = The Amazing Spider-Man | volume = 1 | issue = 289 |date = June 1987| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> an unforeseen development that eventually forced Kingsley to come out of retirement and kill Macendale in order to protect his secret identity, as Macendale had enough information to possibly lead the authorities to discover the true identity of the Hobgoblin.<ref>''Spider-Man: Hobgoblin Lives'' #1, January 1997</ref>

===Unknown Hobgoblin===
A fifth Hobgoblin was introduced in the series ''[[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]]''. Very little is known about him including his true identity. He received his equipment from the [[Tinkerer]]. He was sent along with [[Lady Octopus]] to attack [[Captain America]] in his civilian identity by the terrorist-elements wound into the events of the Secret War. Chatter from the Goblin indicated he'd been in contact with other members of Spider-Man's rogues gallery, who'd warned him about Spider-Man's constant and inane joking. This Hobgoblin is jailed along with the various defeated villains after the conclusion of the "War".{{issue|date=April 2013}}

===Deadpool===
{{Main|Deadpool}}
After escaping the hospice, Deadpool was hired by the Wizard to bomb a hangar, dressed as the Hobgoblin. Deadpool mentioned he disliked the costume and after having bombed the wrong hangar, he never wore it again.<ref name="Secrets Beneath the Skin">{{Cite comic | writer = Smith, Andy | penciller = [[Andrew Pepoy|Pepoy, Andrew]] | inker = Holdredge, Jon | story = Sending in the Clowns | title = Deadpool | issue = 35 | volume = 1 |date = December 1999| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

===Daniel Kingsley===
With Roderick Kingsley having relocated to Ecuador, his brother Daniel Kingsley<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #691</ref> returned to New York, posing as his brother with the intention of becoming the new Hobgoblin using his brother's equipment. However, when investigating Roderick Kingsley's old lair at OsCorp to find that Norman Osborn had been working on some new goblin gear, including new body armor, a winged jetpack in place of a glider, and a flaming energy sword. Kingsley also discovers [[Phil Urich]] trying to retrieve some of the gear to show Norah at the ''[[Daily Bugle]]''. Urich uses his "Lunatic Laugh" to stun Kingsley long enough for Urich to decapitate him using his own sword, which allows Urich to claim the mantle of Hobgoblin.<ref name="philurichhobgoblin">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #649</ref>

===Phil Urich===
{{Main|Phil Urich}}
When Daniel Kingsley attempts to assume his brother's role as the Hobgoblin in New York, he encounters '''[[Phil Urich]]''', who once used the Green Goblin identity to operate as a hero. Kingsley is on the verge of murdering him until Urich uses his "Lunatic Laugh", stunning Kingsley. Urich then kills Kingsley in self-defense and takes on the Hobgoblin identity himself, as a supervillain.<ref name="philurichhobgoblin" /> As the new Hobgoblin Phil becomes one of [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]'s agents.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #648</ref>

'''Hobgoblin 2211''' first appears in ''Spider-Man 2099 Meets Spider-Man''. While her costume sports the green-and-purple color scheme of the twentieth-century Green Goblin, she boasted that she was the Hobgoblin of the year 2211. Her identity was not revealed to readers (or to the visiting Spider-Men of previous eras) at the time, but her later reappearance in ''[[Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man]]'' (also written by David) revealed her true identity and origin.

Hobgoblin 2211 is [[Spider-Man 2211]]'s daughter named '''Robin "Hobby"/"Hob" Bourne'''. Her father always seemed to put his superhero career before raising his own daughter. She wanted to save the universes from 'intersecting'; in other words, having other parallel universes merge with the existing one, causing it to override. She was later arrested by her father for something that she would have done in future: unauthorized time travel, chronal displacement, jumping the tracks to other realities. She was held in a virtual reality prison where she lives a benign and trouble-free existence in what appears to be Kansas. Her boyfriend attempts to free her by uploading a virus into the prison, but inadvertently causes her to be driven insane. She attacked her father with a 'retcon bomb' (a variation on the original Goblins' pumpkin bombs) but it hit her boyfriend instead, erasing (or 'retconning') him from existence.

Now suited up as the Hobgoblin, Robin managed to time-travel to the current year, attacking the current Spider-Man in his reality and derailing an [[Uncle Ben]] from another reality into the present one causing a time paradox. Later, in a confrontation with her father, she threw a 'retcon bomb' at him. Spider-Man, believing it to be no more harmful than a regular pumpkin bomb, caught it with his web and threw it back to Robin, unwittingly erasing her from existence.

===JLA/Avengers===
In the last issue of ''[[JLA/Avengers]]'', the Hobgoblin is among the enthralled villains defending [[Krona (comics)|Krona]]'s stronghold, and is defeated by [[Hawkgirl]].{{Issue|date=December 2011}}

===MC2===
The original Hobgoblin made his MC2 debut in [[Spider-Girl]] #97, as a hired assassin to kill many of the Spider-Girl characters, including Normie Osborn, Spider-Girl, and Peter Parker. After a fight against both Spider-Girl and her father, he came close to victory, but at the end his only success lay in killing the [[Venom (comics)|Venom]] [[symbiote (comics)|symbiote]], and also in escaping without a trace.<ref>''Spider-Girl'' #100 (September 2006)</ref> He attempted a complex plot to become the new kingpin of crime, but was undone due to an act of treachery by his partner, the [[Mindworm]]. Killing the Mindworm, and deciding the New York underworld had become too "hot" for him at the moment, he chose to return to the Caribbean, but vowed someday to come back and finish off Spider-Girl.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Girl'' #18 (May 2008)</ref> He is later revealed to be the instigator of a mob war against the [[Black Tarantula]], returning to New York to finish the job.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Girl'' #3 (July 2010)</ref> He defeated [[American Dream (comics)|American Dream]] and the [[New Warriors]]. He then dropped them from a great height, planning to kill Spider-Girl as she tried to save them. However, he himself was then killed by Mayhem, Spider-Girl's half-symbiote clone.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Girl'' #4 (August 2010)</ref>

===Sword-and-sorcery===
In the 2007 Spider-Man/[[Red Sonja]] mini-series, the Hobgoblin was one of several supervillains who was transformed into a [[sword-and-sorcery]] version of themselves due to the spell cast by [[Kulan Gath]]. It was never specified which Hobgoblin it was.

Created by Alchemax scientist [[Lady Octopus|Dr. Serena Patel]], this Hobgoblin is a mercenary with "Psy-powers" which when combined with a tablet fragment allowed him to plunge [[Spider-Man 2099|Spider-Man]] into a hellish hallucination. He was hired by Alchemax and paid off by having hybrid nanofiber bio-organic circuitry wings bonded to his back to kill Spider-Man as he ambushes him using the powers of the fragment. Spider-Man then goes after Hobgoblin which involves the Public Eye attacking Spider-Man during each fight. After the final fight, Hobgoblin's wings lead Spider-Man to the conclusion that Alchemax is his employer.
