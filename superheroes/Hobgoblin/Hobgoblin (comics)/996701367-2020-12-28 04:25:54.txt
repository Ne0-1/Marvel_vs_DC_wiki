The '''Hobgoblin''' is the alias of several [[character (arts)|fictional]] [[supervillain]]s appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], commonly depicted as enemies of [[Spider-Man]].<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |page=157}}</ref> He is inspired by his predecessor, the [[Green Goblin]], and utilizes similar equipment. The Hobgoblin was created by [[Roger Stern]] and [[John Romita Jr.]]<ref>''[[Marvel Age]]'' #111, April 1992, Marvel Comics</ref> and the first use of the Hobgoblin identity by '''[[Roderick Kingsley]]''' happened in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #238 (March 1983) where only his secret hideout was revealed, and not his secret identity. The Hobgoblin mantle was then carried on exclusively by '''[[Jason Macendale]]''' during the late 1980s and most of the 1990s. Another character to assume the Hobgoblin alias was '''[[Phil Urich]]'''.

The character has been substantially adapted from the comics into various forms of media, including [[animated series]] and [[video game]]s. In 2009, the Hobgoblin was ranked by [[IGN]] as the 57th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/57.html |title= Hobgoblin is number 57 |website= [[IGN]] |access-date= 2010-08-13 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100809124321/http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/57.html |archive-date= 2010-08-09 }}</ref>

==Publication history==
[[File:The Amazing Spider-Man 238.jpg|thumb|left|''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #238 (March 1983), the Hobgoblin's first appearance. Cover art by [[John Romita Sr.]]]]
The Hobgoblin was created by writer Roger Stern and artist John Romita Jr. for ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #238 (March 1983).<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=170}}</ref> Like other writers, Stern found himself under pressure to have [[Spider-Man]] fight the [[Green Goblin]] again, but did not wish to bring [[Norman Osborn]] or [[Bart Hamilton]] back from the dead, have [[Harry Osborn]] be the Green Goblin again, or create yet another Green Goblin. Stern instead created a new concept as heir to the [[Goblin (Marvel Comics)|Goblin]] legacy and developed the Hobgoblin.<ref name="Creators">{{cite book |title=Comics Creators on Spider-Man |last=DeFalco |first=Tom |year=2004 |publisher=Titan Books |isbn=1-84023-422-9 }}</ref> Stern recounts that he directed Romita to base the costume on the Green Goblin's but to make it "a little more [[medieval]]-looking", while Romita asserts that he was given no direction beyond using the Green Goblin as a basis. Both agree, however, that the costume was chiefly Romita's design.<ref name="Back35">{{cite journal|last= Greenberg|first= Glenn|author-link= Glenn Greenberg|date= August 2009|title= When Hobby Met Spidey|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 35|pages= 10–23|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>

The Hobgoblin's identity was not initially revealed, generating one of the longest-running mysteries in the ''Spider-Man'' comics. According to Stern, "I plotted that first story with no strong idea of who the Hobgoblin was. As I was scripting those gorgeous pages from JR [John Romita, Jr.], particularly the last third of the book, and developing the Hobgoblin’s speech pattern, I realized who he was. It was [[Roderick Kingsley]], that sunuvabitch corporate leader I had introduced in my first issue of ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man|[The] Spectacular [Spider-Man]]]''."<ref name="Back35"/> A handful of readers deduced that Kingsley was the Hobgoblin almost immediately. In order to throw off the scent and in the same stroke provide a [[retroactive continuity|retroactive explanation]] for his inconsistent characterization of Kingsley in his early appearances, Stern came up with the idea of Kingsley having his brother Daniel Kingsley sometimes impersonate him, sealing the deception by having the Hobgoblin conspicuously appear in the same room as Kingsley in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #249.<ref name="Back35"/>

Stern's original plan was to have the Hobgoblin's mystery identity run exactly one issue longer than that of the Green Goblin's identity, meaning the truth would be revealed in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #264.<ref name="Back35"/> However, Stern left after ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #251, and editor [[Tom DeFalco]] took his place. Wanting to resolve the mystery in a manner that would do justice to Stern's stories, DeFalco asked Stern who the Hobgoblin was, but objected when Stern said it was Kingsley. DeFalco argued that the "twin brother" scheme was cheating the readers since there had been no hint that Roderick even had a brother (aside from a single [[thought bubble]]), much less one who could serve as a body double. Stern disagreed but said that DeFalco should feel free to choose whoever DeFalco wanted for the Hobgoblin's secret identity, reasoning that "I knew that whomever Tom chose, he would make it work."<ref name="Back35"/> Upon reviewing the clues, DeFalco decided that the Hobgoblin was [[Richard Fisk]]. Moreover, he decided that the Hobgoblin's mystery should be prolonged as long as possible, since it was the chief element that made the Hobgoblin interesting.<ref name="Back35"/> Through both Stern and DeFalco's runs, mystery answer was continuously teased on the cover art, with the covers of ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #245, 251, and 276 all showing Spider-Man unmasking the Hobgoblin.<ref name="SpideyKicksButt"/>

[[File:6.20.19JohnRomitaJrByLuigiNovi25.jpg|thumb|Artist [[John Romita Jr.]] signing a copy of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #238, in which the Hobgoblin first appeared, at [[Midtown Comics]] in Manhattan]]
The mystery was further complicated after [[James Owsley]] came on as editor of the ''Spider-Man'' titles. Owsley's relationship with DeFalco and artist [[Ron Frenz]] was strained from the beginning. When Owsley asked who the Hobgoblin was at a creators conference, DeFalco lied and said the man in question was [[Ned Leeds]]. Owsley then wrote the one-shot ''Spider-Man vs Wolverine'' in which Leeds is killed off (though the actual death is not shown), and instructed ''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' writer [[Peter David]] to reveal the Hobgoblin's identity as the [[Foreigner (comics)|Foreigner]]. David objected and argued that the only person who fit the clues was Leeds; having been present at the Spider-Man creator's conference, David also thought that Leeds was who DeFalco intended it to be. Because ''Spider-Man vs. Wolverine'' had already been drawn, however, it was too late to undo Leeds's death.<ref name="Back35"/> Thus, the Hobgoblin's identity was revealed posthumously in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #289 (a double-sized issue). With Spider-Man's archenemy now dead, a new storyline was created from [[Jason Macendale]]'s hatred of the Hobgoblin. Though the Hobgoblin's posthumous unmasking as Leeds was unpopular with fans, David said in a 2009 interview of still being proud of the story, arguing that the Hobgoblin being unmasked in a climactic battle with Spider-Man was the sort of tale readers had already seen countless times before, whereas having an archvillain unmasked in a flashback after having been brutally killed by nameless assassins was unprecedented and shocking.<ref name="Back35"/> From 1987 to 1997, Macendale initially wielded only the Hobgoblin's weaponry but the 1988-1989 ''[[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]]'' [[Crossover (comics)|crossover]] writer [[Gerry Conway]] had Macendale imbued with demonic powers by [[N'astirh]]. In addition to power over hellfire and increased strength and speed to far greater than that of the original Hobgoblin, these powers also disfigure Macendale so that his head is even more grotesque than the Hobgoblin mask, and ultimately alters his mind so that he was deluded into thinking that his appearance is normal. Several years later, Macendale succeeds in purging himself of his demonic powers and was later revamped again with cybernetic implants.<ref name="SpideyKicksButt">{{cite web |url=http://www.spideykicksbutt.com/SquanderedLegacy/SquanderedLegacyPart2.html |title=Squandered Legacy: The Rise and Fall of the HobGoblin Part Two: The Goblin in Decline |author= Fettinger, J.R. |access-date=2009-02-19 |work= Spidey Kicks Butt }}</ref>

Stern was unhappy with the Hobgoblin's civilian identity revelation was Leeds and wrote the three-issue miniseries ''Spider-Man: Hobgoblin Lives'' in 1997, with the [[retroactive continuity|retcon]] that Kingsley was the original Hobgoblin while Leeds was brainwashed into serving as a [[fall guy]], Macendale is killed off, and Kingsley returned. According to Stern, initially he had not known how to resolve the situation of having two Hobgoblins, and it was at the suggestion of the editorial staff that Kingsley kill Macendale and return to operating as the Hobgoblin.<ref name="Back35"/>

==Powers, abilities, and equipment==
As the Hobgoblin, [[Roderick Kingsley]] wears bulletproof mail with an overlapping tunic, cape, and cowl. A computerized system cybernetically causes the finger-blasters to randomly vary their attack vectors when trained on a particular target. He uses a Goblin glider, a one-man miniature turbo-fan-powered vertical thrust, cybernetically-controlled vehicle. It can reach high velocities and is extremely maneuverable. He uses concussion and incendiary [[Jack O'Lantern]]s, wraith-shaped smoke and gas-emitting bombs, bat shaped razor-edged throwing blades, and gloves woven with micro-circuited power conducting filaments which channel pulsed discharges of electricity. He wore a shoulder bag to carry his small, portable weaponry.<ref name="Shadow">{{Cite comic | writer = [[Roger Stern|Stern, Roger]] | penciller = [[John Romita Jr.|Romita, John Jr.]] | inker = [[John Romita Sr.|Romita, John Sr.]] | story = The Shadow of Evils Past! | title = The Amazing Spider-Man | volume = 1 | issue = 238 |date = March 1983| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>

While brainwashed, [[Ned Leeds]] wore the Hobgoblin's uniform and used the glider and equipment which included [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]] bombs, razor bats and electrical shock gloves. However, he had no healing factor or superhuman strength.<ref name="Hobbylives3" />

As the Hobgoblin, [[Phil Urich]] wears an orange Hobgoblin costume with wings on the back that allow him to fly without the use of a Goblin Glider and he took [[Roderick Kingsley]]'s mask as his own. He uses the traditional Pumpkin Bombs all Green Goblins and Hobgoblins before him have used, but he also has a new flaming sword.<ref name="philurichhobgoblin" /> He still retains his "Lunatic Laugh" from when he was the Goblin and he also has superhuman strength, speed, durability, stamina, reflexes and senses, and enhanced intellect. For unknown reasons, he no longer needs his mask to activate this power. With the help of Reverbium, his "Lunatic Laugh" was able to cause a building to collapse.<ref name="ASM651">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #651 (January 2011). Marvel Comics.</ref>

'''Hobgoblin 2211''' first appears in ''Spider-Man 2099 Meets Spider-Man''. While her costume sports the twentieth-century Green Goblins' green-and-purple color scheme, she boasted that she was the Hobgoblin of 2211. Her identity was not revealed to readers (or to the visiting Spider-Men of previous eras) at the time, but her later reappearance in ''[[Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man]]'' (also written by David) revealed her true identity and origin.

Hobgoblin 2211 is '''Robin "Hobby"/"Hob" Bourne''', [[Alternative versions of Spider-Man#Spider-Man 2211|Spider-Man]]'s daughter. Her father always seemed to put his superhero career before raising his own daughter. She wanted to save the universes from 'intersecting'; in other words, having other parallel universes merge with the existing one, causing it to override. She was later arrested by her father for something that she would have done in future: unauthorized time travel, chronal displacement, jumping the tracks to other realities. She was held in a virtual reality prison where she lives a benign and trouble-free existence in what appears to be Kansas. Her boyfriend attempts to free her by uploading a virus into the prison, but inadvertently causes her to be driven insane. She attacked her father with a 'retcon bomb' (a variation on the original Goblins' pumpkin bombs) but it hit her boyfriend instead, erasing (or 'retconning') him from existence.

Now suited up as the Hobgoblin, Robin managed to time-travel to the current year, attacking the current Spider-Man in his reality and derailing an [[Uncle Ben]] from another reality into the present one causing a time paradox. Later, in a confrontation with her father, she threw a 'retcon bomb' at him. Spider-Man, believing it to be no more harmful than a regular pumpkin bomb, caught it with his web and threw it back to Robin, unwittingly erasing her from existence.

===''JLA/Avengers''===
In the last issue of ''[[JLA/Avengers]]'', the Hobgoblin is among the enthralled villains defending [[Krona (comics)|Krona]]'s stronghold, and is defeated by [[Hawkgirl]].<ref>''Avengers/JLA'' #4 (May 2004)</ref>

===Marvel Adventures===
In this continuity, Hobgoblin is an unidentified criminal who found a stash of Green Goblin's weaponry because he had forgotten to leave the entrance locked. Delighted at his new technological power he challenges Green Goblin to a confrontation. Spider-Man defeats them both.<ref>''Marvel Adventures Spider-Man'' #22 (2005)</ref>

===MC2===
The original Hobgoblin made his [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] debut as a hired assassin to kill many of the Spider-Girl characters, including Normie Osborn, [[Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)|Spider-Girl]], and Peter Parker.<ref>''Spider-Girl'' #97 (June 2006)</ref> After a fight against both Spider-Girl and her father, he came close to victory, but at the end his only success lay in killing the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] [[symbiote (comics)|symbiote]], and also in escaping without a trace.<ref>''Spider-Girl'' #100 (September 2006)</ref> He attempted a complex plot to become the new kingpin of crime, but was undone due to an act of treachery by his partner, the [[Mindworm]]. Killing the Mindworm, and deciding the New York underworld had become too "hot" for him at the moment, he chose to return to the Caribbean, but vowed someday to come back and finish off Spider-Girl.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Girl'' #18 (May 2008)</ref> He is later revealed to be the instigator of a mob war against the [[Black Tarantula]], returning to New York to finish the job.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Girl'' #3 (July 2010)</ref> He defeated [[American Dream (comics)|American Dream]] and the [[New Warriors]]. He then dropped them from a great height, planning to kill Spider-Girl as she tried to save them. However, he himself was then killed by Mayhem, Spider-Girl's half-symbiote clone.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Girl'' #4 (August 2010)</ref>

===Ultimate Marvel===
{{Main|Harry Osborn}}
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] equivalent of Hobgoblin is '''[[Harry Osborn|Harold "Harry" Osborn]]''' when his second personality '''Shaw''' takes control. He tries to stop himself during a battle with [[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Spider-Man]] but Shaw takes over and is wounded by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]],<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #74</ref> and later once again used by S.H.I.E.L.D. to attract his father but the two Osborns end up doing battle which leaves the younger Osborn dead.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #115-117</ref>

===Sword-and-sorcery===
In the 2007 Spider-Man/[[Red Sonja]] mini-series, the Hobgoblin was one of several supervillains who was transformed into a [[sword-and-sorcery]] version of themselves due to the spell cast by [[Kulan Gath]]. It was never specified which Hobgoblin it was.

===Spider-Verse===
{{Main|Spider-Verse}}
The Earth-21205 version of Hobgoblin is Peter Parker. Overwhelmed with rage over the death of Gwen Stacy, Spider-Man murdered the Green Goblin and later retired his Spider-Man identity. He soon after became the Hobgoblin and was later targeted by Verna of the Inheritors (alongside the [[Hounds (comics)|Hounds]] [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]] and [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]]) as a Spider-Totem. The [[Spider-Woman (Gwen Stacy)|Spider-Woman of Earth-65]] attempted to recruit him into a growing army of Spiders to protect him from the Inheritors, but he initially turned the offer down. When Spider-Woman revealed herself to be an alternate version of Gwen, he sacrificed himself to save her as atonement for failing to do so in his own dimension.<ref>''Spider-Verse Team-Up'' #2</ref>

The Earth-001 version of Hobgoblin appeared as a member of Verna's Hounds alongside the multiple Green Goblins. Hobgoblin and the other goblin-themed Hounds attacked [[Silk (comics)|Silk]], Spider-Woman of Earth-65, and Black Widow of Earth-1610.<ref name=AS-M#13>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 3 #13</ref> He is killed by [[Superior Spider-Man]], Assassin Spider-Man, and [[Spider-Punk]].<ref name=AS-M#13/>

===''Spider-Geddon''===
In the ''[[Spider-Geddon]]'' event on Earth-11580, a version of Hobgoblin is seen alongside [[Green Goblin]], [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]] and [[Demogoblin]] during the Goblin Night.

After the assassination is foiled by "both" Peter Parker and [[Spider-Man]], the Hobgoblin demands Osborn pay for another chance, but the latter fires him. In response, the Hobgoblin seeks out a partnership with the Kingpin and kidnaps [[Harry Osborn]]. However, the Kingpin refuses to pay immediately, so the mercenary returns to Osborn. Receiving an improved glider and weapons, the Hobgoblin battles Spider-Man across New York before the web-slinger is forced to work with Osborn and the Kingpin to stop the mercenary from taking over Kingpin's criminal empire.

In "Rocket Racer" and "The Spot", his identity is revealed to be Jason Philips, [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Felicia Hardy]]'s fiancé. In "Goblin War", the Hobgoblin obtains the portal-creating Time Dilation Accelerator, confronting Spider-Man and clashing with the Green Goblin as well. Once his identity is revealed, he and Felicia were kidnapped by the Goblin, who stole the machine and arranged for the engaged couple to be killed in an acid pool.
