'''The Mole Man''' (real name '''Harvey Rupert Elder''') is a fictional [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Universe|Marvel Comics universe]]. He first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' (Vol. 1) #1. 

==History==
Little is known of Mole Man’s past, save that he was shunned by the world because of his homeliness and was once a professional nuclear engineer. While wandering the forgotten areas of the world, he discovered [[Monster Island]] in the [[Bermuda Triangle]] and the island’s cavernous entrance to [[Subterranea]]. There he mastered the branch of Subterraneans now called the [[Moloids]]. He used the creatures and technology he found there to strike back at the outer world.

He allowed the superhero team known as the [[Infinity Watch]] to use Monster Island as a base, reasoning they could help protect him from any meddlers, which they did on several occasions.  They lived in a Monster Island castle until their dissolution as a team.

The Mole Man conducted attacks on the surface world until he was opposed by [[The Fantastic Four]] on their first adventure. The Mole Man apparently destroyed Monster Isle in an atomic blast, although it was seen on several other occasions. Some of the Mole Man’s other monsters later introduced included a Megataur and a flying whatsit known only as ‘Skreeal’. In The Monster Hunters adventure, it was established that Monster Island was near Japan. The Monster Hunters adventure occurred chronologically before the Fantastic Four’s first adventure, and it was revealed that the monsters of Monster Island were mutate creatures created by Kro, warlord of the subterranean Deviant race.

Later, he reformed his villainous ways and began to concentrate on building a sanctuary for other people rejected by the surface world. Tragically, his two attempts thus far have led to the death of most of the visitors to his sanctuaries.

The Mole Man is not the most dangerous or evil supervillain the Fantastic Four has faced. With the technology at his disposal, if he really wanted to take over the world, he might succeed. However, that would require having to deal with people and do work, so there is little likelihood of him ever making good on his threats of global domination. However, the Mole Man is responsible for at least a billion dollars of property damage due to his periodically sending giant [[monster]]s to destroy the [[Baxter Building]], the headquarters of the Fantastic Four.

==Powers and abilities==

The Mole Man has no true superhuman abilities. However, he is an extraordinary genius, with knowledge of technology centuries beyond conventional science. He was able to master alien principles of technology totally foreign to his culture and environment. Due to his poor eyesight, his senses have naturally compensated to the degree that they are, like those of [[Daredevil]], heightened to nearly superhuman levels. 

The Mole Man fights with a [[staff (stick)|staff]] and has developed a fighting style that resembles [[bojutsu]]; despite his small size and relative weakness he is a highly proficient hand-to-hand combatant when armed with his staff. He also commands an army of monsters and Subterraneans that are absolutely loyal to him. 

Mole Man’s eyes are extremely sensitive to [[light]]. He is virtually blinded by normal illumination. To counter this, he wears protective glasses that both reduce bright light to levels he can tolerate and increase dim light to levels by which he can see.  His sense of hearing and touch are far more sensitive than that of a normal human.  Mole Man has a series of similar-looking staves (6 ft long, made of wood or aluminum) which contain weapon(s) and additional features. All staves include a galvanic response meter that is tuned to the Mole Man’s body; this prevents anyone else from activating his staves.  Mole Man’s life has made him an expert on subterranean [[geography]], [[spelunking]], understanding [[Deviants (comics)|Deviant]] weapons systems, and monster training.
