The '''Mole Man''' is a [[comic book]] [[supervillain]] that exits in [[Marvel Comics]]' main [[Shared universe|shared]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' (Volume 1) #1, and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

==Fictional character biography==
The Mole Man was originally '''Harvey Rupert Elder''', an American nuclear engineer and explorer. Elder was socially shunned due to a combination of his abrasive personality and his homely, dwarfish appearance. Furthermore, his fellow explorers ridiculed him for his eccentric, crackpot theories regarding a [[Hollow Earth]]. In 1956, while following the group of explorers called the [[Monster Hunters]], he stumbled upon [[Monster Island]], which was at the time a base of the [[Deviant (comics)|Deviant]] [[Kro (comics)|Warlord Kro]] (At the time, Monster Island was located near Japan, although other stories place it in the [[Bermuda Triangle]]; some issues of ''X-Men'' have portrayed them as two distinct separate locations).

When Elder fell into a massive cave leading deep into the underground realm of [[Subterranea (comics)|Subterranea]], he decided his theories had finally been vindicated. However, he suffered permanent damage to his eyes when he gazed directly upon a highly reflective deposit of diamonds. Partially blind and apparently secluded from the surface world forever, Elder dubbed himself the Mole Man and began exploring his new home. He eventually became the ruler of the branch of Subterraneans now known as the [[Moloids]], and the ruler of much of Subterranea and the caverns of Monster Isle. He used the Deviant-derived creatures and technology that he found in Subterranea to strike back at the outer world in numerous attempts to rule or humble the world that had rejected him.

The Mole Man conducted attacks on the surface world until he was opposed by the [[Fantastic Four]] in their first adventure on Monster Isle. The Mole Man apparently destroyed Monster Isle in an atomic blast, although it was seen on several other occasions.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #1</ref> The Mole Man's Deviant-bred monstrous mutates, collectively known as the "Mole Man's Monsters", include the three-headed [[Tricephalous]], the horned [[Megataur]], and the flying bird-insect creature known only as "[[Skreeal]]". The Mole Man also has a group of [[superhuman]] allies called the [[Outcasts (Marvel Comics)|Outcasts]].

The Mole Man later stole buildings from New York City, but was thwarted by the Fantastic Four.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #31</ref> With the [[Red Ghost]], he next battled the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>''Avengers'' #12</ref> Mole Man was among the criminals later assembled by [[Doctor Doom]].<ref>''Fantastic Four Annual'' #3</ref> Mole Man then fought a war against [[Tyrannus (comics)|Tyrannus]].<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #80-81</ref> Mole Man used the original [[X-Men]] as pawns in his war against Tyrannus.<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 1 #34</ref> The Mole Man later trapped the Fantastic Four in a house that blinded them.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #89-90</ref> Mole Man continued to fight a war with Tyrannus.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #127</ref>

He later teamed with [[Kala (comics)|Kala]], the queen of the Subterranean Netherworlders, and fell in love with Kala. He plotted to destroy the surface world, but was betrayed by Kala and Tyrannus.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #127-128</ref> Some time later, Mole Man and Kala were betrothed to be married. Namor, the Atlantean prince, helped out the Moloids when a conquering force was slaughtering many while using them for slave labor.

Much later, Mole Man befriended the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] and then plotted to raise a new continent at the cost of sinking California, but was again thwarted by the Fantastic Four.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #296</ref> He was captured by Lava Men later.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #313</ref> Mole Man then attempted to bring peace to Subterranea, but was attacked by Fantastic Four clones.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #329</ref> He contended with [[Skrull]]s, and tried unsuccessfully to capture a Skrull technotroid egg.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #347-349</ref>

Mole Man later allied with [[Grotesk (comics)|Grotesk]] and Tyrannus against Deviants led by Brutus. He aided the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] in fighting Brutus's Deviants. Together with his allies, he triumphed over Brutus, and welcomed back Kala as his consort.<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #20; ''Hulk Annual'' #17; ''Avengers West Coast Annual'' #6</ref>

Mole Man became involved with the [[West Coast Avengers]] when one of his monsters attacked Los Angeles. His Moloids were caught in the middle of a [[Skrull]] revenge scheme on the Fantastic Four. A replacement Fantastic Four, consisting of [[Spider-Man]], [[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Ghost Rider]], the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] were tricked into entering the Mole Man's territory and battling his forces.

He later battled the West Coast Avengers along with the [[U-Foes]] during the [[Acts of Vengeance]], but their attempts met with failure.

===Reformation===
Later, he surrendered his desire for conquest and revenge and began assembling a sanctuary for others who had been rejected by the surface world. His two attempts to do so led to the deaths of most of the visitors to his sanctuaries. Briefly, the Mole Man allowed [[Adam Warlock]]'s superhero team, the [[Infinity Watch]], to use Monster Island (more specifically, a castle located on its grounds) as a base, on the reasoning that they could help protect him from any meddlers, which they did on several occasions. They proved helpful when the United Nations invaded the island. The Watch, primarily [[Gamora]], drove away the invading force with an absolute minimum of harm. The [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] assisted with the United Nations, then recognized the Mole Man's rulership over the island.

Mole Man tended to keep out of the way when the cosmic plans went on. The Watch occupied the Monster Island castle until their dissolution as a team. Following their departure, the Mole Man apparently returned to his solitary, vengeful existence. Aside from occasional fits of hostility, he seems for the most part content to rule his subterranean kingdom, and for the past few years his surface activities have mostly been limited to reacting to threats (real or imagined) to his people.

===Attacking Again===
In one incident, he was causing property damage purely to help the Moloids, whose water and food had become polluted. He also stole shoes from children. This would be some time after the pollution incident.{{issue}} He appeared in ''[[Mighty Avengers]]'' having led an attack on New York, claiming retaliation for his underground home, which he says is destroyed. He was humiliated by a female-formed [[Ultron]].{{issue}}

Mole Man was also behind a series of [[Chupacabra]] attacks in [[Puerto Rico]]. His motive was to protect the blood-drinking race from extinction.<ref>in the [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''Fantastic Four: Isla de la Muerte''</ref>

In ''[[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]]'', the Runaways are fighting a huge tall sky-scraper sized monster. When [[Victor Mancha|Victor]] suggests [[Nico Minoru|Nico]] shrink it, Nico mentions she already used that spell on Mole Man.<ref>in the "Live Fast" story arc of ''[[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]]'' {{issue}}</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Mole Man has no true superhuman abilities. He is an extraordinary genius, with knowledge of technology centuries beyond conventional science. He was able to master alien principles of technology totally foreign to his culture and environment. Due to his poor eyesight, his senses have naturally compensated to the degree that they are, like those of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], heightened to nearly superhuman levels. 

The Mole Man fights with a [[staff (stick)|staff]] and has developed a fighting style that resembles [[bōjutsu]]; despite his small size and relative weakness he is a highly proficient hand-to-hand combatant when armed with his staff. He also commands an army of monsters and Subterraneans that are absolutely loyal to him. 

The Mole Man is extremely near-sighted due to damage his vision suffered years ago, and his eyes are extremely sensitive to bright [[light]]. He is virtually blinded by normal illumination. To counter this, he wears protective glasses (an early version of a nuclear weapons test Range Officer's flash-goggles) that both reduce bright light to levels his weak eyes can tolerate and increase dim light to levels by which he can see. His sense of hearing, smell, and touch are far more sensitive than that of a normal human; these senses are heightened, but not superhuman. He possesses a "radar sense" that supplements his own weak natural vision.

Mole Man has a series of similar-looking staves (6 feet long, made of wood or aluminum), designed by the [[Mad Thinker]], which contain built-in weapon(s) and additional features. Among such weaponry are an electrical blaster, a flame-thrower, a vibro-charge blaster, and a laser cannon. All of the staffs appear to have a low-energy radar. All staves are booby-trapped with a galvanic response meter that is tuned solely to the Mole Man's skin conductivity; this prevents anyone else from activating his staves.

Mole Man's life has made him an expert on subterranean [[geography]], [[spelunking]], understanding [[Deviants (comics)|Deviant]] weapons systems, and monster training. He has mastered the principles underlying Deviant technology that he discovered in Subterranea and has made radical improvements upon much of it.

==Other versions==
===Heroes Reborn===
The spaceflight which grants the Fantastic Four their powers ends with them crash-landing on Mole Man's monster-inhabited islands. Mole Man ends up capturing Ben and Sue and takes a power source and potential explosive off the group's ship. 

Later, there are hints Mole Man's island is connected to the [[Inhumans]]' city of Attilian.

===House of M===
In the ''[[House of M]]'' universe created by an insane [[Scarlet Witch]], the Mole Man appears in ''Fantastic Four: House of M'' as an enemy of the Fearsome Four, which is composed of [[Doctor Doom]], [[Kristoff Vernard|the Inhuman Torch]], the Invincible Girl and the It. The version of the Mole Man is killed by the Fearsome Four during a battle with them.

===Marvel Zombies===
In ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'', the Mole Man, along with several other undead villains, first appears to attack [[Galactus]]; after Galactus is defeated by several heroes, Mole Man gets into an argument with [[Captain America#Marvel Zombies|Colonel America]] over who gets to eat the injured Galactus, and is subsequently blasted apart by the cosmically powered colonel.

The zombie Mole Man also appears in the prequel to ''Marvel Zombies'', ''Marvel Zombies: Dead Days'', appearing to attack [[Nova (comics)|Nova]] alongside the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]].

===Ultimate Mole Man===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel Universe]], Mole Man was a Baxter Building scientist named '''Dr. Arthur Molekevic'''. Nicknamed Mole Man by the students, he was fired due to his experiments in creating life after being warned off. He claimed the files as his own but was told by the governmental officials firing him, which included Sue and John's father, [[Franklin Storm|Dr. Franklin Storm]] that everything he created was the property of the United States government. He soon disappeared into underground caverns with his Moloids. These caverns contained advanced technology, which Mole Man claimed had been built by an ancient race. Parts of the caverns were also under the Baxter Building itself, which provided Mole Man with links into their security system. His ability to spy on the team fostered the delusion that he was a father figure to them. When the Fantastic Four gain their powers, and were transported across the world, Sue, while unconscious, was kidnapped and transported to his caverns. Mole Man sends one of his created monsters to New York to retrieve the others. The other members of the team manage to defeat it. They follow the hole the monster made and confront Mole Man, eventually rescuing Sue. The Four defeat his forces but the Mole Man escapes. However he returned and kidnapped several Baxter Building students while explaining more details of his life. He was eventually driven off when he left the students behind and went to confront the Fantastic Four, who had arrived to try and rescue them. The students created weaponry from the alien technology and drove off all parties; Mole Man, Fantastic Four and the government, intending to build their own civilization in the ruins of the city. The final panel implies their reactivation of the artificial sun awoke or attracted the monstrosities bio-engineered by the city's original inhabitants, which means the students are likely dead.

Ultimate Mole Man physically resembled the original character. However, he is bulkier, rarely washes and has an unsightly skin condition. The Ultimate Moloids are fungus-based life-forms engineered by Mole Man himself, though initially simplistic and animalistic, they are far more intelligent in their second appearance, even speaking a language which Mole Man understands.

==Mole Man In Popular Culture==
William Lyttle of De Beauvoir, East London, is known as "[[The Mole Man]]". He has "spent 40 years burrowing under his 20-room house, removing 100 cubic meters of earth with a spade and pulleys. A similar feat has been done by Ben Raymond, of Casula, in 2006." On August 1, 2006, a ''Mirror'' news article stated "The Mole Man has been banned from his £1 million home after digging a 60 ft network of tunnels beneath it." <ref>Pettifor, Tom.

In [[Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder]], the sixth episode of the [[The Simpsons (season 11)|eleventh season]] of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', a reference to the supervillain Mole Man was made when Homer stumbles across [[Hans Moleman]] as the leader of a race of Mole People in an underground fortress complete with earthquake machines ("There is no escape from the fortress of the Moles!").{{Fact|date=November 2008}}
