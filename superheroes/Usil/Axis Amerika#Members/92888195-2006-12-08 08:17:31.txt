'''Axis Amerika''' is the name of two different teams of super-villains who have appeared in [[DC Comics]].

==Golden Age Team==
Created in [[1942]], these [[super-villains]] were [[Adolf Hitler]]'s secret weapon against the [[All-Star Squadron]]. This team was created by writer [[Roy Thomas]]. At least some of them were apparently intended as analogues of the [[Golden Age]] heroes removed from continuity as a result of the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]. 

Members-
* [[Ubermensch (comics)|Übermensch]] (Counterpart to [[Superman]])
* [[Grösshorn Eule]] (Horned Owl) (Counterpart of [[Batman]])
* [[Fledermaus (comics)|Fledermaus]] (Bat. Killed in ''Young All-Stars #6'') (Counterpart of [[Robin]])
* Kamikaze (A living missile. A representative of Imperial Japan)

* [[Tsunami (comics)|Tsunami]] (Later joined the [[Young All-Stars]]
* [[Usil]] (A Bowman from fascist Italy) (Counterpart of [[Green Arrow]])
* [[Sumo the Samurai]] (Another representative of Imperial Japan)


==Modern Age Team==
This team was an updated version of the old team and was created by the [[Clock Watchers (comics)| Clockwatchers]] organization. To update the story line Axis was more of a secret fascist cult who ran a children's home called Safe Haven. They accused the [[JLA]] of terrorism, but were ultimately discovered to have planned the whole thing.
