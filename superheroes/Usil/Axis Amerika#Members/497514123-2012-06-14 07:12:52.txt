'''Axis Amerika''' is the name of two different teams of super-villains who have appeared in [[DC Comics]].

==Axis Amerika (World War II team)==
First appearing in ''Young All-Stars'' #1 (June 1987), these [[super-villains]] were [[Adolf Hitler]]'s secret weapon against the [[All-Star Squadron]]. This team was created by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and penciler [[Brian Murray]] as analogues of the [[Golden Age]] heroes removed from continuity as a result of the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

===Team history===
The team's first known mission was to bring down American morale by killing their superheros, then known as 'Mystery Men'. The [[Valkyrie]] Gudra actually steals the soul of one of them, the explosive hero known as [[TNT (comics)|TNT]] It was soon after this, that Tsunami defects. She was then replaced with Kamikaze. During an intense battle, the Fledermaus is slain by [[Fury (comics)|Fury]], while she is affected by the god [[Tisiphone]]. The Axis suffer a major defeat but return. The All-Stars are aided in this second fight by a similar group of heroes known as ''The Allies''. This team consists of Fireball, Kuei, Phantasmo and the Squire.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

The post-war activities of the Axis were unknown until Übermensch and Sea Wolf joined [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]]. Sea Wolf became an enemy of Aquaman.{{Issue|date=March 2009}}

==Axis America (Modern Age)==
This team was an updated version of the old team and was created by Manson and his [[Clock Watchers (comics)|Clockwatchers]] organization; they have no relation to the original Axis Amerika. Axis America was a secret fascist cult who ran a children's home called Safe Haven. The JLA arrived to mediate between governmental forces and what they believed to be the innocent men and women inside the camp. Manson manipulated [[Faith (comics)|Faith]], his former servant, causing her powers to go out of control. It seemed, to the public at large, that the JLA had killed thousands of innocent people.<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation  | last = Beatty  | first = Scott | author-link = Scott Beatty | contribution = Axis America | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 32  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = London  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5  | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>

Superman is imprisoned for the destruction of Safe Haven. Faith goes to Manson, promising to work for him if the JLA's name is cleared. The new Axis America consists of Übermensch (Shepherd), Hel (Vela), Zaladin, Fleshburn and Great White.

Axis America accuses the [[Justice League of America]] of terrorism, but were ultimately discovered to have planned the whole thing.{{Issue|date=March 2009}}

Übermensch was later seen as part of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Society]]'s attack on the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]].{{Issue|date=August 2010}}
