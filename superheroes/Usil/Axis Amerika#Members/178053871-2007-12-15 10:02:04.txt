First appearing in ''Young All-Stars'' #1 (June 1987), these [[super-villains]] were [[Adolf Hitler]]'s secret weapon against the [[All-Star Squadron]].  This team was created by writer [[Roy Thomas]].  At least some of them were apparently intended as analogues of the [[Golden Age]] heroes removed from continuity as a result of the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]. 

=== Team history ===

The team's first known mission was to bring down American morale by killing their superheros, then known as 'Mystery Men'.  Gudra actually steals the soul of one of them, the explosive hero known as T.N.T.  It was soon after this, that Tsnumai defects.  She is replaced with Kamikaze.  During an intense battle, the Fledermaus is slain by Fury, while she is affected by the god Tisiphone.  The Axis suffer a major defeat but return.  The All-Stars are aided in this second fight by a similar group of heroes known as ''The Allies''.  This team consists of Fireball, Kuei, Phantasmo, and the Squire.

The post-war activities of the Axis are unknown.

This team was an updated version of the old team and was created by Manson and his [[Clock Watchers (comics)| Clockwatchers]] organization; they have no relation to the original Axis Amerika.  In ''JLA'' #81 (July 2003)  the Axis was introduced as a secret fascist cult who ran a children's home called Safe Haven.  The JLA arrive to mediate between governmental forces and what they believe to be the innocent men and women inside the camp. Manson manipulates [[Faith (comics)|Faith]], his former servant, causing her powers to go out of control. It seems, to the public at large, that the JLA has killed thousands of innocent people.

Superman is imprisoned for the destruction of Safe Haven. Faith goes to Manson, promising to work for him if the JLA's name is cleared. The new Axis America is prepared; Übermensch II (Shepherd), Hel (Vela), Zaladin, Fleshburn and Great White.

Axis America accuses the [[Justice League of America]] of terrorism, but were ultimately discovered to have planned the whole thing. 

Ubermensch was later seen as part of the [[Society]]'s attack on the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]].
