==Fictional character biography==
{{Plot|section|date=November 2010}}
Harry Osborn is the son of industrialist [[Norman Osborn]] and Emily Osborn. The circumstances of Harry's birth weakened Emily and she died after several years of illness. Heartbroken, Norman becomes a cold and unloving father; he either contemptuously dismisses Harry, or lashes out at him in fury. As a result, Harry spends much of his life trying desperately to earn his father's approval.

Upon graduating from high school, he enrolls in [[Empire State University]]. Among the wealthiest students in the school, Harry soon becomes one of the most popular as well, despite his aloof manner. He has a clique of rich, popular students around him; one of these is the lovely [[Gwen Stacy]]. Gwen is intrigued by a new student: bookish, studious and painfully-shy Peter Parker. Harry takes a dislike to Parker; he resents the attention Gwen gives to Peter, and he assumes that Peter's standoffishness is snobbery. After confronting Parker, Harry realizes that Peter is merely shy, and is also worried about his ailing aunt [[Aunt May|May Parker]]. Despite this rocky start, Harry and Peter became friends, eventually sharing an apartment.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Harry does not realize that Peter Parker is the [[superhero]] [[Spider-Man]]. Harry's father became the [[Green Goblin]] in an accident while attempting to create a super-serum. Spider-Man and Green Goblin had already battled on at least four occasions when Peter and Harry become friends, although unlike his other opponents Peter had failed to capture or unmask him. In a later battle, Green Goblin discovers Spider-Man's identity and captures him, revealing his own identity in the process. Horrified that his greatest enemy is also his best friend's father, Peter's loyalties are torn. When Green Goblin falls onto an electric transformer during the resulting fight, the shock removes all memory of being the Goblin from Norman's mind. Spider-Man removes Green Goblin's costume and equipment, hoping it will be the end of the Goblin menace, that Mr. Osborn will return to normal, and that no one else, especially Harry, will ever need to know the truth.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

However, Norman's Green Goblin persona resurfaces from time to time; he then battles with Spider-Man, only to become Norman again when the fight is over. These are difficult times for Harry, as his father's periodic episodes are unexplainable. He had experimented with drugs in his teens, but he escalates his usage, as well as trying ever-harder substances. This affects his mental stability and his relationships with his friends. Spider-Man uses this to his advantage during one battle with Green Goblin; he is able to stop the fight by showing Norman his son's emaciated condition, brought on by an accidental [[cocaine]] overdose. The sight shocks Norman so much that it brings him back to sanity for what is to be the last time.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

It wasn't long after, though, that stress causes Norman to become the Goblin again. Harry's life has fallen apart. His relationship with Peter's friend [[Mary Jane Watson]] has come to an end when she dumps him, fed up with his self-destructive lifestyle. A disconsolate Harry turns to drugs and suffers an [[amphetamine]] overdose. He survives, but this tragedy, compounded by imminent [[bankruptcy]], drives the Green Goblin over the edge. He [[kidnapping|kidnaps]] Gwen as bait for Spider-Man, and then throws her off the [[George Washington Bridge]] (or [[Brooklyn Bridge]]). When Peter stops her fall with his webbing, she dies because her neck snaps. A vicious battle between Spider-Man and Green Goblin ensues, with Peter barely able to control himself from killing the villain. Green Goblin then directs his [[goblin glider]] to impale Spider-Man, but the wall-crawler jumps out of the way and Green Goblin is impaled through the chest and seemingly dies. Peter is wracked with guilt and sorrow, but takes comfort in the fact that Green Goblin is finally gone.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

===Second Green Goblin===
[[File:Amazingspider136.jpg|200px|thumb|Harry Osborn as the new Green Goblin, battling Spider-Man on the cover of ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #136 by [[John Romita, Sr.]]]]
However, Harry secretly witnesses the battle. Wanting to protect his father's identity, he strips Norman's body of the Green Goblin costume and hides it. Blaming Spider-Man for his father's "murder", Harry swears vengeance. Having inherited his father's company, Harry manages to get the business back in shape as he plans his revenge. One day, to his shock, he finds a Spider-Man costume in Peter's apartment and realizes that his best friend is the man he blames for his father's death. Using his father's old equipment, Harry confronts Peter as the new "[[Green Goblin]]".<ref>''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #136</ref>

Not wanting to hurt Harry, Peter avoids fighting his old friend. Eventually, Harry is knocked unconscious and taken into police custody. There, he raves that he is the true Green Goblin and Peter Parker is Spider-Man, but is dismissed as a lunatic. He is put in the care of criminal psychologist Dr. Bart Hamilton extracting the Green Goblin secrets from Harry through [[hypnosis]], and buries the knowledge deep with Harry's mind. However, this is not altruistic on Hamilton's part - he then raids one of Harry's hideouts and became the third [[Green Goblin#Bart Hamilton|Green Goblin]] in the hopes to become the underworld's new boss. However, his power is no match for his enthusiasm - he never uses the strength-enhancing formulas on himself, seemingly believing that just ''being'' Green Goblin will enable him to defeat Spider-Man. Despite an elaborate plot to kill [[Silvermane]], the power-mad psychologist is killed by a bomb he plants for Spider-Man. Although he suffers a brief setback during the confrontation with Hamilton, Harry is released and considered cured. He sustains a concussion that makes him forget his knowledge of Spider-Man's identity and he and Peter rekindle their friendship.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

For a while, Harry's life seems back on track; his company begins turning [[Profit (accounting)|profits]] once more, and he develops a romance with [[Liz Allan]], whom he meets at the wedding of [[Betty Brant]] and [[Ned Leeds]]. Not long after the two are married, and eventually they have a son, [[Normie Osborn|Normie]], in memory of the boy's grandfather. Harry also gives his blessing to the marriage of Peter and Mary Jane. However, Harry starts regaining his memories when he is blackmailed by the original [[Roderick Kingsley|Hobgoblin]] with a package which contains evidence that his father was the original Green Goblin. When Hobgoblin learns he had raided all of Norman's hideouts, he leaves Harry alone, knowing he had nothing more to offer him. Later, Harry is forced to act as Green Goblin a few times, once to defeat the second [[Jason Macendale|Hobgoblin]]. This Hobgoblin is seeking the Goblin formula that gave the Green Goblin superhuman strength; Harry is able to defeat him by doubling back during an aerial chase and emptying his entire supply of pumpkin bombs onto Hobgoblin. Harry even wonders if he could use the Green Goblin persona for a career as a superhero but Peter convinces him that Green Goblin had too much baggage for such a role. Harry buries the Green Goblin menace within his mind once more and focuses on his business and family.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

===Death===
[[File:Harryosborndeath.jpg|thumb|right|175px|The death of Harry Osborn.]]
This tranquility is shattered when the aftereffects of the "[[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]]" crisis sunder the barrier between Harry's conscious and [[subconscious]] minds. Once again, he remembers being Green Goblin - and his hatred of Spider-Man. Harry has now convinced himself that Peter resents the Osborns' "stable family life" due to never having been wanted by his own parents or guardians, when in fact it was the complete opposite. His sanity shattered, he declares that their next confrontation will be their final one, and only one of them will be alive at the end. To ensure that he is the victor, Harry researches his father's chemical notes, hoping to recreate the original Goblin's superhuman strength. Harry makes his own modifications to the formula,<ref>''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #188</ref> and upon ingesting it, it proves better than he had dreamed. The Green Goblin II formula has made him stronger than both Spider-Man and his father. Now a physical match for Spider-Man, Harry plans his final revenge.<ref>''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #189</ref>

Harry starts stalking Peter on his Goblin Glider, claiming that there is no law against just soaring around town in a colorful costume, and taunting Peter that someday he will destroy him, but he relishes keeping Peter in suspense in the meantime. After weeks of this, Peter finally loses his nerve and strikes at Harry only to be sent flying when Harry hits back, demonstrating his new strength. He then rockets away, taunting Spider-Man's inability to stop him.<ref>''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #199</ref>

Not long after, Harry holds a prestigious dinner at his townhouse, inviting many of his father's old business associates. However, it is actually a trap and Harry has planted explosives throughout the townhouse which he plans to detonate, thus destroying everybody who has slighted the Osborns.<ref>''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #199-200</ref>

Spider-Man drops in to investigate, only to be confronted by Harry as Green Goblin. The two former friends engage in a dangerous battle, which ends when Harry injects Peter with a drug that leaves him immobile but still alive. However, even as he celebrates over his victory he realizes that Mary Jane and his son Normie are also in the townhouse and that the explosives will detonate in thirty seconds. Peter convinces Harry to use his damaged glider to get the two to safety. After rescuing Normie and Mary Jane, Harry returns to his senses and realizes that he has left Peter to die. Harry rescues Peter from the explosion just in time. However, as his friends thank him, he suddenly collapses. The Goblin Formula is damaged by the explosion, and while it increased his strength, it is also lethally poisoning him. Paramedics are called, but Harry dies on the way to the hospital. With his final words, he apologizes to Peter, and confirms that despite everything, they are still, and always would be, best friends.<ref>''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #200</ref>

===Post-mortem===
Some time before his death, Harry created a computer system with copies of his and Norman's minds programmed into it; after Harry's death, the computer system activates and abducts [[Normie Osborn]] with the intent of subjecting him to the Goblin Serum (the same one that that caused Harry's death) and making him the newest Green Goblin. This computer facsimile of Harry and its robotic drones (which resemble female versions of Green Goblin) were all destroyed by Spider-Man and the [[Molten Man]] who manage to save Normie from it.<ref>''Spider-Man: Legacy Of Evil''</ref>

However, Harry had one last trick up his sleeve. Some time before his final confrontation with Spider-Man, Harry had employed the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] to construct [[Life Model Decoy]]s of Peter's parents to play with his emotions. The plot ends with both constructs revealed as fakes when both "die", shattering Peter's mind. After nearly killing the Chameleon, Peter found a tape Harry had left before he died revealing his role in the plot and mocking Peter, demonstrating that Harry was as manipulative and cruel as his father when gripped by insanity. Peter goes temporarily insane from the shock, even briefly rejecting his identity until the return of his clone [[Ben Reilly]] snaps him back to reality.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

===Return from the grave===
It is subsequently revealed that Harry's supposed death is faked by [[Mysterio]] and his father Norman, who spirits his son away to Europe where he is held prisoner in several "rehab" clinics. Norman believes that his son had relapsed into drug addiction, and this in turn led to his brief return to wearing the Green Goblin costume.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #581</ref>

At some point, Harry is released from rehab and reunites with his friends. However, because of the machinations of his father and the mindwipe of the world's knowledge of Peter's secret identity by [[Doctor Strange|Dr. Strange]], [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] and [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]],{{clarify|date=September 2011}}<!--- The previous paragraph says Mephisto did the mindwipe - which is it? ---> Harry no longer remembers that Peter Parker is Spider-Man. His marriage to Liz Allan also disintegrates and the two divorce. Harry engages in a string of relationships, several of which result in Harry marrying and divorcing in rapid fashion. He is in a relationship with [[Menace (Marvel Comics)|Lily Hollister]]. Harry tries to help Lily's father in the latter's bid for Mayor of New York by funding her father's campaign with his dwindling finances.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Harry is also one of the leading suspects for the secret identity of the '''New Goblin'''. In the "New Ways to Die" story arc, Menace battles Norman Osborn and is infuriated when Norman states that all he cares about is killing Spider-Man. Norman dons the Green Goblin costume and mentions that Harry has been in the Green Goblin's Lair. Norman calls Harry, who realizes from Norman's distorted voice that Norman is wearing the Goblin suit. This horrifies and disgusts Harry who vows to stop his father. Harry angrily confronts his father who wants Harry to follow his legacy and become a greater man. The confused Harry is saved by Spider-Man. Spider-Man, who wants to beat Norman senseless, stops when he sees an area for Human Testing. Harry is claimed to be the one responsible for the atrocious acts although he attempts to plead innocence. Harry later states that he wants to talk to Peter, who moments earlier was kissed by Lily, and is seen leaving with a mysterious canister labelled "Prometheus X-90".{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Prometheus X-90, it is revealed later, was developed as a successful cure for Mark Raxton's condition as [[Molten Man]]. The only human test subject was Charlie Weiderman, the short-lived second Molten Man, and the only person on whom the serum could be tested. After the cure is administered, Liz finally forgives Harry and gives him back the wedding ring, which she originally claimed she lost.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #582</ref>

Following the events of ''[[Secret Invasion]]'', Norman is placed in charge of [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]], the successor organization to [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], and forms his [[Dark Avengers]].{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Renting out all of [[Liberty Island]], Harry takes Lily there and, at the top of the [[Statue of Liberty]], he gets down on one knee and proposes to her.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #583</ref> Lily rejects his proposal because she is not sure where their relationship will lead, which surprises Harry. He later goes to her place to check up on her, and as he enters the room he is surprised to discover Lily wearing the [[Menace (Marvel Comics)|Menace]] costume.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

She found a hidden door in his closet and one of his old journals. She begins giving him a hard time about whining so much about his father. Harry thinks her behavior is because she's sick. She continues to tell him she uncovered one of Norman's secret rooms described in the journal. This explains why she kissed Peter after the Thunderbolts attacked; he almost found the secret trigger to open the room. When she first entered the room she found the Goblin's equipment and some experiments. Knocking over some chemicals, she absorbed them and is now able to transform at will. She explains that she discovered Menace's attacks against her father gives him more public support. She also tells him that she accepts his marriage proposal. After their talk, Harry enters one of his father's weapons caches, takes a glider (filled with bombs and winged bombs), a pair of Goblin gloves, a sword, and a dart gun containing an unknown chemical.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #586</ref> In the midst of a battle between Menace and Spider-Man, Harry confronts and shoots her with that chemical, which is a type of antidote that reverts her back to her human form. He saves Spider-Man from the crowd and leaves.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #588</ref> Lily is incarcerated but later escapes, leaving Harry her ring and a note.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

===''Dark Reign''===
Harry Osborn is approached by Norman Osborn with the offer of a job within his organization. Harry initially declines, but after a visit from Lily revealing that she is pregnant, he accepts.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #595</ref> Norman welcomes him into Avengers Tower and wants to make Harry into the '''[[Iron Patriot|American Son]]'''. Harry is shown to have an ulterior motive, however, based on his need to protect Lily and his child. Disabling the camera in his room, Harry sneaks off.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #596</ref> He finds a cure for Lilly's Goblin Serum that will be safe for her and the baby but she pushes him away. Lily reveals that it is all a ruse to coerce Harry into become American Son, whom Norman would eventually have die in a tragedy to increase sympathy for Norman and his Dark Avengers. She also reveals that the baby is not Harry's but in fact Norman's. In retalliation for this news, Harry dons the American Son armor and fights against his father using the [[Iron Patriot]] armor.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #598</ref>

During the battle, Norman declares that Harry is no longer his son and that he has bred a better child to replace the failure of Harry. After further taunts from Norman, Harry lashes out and defeats his father, declaring "I was never your son!". When Harry has the option of killing Norman, Spider-Man tells him to decapitate Norman, since Norman's healing factor may repair a blow to the head. Spider-Man states that killing Norman will cause Harry to "become the son Norman always wanted.". Harry backs down, and walks away from Norman forever.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Harry is next seen in a psychiatrist's office, claiming to be getting over the effects of a medical treatment he received. The doctor offers to prescribe him [[oxycodone]] but it is not revealed if Harry takes the prescription.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #599</ref>

After the events of American Son, Norman cuts Harry off financially and he is forced out of his penthouse apartment. He moves into Peter's old room at Aunt May's.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #604</ref> He also begins secretly dating Peter's cousin, Amy Reilly.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #605</ref> After Aunt May returns and is corrupted by [[Mister Negative]], she kicks Harry out of the house, forcing him to move in with Mary Jane.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #618-619</ref>

===Heroic Age===
After the fall of Norman Osborn, the American Son armor (which can only be used by one of the Osborn bloodline) is stolen by a mysterious figure and the police begin questioning Harry. Later, Harry is visited by [[Gabriel Stacy and Sarah Stacy|Gabriel Stacy]] (Norman's other son) shooting Harry in the chest, claiming that Norman gave Harry a better life.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Presents: American Son'' #1</ref> American Son arrives, saves Harry from Gabriel and take him to a hospital. After Harry recovers from his wounds he is escorted home by police. Fearing the damage that could be done with the American Son armor and perplexed by his encounter with Gabriel, Harry decides to figure things out on his own. After enlisting the help of a talented reporter named Norah from Frontline, Harry decides to visit Norman as only he would know about Gabriel. Harry and Norah eventually visit the [[The Raft (comics)|Raft]] where they find Norman in the cell consumed by madness. Harry demands to know about Gabriel and American Son but Norman is unresponsive. Frustrated, Harry and Norah begin to leave, but before they exit his cell Norman briefly returns to his senses and tells Harry that Gabriel is indeed Norman's son.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Presents: American Son'' #2</ref>

Trying to make sense of everything, Harry visits Aunt May's work where he plans to volunteer. On his way he realizes that he is being followed by the FBI. It is then revealed through FBI security footage that Gabriel is the one who stole the American Son armor and has been using it all along. Meanwhile Gabriel confronts the American Son armor and is revealed to have developed a split personality similar to Norman's after his exposure to the Goblin Serum. This split personality explains to Gabriel that it represents all that is good in his soul and will use the American Son armor to undo each of Gabriel's crimes. After an intense psychological battle, Gabriel appears to gain the upper hand and proceeds with his plan.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Still attempting to understand Gabriel's plans, Harry determines that in order for Gabriel to truly hurt him he will attempt to abduct an innocent person and lay a trap. Harry then rushes to find Norah. Meanwhile, the police arrive at Gabriel's hideout but are unable to rescue Norah because of the American Son's interference. Harry manages to sneak in through one of his father's secret tunnels and confronts his half-brother.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Presents: American Son'' #3</ref> As the police prepare to make another attempt to save Norah, Harry frees her and gets the young reporter to safety. With Norah out of harms way Gabriel and Harry engage in an epic battle; during the fight Harry attempts to convince Gabriel that Norman is evil and that attempting to follow in his footsteps is madness. Gabriel refuses to listen and continues his attempts to kill Harry. Saddened by his brother's choice Harry hacks the American Son armor and knocks Gabriel unconscious. The battle causes the warehouse to go up in flames, trapping Gabriel and Harry inside, but Spider-Man arrives and saves them. Afterward, Norah visits Harry in his coffee shop, and notices a bottle of oxycodone in Harry's things. Troubled by what she finds Norah concludes that Harry has a drug problem and resolves to help him through it.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Presents: American Son'' #4</ref>

After many near encounters, Carlie and Peter meet at the coffee shop. Harry and MJ are there and the four are talking when Lily bursts through the wall, followed by an attacking team of supervillains. MJ asks Harry to help Lily, who's gone into labor, but they are held captive by Doctor Octopus.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #642</ref> Spider-Man manages to save them and rescue Lily's newborn baby from the supervillains. Harry and MJ take Lily to get medicial care, but Carlie was too angry with Lily to accompany them.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #643</ref> When Spider-Man secures the baby from Doctor Octopus he runs an analysis on a sample of the baby's DNA and finds it matches Harry. Spider-Man encourages Harry to raise his son on his own and start a new life.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #646</ref>  Soon thereafter, Harry prepares to leave New York with the baby, whom he has named Stanley. At his going-away party Harry encounters former NYPD officer [[Vin Gonzales]] reveals he has a [[Green Goblin#"Goblin Gangs"|Green Goblin tattoo]]. After Gonzales relays a message from Norman, Harry shocks the man with a taser and beats him.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #647</ref>

Months later, Harry is shown in Seattle, Washington, living with his son. He is shown to have completely changed his appearance, having shaved his head and grown a beard <ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #697</ref>

* Harry Osborn is first mentioned in the 1981 ''[[Spider-Man (1981 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' cartoon as Peter Parker's friend and roommate.

* Harry Osborn appears in ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Gary Imhoff]]. At the start of the series, he is [[Flash Thompson]]'s best friend and he and Peter Parker aren't well-acquainted with each other, something Peter points out when Harry asks him to be his college roommate so as to please his father Norman Osborn, though they eventually become best friends. That eventually was changed when Peter dated [[Mary Jane Watson]] who he was originally engaged until she turned him down. When [[Green Goblin]] and Mary Jane soon became trapped in the [[Negative Zone]], Harry is left depressed over losing the two people that he loves the most. Despite Peter trying to comfort, Harry slowly began to realize that Peter was [[Spider-Man]] and have nightmares that Spider-Man is trying to take away his father and that he's next. When Green Goblin then subconsciously began to appear in his son's [[Mirror image|reflections]], Harry becomes the new "Green Goblin" under a promise to see his father again. After many failures to kill Spider-Man, he learns that his father is the original Green Goblin. This soon leads to Harry slowly becoming insane. After continuing his villainy, he attempts to ruin the wedding of Peter and Mary Jane, though [[Liz Allan]] is able to calm him down, allowing him to leave peacefully and seek help in the Ravencroft mental institution. An alternate reality version of the character is seen in the series finale.

Whereas he and Peter Parker didn't meet until college in the comic books, they're best friends and classmates in high school. While constantly trying to appease his father Norman Osborn, Harry takes the 'Globulin Green' serum to boost his physical abilities but causes the development of a second personality which symbolizes his notion of "the man his father wanted him to be". Following several battles with the Green Goblin, Spider-man comes to believe Harry is the man behind the mask, Spider-Man allows Norman to look after his son.

After Flash Thompson exposed Harry's addiction to league administrators and loses the trophy their team won as a result, Harry destroys the remaining 'Globulin Green' vials he kept hidden. Soon after, Harry attempts to have a relationship with [[Gwen Stacy]] though she expressed some anger when he overheard her talking about breaking up with him to Peter. During the series finale, Harry learned the truth of Norman being the real Green Goblin as he witnesses his fight with Spider-Man up to his father's supposed death. At his father's "funeral" soon after, Harry has Gwen stay in their relationship out of guilt and expresses intent to have revenge against Spider-Man. This storyline, however, was never resolved as copyright issues led to the show's premature cancellation.

* Harry Osborn appears in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', voiced by [[Matt Lanter]].<ref>http://marvel.toonzone.net/news.php?action=fullnews&id=770</ref> He is portrayed as Peter Parker's best friend once again, [[Norman Osborn]]'s disappointment of a son, and a student at Midtown High School. In the pilot "Great Power", Harry is badly injured by [[Klaw (comics)|Klaw]] while trying to protect Peter and Mary Jane Watson from the [[Frightful Four]]. In the episode "Venom", Harry is jealous of Peter's new friends ([[Luke Cage]], [[Nova (Sam Alexander)|Sam Alexander]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Danny Rand]] and [[White Tiger (Ava Ayala)|Ava Ayala]]) so he throws a huge party that is crashed by the [[Venom (comics)|symbiote]]. After the symbiote's defeat, Harry captures a fragment. In the episode "Back in Black", Harry bonds with the symbiote and becomes '''[[Venom (comics)|Venom]]'''. Harry (initially resembling Spider-Man's Black Suit from the comics) attempts to one-up Spider-Man and nearly wins over everyone (even [[J. Jonah Jameson]]) in the city. But the symbiote's personality takes over Harry (now resembling Eddie Brock's Venom look from the comics) and attempts to destroy Spider-Man once again. Spider-Man electrocuted and seemingly disintegrated the symbiote, freeing Harry. However, the symbiote managed to survive and some still on Harry. Harry returned as Venom in the episode "Venomous" in which Harry has no memory of being Venom, and Spider-Man tried to help him without exposing his identity to his teammates. Eventually, Harry is cured and supposedly defeated Venom for good. But in the episode "Rise of the Goblin", some of the Venom symbiote existed within Harry and came into form after his father's [[Ultimate Green Goblin|Green Goblin]] transformation. But he eventually manages to shake off the Venom suit with electricity. Harry later appears in the episode "Carnage". After Green Goblin kidnaps and forcibly transforms Peter into [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]], Harry stops Carnage by convincing the symbiote to rebond with him. Once again Venom, Harry (now resembling Mac Gargan's Venom look from the comics) attacks Green Goblin, intending to kill his father until Peter manages to convince Harry to get rid of the symbiote to which S.H.I.E.L.D. manages to capture to ensure no more harm. In the episode "Second Chance Hero", Harry and his reformed father start to rebuild their relationship. Harry later witnesses the fight Spider-Man and [[Iron Patriot]] (Norman Osborn) has against [[Doctor Octopus]]'s [[Venom (comics)|Spider-Soldiers]].

* Harry Osborn appears in [[Sam Raimi]]'s [[Spider-Man in film#Raimi series|''Spider-Man'' film series]], played by [[James Franco]]: 
** In the ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' movie, Harry is Peter Parker's closest friend. He is mentioned as having flunked out of multiple private schools and wishes to have his wealth and privilege downplayed to classmates. He constantly tries to impress his father Norman Osborn and he eventually grows jealous of Peter's close relationship with him. He dates Mary Jane Watson during the film's first half, though she eventually falls for Peter and he manages to somewhat mend his relationship with his father. After his father's death as Green Goblin, Harry believes that his father was murdered by Spider-Man and wants to seek revenge unaware that Norman accidentally killed himself in an failed attempt to kill Spider-Man.
** In ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'', Harry takes over Oscorp and forms an alliance with Doctor Octopus to get his revenge, providing Doctor Octopus with a rare element he needs to complete his [[fusion reactor]] in exchange for Doctor Octopus capturing Spider-Man. Although the plan fails, he learns that Peter is Spider-Man when he unmasks the hero in preparation to kill him. Afterwards, he begins to hallucinate his father's image in a mirror which demands that Harry avenge him. He refuses and smashes the mirror only to find a hidden room with Green Goblin equipment and serum and realizes that his father was the infamous villain.
** In ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'', the character becomes the "New Goblin". As New Goblin attempts to take revenge, he briefly sustains [[amnesia]] after Peter knocks him unconscious during their first battle. While in this state, Harry reverted to how he was before the time of his father's death. After regaining his memory due to his father's ghost, New Goblin attempts to destroy Peter by sabotaging his relationship with Mary Jane and then claiming that she left Peter for him, only for Peter &mdash; falling increasingly under the [[Symbiote (comics)|black suit]]'s influence &mdash; to attack New Goblin in his penthouse, throwing one of his own pumpkin bombs back at him and scarring the right side of his face. But after learning the truth of his father's death from his butler Bernard, New Goblin helps Spider-Man save Mary Jane from [[Eddie Brock|Venom]] and [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], and ultimately sacrifices himself to save Peter by getting himself impaled with his own glider by Venom. After Venom's death by one of New Goblin's pumpkin bombs and Sandman's peaceful leaving, Harry dies with Peter and Mary Jane at his side, apologizing to them for his troubles.
