'''Harry Osborn''' is a fictional character from the [[Marvel comics]] universe, both friend and foe to [[Spider-Man]]. Harry was the second person to take on the persona of the [[supervillain]] the [[Green Goblin]], after the apparent death of the original Goblin, his father Norman Osborn.

==Biography==

Harry was born in New York to industrialist Norman Osborn and his wife Emily. Unfortunately, the circumstances of Harry's birth weakened Emily, and she died after several years of illness. Heartbroken, Norman became a cold and unloving father, either dismissing Harry or lashing out at him in fury. Harry would spend the rest of his life trying desperately to earn his father's approval.

When Harry graduated high school, he enrolled in [[Empire State University]]. Among the wealthiest students in the school, Harry soon became one of the most popular faces in the school, despite his aloof manner. He soon formed a clique of rich, popular students around him. One of these students was the lovely [[Gwen Stacy]], whom Harry liked, but she kept her distance. Gwen soon became intrigued with a new student, a bookish, studious fellow named Peter Parker. Harry took a dislike to Parker, as he disliked the amount of attention he was getting from Gwen, and he assumed that the reason Peter was so standoffish was because of snobbery. After confronting Parker, however, Harry discovered that Peter was actually distracted due to worry over his ailing aunt. Despite this rocky early start, Harry and Peter became friends, eventually sharing a luxury apartment. 

What Harry didn't realize was that Peter was the [[superhero]] Spider-Man, and that he had twice battled his father, who had become the Green Goblin in an accident while attempting to create a super-serum. When the Goblin discovered Spider-Man's identity and captured him, he revealed his own identity to Peter. Horrified that his greatest enemy was his best friend's father, Peter's loyalties were torn during their battle. However, Osborn then fell onto an electric transformer and the resulting shock removed all memory of being the Green Goblin. Spider-Man removed the Goblin's costume and equipment, hoping it was the end of the Goblin menace.

However, Norman's memories would resurface from time to time and he would periodically battle Spider-Man, only to lose his memories again when the fight was over. These were difficult times for Harry. Having experimented with drugs since his teenage years, Harry gradually began experimenting with harder substances, which affected his mental stability and relationships with his friends. Spider-Man used this to his advantage when, in battle with the Green Goblin, he was able to stop the fight by showing Norman his son's emaciated condition, brought on by an accidental [[cocaine]] overdose. The sight shocked Norman so much that it brought him back to sanity for what was to be the last time.

It wasn't long after, though, that stress caused Norman to become the Green Goblin again. Harry's life had fallen apart. He was heartbroken that Gwen and Peter were now in a serious relationship, and his own relationship with Peter's friend [[Mary Jane Watson]] had come to an end when she dumped him, fed up with his self-destructive lifestyle. A disconsolate Harry attempted [[suicide]] with an [[LSD]] overdose. He survived, but this tragedy, compounded with imminent bankruptsy, drove the Green Goblin over the edge. He kidnapped Gwen as bait for Spider-Man, and then threw her off the [[George Washington Bridge]]. When Peter pulled her back up with his webbing, she was already dead. A vicious battle between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin ensued, only Peter's self-control keeping him from killing the villain. The Goblin then directed his goblin glider to impale Spider-Man, but the wall-crawler jumped out of the way, and the Goblin was impaled through the chest himself, and seemingly killed. Peter was wracked with guilt and sorrow, but took comfort in the fact that the Green Goblin was finally dead.

==The New Green Goblin==

However, Harry had secretly witnessed the battle. Wanting to protect his father's identity, he stripped Norman's body of the Green Goblin costume and hid it. Blaming Spider-Man for the "murder" of his father, Harry swore vengeance. Having inherited his father's company, Harry managed to get the business back in shape as he planned his revenge. One day, to his shock, he found a Spider-Man costume in Peter's apartment, and realized that his best friend was the man he blamed for his father's death. Using his father's old equipment, Harry confronted Peter as the new Green Goblin.

Not wanting to hurt Harry, Peter avoided fighting his old friend. Eventually Harry was knocked unconscious and taken into police custody. There he raved that he was the true Green Goblin and Peter Parker was Spider-Man, but was dismissed as a lunatic. He was put in the care of criminal psychologist Dr. Bart Hamilton, who extracted the secrets of the Green Goblin from Harry through [[hypnosis]], and buried the knowledge deep with Harry's mind. However, this was not altruistic on Hamilton's part - he then raided one of Harry's hideouts and became the third Green Goblin, hoping to become the new boss of the underworld. However, his power was no match for his enthusiasm, and the power-mad psychologist was killed by a bomb he had planted for Spider-Man. Harry was released and considered a cured man, and he and Peter rekindled their friendship.

For a while, Harry's life was a happy one. His company began turning profits once more, and he developed a romance with [[Liz Allen]], whom he had known in university. Not long after, the two were married, and eventually they had a son, whom Harry named Normie in memory of the boy's grandfather. Harry also gave his blessing to the marriage of Peter and Mary Jane. However, Harry was forced to act as the Green Goblin a few times during these years, once to defeat Jason Macendale, the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]]. Harry even wondered if he could use the Goblin persona for a career as a superhero, but Peter convinced him that the Goblin had too much baggage for such a role, and Harry buried the Goblin menace within his mind once more, and focussed on his business and family.

==Death==

This tranquility was shattered when the aftereffects of the [[Inferno (comics)|Inferno crisis]] sundered the barrier between Harry's conscious and subconscious minds. Once again he remembered being the Green Goblin - and his irrational hatred of Spider-Man. His sanity shattered, he declared that their next confrontation would be their final one, and only one of them would be alive at the end. To ensure that he was the victor, Harry researched his father's chemical notes, hoping to recreate the original Goblin's superhuman strength. Harry made his own modifications to the formula, and upon ingesting it, it proved better than he had dreamed. The new Goblin Formula had made him stronger than both Spider-Man and his father. Now a physical match for Spider-Man, Harry planned his final revenge.

Harry took to stalking Peter Parker on his Goblin Glider, taunting him that someday he would destroy him, but he relished keeping Peter in suspense in the meantime. After weeks of this, Peter finally lost his cool and struck at Harry, only to be sent flying when Harry hit back, demonstrating his new strength. He then rocketed away, taunting Spider-Man's inability to stop him.

Not long after, Harry held a prestigious dinner at his townhouse, inviting many of his father's old business associates. However, it was actually a trap, and Harry had planted explosives throughout the townhouse, which he planned to detonate, thus destroying everybody who had slighted the Osborns. Spider-Man, fearing the worst, dropped in to investigate, only to be confronted by Harry as the Green Goblin. The two former friends engaged in an explosive battle, which ended when Harry injected Peter with a drug that left him immobile but still conscious. 

However, even as he gloated over his victory, he realized that Mary Jane and his son Normie were also in the townhouse, and that the explosives would detonate in two minutes. Despite protestations that he wasn't a hero, Peter convinced Harry to use his glider to get the two to safety. Once Normie and Mary Jane were safe, Harry's sanity finally returned, and he realized that he had left Peter to die. Harry rescued Peter from the explosion in the nick of time. However, as his friends thanked him, he suddenly collapsed. The Goblin Formula was imperfect, and while it had increased his strength, it was also lethally poisoning him. Paramedics were called, but Harry died en route to the hospital. With his final words, he apologised to Peter, and confirmed that despite everything, they were still best friends.

Some time later, it was revealed that Norman Osborn had not in fact died when the glider impaled him, and that he had fled to [[Europe]], hoping to give Harry a chance to prove himself. A year after Harry's death Norman returned to America, nearly driving Spider-Man insane with the [[Clone Saga]] and regaining the mantle of the Green Goblin when he finally revealed himself as the mastermind. If anything, Harry's death has made the rivalry between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin even more bitter than before, as both blame the other for culpability.

==Powers and Abilities==

For most of his life, Harry Osborn had no superhuman abilities. When he drank the experimental Goblin Formula, his strength was augmented beyond that of either Spider-Man or the Green Goblin. His durability, agility and intelligence likewise increased, but the extent of these augmentations is unknown.

Harry had all of the Green Goblin's equipment, including the explosive "pumpkin bombs" and the razor-edged boomerang blades. He also rode on a modified version of the Goblin Glider that was even faster and more mobile than the original.

==Ultimate Harry Osborn==
[[Image:Ultsm73.jpg|225px|Cover to ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #73. Art by [[Mark Bagley]].|thumb]]
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, rich, popular Harry Osborn knows Peter Parker in high school. Despite the difference between them, the two bond; Harry improves Peter's social status, and Peter helps Harry with his homework. Harry's father Norman is an industrialist, who creates the Oz Formula, an experimental solution intended to turn ordinary humans into superhumans. When a spider ingested with the Oz Formula bites Peter, he gains superhuman strength and agility and secretly becomes Spider-Man. Under the pretense of fearing for Peter's health, Osborn takes a sample of Peter's blood, and realizes that the Oz Formula has made him stronger. Norman then subjects himself to the Oz Formula, becoming a hideous demonic monster; the Green Goblin.

However, it was later revealed that when Norman became the Goblin, he made skin contact with his son, passing his abilities onto Harry. When Osborn is locked up by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] after a failed coup at the [[White House]], Harry is provoked by Mr. Shaw, his alternate personality, to unleash his own powers. Harry then transforms into a ghoulish, orange beast; the [[Hobgoblin (comics)#Ultimate Hobgoblin|Hobgoblin]]. In this form Harry battles Spider-Man and S.H.I.E.L.D., but is defeated.

==Other Media Adaptations==

Despite his importance in the Spider-Man saga, Harry has made few appearances in most Spider-Man animated series, appearing only in the most recent ones. In the 1994 ''Spider-Man'' series, Harry is voiced by [[Gary Imhoff]]. In this adaptation, Harry becomes the Green Goblin after his father, the original Goblin, becomes trapped in the [[Negative Zone]]. In the 2003 [[MTV]] ''Spider-Man'' series, which ties in with the movies, Harry is voiced by [[Ian Ziering]].

==Live action feature films==

In the 2002 ''[[Spider-Man (movie)|Spider-Man]]'' movie and its sequel, Harry is played by actor [[James Franco]].

In the first film, Harry is one of Peter's high school classmates, who resents the fact that his father seems to understand Peter better than his own son. Early in the movie, Peter becomes Spider-Man and Norman becomes the Green Goblin, but Harry remains unaware that the two are his father and his best friend. At the end of the film, the Green Goblin has died at the end of his own glider (like in the comics), this time after failing to kill Mary Jane. Spider-Man drops Norman's body at his mansion, and Harry sees him. At his father's funeral, a brooding Harry tells Peter that Spider-Man will pay for the death of his father.

In ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'', Harry's vendetta against Spider-Man brings him into an alliance with [[Doctor Octopus]]. Harry agrees to supply Doc Ock the [[tritium]] he needs to create his artificial sun if he will hunt down and deliver Spider-Man to him. After a long battle, Spider-Man surrenders to Doc Ock to protect the civilians who nobly try to defend him. Spider-Man is brought before Harry, who prepares to kill Spider-Man with a dagger. Before he does so, however, he removes Spider-Man's mask, and is shocked to see Peter's face. A dazed Peter regains consciousness, and he convinces Harry to let him go and rescue Mary Jane. At the end of the movie a confused Harry [[hallucinate]]s, seeing his father's image in a mirror, demanding that Harry avenge him. Harry shatters the mirror, only to find his father's hidden lair, with the Green Goblin equipment within. Whether or not Harry will assume his father's legacy will likely be revealed in future ''Spider-Man'' films.
