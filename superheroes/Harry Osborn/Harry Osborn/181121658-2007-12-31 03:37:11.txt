'''Harry Osborn''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[fictional character|character]], both one-time friend and foe to [[Spider-Man]]. Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]], he first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #31 ([[1965#December|December 1965]]).

Son of industrialist [[Norman Osborn]], who was secretly the [[supervillain]] the [[Green Goblin]], Harry became the unlikely friend and college roommate of the nerdy Peter Parker. After witnessing his father battle with Spider-Man and die, Harry swore vengeance on the hero. After discovering that Peter was secretly Spider-Man, Harry became psychotic and took on the mantle of the Green Goblin. Altough dying later to save his friend, due to a lapse in time, Harry has been ressurected and is now with Peter and his friends again.

In the [[Spider-Man film series|''Spider-Man'' film series]], the character is portrayed by actor [[James Franco]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Early life===
Harry was born in [[New York City]] to industrialist [[Norman Osborn]] and his wife Emily. Unfortunately, the circumstances of Harry's birth weakened Emily, and she died after several years of illness. Heartbroken, Norman became a cold and unloving father, either dismissing Harry or lashing out at him in fury. Harry would spend the rest of his life trying desperately to earn his father's approval.

When Harry graduated high school, he enrolled in [[Empire State University]]. Among the wealthiest students in the school, Harry soon became one of the most popular faces in the school, despite his aloof manner. He soon formed a clique of rich, popular students around him. One of these students was the lovely [[Gwen Stacy]]. Gwen soon became intrigued with a new student, a bookish, studious fellow named Peter Parker. Harry took a dislike to Parker, as he resented the amount of attention he was getting from Gwen, and he assumed that the reason Peter was so standoffish was because of snobbery. After confronting Parker, however, Harry discovered that Peter was painfully shy and worried about his ailing aunt, [[Aunt May|May]]. Despite this rocky early start, Harry and Peter became friends, eventually sharing a luxury apartment.

What Harry didn't realize was that Peter was the [[superhero]] Spider-Man, and that he had twice battled his father, who had become the Green Goblin in an accident while attempting to create a super-serum. When the Goblin discovered Spider-Man's identity and captured him, he revealed his own identity to Peter. Horrified that his greatest enemy was his best friend's father, Peter's loyalties were torn during their battle. However, Osborn then fell onto an electric transformer and the resulting shock removed all memory of being the Green Goblin. Spider-Man removed the Goblin's costume and equipment, hoping it was the end of the Goblin menace.

However, Norman's memories would resurface from time to time and he would periodically battle Spider-Man, only to lose his memories again when the fight was over. These were difficult times for Harry. Having experimented with drugs since his teenage years, Harry gradually began experimenting with harder substances, which affected his mental stability and relationships with his friends. Spider-Man used this to his advantage on one occasion when, in battle with the Green Goblin, he was able to stop the fight by showing Norman his son's emaciated condition, brought on by an accidental [[cocaine]] overdose. The sight shocked Norman so much that it brought him back to sanity for what was to be the last time.

It wasn't long after, though, that stress caused Norman to become the Green Goblin again. Harry's life had fallen apart. His relationship with Peter's friend [[Mary Jane Watson]] had come to an end when she dumped him, fed up with his self-destructive lifestyle. A disconsolate Harry turned to drugs and suffered an [[LSD]] overdose. He survived, but this tragedy, compounded by imminent [[bankruptcy]], drove the Green Goblin over the edge. He [[kidnap]]ped Gwen as bait for Spider-Man, and then threw her off the [[George Washington Bridge]]. When Peter pulled her back up with his webbing, she was already dead. A vicious battle between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin ensued, with Peter barely able to control himself from killing the villain. The Goblin then directed his goblin    glider to impale Spider-Man, but the wall-crawler jumped out of the way, and the Goblin was impaled through the chest himself, and seemingly killed. Peter was wracked with guilt and sorrow, but took comfort in the fact that the Green Goblin was finally gone.

===The Second Goblin===
[[Image:Amazingspider136.jpg|250px|thumb|Harry Osborn as the new Green Goblin, battling Spider-Man on the cover of ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #136 by [[Ross Andru]].]]
However, Harry had secretly witnessed the battle. Wanting to protect his father's identity, he stripped Norman's body of the Green Goblin costume and hid it. Blaming Spider-Man for his father's "[[murder]]," Harry swore vengeance. Having inherited his father's company, Harry managed to get the business back in shape as he planned his revenge. One day, to his shock, he found a Spider-Man costume in Peter's apartment, and realized that his best friend was the man he blamed for his father's death. Using his father's old equipment, Harry confronted Peter as the new Green Goblin.<ref>Amazing Spider-Man #136</ref>

Not wanting to hurt Harry, Peter avoided fighting his old friend. Eventually Harry was knocked unconscious and taken into police custody. There he raved that he was the true Green Goblin and Peter Parker was Spider-Man, but was dismissed as a lunatic. He was put in the care of criminal psychologist Dr. Bart Hamilton, who extracted the secrets of the Green Goblin from Harry through [[hypnosis]], and buried the knowledge deep with Harry's mind. However, this was not altruistic on Hamilton's part - he then raided one of Harry's hideouts and became the third Green Goblin, hoping to become the new boss of the underworld. However, his power was no match for his enthusiasm - he never even bothered to use the strength-enhancing formulas on himself, seemingly believing that just ''being'' the Green Goblin would enable him to defeat Spider-Man, and, despite an elaborate plot to kill [[Silvermane]], the power-mad psychologist was killed by a bomb he had planted for Spider-Man. Although he suffered a brief setback during the confrontation with Hamilton, Harry was released and considered cured, sustaining a concussion that made him forget his knowledge of Spider-Man's identity, and he and Peter rekindled their friendship.

For a while, Harry's life seemed back on track; His company began turning [[profit]]s once more, and he developed a romance with [[Liz Allan (Marvel Comics)|Liz Allan]], whom he met at the wedding of [[Betty Brant]] and [[Ned Leeds]]. Not long after, the two were married, and eventually they had a son, whom Harry named Normie in memory of the boy's grandfather. Harry also gave his blessing to the marriage of Peter and Mary Jane. However, Harry started regaining his memories when he was being blackmailed by the [[Hobgoblin (comics)#Roderick Kingsley|original Hobgoblin]], who mailed him a package which contained evidence that his father was the original Green Goblin. When the Hobgoblin learned he had raided all of Norman's hideouts, he left Harry alone, knowing he had nothing more to offer him. Later Harry was forced to act as the Green Goblin a few times, once to defeat [[Hobgoblin (comics)#Jason Macendale|Jason Macendale]], the second Hobgoblin. Macendale sought the Goblin formula that gave the Green Goblin superhuman strength; Harry was able to defeat  Macendale by doubling back during an aerial chase and emptying his entire supply of pumpkin bombs onto the Hobgoblin. Harry even wondered if he could use the Goblin persona for a career as a superhero, but Peter convinced him that the Goblin had too much baggage for such a role, and Harry buried the Goblin menace within his mind once more, and focused on his business and family.

===Death===
[[Image:Harryosborndeath.jpg|thumb|left|230px|The death of Harry Osborn.]]
This tranquility was shattered when the aftereffects of the '''[[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno crisis]]''' sundered the barrier between Harry's conscious and [[subconscious]] minds. Once again he remembered being the Green Goblin - and his irrational hatred of Spider-Man (Harry had now convinced himself that Peter resented the Osborns' 'stable family life' due to never having been wanted by his own parents or guardians, when in fact it was the complete opposite). His sanity shattered, he declared that their next confrontation would be their final one, and only one of them would be alive at the end. To ensure that he was the victor, Harry researched his father's chemical notes, hoping to recreate the original Goblin's superhuman strength. Harry made his own modifications to the formula, and upon ingesting it, it proved better than he had dreamed. The new Goblin Formula had made him stronger than both Spider-Man and his father. Now a physical match for Spider-Man, Harry planned his final revenge.

Harry took to stalking Peter Parker on his Goblin Glider, claiming that there was no law against just soaring around town in a colorful costume, and taunting Peter that someday he would destroy him, but he relished keeping Peter in suspense in the meantime. After weeks of this, Peter finally lost his nerve and struck at Harry, only to be sent flying when Harry hit back, demonstrating his new strength. He then rocketed away, taunting Spider-Man's inability to stop him.

Not long after, Harry held a prestigious dinner at his townhouse, inviting many of his father's old business associates. However, it was actually a trap, and Harry had planted explosives throughout the townhouse, which he planned to detonate, thus destroying everybody who had slighted the Osborns. 

Spider-Man, worrying the most, dropped in to investigate, only to be confronted by Harry as the New Goblin. The two former friends engaged in a dangerous battle, which ended when Harry injected Peter with a drug that left him immobile but still alive. However, even as he celebrated over his victory, he realized that Mary Jane and his son Normie were also in the townhouse, and that the explosives would detonate in thirty seconds. Despite protestations that he was not a hero, Peter convinced Harry to use his damaged glider to get the two to safety. Once Normie and Mary Jane were safe, Harry's sanity finally returned, and he realized that he had left Peter to die. Harry rescued Peter from the explosion just in time. However, as his friends thanked him, he suddenly collapsed. The Goblin Formula was damaged by the explosion, and while it had increased his strength, it was also lethally poisoning him. Paramedics were called, but Harry died en route to the hospital. With his final words, he apologized to Peter, and confirmed that despite everything, they were still, and would always be, best friends.

===Post-Mortem===

Sometime before his death, Harry had created a computer system with copies of his and Norman Osborn's minds programmed into it; after Harry's death, the computer system activated and abducted Normie Osborn with the intent of subjecting him to the Goblin serum (the same one that that caused Harry's death) and making him the newest Green Goblin. This computer facsimile of Harry and it's robotic drones were all destroyed by Spider-Man and the Molten Man, who managed to save Normie from it. <ref> ''Spider-Man: Legacy Of Evil'' </ref>

However, Harry had one last trick up his sleeve. Sometime before his final confrontation with Spider-Man, Harry had employed the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] to construct [[Life Model Decoy]]s of Peter's parents to play with his emotions. The plot ended with both constructs revealed to be fake when both "died," shattering Peter's mind. After nearly killing the Chameleon, Peter found a tape Harry had left before he died, revealing his role in the plot and mocking Peter. Peter went temporarily insane from the shock, which proved that Harry could be as manipulative and cruel as his father ever was when gripped by insanity; Peter even briefly rejected his identity as Peter Parker, until the return of his clone [[Ben Reilly]] snapped him out of his "mood".

===Planned Return===
Towards the end of the Clone Saga, the writers of the Spider-Man books planned to end the series by reviving Harry Osborn, who would be revealed to be the semi-zombified cyborg known as "[[Dr. Mendel Stromm|Gaunt]]". Gaunt was a late entry towards the controversial storyline, created mainly as a plot device to return Harry to life, as the plan for the character included Harry regaining his humanity, taking credit for tricking Peter Parker into thinking he was a clone, and resuming his identity as the Green Goblin fulltime. But the plotline was nixed by newly promoted Editor-In-Chief Bob Harras, who disliked Harry Osborn and instead demanded that the plotline be aborted and Norman Osborn resurrected instead as the mastermind of the Clone Saga.  

So Gaunt was revealed to be Mendel Stromm- the man who originally created the Goblin formula before becoming the villain known as the Robot Master- and Norman Osborn was the real main villain. Norman would reveal, upon his return, that he had in fact died when the glider impaled him, but the unexpected [[healing factor]] effect of the goblin formula regrew his internal organs and reanimated him. After killing someone with a similar body-type to be buried in his place, Norman fled to [[Europe]], hoping to give Harry a chance to prove himself after seeing him trying on the Green Goblin costume. A year after Harry's death, Norman returned to America, nearly driving Spider-Man insane with the [[Clone Saga]] (where Osborn tried to convince Peter that he was his own clone to make Peter lose the will to live) and regaining the mantle of the Green Goblin when he finally revealed himself as the mastermind, shortly before the death of Ben Reilly (the ''real'' clone). If anything, Harry's death has made the rivalry between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin even more bitter than before, as each blames the other for Harry's death.

===Brand New Day===
Following the events of [[Spider-Man: One More Day|One More Day]], Peter and Mary Jane's decision to accept [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]'s offer to erase their marriage from history (and all knowledge of it) in exchange for Aunt May's life, has seemingly resulted in the alteration of the timeline to a undetermined degree. In the now altered reality, it would seem that Harry is alive and is seen celebrating his birthday party with his previously-unseen girlfriend [[Lily Hollister]], Peter, Flash and other friends. Due to this change, his status as the Green Goblin, or his knowledge his father was the Green Goblin and is alive, is unknown at this point. The story is on-going.

==Powers and abilities==
For most of his life, Harry Osborn had no superhuman abilities. When he exposed himself to the experimental Goblin Formula, his strength was perhaps augmented beyond that of either Spider-Man or the Green Goblin. His durability, agility and intelligence likewise increased, but the extent of these augmentations is unknown.

Harry had all of the Green Goblin's equipment, including the explosive "pumpkin bombs" and the razor-edged boomerang blades. He also rode on a modified version of the Goblin Glider that was even faster and more mobile than the original.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Harry Osborn===<!-- This section is linked from [[Green Goblin]] -->
[[Image:Ultsm73.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Cover to ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #73. Art by [[Mark Bagley]].]]

In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, Harry Osborn is a rich kid who meets Peter Parker in public school. Despite the difference between them, the two bond; Harry improves Peter's social status, and Peter helps Harry with his homework. He also had a brief romantic relationship with Peter's soon-to-be girlfriend, Mary Jane Watson.

Harry's father, Norman Osborn, is an industrialist who creates the Oz Formula, an experimental solution intended to turn ordinary humans into superhumans. When a spider injected with the Oz Formula bites Peter, he gains superhuman strength and agility and secretly becomes Spider-Man. Under the pretense of fearing for Peter's health, Norman takes a sample of Peter's blood, and realizes that Oz has made him stronger. Norman then subjects himself to the Oz Formula, becoming a hideous demonic monster: the [[Green Goblin#Ultimate Green Goblin|Green Goblin]].

Insane, Norman attacks his family and destroys his house, killing his wife and almost killing his son. The next day, the Goblin attacks the school but is stopped by Spider-Man. Peter believes that the Goblin had come for him, but Harry says that his father had come to kill him. Harry is then taken into custody and sent to live with his uncle.

When Harry later comes back, he is once again living with his father and is brainwashed by [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Miles Warren]] into believing that his mother had died in a freak accident. He later walks in on a fight between the Green Goblin and Spider-Man, and literally stabs his own father in the back with a shard of glass from a shattered window pane, reverting the creature back into his father. Harry is taken into custody again, but this time by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.#Ultimate S.H.I.E.L.D.|S.H.I.E.L.D.]].

Later, during the events of ''[[Ultimate Six]]'' in which Norman once again escapes and teams up with Spider-Man's old rogues to siege the [[White House]], Harry is used by Nick Fury to negotiate with his father. It almost works as Harry reaches out to his father, but a trigger-happy [[Iron Man]] blasts Osborn with his DNA cannon. His genetic structure now rapidly out of control, Norman lashes out in blind fury only to be gunned down by soldiers right in front of Harry.

Traumatized, Harry vengefully promises to Peter, "All of You. I'll kill all of you for this." (Referring to everyone Harry knows to be involved in the incident.) Harry returns to school, seemingly back to normal, but Peter is suspicious. Harry blames Peter for stealing his girlfriend Mary Jane and later tells her that Peter killed his father.

Through the hypnotic therapy he had Harry under for years, Norman Osborn had planted a post-hypnotic suggestion in the form of his henchman, Shaw. 'Shaw' takes Harry to an OsCorp bunker in New Jersey, where there are reserves of the Oz Serum. (It also appears that the bunker has a copy of [[Doctor Octopus#Ultimate Doctor Octopus|Doctor Octopus]]' mechanical arms and, in an inside joke, all three versions of the Green Goblin face; the classic, the movie version, and the Ultimate one).

Later, Peter (as Spider-Man) confronts Harry, demanding to know why he had told Mary Jane that he killed his father. Shaw then provokes Harry to unleash his hidden abilities. Harry bursts into flame, transforming into the Ultimate version of the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]]. 'Shaw' goads the mutated Harry to battle Spider-Man, but after a lengthy battle the Hobgoblin breaks down and begs Peter to kill him. Peter tries to help Harry, when the 'Shaw' persona takes over once again and attacks Peter.

S.H.I.E.L.D. arrives and Harry attacks them, trying to provoke a lethal counterattack. He is promptly shot down, to Peter's horror. Spider-Man then attacks Nick Fury before leaving. It later turns out that Harry is not dead, just seriously wounded.

It is later revealed that Harry was caught in the same accident that created both The Green Goblin and Doctor Octopus, with Norman grabbing him by the throat. Whether this or the Oz bunker later caused the transformation is uncertain.

He reappears in the wake of his father's escape and return to the pubic spotlight. Carol Danvers (acting as head of S.H.E.I.L.D.) uses him as a tool broadcasting a staged press conference to Peter's house, where his father currntly is, where he states that his father is a cruel, vicious monster, and a murderer to which Norman is not pleased. Norman changes into the Green Goblin and makes his way to the Triskelion before Harry can be taken to safety. He is followed by Peter. Harry changes into the Hobgoblin to protect himself and the S.H.I.E.L.D. operatives. He viciously fights his father, but is cruelly beaten, reverting him to human form. Norman does not notice this, however, and promptly beats him to death. Shocked by what he has done, Norman changes back to human form and shakes the lifeless body of his son. He then asks the S.H.I.E.L.D. soldiers to kill him, which they gladly do.

Like the mainstream version, the Ultimate Hobgoblin conceived his powers via an acquaintance showing him the Green Goblin's 'Hideout', and he is marginally less insane than the Green Goblin. Also, he has shown a remarkable healing factor - regrowing teeth and skin within minutes - and bullet-proof skin. He is also able to immolate himself in flame, and possesses tremendous strength.

==In other media==
===Television===

Despite his early importance in the Spider-Man mythos, Harry made few to no appearances in most Spider-Man animated series until the [[1990s]].

==== Spider-Man (1981) ====

While he made no appearances on the [[Spider-Man (1981 TV series)|1981 Spider-Man]] cartoon, he is frequently mentioned in the episode "The Vulture Has Landed".  He is Peter's friend and roommate, and is said to be a scientist (having invented invisible paint which The Vulture hoped to acquire). Oddly enough in ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'', the [[Green Goblin]] goes after a "Norma Osborn" (his niece) instead of Harry.  

==== Spider-Man: The Animated Series ====

In the [[Spider-Man: The Animated Series|1994 ''Spider-Man'' series]], Harry is voiced by [[Gary Imhoff]]. 

In this adaptation, Harry was Peter Parker's roommate in college. Their friendship seemed less strained and [[Gwen Stacy]] was not featured. Harry played an overall minor role, though he did act as a something of a rival for [[Mary Jane Watson]]'s affections in at least one episode. 

After the original Green Goblin becomes trapped in the [[Negative Zone]], he appears to Harry. Soon, Harry unwilling made into a replacement for and by the original Green Goblin, who contacted him while in limbo. Harry tried to kill Spider-Man numerous times while the Green Goblin promised to allow Harry to see his presumed deceased father, Norman Osborn. However, Harry always failed, once getting into some trouble with the [[Punisher]] as well. In the end, Harry realized in horror that the Green Goblin was his father and instead of wanting to quit, he began to lose his sanity. Now acting as if he enjoys becoming the new villain, he continued to want Spider-Man dead. This led to a fierce confrontation where Spider-Man knocked him out while on the [[George Washington Bridge]]. He was then taken to Ravencroft by Spider-Man. 

Later, when Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson were getting married, Harry found out and grew insane, as he was in love with MJ. He interrupted the wedding and threatened to blow up the church the wedding was taking place, wanting Mary Jane to marry him instead of Peter. In the end, [[Liz Allan]] appealed to Harry, convincing him not to blow up the church nor marry Mary Jane. Told by Liz that he is loved, he walked out peacefully and the wedding resumed.

==== Spider-Man: The New Animated Series ====

In the 2003 [[MTV Spider-Man]] series, which ties in with the [[Spider-Man movies]], Harry is voiced by [[Ian Ziering]].  Harry had a dark tone in this series due to his hatred of Spider-Man, blaming the hero for Norman Osborn's death.

==== The Spectacular Spider-Man ====

Harry Osborn will appear in [[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|''The Spectacular Spider-Man'']], voiced by [[James Arnold Taylor]].

===Films===
In the [[Spider-Man film series]], Harry is played by actor [[James Franco]].

====Spider-Man====
In ''[[Spider-Man (film)|Spider-Man]]'', Harry is one of Peter's high school classmates practically his only friend, who resents the fact that his father spends more time at his job than being with him and seems to understand the brilliant Peter is better than him.  This is evident when Norman learns that Peter is able to understand his [[nanotechnology]] papers, wins the science award, and expresses his desire to make his own way in the world.  Harry is constantly trying to live up to his father's expectations, including trying to make girlfriend [[Mary Jane Watson|M.J.]] look stunning.  He decides to date Mary Jane despite his knowledge of Peter's interest in her and fails to tell him.  Later, he says that Peter never made a move.  In the past, Harry protected Peter from bullying, and Peter tutored him in science.  After graduation, Harry's father gets them a loft apartment next to the university.  Early in the movie, Peter becomes Spider-Man and Norman becomes the Green Goblin, but Harry remains unaware that the two are his best friend and his father.  As he is growing more terrified of the Green Goblin persona, Norman begs Harry for forgiveness for not being a good father, and the two reconcile somewhat after Harry's break-up with M.J..

However, at the end of the film, the Green Goblin is killed by his own glider after attempting to kill Spider-Man.  Following Norman's last wish to not let Harry know about his villainous identity, Spider-Man removes the Goblin's costume and returns Norman's body to the Osborn mansion.  Harry, seeing Spider-Man carrying Norman's body, assumes that Spider-Man has murdered his father.  Harry grabs a gun from a drawer, but Spider-Man leaves before Harry can react.  At Norman's funeral, a brooding Harry tells Peter that Spider-Man will pay for the death of his father.  In the film interpretation, Harry is more of an odd duck who lacks the popularity that he had in the comics.  He is also more angry and bitter in his relationship with his father, though the two begin rebuilding their relationship before Norman's death.

====Spider-Man 2====
In ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'', Harry takes over his late father's career but his business failures and unresolved resentment towards Peter, who he feels is siding with Spider-Man rather than with him, cause him to slowly spiral into alcoholism.  His vendetta against Spider-Man brings him into an alliance with [[Doctor Octopus]], whom Harry had funded in his research back when Ock was the innocent scientist, Dr. Otto Octavius.  Harry agrees to supply Ock with the [[tritium]] that he needs for his experiments if the villain will hunt down and deliver Spider-Man.  After a long battle, Spider-Man is beaten by Doc Ock while civilian bystanders nobly try to defend him.  Spider-Man is brought before Harry, keeping his word by giving up the tritium, who prepares to kill Spider-Man with a dagger.  Before he does so, however, he removes Spider-Man's mask, and is shocked to see Peter's face.  A dazed Peter Parker regains consciousness, and he convinces Harry to let him go and rescue [[Mary Jane Watson]].

At the end of the movie a confused Harry [[hallucinate]]s, seeing his father's image in a mirror, demanding that Harry avenge him.  Harry shatters the mirror, only to find his father's hidden lair, with the Green Goblin equipment within.  The scene starts with Harry going through a spooky and empty walkway.  He runs into the Goblin mask and is terrified until he backs up into the shelves holding pumpkin bombs, realizing that his father was the Green Goblin.  He turns and sees the serum that made his father the Green Goblin.  He steps out of the shadows as he walks closer to the Goblin Glider with The Green Goblin's theme playing and the camera zooming back.  His last appearance in the movie is at Mary Jane's wedding ceremony, being the only guest wearing a green bow tie, during which she runs away for Peter.

[[Image:New Goblin front view.jpg‎|frame|thumb|left|Harry appearing in the third film as the New Goblin.]]
In the 2007 feature film, ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'', little has changed about him except that he is more determined than ever to kill Spider-Man/Peter in which he becomes a supervillain, and later, a superhero.  Though remaining unnamed throughout the film, this new villain is credited as '''''The New Goblin''''' and is derisively referred to by Peter Parker as "Little Goblin Junior."  The New Goblin wears a dark costume with some green features. In contrast to the Green Goblin costume worn by his father, which was intended to, among other things, terrorize people in general, Harry wears a more streamlined suit that is not meant to terrorize anyone, and is constructed for the sole purpose of defeating and killing Spider-Man. The suit is armed with retractable arm blades.  He also wields a green sword, dubbed the "Ionic Sword" which has an electrical current running along the blade that sparks green whenever it hits something, and a small dagger with a yellowish gold handle. He doesn't wear a demonic-looking mask like his father, but retractable facial gear consisting of a pair of reflective green [[goggles]] and a green mouthpiece, similar to a [[paint-ball]] mask.  In the scene in which Harry is in the lab and is in the chamber, a slow pan around the room is shown, with a preview of the new technology, and a third mask:  a yellow mask sitting between the Green Goblin's and the New Goblin's, as an onscreen reference to the allegations that Harry would be the Hobgoblin.  After exposing himself to the Human-Enhancer Formula, he also gains superhuman [[Physical strength|strength]], [[Sport agility|agility]], [[reflex]]es, durability, [[Endurance|stamina]], [[sense]]s and [[healing]], all comparable to both [[Green]] Goblin and Spider-Man himself. Ironically, it doesn't drive him insane as it did his father.

The New Goblin rides a hi-tech [[snowboard]]-shaped glider called the ''Sky Stick'', which also goes unnamed in the film.  The glider houses the Goblin's pumpkin bombs, razor bats (pumpkin bombs with razor-sharp wings extending from the centre), rockets, 4 machine guns (not used in the film) a flame-thrower and two razor-sharp spikes. It is also used as a striking weapon by him, which director Sam Raimi likes to call "Sky-Jitsu". Much like its Goblin predecessor, the Sky Stick can fly in all directions. The New Goblin can turn it from a horizontal position, akin to how his father rides, to a vertical position much like a snowboard allowing him to move faster and go down narrow alley-ways. When he turns the Sky Stick to the vertical position, the engine beneath rotates in the direction he is moving, lining it vertically with the Sky Stick. The New Goblin manages to stay on his Sky Stick using two high-powered, green glowing rotors which create a vacuum and suck his feet onto the board. The Sky Stick is propelled by one main engine that rotates to the direction he's going and by three smaller jets on each end, which double as flame-throwers. The Sky Stick is integrated with the New Goblin's suit, and can home in on its rider whenever the two are separated. When separated, the green lights turn red.

After an intense battle with Spider-Man, Harry Osborn is knocked out and given amnesia to the point where he doesn't recall Peter being responsible for his father's death. As such, the two work on rekindle their old friendship. However, when Mary Jane and Peter have difficulties in their relationship, she goes to Harry to be friends. Although they kiss, Mary Jane does not want to have a relationship with Harry. Visions of Norman Osborn persist, forcing Harry to remember. Taking Norman's advice of attacking the [[Heart (symbol)|heart]], Harry attempts to destroy Peter and MJ's relationship by [[blackmail]]ing MJ to dump Peter and claim that Harry is dating her.  Otherwise, Peter will die. This leads to yet another brutal fight with Peter (currently under the symbiote's influence) at his mansion, which ends with Peter mocking Harry on his persona and his relationship with his father. In retaliation, Harry throws a pumpkin bomb towards Peter, but Peter anticipates this, redirecting the bomb at Harry with his webbing. The resulting explosion mutilates the right side of Harry's face.

After [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] and [[Venom (Eddie Brock)|Venom]], the later who had Spider-Man's [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] costume which Peter rejected for his terrible deeds and went to Eddie Brock, kidnap Mary Jane to force Spider-Man into action, Peter goes to the disfigured Harry for help. Harry at first refuses, but once his butler Bernard informs him that he knew all along that Norman's death was a result of his own weaponry and not due to Spider-Man, he goes to help Spider-Man rescue Mary Jane. In the ensuing conflict, Harry is [[Impalement|impaled]] and Murdered by his own glider by Venom, sacrificing himself to save Peter. As he dies, Peter, (who just forgave Sandman for accidentally killing his Uncle Ben years earlier), and Harry finally forgive each other, with Harry telling him that Peter's his best friend. Peter and Mary Jane attend Harry's funeral together, heartbroken, and they begin fixing their relationship Harry and the symbiote broke.

"''No matter what comes our way, no matter what battle we have raging inside us, we always have a choice. My friend Harry taught me that. He chose to be the best of himself. It's the choices that make us who we are and we can always choose to do what's right.''"

--Peter to Harry at the latter's funeral

==Video games==
* Harry makes an appearance in the ''[[Spider-Man: The Movie (video game)|Spider-Man: The Movie]]'' video game in Peter's scrapbook. After the player beats the game on the Hero difficulty level the player is able to play through the game with an altered storyline while playing as Harry on the Goblin glider and suit. He investigates when he discovers an old memo of his father's after his death that states he hired the Skull Gang to commit crimes. Further through the game, it is revealed that an assassin hired by the Goblin who was given a Goblin Glider and arsenal is attempting to take over Oscorp, and is killed by Harry. The playable version has all attacks used by the enemy Green Goblin, replacing Spider-Man's web attacks. All of Spider-Man's attack combos are still available.
* He also makes an appearance in the ''[[Spider-Man 2 (video game)|Spider-Man 2]]'' video game.
* He appears as the villain New Goblin in ''[[Spider-Man 3 (video game)|Spider-Man 3]]''. The [[PS3]] & [[Xbox 360]] versions of the game features him as a playable character, outside of a small section during the Finale mission at the end of the game (Although for the Xbox version, you need to download him from the Xbox Live Marketplace).
* He is as an unlockable ally in the game ''[[Spider-Man: Friend or Foe]]'' voiced by [[Josh Keaton]]. He is unlocked upon completion of the game and does not actually appear in the game's storyline other than the opening movie sequence.
* He appears (as New Goblin) in the game The Battle Within as the first boss. He is one of the 2 battles with the black suit.
