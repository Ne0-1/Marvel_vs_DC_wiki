'''Mind-Wave''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]].

Mind-Wave was a criminal possessing mental abilities heightened by his own inventions.  This megalomaniac robbed banks in Europe and America until stopped by [[Daredevil (comics)|Daredevil]] and [[Uri Geller]].

Mind-Wave’s mental abilities failed to warn him about the [[Scourge of the Underworld]], who killed him in the “Bar With No Name” massacre.

==Equipment==
Mind-Wave wore a helmet of his own design that boosted his natural mind powers.  With his, he had the following abilities: ESP, with which he could blindside a nontelepathic opponent at will; and mental communication with others wearing similar helmets, his “think tank,” or with other ESPers.

Mind-Wave also used his “Think Tank”, a large, heavily armed vehicle control by his mental powers, and used to rob banks.  It had heat-ray cannons.

He also carried hand-held versions of the heat ray.
