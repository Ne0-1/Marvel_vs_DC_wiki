'''Mind-Wave''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
{{expand-section|date=December 2016}}
Mind-Wave first appeared in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #133 (May 1976), and was created by [[Marv Wolfman]], [[Bob Brown (comics)|Bob Brown]] and [[Jim Mooney]]. The character subsequently appears in ''Captain America'' #319 (July 1986), in which he was killed by the [[Scourge of the Underworld]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Erik Gelden===
Mind-Wave was a megalomaniac criminal possessing mental abilities heightened by his own inventions.  He robbed banks in Europe and America until stopped by [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and [[Uri Geller]]. At the time he utilized his 'think tank', capable of firing various weapons.<ref>[http://www.comicbookdb.com/issue.php?ID=7058 ''Daredevil'' #133]</ref>

Mind-Wave's mental abilities failed to warn him about the [[Scourge of the Underworld]], who killed him in the "Bar With No Name" massacre.<ref>{{cite comic|writer = [[Mark Gruenwald]]|penciller = [[Paul Neary]]|inker = [[Dennis Janke]]|story = Overkill|title = [[Captain America]]|volume = 1|issue = 319|date = July 1986|publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref>

Mind-Wave was later among the eighteen criminals, all murdered by the Scourge, to be resurrected by [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] using the power of [[Dormammu]] as part of a squad assembled to eliminate the [[Punisher]].<ref>''Punisher'' Vol. 7 #5</ref> Mirage disguises himself, Mind-Wave, and some of the other criminals as a team of [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] trying to kill the Punisher. After the Punisher uncovers the ruse, he captures Mirage, kills Mind-Wave with a grenade, and leaves him with a grenade as a booby trap for the other criminals to find.<ref>''Punisher'' Vol. 7 #8</ref>

===Second Mind-Wave===
A new Mind-Wave appeared as a [[Registration acts (comics)#2006 Superhuman Registration Act|Superhuman Registration Act]] violator. He amused the officers of a Las Vegas, Nevada police precinct by claiming he was there to officially protest the Registration Act and stating that his codename was different from the man who was called "Mind Hyphen Wave." He then used his telekinetic powers to destroy the station and kill the officers present before calmly surrendering to the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #116</ref>

Mind-Wave was escorted to a cell in Thunderbolts Mountain. When the guards walked away, he began a telepathic conversation with fellow prisoners Caprice, [[Blue Streak (comics)#Caged Angels|Bluestreak]] and [[Mirage (Marvel Comics)#Caged Angels|Mirage]]. He suggested that it would be fun to interfere with the surgery scheduled to be performed on [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #117</ref> However, Bullseye recovered from his surgery while Mindwave was focusing on the other Thunderbolts, and killed Mind-Wave and his allies in their cells using thrown scalpels.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #121</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The first Mind-Wave wore a helmet of his own design that boosted his natural mind powers particularly [[Extrasensory perception|ESP]], with which he could blindside a non-telepathic opponent at will.  His helmet also enabled him to communicate mentally with others wearing similar helmets, with his "Think Tank" or with other ESPers. Mind-Wave's "Think Tank" was a large, heavily armed vehicle control by his mental powers which he used to rob banks. It had heat-ray cannons. He also carried hand-held versions of the heat ray.

The second Mind-Wave was primarily a very powerful telekinetic, with the ability to destroy structures and halt and redirect hails of bullets in mid-flight. He also had some measure of telepathic ability, which he used to converse with his fellow prisoners and combine his power with theirs, in an attempt to destroy Thunderbolts by driving them insane. He wore a costume composed of dark body armor and a helmet resembling a gas mask.{{issue|date=February 2013}}
