'''Mind-Wave''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]].

==First Mind-Wave==
===Publication history===
Mind-Wave first appeared in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]'' #133 (May 1976), and was created by [[Marv Wolfman]], [[Bob Brown (comics)|Bob Brown]] and [[Jim Mooney]].

The character subsequently appears in ''Captain America'' #319 (July 1986), in which he was killed by the [[Scourge of the Underworld]].

===Fictional character biography===
Mind-Wave was a megalomaniac criminal possessing mental abilities heightened by his own inventions.  He robbed banks in Europe and America until stopped by [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] and [[Uri Geller]].<ref>[http://www.comicbookdb.com/issue.php?ID=7058 ''Daredevil'' #133]</ref>

Mind-Wave’s mental abilities failed to warn him about the [[Scourge of the Underworld]], who killed him in the “Bar With No Name” massacre.

==Powers and abilities==
Mind-Wave wore a helmet of his own design that boosted his natural mind powers particularly [[Extrasensory perception|ESP]], with which he could blindside a non-telepathic opponent at will.  His helmet also enabled him to communicate mentally with others wearing similar helmets, with his "Think Tank" or with other ESPers.

Mind-Wave's "Think Tank" was a large, heavily armed vehicle control by his mental powers which he used to rob banks.  It had heat-ray cannons.  He also carried hand-held versions of the heat ray.

==Second Mind-Wave==
A new Mindwave appeared as a [[Registration acts (comics)#2006 Superhuman Registration Act|Superhuman Registration Act]] violator.  He attacked a police station in Las Vegas, Nevada after declaring his opposition to the Registration Act and stating that his codename was different from the man who was called "Mind Hyphen Wave." He surrendered, stating that he expected to be arrested by the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #116</ref>

Mindwave was next seen being escorted to a cell in Thunderbolts Mountain.  When the guards had walked away, he began a telepathic conversation with fellow prisoners Caprice, [[Blue Streak (comics)#Caged Angels|Bluestreak]] and [[Mirage (Marvel Comics)#Caged Angels|Mirage]].  He suggested that it would be fun to interfere with the surgery scheduled to be performed on [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #117</ref>

However, Bulleseye recovered from his surgery while Mindwave was focusing on the other Thunderbolts, and killed Mindwave and then his allies in their cells by throwing scalpels into their heads.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #121</ref>
