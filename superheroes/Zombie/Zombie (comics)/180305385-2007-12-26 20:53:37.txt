'''The Zombie''' ('''Simon William Garth''') is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[supernatural]] character in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel universe|universe]], who starred in the black-and-white, [[horror fiction|horror]]-[[comic]] [[magazine]] series ''Tales of the Zombie'' (1973-1975).  The character had originated 20 years earlier in the standalone story "Zombie" by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Bill Everett]], published in the horror-[[anthology]] [[comic book]] ''Menace'' #5 (July 1953) from Marvel forerunner [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]].

==Publication history==
As Lee had done years before in reviving [[Henry Pym]] from a standalone [[science fiction]] story to become the [[superhero]] [[Ant-Man]], then-editor-in-chief [[Roy Thomas]] likewise plucked a character from, in this case, a pre-[[Comics Code]] horror tale. The initial modern story, co-scripted by Thomas and [[Steve Gerber]] and drawn by [[John Buscema]] and [[Tom Palmer (comics)|Tom Palmer]], was a 12-page tale that led into a seven-page reprint of the 1950s story (with the art slightly altered to give the Zombie shoulder-length rather than short hair). That original story was also reprinted in 1975's ''Tales of the Zombie Annual'' #1, and again two decades later in ''Curse of the Weird'' #4 (March 1994), the final issue of a short-lived Marvel horror reprint series.

Following the premiere, all the Zombie stories were by Gerber and artist [[Pablo Marcos]] (one of these in collaboration with writer [[Doug Moench]] and artist [[Alfredo Alcala]]. The original series' finale, set at Garth's daughter's wedding in issue #9, was a three-chapter story written by [[Tony Isabella]] (chapter 2 with co-scripter [[Chris Claremont]]), and drawn by [[pencilers]] Virgilio Redondo, Yong Montano, and [[Ron Wilson (comics)|Ron Wilson]], respectively, and [[inker]] by Alcala (chapters 1-2) and Marcos (chapter 3).

''Tales of the Zombie'' published the last work of [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden Age]] great [[Syd Shores]], [[Captain America]]'s first penciler following [[Jack Kirby]]'s departure from the character in 1941. Shores had finished penciling two-thirds of the eight-page story "Voodoo War" for issue #5 (May 1974) before dying of a heart seizure. [[Dick Ayers]] penciled the remainder of writer [[Tony Isabella]]'s anthological horror tale.

Although laid to peaceful rest in ''Tales of the Zombie'' # 9 (he did not appear in the following, final issue, which contained a [[Brother Voodoo]] story and three anthological tales), Simon Garth was reanimated in the horror-comics magazine ''Bizarre Adventures'' #33 (Dec. 1982), in an out-of-chronology story hard to reconcile with the remainder of the character's continuity. The Zombie returned to color comic books in a backup story in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil Annual]]'' # 9 (July 1993). At the time of that appearance, the Zombie remained unearthed, and controlled by Donna, who pledged to have him eliminate other such enthralled undead.

The Zombie thereafter appeared in ''[[Peter Parker: Spider-Man]] Annual '97'' (1997); in a behind-the-scenes references in ''[[Blade (comics)|Blade]]: Crescent City Blues'' #1 (March 1998) leading into a guest appearance in ''[[Spider-Man]] Unlimited'' #20 (May 1998); and in a solo story in the anthology series ''[[Strange Tales]]'' vol. 3, #1 (Sept. 1998).

In 2006, a new Zombie named "John Doe" briefly appeared, alongside other 1970s Marvel-monster characters, as a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent in ''[[Nick Fury's Howling Commandos]]''.  A revamped version of the Zombie appeared in a new continuity in the [[MAX (comics)|MAX]] Mature Readers imprint in the four-issue miniseries ''Zombie'' (Nov. 2006 - Feb. 2007), written by [[Mike Raicht]] and illustrated by [[Kyle Hotz]].  The original version of the Zombie starred in a solo story in the [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] omnibus ''[[Man-Thing|Legion of Monsters: Man-Thing]] #1'' (May 2007).

==Fictional character biography==
[[Image:Menace5 AtlasComics.jpg|thumb|left|''Menace'' #5 (July 1953), cover art by [[Bill Everett]].]]
Simon William Garth was born in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], and became a work-obsessed executive of Garth Manor [[coffee]], based in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], [[United States]]. Ambushed and kidnapped by his former gardener, whom he had fired, Garth is to be a [[voodoo]] cult's [[human sacrifice]]. However, the cult's priestess, Layla, recognizes Garth as her own everyday-life employer, with whom she is in love. Though her attempt to let him escape is thwarted, and though she is forced to mystically transform his corpse into a [[zombie]] with a clouded mind whom holders of the matching amulet could control, Layla, with her grandfather, Papa Doc Kabel, continue to try to help the uncomprehending Zombie reach his final rest.

Supernaturally strong and able to heal mystically from injuries, he retains some vestige of his soul. Layla and Papa Doc, for instance, allow Garth 24 hours in his restored human self in order that he might attend the wedding of his daughter, Donna. 

He was eventually permanently laid to rest.<ref>''Tales of the Zombie'' #8</ref>

==Powers==
As Zombie, Garth is virtually mindless and is forced to obey anyone who held the duplicate of the Amulet of Damballah which he wore around his neck. 

==Other Zombies==
There are a few other characters in the Marvel Universe known as Zombie.  These include: 
*In ''Tales of the Zombie'' #4, a Zombie of Ancient Egypt appeared.  The person died violently under unknown circumstances and was reanimated as a zombie by an unidentified man by calling upon [[Anubis]] & [[Ereshkigal]].  The man had him forced a woman to marry him, but the woman eventually learned how to control the zombie and she had it slay the man.
*A new Zombie, whose true identity is never revealed and is known only as John Doe, is a member of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]â€™s Paranormal Containment Unit. His only appearances occurred in the  2005/2006  series ''[[Nick Fury's Howling Commandos]]''.
*A giant of unknown origin was known as the Zombie Master; he used a machine to transform others into a zombie-like state.  His machine instead empowered Dr. Jack Castle, who defeated him and became the Fiery Mask.  He was also known as the Master and appeared in ''Daring Mystery Comics'' #1.  He also had giant buzzards that guarded his prison.
*In ''Black Panther'' vol. 4 #5, there were Zombie soldiers who were sent to invade [[Wakanda (Marvel)|Wakanda]] which forced the nation to be evacuated by [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]].
*The [[alternate reality]] ''Zombie'' [[miniseries]], published under Marvel's [[MAX (comics)|MAX]] [[imprint]], depicts Simon Garth as a bank teller who, with his coworker Layla, becomes tangled in the affairs of two robbers and an infectious zombifying gas. Simon plants paint bombs in the money bags and only he can defuse them, so he and Layla are kidnapped and accidentally brought into the zombie quarantine zone, thinking that the barriers were to stop the robbers from escaping rather than to keep the undead in check.
