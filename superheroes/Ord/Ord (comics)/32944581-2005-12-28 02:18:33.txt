==Character biography==
===Ord's mission===
Ord is a member of an alien race from a planet called the Breakworld. He was sent to Earth on a mission to stop a mutant from destroying the Breakworld (an event predicted using his race's advanced technology). To this end Ord obtained the body of the [[X-Men|X-Man]] [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] and resurrected him using superior Breakworld technology. Ord proceeded to experiment on Colossus and with the assistance of the human scientist [[Kavita Rao|Dr. Kavita Rao]] using his [[DNA]] to develop a cure for the mutant condition in the hope that this would prevent the destruction of his planet. In doing all this Ord was acting with the tacit consent of [[Abigail Brand|Special Agent Abigail Brand]], the head of [[S.W.O.R.D.]]('''S'''entient '''W'''orld '''O'''bservation and '''R'''esponse '''D'''epartment), who was attempting to avert a potential war between Earth and the Breakworld.

===Encounters with the X-Men===
During their first encounter Ord nearly defeated the [[X-Men]] but was caught off guard by [[Lockheed (comics)|Lockheed]]. Later, Ord was nearly killed by an enraged Colossus after he had been released by his X-Men comrades, but was prevented from doing so by Special Agent Brand and [[Nick Fury]] accompanied by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents. After one last attempt to escape aboard a spaceship was thwarted by [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]], Ord was delivered into the custody of S.H.I.E.L.D.

==Powers and abilities==
Ord possesses strength much greater than that of a human and is also capable of flight. It is unclear whether these attributes are shared by all members of his race, or if they are the product of alien technology.
