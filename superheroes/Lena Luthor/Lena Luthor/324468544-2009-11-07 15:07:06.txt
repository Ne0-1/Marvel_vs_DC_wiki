'''Lena Luthor''' is a [[fictional character]] in [[DC Comics|DC Comics']] [[Superman]] series. 

==Original version==

In Silver Age continuity, Lena is [[Lex Luthor|Lex Luthor's]] younger sister.  After Lex began his villainous career, his family changed their last name in shame to the [[anagram]] 'Thorul'. As a result, Lena never knew she had an older brother, as Lex Luthor himself (with occasional help from [[Supergirl]] and [[Superman]]) worked to keep her from learning the truth.   Lena appeared irregularly in DC Comics' from 1961 to 1975. Lena had [[psychic]]/[[empath]]ic abilities.

==Modern version==

After ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', Lena Luthor is the child of Lex Luthor and [[Conte]]ssa Erica Del Portenza. She is named after Lex's foster sister who had been killed by their [[Foster care|foster father]], Casey Griggs. After Lena's birth, Lex takes advantage of Contessa Erica's wish to be [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] at [[Childbirth|child birth]] by keeping her permanently drugged and unconscious at his [[Corporation|corporate]] headquarters, not wishing to share his daughter's love with anyone else.

When [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac 13]] arrives from the 64th century, the modern [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]] possesses the infant Lena to escape it.  Even after Brainiac leaves Lena's body, Luthor trades her to Braniac 13 for control of the future technology that has transformed [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]. 

Lena returns to visit Lex Luthor during the ''[[Our Worlds at War]]'' [[fictional crossover|crossover]], where she has apparently been aged to adolescence by Brainiac 13.  Lena plays a sneaky role during the event, helping Luthor and his allies beat [[Imperiex]] by feeding her father information, while secretly manipulating events to benefit Brainiac 13.  She is ultimately convinced at the end to side with her father. At the end of the crossover, Brainiac 13 and Imperiex are both destroyed, and Lena is regressed to infanthood and returned to her father by Superman, who tells Luthor that he now has a second chance to try to be a man instead of a god.

Following ''[[Our Worlds At War]]'', Lena appears infrequently, sometimes shown as still having Brainiac discs on her forehead. 

In the ''Superman's Metropolis'' miniseries the [[artificial intelligence]] controlling the B-13 technology believes itself to be Lena Luthor. When it creates a human body (female, but bald) to pursue a romantic relationship with [[Jimmy Olsen]], Superman confronts her with the real Lena Luthor, making her realize her personality is a computer simulation of Lena's. 

Lena has not appeared since Luthor lost the presidency, and her current status is unknown.

In ''[[Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds]]'' #3, Legionnaires [[Polar Boy]], [[Wildfire (comics)|Wildfire]], and [[Dawnstar]] travel to Smallville during the 20th Century, back to when Superman was still a suburban legend. The three heroes arrive to the Luthor household, where they hear a young Lex Luthor arguing with his father about his mother and sister, which could indicate that the pre-Crisis Lena has been restored to the post-Crisis continuity.<ref>''Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds]]'' #3</ref>

==[[Supergirl]]: Cosmic Adventures in the Eighth Grade==
The pre-Crisis Lena is a main character in the series. Here, she is Lex Luthor's thirteen year old sister who attends the same boarding school as [[Supergirl]]. This version is also aware that Lex is her older brother, and holds a very deep prejudice against superheroes, [[Superman]] in particular. She loses this hatred at the end of the series.

==Appearances in other media==
===Television===
A version of Lena Luthor appeared in two episodes of the [[Superboy (TV series)|''Superboy'']] TV series which aired from 1988 to 1992. In the two-part story "Know Thine Enemy", Lena appears in flashbacks of Lex Luthor's childhood while Superboy experiences Lex's life through a device Luthor invented called a "psychodisk". Young Lena is played by Jennifer Hawkins. In part one, Lena and Lex are frequently abused by their father. Young Lex is very protective of Lena, and tries to stop his father from beating her, only to get a beating himself. Lex and Lena dream of one day escaping from their less-than-perfect home life. Eventually, Lex urges Lena to go spend the night at a friend's house and builds a bomb with which he plans to kill his parents while Lena is away. He has taken out a life insurance policy on them and plans to collect it after their deaths. He eventually does kill them, though the scene is not depicted in the episode because Superboy escapes the psychodisk recording before it can happen.

In part two, the adult Lena appears, played by [[Denise Gossett]]. [[Lana Lang]] seeks out Lena, who has faked her own death and changed her name to escape the curse of the Luthor name. Her apparent death has driven Lex over the edge, causing him to construct a series of bombs that will wipe out all life on earth, leaving only android duplicates of himself and Lena on the planet. Because Lena is the only person Luthor claims to have ever loved, Lana believes she can stop his mad plan. Lena is taken to Luthor's underground hideout and attempts to get him to stop the countdown on his bombs. Luthor denies that he ever loved Lena, but the android duplicate of Lex stops the countdown with seconds to spare and attempts to get Lena to stay with him so they can have the better life they had always dreamed of. Lex deactivates the android and Lena leaves, never to be seen again.

Lena Luthor has not appeared in the television show "[[Smallville]]'.

===Animation===
In the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode, "The Clash", a building in Lex Luthor's Lexor City bears the name "Lena Luthor Memorial Hospital." Whether this refers to Lex's sister, daughter, or another relation is unknown.
