==Fictional character biography==
===Origins===
[[Image:Nekron.PNG|thumb|160px|left|Nekron, as he first appeared in ''Tales of the Green Lantern Corps'' #2. Art by [[Joe Staton]].]]
Nekron is a fictional embodiment of [[Death (personification)|Death]] and ruler of a region adjoining [[Hell (DC Comics)|Hell]] that also seems to border on [[Limbo (DC Comics)|Limbo]] and [[Purgatory]] within the [[DC Universe]]. It is where the souls of the dead await passage to their final residence in either the [[Silver City (comics)|Silver City]] or Hell. Nekron draws his power from the souls and spirits of all those who have ever died.<ref name="tglc1">''Tales of the Green Lantern Corps'' vol. 1 #2 (June 1981)</ref>

During the three issue miniseries ''Tales of the Green Lantern Corps'', [[Krona (comics)|Krona]]'s banished energy form somehow reaches Nekron's realm; a rift opens between the dimensions due to the paradox of an immortal now being in the Realm of the Dead. Desiring the living world he is now able to see, but being too large to pass through the rift, Nekron recreates Krona as an undead being of enormous power instead. Given an army of similarly-restored spirits, Nekron sends Krona to kill the [[Guardians of the Universe]] in order to increase the size of the rift. Krona cooperates because part of Nekron's plan involves collapsing the universe so as to recreate it according to his own desires (which would give Krona the chance to see a universe being born). Krona and his minions kill several Guardians and [[Green Lantern]]s while destroying the Central Power Battery to prevent the Lanterns from recharging their power rings. Although his attack is powerful enough to shatter the morale of the [[Green Lantern Corps]], [[Hal Jordan]] manages to inspire and rally his fellow Lanterns into attacking Krona with the charge still left in their rings. Nekron is defeated when Jordan enters the realm of the dead and incites the spirits of the recently-killed Lanterns to rebel against him. This gives the Guardians enough time to banish Krona into the dead realm and close the rift with Jordan still trapped inside. The spirit of Jordan's predecessor, [[Abin Sur]], helps him escape the realm.<ref>''Tales Of The Green Lantern Corps'' vol. 1 #3 (July 1981)</ref>

===Later appearances===
[[Captain Atom]] has a run-in with Nekron in the pages of ''Captain Atom'' #42 and #43 (June-July 1990), in which he is described as "Death as the Ultimate Opponent." [[Black Racer]], also making an appearance, is coined "Death as an Inevitability," while [[Death (DC Comics)|Death]] (prominently known from her appearances in [[Vertigo Comics|Vertigo]] titles) represents "Death as the Release, as Mercy, as Compassion." Drawing into the Quantum field, Captain Atom is able to get the better of Nekron and is able to visit his deceased wife.<ref name="cp42-43">''Captain Atom'' (vol. 1) #42-43 (June-July 1990)</ref>

Nekron later appears in ''[[Fate (comics)|Fate]]'' #12 where he battles the demon [[Nebiros]], following the destruction of [[Doctor Fate]]'s Tower Of Fate. Also appearing in this issue is Jared Stevens (Fate).<ref>''Fate'' #12 (November 1995)</ref>

In ''Green Lantern'' Annual vol. 3 #7, [[Kyle Rayner]] encounters Nekron. During the issue, Nekron nearly reenters the living universe when the level of supernatural activity mysteriously increases. This increase gave Nekron the opportunity to briefly control every deceased member of the Green Lantern Corps, which act as both his army and his anchor to the living universe. Kyle was able to push Nekron back into his dimension by freeing the undead Lanterns from Nekron's control. The rift is eventually sealed following Nekron's defeat.<ref name="gla7">''Green Lantern Annual'' vol. 3 #7 (1998)</ref>

Nekron also encounters [[Wonder Woman]] and Rebecca Carstairs ([[Witchfire (DC Comics)|Witchfire]]) in ''Power Company: Witchfire'' #1.<ref>''Power Company: Witchfire'' #1 (March 2002)</ref>

===Blackest Night===
In the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' event, Nekron is revealed to be responsible for the creation of the [[Power ring (DC Comics)#Black|black power rings]], which reanimate the dead, and in collaboration with [[Scar (comics)|Scar]] and [[Black Hand (comics)|Black Hand]]. When the Black Lanterns' power levels reach one hundred percent, he rises from the Earth, just outside of [[Coast City]].<ref name="mastermind">{{cite web|url=http://uk.comics.ign.com/articles/101/1013816p1.html|title=Blackest Night's Mastermind Revealed|last=George|first=Richard|date=2009-08-13|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2009-08-14}}</ref><ref>''Blackest Night'' #4(December 2009)</ref> Nekron is also revealed, in a partial [[retcon]] of a previous [[Teen Titans]] storyline, to be the true mastermind behind the [[comic book death|miraculous resurrections]] of several superheroes in the past (a deed previously thought to be a consequence of [[Brother Blood]] tampering with the forces of life and death<ref>''[[Teen Titans]]'' #31 (2006)</ref>). By "allowing" the dead heroes to be reborn he grants himself a small cadre of "inside agents", so, by briefly resurrecting [[Batman]] as an emotional tether, he is able to make black rings  that latch on to [[Superman]], [[Wonder Woman]], [[Donna Troy]], [[Bart Allen|Kid Flash]], [[Animal Man]], [[Ice (comics)|Ice]], [[Green Arrow]] and [[Kon-El|Superboy]], transforming them all into Black Lanterns. [[Hal Jordan]] and [[Barry Allen]] are similarly targeted <ref>''Blackest Night'' #5 (2010)</ref>

According to Black Lantern [[Jean Loring]], when the Guardians first harness the [[Emotional spectrum]], Nekron is formed out of the nothingness in existence prior to the creation of the universe as its defense mechanism.<ref> ''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #49 (2010)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The limitations of Nekron's powers are unknown. [[Geoff Johns]] has described him as perhaps the most powerful dark force in the DC Universe. He has displayed the ability to raise the dead, kill with a touch, fire bolts of black lightning and grow without limit.<ref>''Tales of the Green Lantern Corps'' vol. 1 #3 (July 1981)</ref><ref>''Green Lantern Annual'' vol. 3 #7 (1998)</ref>
