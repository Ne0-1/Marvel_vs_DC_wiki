'''Nekron, Lord of the Unliving''' is a [[fictional character]], an extra-dimensional villain in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]]. Ruler of the dimension where the souls of the dead in the [[DC universe]] await their passage into their final residences, Nekron draws his power from the souls and spirits of all who have ever died.

==Fictional character biography==
When [[Krona (comics)|Krona]]'s banished energy form, somehow reached Nekronâ€™s demension, due to a paradox of an immortal now being in the Realm of the Dead, a rift opened between the dimensions, which allowed Nekron to see the universe of the living. Desiring it, but being too large to pass through the gap, Nekron instead recreated Krona as an undead being of enormous power. Given an army of similarly-restored spirits, Nekron sent Krona to kill the [[Guardians of the Universe]], so the rift would open more. Krona accepted because part of Nekron's plan involved collapsing the universe so as to recreate it according to his own desires, which would give Krona the chance to see a universe being born. 

Krona and his minions succeeded in killing some Guardians as well as several [[Green Lantern]]s while destroying the central power battery to preclude the Lanterns recharging their power rings. Although his subsequent attack was powerful enough to shatter the morale of the [[Green Lantern Corps]], [[Hal Jordan]] managed to inspire and rally his fellows to attack Krona with their remaining time of their rings' charge. He was defeated when Jordan entered the realm of the dead and incited the spirits of the recently-killed Lanterns to rebel against Nekron. This gave the Guardians enough time to banish Krona into the dead realm and close the rift with Jordan still trapped inside. The spirit of Jordan's predecessor, [[Abin Sur]], helped his successor escape the realm.

Nekron has later encountered [[Captain Atom]], [[Wonder Woman]], [[Witchfire (DC Comics)|Witchfire]], and [[Kyle Rayner]].
