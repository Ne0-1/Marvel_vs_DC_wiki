'''Nekron''' is a [[comic book]] supervillain appearing in books published by [[DC Comics]], specifically those related to [[Green Lantern]]. Created by [[Mike W. Barr]], [[Len Wein]] and [[Joe Staton]], the character, who exists as an embodiment of [[Death (personification)|Death]], first appeared in ''[[Green Lantern|Tales of the Green Lantern Corps]]'' (vol. 1) #2 (June 1981). He is the primary antagonist in the "[[Blackest Night]]" storyline that was published in 2009 and 2010.

==Publication history==
===Origins===
[[Image:Nekron.PNG|thumb|160px|left|Nekron, as he first appeared in ''Tales of the Green Lantern Corps'' #2. Art by [[Joe Staton]].]]
Nekron is a fictional embodiment of [[Death (personification)|Death]] and ruler of a region adjoining [[Hell (DC Comics)|Hell]] that also seems to border on [[Limbo (DC Comics)|Limbo]] and [[Purgatory]] within the [[DC Universe]]. It is where the souls of the dead await passage to their final residence in either the [[Silver City (comics)|Silver City]] or Hell. Nekron draws his power from the souls and spirits of all those who have ever died.<ref name="tglc1">''Tales of the Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 1) #2 (June 1981)</ref>

After the Oan scientist [[Krona (comics)|Krona]] was sentenced to banishment as pure energy, that energy somehow reached Nekron's realm; a rift opens between the dimensions due to the paradox of an immortal now being in the Realm of the Dead. Desiring the living world he is now able to see, but being too large to pass through the rift, Nekron recreates Krona as an undead being of enormous power instead. Given an army of similarly-restored spirits, Nekron sends Krona to kill the [[Guardians of the Universe]] in order to increase the size of the rift. Krona cooperates because part of Nekron's plan involves collapsing the universe so as to recreate it according to his own desires (which would give Krona the chance to see a universe being born). Krona and his minions kill several Guardians and [[Green Lantern]]s while destroying the Central Power Battery to prevent the Lanterns from recharging their power rings. Although his attack is powerful enough to shatter the morale of the [[Green Lantern Corps]], [[Hal Jordan]] manages to inspire and rally his fellow Lanterns into attacking Krona with the charge still left in their rings. Nekron is defeated when Jordan enters the realm of the dead and incites the spirits of the recently-killed Lanterns to rebel against him. This gives the Guardians enough time to banish Krona into the dead realm and close the rift with Jordan still trapped inside. The spirit of Jordan's predecessor, [[Abin Sur]], helps him escape the realm.<ref name="glc3">''Tales of The Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 1) #3 (July 1981)</ref>

===1990 - 2002===
[[Captain Atom]] has a run-in with Nekron in which he is described as "Death as the Ultimate Opponent". [[Black Racer (DC Comics)|Black Racer]], also making an appearance, is coined "Death as an Inevitability", while [[Death (DC Comics)|Death]] (prominently known from her appearances in [[Vertigo Comics|Vertigo]] titles) represents "Death as the Release, as Mercy, as Compassion." Drawing into the Quantum field, Captain Atom is able to get the better of Nekron and is able to visit his deceased wife.<ref name="cp42-43">''Captain Atom'' (vol. 1) #42-43 (Juneâ€“July 1990)</ref>

Nekron later battles the demon [[Nebiros]], following the destruction of [[Doctor Fate]]'s Tower Of Fate. Also appearing in this issue is Jared Stevens (Fate).<ref>''Fate'' #12 (November 1995)</ref>

[[Kyle Rayner]] later encounters Nekron when he nearly reenters the living universe when the level of supernatural activity mysteriously increases. This increase gave Nekron the opportunity to briefly control every deceased member of the Green Lantern Corps, which act as both his army and his anchor to the living universe. Kyle was able to push Nekron back into his dimension by freeing the undead Lanterns from Nekron's control. The rift is eventually sealed following Nekron's defeat.<ref name="gla7">''Green Lantern Annual'' (vol. 3) #7 (1998)</ref>

Nekron also encounters [[Wonder Woman]] and Rebecca Carstairs ([[Witchfire (DC Comics)|Witchfire]]).<ref>''Power Company: Witchfire'' #1 (March 2002)</ref>

==="Blackest Night"===
In the "[[Blackest Night]]" storyline, Nekron is revealed to be responsible for the creation of the [[Power ring (DC Comics)#Black|black power rings]], which reanimate the dead, and is collaborating with [[Scar (comics)|Scar]] and [[Black Hand (comics)|Black Hand]]. He's also responsible for the imprisonment of the [[Anti-Monitor]] during the aftermath of the ''[[Sinestro Corps War]]'' on the planet Ryut. When the Black Lanterns' power levels reach one hundred percent, he rises from the Earth, just outside of [[Coast City]].<ref name="mastermind">{{cite web|url=http://uk.comics.ign.com/articles/101/1013816p1.html|title=Blackest Night's Mastermind Revealed|last=George|first=Richard|date=2009-08-13|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2009-08-14}}</ref><ref>''Blackest Night'' #4 (December 2009)</ref> Nekron is also revealed to be the true mastermind behind the [[comic book death|miraculous resurrections]] of several superheroes in the past (a deed previously thought to be a consequence of [[Brother Blood]] tampering with the forces of life and death).<ref>''[[Teen Titans]]'' #31 (2006)</ref> By "allowing" the dead heroes to be reborn he grants himself a small cadre of "inside agents"; by briefly reanimating [[Batman]]'s clone (created by [[Darkseid]] during ''[[Final Crisis]]'' and implied that the dark lord's awareness of the remains is not authentic) as an emotional tether to stimulate a powerful enough emotional response, Nekron is able to create black rings that latch on to [[Superman]], [[Wonder Woman]], [[Donna Troy]], [[Bart Allen|Kid Flash]], [[Animal Man]], [[Ice (comics)|Ice]], [[Green Arrow]] and [[Kon-El|Superboy]], transforming them all into Black Lanterns; [[Hal Jordan]] and [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] are similarly targeted, but evade sharing their comrades' fates thanks to Barry taking himself and Hal two seconds into the future and causing their would-be rings to shut down.<ref name="bn5">''Blackest Night'' #5 (November 2009)</ref><ref name="bn6">''Blackest Night'' #6 (December 2009)</ref>

According to Black Lantern [[Jean Loring]], when the Guardians first harnessed the [[Emotional spectrum]], Nekron was formed out of the nothingness in existence prior to the creation of the universe as a defense mechanism, the Guardian of Darkness.<ref name="bn5"/><ref name="bn6"/> Given shape in the form of life's idea of death, Nekron marches with his undead army, claiming the hunger plaguing him has not abated.<ref name="bn6"/> Nekron is not a living being but just exists as an avatar of darkness from the beginning of the universe. This makes Nekron immune to the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]]'s divine wrath, as he has no soul to judge.<ref>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #51 (February 2010)</ref>

Nekron begins to reveal the full extent of his plan. Nekron and his Black Lanterns bring the subdued Guardians to a clearing where the same [[Brightest Day|symbol]] that was seen on [[Professor Zoom]]'s chest is drawn in what appears to be blood. After questioning one of the Guardians and getting him to admit that he can no longer remember why the Guardians took a vow to protect the universe, Nekron slits his throat and Black Hand removes his organs and places them in the center of the symbol.  After crushing the organs with his scythe, Nekron calls forth The Entity. The Entity is the white light given physical form. When Nekron strikes the Entity every living thing in the universe cries out in pain, this is because the Entity is what gave birth to life and all living things came from it. Nekron intends to kill the Entity and thereby kill every living thing in the universe. His plans, however, are thwarted when [[Sinestro]] bonds with the Entity becoming a White Lantern.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #7 (February 2010)</ref> 

Another failure comes when the massed Corps above Earth reach Xanshi's core through its surface faults, and manage to destroy the thousands of rings holding it together. As Xanshi collapses, Nekron cries out in pain. While he also manages to nearly hack Sinestro in half with his scythe, he fails to kill him, and the White Lantern rises again, healing his wounds and promising retribution to Nekron.<ref>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #52 (March 2010)</ref>

In the battle that follows, the Life Entity eventually abandons Sinestro, refusing to be controlled by his ego, and bonds itself to Hal Jordan, who states that Nekron merely opened the doors between life and death while it was still the heroes' choices to return to life. Hal turns the power of The Entity on Black Hand ([[Deadman]] having discovered that Black Hand functions as Nekron's link to the living world), causing Black Hand to return to life and vomiting one white power ring that enters the Black Power Battery and resurrects the Anti-Monitor (destroying the Power Battery in the process), who immediately attacks Nekron. Nekron then returns the Anti-Monitor to the Anti-Matter universe. Twelve other white rings are then released by Black Hand and seek out several deceased heroes and villains who had been recruited into the Black Lantern Corps and turns them into White Lanterns instead. In the final confrontation that follows, Nekron is banished yet again, with Hal Jordan and [[Barry Allen]] speculating that death will now be more permanent with Nekron's plan having failed.<ref name="bn8">''Blackest Night''#8 (March 2010)</ref>

==="Brightest Day"===
At the conclusion of the miniseries "[[Brightest Day]]", [[Swamp Thing]] appears, grown to towering size and emerging from the forest at the former heart of Star City, which has become corrupted. The White Lantern Entity explains that just as the memories of Alec Holland acted as a template for the Earth Elemental, the personality of Nekron has been imprinted over it. The corrupted Swamp Thing does battle with Alec Holland (having been resurrected and turned into the new Swamp Thing by the White Lantern Entity),  who is aided by embodiments of the four elements (Hawkman, Hawkwoman, Firestorm, Aquaman and the Martian Manhunter) and is defeated, driving out the influence of Nekron once again.

==Powers and abilities==
The limitations of Nekron's powers are unknown. [[Geoff Johns]] has described him as the most powerful dark force in the DC Universe. He has displayed the ability to raise the dead, kill (even Guardians) with a touch, fire bolts of black lightning and grow without limit.<ref name="glc3"/><ref name="gla7"/> He is also capable of fighting against universal forces like the Life Entity, who was bonded with Sinestro.  Nekron also has incredible durability and [[reality warping]] powers, as he was able to withstand a blast from the Anti-Monitor and send him back to the anti-matter universe.<ref name="bn8"/>

==Other versions==
In the alternate timeline of the 2011 "[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]" storyline, it is revealed that Nekron was unleashed into the Universe when [[Atrocitus]] killed [[Black Hand (comics)|William Hand]]. Where Nekron and his Black Lanterns waged war is left unknown. All that is known is that the [[Guardians of the Universe]] tasked [[Abin Sur]] the mission to travel to Earth and recover the [[White Lantern Corps|White Entity]] and bring it to [[Oa]].<ref>''Flastpoint: Abin Sur - The Green Lantern'' #1 (June 2011)</ref>
