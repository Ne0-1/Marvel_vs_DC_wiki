The '''Skrull Kill Krew''' were a short-lived fictional group from [[Marvel Comics]] with their own [[limited series]] published in 1995 and collected in one volume in 2006. The characters were created by [[Grant Morrison]], [[Mark Millar]] and [[Steve Yeowell]], based on events and persons created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

==Plot==

{{spoilers}}

The [[Fantastic Four]], at the beginning of their superhero career (in ''FF''#2) defeated a group of [[Skrull]] spies and brainwashed them into becoming [[cow]]s, and retaining that form for life. Though the Skrull-cows at one point had regained their memories, and one was killed, the other three were turned over to the [[U.S. government]] and restored to cows in shape and mind.

They were then (apparently by accident) shipped to a [[slaughterhouse]] and butchered as [[beef]]. Some of the meat eaten by people transferred the Skrull's adaptable [[DNA]] code into the human's cells, resulting in a bizarre condition called ''Skrullovoria Induced Skrullophobia'', in which these individuals not only gained [[shape-shifting]] powers equal to, or greater than, actual Skrulls, but also developed an intense fear or hatred of Skrulls. Only a small number of humans proved susceptible to this syndrome, and most did not survive the initial stages of infection. But several people who proved somewhat longer-lived (though still dying) were gathered together by a man known only as Ryder, who was himself a victim of the disease, to act out their increasingly irrational impulses to seek out and destroy the ones who did this to them (by "letting" themselves get turned into cows), usually by graphically "blowing away" the Skrulls with high-powered weapons.

==Membership==

'''Ryder''' - Leader and founder. In addition to shapeshifting, he can [[teleport]], has enhanced strength and reflexes, and carries lots of [[firearms]]. He prefers to animate his hair into snakelike  [[tentacles]].

'''Catwalk''' - Former fashion model who transforms into a [[felidae|feline]] humanoid form. In this shape she has enhanced athletic abilities, with claws and fangs.

'''Dice''' - Former surfer. He can breathe underwater and transform his limbs into weapons which project explosive blasts.

'''Riot''' - [[Punk Rock]]er. Turns into an armored insectoid form that resembles a [[Xenomorph (Alien)|Xenomorph]] from the film [[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]. In this form she has great strength and sharp spines.

'''Moonstomp''' - British [[Nazi-Skinheads|Neo-Nazi skinhead]]. Hates Skrulls so much that he's willing to work with Ryder (a black man) even though he feels like he's compromising his "values" in doing so. He has some shapeshifting powers, but prefers to bash his foes with a normal claw [[hammer]]. During the series, his degenerative condition worsens, causing him to develop patches of dark skin, which displeases him immensely.

==Trivia==
''Note:'' The concept of DNA from the Skrullcows turning people into shape-shifters had been previously explored in a ''Fantastic Four'' arc, in which the population of King's Crossing, a small [[dairy]] town, were affected by ''milk'' from the cows. (''FF Annual #17'')
