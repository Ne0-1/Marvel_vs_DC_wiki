The '''Skrull Kill Krew''' are a fictional group from [[Marvel Comics]] with their own series published in [[1995 in comics|1995]] and collected in one [[trade paperback (comics)|volume]] in [[2006 in comics|2006]].

The characters were created by [[Grant Morrison]], [[Mark Millar]] and [[Steve Yeowell]].

==Publication history==
The team first appeared in their own [[eponym]]ous series written by [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Mark Millar]], with art by [[Steve Yeowell]], published in 1995. The series was originally announced as an ongoing series.  For unspecified reasons, it was changed around issue #2 to be a mini-series, ending with issue #5.

They then made an appearance in ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #16 as part of the [[Secret Invasion]] tie-in and writer [[Dan Slott]] announced at the 2008 [[Baltimore Comic-Con]] that they would be getting a new mini-series featuring the new line-up.<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=18245 Baltimore: Cup of B Panel], [[Comic Book Resources]], September 27, 2008</ref>

==Fictional team biography==

The [[Fantastic Four]], at the beginning of their superhero career<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #2</ref> defeated a group of [[Skrull]] spies. Reed Richards brainwashed them into becoming [[cow]]s and retaining that form for life. The Skrull-cows at one point regained their memories<ref>''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #89-97</ref> leading to the death of one of them. The other three were turned over to the [[U.S. government]] and restored to cows in shape and mind.

The milk from these cows affected a small dairy town named King's Crossing. The Fantastic Four, via a girl Johnny Storm was dating, ended up investigating the town and neutralizing the threat.<ref>''Fantastic Four Annual'' #17</ref>

They were then (apparently by accident) shipped to a [[slaughterhouse]] and butchered as [[beef]]. Some of the meat eaten by people transferred the Skrull's adaptable [[DNA]] code into the human's cells, resulting in a bizarre condition called ''Skrullovoria Induced Skrullophobia'', in which these individuals not only gained [[shape-shifting]] powers equal to, or greater than, actual Skrulls, but also developed an intense fear or hatred of Skrulls. Only a small number of humans proved susceptible to this syndrome, and most did not survive the initial stages of infection. But several people who proved somewhat longer-lived (though still dying) were gathered together by a man known only as Ryder, who was himself a victim of the disease, to act out their increasingly irrational impulses to seek out and destroy the ones who did this to them (by "letting" themselves get turned into cows), usually by graphically "blowing away" the Skrulls with high-powered weapons.

Their desire to kill Skrulls not only stopped many plots which endangered humans, it also led them to fight other well known Marvel characters, such as [[Baron Von Strucker]] and [[Captain America]].

===Secret Invasion===
{{main|Secret Invasion}}
Ryder and Riot return to ferret out more Skrulls. The other three are still alive, their heads kept in jars, their Skull infestation has resulted in the loss of their bodies. <ref>Avengers: The Initiative #18</ref> They encounter the new [[Delroy Garrett|3-D Man]] in the New Mexico desert and save him from a Skrull posing as [[Sharon Ventura|'She-Thing']]. 3-D Man joins them in rooting out Blacksmith of the [[Desert Stars]], another Skrull, and killing him as well.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #16</ref> They were next seen helping [[Nevada]]'s [[Fifty State Initiative]] team, The [[Heavy Hitters (comics)|Heavy Hitters]] deal with a Skrull posing as an unnamed team member.<ref>''Avengers: the Initiative'' #17</ref>

They found out that in every Initiative state team is one Skrull-imposter and decided to kill them all. Komodo and her lover Hardball both join the team as well. 

The Skrull Kill Crew thought they would not be able to track Skrulls through all the states on time, but then former Avenger [[Jocasta (comics)|Jocasta]] appeared with [[Devil-Slayer (comics)|Devil-Slayer]], who is a member of the Hawaiian [[Avengers: The Initiative|Initiative]] team, the Point Men. Devil-Slayer has teleportation powers, thus allowing the group to speed up their plans.

Later Ryder reveals to still have the heads of Moonstomp, Dice and Catwalk, who can also track down Skrulls. He give the 3 heads to speedsters Whiz Kid, Spinner and Non-Stop. The team splits up in 6 different squads, for each to search for the 6 remaining Skrull sleeper agents within The Initiative teams.

==Membership==
===Current===

*'''Ryder''' - Leader and founder. In addition to shapeshifting, he can [[teleport]], has enhanced strength and reflexes, and carries lots of [[firearms]]. He prefers to animate his hair into snakelike  [[tentacles]].

*'''Riot''' - [[Punk rock]]er. Turns into an armored insectoid form. In this form she has great strength and sharp spines. Now stuck in that form.

*'''[[Delroy Garrett|3-D Man]]''' - [[Delroy Garrett]], [[African American]] who inherited his powers from the original [[3-D Man]], a 1950s anti-Skrull hero. Able to recognise Skrulls with his special goggles.

===Former===

*'''Catwalk''' - Former fashion model who transforms into a [[felidae|feline]] humanoid form. In this shape she has enhanced athletic abilities, with claws and fangs. 

*'''Dice''' - Former surfer. He can breathe underwater and transform his limbs into weapons which project explosive blasts. 

*'''Moonstomp''' - British [[Nazi-Skinheads|Neo-Nazi skinhead]]. Hates Skrulls so much that he's willing to work with Ryder (a black man) even though he feels like he's compromising his values in doing so. He has some shapeshifting powers, but prefers to bash his foes with a normal claw [[hammer]]. During the series, his degenerative condition worsens, causing him to develop patches of dark skin, which displeases him immensely. 

All three are considered as incapacitated as they are confined to living heads in a jar.
