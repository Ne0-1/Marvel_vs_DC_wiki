The '''Blood Brothers''' are [[fictional]] [[Character (arts)|characters]] that appear in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. They first appeared in ''[[Iron Man]]'' #55 (Feb. 1973) and were created by [[Jim Starlin]] and [[Mike Friedrich]].

==Publication history==
Following their debut, the Blood Brothers returned in a Starlin/Friedrich story in ''[[Marvel Feature]]'' #12 (Nov. 1973), again fighting the [[superhero]] Iron Man, here teamed with [[Fantastic Four]] member [[Thing (comics)|The Thing]]. The Blood Brothers continued as Iron Man antagonists in ''[[Iron Man]]'' #89-91 (Aug.-Oct. 1976), then disappeared from publication for several years before resurfacing to battle the titular superhero team in ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' #252-253 (Jan.-Feb. 1990). Following appearances in ''[[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]]'' #12 (July 1990), and ''[[X-Men]]'' vol. 2, #107 (Dec. 2000), they temporarily switched alliances to aid Earth's superheroes against a common threat in the three-issue miniseries ''Maximum Security'' (Dec. 2000 - Jan. 2001; first two issues released same month). They were next seen as interplanetary prison-escapees on Earth in the four-issue miniseries ''[[Drax the Destroyer]]'' #1-4 (Nov. 2005 - Feb. 2006), where one Blood Brother died.
    
They are unrelated to the high-tech [[motorcycle]] gang the "Blood Brothers", seen in ''[[Machine Man|X-51]]'' #10-12 (Mayâ€“July 2000).

==Powers and abilities==
Each Blood Brother's tremendous strength and durability is dependent on his proximity to his twin. When standing together, the two have a high degree of superhuman strength, but if separated weaken to below even normal human levels. The Brothers also drain the blood of victims in the manner of a [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampire]], although it is unclear as to whether they totally rely on blood for sustenance.

==In other media==
===Television===
* The Blood Brothers appear in the ''[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|Avengers Assemble]]'' episode "Hulked Out Heroes", voiced by [[David Kaye]] and [[Liam O'Brien]]. They ambush Hulk at the top of Stark Tower until Captain America, Falcon, Hawkeye, and Iron Man arrive. When the Blood Brothers have Hulk pinned down, they attach a device to Hulk's back that siphons Hulk's gamma energy which caused some of the Avengers to be infected with an unstable gamma energy virus. The Blood Brothers contact Red Skull to tell them that their mission was a success. Red Skull cuts off the call from the Blood Brothers when they start to ask about their payment.
