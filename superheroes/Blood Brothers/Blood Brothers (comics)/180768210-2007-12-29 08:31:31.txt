The '''Blood Brothers''' are [[fictional]] [[extraterrestrial]] characters that appear in the [[Marvel Universe]]. They first appeared in ''[[Iron Man]]'' #55 (Feb. 1973) and were created by [[Jim Starlin]] and [[Mike Friedrich]].

==Publication history== 
Following their debut, the Blood Brothers returned in a Starlin/Friedrich story in ''[[Marvel Feature]]'' #12 (Nov. 1973), again fighting the [[superhero]] Iron Man, here teamed with [[Fantastic Four]] member [[Thing (comics)|The Thing]]. The Blood Brothers continued as Iron Man antagonists in ''[[Iron Man]]'' #89-91 (Aug.-Oct. 1976), then disappeared from publication for several years before resurfacing to battle the titular superhero team in ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' #252-253 (Jan.-Feb. 1990). Following appearances in ''[[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]]'' #12 (July 1990), and ''[[X-Men]]'' vol. 2, #107 (Dec. 2000), they temporarily switched alliances to aid Earth's superheroes against a common threat in the three-issue miniseries ''Maximum Security'' (Dec. 2000 - Jan. 2001; first two issues released same month). They were next seen as interplanetary prison-escapees on Earth in the four-issue miniseries ''[[Drax the Destroyer]]'' #1-4 (Nov. 2005 - Feb. 2006), where one Blood Brother died.   
    
The pair have no relation to the high-tech [[motorcycle]] gang the "Blood Brothers", seen in ''[[Machine Man|X-51]]'' #10-12 (May-July 2000).

==Fictional character biography== 
The Blood Brothers are large twin ape-like aliens originally in the service of the Titan [[Thanos]], acting as the guardians of his first base on Earth. <ref>''Iron Man'' #55 (Feb. 1973)</ref> Pursued by [[Drax the Destroyer]], the duo battle the superheroes [[Iron Man]] and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] in a bid to stop them from interfering in Thanos' plans. When they fail to do so, Thanos teleports the Blood Brothers away to an unrevealed location. <ref>''Marvel Feature'' #12 (Nov. 1973)</ref>

They reappear years later in the service of the villain the [[Controller (Marvel Comics)|Controller]], and battle Iron Man once more. Iron Man defeats them both with the aid of the hero [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]. <ref>''Iron Man'' #89-90 (Aug. - Sept. 1976)</ref> Sometime later, the United States military discovers Thanos' old Earth base in [[Arizona]], and after activating some of the machinery accidentally teleport in the Blood Brothers. The two battle the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and are eventually depowered by Thanos' brother, [[Starfox (comics)|Eros]]. <ref>''The Avengers'' #252 (Jan. 1990)</ref>

The Blood Brothers are imprisoned, but are later released by the hero [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]] and left on the planet Mars. <ref>''Quasar'' #12 (Jul 1990)</ref> They later attempt to stop [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] of the [[X-Men]] from rescuing a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] extraterrestrial of the [[Skrull]] race. <ref>''X-Men'' #107 (Dec. 2000)</ref> The brothers later fight alongside Earth's metahumans against an invasion by [[Ego the Living Planet]], but are later imprisoned with alien criminals [[Paibok|Paibok the Power Skrull]] and [[Lunatik]]. <ref>''Maximum Security'' (Dec. 2000 - Jan. 2001)</ref> The pair eventually escape and crash-land on Earth, where one brother is killed in a confrontation with Drax the Destroyer. <ref>''Drax the Destroyer'' #1-4 (Nov. 2005 - Feb. 2006)</ref>

== Powers and abilities ==
Each Blood Brother's tremendous strength and durability is dependent on his proximity to his twin. When standing together, the two have a high degree of superhuman strength, but if separated weaken to below even normal human levels. The Brothers also drain the blood of victims in the manner of a [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampire]], although it is unclear as to whether they totally rely on blood for sustenance.
