'''Karima Shapandar''' is the name of a [[fictional character]] associated with the [[X-Men]] spinoff [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]. She first appeared in ''X-Men Unlimited'' #27 and was created by Chris Claremont and Brett Booth.

==Biography==

Karima was a police officer from [[India]] who was transformed into an '''[[Prime Sentinels|Omega Prime Sentinel]]''' by Bastion of the '''Operation: Zero Tolerance''' program. 

===Neal Shaara===

It all started when Karima was dispatched to look after '''Neal Shaara''' (who would later become known as [[Thunderbird (comics)|Thunderbird]]). Neal was looking for his brother, Sanjit, who had gone missing researching some mysterious disappearances in [[Calcutta]]. A bond quickly developed between the two, and they were on the verge of beginning a romantic relationship when they were attacked and captured by Bastion.  Neal learned that Sanjit had become a Prime Sentinel, programmed to seek out and destroy mutants. Bastion intended to do the same to Neal and Karima, but the morphing process catalyzed Neal’s latent mutant power, which destroyed the building around him.  Sanjit fought his programming long enough to disable the other Sentinels, but died in the process. 

As Neal cradled Sanjit’s body, Karima quietly told Neal to run. She had discovered that she was a Prime Sentinel; humans transformed into sentinels and set up as 'sleeper' agents, unaware of their programming until a nearby mutant activated them (as in Neal's usage of his mutant powers). 
:''"I am an Omega Prime. Within moments I will have reached my full combat mode–with my core programming to destroy creatures like you. It is becoming increasingly difficult to even think of you as human.  Your only chance is to disappear. Get as far away from India – and from me – as you can.  Assume a new identity... a new life."''

Neal refused, saying he loved Karima.  Karima begged him to leave, saying she couldn't hold on much longer. Neal was forced to flee. 

===Genosha===

Karima later resurfaced on the decimated mutant homeland of [[Genosha]], where she encountered [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] and [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. The two were able to disable her sentinel programming and restore her mind, but the technological modifications to her body remained.

Karima is currently staying on the island, working as a police officer to restore order. She is trying to adjust to her new form, which comes into conflicts with her [[Hinduism|Hindu]] beliefs.

==Trivia==

When asked what he liked about the character, creator Chris Claremont responded "I liked the idea of her. The notion... of someone being transformed into a wholly mechanical being and what effects that has on sense of self, sense of soul? She’s an outcast from both human and mutant society, yet bound by her own personal sense of honor to try to protect both. [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]]’s (another character in the ''Excalibur'' series) one kind of 'monster,' Karima’s another. They both have their measure of prejudice to overcome."
