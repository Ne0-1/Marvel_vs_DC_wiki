'''Karima Shapandar''', codenamed '''Omega Sentinel''', is a [[fictional character]] associated with the [[X-Men]] and its spinoff [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]. She first appeared in ''X-Men Unlimited'' #27 and was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Brett Booth]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Prime Sentinel===
Shapandar was a police officer from [[India]] who was transformed into an '''[[Prime Sentinel|Omega Prime Sentinel]]''' by [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]] of the '''Operation: Zero Tolerance''' program. It all started when Karima was dispatched to look after '''Neal Shaara''' (who would later become known as [[Neal Shaara|Thunderbird]]). Neal was looking for his brother, Sanjit, who had gone missing while researching some mysterious disappearances in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]]. A bond quickly developed between the two, and they were on the verge of beginning a romantic relationship when they were attacked and captured by Bastion.  Neal learned that Sanjit had become a Prime Sentinel, programmed to seek out and destroy mutants. Bastion intended to do the same to Neal and Karima, but the morphing process catalyzed Neal’s latent mutant power, which destroyed the building around him. Sanjit fought his programming long enough to disable the other Sentinels, but died in the process. 

As Neal cradled Sanjit’s body, Shapandar quietly told Neal to run. She had discovered that she was a Prime Sentinel; humans transformed into sentinels and set up as 'sleeper' agents, unaware of their programming until a nearby mutant activated them (as in Neal's usage of his mutant powers). 
{{cquote|"I am an Omega Prime. Within moments I will have reached my full combat mode–with my core programming to destroy creatures like you. It is becoming increasingly difficult to even think of you as human.  Your only chance is to disappear. Get as far away from India – and from me – as you can.  Assume a new identity... a new life."}}

Neal refused, saying he loved Karima.  Karima begged him to leave, saying she couldn't hold on much longer. Neal was forced to flee.

===Genoshan Excalibur===
Karima later resurfaces on the decimated island of [[Genosha]], where she encounters [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] and [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. The two were able to disable her Sentinel programming and restore her mind, but the technological modifications to her body remained.

Karima stayed on the island with the others, working as a police officer to restore order. She is trying to adjust to her new form, which comes into conflicts with her [[Hinduism|Hindu]] beliefs. It is assumed she left the island with most of the other residents after [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]].

===Joining the X-Men===
The X-Men recently discovered a disassembled Karima, along with [[Lady Mastermind]] in a lab of the Fordyce Clinic that was testing on mutants to see if someone can catch mutation like a disease. [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] has reassembled her,<ref>''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #189</ref> but she appears to have lost part of her memory from the moment she got disassembled. [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] officially recruited her onto the team to help fight the [[Children of the Vault]].<ref>''X-Men'' (vol. 2) #192</ref>

Since then she was able to help fix a teleporter in the search to find Pandemic, helping in the fight to defeat him. After Rogue was infected with a virus by Pandemic and Cable took the team to his island so Rogue could be cared for. On the island, Karima helped the team and the island residents who were attacked by the Hecatomb.

===Marauders===
Omega Sentinel is possessed by [[Malice (comics)|Malice]], who is now a digital entity instead of a psionic one, via email virus; thus, she unwillingly ends up joining the new [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]] in ''X-Men'' #200. Whether being part machine and part human will allow her to overcome Malice's influence has yet to be seen. The other X-Men, save [[Emma Frost]], were unaware of her being possessed until they were attacked by her along with the rest of the new Marauders, including Mystique and Lady Mastermind.

==Powers and abilities==
Karima is fitted with Omega-Prime Sentinel nanite technology which gives her superhuman strength, speed, reflexes, and endurance. She also has flight capacity, regeneration to repair any physical injury/damage she receives, and several projectile weapons, including high energy power blasts, as well as electrostatic poles built into her forearms that generate massive amounts of electrical energy. Her strength and durability were enhanced after she was rebuilt by the Beast. She appears to show limited technopathy and machine control, due to being able to "find" information from machines, and having the ability to control nanites in others' blood.

Before she was a detective in India, she is trained in basic combat skills, identity tracking, and other basic skills that come with being a human detective. She also possesses knowledge on how to work most basic and highly Earth-based advanced technology.

==Other versions==
===House of M===
She appears in the House of M still as an Omega Sentinel but as the leader of the Sentinel Police for the House of Magnus.
