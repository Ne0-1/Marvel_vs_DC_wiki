'''Omega Sentinel''' ('''Karima Shapandar''') is a [[fiction]]al [[character (arts)|character]] associated with the [[X-Men]] and its spinoff [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]. She first appeared in ''X-Men Unlimited,'' vol. 1 #27 (June 2000) and was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Brett Booth]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Prime Sentinel===
Shapandar was a police officer from [[India]] who was transformed into an [[Prime Sentinel|Omega Prime Sentinel]] by [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]] of the [[Operation: Zero Tolerance]] program. It all started when Karima was dispatched to look after [[Neal Shaara]] (who would later become known as Thunderbird). Neal was looking for his brother, Sanjit, who had gone missing while researching some mysterious disappearances in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]]. A bond quickly developed between the two, and they were on the verge of beginning a romantic relationship when they were attacked and captured by Bastion.  Neal learned that Sanjit had become a Prime Sentinel, programmed to seek out and destroy mutants. Bastion intended to do the same to Neal and Karima, but the morphing process catalyzed Neal’s latent mutant power, which destroyed the building around him. Sanjit fought his programming long enough to disable the other Sentinels, but died in the process. 

As Neal cradled Sanjit’s body, Shapandar quietly told Neal to run. She had discovered that she was a Prime Sentinel; humans transformed into sentinels and set up as 'sleeper' agents, unaware of their programming until a nearby mutant activated them (as in Neal's usage of his mutant powers). 
{{cquote|"I am an Omega Prime. Within moments I will have reached my full combat mode–with my core programming to destroy creatures like you. It is becoming increasingly difficult to even think of you as human.  Your only chance is to disappear. Get as far away from India – and from me – as you can.  Assume a new identity... a new life."}}

Neal refused, saying he loved Karima.  Karima begged him to leave, saying she couldn't hold on much longer. Neal was forced to flee.

===Genoshan Excalibur===
Karima later resurfaces on the decimated island of [[Genosha]], where she encounters [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] and [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. The two were able to disable her Sentinel programming and restore her mind, but the technological modifications to her body remained.

Karima stayed on the island with the others, working as a police officer to restore order. She is trying to adjust to her new form, which comes into conflicts with her [[Hinduism|Hindu]] beliefs. It is assumed she left the island with most of the other residents after [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]].

===Joining the X-Men===
The X-Men discovered a disassembled Karima, along with [[Lady Mastermind]] in a lab of the Fordyce Clinic that was testing on mutants to see if someone can catch mutation like a disease. [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] reassembled her,<ref>''X-Men,'' vol. 2 #189 (Sep. 2006)</ref> but she appears to have lost part of her memory from the moment she got disassembled. [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] officially recruited her onto the team to help fight the [[Children of the Vault]].<ref>''X-Men,'' vol. 2 #192 (Dec. 2006)</ref>

Since then she was able to help fix a teleporter in the search to find [[Pandemic (comics)|Pandemic]], helping in the fight to defeat him. After Rogue was infected with a virus by Pandemic, Cable took the team to [[Providence (comics)|his island]] so Rogue could be cared for. On the island, Karima helped the team and the island residents who were attacked by the Hecatomb.

===Marauders and Malice===
Omega Sentinel is possessed by [[Malice (comics)|Malice]], who is now a digital entity instead of a psionic one, via email virus; thus, she unwillingly ends up joining the new Marauders. The other [[X-Men]], save [[Emma Frost]], were unaware of her being possessed until they were attacked by her along with the rest of the new Marauders, including [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] and Lady Mastermind. She later fights alongside the other Marauders in Flint, Michigan, against [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] and [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]], as both sides try to obtain the [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Diaries of Destiny]].

===[[X-Men: Messiah Complex|Messiah Complex]]===
Along with fellow Marauders [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]], [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]], [[Prism (comics)|Prism]], [[Blockbuster (Marvel Comics)|Blockbuster]], Lady Mastermind, and [[Scalphunter (Marvel Comics)|Scalphunter]], Malice travels to Cooperstown, Alaska to find the baby but instead come across the [[Purifiers]] and they come to blows.

The next time she is seen, she is fighting Colossus along with [[Arclight (comics)|Arclight]], [[Joanna Cargill|Frenzy]], and [[Unuscione]]. She then teams up with [[Lady Mastermind]] in taking out [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] by throwing a disguised [[Scrambler (comics)|Scrambler]] at him. After he realizes the deception, she hits him with an energy blast. While asking him about how he wants to die, [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] teleports in and knocks her out along with Lady Mastermind.  

She recovers and joins Gambit, Sunfire, and [[Vertigo (Marvel Comics)|Vertigo]] when they confront [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] who is about to kill the baby. She seems to show a lot of affection towards the baby and finds it extraordinary that she isn’t scared at all when she picks her up.  She is present when Gambit delivers the baby to Mystique (in the guise of [[Mister Sinister]]) at the Marauders' base on Muir Isle and later battles the X-Men, X-Factor, and X-Force when they arrive to take the baby. During the final battle over the child, Omega Sentinel is stabbed and somehow incapacitated by [[Pixie (X-Men)|Pixie]]'s Soul Dagger.

===Divided We Stand===
After the events of Messiah Complex, Karima manages to recover being taken over by the digital Malice, but has no memory of the events that took place, apparently a side effect of being wounded with Pixie's Soul Dagger. All she knows is that some of her files have been infected or damaged by a virus and can no longer access them in case of reinfection. She is currently staying with the Acolytes and says the only reason she is there is because Professor Xavier was there for her when she was first turned into a Sentinel. 

After asking Magneto which of their philosophies was right, Karima helps Magneto to revive the Professor from his coma and defends him against [[Joanna Cargill]]'s murder attempt. Karima tries to stop Cargill by bombarding her with microwave radiation, but her physical invulnerability proves to be too much for her, and Cargill severely damages her. Magneto manages to stop Cargill from killing Xavier by firing a surgical laser into her eye when [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]] shows up and after trying to kill Magneto, engages the Professor in a fight on the astral plane.

When they finish their skirmish, Karima, Magneto, and Xavier leave the Acolytes and as Xavier parts with Karima and Magneto, he asks them not to follow him.

Later, Xavier returns to New Avalon and convinces Exodus to disband the Acolytes and find a new way to help mutantkind. While Exodus embarks on a personal pilgrimage to this effect, Karima, along with [[Amelia Voght]] and [[Random (comics)|Random]] decide to relocate to San Francisco.<ref name="XML#225">''X-Men: Legacy'' #225 (Aug. 2009)</ref>

Following Cable's death at the end of ''[[X-Men: Second Coming|Second Coming]],'' Karima can be seen attending the memorial service for Cable.<ref>''X-Men: Second Coming'' #2</ref>

===Fables of the Reconstruction===
To help deal with the damage to San Francisco done by Bastion and his forces, Cyclops puts together a team of X-Men including Karima to help with the damage. On the boat trip to the mainland, Karima reveals to [[Psylocke]] she has been experiencing some glitches as of late. Arriving at the worksite for a building, Karima is paired with [[Danger Room|Danger]] and told to help excavate the site. As the day goes on, Karima's glithes get worse, and while helping [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], she accidentally shoots him with a powerful laser. Deciding to sit out for a bit to check on her systems, her Sentinel technology begins to take over and begins identifying the threat levels of each of the X-Men present, much to her confusion. Suddenly, against her will, she flies towards [[Hellion]] and [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope Summers]] and begins attacking them. Assessing that Hope is the biggest threat present, she punches Hellion and tells Hope to run. When Hope questions Karima, she replies that it's too late before firing a laser blast at Hope.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #242 (Jan. 2011)</ref> She is later irrverisbly damaged (or at least her human side is) when Hellion unleashes a previously undiscovered talent of his telekinesis and overwhelms her defenses, striking a killing blow when her human side reasserts it self and she asks him to put her out of her misery to which he obliges.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #243 (Feb.2011)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
[[Image:HouseofMKarima.jpg|200px|left|thumb|House of M Karima (2005). {{deletable image-caption|Saturday, December 18, 2010|date=December 2010}}]]
Karima is fitted with Omega-Prime Sentinel nanite technology which gives her superhuman strength, speed, reflexes, and endurance.  She also has flight capacity, regeneration to repair any physical injury/damage she receives, and several projectile weapons, including high energy power blasts, as well as electrostatic poles built into her forearms that generate massive amounts of electrical energy and microwave radiation emitters.  Her strength and durability were enhanced after she was rebuilt by the Beast.  She appears to show limited technopathy and machine control, due to being able to "find" information from machines, and having the ability to control nanites in others' blood.  She also has life-support technology built into her systems as evidenced in ''X-Men: Legacy'' #208 (Apr. 2008).

Before she was a detective in India, she was trained in basic combat skills, identity tracking, and other basic skills that come with being a human detective.  She also possesses knowledge on how to work most basic and advanced Earth-based technology.

==Other versions==
===House of M===
She appears in the [[House of M]] still as an Omega Sentinel but as the leader of the Sentinel Police for the House of Magnus.

===X-Men: The End===
Karima briefly appears fighting alongside the other X-Men in outer space. Not much is known about her.
