==Publication history==
The Living Tribunal debuted in a storyline called "The Sands of Death" in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #157 - 163 (June - Dec. 1967), giving [[mysticism|mystic]] hero [[Doctor Strange]] a limited time to prove Earth is worth saving. Established as apparently the supreme power in the Marvel Universe, the character made several sporadic appearances over the years, including ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'' #32 (April 1982); ''[[Rom (comics)|Rom]]'' #41 (April 1983) and ''[[Secret Wars II]]'' #6 (Dec. 1985). The Living Tribunal revealed clues as to its true purpose and nature in ''[[Silver Surfer]]'' vol. 3, #31 (Dec. 1989).

After brief appearances in the role of observer in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' #16 (Sep. 1991) and ''[[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]]'' #26 (Sep. 1991), the character had a significant role in the [[limited series]] ''[[The Infinity Gauntlet|Infinity Gauntlet]]'' #1 - 6 (July - Dec. 1991) and ''[[Warlock and the Infinity Watch]]'' #1 (Feb. 1992). The Living Tribunal's role was eventually expanded on in ''[[She-Hulk]]'' vol. 2, #12 (Nov. 2006).

==Fictional character biography==
'''The Living Tribunal''' is a nearly [[omnipotence|omnipotent]] entity that oversees and maintains balance in the realities that constitute the Marvel Comics [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Multiverse]], including the [[Earth-616|mainstream universe]] and all [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]]s. He serves as a judge of these realities.

The character is first encountered by [[Doctor Strange]], announcing its intent to destroy Earth due to its potential for evil. After a series of trials Strange is able to convince the Living Tribunal that good also exists, and Earth is spared.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #157 - 163 (Jun. - Dec. 1967)</ref> The Tribunal reappears to the [[Galador]]ian spaceknight [[Rom (comics)|Rom]];<ref>''Rom'' #41 (April 1983)</ref> appears briefly with the rest of the cosmic hierarchy when in discussion with the entity the [[Beyonder (comics)|Beyonder]];<ref>''Secret Wars II'' #6 (Dec. 1985)</ref> and reveals to the former [[Herald of Galactus]] (the [[Silver Surfer]]) that its three faces represent "Equity" (hooded face), "Vengeance" (partially shrouded face), and "Necessity" (fully shrouded face).<ref name="Surfer31">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #31 (Dec. 1989)</ref> The fourth side of the Living Tribunal's head is a void, with the entity claiming that it could have represented the face of the [[Cosmic entities (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entity]] the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]].<ref name="Surfer31"/> The character also witnesses the triumph of the hero [[Quasar (Wendell Vaughn)|Quasar]] - acting as the [[Incarnation|avatar]] of cosmic entity [[Infinity (comics)|Infinity]] - over the villain [[Maelstrom (comics)|Maelstrom]], who acts for the entity [[Oblivion (comics)|Oblivion]].<ref>''Quasar'' #26 (Sep. 1991)</ref>

The Living Tribunal's power is virtually limitless, as the entity prevents the [[Infinity Gems]] from being used in unison,<ref>''Warlock and the Infinity Watch'' #1 (Feb. 1992)</ref> although it remains subservient to a single, even higher entity referred to as "The One Above All.<ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z'' Hardcover Vol. 6</ref> The entity has representatives called ''The Magistrati'' who dispense judgments by request on alien worlds, and chose to reveal the previously unseen face of "Necessity" to [[She-Hulk]] as a reflection of her own face, stating that the face is a "Cosmic Mirror which reminds us to always judge others as we would have ourselves judged."<ref>''She-Hulk'' vol. 2, #12 (Nov. 2006)</ref>

[[Iron Man]] and the [[Uatu|Watcher]] later find what appears to be the Living Tribunal's withered corpse on the moon, with no sign of who killed the entity.<ref>''New Avengers'' (vol. 3) #8 (July 2013)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Living Tribunal possesses near absolute control over the Marvel Multiverse.

[[Thanos]] wielding the [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Gauntlet]] ranked the Tribunal's power as the highest in Marvel's regular multiversal hierarchy.<ref>''Thanos Annual'' #1 (2014)</ref> However, the Tribunal has also referred to higher entities that vastly eclipse its own power.<ref>''Thanos: The Infinity Revelation'' #1 (August 2014)</ref>

Until a few years after the second [[Secret Wars II|Secret Wars]], the Living Tribunal was kept on a level of power in which it could easily detonate stars, and that was it.<ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' Vol.2 #7 (June, 1986)</ref> It was first over two decades past the character's introduction that it was retroactively remodelled to possess an at least 16-dimensional, [[Projective Geometry|high infinite]] scale of power.<ref>''Fantastic Four Annual'' Vol.1 #27 (1994)</ref>

==In other media==
During ''[[DC vs. Marvel|DC vs. Marvel/Marvel vs. DC]]'', the Tribunal teamed up with the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] to save their worlds from the two cosmic brothers' attempts to destroy one of the two universes. Their pact, with the help of Access, created the Amalgam Universe by merging the two universes, in order to "buy some time".<ref>''Marvel vs. DC'' #3</ref> As the new Amalgam Universe was unstable, the former universes are restored.  The struggle of "The Brothers" continues until the efforts of Batman and Captain America against them make them realize they both "Did Well", and the universes are spared.<ref>''DC vs. Marvel'' #4</ref>
