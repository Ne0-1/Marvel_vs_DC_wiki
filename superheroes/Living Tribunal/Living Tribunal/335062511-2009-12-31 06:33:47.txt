The '''Living Tribunal''' is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character first appeared in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #157 June 1967 (cameo - first full appearance next issue) and was created by [[Stan Lee]], [[Marie Severin]] and [[Herb Trimpe]].

==Publication history==
The Living Tribunal [[debut]]ed in a storyline called "The Sands of Death" in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #157 - 163 (June - Dec. 1967), giving [[mystic]] hero [[Doctor Strange]] a limited time to prove Earth is worth saving. Established as apparently the supreme power in the Marvel Universe, the character made several sporadic appearances over the years, including ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'' #32 (April 1982); ''[[Rom (comics)|Rom]]'' #41 (April 1983) and ''[[Secret Wars II]]'' #6 (Dec. 1985). The Living Tribunal revealed clues as to its' true purpose and nature in ''[[Silver Surfer]]'' vol. 3, #31 (Dec. 1989).

After brief appearances in the role of observer in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' #16 (Sep. 1991) and ''[[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]]'' #26 (Sep. 1991), the character had a significant role in the [[limited series]] ''[[Infinity Gauntlet]]'' #1 - 6 (July - Dec. 1991) and ''[[Warlock and the Infinity Watch]]'' #1 (Feb. 1992). The Living Tribunal's role was eventually expanded on ''[[She-Hulk]]'' vol. 2, #12 (Nov. 2006).

==Biography==
The Living Tribunal is a virtually [[omnipotence|omnipotent]] entity that oversees and maintain balance in the realities that constitute the Marvel Comics [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Multiverse]], including the mainstream universe ([[Earth-616|616]]) and all [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]]s. 

The character is first encountered by [[Doctor Strange]], announcing its' intent to destroy Earth due to its' potential for evil. After a series of trials Strange is able to convince the Living Tribunal that good also exists, and Earth is spared.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #157 - 163 (Jun. - Dec. 1967)</ref> The Tribunal reappears to the [[Galador]]ian spaceknight [[Rom (comics)|Rom]];<ref>''Rom'' #41 (April 1983)</ref> appears briefly with the rest of the cosmic hierarchy when in discussion with the entity the [[Beyonder (comics)|Beyonder]];<ref>''Secret Wars II'' #6 (Dec. 1985)</ref> and reveals to the former [[Herald of Galactus]] the [[Silver Surfer]] that its three faces represent "Equity"; "Vengeance" and "Necessity" respectively. The fourth side of the Living Tribunal's head is a void, with the entity claiming that it could have represented the face of the [[cosmic  entity]] the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]].<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #31 (Dec. 1989)</ref> The character also witnesses the triumph of the hero [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]] - acting as the [[avatar]] of cosmic entity [[Infinity (comics)|Infinity]] - over the villain [[Maelstrom (comics)|Maelstrom]], who acts for the entity [[Oblivion (comics)|Oblivion]].<ref>''Quasar'' #26 (Sep. 1991)</ref>

The Living Tribunal's power is apparently limitless, as the entity neutralizes the [[Infinity Gems]], preventing them from being used in unison.<ref>''Warlock and the Infinity Watch'' #1 (Feb. 1992)</ref> The entity has representatives called ''The Magistrati'' who dispense judgments by request on alien worlds, and chose to reveal the previously covered face of "Necessity" to [[She-Hulk]] as a reflection of her own face, stating that the face is a "Cosmic Mirror which reminds us to always judge others as we would have ourselves judged."<ref>''She-Hulk'' vol. 2, #12 (Nov. 2006)</ref>
