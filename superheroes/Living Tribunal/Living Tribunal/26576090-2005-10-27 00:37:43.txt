[[Image:Livingtribunal.JPG|right]]The '''Living Tribunal''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|Universe]]. The Tribunal is an [[omnipotence|omnipotent]] entity that is empowered by an unknown force to pass judgment on beings capable of changing the universe and to maintain the 'cosmic balance of power'.  

The Living Tribunal oversees all the realities that constitute the Marvel Multiverse, from the mainstream "616" universe to all the alternate realities shown in "What If" comics and stories in alternate and parallel realities, such as Earth X and Squadron Supreme. They are sometimes compared to [[The Spectre]] of [[DC Comics]]. 

The Living Tribunal is a trio of entities often presented in the form of a giant, golden man with a disembodied, three-faced head that floats above his body. The Tribunal passes judgment on crises that endangers the multiverse, usually through the bodies of M-Bodies, which have been empowered with a portion of the Living Tribunal's powers. It has been said that there is one who ranks above them, the One Above All (not to be confused with the leader of the [[Celestials]], who also bears the same name), whose will he seeks to carry out. This being, supposedly the [[God]] of the Marvel Universe, has never been fully described or displayed, and most likely never will be. (During the ''Marvel vs. DC'' crossover, the [[Blue Brother]] was intended to be the One Above All by writers until the idea was nixed by higher-ups.)

The Living Tribunal has three faces. One is uncovered, one is partially covered, and one is completely covered. These three faces have multiple meanings:
* [[Equity]], [[Necessity]], and [[Vengeance]]

The Living Tribunal once possessed a fourth face of another entity, which eventually left to seek its own identity. This entity over time became the enigmatic entity known as the Stranger.

When [[Thanos]] assembled the [[Infinity Gems]] into the [[ Infinity Gauntlet]], [[Eternity]] and other cosmic beings appealed to the Tribunal to oppose his actions, but the Tribunal decided that Thanos had a right to do so, on the basis that survival of the fittest is a natural law. However, when [[Adam Warlock]] took possession of the Gauntlet, the Tribunal opposed him, because of the instability that Warlock had demonstrated during the Cosmic Tribunal, when Adam Warlock lashed out at his fellow peers. Proving himself a match for the Gauntlet, the Tribunal forced Warlock to disassemble it, but did allow him to safeguard the Gems, which led to the formation of the [[Infinity Watch]].
