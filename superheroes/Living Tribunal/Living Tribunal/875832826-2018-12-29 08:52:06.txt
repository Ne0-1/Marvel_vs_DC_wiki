The character first appeared in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #157 (June 1967) and was created by [[Stan Lee]], [[Marie Severin]], and [[Herb Trimpe]].

==Publication history==
The Living Tribunal debuted in a storyline called "The Sands of Death" in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #157–163 (June–Dec.&nbsp;1967), giving [[mysticism|mystic]] hero [[Doctor Strange]] a limited time to prove Earth is worth saving. Established as apparently the supreme power in the Marvel Universe, the character made several sporadic appearances over the years, including ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'' #32 (April 1982); ''[[Rom (comics)|Rom]]'' #41 (April 1983) and ''[[Secret Wars II]]'' #6 (Dec. 1985). The Living Tribunal revealed clues as to its true purpose and nature in ''[[Silver Surfer]]'' vol. 3, #31 (Dec. 1989).

After brief appearances in the role of observer in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' #16 (Sep. 1991) and ''[[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]]'' #26 (Sep. 1991), the character had a significant role in the [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''[[The Infinity Gauntlet|Infinity Gauntlet]]'' #1–6 (July – Dec. 1991), ''[[Warlock and the Infinity Watch]]'' #1 (Feb. 1992), and ''[[DC vs. Marvel]]'' #1–4 (April – May 1996). The Living Tribunal's role was eventually expanded on in ''[[She-Hulk]]'' vol. 2, #12 (Nov. 2006).

==Fictional character biography==
The Living Tribunal is an entity that oversees and maintains balance in the realities that constitute the Marvel Comics [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Multiverse]], including the [[Earth-616|mainstream universe]] and all [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]]s. He serves as a judge of these realities.

The character is first encountered by [[Doctor Strange]], announcing its intent to destroy Earth due to its potential for evil. After a series of trials [[Dr. Strange]] is able to convince the Living Tribunal that good also exists, and Earth is spared.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #157 - 163 (Jun. - Dec. 1967)</ref> The Tribunal reappears to the [[Galadorian (comics)|Galadorian]] spaceknight [[Rom (comics)|Rom]];<ref>''Rom'' #41 (April 1983)</ref> appears briefly with the rest of the cosmic hierarchy when in discussion with the entity the [[Beyonder (comics)|Beyonder]];<ref>''Secret Wars II'' #6 (Dec. 1985)</ref> and reveals to the former [[Herald of Galactus]] (the [[Silver Surfer]]) that its three faces represent "Equity" (hooded face), "Vengeance" (partially shrouded face), and "Necessity" (fully shrouded face).<ref name="Surfer31">''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #31 (Dec. 1989)</ref> The fourth side of the Living Tribunal's head is a void, with the entity claiming that the [[Cosmic entities (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entity]] the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]] once existed as this part of its being.<ref name="Surfer31"/>{{clarify|reason=What does this mean?|date=August 2015}} The character also witnesses the triumph of the hero [[Quasar (Wendell Vaughn)|Quasar]]—acting as the [[Incarnation|avatar]] of cosmic entity [[Infinity (comics)|Infinity]]—over the villain [[Maelstrom (comics)|Maelstrom]], who acts for the entity [[Oblivion (comics)|Oblivion]].<ref>''Quasar'' #26 (Sep. 1991)</ref>

The Living Tribunal's power is virtually limitless, as the entity prevents the [[Infinity Gems]] from being used in unison,<ref>''Warlock and the Infinity Watch'' #1 (Feb. 1992)</ref> although it remains subservient to a single, even higher entity referred to as "The One Above All" (not to be confused with the celestial also called the [[One Above All]]).<ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z'' Hardcover Vol. 6</ref> The entity has representatives called ''The Magistrati'' who dispense judgments by request on alien worlds, and chose to reveal the previously unseen face of "Necessity" to [[She-Hulk]] as a reflection of her own face, stating that the face is a "Cosmic Mirror which reminds us to always judge others as we would have ourselves judged".<ref>''She-Hulk'' vol. 2, #12 (Nov. 2006)</ref>

[[Iron Man]] and the [[Uatu|Watcher]] later find what appears to be the Living Tribunal's withered corpse on the moon, with no sign of who killed the entity.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 3 #8 (July 2013)</ref>

When [[Hank Pym|Yellowjacket]] ventured into the Multiverse during the ''Time Runs Out'' storyline, the cause of his death was discovered: the Living Tribunal had died fighting the [[Beyonders]] while attempting to halt the annihilation of the Marvel Multiverse.<ref name="NA30">''New Avengers'' vol. 3 #30 (April 2015)</ref>

An alternative version of [[Adam Warlock]] later took up the Living Tribunal's vacant position, on orders from the One-Above-All (here called "Above-All-Others").<ref>''Thanos: The Infinity Finale'' (April 2016)</ref>

After the devourer of worlds [[Galactus]] evolves into a lifebringer, [[Lord Chaos (Marvel Comics)|Lord Chaos]] and [[Master Order]] consider this to throw the cosmic hierarchy out of balance, and ask the new Living Tribunal to render judgment. However, when the Tribunal decides in favor of a "new balance for a new cosmos", Order and Chaos join forces to seemingly kill the entity.<ref>''Ultimates 2'' #2</ref> The Living Tribunal is later resurrected and seen taking Lord Chaos and Master Order to judgment after the defeat of the First Firmament.<ref>''Ultimates 2'' #100</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
[[Thanos]] wielding the [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Gauntlet]] ranked the Tribunal's power as the highest in Marvel's regular multiversal hierarchy.<ref>''Thanos Annual'' #1 (2014)</ref> However, the Tribunal has also referred to a higher entity that vastly eclipses its own power,<ref>''Thanos: The Infinity Revelation'' #1 (August 2014)</ref> and was killed by the Beyonders.<ref name="NA30"/>

The Living Tribunal was the embodiment of the Marvel Multiverse,<ref>''New Avengers'' Vol.3 #30</ref> and the sum totality of all the abstract entities within it.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol.3 #31 (Dec. 1989)</ref>

==Other versions==
During ''[[DC vs. Marvel|DC vs. Marvel/Marvel vs. DC]]'', the Tribunal teamed up with the [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]] to save their worlds from the two cosmic brothers' attempts to destroy one of the two multiverses. Their pact, with the help of Access, created the Amalgam multiverse by merging the two multiverses, in order to "buy some time".<ref>''Marvel vs. DC'' #3</ref> As the new Amalgam multiverse was unstable, the former multiverses are restored.  The struggle of "The Brothers" continues until the efforts of [[Batman]] and [[Captain America]] against them make them realize they both "Did Well", and the multiverses are spared.<ref>''DC vs. Marvel'' #4</ref>
