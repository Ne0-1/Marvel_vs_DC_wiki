'''Wong-Chu''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] supervillain. He was the first villain that [[Iron Man]] faced.

==Fictional character biography==
Wong-Chu once served as a commander for the Vietnamese congress during the [[Vietnam War]]. When a reckless American contingent sets off a booby trap in the Vietnamese jungles while testing a new weapon, one of Wong-Chu's commanders finds a survivor in the form of [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]]. Wong-Chu reviews the unconscious civilian's papers and finds out that Stark is a famous weapons inventor.  Wong Chu's assistant Hsaio informs him that the shrapnel in Stark's heart should kill him within the week. Wong-Chu tries to capitalize on this by telling Stark that he is dying and if he creates a powerful new weapon for him, his surgeons will save him. Stark realises he is lying, thinking if he could remove the shrapnel he would have Stark continue to develop weapons and remove the shrapnel quicker. Wong-Chu then supplies whatever tools and scrap iron that Stark requires, and eventually lends the American the assistance of his man servant named [[Ho Yinsen]], a brilliant physicist. When Tony and Yinsen were putting the finishing touches on the Iron Man armor, an alarm went off warning them that Wong-Chu was approaching. Yinsen runs outside and distracts the guards. Wong-Chu kills Yinsen as Iron Man finishes recharging his armour, but doesn't notice that Tony Stark is in the Iron Man armor hiding on the ceiling. Unable to find Tony Stark, Wong-Chu has Hsaio prepare his favorite sport which involved wrestling with the local peasants, at the start of the story he is shown offering to free the village if he can be beaten in wrestling. After defeating a peasant, Wong-Chu demands the next challenger, and a man in heavy clothing asks to challenge him. To his dismay, the next challenger ended up being Tony Stark in the Iron Man armor who ended up defeating Wong-Chu. In a futile attempt to call for backup over the loudspeaker in a nearby observation tower which Iron Man interfered with and instead sent out a message for the guards to flee, Wong-Chu tries to escape defeat by the Ironclad Avenger and kill the prisoners. Wong-Chu perishes in an ammo dump explosion caused by Iron Man.<ref>Tales of Suspense #39</ref>

It was later revealed that Wong-Chu was a pawn of the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]].<ref>Iron Man #267</ref>

Wong-Chu's brain (alongside Yinsen's brain) was resurrected and placed in a robotic body.<ref>Iron Man Annual Vol 1 2000</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Wong-Chu has no powers of his own, but he is a good [[martial artist]].

==In other media==
===Television===
* In the ''[[Iron Man (TV series)|Iron Man]]'' episode "The Origin of Iron Man", Mandarin was the one who injured and abducted Tony Stark instead of Wong-Chu.

===Film===
* Wong-Chu appears in ''[[The Invincible Iron Man (film)|The Invincible Iron Man]]'' voiced by [[James Sie]].

* In the 2008 live action ''[[Iron Man (film)|Iron Man]]'' movie, '''Raza''' (played by [[Faran Tahir]]) is the [[Afghanistan]] version of Wong-Chu. In the beginning of the movie, Raza (who has a single red ring that he rubs with his other hand and makes references to Genghis Khan) was the leader of the '''Ten Rings''', the terrorist group that held Tony Stark and [[Ho Yinsen|Yinsen]] captive. After he gunned down an armed Yinsen, Raza was scarred by Stark (in the first completed Iron Man armor) when he shot a missile at a wall right beside his face. Sometime later, Raza had the Ten Rings recover the original armor's remains. After showing his benefactor [[Obadiah Stane]] the remains, Raza talked about having an army of armored soldiers. However, Stane betrayed Raza by paralyzing him and presumably had Raza killed.
