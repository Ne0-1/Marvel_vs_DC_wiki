'''Wong-Chu''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] supervillain. He was the first villain that [[Iron Man]] faced.

==Fictional character biography==
Wong-Chu once served as a commander for the Vietnamese congress during the [[Vietnam War]]. When a reckless American contingent sets off a booby trap in the Vietnamese jungles, one of Wong-Chu's commanders finds a survivor in the form of [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]]. Wong-Chu reviews the unconscious civilian's papers and finds out that Stark is a famous weapons inventor.  Wong Chu's assistant Hsaio informs him that the shrapnel in Stark's heart should kill him within the week. Wong-Chu tries to capitalize on this by telling Stark that he is dying and if he creates a powerful new weapon for him, his surgeons will save him. Wong-Chu then supplies whatever tools and scrap iron that Stark requires, and eventually lends the American the assistance of his man servant named [[Ho Yinsen]]. When Tony and Yinsen were putting the finishing touches on the Iron Man armor, an alarm went off warning them that Wong-Chu was approaching. Wong-Chu kills Yinsen, but doesn't notice that Tony Stark is in the Iron Man armor hiding on the ceiling. Unable to find Tony Stark, Wong-Chu has Hsaio prepare his favorite sport which involved wrestling with the local peasants. After defeating a peasant, Wong-Chu demands the next challenger. To his dismay, the next challenger ended up being Tony Stark in the Iron Man armor who ended up defeating Wong-Chu. In a futile attempt to call for backup over the loudspeaker in a nearby observation tower, Wong-Chu tries to escape defeat by the Ironclad Avenger. Wong-Chu perishes in an ammo dump explosion caused by Iron Man.<ref>Tales of Suspense #39</ref>

It was later revealed that Wong-Chu was a pawn of the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]].<ref>Iron Man #267</ref>

Wong-Chu's brain (alongside Yinsen's brain) was resurrected and placed in a robotic body.<ref>Iron Man Annual Vol 1 2000</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Wong-Chu has no powers of his own, but he is a good [[martial artist]].

==In other media==
===Television===
* In the ''[[Iron Man (TV series)|Iron Man]]'' episode "The Origin of Iron Man", [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]] was the one who injured and abducted Tony Stark instead of Wong-Chu.

===Film===
* Wong-Chu appears in ''[[The Invincible Iron Man (film)|The Invincible Iron Man]]'' voiced by [[James Sie]].

* In the 2008 live action ''[[Iron Man (film)|Iron Man]]'' movie, '''Raza''' (played by [[Faran Tahir]]) is the [[Afghanistan]] version of Wong-Chu. In the beginning of the movie, Raza (who has a single red ring that he rubs with his other hand and makes references Genghis Khan) was the leader of the '''Ten Rings''', the terrorist group that held Tony Stark and [[Ho Yinsen|Yinsen]] captive. After he gunned down an armed Yinsen, Raza was "bested" by Stark (in the first completed Iron Man armor) in a fire fight. Sometime later, Raza (scarred on one side of his face from his fight with Stark) had the Ten Rings recover the original armor's remains. After showing his benefactor [[Obadiah Stane]] the remains, Raza talked about having an army of armored soldiers. However, Stane betrayed Raza by paralzing him and presumably had Raza killed.
