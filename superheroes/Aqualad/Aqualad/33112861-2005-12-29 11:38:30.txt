[[Tempest]] is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] from [[DC Comics]].  He was [[Aquaman]]'s teenage partner, and like many other such 'kid sidekicks' popular in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]], his powers originally varied very little from his mentor.

'''Tempest's''' real name is '''Garth''', and his origin is similar to that of his [[mentor]]: he is an amphibious humanoid who was left to die but survived to become a hero.  He was one of the founding members of the [[Titans (comics)|Teen Titans]], and has been been a member of that team in many of its incarnations although later as a reservist since he began to feel he was of little help out of the water.  His girlfriend for many years was [[Aquagirl]], until her death during the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]].''

As a result of his grief and repeated telepathic abuse by [[Steve Dayton|Mento]], among other factors, Aqualad lost his ability to control marine life. While he later regained this power during the [[Millennium (comics)|Millennium]] event, it came with the condition that his commands must now be phrased as requests to the creatures to perform desired actions, although the animals apparently need little persuasion.

After receiving training in the arts of sorcery, Garth adopted the alias of '''Tempest''', and resumed his role as Aquaman's right hand man.  Some friction arose between the two heroes when Aquaman's lover, [[Dolphin (comics)|Dolphin]], left him for Tempest, but the two have since resolved their differences.  Tempest and Dolphin are now married with a young son named '''Cerdian'''.

===Other Media===
Aqualad has appeared on the ''[[Teen Titans (animated series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series, where he is voiced by [[Wil Wheaton]].  In "Winner Take All", it appears that Aqualad has acquired the ability to ''control'' water on land. In the series, he serves as a Titans East member, a short term crush of [[Raven (comics)|Raven]] and [[Starfire (DC Comics)|Starfire]], and a temporary rival to [[Beast Boy]]. He is now an official member of Teen Titans' sister group, Teen Titans East, with [[Bumblebee (comics)|Bumblebee]], [[Speedy (comics)|Speedy]], and the twins [[MÃ¡s y Menos]].

He is now a target for the Brotherhood of Evil. He was voiced by [[Dave Coulier]]
