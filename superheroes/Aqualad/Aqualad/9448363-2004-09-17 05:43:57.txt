[[Aqualad]] is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] from [[DC Comics]].  He was [[Aquaman]]'s teenage partner, and like many other such 'kid sidekicks' popular in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]], his powers originally varied very little from his mentor.

For a period of time, Aqualad lost his ability to control marine life. While, he later regained it, it came with the condition that his commands must now be phrased as requests to the creatures to perform desired actions, although the animals apparently need little persuasion.

Today, Aqualad goes by the alias of '''Tempest'''.

Aqualad has appeared on the [[Teen Titans]] animated series, where he is voiced by [[Wil Wheaton]].
