==Fictional character biography==

===Garth===
{{Main|Garth (comics)}}
Years ago, King Thar and his wife Queen Berra became the reigning monarchs of Shayeris, the capital of a group of Idyllist colonies in the Hidden Valley. Radical Idyllists deposed and murdered King Thar and banished his pregnant wife Queen Berra to Poseidonis, the capital city of [[Atlantis (DC Comics)|Atlantis]]; there she gave birth to Garth, a child with purple eyes. Superstitious Atlanteans claimed that Garth had been born genetically inferior due to his purple eyes and banished him to a barren seabed leagues away from Atlantis. He survived and later befriended [[Aquaman]], the sometimes outcast King of Atlantis. He was a founding member of the [[Teen Titans]], and later became known as Tempest.

==In other media==

===Television===
* Aqualad's first animated appearance was alongside Aquaman in [[Filmation]]'s 1967 [[animated series]] ''[[The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure]]'', as well as in the Teen Titans shorts that were part of the series. The ''[[Aquaman (TV series)|Aquaman]]'' cartoon series of 1968 was a repackaged 30-minute version featuring primarily (but not exclusively) Aquaman and Aqualad. He was voiced by [[Jerry Dexter]].
* Aqualad has also appeared on the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Wil Wheaton]]. His first appearance was in "Deep Six" where he, [[List of minor characters in the Teen Titans animated series#Tramm|Tramm]], and the Titans defeated [[Trident (DC Comics)|Trident]]; here and in his other appearances, he demonstrates telepathic control of sea life. In "Winner Take All", Aqualad demonstrates the ability to control water by means of Hydrokinesis. In the series, he serves as a [[Titans East]] member, a short term crush of [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]] and [[Starfire (Koriand'r)|Starfire]], and a temporary rival to [[Beast Boy]]. He is now an official member of Teen Titans' sister group, Titans East, with [[Bumblebee (comics)|Bumblebee]], [[Roy Harper (comics)|Speedy]], and the twins [[Más y Menos]]. He appears in a cameo in the movie after the series, ''[[Teen Titans: Trouble in Tokyo]]''. As the Titans travel to [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]] he comes out of the water and waves to them.
* Aqualad also makes eight appearances on the comic series based on the show. In his first appearance in ''[[Teen Titans Go!]]'' (issue #10), he searches for [[Aquagirl|Gill Girl]]. He told the Titans that she used to have a crush on him, but he looked at her like a sister. [[Beast Boy]] did not believe him and says that she dumped him. He made short appearances in #20, #25, & #27. One of the stories in issue #30 focused on him and [[Roy Harper (comics)|Speedy]]. In issue #48 an alternative version of him as Tempest appeared in a group called the Teen Tyrants.
* Aqualad was mentioned in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "The Color of Revenge!", as Batman says to Robin, "Even Aqualad had to scrub barnacles." He made a full appearance in "Sidekicks Assemble!", voiced by [[Zack Shada]] as a teenager and by [[Zachary Gordon]] as a child. He battled [[Ra's al Ghul]] along with Robin and Speedy. Here, Aqualad is shown to be in his late teens and is very resentful of the praise lavished upon Aquaman, eventually telling him off in the episode's final scene.
* Garth appears in the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' episode "Downtime", where he is voiced by [[Yuri Lowenthal]]. In the episode, it is explained that Garth is the best friend of Kaldur’ahm. While Kaldur went on to become Aquaman's sidekick, Garth stayed in Atlantis in order to hone his abilities at an Atlantean sorcery conservatory. Sometime in between this, and the episode "Downtime", he started a relationship with [[Tula (Young Justice)|Tula]] (Aquagirl), who was formerly involved with Kaldur. A reference to his Tempest identity is made during a battle with [[Black Manta]], with Garth shouting "I summon the power of the tempest!" while conjuring a cyclone.

Within the series, he is the son of supervillain [[Black Manta]], and the leader of Young Justice. In the episode "Alienated", Kaldur leaves the team to join his father. He blames the team for Aquagirl's death on a mission and Aquaman for not telling him who his real father was. He dons a similar outfit to Black Manta.<ref>{{Cite web|author=Fitzpatrick, Kevin|url=http://www.ugo.com/tv/comic-con-2010-young-justice|title=Comic-Con 2010: Young Justice Goes Under Cover|publisher=[[UGO Networks]]|date=2010-07-23|access-date=2010-07-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726145835/http://www.ugo.com/tv/comic-con-2010-young-justice|archive-date=26 July 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> While confronting the team, he appears to murder Artemis.

* The Kaldur’ahm version of Aqualad appears in the ''[[Teen Titans Go! (TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'' episode "Let's Get Serious", reprised by [[Khary Payton]], where he mocks the Titans for not being "serious" heroes.
