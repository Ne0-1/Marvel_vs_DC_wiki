'''Brainwave''' or '''Brain Wave''' is a name shared by two characters in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|Universe]], who are father and son.

==Henry King, Sr.==
Brainwave was Henry King, a [[super-villain]] who used his [[psionic]] powers to battle the [[Justice Society of America]] in the [[1940s]], first appearing in ''All-Star Comics'' #15 (February/March [[1943]]). He was a member of the [[Injustice Society]].

===Character history===
'''Henry King, Sr.''' was born in the early 1910s as a mutant with vast mental attributes. An introvert, he found solace in reading books, which he one day learned to create three-dimensional images of, such as Sir Lancelot of the Round Table. King had developed a crush on a neighbor girl named Lucy who eventually married his acquaintance Edwin Ackerman, causing King tremendous jealousy. 

As an adult, King was a college and later medical school graduate, obtaining a psychiatry degree. He decided to use his now more fully developed image projecting abilities in a secret life of crime. His first criminal act was creating thought-constructs that stole money needed by him to fund his new activities. He then became a crime lord.

In early [[1942]], Brain Wave contacted Professor Elba, developer of the "insanity serum", augmented by Brain Wave's mental abilities. Professor Elba was defeated by the Justice Society.

Noticing this team of vigilantes, Brain Wave approached individual members of the JSA as psychiatrist Dr. Henry King. Implanting a post-hypnotic suggestions to assemble at the [[1939]] World's Fair perisphere, he attached each of the JSAers (except Green Lantern) to a mental chamber which immersed them in a fantasy of wartime conflict. Brain Wave next assembled the All-Star Squadron at the World's Fair's trylon tower, imprisoning each of them in the same device. However, once Green Lantern was connected to the device, his willpower proved too great for the chamber and its orchestrator, leaving it in ruin and King mentally unstable.

In [[1943]], Brain Wave again battled the Justice Society, when its individual members traced various criminal operations back to Dr. King. At this time, he vented his revenge on Edwin Ackerman. [[Starman (DC Comics Golden Age)|Starman]] tracked King to his office of psychiatry, however he was unable to produce sufficient proof to arrest the villain. Each of the JSAers eventually converged on King's Sharktooth Bay tower. Additionally, heroines [[Wonder Woman]], [[Hawkgirl]], Inza Cramer, Dian Belmont, Doris Lee and Peachy Pet Thunder. Together, the two groups were able to corner King, who fell off of his tower to his assumed doom.

However, King's smock was caught on the limb of a tree. Thus saved, he sought revenge by utilizing his shrinking ray device to shrink the JSAers to a height of 8 inches. Storing them as trophies in his lair, King left his foes to meet with his minions. With the aid of [[Hawkman]]'s bird allies, the JSAers left to confront the criminal henchmen directly. Eventually, [[Johnny Thunder]] commanded his Thunderbolt to help restore each member to their proper height. The JSA then converged once more at the Sharktooth Bay tower, the road to which was mined by King. However, Thunderbolt teleported the bombs to under the tower, which again seemed to have ended the life of King.

Having once again survived, King adopted the alias of dream psychologist Dr. Forest Malone. In 1946, he petitioned his adversaries to subject themselves to his experimental dream analyzer. This device slowly drove each member except for Johnny Thunder towards insanity. With the assistance of Thunder's Thunderbolt, King was this time apprehended and placed in jail. 

However, King escaped confinement in 1947 as he joined the Wizard's first incarnation of the Injustice Society of the World. King battled the Green Lantern, making the critical mistake of leaving his old foe near death on a ravine rather than return the hero's corpse to their headquarters. As a result, Lantern freed his fellow teammates and captured King and his colleagues.

==Henry King, Jr.==

'''Henry "Hank" King, Jr.''' is a [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]], sometimes [[supervillain]], who is the son of the original Brainwave, from whom he inherited his powers. Created by [[Roy Thomas]], [[Jerry Ordway]] and [[Mike Machlan]], he first appears in ''[[All-Star Squadron]]'' #24 (1983). 

===Fictional character biography===
====Infinity, Inc.====
As '''Brainwave Jr.''', Hank is a founding member of [[Infinity, Inc.]], doing so in an attempt to bring honor to his family name. During the run of ''Infinity, Inc.'' Brainwave develops a relationship with fellow team member [[Jade (comics)|Jade]], daughter of [[Alan Scott|Green Lantern]].

When Hank's father dies, he passes on his mental powers to his son, greatly increasing them and causing him to become somewhat unhinged. He drops the "Jr." and drops out of the public eye after Infinity Inc. disbands. <ref>''Infinity, Inc.'' #1-53</ref>

He shows up years later, attacking a part of the [[Justice League]], together with a group he called the [[Legion of Doom (comics)|Legion of Doom]] <ref>''[[Extreme Justice]]'' #14-18</ref>. After that adventure, he reappears in a mental institution, especially created for him and funded by Alan Scott, severely unhinged, and is almost killed by [[Obsidian (comics)|Obsidian]]  <ref>''Green Lantern & Sentinel'' #1-2</ref>. He appears again later in New York City, causing riots and general chaos with his telepathy, even mind controlling Jade and [[Green Lantern (Alan Scott)]] until finally confronting [[Kyle Rayner]]. He leaves peacefully <ref>''[[Green Lantern]] (vol. 3)'' # 152</ref>.

====JSA====
He resurfaces again as part of [[Black Adam]]'s team, including Infinitors [[Northwind (comics)|Northwind]] and [[Albert Rothstein|Atom Smasher]], helping to liberate [[Kahndaq]]. In an attempt to stop Hank, considered the most dangerous member of the team, [[Carter Hall (comics)|Hawkman]] has [[Ray Palmer (comics)|Ray Palmer]] shrink and enter Brainwave's body. Guided by [[Dr. Mid-Nite]], Palmer plans to operate on King's brain, specifically the abnormal mass of nerve fibers leading from the [[auditory cortex]] to a growth on the side of the [[inferior colliculus]], the supposed source of Brainwave's powers.

While a member of Black Adam's group, Brainwave acts both malicious and calculating, seemingly being depicted as a supervillain again. His telepathy is also portrayed at a high point, being able to will the powerful [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] to turn back into young Billy Batson by forcing him to say "Shazam!"

The source of these actions are found in Hank's brain, where Palmer encounters [[Mr. Mind]], an obscure Captain Marvel villain, who is feeding on Brainwave's growth. He finds it especially delicious, unlike regular humans. Palmer eventually gets past the worm and successfully incapacitates Brainwave. He is taken back with the [[Justice Society of America|JSA]] and left in the care of his mother [[Merry Pemberton]]. It is unknown when Brainwave became a host for Mr. Mind <ref><i>JSA</i> #56-58 and <i>[[Hawkman]] (vol. 4)</i> #24-25</ref>.

Later, Brainwave is recruited by [[Doctor Fate]] to save [[Sandy Hawkins|Sand]] from the [[Dreaming]]. In that mental plane, he is able to destroy the brainwashing that has been done to Sand and returns him to the waking realm. <ref>''JSA'' #63-63</ref>

Henry King, Jr. is portrayed differently over his many appearances, being heroic at first, appearing as a villain secondly, and with a third potrayal as a mixture of the two, but largely heroic.

==Powers and abilities==
Both King Sr. and Jr. have a variety of mental powers. King Sr. is originally much stronger, but upon his death, he somehow passes his powers on to his son, vastly increasing King Jr.'s power level.

Chief among their powers is [[telepathy]]. Both are able to dominate many minds at once and cause people too see illusions or even have complete control over them. Proximity seemed key to the effectiveness of this power, even though it had no defined range. King Jr. had mentioned how even strong wills could not resist him when he was right next to them. While many telepaths filter out the thoughts of others, King Jr. allows the millions of minds he constantly comes across to flow freely through his mind.

Lesser used powers of the Kings include [[telekinesis]], the creation of realistic three-dimensional holograms, and the ability to fire blasts of psionic energy.

==In other media==
Brainwave appeared in the [[Justice League]] episode "Legends". Here, his name is Ray Thompson, and he resides in an alternate dimension where the Justice Guild of America was real (they were [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]]'s childhood comic heroes). A devastating nuclear war, that the Justice Guild died in, had all but destroyed the world; the aftereffects of the nuclear war had granted him psychic powers, but mutated and deformed him into a hideous monster. The transformation drove him insane, and he used his powers to turn the city into a replica of the comics that inhabitated the heroes he worshipped.

When Green Lantern, [[Hawkgirl (animated)|Hawkgirl]], the [[Martian Manhunter]], and the [[Wally West|Flash]] arrive in the dimension as a result of their battle with [[Lex Luthor]], Ray initially seems to be nothing more than the Justice Guild's boy sidekick; he even takes a cue from the live action Batman show by shouting corny exclamations. As the heroes discover, however, the world is all an illusion, and the disturbances J'onn felt come from Ray. 

Determined to keep things the way they are, Brainwave distracts the Guild with a giant robot, while he battles the League with his powers. Ultimately, the Guild makes the decision to fight him, despite the fact that they will disappear with his illusion. The shock of his heroes turning against him, and the combined stress they put on him is too much for Brainwave, and he collapses. The city returns to its normal ruined self, but its future has returned.

[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]] villain [[Smallville Characters Season Three|Molly Griggs]] (episode "Delete") can control the minds of others through computer hypnotism, and her internet handle is "brainwave", suggesting she is Smallville's version of Brainwave.
