The Calculator is a [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]], initially created by Bob Rozakis in the [[1970's]]. As is commonplace in comics, the character was based on a topical event or trend; in this case, Noah Kuttler took his powers and costume design from the recently-popular pocket [[calculator]]. His costume had a large numerical keypad on the front and a flashlight-like device on the headpiece. When he typed upon the keypad, he could make "hard light" constructs appear from the headpiece, fashioning tools and weapons in the style of [[Green Lantern]]'s power ring.

He was featured in a series of one-shot adventures in assorted titles, fighting almost every hero in the DC Universe. As he was defeated by hero after hero, he would press a special button on his keypad that would (as it was revealed to the reader in a thought balloon) "turn defeat into victory". After months of appearances, the Calculator's scheme was revealed.  The button somehow analyzed the powers of the hero defeating him, and effectively inoculated him from ever being defeated by that hero ever again. This immunity would manifest itself as a force field, rendering a hero unable to touch or otherwise affect The Calculator. This of course meant he could only be defeated by a new hero; luckily, there are an almost endless supply of new heroes in the DC Universe, so he was always able to be defeated.  

The Calculator made intermittent appearances in DC titles over the years, such as [[Blue Beetle]]. In the [[2004]] [[miniseries]] ''[[Identity Crisis (comics)|Identity Crisis]]'', he was revamped as a villainous analogue to [[Oracle (comics)|Oracle]]; a source of information for supervillains planning heists, offering suggestions of weaponry, assisting with logistics, etc, for $1,000 per question. He has become a major player in the current ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' cross-over ''[[Villains United]]'' as a core member of [[Lex Luthor|Lex Luthor's]] Secret Society.
