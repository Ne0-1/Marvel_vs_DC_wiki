==Publication history==
As is commonplace in comics, the character was based on a topical event or trend; in this case, Noah Kuttler took his powers and costume design from the recently-popular pocket [[calculator]]. His costume had a large numerical [[Numeric keypad|keypad]] on the front and a [[flashlight]]-like device on the headpiece. When he typed upon the keypad, he could make "hard light" constructs appear from the headpiece, fashioning tools and weapons in the style of [[Green Lantern]]'s [[Power ring (weapon)|power ring]].<ref name="dc-ency"/>

==Fictional character biography==
He was featured in a series of one-shot adventures in Detective Comics, fighting many of the Justice League members. As he was defeated by hero after hero, he presses a special button on his keypad that would (as it was revealed to the reader in a thought balloon) "turn defeat into victory". After months of appearances, the Calculator's scheme is revealed. The button somehow analyzes the powers or tactics of the hero defeating him, and effectively inoculates him from ever being defeated by that hero ever again. This immunity manifests itself as a force field, rendering a hero unable to touch or otherwise affect The Calculator. This of course meant he could only be defeated by a new hero; fortunately the heroes had many allies to drawn upon. The Calculator could also be defeated when his own weaponry was turned against him.

The Calculator made intermittent appearances in DC titles over the years, such as ''[[Blue Beetle]]''. In the [[2004]] [[miniseries]] ''[[Identity Crisis (comics)|Identity Crisis]]'', he was revamped as a non-costumed villainous analogue to [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]]; a source of information for supervillains planning heists, offering suggestions of weaponry, assisting with logistics, etc. â€” but charging $1,000 per question, unlike Oracle, who works [[pro bono]]. He became a major player in the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' cross-over ''[[Villains United]]'' as a core member of [[Lex Luthor|Lex Luthor's]] [[Secret Society of Super Villains|The Society]]. His immeadeate allies included such villains as Doctor Psycho, Doctor Light and Deathstroke. 

Noah suffers from severe [[Obsessive-compulsive disorder]], unbeknownst to his peers (even though this was hinted at when he was in charge of monitoring [[Supergirl]]), and initially controlled this with medication. However, in ''[[Birds of Prey (comic book)|Birds of Prey]]'', he became obsessed with finding out the identity of Oracle, and this led him toward a mental breakdown. He stops taking his medication and suffers from nightmares about the green mask that Oracle uses as a symbol. In ''Birds of Prey'' issue #111, Noah finally meets the woman behind Oracle face-to-face at a computer-industry conference, but is depicted looking far younger than his previous illustrations in DC titles and his history would indicate. Both are using aliases, and Noah is prevented from learning Oracle's true identity only at the last possible moment through a stratagem devised by Oracle's allies.

===One Year Later===
[[One Year Later|A year]] after the Crisis, Noah leads [[Secret Society of Super Villains|The Society]], taking over from the deceased [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]]. The Society has become a union for super-villains, with all major heists being done through the Society itself.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

===Final Crisis===
The Society is taken over from the inside out when the villain [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]] proves he can trade loyalty for a criminal's deepest desire. This is all part of a successful plan to conquer the Earth and the Calculator is left a groveling witness to various Libra-headed executions. Calculator is there because he is accused of sending computer codes that will help the resistance.<ref>"[[Final Crisis]]" #1-5</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Calculator has a genius level intelligence is a skilled manipulator and superb strategist. The Calculator also has a vast array of criminal contacts. In his early career he used a battlesuit.

Calculator has used a battlesuit with a large calculator in the chest area. The computers in the suit can accurately predict the actions of any hero or even the Earth itself. A projector in the helmet is linked to the suit and can create items by solidifying the dust in the air. Calculator no longer uses this battlesuit and its whereabouts are unknown.

==Appearances in other media==
Calculator is reportedly featured in [[David S. Goyer]]'s script for an upcoming Green Arrow film project entitled "[[Super Max]]".<ref>[http://latinoreview.com/news/supermax-green-arrow-story-details-villains-inmates-gallery-4673 Supermax: Green Arrow Story Details + Villains/Inmates Gallery - Movie News - Latest Movie Reviews and trailers<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
