This [[campy]] [[parody]] of the Batman [[1943]] Movie [[Serial]] starring [[Lewis Wilson]], [[Adam West]]'s '''''Batman''''' was the first full-length theatrical adaptation of the [[DC Comics]] character.  It was later to acquire the video-box title ''Batman: The Movie''.  The [[20th Century Fox]] release starred [[Adam West]] as Batman and [[Burt Ward]] as Robin. Filmed at the end of season one of the ABC [[primetime]] [[Batman (1960s TV series)|''Batman'' TV series]] of the 1960s (between [[April 25]] and [[May 31]], [[1966]] at an estimated $1,377,800), it featured four main criminals from the show, including "fiendish funnyman" [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]] ([[Cesar Romero]]), The "riddling" [[Riddler]] ([[Frank Gorshin]]), that "fowl bird" [[Penguin (comics)|The Penguin]] ([[Burgess Meredith]]), and the "fiendish feline" [[Catwoman]] ([[Lee Meriwether]]).  It was directed by [[Leslie H. Martinson]], who won a [[Golden Gryphon]] for his efforts.  

The 105-minute ''Batman'' opened at [[Paramount Theatre, The (Austin, Texas)|The Paramount Theatre]] in [[Austin, Texas]] on Saturday, [[July 30]], [[1966]] (between the first and second seasons of the [[Batman (1960s TV series)|TV series]]. Like the television series, the movie featured saturated colours, [[camp|campy]] [[dialogue]] and special effects, and over-exaggeration in acting performances, effectively being a [[tongue-in-cheek]] [[parody]].  It performed poorly at the box office and is despised by many fans of the [[gothic horror]] "Creature of the Night" [[Batman]]. 

==Plot summary==
When Batman ([[Adam West|West]]) and Robin ([[Burt Ward|Ward]]) get a tip that Commodore Schmidlapp is in danger aboard his yacht, they launch a rescue mission. After a tangle with an exploding shark, Batman and Robin head back to Commissioner Gordon's office where, by case of deduction and wisdom, they figure out that that the tip was a set-up by four of the most powerful villains ever (Joker, Penguin, Riddler and Catwoman), who seek to defeat the Dynamic Duo once and for all.
Armed with a dehydrator that can turn humans into dust, and a Navy surplus submarine, the "fearsome foursome" intends to take over the world, and Batman and Robin must stop them.
