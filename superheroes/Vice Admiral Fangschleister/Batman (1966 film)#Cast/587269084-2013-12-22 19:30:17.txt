'''''Batman''''', often promoted as '''''Batman: The Movie''''', is a 1966 film based on the ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series, and the first full-length theatrical adaptation of the [[DC Comics]] character [[Batman]]. Released by [[20th Century Fox]], the film starred [[Adam West]] as Batman and [[Burt Ward]] as [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]. The film includes most members of the original TV cast, with the notable exception of [[Julie Newmar]] as Catwoman.

==Plot==
When Batman ([[Adam West|West]]) and Robin ([[Burt Ward|Ward]]) get a tip that Commodore Schmidlapp ([[Reginald Denny (actor)|Reginald Denny]]) is in danger aboard his [[yacht]], they launch a rescue mission using the [[Batcopter]]. As Batman descends on the Bat-ladder to land on the yacht it suddenly vanishes beneath him. He rises out of the sea with a shark attacking his leg. After Batman dislodges it with Bat-shark repellant, the shark explodes. Batman and Robin head back to Commissioner Gordon's office, where they deduce that the tip was a set-up by the United Underworld, a gathering of four of the most powerful villains in [[Gotham City]] ([[Joker (comics)|Joker]], [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]], [[Riddler]] and [[Catwoman]]).

The United Underworld equip themselves with a dehydrator that can turn humans into dust (an invention of Commodore Schmidlapp, who is unaware he has been kidnapped), a [[Submarine]] made to resemble a [[penguin]], and their three [[pirate]] henchmen (Bluebeard, Morgan and Quetch). It is revealed the yacht was really a projection. When The Dynamic Duo return to a buoy concealing a projector, they are trapped on the buoy by a magnet and targeted by torpedoes. They use a radio-detonator to destroy two of the missiles, and a porpoise sacrifices itself to intercept the last one. Catwoman, disguised as [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] journalist "Miss Kitka", helps the group kidnap Bruce Wayne and pretends to be kidnapped with him, as part of a plot to lure Batman and finish him off with another of Penguin's explosive animals (not knowing that Wayne is Batman's alter-ego). After Wayne escapes captivity, Penguin disguises himself as the Commodore and schemes his way into the [[Batcave]] along with five dehydrated henchmen. This plan fails when the henchmen unexpectedly disappear into [[Antimatter]] once struck: Penguin mistakenly rehydrated them with [[heavy water]] contaminated with [[radioactive waste]], as it was regularly used to recharge the Batcave's [[atomic pile]].

Ultimately the Duo are unable to prevent the [[kidnapping]] of the [[dehydrate]]d [[United Nations Security Council|United World Organization's Security Council]]. Giving chase in the [[Batboat]] to retrieve them (and Miss Kitka, presumed by the duo as still captive), Robin uses a [[sound|sonic]] [[charge (physics)|charge]] weapon to disable Penguin's submarine and force it to surface, where a fist fight ensues. Although Batman and Robin win the fight, Batman is heartbroken to find out that his "true love" Miss Kitka is actually Catwoman when her mask falls off. Commodore Schmidlapp accidentally breaks the vials containing the powdered Council members, mixing them together.

Batman sets to work, constructing an elaborate filter to separate the mingled dust. Robin asks him whether it might be in the world's best interests for them to alter the dust samples, so that humans can no longer harm one another. In response, Batman says that they cannot do so, reminding Robin of the fate of Penguin's henchmen and their tainted rehydration, and can only hope for people in general to learn to live together peacefully on their own.

With the world watching, the [[Security Council]] is re-hydrated. All of the members are restored alive and well, continuing to squabble among themselves and totally oblivious of their surroundings, but each of them now speaks the language and displays the stereotypical mannerisms of a nation other than their own. Batman quietly expresses his sincere hope to Robin that this "mixing of minds" does more good than it does harm. The duo quietly leave [[United Nations Headquarters|United World Headquarters]] by climbing out of the window.

The film includes most members of the original TV cast: the actors for Batman, Robin, Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, Chief O'Hara, Aunt Harriet, the Joker, the Penguin and the Riddler all reprised their roles. Though [[Julie Newmar]] played the Catwoman in the TV series, she had other commitments at that time<ref>Garcia, Bob, "Batman: Catwoman," ''[[Cinefantastique]]'', Vol. 26, #6/Vol. 7, #1 (double issue), February 1994, p. 19 (interview with Julie Newmar).</ref> and was replaced by Lee Meriwether in the film. Meriwether stated in an interview that Newmar had hurt her back and was unable to take on the role.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

In his autobiography, Adam West writes of his asking for more money to do the film and that the producers countered with the fact that another actor would be hired. ''Batman'' was Reginald Denny's final appearance in film. [[Jack LaLanne]] has a cameo as a man on a roof top with girls.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kiddiematinee.com/b-batman.html |title=BATMAN (1966, U.S.) |publisher=Kiddiematinee.com |date=|accessdate=2011-01-31| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20101220084913/http://kiddiematinee.com/b-batman.html| archivedate=20 December 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl=no}}</ref>

==Production==
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2010}}
[[William Dozier]] wanted to make a big-screen film to generate interest in his proposed [[Batman]] TV series, to have the feature in theaters while the first season of the series was rolling before the cameras.  The studio, [[20th Century Fox]], refused because while a network would have to cover the entire cost of a movie, they would only have to share the cost of a TV series (a much less risky proposition).<ref>Garcia, Bob, "Batman: Making the Original Movie", ''[[Cinefantastique]]'', Volume 24, #6/Vol. 25, #1 (double issue), February 1994, p. 55.</ref> So it was not filmed until the end of the first season of ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' the TV series (between April 25 and May 31, 1966 at an estimated $1,377,800).

Portions of the film, including the sequence where Batman desperately tries to dispose of a live bomb, were filmed at waterfront locations in [[Santa Barbara, California]].

The film featured many characters from the show, was written by series writer [[Lorenzo Semple, Jr.]], and directed by [[Leslie H. Martinson]] (who won a [[Giffoni Film Festival|Golden Gryphon]]). Martinson had directed a pair of the television series episodes; "The Penguin Goes Straight" and "Not Yet, He Ain't", both from season one.

===Tone===
Like the television series, the movie featured saturated colors, [[camp (style)|campy]] [[dialogue]] and special effects, and exaggeration in acting performances, as well as the occasional breaking of the [[fourth wall]], effectively being a [[tongue-in-cheek]] [[parody]]. It also began with a dedication to law enforcement members and 'lovers of action films.' Another line in the outset of the film goes "If we missed mentioning any other groups of lovers, we're sorry", this following a quick spotlight on a kissing couple. 

Though it is often described (like many contemporary shows) as a parody of a popular comic-book character, some commentators believe that its comedy is not so tightly confined. Some commentators felt the film's depiction of the Caped Crusader "captured the feel of the contemporary comics perfectly".<ref>[http://www.stomptokyo.com/movies/batman-66.html Stomp Tokyo Video Reviews - Batman (1966)]. Retrieved 2011-01-14.</ref> The film was, they remind us, made at a time when "the Batman of the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age comics]] was already essentially neutered".<ref name="Groucho">[http://www.grouchoreviews.com/reviews/2125 GrouchoReviews.com Review of 'Batman']</ref>

Certain elements verge into direct parody of the history of Batman. The movie, like the TV series, is strongly influenced by the comparatively obscure 1940s serials of Batman, such as the escapes done almost out of luck.<ref name="Groucho" /> The penchant for giving devices a "Bat-" prefix, and the dramatic use of stylized title cards during fight scenes, acknowledge some of the conventions that the character had accumulated in various media. However, the majority of ''Batman''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> campier moments can be read as a broader parody on contemporary mid-1960s culture in general.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/B/htmlB/batman/batman.htm |title=Museum of Broadcast Communication's entry on the parent TV show |publisher=Museum.TV |accessdate=2010-12-25}}</ref>

Furthermore, the movie represented Batman's first major foray into [[Cold War]] issues, paying heavy attention to Polaris Missiles, war surplus submarines and also taking a poke at the Pentagon. The inclusion of a glory-hunting presidential character and the unfavorable portrayal of Security Council Members marked Batman's first attempts to poke fun at domestic and international politics.<ref>Batman at 45: A Milestone Tribute to Pow, Bam and Zap!, Chris Gould, 2011</ref>

===Vehicles===
[[File:1960s Batmobile (FMC).jpg|thumb|right|The Batmobile as seen in the 1960s ''Batman'' TV series. Photo by [[Jennifer Graylock]]]]
Besides the [[Batmobile]], other vehicles used by The Dynamic Duo include:
*[[Batcycle]] with side car
*[[Batboat]], provided by [[Glastron]]
*[[Batcopter]]

Of the three new Batvehicles which first appeared in the ''Batman'' film, only the [[Batcycle]] properly crossed over into the [[Batman (TV series)|TV series]], as the budgetary limits of the TV series precluded the full use of the others. While the [[Batcopter]] and [[Batboat]] from the movie did appear briefly in episodes (including a use of the Batboat in the conclusion of the first post-film two-parter: "[[Walk the Straight and Narrow]]"), they primarily appeared in the form of stock-footage scenes from the film intercut into the series.

==Release==
The 105-minute ''Batman'' opened at [[The Paramount Theatre (Austin, Texas)|the Paramount Theatre]] in [[Austin, Texas]] on Saturday, July 30, 1966 (between the first and second seasons of the [[Batman (TV series)|TV series]]); it was moderately successful at the box office. The [[Batboat]] featured in the film was created by Austin-based company [[Glastron]], whose payment was in having the film premiere in their hometown. In conjunction with the premiere, [[Jean Boone]] of Austin CBS affiliate station [[KTBC]] interviewed the film's cast, including [[Lee Meriwether]], [[Cesar Romero]], and [[Adam West]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Jean Boone - Interview with Cast of Batman, The Movie (1966)|url=http://www.texasarchive.org/library/index.php?title=Jean_Boone_-_Interview_with_Cast_of_Batman%2C_The_Movie_%281966%29&gsearch=batman|work=Gordon Wilkison Collection|publisher=Texas Archive of the Moving Image|accessdate=28 July 2011|date=July 1966}}</ref>

The film was released on VHS in 1985 by [[CBS/Fox Video|Playhouse Video]], in 1989 by [[CBS/Fox Video]], and in 1994 by [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment|Fox Video]]. On August 21, 2001 this film was released on [[DVD]]{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}; it was re-released July 1, 2008 on DVD and on [[Blu-ray]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Batman-The-Movie-Blu-ray/789/ |title=Batman The Movie Blu-ray: Special Edition |publisher=Blu-ray.com |date=|accessdate=2012-04-14}}</ref>

==Reception==
''Batman: The Movie'' has received more positive than negative reviews over the years, with an average rating from all critics of 6.2/10 and 79% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] (the average audience rating has been 3/5, with only 52% indicating they "liked it").<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/batman_the_movie/ | title=Batman: The Movie | publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate=2012-10-13}}</ref> Bill Gibron of Filmcritic.com gave the film 3 out of 5 stars: "Unlike other attempts at bringing these characters to life...the TV cast really captures the inherent insanity of the roles."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/reviews/Batman-%281966%29 |title=AMC Filmcritic – Batman (1966) Review |publisher=Filmcritic.com |accessdate=2010-12-25}}</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine stated on their review that "the intense innocent enthusiasm of Cesar Romero, Burgess Meredith and Frank Gorshin as the three criminals is balanced against the innocent calm of Adam West and Burt Ward, Batman and Robin respectively."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117788898.html?categoryid=31&cs=1 |title=Variety Reviews - Batman - Film Reviews |publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' |date=1965-12-31 |accessdate=2010-12-25}}</ref>
