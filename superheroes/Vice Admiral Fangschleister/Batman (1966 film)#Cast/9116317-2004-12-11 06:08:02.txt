It starred [[Adam West]] as [[Batman]] and [[Burt Ward]] as Robin. Filmed at the end of season one of the [[Batman (1960s TV series)|''Batman'' TV series]] of the 1960s, it featured four main criminals from the show, including [[The Joker]], [[The Riddler]], [[The Penguin]], and [[Catwoman]].

==Plot summary==

When Batman ([[Adam West|West]]) and Robin ([[Burt Ward|Ward]]) get a tip that Commodore Schmidlapp is in danger aboard his yacht, they launch a rescue mission. After a tangle with an exploding shark, Batman and Robin head back to Commissioner Gordon's office where, by case of deduction and wisdom, they figure out that that the tip was a set-up by four of the most powerful villains ever, who seek to defeat the Dynamic Duo once and for all.
Armed with a dehydrator that can turn humans into dust, and a Navy surplus nuclear submarine, the fearsome foursome intends to take over the world!
