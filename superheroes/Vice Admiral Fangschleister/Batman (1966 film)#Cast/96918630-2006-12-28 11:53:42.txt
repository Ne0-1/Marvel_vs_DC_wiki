''For the 1989 version starring [[Michael Keaton]], see:'' [[Batman (1989 film)]].

'''''Batman''''' is a 1966 film spin-off of the popular [[Batman television series]], and was the first full-length theatrical adaptation of the [[DC Comics]] character.  It later acquired the video-box title '''''Batman: The Movie'''''.  The [[20th Century Fox]] release starred [[Adam West]] as Batman and [[Burt Ward]] as Robin. 

==History==
Filmed at the end of season one of the ABC [[primetime]] [[Batman (1960s TV series)|''Batman'' TV series]] of the 1960s (between [[April 25]] and [[May 31]], [[1966]] at an estimated $1,377,800), it featured four main criminals from the show, including the "clown prince of crime" [[Joker (comics)|The Joker]] ([[Cesar Romero]]), that "count of criminal conundrums" [[Riddler (comics)|The Riddler]] ([[Frank Gorshin]]), that "pompous, waddling master of fowl play" [[Penguin (comics)|The Penguin]] ([[Burgess Meredith]]), and the "fiendish feline" [[Catwoman|The Catwoman]] ([[Lee Meriwether]]).  It was written by [[Lorenzo Semple Jr.]], and directed by [[Leslie H. Martinson]], who won a [[Golden Gryphon]] for his efforts.  

The 105-minute ''Batman'' opened at [[Paramount Theatre, The (Austin, Texas)|The Paramount Theatre]] in [[Austin, Texas]] on Saturday, [[July 30]], [[1966]] (between the first and second seasons of the [[Batman (1960s TV series)|TV series]]). Like the television series, the movie featured saturated colors, [[camp (style)|campy]] [[dialogue]] and special effects, and over-exaggeration in acting performances, effectively being a [[tongue-in-cheek]] [[parody]].  The movie was moderately successful at the box office.

==Plot summary==
{{spoiler}}
When Batman ([[Adam West|West]]) and Robin ([[Burt Ward|Ward]]) get a tip that Commodore Schmidlapp is in danger aboard his yacht, they launch a rescue mission. After a tangle with an exploding shark, Batman and Robin head back to Commissioner Gordon's office where, by case of deduction and wisdom, they figure out that the tip was a set-up by four of the most powerful villains ever (Joker, Penguin, Riddler and Catwoman), who seek to defeat the Dynamic Duo once and for all.

Armed with a dehydrator that can turn humans into dust, and a Navy surplus submarine, the "fearsome foursome" intends to take over the world, and Batman and Robin must stop them. Catwoman romantically lures Bruce Wayne into a trap, and Penguin even schemes his way into the Batcave, leaving the Duo unable to prevent the kidnapping of the dehydrated United World Security Council.

==Trivia==
* Besides the [[Batmobile]], other vehicles used by The Dynamic Duo:
** [[Batcopter]]
** [[Batcycle]] with side car
** [[Batboat]], provided by [[Glastron]]

* Of the three new Batvehicles which first appeared in the ''Batman'' movie, only the [[Batcycle]] crossed over into the ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' TV series, as the budgetary limits of the TV series precluded the use of the others. Instead, snippets of the [[Batcopter]] and [[Batboat]] from the movie were stitched into episodes of the TV series.

* It's clear that actor [[Cesar Romero]], who played [[The Joker]], refused to shave off his moustache, as you can see it under his white make-up in certain scenes.

* Director Leslie H. Martinson also directed a pair of ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' episodes; "The Penguin Goes Straight" and "Not Yet, He Ain't," both from season one.

* Commodore Schmidlapp would end up being the final role for actor Reginald Denny, who died of cancer the year after the movie was released.

* Of the four main villain actors in this film, only [[Lee Meriwether]] survives [[as of 2006]]. [[Cesar Romero]] passed away in [[1994]], [[Burgess Meredith]] in [[1997]], and [[Frank Gorshin]] in [[2005]].
