'''''Batman''''', often promoted as '''''Batman: The Movie''''', is a 1966 film based on [[Batman (TV series)|the television series]] and the first full-length theatrical adaptation of the [[DC Comics]] [[Batman|character of the same name]]. Released by [[20th Century Fox]], the film starred [[Adam West]] as Batman and [[Burt Ward]] as [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]. The film was directed by [[Leslie H. Martinson]], who also directed a pair of ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' episodes; "The Penguin Goes Straight" and "Not Yet, He Ain't", both from season one.

The cast includes members of the original TV cast, including [[Alan Napier]], [[Neil Hamilton (actor)|Neil Hamilton]], [[Stafford Repp]] and [[Madge Blake]]. Appearing as the criminal characters that they played on TV (and given the name the Rogues Gallery of Villains) are [[Frank Gorshin]] as the Riddler, [[Burgess Meredith]] as the Penguin, and [[Cesar Romero]] as the Joker. [[Julie Newmar]], who left the movie before production started to do other work, is replaced with [[Lee Meriwether]] as Catwoman.

==Plot==
When Batman ([[Adam West|West]]) and Robin ([[Burt Ward|Ward]]) get a tip that Commodore Schmidlapp (the final role of actor [[Reginald Denny (actor)|Reginald Denny]]) is in danger aboard his [[yacht]], they launch a rescue mission using the [[Batcopter]]. After a tangle with an exploding shark, Batman and Robin head back to Commissioner Gordon's office where, through deduction and wisdom, they figure out that the tip was a set-up by The United Underworld, a gathering of four of the most powerful villains in [[Gotham City]] (Joker, Penguin, Riddler and Catwoman), who plan to defeat The Dynamic Duo once and for all.

Armed with a dehydrator that can turn humans into dust, a [[World War II]] "Pre-Atomic" Submarine made to resemble a [[penguin]], and their three [[pirate]] henchmen (Bluebeard, Morgan and Quetch), The United Underworld intends to take over the world, and Batman and Robin must stop them. Catwoman, disguised as the Soviet journalist "Miss KITKA" (short for Kitanya Irenia Tatanya Kerenska Alisoff), lures Bruce Wayne into a trap, little suspecting that Wayne is Batman's alter-ego, and Penguin even schemes his way into the [[Batcave]], leaving the Duo unable to prevent the [[kidnapping]] of the [[dehydrate]]d [[United Nations Security Council|United World Organization's Security Council]].

After giving chase in the [[Batboat]], the Caped Crusader and Boy Wonder use a [[sound|sonic]] [[charge (physics)|charge]] weapon called "Bat-Charges" to disable Penguin's submarine and bring it to the [[surface]], where a grand fist fight ensues. Although Commodore Schmidlapp sneezes on and scatters the powdered members of the dehydrated Council, mixing them together &ndash; which would normally spell their doom &ndash; Batman constructs an elaborate filter to separate the mingled dust.

Prior to this process, Robin asks Batman if it might not be in the world's best interests for them to alter the dust samples so that humans can no longer harm one another. In response, Batman says that they cannot do so and can only hope for people, in general, to learn to live together peacefully on their own.

However, in the final scene, Robin's wishes are ironically fulfilled when the [[Security Council]] is improperly re-hydrated. While all of the members are alive and well, continuing to squabble among themselves and totally oblivious of their surroundings, each of them now speaks a completely different language than their original native tongue. As the world looks on in disbelief at this development, Batman and Robin quietly climb out of the [[United Nations Headquarters|United World Headquarters]] to an uncertain future. Batman's final words express his sincere hope that this "mixing of minds" does more good than it does harm.

Though [[Julie Newmar]] played the Catwoman in the TV series, she had other commitments at that time<ref>Garcia, Bob, "Batman: Catwoman," ''[[Cinefantastique]]'', Vol. 26, #6/Vol. 7, #1 (double issue), February 1994, p. 19 (interview with Julie Newmar).</ref> and was replaced by Lee Meriwether in this movie. In his autobiography, Adam West writes of his asking for more money to do the film and that the producers countered with the fact that another actor would be hired.

==Production==
{{Refimprovesect|date=March 2010}}
[[William Dozier]] wanted to make a big-screen film to generate interest in his proposed [[Batman]] TV series, to have the feature in theaters while the first season of the series was rolling before the cameras. The studio, [[20th Century Fox]], refused because while a network would have to cover the entire cost of a movie, they would only have to share the cost of a TV series (a much less risky proposition).<ref>Garcia, Bob, "Batman: Making the Original Movie", ''[[Cinefantastique]]'', Volume 24, #6/Vol. 25, #1 (double issue), February 1994, p. 55.</ref> So it was not filmed until the end of the first season of ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' the TV series (between April 25 and May 31, 1966 at an estimated $1,377,800). This movie featured four criminals from the show, including the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] ([[Cesar Romero]]), [[Riddler]] ([[Frank Gorshin]]), [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]] ([[Burgess Meredith]]), and [[Catwoman]] ([[Lee Meriwether]]). It was written by series writer [[Lorenzo Semple, Jr.]] and directed by series director [[Leslie H. Martinson]], who won a [[Giffoni Film Festival|Golden Gryphon]].

===Tone===
Like the television series, the movie featured saturated colors, [[camp (style)|campy]] [[dialogue]] and special effects, and exaggeration in acting performances, as well as the occasional breaking of the [[fourth wall]], effectively being a [[tongue-in-cheek]] [[parody]].

Though it is often described (like many contemporary shows) as a parody of a popular comic-book character, some commentators believe that its comedy is not so tightly confined. Some commentators felt the film's depiction of the Caped Crusader "captured the feel of the contemporary comics perfectly".<ref>[http://www.stomptokyo.com/movies/batman-66.html stomptokyo.com review 2002].</ref> The film was, they remind us, made at a time when "the Batman of the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age comics]] was already essentially neutered".<ref name=groucho>[http://www.grouchoreviews.com/index.php?module=Movie_Reviews&func=display&id=2125 grouchoreviews.com review of ''Batman''.]{{dead link|date=December 2010}}</ref>

Certain elements verge into direct parody of the history of Batman. The movie, like the TV series, is strongly influenced by the comparatively obscure 1940s serials of Batman, such as the escapes done almost out of luck.<ref name=groucho/> The penchant for giving devices a "Bat-" prefix, and the dramatic use of stylized title cards during fight scenes, acknowledge some of the conventions that the character had accumulated in various media. However, the majority of ''Batman''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> campier moments can be read as a broader parody on contemporary mid-1960s culture in general.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/B/htmlB/batman/batman.htm |title=Museum of Broadcast Communication's entry on the parent TV show |publisher=Museum.tv |date= |accessdate=2010-12-25}}</ref>

===Vehicles===
[[Image:1960s Batmobile (FMC).jpg|thumb|right|The Batmobile as seen in the 1960s ''Batman'' TV series.]]
Besides the [[Batmobile]], other vehicles used by The Dynamic Duo:
*[[Batcycle]] with side car
*[[Batboat]], provided by Glastron
*[[Batcopter]]
Of the three new Batvehicles which first appeared in the ''Batman'' movie, only the [[Batcycle]] crossed over into the ''[[Batman (TV series)|TV series]]'', as the budgetary limits of the TV series precluded the use of the others. Instead, snippets of the [[Batcopter]] and [[Batboat]] from the movie were stitched into episodes.

==Release==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2010}}
The 105-minute ''Batman'' opened at [[The Paramount Theatre (Austin, Texas)|The Paramount Theatre]] in [[Austin, Texas]] on Saturday, July 30, 1966 (between the first and second seasons of the [[Batman (TV series)|TV series]]); it was moderately successful at the box office.

The movie later had its nationwide television debut as ''[[The ABC Sunday Night Movie]]'', at 9:00 Eastern/8:00 Central, on July 4, 1971.

The film was in released on VHS in 1985 by [[CBS/Fox Video|Playhouse Video]], in 1989 by [[CBS/Fox Video]], and in 1994 by [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment|Fox Video]]. On August 21, 2001 this film was released on DVD; it was re-released July 1, 2008 on DVD and on Blu-ray for the 42nd anniversary of the film's release and to take advantage of ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight's]]'' release on July 18. The Blu-ray added several features in addition to those found on the original DVD, however the 2008 DVD is identical to the 2001 release, except for the disk artwork, which had a darker feel than the 2001 release and did not include Robin, probably to tie in with ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]''.

==Reception==
''Batman: The Movie'' has received positive reviews over the years, with an 82% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/batman_the_movie/ | title=Batman: The Movie | publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref> Bill Gibron of Filmcritic.com gave the film 3 out of 5 stars and commented that "unlike other attempts at bringing these characters to life...the TV cast really captures the inherent insanity of the roles."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/reviews/Batman-%281966%29 |title=AMC Filmcritic – Batman (1966) Review |publisher=Filmcritic.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-25}}</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine stated on their review that "the intense innocent enthusiasm of Cesar Romero, Burgess Meredith and Frank Gorshin as the three criminals is balanced against the innocent calm of Adam West and Burt Ward, Batman and Robin respectively."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117788898.html?categoryid=31&cs=1 |title=– Batman Review |publisher=Variety.com |date=1965-12-31 |accessdate=2010-12-25}}</ref>
