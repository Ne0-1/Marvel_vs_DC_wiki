'''''Batman''''' (also known as its video-box title '''''Batman: The Movie''''') is a [[1966 in film|1966]] film spin-off of the popular [[Batman (TV series)|''Batman'' television series]], and was the first full-length theatrical adaptation of the [[DC Comics]] character. The [[20th Century Fox]] release starred [[Adam West]] as Batman and [[Burt Ward]] as Robin. 

The film was directed by Leslie H. Martinson who also directed a pair of ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' episodes; "The Penguin Goes Straight" and "Not Yet, He Ain't," both from season one.

As is the case (albeit reversed) with the [[1989 in film|1989]] [[Batman (1989 film)|''Batman'' film]] (with [[Michael Keaton]] and [[Jack Nicholson]]), ''Batman: The Movie'' is often referred to as '''''Batman '66''''' by fans, so as not to cause confusion.

==History==
Filmed at the end of the first season of ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' (between [[April 25]] and [[May 31]], [[1966]] at an estimated $1,377,800), it featured four main criminals from the show, including the "clown prince of crime" [[Joker (comics)|The Joker]] ([[Cesar Romero]]), that "count of criminal conundrums" [[Riddler (comics)|The Riddler]] ([[Frank Gorshin]]), that "pompous, waddling master of fowl play" [[Penguin (comics)|The Penguin]] ([[Burgess Meredith]]), and the "fiendish feline" [[Catwoman|The Catwoman]] ([[Lee Meriwether]]).  It was written by series writer [[Lorenzo Semple Jr.]] and directed by series director [[Leslie H. Martinson]], who won a [[Giffoni Film Festival|Golden Gryphon]] for his efforts, and is less well remembered for directing a large number of less notable movies such as [[PT 109 (film)|''PT 109'']] and ''[[Rescue from Gilligan's Island]]''.  

The 105-minute ''Batman'' opened at [[Paramount Theatre, The (Austin, Texas)|The Paramount Theatre]] in [[Austin, Texas]] on Saturday, [[July 30]], [[1966]] (between the first and second seasons of the [[Batman (1960s TV series)|TV series]]). Like the television series, the movie featured saturated colors, [[camp (style)|campy]] [[dialogue]] and special effects, and over-exaggeration in acting performances, effectively being a [[tongue-in-cheek]] [[parody]].  The movie was moderately successful at the box office.

==Plot summary==
When Batman ([[Adam West|West]]) and Robin ([[Burt Ward|Ward]]) get a tip that Commodore Schmidlapp (the final role of actor [[Reginald Denny (actor)|Reginald Denny]]) is in danger aboard his yacht, they launch a rescue mission using the Batcopter. After a tangle with an exploding shark, Batman and Robin head back to Commissioner Gordon's office where, by case of deduction and wisdom, they figure out that the tip was a set-up by four of the most powerful villains ever (Joker, Penguin, Riddler and Catwoman), who unite to defeat the Dynamic Duo once and for all.

Armed with a dehydrator that can turn humans into dust, a Navy surplus submarine, and their three pirate henchmen (Bluebeard, Morgan and Quetch), the "fearsome foursome" intends to take over the world, and Batman and Robin must stop them. Catwoman romantically lures Bruce Wayne into a trap, unaware that Wayne is Batman's alter-ego, and Penguin even schemes his way into the Batcave, leaving the Duo unable to prevent the kidnapping of the dehydrated United World Security Council.

After giving chase in the Batboat, the Caped Crusader and Boy Wonder use a sonic charge weapon to disable Penguin's submarine and bring it to the surface, where a grand fistfight ensues. Although the powdered members of the dehydrated Council are mixed together -- which would normally spell their doom -- Batman constructs an elaborate filter to return each of them to life.  

Prior to this process, Robin asks Batman if it might not be in the world's best interests, with continued problems of overt racism, especially in the U.S. during the 1960s, for them to alter the dust samples so that humans can no longer harm one another.  In response, Batman says that they cannot do so and can only hope for people, in general, to learn to live together peacefully on their own.

However, in the final scene, Robin's wishes are ironically fulfilled when the Security Council is improperly re-hydrated.  While all of the members are alive and well, continuing to squabble among themselves and totally oblivious of their surroundings, each of them now speaks a completely different language than their original native tongue.  As the world looks on in disbelief at this development, Batman and Robin quietly climb out of the United World Headquarters to an uncertain future.  Batman's final words express his sincere hope that this "mixing of minds" does more good than it does harm.

==Cast==
Though Julie Newmar played the Catwoman to great acclaim in the TV series, she could not get out of the movie'' [[Mackenna's Gold]]'' and thus Lee Meriwether plays the Catwoman in this movie.

Of the three new Batvehicles which first appeared in the ''Batman'' movie, only the [[Batcycle]] crossed over into the ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' TV series, as the budgetary limits of the TV series precluded the use of the others. Instead, snippets of the [[Batcopter]] and [[Batboat]] from the movie were stitched into episodes of the TV series.
