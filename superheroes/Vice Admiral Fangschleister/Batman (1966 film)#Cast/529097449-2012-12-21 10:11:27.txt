'''''Batman''''', often promoted as '''''Batman: The Movie''''', is a 1966 film based on the ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series, and the first full-length theatrical adaptation of the [[DC Comics]] [[Batman]]. Released by [[20th Century Fox]], the film starred [[Adam West]] as Batman and [[Burt Ward]] as [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]. The film was directed by [[Leslie H. Martinson]], who also directed a pair of the television series episodes; "The Penguin Goes Straight" and "Not Yet, He Ain't", both from season one.

The cast includes members of the original TV cast, including [[Alan Napier]] as the Wayne Manor butler Alfred Pennyworth, [[Neil Hamilton (actor)|Neil Hamilton]] as Commissioner Gordon, [[Stafford Repp]] as Chief O'Hara and [[Madge Blake]] as Aunt Harriet. Appearing as the criminal characters that they played on TV (and given the name the Rogues Gallery of Villains) are [[Cesar Romero]] as the Joker, [[Burgess Meredith]] as the Penguin, and [[Frank Gorshin]] as the Riddler. [[Julie Newmar]], who left the movie before production started in order to do other work, is replaced by [[Lee Meriwether]] as Catwoman. Lee Meriwether stated in an interview that Julie Newmar had hurt her back and was unable to do the feature film.

==Plot==
When Batman ([[Adam West|West]]) and Robin ([[Burt Ward|Ward]]) get a tip that Commodore Schmidlapp (the final role of actor [[Reginald Denny (actor)|Reginald Denny]]) is in danger aboard his [[yacht]], they launch a rescue mission using the [[Batcopter]]. After a tangle with an exploding shark which seizes Batman's leg but is repelled by Shark Repellent Bat-Spray after the Yacht disappears, Batman and Robin head back to Commissioner Gordon's office where, through deduction and wisdom, they figure out that the tip was a set-up by The United Underworld, a gathering of four of the most powerful villains in [[Gotham City]] (Joker, Penguin, Riddler and Catwoman), who plan to defeat The Dynamic Duo once and for all, and take over the entire world. 

The United Underworld equip themselves with a dehydrator that can turn humans into dust (an invention of Commodore Schmidlapp, who is unaware he has been kidnapped by the felonious foursome), a [[World War II]] "Pre-Atomic" Submarine made to resemble a [[penguin]], and their three [[pirate]] henchmen (Bluebeard, Morgan and Quetch), and Batman and Robin must stop them. It is revealed the ship was really a projection. When The Dynamic Duo return to the buoy via The [[Batboat]] with the projector on it, they are trapped on it by a magnet and torpedoes are launched at them, but they escape using a radio-detonator to destroy two of the missiles, and a porpoise is hit by the last one. Catwoman, disguised as the Soviet journalist "Miss KITKA" (short for Kitanya Irenia Tatanya Kerenska Alisoff), lures Bruce Wayne into a trap as part of a plot to destroy Batman, little suspecting that Wayne is Batman's alter-ego. And Penguin, disguised as the Commodore even schemes his way into the [[Batcave]] along with five dehydrated henchmen; this plan fails when the henchmen  unexpectedly disappear into [[Antimatter]] when Penguin mistakenly rehydrates them with [[heavy water]] [[contaminated]] with [[radioactive waste]], regularly used to recharge the Batcave's atomic pile.

Ultimately the Duo are unable to prevent the [[kidnapping]] of the [[dehydrate]]d [[United Nations Security Council|United World Organization's Security Council]]. After giving chase in the [[Batboat]], the Caped Crusader and Boy Wonder use a [[sound|sonic]] [[charge (physics)|charge]] weapon called "Bat-Charges" to disable Penguin's submarine and bring it to the [[surface]], where a grand fist fight ensues. Although Batman and Robin win the fight, Batman is heartbroken to find out that his "true love" Miss Kitka is actually Catwoman when she trips and her mask falls off. Although Commodore Schmidlapp sneezes on and scatters the powdered members of the dehydrated Council, mixing them together &ndash; which would normally spell their doom &ndash; Batman constructs an elaborate filter to separate the mingled dust.

Robin poses the question whether it might not be in the world's best interests for them to alter the dust samples so that humans can no longer harm one another. In response, Batman says that they cannot do so—in reminder of the fate of Penguin's five henchmen's tainted rehydration—and can only hope for people, in general, to learn to live together peacefully on their own.

However, in the final scene, Robin's wishes are ironically fulfilled when the [[Security Council]] is improperly re-hydrated. All of the members are alive and well, continuing to squabble among themselves and totally oblivious of their surroundings. But each of them now speaks the language and displays the stereotypical mannerisms of a nation other than their own. As the world looks on in disbelief at this development, Batman and Robin quietly climb out of the [[United Nations Headquarters|United World Headquarters]] to an uncertain future. Batman's final words express his sincere hope that this "mixing of minds" does more good than it does harm. The Fins shows "The Living{?} End"

==Production==
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2010}}
[[William Dozier]] wanted to make a big-screen film to generate interest in his proposed [[Batman]] TV series, to have the feature in theaters while the first season of the series was rolling before the cameras.  The studio, [[20th Century Fox]], refused because while a network would have to cover the entire cost of a movie, they would only have to share the cost of a TV series (a much less risky proposition).<ref>Garcia, Bob, "Batman: Making the Original Movie", ''[[Cinefantastique]]'', Volume 24, #6/Vol. 25, #1 (double issue), February 1994, p. 55.</ref> So it was not filmed until the end of the first season of ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' the TV series (between April 25 and May 31, 1966 at an estimated $1,377,800).

Portions of the film, including the sequence where Batman desperately tries to dispose of a live bomb, were filmed at waterfront locations in [[Santa Barbara, California]].

This movie featured four criminals from the show, including the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] ([[Cesar Romero]]), [[Riddler]] ([[Frank Gorshin]]), [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]] ([[Burgess Meredith]]), and [[Catwoman]] ([[Lee Meriwether]]). It was written by series writer [[Lorenzo Semple, Jr.]] and directed by series director [[Leslie H. Martinson]], who won a [[Giffoni Film Festival|Golden Gryphon]].

===Tone===
Like the television series, the movie featured saturated colors, [[camp (style)|campy]] [[dialogue]] and special effects, and exaggeration in acting performances, as well as the occasional breaking of the [[fourth wall]], effectively being a [[tongue-in-cheek]] [[parody]]. It also began with a dedication to law enforcement members and 'lovers of action films.' Another line in the outset of the film goes "If we missed mentioning any other groups of lovers, we're sorry", this following a quick spotlight on a kissing couple. 

Though it is often described (like many contemporary shows) as a parody of a popular comic-book character, some commentators believe that its comedy is not so tightly confined. Some commentators felt the film's depiction of the Caped Crusader "captured the feel of the contemporary comics perfectly".<ref>[http://www.stomptokyo.com/movies/batman-66.html Stomp Tokyo Video Reviews - Batman (1966)]. Retrieved 2011-01-14.</ref> The film was, they remind us, made at a time when "the Batman of the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age comics]] was already essentially neutered".<ref name=Groucho>[http://www.grouchoreviews.com/index.php?module=Movie_Reviews&func=display&id=2125 GrouchoReviews.com Review of 'Batman'].{{dead link|date=December 2010}}</ref>

Certain elements verge into direct parody of the history of Batman. The movie, like the TV series, is strongly influenced by the comparatively obscure 1940s serials of Batman, such as the escapes done almost out of luck.<ref name=Groucho/> The penchant for giving devices a "Bat-" prefix, and the dramatic use of stylized title cards during fight scenes, acknowledge some of the conventions that the character had accumulated in various media. However, the majority of ''Batman''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> campier moments can be read as a broader parody on contemporary mid-1960s culture in general.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/B/htmlB/batman/batman.htm |title=Museum of Broadcast Communication's entry on the parent TV show |publisher=Museum.TV |accessdate=2010-12-25}}</ref>

Furthermore, the movie represented Batman's first major foray into cold war issues, paying heavy attention to Polaris Missiles, war surplus submarines and also taking a poke at the Pentagon. The inclusion of a glory-hunting presidential character and the unfavorable portrayal of Security Council Members mark Batman's first attempts to poke fun at domestic and international politics.

===Vehicles===
[[Image:1960s Batmobile (FMC).jpg|thumb|right|The Batmobile as seen in the 1960s ''Batman'' TV series.]]
Besides the [[Batmobile]], other vehicles used by The Dynamic Duo include:
*[[Batcycle]] with side car
*[[Batboat]], provided by [[Glastron]]
*[[Batcopter]]

Of the three new Batvehicles which first appeared in the ''Batman'' film, only the [[Batcycle]] properly crossed over into the [[Batman (TV series)|TV series]], as the budgetary limits of the TV series precluded the full use of the others. Whilst the [[Batcopter]] and [[Batboat]] from the movie did appear briefly in episodes (including a use of the Batboat in the conclusion of the first post-film two-parter: "[[Walk the Straight and Narrow]]"), they primarily appeared in the form of scenes from the film intercut into the series.

==Release==
The 105-minute ''Batman'' opened at [[The Paramount Theatre (Austin, Texas)|the Paramount Theatre]] in [[Austin, Texas]] on Saturday, July 30, 1966 (between the first and second seasons of the [[Batman (TV series)|TV series]]); it was moderately successful at the box office. The [[Batboat]] featured in the film was created by Austin-based company [[Glastron]], whose payment was in having the film premiere in their hometown. In conjunction with the premiere, [[Jean Boone]] of Austin CBS affiliate station [[KTBC]] interviewed the film's cast, including [[Lee Meriwether]], [[Cesar Romero]], and [[Adam West]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Jean Boone - Interview with Cast of Batman, The Movie (1966)|url=http://www.texasarchive.org/library/index.php?title=Jean_Boone_-_Interview_with_Cast_of_Batman%2C_The_Movie_%281966%29&gsearch=batman|work=Gordon Wilkison Collection|publisher=Texas Archive of the Moving Image|accessdate=28 July 2011|month=July|year=1966}}</ref>

The film was released on VHS in 1985 by [[CBS/Fox Video|Playhouse Video]], in 1989 by [[CBS/Fox Video]], and in 1994 by [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment|Fox Video]]. On August 21, 2001 this film was released on [[DVD]]{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}; it was re-released July 1, 2008 on DVD and on [[Blu-ray]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Batman-The-Movie-Blu-ray/789/ |title=Batman The Movie Blu-ray: Special Edition |publisher=Blu-ray.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-14}}</ref>

==Reception==
''Batman: The Movie'' has received more positive than negative reviews over the years, with an average rating from all critics of 6.2/10 and 78% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] (the average audience rating has been 3/5, with only 51% indicating they "liked it").<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/batman_the_movie/ | title=Batman: The Movie | publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate=2012-10-13}}</ref> Bill Gibron of Filmcritic.com gave the film 3 out of 5 stars: "Unlike other attempts at bringing these characters to life...the TV cast really captures the inherent insanity of the roles."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/reviews/Batman-%281966%29 |title=AMC Filmcritic – Batman (1966) Review |publisher=Filmcritic.com |accessdate=2010-12-25}}</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine stated on their review that "the intense innocent enthusiasm of Cesar Romero, Burgess Meredith and Frank Gorshin as the three criminals is balanced against the innocent calm of Adam West and Burt Ward, Batman and Robin respectively."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117788898.html?categoryid=31&cs=1 |title=Variety Reviews - Batman - Film Reviews |publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' |date=1965-12-31 |accessdate=2010-12-25}}</ref>
