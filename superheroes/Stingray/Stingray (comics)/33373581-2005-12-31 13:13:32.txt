'''Stingray''', is a [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]]. Created by [[Roy Thomas]] ''Tales to Astonish'' #95 as Dr. Walter Newell and in ''Sub-Mariner'' #19 as the superhero Stingray.

==Character History==
Walter Newell was an [[oceanographer]] working for the [[United States]] [[government]] who had first met and became friends with Prince [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]] when Newell supervised the construction of a domed sub-sea experimental city that would meet its demise at the hands of the Plunderer.

It was months later, when U.S. federal agent Edgar Benton requested Newell's services, or rather forced Newell to investigate the dissappearance of water from the Earth's oceans, supposedly done by [[extraterrestial|extraterrestials]], who Benton thought were in leage with Namor. Benton threatened to cut Newell's funding, so he had no other choice but go along with it, if he wanted to continue his research.

In order to effectively combat Namor, if need be, as Newell did believe Namor's innocence, he developed the Stingray armor. The idea behind the suit was based on the [[manta ray]] which earned the suit (and later Newell) the Stingray moniker. The suit would give him superhuman strength and allow him maneuverability in the waters.

So, wearing the Stingray suit, Newell confronted, and was able to subdue the Sub-Mariner and brought him in for questioning. Namor would escape, and Stingray was ordered to follow him. Namor's abilities were impaired at the time, and this allowed Stingray the chance to beat him. Nonetheless, Newell let Namor go out of respect for their friendship.

An ocean cruiser was sunk some time later by a group of Atlanteans who claimed allegiance to Namor, and so Newell as Stingray went to investigate. It turned out that it was actually the undersea barbarian [[Attuma]] who had caused the attack. Stingray would join forces with Namor and the [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] [[Triton (comics)|Triton]], and the three defeated Attuma. 

Namor had plans to make a home on the surface world, but the plan was met with resistance. In order to help his friend, Newell petitioned his [[congressman]] in order to get Namor [[amnesty]] for his past actions, but the attempt was met with failure. What Newell did succeed in, however, was helping Namor locate his human father Leonard McKenzie. McKenzie ended up a pawn for Namor's enemies to use against him, and in order to help Namor, Newell donned the Stingray armor. McKenzie was still killed however by Namor's enemies, the [[Tiger Shark (comics)|Tiger Shark]] and [[Llyra]].

After that adventure Newell moved his oceanographic facilities and research to Hydrobase, an artificial island which had previously been used by the insane [[ecologist]] Dr. Hydro, and married Diane Arliss, the sister of Tiger Shark, while becoming the base's chief caretaker. 

Although Stingray preferred to be a [[scientist]], rather than an adventurer, Newell donned the Stingray armor to assist the heroes [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] and [[Scarlet Witch]] in the adventure of the [[Serpent Crown]]. Later, Newell leased part of Hydrobase to the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] for them to use as airbase. He became an official associate of the team at that point.

At one point, [[Iron Man]] confronted Stingray, thinking that the armor was based on technology from Stark Enterprises, and as such, Iron Man's secret identity Tony Stark. As such, Iron Man tried to destroy the armor, only to find out that was impossible, as the armor was completely unrelated to Stark technology and Iron Man's suit.

Eventually, the Avengers fully moved their headquarters to Hydrobase when their mansion had been destroyed, and Newell became an unofficial member of the Avengers, contributing his oceanographic skills, but participating in several Avengers missions, till the Avengers returned to their old base. Hydrobase was destroyed however after some time, although Walter and his wife were able to escape, and have since done their research in a new private location.

Newell came back as Stingray when any and all Avengers were summoned to Avengers mansion in order to combat the threat of [[Morgan le Fay (comics)|Morgan le Fay]]. He also helped when the villain [[Kang the Conqueror]] attacked Earth.

==Powers and Abilities==
The Stingray battlesuit enhances his strength and durability to superhuman levels, which allow him to operate within the crushing pressures of the ocean depths. Naturally, his suit also allows him to breathe underwater, and its streamlined wings allow him to glide through air for great distances. The suit's chief offensive weapon is a powerful electrical discharge released through the gloves.
