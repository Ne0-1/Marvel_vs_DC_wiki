'''Stingray''', is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel universe|universe]]. He was introduced in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' #95 as Dr. Walter Newell and in ''[[Namor the Sub-Mariner|Sub-Mariner]]'' #19 as Stingray. This water-centric superhero is primarily associated with [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]] and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].

==Fictional character biography==
Walter Newell is an [[oceanographer]] working for the [[United States]] government who had first met and became friends with Prince [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]] when Newell supervised the construction of a domed sub-sea experimental city that would meet its demise at the hands of the Plunderer. It was months later, when U.S. federal agent Edgar Benton coerced Newell into investigating the disappearance of water from the Earth's oceans, supposedly done by [[extraterrestial]]s, who Benton thought were in league with Namor. Benton threatened to cut Newell's funding, so although Newell believed Namor innocent he had no choice but go along with Benton if he wanted to continue his research. 

===Stingray armor===
To combat Namor if need be, as Newell did believe Namor's innocence, he developed the Stingray armor. The design of the suit was based on the [[manta ray]] which earned the suit (and Newell) the Stingray moniker. The suit gave him superhuman strength and allowed him maneuverability in the waters. Stingray confronted and subdued the Sub-Mariner and brought him in for questioning. Namor escaped and Stingray was ordered to follow him. Namor's abilities were impaired at the time, allowing Stingray the chance to beat him. Nonetheless, Newell let Namor go out of respect for their friendship.

An ocean cruiser was sunk some time later by a group of Atlanteans who claimed allegiance to Namor. Stingray went to investigate. It was actually the undersea barbarian [[Attuma]] who had caused the attack. Stingray joined forces with Namor and the [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] [[Triton (comics)|Triton]] to defeat Attuma. Namor had plans to make a home on the surface world, but the plan was met with resistance. To help his friend, Newell petitioned his [[congressman]] to get Namor [[amnesty]] for his past actions, but was unsuccessful. Newell did succeed in helping Namor locate his human father, Leonard McKenzie. McKenzie was killed by Namor's enemies, [[Tiger Shark (comics)|Tiger Shark]] and [[Llyra]]. After that adventure Newell moved his oceanographic facilities and research to Hydrobase, an artificial island which had previously been used by the insane [[ecologist]] Dr. Hydro, and married Diane Arliss, the sister of Tiger Shark, while becoming the base's chief caretaker.

===Hydrobase===
Although Stingray preferred to be a [[scientist]], rather than an adventurer, Newell donned the Stingray armor to assist the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] and [[Scarlet Witch]] in the adventure of the [[Serpent Crown]]. Later, Newell leased part of Hydrobase to the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] for them to use as airbase. He became an official associate of the team at that point. [[Iron Man]] confronted Stingray during the [[Iron Wars]], thinking that the armor was based on technology from Stark Enterprises. Iron Man tried to destroy the armor, only to find that the armor was completely unrelated to Stark technology and Iron Man's suit. The Avengers moved their headquarters to Hydrobase when their mansion was destroyed and Newell became an unofficial member of the Avengers, contributing his oceanographic skills, but participating in several Avengers missions, till the Avengers returned to their old base. Hydrobase was destroyed however after some time, although Walter and his wife were able to escape, and have since done their research in a new private location.

Newell came back as Stingray when anyone who had ever been an Avenger was summoned to Avengers mansion to combat the threat of [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fay]]. He also helped when the villain [[Kang the Conqueror]] attacked Earth.

===Civil War===
