'''Stingray''' ('''Walter Newell''') is a [[fiction]]al [[comic book]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. He was introduced in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' #95 as Dr. Newell and in ''[[Namor|Sub-Mariner]]'' #19 as Stingray. This water-centric superhero is primarily associated with [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]] and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].

==Fictional character biography==
Walter Newell was born in [[Gloucester, Massachusetts]]. He was an [[oceanography|oceanographer]] working for the [[United States]] government who had first met and became friends with Prince [[Namor]] when Newell supervised the construction of a domed sub-sea experimental city that would meet its demise at the hands of the [[Plunderer]]. It was months later, when U.S. federal agent Edgar Benton coerced Newell into investigating the disappearance of water from the Earth's oceans, supposedly done by [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestial]]s, who Benton thought were in league with Namor. Benton threatened to cut Newell's funding, so although Newell believed Namor innocent he had no choice but go along with Benton if he wanted to continue his research. 

===Stingray armor===
To combat Namor if need be, as Newell did believe Namor's innocence, he developed the Stingray armor. The design of the suit was based on the [[manta ray]] which earned the suit (and Newell) the Stingray moniker. The suit gave him superhuman strength, flight, maneuverability in the waters, and produced electrical energy streams. Stingray confronted and subdued the Sub-Mariner and brought him in for questioning. Namor escaped and Stingray was ordered to follow him. Namor's abilities were impaired at the time, giving Stingray the chance to beat him. Nonetheless, Newell let Namor go out of respect for their friendship.

An ocean cruiser was sunk some time later by a group of [[Homo mermanus|Atlanteans]] who claimed allegiance to Namor. Stingray went to investigate. It was actually the undersea barbarian [[Attuma]] who had caused the attack. Stingray joined forces with Namor and the [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] [[Triton (comics)|Triton]] to defeat Attuma. Namor had plans to make a home on the surface world, but the plan was met with resistance. To help his friend, Newell petitioned his [[Member of Congress|congressman]] to get Namor [[amnesty]] for his past actions, but was unsuccessful. Newell did succeed in helping Namor locate his human father, Leonard McKenzie. McKenzie was killed by Namor's enemies, [[Tiger Shark (comics)|Tiger Shark]] and [[Llyra]]. After that adventure Newell moved his oceanographic facilities and research to [[Hydro-Base]], an artificial island which had previously been used by the insane [[ecology|ecologist]] Dr. Hydro, and married Diane Arliss, the sister of Tiger Shark, while becoming the base's chief caretaker.

Stingray was targeted by [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] in [[Armor Wars]] because Stark suspected the suit made use of his technology. After an easy battle and knocking the doctor unconscious, Stark realized that the armor did not have any of the parts and departed without so much as an apology.

===Hydro-Base===
Although Stingray preferred to be a [[scientist]], rather than an adventurer, Newell donned the Stingray armor to assist the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] and [[Scarlet Witch]] in the adventure of the [[Serpent Crown]]. Later, Newell leased part of Hydro-Base to the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] for them to use as airbase. He became an official associate of the team at that point. [[Iron Man]] confronted Stingray during the [[Armor Wars]], thinking that the armor was based on technology from [[Stark Industries|Stark  Enterprises]]. Iron Man tried to destroy the armor, only to find that the armor was completely unrelated to Stark technology and Iron Man's suit. The Avengers moved their headquarters to Hydro-Base when their mansion was destroyed and Newell became an unofficial member of the Avengers, contributing his oceanographic skills, but participating in several Avengers missions, till the Avengers returned to their old base. Hydro-Base was destroyed however after some time, although Walter and his wife were able to escape, and have since done their research in a new private location.

Newell came back as Stingray when anyone who had ever been an Avenger was summoned to Avengers mansion to combat the threat of [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fay]]. He also helped when the villain [[Kang the Conqueror]] attacked Earth.

===Civil War/The Initiative===
During the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]], Stingray was a member of [[Captain America]]'s Secret Avengers, opposing the [[Registration acts (comics)#2006 Superhuman Registration Act|Superhuman Registration Act]]. After Captain America's arrest and subsequent death, Stingray accepted Tony Stark's offer of a full pardon, and signed on to [[Avengers: The Initiative|The Initiative]]. Following his registration, he was assigned to undertake combat training at [[Camp Hammond]] so he can become less reliant on his armor. He acts as the base's senior swimming instructor, and also serves as a squad leader, training new recruits.

==Powers and abilities==
The Stingray battlesuit enhances his strength and durability to superhuman levels, which allow him to operate within the crushing pressures of the ocean depths. Naturally, his suit also allows him to breathe underwater, gives him enhanced swimming and its streamlined wings allow him to glide through air for great distances. The suit's chief offensive weapon is a powerful electrical discharge released through the gloves.

==Other versions==

He commands the submarine Excalibur, the vessel that takes refugees through the Infernal Gallop to Antarctica and the entrance to the [[Savage Land]], where Avalon is located. When transporting [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] and many other refugees, he is captured by [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]] and her band of pirates.{{issue}}

Walt Newell was one of the few surviving Avengers after the [[Madelyne Pryor#Alternate reality versions|Goblyn Queen]] took over NYC. He assists [[Havok (comics)|Havok]] in defending the Nexus of All Realities and then joins with [[Doc Samson]] and [[Yellowjacket (Rita DeMara)|Yellowjacket]] to form the Defenders.{{issue}} Later, he apparently dies, along with the rest of his team, in the conflict against the [[Beyonder]], [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Dracula]], and the Goblyn Queen.{{issue}}
