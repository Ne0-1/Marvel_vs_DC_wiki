'''Chondu the Mystic''', sometimes known as '''Chondu the Yogi''', is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]].

==Fictional character biography==
Chondu was born '''Harvey Schlemerman''' in West [[Kingston, Rhode Island]]. Chondu was once a sideshow magician before becoming a professional criminal.  He can cast minor magical spells and is a minor adept in the mystic arts.

In his first appearance, Chondu lectured on yoga, and sent escaped convict Joe Parker to [[Limbo (Marvel Comics)|Limbo]].<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #9</ref>

Chondu joined the [[Headmen]], and caused an insanity-inducing "black rain."<ref>''Defenders'' #21</ref> Dr. [[Gorilla-Man#Gorilla-Man (Arthur Nagan)|Arthur Nagan]] transplanted Chondu's brain into the body of [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)#Nighthawk (Earth 616 - Kyle Richmond)|Nighthawk]] in the Headmen’s bid to exploit the abilities of the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].  [[Doctor Strange]] later mystically placed Chondu's consciousness within the body of a fawn.  The Headmen then gave Chondu a monstrous, demonic-looking form with eight lampreys for arms, bat-wings, a horn from his skull, a forked tongue, and eagle’s feet.  In this form, he had superhuman strength, could fly, and could constrict objects with his tentacle-like arms.  This drove Chondu insane, and he battled the [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]].<ref>''Defenders'' #31-33, 35</ref> Alongside the Headmen, he later schemed to control the world, but was defeated by the Defenders.<ref>''Defenders Annual'' #1</ref> With the Headmen, he became involved in a brawl at a "Bar With No Name."<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #97</ref> 

The Headmen later hired the [[Ringmaster (comics)|Ringmaster]]'s [[Circus of Crime]] to capture the [[She-Hulk]]. The Headmen placed Chondu's head onto a clone of her body, and used chemical means to restore his sanity.  Chondu regained his sanity but was furious at being given a woman’s body.  She-Hulk and [[Spider-Man]] battled the Headmen, and in the course of the fight, Chondu's head was knocked free from its new body.  Chondu remained alive thanks to life-support equipment attached to his head.<ref>''Sensational She-Hulk'' #1-3</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Chondu is able to manipulate the forces of magic for a limited number of effects, including interdimensional travel, the casting of minor spells, self-levitation, and illusion-casting.
