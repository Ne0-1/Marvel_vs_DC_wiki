'''Chondu the Mystic''', sometimes known as '''Chondu the Yogi''', is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Chondu the Mystic first appeared in ''Tales of Suspense'' #9 and was created by [[Doug Wildley]] and [[George Evans (comics)|George Evans]] while his monstrous form was created by [[Steve Gerber]] and [[Sal Buscema]].

==Fictional character biography==
Chondu was born '''Harvey Schlemerman''' in [[West Kingston, Rhode Island]]. Chondu was once a sideshow [[Magic (illusion)|magician]] before becoming a professional criminal. He can cast minor magical spells and is a adept in the mystic arts. In his first appearance, Chondu lectured on yoga, and sent escaped convict Joe Parker to [[Limbo (Marvel Comics)|Limbo]].<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #9</ref>

Chondu joined the [[Headmen]], and caused an insanity-inducing "black rain."<ref>''Defenders'' #21</ref> Dr. [[Gorilla-Man#Gorilla-Man (Arthur Nagan)|Arthur Nagan]] transplanted Chondu's brain into the body of [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Nighthawk]] in the Headmen’s bid to exploit the abilities of the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. After being soundly defeated in a fight with [[Doctor Strange]], Strange mystically placed Chondu's consciousness within the body of a fawn. Meanwhile, Nagan and Ruby Thursday, with the reluctant assistance of Morgan, carry out a series of alterations to Chondu's original body. His altered body is a monstrous, demonic-looking form with eight lampreys for arms, bird-wings, a horn from his skull, fangs, a forked tongue, and eagle’s feet. His consciousness is placed in a transferable artificial brain made out of the same material as Ruby Thursday's head. In this form, he had superhuman strength, flight and could constrict objects with his tentacle-like arms. Chondu attempted to kidnap a construction worker into whom he intended to transfer his brain. He came into conflict with the [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]] and was arrested by the New York City police.<ref>''Defenders'' #31-33, 35</ref> Released from police custody by the Headmen, he participated in their scheme to control the world, but was defeated by the Defenders.<ref>''Defenders Annual'' #1</ref> With the Headmen, he became involved in a brawl at the "Bar With No Name."<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #97</ref>

The Headmen later hired the [[Ringmaster (comics)|Ringmaster]]'s [[Circus of Crime]] to capture the [[She-Hulk]]. The Headmen placed Chondu's head onto a clone of her body, and used chemical means to restore his sanity. Chondu regained his sanity but was furious at being given a woman’s body. She-Hulk and [[Spider-Man]] battled the Headmen, and in the course of the fight, Chondu's head was knocked free from its new body. Chondu remained alive thanks to life-support equipment attached to his head.<ref>''Sensational She-Hulk'' #1-3</ref>

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' branding, Chondu has been seen as a bartender at the '''Bar With No Doors''', a tavern frequented by various mystics.<ref>''Doctor Strange'' Vol. 4 #1</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Chondu can perform intermediate magic as he is a adept in the mystic arts. In his monstrous demonic-like form, he had superhuman strength, flight and the ability to constrict objects with his tentacle-like arms.
