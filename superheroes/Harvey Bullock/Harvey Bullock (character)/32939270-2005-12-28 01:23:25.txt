'''Harvey Bullock''' is perhaps the most controversial [[police officer]] in the [[Gotham City Police Department]]. His colleagues in the Major Crimes Unit will swear up and down that he is a good cop, despite his reputation for taking [[bribe]]s, [[police brutality]], and ties to [[organized crime]] being on the top. It is believed that Bullock is the one who gave up the location of [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]]'s shooter to the [[Mafia]], as the shooter himself was actually in the [[witness protection program]]. He also stayed in [[Gotham City]] during the ''[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]'' incident. Bullock has also been one of [[Batman]]'s biggest foes on the GCPD, but has not gone to the extremes that others have to apprehend the [[vigilante]]. His last partner on the GCPD was [[Renee Montoya]]. He appears occasionally as a [[private detective]] in ''[[Gotham Central]]''

==Other media==
His animated counterpart in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' is only vaguely similar to this persona, Harvey Bullock is played by [[Robert Costanzo]]. While he is still a staunch opponent of the Batman, and has something of a gruff, tough guy exterior, he is much more benign, no doubt owing to an overall need to tone down certain elements of the Batman mythos to make them more acceptable material for a kid's show. Bullock tends to alternate slightly in his role and nature. At times, he is nothing more than an oafish, incompetent comic relief character, while other episodes show him in a more serious context as a capable detective. Many episodes blend both of these aspects. He was featured prominently in the episode "P.O.V.", in which he and two other officers were questioned about how and why an important bust was such a colossal failure. In his recounting, the voice over contrasts with what happens on screen, the clear implication being that what we see is what really happened, while Bullock's voice over tells quite another story, one in which he is painted in a much more positive and competent light.  

Bullock earned the scorn of ex-wrestler and criminal kingpin [[Killer Croc]] after Bullock sent him to prison for killing a [[union]] member. Croc swore [[revenge]] on Bullock, and attempted to frame him for [[murder]] in the episode "Vendetta."

It has been speculated but not comfirmed that Bullock was the inspiration for the character [[Lt. Max Eckhardt]] in the 1989 ''[[Batman (film)|Batman film]]''.
