== Character history ==
Prior to the 1984-85 DC maxi-series ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', Bullock is a crooked police detective under instructions from [[Gotham City]]'s Mayor [[Hamilton Hill (comics)|Hamilton Hill]] to sabotage [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]]'s career.<ref name="dc-ency"/> His method of doing so is to pretend to be exceedingly clumsy, thereby spoiling whatever Gordon is trying to do, seemingly accidentally. After inadvertently giving Gordon a [[heart attack]], however, Bullock turns over a new leaf. His character later develops into a well-meaning cop who (probably) ''is'' exceedingly clumsy, similar to the later animated version. He also forms a close bond with [[Robin (comics)#Jason Todd|Robin]], based initially on their mutual love of old movies. Subsequent to this, he is a Bishop in the spy organization [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]].

===Post Crisis===
Following the continuity changes brought about in most of DC's comics by ''Crisis'', Bullock is perhaps the most controversial [[police officer]] in the [[Gotham City Police Department]]. His colleagues in the Major Crimes Unit will swear up and down that he is a good cop, despite his reputation for taking [[bribe]]s, [[police brutality]], and ties to [[organized crime]].  However, he also has elements of the earlier character, including a fondness for doughnuts and a hidden sentimental streak. This new post-''Crisis'' Bullock was [[retcon]]ned as having been loyal to Gordon from the start. Even before he makes detective, he stays by Gordon during one of [[Joker (comics)|the Joker's]] earlier rampages. He saves Gordon's life with careful driving and helps him work through the clues. Ultimately, without Batman's assistance, Bullock and Gordon stop the Joker from causing an explosion that would have leveled Gotham City. During the entire case Bullock plays the part of (or was) the "bad cop," intimidating and threatening whoever gets in his way. At this point, Bullock still wears a regular police uniform. 

Several years later, Bullock is made detective. He is partnered with [[Renee Montoya]] and they both become very loyal to each other. 

Bullock is badly injured during a confrontation with the [[KGBeast]], who has gained control of a small [[nuclear weapon]]. Robin and several members of the Gotham City Police Department brave a burning chemical plant, partly to save his life. Bullock actually dies during this incident, but is saved by [[CPR]] administered by Robin. Mackenzie "Hardback" Bock, a newcomer to the force, becomes involved, helping Robin carry Harvey out of harm's way. The nuclear bomb is then neutralized by Batman.

===Earthquake===

In the ''[[Batman: Cataclysm]]'' storyline, Bullock is confronting [[Anarky]] in a shopping mall when an [[earthquake]] hits Gotham City. Both save their own lives by diving into a hollow art structure. Despite this, Bullock's arm is impaled by a tube of metal. He doesn't let this stop him. He makes his way back to the badly damaged police headquarters. As soon as he learns Gordon is missing, he slams his arm against a wall, knocking out the bar and institutes a search. Bullock finds and saves a rattled Gordon from the debris of his own office.

A few weeks later, Gotham is shut down and closed off by the government in the incident known as ''[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]''. Bullock and several other officers, Rene included, willingly stay behind to assist Gordon.  Bullock sticks by Gordon through the death of many fellow officers. When SWAT leader Bily Petit revolts and takes even more officers with him, Bullock sticks with Gordon. Rene herself is even lost for a while due to [[Two-Face]]. In the end, efforts led by [[Lex Luthor]] re-open Gotham. Gordon, Bullock, Rene and the remaining officers (Petit and the others had been killed) are given their jobs back.

Bullock has also been one of Batman's biggest foes on the [[Gotham City Police Department]], but has not gone to the extremes that others have to apprehend the [[vigilante]].

In the "Officer Down" storyline, an [[assassin]] attempts to kill Gordon. Afterwards, a vengeful Bullock reveals the assassin's location to the [[Mafia]], thereby indirectly killing the shooter. When evidence of this comes out, he resigns from the force.

He then appears occasionally as a [[private detective]] in ''[[Gotham Central]]''.

=== Back on the Force ===

As part of DC's "[[One Year Later]]" storyline, Bullock has returned to the GCPD, with the understanding that he is not allowed a single mistake. The circumstances behind this are unknown, the only clue so far being the line, "Six months since Harvey Bullock made his discoveries." Batman and Bullock have made their peace, agreeing to give each other a second chance.<ref name="dc-ency"/>

==Other versions==
*In the [[Elseworlds]] series ''[[JLA: Another Nail]]'', Bullock is shown to be Gotham's Commissioner of Police.

== Other media ==
===DC animated universe===
His animated counterpart in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' is only vaguely similar to this persona, and is voiced by [[Robert Costanzo]].  While he is still a staunch opponent of the Batman, and has something of a gruff, tough guy exterior, he is much more benign (and closer to the later Pre-Crisis version). Bullock tends to alternate slightly in his role and nature.  At times, he is nothing more than an oafish [[comic relief]] character, while other episodes show him in a more serious context as a capable detective. Many episodes blend both of these aspects, thus giving more dimensions to the character. Despite his somewhat corpulent appearance, he is shown in a few episodes to be a capable fighter. 

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:HarveyAnimated.png|left|thumb| ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'' version of Harvey Bullock.]] -->
He was featured prominently in the episode "[[POV (Batman: The Animated Series)|P.O.V.]]", in which he and two other officers are questioned about how and why an important bust ended in colossal failure. In his recounting, the voiceover contrasts with what happens on screen, the clear implication being that what we see is what really happened, while Bullock's voice over tells quite another story, one in which he is painted in a much more heroic light. The effect given in the series is that of an honest, if not exactly by the book, cop who "looks" like the stereotypical corrupt officer.

Although he dislikes Batman at first, Bullock develops a grudging respect for the Dark Knight when Batman saves him from The Joker in "[[The Laughing Fish]]". It is also revealed that Bullock knows the existence of the [[Batcomputer]], but how Bullock learned of it is unrevealed. It's possible though he just might have been referring to a computer used by Batman as a "Batcomputer" akin to the 1960s [[Batman (TV series)|TV series]] habit of everything having a bat- [[prefix]]. Bullock, along with Commissioner Gordon, Mayor Hill and Carl Rossum, is saved again by Batman in the two-part episode "[[Heart of Steel]]", when he and the others are abducted for [[HARDAC]]'s master plan to create robotic duplicates out of Gotham's officials and take control of the city. The [[android]] Bullock has a notable fight scene against Batman in said episode, although Batman defeats the duplicate by pushing him off a building and onto the [[Bat-Signal]].  By the episode [[The Man Who Killed Batman]], Bullock's respect for Batman was such that he was '''visibly''' saddened by the news of the vigilante's apparent "death" at the hands of Sidney Debris.

Bullock earns the wrath of criminal kingpin [[Killer Croc]] after Bullock sends him to prison for killing a [[trade union]] member. Croc swears [[revenge]] on Bullock, and attempts to frame him for [[murder]] in the episode "[[Vendetta (Batman: The Animated Series)|Vendetta]]."

In "A Bullet For Bullock", directly adapted from ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #651, Bullock teams up with Batman to find out who is behind several attempts on his life. At first, it appears to be a [[Mafia|mob]] boss, Vinnie "The Shark" Starkey, behind it, but it is later revealed that it is actually his own landlord, having been driven crazy by Bullock's rudeness and sloppiness.

Despite their mutual dislike for each other, Bullock does show genuine regret when he hears of Batman's supposed demise in "[[The Man Who Killed Batman]]". This version of Bullock later makes small guest appearances in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' and ''[[Static Shock]]''.

In the comic book ''[[The Batman Adventures]]'', set in the ''Animated Series'' continuity, Bullock is forced to resign after [[Penguin (comics)|the Penguin]] becomes mayor. As with the DCU version, he becomes a private detective.

===BBC Radio 1 adaption of ''Knightfall''===
In [[Dirk Maggs]]' adaptation of ''[[Batman: Knightfall]]'' for [[BBC Radio 1]], Bullock was voiced by [[Eric Meyers]].

===The Dark Knight===

The character of Detective Gerard Stephens (played by [[Keith Szarabajka]]) in [[The Dark Knight]] appears to be modeled on Bullock.
