'''Gypsy Moth''' is a fictional [[Mutant (fictional)|mutant]] [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Universe|Marvel Comics universe]].  The character first appeared in ''Spider-Woman'' #10, vol 1.


==History==
Sybil Dvorak was born in [[Focşani]], [[Romania]] in the shadow of the [[Balkans]]. She was raised by [[Gypsies]] and spent much of her time alone nurturing her gardens and focusing on her [[mutant]] powers. She loved how the sensation of [[fiber]], such as soft weaves and flowers, felt to her mental touch since hard objects felt abrasive to her. In her loneliness, she wove herself gossamer wings as delicate as her personality.
 

She then met an American actor named Jason Reed who was starring in a remake of the movie [[Dracula]] being filmed on location in Romania. He romanced her and seduced her with promises of fame as he flew her to his home in [[California]]. Reed, however, was constantly away from the house and she began imagining that he was having affairs behind her back. She wove herself a costume and began calling herself ''Gypsy Moth'' as she wreaked havoc attacking gatherings in search of Reed.
 

[[Jessica Drew]] encountered Gypsy Moth at a party she was attending with her then boyfriend, [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Agent Jerry Hunt and her mentor [[Magnus]]. Jessica, as Spider-Woman, tried to confront her, but Gypsy Moth unwove her costume and then bound her in thread as she tried to drown her in a swimming pool. Spider-Woman broke free as Jerry realized she was fighting for her life. The S.H.I.E.L.D. agent fired his gun at Gypsy Moth, damaging her wing so that she could not fly. Spider-Woman gave Jerry a small stun to keep him from getting in the way as she saved Gypsy Moth. However, instead of turning her over to the authorities, Spider-Woman allowed her to walk away since they seemed to have some things in common.


Soon after her first encounter with Spider-Woman, Sybil managed to get her [[United States citizenship|American citizenship]] and an inclusion in Reed’s will. When he died of a supposed obstructed blood vessel in his heart, she inherited his home and his wealth. She used all of it to start a [[hedonistic]] [[cult]] of drugs and [[decadence]] that worshipped her as their queen.


Within her cult, Gypsy Moth took on the name of [[Sybaritic|Sybarite]] and had her followers steal and scavenge anything she wanted. As Spider-Woman investigated, she overheard the name of Sybarite from among one of the drug-pushers. She recalled it as the name of a hostess who was throwing a party her best friend Lindsay McCabe was attending. In a scuffle, she became injected with enough drugs to knock her out and when she came too she was before Gypsy Moth as Sybarite. Spider-Woman thought they were friends, but Gypsy Moth said she was mistaken. She tried to drown Spider-Woman again, but Spider-Woman broke loose and tried to appeal to her conscience. Saying she had no conscience, Gypsy Moth was attacked once more as Spider-Woman realized Lindsay was present in a drugged-induced haze. Rushing to help her, she turned around to realize Gypsy Moth was missing.


Soon after, Gypsy Moth was kidnapped by Tick-Tock and Locksmith who used technological means to nullify her powers.  Spider-Woman herself was captured and restrained, as well. Spider-Woman had [[Tigra]] insult Poltergeist enough to short out their specially designed prisons. She then had Gypsy Moth use her powers to swap their costumes. Once placed in Gypsy Moth’s specific prison, Spider-Woman broke free and released everyone else. Gypsy Moth entwined Locksmith and Tick-Tock in their clothing for the authorities to find.
 

Gypsy Moth later became a member of the [[Night Shift]], a band of Los Angeles-based villains brought together by [[the Shroud]], in which her former captor, Tick-Tock, was also a member. She joined the Night Shift in rescuing [[Captain America]] from the mutated test subjects of Power Broker Inc. Shroud allowed it to seem as though Dansen Macabre had hypnotized Captain America to serve them. They joined their powers in an assault upon the Power Broker, and Gypsy Moth used her powers to incapacitate his guards.  Gypsy Moth was a member of the Night Shift for a number of other criminal capers.  She even fought the second [[Spider-Woman (Julia Carpenter)|Spider-Woman]] when the Night Shift fought a team of Avengers.  Gypsy Moth wondered if the new Spider-Woman was related to the one she had encountered previously, but the heroine stated she was not.

Most recently, having left the Night Shift, Gypsy Moth was revealed to have joined the Crimson Cowl's [[Masters of Evil]].  Gypsy Moth joined the other Masters of Evil in battling Plantman, Hawkeye and Songbird in their search for the legacy of [[Justin Hammer]].  [[Mentallo]], a mutant telepath and criminal, had escaped from the same prison as Hawkeye and Plantman but, apparently, had gone his own way.  Justin Hammer's legacy was a biotoxin which could kill thousands of superhumans. Hawkeye made an attempt to convince Gypsy Moth and most of her teammates to switch sides and aid him in preventing the Crimson Cowl from obtaining the toxin. Sybil sided with Hawkeye "for kicks", designed a new costume for herself and changed her name to ''Skein''.


Sybil, now a part of Hawkeye's team of [[Thunderbolts]], played an impressive role in thwarting the Crimson Cowl by effectively unravelling the villain's costume, thus rendering her powerless.  As a member of the Thunderbolts, Sybil fought a S.H.I.E.L.D. team and was present when the original team of Thunderbolts returned to Earth after having their own adventure on Counter-Earth.


Afterwards, the two teams came together for a much needed celebration.  As members of the two teams contemplated whether to stay with or leave the group, Sybil announced that she did not intend to stay.  Sybil's current whereabouts are unknown.  It is also unknown whether she has kept the Skein identity or returned to operating as Gypsy Moth.

==Powers & Abilities==
Tactile Telekinesis - ability to telekinetically manipulate materials and objects with her mind although she prefers the soft feel of fiber and similar soft substances. She hence confines her manipulation almost solely to fabrics both organic and inorganic. She can also levitate herself to the point that she can practically fly, as well as carry loads weighing no more than her own body weight.
