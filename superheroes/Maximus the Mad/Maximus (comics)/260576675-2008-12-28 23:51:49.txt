'''Maximus''' is a [[fictional]] character, a [[schizophrenic]] and [[genius]] appearing in [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #47, (February 1966), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

==Fictional character biography==
Maximus, an [[Inhumans|Inhuman]], was the second son of two of [[Attilan]]'s top geneticists, [[Agon (comics)|Agon]], the head of the ruling Council of Geneticists, and Rynda, director of the Prenatal Care Center. Subjected to the DNA-altering Terrigen Mist when he was an infant, Maximus peculiarly showed no outward sign of any mutagenic change. As he matured, he hid his developing psionic powers from the community but was less successful at disguising his antisocial tendencies. When he was about sixteen, his elder brother Black Bolt was released from the protective chamber in which he had been confined since birth due to the destructive nature of his Terrigen mutation. One of Maximus's first responses to his brother's freedom was an unsuccessful attempt to make him release his power and prove Black Bolt could not control his sonic powers, and thus lose his freedom.<ref>as revealed in ''Thor'' #149</ref> A month later, Black Bolt witnessed Maximus making a treacherous pact with an emissary of the [[Kree]], the alien race responsible for genetically accelerating the Inhumans eons before. In an attempt to stop the fleeing emissary so that he could be questioned by the ruling council, Black Bolt used his forbidden power of the quasi-sonic scream and blasted the alien ship out of the sky. When the ship crashed to earth, it landed on the parliament building, killing several key members of the Genetics Council, including the boys' parents. The reverberations of Black Bolt's voice also affected Maximus, who was standing nearby, addling his sanity and suppressing his nascent mental powers. When Black Bolt assumed the throne shortly thereafter, Maximus vowed to oppose his brother and eventually usurp his rule.<ref>as revealed in ''Avengers'' #95</ref>

Maximus staged his first successful coup a few years later. By performing an illegal experiment on the [[Alpha Primitive]]s, the subhuman worker clones that once served the Inhumans, Maximus created the Trikon, three bodiless energy beings of great destructive power. While the Trikon wreaked havoc in Attilan, Maximus was able to drive the Royal Family of the Inhumans out of the city. Maximus later sent [[Gorgon (Inhuman)|Gorgon]] in search of the amnesiac [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]]. In the several year interval before Black Bolt and his cousins located her in America, Maximus ruled Attilan in Black Bolt's stead. Feeling secure in his position, Maximus bade his servant, the [[Seeker (comics)|Seeker]], to locate the Royal Family and bring them back to Attilan.<ref>as revealed in ''Inhumans Special'' #1</ref> Immediately upon doing so, Black Bolt seized the crown back, to Maximus's dismay. Maximus also encountered the [[Fantastic Four]] for the first time. Maximus, hoping to win back the public's affection, activated the Atmo-Gun device he had been working on, a machine he believed would kill the human race and leave all other living beings intact. Maximus miscalculated, however, and the device had no effect. Out of spite, Maximus used the device to erect a "negative zone" barrier (not to be confused with the anti-matter dimension of that name) that encased Attilan in a dark force sphere, imprisoning the entire race inside.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #47-48</ref> Black Bolt liberated his people by using his quasi-sonic voice to destroy the barrier, at the price of devastating Attilan's ancient architecture. 

Maximus then allied himself with six Inhuman criminals, sentenced for their treachery and subversive acts. Freeing [[Falcona]], [[Aireo]], [[Stallior]], Nebulo, [[Leonus]], and [[Timberius]] from their place of imprisonment with the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]'s aid, Maximus then tricked the Hulk into breaching the protective barrier guarding a forbidden chemical substance created by the Inhuman scientist Romnar centuries previous. This substance had certain highly unstable energy absorbing capacities and Maximus intended to use it to usurp the throne again. Black Bolt overpowered him before he could do so. 

Maximus succeeded in bringing about his second coup some months later. Drugging the Royal Family with will-deadening "hypno-potions," Maximus wrested the crown from Black Bolt and had the Royal Family imprisoned. Before he could activate his Hypno-Gun, which he believed would make all mankind surrender to his will, the Royal Family escaped and subdued him. Maximus's first coup had lasted several years; his second one several days. Escaping Attilan with his band of renegades in a rocket, Maximus landed in the South American country of Costa Salvador, and attempted to build a will-deadening device similar to his Hypno-Gun. His plans were opposed by the Hulk and the United States Army, however, and he and his allies were forced to flee again.

Maximus later fomented a battle between the Royal Family and the Fantastic Four.<ref>''Amazing Adventures'' #1-2</ref> Returning to Attilan, Maximus was welcomed back by his brother Black Bolt who preferred Maximus to be somewhere he could be watched. Black Bolt detected that Maximus's psionic powers, suppressed since he was an adolescent, were beginning to return. Offering no explanation, Black Bolt had Maximus placed in a suspended animation capsule, inside which he could not use his powers. Black Bolt's cousin [[Gorgon (comics)|Gorgon]], however, objected to Black Bolt's inhumane treatment of Maximus and freed him. Maximus immediately used his mental powers to subjugate the minds of the Inhuman populace and to give his brother Black Bolt amnesia. Maximus then restored the dark force barrier around Attilan and began negotiations with the alien Kree to sell certain Inhumans to the Kree to be used as soldiers.<ref>''Amazing Adventures'' #5-7</ref> Eventually Black Bolt's memory returned, and alongside the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], he returned to Attilan and once again destroyed the barrier. The Avengers drove the Kree agent away before he could accomplish his mission and Black Bolt liberated the enslaved Inhumans. Maximus's third takeover of Attilan lasted several weeks.

With his mental powers traumatically submerged, Maximus escaped strict punishment for his treachery by feigning insanity. He then began work on his next project to usurp the throne, the construction of the android [[Omega (Marvel Comics)|Omega]], whose power source was supposedly the collective guilt evinced by the Inhuman populace over their treatment of the subhuman Alpha Primitives. The [[Fantastic Four]] helped the Royal Family thwart the construct, and the damage it caused was slight. Maximus staged his fourth successful coup a short time later when the Royal Family had briefly left Attilan on business. Taking [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]] and her husband [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] captive, Maximus forced Black Bolt to give him the crown in order to spare their lives. Black Bolt did so, and allowed himself to be placed in captivity. Maximus had reestablished contact with the Kree and had negotiated a deal where the Kree would take all of the Inhumans with extraordinary abilities, leaving him the other half of the population to rule. [[Triton (comics)|Triton]] and [[Karnak (comics)|Karnak]] managed to rescue most of Maximus's captives and outwit the Kree agent [[Shatterstar (Kree)|Shatterstar]]. Unaware of the victory, Black Bolt let loose with his quasi-sonic scream in agony, once again leveling the city. Angered by what had happened, Black Bolt struck Maximus for the first time and had him imprisoned.

Maximus then allied himself with the [[Enclave (comics)|Enclave]], a band of human scientists who managed to capture Medusa. The Enclave wanted to conquer Attilan and dispatched an aerial strike force. When the Enclave threatened to execute Medusa, however, Maximus turned on them out of unrequited passion for his brother's betrothed. A weapon Maximus was manning overloaded, leaving Maximus in a death-like coma. Black Bolt had his brother's body placed in a special crypt, and when Attilan was transported from the earth to the moon, Maximus accompanied it. On the moon, Maximus's mind made contact with an alien power crystal located there, and it reawakened his dormant mental powers. When Black Bolt next came to pay his respects to his brother, Maximus was able to use his power to affect a transfer of consciousness between them. For several months Maximus ruled Attilan in Black Bolt's body as Black Bolt lay imprisoned in a tube. Reestablishing contact with the Enclave, Maximus helped them implement meteoroid launchers with which they intended to bombard Earth. With the aid of the Avengers, Maximus's switch was discovered, and the Enclave's schemes were foiled. Maximus was forced to return to his rightful body and was once again placed in solitary confinement.<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #12</ref>

His next plot carried out from his prison cell involved the Inhuman Woz, and almost resulted in Attilan being conquered by Earth forces. It was foiled by Black Bolt and Medusa, who arranged for Attilan to be teleported away before its destruction.

===Silent War===
With an [[Silent War|upcoming war]] between the U.S. Government and the Inhumans, Maximus was again plotting his revenge, taunting Black Bolt from his prison and trying to sway a distressed Medusa on his side.<ref>''Silent War'' #3</ref>  He in fact managed to convince Medusa to try to have Luna help "cure" him, only for Luna to realize too late that the "cure" instead allowed Maximus to gain control over all the other Inhumans. After the enhanced Marines managed to destroy Attilan, Maximus usurped the throne of the Inhumans from Black Bolt, taking Medusa as his queen, and announcing a new plan to conquer Earth.

===[[Secret Invasion]]===
When it came to the threat of the [[Skrull]]s, Maximus didn't care at first. When it was discovered that [[Ahura (comics)|Ahura]] was a Skrull in disguise, Maximus defeated it.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Inhumans'' #2</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Maximus has a genius-level intellect and great inventiveness. His Inhuman telepathic powers granted by the mutagenic effects from exposure to Terrigen Mist give him the ability to numb, control, or even blank out a person's mind. He has the ability to induce short-term amnesia in others, and the ability to exchange his consciousness with another's. Maximus's mental powers have a limited range and only function while Maximus concentrates. Maximus's mental state is precarious, as he has a history of mild insanity; his mental instability often prevents him from making full use of his powers. Also, like all Inhumans, Maximus's immune system is weaker than that of an average human.

He is an extraordinarily gifted inventor, with advanced knowledge of physics, mechanics, and biology. He has invented an Atmo-gun (able to create seismic shockwaves and "negative zone" force fields), and a Hypno-gun (able to control minds at a far distance).

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the [[Age of Apocalypse]], Maximus was a [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Horseman]] of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]], the Horseman of Death. He operated on the Blue Area of the Moon, aboard [[Ship (comics)|Ship]], Apocalypse's [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]] starship. Maximus was served by his personal strikeforce formed by clones of the Inhuman Royal Family, which he had murdered himself, altered into monstrous forms by the Terrigen Mists, which Death had offered Apocalypse in exchange for his position. Maximus also experimented on [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]], who had been captured by [[Holocaust (comics)|Holocaust]] after the destruction of Japan, leaving him unable to control his powers.

When the [[X-Men]] appeared on the Moon, believing Apocalypse to be hibernating on Ship, Maximus captured the X-Men and sought to transform them into his servants, and use them to overthrow Apocalypse. However, [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], who had been sent to ensure the transfer of the Mists, attacked the betrayer Death and liberated the X-Men with the aid of [[Blink (comics)|Blink]]. Maximus died, alongside his servants, in the destruction of Ship caused by Sunfire, whose powers flared out of control after he was released.

===Ultimate Maximus===
In [[Ultimate Fantastic Four]], Maximus is introduced in the series' first Annual along with the other Inhumans. He is the brother of Black Bolt and the [[fiancé]] of [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]]. She refuses to marry him, referring to him as a 'stunted little [[peacock]]' and calling him [[insanity|mad]].

==Other media==
===Television===
Maximus appeared in the ''[[Fantastic Four (1994 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]'' animated series voiced by [[Mark Hamill]].

===Video games===
Maximus is mentioned in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'' by several Inhumans. Gorgon says he has Maximus "locked safely in the maze."
