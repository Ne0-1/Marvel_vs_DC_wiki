==Fictional character biography==
The title of Smasher has been used by three different humanoid aliens who served in the [[Shi'ar]] [[Imperial Guard (comics)|Imperial Guard]].

===Vril Rokk===
The first Smasher was Vril Rokk, who had a long, distinguished service with the Guard.  He was also romantically linked with fellow Guardsman Plutonia.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}

When [[Cassandra Nova]] was decimating the Shi'ar empire, Smasher was one of the few entities that managed to personally protect the empress [[Lilandra]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Under protest, Smasher is ordered to travel to Earth to warn the X-Men about the threat Nova posed.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} He crash lands in a field full of cows. He does not make it to the mansion until well after the Imperial Guard, brainwashed by Nova, were attempting to kill the X-Men. His presence manages to convince the Guard to fight against Nova, although he and the others were swiftly defeated by her.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

Smasher is later killed by [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]], a powerful mutant who attempts to conquer the Shi'ar empire.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}

===Salac Tuur===
Vril Rokk is soon replaced with another Smasher, Salac Tuur.  The new Smasher was among the Imperial Guardsmen who attacked the Kree homeworld during the wedding of [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]] and [[Ronan the Accuser]]. During the battle, Smasher was slain by the Inhuman [[Karnak (comics)|Karnak]].<ref>''War of Kings'' #1 (March 2009)</ref>

===Smasher III===
The uniform and title of Smasher has since been passed onto an unidentified member of the original's race.<ref>''War of Kings'' #3 (May 2009)</ref> However, the newest version of Smasher was killed by Gladiator during a raid performed by Starjammers and Guardians of the Galaxy. The Strontian praetor killed Smasher as a sign of defecting to Lilandra.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}

==Powers and abilities==
Like his predecessors, Smasher could naturally absorb cosmic radiation from his environment in order to increase his strength to superhuman levels.

Smasher wore special goggles called "exospex" that enabled him to "download" additional superhuman powers.{{issue|date=November 2010}}  Via the exospex, he could obtain "penta-vision" (a form of [[X-ray]] vision), superhuman durability, even greater physical strength, and the ability to travel into [[Hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]] ("4-space").  Smasher was only capable of downloading one superpower at a time.

Smasher wore small anti-gravity "flight patches" that enabled him to fly. Flight patches are standard issue for Imperial Guardsmen who lack the power of flight.

==Inspiration==
Several of the members of the Imperial Guard are at least partly based on members of the [[DC Comics]]' team [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]. Dave Cockrum (co-creator of the Guard) also had a long run as artist on the ''Legion''. Smasher is based on LSH member [[Ultra Boy]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

==Other versions==
===X-Men: The End===
In the alternate future of ''X-Men: The End'' Smasher is a veteran Guardian on duty when the plans of the series main villain is revealed. He attacks with a small group of other Guardians. They are all slain, Smasher's neck is snapped.<ref>''X-Men: The End: Book 3: Men & X-Men'' #1-2 (March–April 2006)</ref>

===Star Trek/X-Men===
Smasher also appears in ''Star Trek/X-Men'' #1 (December 1996). He, and several other members of the Imperial Guard assist [[Deathbird]] in a mission.
