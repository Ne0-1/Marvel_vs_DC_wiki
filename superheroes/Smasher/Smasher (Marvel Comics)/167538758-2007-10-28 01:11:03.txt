'''Smasher''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]].

==Fictional character biography==
Smasher is a long-time member of the [[Shi'ar]] [[Imperial Guard (comics)|Imperial Guard]]. He is superhumanly strong and durable, and can fly under his own power. He can "download" powers via the special goggles that he wears; so far he has been seen to obtain in this manner "penta-vision", which may be a form of [[clairvoyance]] or [[X-ray]] vision, and the ability to travel into [[Hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]] ("4-space") without a vehicle. He has been romantically linked with Plutonia. 

When [[Cassandra Nova]] was decimating the Shi'ar empire, Smasher was one of the few entities that managed to personally protect the empress [[Lilandra]]. Under protest, Smasher is ordered to travel to Earth to warn the X-Men about the threat Nova posed. He crash lands in a field full of cows. He does not make it to the mansion until well after the Imperial Guard, brainwashed by Nova, were attempting to kill the X-Men. His presence manages to convince the Guard to fight against Nova, although he and the others were swiftly defeated by her. 

Later, he is killed by [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]], a powerful mutant who attempts to conquer the Shi'ar empire.

==Other Versions==
In the alternate future of ''X-Men: The End'' Smasher is a veteran Guardian on duty when the plans of the series main villain is revealed. He attacks with a small group of other Guardians. They are all slain, Smasher's neck is snapped.

==In other media==
In the ''[[X-Men Animated Series]]'', Smasher appears in ''The Phoenix Saga'' and ''The Dark Phoenix Saga'' alongside the rest of the Imperial Guard.
