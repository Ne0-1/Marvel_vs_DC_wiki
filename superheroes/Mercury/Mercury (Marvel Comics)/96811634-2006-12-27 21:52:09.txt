'''Mercury''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] in the [[Marvel Universe]], a member of the student body at the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]]. Her real name is Cessily Kincaid, and she first appeared in ''New Mutants'' (volume 2) #2. She is from [[Portland, Oregon]] and her parents do not accept her mutancy.  She is one of only 27 (technically 30) students to keep her powers post-[[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]] and is part of the New X-Men team.  

==Character history==
===Introduction===
Cessily Kincaid was raised in [[Portland, Oregon]] by her parents Mark and Jill, who, according to DeFilippis, used to dote over her[http://www.comixfan.com/xfan/forums/showthread.php?p=1225548#post1225548].  When Cessily's powers manifested, her parents were disgusted and made her stay indoors so as to hide her mutancy.  In response, she was sent to the Xavier Institute where she befriended [[Hellion (comics)|Julian Keller]] and was placed as [[Wallflower (comics)|Laurie Collins]]' roommate, which led to Cessily not liking Laurie.  After the school was rebuilt, she was selected by [[Emma Frost]] to be on her [[Hellions#The Xavier Institute.27s Hellions squad|Hellions]] squad.

During that time, she developed a crush on her teammate [[Wither (comics)|Wither]], but her feelings were not reciprocated. 

===Hellions Miniseries===
The Hellions squad won the squad challenge, and during their summer vacation, they travled with Julian to his home.  There they encountered the Kingmaker, from whom they each received a trial wish.  Cessily's wish was to have her parents accept and love her.  However, when the Hellions eventually refused a permanent deal with the Kingmaker, Cessily's parents reverted back to normal and Cessily returned to the Institute, defeated.

===Decimation===
Soon thereafter, the events of [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]] left only 27 students with their powers, Cessily included, though she would have preferred to lose her powers.  The depowered students and staff were sent home.  One bus was bombed by anti-mutant religious zealot Reverend [[William Stryker]], and Cessily's former teammate and friend [[Tag (comics)|Tag]] was among those killed.  The X-Men held a [[funeral]] for those students whose parents would not accept them, and Cessily's anguish was very visible.

All of the remaining students were placed by Emma Frost into an all-out brawl, and the ones deemed to be the best were to be assigned to become a group of in-training [[X-Men]].  Cessily made the team and began training to become an X-Man.

===Childhood's End and Nimrod===
In the ''Childhood's End'' arc, Cessily and the New X-Men defeated Stryker, [[Elixir (comics)|Josh]] killing him.  Shortly afterwards the team went to help Forge who had been sought out by Nimrod for repair. During the skirmish X-23 was forced to sever a piece of Mercury's hand to separate her from Nimrod. She later commented she'd "always wanted to loose a few pounds." The team successfully defeated the robot due to a group effort. Nimrod was sent back in time.

==Powers==
Mercury's body is composed of non-toxic [[mercury (element)|mercury]], which she can reshape or solidify at will, although she is still inexperienced in shape-shifting. Molecular adhesion power gives her the ability to cling to solid surfaces and move her body at will even without overt locomotive features.

Electricity is her main weakness and has often been used against her, because it causes her body to go haywire.

Since her body is not organic, she is one of the few people who can touch [[Wither(comics)|Wither]] without decaying.

==Alternate versions==
* In the [[House of M]] reality, Cessily was a student at the [[Karma (comics)|Karma's]] New Mutant Leadership Institute, and, unlike her [[Marvel Universe|616]] persona, was close with Laurie. When she learned of [[Prodigy (comics)|Prodigy]]'s plan to help [[Surge (comics)|Surge]] find her terrorist father in [[Japan]], she was against going, but then Laurie (a deep cover S.H.I.E.L.D. agent) changed her mind. Once in Japan, the young team found the Project Genesis the terrorists were trying to stop, and Laurie revealed her loyalties, making the Hellions attack the New Mutants. Mercury, however, was immune to pheromones, and pleaded with her friend to stop. When Laurie refused, Cessily was forced to stab her in the abdomen. Afterwards, Mercury joined the survivors in a last-ditch assault on Emperor [[Sunfire]]'s forces.

==Facts==
* Her creators, [[Christina Weir]] and [[Nunzio DeFilippis]], state that she is [[Irish-American]].
* It has also been said by her creators that she can potentially do anything the [[T-1000]], from 1991 film ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', can.
* Cessily is disappointed about not losing her powers due to [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].
* In her first appearance, she was sixteen-years-old.
* '''''Mercury''''' was also the name of one of the characters (a speedster) seen in ''Red Raven Comics'' (published by [[Timely Comics]], the precursor to [[Marvel Comics]]).  Various [[retcon]]s have made it so ''that'' Mercury was the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternal]] [[Makkari (comics)|Makkari]] all along. 
* A previous male character with the same name and powers was introduced as a part of [[Cerebro's X-Men]].
