'''Glorian''' ('''Thomas Gideon''') is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  He first appeared in ''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1, #135 (June 1973).

==Fictional character biography==
Thomas Gideon, son of billionaire [[Gregory Gideon]] and his wife Claire, was born in [[Rochester, New York]]. Thomas' father concocted a scheme to defeat the [[Fantastic Four]] within one week.  As a result of Gregory Gideon's machinations, Thomas and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] were accidentally trapped in Gregory Gideon's time machine.  They were returned to the present, and Thomas reconciled with his father.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #34</ref>

Years later, Thomas was aboard a private [[jet aircraft]] with his parents when it was caught in the heat-pulse and blast wave of a [[Russia]]n [[nuclear weapon]] test. The plane crashed, killing all but Thomas and his father. Picked up by a Russian trawler, the two Gideons were eventually hospitalized. There they were told that they were dying of [[radiation poisoning]]. The elder Gideon spent his remaining months designing a device to tap the mutated [[gene]]s of the hero team [[Fantastic Four]] which he believed would somehow reverse his cellular decay and that of his son at the expense of the Fantastic Four's lives. His selfish scheme was thwarted by the hero team, and the elder Gideon was killed when his pawn, the [[robot]] [[Dragon Man]], broke free of his control.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #134-135</ref> In the midst of the wreckage appeared the [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|alien]] [[Shaper of Worlds]], attracted to the site by the dreams of one of Gideon's henchmen. Though the henchman's dreams proved inadequate, the Shaper took Thomas Gideon, cured him of his radiation poisoning, and took Thomas as his apprentice dream-shaper, to undertake learning the Shaper's skills.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #136-137</ref>

The Shaper helped Thomas attain his true potential, and Thomas became the Shaper's assistant, '''Glorian'''. Glorian first encountered the monster known as the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], but was apparently killed.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #190-191</ref> It was only later revealed that Glorian was actually the transformed Thomas Gideon.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #267</ref>

Still an [[Earth]]ling at heart, Glorian often returned to Earth and involved himself in the lives of its superheroes. At one point, Glorian traveled to Las Vegas, and tried to help the Hulk by giving him his heart's desire. Instead, however, Hulk became involved in a plot against Glorian by the [[Demons (Marvel Comics)|demon]] [[Satannish]], who was after Glorian's soul. In the guise of "Nick Cloot", Satannish had Glorian sign a contract in exchange for help. In the end, the Hulk intervened on behalf of Glorian, and so saved Glorian from Satannish's grasp. The Shaper of Worlds finally saved Glorian and took him back into space.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #353, 355-359</ref>

Later, Glorian was attracted to the fevered dreams of the young [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] known as [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]]. Glorian helped the mutants from being lost at sea.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

===Annihilation===
Glorian later reappears in the ''[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]'' miniseries in the pages of ''[[Ronan the Accuser|Ronan]]''. He manipulates  [[Gamora]] and [[Ronan the Accuser]] and attempts to use the energy from their battles to attempt to reshape the world. This is interrupted by the forces of [[Annihilus]], forcing Glorian to kill instead of create.<ref>''Annihilation: Ronan'' #3 - 4 (2006)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The [[Shaper of Worlds]] activated the latent psionic abilities that Thomas Gideon (and, allegedly, all human beings) possesses.  As Glorian, he has the ability to restructure finite pockets of reality by mentally manipulating the cosmic energies that bind atoms along the probability lines. He has the psionic ability to tap and manipulate tachyons, subatomic particles which travel no slower than the speed of light.  Glorian can use tachyons to create hyperspatial "rainbow bridges" which can transport himself, or others if he is present, at trans-light speeds. When Glorian steps upon the bridge, the particles of his body are converted to tachyon particle analogues, freeing him from such physical limitations as needing air or food during his travels through space. He can also create rainbow-like energy bands to bind an adversary. Presumably Glorian has limited telepathic abilities that enable him to learn what another person's dreams and wishes are. Glorian can only restructure the perceived reality of a volume with a maximum radius of {{convert|5.02|mi|km}} in all directions from his person. The changes he makes will last for a maximum of 23.1 hours. (These figures may increase as Glorian masters his powers.) Glorian can only recreate the outward aspects of a living being or environment, and not the living being or environment itself.
