In the fictional [[Marvel Universe]], while on a mission to [[Asia]], [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Emma Frost]] found a [[mutant]] healer named '''Xorn''', who returned with them to the mansion. He was a valued member of the team, even going so far as to heal [[Professor Xavier]]'s [[leg]]s.

Soon he was put in charge of the "special" class, who he soon commanded as an unofficial team of [[X-Men]].  However, this proved to work against them when he took off his helmet to reveal none other than the X-Men's arch-foe [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], and he once again crippled Xavier.
