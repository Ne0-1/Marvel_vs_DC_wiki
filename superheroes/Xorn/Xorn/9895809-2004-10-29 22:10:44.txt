The creature has also appeared (with the spelling '''zorn''') in the [[Ultima]] computer game series.

'''Xorn''' is a [[fiction]]al character in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  He was a [[mutant]] who claimed that his mutation had gifted him with a "[[star]] for a [[brain]]"; as a result, he was a powerful [[healer]] and possessed the ability to manipulate energy and [[gravity]].  He was originally found by the [[X-Men]] [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Emma Frost]] in [[China]].  He became a valued member of the team, even going so far as to heal [[Professor X]]'s broken [[leg]]s.

Soon he was put in charge of the "Special Class", a group of physical and social misfits who attended the [[Xavier Institute]], who he soon commanded as his own unofficial team of X-Men.  However, this proved to work against them when he took off his helmet to reveal his identity as none other than the X-Men's nemesis [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]].  He had used his energy-manipulation powers to fake the fictional Xorn's spurious mutation (Xorn had previously only demonstrated the ability to manipulate magnetism, gravity and electricity and to control [[nanotechnology]], all of which Magneto was easily capable of).  Upon this revelation, he once again crippled Xavier, levelled Xavier's mansion, and fatally wounded [[Jean Grey]] before being beheaded by [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]].

However, recent issues of ''X-Men'' have revealed that Xorn had an actual person who was under the influence of the enity known as Sublime. A man named Shen Xorn possessing similiar powers has appeared, saying he is the brother of the original Xorn. Magneto has also resurfaced, alive and well, in [[Genosha]]. The details of this have not yet been explained.
