'''Shatterstar''' ('''Gaveedra-Seven''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[superhero]] in the {{Marvel Universe}}.

==Publication history==
{{Expand|date=November 2008}}
Shatterstar first appeared in ''[[The New Mutants]]'' vol. 1 #99 (March 1991), and was created by [[Fabian Nicieza]] and [[Rob Liefeld]]. Since his debut Shatterstar has mainly appeared in ''X-Force'' with some issues devoted solely to him.  In 2005, the character was featured in his own limited series, ''X-Force: Shatterstar''. Shatterstar became a member of X-Factor in ''X-Factor'' #45 (August 2009).

==Fictional character biography==
Shatterstar comes from the planet Mojoworld (about a century in the future, as opposed to the Mojoverse which co-exists with the contemporary Earth dimension, making him a time traveler as well as a dimension-hopper) which is ruled by the alien tyrant [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]] V. There, Shatterstar was created to be a slave; he claims to have had no parents, only a "gestation chamber." He was [[genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] to have enhanced physical capabilities so he could serve as an arena gladiator.

Shatterstar learned the arts of battle as a warrior in arenas on Mojoworld, where he participated in combats staged for Mojo's television programs. It’s assumed it was here he developed his strong sense of honor and pride as a warrior, to combat the constant violence and death in his life. Eventually he escaped and joined the '''Cadre Alliance''', the [[Rebellion|rebel]] group that sought to overthrow Mojo V's [[dictatorship]]. From there, he learned the Cadre's language and began taking part in missions.

On one of these missions, Arize sent him back in time to Earth to find the [[X-Men]] and get their assistance in defeating and overthrowing Mojo. He did not find the X-Men though. Shatterstar was either [[teleportation|teleported]] or traveled back in time to Earth at the point just before [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] reorganized the [[New Mutants]] into X-Force. At first, he battled Cable, [[Domino (comics)|Domino]], and the New Mutants, but after they talked with him the mutants aided him against the Imperial Protectorate. With Cable's assurance that they would help him defeat Mojo (though with the use of time travel it was not urgent that they leave anytime soon) Shatterstar became a founding member of the new team, X-Force.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 1 #99-100</ref>

With X-Force on their first mission, Shatterstar battled the [[Alliance of Evil]], and first encountered the [[New Warriors]].<ref>''New Mutants Annual'' #7</ref> He battled [[Night Thrasher (Dwayne Taylor)|Night Thrasher]] and [[Silhouette (comics)|Silhouette]].<ref>''New Warriors Annual'' #1</ref> With X-Force, the New Warriors, [[Moira MacTaggert]]'s "[[Muir Island]] [[X-Men]]" team, and [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], he battled [[Proteus (comics)|Proteus]].<ref>''X-Factor Annual'' #6</ref>

X-Force's next mission involved attacking the [[Mutant Liberation Front]] base, where Shatterstar battled [[Reaper (Marvel Comics)|Reaper]].<ref>''X-Force'' #1</ref> With X-Force and [[Spider-Man]], he next battled [[Black Tom Cassidy|Tom Cassidy]] and the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]].<ref>''X-Force'' #3-4; ''Spider-Man'' #16</ref> With X-Force, he battled the [[Toad (comics)|Toad]]'s [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]].<ref>''X-Force'' #6-8</ref>

Later Shatterstar discovered, to his bewilderment, that he also had the memories of an Earthling named Benjamin Russell.<ref>''X-Force'' vol. 1 #54, 56, 59-61</ref> Soon afterwards, Mojo made Cable and Shatterstar his prisoners and transformed them into digital images for one of his television programs. In the course of the show, Shatterstar was mortally wounded in combat. Mojo's sometime ally [[Spiral (comics)|Spiral]] teleported Cable and Shatterstar back into reality, where they regained their true forms. Spiral brought Cable, Shatterstar, [[Longshot]] (who was Shatterstar's ally on Mojoworld), and the X-Force member [[Siryn]] to the Weisman Institute for the Criminally Insane in Rutland, [[Vermont]].

There Spiral directed them to the bedside of one of its patients, a mutant named Benjamin Russell who had no living relatives, had been in a [[coma]] since his powers had emerged, and, curiously, looked identical to Shatterstar. Longshot transferred Shatterstar's "uemeur," or soul, into Benjamin Russell's body, and the two became one. Apparently Shatterstar's body merged with Russell's as well, for the resulting body bore the starburst pattern that Shatterstar had around his left eye and his hair lengthened greatly. Restored to full health and consciousness, and feeling "whole" for the first time in his life, Shatterstar resumed his work as a member of X-Force.

However, this does not explain why Shatterstar had some of Benjamin Russell's memories before they merged, or why they looked so much alike. There are still too many mysteries yet to be explained about Shatterstar's true origin. It was hinted that Shatterstar may have been the child of Longshot and the mutant X-Man [[Dazzler]] in the early run of X-Men in 1992,<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 2 #10-11</ref> and in 2009, Rob Liefeld confirmed that Shatterstar "was pitched as Longshot's son".<ref>[http://robot6.comicbookresources.com/2009/07/liefeld-cant-wait-to-someday-undo-shatterstar-development/ Liefeld 'can't wait to someday undo' Shatterstar development]</ref> A later medical exam conducted by [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] upon Shatterstar revealed that he indeed possessed DNA identical to that of Longshot, his rumored father, along with such genetic features as hollow bones and a lack of white blood cells.<ref>''X-Force'' #45</ref>

Dazzler revealed that she was [[pregnant]] with Longshot's child and Longshot suggested the name "Shatterstar" for the unborn child.<ref>''[[X-Men (vol. 2)|X-Men]]'' vol. 2 #11</ref> Longshot and Dazzler returned to Mojoworld to free Longshot's people and Dazzler later appeared without Longshot and without a child. It has been speculated that Dazzler [[miscarriage|miscarried]],<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #47</ref> though it has not been established officially what became of the infant.

Shatterstar accompanied [[Rictor]] to the Richter home in Mexico to try and end Rictor's family's arms-dealing business. Both characters have since appeared separately so one assumes they succeeded, though it’s not known why they later parted.

Shatterstar is later seen in [[Madripoor]], earning his money by fighting in arenas. He was sought out by Spiral, who had one of her agents make Shatterstar believe she wanted to kill him.<ref>X-Force: Shatterstar #1-4</ref> However, Spiral had previously admitted in an emotional confession to Cable, when he demanded that she reveal all that she knew about the answers behind the mysteries of Shatterstar's origin immediately after Shatterstar and Benjamin Russell had been merged, that both young men "meant more than life itself to her" before teleporting away. With a fake quest, Spiral lured Shatterstar to an alternate universe she had conquered and ruled. On that Earth, Spiral had also killed most of that world's heroes and mutants. That Earth's Shatterstar had been killed as well. He was found by that Earth's rebel forces, including Cable and some other members he knew from X-Force. Together, they eventually defeated Spiral. Upon returning to the mainstream Earth, Shatterstar was contacted by Cable and requested to temporarily join him on a mission to defeat the [[Skornn]].<ref>X-Force vol. 2 #1-6</ref> Shatterstar agreed, but first Cable wanted him to train with monks on Mount Xixabangma. After those monks were killed by Skornn's worshipers, Shatterstar was reunited with his old team and they eventually killed the Skornn.

Following [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]] and the passing of the [[Superhuman Registration Act]], Shatterstar teamed up with Domino and Caliban (all X-Force members) to break [[The 198]] out of the encampment set up for mutants on the grounds of the Xavier Institute.<ref>''Civil War: X-Men'' #1</ref> They took the escapees to a secret base provided to them by [[Captain America]] via [[Nick Fury]].<ref>''Civil War: X-Men'' #2</ref> While fighting O*N*E, he nearly killed [[Micromax]], claiming that while there is no such thing as murder during war,<ref>''Civil War: X-Men''#3</ref> he had only meant to disable him.<ref>''Civil War: X-Men'' #4</ref>

===X-Factor===
Shatterstar eventually returns, attacking [[Strong Guy]] and [[Rictor]]. With his hair cut off and his eyes glowing pink, Shatterstar appears to be possessed, saying only the name "Cortex".<ref>''X-Factor'' #43 (May 2009)</ref> Shatterstar is broken out of his trance-like state when Cortex's control over him is interrupted. Upon recognizing Rictor, he kisses him passionately.<ref>''X-Factor'' #45 (June 2009)</ref>

Following his reunion with Rictor, Shatterstar is seen along with him and Guido trying to apologize to Father Madrox only to have him kick all three of them out. Back in Detroit, Cortex confronts Longshot and the two fight. As Cortex attempts to gain control over Longshot he is startled that Longshot, like Shatterstar, is extradimensional (limiting his degree of control) and that the two men are somehow related.<ref>''X-Factor'' #47 (August 2009)</ref> 

Rictor and Shatterstar face some relationship problems because Shatterstar &mdash; who now feels romantic and sexual potential within him for the first time &mdash; wants to explore this whole new sexual world, desiring an [[open relationship]]. Rictor, more fully committed to maintaining theirs as a monogamous relationship, feels hurt by Shatterstar's need for sexual exploration. Things are complicated further when [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Rahne]] walks in on the two of them in a sexual act, with Shatterstar inviting her to "join them".

==Powers and abilities==
Shatterstar possesses an overall superhuman level of physical and mental power (senses, strength, speed, reflexes/reactions, agility, flexibility, dexterity, coordination, balance, endurance, intelligence), as a result of the extra-dimensional genetic engineering that created him. His strength is superhuman enough that he is capable of wielding a barbell used by the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] of the [[Fantastic Four]] as a weapon to slam Thing through a wall of the [[Baxter Building]].<ref>''X-Factor #200'' (2010)</ref> Shatterstar's speed and agility are considered enhanced enough for members of the Mutant Response Division to expect him capable of dodging point-blank automatic weapons firing from at least three trained agents.<ref>''X-Factor #204'' (2010)</ref> 

He is an excellent military strategist and has had extensive training in many forms of the [[martial arts]] and interpersonal combat of Mojoworld; in particular, he is a master swordsman. His bones are hollow, making him far lighter than he looks and further increasing his athletic and acrobatic skills. He also has enhanced learning capabilities, being able to quickly learn and master languages and technology. He customarily wields two single-edged swords with spiked hand-guards and on occasion carries other weaponry as well. Shatterstar is able to regenerate damaged or destroyed tissue much faster than an ordinary human. Injuries such as slashes and stabbings heal completely within a matter of hours. Additionally, he possesses the ability to shift his internal organs within his body, lessening the chances of serious wounds that get through his body armor.

He also has the mutant ability to channel and generate powerful vibratory shock waves (and perhaps [[bioelectricity]]) charges through these blades, though he rarely uses them as they tend to exhaust him, and prefers to depend instead on his martial prowess.  

He also owns a pair of blades that create portals capable of [[teleportation|teleporting]] individuals to their desired locations. This ability requires another individual to serve as the 'focus', picturing the destination.<ref>''Nation X: X-Factor'' #1 (2010)</ref> Creating such portals generates enough energy that it must be done outside, otherwise risking significant damage to any structure within which they are built. Shatterstar also requires a minimum of three to four hours to recharge between portal creation.<ref>''X-Factor #201'' (2010)</ref> Should his concentration be interrupted while an individual or object is partway through, those parts will be severed, ending up in the separate locations, the destination and the starting point of the portal.<ref>''X-Factor #202'' (2010)</ref>

==Sexual orientation==

Although Shatterstar was revealed to have a designated "genetic bond mate," Windsong (whom he never met and is now deceased), in the Mojoverse,<ref>''X-Force'' #29 & #30</ref> he later claimed that even though he was fully capable physically, he had never felt any sexual stirrings or romantic love—indicating a form of [[asexuality]]—and has long felt "lacking", even in his native dimension.<ref>''X-Force'' #43</ref> Writer [[Peter David]] reflects that being the subject of "prolonged exposure to Earth" and around Rictor changed things for the warrior, and he began to develop a real romantic capacity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afterelton.com/other/2009/12/rictor-met-shatterstar-peter-david-interview|publisher=[[AfterElton.com]]|title=Superheroes in Love: When Rictor Met Shatterstar|last=Masaki|first=Lyle|accessdate-2010-09-19|date=2009-12-10}}</ref> 

It is not known if this is still the case as it happened before the joining with Benjamin Russell, who is assumed to have a fully developed sexuality.{{Issue|date=July 2009}} Since then his emotional state has been fluctuating. While in X-Force he displayed emotion, having developed a close—and somewhat ambiguous—friendship with [[Rictor]],<ref>''Cable #22''</ref><ref>''X-Force #56''</ref><ref>''X-Force #59''</ref><ref>''X-Force #60''</ref><ref>''X-Force ’99 Annual''</ref> although after his time training on Mount Xixabangma he claimed there was no emotion within him.{{Issue|date=July 2009}}

''X-Force'' writer Jeph Loeb hinted that Shatterstar had romantic feelings for Rictor and was planning on making the two a couple, but he left the title before this could happen.<ref>[http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/10/18/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-125/ Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #125]</ref>

In ''X-Factor v.3 #45'', Shatterstar and Rictor kiss.<ref>''X-Factor v.3 #45''</ref> Shortly after the issue was published, Peter David confirmed Rictor and Shatterstar's bisexuality in his blog and expressed his desire to develop the relationship between Rictor and Shatterstar further.<ref name="PAD Comments#1">http://www.peterdavid.net/index.php/2009/06/24/stash-wednesday-june-24/comment-page-1/#comments</ref><ref name="PAD Comments#2">http://www.peterdavid.net/index.php/2009/06/24/stash-wednesday-june-24/#comments</ref>

One of Shatterstar's creators, Rob Liefeld, expressed his disapproval with Shatterstar having any homosexual or bi-sexual tendencies, saying he was meant to be "asexual, and struggling to understand human behavior."<ref>Melrose, Kevin. [http://robot6.comicbookresources.com/2009/07/liefeld-cant-wait-to-someday-undo-shatterstar-development/ "Liefeld ‘can’t wait to someday undo’ Shatterstar development"]. ''Comic Book Resources'', 3 July 2009.</ref> Marvel Editor-in-Chief [[Joe Quesada]] defended the development, and stated that if Rob Liefeld wanted it changed, he would have to "take it up with the next editor-in-chief".<ref>Joe Quesada and Kiel Phegley. [http://comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=22007 "Cup O' Joe"], ''Comic Book Resources'', 14 July 2009.</ref> Similarly, Peter David also defended the storyline, citing the work of other writers after Rob Liefield's tenure on the character.<ref name="PAD">http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=22080</ref> Writing for the character after his [[coming out]], Peter David takes inspiration from ''[[Torchwood]]'' character [[Jack Harkness|Captain Jack Harkness]], a notoriously bi-sexual character in the [[Doctor Who]] universe, created by [[Russell T Davies]]. In that respect, Shatterstar is, as he puts it, [[wikt:like a kid in a candy store|like a kid in a candy store]]: "swashbuckling, enthusiastic and sexually curious about anything with a pulse."<ref name="cbr 1">{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=24992|title=Peter David's "X-Factor": Earth Moving, Star Shattering|first=Chaos|last=Mckenzie|work=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=2010-09-19|date=2010-02-25}}</ref> As such, David's ''X-Factor'' sees Shatterstar want to have a sexually [[open relationship]] on account of having been (as in Liefeld's stories) sexually and romantically closed off to the world all his life.<ref>David, Peter.
