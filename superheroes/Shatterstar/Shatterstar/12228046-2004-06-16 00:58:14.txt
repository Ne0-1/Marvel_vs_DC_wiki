'''Shatterstar''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].

Gavendra Seven (real name) was genetically engineered in the future of an alternate dimension created by [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]]. He may or may not be the offspring of [[Longshot]] and [[Dazzler]]. He was originally a gladiator who rebelled and joined the Cadre Alliance. He was cast into the past to seek help from the [[X-Men]]. Instead he came across the [[New Mutants]] and joined them as they changed to [[X-Force]].

Shatterstar served with X-Force for a long time, before being recaptured by Mojo and transferred into the body of Benjamin Russell, a duplicate of Shatterstar of uncertain origins.  Shatterstar left X-Force to go to Mexico with teammate [[Rictor]] to shut down an arms dealing network led by Rictor's family.

Shatterstar fought with a pair of double-bladed swords from his hime dimension, and had the [[mutant]] ability to channel powerful vibrations through these blades.
