'''The Wrecker''' is a [[fictional character]] in the {{Marvel Universe}}, a [[supervillain]] and a frequent enemy of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. 

== Fictional character biography ==
'''Dirk Garthwaite''' is a former [[manual labour|manual labor]]er for a demolitions crew who was fired over his violent and antisocial behavior. Deciding to make his fortune through crime instead, Garthwaite fashioned a costume for himself and began making a series of robberies under the guise of the Wrecker. His calling cards were his habit of demolishing the locations he would rob and the [[crowbar]] he would leave behind at the scene of the crime.

One day, the Wrecker happened to be robbing a hotel room that, unbeknownst to him, was the hideout of [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], who was trying to contact his accomplice, the [[Norn]] Queen [[Karnilla]], for an enchantment that would grant him the strength to best Thor. In the scuffle, Garthwaite was mistaken for Loki and received the enchantment instead, giving him superhuman strength and durability, and making his crowbar virtually indestructible. Revelling in his new power, the Wrecker went on a destruction spree and even bested a weakened Thor, who arrived in an attempt to stop him. Finally the Wrecker was defeated by the [[Asgardian Destroyer]] and taken to prison.

Eventually, the Wrecker broke out of prison and squared off with Thor again, but this time Thor was at his full strength, and the villain was handily defeated. Thor used the magic of [[Mjolnir]] to drain the Wrecker of his powers, leaving him an ordinary human once more. However, the Wrecker intuited that his crowbar still retained its mystical power, and kept track of its whereabouts through a series of contacts.

== The Wrecking Crew ==
One night during a thunderstorm, Garthwaite broke out of prison, along with his cellmates Henry Camp, Brian Philip Calusky, and Dr. Eliot Franklin. He recovered the crowbar and held it aloft, all four men placing their hands upon it. Lightning struck the crowbar, not only reactivating the enchantment but empowering the other three men as well. The four felons dubbed themselves the [[Wrecking Crew (comics)|Wrecking Crew]]; Camp became [[Bulldozer (comics)|Bulldozer]], Calusky became [[Piledriver (comics)|Piledriver]], and Franklin became [[Thunderball (comics)|Thunderball]]. While this meant that the Wrecker was not as powerful as before, he now had a team of superhumans at his side.

The Wrecker and his team have since battled many other superheroes, including the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], [[Doctor Strange]], [[Spider-Man]], and the [[Fantastic Four]]. They participated in the [[Secret Wars]], and have been members of the [[Masters of Evil]]. They have proved to be an annoyingly persistent and resourceful supervillain team.

In ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #500, the power that gave the Wrecking Crew its superstrength dissipated. Desperate, the Crew went to work for [[Arnim Zola]], who gave them the ability to gain superstrength from energy-sources (lightning, psionic attacks, and electric shocks, for example). They battled the Avengers with these abilities, even taking over the world of Polemachus, but were eventually defeated.

In ''[[New Avengers (comic)|New Avengers]]'' #7, the Wrecker, having escaped from the Raft, made his way to the home of a collector of superhuman paraphernalia. There, he stole his original crowbar, regaining his mystic abilities. He was well on his way to defeating a team composed of Spider-Man, [[Luke Cage]], [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] and [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]], but Spider-Woman distracted him using her pheromone powers long enough for Wolverine and Luke Cage to knock him out.  Spider-man left him hanging between two lampposts as the [[SHIELD]] clean-up team arrived right as the New Avengers were called to assist Captain America and Iron Man in the contents ot ''New Avengers'' #8.

==Powers and abilities==
The Wrecker was initially a relatively strong but still ordinary human being. After being magically enchanted, he now has superhuman strength and durability high enough for him to fight toe-to-toe with Thor. He can withstand high amounts of concussive force, and is virtually bulletproof. He can destroy a building with a single punch. At first, the power granted to The Wrecker gave him greater strength than that of an average Asgardian, abling him to lift/press 40 - 50 tons, sufficient to go toe-to-toe with a being as powerful as Thor without dying in the battle. Shared with the others in The Wrecking Crew, his strength was diminished to the 10 - 12 ton level (During The [[Secret Wars]], Spider-Man was able to knock out Bulldozer with one punch.). However, when [[Ulik]] the Troll taught him how to better use his Asgardian-based powers, his strength level was restored to at least the 40 - 50 ton level, even when the other members of The Wrecking Crew kept their power (The Wrecker easily crushed Thunderball's hand after he escaped from his bounds and after Thunderball tried to steal The Wrecker's crowbar). It is therefore conceivable that if the rest of the crew were to lose their powers, the Wrecker's strength would likely double.

The Wrecker's crowbar is the key to his power. Whenever the Wrecker is stripped of his power, it lies dormant in the crowbar until the Wrecker reactivates it. The crowbar is now virtually indestructible, and over time the Wrecker has mastered several magical techniques, similar to Thor's mastery of Mjolnir. The Wrecker can use the crowbar to create force fields, deflect bullets, return to him when thrown, and control the minds of others who try to possess the crowbar. He can also teleport from one place to another with the crowbar, carrying numerous individuals with him.

Despite this, the Wrecker is still a thug at heart, and thus is not too difficult to outwit.

==Appearances in other media==
Wrecker (along with the rest of the Wrecking Crew) appear as villains in the 2006 video game: [[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]. In a reference to the aforementioned New Avenger's appearance, he is the boss in Spider-Woman's training mission.
