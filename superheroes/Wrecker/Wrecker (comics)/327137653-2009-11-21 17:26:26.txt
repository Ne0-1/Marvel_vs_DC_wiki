The '''Wrecker''' ('''Dirk Garthwaite''') is a [[fictional character]] that appears in [[comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The Wrecker was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] and first appears in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|The Mighty Thor]]'' #148 (Jan. 1968).

==Publication history==
Dirk Garthwaite first appears in the title ''Thor'', and is depicted as a former [[manual laborer]] in a [[demolition]]s crew who is fired for his violent and anti-social tendencies. Garthwaite creates a [[costume]] for himself and adopting the alias the ''Wrecker'', commits a series of [[robberies]], demolishing looted locations and leaving a [[crowbar]] at the scene of the crime. The Wrecker enters a [[hotel]] room that, unknown to him, is occupied by [[Asgardian (comics)|Asgardian]] god [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], the [[adopted]] brother and arch-foe of the Thunder God [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. The Wrecker accidentally receives an [[enchantment]] - meant for Loki - from Loki's ally, [[Norn]] Queen [[Karnilla]], and courtesy of his now [[indestructible]] crowbar is granted superhuman strength and stamina. 

Reveling in his new-found power, the Wrecker embarks on a crime spree and also defeats Thor, who at the time has had his power severely reduced by father [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]] (ruler of the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] gods) as punishment for choosing to remain on Earth. The Wrecker is defeated by the female Asgardian warrior [[Sif (Marvel Comics)|Sif]], who animates the [[armor]] of the Asgardian [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]] to save Thor.<ref>''Thor'' #148 - 150 (Jan. - Mar. 1968)</ref> 

The character returns to the title ''Thor'' and battles the Thunder God once again, although a fully restored Thor easily defeats the villain.<ref>''Thor'' #171 (Dec. 1969)</ref> 

The Wrecker returns in the title ''Defenders'', and on this occasion appears with three superpowered partners in crime: [[Thunderball (comics)|Thunderball]]; [[Bulldozer (comics)|Bulldozer]] and [[Piledriver (comics)|Piledriver]]. Empowered when holding the crowbar and it is struck by [[lightning]], the villains join the Wrecker to become the [[Wrecking Crew (comics)|Wrecking Crew]]. While searching for a [[gamma bomb]] built by Thunderball - with which they hope to [[extort]] [[New York City]] - the Wrecking Crew encounter and battle several members of the Defenders: [[Doctor Strange]]; [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Nighthawk]] and the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]. Aided by [[Luke Cage|Power Man]], the heroes defeat the villains.<ref>''Defenders'' #17 - 19 (Nov. 1974 - Jan. 1975)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Courtesy of an Asgardian enchantment on a crowbar, Dirk Garthwaite possesses superhuman strength, stamina and durability ([[bulletproof]]). When he initially shares the Norn power with the Wrecking Crew, the Wrecker's abilities are reduced. After training from Ulik the troll, the Wrecker no longer suffers this handicap, and is now capable of using the crowbar in the same fashion that Thor can utilize the mystic hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]]. The crowbar's abilities include  absorbing and projecting energy; creating [[illusion]]s; generating a [[force field]]; creating minor [[earthquake]]s; [[teleportation]] and returning to the Wrecker when thrown. The Wrecker also shares a mental link with the crowbar, and can mentally control any weak-minded individual touching the object.
