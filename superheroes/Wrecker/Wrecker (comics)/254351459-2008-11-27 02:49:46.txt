The '''Wrecker''' ('''Dirk Garthwaite''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] of the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. The Wrecker was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] and first appears was in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|The Mighty Thor]]'' #148 (January 1968).

==Fictional character biography==
Dirk Garthwaite is a former worker for a demolitions crew who was fired for his violent and anti-social tendencies. Turning to crime, Garthwaite fashions a costume for himself and begins making a series of robberies under the guise of the Wrecker. His calling card is his habit of demolishing looted locations and then leaving a [[crowbar]] at the scene of the crime.

The Wrecker's fortunes change for the better when looting a hotel room that - unknown to him - was currently occupied by [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], the arch foe of the Thunder God [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. At the precise moment that the Wrecker enters Loki is trying to contact his accomplice, the [[Norn]] Queen [[Karnilla]], for an enchantment that will grant him the strength to defeat Thor, both of them having been temporarily depowered by [[Odin (comics)|Odin]] as a punishment for failing to return to [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]]. Karnilla arrives and mistakes Garthwaite for Loki (Garthwaite having knocked the now-mortal Loki out and put on his helmet), granting him the enchantment instead. The Wrecker then possesses superhuman strength, stamina and durability courtesy of a now-indestructible and enchanted crowbar.

Revelling in his new-found power, the Wrecker goes on a crime spree and even defeats a greatly depleted Thor. However, the Wrecker is eventually defeated by the [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]], which the female Asgardian warrior [[Sif (Marvel Comics)|Sif]] occupies in a bid to save Thor. <ref>''Thor'' vol. 1, #148 - 150</ref>

Although sent to prison and heavily sedated, the Wrecker develops an immunity to the medication and escapes to confront Thor once again. Thor, however, has been restored to full power and easily defeats the Wrecker. <ref>''Thor'' vol. 1, #171</ref> Despite this setback, the Wrecker has returned time and again to challenge Thor and other superheroes, often with the aid of the [[Wrecking Crew (comics)|Wrecking Crew]].

===The Wrecking Crew===
The [[Wrecking Crew (comics)|Wrecking Crew]] are formed when Dirk Garthwaite - the Wrecker - is approached by Dr. [[Thunderball (comics)|Eliot Franklin]] in prison and asked to retrieve a gamma bomb Eliot had designed, with the intent of ransoming New York for millions of dollars. Garthwaite manages to retrieve his enchanted crowbar, and during a lightning storm tells Franklin and fellow prisoners [[Bulldozer (comics)|Henry Camp]] and [[Piledriver (comics)|Brian Calusky]] to grip the weapon simultaneously. A lightning bolt then strikes the crowbar and transforms the four men into the Wrecking Crew. They then escape from prison and, in the course of searching for the gamma bomb, are defeated by the Defenders and the hero [[Luke Cage]]. <ref>''Defenders'' Vol. 1, #17 - 19</ref> They return again and again to battle many superheroes, most notably Thor. <ref>First battle was ''Thor'' vol. 1, #304</ref>

The Wrecker has since been hired by the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the Superhuman Registration Act, <ref>''New Avengers'' #35 (Oct. 2007)</ref> and battles the [[Enforcers (comics)|Enforcers]], the bodyguards of [[Mister Fear]]. <ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #102</ref>

As part of the Hood's gang, he later joins with heroes to fight against the Skrull invading force in New York City.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #6</ref> As seen in flashbacks, he leads an aborted mutiny against the Hood after Skrull infiltrators attempt to replace fellow group member [[Madame Masque]]. The Hood's discovery and execution of the Skrull impersonating the [[Slug (comics)|Slug]] helps re-patch the Wrecker's loyalty. <ref>"The New Avengers" #46</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
After being magically enchanted, Dirk Garthwaite now has superhuman strength, stamina and durability. The Wrecker can withstand high amounts of concussive force, and is virtually bulletproof. He can destroy a building with a single punch. When first enchanted the Wrecker possessed strength greater than that of an average Asgardian, although still far below the strength range of Thor. The Wrecker was only capable of matching Thor during their very first battle, when Thor's power was reduced by Odin. 

When the Wrecker first shared his power with the other members of the Wrecking Crew, his abilities were quartered, with his new strength level being significantly lower. This changed when [[Ulik]], another foe of Thor, taught the Wrecker how to master his Asgardian-based powers. <ref>''Thor'' vol. 1, #418</ref> The Wrecker is now capable of retaining his original powers while still empowering the other members of The Wrecking Crew.

The Wrecker's enchanted crowbar is the key to his power. When stripped of his crowbar, the Wrecker once more becomes Dirk Garthwaite. The Asgardian energy then lies dormant in the crowbar until the Wrecker reactivates it. The Wrecker can also utilize the crowbar in many of the same ways that Thor utilizes [[Mjolnir (Marvel Comics)|Mjolnir]]: Examples include deflecting bullets, returning to the Wrecker when thrown, creating force fields; teleporting himself and companions, creating minor illusions, projects energy blasts either directly or into the ground to create minor earthquakes, and controlling the minds of those who try to possess the crowbar.  The crowbar only works for the Wrecker or the other members of the Wrecking Crew.  Others who seize the crowbar, such as [[Spider-Man]], receive no benefit from it.

==In other media==
===Video games===
The Wrecker and the other members of the Wrecking Crew appear in the videogame ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]''.
