'''Berzerker''' ('''Ray Carter''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] from the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe. His first and last appearance was in ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' #11 (December 1986). Despite only appearing in one issue, Bezerker has so far appeared in two X-Men animated series, both of which in a supporting role. 

==Fictional character biography==
'''Berzerker''' was a member and the leader of [[The Tunnelers]], an offshoot group of [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]] who hated [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]]'s main group and dubbed them Drain Dwellers. Initially a group of ten, six of the Tunnelers were killed when the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]] were sent to kill the Morlocks. Berzerker and three others survived the attack, only to get in another battle with [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] and [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], thinking they were Marauders too. The battle ends when the Tunnelers figure out that the [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] members are not their enemies.

Joining X-Factor at their base, the Tunnelers find out about their hosts' mock mutant hunter identities. The Tunnelers eventually leave hoping to find a new home in [[New Jersey]]. They ran into a human street gang called the [[Savage Wolf gang]] who tried to rob them. The Tunnelers fought back, ending in the deaths of the Tunneler [[Blowhard (comics)|Blowhard]] and two of the three gang members. They then got in a confrontation with the police where fellow Tunneler and Berzerker's love interest, [[Scaleface]], was shot dead. [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey]] arrived to save the remaining two Tunnelers, but it was too late; Berzerker was enraged by the loss of Scaleface and vowed revenge on all humanity. Before Cyclops could reason with him Berzerker let out a giant energy attack at him, blaming X-Factor for the Tunnelers' destruction. Cyclops fired back, overpowering Berzerker's initial shot. The optic blast from Cyclops knocked Berzerker into a river, electrocuting himself with his own powers resulting in his death. [[Masque (comics)|Masque]] was the only Tunneler that survived.<ref>''X-Factor'' #11</ref>

Berzerker is resurrected by means of the [[Techno-organic virus#The Transmode Virus|Transmode Virus]] to serve as part of [[Selene (comics)|Selene]]'s army of deceased mutants.  Under the control of Selene and [[Eli Bard]], he takes part in the assault on the mutant nation of [[Utopia (comics)|Utopia]].<ref name ="XNecrosha">''X-Necrosha'' #1, December 2009</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Berzerker's mutant powers allow him to generate and control pulsing bolts of electrical energy. He did this by absorbing and manipulating the energies of the entire electromagnetic spectrum. He could also fly and tap into, absorb, observe or listen to television or radio broadcasts, his electrical powers enabled him to create electrical energy shields, and consume his body into raw lightning energy.

==In other media==
===Television===
*Berserker is a student at the Xavier Institute in the animated program ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'' and is voiced by [[Tony Sampson]]. His name is stated as Ray Crisp. Unlike his comic counterpart, he is laid back and generally non-violent. His involvement with the Morlocks is never really described, however he does seem to have met them before at some point (when mutants are being hunted, he is the one who leads [[Sunspot]], [[Multiple Man]], [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]], [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]], [[Tabitha Smith|Boom Boom]], and [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] to their base in the sewers in order to hide out). In a later episode, when [[Spyke]] is poisoned and taken to be healed by the Morlocks, Ray is the only one who notices Callisto's presence and deduces where they are hiding. Later, when he is trying to escape the sewers, he is briefly pursued by Scaleface, begging her to just let him go. This is the only reference to their relationship in the comics. He seems to be familliar with all the Morlocks in that episode, however it could simply be explained by the fact that he and most of the New Mutants spent a few days living with them.
*Berserker appears in ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men]]'' as part of Prof. Xavier's future X-Men.
