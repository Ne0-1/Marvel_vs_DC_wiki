When not using her powers, Ashley is a proverbial 'big fish in a small pond', being the most famous fashion model in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]], her hometown. Although offers have come her way numerous times for more prospective opportunities, she has declined them all, choosing to stay in Milwaukee, with the team she considers family.

Bertha was with the rest of the Great Lakes Avengers when the team first encountered [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] and [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]].<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #46</ref>  With the team, she then assisted Hawkeye and the [[West Coast Avengers]] against "[[That Which Endures]]."<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #48-49</ref> They also assisted Mockingbird in a holding action against [[Terminus (comics)|Terminus]].<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #19</ref>
