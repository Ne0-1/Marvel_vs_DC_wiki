==Fictional character biography==
Not a lot is known of Bertha's life before she responded to [[Mr. Immortal]]'s advertisement for a hero team, the team would become the Great Lakes Avengers. It was revealed in the ''G.L.A.'' mini-series that Ashley is in fact a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]].

When not using her powers, Ashley is a proverbial 'big fish in a small pond', being the most famous fashion model in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]], her hometown. Although offers have come her way numerous times for more prospective opportunities, she has declined them all, choosing to stay in Milwaukee with the team she considers family.

Bertha was with the rest of the Great Lakes Avengers when the team first encountered [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] and [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]].<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #46</ref>  With the team, she then assisted Hawkeye and the [[West Coast Avengers]] against "[[That Which Endures]]."<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #48-49</ref> They also assisted Mockingbird in a holding action against [[Terminus (comics)|Terminus]].<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #19</ref>

In an attempt to evict Deadpool from their Initiative-sponsored headquarters, Big Bertha agrees on one date. Confusion reigns as she appears for the date in her slim form. After saving lives in a dockside all-you-can-eat restaurant Bertha realizes that Deadpool was only attracted to her large form. She lectures him, telling of her experiences of only being valued for her looks in her slim form. In response, Deadpool removes his mask revealing his cancer-scarred face. Bertha promptly vomits in the parking lot, much to Deadpool's chagrin. Bertha's colleagues manage to evict Deadpool.<ref>''Deadpool GLI Summer Fun Spectacular'' #1 (2007)</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Big Bertha has the ability to make herself super strong and durable (to the point of being bullet-proof) by becoming extraordinarily obese. She can also purge most fat from her body through vomiting to take on a slimmer appearance.<ref>''GLA'' #2</ref>

In addition to her mutant powers, Ashley is also a skilled pilot of conventional jet aircraft.
