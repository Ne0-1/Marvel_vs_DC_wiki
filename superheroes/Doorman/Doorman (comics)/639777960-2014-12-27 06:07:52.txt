'''Doorman''' ('''DeMarr Davis''') is a fictional character, a mutant [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe that first appeared in the pages of the ''[[West Coast Avengers]]'' in 1989. 

==Fictional character biography==
Little is known of Doorman's life before he responded to [[Mr. Immortal]]'s advertisement for a hero team. This team would eventually become the [[Great Lakes Avengers]]. It has been revealed, however, that he is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] and has an [[African-American]] complexion.

Before joining the Great Lakes Avengers, DeMarr Davis was an average American youngster. Sometime during his years in college, DeMarr's mother died. After completing four years of college and three years of graduate school, DeMarr decided to answer Mr. Immortal's newspaper ad asking "costumed adventurers" to join together and form a team. DeMarr, being a mutant and possessing his unique teleporting ability, is able to allow his teammates entrance into almost any structure, thus creating both a stealthy entrance as well as a surprise attack. He joined the original incarnation of the Great Lakes Avengers.

Doorman is, however, the most cynical of the Great Lakes Avengers, constantly comparing the team to the real [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], usually at the most inappropriate times, and feeling at times embarrassed by his friends. Nonetheless, DeMarr cares for them deeply, and values each and every member of the team. He was responsible for creating the fallen GLA'ers memorial at GLA HQ.

He also still blames himself for the death of one of their newest recruits, the [[Grasshopper (comics)|Grasshopper]], who died in battle with [[Batroc]] and his minions. Zaran (one of Batroc's henchmen) threw a [[sai (weapon)|sai]] at Doorman, who quickly activated his powers, only for the blade to land directly in the head of Grasshopper (who was standing right behind him), killing him instantly. DeMarr feels that it is his fault that Grasshopper died and therefore sunk into a slight depression. During this time he also tried to scare another new member, [[Squirrel Girl]] off of the team because he feared that she too would die while in service to the GLA.<ref>''GLA'' #2</ref>

Doorman has died as well, sacrificing himself so that Mr. Immortal could stop the [[villain]] [[Maelstrom (comics)|Maelstrom]]. He met with the other dead GLA'ers in the afterlife, including Grasshopper, who forgave him. Doorman was, however, intrigued by the absence of [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]]. Shortly afterwards, he was summoned by the [[cosmos|cosmic]] entity [[Oblivion (comics)|Oblivion]], who declared that thanks to his connection to the [[Darkforce]] Dimension, Doorman could prove useful to him, akin to [[Deathurge]] who had recently been captured by Mr. Immortal. Doorman therefore replaced [[Deathurge]] and became Oblivion's new angel of death.<ref>''G.L.A.'' #4</ref>

Taking Deathurge's place, Doorman took Maelstrom to the afterlife after he was tricked into killing himself by Mr. Immortal, and was able to return to the GLA. As a servant of Oblivion, he is able to summon skis to fly and is intangible. Doorman continues to be a member of the GLA, although after he helped his friends save the universe from Maelstrom, he understands the team's importance and has a newfound respect for them. However, a subpoena from the real Avengers forced the team to change their name to the Great Lakes [[X-Men]] or GLX.<ref>''GLA: Misassembled'' #1â€“4 (2006)</ref>

Some time after the battle with Maelstrom, Doorman was celebrating Christmas with the rest of the GLX when he informed the team that he had to go and visit his father. Upon reaching his father's house, his father quickly complained that DeMarr was throwing his life away and needed to join the real world. He told his son that he had "stupid powers" and "all the other heroes have better powers than you." Realizing that his own happiness was more important than his father's respect, DeMarr finally admitted the truth to his father: that he had died and came back as the angel of death. He had not come back to visit his father but rather to collect his soul as he had fallen off the roof while setting up Christmas lights and died. Ironically, the revelation of DeMarr's new role in the universe greatly pleased his father, who couldn't wait to brag to all his friends in heaven about how his son was the new angel of death.{{issue|date=August 2013}}

Doorman and his teammates participated in a charity superhero poker tournament hosted by the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], where [[Flatman (comics)|Flatman]] beat their host in the final round.  Flatman's status as champion inspired the team to take the new name of the Great Lakes Champions, after being discouraged from affiliation with both the X-Men and the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] by members of those teams present at the tournament, ignoring former [[Champions (comics)|Champions of Los Angeles]] member [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]]' protests.<ref>''The Thing'' vol. 2 #8 (2006)</ref>

===Civil War/The Initiative===
{{see also|Civil War (comics)}}
All of the Great Lakes Champions have registered with the United States government as required by the [[Registration Acts (comics)#2006 Superhuman Registration Act|Superhuman Registration Act]], as revealed when the mercenary [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]] mistakenly attempted to apprehend them for violating the Act, only to be defeated by the GLC and informed that they had already registered.<ref>''Cable & Deadpool'' #30</ref>

DeMarr has been identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes who appear on the cover of the comic book ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #1.<ref>[http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 Avengers: The Initiative #1 Character Map]</ref>

Doorman and his teammates became the Initiative group in charge of [[Wisconsin]], calling themselves the Great Lakes Initiative. They were given a rescue mission to save [[Dionysus (Marvel Comics)|Dionysus]] after he fell from [[Mount Olympus]]. During the task, Deadpool ambushes Mr. Immortal and Flatman. Flatman recruited him as a reserve member of the team but the mercenary eventually overstayed his welcome. After many failed attempts, Deadpool is kicked out of the group by Squirrel Girl.<ref>''Deadpool/GLI Summer Fun Spectacular''</ref>

===Secret Invasion===
During the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline, the team confronted a [[Skrull]] disguised as Grasshopper, with help from Gravity and Catwalk.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #19 (Dec. 2008)</ref>

===Fear Itself===
During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Doorman and his teammates end up confronting [[Asbestos Man]] who takes advantage of the fear and chaos that is happening.<ref>''Fear Itself: The Home Front'' #6</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Doorman is capable of teleporting someone anywhere, but with the limitation that it has to be in the next room, and with his own body serving as a portal of sorts. His mutant ability operates by tapping into the [[Darkforce]] Dimension, as several other Marvel Universe teleporters do (such as [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak]], the [[Vanisher]], [[Silhouette (comics)|Silhouette]], etc.).  Originally, his all-black appearance was a costume of apparently conventional material, with stark white eyepieces in the mask as contrast.  However, since becoming Oblivion's servant, his Doorman "body" seems to be an assumed shape rather than a simple costume, and he can transform at will from this form to his non-costumed self. 

He also gained the ability to collect the souls of the recently deceased and deliver them to [[Oblivion (comics)|Oblivion]]. While doing so, he appears visible only to the soul he is collecting, and possibly also his teammate Mr. Immortal, who could perceive Deathurge. He also gained intangibility and can fly with skis that he can summon at will.

==Appearance==
After dying and being resurrected by Oblivion to become his new "angel of death", Doorman's appearance has changed, as he now possesses white gloves, boots and a cape, and skis: the trademarks of his predecessor, [[Deathurge]]. In fact, his only difference in appearance from Deathurge are the white "eyes" that were once the eyepieces of his original costume.
