==Character History==
'''Doorman (DeMarr Davis)''' is a [[fictional]] [[superhero]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] universe who first appeared in the pages of the ''Avengers West Coast'' in 1989. Not a lot is known of Doorman's life before he joined the [[Great Lakes Avengers]] although it has been revealed that his powers are the cause of him being a [[mutant]].

Doorman's purpose in the GLA is that as his name suggests, as Doorman. With his unique teleporting ability, he is able to allow his teammates entrance into almost any structure, and thus create both a stealthy entrance as well as a surprise attack.

Doorman is however, the most cynical of the Great Lakes Avengers, constantly comparing the team to the real [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], ussually at the most inapproiate times, and feeling at times embarrassed by his friends. Nonetheless, DeMarr cares for them deeply, and values each and every member of the team. He was responsible for the fallen GLA'ers memorial at GLA HQ.

He also still blames himself for the death of one of their newest recruits, the [[Grasshopper (comics)|Grasshopper]], who died in battle with [[Batroc]] and his minions. Zaran (one of Batroc's helpers) threw a [[sai (weapon)|sai]] at Doorman, who quickly activated his powers, only for the blade to land directly in Grasshopper's head, killing him instantly.
{{spoiler-about|the GLA mini}}
Doorman himself has died as well, sacrificing himself so that Mr. Immortal could stop the [[villain]] [[Maelstrom (comics)|Maelstrom]] and he met with the other dead GLA'ers in the afterlife. Grasshopper forgave him, although Doorman questioned the absence of [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]]. Shortly afterwards, he was summoned by the [[cosmic]] entity [[Oblivion (comics)|Oblivion]], who declared that thanks to Doorman's connection to the [[Darkforce]] dimension, Doorman could prove useful to him, akin to [[Deathurge]].

Taking Deathurge's place, Doorman took Maelstrom to the afterlife, and was able to return to the GLA. What other effects his new role as servant of Oblivion have had on him, have yet to be revealed, as well as the fate of Deathurge himself. Doorman continues to be a member of the GLA.

==Powers==
Doorman is a class-10 teleporter, meaning that he is capable of teleporting someone anywhere, but with the limitation that it has to be in the next room. This mutant ability comes from tapping into the Darkforce dimension, and it has left him as a seemingly permanent completely black appearance, besides the white dominos that reflect his eyes; however, in reality this is simply his costume. Doorman is actually African-American. What new powers Doorman has acquired by becoming a servant of Oblivion have not been revealed, besides gaining white boots and gloves, a white cape and black skies by which he can fly.
