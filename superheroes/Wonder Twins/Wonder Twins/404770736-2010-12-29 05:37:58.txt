'''The Wonder Twins''', '''Zan''' and '''Jayna''', are [[fictional]] [[extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] [[comic book]] [[superheroes]] published by [[DC Comics]]. Their first comic book appearance was in ''[[Super Friends]]'' #7 (October 1977), by [[E. Nelson Bridwell]] and [[Ramona Fradon]]. A modernized version of the twins debuted in ''[[Extreme Justice]]'' #9 (October 1995), by Ivan Velez and Al Rio.

==Publication history==
The duo made their debut in ''[[The All-New Super Friends Hour]]'' and went on to appear in ''[[Challenge of the Super Friends]]'', ''[[The World's Greatest Super Friends]]'', ''[[Super Friends (1980)|Super Friends]]'', and ''[[Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show]]''. Zan (voiced by [[Michael Bell (actor)|Michael Bell]]) and Jayna (voiced by Liberty Williams) are siblings from the planet Exxor (also spelled Exor) who were being informally trained by the superheroes. Unlike their predecessors, [[Wendy Harris (Super Friends)|Wendy Harris]] and [[Marvin White (Super Friends)|Marvin White]], this pair was able to participate in combat with abilities of their own.

The characters were later introduced in the ''Super Friends'' comic, where they were far more competent and heroic.

==Fictional character biography==
===Extreme Justice===
{{Main|Extreme Justice}}
In the 1990s they were introduced into the main [[DC Universe]] in the series ''[[Extreme Justice]]''. The series rewrote and updated their [[origin story]] so that they were introduced as the escaped slaves of an alien overlord, and were later emancipated by the Justice League. These new versions were much more powerful than previous depictions. In ''Extreme Justice'' #9 (October 1995), unable to speak [[English language|English]], they accidentally attack some civilians and the Justice League. The pair join [[Captain Atom]]'s team in issue #16 (May 1996)<ref name="dc-extr">{{Citation | last = Beatty | first = Scott | author-link = Scott Beatty | contribution = Extreme Justice | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages = 117 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>. During their fight with the JLA, Zan became an ice [[golem]], a water monster, and a demonic-looking [[whirlpool]]; while Jayna became a [[griffin]], a [[werewolf]], and a sea serpent.

===Ten Elements of the Universe===
As revealed in these stories, Zan and Jayna are two of the ten hereditary protectors of Exor. The "Ten Elements of the Universe" is the name given to a group of five pairs of royal twins on Exor, each pair possesses elemental powers including fire, love, vapors, plants, sound, metal, and shadows.<ref>http://www.mykey3000.com/cosmicteams/profiles/zan+jayna.htm</ref>

Although rarely seen today, this version of the Wonder Twins is still part of the current [[DC Universe]]. Later they appeared in ''[[Young Justice]]'' #49–51, wearing uniforms which resembled t-shirts and jeans, to help avenge the murder of [[Empress (comics)|Empress]]'s parents. Apparently, the Wonder Twins enjoy the taste of CDs, as they ate several of [[Cassie Sandsmark|Wonder Girl]]'s favorite discs.

==Powers and abilities==
[[Image:WonderTwins New.JPG|150px|thumb|The new, revamped Wonder Twins. Art by [[Todd Nauck]].]]
The Wonder Twins powers are activated when they touch each other and speak the phrase, "Wonder Twin powers, activate!" (It has been revealed that this phrase was unnecessary, just a habit of theirs.  Physical contact, however, is required. If the two are out of reach of each other, they are unable to activate their powers.) As they were about to transform, they would each announce their intended form. "Shape of...", "Form of..."

Zan can transform into water at any state (solid, liquid, gas). In the case of becoming solid ice, he can also become any form he chooses, from a cage for a criminal to, implausibly, complex machinery (such as a rocket engine). He also changed into a gelatinous form at one point. On another occasion, he transformed into [[liquid nitrogen]]. By combining with already-existing water, Zan could also increase his mass or volume in the water form chosen. In addition, he can transform himself into atmospheric disturbances involving water, such as a blizzard, a monsoon, or a typhoon. 

Jayna is a shape-shifter; she could transform into any animal, whether real, mythological, indigenous to Earth or to some other planet, like [[Beast Boy]], so long as she knows the common name. She has been known to take the form of anything from an ant to a whale.

In the ''Super Friends'' comic book, their powers were shown to be more extensive. By transforming into an animal of [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonian]] origin, for instance, Jayna could gain both the creature's natural abilities and the [[Powers and abilities of Superman|super-powers]] that all Kryptonians possess under Earth-like conditions; she was even capable of overpowering [[Superman]] in the form of a Kryptonian animal, thereby surpassing Superman's superhuman powers.<ref>''Super Friends'' #42 (March 1981)--Jayna defeats Superman in a training exercise by becoming a Kryptonian ''Tanthou Flez'' ("Winged One")</ref>  Similarly, Zan was able to transform into anything tangentially related to water or ice, including a [[Jötunn|frost giant]].

In addition to their powers of transformation, the two share a telepathic link, enabling one to alert the other over a distance when in dire circumstances. Their mutual telepathy would also explain how they were able to assume forms that allowed cooperation without previous discussion of strategy.

The Wonder Twins also had a pet Space Monkey called [[Gleek (Super Friends)|Gleek]] who had a useful prehensile tail and whose body could act as a conduit for the twins to activate their powers should they be out of reach. Gleek also served as a courier when the twins needed to travel: Jayna would typically transform into a large [[eagle]], and Zan would transform into (plain) [[water]], "jumping" into a bucket which Gleek would be holding while riding atop Jayna in her eagle form. (This led to the joke by some fans that Gleek's superpower was to make a bucket appear and disappear at will. ''See [[hammerspace]].'') Possibly unrelated to the naming of this Space Monkey, the verb "to gleek" is the projection or "spitting" of saliva from the submandibular gland underneath the tongue.

==Other versions==
===Super Friends===
{{Main|Super Friends}}
[[Image:Wonder Twins.jpg|thumb|150px|right|The Wonder Twins as they appeared in ''[[The All-New Super Friends Hour]]'']]
According to the ''Super Friends'' comic book, Zan and Jayna are Exorian [[metahumans|metas]], genetic throwbacks to an ancient race of Exorian shapeshifters.<ref>As seen in ''Super Friends'' #7 (October 1977)</ref> Their parents died when they were still babies (during a [[plague (disease)|plague]]), and, because of their origin, no Exorians wanted to adopt them. They ended up adopted by the owner of a Space [[Circus]], who only wanted to use them as [[sideshow]] freaks. Fortunately, the circus's clown (or "laugh-maker") was a kind man and raised them. He also gave them Gleek as a pet. Eventually, as teens, the pair escaped the circus and hid on a planet where a space villain called Grax (an enemy of [[Superman]]) had set his headquarters. Spying on him, they learned that Grax was planning to destroy the Earth using hidden superbombs. The twins decided to travel to Earth and warn the [[Justice League]]; that was how they came to replace Wendy and Marvin (who were planning on retiring as heroes anyway) as their sidekicks. The heroes also arranged for the kids to live with an old scientist called [[Professor Carter Nichols]], and they even took secret identities as John and Joanna Fleming. "Johan" and "Johanna" were supposedly transfer students from Esko, [[Sweden]], disguised with blonde hair (Zan wore a wig, while Jayna used her powers to transform into a human to change her hair color and ear shape), to allow them to attend [[Gotham City]] High School.

===Kingdom Come===
{{Main|Kingdom Come (comics)}}
In ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'' #2, Zan and Jayna have cameos as a waiter and waitress at a bar that caters to a superhuman clientele.

==In other media==
===''Justice League Unlimited''===
{{Main|Justice League Unlimited}}
*In the ''Justice League Unlimited'' episode "Injustice For All", statues of the Twins are briefly seen in a museum devoted to super-powered heroes.  Later in the same scene, the two statues are destroyed during the battle between the heroes and villains.
*Two characters called '''Downpour''' and *'''Shifter''' appear in the episode "Ultimatum". They are members of the [[Ultimen]], a group of superheroes created by the [[United States government|government]]. The group is a [[pastiche]] of the heroes that were created for ''Super Friends'', with Downpour and Shifter specifically a pastiche of the Wonder Twins. Downpour and his twin sister, Shifter, voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]], have [[albino]] white skin, pink eyes and pointy ears.<br>Clones of the characters later appear in the episode ''Panic in the Sky''. Like their adaptions into the mainstream DC Comics before, these two had much greater control and use over their powers than their original cartoon versions.

===''Smallville''===
{{Main|Smallville (TV series)}}
[[Image:SmallvilleWonderTwins.jpg|200px|thumb|[[David Gallagher]] as Zan and [[Allison Scagliotti]] as Jayna in the episode "Idol".]]
*Zan and Jayna appeared in the ''Smallville'' season nine episode, ''Idol'', which aired on November 13, 2009. Zan was played by [[David Gallagher]] and Jayna by [[Allison Scagliotti]]. They  both carried cell phones that had an image of Gleek on the back and that made the sound of Gleek laughing as a [[ringtone]]. Though not explicitly labeled as aliens, the two are implied to be from another world{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} and claim to be of [[Swedish people|Swedish]] descent in order to explain their odd sounding names. The Twins are portrayed as being obsessed with "The Blur" (the name given to Clark Kent before he officially adopts the [[Superman]] identity), and attempt to impersonate him in order to build up his positive reputation. They send a crate to young reporter [[Lois Lane]] containing several bound and gagged drug dealers, who turn out to be undercover cops that Zan and Jayna abducted by mistake, thus ruining a calculated police drug sting. When an attempt at stopping a robbery accidentally causes a citywide blackout in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], the Twins are ambushed and abducted by Clark and his partner [[Chloe Sullivan]]. After being threatened into giving up their vigilante activities, Zan and Jayna prove their worth when Lois is thrown from the rooftop of the [[Daily Planet]] building by a crooked politician who wants to expose "The Blur's" true identity. Jayna transforms into an attack dog and captures the politician as he attempts to flee the scene, while Zan transforms his body into a massive cloud of mist, providing the necessary cover Clark needs to lower her safely to the ground. After this, the Twins are encouraged by Clark to continue their super heroics outside of Metropolis, albeit on their reputations rather than attempting to emulate him.
