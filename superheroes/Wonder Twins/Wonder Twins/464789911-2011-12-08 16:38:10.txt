'''The Wonder Twins''', '''Zan''' and '''Jayna''', are [[fictional]] [[extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] [[comic book]] [[superheroes]] published by [[DC Comics]]. Their first comic book appearance was in ''[[Super Friends]]'' #7 (October 1977), by [[E. Nelson Bridwell]] and [[Ramona Fradon]]. A modernized version of the twins debuted in ''[[Extreme Justice]]'' #9 (October 1995), by Ivan Velez and Al Rio.

==Publication history==
The duo made their debut in ''[[The All-New Super Friends Hour]]'' and went on to appear in ''[[The World's Greatest Super Friends]]'', ''[[Super Friends (1980)|Super Friends]]'', and ''[[Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show]]''. Zan (voiced by [[Michael Bell (actor)|Michael Bell]]) and Jayna (voiced by Liberty Williams) are siblings from the planet Exxor (also spelled Exor) who were being informally trained by the superheroes. Unlike their predecessors, [[Wendy and Marvin|Wendy Harris and Marvin White]], this pair was able to participate in combat with abilities of their own.

The characters were later introduced in the ''Super Friends'' comic.

In the 1990s they were introduced into the main [[DC Universe]] in the series ''[[Extreme Justice]]''. The series rewrote and updated their [[origin story]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Extreme Justice===
{{Main|Extreme Justice}}
The twins are introduced as escaped slaves of an alien overlord. Unable to speak [[English language|English]], they inadvertently attack some civilians and the Justice League. During their fight with the JLA, Zan becomes an ice [[golem]], a water monster, and a demonic-looking [[whirlpool]], while Jayna becomes a [[griffin]], a [[werewolf]], and a sea serpent.<ref>''Extreme Justice'' #9 (October 1995)</ref> The pair are later emancipated by the Justice League and join [[Captain Atom]]'s team in issue #16 (May 1996).<ref name="dc-extr">{{Citation | last = Beatty | first = Scott | author-link = Scott Beatty | contribution = Extreme Justice | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages = 117 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>

===Ten Elements of the Universe===
Zan and Jayna are revealed to be two of the ten hereditary protectors of Exor. The "Ten Elements of the Universe" is the name given to a group of five pairs of royal twins on Exor, each pair possesses elemental powers including fire, love, vapors, plants, sound, metal, and shadows.<ref>http://www.mykey3000.com/cosmicteams/profiles/zan+jayna.htm</ref>

They later help avenge the murder of [[Empress (comics)|Empress]]'s parents, wearing uniforms which resembled t-shirts and jeans.<ref>''[[Young Justice]]'' #49–51</ref> The Wonder Twins apparently enjoy the taste of CDs, as they ate several of [[Cassie Sandsmark|Wonder Girl]]'s favorite discs.

==Powers and abilities==
[[Image:WonderTwins New.JPG|150px|thumb|The new, revamped Wonder Twins. Art by [[Todd Nauck]].]]
The Wonder Twins powers are activated when they touch each other and speak the phrase, "Wonder Twin powers activate!" This phrase is unnecessary and just a habit of theirs.  Physical contact, however, is required. If the two are out of reach of each other, they are unable to activate their powers. As they are about to transform, they would each announce their intended form. "Shape of...", "Form of..."

Zan can transform into water at any state (solid, liquid, gas) and add to his mass by incorporating water in his immediate area. In the case of becoming solid ice, he can also become any form he chooses, from a 5,000 foot humanoid ice giant to a cage for a criminal to complex machinery (such as a rocket engine{{cn|date=September 2011}}). He changes into a gelatinous form at one point. On another occasion, he transformed into [[liquid nitrogen]]. In addition, he can transform himself into atmospheric disturbances involving water, such as a blizzard, a monsoon, or a typhoon. 

Jayna can transform into any animal, whether real, mythological, indigenous to Earth or to some other planet, like [[Beast Boy]], so long as she knows the common name. She has been known to take the form of anything from an ant to a whale.

In the ''Super Friends'' comic book, their powers were shown to be more extensive. By transforming into an animal of [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonian]] origin, for instance, Jayna could gain both the creature's natural abilities and the [[Powers and abilities of Superman|super-powers]] that all Kryptonians possess under Earth-like conditions; she was even capable of overpowering [[Superman]] in the form of a Kryptonian animal.<ref>''Super Friends'' #42 (March 1981)--Jayna defeats Superman in a training exercise by becoming a Kryptonian ''Tanthou Flez'' ("Winged One")</ref>  Similarly, Zan was able to transform into anything tangentially related to water or ice, including a [[Jötunn|frost giant]].

In addition to their powers of transformation, the two share a telepathic link, enabling one to alert the other over a distance when in dire circumstances.

The Wonder Twins have a pet Space Monkey called [[Gleek (Super Friends)|Gleek]] who had a useful prehensile tail and who could act as a conduit for the twins to activate their powers should they be out of reach. Gleek also served as a courier when the twins needed to travel: Jayna would typically transform into a large [[eagle]], and Zan would transform into [[water]], "jumping" into a bucket which Gleek would be holding while riding atop Jayna in her eagle form. (This led to the joke by some fans{{cn|date=September 2011}} that Gleek's superpower was to make a bucket appear and disappear at will. ''See [[hammerspace]].'')

==Other versions==
===Super Friends===
{{Main|Super Friends}}
[[Image:Wonder Twins.jpg|thumb|150px|right|The Wonder Twins as they appeared in ''[[The All-New Super Friends Hour]]'']]
According to the ''Super Friends'' comic book, Zan and Jayna are Exorian [[metahumans|metas]], genetic throwbacks to an ancient race of Exorian shapeshifters.<ref>''Super Friends'' #7 (October 1977)</ref> Their parents died when they were still babies during a [[plague (disease)|plague]], and, because of their origin, no Exorians want to adopt them. They are adopted by the owner of a Space [[Circus]] who only wanted to use them as [[sideshow]] freaks. Fortunately, the circus's clown (or "laugh-maker") was a kind man and raised them. He also gives them Gleek as a pet. Eventually, as teens, the pair escape the circus and hide on a planet where a space villain called Grax (an enemy of [[Superman]]) had established his headquarters. Spying on him, they learn that Grax was planning to destroy the Earth using hidden superbombs. The twins decide to travel to Earth and warn the [[Justice League]], which how they come to replace Wendy and Marvin (who were planning on retiring as heroes anyway) as their sidekicks. The heroes arrange for the kids to live with an old scientist named [[Professor Carter Nichols]] and they even take secret identities as John and Joanna Fleming. "Johan" and "Johanna" were supposedly transfer students from Esko, [[Sweden]], disguised with blonde hair (Zan wore a wig, while Jayna uses her powers to transform into a human to change her hair color and ear shape), to allow them to attend [[Gotham City]] High School.

==In other media==
===''Justice League Unlimited''===
{{Main|Justice League Unlimited}}
*In the ''Justice League Unlimited'' episode "Injustice For All", statues of the Twins are briefly seen in a museum devoted to super-powered heroes.  Later in the same scene, the two statues are destroyed during the battle between the heroes and villains.
*Two characters called '''Downpour''' and '''Shifter''' appear in the episode "Ultimatum". They are members of the [[Ultimen]], a group of superheroes created by the [[United States government|government]]. The group is a [[pastiche]] of the heroes that were created for ''Super Friends'', with Downpour and Shifter specifically a pastiche of the Wonder Twins. Downpour and his twin sister, Shifter, voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]], have [[albino]] white skin, pink eyes and pointy ears. Clones of the characters later appear in the episode ''Panic in the Sky''.

===''Smallville''===
{{Main|Smallville (TV series)}}
[[Image:SmallvilleWonderTwins.jpg|200px|thumb|[[David Gallagher]] as Zan and [[Allison Scagliotti]] as Jayna in the episode "Idol".]]
*Zan and Jayna appeared in the ''Smallville'' season nine episode, ''Idol'', which aired on November 13, 2009. Zan was played by [[David Gallagher]] and Jayna by [[Allison Scagliotti]]. They both carry cell phones that have an image of Gleek on the back and that make the sound of Gleek laughing as a [[ringtone]]. Though not explicitly labeled as aliens, the two are implied to be from another world{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} and claim to be of [[Swedish people|Swedish]] descent in order to explain their odd sounding names. The Twins are portrayed as being obsessed with "The Blur" (the name given to Clark Kent before he officially adopts the [[Superman]] identity), and attempt to impersonate him in order to build up his positive reputation. They send a crate to young reporter [[Lois Lane]] containing several bound and gagged drug dealers who turn out to be undercover cops that Zan and Jayna abducted by mistake, thus ruining a calculated police drug sting. When an attempt at stopping a robbery accidentally causes a citywide blackout in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], the Twins are ambushed and abducted by Clark and his partner [[Chloe Sullivan]]. After being threatened into giving up their vigilante activities, Zan and Jayna prove their worth when Lois is thrown from the rooftop of the [[Daily Planet]] building by a crooked politician who wants to expose "The Blur's" true identity. Jayna transforms into an attack dog and captures the politician as he attempts to flee the scene, while Zan transforms his body into a massive cloud of mist, providing the cover Clark needs to lower her safely to the ground unobserved. After this, the Twins are encouraged by Clark to continue their super heroics outside of Metropolis, albeit on their own reputations rather than attempting to emulate him.

==In popular culture==
* In a cutaway gag in an episode of ''[[Family Guy]]'', Peter shows himself as Zan and transforms into Jayna's tampon, going into her purse and saying that it was time for the waiting game.
* In a segment of ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' the roles of Zan and Jayna were taken by the Olsen Twins.  The two young women had to defeat a monstrous dragon creature.  Gleek was killed in the process by a banana peel that the monster slipped on.
* In Season Three, episode 13 of ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'' titled "My Porcelain God", JD has a daydream about his and Turk's "best moment", which was when JD found a double prize in his cereal.  The prizes were two decoder rings, which he and Turk used to pretend be the Wonder Twins.  After they both show the rings and say "activate" while touching the rings together, JD announces that he is going to take the form of an ice menorah.
* In an episode of ''[[Girlfriends]]'', Joan and William get excited about planning an event and pretend to do the Wonder Twins transformation sequence complete with calling their forms.
* In the 6/12/2002 strip of the popular web comic, ''[[Penny Arcade]]'', Gabe and Tycho discuss whether Wonder Twins was about incest.
* In the first episode of Season 8 of NCIS, Tony DiNozzo described the Wonder Twins as TV superheroes when they touch their rings, they activate “form of a waterfall, shape of a dinosaur! That kind of thing".
