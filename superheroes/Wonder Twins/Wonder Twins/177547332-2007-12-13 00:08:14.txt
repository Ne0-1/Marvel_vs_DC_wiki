'''The Wonder Twins''' are a pair of twins, '''Zan''' and '''Jayna''', teenage alien [[superhero]]es who were [[sidekick]]s to the [[Super Friends]] in the [[Hanna-Barbera]] [[animated television series]] of the same name. In the [[1990s]], these characters were heavily revamped by [[DC Comics]] for modern audiences.

==Character history==
The pair made their debut in ''[[The All-New Super Friends Hour]]''. Zan and Jayna are siblings from the planet Exxor (also spelled Exor) who were being informally trained by the superheroes. Unlike their predecessors, [[Wendy Harris (Super Friends)|Wendy Harris]] and [[Marvin White (Super Friends)|Marvin White]], this pair was able to participate in combat with abilities of their own. Their powers were activated when the twins made physical contact together with the spoken command, "Wonder Twin powers, activate!".  (In the comics, it was revealed that this phrase was unnecessary, just a habit of theirs.) They bear a strong resemblance to [[Donny and Marie]] Osmond, who had a hit TV show at the time of their first appearances. Their appearance is somewhat reminiscent of [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcans]] from ''[[Star Trek]]'', with pointed ears and similar haircuts. As they were about to transform, they would each announce their intended form. For example, Zan would announce, "Form of a [[glacier]]!"

[[Image:Wonder Twins.jpg|thumb|150px|left|The Wonder Twins as they appeared in ''[[The All-New Super Friends Hour]]'', ''[[Challenge of the Super Friends]]'', ''[[The World's Greatest Super Friends]]'', and ''[[Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show]]'']]
Their powers were as followed:
*'''Zan''' can transform into any form of water, including liquid, mist, steam, or, perhaps most usefully, any kind of functioning ice structure. Also, at one time, he changed into a gelatinous form. By combining with already-existing water, Zan could also increase his mass or volume in the water form chosen. In addition, he could transform himself into weather patterns involving water, such as a blizzard, a monsoon, or a typhoon. 

*'''Jayna''' can transform into any animal, whether real, mythological, indigenous to Earth or to some other planet, like [[Beast Boy]]. She did need to know the name of the animal in order to assume its form, as she would turn into whatever animal she named.

In addition, they had a pet Space Monkey called [[Gleek (Super Friends)|Gleek]] who had a useful prehensile tail and whose body could act as a conduit for the twins to activate their powers should they be out of reach. Gleek also served as a courier when the twins needed to travel: Jayna would typically transform into a large [[eagle]], and Zan would transform into (plain) water, "jumping" into a bucket which Gleek conveniently would be holding. (This led to the joke by some fans that Gleek's superpower was to make a bucket appear and disappear at will.  ''See [[hammerspace]].'')

These characters were derided by serious [[comic book]] fans as condescending intrusions in the show.  Others noted that at least the characters were occasionally an asset to the main characters in combat compared to their predecessors. Regardless, the Wonder Twins were usually liked by the younger viewers, who found the twin characters less intimidating and easier to relate to, as the twins were novices who made mistakes, etc., yet the twins had powers which invited the viewers' imaginations.

The characters were introduced in the ''Super Friends'' comic (where they were far more competent, often being the key to solving major situations) and were ignored once the series was cancelled. Jayna's powers in the ''Super Friends'' comic book were shown to be more extensive, allowing her to transform into even mythical creatures. Similarly, Zan was able to transform into anything tangentially related to water or ice, including a [[Frost giant]].

===''Super Friends'' version===
According to the ''Super Friends'' comic book, Zan and Jayna are [[mutant (comics)|mutant]]s, evolutionary throwbacks to an ancient race of Exxorian shapeshifters. Their parents died when they were still babies (during a [[pestilence|plague]]), and, because of their origin, no Exxorians wanted to adopt them. They ended up adopted by the owner of a Space [[Circus]], who only wanted to use them as [[sideshow]] freaks. Fortunately, the circus's clown was a kind man and raised them. He also gave them Gleek as a pet. Eventually, as teens, the pair escaped the circus and hid on a planet where a space villain called Grax (an enemy of [[Superman]]) had set his headquarters. Spying on him, they learned that Grax was planning to destroy the Earth using hidden superbombs. The twins decided to travel to Earth and warn the [[Justice League]]; that was how they came to replace Wendy and Marvin (who were planning on retiring as heroes anyway) as their sidekicks. The heroes also arranged for the kids to live with an old scientist called Professor Carter Nichols, and they even took secret identities as John and Joanna Fleming.  "Johan" and "Johanna" were supposedly transfer students from Esko, [[Sweden]], disguised with blonde hair (Zan wore a wig, while Jayna used her powers to transform into a human to change her hair color and ear shape), to allow them to attend [[Gotham City]] High School.

===''Extreme Justice'' version===

In the [[1990s]] they were introduced into the main [[DC Universe]] in the series ''[[Extreme Justice]]''.  The series [[retcon]]ned their origin so that they are slaves of an alien villain, later rescued by the Justice League. In ''Extreme Justice'' #9 (Oct. 1995), unable to speak [[English language|English]], they accidentally attack some civilians and the Justice League. They join [[Captain Atom]]'s team in issue #16. They had far greater powers than their cartoon counterparts. During their fight with the JLA, Zan became an ice [[golem]], a water monster, and a demonic-looking [[whirlpool]]; while Jayna became a [[griffin]], a [[werewolf]], and a sea serpent. Although rarely seen today, this version of the Wonder Twins is still part of the current [[DC Universe]]. Later they appeared in ''[[Young Justice]]'' #49–51, wearing uniforms which resembled t-shirts and jeans, to help avenge the murder of [[Empress (comics)|Empress]]'s parents. Apparently, the Wonder Twins enjoy the taste of CDs, as they ate several of [[Cassie Sandsmark|Wonder Girl]]'s favorite discs.

[[E! Online]] reported in 2002 that Warner Bros. was considering a live action Wonder Twins movie.
This prompted videogame webcomic [[Penny Arcade]] to parody at their [http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2002/06/12 abilities] <ref>Ryan, Joal [http://www.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=1ccbe9a4-8ab6-415a-a87a-b3ec7f41dd9e "Wonder Twins Movie Activates!"], ''Eonline.com'', 8 June 2002. Retrieved 16 July 2006.</ref>

The Wonder Twins have been parodied on animated comedy shows such as ''[[Family Guy]]'', ''[[Dexter's Lab (TV Show)|Dexter's Laboratory]]'', ''[[That '70s Show]]'', ''[[Celebrity Deathmatch]]'', ''[[Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[Attack of the Show]]'', and [[Robot Chicken]].

In ''[[1999]]'' ''[[South Park]]'' parodied them on their [[Halloween]] special "[[Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery]]". At one point, when it appears that a superheroes help is needed, all members of the band ''[[Korn]]'' touch hands, Shout their names and yell "forms of Corn". They each transform into a different product of Corn, including: ''[[Popcorn]]'' and ''[[Corn On The Cob]]''. When they return to their human form seconds later they are asked how that was useful, to which one of them says "Nothing. It's just fun to do"

In [[2002]], a series of Wonder Twins shorts appeared on [[Cartoon Network]]'s [[Adult Swim]], produced by J.J. Sedelmaier Productions, who also produced the ''Harvey Birdman'' series. The shorts portrayed the Wonder Twins and Gleek as naïve and ineffectual, usually resulting in a dark-humored outcome. For example, in one short, the Wonder Twins attempt to save a camper from a [[bear]]. Jayna transforms into a [[gopher]] and digs a trench, while Zan transforms into water, forming a moat. Their plan fails when the bear simply steps over the moat and mauls the camper. At the camper's funeral, the grieving mother chastises the trio (parodying a similar scene from the film ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]''), saying that even she knows "a one-inch deep gopher moat won't contain a bear."  In another, Zan becomes an ice bridge to save teenagers from falling into a pit, but as it is made of ice and has no rails, the teenagers fall off him. These shorts are parodies of segments during the ''Super Friends'' animated series in which the teens acted completely on their own in dealing with minor problems, usually involving some danger encountered in the life of an average teen, such as speeding. Cartoon Network has also made several commercials parodying the Super Friends. One such commercial made fun of the ineffectiveness of Zan's powers wherein he says "I could get beaten by a [[sponge]]... it wouldn't even have to be an evil sponge!" 

On an episode of ''Justice League,'' statues of them are seen briefly (then smashed) in the background of the episode "Injustice For All".

On the TV series ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', two characters called [[Downpour]] and [[Shifter (Justice League Unlimited)|Shifter]] have appeared. They are members of the [[Ultimen]], a group of superheroes created by the [[United States government|government]]. The group is a [[pastiche]] of the heroes that were created for ''Super Friends'', with Downpour and Shifter specifically a pastiche of the Wonder Twins.

[[Fast Times at Buddy Cianci Jr. High|An episode]] of ''[[Family Guy]]'' involved Jayna and [[Peter Griffin|Peter]], whose employment history apparently includes a stint as a Wonder Twin. In order to get to a fire, Jayna forms into a [[hawk]]. However, Peter forms into Jayna's [[tampon]] and "plays the waiting game" in her purse. In [[A Fish out of Water (Family Guy)|an earlier episode]], Peter and [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] attempt to activate Wonder Twins powers from toy rings they found in a box of [[Frankenberry]] breakfast cereal.

In the animated show ''[[Fairly Odd Parents]]'', the superheroes, Mighty Mom and Dyno Dad have Wonder Twin-like powers. The joke is that while the mom became a strong animal, the Dad turned into a bucket of water, and merely fell on the ground.

In the animated show ''[[Spongebob Squarepants]]'', the wonder twins are parodied often by Mermaidman and Barnacleboy, who in one episode used doughnuts instead of rings and say,"Mermaidman and Barnacleboy...unite!".  In other episodes however, they only parody their phrase when they activate their powers.

In an episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', a ''[[TV Funhouse]]'' cartoon shows [[Osama bin Laden]] and [[Saddam Hussein]] as having powers similar to the Wonder Twins.

The Wonder Twins are parodied in [[Heavy.com]]'s on-going animated series ''Superficial Friends''.  The clips feature celebrities [[Olsen Twins|Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen]] playing shape-shifting twins.  In an unrelated segment of an episode of Adult Swim's ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', entitled "A Day in the Life of the Olsen Twins", the Olsens are also portrayed as having Wonder Twin-like superpowers. In yet another unrelated story, ''[[Celebrity Deathmatch]]'' featured the Olsen Twins using Wonder Twin-like powers when fighting [[Jack Osbourne|Jack]] and [[Kelly Osbourne]].

In ''Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law'', one segment showed Zan as bath water while [[Wonder Woman]] was taking a bath.

An [http://www.mcsweeneys.net/2007/3/15hewlett.html entry] on the online humor site [[McSweeneys|McSweeney's Internet Tendency]] purported to show excerpts from Zan's journal, lamenting his lack of respect from the Super Friends. In one entry, Zan exacts revenge by appearing as a large wet spot on [[The Flash|the Flash's]] tights while he's giving a speech.

''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'' made at least two references: In one episode [[Sarah Chalke]]'s character Elliot is recalling playing with her younger brother as the Twins, as Dr. Cox and Turk listen on.  In another episode when JD is asked to be Carla and Turk's Best Man, Elliot asks JD if this is his best day ever.  Going into flashback mode, JD daydreams of the time he found 2 secret decoder rings from the same box of cereal. Back in real-time JD and Turk touch rings while yelling 'Activate!'. JD then calls out, 'Form of an ice menorah!"  ([[My Porcelain God|My Porcelain God Season 3 Episode 13]])

American Pop Punk band [[Motion City Soundtrack]] make reference to the Wondertwins in a song entitled "It Had to be You", track number three on their 2007 release ''[[Even If It Kills Me]]''. The second half of the first verse talks of a "certain sense of synergy", described as "a kind of macabre and somber Wondertwin type of harmony".

Hip-Hop artist [[Das Efx]] mention The Wonder Twins in their song "[[Mic Checka]]". The lyrics being:"I biggity-burn riggity-rubber when I blabber great, I miggity-make the Wonder Twins deactivate" 

MovieWeb has reported that [[Jake Gyllenhaal]] and [[Maggie Gyllenhaal]] might have cameos of the twins in the live-action Justice League of America film.
