'''The Wonder Twins''', '''Zan''' and '''Jayna''', are a fictional [[extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] twin brother and sister [[superhero]] duo who first appeared in the American [[animated cartoon|animated]] [[Hanna-Barbera]] TV series ''[[Super Friends]]''. They subsequently appeared in comics based on the TV series, and were later introduced into the main [[DC Comics Universe]]. They have since appeared in other media, including animated series such as ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' and the live-action TV series ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'' and ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]''.

==Publication history==
The duo made their debut in ''[[The All-New Super Friends Hour]]'' and went on to appear in ''[[The World's Greatest Super Friends]]'', ''[[Super Friends (1980)|Super Friends]]'', and ''[[Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show]]''. Zan (voiced by [[Michael Bell (actor)|Michael Bell]]) and Jayna (voiced by Louise Williams) are siblings from the planet Exxor (also spelled Exor) who were being informally trained by the superheroes. Unlike their predecessors, [[Wendy and Marvin|Wendy Harris and Marvin White]], this pair was able to participate in combat with abilities of their own.

Hanna Barbera animator Darrell McNeil recalls the twins were created by [[Norman Maurer]], the ''Super Friends'' series developer/story editor. They were originally called Dick, Jane, and their sidekick was Mighty Monkey, before finally becoming Zan, Jayna, and Gleek. The names "Zan" and "Jayna" derived from the [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] characters, [[Tarzan]] and his romantic interest [[Jane Porter (Tarzan)|Jane]]. According to McNeil, "Originally Zan (Dick) had '[[Plastic Man]]' powers and Jayna (Jane) could transform into anything, not just animals, but they were scaled back to their present powers as it made the other Super Friends (even [[Superman]]) seem almost superfluous."<ref name="blogspot1">{{cite web|author=Marc Tyler Nobleman |url=http://noblemania.blogspot.com/2011/07/super-70s-and-80s-super-friendsdarrell.html |title=Noblemania: Super ‘70s and ‘80s: “Super Friends”—Darrell McNeil, animator |publisher=Noblemania.blogspot.com |date=2011-07-29 |accessdate=2013-09-10}}</ref>

However, by the final seasons, the Twins were largely marginalized in favor of well established DC Comics teenage superheroes like [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]], until they were wholly eliminated in the final season in favor of [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]].

The characters were later introduced to comics, in ''[[Super Friends]]'' #7 (October 1977), by [[E. Nelson Bridwell]] and [[Ramona Fradon]].

In the 1990s, they were introduced into the main [[DC Universe]] in ''[[Extreme Justice]]'' #9 (October 1995), by [[Ivan Velez, Jr.]] and [[Al Rio]] The series rewrote and updated their [[origin story]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Super Friends===
{{Main|Super Friends}}
Little background is provided for the Wonder Twins in the ''Super Friends'' cartoon, save that they are superheroes-in-training that are friends of the Super Friends.

According to the ''Super Friends'' comic book by [[E. Nelson Bridwell]] (writer) and [[Ramona Fradon]] (artist), Zan and Jayna are Exorian [[metahumans|metas]], genetic throwbacks to an ancient race of Exorian shapeshifters.<ref>''Super Friends'' #7 (October 1977)</ref> Their parents died when they were still babies during a [[plague (disease)|plague]], and, because of their origin, no Exorians want to adopt them. They are adopted by the owner of a Space [[Circus]] who only wanted to use them as [[sideshow]] freaks. Fortunately, the circus' clown (or "laugh-maker") was a kind man and raised them. He also gives them Gleek as a pet. Eventually, as teens, the pair escape the circus and hide on a planet where a space villain called Grax (an enemy of [[Superman]]) had established his headquarters. Spying on him, they learn that Grax was planning to destroy the Earth using hidden superbombs. The twins decide to travel to Earth and warn the [[Justice League]], which is how they come to replace Wendy and Marvin (who were planning on retiring as heroes anyway) as their sidekicks. The heroes arrange for the kids to live with an old scientist named [[Professor Carter Nichols]] and they even take secret identities as Johan and Joanna Fleming. "Johan" and "Johanna" were supposedly transfer students from Esko, [[Sweden]], disguised with blonde hair (Zan wore a wig, while Jayna uses her powers to transform into a human to change her hair color and ear shape), to allow them to attend [[Gotham City]] High School.

==Powers and abilities==
The Wonder Twins powers are activated when they touch each other and speak the phrase, "Wonder Twin powers activate!" This phrase is unnecessary and just a habit of theirs.  Physical contact, however, is required. If the two are out of reach of each other, they are unable to activate their powers. As they are about to transform, they would each announce their intended form. "Shape of...", "Form of..."

Zan can transform into water at any state (solid, liquid, gas) and add to his mass by incorporating water in his immediate area. In the case of becoming solid ice, he can also become any form he chooses, from a 5,000 foot humanoid ice giant to a cage for a criminal to complex machinery (such as a jet engine, as he did in the episode "Eruption"). He changes into a gelatinous form at one point. On another occasion, he transformed into [[liquid nitrogen]]. In addition, he can transform himself into atmospheric disturbances (usually very localized) involving water, such as a [[blizzard]], a [[monsoon]], [[waterspout]] or a [[typhoon]]. 

Jayna can transform into any animal, whether real, mythological, indigenous to Earth or to some other planet, like [[Beast Boy]]. Since she must vocalize her choice of form to assume, she must know the common name. Naming the wrong animal will cause her to assume the wrong animal's form. She has been known to take the form of anything from an ant to a whale.

In the ''Super Friends'' comic book, their powers were shown to be more extensive. By transforming into an animal of [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonian]] origin, for instance, Jayna could gain both the creature's natural abilities and the [[Powers and abilities of Superman|super-powers]] that all Kryptonians possess under Earth-like conditions; she was even capable of overpowering [[Superman]] in the form of a Kryptonian animal.<ref>''Super Friends'' #42 (March 1981)--Jayna defeats Superman in a training exercise by becoming a Kryptonian ''Tanthou Flez'' ("Winged One")</ref>  Similarly, Zan was able to transform into anything tangentially related to water or ice, including a [[Jötunn|frost giant]].

In addition to their powers of transformation, the two share a telepathic link, enabling one to alert the other over a distance when in dire circumstances. 

A rarely-seen aspect of their powers is the ability to break mind control. On at least two occasions ("Pied Piper From Space" and "Circus of Horrors"), while the twins were under the influence of mind control [[Gleek (Super Friends)|Gleek]] caused them to make contact, the activation of their powers freeing them instantly. 

The Wonder Twins have a pet Space Monkey called Gleek who had a useful prehensile tail and who could act as a conduit for the twins to activate their powers should they be out of reach. Gleek also served as a courier when the twins needed to travel: Jayna would typically transform into a large [[eagle]], and Zan would transform into [[water]], "jumping" into a bucket which Gleek would be holding while riding atop Jayna in her eagle form. (This led to the joke by some fans{{cn|date=September 2011}} that Gleek's superpower was to make a bucket appear and disappear at will. ''See [[hammerspace]].'')

==In other media==
===''Justice League/Justice League Unlimited''===
{{Main|Justice League Unlimited}}
* In the ''Justice League'' episode "Injustice For All", statues of the Twins are briefly seen in a museum devoted to super-powered heroes.  Later in the same scene, the two statues are destroyed during the battle between the heroes and villains.

* In ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', two characters called '''Downpour''' and '''Shifter''' appear in the episode "Ultimatum" where they were both voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]. They are members of the Ultimen, a group of superheroes created by the [[United States government|government]] and [[Project Cadmus]] with [[Maxwell Lord]] as their sponsor. The group is a [[pastiche]] of the heroes that were created for ''Super Friends'', with Downpour and Shifter specifically a pastiche of the Wonder Twins. Downpour and his twin sister Shifter have [[albino]] white skin, pink eyes and pointy ears. Downpour would say the name of a liquid in order to turn into that liquid (like water and tidal wave) while Shifter would say the name of a creature (like a [[sea serpent]], a [[lion]], a [[rhinoceros]], a [[African buffalo|cape buffalo]], and a [[Tyrannosaurus]]) in order to become that creature. Later on in the episode, Downpour and Shifter were with the Ultimen when they learned on their own that the Ultimen were clones created by Project Cadmus. After Wind Dragon had used his wind attacks to bring Maxwell Lord to the roof that they were on, Downpour became water that entrapped Maxwell Lord while Shifter became a lion asking which is worse: drowning in water or being eaten by a lion. Maxwell Lord convinced them to let him explain over the fact that Project Cadmus had created them in order to be better heroes with the clones having implanted images and interact with actors that portrayed their parents. When it came to attacking the building they lived in while hunting for Maxwell Lord's boss Amanda Waller, Downpour and Shifter fought Aquaman and were defeated. Clones of the characters later appear in the episode "Panic in the Sky" where they join the other Ultimatum clones into attacking the Watchtower. Some clones of Shifter formed a water trap around [[Fire (comics)|Fire]] until she managed to heat herself to the point of breaking free.

===''Adult Swim''===
{{Main|Adult Swim}}
* In 2001, Zan appeared in season 1, episode 2 of the Adult Swim series ''[[Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law]]''. In the episode, Zan (voiced by [[Michael Bell (actor)|Michael Bell]]) is on the stand being questioned by Harvey Birdman. The following exchange ensues:
::''Harvey Birdman:'' You stated that you had express knowledge of one of the more familiar Super Friends' whereabouts—a Wonder Woman, I believe? 
::''Zan:'' Um, that's correct. Uh, she was at home. 
::''Harvey Birdman:'' Any idea why she wouldn't have answered the town's distress call? 
::''Zan:'' Well, she said she really needed some "me time." So she unplugged her communicator and... and took a bath. 
::''Harvey Birdman:'' How do you happen to know this? 
::''Zan:'' I was... I, I was the bathwater. 
:: ''[Flashback to Wonder Woman taking a bath with Zan as the water]''

* In 2007, the Adult Swim website ran a series of five [[webisode]]s entitled "The New Adventures of the Wonder Twins." These shorts were not canon, but rather a [[Black comedy|dark-humor]] [[parody]]. Zan and Jayna were portrayed as well-meaning but inept, with their attempts at heroism always ending in tragic failure.

===''Smallville''===
{{Main|Smallville (TV series)}}
[[Image:SmallvilleWonderTwins.jpg|200px|thumb|[[David Gallagher]] as Zan and [[Allison Scagliotti]] as Jayna in the episode "Idol".]]
Zan and Jayna appeared in the ''Smallville'' season nine episode, "Idol", which aired on November 13, 2009. Zan was played by [[David Gallagher]] and Jayna by [[Allison Scagliotti]]. They both carry cell phones that have an image of Gleek on the back and that make the sound of Gleek laughing as a [[ringtone]]. Though not explicitly labeled as aliens, the two are implied to be from another world{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} and claim to be of [[Swedish people|Swedish]] descent in order to explain their odd-sounding names. The Twins are portrayed as being obsessed with "The Blur" (the name given to Clark Kent before he officially adopts the [[Superman]] identity), and attempt to impersonate him in order to build up his positive reputation. They send a crate to young reporter [[Lois Lane]] containing several bound and gagged drug dealers who turn out to be undercover cops that Zan and Jayna abducted by mistake, thus ruining a calculated police drug sting. When an attempt at stopping a robbery accidentally causes a citywide blackout in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], the Twins are ambushed and abducted by Clark and his partner [[Chloe Sullivan]]. After being threatened into giving up their vigilante activities, Zan and Jayna prove their worth when Lois is thrown from the rooftop of the [[Daily Planet]] building by a crooked politician who wants to expose "The Blur's" true identity. Jayna transforms into an attack dog and captures the politician as he attempts to flee the scene, while Zan transforms his body into a massive cloud of mist, providing the cover Clark needs to lower Lois safely to the ground unobserved. After this, the Twins are encouraged by Clark to continue their super heroics outside of Metropolis, albeit on their own reputations rather than attempting to emulate him.

===''Arrow''===
{{Main|Arrow (TV series)}}
In the ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' episode "Home Invasion", Detective Quentin Lance calls Thea Queen and [[Roy Harper (comics)|Roy Harper]] the Wonder Twins.

===''Teen Titans Go''===
The Wonder Twins appear in the ''[[Teen Titans Go! (TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'' episode "You're Fired"<ref>{{cite web|last=Lynch |first=Alex |url=http://www.comicbookmovie.com/fansites/TheAlexLynch/news/?a=82010 |title=TEEN TITANS GO!

They appear amongst the heroes at the audition for the replacement of [[Beast Boy]]. Although Robin was impressed with Jayna, Zan was hired as a [[receptionist]] with Jayna stating that she needs Zan to activate her powers. Beast Boy works with Zan to sabotage Jayna's attempts. After Zan comes clean, he turns into water and escapes into the toilet. In the form of a pelican, Beast Boy catches Zan before he can land in the ocean. Zan and Jayna later leave with Zan in the form of an ice unicycle and Jayna in the form of an octopus.
