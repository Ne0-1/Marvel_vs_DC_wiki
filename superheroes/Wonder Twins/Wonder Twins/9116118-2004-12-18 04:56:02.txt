'''The Wonder Twins''' are a pair of teenage alien [[superheroes]] who were [[sidekick]]s to the [[Super Friends]] in the [[Hanna-Barbera]] [[animated television series]] of the same name.

The pair, Zan and Jayna, are siblings from the planet Exor who were being informally trained by the superheroes. Unlike their predecessors, Wendy and Marvin, these pair were able to participate in combat with abilities of their own.

Their powers were activated when the twins made physical contact together with the spoken command, "Wonder Twin powers, Activate!".  (Note: in the comics, it was revealed that this phrase was unnecessary, just a habit of theirs.) Their powers were:

*Zan: Could transform into any form of water, including liquid, mist, or, perhaps most usefully, any kind of functioning ice structure.
*Jayna: Could transform into any animal.

In addition, they had a pet Space Monkey called [[Gleek (Superfriends)|Gleek]] who had a useful prehensible tail and his body could act as a conduit for the twins.

These characters were derided by [[comic book]] fans as condescending intrusions in the show.  Others noted that at least the characters were occasionally an asset to the main characters in combat compared to their predecessors.

The characters were introduced in the ''Super Friends'' comic and were ignored when the series was cancelled.  However, in the [[1990s]] they were introduced into the main [[DC Universe]] in the series, ''Extreme Justice''.

According to the Super Friends comic, Zan and Jayna are [[mutants]], evolutionary throwbacks to an ancient race of Exorian shapeshifters. Their parents died when they were still babies (during a plague) and, because of their origin, no Exorians wanted to adopt them. They ended up adopted by the owner of a Space Circus, who only wanted to use them as sideshow freaks. Fortunately, the circus's clown was a kind man and raised them. He also gave them Gleek as a pet. Eventually, as teens, the pair escaped the circus, and hid on a planet where a space villain called Grax (an enemy of [[Superman]]) had set his headquarters. Spying on him, they learned that Grax was planning to destroy the Earth using hidden superbombs. The twins decided to travel to Earth and warn the Justice League; that was how they came to replace Wendy and Marvin (who were planning on retiring as heroes) as their sidekicks. The heroes also arranged for the kids to live with an old scientist called Professor Potter, and they even took secret identities, as "Johan and Johanna" suposed transfer students from Esko (in Finland), disguised with blonde hair, to allow them to attend High School.

The Extreme Justice version of the Twins introduced them as slaves of an alien villain who were rescued by the Justice League. Although rarely seen today, this version of the Wonder Twins is still part of the current DC Universe.

Recently on the TV show Justice League Unlimited two purposely similar characters called Downpour and Shifter were featured as members of the Ulitimen a group of Super Heroes created by the government.
