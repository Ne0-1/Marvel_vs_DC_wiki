'''The Scarecrow''' ('''Ebenezer Laughton''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe, in which he is an enemy of [[Spider-Man]] and [[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]]. His first appearance was in ''Tales of Suspense #51''.

==Fictional character biography==
'''Ebenezer Laughton''' was born in [[Rhinebeck, New York]].  He became a circus escape artist and [[contortionist]] and later helped [[Iron Man]] apprehend a fleeing culprit. However, he decided to make his profit in crime and became an accomplished burglar. He mostly worked alone - except for a flock of trained crows which served as carriers and killers - although he once joined [[Count Nefaria]]'s short-lived team of super-mercenaries (which included the [[Eel (comics)|Eel]], the [[Porcupine (comics)|Porcupine]], the [[Plantman]] and the [[Unicorn (comics)|Unicorn]]). Eventually, however, from breaking out of prison so many times his mind snapped, and Laughton became insane, willing to kill people wantonly.

Laughton wears a scarecrow costume and is extremely flexible and agile due to heavy training. He became an [[undead]] character, raised by the sorcerer [[Stern (comics)|Stern]] after falling into his own pitchfork after a battle with the second [[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]]. Before this he possessed no superhuman powers save for his "rubber man" ability, but after his resurrection he gained superhuman strength, speed and endurance as well as the supernatural ability to induce fear in his enemies.

Laughton's physiology and mentality would fluctuate quite a bit over the years, given his employ/manipulation by various demonic/magical entities, resulting in continuing conflict with Ghost Rider and his allies, even becoming a body-hopping ghost during one such campaign. Eventually, Laughton would be abandoned by various "magical employers", and stabilize physically, if not mentally.

Scarecrow was jailed in [[The Raft (comics)|the Raft]] prison facility following a failed sexual assault upon hostages who were freed by [[Falcon (comics)|the Falcon]].  Following that facility's destruction, he found himself in conflict with Spider-Man and [[Thunderbolts (comics)|the Thunderbolts]].

===Civil War/The Initiative===
Scarecrow is among the army of villains recruited by [[Baron Zemo|Zemo]] and his Thunderbolts to serve as "hero-hunters" during the events of the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]''.

Scarecrow recently showed up when [[Spider-Man: Unmasked|Peter Parker unmasked]] himself, as one of a band of costumed villains, (including [[Electro (comics)|Electro]], the [[Molten Man]], and [[Will o' the Wisp (comics)|Will o' the Wisp]]), hired by [[Chameleon (comics)|the Chameleon]] to attack Peter Parker in a lopsided revenge effort. Scarecrow was defeated and incarcerated. He later teamed again with Molten Man in a rampage which was halted by Captain America and the [[Punisher]]. The two criminals were sent as part of the "Thunderbolt Army" to flush heroes out of hiding. Cap was forced to prevent Punisher from killing Scarecrow once he'd been apprehended.

Ebeneezer has been identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes who registered as part of the Initiative<ref>''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #1</ref>. <ref>[http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 Avengers: The Initiative #1 Character Map]</ref>

===The Hood===
Someone that looks like Scarecrow was among the members of [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s Crime Syndicate <ref>New Avengers #35 (2007)</ref>.

==Other versions==
===Marvel vs. DC===
In ''[[Marvel vs. DC]]'', Scarecrow briefly teamed up with DC's [[Scarecrow (comics)|Scarecrow]] in an attempt to kidnap [[Lois Lane]]. They were thwarted by [[Ben Reilly]].  In the [[Amalgam Comics|Amalgam Universe]], [[Scarecrow (Amalgam Comics)|Scarecrow]] was a combination of Marvel's Scarecrow and DC's Scarecrow.

==In other media==
===Video games===
An action figure for the [[Ghost Rider (film)|''Ghost Rider'' movie]] line by Hasbro is based on the fact that Scarecrow appears in [[Ghost Rider (video game)|the video game of the movie]]. In the game, Ghost Rider enters a church and fights Scarecrow's birds and then fights Scarecrow himself. Scarecrow attacks Ghost Rider but retreats to a pillar. After Ghost Rider knocks the pillar over, Scarecrow falls from a great height and is defeated.
