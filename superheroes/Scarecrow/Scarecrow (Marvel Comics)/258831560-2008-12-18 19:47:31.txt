The '''Scarecrow''' ('''Ebenezer Laughton''') is a [[fictional character]], a [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] Universe, in which he is an enemy of [[Spider-Man]], [[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]], and [[Iron Man]]. His first appearance was in ''Tales of Suspense #51''.

==Fictional character biography==
'''Ebenezer Laughton''' was born in [[Rhinebeck, New York]].  Raised by an abusive mother who was alternately viciously cruel and extremely kind to him, Laughton became a circus escape artist and [[contortionist]], helping [[Iron Man]] apprehend a fleeing culprit. However, he decided to make his profit in crime and became an accomplished burglar. He mostly worked alone - except for a flock of trained crows which served as carriers and killers - although he once joined [[Count Nefaria]]'s short-lived team of super-mercenaries (which included the [[Eel (comics)|Eel]], the [[Porcupine (comics)|Porcupine]], the [[Plantman]] and the [[Unicorn (comics)|Unicorn]]). Eventually, however, from breaking out of prison so many times his mind snapped, and Laughton became insane, willing to kill people wantonly.

It was revealed in Iron Man: Enter the Mandarin that Laughton was motivated in part to become a supervillain by agents of the Mandarin who supplied him with his first costume and trained crows. He was allured by the idea of becoming the number one in the growing field of industrial espionage.

Laughton wears a scarecrow costume and is extremely flexible and agile due to heavy training. He became an [[undead]] character, raised by the sorcerer [[Stern (comics)|Stern]] after falling into his own pitchfork after a battle with the second [[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Ghost Rider]]. Before this he possessed no superhuman powers save for his "rubber man" ability, but after his resurrection he gained superhuman strength, speed and endurance as well as the supernatural ability to induce fear in his enemies. He also gained the ability to heal any injury so long as he was in the presence of the fear of others. This worked in conjunction with his ability to induce fear, as any injury he sustained would heal almost immediately from inducing fear in those around him. The Ghost Rider used this ability against the Scarecrow, briefly mangling his body, and using Scarecrow's healing and fear inducing abilities to cause the Scarecrow's body to heal in a crooked and contorted pose. He was later restored to his normal physical appearance by the government agent called Spook during the ''Ghost Rider in Chains'' story arc.

Laughton's physiology and mentality would fluctuate quite a bit over the years, given his employ/manipulation by various demonic/magical entities, resulting in continuing conflict with Ghost Rider and his allies, even becoming a body-hopping ghost during one such campaign. Eventually, Laughton would be abandoned by various "magical employers", and stabilize physically, if not mentally.

Scarecrow was jailed in [[The Raft (comics)|the Raft]] prison facility following a failed sexual assault upon hostages who were freed by the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]].  Following that facility's destruction, he found himself in conflict with Spider-Man and the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].

===Civil War/The Initiative===
Scarecrow is among the army of villains recruited by [[Baron Zemo|Zemo]] and his Thunderbolts to serve as "hero-hunters" during the events of the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]''.

Scarecrow recently showed up when Peter Parker unmasked himself, as one of a band of costumed villains (including [[Electro (comics)|Electro]], the [[Molten Man]], and [[Will o' the Wisp (comics)|Will o' the Wisp]]), hired by [[Chameleon (comics)|the Chameleon]] to attack Peter Parker in a lopsided revenge effort. Scarecrow was defeated and incarcerated. He later teamed again with [[Molten Man]] in a rampage which was halted by Captain America and the [[Punisher]]. The two criminals were sent as part of the "Thunderbolt Army" to flush heroes out of hiding. Cap was forced to prevent Punisher from killing Scarecrow once he'd been apprehended.

Ebenezer has been identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes who registered as part of the Initiative<ref>''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #1</ref>. <ref>[http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 Avengers: The Initiative #1 Character Map]</ref>

===The Hood===
Someone that looks like Scarecrow was among the members of [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s Crime Syndicate <ref>New Avengers #35 (2007)</ref>. He helped them assault the New Avengers' home until they were defeated. In [[Secret Invasion]], he is among the many supervillains who rejoined the Hood's crime syndicate and attacked an invading [[Skrull]] force.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #6</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Scarecrow is double-jointed and can fit his body through any aperture at least one foot wide. Scarecrow is also a trained acrobat, escapologist and tumbler. He has a flock of two dozen pet crows, which have been taught by him to kill on command. When the Scarecrow was raised from the dead by the sorcerer Stern he was able to induce fear in his victims, and could heal any injury he sustained when in the presence in the fear of others. This was revealed in ''Ghost Rider Annual'' #2, and was his first appearance since his apparent death in a previous battle with the Ghost Rider.

==Other versions==
===Marvel vs. DC===
In ''[[Marvel vs. DC]]'', Scarecrow briefly teamed up with DC's [[Scarecrow (comics)|Scarecrow]] in an attempt to kidnap [[Lois Lane]]. They were thwarted by [[Ben Reilly]].  In the [[Amalgam Comics|Amalgam Universe]], [[Scarecrow (Amalgam Comics)|Scarecrow]] was a combination of Marvel's Scarecrow and DC's Scarecrow.
