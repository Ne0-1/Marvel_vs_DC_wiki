'''The Scarecrow''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] supervillain. 

== Character History ==

'''Ebenezer Laughton''' was a circus escape artist and [[contortionist]] who helped [[Iron Man]] apprehend a fleeing culprit. However, he decided to make his profit in crime and became an accomplished burglar. He mostly worked alone - except for a flock of trained crows which served as carriers and killers - although he once joined [[Count Nefaria]]'s short-lived team of super-mercenaries (which included the [[Eel (comics)|Eel]], the [[Porcupine (comics)|Porcupine]], the [[Plantman]] and the [[Unicorn (comics)|Unicorn]]). Eventually, however, from breaking out of prison so many times his mind snapped, and Laughton became insane, willing to kill people wantonly.

Laughton wears a scarecrow costume and is extremely flexible and agile due to heavy training. He became an [[undead]] character, raised by the sorcerer [[Stern (comics)|Stern]] after falling into his own pitchfork after a battle with the second [[Ghost Rider]]. Before this he possessed no superhuman powers save for his "rubber man" ability, but after his resurrection he gained superhuman strength, speed and endurance as well as the supernatural ability to induce fear in his enemies.

In ''[[Marvel vs. DC]]'' he teamed up with DC's [[Scarecrow (comics)|Scarecrow]] in an attempt to kidnap [[Lois Lane]], but [[Spider-Man]] saved her by knocking them both out with a single kick.

Laughton's physiology and mentality would fluctuate quite a bit over the years, given his employ/manipulation by various demonic/magical entites, resulting in continuing conflict with Ghost Rider and his allies, even becoming a body-hopping ghost during one such campaign. Eventually, Laughton would be abandoned by various "magical employers", and stabilize physically, if not mentally.

Scarecrow was jailed in [[The Raft (comics)|the Raft]] prison facility following a failed sexual assault upon hostages who were freed by [[Falcon (comics)|the Falcon]].  Following that facility's destruction, he found himself in conflict with Spider-Man and [[Thunderbolts (comics)|the Thunderbolts]].

Scarecrow is among the army of villains recruited by [[Baron Zemo|Zemo]] and his Thunderbolts to serve as "hero-hunters" during the events of the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' crossover.

Scarecrow recently showed up during ''Spider-Man: Unmasked'' as one of a band of costumed villains, (including [[Electro (comics)|Electro]], the [[Molten Man]], and [[Will o' the Wisp (comics)|Will o' the Wisp]]), hired by [[Chameleon (comics)|the Chameleon]] to attack Peter Parker in a lopsided revenge effort.  Scarecrow was defeated and incarcerated.
