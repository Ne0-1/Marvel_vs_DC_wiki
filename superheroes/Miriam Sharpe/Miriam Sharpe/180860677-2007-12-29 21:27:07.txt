'''Miriam Sharpe''' is a [[fictional character]], in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].  She first made her appearance during the 2006 crossover event [[Civil War (comics) |Civil War]]. 

== Publication history ==
Marvel [[editor-in-chief]] [[Joe Quesada]] has stated that, at one point during the planning of ''Civil War'', Miriam Sharpe was intended "to shoot Cap right after he puts his hands up to be handcuffed"<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/NewJoeFridays/NewJoeFridays_38.html www.newsarama.com - New Joe Fridays Week 38]</ref>. Mark Millar has confirmed that Sharpe's concept came, in part from [[Cindy Sheehan]] although other statements have tied her concept in with [[Jersey Girls|widows of firefighters who died on September 11th]] who pushed for the creation of the [[9/11 Commission]] and to Sharpe simply being a representative for public opinion in the Marvel Universe<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/marvelnew/CivilWar/millar_final.html]</ref>.

== Fictional character biography ==
=== Life Before Civil War ===

Little is known of Miriam Sharpe pre-Civil War. Neither her career nor her home life comes up as major subjects.  All that is known is that she was indeed married, was a resident of [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Connecticut]] and had a young son named Damian who would attend Stamford Elementary.

=== Champion of the Superhuman Registration Act ===

Her son was at school the day that the [[New Warriors]] attacked the [[supervillain]] known as [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]].  During that battle, Nitro used his powers to destroy much of Stamford, including the Elementary School.

After her son's death, Mrs. Sharpe became the most powerful voice in the emerging [[Registration Acts (comics)|Pro-Registration Movement]].  At a memorial service for the victims of the Stamford attack, Mrs. Sharpe had a highly publicized confrontation with Tony Stark where she blamed him for funding [[Avengers (comics)|the Avengers]] so that he could "Play Hero".  It was this confrontation that convinced Stark to also champion the Registration Act as [[Iron Man]]. However, Stark had in fact already been covertly supporting Registration Act even before the Stamford disaster.

Mrs. Sharpe is widely noted by [[Pundit (politics)|pundits]] as a brilliant political operator. In the weeks following the Stamford disaster she managed to create a support base that would gather hundreds to march on [[the White House]], influence super-humans and eventually convince [[United States Congress|congress]] and [[The President of the United States|the president]] to pass the superhuman registration act.

During Civil War #2, Mrs. Sharpe appeared on stage at the press conference where [[Spider-Man]] unmasked as one of his first public supporters.

Mrs. Sharpe again appeared in ''Civil War'' #4 to attend Bill "[[Black Goliath]]" Foster's funeral. She would again speak with Iron Man, this time to bolster his commitment to the SHRA. 

Wolverine would also seek her out to tell her the story of how he brought justice to Nitro and to Walter Declum, CEO of [[Damage Control (comics)|Damage Control Inc.]] who gave Nitro [[Mutant Growth Hormone]] pills to boost his power, thus destroying Stamford and giving Declum many profitable contracts for rebuilding.

In ''Civil War'' #6, where Tony Stark showed her a series of gardens that were created as a memorial to the children lost in the Stamford incident. It is here Mrs. Sharpe thanks both Stark and [[Mr. Fantastic|Reed Richards]] for backing her "Big Idea" for registration despite how it's torn their lives apart. Stark assures her that there is “no shame in making enemies if it means making people safer.”

Her latest appearance was in the final issue of Civil War, where she joins Tony Stark following the climatic battle to discuss the future in the wake of the Pro-Registration victory. As they discuss future plans, including Stark's recent promotion to Director of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], Sharpe tells Stark that she has finally started to believe in superheroes again, thanks to him.

====Post-Civil War====

The relationship between Sharpe and Stark seems to have soured somewhat over his public relationship with [[Maya Hansen]], the creator of the Extremis virus, who Sharpe considers a "Mass Murderer". Sharpe went so far as to go on the television program "Viewpoint" (an homage to [[The View]]) to publicly attack the government for supporting her.

This unpleasantness has apparently cleared up, as Sharpe was on hand to support the appointment of [[Ultra Girl]] as director of the Junior Guardsmen, a youth branch of the Initiative, akin to the [[JROTC]] program.
