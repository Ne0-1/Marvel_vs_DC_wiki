'''Miriam Sharpe''' is a [[fictional character]], in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. She first made her appearance during the 2006 crossover event [[Civil War (comics) |Civil War]]. 

==Life Before Civil War==

Little is known of Miriam Sharpe pre-Civil War. Neither her career nor her home life comes up as major subjects during her brief appearances in Civil War 1, 2 and 4. All that is known is that she was indeed married, was a resident of [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Connecticut]] and had a young son named Damian who would attend Stamford Elementary.

==Champion of the Superhuman Registration Act==

Her son was at school the day that the [[New Warriors]] attacked the supervillain [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]]. During that battle, Nitro used his powers to destroy much of stamford, including the Elemetary School.

After her son's death, Mrs. Sharpe became the most powerful voice in the emerging [[Registration Acts (comics)|Pro-Registration Movement]]. At a memorial service for the victims of the Stamford Attack, Mrs. Sharpe had a highly publicized confrontation with Tony Stark where she blamed him for funding the Avengers so that he could "Play Hero". It was this confrontation that convinced Stark to also champion the Registration act as [[Iron Man]].  

Mrs. Sharpe is widely noted by [[Pundit (politics)|pundits]] as a brilliant political operator. In the weeks following the Stamford disaster she managed to create a support base that would gather hundreds to march on [[the White House]], influence super-humans and eventually convince [[United States Congress|congress]] and [[The President of the United States|the president]] to pass the superhuman registration act.

Mrs. Sharpe appeared on stage at the press conference where [[Spider-Man]] unmasked as one of his first public supporters.

{{spoiler}} 

Mrs. Sharpe again apeared in Civil War #4 to attend Bill "[[Black Goliath]]" Foster's funeral. She would again speak with Iron Man, this time to bolster his commitment to the SHRA. Wolverine would also seek her out to tell her the story of how he brought justice to Nitro and to Walter Declum, CEO of [[Damage Control (comics)|Damage Control Inc.]] who gave Nitro [[Mutant Growth Hormone]] pills to boost his power, thus destroying Stamford and giving Declum many profitable contracts for rebuilding.
