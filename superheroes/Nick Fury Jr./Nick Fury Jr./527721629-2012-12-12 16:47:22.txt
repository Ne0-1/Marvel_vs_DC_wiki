==Publication history==
Marcus Johnson was introduced in the mini-series ''Battle Scars''. He bears a strong resemblance to the [[Ultimate Marvel]] [[Ultimate Nick Fury|version of Nick Fury]] and the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] incarnation of Fury as portrayed by [[Samuel L. Jackson]], whose likeness inspired the Ultimate Marvel version of Nick Fury.<ref name="BadHaven">{{cite web|url= http://www.badhaven.com/comics/comic-features/out-with-the-old-and-in-with-the-new-black-nick-fury-jnr-comes-to-616-but-is-there-still-a-place-for-his-pops/|title=Out With The Old And In With The New: Black Nick Fury Jnr.

==Fictional character biography==
While serving in the Middle East Johnson received word that his mother, Nia Jones, had been murdered back in the US. He returned home and investigated the crime scene, finding shell casings used by [[Russians]]. While leaving his mother's home he was attacked by the Russian hitmen who killed his mom. Marcus defeated them and began to question one before being shot with a bow and arrow. He turned around to see [[Taskmaster]] standing before him. Taskmaster was about to kill him, but [[Captain America]] arrived in time to save Johnson at the last moment. [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents arrived to try to bring Marcus to safety. Marcus went off with Quake to a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility where he was visited by Captain America in the infirmary. Johnson continued to question why everyone was after him and why his mother was killed yet was not given any answers. Soon Marcus began to feel as if he was being held there against his will and broke out.<ref>''Battle Scars'' #2</ref> 

Marcus contacted an old Ranger friend for help and informed him of his current situation. They planned to find Taskmaster and attempt to get some information. While searching for Taskmaster, Marcus was attacked by [[Deadpool]] who was also after Marcus. As they fought, Taskmaster arrived and ran Deadpool through with his sword. Marcus took on Taskmaster and this time gained the upper hand. At that time the [[Serpent Squad]] arrived, also looking for Marcus. Johnson took them on, lasting only about fifteen seconds before being electrocuted by Rattler. Deadpool returned, and due to the confusion Marcus was able to escape with Taskmaster as his prisoner. He interrogated Taskmaster, but before he was able to get an answer, a masked man stunned Taskmaster, then drained Marcus' energy for a moment and escaped. Marcus caught up with the man and unmasked him, who revealed himself to be Marcus's father, [[Nick Fury]].<ref>''Battle Scars'' #4</ref>

While arguing and eventually coming to blows about the realization Fury and Johnson were ambushed by more mercenaries and easily captured. In the custody of Orion, Johnson had his left eye cut out, and tests were run by Orion's men, confirming that Johnson had the [[List of comic book drugs#Infinity Formula|Infinity Formula]] in his DNA. Fury slipped his restraints and gave Johnson enough time to escape (even if accidentally), but Fury was brought in to give Orion a blood transfusion to restore him to a youthful state. The transfusion drained Fury of the remaining Infinity Formula in his system. Fury was then tortured and had his mind probed by Orion's telepath, wherein they found all of Fury's S.H.I.E.L.D. secrets and fail-safes.<ref>''Battle Scars'' #5</ref>

Marcus saved Fury and with the help of his friend Cheese ([[Phil Coulson]]), Marcus was able to get Orion alone and kill him. He was taken to get his wounds cared for, and was also given the Super Soldier uniform that Steve Rogers once wore. As a new agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., Johnson was also informed by [[Daisy Johnson]] that his birth name is Nicholas Fury, Jr.<ref>''Battle Scars'' #6</ref>

Marcus and Coulson make a [[cameo appearance]] in ''[[Kaine#Scarlet Spider|Scarlet Spider]]'' #5,<ref>[[Scarlet Spider (comics)#Volume 2|''Scarlet Spider'' vol. 2]] #5</ref> and are part of the [[framing sequence]] in ''[[Marvel NOW!]] Point One''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=user_review&id=5287|title=Review: Marvel NOW! Point One|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=17 October 2012}}</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Initially, Marcus appeared to have no superhuman qualities but his peak physical conditioning from his time with the US Army Rangers. Marcus inherited his father's Infinity Formula at birth, slowing his age and speeding his healing time.

==Reception==
The reaction by comic book fans to the revelation of Johnson being Fury's son and his replacing his father has been mixed.<ref name="BadHaven"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://crimsonmonkey.com/blogs/daveomac/nick-fury-jr-the-disney-mandated-director-of-shield/|title=Nick Fury Jr: The Disney Mandated Director of SHIELD|date=2012-04-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://insidepulse.com/2012/04/25/samuel-l-jackson-enters-the-marvel-universe-check-out-marcus-johnsons-new-look/ |title=Samuel L.
