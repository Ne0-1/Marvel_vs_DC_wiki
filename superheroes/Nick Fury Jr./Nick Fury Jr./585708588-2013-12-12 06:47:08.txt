==Fictional character biography==
While serving in the Middle East, Marcus Johnson received word that his mother Nia Jones had been murdered back in the United States. He returned home and investigated the crime scene, finding shell casings used by [[Russians]]. While leaving his mother's home, he was attacked by the Russian hitmen who killed his mom. Marcus defeated them and began to question one before being shot with a bow and arrow. He turned around to see [[Taskmaster]] standing before him. Taskmaster was about to kill him, but [[Captain America]] arrived in time to save Marcus Johnson at the last moment. [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents arrived to try to bring Marcus Johnson to safety. Marcus went off with [[Daisy Johnson|Quake]] to a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility where he was visited by Captain America in the infirmary. Marcus Johnson continued to question why everyone was after him and why his mother was killed yet was not given any answers. Soon, Marcus began to feel as if he was being held there against his will and broke out.<ref>''Battle Scars'' #2</ref> 

Marcus Johnson contacted an old Ranger friend for help and informed him of his current situation. They planned to find Taskmaster and attempt to get some information. While searching for Taskmaster, Marcus was attacked by [[Deadpool]] who was also after Marcus. As they fought, Taskmaster arrived and ran Deadpool through with his sword. Marcus Johnson took on Taskmaster and this time gained the upper hand. At that time, the [[Serpent Squad]] arrived also looking for Marcus Johnson. Marcus Johnson took them on, lasting only about fifteen seconds before being electrocuted by [[Rattler (comics)|Rattler]]. Deadpool returned and due to the confusion, Marcus was able to escape with Taskmaster as his prisoner. He interrogated Taskmaster, but before he was able to get an answer, a masked man stunned Taskmaster, then drained Marcus Johnson' energy for a moment, and escaped. Marcus Johnson caught up with the man and unmasked him who revealed himself to be Marcus's father [[Nick Fury]].<ref>''Battle Scars'' #4</ref>

While arguing and eventually coming to blows over the revelation, Nick Fury and Marcus Johnson were ambushed by more mercenaries and easily captured. In the custody of Orion, Marcus Johnson had his left eye cut out and tests were run by Orion's men confirming that Johnson had the [[List of comic book drugs#Infinity Formula|Infinity Formula]] in his DNA. Nick Fury slipped his restraints and gave Marcus Johnson enough time to escape (even if accidentally), but Nick Fury was brought in to give Orion a blood transfusion to restore him to a youthful state. The transfusion drained Nick Fury of the remaining Infinity Formula in his system. Nick Fury was then tortured and had his mind probed by Orion's telepath, wherein they found all of Nick Fury's S.H.I.E.L.D. secrets and fail-safes.<ref name="Scars5"/>

Marcus Johnson saved Nick Fury and with the help of his friend Cheese (the alias of [[Phil Coulson]]). Marcus Johnson was able to get Orion alone and kill him. He was taken to get his wounds cared for and was also given the Super Soldier uniform that Steve Rogers once wore. As a new agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., Marcus Johnson was also informed by Daisy Johnson that his birth name is Nicholas Fury, Jr.<ref>''Battle Scars'' #6</ref>

Nick Fury Jr. and Phil Coulson make a [[cameo appearance]] in ''[[Kaine#Scarlet Spider|Scarlet Spider]]'' #5,<ref>[[Scarlet Spider (comic book)#Volume 2|''Scarlet Spider'' vol. 2]] #5</ref> and are part of the [[framing sequence]] in ''[[Marvel NOW!]] Point One''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=user_review&id=5287|title=Review: Marvel NOW! Point One|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=17 October 2012}}</ref>

As part of the ''[[Marvel NOW!]]'' event, Nick Fury Jr., Phil Coulson, and Maria Hill form the S.H.I.E.L.D. version of the Secret Avengers with [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] and [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]]. Nick Fury Jr. was involved in the first mission that involved fighting some [[al-Qaeda]] terrorists. Nick Fury Jr. awaited in the Oval Office for one of the al-Qaeda terrorists to enter and Nick Fury Jr. kills the terrorist.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' vol. 2 #1</ref> Nick Fury Jr. then went with the Secret Avengers to raid Bagalia in order to recruit Taskmaster. While the Secret Avengers were fighting the [[Masters of Evil]], Nick Fury Jr. manages to pay off [[Crossfire (comics)|Crossfire]] to let Taskmaster out of his imprisonment.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' vol. 2 #2</ref>

When Daisy Johnson and Nick Fury Jr. were attending the weapons expo, they meet up with Senator [[Rebel Ralston|Robert Ralston]] where Daisy Johnson notices that one of the items at the expo is the [[Iron Patriot]] armor.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' vol. 2 #3</ref>

==Reception==
