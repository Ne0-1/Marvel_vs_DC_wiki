==Fictional character biography==
[[File:Marcus Johnson Nick Fury jr.png|thumb|upright|left|Nicholas Joseph Fury, Jr. in ''Battle Scars'' #6 (April 2012). Art by [[Scot Eaton]].]]
While serving in the Middle East, Marcus Johnson is told that his mother Nia Jones has been murdered back in the United States. He returns home and is attacked by the men who killed her, and by [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]], but is saved by [[Captain America]]. [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents arrive and take him to a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility, after a while Johnson comes to feel he is being held there against his will and escapes.<ref>''Battle Scars'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> He escapes and is caught by Taskmaster once again. Before he can obtain any information, a man in a mask saves him and escapes. Johnson catches up to the man, who is revealed to be Johnson's father, [[Nick Fury]].<ref>''Battle Scars'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> Fury and Johnson are captured by a former member of the organization [[Leviathan (Marvel Comics)|Leviathan]] named Orion who has Johnson's left eye cut out and confirms that Johnson has the Infinity Formula in his DNA. Fury breaks his restraints and gives Johnson enough time to escape, but is captured and his blood transfused to Orion, so that Orion's youth can be restored. The transfusion drains Fury of his remaining Infinity Formula. Johnson saves Fury with the help of S.H.I.E.L.D. agent [[Phil Coulson]] and later kills Orion. After convalescing, Johnson is given the Super Soldier uniform that Steve Rogers used to wear. As a new agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., Johnson is also informed that his birth name is "Nicholas J Fury Jr.".<ref name=scars6>''Battle Scars'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

But under the influence of the inversion spell, Wilson was violent and punched him before leaving.<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #4</ref>

During the ''[[Civil War II]]'' storyline, Nick Fury Jr. was on a mission to neutralize a Hydra cell that were posing as S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents. The prediction of [[Ulysses (comics)|Ulysses Cain]]'s vision had the Hydra cell's attack on S.H.I.E.L.D. be fatal. When heading to a base in Arizona, Nick Fury Jr. was attacked by actual agents instead of Hydra infiltrators as suspected. In order for him to find the traitors, Nick Fury Jr. faked his death and went under the radar.<ref>''Civil War II: Choosing Sides'' #1</ref> Upon interrogating a dirty S.H.I.E.L.D. benefactor named Elton Blake, Nick Fury Jr. was directed to the S.H.I.E.L.D. base Ulu in Alaska.<ref>''Civil War II: Choosing Sides'' #2</ref> Arriving at Ulu and confronting the unknown mastermind, Nick Fury Jr. was caught off-guard by the unknown mastermind who got away.<ref>''Civil War II: Choosing Sides'' #3</ref> Upon infiltrating the base Ogma, Nick Fury Jr. managed to download classified data and escape while evading Black Widow in the process.<ref>''Civil War II: Choosing Sides'' #4</ref> Nick Fury Jr.'s investigation led him to the underground base Kratos where he encountered a rogue [[Life Model Decoy]] of his father Nick Fury named Leader who stated that Ulysses Cain's prediction didn't involve the Hydra cell and that it would've cost him his life. Leader learned about Ulysses Cain's abilities and wanted to take Nick Fury Jr. out of the picture so that he can take over S.H.I.E.L.D. and reinvent it. In order to stop Leader, Nick Fury Jr. had to destroy the main support beam which caused Kratos to collapse and destroy Leader.<ref>''Civil War: Choosing Sides'' #5</ref> Upon surviving the collapse, Nick Fury Jr. salvaged Leader's head so that he can hack it and learn how he discovered his plan. Nick Fury Jr. forgave Maria Hill for sending him on a mission that would've resulted in his death and states that he is not ready to return to S.H.I.E.L.D. yet.<ref>''Civil War II: Choosing Sides'' #6</ref>

==Powers and abilities==

Marcus inherited his father's Infinity Formula at birth, slowing his aging process, speeding his healing time, and granting him peak human physical abilities.<ref name=scars6/>
