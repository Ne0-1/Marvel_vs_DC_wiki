==Fictional character biography==
While serving in the Middle East, Marcus Johnson receives word that his mother Nia Jones has been murdered back in the United States. He returns home and is attacked by the Russian hitmen who killed her, and by [[Taskmaster]], but is saved by [[Captain America]]. [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents arrive and take him to a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility for medical treatment. After failing to get answers as to why he was targeted and his mother killed, Johnson comes to feel he is being held there against his will and escapes.<ref>''Battle Scars'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> 

While searching for Taskmaster, Marcus is attacked by [[Deadpool]], who is also after Marcus. As they fight, Taskmaster arrived and dispatches Deadpool, but Marcus himself defeats Taskmaster. Johnson is felled, however, by the [[Serpent Squad]]. When Deadpool again intervenes, Johnson escapes with Taskmaster as his prisoner, and later interrogates him. Before he can obtain any information, a masked man stuns Taskmaster, drains Johnson's energy for a moment, and escapes. Johnson catches up with the man, who is revealed to be Johnson's father, [[Nick Fury]].<ref>''Battle Scars'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

While arguing and eventually coming to blows over the revelation, Fury and Johnson are captured by mercenaries who bring them to Orion (who was a former member of the organization [[Leviathan (Marvel Comics)|Leviathan]]). Orion has Johnson's left eye cut out and confirms that Johnson has the [[List of comic book drugs#Infinity Formula|Infinity Formula]] in his DNA. Fury escapes his restraints and gives Johnson enough time to escape, but Fury is captured and his blood transfused to Orion, so that Orion's youth can be restored. The transfusion drains Fury of the remaining Infinity Formula in his system, and he is then tortured and mind-probed by Orion's telepath, who acquires all of Fury's S.H.I.E.L.D. secrets and fail-safes.<ref name="Scars5"/>

Johnson saves Fury with the help of S.H.I.E.L.D. agent [[Phil Coulson]] and later kills Orion. After convalescing, Johnson is given the Super Soldier uniform that Steve Rogers once wore. As a new agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., Johnson is also informed that his birth name is "Nicholas Fury Jr.".<ref>''Battle Scars'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Fury Jr. and Phil Coulson make a [[cameo appearance]] in ''[[Kaine Parker#Scarlet Spider|Scarlet Spider]]'' #5,<ref>[[Scarlet Spider (comic book)#Volume 2|''Scarlet Spider'' vol. 2]] #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> and are part of the [[framing sequence]] in ''[[Marvel NOW!]] Point One''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=user_review&id=5287|title=Review: Marvel NOW! Point One|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=17 October 2012}}</ref>

In a 2013 storyline as part of the [[Marvel NOW!]] branding, Nick Fury Jr., Coulson, and [[Maria Hill]] form the S.H.I.E.L.D. version of the Secret Avengers with [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] and [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]]. Fury Jr. is involved in the first mission that involved fighting a group of [[al-Qaeda]] terrorists.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' vol. 2 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Fury Jr. then joins the Secret Avengers to raid Bagalia in order to recruit Taskmaster. While the Secret Avengers are fighting the [[Masters of Evil]], Fury Jr. manages to pay off [[Crossfire (comics)|Crossfire]] to let Taskmaster out of his imprisonment.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' vol. 2 #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the ''[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]'' storyline, Nick Fury Jr. was with S.H.I.E.L.D. when the organization has gathered Captain America to discuss what was going to be of the Red Skull, now that the Stark Sentinels had been dismantled and the concentration camps torn down. Nick Fury Jr. tried to convince Sam Wilson to hand him over. But under the influence of the inversion spell, Wilson was violent and punched him before leaving.<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #4</ref>

==Reception==
The reaction by comic book fans to the revelation of Marcus Johnson being Nick Fury's son and his replacing his father has been mixed.<ref name="BadHaven"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://crimsonmonkey.com/blogs/daveomac/nick-fury-jr-the-disney-mandated-director-of-shield/|title=Nick Fury Jr: The Disney Mandated Director of SHIELD|publisher=Crimson Monkey|date=2012-04-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://insidepulse.com/2012/04/25/samuel-l-jackson-enters-the-marvel-universe-check-out-marcus-johnsons-new-look/ |title=Samuel L.
