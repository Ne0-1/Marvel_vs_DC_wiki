'''Evangeline "Vange" Whedon''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[mutant (fictional)#Marvel Comics|mutant]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|Universe]]. Her first appearance was in ''X-Treme X-Men #21''.

==Character history==
Vange Whedon is a lawyer and a member of the Mutant Rights Coalition (or Mutant Rights League). Her ability to shapeshift is triggered when she comes in contact with blood. Evangeline used to be a successful prosecutor until others learned that she was a mutant. She was fired instantly and evicted from her apartment the next day. Her ''fianc√©'' left her with an e-mail and her family disowned her.

When the [[X-Men]] [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] and [[Sage (comics)|Sage]]  were being held in police custody, Whedon and the Mutant Rights League staged a protest for their release. While Evangeline was talking to Detective Cardones, a human struck the detective with a brick. The blood from the wound dripped on to Whedon, and caused her to shapeshift involuntarily. She transformed into a beast that resembled a dragon, and was out of control. Sage was able to stop Vange momentarily, while Bishop calmed her down enough to revert to her human form.

Evangeline was called to Los Angeles when the X-Men needed help (legal help). Evangeline succeeded in getting [[Marie D'Ancanto]], an anti-mutant terrorist given a second chance by the X-Men, under probation and hired her as an assistant. Evangeline also helped the X-Men against a lawyer secretly working for the psychic mutant [[Elias Bogan]].

''X-Men: The 198 Files'' reveals that she kept her powers after the "[[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]]" of the mutant population, the government considers her a 'Significant' national security threat. And she currently still acts as the X-Men's lawyer.

==Powers==
