'''Evangeline "Vange" Whedon''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|Universe]]. Her first appearance was in ''[[X-Treme X-Men]]'' #21.

==Fictional character biography==
Vange Whedon is a lawyer and a member of the Mutant Rights Coalition (or Mutant Rights League). Her ability to shapeshift is triggered when she comes in contact with blood. Evangeline used to be a successful prosecutor until others learned that she was a mutant. She was fired instantly and evicted from her apartment the next day. Her ''fianc√©'' left her with an e-mail and her family disowned her.{{Issue 40|January 2004}}

When the [[X-Men]] [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] and [[Sage (comics)|Sage]] were being held in police custody, Whedon and the Mutant Rights League staged a protest for their release. While Evangeline was talking to Detective Cardones, a human struck the detective with a brick. The blood from the wound dripped on to Whedon, and caused her to shapeshift involuntarily. She transformed into a beast that resembled a [[dragon]], and was out of control. Sage was able to stop Vange momentarily, while Bishop calmed her down enough to revert to her human form.{{Issue|date=August 2009}}

Evangeline was called to Los Angeles when the X-Men needed legal help. Evangeline succeeded in getting [[Marie D'Ancanto]], an anti-mutant terrorist, given a second chance by the X-Men, under probation and hired her as an assistant. Evangeline also helped the X-Men against a lawyer secretly working for the psychic mutant [[Elias Bogan]].{{Issue|date=August 2009}}

''X-Men: The 198 Files'' reveals that she kept her powers after the "[[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]]" of the mutant population - the government considers her a 'Significant' national security threat. She currently still acts as the X-Men's lawyer.{{Issue|date=August 2009}}

In Generation Hope #8, she is Teon's lawyer and defends him in court to keep him from being returned to the custody of his parents.

==Powers and abilities==
Vange Whedon is a metamorph, and can transform herself into an enormous winged red dragon. This can be triggered consciously or by the presence of blood. In this form she has all the powers of a dragon, such as fiery breath and tough scales.
