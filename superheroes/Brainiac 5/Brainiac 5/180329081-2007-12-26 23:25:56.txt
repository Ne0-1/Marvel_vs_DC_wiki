'''Brainiac 5''' ('''Querl Dox''') is a [[fictional character]] who exists in the future of the [[DC Universe]]. He is a long standing member of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]. Brainiac 5 is from the planet [[Colu]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Silver Age===
Brainiac 5 made his first appearance in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #276 (May 1961). A green-skinned, blond-haired teenager, dressed in a purple jumpsuit, he claimed to be descended from the original [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]], a Superman villain. He wished to join the Legion as atonement for his great-great-grandfather's misdeeds. When Brainiac 1 was revealed to be an android created by the Computer Tyrants, Brainiac 5 "discovered" he was actually descended from Brainiac 2, the leader of the rebellion against the tyrants, whom Brainiac had briefly "adopted".

Brainiac 5's ingenuity led to the invention of, amongst other things, the Legion flight ring (perfecting an invention of the original [[Invisible Kid]] based on a metal discovered by [[Mon-El]]), the anti-lead serum that allowed Mon-El to leave the [[Phantom Zone]] and the force field belt which became the signature device of the character.

Another of Brainiac 5's creations would have less beneficial effects. The super computer [[Computo (comics)|Computo]], which he created, attempted to take over the world, killing one of [[Triplicate Girl]]'s three selves. He successfully destroyed his creation with "an [[anti-matter]] force", but this highlighted one of his major flaws: A habit of initiating projects without considering the dangers. A much later example was his transformation of fellow scientist Professor Jaxon Rugarth into the psychotic, all-powerful [[Infinite Man]] in conjunction with honorary Legionnaire [[Rond Vidar]].

In fact, as time went on, Brainiac 5 began to be portrayed as downright unstable. Long attracted to [[Supergirl]], ''[[Superboy]]'' #204 (September-October 1974) showed him building a robot duplicate of her in his sleep, and convincing himself this was the real Supergirl. He seemed to recover from this, but a few years later would become even more unbalanced.

In ''Superboy'' #224 (Feb 1977), the Legion encountered [[Pulsar Stargrave]], a villain who convinced Brainiac 5 that he was the Coluan's long-lost father. Brainiac 5 joined Stargrave to battle the sorcerer [[Mordru]], but the android's influence would haunt him long after that. It was claimed in ''Superboy'' #225 that Stargrave was actually the original Brainiac android, but the truth of this is uncertain.

When Stargrave murdered [[Ultra Boy]]'s girlfriend [[An Ryd]], Brainiac 5, driven mad by Stargrave, framed Ultra Boy for the murder. [[Chameleon Boy]], who suspected this from the beginning, finally found proof when Brainiac's madness led him to an attempt to destroy the universe, utilizing the [[Miracle Machine]], a device that turned thoughts into reality. He was stopped by [[Matter-Eater Lad]], who ate the machine, and both were committed to a mental institution, the energies of the Machine having driven Matter-Eater Lad insane as well.

Brainiac 5 eventually recovered his sanity and rejoined the group. Shortly afterward, however, he was accused of having murdered Ultra Boy's girlfriend himself. To prove his innocence, he went after Stargrave and finally defeated him. He later managed to cure [[Matter-Eater Lad]]'s insanity as well. Around this time, he also undid another of his mistakes by finally finding a way of controlling Computo.

===Post-''Crisis''===
In ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' vol.3, #16 (Oct 1985), published simultaneously with ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' #10, Brainiac 5 was melancholic, reflecting it was the thousand-year anniversary of Supergirl's death. However, as the Crisis eliminated Supergirl from existence, Brainiac 5 (as well as everyone else) had no recollection of her. Beyond this, however, Brainiac 5's history was relatively unaffected by the Crisis, although it would be some time before he received an origin that reflected the new Brainiac 1. 

Following the death of the pocket universe [[Superboy]], Brainiac 5 was one of a number of Legionnaires who swore revenge on the [[Time Trapper]]. To this end, he recreated the Infinite Man. The Infinite Man and Time Trapper seemingly destroyed each other, but Brainiac 5 quit the Legion after being accused of murdering Professor Rugarth. He rejoined in ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' vol.3, #63 (Aug 1989), shortly before the '''Five Year Gap'''.

==="Five Year Gap"===
Five years after the end of the "Magic Wars", things had radically changed for the heroes, most notably the disbanding of the Legion and an ongoing war with the [[Khund]] Empire, which had resulted in Earth's government (Earthgov) signing a deal with the [[Dominators]]. When ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' vol. 4, began, Brainiac 5 was dedicated to finding a cure to the [[Validus]] Plague, a virulent disease that had afflicted an entire planet and crippled the former [[Lightning Lad]], Garth Ranzz.

Soon after the start of ''Legion'' vol. 4, a [[retcon]] removed the Superman family of characters almost completely from Legion continuity. Supergirl was replaced by [[Laurel Gand]], a Daxamite and presumed descendant of [[Lar Gand]]. Unlike Supergirl, she was a native of the 30th century.  Brainiac 5 and Laurel did have a relationship, but the couple eventually separated and she became the [[common-law marriage|common law wife]] of [[Rond Vidar]] (a Legion ally and [[Green Lantern Corps|Green Lantern]] who had been a close friend of Brainiac 5).

Brainiac 5 joined other Legionnaires in searching for the space pirate Roxxas, and was present when the team officially reformed.

After the war, Brainiac 5 discovered the timestream was extremely unstable, and that Legion history was in a state of constant flux. This was the first indication of ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]'', the event that would lead to the Legion's whole history being rebooted.

===Post-''Zero Hour''===
Following the Zero Hour event and the rebooting of the Legion, the "new" Brainiac 5 was extremely antisocial and disrespectful of his colleagues. He barely interacted with the other Legionnaires, although he was still somewhat attracted to Laurel Gand, now called [[Andromeda (DC Comics)|Andromeda]], who was now also something of an outsider. When Andromeda was believed killed, he was the only person who really missed her, a wrenching experience for someone used to suppressing emotion.

It was later revealed that, even amongst Coluans, Querl Dox had been something of a loner, due to his even higher intelligence, interest in practical experiments rather than "pure" thought, and lack of concern about the consequences of his experiments.

Having created a method of travelling back to the 20th century, leading to the Legion's rescue of [[Valor (comics)|Valor]], Brainiac 5 was arrested for unauthorized time-travel. He was later pardoned when [[R.J. Brande]] became President of the United Planets.

===Trapped in the 20th century===
Brainiac 5 was one of a number of Legionnaires who were trapped in the 20th century. He spent his efforts then trying to find a way back to his own time using 20th century equipment. He finally produced a computer capable of doing this, utilizing a [[New Gods]] [[Mother Box]] and a responsometer from the [[Metal Men]]. Unfortunately, this became the post-Zero Hour 
C.O.M.P.U.T.O. The Legion had to defeat it and separate it into its component pieces before returning to their own time.

While in the 20th century, he also encountered his ancestors, Brainiac and [[Vril Dox]] II, as well as the post-Crisis Supergirl. Ironically, he was attracted to Supergirl due to her similarity to Andromeda (some stories suggested that Brainiac 5's attraction for tall blonde women was linked to his desire to find his mother, a tall blonde who had abandoned him at birth).

===Upgrades: Brainiac 5.1===
Upon his return, he was part of a team that investigated a mysterious space anomaly. The anomaly "upgraded" him: he was now more considerate of others, and had vastly improved people skills. He also internalized his force shield apparatus. His friend [[Gates (comics)|Gates]] dubbed the improved Querl Dox "Brainiac 5.1", a name he adopted.

Shortly after that, the Legion investigated the criminal/terrorist organization called the [[Dark Circle]]. Querl learned his mother, [[Brainiac 4]], was the leader of the Dark Circle, having found that mass destruction was the only thing capable of making her feel emotions. The shock of this almost caused him to revert to his former, distant self. Although he did not revert, he began to be somewhat sarcastic and impatient again. He also began researching without considering the consequences again, inadvertently transforming the team into a "[[Bizarro]] Legion".

===''Legion Lost''===
Brainiac 5.1 was one of a number of Legionnaires who were cast into a distant galaxy when the Stargate network was shut down. They spent a year travelling through the "Lost Galaxy". During this time, he felt a great amount of stress, as his teammates all believed he could devise a way of getting them home in addition to all the other responsibilities forced upon him by the circumstances of their situation. As he eventually confessed to [[Saturn Girl]], he didn't have a clue how to get them home - or even where "home" was, relative to their location. In the same conversation, he also complained that he'd "always hated [his] name upgrade," and on the way out, as well as reassuring him, she made a point of redubbing him "Brainiac '''Five'''," and he dropped the ".1" from his name thereafter. Eventually, using his teammate [[Shikari]]'s tracking skills and an interdimensional doorway they'd earlier found, but been forced to leave, he did get them home.

Upon their return, Brainiac began developing a replacement for the Stargates, based on the "threshold" doorway they had used to return from the Lost Galaxy. Restoring the connection to the planet Xanthu, they learned that it had been at war with Robotica, the "robot homeworld", until they mysteriously disappeared.  

Robotica's leader was revealed as C.O.M.P.U.T.O. A strike team was launched against it, but Brainiac 5 tricked it into upgrading itself, so it no longer sought vengeance. It was revealed that the Coluans disapproved of artificial intelligence, however, and Brainiac 5 was made a pariah on his homeworld for saving machine-life from destruction.

==="Threeboot"===
{{main|One Year Later}}
In the current ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' book, Brainiac 5 is portrayed as similar to his ancestor [[Vril Dox II]] in ''[[L.E.G.I.O.N.]]''. He is just as arrogant and unthinking of others as the previous version was initially, but is more politically savvy. He has a tendency to put plans in motion without consulting Legion leader [[Cosmic Boy]], who suspects him of planning a coup. He also has problems with [[Dream Girl]] as he hates that she is able to predict the future without scientific means. "Brainy" was also unnerved when she told him that they would one day marry. When she was killed during Terror Firma's attack on the Legion HQ on Earth, he became obsessed with "outthinking death."

Following Cosmic Boy's disappearance, Brainiac 5 has become the advisor to current Legion leader [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]]. Her uncertainty and lack of knowledge of the 31st century leads many Legion members to believe that he, and not Supergirl, is the real decision-maker.

===''The Lightning Saga''===
An alternate version of Braniac 5 resembling the pre-Crisis incarnation briefly appeared in the Justice League/Justice Society ''Lightning Saga'' crossover. He was revealed as the mastermind behind the Legion's plot to return to the 21st century to retrieve someone connected to [[Flash (comics)| the Flash]]. At the end of the storyline, Brainiac 5 was seen holding one of the lightning rods the Legionnaires used on 21st century [[Earth]], and told his teammates that the Legion had gotten what it came for.  This Brainiac 5's agenda does not end there, however; in the pages of ''[[Countdown (DC Comics)|Countdown]]'', [[Triplicate Girl|Una]] arrived in the present to stop [[Val Armorr|Karate Kid]] from returning to the 31st century, explaining that Brainiac 5 says the two of them have another mission in the present day.

==Powers and abilities==
Brainiac 5 possess a "12th-Level Intellect," which grants him superhuman calculation skills, amazing [[memory]] and exceptional technical know-how. By comparison, 20th century Earth as a whole constitutes a "6th-Level" intelligence, and most of his fellow [[Colu]]ans have an "8th-Level" intelligence. 31st century Earth as a whole is a "9th-Level" intelligence.

==Other media==
In ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', Brainiac 5 made an appearance in the episode "New Kids In Town", chatting with fellow teammate [[Triplicate Girl]]. Its unclear if he, in fact, uses the name ''Brainiac 5'' or has any connections to Brainiac. However, his costume included a chest symbol comprising three circles forming an inverted triangle. This closely resembled the discs on the animated Brainiac's forehead (and his icon when he was a computer program), suggesting some kind of connection between them.

He reappeared in an episode of ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' voiced by [[Matt Czuchry]]. It is revealed that Brainiac learned to pass its code biologically and created Brainiac 5 as an organic being; unfortunately for Brainiac, Brainiac 5 rejected evil and joined the Legion of Super Heroes. Here, he brings [[Green Arrow]], [[Supergirl]] and [[John Stewart (comics)|Green Lantern]] into the future to help him battle the [[Fatal Five]]. He and Supergirl fall in love and she elects to stay in the 30th century with him.

In the new ''[[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)|Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' animated series, airing Saturday mornings on [[The CW]], he is a part of the core Legion team and its youngest member. His voice is provided by actor [[Adam Wylie]]. In the series, Brainiac 5 is a robot and, in addition to possessing 12th-level intelligence, is able to transform into a more powerful robotic body (bearing some resemblance to the pre-Crisis version of the present-day Brainiac android in the comics). This appears to be the "standard" Coluan form, with Brainiac 5's usual appearance having been chosen to be more human. Unlike many versions where he is portrayed as cold and unfeeling, this version of Brainiac 5 is considerably more emotional.  He often appears eager to prove himself to his older teammates, particularly the original Superman; Brainiac 5, unlike his villainous ancestor, idolizes Superman.  However, his high intellect and his emotional nature often cause him internal conflict; for example, he idolizes Superman, but knows intellectually that he cannot reveal many of the things he knows lie in the future for Superman once he is returned to his own time, as Superman's knowledge of 'future' events could change what is, for the Legion, history.  In the second season episode "Chained Lightning", and "Message in a bottle" Brainiac 5 grows close to Shrinking Violet; it remains to be seen whether this is romantic, or just a friendship.

In the second season premiere, [[Superman X]] (a clone of Superman from the 41st century) hints that someday, Brainiac 5 will be responsible for something terrible in the future, possibly along the lines of the atrocities of the original Brainiac.

In "Message in a bottle", it is revealed that the original Brainiac (voiced by [[Corey Burton]]; Burton provided the voice of the villain Brainiac in the earlier [[Superman: The Animated Series]], however that series and Legion of Super Heroes do not share a common continuity) has been observing Brainiac 5 since he came online. Brainiac 5 travels within himself to meet with his ancestor, where he is offered data from the original Braniac. Brainiac 5 accepts the 'gift' from his ancestor as it is supposed to 'open new avenues of possibilities'. By the end of the episode, it appears Brainiac tricked his descendant into integrating the download as Brainiac 5 smiles evily.
