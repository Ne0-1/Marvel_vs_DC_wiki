'''Fandral the Dashing''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] Character and a charter member of the [[Warriors Three]]; a trio of Asgardian adventurers consisting of Fandral, [[Hogun]] the Grim, and [[Volstagg]] the Voluminous. They were members of the supporting cast in Marvel's [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] comics and usually provided comic relief and side-adventures.

Fandral is an irrepressible swashbuckler and romantic. His bravery and optimism often puts the group in highly disadvantageous positions; as perrenially pointed out by the gloomy [[Hogun]]. Fandral considers himelf the consummate ladies' man and is often depicted with a bevy of young ladies. His actual success with these ladies is intermittent at best, but as such provides numerous opportunities for humorous results. Despite these flaws, he possesses an excessively noble spirit and will do the right thing without thought to his personal safety or prosperity.

In Thunderstrike #18, Fandral relates a tale concerning a journey to Earth and his subsequent marriage to a woman named Marian;  the time period and other details suggest that Fandral is thus the source for the [[Robin Hood]] myth.  However, this is not explicitly stated in Fandral's recounting, and other sources suggest that Robin Hood's legend (in the Marvel Universe) has a different source[http://www.marveldatabase.com/Fandral].

In 2005 a mini-series was published centering around [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and his allies in the [[Warriors Three]], called Thor: Blood Oath. In it Thor and the Warriors Three are sent on a quest as penance for accidentally killing an enemy giant during a time of peace : they have to collect sacred items all around the world with the special rule of Thor not being allowed to use his uru hammer Mjolnir in combat. Although the Giants prove to be untrustworthy and not ready to accept the quartet's victory after they've accomplished the tasks, through the use of each warrior's unique capabilities, the adventure eventually comes to a good end.

It is generally accepted that Jack Kirby based Fandral on actor [[Errol Flynn]].

==Powers and abilities==
Fandral is a master swordsman, and excellent overall battlefield warrior. He is highly proficient in the use of all edged weapons, and his dexterity, speed, and agility are all significantly greater than the average Asgardian male. [[Thor]] himself refers to Fandral as "the best of us with the blade" in Blood Oath #6. Like all Asgardians, Fandral's bone, skin and muscle are roughly 3 times denser than a typical human, giving him an extremely high resistance to injury and superhuman strength.
