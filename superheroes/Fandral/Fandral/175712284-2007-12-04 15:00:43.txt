'''Fandral the Dashing''' is a [[Marvel Comics]] Character and a charter member of the [[Warriors Three]], a trio of Asgardian adventurers consisting of Fandral, [[Hogun]] the Grim, and [[Volstagg]] the Valiant. They were members of the supporting cast in Marvel's [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] comics and usually provided comic relief and side-adventures.

==Fictional character biography==
Fandral is an irrepressible swashbuckler and romantic. His bravery and optimism often puts the group in highly disadvantageous positions; as perennially pointed out by the gloomy [[Hogun]]. Fandral considers himself the consummate ladies' man and is often depicted with a bevy of young ladies. His actual success with these ladies is intermittent at best, but as such provides numerous opportunities for humorous results. Despite these flaws, he possesses an excessively noble spirit and will do the right thing without thought to his personal safety or prosperity.

Fandral relates a tale concerning a journey to Earth and his subsequent marriage to a woman named Marian. <ref>''Thunderstrike'' #18</ref> The time period and other details suggest that Fandral is thus the source for the [[Robin Hood]] myth.  However, this is not explicitly stated in Fandral's recounting, and other sources suggest that Robin Hood's legend (in the Marvel Universe) has a different source.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Fandral once set off on a mission to repair mischief done by [[Loki (comics)|Loki]]. During this, he learns that his womanizing ways have deeply hurt many women. He is overcome by great shame and declares, 'for the nonce, I have forsworn philandering'. <ref>''Marvel Fanfare #36'' </ref>

Once, Thor and the Warriors Three are sent on a quest as penance for accidentally killing an enemy giant during a time of peace: they have to collect sacred items all around the world with the special rule of Thor not being allowed to use his [[Uru (Marvel Comics)|uru]] hammer [[Mjolnir (Marvel Comics)|Mjolnir]] in combat. Although the Giants prove to be untrustworthy and not ready to accept the quartet's victory after they've accomplished the tasks, through the use of each warrior's unique capabilities, the adventure eventually comes to a good end. <ref>''Thor: Blood Oath'' #1-6</ref>

It is generally accepted that Jack Kirby based Fandral on actor [[Errol Flynn]].{{Fact|date=September 2007}}

Fandral seemingly perishes early on in the final battle of Ragnarok. Others who have perished in the same battle, such as Heimdall, have been found alive and well on Earth.

==Powers and abilities==
Fandral is a master swordsman, and excellent overall battlefield warrior. He is highly proficient in the use of all edged weapons, and his dexterity, speed, and agility are all significantly greater than the average Asgardian male. Thor himself refers to Fandral as "the best of us with the blade". <ref>''Thor: Blood Oath'' #6</ref> Like all Asgardians, Fandral's bone, skin and muscle are roughly 3 times denser than a typical human, giving him an extremely high resistance to injury and superhuman strength.
